25|$|When {{treating}} avascular necrosis of {{the bone}} in people with sickle cell disease, the aim of treatment is to reduce or stop the pain and maintain <b>joint</b> <b>mobility.</b> Current treatment options are to rest the joint, physical therapy, pain relief medicine, joint replacement surgery, or bone grafting. High quality randomized controlled trials are needed to assess the most effective treatment option and determine if a combination of physical therapy and surgery are more effective than physical therapy alone.|$|E
25|$|Pressure wounds {{are often}} the result of local {{ischemia}} from the increased pressure. Increased pressure also plays a roles in many diabetic foot ulcerations as changes due to the disease causes the foot to suffer limited <b>joint</b> <b>mobility</b> and creates pressure points {{on the bottom of}} the foot. Effective measures to treat this includes a surgical procedure called the gastrocnemius recession in which the calf muscle is lengthened to decrease the fulcrum created by this muscle and resulting in a decrease in plantar forefoot pressure.|$|E

30|$|The first {{process of}} our system is <b>joints</b> <b>mobility</b> measurement. In the {{beginning}} of the <b>joints</b> <b>mobility</b> measurement, in order to let Xtion PRO LIVE detect the subject successfully, the subject needs to stand in the restricted position. After detecting successfully, the subject can start the measurement. In addition, during the assessment, the subject is asked to wear our sensing device on his/her wrist for detecting subject’s body temperature. There are three sensors installed on this device, including a body temperature sensor, an accelerator sensor, and a gyroscope sensor. After the subject completes a designated posture, the inspector can keep going on next movement. After all testing movements are completed, the results are then recorded into the database.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{investigate}} the effect of two different methods ofmeasurement for hamstring flexibility. Forty male students athletes with mean age 23. 45 ± 0. 44 years and forty non-athletes students with a mean age 23. 08 ± 0. 98 years participated in this study. Hamstring flexibility was evaluated by two different methods of measurement: a) a Myrin goni-ometer and b) sit and reach test. Statistical analysis included the use of Independent Samples T-test while significance was set at p< 0. 01. The results indicated that athletes students scored betterthan non-athletes students only when hip <b>joint’s</b> <b>mobility</b> was measured with a Myrin goniometer. In conclusion the evaluation of <b>joint's</b> <b>mobility</b> should be done by using a method of measure-ment that would isolate the articulation of measurement from the interjection of other joints ormuscular teams something that is achieved by the use of Myrin goniometer than the use of Sitand Reach test...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background: Generalized <b>joint</b> hyper <b>mobility</b> predisposes some {{individuals}} {{to a wide}} variety of musculoskeletal complaints. Given the critical role of scapular position in function of shoulder, the aim of this study was to compare scapular position between persons with and without general <b>joint</b> hyper <b>mobility.</b>  Methods: By nonprobability sampling 30 hyper mobile persons at average of 22. 86 ± 2. 77 years of age and 30 non hyper mobile persons (age 23. 6 ± 2. 73 years) through a case-control design participated in the study. Scapular position was assessed according to the lateral scapular slide test. Independent t test and repeated measures ANOVA were used to statistically analyze scapular position differences between groups.  Results: Compared to non hyper mobile persons, those with General <b>joint</b> hyper <b>mobility</b> demonstrated a significantly higher superior scapula slide in dependent arm position (p= 0. 03). However, no significant difference was found between another scores between two groups (p> 0. 05).  Conclusion: The results suggest that altered scapular position may be an important aspect of General <b>joint</b> hyper <b>mobility...</b>|$|R

40|$|Shoulder {{function}} is {{a compromise between}} mobility and stability.

30|$|At the moment, the {{improvements}} are achieved by considering a kinematic {{model of the}} manipulator only. However, the improvement could be increased by incorporating {{a higher level of}} detail of the manipulator into the model. The higher level of detail is achieved by introducing further parameters, e.g. non-geometric errors like <b>joint</b> <b>mobilities</b> or elasticities. This would require the computation of forces acting on the links and joints, which can be achieved by using a dynamic model of the manipulator described by differential equations. As shown in [30], the same approach for differential equation models can be used when the required derivative information is available. However, this approach is yet to be investigated for the dynamics of multi-body systems acting as dynamic model for the parameter identification procedure.|$|R

The purpose of this work is to describe some common problems in JHS that render psychological intervention in their overall management relevant. Chronic pain, associated psychopathological factors such as anxiety, depression and somatosensory amplification, and problems arising from a lack of recognition and knowledge of the syndrome, are frequent among those affected, having a negative impact on their quality of life.

50|$|Perhaps {{the biggest}} reason for {{misdiagnosis}} or lack of diagnosis of sacroiliac joint dysfunction {{is based on the}} inability of common radiological imaging to discern the disorder. Diagnostic testing, such as X-ray, CT scan, or MRI, do not usually reveal abnormalities; therefore, they cannot reliably be used for diagnosis of sacroiliac joint dysfunction. There is a new definitive imaging test SPECT/CT which can sometimes detect sacroiliac joint dysfunction. There is also a lack of evidence that sacroiliac <b>joint</b> <b>mobility</b> maneuvers (Gillet, Standing flexion test, and Seated Flexion test) detect motion abnormalities. Given the inherent technical limitations of the visible and palpable signs from these sacroiliac <b>joint</b> <b>mobility</b> maneuvers another broad category of clinical signs have been described called provocative maneuvers. These maneuvers are designed to reproduce or increase pain emanating within the sacroiliac joint.|$|E

The authors were influenced to carry out the research by observing the patients suffering from discopathy with frequent faulty positioning of lower limbs – genu valgum, which was accompanied by increased range of external hip joint rotation. The assumed thesis was that wrong <b>mobility</b> of hip <b>joints</b> is conducive to development of lumbosacral disc disorder. Methods. 73 people were subjected to the research among whom 36 had discopathy and were qualified for surgical treatment in Neurosurgery Clinic of 10 thMilitary Hospital in Bydgoszcz. The rest (control group- 37 people) did not have any lumbosacral disc disorders. Hip <b>joints</b> <b>mobility</b> was measured according to SFTR method. The range of mobility was mesured in all planes. Results. The relation between occurrence of discopathy in LS spine and increased values of <b>mobility</b> in hip <b>joints</b> was noted. The most substantial mobility differences between the research and control groups were related internal / external rotation. Conclusions. The developmnet of disorders in these segments of spine is influnced by biomechanical factors in pelvis and lower limbs. Confirmation of the results in a bigger-scale research may result in introduction of prophylaxis of disc disorders in people with hypermobility of hip joints even at their teen age...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{characterize}} the obesity effect on children knee and hip joint range of motion. A randomized controlled trial was performed with goniometry evaluation for hip flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, external and internal rotation, and knee flexion in fifty male children (20 obese and 30 non obese), with age ranging from 6 to 12 years old. The obesity effect was found to be non-uniform across the joint range of motion. In the obesity group, a statistically significant reduction in the range of motion of hip flexion and adduction, and knee flexion was observed; and also an increase in external rotation in the hip was observed. Conclusion: Obese and overweight children present alterations in hip and knee <b>joints</b> <b>mobility</b> when compared to eu-trophic children.

40|$|Introduction.  Tarsal {{coalition}} is congenital bony, cartilaginous, or fibrous fusion between tarsal bones. The most specific clinical feature {{of these patients}} is limitation of tarsal <b>joints</b> <b>mobility.</b> Foot mobility is evaluated using a few clinical tests-tip-toe test, Jack test, and manual evaluation of passive foot inversion/eversion. However, these tests do not have high rates of sensitivity and specificity, and cannot {{be used to make}} differential diagnosis among the different types of coalitions. Aims.  To improve the clinical diagnosis of calcaneonavicular coalitions. Materials and methods.  We present a new clinical test-evaluation of calcaneonavicular segment mobility. To evaluate this test, we studied a group of 100 children (155  feet), which included those with talocalcaneal coalitions (22  patients/ 30  feet), calcaneonavicular coalitions (28 patients/ 45 feet), and those without tarsal coalitions (50  patients/ 80 feet). Results.  The sensitivity of the test was 95. 6 %, and specificity was 93. 3 %. This test had good reproducibility, as evidenced by the inter-rater reliability coefficient of 0. 818. Conclusions.  The clinical test presented here can be used to identify patients with calcaneonavicular coalitions, which could not be identified using other clinical tests of foot mobilit...|$|R
