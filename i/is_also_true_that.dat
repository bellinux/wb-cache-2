In a 14 -state comparison, more generous subsidy policies (that is, greater investment and higher income thresholds) were associated with higher quality of care in nonprofit centers, but not in forprofit centers, perhaps because the latter had few subsidized children.

25|$|Metric {{spaces are}} paracompact Hausdorff spaces and hence normal (indeed they are {{perfectly}} normal).

25|$|Though Cavaignac, Pinet and Pierre-Arnaud Dartigoeyte {{were soon}} replaced, the new representatives such as Pierre-Anselm Garrau {{also tended to}} meddle in {{military}} decisions.

For the fall 1794 offensive, Moncey's army numbered 52,000 troops in 64 battalions and four cavalry regiments. During the winter, an epidemic killed 3,000 soldiers and many inhabitants in the occupied areas of Spain.|$|E
25|$|Although {{it is true}} that in most {{patients}} ophthalmopathy, goiter, and symptoms of thyrotoxicosis appear more or less coincidentally, it <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>true</b> <b>that</b> in certain cases eye signs may appear long before thyrotoxicosis is evident, or become worse when the thyrotoxicosis is subsiding or has been controlled by treatment. In approximately 20% of ophthalmopathy patients, ophthalmopathy appears before the onset of hyperthyroidism, in about 40% concurrently, and in about 20% in the six months after diagnosis. In the remainder, the eye disease first becomes apparent after treatment of the hyperthyroidism, more often in patients treated with radioiodine.|$|E

While population increase suggests that the number of speakers has grown, it <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>true</b> <b>that</b> the ban {{on the use of the}} language in Turkey was only lifted in 1991 and still exists in most official settings (including schools), and that many fewer ethnic Kurds live in the countryside where the language has traditionally been used. The number of speakers is clearly less than the 15 million or so persons who identify themselves as ethnic Kurds.|$|E

Interest in thermoelectrics laid dormant for almost 100 years and were primarily a laboratory curiosity.

25|$|From the gene's {{point of}} view, {{evolutionary}} success ultimately depends on {{leaving behind the}} maximum number of copies of itself in the population. Until 1964, it was generally believed that genes only achieved this by causing the individual to leave {{the maximum number of}} viable offspring. However, in 1964 W. D. Hamilton proved mathematically that, because close relatives of an organism share some identical genes, a gene can also increase its evolutionary success by promoting the reproduction and survival of these related or otherwise similar individuals. Hamilton concluded that this leads natural selection to favor organisms that would behave in ways that maximize their inclusive fitness. It <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>true</b> <b>that</b> natural selection favors behavior that maximizes personal fitness.|$|E
25|$|Initial {{reports were}} that the team's colours would be changed to red and white, but the Leafs were wearing white sweaters with a green maple leaf for their first game on February 17, 1927. On September 27, 1927, it was {{announced}} that the Leafs had changed their colour scheme to blue and white, which they have worn ever since. While the Leafs say that blue represents the Canadian skies and white represents snow, it <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>true</b> <b>that</b> top-level Toronto teams have worn blue since the Toronto Argonauts adopted blue as their primary colour in 1873. Another theory is that Smythe changed the colours as a nod to his high school alma mater, Upper Canada College, whose teams have worn blue and white since 1829 and the University of Toronto whose teams have also worn blue and were called the Varsity Blues.|$|E
25|$|Much about Canadian {{federalism}} has undoubtedly {{changed in}} the last fifteen years, although it <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>true</b> <b>that</b> much remains the same. The foundations of Canadian federalism were laid at the Quebec Conference of 1864. The Quebec Resolutions were a compromise between those who wanted sovereignty vested in the federal government and those who wanted it vested in the provinces. The compromise based the federation on the constitution of the British Empire, under which the legal sovereignty of imperial power was modified by the conventions of colonial responsible government, making colonies of settlement (such as those of British North America) self-governing in domestic affairs. A protracted political process ensued before the Quebec Resolutions became the British North America Act of 1867. This process was dominated by John A. Macdonald, who joined British officials in attempting to make the federation more centralized than that envisaged by the Resolutions.|$|E

When North America became a favored destination once again, many Swedish immigrants had already learned English at school as a compulsory subject. The loss of subscribers, coupled with escalating printing costs, sounded the death knell for hundreds of ethnic newspapers in North America.|$|R
