5|$|Business {{aviation}} {{has shown}} strong growth, although {{the numbers of}} aircraft on the UK register <b>have</b> <b>declined.</b> This reflects a shift away from turboprop aircraft towards foreign-registered business jets based in the UK, which {{are estimated to be}} growing in numbers. However, twin piston-engined aircraft numbers <b>have</b> <b>declined</b> significantly, reflecting pressures on the light air-taxi segment from increasingly flexible and cheaper scheduled services, and a more sophisticated corporate charter business. The amount of flight training conducted by UK schools has declined, largely at the hands of competition from foreign schools, which benefit from lower costs and better weather.|$|E

5|$|Angel sharks {{in general}} are highly {{threatened}} by commercial trawl fisheries due to their susceptibility to capture and low rate of reproduction, and angel shark species elsewhere are known to <b>have</b> <b>declined</b> markedly under fishing pressure. Trawling activity in the Yellow Sea {{and other parts of}} the northwestern Pacific is intense and, coupled with pollution, has had a serious impact on the local ecosystem. The Japanese angelshark population is suspected to <b>have</b> <b>declined</b> by up to 50% or more under these conditions, leading the species to be assessed as Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). It may benefit from a ban on trawling imposed in some areas by the Chinese government, though enforcement is inconsistent.|$|E

5|$|Murray cod populations <b>have</b> <b>declined</b> {{severely}} since European colonisation of Australia due to {{a number}} of causes, including severe overfishing, river regulation, and habitat degradation and are now a listed threatened species.

5|$|This {{species is}} valued by {{commercial}} and recreational fisheries throughout its range, and utilized as food. The species population size is unknown, but the ICUN's Red List assesses the species as Near Threatened {{because it is}} very susceptible to population depletion due to its low growth and reproductive rates and because its numbers are believed to <b>have</b> <b>declined</b> in some areas.|$|E
5|$|Although numbers <b>have</b> <b>declined</b> steeply {{in western}} Europe, this bird is classed as least concern on the IUCN Red List {{because of its}} huge range and large, {{apparently}} stable, populations in Russia and Kazakhstan. Numbers in western China are more significant than previously thought, and conservation measures have facilitated an increased population in some countries which had suffered the greatest losses. Despite its elusive nature, the loud call has ensured the corn crake has been noted in literature, and garnered a range of local and dialect names.|$|E

5|$|Because of its numbers, ubiquity, and {{association}} with human settlements, the house sparrow is culturally prominent. It is extensively, and usually unsuccessfully, persecuted as an agricultural pest. It has also often been kept as a pet, {{as well as}} being a food item and a symbol of lust, sexual potency, commonness, and vulgarity. Though it is widespread and abundant, its numbers <b>have</b> <b>declined</b> in some areas. The animal's conservation status is listed as least concern on the IUCN Red List.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{hazardous}} nature of lead(II) nitrate, {{there is a}} preference for using alternatives in industrial applications. In the formerly major application of lead paints, it has largely been replaced by titanium dioxide. Other historical applications of lead(II) nitrate, such as in matches and fireworks, <b>have</b> <b>declined</b> or ceased as well. Current applications of lead(II) nitrate include use as a heat stabiliser in nylon and polyesters, as a coating for photothermographic paper, and in rodenticides.|$|E

5|$|By {{the early}} 2000s, their {{population}} was feared to <b>have</b> <b>declined</b> {{past the point}} of recovery in Vietnam, with some conservationists estimating as few as three to eight rhinos, and possibly no males, survived. Conservationists debated whether or not the Vietnamese rhinoceros had any chance of survival, with some arguing that rhinos from Indonesia should be introduced in an attempt to save the population, with others arguing that the population could recover.|$|E
5|$|Egyptian vulture populations <b>have</b> <b>declined</b> in {{most parts}} of its range. In Europe and most of the Middle East, populations in 2001 were half of those from 1980. In India, the decline has been rapid with a 35% {{decrease}} each year since 1999. In 1967–70, the area around Delhi was estimated to have 12,000–15,000 of these vultures, with an average density of about 5 pairs per 10km2. The exact cause of the decline is not known, but has been linked {{with the use of the}} NSAID Diclofenac, which has been known to cause death in Gyps vultures.|$|E
5|$|For half of {{the year}} or longer, adults live in slow-flowing river margins, lakes, or ponds, where {{reproduction}} takes place. Males perform a courtship display, and females lay around 200 eggs individually onto leaves of aquatic plants. Larvae develop two to four months in the water before reaching metamorphosis. For the remainder of the year, the newts live in shady land habitats, usually forests. Although not yet considered threatened, Danube crested newt populations <b>have</b> <b>declined</b> significantly, the reason being mainly habitat loss. The species is protected by law in the European Union.|$|E
