40|$|Purpose The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{describe}} a methodological experiment designed to test the potential of an auto/biographical (Stanley, 1992) life history. Could it serve a purpose for which it was not originally intended? Specifically, I consider the extent to which a life history articulates with the literature on migration, even though it was not written for this purpose. Design/methodology/approach I consider this issue via a series of four narrative vignettes representing the story of this experiment. Findings I found that the life history does more than articulate with the migration literature on conceptual distinction. It also animates, supplements and interrogates theories therein about the utility and futility of making distinctions. In this respect the experiment has been a success. Research limitations/implications This paper has not explicitly engaged with the ethics and politics of employing life history <b>in</b> <b>ways</b> <b>for</b> <b>which</b> it was not intended.

The occurrence of several cascading failures in the past 40 years has helped focus attention on the need to understand the complex phenomena associated with these interconnected systems and to develop de-fense plans to protect the network against extreme contingencies caused by natural disasters, equipment failures, human errors, or deliberate sabotage and attacks. With dramatic increases in interregional bulk power transfers and accelerating diversity of transactions among parties, the elec-tric power grid is being used <b>in</b> <b>ways</b> <b>for</b> <b>which</b> it was not originally designed.

40|$|This essay {{begins with}} the {{proposition}} that the battle over the exercise of eminent domain as a question {{of the extent to which}} we accept local economic development as a proper exercise of local governmental authority. In light of the reality that economic development seeks to accomplish redevelopment to meet the social needs and consumption tastes of the affluent, the issue of local governments 2 ̆ 7 autonomy to engage in redevelopment for economic development purposes is suffused with socioeconomic class struggles over land use. Therefore, the changes wrought by redevelopment challenge us to think and talk about class <b>in</b> <b>ways</b> <b>for</b> <b>which</b> we are inadequately prepared. The class issue is possibly most difficult to acknowledge in the redevelopment context because class permeates the existing system of property ownership and land regulation. As a first step in addressing the inherent conflicts surrounding class in the issue of redevelopment, this essay delineates a typology of four dimensions of class as it affects, interrelates, and operates with land use law and argues that the dimensions illustrate points of tension that must be considered and resolved in formulating redevelopment practices...|$|E

For instance, when flight control has been lost due to damage to the hydraulic systems, pilots have had to use engine thrust to maneuver the plane {{to the ground and}} in for a landing. To assist the pilot in these situations, research is being performed to enhance the engine operation by making it more responsive or able to generate more thrust. Enabled by modification of the propulsion control, enhanced engine operation can increase the probability of a safe landing during an inflight emergency. However, enhanced engine operation introduces risk as the nominal control limits, such as those on shaft speed, temperature, and acceleration, are exceeded. Therefore, an on-line tool for quantifying this risk must be developed to ensure that the use of an enhanced control mode does not actually increase the overall danger to the aircraft. This paper describes an architecture for the implementation of this tool. It describes the type of data and algorithms required and the information flow, and how the risk based on engine component lifing and operability for enhanced operation is determined...|$|E

Freud ([1930] 1962) echoed a common teleological fantasy of the prom-ises of prostheses by pronouncing: With every tool man is perfecting his own organs, whether motor or sensory, or is removing the limits to their functioning [...] Man has, as it were, become a prosthetic god. When he puts on all his auxiliary organs he is truly magnificent: but those organs have not grown on him and they still give him much trouble at times. (p. 42) Freud’s hesitant caveat surely referred to his own prosthesis, a palate replac-ing an original that was removed as a result of throat cancer in 1923. His pros-thesis, without which he could neither speak nor eat, caused him immense pain.

40|$|Just as an {{audience}} can critically view the synthesised structure of any performance, evaluating the component elements which create meaning, so too each performing body in itself reflects nuances of embodied cultural meanings. Merleau Ponty’s phenomenology (1962; 1965; 1968) argues that human consciousness is ‘caught up’ in {{the ambiguity of}} the corporeal body so that any human body is both materially {{of the world that}} at the same time it is consciously directed towards (Merleau-Ponty 1962, p. 146). The body that is in action is already immersed in a subjective reality of its own and others making. For the actor, the negotiations between intentionality and viewed action are a daily consideration. These interactions between any body/subject and her lifeworld are partly visible for others to see. Yet the immersion in a lifeworld and the commitment to it mask reflection most particularly from those enacting it.

40|$|In the {{following}} paper I {{will examine the}} possibility for a rational foundation of morals, rational {{in the sense that}} to ground a moral statement on reason amounts to being able to convince an unmotivated agent to conform to a moral rule - that is to say, to “rationally motivate” him (as Habermas would have said) to act <b>in</b> <b>ways</b> <b>for</b> <b>which</b> he or she had no previous reason to act. We will scrutinize the “internalist’s” objection (in Williams’ definition) to such a claim and confront it with a, however, obvious fact: our need to convince or, at least, to influence agents to act according to moral judgements that entail strong validity claims. Therefore we need to find a better ground for our moral norms than that provided by a narrow concept of practical reason, which ultimately offers the basis for the internalist’s intuitions. Classical philosophers believed that to have a “right” sense meant also to think accordingly, that there was no intelligence without a social or moral side and that a person who lacked moral sense was not, at the same time, very intelligent. This contradicts some deep Humean intuitions, and in any case requires a more complex concept of practical reason than the one we normally encounter in internalist moral philosophers. In {{the following}} pages, I would like to reflect on this kind of social reason, or intelligence, or moral rationality, in an attempt to couple, in a coherent vision of moral sense within the framework of practical reason, intuitions that appear in Kant and Adam Smith with empirical research about what the lack of moral sense could mean...|$|E

Throughout the world, assessment of research has become increasingly important, and at the same time, of great concern. No doubt, academic achievement, research, and teaching all need to be evaluated in order to guarantee and maintain quality. Comparisons are necessary to define best practices and to set standards. Scholars judge other scholars when they referee articles, write letters of reference, or participate in regular evaluations. Administrators rate scholars when they decide about salaries or promotion. Librarians rank journals or books when they decide on which to spend their budgets. And politicians assess institutions based on many factors, including research output. Making judgment is hard work. Everybody making judgments would like to be supported by measures that objectively describe “performance ” and help to compare and rank whatever is being judged. There is growing concern about various measures of research performance, especially those using citation data (for example, the “ISI impact factor”). Many of these measures are used <b>in</b> <b>ways</b> <b>for</b> <b>which</b> they were not designed and to make judgments that are unjustified by the data.

Modern infrastructures cope with new types of emerging risks, due {{to a variety of}} threats/hazards such as natural disasters, malicious attacks, technical failures etc. Factors that have transformed the way how infrastructures are designed, developed, operated and de-commissioned relate to liberalization of markets. the interdependency among infrastructures, the increase of cross-border interconnections, changes in ICT, the manifestation of systemic risks. The present paper addresses an European view of critical infrastructures development by adopting risks and vulnerabilities performance within an all hazard approach practical construct. The presentation and the risk assessment landscape are fully articulated within the current legislative framework established by the European Commission and other appropriate legislative bodies. New entities such as European Critical Infrastructures (ECI) are described and documented in view of their protection. A number of principles are highlighted such as subsidiarity, complementary, confidentiality, stakeholder cooperation, proportionality, the advent of the concept of system of systems. A detailed investigation in view of the evolution of risk is made for Critical Electricity Infrastructures.
