5|$|In Pittsburgh, Leonard Betts (Paul McCrane), an EMT paramedic, is decapitated {{when his}} {{ambulance}} collides with a truck. Later, at the morgue, his headless body leaves its cold chamber, knocks out the attendant, steals his clothes, and escapes. Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) visit the morgue, where they find Betts's {{head in a}} medical waste dumpster. Scully attempts a cranial examination, but the head's <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> <b>mouth</b> both suddenly open when she begins the procedure. Meanwhile, Mulder goes to Betts's apartment, where he finds the attendant's discarded clothes. When Mulder leaves, Betts—who has regrown his head—rises out of his iodine-filled bathtub.|$|E
5|$|The Klingons {{received}} {{the first major}} revision in design since their appearance in The Motion Picture. Dodie Shepard designed new red and black uniforms for Chancellor Gorkon and his staff, as it was judged {{that it would be}} unseemly for the chancellor to wear common warrior garb. Another concern was that there was not enough of designer Robert Fletcher's The Motion Picture uniforms for all the Klingons in the film. While the important Klingons were given multi-layered prosthetics and unique head ridges, background characters wore ready-made masks, with minor touch-ups on the <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> <b>mouth.</b> Since it was important for the actors' expressions to be visible through the makeup, the appliances were made thin using the latest glues and paints. Transforming an actor into a Klingon took three and a half hours. Hairstylist Jan Alexander designed braids and jewelry that suggested a tribal people with a long and treasured heritage.|$|E
5|$|A large {{quantity}} of funerary urns have been excavated from {{the bases of}} buildings; the deceased were cremated and their ashes collected in the urns. The sides of the urns were perforated with three holes, perhaps to represent the <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> <b>mouth</b> of the deceased. The urns were decorated with polychrome motifs {{in the form of}} highly stylised serpent decorations painted in black, red and cream; this style of Maya ceramics has been labelled as Chinautla Polychrome after the site where it was first identified. The Postclassic Maya custom of interring the cremated remains of the deceased in urns was restricted to the elite; commoners where buried in simple tombs outside the city centre. In Jilotepeque Viejo urns were usually buried under the front of platform bases or under the sides of pyramids and altars. This was not a general practice among the highland Maya in the Postclassic and represents a tradition unique to the city. Funerary urns have been found interred under all the principal plazas of the city. Approximately equal proportions of urns were interred under platforms and under the ceremonial architecture represented by pyramids and altars, although it is impossible to say if those individuals buried under religious architecture had differing roles than those buried under secular architecture.|$|E
40|$|Automatic {{extraction}} of facial feature points {{is one of}} the main problems for semantic coding of videophone sequences at very low bit rates. In this contribution, an approach for estimation of the <b>eye</b> <b>and</b> <b>mouth</b> corner point positions is presented. For this proposition, the location informations of the face model are exploited to define search areas for estimation of the <b>eye</b> <b>and</b> <b>mouth</b> corner point positions. Then, the <b>eye</b> <b>and</b> <b>mouth</b> corner point positions are estimated based on a template matching technique with <b>eye</b> <b>and</b> <b>mouth</b> corner templates. Finally, in order to verify these estimated corner point positions, some geometric conditions between the corner point positions and the center point positions of the <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> the <b>mouth</b> are exploited. The proposed algorithm has been applied to test sequences Claire and Miss America with a spatial resolution corresponding to CIF and a frame rate of 10 Hz.

25|$|Eyes: The eye can be {{directly}} affected {{in the form of}} episcleritis or scleritis, which when severe can very rarely progress to perforating scleromalacia. Rather more common is the indirect effect of keratoconjunctivitis sicca, which is a dryness of <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> <b>mouth</b> caused by lymphocyte infiltration of lacrimal and salivary glands. When severe, dryness of the cornea can lead to keratitis and loss of vision. Preventive treatment of severe dryness with measures such as nasolacrimal duct blockage is important.|$|E

The only other surviving victim was Katie Starks, but she never saw her assailant. Since Hollis and Larey were the only survivors to give a description, it cannot be known if the killer wore a mask during the other attacks.|$|E
25|$|SS {{can damage}} vital organs {{of the body}} with {{symptoms}} that may plateau or worsen, or go into remission as with other autoimmune diseases. Some people may experience only the mild symptoms of dry <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> <b>mouth,</b> while others have symptoms of severe disease. Many patients can treat problems symptomatically. Others are forced to cope with blurred vision, constant eye discomfort, recurrent mouth infections, swollen parotid glands, dysphonia (vocal disorders including hoarseness), and difficulty in swallowing and eating. Debilitating fatigue and joint pain can seriously impair quality of life. Some patients can develop renal (kidney) involvement (autoimmune tubulointerstitial nephritis) leading to proteinuria (excess protein in urine), urinary concentrating defect, and distal renal tubular acidosis.|$|E
25|$|Anatomical {{barriers}} include physical, {{chemical and}} biological barriers. The epithelial surfaces form a physical barrier that is impermeable to most infectious agents, acting as {{the first line of}} defense against invading organisms. Desquamation (shedding) of skin epithelium also helps remove bacteria and other infectious agents that have adhered to the epithelial surfaces. Lack of blood vessels and inability of the epidermis to retain moisture, presence of sebaceous glands in the dermis provides an environment unsuitable for the survival of microbes. In the gastrointestinal and respiratory tract, movement due to peristalsis or cilia, respectively, helps remove infectious agents. Also, mucus traps infectious agents. The gut flora can prevent the colonization of pathogenic bacteria by secreting toxic substances or by competing with pathogenic bacteria for nutrients or attachment to cell surfaces. The flushing action of tears and saliva helps prevent infection of the <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> <b>mouth.</b>|$|E

Tenfold cross-validation testing was performed for six and seven classes of emotion on the CK+ dataset.

500|$|Captain Davy Jones had {{originally}} been designed with chin growths, before the designers made the move to full-blown tentacles; {{the skin of the}} character incorporates the texture of a coffee-stained Styrofoam cup among other elements. To portray Jones on set, Bill Nighy wore a motion capture tracksuit that meant the animators at Industrial Light & Magic did not have to reshoot the scene in the studio without him or on the motion capture stage. Nighy wore make-up around his <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> <b>mouth</b> to splice into the computer-generated shots, but the images of his <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> <b>mouth</b> were not used. Nighy only wore a prosthetic once, with blue-colored tentacles for when Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) steals the key to the Dead Man's Chest from under his [...] "beard" [...] as he sleeps. To create the CG version of the character, the model was closely based on a full-body scan of Nighy, with Jones reflecting his high cheekbones. Animators studied every frame of Nighy's performance: the actor himself had blessed them by making his performance more quirky than expected, providing endless fun for them. His performance also meant new controls had to be stored. Finally, Jones' tentacles are mostly a simulation, though at times they were hand-animated when they act as limbs for the character.|$|E

In addition, black strips of cloth wrapped around his forearms, hands, and head, leaving his <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> <b>mouth</b> exposed. The design was later reused as his primary outfit in , with his appearance from Deadly Alliance serving as his secondary outfit.|$|E

500|$|The {{physical}} effects {{used to create}} the deformed child have been kept secret. The projectionist {{who worked on the}} film's dailies was blindfolded by Lynch to avoid revealing the prop's nature, and he has refused to discuss the effects in subsequent interviews. The prop—which Nance nicknamed [...] "Spike"—featured several working parts; its neck, <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> <b>mouth</b> were capable of independent operation. Lynch has offered cryptic comments on the prop, at times stating that [...] "it was born nearby" [...] or [...] "maybe it was found". It has been speculated by The Guardian John Patterson that the prop may have been constructed from a skinned rabbit or a lamb fetus. The child has been seen as a precursor to elements of other Lynch films, such as John Merrick's make-up in 1980's The Elephant Man and the sandworms of 1984's Dune.|$|E
500|$|Cope was {{described}} by zoologist Henry Weed Fowler as [...] "a man of medium height and build, but always impressive with his great energy and activity". To him, Fowler wrote, [...] " [...] was both genial and always interesting, easily approachable, and both kindly and helpful." [...] Cope's affability during visits to the Academy of Natural Sciences to compare specimens was later recalled by his colleague Witmer Stone: [...] "I have often seen him busily engaged in such comparisons, all the while whistling whole passages from grand opera, or else counting the scales {{on the back of}} a lizard, while he conversed in a most amusing manner with some small street urchin who had drifted into the museum and was watching in awe with <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> <b>mouth</b> wide open." [...] His self-taught nature, however, meant that he was largely hostile to bureaucracy and politics. He had a famous temper; one friend called Cope a [...] "militant paleontologist". Despite his faults, he was generally well liked by his contemporaries. American paleontologist Alfred Romer wrote that, [...] " [...] little slips from virtue were those we might make ourselves, were we bolder".|$|E
