5|$|Ecological {{evolutionary}} <b>developmental</b> biology (eco-evo-devo) integrates {{research from}} <b>developmental</b> biology and ecology {{to examine their}} relationship with evolutionary theory. Researchers study concepts and mechanisms such as <b>developmental</b> plasticity, epigenetic inheritance, genetic assimilation, niche construction and symbiosis.|$|E
5|$|Evolutionary <b>developmental</b> biology (informally, evo-devo) is a {{field of}} {{biological}} research that compares the <b>developmental</b> processes of different organisms to infer the ancestral relationships between them and how <b>developmental</b> processes evolved.|$|E
5|$|An area {{of current}} {{investigation}} in evolutionary <b>developmental</b> biology is the <b>developmental</b> basis of adaptations and exaptations. This research addresses {{the origin and}} evolution of embryonic development and how modifications of development and <b>developmental</b> processes produce novel features. These {{studies have shown that}} evolution can alter development to produce new structures, such as embryonic bone structures that develop into the jaw in other animals instead forming part of the middle ear in mammals. It is also possible for structures that have been lost in evolution to reappear due to changes in <b>developmental</b> genes, such as a mutation in chickens causing embryos to grow teeth similar to those of crocodiles. It is now becoming clear that most alterations in the form of organisms are due to changes in a small set of conserved genes.|$|E
5|$|<b>Developmental</b> verbal dyspraxia, {{also known}} as Childhood apraxia of speech, is a <b>developmental</b> motor speech {{disorder}} involving impairments in the motor control of speech production. The speech {{of a child with}} <b>developmental</b> verbal dyspraxia may be unintelligible to the point that daily communication needs cannot be met. A child with <b>developmental</b> verbal dyspraxia often experiences great amounts of frustration, so AAC can be a strategy to support communication alongside more traditional speech therapy to improve speech production.|$|E
5|$|Gould made {{significant}} contributions to evolutionary <b>developmental</b> biology, especially in his work Ontogeny and Phylogeny. In this book he emphasized the process of heterochrony, which encompasses two distinct processes: neoteny and terminal additions. Neoteny is the process where ontogeny is slowed down and the organism does not reach the end of its development. Terminal addition is the process by which an organism adds to its development by speeding and shortening earlier stages in the <b>developmental</b> process. Gould's influence in the field of evolutionary <b>developmental</b> biology continues to be seen today in areas such as the evolution of feathers.|$|E
5|$|On 8 April 2013 it was {{reported}} that Quin had signed a two-year <b>developmental</b> deal with WWE and had moved to Florida to report to their <b>developmental</b> territory NXT. On 29 August, Quin's new ring name was revealed as Becky Lynch, and she debuted at an NXT live event in November.|$|E
5|$|Tooth {{abnormalities}} may {{be categorized}} {{according to whether}} they have environmental or <b>developmental</b> causes. While environmental abnormalities may appear to have an obvious cause, there may {{not appear to be}} any known cause for some <b>developmental</b> abnormalities. Environmental forces may affect teeth during development, destroy tooth structure after development, discolor teeth at any stage of development, or alter the course of tooth eruption. <b>Developmental</b> abnormalities most commonly affect the number, size, shape, and structure of teeth.|$|E
5|$|After {{being trained}} by Chris Youngblood and Harley Race's Wrestling Academy, DiBiase made his {{professional}} wrestling debut in 2006. He won the Fusion Pro Tag Team Championship {{with his brother}} Mike DiBiase in February 2007, and also toured Japan with Pro Wrestling Noah. He signed a <b>developmental</b> contract with WWE in July 2007, and was assigned to their <b>developmental</b> facility, Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW), where he won the FCW Southern Heavyweight Championship in December 2007. Due to injury, he relinquished the championship in January 2008.|$|E
5|$|An {{adaptive}} trait is {{an aspect}} of the <b>developmental</b> pattern of the organism which enables or enhances the probability of that organism surviving and reproducing.|$|E
5|$|Before {{working for}} WWE, Anderson {{wrestled}} for numerous promotions, winning various singles and tag team championships. Upon signing with WWE, Anderson {{was assigned to}} the company's <b>developmental</b> territory Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW) in Louisville, Kentucky in 2005.|$|E
5|$|Deficiency in SP-A {{levels is}} {{associated}} with infant respiratory distress syndrome in prematurely born infants with <b>developmental</b> insufficiency of surfactant production and structural immaturity in the lungs.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{losing the}} Tough Enough contest, Mizanin had piqued the {{interest}} of WWE, and he was eventually offered a <b>developmental</b> contract.|$|E
5|$|Evolutionary {{biology is}} partly based on paleontology, which uses {{the fossil record}} to answer {{questions}} about the mode and tempo of evolution, and partly on the developments in areas such as population genetics. In the 1980s, <b>developmental</b> biology re-entered evolutionary biology after its initial exclusion from the modern synthesis through the study of evolutionary <b>developmental</b> biology. Phylogenetics, systematics, and taxonomy are related fields often considered part of evolutionary biology.|$|E
5|$|In Europe, {{a cohort}} study of 467,450 Danish {{children}} found no association between TCVs and autism or autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), nor any dose-response relationship between thiomersal and ASDs {{that would be}} suggestive of toxic exposure. An ecological analysis that studied 956 Danish children diagnosed with autism likewise did not show an association between autism and thiomersal. A retrospective cohort study on 109,863 children in the United Kingdom found no association between TCVs and autism, but a possible increased risk for tics. Analysis in this study also showed a possible protective effect with respect to general <b>developmental</b> disorders, attention-deficit disorder, and otherwise unspecified <b>developmental</b> delay. Another UK study based on a prospective cohort of 13,617 children likewise found more associated benefits than risks from thiomersal exposure with respect to <b>developmental</b> disorders. Because the Danish and UK studies involved only diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) or diphtheria-tetanus (DT) vaccines, they are less relevant for the higher thiomersal exposure levels {{that occurred in the}} U.S.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to longitudinal studies, {{there has been}} psychophysiological research on the biology of attachment. Research has begun to include neural development, behaviour genetics and temperament concepts. Generally, temperament and attachment constitute separate <b>developmental</b> domains, but aspects of both contribute {{to a range of}} interpersonal and intrapersonal <b>developmental</b> outcomes. Some types of temperament may make some individuals susceptible to the stress of unpredictable or hostile relationships with caregivers in the early years. In the absence of available and responsive caregivers it appears that some children are particularly vulnerable to developing attachment disorders.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, {{there was}} no state land {{adjoining}} the Church. It {{was surrounded by a}} low density housing area and thus did not provide the same <b>developmental</b> potential as the temple property.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{rehabilitate}} his injury, he began training at Florida Championship Wrestling, WWE's <b>developmental</b> territory. He later began working {{there as a}} trainer. Following this, he moved into a producer role for the main roster.|$|E
5|$|NXT Arrival (stylized as NXT arRIVAL) was a {{professional}} wrestling event produced by WWE, featuring their <b>developmental</b> branch NXT, that took place on February 27, 2014 at Full Sail University in Winter Park, Florida.|$|E
5|$|One {{criticism}} of Piaget's {{theory is that}} culture and education exert stronger influences on a child's development than Piaget maintained. These factors depend on how much practice their culture provides in <b>developmental</b> processes, such as conversational skills.|$|E
5|$|Pollock {{was born}} on 11 May 1977 in Liverpool, England with spina bifida, a <b>developmental</b> {{congenital}} disorder caused by the incomplete closing of the embryonic neural tube. He currently lives in Wigan, Greater Manchester in north west England.|$|E
5|$|Recent work in <b>developmental</b> biology has {{identified}} dynamical and physical mechanisms of tissue morphogenesis that may underlie abrupt morphological transitions during evolution. Consequently, consideration of mechanisms of phylogenetic change {{that have been}} found in reality to be non-gradual is increasingly common in the field of evolutionary <b>developmental</b> biology, particularly in studies of the origin of morphological novelty. A description of such mechanisms {{can be found in the}} multi-authored volume Origination of Organismal Form (MIT Press; 2003).|$|E
5|$|The P. rebeli <b>developmental</b> rate shows great {{phenotypic}} plasticity (changing its <b>developmental</b> rate {{in response to}} changes in the environment), as it develops very quickly in the lab and in the Pyrenees and Southern Alps. Scientists hypothesize that this plasticity is due to warm conditions and more light exposure, which affects larval development. Abundant food resources are also thought to play a part in quickened development.|$|E

25|$|Work on cloning {{techniques}} {{has advanced}} our {{basic understanding of}} <b>developmental</b> biology in humans. Observing human pluripotent stem cells grown in culture provides great insight into human embryo development, which otherwise cannot be seen. Scientists {{are now able to}} better define steps of early human development. Studying signal transduction along with genetic manipulation within the early human embryo has the potential to provide answers to many <b>developmental</b> diseases and defects. Many human-specific signaling pathways have been discovered by studying human embryonic stem cells. Studying <b>developmental</b> pathways in humans has given <b>developmental</b> biologists more evidence toward the hypothesis that <b>developmental</b> pathways are conserved throughout species.|$|E
25|$|In December 2006, Miller {{signed a}} <b>developmental</b> {{contract}} with World Wrestling Entertainment and {{was assigned to}} Deep South Wrestling (DSW), a WWE <b>developmental</b> territory.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{show that}} {{bedwetting}} {{children are more}} likely to have behavioral problems. For children who have <b>developmental</b> problems, the behavioral problems and the bedwetting are frequently part of/caused by the <b>developmental</b> issues. For bedwetting children without other <b>developmental</b> issues, these behavioral issues can result from self-esteem issues and stress caused by the wetting.|$|E
25|$|Within <b>developmental</b> robotics, <b>developmental</b> {{learning}} {{approaches are}} elaborated upon to allow robots to accumulate repertoires of novel skills through autonomous self-exploration, social interaction with human teachers, {{and the use}} of guidance mechanisms (active learning, maturation, motor synergies, etc.).|$|E
25|$|Youth {{empowerment}} programs {{thrive in}} positive <b>developmental</b> settings. Positive <b>developmental</b> settings promote youth competence, confidence and connections. Two {{features of the}} positive <b>developmental</b> youth settings are supportive relationships and support for efficacy and mattering. Supportive relationships {{are those that are}} between youth and non-familial adults that foster trust and respect. Support for efficacy and mattering specifically focuses on youth being active, instrumental agents of change in their communities, collective decision-making and adults listen to and respect their voice.|$|E
25|$|Deep {{dyslexia}} {{is usually}} classified as an acquired reading disorder, {{as opposed to}} a <b>developmental</b> dyslexia, in previously literate adults as a consequence of a brain injury. However, recently, <b>developmental</b> deep dyslexia has also been reported in children with Williams syndrome.|$|E
25|$|<b>Developmental</b> disabilities affect between 1 and 2% of the {{population}} in most western countries, although many government sources acknowledge that statistics are flawed in this area. The worldwide proportion of people with <b>developmental</b> disabilities is believed to be approximately 1.4%. It is twice as common in males as in females, and some researchers have found that the prevalence of mild <b>developmental</b> disabilities is likely to be higher in areas of poverty and deprivation, and among people of certain ethnicities.|$|E
25|$|There are {{multiple}} ways of considering {{the cause of}} directional selection on this set of foraging behaviors in honey bees. A proximate factor {{is one that is}} <b>developmental</b> and influential on behavior within the lifetime of an organism. Neurological and <b>developmental</b> differences lead to directional selection and changes in the set of foraging behaviors between generations of honey bees. Levels of stress as measured by levels of octopamine is one such contributing <b>developmental</b> factor.|$|E
25|$|When Wakefield and {{his colleagues}} first {{reported}} in 1998 a possible association between autistic regression, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and MMR vaccines in the Lancet, they evaluated a dozen children with pervasive <b>developmental</b> disorders, apparent <b>developmental</b> regression, and intestinal symptoms, referred to the Royal Free Hospital.|$|E
25|$|Civitan {{continues}} {{to focus on}} assisting those with <b>developmental</b> disabilities. In 1990, the Civitan International Research Center was established {{on the campus of}} the University of Alabama at Birmingham with a $20,000,000 grant from the Civitan International Foundation. The Civitan International Research Center was the first institution of its kind in the United States to be focused solely on the research of <b>developmental</b> disabilities. Medical professionals from all over the world also come to the center for training on <b>developmental</b> disabilities.|$|E
25|$|By {{knowing what}} <b>developmental</b> stages and tasks {{children}} follow, treatment and interventions for FAS can {{be tailored to}} helping a person meet <b>developmental</b> tasks and demands successfully. If a person is delayed in the adaptive behavior domain, for instance, then interventions would be recommended to target specific delays through additional education and practice (e.g., practiced instruction on tying shoelaces), giving reminders, or making accommodations (e.g., using slip-on shoes) to support the desired functioning level. This approach is an advance over behavioral interventions, because it takes the person's <b>developmental</b> context into account while developing interventions.|$|E
