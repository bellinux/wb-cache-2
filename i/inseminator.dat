5000|$|The ritualized [...] "homosexuality" [...] as {{the rite}} of passage from boy to adult men has been {{recorded}} being practiced among Melanesian people of New Guinea, such as the Sambia and Etoro people of Papua New Guinea. On Indonesian side of New Guinea, similar rituals has been recorded practiced among Kimam people, Southern Papua province, Indonesia. Some record report similar practice among other tribes. The practice is age-structured and directed toward young boys as {{the rite of}} passage. According to their belief, a boy is contaminated with female elements through breast feeding and contacts {{with his mother and}} female family members. To avoid further female contamination, after certain age, young boys were taken from their mothers and lived separately in communal house with other boys and unmarried men. The separate boys boarding house was to provide male bonding among tribesmen as well to prepare the young boys to be a proper warrior. To be properly developed as a masculine man, thus a brave warrior, a young boy must ingest semen that regarded as male essence. The ingestion itself could be in form of fellatio or homosexual anal intercourse. The <b>inseminator</b> is the older member of the tribes, usually their uncle, the father or older brother of the boy's future wife. The ritual ceased when the boy reach adulthood, when he began to develop beard and get married.|$|E

40|$|A {{socio-economic}} {{survey was conducted}} in three districts;- Kirinyaga, Rachuonyo and Nakuru within the Kenya highlands in February to May 2004. The objective {{of the study was}} to assess demand for breeding services of smallholder dairy farmers. The major constraints experienced by the respondents in this study were lack of adequate improved breeding facilities and the relatively high prices charged by the <b>inseminators</b> for the local and imported semen. Other constraints included the long distance to <b>inseminators</b> and service centres. Cost and availability of AI services were rated as major constraints by 51 % and 47 % respectively of the respondents. If resource-poor households are to continue to benefit from dairy production, a better understanding is required of the population, herd structures and dynamics in the smallholder sub-sector including the breeding (reproductive management and replacement) strategies of the smallholders. The majority of the smallholder dairy farms has few hectares and rear a small herd of less than ten heads of cattle. This calls for the need to intensify the farming system so as to obtain maximum yields. Before liberalization, the government of Kenya was solely involved in the management of Artificial Insemination (AI) services. However operational inefficiencies and budgetary constraints undermined service provision and AI services began to decline. In 1992, the sector was liberalized and the private sector stepped in to boost the AI service provision. However, with continued government involvement, tne - private sectors' performance has shown a downward trend in the past decade that needs to be studied to suggest policy recommendations. Investigations into what factors smallholder farmers put into consideration when choosing breeding bulls were also carried out.

Only a small number of dairy farmers makes use of Al, while conception rates are low. The results clearly indicate that heat detection is a major problem, leading to long calving intervals. The kind (breed) of semen used does not influence conception rates. On the other hand, the technical skills of the <b>inseminators</b> involved do influence conception rates. So does the ethnie origin of the farmers involved, although this parameter is closely linked to the scale of the farms and the management level. At first sight, it would seem that decentralisation had a positive effect on technical results. Due to an increase in the number of inseminations performed, the number of Al-calves born increased substantially. Technical results however were inferior to those prior to decentralisation...|$|R
40|$|Summary &mdash; The syringe guide {{consists}} of a long thick wire rod fixed to the syringe holder. This rod allows an <b>inseminator</b> to make all syringe-tip movements by moving the guide with his left hand. The right hand is then free to insert the syringe-tip and semen into the vagina, without the inconvenience of removing the hand from the syringe. The guide enables queens to be inseminated more quickly and with less discomfort. Construction of the guide is simple and economical. Apis mellifera / instrumental insemination / apparatu...|$|E
40|$|Anestrus {{is one of}} {{indirect}} clinical signs of cattle pregnancy. Based on the present of sufficient progesterone on the blood, the cattle with pregnancy condition will not show the signs of estrus. The success of artificial insemination (AI) is the occurrence of fertilization followed by pregnancy and parturition. This involves a complex relationship between semen quality and oocytes, estrus detection, AI punctuality, <b>inseminator</b> and farmers ability. Artificial insemination should be performed at the relative optimum time to ovulation. Estrus detection {{is an important factor}} to determine the time of AI. Estrus Detection of Bali cattles of the farmer is often difficult observed or not observed, especially in semi-intensive system maintenance. From this review {{it can be seen that}} there is the different proportion of inseminators on the incidence of estrus after AI. However, determination of the role of <b>inseminator</b> on the success of AI and then the other factors that affect the success of the AI should be under ideal conditions. Straw from the different bulls breed gave the same of AI result. The estimate of pregnancy rate of 80 cows after AI is 55 %. Estrus detection on 21 st days after AI can be used as a detection method for early diagnosis of pregnancy, especially for the farmers who did not have any ability or authority to perform medical acts of reproduction which is only owned by a veterinarian. Observation, recording and evaluation of the implementation of the AI should be made until the end of pregnancy followed by the process of parturition...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the conception rate (CR) of multiparous Nelore cows presenting different body condition scores (BCS), which were submitted to the same Timed-AI protocol with equine chorionic gonadotrophin (eCG). A total of 1574 cows were inseminated, between 40 and 50 days postpartum. During insemination (timed-AI), all data regarding to bull (n= 8), <b>inseminator</b> (n= 3) and BCS (1 to 5) were recorded. The pregnancy diagnosis was performed, by ultrasonography, 40 days after timed-AI. No effect (P> 0. 05) of <b>inseminator</b> or bull was observed. No statistical difference was also observed between the groups of animals with different BCS. The animals with lower BCS (Group 1 = BCS 1. 5 to 2. 0; n = 139) had a CR of 47. 4 %. The animals with BCS from 2. 5 to 2. 75 (Group 2; n = 741) and BCS from 3. 0 to 3. 25 (Group 3; n = 463) had a CR of 47. 6 % and 51. 2 %, respectively. The animals with higher BCS (Group 4 = BCS 3. 5 to 4. 0; n = 231) had a CR of 45. 3 % (P > 0. 05). It was concluded that conception rates were similar between the animals presenting different BCS in the herd, likely because the eCG minimized the effects of low LH pulsatility in animals presenting reduced nutritional condition. However, other studies are recommended to verify the real need of using eCG in animals with body condition exceeding 3. 5...|$|E
40|$|Reproductive {{problems}} among dairy animals {{are one of}} the major causes of loss in dairy sector. These problems can be tackled by imparting appropriate knowledge to the livestock owners. An attempt was made to measure the knowledge of livestock owners by developing a knowledge test on reproductive problems of dairy animals. The study was undertaken in Karnal district of Haryana state, India. Data were solicited from 300 livestock farmers who had at least one milch animal at the time of investigation. In addition to developing schedules for socio-economic variables, a knowledge test was also developed for measuring knowledge construct. Data were solicited on scientific treatment of affected dairy animals and 59. 54 % knowledge was observed on reproductive traits. Study indicates that majority of livestock farmers adopted scientific methods for treating their animals. Respondents’ age, extension contact and milk production were positively and significantly correlated with knowledge. Therefore, imparting quality practical training and periodical assessment of performance of lay <b>inseminators</b> for improving their skills and knowledge regarding estrus detection and insemination needs to be emphasized. Extension machinery has to be an ideal bridge between research/development institutions and dairy farmers for their catalytic effect (Meena & Malik, 2009). Extensive awareness programs are needed for inculcating scientific outlook among livestock farmers on these complex problems. Easy accessibility of veterinary hospital at village level can reduce the adoption of indigenous technical knowledge in treatment of these complex problems. </p...|$|R
40|$|This study {{sought to}} determine: (a) the {{essential}} elements of a viable artificial insemination program for the Fulani Tribesmen in Kaduna State, Nigeria, and (b) {{to determine if the}} essential elements of a viable artificial insemination program exist in Kaduna State, Nigeria. This study was conducted from April 15 to May 15, 1985, in the Artificial Insemination (AI) Subcenters of Zaria, Katsina, Kabomo, Kaduna, Ikara, Zonkwa, Kurmin-Biri, and Kauranjuli. The data presented in this study were collected by personal interviews with Fulani Tribesmen. The population of this study was from a partial list of Fulani Tribesmen who have had AI performed on their dairy cattle by the cooperative <b>inseminators</b> in the subcenters. The statistical analysis showed an overview of herdsmen reactions to each question. The use of additional statistical tests to determine the degree of significance was not appropriate because the respondents were not randomly selected. The writer did not know in advance the number of Fulani Tribesmen that constituted the total population of the AI system in the subcenters. Noneconomic analysis of this research study includes five linked essential elements of a viable AI program. These elements are: (1) high performance bulls with quality semen, (2) skilled dependable AI technicians, (3) healthy cows, (4) functional communication and transportation resources, and (5) cooperative and informed farmers. This study concluded that four of the five essential elements for a viable AI program currently do not exist for the Fulani Tribesmen in Kaduna State, Nigeria. As a result of this study, it was determined a viable AI program for the Fulani Tribesmen in Kaduna State, Nigeria, is not feasible under the present situation...|$|R
40|$|Sex {{allocation}} {{and sexual}} selection have been heavily studied, but rarely linked. In this thesis I investigated {{the interface between}} them in the gregarious parasitoid wasp Nasonia vitripennis, both directly and through their interactions with the mating system and sexual conflict. Chapter 2 investigated sexual selection and mating at the natal site: earlier eclosing males mated more females independently of body size. Nasonia follows Local Mate Competition, which describes how a female laying eggs alone {{on a patch of}} resources (a so-called single-foundress) should lay an extremely female-biased brood to minimise competition between her sons, yet ensure all her daughters are fertilised. Based on this I predicted that males with with fewer brothers would be better <b>inseminators.</b> Despite finding significant among-strain variation in (1) single-foundress sex ratio, (2) mate competitiveness when alone and (3) when in competition, (4) sperm resources, but not (5) sperm-depletion (Chapters 3 & 4), I did not find the predicted relationship. Conversely males from strains with more brothers had a higher mating success under competition (Chapter 3) leading to the question: does mating success select on sex ratio or vice versa? Either way it is a result of an interaction between sexual selection and sex allocation. Chapter 5 investigated the role of male post-copulatory courtship on female re-mating, and found that among-strain variation in female re-mating was not associated with variation in the duration of the post-copulatory courtship. Chapter 6 reviewed sexual conflict in the Hymenoptera: their haplodiploid genetics, newly sequenced genomes and varied life-histories provides a base for future research to build on. Finally I highlight the novel links between sexual selection, sex allocation, sexual conflict and the mating system found during my studies that will hopefully prompt future research on this topic...|$|R
