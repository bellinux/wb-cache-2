5|$|On October 4, 1955, the CAB {{released}} the final accident report, which concluded {{the reversal of}} the propellers and subsequent increase in power of the No. 4 engine <b>had</b> <b>caused</b> <b>the</b> accident.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} explosion, Thompson was {{informed}} by an Iowa crewman that the Navy was conducting a dishonest {{investigation into the}} cause of the tragedy. Thompson, a producer for the television newsmagazine 60 Minutes, later produced several television reports which disputed the Navy's conclusions as to what <b>had</b> <b>caused</b> <b>the</b> explosion.|$|E
5|$|The first {{investigation}} into the explosion, conducted by the U.S. Navy, concluded {{that one of the}} gun turret crew members, Clayton Hartwig, who died in the explosion, had deliberately caused it. During the investigation, numerous leaks to the media, later attributed to U.S. Navy officers and investigators, implied that Hartwig and another sailor, Kendall Truitt, had engaged in a homosexual relationship and that Hartwig <b>had</b> <b>caused</b> <b>the</b> explosion after their relationship had soured. In its report, however, the U.S. Navy concluded that the evidence did not show that Hartwig was homosexual but that he was suicidal and <b>had</b> <b>caused</b> <b>the</b> explosion with either an electronic or chemical detonator.|$|E
50|$|In {{the first}} hypothesis, {{there was a}} 150 m3 slide off Nice airport while {{constructing}} the fill of a new airport, perhaps {{as a consequence of}} this work. This landslide would <b>have</b> <b>caused</b> <b>the</b> first tsunami. After that, the material of this slide would <b>have</b> <b>caused</b> <b>the</b> submarine slide that would <b>have</b> <b>caused</b> <b>the</b> second tsunami.|$|R

40|$|In {{this thesis}} the genus 'Sophora will be studied {{approximately}} along these lines: first, {{a study of}} the internal and external factors which <b>have</b> <b>caused</b> <b>the</b> divaricate juvenile - non-divaricate adult to develop. This may be closely linked with <b>the</b> factors which <b>have</b> <b>caused</b> <b>the</b> divaricate shrub to develop. Second, {{a study of the}} apices of divaricate and non-divaricate species, the apex being the determining organ of the plant and finally, a study of the factors in New Zealand which may <b>have</b> <b>caused</b> <b>the</b> divaricate habit to become a characteristic feature of the New Zealand flora...|$|R
5|$|The {{first three}} P.1127s crashed, {{the second and}} third {{occurring}} during development. In 1963, the first prototype, XP831, publicly crashed at the Paris Air Show; the accident had been caused by a speck of dirt in the air feed lines of the nozzle control motor, which <b>had</b> <b>caused</b> <b>the</b> engine nozzles to stick. XP831 was later fully repaired and resumed development flying. All the pilots involved survived.|$|E
5|$|The {{flowers of}} T.truncata were once used {{extensively}} for decoration. Geoffrey Smith observed in 1909 that {{the collection of}} the flowers for this purpose <b>had</b> <b>caused</b> <b>the</b> decline of some populations on Mount Wellington. The timber of larger specimens has been used for inlays; it has an attractive grain and a pale red color.|$|E
5|$|The {{subsequent}} court-martial at Port Royal on 3 September {{ruled that}} a sudden change in the current after dark <b>had</b> <b>caused</b> <b>the</b> loss. The board acknowledged that Pamplin had sailed in a judicious manner and exonerated him and his officers from blame both {{for the loss of}} Lowestoffe and the vessels in convoy.|$|E

5|$|After {{the end of}} the campaign, Galland {{claimed to}} be {{suffering}} from rheumatism and therefore unfit for flying in open-cockpit aircraft, such as the Hs 123. He tactfully suggested a transfer to a single-engine aircraft type with a closed cockpit would improve his condition. His request was accepted on medical grounds. Galland was removed from his post as a direct ground support pilot. Galland never explained whether open cockpits <b>had</b> <b>caused</b> <b>the</b> complaint or some other cause; given his performance with eye specialists, a certain amount of suspicion is reasonable. He was transferred to Jagdgeschwader 27 (JG 27—Fighter Wing 27) on 10 February 1940 as the adjutant, restricting him from flying.|$|E
5|$|Further east, Ibn Battuta {{traveled}} from Southeast Asia to Khanbaliq (Beijing) in China. Although the Muslim leaders there extended him a warm welcome, they {{advised him to}} leave the city soon. A civil war <b>had</b> <b>caused</b> <b>the</b> Khan to flee the city, and riots were becoming more and more widespread. Meanwhile, T'aigo Wangsa, a Korean Buddhist monk, traveled to China to receive training under the guidance of Buddhist leader Shih-wu. T'aigo later founded the T'aigo sect of Korean Buddhism.|$|E
5|$|Reports {{into the}} crash by the Greek Air Force, and an {{independent}} investigator hired by Onassis, the Englishman Alan Hunter, concluded that it had occurred {{as a result of}} the reversing of the aileron connecting cables during the installation of a new control column. This cause was disputed by McGregor who believed that the wake turbulence from an Air France Boeing 727 that had taken off before them <b>had</b> <b>caused</b> <b>the</b> crash.|$|E

5|$|Scott {{was given}} {{leave from the}} Navy to write the {{official}} expedition account, The Voyage of the Discovery; this was published in 1905, and sold well. However, Scott's account {{in the book of}} Shackleton's breakdown during the southern journey led to disagreement between the two men, particularly over Scott's version {{of the extent to which}} his companion had been carried on the sledge. The implication was that Shackleton's breakdown <b>had</b> <b>caused</b> <b>the</b> relatively unimpressive southern record.|$|E
5|$|Tatum {{considered}} resigning {{in order}} to enter business. University president Byrd, a staunch patron of football at the school, was preparing to campaign for governor, and Tatum feared his successor would significantly {{reduce the number of}} athletic scholarships available. He and Byrd, however, had also disagreed over the decision to participate in bowl games in violation of conference rules. Tatum was opposed to it, as it greatly increased the difficulty of scheduling and <b>had</b> <b>caused</b> <b>the</b> reduction in number of home games.|$|E
5|$|The country's {{military}} and economic might declined after the Asen dynasty ended in 1257, facing internal conflicts, constant Byzantine and Hungarian attacks and Mongol domination. By {{the end of the}} 14th century, factional divisions between the feudal landlords and the spread of Bogomilism <b>had</b> <b>caused</b> <b>the</b> Second Bulgarian Empire to split into three tsardoms—Vidin, Tarnovo and Karvuna—and several semi-independent principalities that fought each other, along with Byzantines, Hungarians, Serbs, Venetians and Genoese. By the late 14th century the Ottoman Turks had started their conquest of Bulgaria and had taken most towns and fortresses south of the Balkan mountains.|$|E

5|$|After 170 {{minutes of}} slow batting, Edrich gloved a rising Lindwall {{delivery}} and was caught behind by wicket-keeper Don Tallon. At 119/5, Compton {{returned to the}} field, his head wound having been stitched to stop the bleeding. He and Yardley played carefully until the tea break, and only the England captain offered a chance; Barnes was unable to complete the reflex catch at short leg from the bowling of Toshack. After the resumption of play, Yardley on-drove Lindwall for a four, but lofted Ernie Toshack, who had been bowling leg theory, into the packed on-side where he was caught by Johnson at forward square leg. Toshack's defensive bowling <b>had</b> <b>caused</b> <b>the</b> English skipper to lose patience and his departure for 22 left the score on 141/6.|$|E
5|$|But as American {{involvement}} in Vietnam was winding down, the Army canceled the Cheyenne program on 9 August 1972. By this time, the AH-1 Cobra was widely deployed by the Army during the Vietnam War and {{equipped with the}} TOW anti-tank missile. Controversy with the United States Air Force over the Cheyenne's role in combat {{as well as the}} political climate regarding military acquisition programs <b>had</b> <b>caused</b> <b>the</b> Army to amend the service's attack helicopter requirements in favor of a twin-engine conventional helicopter, viewed as less technical and more survivable. The Army announced a new program for an Advanced Attack Helicopter (AAH) on 17 August 1972, which {{led to the development of}} the AH-64 Apache.|$|E
5|$|England {{played two}} spinners; left arm {{orthodox}} spinner Jack Young replaced fellow finger spinner Jim Laker, while the leg spin of Eric Hollies replaced the pace bowling of Dick Pollard. Hollies {{was brought into}} the team because he <b>had</b> <b>caused</b> <b>the</b> Australian batsmen difficulty in the tour match against Warwickshire. He took 8/107 in the first innings, the best innings figures against the Australians for the summer. His performance included bowling Bradman with a topspinner that went between bat and pad. It {{was part of a}} month-long run in which he took 52 wickets in seven matches, including two ten-wicket match hauls. Young had taken 12 and 14 wickets in consecutive matches against Northamptonshire and Surrey since his omission following the Third Test, while Pollard and Laker had managed totals of only 2/159 and 3/206 respectively in the Headingley Test.|$|E

5|$|Finucane's {{start at}} No. 452 was unimpressive. On 3 May 1941 {{while on a}} {{recognition}} flight with his new commanding officer, Squadron Leader Roy Dutton, Finucane got too close and his propeller sliced through Dutton's tailplane. Finucane radioed Dutton immediately. Dutton attempted to abandon the aircraft but was too low and crash-landed, cracking several ribs but surviving. Finucane excused himself from error asserting that his Spitfire {{was the only one}} with a metal propeller—the others being elder Mark I's with wooden mounts—which gave him extra speed. In tight formation, this <b>had</b> <b>caused</b> <b>the</b> collision. Despite the incident, he was gazetted on 13 May and given temporary command of the squadron while Dutton was injured. While at 452 Finucane became a popular commander and encouraged a more relaxed atmosphere, which he believed would help him get more out of the Australian pilots. He was now in command of 23 pilots, 16 fighters and 130 ground crew.|$|E
5|$|Halfway {{through the}} day, England fell to 5/119, and captain Yardley came in. He hit Toshack in the air, but Barnes {{was unable to}} {{complete}} the reflex catch at short leg. However, this error did not cost many runs. Yardley lofted Toshack into the on-side and the hands of Johnson at forward square leg to fall for 22 with the score at 6/141. Toshack's defensive bowling <b>had</b> <b>caused</b> <b>the</b> English skipper to lose patience and his departure for 22 left the score on 141/6. Toshack bowled Dick Pollard late in the innings to finish with 2/75 from 41 overs—including 20 maidens—as England ended with 363. Toshack was unbeaten on zero and was only at the crease for one minute as Australia replied with 221. In the second innings, Toshack removed Compton for a duck, caught in the slips by Miller, and ended with 1/26 as the rain-affected match ended in a draw. He also had Washbrook dropped in the slips cordon by Johnson, one of several times that the batsman was reprieved during the innings.|$|E
5|$|In March 2008, a {{coalition}} of human rights groups charged that the Israeli blockade of the city <b>had</b> <b>caused</b> <b>the</b> humanitarian situation in Gaza to have reached its worst point since Israel occupied the territory in the 1967 Six-Day War, and that Israeli air strikes targeting militants in the densely populated areas have often killed bystanders as well. In 2008, Israel commenced an assault against Gaza. Israel stated the strikes were in response to repetitive rocket and mortar attacks from the Gaza Strip into Israel since 2005, while the Palestinians stated that they were responding to Israel's military incursions and blockade of the Gaza Strip. In January 2009, at least 1,300 Palestinians {{were killed in the}} conflict.|$|E
