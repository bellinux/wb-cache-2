5|$|In the Caribbean and {{tropical}} Pacific, <b>direct</b> <b>contact</b> between ~40–70% of common seaweeds and coral causes bleaching and {{death to the}} coral via transfer of lipid-soluble metabolites. Seaweed and algae proliferate given adequate nutrients and limited grazing by herbivores such as parrotfish.|$|E
5|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} also reduces silica {{which has}} {{to be removed from}} the pig iron. The silica is reacted with calcium oxide (burned limestone) and forms a slag which floats {{to the surface of the}} molten pig iron. The <b>direct</b> <b>contact</b> of flue gas with the iron causes contamination with sulfur if it is present in the fuel. Historically, to prevent contamination from sulfur, the best quality iron was produced with charcoal.|$|E
5|$|Elemental iodine {{is also a}} skin irritant, and <b>direct</b> <b>contact</b> {{with skin}} can cause damage and solid iodine {{crystals}} should be handled with care. Solutions with high elemental iodine concentration, such as tincture of iodine and Lugol's solution, are capable of causing tissue damage if used in prolonged cleaning or antisepsis; similarly, liquid Povidone-iodine (Betadine) trapped against the skin resulted in chemical burns in some reported cases.|$|E
30|$|Degree {{centrality}} and its derivative, in-degree and out-degree centrality, {{are local}} measures [13]. Degree centrality is a straightforward {{count of the}} number of <b>direct</b> <b>contacts</b> that are linked to a node. Out-degree centrality measures the number of <b>direct</b> <b>contacts</b> to whom the node communicates toward (out-flow communication). In-degree centrality measures the number of these <b>direct</b> <b>contacts</b> that communicate toward a node (in-flow communication).|$|R

5|$|Scouting in South Africa grew rapidly, and in 1912 Robert Baden-Powell visited South African Scouts. Due to {{the rapid}} spread of Scouting it became {{necessary}} to provide some form of local co-ordination. Provincial Councils were formed in South Africa between 1912 and 1916. These councils had no <b>direct</b> <b>contact</b> {{with each other and}} reported directly to Imperial Scout Headquarters in London.|$|E
5|$|September 30, 2002: Arturo Martinez Tapia {{assaulted}} a Greyhound driver near Fresno, California, {{resulting in}} two passenger deaths after the bus then rolled off an embankment and crashed. Following this attack, an aisle gate and driver's shield were installed on most Greyhound buses which prevent passengers from having <b>direct</b> <b>contact</b> {{with the driver}} when the bus is in motion, even if the aisle gate is forced open.|$|E
5|$|Shoe polish {{contains}} {{chemical substances}} {{which can be}} absorbed through the skin, or inhaled. When handling shoe polish, one should ideally wear gloves, and stay in a well-ventilated area. Shoe polish should be kept {{out of reach of}} children and animals. It can stain the skin for a protracted period of time, and will cause irritation to the eye if there is <b>direct</b> <b>contact.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{clitoral}} glans doubles {{in diameter}} upon arousal, and, upon further stimulation, it becomes less visible {{as it is}} covered by the swelling of tissues of the clitoral hood. The swelling protects the glans from <b>direct</b> <b>contact,</b> as <b>direct</b> <b>contact</b> at this stage can be more irritating than pleasurable. Vasocongestion eventually triggers a muscular reflex, which expels the blood that was trapped in surrounding tissues, and leads to an orgasm. A short time after stimulation has stopped, especially if orgasm has been achieved, the glans becomes visible again and returns to its normal state, with a few seconds (usually 5–10) to return to its normal position and 5–10 minutes to return to its original size. If orgasm is not achieved, the clitoris may remain engorged for a few hours, which women often find uncomfortable. Additionally, the clitoris is very sensitive after orgasm, making further stimulation initially painful for some women. Masters and Johnson documented the sexual response cycle, which has four phases and is still the clinically accepted definition of the human orgasm.|$|E
5|$|The insect {{circulatory system}} {{utilizes}} hemolymph, a tissue analogous to blood that circulates {{in the interior}} of the insect body, while remaining in <b>direct</b> <b>contact</b> with the animal's tissues. It is composed of plasma in which hemocytes are suspended. In addition to hemocytes, the plasma also contains many chemicals. It is also the major tissue type of the open circulatory system of arthropods, characteristic of spiders, crustaceans and insects.|$|E

5|$|According to Freitas, <b>direct</b> <b>contact</b> with civilizations {{significantly}} {{more advanced than}} humanity {{would have to take}} place within the Solar System, as only the more advanced society would have the resources and technology to cross interstellar space. Consequently, such contact could only be with civilizations rated as Type II or higher on the Kardashev scale, as Type I civilizations would be incapable of regular interstellar travel. Freitas expected that such interactions would be carefully planned by the more advanced civilization to avoid mass societal shock for humanity.|$|E
5|$|Armillaria species form fleshy, white-spored {{mushrooms}} with a cottony or membranous veil {{that typically}} forms a distinct annulus on the stem. The fruit bodies usually occur in autumn in large clusters {{at the base}} of the stem or roots. Armillaria species can produce rhizomorphs—rootlike aggregations of hyphae—that can form massive, long-lasting underground networks. The growth of the rhizomorph networks allows for tree-to-tree spread of the fungus even when <b>direct</b> <b>contact</b> between diseased and healthy plants is not possible.|$|E
5|$|Extant strepsirrhines have an epitheliochorial placenta, {{where the}} {{maternal}} blood {{does not come}} in <b>direct</b> <b>contact</b> with the fetal chorion like {{it does in the}} hemochorial placenta of haplorhines. The strepsirrhine uterus has two distinct chambers (bicornuate). Despite having similar gestation periods to comparably sized haplorhines, fetal growth rates are generally slower in strepsirrhines, which results in newborn offspring that are as little as one-third the size of haplorhine newborns. Extant strepsirrhines also have a lower basal metabolic rate, which elevates in females during gestation, putting greater demands on the mother.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The metastatic {{potential}} of {{non-small cell lung cancer}} (NSCLC) {{has been shown}} to be associated with interactions with the tumor microenvironment, which primarily comprises of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Heterotypic cell–cell interactions occur via released signaling molecules and <b>direct</b> physical <b>contact.</b> To investigate the differential contribution of <b>direct</b> cell–cell <b>contact</b> and paracrine signaling factors to NSCLC metastasis, we performed two types of co-cultures: direct co-cultures of the NSCLC cell line H 358 with primary cultures of CAFs from patients with resected NSCLC; and indirect co-cultures across a separable membrane. We showed that CAFs more potently induce epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in NSCLC H 358 cells through <b>direct</b> <b>contacts</b> than through indirect interactions, as indicated by an elongated and disseminate...|$|R

5|$|Invisible Circles is {{a concept}} album about the {{dynamics}} of quarrelsome families and psychological child abuse. The theme was inspired by guitarist Sander Gommans' work as an art teacher, in <b>direct</b> <b>contact</b> with dysfunctional families and teen-age problems. It is also a metal opera, with a storyline that follows the lives of an abused child and her parents since her conception to adulthood. The album was received with mixed reviews, but entered the charts in the Netherlands and Belgium.|$|E
5|$|RNAi in vivo {{delivery}} to tissues still eludes science—especially to tissues {{deep within the}} body. RNAi delivery is only easily accessible to surface tissues such as the eye and respiratory tract. In these instances, siRNA {{has been used in}} <b>direct</b> <b>contact</b> with the tissue for transport. The resulting RNAi successfully focused on target genes. When delivering siRNA to deep tissues, the siRNA must be protected from nucleases, but targeting specific areas becomes the main difficulty. This difficulty has been combatted with high dosage levels of siRNA to ensure the tissues have been reached, however in these cases hepatotoxicity was reported.|$|E
5|$|Sino-Roman {{relations}} {{comprised the}} mostly indirect contact, flow of trade goods, information, and occasional travellers between the Roman Empire and Han Empire of China, {{as well as}} between the later Eastern Roman Empire and various Chinese dynasties. These empires inched progressively closer {{in the course of the}} Roman expansion into the ancient Near East and simultaneous Han Chinese military incursions into Central Asia. Mutual awareness remained low, and firm knowledge about each other was limited. Only a few attempts at <b>direct</b> <b>contact</b> are known from records. Intermediate empires such as the Parthians and Kushans, seeking to maintain lucrative control over the silk trade, inhibited <b>direct</b> <b>contact</b> between these two Eurasian powers. In 97 AD, the Chinese general Ban Chao tried to send his envoy Gan Ying to Rome, but Gan was dissuaded by Parthians from venturing beyond the Persian Gulf. Several alleged Roman emissaries to China were recorded by ancient Chinese historians. The first one on record, supposedly from either the Roman emperor Antoninus Pius or his adopted son Marcus Aurelius, arrived in 166 AD. Others are recorded as arriving in 226 and 284 AD, with a long absence until the first recorded Byzantine embassy in 643 AD.|$|E

5|$|The largest use {{of lead in}} {{the early}} 21st century is in lead–acid batteries. The {{reactions}} in the battery between lead, lead dioxide, and sulfuric acid provide a reliable source of voltage. The lead in batteries undergoes no <b>direct</b> <b>contact</b> with humans, so there are fewer toxicity concerns. Supercapacitors incorporating lead–acid batteries have been installed in kilowatt and megawatt scale applications in Australia, Japan, and the United States in frequency regulation, solar smoothing and shifting, wind smoothing, and other applications. These batteries have lower energy density and charge-discharge efficiency than lithium-ion batteries, but are significantly cheaper.|$|E
