40|$|Commodity prices often {{fluctuate}} {{significantly from}} one purchasing opportunity to the next. These fluctuations allow firms {{to benefit from}} <b>forward</b> <b>buying</b> (buying for future demand in addition to current demand) when prices are low. We propose a combined heuristic to determine the optimal number of future periods a firm should purchase at each ordering opportunity {{in order to maximize}} total expected profit when there is uncertainty in future demand and future buying price. We compare our heuristic with existing methods via simulation using real demand data from BlueLinx, a two-stage distributor of building products. The results show that our combined heuristic performs better than any existing methods considering <b>forward</b> <b>buying</b> or safety stock separately. We also compare our heuristic to the optimal inventory management policy by full enumeration for a smaller data set. The proposed heuristic is shown to be close to optimal. This study is the first to decide both the optimal number of future periods to buy for uncertain purchase price and the appropriate purchasing quantity with safety stock for uncertain demand simultaneously. The experience suggests that the proposed combined heuristic is simple and can be very beneficial for any company where <b>forward</b> <b>buying</b> is possible.

40|$|Since the 1990 s, {{governmental}} agencies have increasingly turned to market based {{cap and trade}} programs to control the emission of pollutants. Firms subject to cap and trade regulation are typically required to acquire emissions allowances via open auction markets. The cost to acquire allowances may impose a substantial financial burden on a firm. While emissions reduction efforts may eliminate some firm 2 ̆ 7 s need to acquire additional allowances, there are still numerous firms that need to purchase additional allowances on the open market. This study presents a new <b>forward</b> <b>buying</b> heuristic, designed for those firms that need to purchase emissions allowances via auctions, which reduces the impact of emissions allowance acquisitions on the firms 2 ̆ 7 financial performance. The heuristic, designated as the Newsvendor Production Planning with Emissions Allowance <b>Forward</b> <b>Buying</b> (NPPAFB) method, applies a <b>forward</b> <b>buying</b> algorithm {{to determine the number}} of periods for which to forward buy allowances, the current production order up to level, and the current and future emissions allowance requirements (which serves as the order up to level for allowance purchases). Additionally, NPPAFB also authorizes unused emissions allowances to be sold when market conditions are favorable. Compared against three existing production planning and allowance procurement strategies, a simulation exercise finds that the NPPAFB method significantly reduces a firm 2 ̆ 7 s emissions allowance expenditures. These results indicate that heuristic can be readily adopted by any firm that is required to procure emissions allowances via open markets in an effort to improve the firm 2 ̆ 7 s profitability...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the empirical}} demand data for fast moving consumer goods {{to measure the}} Bullwhip-effect. The data consist of the sell-in from a large manufacturer to the retailers and the sell-out from a retailer to the consumers. Our findings show that the Bullwhip-effect can be substantial. Indeed, in more than 50 % of the cases, the demand upstream (sell-in) is twice as variable as the demand downstream (sell-out). However, in other cases it can be negligible (and in one case, the demand upstream is slightly less variable than the demand downstream). So, while the Bullwhip-effect can be very large, it need not be so. Finally, we attempted to delve into the dynamics that generate a significant Bullwhip-effect and discovered that among the various causes that create the Bullwhip-effect discussed by Lee et al. (1997 a), price fluctuations and <b>forward</b> <b>buys</b> driven by sales targets play a decisive role. We show that the flatter the final consumer demand (sell-out), the more room there is for the retailers to <b>forward</b> <b>buy</b> {{in order to take}} advantage of the deals offered by the manufacturer's sales force toward the end of the sales period. On the contrary, the more variable the final consumer demand, the less willing the retailer is to make a risky inventory investment and, thus, the more the retailer's orders closely follow consumer demand. This result at the product family level is very consistent with the results that Cachon et al. (2007) obtained at the company/industry leve...|$|R

While most previous {{studies have focused on}} packaged goods sold in grocery stores, we consider durable goods sold through a direct mail catalog. The findings reveal different effects for first-time and established customers. Deeper price discounts in the current period future purchases by first-time customers (a positive long-run effect) but future purchases by established customers (a negative long-run effect). Overall, the results show evidence of several long-run effects: <b>forward</b> <b>buying,</b> selection, customer learning, and increased deal sensitivity. Short-run metrics that ignore these effects overstate the overall change in demand for established customers. The implication is that if prices are set based on short-run elasticity, then they will be too low. Among first-time customers, the short-run metrics underestimate the total increase in demand.

40|$|Manufacturer-supported trade deals remain one of {{the major}} {{competitive}} tools in today's marketplace. This is true despite the fact that such trade deals are often claimed to be unprofitable for manufacturers. The unprofitability is attributed to the fact that retailers forward buy and do not pass the price discounts on to the consumers. The audience for this paper includes practitioners and academics who have been concerned with the ubiquitous practice of trade dealing in spite of its purported unprofitability. The paper attempts to understand the motivations for trade dealing by comparing the profitability of trade dealing in the presence of <b>forward</b> <b>buying</b> to a situation in which retailers carry no inventory. Moreover, we shed light on why manufacturers sometimes offer trade deals even though the retailers do not pass through these deals to the consumers. We study the problem of trade dealing through an economic model that includes the manufacturers, the retailer, and the consumers. In this way we include all three levels of the distribution system, and model the dynamic effects of <b>forward</b> <b>buying</b> by the retailer. The main features of the model can be summarized as follows. At the manufacturer level, each of two manufacturers is allowed to offer a regular price and a deal price, which, if accepted by the retailer, requires the retailer to display and merchandise the product. Moreover, the manufacturer is assumed to incur a selling cost with respect to offering a trade deal. The retailer, on the other hand, decides whether to accept the deal, determines how much to order, and sets the retail prices of the two brands. The retailer needs to set a price below the regular price to achieve maximum effectiveness from its display and merchandising activities. If the retailer accepts a trade deal, it incurs a fixed cost of display and merchandising the product reflecting the opportunity cost of display. If the retailer does not accept the trade deal, it can order at the non-deal price. Furthermore, the retailer can order more than what can be sold to the consumers in that period, i. e, forward buy. The retailer can carry inventory from either manufacturer at a cost but has an upper limit to the total amount of inventory carried in any period. The consumer population is assumed to consist of brand loyals and switchers. The brand loyals buy as long as the price is below the reservation price, while the switchers choose the brand on display if the retail price is lower than the regular price and the price of the competing brand. With these as the basic elements of the model, we characterize the equilibrium manufacturer and retailer pricing strategies with and without inventories in an infinite-horizon model with discounting. The central result of the paper is derived by comparing the profits to the manufacturers for the case when retailers are allowed to forward buy to the case when they are not allowed to forward buy. This comparison shows that although <b>forward</b> <b>buying</b> is profitable to the retailer through the availability of goods at lower prices, an important consequence of <b>forward</b> <b>buying</b> is the decreased intensity of competition between manufacturers. The decrease in the intensity of competition yields higher profits to the manufacturers as compared to the case where the retailer is not allowed to carry any inventory. The intuition behind our result is seen by taking a closer look at intensity of trade dealing in the presence and absence of <b>forward</b> <b>buying.</b> Consider the worst and the best trade deals offered by manufacturers, in equilibrium, when the retailer is not allowed to carry any inventory and explore their viability when the retailer is allowed to inventory. If the retailer is allowed to carry inventory and holds some inventory, the worst trade deals become unacceptable to the retailer. This is because the inventory allows the retailer to not buy all the units demanded in the subsequent period, and the retailer can therefore reject such trade deals. Similarly, the best trade deals offered by manufacturers when the retailer is not allowed to inventory do not remain as profitable because the retailer forward buys and the manufacturers lose future sales and profits. Thus trade deals at both extremes (the best and the worst) that were profitable to the manufacturers when the retailer is not allowed to forward buy are no longer viable when the retailer is allowed to forward buy. This increases the overall probability of not offering trade deals and leads to decreased intensity of competition. competition, trade promotions, merchandising, <b>forward</b> <b>buying...</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates {{supply chain}} {{coordination}} with side-payment contracts. We first summarize specific side-payment contracts and present our review on {{the literature that}} developed general side-payment schemes to coordinate supply chains. Following our review, we discuss two criteria that a proper side-payment contract must satisfy, and accordingly introduce a decision-dependent transfer payment function and a constant transfer term. We present the condition that the transfer function must satisfy, and use Nash arbitration scheme and Shapley value to compute the constant transfer term and derive its closed-form solution. Next, we provide a five-step procedure {{for the development of}} side-payment contract, and apply it to four supply chain games: Cournot and Bertrand games, a two-retailer supply chain game with substitutable products and a one-supplier, one-retailer supply chain. More specifically, for the Cournot game, we construct a linear transfer function and a constant side-payment to coordinate two producers. For the Bertrand game, we build a nonlinear transfer function which is equivalent to a revenue-sharing contract, and show that the constant term is zero and two firms in the game equally share the system-wide profit. For a supply chain with substitutable products, we present a side-payment contract to coordinate two retailers. For a two-echelon supply chain, we develop a proper side-payment scheme that can coordinate the supply chain and also help reduce the impact of <b>forward</b> <b>buying</b> on supply chain performance.

This shows that the "mode of competition" between firms may be entirely endogenous. Second, I consider heterogenous goods in duopolies, which generalizes existing results on forward sales of output, and derive the outcome set in general duopolies. This set does not contain the Bertrand solution anymore, but it is well-defined and shows that forward sales increase welfare also when goods are complements. ...|$|E

40|$|Manufacturers and {{suppliers}} offer temporary reductions (or permanent increases) {{in the price}} charged to the resellers {{for a variety of}} reasons. The trade promotion may be offered to the reseller at a single point in time or over a finite time-span. In addition, in reselling situations, the end demand tends to be sensitive to selling price. It is commonly found that under such trade promotion (or in stockpiling to an announced price increase), not all the quantity purchased by the reseller at discount may be passed on to the final consumer at a reduced selling price. In fact, previous studies have shown that it is optimal for the reseller to carry forward some of the quantity purchased at discount and sell it later at the regular price. It has been suggested in the literature that by placing a restriction on the reseller's purchase quantity, the supplier can restrict the reseller's forward buy quantity. In this paper, we evaluate this approach. In the rest of the paper, we present alternate schemes which are easy to administer and which insure that the supplier avoids the spike in demand that occurs in the unconstrained problem.

It {{has been estimated}} that this practice adds up to $ 100 billion worth of inventory to the distribution system. Yet, the practice continues. In this paper, we propose a price discrimination model of trade promotions. We show that in a distribution channel characterized by a dominant retailer, a manufacturer has incentives to price discriminate between the dominant retailer and smaller independents. While offering all retailers the same pricing policy, price discrimination can be implemented through trade promotions because they induce different inventory-ordering behaviors on the part of retailers. Differences in inventory holding costs {{have been shown to be}} an important determinant of consumer promotions. Our analysis suggests that differences in holding costs are also potentially an important driver for the use of trade promotions. The implications from our model explain a number of anecdotal and/or empirically observed puzzles about how trade promotions are practiced.

This effect is experienced by various industries, from fast moving consumer goods to IT products.

The only way in which supply chain members may eradicate the bullwhip effect is to enhance coordination among the subsequent stages.
