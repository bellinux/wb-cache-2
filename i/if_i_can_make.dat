2500|$|In March 2006, {{various sources}} {{reported}} Shetty's joining PETA {{as part of}} an advertising campaign against the use of wild animals in circuses. According to a PETA India press release, Shetty is a long-time PETA supporter and has assisted the campaign by posing for photographs in a figure-hugging tiger costume. She explained that her crouching in a cage was uncomfortable during the photoshoot, but that her discomfort was insignificant compared to the pain suffered by the creatures. [...] "These once dignified animals only leave their cages, which are barely larger than the size of their bodies, for a few minutes each day to be forced into the ring to perform tricks which make no sense and are upsetting to them. The best way to help animals suffering in circuses is to boycott the circus". Shetty revealed in a later interview that she felt strongly about this cause and that she was appalled to hear of the cruel treatment suffered by such animals. [...] "I thought I should stop that. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> a little difference to their lives, why not go for it?" ...|$|E

60|$|So, here I'll sit; and, perhaps, {{when you}} have been good children, and have learned your lessons or done your work, your mother will let you come and play a little while with me.

We have been dawdling about in this wretched country long enough.

If the young people here want to dawdle about any longer they <b>can</b> do so; <b>I</b> dare say they can look after themselves, or <b>if</b> not, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> an arrangement with some old lady or other to act as Alice's chaperon." ...|$|R

60|$|Having thus briefly {{considered}} {{the original and}} office of a critic, as the word is understood in its most noble and universal acceptation, I proceed to refute the objections of those who argue from the silence and pretermission of authors, by which they pretend {{to prove that the}} very art of criticism, as now exercised, and by me explained, is wholly modern, and consequently that the critics of Great Britain and France have no title to an original so ancient and illustrious as I have deduced. Now, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> clearly <b>make</b> out, on the contrary, that the most ancient writers have particularly described both the person and the office of a true critic agreeable to the definition laid down by me, their grand objection--from the silence of authors--will fall to the ground.|$|R
