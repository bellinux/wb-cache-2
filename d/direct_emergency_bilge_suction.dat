25|$|Managua's {{progress}} came to {{a sudden}} halt after it suffered a second major earthquake on December 23, 1972, which destroyed 90% of the city's downtown and killed more than 19,120 people. Infrastructure was severely damaged and rehabilitation or restoration of buildings was nearly impossible. At the time, Managua's limited resources had to be directed to other disaster relief purposes. Managua's {{ability to cope with}} the disaster was also limited. Surviving fire squadrons and ambulance companies were not able to handle the skyrocketing demand for their services. Some buildings burned to the ground, while the foundations of others simply gave way. Not able to rebuild quickly, the city <b>directed</b> <b>emergency</b> workers to clear away much of the city's ruins quickly while burying the deceased in mass graves. Residences, government buildings and entire avenues were demolished. Escaping the city center, earthquake victims found refuge in the outskirts of the city. To add insult to injury, corruption within the Somoza regime which allocated part of the relief funds hindered the reconstruction of the city's center which remains somewhat isolated {{from the rest of the}} capital.|$|R

40|$|This study {{describes}} the epidemiology of pedestrian injuries {{to children and}} adolescents (ages < 20) in an urban setting, providing analyses of environmental and pedestrian variables. Anonymous data were obtained for all motor vehicle crashes occurring in New York City over a 7 -year period (1991 - 1997). Among 693, 283 crashes, 97, 245 resulted in injuries to 100, 261 pedestrians of whom 32, 578 were under age 20. Using census counts for the denominator, the overall incidence of pediatric pedestrian injuries was 246 / 100, 000 per year, and the case fatality rate was 0. 6 %. Incidence rates peaked in the 6 - 14 year age group, and showed a modest annual decline during the study period. Younger children {{were more likely to}} be struck mid-block and during daylight hours, whereas adolescents {{were more likely to be}} struck at intersections and at night. For younger children, there was a sharp peak in incidence during the summer months. Road and weather conditions did not appear to affect injury risk. These results help identify priorities for child pedestrian injury prevention and education, inform public health policy, and <b>direct</b> <b>emergency</b> medical health services resource allocation...|$|R
30|$|Identification of {{pollutant}} {{sources for}} river pollution incidents {{is an important}} and difficult task in the emergency rescue, and an intelligent optimization method can effectively compensate for the weakness of traditional methods. An intelligent model for pollutant source identification has been established using the basic genetic algorithm (BGA) as an optimization search tool and applying an analytic solution formula of one-dimensional unsteady water quality equation to construct the objective function. Experimental tests show that the identification model is effective and efficient: the model can accurately figure out the pollutant amounts or positions no matter single pollution source or multiple sources. Especially when the population size of BGA is set as 10, the computing results are sound agree with analytic results for a single source amount and position identification, the relative errors {{are no more than}} 5  %. For cases of multi-point sources and multi-variable, there are some errors in computing results for the reasons that there exist many possible combinations of the pollution sources. But, with the help of previous experience to narrow the search scope, the relative errors of the identification results are less than 5  %, which proves the established source identification model can be used to <b>direct</b> <b>emergency</b> responses.|$|R
