Although fading of fugitive colorants, for example, turnsole, eosine, or tartrazine, is notable and well known to conservators, other changes may be slow or be initiated by a specific chemical event, such as a change in water content or pH, and therefore the cause is less immediately recognizable.

Muonium forms after implantation of positive muons into diamond. In the 13 C diamond, the muon spin relaxes due to the motion of MuT {{against the background of}} randomly oriented spins of the host nuclei. Spin-lattice relaxation of the initially spin-polarized muons, in their capacity as nuclei of the Mu T atoms, was studied as a function of magnetic field and temperature in the ranges 20 mT- 0. 4 T and 10 - 400 K, respectively. The extracted hop rate is large, τc- 1 ∼ 1011 Hz, indicating fast diffusion of MuT, as expected for such a light interstitial atom. Its approximately constant value over the entire measured temperature range suggests weakly scattered coherent tunneling rather than incoherent or phonon-assisted tunneling, consistent with the high Debye temperature of diamond and the shallow interstitial potential for neutral hydrogen or muonium. There are indications of increasing localization of the wave-packet, i. e., of an <b>incipient</b> <b>change</b> to incoherent tunneling, towards the higher temperatures. Thermal conversion of the mobile MuT state to the stable bond-centered muonium (MuBC) state prevents the diffusion of Mu T being explored beyond 400 K. © 2004 Elsevier B. V.

This paper develops a stylized intertemporal framework in which {{the effects of a}} preannounced exchange-rate oriented disinflation scheme can be studied. It is shown that even when agents have perfect foresight and markets clear continuously, the "capital inflows" problem and the associated real appreciation may result. While unanticipated, permanent inflation changes are neutral in the paper,anticipated inflation is neutral only in exceptional circumstances. A preannounced disinflation operates by altering the path of an expenditure -based real domestic interest rate that depends on expected changes in the prices of liquidity services and nontradable consumption goods.

In the area of government intelligence, the difficulties of overcoming the conflict between democracy and counter-intelligence, military and civilian, and between politicians and intelligence officers generate an individual bias in psychological-cognitive dimension (phase of collection and analysis of information) and an institutional bias in political-organizational dimension (phase of decision-making). Government initiatives such as collaborative portal [URL] if not guided by Knowledge Management-KM and Organizational Intelligence-OI, will contribute to increasing the current avalanche of information from the web 2. 0 (the era of social networks). Moreover, any “pre-referendum initiative” should be based not only on a future political reform (who legislates), but also the administrative (who apply) and judicial (who thinks) reforms to achieve sustainable growth. We are living through a phase of “technological enthusiasm”, which ends up generating the underestimation of human capital, the difficulty of creating and use of relevant knowledge, the lack of results and loss of focus. This article, from the review of the concepts and practices of KM and OI, the critics on models of governance and the country’s intelligence system, presents a model of Government Intelligence, a proposal for a cultural change and a strategy for a KM-OI plan to optimize the processes of creation (KM) and use of knowledge (OI) in the public sector...|$|E
40|$|The associational {{sector has}} gained recent prominence, and {{scholars}} increasingly recognize the dualistic potential {{of civil society}} and social capital to promote either peace or violence. However, research to date gives {{little attention to the}} large proportion of associations that influence conflict unintentionally, as an externality produced during the pursuit of other goals. This emergent cluster of theory, which centers on the work of Robert Putnam and Ashutosh Varshney, tends to generalize the nature and causes of such externalities in ways that overlook associational complexity and dynamism. Therefore this thesis explores the applicability of conflict sensitivity, an organizational planning approach that originated in the humanitarian aid sector, for understanding and improving the social impact of religious associations in conflict-vulnerable multifaith societies. The author undertook action research with two local interfaith associations in Mindanao and Singapore to test the usage of the ‘Do No Harm’ conflict sensitivity framework among religious audiences in settings of ethno-religious conflict. More than 160 Protestant, Roman Catholic and Muslim leaders contributed empirically through participatory social analysis, surveys and interviews. The study finds that ‘Do No Harm’ holds relevance and usefulness for religious associations, yet it requires conceptual and practical adaptation of its impact analysis components. Further, while the data support the importance in existing theory of bridging or intercommunal associational structures, there is strong evidence that individual mindsets and intentional human agency are equally central in shaping associational impact. Further, the public prominence of religion in Southeast Asia contrasts with Western-influenced liberal democratic assumptions, exposing a ‘religion gap’ in existing associational theory. Religious culture is shown to be a major influence shaping the formation and <b>incipient</b> <b>change</b> of group identities through associational life. Thus it is argued that wherever religion plays a public role, it should be consistently integrated into studies of associational social impact...|$|E

The framework employs procedures designed to temporally evolve the critical model parameters with experience for enhanced monitoring accuracy (a critical ability for mass deployment of the technology on a variety of equipment/hardware without needing extensive initial tune-up). Proposed approach makes explicit provision to characterize the distinct operating modes of the equipment, when necessary, and provides the ability to predict both abrupt as well as gradually developing (<b>incipient)</b> <b>changes.</b> The framework is realized as an autonomous software agent that continuously up-dates its decision model implementing an unsupervised recursive learning algorithm.

Fault detection in such systems is imperative to improve their reliability, productivity, safety and efficiency. Here, an innovative model-based fault-detection approach for early detection of shading of PV modules and faults on the direct current (DC) side of PV systems is proposed. This approach combines the flexibility, and simplicity of a one-diode model with the extended capacity of an exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) control chart to detect <b>incipient</b> <b>changes</b> in a PV system. The one-diode model, which is easily calibrated due to its limited calibration parameters, is used to predict the healthy PV array’s maximum power coordinates of current, voltage and power using measured temperatures and irradiances. Residuals, which capture {{the difference between the}} measurements and the predictions of the one-diode model, are generated and used as fault indicators. Then, the EWMA monitoring chart is applied on the uncorrelated residuals obtained from the one-diode model to detect and identify the type of fault.

Therefore, early detection of ionization injury and its degree is of great significance to treatment, which has also been the goal of radiology domain.

40|$|Abstract Background Cardiac insults such as ischemia, infarction, {{hypertrophy}} and dilatation {{are often}} accompanied by altered abundance and/or localization of the connexin 43 gap junction protein, which may predispose towards arrhythmic complications. Models of chronic dyssynchronous cardiac activation have {{also been shown to}} result in redistribution of connexin 43 in cardiomyocytes. We hypothesized that alterations in connexin 43 expression and localization in the mouse heart might be induced by ventricular pacing over a short period of time. Results The subdiaphragmatic approach was used to pace a series of wild type mice for six hours before the hearts were removed for analysis. Mice were paced at 10 – 15 % above their average anesthetized sinus rate and monitored to ensure 1 : 1 capture. Short-term pacing resulted in a significant reduction in connexin 43 mRNA abundance, a partial redistribution of connexin 43 from the sarcolemma to a non-sarcolemmal fraction, and accumulation of ubiquitinated connexin 43 without a significant change in overall connexin 43 protein levels. These early pacing-induced changes in connexin 43 expression were not accompanied by decreased cardiac function, prolonged refractoriness or increased inducibility into sustained arrhythmias. Conclusion Our data suggest that short-term pacing is associated with <b>incipient</b> <b>changes</b> in the expression of the connexin 43 gap junction, possibly including decreased production and a slowed rate of degradation. This murine model may facilitate the study of early molecular changes induced by pacing and may ultimately assist in the development of strategies to prevent gap junction remodeling and the associated arrhythmic complications of cardiac disease. </p...|$|R

The questionnaire focused specifically on the effect of the changes on quality and continuity of patient care, junior training and socio-economic factors relating to the medical staff. The questionnaire was entirely anonymous and carried only the first author name but provision was made to determine current grade, specialty, age, sex and career plans of the respondents. Importantly, space was included at the end for pertinent comments. All junior staff in training in all specialties in the Cardiff area were circulated. Three hundred and twenty-six questionnaires were sent out and 202 were returned of which 192 were properly completed (59 %). Almost everyone was au fait with the proposed changes. There was a surprisingly high level of support for changes among non-surgical trainees, and half felt that quality of care would improve, though the more senior the trainee, the less enthusiastic they were in all aspects. Many felt that far too little consultation with junior staff had taken place and there was generalized criticism of general practitioner trainees by their specializing counterparts, partly because of a perceived lack of commitment and partly because of blame of this group for the inception of the changes.

40|$|Background: Patients with {{indeterminate}} form of Chagas disease/cardiac normality (ICD/CN) exhibited normal electrocardiograms {{and chest}} X-rays; however, more sophisticated tests detected {{some degree of}} morphological and functional changes in the heart. Objective: To assess the prevalence of systolic and diastolic dysfunction of the right ventricle (RV) in patients with ICD/CN. Methods: This was a case&# 8211;control and prevalence study. Using Doppler two-dimensional echocardiography (2 D), 92 patients were assessed and divided into two groups: group I (normal, n = 31) and group II (ICD/CN, n = 61). Results: The prevalence of RV systolic dysfunction in patients in groups I and II was as follows: fractional area change (0. 0 % versus 0. 6 %), mobility of the tricuspid annulus (0. 0 % versus 0. 0 %), and S-wave tissue Doppler (6. 4 % versus 26. 0 %, p = 0. 016). The prevalence of global disorders such as the right myocardial performance index using tissue Doppler (16. 1 % versus 27. 8 %, p = 0. 099) and pulsed Doppler (61. 3 % versus 68 %, p = 0. 141) and diastolic disorders such as abnormal relaxation (0. 0 % versus 6. 0 %), pseudonormal pattern (0. 0 % versus 0. 0 %), and restrictive pattern (0. 0 % versus 0. 0 %) was not statistically different between groups. Conclusion: The prevalence of RV systolic dysfunction {{was estimated to be}} 26 % (S wave velocity compared with other variables), suggesting <b>incipient</b> <b>changes</b> in RV systolic function in the ICD/CN group...|$|R
40|$|Background: Cardiac insults such as ischemia, infarction, {{hypertrophy}} and dilatation {{are often}} accompanied by altered abundance and/or localization of the connexin 43 gap junction protein, which may predispose towards arrhythmic complications. Models of chronic dyssynchronous cardiac activation have {{also been shown to}} result in redistribution of connexin 43 in cardiomyocytes. We hypothesized that alterations in connexin 43 expression and localization in the mouse heart might be induced by ventricular pacing over a short period of time. Results: The subdiaphragmatic approach was used to pace a series of wild type mice for six hours before the hearts were removed for analysis. Mice were paced at 10 – 15 % above their average anesthetized sinus rate and monitored to ensure 1 : 1 capture. Short-term pacing resulted in a significant reduction in connexin 43 mRNA abundance, a partial redistribution of connexin 43 from the sarcolemma to a non-sarcolemmal fraction, and accumulation of ubiquitinated connexin 43 without a significant change in overall connexin 43 protein levels. These early pacing-induced changes in connexin 43 expression were not accompanied by decreased cardiac function, prolonged refractoriness or increased inducibility into sustained arrhythmias. Conclusion: Our data suggest that short-term pacing is associated with <b>incipient</b> <b>changes</b> in the expression of the connexin 43 gap junction, possibly including decreased production and a slowed rate of degradation. This murine model may facilitate the study of early molecular changes induced by pacing and may ultimately assist in the development of strategies to prevent gap junction remodeling and the associated arrhythmic complications of cardiac disease...|$|R
