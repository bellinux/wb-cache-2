25|$|The crew {{wait out}} the storm so they can restore {{communications}} and be rescued. As the crew struggles against the cold, they find an NTI has formed an animated column of water and is exploring the base. Though they treat it with curiosity, Coffey is agitated by it and cuts it in half by closing a pressure bulkhead on it, causing it to retreat. The crew soon realize that Coffey is suffering paranoia from high-pressure nervous syndrome. Spying on him through a remote operated vehicle, they find he and another SEAL are arming the warhead to attack the NTIs, and race to stop him. Bud fights Coffey but Coffey escapes in a mini-sub with the primed warhead, and Bud and Lindsey give chase in the other sub. Coffey is able to launch the warhead into the trench, but his sub is damaged and drifts {{over the edge of}} the trough, and he is crushed when the sub implodes from high pressures. The other mini-sub is also damaged and <b>is</b> <b>taking</b> <b>on</b> water; with only one functional diving suit, Lindsey opts to enter deep hypothermia when the ocean's cold water engulfs her, and Bud swims back with her body to the platform. There, he and the crew administer CPR and revive her, and Bud and Lindsey reaffirm their lost love.|$|E
500|$|... "An austringer [...] {{undertaking}} {{to train}} a sparrowhawk {{should be in}} doubt that he <b>is</b> <b>taking</b> <b>on</b> {{one of the most}} difficult hawks available." [...] A female Eurasian sparrowhawk is considered a bad choice for a novice and the male is very difficult and demanding, even for an experienced handler. They have been described as [...] "hysterical little hawks" [...] but are also praised as courageous and providing [...] "sport of the highest quality." [...] Philip Glasier describes Eurasian sparrowhawks as [...] "in many ways superior to hunting with a larger short-wing [...] " [...] and [...] "extremely hard to tame." [...] They are best suited for small quarry such as common starlings and common blackbirds but are also capable of taking common teal, Eurasian magpies, pheasants and partridges. A 19th century author remarked that this species was [...] "the best of all hawks for landrails", now known as corn crakes. In 1735, the Sportsman's Dictionary noted that [...] "... she will serve in the winter as well as in the summer, and will fly at all kind of game more than the falcon. If a winter sparrowhawk prove good, she will kill the pye, the chough, the jay, woodcock, thrush, black-bird, fieldfare, and divers other birds of the like nature." ...|$|E

India Hill of Teen Vogue wrote, [...] "When Beyoncé does something, you listen. Not just because her lyrics are infectious and her beats are always catchy, but because if she has something to say, you know it’s going to be important." [...] Megan Carpentier of The Guardian commented [...] "It is not an {{exaggeration to say that}} there is no other living musical artist who could ignite such a broad and unavoidable conversation just by releasing a new album – even a visual one, and it’s her second visual album – or who could turn an hour-long, visually narrative film for that album into a Saturday night watch-with-your-friends event on subscription cable channel." [...] Bill Condon, director of Beauty and the Beast, stated that the LEMONADE visuals in particular served as inspiration for the Beauty and the Beast film, commenting [...] "You look at Beyonce’s brilliant movie Lemonade, this genre <b>is</b> <b>taking</b> <b>on</b> so many different forms… I do think that this very old-school break-out-into-song traditional musical is something that people understand again and really want." [...] Beyoncé's music videos explore many different topics and themes such as women empowerment, depression, affairs, and racial injustice, including [...] "Formation" [...] and [...] "Pretty Hurts". Her self-titled visual album explores darker music videos such as [...] "Haunted", which drew comparisons to Madonna's Justify My Love". In 2017, she released the controversial music video for [...] "Formation", which includes representations of racial injustice against African Americans in the United States during the Black Lives Matter movement.|$|E

2500|$|The game, {{while in}} early access, has already {{received}} alternate gameplay modes created by players, determined by unenforceable rules that players agree to abide by, {{that have been}} popular with streamers. This was aided by a quiet release of custom server support {{to a number of}} influential streamers which subsequently made it into public release. In one case, [...] "Zombie Mode", all but four players pretend to be zombies, who may sometimes distinguish themselves by removing all clothing and are limited only to collecting melee weapons and consumable items, and must rush to attack the other four players, who are able to collect all gear and attempt to outrun and defeat the zombies. Inspired by this mode, Greene announced plans to introduce an official zombie-based gameplay mode based on this into Battlegrounds. Whereas {{most of the rest of}} the team continued to develop the core gameplay and maps, Greene <b>is</b> <b>taking</b> <b>on</b> the zombie mode as a near solo project, only using the assistance of the lead animator to help with the zombie animations. Greene sees Battlegrounds as a platform, and would like to see more custom game types and mods developed by players for it. Greene identified that some mods that he also previously worked on from ARMA 3 may become part of the Battlegrounds platform. To prevent cheating, the game uses the BattleEye anti-cheating software.|$|E
