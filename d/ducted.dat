5|$|The aerial robots vary {{in design}} from fixed wing airplanes, to {{conventional}} helicopters, to <b>ducted</b> fans, to airships, and beyond to bizarre hybrid creations. Because the competition focuses on fully autonomous behavior, the air vehicle itself is of less importance.|$|E
5|$|Teams {{choosing}} {{to develop new}} air vehicle types have never won, as they are disadvantaged in comparison to those which adapt existing, working, air vehicles, and can therefore concentrate on performing the mission rather than developing something that will fly at all. As a result, adaptations of conventional rotary wing and fixed wing entries {{have always been the}} overall winners, with airships and <b>ducted</b> fans a close second.|$|E
5|$|Aircraft {{themselves}} {{now have}} more sophisticated deicing systems {{that can be}} used on the ground and in the air. Many modern civil fixed wing transport aircraft, for example the Boeing 737, use anti-ice systems on the leading edge of wings, engine inlets and air data probes using warm air. This is bled from engines and is <b>ducted</b> into a cavity beneath the surface to be anti-iced. The warm air heats the surface up to a few degrees above freezing, preventing ice from forming. The system may operate autonomously, switching on and off as the aircraft enters and leaves icing conditions.|$|E
50|$|For <b>duct</b> sloping 0 {{degrees to}} 30 degrees, <b>duct</b> {{internal}} dust is 25% of <b>duct</b> cross section.

For <b>ducts</b> sloping 45 degrees to 85 degrees,duct internal dust is 5% of <b>duct</b> cross section, plus internal <b>duct</b> coating loads. For <b>ducts</b> sloping over 85 degrees.Because {{of the potential for}} high dust loading, most process ductwork is run at a 30 to 45 degree slope.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{experimental}} and numerical investigations of heat transfer and friction factor characteristics for laminar flow through a non-circular <b>duct</b> with twisted-tape have been presented. The non-circular <b>ducts</b> include square <b>duct</b> and hexagonal <b>duct.</b> The results of non-circular <b>ducts</b> are compared with circular <b>duct.</b> All the <b>ducts</b> under investigations have same hydraulic diameter. The twist ratios {{used for the}} experiments are (Y= 3. 5, 4. 5, 5. 5, 6. 5). Experiments and CFD investigations were carried out on square <b>duct,</b> hexagonal <b>duct</b> and circular <b>duct.</b> The result reveals that, both Nusselt number and friction factor increases as the side of non-circular <b>duct</b> increases. Maximum Nusselt number and friction factor is obtained in case of circular <b>duct</b> with twisted tape...|$|R
50|$|The common hepatic <b>duct</b> is the <b>duct</b> {{formed by}} the {{convergence}} of the right hepatic <b>duct</b> (which drains bile from the right functional lobe of the liver) and the left hepatic <b>duct</b> (which drains bile from the left functional lobe of the liver). The common hepatic <b>duct</b> then joins the cystic <b>duct</b> coming from the gallbladder to form the common bile <b>duct.</b> The <b>duct</b> is usually 6-8 cm length.|$|R
5|$|Blakeney Point has a mixed {{colony of}} about 500 harbour and grey seals. The harbour seals have their young between June and August, and the pups, which can swim almost immediately, {{may be seen}} on the mud flats. Grey seals breed in winter, between November and January; their young cannot swim until they have lost their first white coat, so they are {{restricted}} to dry land for their first three or four weeks, and can be viewed on the beach during this period. Grey seals colonised a site in east Norfolk in 1993, and started breeding regularly at Blakeney in 2001. It is possible that they now outnumber harbour seals off the Norfolk coast. Seal-watching boat trips run from Blakeney and Morston harbours, giving good views without disturbing the seals. The corpses of 24 female or juvenile harbour seals were found in the Blakeney area between March 2009 and August 2010, each with spirally cut wounds consistent with the animal having been drawn through a <b>ducted</b> propeller.|$|E
25|$|In 1977, {{a single}} {{standard}} BN-2 was re-engined with Dowty Rotol <b>ducted</b> fans. The <b>ducted</b> fan produced less noise than conventional propeller propulsion, some structural {{strengthening of the}} main wing spar at the root was required due to the extra weight. This aircraft was subject to 18 months of flying trials to test the suitability of the <b>ducted</b> fan {{as a means of}} reducing aircraft noise; these tests reportedly demonstrated a 20 decibel noise reduction as well as increased thrust and reduced pollution.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the methods}} to {{determine}} {{the performance of a}} heat sink is to use heat transfer and fluid dynamics theory. One such method has been published by Jeggels, et al., though this work is limited to <b>ducted</b> flow. <b>Ducted</b> flow is where the air is forced to flow through a channel which fits tightly over the heat sink. This makes sure that all the air goes through the channels formed by the fins of the heat sink. When the air flow is not <b>ducted,</b> a certain percentage of air flow will bypass the heat sink. Flow bypass was found to increase with increasing fin density and clearance, while remaining relatively insensitive to inlet duct velocity.|$|E
40|$|Endoscopic {{manometry}} {{was used}} to measure pancreatic <b>duct,</b> common bile <b>duct,</b> pancreatic <b>duct</b> sphincter and bile <b>duct</b> sphincter pressures in 43 healthy volunteers and 162 patients with a variety of papillary, pancreatic and biliary disorders. Common bile <b>duct</b> pressure was significantly raised after cholecystectomy, with common bile <b>duct</b> stones and papillary stenosis but pancreatic <b>duct</b> pressure only in papillary stenosis. After endoscopic sphincterotomy mean common bile <b>duct</b> pressure fell from 11. 2 to 1. 1 mmHg and pancreatic <b>duct</b> pressure from 18. 0 to 11. 2 mmHg. Distinct pancreatic <b>duct</b> sphincter and bile <b>duct</b> sphincter zones were identified as phasic pressures of 3 - 12 waves/minute on pull-through from pancreatic <b>duct</b> and common bile <b>duct</b> to duodenum. Pancreatic <b>duct</b> sphincter pressures were higher with common bile <b>duct</b> stones and stenosis whereas bile <b>duct</b> sphincter pressures were higher in pancreatitis and stenosis. Bile <b>duct</b> sphincter activity was present in 60 % of patients after surgical sphincteroplasty but 21 % of patients after endoscopic sphincterotomy. Endoscopic manometry facilitated the diagnosis of papillary stenosis, has allowed study of papillary pathophysiology and has shown a functional inter-relationship between the two sphincteric zones...|$|R

25|$|The {{aircraft}} has {{an unusual}} configuration with a fully glazed forward cabin, reminiscent of an Alouette helicopter, that provides 270Â° panoramic vision and almost vertical downward {{vision for the}} pilot and two passengers. The aircraft has twin booms with twin rudders and a high-mounted tailplane. It {{is powered by a}} Lycoming flat-six normally-aspirated engine situated behind the cabin and driving a fixed pitch <b>ducted</b> fan. Due to the <b>ducted</b> fan, the aircraft is exceptionally quiet. The aircraft has a fixed tricycle undercarriage with the nosewheel offset to the left. The wings are unswept and untapered.

25|$|In the 1960s, Hanno Fischer, Technical Director of Rhein-Flugzeugbau (RFB), {{developed}} {{an interest in}} aircraft powered by <b>ducted</b> fans integrated into the aircraft structure, flying two modified gliders as testbeds, a VFW-Fokker FK-3 fitted with an eight-bladed <b>ducted</b> fan in the rear fuselage, which flew as the Sirius I in 1969, and a Caproni Vizzola Calif A-21, which flew as the Sirius II on 16 December 1971. Based on the successful results of testing of these aircraft, RFB decided to start work on a two-seat ducted-fan military trainer, intended to offer jet-like handling at low cost, which became the RFB Fantrainer, while in 1972, RFB began studies on a two-seat light touring aircraft with side-by-side seating.|$|E
40|$|To {{clarify the}} anatomy of the {{pancreatic}} <b>duct</b> system and to investigate its embryology, we reviewed 256 pancreatograms with normal pancreatic head, 81 with pancreas divisum and 74 with pancreaticobiliary maljunction. Accessory pancreatograms {{were divided into two}} patterns. The long-type accessory pancreatic <b>duct</b> forms a straight line and joins the main pancreatic <b>duct</b> at the neck portion of the pancreas. The short-type accessory pancreatic <b>duct</b> joins the main pancreatic <b>duct</b> near its first inferior branch. The short-type accessory pancreatic <b>duct</b> is less likely to have a long inferior branch arising from the accessory pancreatic <b>duct.</b> The length of the accessory pancreatic <b>duct</b> from the orifice to the first long inferior branch was similar in the short- and long-type accessory pancreatic <b>ducts.</b> The first long inferior branch from the long-type accessory pancreatic <b>duct</b> passes though the main pancreatic <b>duct</b> near the origin of the inferior branch from the main pancreatic <b>duct.</b> Immunohistochemically, in the short-type accessory pancreatic <b>duct,</b> the main pancreatic <b>duct</b> between the junction with the short-type accessory pancreatic <b>duct</b> and the neck portion was located in the ventral pancreas. The long-type accessory pancreatic <b>duct</b> represents a continuation of the main <b>duct</b> of the dorsal pancreatic bud.

40|$|The local heat {{transfer}} and pressure drop characteristics of developing turbulent flows of air in three stationary ribbed square <b>ducts</b> {{have been investigated}} experimentally. These are: ribbed square <b>duct</b> with constant cross-section (straight <b>duct),</b> ribbed divergent square <b>duct</b> and ribbed convergent square <b>duct.</b> The convergent/divergent <b>duct</b> has an inclination angle of 1 Â°. The measurement was conducted {{within the range of}} Reynolds numbers from 10 000 to 77 000. The {{heat transfer}} performance of the divergent/convergent <b>ducts</b> is compared with the ribbed straight <b>duct</b> under three constraints: identical mass flow rate, identical pumping power and identical pressure drop. Because of the streamwise flow acceleration or deceleration, the local heat transfer characteristics of the divergent and convergent <b>ducts</b> quite {{different from those of the}} straight <b>duct.</b> In the straight <b>duct,</b> the fluid flow and heat transfer become fully developed after 2 - 3 ribs, while in the divergent and convergent <b>ducts</b> there is no such trend.
