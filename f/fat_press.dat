40|$|International audienceIn this paper, the {{performances}} of three industrial biofilters treating rendering odorous emissions and the packing material evolution are presented and discussed. The biofilters were packed {{with a mixture of}} peat and heather, treating about 50 000 m 3. h- 1 of rendering gases which presented typical odorous concentrations ranging from 1 350 to 22 000 OU. m- 3 for ambient air from industrial facilities, and from 13 000 to 184 000 for processes gas (mixture of non-condensable and air from <b>fat</b> <b>presses).</b> During the two first months of running, the packing material has shown a rapid compaction of 30 to 40 cm, representing a 20 to 26. 7 % reduction of the volume. pH of biofilters were compared to new material, showing a drastic acidification in the deeper part. The bacterial count on PCA medium showed that bacterial density depends on the packing pH, which also induces a selection of micro-organism species. The low colonization (inferior to 9. 4 x 104 CFU. g- 1) {{can be explained by the}} lack of inoculation at biofilter start-up, the lack of nutrients supply and by acidic pH...|$|R
25|$|One series Wagner and Grant did {{continue}} writing together was The Bogie Man, about an escaped mental patient who thinks he's Humphrey Bogart, or rather {{a composite of}} the characters he played, and constructs imaginary cases by associating random events with events in Bogart films. They had previously pitched the series, unsuccessfully, to DC before writing Outcasts. It was first published as a four-part miniseries by the Scottish independent <b>Fat</b> Man <b>Press</b> in 1989, intending to tie in with Glasgow's position as European City of Culture in 1990, and further stories followed from other publishers.|$|R

5000|$|The {{title was}} {{initially}} pitched to DC Comics but after they refused it, Wagner and Grant {{then decided to}} publish it independently with <b>Fat</b> Man <b>Press,</b> a publishing company based in Glasgow. A four issue black and white miniseries was published, beginning in 1989 to tie in with Glasgow being the 1990 European City of Culture, in which Clunie, newly escaped from a Glasgow mental hospital, stumbles on an attempt by small-time criminals to fence some stolen turkeys. Associating the [...] "big birds" [...] with The Maltese Falcon, Clunie drags a gullible waitress and the nearest convenient [...] "fat man" [...] into proceedings, until, pursued by the criminals and the police and quoting dialogue {{from a variety of}} Bogart films, he demolishes half of Glasgows Central Station.

40|$|Ground turkey {{samples were}} {{prepared}} with different fat levels, fat types, percent mechanically deboned meat and grind. All samples were analyzed at three different time-intervals. Samples {{were evaluated by}} chemical, sensory, and physical measurements, in term of stability, water content, <b>fat</b> content, <b>press</b> fluid, water loss, flavor, texture, and hedonic values. Significant differences were determined by analysis of variance. Coarse ground (5 / 82 ̆ 2) samples showed significantly higher TBA numbers, fat content, total loss, and juiciness. Water content, flavor scores, amount of press fluid, texture scores, and hedonic scores were lower {{when compared to the}} fine and medium ground samples. Results of adding different percents deboned meat showed that TBA number and water content increased as the percent deboned meat increased. Decreases in flavor score, <b>fat</b> content, <b>press</b> fluid, total loss, and juiciness were obtained with increased percent deboned meats. However, sensory panelists preferred the samples with 10 percent added deboned meat to other deboned levels regardless of grind. The results of adding different types and levels of fat indicated that samples containing vegetable fat had the lowest TBA numbers while the samples containing beef fat showed the highest value. As the level of fat and length of storage increased, TBA numbers increased significantly. Sensory panel scores for juiciness and press fluid of the individual treatments fluctuated with level of added fat. As the fat levels were increased, juiciness scores and the amount of press fluids increased significantly. Loss due to cooking and thawing was highest for samples containing vegetable fat and lowest for samples containing pork fat. An increase in total loss was observed as fat levels were increased. Samples with turkey and beef fat received the high texture scores. The low texture scores appeared as the level of any type of fat increased. All samples with 10 percent added fat received the highest s core for overall acceptability...|$|R

5000|$|Materials {{that for}} {{aesthetic}} or sanitary reasons are {{not suitable for}} human food are the feedstocks for inedible rendering processes. Much of the inedible raw material is rendered using the [...] "dry" [...] method. This may be a batch or a continuous {{process in which the}} material is heated in a steam-jacketed vessel to drive off the moisture and simultaneously release the fat from the fat cells. The material is first ground, then heated to release the fat and drive off the moisture, percolated to drain off the free fat, and then more <b>fat</b> is <b>pressed</b> out of the solids, which at this stage are called [...] "cracklings" [...] or [...] "dry-rendered tankage". The cracklings are further ground to make meat and bone meal. A variation on a dry process involves finely chopping the material, fluidizing it with hot fat, and then evaporating the mixture in one or more evaporator stages. Some inedible rendering is done using a wet process, which is generally a continuous process similar in some ways to that used for edible materials. The material is heated with added steam and then pressed to remove a water-fat mixture which is then separated into fat, water and fine solids by stages of centrifuging and/or evaporation. The solids from the press are dried and then ground into meat and bone meal. Most independent renderers process only inedible material.|$|R
40|$|The {{fatty acids}} from cocoa butters of {{different}} origins, varieties, and suppliers {{and a number}} of cocoa butter equivalents (Illexao 30 - 61, Illexao 30 - 71, Illexao 30 - 96, Choclin, Coberine, Chocosine-Illipe, Chocosine-Shea, Shokao, Akomax, Akonord, and Ertina) were investigated by bulk stable carbon isotope analysis and compound specific isotope analysis. The interpretation is based on principal component analysis combining the fatty acid concentrations and the bulk and molecular isotopic data. The scatterplot of the two first principal components allowed detection of the addition of vegetable fats to cocoa butters. Enrichment in heavy carbon isotope (C- 13) of the bulk cocoa butter and of the individual fatty acids is related to mixing with other vegetable fats and possibly to thermally or oxidatively induced degradation during processing (e. g., drying and roasting of the cocoa beans or deodorization of the <b>pressed</b> <b>fat)</b> or storage. The feasibility of the analytical approach for authenticity assessment is discussed...|$|R

The {{combined}} {{effects of}} exercise and ingestion of a meal replacement {{in conjunction with a}} weight loss supplement on body composition and fitness parameters in college-aged men and women. J Strength Cond Res 25 (1) : 51 – 60, 2011 —This study was performed to evaluate the combined effect of a meal replacement and an alleged weight loss supplement (WLS) on body composition, fitness parameters, and clinical health in moderately overweight college-aged men and women. Body mass, bench press 1 repetition maximum (1 RM), leg press 1 RM, body composition, _ VO 2 max, fasting glucose (GLU), and lipid panels were evaluated before (T 1) and after (T 2) 8 weeks of combined resistance training (RT) and cardiovascular training (CVT). After T 1, subjects were randomly assigned in a double-blind fashion to either the WLS (6 men, 7 women; 2165 years, 168 68 cm, 75. 4612. 7 kg, 31. 6 67. 7 %BFAT) or placebo (PLA: 6 men, 6 women; 22 6 4 years, 174 6 9 cm, 84. 1 6 8. 8 kg, 30. 2 6 5. 6 %BFAT) group. Both groups performed 3 d_wk 21 of combined progressive RT (2 3 12 reps of 8 exercises at 75 – 80 % 1 RM) and CVT (30 minutes on a cycle ergometer at 70 – 85 % heart rate reserve). Subjects consumed 4 capsules per day and a once-daily meal replacement throughout the protocol. Percent body <b>fat,</b> bench <b>press</b> 1 RM, and leg press 1 RM significantly improved (p, 0. 05) in both groups. Blood GLU (G 3 T; p = 0. 048) improved in WLS and systolic blood pressure (SBP) approached significance (G 3 T; p = 0. 06) in the WLS group. Follow-up analysis of SBP revealed a significant within-group decrease in the WLS group, whereas no within-group changes were found for either group for GLU. Practically speaking, daily supplementation with a meal replacement and a thrice weekly exercise program can increase fitness levels and improve body composition, whereas adding a thermogenic substance provides no additional benefit over fitness or body composition changes but may favorably alter serum markers of clinical health...|$|R
40|$|Changes in the physico-chemical {{properties}} and microstructure of milk fat globules were investigated during the manufacture and ripening of Emmental cheese. The measurement of fat globule size and apparent zeta-potential showed {{that they were}} slightly affected during cheese milk preparation, i. e. storage of cheese milk overnight at 4 °C and pasteurisation. After rennet-induced coagulation and heating of curd grains, coalescence caused the formation of large fat globules (i. e. > 10 μm). The structure of fat in Emmental cheese was characterised in situ using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). The rennet-induced coagulation lead {{to the formation of}} a continuous network of casein strands in which fat globules of various sizes were entrapped. Heating of curd grains induced the formation of <b>fat</b> globule aggregates. <b>Pressing</b> of the curd grains resulted in the greatest disruption of milk fat globules, their coalescence, the formation of non-globular fat (free fat) and the release of the milk fat globule membrane (MFGM) material. This study showed that milk fat exists in three main forms in ripened Emmental cheese: (i) small fat globules enveloped by the MFGM; (ii) aggregates of partially disrupted fat globules and (iii) free fat, resulting from the disruption of the MFGM and allowing free triacylglycerols to fill voids in the protein matrix. The curd grain junctions formed in Emmental cheese were also characterised using CLSM: they are compact structures, rich in protein and devoid of fat globules...|$|R

6000|$|For Mr. Tulliver {{was in a}} {{position}} neither new nor striking, but, like other every-day things, sure to have a cumulative effect that will be felt in the long run: he was held to be a much more substantial man than he really was. And as we are all apt to believe what the world believes about us, it was his habit to think of failure and ruin with the same sort of remote pity with which a spare, long-necked man hears that his plethoric short-necked neighbor is stricken with apoplexy. He had been always used to hear pleasant jokes about his advantages as a man who worked his own mill, and owned a pretty bit of land; and these jokes naturally kept up his sense that {{he was a man of}} considerable substance. They gave a pleasant flavor to his glass on a market-day, and if it had not been for the recurrence of half-yearly payments, Mr. Tulliver would really have forgotten that there was a mortgage of two thousand pounds on his very desirable freehold. That was not altogether his own fault, since one of the thousand pounds was his sister's fortune, which he had to pay on her marriage; and a man who has neighbors that will go to law with him is not likely to pay off his mortgages, especially if he enjoys the good opinion of acquaintances who want to borrow a hundred pounds on security too lofty to be represented by parchment. Our friend Mr. Tulliver had a good-natured fibre in him, and did not like to give harsh refusals even to his sister, who had not only come in to the world in that superfluous way characteristic of sisters, creating a necessity for mortgages, but had quite thrown herself away in marriage, and had crowned her mistakes by having an eighth baby. On this point Mr. Tulliver was conscious of being a little weak; but he apologized to himself by saying that poor Gritty had been a good-looking wench before she married Moss; he would sometimes say this even with a slight tremulousness in his voice. But this morning he was in a mood more becoming a man of business, and in the course of his ride along the Basset lanes, with their deep ruts,--lying so far away from a market-town that the labor of drawing produce and manure was enough to take away the best part of the profits on such poor land as that parish was made of,--he got up a due amount of irritation against Moss as a man without capital, who, if murrain and blight were abroad, was sure to have his share of them, and who, the more you tried to help him out of the mud, would sink the further in. It would do him good rather than harm, now, if he were obliged to raise this three hundred pounds; it would make him look about him better, and not act so foolishly about his wool this year as he did the last; in fact, Mr. Tulliver had been too easy with his brother-in-law, and because he had let the interest run on for two years, Moss was likely enough to think that he should never be troubled about the principal. But Mr. Tulliver was determined not to encourage such shuffling people any longer; and a ride along the Basset lanes was not likely to enervate a man's resolution by softening his temper. The deep-trodden hoof-marks, made in the muddiest days of winter, gave him a shake now and then which suggested a rash but stimulating snarl at the father of lawyers, who, whether by means of his hoof or otherwise, had doubtless something to do with this state of the roads; and the abundance of foul land and neglected fences that met his eye, though they made no part of his brother Moss's farm, strongly contributed to his dissatisfaction with that unlucky agriculturist. If this wasn't Moss's fallow, it might have been; Basset was all alike; it was a beggarly parish, in Mr. Tulliver's opinion, and his opinion was certainly not groundless. Basset had a poor soil, poor roads, a poor non-resident landlord, a poor non-resident vicar, and rather less than half a curate, also poor. If any one strongly impressed with the power of the human mind to triumph over circumstances will contend that the parishioners of Basset might nevertheless have been a very superior class of people, I have nothing to urge against that abstract proposition; I only know that, in point of fact, the Basset mind was in strict keeping with its circumstances. The muddy lanes, green or clayey, that seemed to the unaccustomed eye to lead nowhere but into each other, did really lead, with patience, to a distant high-road; but there were many feet in Basset which they led more frequently to a centre of dissipation, spoken of formerly as the [...] "Markis o' Granby," [...] but among intimates as [...] "Dickison's." [...] A large low room with a sanded floor; a cold scent of tobacco, modified by undetected beer-dregs; Mr. Dickison leaning against the door-post with a melancholy pimpled face, looking as irrelevant to the daylight as a last night's guttered candle,--all this may not seem a very seductive form of temptation; but the majority of men in Basset found it fatally alluring when encountered on their road toward four o'clock on a wintry afternoon; and if any wife in Basset wished to indicate that her husband was not a pleasure-seeking man, she could hardly do it more emphatically than by saying that he didn't spend a shilling at Dickison's from one Whitsuntide to another. Mrs. Moss had said so of her husband more than once, when her brother was in a mood to find fault with him, as he certainly was to-day. And nothing could be less pacifying to Mr. Tulliver than the behavior of the farmyard gate, which he no sooner attempted to push open with his riding-stick than it acted as gates without the upper hinge are known to do, to the peril of shins, whether equine or human. He was about to get down and lead his horse through the damp dirt of the hollow farmyard, shadowed drearily by the large half-timbered buildings, up to the long line of tumble-down dwelling-houses standing on a raised causeway; but the timely appearance of a cowboy saved him that frustration of a plan he had determined on,--namely, not to get down from his horse during this visit. If a man means to be hard, let him keep in his saddle and speak from that height, above the level of pleading eyes, and with the command of a distant horizon. Mrs. Moss heard the sound of the horse's feet, and, when her brother rode up, was already outside the kitchen door, with a half-weary smile on her face, and a black-eyed baby in her arms. Mrs. Moss's face bore a faded resemblance to her brother's; baby's little <b>fat</b> hand, <b>pressed</b> against her cheek, seemed to show more strikingly that the cheek was faded.|$|R
