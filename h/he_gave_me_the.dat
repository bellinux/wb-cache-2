25|$|I {{have not}} seen Chas. Greville's book, but have read {{a good deal of}} it. It is a social outrage. And {{committed}} by one who was always talking of what he called ‘perfect gentlemen.’ I don't think he can figure now in that category. I knew him intimately. He was the vainest being—I don't limit myself to man—that ever existed; and I don't forget Cicero and Lytton Bulwer; but Greville wd. swallow garbage, and required it. Offended selflove is a key to most of his observations. He lent me a volume of his MS. once to read; more modern than these; I found, when he was not scandalous, he was prolix and prosy—a clumsy, wordy writer. The loan was made à propos of the character of Peel, which I drew in George Bentinck's Life, and which, I will presume to say, is the only thing written about Peel wh. has any truth or stuff in it. Greville was not displeased with it, and as a reward, and a treat, told me that he wd. confide to me his character of Peel, and <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> sacred volume, wh. I bore with me, with trembling awe, from Bruton St. to Grosr Gate. If ever it appears, you, who have taste for style and expression, will, I am sure, agree with me that, as a portrait painter, Greville is not a literary Vandyke or Reynolds; a more verbose, indefinite, unwieldy affair, without a happy expression, never issued from the pen of a fagged subordinate of the daily press.|$|E
500|$|I {{definitely}} don't go {{the straight}} and narrow path, and you know, I definitely kinda like to experiment and collaborate. And so, I think it's taken me and Max this long to work together because of that, because what he does is genius and he is a classic hitmaker. But when I was coming out it was {{at a time when we}} had the huge pop explosion, and he was all over radio and I just wanted to work with others like Linda Perry and do that route and do [...] "Beautiful" [...] and songs like that. We built a level of respect for each other. So at this point, coming together, especially embracing my true pop-starness, at this point in my career having come full circle, I was able to really truly embrace it, and embrace him. <b>He</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> freedom to really sing on these songs, and have a little more creative freedom because I heard he is a stickler for melody and a melody king and I was scared, I was like 'Oh my God! I won't be able to collaborate here.' But he couldn't have been more great, and this is a really fun song, super up-tempo. It's probably the most dancey-ish song on my record, but it's called 'Let There Be Love' but it's free and representative of what this album is about.|$|E
500|$|Apple and NeXT {{marketing}} executive and Jobs' confidant in the film. When discussing her audition for the film, Winslet later commented that she [...] "heard about {{it through a}} crew member who I happened {{to be working with}} , I didn't even care what role it was. I just wanted to be in it. Found out the nature of the role. Googled [...] Found one picture of her. Got my husband to go to a wig shop. Buy a short-haired dark wig. Stuck it on my head. Sent a photograph of myself to [...] Scott Rudin. Danny Boyle came to Melbourne and we had a meeting and <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> part." [...] Winslet spent considerable time with Joanna Hoffman to prepare for the role before production began. She noted that Hoffman [...] "has a softness to her. She came to America as a young woman and achieved a great deal. One thing that was unique about her as a figure in Steve's life was that she didn't need anything from him. She just needed for him to be the best version of himself. And that's what really set their relationship apart from any relationship with all his other colleagues." [...] Winslet credits Hoffman's difficult childhood (that began in Armenia) with her ability to manage Jobs. [...] On {{the nature of the relationship}} between Hoffman and Jobs, Winslet said that she and Fassbender [...] "were able to develop as literally co-workers. I do believe it was very similar to the relationship that Steve and Joanna had. She was like his work wife. She was head of marketing for the Macintosh, and then she stayed with him for his working life. She was an extraordinary, feisty Eastern European person who was pretty much the only person who could actually knock sense into Steve, and she was also kind of an emotional compass." [...] In developing her sense of the character, Winslet stated that she [...] "just wanted to please [...] as much as I could. How she sounds, and her accent, is fairly complicated. She grew up largely in Armenia, spent some time in Poland, and has Russians in her family, so she has all three accents, but she's been in America since she was a teenager, so she had American rhythms. You know, she really has this accent that goes way up and down. It's almost impossible to copy because of just how singsongy it becomes. So I had to put it into my own register. But we were all doing accents. I mean, Michael's Irish, and he's playing Steve Jobs, for God's sake." [...] Finally, Winslet notes that Hoffman [...] "did genuinely love [...] And spending time with her, when I was figuring out how to play this difficult part, she would become very emotional. She misses him terribly." ...|$|E

2500|$|Jonathan Winters {{became his}} [...] "idol" [...] early in life; Williams {{first saw him}} on {{television}} at age 8 and paid him homage in interviews throughout his career. Williams was inspired by Winters's ingenuity, realizing, he said, [...] "that anything is possible, that anything is funny <b>He</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> idea {{that it can be}} free-form, that you can go in and out of things pretty easily." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to Stephen Shore's [...] "Factory: Andy Warhol," [...] "Andy and I {{were hanging}} around together. I had an {{apartment}} on the Lower East Side, where I had haircutting salons. Hundreds of people would come, and I’d be cutting someone's hair. Andy came. When he first started making films, he made films about what a person was famous for," [...] Billy, whose real name was William Linich Jr., and {{was the son of}} a barber, recalled. [...] "I was famous for giving haircuts, so he said, [...] "Would you let me do a film of you doing haircuts?" [...] I had covered my entire apartment in silver foil and painted everything silver. Andy said, [...] "Well, I just got a new loft would you do to it what you’ve done to your apartment?" [...] I said, [...] "Oh, sure, let's do it." [...] So, I started doing it. I was a technician— I’d been a light designer for [...] the Judson Church. I also worked for some off-Broadway theater and avant-garde dance companies. I installed all the lighting at the Factory, all the sound systems." [...] In return for making over his loft, Warhol gave Name a new role within the Factory. [...] "I was into light and sound before, but not photography," [...] Name said. [...] "Andy had a still camera, but he had gotten the Bolex. He was going to start to do films, and <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> Pentax and said, [...] "Here, Billy, you do the still photography; I’m going to start making films." [...] I became the in-house photographer and was sort of like the foreman. Eventually I moved in." [...] Name and Warhol eventually became lovers, but the romantic aspect of their relationship slowly dissolved into mutual loyalty and admiration.|$|E

2500|$|Anscombe also {{introduced}} {{the idea of}} a set of facts being 'brute relative to' some fact. When a set of facts xyz stands in this relation to a fact A, they are a subset out of a range some subset among which holds if A holds. Thus if A is the fact that I have paid for something, the brute facts might be that I have handed him a cheque for a sum which he has named as the price for the goods, saying that this is the payment, or that I gave him some cash at the time that <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> goods. There tends, according to Anscombe, to be an institutional context which gives its point to the description 'A', but of which 'A' is not itself a description: that I have given someone a shilling is not a description of the institution of money or of the currency of the country. According to her, no brute facts xyz can generally be said to entail the fact A relative to which they are 'brute' except with the proviso [...] "under normal circumstances", for [...] "one cannot mention all the things that were not the case, which would have made a difference if they had been." [...] A set facts xyz... may be brute relative to a fact A which itself is one of a set of facts ABC... which is brute relative to some further fact W. Thus brute facts are not a distinct class of facts, to be distinguished from another class, 'institutional facts': the essential concept to grasp here is that of a set of facts being 'brute relative to' some fact. The term 'brute facts' had a major role to play in John Searle's philosophy of speech acts and institutional reality.|$|E
