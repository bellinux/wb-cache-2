5|$|Cameron began acting at age nine, and {{his first}} job was in an {{advertisement}} for a breakfast cereal. His first starring role was at age 13, in the television series Two Marriages. At this age, he appeared in several television shows and films. He became famous in 1985 after being cast as Mike Seaver in the ABC television sitcom Growing Pains. In the series, Mike would eventually <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>girlfriend</b> named Kate MacDonald, played by Chelsea Noble, Cameron's future wife. Cameron subsequently became a teen heartthrob in the late 1980s, while appearing {{on the covers of}} several teen magazines, including Tiger Beat, Teen Beat, 16 and others. At the time, he was making $50,000 a week. He was also in a 60-second Pepsi commercial during Super Bowl XXIV.|$|E
5|$|He later {{spoke on}} the {{background}} of the album's sound, saying, I'm 28 years old, and I see that I'm kind of in this weird position. I don't have many friends in my personal life, but I have so many fans. So when I go outside and people recognize me, it's kind of a bittersweet feeling, like I don't recognize the fans. I don't really have it like they probably think I have it. I'm really still a loser guy, but I'm just really popular now. I don't <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>girlfriend</b> no more, and I have this money, but I'm not satisfied with my life. It's this weird feeling of being incomplete, and I need to find myself. So that's kind of what it did to me, and the album just came out with me just fucking rapping some dark shit.|$|E

500|$|Similar to the {{previous}} two installments, the film was told in the human point-of-view to engage the audience. Bay wanted Sam to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>girlfriend</b> like {{in the first two}} films. Actor Shia LaBeouf said that Sam and Mikaela had become [...] "one character" [...] and, although he would [...] "miss" [...] Megan Fox, with this change [...] "you have discovery again from a new perspective."

500|$|Bassist Mark Hoppus penned [...] "Adam's Song" [...] to vent these {{frustrations and}} the {{loneliness}} he experienced on the tour; {{while the other}} members had longtime girlfriends to return home to, Hoppus was single.

[...] "You hang out with all your bros and it's a great time and everything, but everybody wants {{to come home and}} <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>girlfriend.</b> And every time we'd fly home, Tom and [...] Scott [...] always had girlfriends waiting for them at the airport, and I didn't.

500|$|A main {{objective}} planned for The King of Fighters '95 was to introduce Iori properly as Kyo's rival. Creators have stated Iori's personality, {{and other aspects}} of his character such as his phrases and unique moves, [...] "broke the mold for characters in fighting games at that time" [...] Like Kyo, several aspects of Iori, including his surname and abilities, were designed to relate him to the Yamata no Orochi legend, which was the inspiration for the plot. After observing fan reactions at initial location testing for King of Fighters '95, several staff members predicted that Iori would be popular on his release. One of them was happy that at an event for The King of Fighters XIII on March 25, 2010, several fans reminded him that it was Iori's birthday according to his official profile. Iori is a berserker due to the Orochi demon blood within him. This version of him, officially named [...] "Orochi Iori", is hinted to have existed before his debut in The King of Fighters '97 as one of the game's mid bosses. This form of Iori was designed specifically to overpower other characters easily. Series' flagship director, Toyohisa Tanabe, states that the staff was initially reluctant to add this version of Iori to the series' roster—worried about fans' reactions—but did so to add more impact to the Orochi saga's climax. He was particularly pleased to see surprised reactions from female fans to this form during KOF '97s location testing. Another minor development of his character was his change of [...] "most valued possession/valued treasure" [...] information. A girlfriend was also listed more than once, specifically in The King of Fighters '95, The King of Fighters '99, and The King of Fighters 2000. However, starting with The King of Fighters 2001 and every entry after, the space is listed as [...] "None". The SNK staff commented that it is curious that he does not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>girlfriend</b> anymore.|$|E

2500|$|In May 1978 Forster's first {{recorded}} work was the group's debut single, [...] "Lee Remick", {{which appeared in}} September. It was a paean to the Hollywood actress of the same name. Forster later recalled [...] "I didn't <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>girlfriend</b> or any sort of romantic side to my life ... I {{wanted to write a}} love song. But who was I in love with? No-one. I had to find someone and I found Lee Remick". He also wrote the B-side, [...] "Karen", as an ode to the university's library staff, [...] "here was kindness in the library, then you walk out of the library into the harsh real world". Forster then wrote their second single, [...] "People Say". According to Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, both singles were [...] "sparsely produced, poorly played yet passionately performed folksy, post-punk pop songs. They were sunny, catchy and hopelessly romantic, earning the band immediate local and international acclaim".|$|E
