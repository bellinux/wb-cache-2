5|$|Woolfolk {{worked for}} over 20 years in various real estate ventures. His real estate {{experience}} began in 1985 {{as an independent}} owner and operator of rental properties in Houston, {{while he was still}} playing for the Oilers. In 1992, as co-owner of New Choice Builders, Woolfolk began building affordable single-family housing in Houston's revitalized communities. In 1994, Woolfolk worked with Home Ownership Partners, Inc., to build affordable housing for residents of Fort Bend County, Texas, a suburban county outside of Houston. Woolfolk procured the largest HUD grant given at that time by Fort Bend County for affordable housing assistance. Starting in approximately 1995, Woolfolk worked for Intrepid Holdings, Inc. in Houston. At Intrepid, he developed residential lots for several large builders including US <b>Home,</b> <b>Gateway</b> Homes, Texas Colonial, and KB Home.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—An {{increasing}} number of households {{is connected to the}} Internet via DSL or cable, for which <b>home</b> <b>gateways</b> are required. The optimization of these – caused by their large number – is a promising area for energy efficiency improvements. Since no power models for <b>home</b> <b>gateways</b> are currently available, the optimization of their power state is not possible. This paper presents PowerPi, a power consumption model for the Raspberry Pi which is used as a substitute to conventional <b>home</b> <b>gateways</b> to derive the impact of typical hardware components on the energy consumption. The different power states of the platform are measured and a power model is derived, allowing to estimate the power consumption based on CPU and network utilization only. The proposed power model estimates the power consumption resulting in a RMSE of less than 3. 3 %, which is slightly larger than the maximum error of the measurements of 2. 5 %. I...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we focus on}} a Residential Community Network (RCN) in which the various <b>home</b> <b>gateways</b> have (limited) caching capabilities, can be shared among the users, and can exploit multi-hop {{wireless}} paths {{to communicate with each}} other. We analyse such a RCN from an energy-aware perspective, investigating its energy-saving potential in delivering the contents to the end users. To this aim, we define a resource allocation and routing scheme and, by means of an integer linear programming model, we solve to optimality the problem of associating the user terminals to the <b>home</b> <b>gateways</b> and computing the data flow paths. Accordingly, the resulting allocation pattern can serve as an upper bound for the global "greening" capability of the RCN.

40|$|Abstract—Residential {{broadband}} gateways (comprising modem, router, and WiFi access point), though individually consuming only 5 - 10 Watts of power, {{are significant}} contributors to overall network energy consumption due to large deployment numbers. Moreover, <b>home</b> <b>gateways</b> are typically always on, {{so as to}} provide continuous on-line presence to household devices for VoIP, smart metering, security surveillance, medical monitoring, etc. A natural solution for reducing the energy consumption of <b>home</b> <b>gateways</b> is to leverage the overlap of WiFi networks common in urban environments and aggregate user traffic on to fewer gateways, thus putting the remaining to sleep. In this paper we propose, evaluate, and prototype an architecture that overcomes significant challenges in making this solution feasible at large-scale. We advocate a centralized approach, whereby a single authority co-ordinates the <b>home</b> <b>gateways</b> to maximize energy savings in a fair manner. Our solution can be implemented across heterogeneous ISPs, avoids client-side modifications (thus encompassing arbitrary user de-vices and operating systems), and permits explicit control of session migrations. We apply our solution to WiFi traces collected in a building with 30 access points and 25, 000 client connections, and evaluate via simulation the trade-offs between energy savings, session disruptions, and fairness. We then prototype our system on commodity WiFi access points, test it in a two-storey building emulating 6 residences, and demonstrate radio energy reduction of over 60 % with little impact on user experience.
