Because the LNG’s volume is only 1 / 600 of the gaseous’s one, this kind of fuel is more beneficial for distant transportation and storage, and finds an extensive application. With the rapid economic development in this country and the increasing demand for clean energy, LNG lays a good foundation for the advance of fuel industry owing to its features such as high transport efficiency, wide application, low cost in gas supply, quick effectiveness and convenience. Nowadays the Chinese’s LNG industry is vigorously developing; and over 40 LNG gasification stations have been built and put in use. So LNG will {{play an important role in}} the sustainabl...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Fire {{is one of}} {{the major}} hazards which may occur due to natural or {{man-made}} causes. In general, fires may be classified into five categories depending on the fuel that is burning. In recent times, there is an increase in incidences of fires in urban population due to very densely populated areas. The losses associated due to fires can be classified as loss to the life of structure, loss of human life and loss to property. It was observed that many options are available which help in early detection of fire and minimizing the losses. Smoke detectors and fire fighting equipments were studied for a public building i. e. an educational institution. Analysis of fire loads of different compartments and providing sufficient number of fire fighting equipments can help in reducing the severity of fires. The fire loads and fire densities were analyzed at some locations to determine the requirements of fire fighting equipments. The paper includes study of various types of fire detection, alarm and fire fighting systems and systematic analysis of fire loads and densities for an educational building. rate that controlling it by means of only sprinklers may not be possible necessitating the use of <b>fire-extinguishers.</b> The spread of fire depends mainly on the availability of oxygen and fuel for the fire. Since, both are present in abundance in any building, it is of prime importance to control the fire as soon as possible in order to minimize the resulting losses to life and property. Based on the fuel that is burning, fires can be classified into five different categories as shown in table 1. Fire fighting systems can be either internal or external. External systems are external to the structure or building such as fire hydrants provided by the local authorities to fight fires. Internal systems are those provided within the building or structure to control fires such as smoke detectors, alarms and sprinklers...|$|R
50|$|Hydro-Man {{is able to}} bodily {{transform}} {{himself into}} a watery liquid substance; he can access secure areas and small openings with relative ease; when his bodily mass is dispersed in this form it simply reforms, albeit slowly depending on how far apart the mass was. All of Hydro-Man's cells remain fully under his control when {{he is in his}} liquid state. Hydro-Man can also merge with and manipulate larger bodies of water when he is in his water form. He can increase his mass and cause tidal waves and tsunamis. He can turn parts of his body to liquid while retaining the rest of his human form, allowing him to slip from a foe's grasp or have projectiles like bullets harmlessly pass through him. Through great mental exertion, Hydro-Man can also turn into steam. Other examples of manipulating his watery form include firing off small streams such as a fire hose, shaping parts of his body into 'solid-water', constructs, and mixing himself with other compounds for different effects. However, this last example to defeat Hydro-Man can be using other compounds against him, since certain substances can either harden him (like cement or concrete), or make him feel sick (such as <b>fire-extinguishers</b> and chlorine). The Wizard enhanced his powers, through the use of sophisticated equipment. These artificial enhancements granted him increased and more precise control over bodies of water and moisture near him, which he demonstrated by absorbing nearly all the moisture in the Trapster's body. However, Spider-Man teamed up with Iceman and used Iceman's powers to solidify him into ice. Hydro-Man claims that he has not aged since he gained his powers. Hydro-Man possesses a certain degree of superhuman strength, and {{has been shown to be}} an exceptionally skilled fighter, and adept at using his powers for that purpose. In some incarnations, depending on the writer, Hydro-Man can form his forearms into weapons such as Sandman does, except that Bench's weapons are made of water. Bench has extensive experience in street-fighting techniques due to his experience as a criminal before his transformation. Though cunning, he has been consistently depicted by writers as a low tier henchman with little formal education and is often tricked into using his powers in ways that incapacitate him (as explained above). His normal attire consists of a black shirt and blue/or green pants, as well as a costume invented by the Wizard.|$|R

40|$|Ten {{persons were}} {{in need of}} help after a fire started along the main road in Kiruna {{underground}} mine. They were located at different levels of the mine. The fire department’s capacity of handling underground fires was tested, but the rescue operation was still successful. An underground mine can consist of many and long drifts, and a fire underground differ from a fire in a building. Mainly it is the smoke and the reduced visibility that are the risks underground, and it is hard to predict the smoke spread. The purpose with this thesis is to combine the fire protection in an underground mine with a plausible rescue operation. This will be done by reviewing the relevance of the current regulations and evaluate the risks and possible measures. During the work five interviews have been performed and also four smoke spread simulations in LKAB:s mine in Kiruna where performed using the program Ventsim. Ventsim is a program that is used for simulating ventilation in a mine by building a virtual model of the drifts of the mine. The current fire protection in an underground mine primarily consists of rescue chambers, alarm, sprinkled areas, sectioning, education, handheld <b>fire-extinguishers</b> on all vehicles and possibly an internal fire rescue service. The majority of the fires in underground mines are fuel controlled, flashover are unlikely. A great part of the heat from the smoke is absorbed by the rock walls, the smoke is cooled, and mixes evenly over the cross section. The results showed that rescue operations in underground mines today are performed flexibly. A rescue operation demands a for example respiratory protection apparatus and personnel, and a guide is a valuable asset. Other risks during operations in underground mines are long access routes, a limited amount of air, smoke, communication, disorientation and spalling. For the simulations the heat release rates were assumed to be 1, 5, 15 and 30 MW to correspond to a heavy goods vehicle with incombustible load. The air velocity in the simulations was 2 m/s. The fires were located at three different locations in the mine. From the results it was investigated if and when the concentrations were below IDLH (Immediately Dangerous to Life or Health, 1200 ppm) and TGV (Ceiling value, 100 ppm). After the simulations it could be seen that connecting in- and out passages were of importance to dilute the smoke. At long distances from the fire the smoke can be so diluted that the CO-concentration is below TGV. To facilitate a rescue operation in an underground mine a measure could be sectioning, further a vehicle with its own respiratory protection apparatus can facilitate the rescue operation. By sectioning the mine some of the problems for the rescue personnel can be solved. A lower degree of exertion for rescue personnel, such as the method with a vehicle imply, means that breathing apparatus-teams according to AFS 2007 : 7 {{does not need to be}} used. The work method with a vehicle would also imply a more effective rescue operation. In order for mine personnel to be able to stay in the rescue chambers during the entire fire, these chambers need higher air capacity, since a fire in an HGV can last for a longer period of time.

5000|$|BMP-1P (Ob'yekt 765Sp4) - The {{first serious}} {{modernization}} of the BMP-1; {{it was developed}} {{in the middle of the}} 1970s after an analysis of BMP-1 combat use during the 1973 Yom Kippur War and during the Angolan Civil War three years later. Firepower was enhanced by adding the pintle-mounted 9P135M launcher with a semi-automatic control capable of firing SACLOS guided 9M113 [...] "Konkurs" [...] (AT-5 Spandrel) and 9M113M [...] "Konkurs-M" [...] (AT-5B Spandrel B) ATGMs which increased armor penetration and extended weapon range. Many BMP-1Ps were equipped with an improved pintle-mounted 9P135M-1 ATGM launcher, which was also capable of firing the 9M111 [...] "Fagot" [...] (AT-4 Spigot) or 9M111-2 [...] "Fagot" [...] (AT-4B Spigot B) ATGMs. The new ATGM launchers were somewhat difficult to operate since the gunner had to stand in the open hatch on top of the turret to use the weapons, exposing himself to hostile fire and in NBC conditions destroying whatever value the BMP-1P's NBC protection suite gave. The Malyutka loading hatch was usually welded shut and the mount was removed. A special NBC protection covering was placed on the inside and outside of the turret, the hull, the engine compartment upper access hatch, the commander's and driver's hatches as well as under the driver's station. A new <b>fire-extinguisher</b> system for protection against napalm was installed after an analysis of armored fighting vehicle (AFV) usage during the Vietnam War. There is an additional machine gun firing port on the left side of the hull and at the front of the turret. This increased the number of firing ports from seven to nine. For protection against air attacks, two 9M32M [...] "Strela-2M" [...] (SA-7b [...] "Grail" [...] Mod 1) or 9M313 Igla-1 (SA-16 Gimlet) missiles of corresponding performance were added instead of the previous 9M32 [...] "Strela-2", but sometimes they were replaced by an RPG-7 portable, shoulder-launched, anti-tank rocket propelled grenade launcher.

5000|$|The KING {{has been}} graciously pleased to confer the VICTORIA CROSS in {{recognition}} of most conspicuous bravery to:- 905192 Sergeant (Now Warrant Officer) Norman Cyril Jackson R.A.F.V.R., 106 Squadron.This airman was the flight engineer in a Lancaster detailed to attack Schweinfurt {{on the night of}} 26th April 1944. Bombs were dropped successfully and the aircraft was climbing out of the target area. Suddenly it was attacked by a fighter at about 20,000 feet. The captain took evading action at once, but the enemy secured many hits. A fire started near a petrol tank on the upper surface of the starboard wing, between the fuselage and the inner engine.Sergeant Jackson was thrown to the floor during the engagement. Wounds which he received from shell splinters in the right leg and shoulder were probably sustained at that time. Recovering himself, he remarked that he could deal with the fire on the wing and obtained his captain's permission to try to put out the flames.Pushing a hand <b>fire-extinguisher</b> into the top of his life-saving jacket and clipping on his parachute pack, Sergeant Jackson jettisoned the escape hatch above the pilot's head. He then started to climb out of the cockpit and back {{along the top of the}} fuselage to the starboard wing. Before he could leave the fuselage his parachute pack opened and the whole canopy and rigging lines spilled into the cockpit.Undeterred, Sergeant Jackson continued. The pilot (Tony Mifflin), bomb aimer (Maurice Toft) and navigator (Frank Higgins) gathered the parachute together and held on to the rigging lines, paying them out as the airman crawled aft. Eventually he slipped and, falling from the fuselage to the starboard wing, grasped an air intake on the leading edge of the wing. He succeeded in clinging on but lost the extinguisher, which was blown away.By this time, the fire had spread rapidly and Sergeant Jackson was involved. His face, hands and clothing were severely burnt. Unable to retain his hold he was swept through the flames and over the trailing edge of the wing, dragging his parachute behind. When last seen it was only partly inflated and was burning in a number of places.Realising that the fire could not be controlled, the captain gave the order to abandon aircraft. Four of the remaining members of the crew landed safely. The captain and rear gunner have not been accounted for.Sergeant Jackson was unable to control his descent and landed heavily. He sustained a broken ankle, his right eye was closed through burns and his hands were useless. These injuries, together with the wounds received earlier, reduced him to a pitiable state. At daybreak he crawled to the nearest village, where he was taken prisoner. He bore the intense pain and discomfort of the journey to Dulag Luft with magnificent fortitude. After ten months in hospital he made a good recovery, though his hands require further treatment and are only of limited use.This airman's attempt to extinguish the fire and save the aircraft and crew from falling into enemy hands was an act of outstanding gallantry. To venture outside, when travelling at 200 miles an hour, at a great height and in intense cold, was an almost incredible feat. Had he succeeded in subduing the flames, there was little or no prospect of his regaining the cockpit. The spilling of his parachute and the risk of grave damage to its canopy reduced his chances of survival to a minimum. By his ready willingness to face these dangers he set an example of self-sacrifice which will ever be remembered.|$|E
40|$|Introduction and {{objective}} Firefighters {{are considered a}} healthy and fit group of individuals, well-prepared for taking action in disaster situations. While working, they suffer from exposure to certain toxic agents, especially combustion products generated when a fire takes place. Among them, the most frequent and the most toxic are: carbon monoxide, hydrogen cyanide, ammonia, and those resulting from PVC combustion – hydrochloride, phosgene and chloride. Additionally, <b>fire-extinguisher</b> powder can be inhaled and lead to certain lesion in the airways. The aim of study was to ascertain the influence of toxic agents present {{at the scene of}} fire on the lung tissue of firefighters, and also to study this on an animal model. Material and Methods The study group consisted of firefighters who had a minimum of 10 years service. After completing a questionnaire, their clinical status was ascertained based on a general examination, laboratory tests and lung function tests. Results Questionnaire analysis showed a high percentage of pathological symptoms in the studied group. The incidence of the symptoms correlated with the duration of occupational exposure to toxic agents. Among other results, obstruction of flow in medium airways in about 30 % of the studied individuals represented the most important finding. Experimental tests were next performed on male Wistar rats, aged 3 months. They were insufflated with the solution of powdered <b>fire-extinguisher,</b> after which morphology specimens of lung tissue were studied. Evidence for disseminated fibrosis was obtained, which supported the previous clinical findings in the firefighters. Conclusions The above shows correlation between occupational exposure and respiratory system involvement in firefighters. This justifies covering the group of firefighters with special medical care focused on prophilaxis, early detection and therapy of pulmonary diseases...|$|E
40|$|CONTEXT: Although {{there are}} ample {{data on the}} {{respiratory}} effects of exposure to fire extinguisher gas, the potential hematologic effects have not been fully documented. We conducted this study to determine the possible etiologic agent(s) for a decrease in red blood cells among community residents in Taipei, Taiwan, after they were exposed to leakage of mixed fire extinguishants containing bromotrifluoromethane (CF 3 Br, Halon 1301), bromochlorodifluoromethane (CF 2 BrCl, Halon 1211), and dichlorodifluoromethane (CCl 2 F 2, CFC- 12). CASE PRESENTATION: We studied 117 exposed residents who came into one hospital for physical examinations. We also selected age- and sex-matched referents for comparison from residents {{who came to the}} same hospital for health examinations. Nine months after the exposure to mixed fire extinguishants, 91 of the exposed residents came back for a second physical examination. In the first examination of the exposed residents, we found a significant reduction in red blood cell count and hemoglobin and a relationship between dose and response. DISCUSSION: After excluding iron-deficiency anemia, thalassemia, and other possible agents, we suspected that the hematologic effects might have resulted from pyrolytic products of CFC- 12 and Halon 1211, which may contain phosgene, among other products. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The acute transient hematologic effects observed in the exposed residents were associated with the incident of leakage of mixed <b>fire-extinguisher</b> gases and were most likely caused by a small amount of pyrolytic products, probably phosgene. Nine months after the exposure, we found a significant improvement in the abnormalities without any specific treatment...|$|E
