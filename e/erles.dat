60|$|Mr. Ruddles said a {{great deal}} more to the same effect, and though Mr. Molescroft did not express any {{acquiescence}} in these views, neither did he dissent. The candidate said but little at this interview, but turned the matter over in his mind. A seat in Parliament would be but a barren honour, and he could not afford to offer his services for barren honour. Honest political work he was anxious to do, but for what work he did he desired to be paid. The party to which he belonged had, as he knew, endeavoured to avoid the subject of the disendowment of the Church of England. It is the necessary nature of a political party in this country to avoid, as long as it can be avoided, the consideration of any question which involves a great change. There is a consciousness on the minds of leading politicians that the pressure from behind, forcing upon them great measures, drives them almost quicker than they can go, so that it becomes a necessity with them to resist rather than to aid the pressure which will certainly be at last effective by its own strength. The best carriage horses are those which can most steadily hold back against the coach as it trundles down the hill. All this Phineas knew, and was of opinion that the Barrington <b>Erles</b> and Ratlers of his party would not thank him for ventilating a measure which, however certain might be its coming, might well be postponed for a few years. Once already in his career he had chosen to be in advance of his party, and the consequences had been disastrous to him. On that occasion his feelings had been strong in regard to the measure upon which he broke away from his party; but, when he first thought of it, he did not care much about Church disendowment.|$|E

He was called to the bar at Middle Temple in 1617. <b>Erle</b> and his brother Sir Walter <b>Erle</b> were issued shares in the Virginia Company in 1620.

6000|$|Phineas {{had many}} serious, almost solemn {{thoughts}} on his journey towards London. I am sorry I must assure my female readers {{that very few}} of them had reference to Mary Flood Jones. He had, however, very carefully packed up the tress, and could bring that out for proper acts of erotic worship at seasons in which his mind might be less engaged with affairs of state than it was at present. Would he make a failure of this great matter which he had taken in hand? He could not but tell himself that the chances were twenty to one against him. Now that he looked nearer at it all, the difficulties loomed larger than ever, and the rewards seemed to be less, more difficult of approach, and more evanescent. How many members were there who could never get a hearing! How many who only spoke to fail! How many, who spoke well, who could speak to no effect as far as their own worldly prospects were concerned! He had already known many members of Parliament to whom no outward respect or sign of honour was ever given by any one; and it seemed to him, as he thought over it, that Irish members of Parliament were generally treated with more indifference than any others. There were O'B---- and O'C---- and O'D----, for whom no one cared a straw, who could hardly get men to dine with them at the club, and yet they were genuine members of Parliament. Why should he ever be better than O'B----, or O'C----, or O'D----? And in what way should he begin to be better? He had an idea of the fashion after which it would be his duty to strive that he might excel those gentlemen. He did not give any of them credit for much earnestness in their country's behalf, and he was minded to be very earnest. He would go to his work honestly and conscientiously, determined to do his duty as best he might, let the results to himself be what they would. This was a noble resolution, and might have been pleasant to him,--had he not remembered that smile of derision which had come over his friend Erle's face when he declared his intention of doing his duty to his country as a Liberal, and not of supporting a party. O'B---- and O'C---- and O'D---- were keen enough to support their party, only they were sometimes a little astray at knowing which was their party for the nonce. He knew that Erle and such men would despise him if he did not fall into the regular groove,--and if the Barrington <b>Erles</b> despised him, what would then be left for him? ...|$|E

5000|$|Mary, Queen of Scots {{visited the}} castle and {{reportedly}} planted a {{sweet chestnut tree}} in the grounds in 1561; she's also said to have planted a yew tree at Castlecary Castle, only {{a mile or two}} away, which still grows there. The whole great hall collapsed while the queen was staying at Commernalde on 26 January 1562, and 7 or 8 men were killed. Most of the queen's party were out hunting. Mary was not hurt and visited the relatives of those who were injured or killed in the village below. Royalty often visited the town to hunt the rare Scottish ox, or white cattle, which roamed in the woods around Cumbernauld. These woods were a surviving fragment of the ancient Caledonian Forest, in which the oxen abounded at least till 1571 and probably until the building of the new house. Many of these were deliberately killed by Regent Lennox's men and a plaintiff complains: [...] "And amonges others greite enormyties perpetrated be th' <b>erles</b> men of werre they have slayne and destroyed the dere in John Fleming's forest of Cummernald and the quhit ky and bullis, to the gryt destructione of polecie and hinder of the commonweil.

5000|$|Part of the Colcombe {{estate was}} {{purchased}} by William Pole Esquire (d. 1588), who had purchased Shute House in 1560. His son Sir William Pole (1561-1635), the antiquary, purchased the remaining shares from the heirs of the Courtenays, and rebuilt the house, as he recorded after 1618 in his [...] "Collections towards a History of Devon": A goodly building was here intended by the last <b>erles</b> but altogether unfinished, and nowe the whole being reduced from all ye co-heires unto my possession, I have newe built the howse and made it the place of my residinge". Sir William resided most of his younger life at Shute, until 1618, during which time he let his son John, later the 1st Pole baronet, live in the former building at Colcombe, as {{is evidenced by the}} record of the birth of John's second son Courtenay Pole, which described his father as [...] "John Pole of Colcombe". In 1618 Sir William Pole exchanged residences with his son John, to whom he let Shute, and himself moved to Colcombe, which he then set about rebuilding and where he died in 1635. [...] During the Civil War it served in 1644 as the headquarters of Prince Maurice (d. 1652), who used it as a base for his attack on Stedcombe, then being used as a garrison for parliamentary troops by its owner Sir Walter Erle. It was almost completely destroyed, with only part of the kitchen and a large fireplace having survived. During the conflagration, many of the volumes of the manuscripts of the antiquary's great work on the history of Devon, with substantial additions made by his son the 1st baronet, were destroyed. After the Civil War part was rebuilt {{on the other side of}} a lane as a farmhouse. Colcombe appears to have passed out of the Pole family after the time of the 1st baronet, but was repurchased by Sir John de la Pole, 6th Baronet (1757-1799), the builder of New Shute House, possibly from Sir George Yonge of Colyton, from whom he had acquired several large properties in 1790. The 6th baronet seems to have decided to re-build it in the grand style of its former existence when owned by Henry Courtenay, 1st Marquess of Exeter, 2nd Earl of Devon (1498-1539). However he died before his plan could be effected and stipulated in his will that his heirs should build [...] "a good substantial dwelling-house with suitable offices and at least five acres of land in Colcombe Park where his widow should live". It is unlikely the request was ever acted upon. His widow is known to have spent her last days at Lindridge House near Plymouth tending her sick brother.|$|E

40|$|In this {{investigation}} {{a population of}} dogs at a rehoming center was monitored {{over a period of}} 2 years. Despite regular vaccination of incoming dogs against distemper, canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV- 2), and canine parainfluenza virus (CPIV), respiratory disease was endemic. Tissue samples from the respiratory tract as well as paired serum samples were collected for analysis. The development of PCR assays for the detection of CPIV, canine adenovirus types 1 and 2, and canine herpesvirus (CHV) is described. Surprisingly, canine adenovirus was not detected in samples from this population, whereas 19. 4 % of tracheal and 10. 4 % of lung samples were positive for CPIV and 12. 8 % of tracheal and 9. 6 % of lung samples were positive for CHV. As reported previously, a novel canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV) was detected in this population (K. <b>Erles,</b> C. Toomey, H. W. Brooks, and J. Brownlie, Virology 310 : 216 - 223, 2003). Infections with CRCoV occurred mostly {{during the first week of}} a dog's stay at the kennel, whereas CPIV and CHV were detected at later time points. Furthermore, the evaluation of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for detection of antibodies to CPIV and an immunofluorescence assay for detection of antibodies to CHV is described. This study shows that CPIV is present at kennels despite vaccination. In addition, other agents such as CHV and CRCoV may play a role in the pathogenesis of canine respiratory disease, whereas CAV- 2 and canine distemper virus were not present in this population, indicating that their prevalence in the United Kingdom is low due to widespread vaccination of dogs...|$|E

40|$|The canine {{respiratory}} coronavirus (CRCoV) {{is one of}} many coronaviruses circulating among {{animals and}} was discovered in the UK in 2003 by <b>Erles</b> et all 1. Like every coronavirus, CRCoV contains a single-stranded RNA molecule, a capsid and projecting spikes that give the virus its specific appearance in electron micrographs. Coronaviruses are classified into three different antigenic groups and can cause respiratory, enteric, hepatic and even neurological symptoms in humans and animals. The CRCoV belongs to group 2 a and is genetically very similar to the bovine coronavirus. Group 2 coronaviruses have an additional protein, the hemagglutin-esterase protein (HE-protein) 2, 3. CRCov itself causes no or only mild respiratory symptoms like coughing, sneezing and rhinitis, but in combination with other pathogens, severe clinical signs can be seen. It is thought that CRCoV plays a role in the canine infectious respiratory disease (CIRD). The most important pathogens causing CIRD are canine parainfluenza virus (CPIV), canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV- 2), canine influenza virus (CIV) and Bordetella bronchiseptica. These pathogens can cause (severe) clinical signs on their own, but can invade the body much more easy when the respiratory tract is made vulnerable by, for example, the CRCoV 4. In a couple of countries, the seroprevalence of infections with the CRCoV was already studied 5 - 9. The seroprevalences range from 17, 8 % in Japan to 59, 1 % in Canada. In the Netherlands there are no data on the seroprevalence and during this study this seroprevalence was determined using Virus Neutralization tests. The aim of the current study was also to develop an ELISA based on the HE protein of the Bovine coronavirus to determine if these results correlate with the results of the VN tests. Also it was tried to develop an ELISA based on the HE protein of the CRCoV itself and these results were also compared to the results of the BCoV-HE+ ELISA and the VN tests...|$|E
