25|$|Depending on geology {{and soil}} type, pump and treat {{may be a}} good method to quickly reduce high {{concentrations}} of pollutants. It is more difficult to reach sufficiently low concentrations to satisfy remediation standards, due to the equilibrium of absorption/desorption processes in the soil. However, pump and treat is typically not the best form of remediation. It is expensive to treat the groundwater, and typically is a very slow process to clean up a release with pump and treat. It is best suited to control the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>gradient</b> and keep a release from spreading further. Better options of in-situ treatment often include air sparge/soil vapor extraction (AS/SVE) or dual phase extraction/multiphase extraction(DPE/MPE). Other methods include trying to increase the dissolved oxygen content of the groundwater to support microbial degradation of the compound (especially petroleum) by direct injection of oxygen into the subsurface, or the direct injection of a slurry that slowly releases oxygen over time (typically magnesium peroxide or calium oxy-hydroxide).|$|E

For the test to be valid, and for Darcyâ€™s law to be applicable, the communicating pore space must be saturated.

We performed four whole-stream solute tracer injections under steady state flow conditions at the H. J. Andrews Experimental Forest (Oregon, United States) and collected electrical resistivity (ER) imaging to directly quantify the 2 -D spatial extent of hyporheic exchange through seasonal base flow recession. ER images provide spatially distributed information that is unavailable for stream solute transport modeling studies from monitoring wells alone. The lateral and vertical extent of the hyporheic zone was quantified using both ER images and spatial moment analysis. Results oppose the common conceptual model of hyporheic "compression'' by increased lateral <b>hydraulic</b> <b>gradients</b> toward the stream. We found that the extent of the hyporheic zone increased with decreasing vertical gradients away from the stream, in contrast to expectations from conceptual models.

While floodgate opening at Romiaka enhanced the amplitude of pre-existing tidal interaction with adjacent shallow groundwater, altered <b>hydraulic</b> <b>gradients</b> and caused some salt seepage, lateral solute movement from the drain was highly attenuated (3 Ì†c 103 Ì†em). The site with very high hydraulic conductivity soils (Shark Creek; 3 Ì†e 125 m dayâˆ’ 1) had a lower elevation and seasonally fluctuating <b>hydraulic</b> <b>gradients.</b> The introduction of a tidal pressure signal into the drain by opening the floodgate at Shark Creek caused tidal forcing of groundwater over 300 m from the drain. Floodgate opening at this site also caused changes in groundwater <b>hydraulic</b> <b>gradients,</b> leading to incursion of saline drain water into shallow groundwater over 80 m from the drain. Lateral movement of solutes was relatively rapid, due to macropore flow in oxidised acid sulfate soil horizons, and caused substantial changes to shallow groundwater chemical composition. Conversely, when groundwater <b>hydraulic</b> <b>gradients</b> were towards the drain at this site there was substantial lateral outflow of acid groundwater into drains.

Two different sediments were used (d(50) = 1. 5 and 8. 5 mm) resulting in different beach permeability and surface roughness. The experiments yielded detailed measurements of swash depth and velocities, wetting front, pressure, and groundwater levels across the swash zone. This paper is focused on the processes occurring within the beach. The measurements provide the shape of the wetting front and the groundwater table and reveal the behavior of air in the unsaturated region of the beach. Air is initially at atmospheric pressure, but the pressure builds up when air becomes encapsulated between the saturated region formed below the swash and the groundwater table. For the 1. 5 mm beach, entrapped air significantly affected the water exchange between the swash and the subsurface. The considerable buildup of interstitial air pressure reduced vertical <b>hydraulic</b> <b>gradients</b> and thus infiltration rates.
