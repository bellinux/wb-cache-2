5000|$|Invented in 1984, {{a rather}} {{different}} method called radiosity was faithful to both principles. However, radiosity relates the total illuminance falling on a {{surface with a}} uniform luminance that leaves the surface. This forced all surfaces to be Lambertian, or [...] "perfectly diffuse". While radiosity {{received a lot of}} attention at its invocation, perfectly diffuse surfaces do not exist in the real world. The realization that scattering from a surface depends on both incoming and outgoing directions is the key principle behind the Bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF). This direction dependence was a focus of research resulting in the publication of important ideas throughout the 1990s, since accounting for direction always exacted a price of steep increases in calculation times on desktop computers. <b>Principle</b> <b>III</b> follows.|$|R

Domain models, meta models, and software design documentation provide additional artifacts such as roles, associations, use cases, and paragraphs of text.

The tool consists of a knowledge base containing software artifacts, relationships between artifacts, and rules for generating new relationships. The knowledge base is then explored using formal concept analysis (FCA). Exploration of the software structure via FCA is useful in: (i) understanding the software structure, (ii) the recognition of parts of the software structure violating design <b>principles,</b> (<b>iii)</b> the reorganisation of type and package hierarchies, and (iv) retrieving artifacts of the software development process...|$|R

Further, drawing on the results in Part 1 and Part 2, I will argue for the need of a unified interpretation of Leibniz’s metaphysics and dynamics. My three conjectures as regards Leibniz’s possible treatment of inertia and gravity are proposed along a unified interpretation, in terms of my informational reconstruction of Leibniz’s philosophy.

40|$|In the UK, water {{companies}} {{renew their}} aging water network using novel techniques and robust materials. The {{most common type}} of material used for network rehabilitation is Polyethylene (PE) pipe. A common method of jointing PE pipe is electrofusion welding. Here, electricity is used to heat a coil that melts the fitting and the host pipe of the same material. When the joint cools it forms a bond. However, premature failure of these can occur if best practice <b>installation</b> <b>principles</b> are not followed on site. A novel experimental rig, designed to be retrofitted to an existing servo-hydraulic fatigue testing machine, has been used to cyclically pressurise PE fittings that have been created with a controlled element of 'poor workmanship'. Extensive fatigue tests have shown the relationship between joint failure and the dynamic pressures experienced in water distribution systems. Furthermore, the effects of poor workmanship have shown to have a detrimental effect on asset integrity. A post-failure analysis of the fittings using non-destructive ultra-sonic methods has shown the failure paths of the fittings. Additionally, a bespoke ultra-sonic rig was designed and built to monitor the crack propagation of the fittings during live dynamic tests to confirm the mode of failure. © The Society for Experimental Mechanics, Inc. 2015...|$|R

According to this purpose, ‘Problem Posing Form about Ratio and Proportion Subject’ including questions for determining the tasks of free problem posing, semi-structured problem posing, structured problem posing and for determining which one is the most challenging problem posing task, was developed by the researchers.

40|$|In {{this article}} the {{relationship}} between legal philosophy and legal science is {{compared with that of}} a partnership which implies that the partners have distinct reciprocal duties. In such a partnership a reformational approach in legal philosophy has the task of convincing other legal scientists that the former can make a meaningful contribution towards raising the level of legal research and education. This does not mean that legal scientists have to become legal philosophers; they do however, have the responsibility to take cognisance of important basic theoretical insights developed by a reformational legal philosophy. Such an approach could preclude them from attempts to reinvent the legal philosophical wheel, especially if they are prepared to stand on the shoulders of a long array of legal philosophical giants. The application of basic concepts of a reformational legal philosophy should, however, be done in a creative way in order to prevent them from becoming epigones. The danger of legal philosophical systematics becoming an intellectual straitjacket could only be avoided if it remains open (i) towards its own presuppositions, (ii) towards legal reality encompassing positive law and legal <b>principles,</b> (<b>iii)</b> towards other legal theories and (iv) towards other relevant disciplines. Furthermore, the possibility of a secularization of the contributions of a reformational legal philosophy is discussed. In conclusion the need for the acceptance of dynamic supra-arbitrary legal principles and possible contributions of a reformational legal philosophy accepting them, is underlined...|$|R

40|$|In {{this review}} the debated rapport between {{thermodynamics}} and {{quantum mechanics is}} addressed {{in the framework of}} the theory of periodically-driven/controlled quantum-thermodynamic machines. The basic model studied here is that of a two-level system (TLS), whose energy is periodically modulated while the system is coupled to thermal baths. When the modulation interval is short compared to the bath memory time, the system-bath correlations are affected, thereby causing cooling or heating of the TLS, depending on the interval. In steady state, a periodically-modulated TLS coupled to two distinct baths constitutes the simplest quantum heat machine (QHM) that may operate as either an engine or a refrigerator, depending on the modulation rate. We find their efficiency and power-output bounds and the conditions for attaining these bounds. An extension of this model to multilevel systems shows that the QHM power output can be boosted by the multilevel degeneracy. These results are used to scrutinize basic thermodynamic principles: (i) Externally-driven/modulated QHMs may attain the Carnot efficiency bound, but when the driving is done by a quantum device ("piston"), the efficiency strongly depends on its initial quantum state. Such dependence has been unknown thus far. (ii) The refrigeration rate effected by QHMs does not vanish as the temperature approaches absolute zero for certain quantized baths, e. g., magnons, thous challenging Nernst's unattainability <b>principle.</b> (<b>iii)</b> System-bath correlations allow more work extraction under periodic control than that expected from the Szilard-Landauer principle, provided the period is in the non-Markovian domain. Thus, dynamically-controlled QHMs may benefit from hitherto unexploited thermodynamic resources...|$|R
