5|$|RNA {{thermometers}} {{sensitive to}} temperatures of 37°C {{can be used}} by pathogens to activate infection-specific genes. For example, the upregulation of prfA, encoding a key transcriptional regulator of virulence genes in Listeria monocytogenes, was demonstrated by fusing the 5' DNA of prfA to the green fluorescent protein gene; the <b>gene</b> <b>fusion</b> was then transcribed from the T7 promoter in E. coli, and fluorescence was observed at 37°C but not at 30°C.|$|E
25|$|Translocation {{results in}} an oncogenic BCR-ABL <b>gene</b> <b>fusion</b> {{that can be found}} on the shorter {{derivative}} 22 chromosome. This gene encodes for a Bcr-abl fusion protein. Depending on the precise location of fusion, the molecular weight of this protein can range from 185 to 210 kDa. Consequently, bcr-abl is referred to as p210 or p185.|$|E
25|$|Highly {{efficient}} fluorescent proteins such as {{the green}} fluorescent protein (GFP) have been developed using the molecular biology technique of <b>gene</b> <b>fusion,</b> a process that links {{the expression of the}} fluorescent compound to that of the target protein. This combined fluorescent protein is, in general, non-toxic to the organism and rarely interferes with the function of the protein under study. Genetically modified cells or organisms directly express the fluorescently tagged proteins, which enables the study of the function of the original protein in vivo.|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 08 <b>Gene</b> <b>fusions</b> {{have long}} been known to drive cancer. Initial {{discovery}} of <b>gene</b> <b>fusions</b> was opportunistic, and functional assessment was done individually and experimentally. There is no comprehensive systems biology approach to understanding the impact of <b>gene</b> <b>fusions</b> on the signaling networks within tumor cells. An integrative computational approach was taken to achieve {{a better understanding of}} <b>gene</b> <b>fusions</b> and their complex influence on pathways and interaction networks in the context of lung cancer. Using well-studied fusions and publicly available gene expression data, the effect of fusion events on the expression pattern of gene networks revealed unique differences in tumors with <b>gene</b> <b>fusions,</b> tumors without <b>gene</b> <b>fusions,</b> and normal samples. This approach identifies gene expression signatures associated with specific fusions, and provides a model for integrating experimental and pathway data to better understand the biology of a <b>fusion</b> <b>genes</b> and their roles in oncogenesis...|$|R
40|$|Producing <b>gene</b> <b>fusions</b> through genomic {{structural}} rearrangements {{is a major}} {{mechanism for}} tumor evolution. Therefore, accurately detecting <b>gene</b> <b>fusions</b> and the originating rearrangements is of great importance for personalized cancer diagnosis and targeted therapy. We present a tool, BreakTrans, that systematically maps predicted <b>gene</b> <b>fusions</b> to structural rearrangements. Thus, BreakTrans not only validates both types of predictions, but also provides mechanistic interpretations. BreakTrans effectively validates known fusions and discovers novel events in a breast cancer cell line.

50|$|Many whole <b>gene</b> <b>fusions</b> {{are fully}} {{functional}} and can still act {{to replace the}} original peptides. Some, however, experience interactions between the two proteins that can modify their functions. Beyond these effects, some <b>gene</b> <b>fusions</b> may cause regulatory changes that alter when and where these genes act. For partial <b>gene</b> <b>fusions,</b> the shuffling of different active sites and binding domains have potential to result in new proteins with novel functions.|$|R
2500|$|Many {{knock-outs}} {{have been}} made in the apoptosis pathways to test the function of each of the proteins. [...] Several caspases, in addition to APAF-1 and FADD, have been mutated to determine the new phenotype. [...] In order to create a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) knockout, an exon containing the nucleotides 3704–5364 was removed from the gene. [...] This exon encodes a portion of the mature TNF domain, as well as the leader sequence, which is a highly conserved region necessary for proper intracellular processing. [...] TNF-/- mice develop normally and have no gross structural or morphological abnormalities. [...] However, upon immunization with SRBC (sheep red blood cells), these mice demonstrated a deficiency in the maturation of an antibody response; they were able to generate normal levels of IgM, but could not develop specific IgG levels. [...] Apaf-1 is the protein that turns on caspase 9 by cleavage to begin the caspase cascade that leads to apoptosis. [...] Since a -/- mutation in the APAF-1 gene is embryonic lethal, a gene trap strategy was used in order to generate an APAF-1 -/- mouse. [...] This assay is used to disrupt gene function by creating an intragenic <b>gene</b> <b>fusion.</b> [...] When an APAF-1 gene trap is introduced into cells, many morphological changes occur, such as spina bifida, the persistence of interdigital webs, and open brain. [...] In addition, after embryonic day 12.5, the brain of the embryos showed several structural changes. [...] APAF-1 cells are protected from apoptosis stimuli such as irradiation. [...] A BAX-1 knock-out mouse exhibits normal forebrain formation and a decreased programmed cell death in some neuronal populations and in the spinal cord, leading to an increase in motor neurons.|$|E

50|$|<b>Gene</b> <b>fusion</b> plays a {{key role}} in the {{evolution}} of gene architecture. We can observe its effect if <b>gene</b> <b>fusion</b> occurs in coding sequences. Duplication, sequence divergence, and recombination are the major contributors at work in gene evolution. These events can probably produce new genes from already existing parts. When <b>gene</b> <b>fusion</b> happens in non-coding sequence region, it can lead to the misregulation of the expression of a gene now under the control of the cis-regulatory sequence of another gene. If it happens in coding sequences, <b>gene</b> <b>fusion</b> cause the assembly of a new gene, then it allows the appearance of new functions by adding peptide modules into multi domain protein. The detecting methods to inventory <b>gene</b> <b>fusion</b> events on a large biological scale can provide insights about the multi modular architecture of proteins.|$|E

Therefore, we aim to establish a sensitive, high-throughput methodology to comprehensively catalog functional <b>gene</b> <b>fusions</b> in cancer by evaluating a paired-end transcriptome sequencing strategy. Not only did a paired-end approach provide a greater dynamic range in comparison with single read based approaches, but it clearly distinguished the high-level “driving” <b>gene</b> <b>fusions,</b> such as BCR-ABL 1 and TMPRSS 2 -ERG, from potential lower level “passenger” <b>gene</b> <b>fusions.</b> Also, the comprehensiveness of a paired-end approach enabled the discovery of 12 previously undescribed <b>gene</b> <b>fusions</b> in 4 commonly used cell lines that eluded previous approaches. Using the paired-end transcriptome sequencing approach, we observed read-through mRNA chimeras, tissue-type restricted chimeras, converging transcripts, diverging transcripts, and overlapping mRNA transcripts.

40|$|<b>Gene</b> <b>fusions</b> {{have been}} {{described}} in approximately one-third of soft tissue tumors (STT); of the 142 different fusions that have been reported, more than half are recurrent in the same histologic subtype. These <b>gene</b> <b>fusions</b> constitute pivotal driver mutations, and detailed studies of their cellular effects have provided important knowledge about pathogenetic mechanisms in STT. Furthermore, most fusions are strongly associated with a particular histotype, serving as ideal molecular diagnostic markers. In recent years, it has also become apparent that some chimeric proteins, directly or indirectly, constitute excellent treatment targets, making the detection of <b>gene</b> <b>fusions</b> in STT ever more important. Indeed, pharmacological treatment of STT displaying fusions that activate protein kinases, such as ALK and ROS 1, or growth factors, such as PDGFB, is already in clinical use. However, the vast majority (52 / 78) of recurrent <b>gene</b> <b>fusions</b> create structurally altered and/or deregulated transcription factors, and {{a small but growing}} subset develops through rearranged chromatin regulators.

40|$|<b>Gene</b> <b>fusions</b> {{created by}} somatic genomic rearrangements {{are known to}} play an {{important}} role in the onset and development of some cancers, such as lymphomas and sarcomas. RNA-Seq (whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing) is proving to be a useful tool for the discovery of novel <b>gene</b> <b>fusions</b> in cancer transcriptomes. However, algorithmic methods for the discovery of <b>gene</b> <b>fusions</b> using RNA-Seq data remain underdeveloped. We have developed deFuse, a novel computational method for fusion discovery in tumor RNA-Seq data. Unlike existing methods that use only unique best-hit alignments and consider only fusion boundaries at the ends of known exons, deFuse considers all alignments and all possible locations for fusion boundaries. As a result, deFuse is able to identify fusion sequences with demonstrably better sensitivity than previous approaches. To increase the specificity of our approach, we curated a list of 60 true positive and 61 true negative fusion sequences (as confirmed by RT-PCR), and have trained an adaboost classifier on 11 novel features of the sequence data. The resulting classifier has an estimated value of 0. 91 for the area under the ROC curve. We have used deFuse to discover <b>gene</b> <b>fusions</b> in 40 ovarian tumor samples, one ovarian cancer cell line, and three sarcoma samples.
