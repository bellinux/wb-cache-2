However the variability of bast fiber yield and quality represents an important barrier to further exploitation.

Both growing conditions and <b>hemp</b> <b>varieties</b> impact stem tissue architecture with a large effect on the proportion of secondary fibers but not primary fibers. Attenuated total reflectance infrared spectroscopy allowed the discrimination of manually-isolated native primary fibers and secondary fibers but did not reveal any clustering according to growing conditions and variety.

Infrared spectroscopy of technical fibers obtained after mechanical defibering revealed differences with native primary, but not secondary fibers and also discriminated samples obtained from plants grown under different conditions. Altogether the results suggested that the observed variability of hemp technical fibers could be partially explained by i) differences in secondary fiber production and ii) differential behavior during mechanical defibering resulting in unequal separation of primary and secondary fibers...|$|E

The <b>hemp</b> <b>variety</b> was Futura 75, cultivated in Castelvolturno (CE), Southern Italy. Harvest has been carried out in September 2016 with a mechanical harvester. The test has been carried out using a mechanical screw press, powered by 2. 2 kW electric motor, using an 8 mm nozzle. The variable parameters were: temperature of extraction (50 °C and 70 °C), measured with a temperature sensor placed on press head; two rotational screw speeds (22 rpm and 32 rpm) and seeds pre-treatment (heated at 50 °C for 1 h in a laboratory oven and not heated). The processed samples weighted 1000 g each. After the extraction, oil was centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 20 minutes with an laboratory centrifuge to determine the yield of pure oil as percentage of extracted oil (g) on the total oil extractable basis. During the tests, the performances of the press has been monitored: initial and final extraction temperatures have been recorded with a RTD (Pt 100) temperature sensor; extraction time has been recorded with a laboratory stopwatch.
