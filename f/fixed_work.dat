5|$|DST has mixed {{effects on}} health. In {{societies}} with <b>fixed</b> <b>work</b> schedules it provides more afternoon sunlight for outdoor exercise. It alters sunlight exposure; {{whether this is}} beneficial depends on one's location and daily schedule, as sunlight triggers vitamin D synthesis in the skin, but overexposure can lead to skin cancer. DST may help in depression by causing individuals to rise earlier, but some argue the reverse. The Retinitis Pigmentosa Foundation Fighting Blindness, chaired by blind sports magnate Gordon Gund, successfully lobbied in 1985 and 2005 for U.S. DST extensions. DST shifts are associated with higher rates of ischemic stroke {{in the first two}} days after the shift, though not in the week thereafter.|$|E

Henry Ford states in his autobiography My Life and Work that it was a visit to a Chicago slaughterhouse which opened his eyes to the virtues of employing a moving conveyor system and <b>fixed</b> <b>work</b> stations in industrial applications. These practices symbolize the concept of [...] "rationalized organization of work" [...] to this day.|$|E
2500|$|A {{second strike}} began on Friday, October 18, 2013, over {{unresolved}} compensation and work rule issues. [...] Management offered a 12% wage increase over 4 years, of which 4% {{would be taken}} back as {{an increase in the}} required pension contribution; 9.5% increase in healthcare premiums, and changes to work rules including fewer <b>fixed</b> <b>work</b> schedules. [...] Unions were willing to accept the financial terms but requested binding arbitration for the work rules. [...] Management refused the arbitration offer.|$|E

50|$|Second fix {{comprises}} all {{the work}} after the plastering of a finished house. Electrical fixtures {{are connected to the}} cables, sinks and baths connected to the pipes, and doors fitted into doorframes. Second <b>fix</b> <b>work</b> requires a neater finish than first fix.|$|R
2500|$|By {{contrast}} Figures—Doubles—Prismes (1957–68) is a <b>fixed</b> <b>work</b> with {{no chance}} element. Robert Piencikowski {{describes it as}} [...] "a great cycle of variations whose components interpenetrate each other instead of remaining isolated in the traditional manner." [...] It is notable for the unusual layout of the orchestra, in which the various families of instruments (woodwind, brass etc.) are scattered across the stage rather than being grouped together. Boulez later acknowledged that [...] "this arrangement is {{bound up with the}} idea of stereophony, which was new at the time: the sound is distributed on the platform in a way which is potentially mobile." ...|$|E
50|$|In 1733, Christian VI {{introduced}} a law compelling peasants {{to remain on}} the estate where they were born until the age of 36. This was to provide a <b>fixed</b> <b>work</b> force, but also aid military conscription. The law was abolished in 1788 by the then regent, later to become Frederick VI.|$|E
50|$|Like the rolltop desk, {{which was}} invented much later, the {{cylinder}} desk usually has a <b>fixed</b> <b>work</b> surface: the paperwork {{does not have}} to be stored before the desk is shut. Some designs, however, have the capacity to slide the desk surface out a few inches to expand the available work area.|$|E
50|$|The bubble-up {{strategy}} simply records {{pairs of}} symptoms and fixes. The most frequent set of pairs is then {{presented as a}} tentative solution, which is then attempted. If the <b>fix</b> <b>works,</b> that fact is further recorded, along with {{the configuration of the}} presenting system, into a solutions database.|$|R
50|$|In the UK, {{carpentry}} is more correctly used {{to describe}} the skill involved in first fixing of timber items, such as construction of roofs, floors and timber framed buildings, i.e., those areas of construction that are normally hidden in a finished building. An easy way to envisage this is that first <b>fix</b> <b>work</b> is all that is done before plastering takes place. Second fix is done after plastering takes place. Second <b>fix</b> <b>work,</b> the construction of items such as skirting boards, architraves, and doors also comes under carpentry. Carpentry is also used to construct the formwork into which concrete is poured during the building of structures such as roads and highway overpasses. In the UK, the skill of making timber formwork for poured, or in situ, concrete, is referred to as shuttering.|$|R
50|$|A {{special screw}} for <b>fixing</b> <b>work</b> to the workbench, and a mallet, {{complete}} the carvers kit, though other tools, both specialized and adapted, are often used, {{such as a}} router for bringing grounds to a uniform level, bent gouges and bent chisels for cutting hollows too deep for the ordinary tool.|$|R
50|$|In the {{follow-up}} {{phase of a}} Fagan Inspection, defects fixed in the rework phase should be verified. The moderator is usually responsible for verifying rework. Sometimes <b>fixed</b> <b>work</b> can be accepted without being verified, such as when the defect was trivial. In non-trivial cases, a full re-inspection is performed by the inspection team (not only the moderator).|$|E

30|$|Many {{immigrants}} enter Canada on <b>fixed</b> length <b>work</b> permits {{prior to}} becoming permanent residents.

50|$|Some armoire desks have a <b>fixed</b> <b>work</b> surface, which {{stays in}} place {{when the doors}} are closed, and moves only for {{ergonomic}} adjustments. This kind of armoire desk is a direct descendant of the antique rolltop desk which was common in corporate or government offices three or four generations ago, since it provides a fast and efficient way to store or hide current work.|$|E

50|$|By {{monitoring}} the pre-match betting markets {{it is possible}} to detect planned match fixing. It is also possible to detect on-going match manipulation by looking at the in-game betting markets.

50|$|The {{combination}} of routes of an inter-city nature in Sweden with commuter-like routes in Denmark {{is often a}} source of trouble. The long-distance trains from Sweden often accumulate delays during the long journey. But delays cause trouble to commuter passengers having <b>fixed</b> <b>work</b> hours and not wishing to add long margins, since they travel every day. Therefore, DSBFirst nowadays have stand-by trains ready at Kastrup that run to Helsingør if the train from Sweden is delayed. In these circumstances the train from Sweden is terminated early and does not continue to Helsingør.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} example {{is that of}} having a <b>fixed</b> <b>work</b> start time: if someone starts work at 0900 but {{actually}} arrives at 0850, they are incurring a schedule delay of 10 minutes. Alternative examples might include public transport - if a bus is scheduled to depart from a stop at 20-minute intervals (e.g. 0800, 0820, 0840) and a person wishes to begin their journey between those intervals (e.g. at 0815), they incur a schedule delay through having to retime their departure from the desired 0815 point to the bus departure time of 0820.|$|E

40|$|A {{dynamic model}} is {{formulated}} for determining optimum operating policies in a variable channel queuing situation. Such policies are required when workers must be allocated {{to one of}} several jobs which have associated with them different waiting costs. In this model, two such jobs are considered: (a) a "queue job" i. e., serving customers in a queue, and (b) performing another task which does not involve waiting customers (called "fixed work"). The criterion of the model is a minimization of the sum of these costs: the cost of customer waiting, the cost of <b>fixed</b> <b>work,</b> {{and the cost of}} changing tasks. Decision rules involving the assignment of workers depended upon the number of waiting customers, the anticipated arrival pattern, and the amount of uncompleted <b>fixed</b> <b>work</b> remaining. The model was run using arrival and service data obtained from a medium sized suburban bank together with implicitly derived cost data. ...|$|E

50|$|Although {{the exact}} origins of {{polyphony}} in the Western church traditions are unknown, the treatises Musica enchiriadis and Scolica enchiriadis, both dating from c. 900, are usually considered the oldest extant written examples of polyphony. These treatises provided examples of two-voice note-against-note embellishments of chants using parallel octaves, fifths, and fourths. Rather than being <b>fixed</b> <b>works,</b> they indicated ways of improvising polyphony during performance.
