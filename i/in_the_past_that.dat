50|$|Backtesting {{is using}} past data {{to test a}} trading system. It's useful because, if a system was not {{profitable}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> <b>that's</b> a strong sign it won't be profitable <b>in</b> <b>the</b> future. It refers to applying a trading system to historical data to verify how a system would have performed during the specified time period.|$|R
5000|$|Fury {{was placed}} fourth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> BBC SPOTY {{competition}} and apologised {{at the ceremony}} for his comments, saying: [...] "I've {{said a lot of}} stuff <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> and none of it is with intentions to hurt anybody.

5|$|Vedar use the Sri Lankan Tamil dialect {{peculiar}} to the region, known as Batticaloa Tamil dialect, in their {{day to day}} conversations. Vedar children also study in that language in schools. During Sadangu ceremonies, those who are possessed by spirits speak in a mixed language that they call Vedar Sinkalam(Vedar Sinhala") or Vedar Bhasai which is the Vedda language of the interior Vedas. This Vedar Sinkalam is mixed with many Tamil words, as people no longer know the language. There is evidence at some point <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>that</b> the people were bilingual in Vedda language and Tamil, but {{that is no longer}} the case.|$|E

25|$|Conditional perfect is {{actively}} used in modern Lithuanian.

25|$|Within Georgia, one of {{the most}} popularized styles of wrestling is the Kakhetian style.

Other popular sports in 19th century Georgia were polo, and Lelo, a traditional Georgian game later replaced by rugby union.|$|E
25|$|However, {{for some}} purposes, such as {{pensions}} calculations, it is usual {{to adjust the}} life table used by assuming that age-specific death rates will continue to decrease over the years, as they have usually done <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> <b>That</b> is often done by simply extrapolating past trends; but some models exist {{to account for the}} evolution of mortality like the Lee–Carter model.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{considered}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>that</b> these tails are primarily for deception {{as in the case}} of the Polyommatinae where the thread-like tails resemble antennae and confuse the attacker as to the location of the head. On occasions, roses have been observed with damaged tails and it is possible that the presence of swallowtails occasionally does favour the butterfly in confusing attackers.|$|E

25|$|Later in Middle Dutch, the {{distinction}} between short and long consonants started to disappear. That {{made it possible for}} short vowels to appear in open syllables once again. Because there was no longer a phonetic distinction between single and double consonants (they were both pronounced short now), Dutch writers started to use double consonants to indicate that the preceding vowel was short even when the consonant had not been long <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> <b>That</b> eventually led to the modern Dutch spelling system.|$|E

25|$|After David Cameron {{announced}} {{his intention to}} resign as Prime Minister, with his successor now {{likely to be in}} office by September 2016, Gove was not a candidate, having said <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>that</b> he had no interest in becoming Prime Minister. Instead, he was seen as a strong, highly influential supporter of Boris Johnson for that role. In a move that surprised most political analysts, Gove withdrew his support for Johnson on 30 June 2016, hours before the deadline, without any previous notice to Johnson and {{announced his}} own candidacy in the Conservative Party (UK) leadership election, 2016. Subsequently, Johnson declined to run.|$|E

25|$|Third culture {{individuals}} {{can also be}} referred to as cultural hybrids, cultural chameleons, and global nomads. TCKs are particularly adept at building relationships with other cultures while not possessing a cultural identity of their own. It has been discussed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>that</b> the characteristics that have been put forth by prominent researchers in the TCK field have only been discussed when referring to American children who have lived abroad. However, there has been further research done on TCKs that shows that the same characteristics described by Pollock and Useem in the most prominent TCK literature also apply to individuals from other nations who have also lived abroad for extended periods of time during their developmental years.|$|E
25|$|The {{novel was}} {{received}} well by young Austrians in the 1980s. To them, the book represented {{a story of}} truth that was long hidden. At a time when Austria was starting to take on responsibility for its nonaction during World War II, February Shadows threw light on problems of the past. Reichart displayed to her own nation that ignoring and forgetting {{events such as the}} Mühlviertler Hasenjagd was unacceptable and not to be tolerated. Some older Austrians, who had lived through the war, considered February Shadows controversial and inappropriate. Much like the character Hilde, they felt the past should stay <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> <b>that</b> there was a reason for Austrian silence about the events of World War II: to protect lives.|$|E
25|$|Tel {{river is}} a major {{tributary}} of Mahanadi rising {{in the north of}} Umarkote Tahsil in Nabarangpur district, it passes through few km in Chhattisgarh and then enters into Kalahandi, Balangir district and finally meets Mahanadi in Sonepur district near Manamunda. The important feeders of 150 miles Tel river on its right bank are Moter, Hati, Sagada, Bulat, Ret, Utei and Rahul whereas on its left bank tributaries are Suktel, Lanth, Under, Sungad, Udanti etc. Tel river civilization put light towards a great civilization existing in Kalahandi <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>that</b> is recently getting explored. The discovered archaeological wealth of Tel Valley suggest a well civilized, urbanized, cultured people inhabited on this land mass around 2000 years ago and Asurgarh was its capital.|$|E

25|$|Improved {{literacy}} bolsters {{both the}} informal and formal economies in Veracruz indicating policies designed to further literacy are vital for growing the regional economy. While indigenous people are relatively poor, little evidence {{was found that}} the informal economy is a higher percentage of total economic activity in a municipio with a high share of indigenous people. While the formal economy might have been expanding relative to the informal economy in 2000, by 2006 this process had been reversed with growing informality. While rural municipios have smaller economies, they are not different than urban municipios in the share of the economy that is informal. Programs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>that</b> might move economic activity from the informal to the formal sector have not succeeded, suggesting public finance issues such as tax evasion will continue to plague the state with low government revenues.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{one answer}} from modern science to give. What the {{original}} question now means indeed depends on choosing genus or species in the required answer. It is thought that the genus of man {{has been around for}} ten times as long as our species. Currently, fresh examples of (extinct) species of the genus Homo are still being discovered, so that definitive answers are not available. The consensus view is that human beings are one species, the only existing species of the genus. With the rejection of polygenism for human origins, it is asserted that this species had a definite and single origin <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> (<b>That</b> assertion leaves aside the point whether the origin meant is of the current species, however. The multiregional hypothesis allows the origin to be otherwise.) The hypothesis of recent African origin of modern humans is now widely accepted, and states that anatomically modern humans had a single origin, in Africa.|$|E

Like Planer, Inglis recognises a third possible target of Harrison's scorn – former bandmates John Lennon and Paul McCartney.
