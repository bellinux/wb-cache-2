40|$|Prostaglandins {{produced}} by the intrauterine tissues of both mother and fetus (myometrium, decidua, placenta, chorion, and amnion) are involved {{with all of the}} physiologies of parturition (membrane rupture, cervical dilatation, myometrial contractility, placental separation, and uterine involution). For parturition to occur, however, the intrauterine tissues need to first be activated to prepare for the work of labor, then stimulated to initiate labor. Prostaglandins normally are considered to be stimulators of the physiologies of labor. This review presents evidence that one prostaglandin, PGF 2 alpha, and its receptor, FP, are also activators, especially of the decidua. Stimulated by cytokines, the decidual synthesis of PGF 2 alpha and the expression of <b>FP</b> <b>lead</b> to increased matrix metalloproteinase activity, further enhancement of cytokine activity, increased decidual oxytocin and oxytocin receptor expression, decreased progesterone responsiveness, and possibly, enhanced expression of vascular endothelial growth factor. These collective actions prepare the decidua for its role in parturition. Shintaro Makino, Dean B. Zaragoza, Bryan F. Mitchell, Sarah Robertson, David M. Olso...|$|R

40|$|This work {{investigates the}} {{interaction}} of N-terminal gp 41 fusion peptide (FP) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) with model membranes in order to elucidate how <b>FP</b> <b>leads</b> to fusion of HIV and T-cell membranes. FP constructs were (i) wild-type FP 23 (23 N-terminal amino acids of gp 41), (ii) water-soluble monomeric FP that adds six lysines on the C-terminus of FP 23 (FPwsm), and (iii) the C-terminus covalently linked trimeric version (FPtri) of FPwsm. Model membranes were (i) LM 3 (a T-cell mimic), (ii) 1, 2 -dioleoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine, (iii) 1, 2 -dioleoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine/ 30 mol% cholesterol, (iv) 1, 2 -dierucoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine, and (v) 1, 2 -dierucoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine/ 30 mol% cholesterol. Diffuse synchrotron low-angle x-ray scattering from fully hydrated samples, supplemented by volumetric data, showed that FP 23 and FPtri penetrate into the hydrocarbon region and cause membranes to thin. Depth of penetration appears to depend upon a complex combination of factors including bilayer thickness, presence of cholesterol, and electrostatics. X-ray data showed an increase in curvature in hexagonal phase 1, 2 -dioleoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphoethanolamine, which further indicates that FP 23 penetrates into the hydrocarbon region rather than residing in the interfacial headgroup region. Low-angle x-ray scattering data also yielded the bending modulus K(C), a measure of membrane stiffness, and wide-angle x-ray scattering yielded the S(xray) orientational order parameter. Both FP 23 and FPtri decreased K(C) and S(xray) considerably, while the weak effect of FPwsm suggests {{that it did not}} partition strongly into LM 3 model membranes. Our results are consistent with the HIV FP disordering and softening the T-cell membrane, thereby lowering the activation energy for viral membrane fusion...|$|R

40|$|Electrical {{interactions}} between the F 2 region ionospheric plasma and the 160 V photovoltaic (PV) electrical power system on the International Space Station (ISS) can produce floating potentials (FP) on the ISS conducting structure of greater magnitude than are usually observed on spacecraft in low-Earth orbit. Flight through the geomagnetic field also causes magnetic induction charging of ISS conducting structure. Charging processes resulting from interaction of ISS with auroral electrons may also contribute to charging albeit rarely. The magnitude and frequency of occurrence of possibly hazardous charging events depends on the ISS assembly stage (six more 160 V PV arrays {{will be added to}} ISS), ISS flight configuration, ISS position (latitude and longitude), and the natural variability in the ionospheric flight environment. At present, ISS is equipped with two plasma contactors designed to control ISS FP to within 40 volts of the ambient F 2 plasma. The negative-polarity grounding scheme utilized in the ISS 160 V power system leads, naturally, to negative values of ISS FP. A negative ISS structural <b>FP</b> <b>leads</b> to application of electrostatic fields across the dielectrics that separate conducting structure from the ambient F 2 plasma, thereby enabling dielectric breakdown and arcing. Degradation of some thermal control coatings and noise in electrical systems can result. Continued review and evaluation of the putative charging hazards, as required by the ISS Program Office, revealed that ISS charging could produce a risk of electric shock to the ISS crew during extra vehicular activity. ISS charging risks are being evaluated in ongoing ISS charging measurements and analysis campaigns. The results of ISS charging measurements are combined with a recently developed detailed model of the ISS charging process and an extensive analysis of historical ionospheric variability data, to assess ISS charging risks using Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) methods. The PRA analysis (estimated frequency of occurrence and severity of the charging hazards) are then used to select the hazard control strategy that provides the best overall safety and mission success environment for ISS and the ISS crew.

40|$|Rationale: Attentional deficits {{have been}} implicated in the {{pathophysiology}} of auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia. Since the latency of the P 300 component of event-related potentials (ERPs) {{is considered to be}} a sensitive measure of stimulus classification speed, while its amplitude - a measure of attentional resource allocation when memory updating is engaged, the present study focuses on the comparison of P 300 between healthy subjects and schizophrenic patients experiencing auditory hallucinations and treated with clozapine and olanzapine. Methods: The auditory P 300 was assessed during the anticipatory period of a short memory test, in 16 male hallucinated schizophrenic patients and 13 male normal subjects matched for age and educational level. The patients were reexamined under identical conditions when their hallucinations had resolved following treatment with clozapine (8 patients) and olanzapine (8 patients). Results: The patients with hallucinations exhibited significantly reduced P 300 amplitude at <b>leads</b> <b>Fp</b> 1, F 3, (C 3 -T 5) / 2, F 4, Cz and Fz, when compared to the normal controls and at <b>leads</b> <b>Fp</b> 1, F 3, F 4, (C 4 -T 6) / 2, C 4, P 4, Cz and Fz when compared to themselves during the remission phase. However logistic regression models revealed that the most important leads, differentiating the patient group before treatment either with the healthy controls, or with itself after treatment, were that at the left temporoparietal and at the left prefrontal area. Memory performance of the patient group, even after treatment and in spite of its significant improvement, remained significantly less than that of healthy controls. Both antipsychotic agents had similar effects on the P 300 amplitude and memory performance. Conclusions: These findings indicate that auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia manifest abnormal aspects of attention, mediated by a distributed network involving or affecting the left temporoparietal and left prefrontal area. Additionally, the present study points to an improvement of attentional function in schizophrenic patients experiencing auditory hallucinations, both in the clozapine group but also in the olanzapine group. © 2003 Elsevier B.

Why might doing something in the future require the past to be different? Because if determinism is true—if the laws of nature and the initial conditions of the Big Bang determined a unique future for our universe—then doing anything other than what you are determined to do would require one of two things: either a miracle, a violation of the actual laws of nature, or a different past, {{all the way back to}} the Big Bang or beyond.

There are indications that fearful birds are more likely to develop FP. Furthermore, <b>FP</b> can <b>lead</b> to increased fearfulness in the victims. To investigate further the relationship between FP and fearfulness, feather damage and behavioural fear responses were recorded in three White Leghorn lines of laying hens: a line selected for high FP (HFP line), a line selected for low FP (LFP line) and an unselected control line (10 th generation of selection). We used 64 birds per line housed in 16 four-bird cages (cage was the experimental unit). At 25 weeks of age, birds were subjected to a tonic immobility (TI) test and a combined human approach (HA) and novel object (NO) test, and plumage condition was recorded. Line differences in fear responses between the HFP and LFP lines were not found, neither in the TI-test, nor in the HA or NO test. As expected, birds from the HFP line had considerably more feather damage than birds from the LFP line and birds from the unselected control line were intermediate. Cages that withdrew from the NO 30 s after placement had more feather damage on the back compared with cages that did not show a withdrawal response. These results suggest that although relationships were found between feather damage and fear response at cage level, lines divergently selected on feather pecking behaviour do not differ in their fear responses.

Methods In order to address this question the present study aimed at investigating the auditory N 100 component elicited during a WM test in 38 dyslexic children in comparison to those of 19 unaffected sibling controls. Both groups met the criteria of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD- 10). ERP were evoked by two stimuli, a low (500 Hz) and a high (3000 Hz) frequency tone indicating forward and reverse digit span respectively. Results As compared to their sibling controls, dyslexic children exhibited significantly reduced N 100 amplitudes induced by both reverse and forward digit span at Fp 1, F 3, Fp 2, Fz, C 4, Cz and F 4 and at Fp 1, F 3, C 5, C 3, Fz, F 4, C 6, P 4 and <b>Fp</b> 2 <b>leads</b> respectively. Memory performance of the dyslexics group was not significantly lower than that of the controls.

40|$|There is {{a debate}} whether {{electromagnetic}} field (EMF) emitted by mobile phones (MP) {{have an effect on}} cognitive functions. Since the auditory P 50 component of event-related potentials (ERPs) reflects pre-attentive processing and working memory (WM) operation, the present study was designed to investigate whether the exposure to MP-EMF affects the patterns of the P 50 component of ERPs elicited during a WM test. The P 50 elicited during a WM task and evoked by two warning stimuli low and high frequency (500 and 3000 Hz) has been assessed in 19 normal subjects (10 women and 9 men) both without and with exposure to a 900 MHz signal, emitted by a dipole antenna placed near the subjects. Results showed that the presence of MP-EMFs induced statistically significant increase in the amplitude of P 50 evoked by the low frequency stimuli, at Fp 1 and O 1 electrode leads as compared to themselves without MP-EMF exposure. In contrast the exposure to MP-EMFs revealed statistically significant decrease of the amplitude of P 50 evoked by the high frequency stimuli, at <b>Fp</b> 1 electrode <b>lead</b> as compared to themselves without MP-EMF exposure. These findings provide evidence that the MP-EMF emitted by mobile phone affect pre-attentive information processing as it is reflected in P 50 evoked potential.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} proteins that could inhibit the activity of the peptide sequence representing the N-terminal of the surface protein gp 41 of HIV, corresponding to the fusion peptide of the virus (HIV- 1 FP). To do this we synthesized and studied 58 peptides corresponding to the envelope protein E 1 of the hepatitis G virus (GBV-C). Five of the E 1 synthetic peptides: NCCAPEDIGFCLEGGCLV (P 7), APEDIGFCLEGGCLVALG (P 8), FCLEGGCLVALGCTICTD (P 10), QAGLAVRPGKSAAQLVGE (P 18) and AQLVGELGSLYGPLSVSA (P 22) were capable of inhibiting the leakage of vesicular contents caused by HIV- 1 FP. A series of experiments were carried out to determine how these E 1 peptides interact with HIV- 1 FP. Our studies analyzed the interactions with and without the presence of lipid membranes. Isothermal titration calorimetry revealed that the binding of P 7, P 18 and P 22 peptides to HIV- 1 FP is strongly endothermic, and that binding is entropy-driven. Gibbs energy for the process indicates a spontaneous binding between E 1 peptides and HIV- 1 FP. Moreover, confocal microscopy of Giant Unilamellar Vesicles revealed that the disruption of the lipid bilayer by HIV- 1 FP alone was inhibited by the presence of any of the five selected peptides. Our results highlight that these E 1 synthetic peptides could be involved in preventing the entry of HIV- 1 by binding to the HIV- 1 FP. Therefore, the continued study into the interaction between GBV-C peptides and HIV- 1 <b>FP</b> could <b>lead</b> to the development of new therapeutic agents for the treatment of AIDS.

40|$|When malaria parasites digest hemoglobin, they release FP intracellularly. FP is an {{oxidized}} form of heme {{which is}} toxic for biological membranes. The parasites are not poisoned when they digest hemoglobin, however, because they sequester FP in hemozoin. In fact, the refractile, dark brown substance in hemozoin is sequestered FP. Chloroquine binds tightly to nonhemozoin FP and, under certain circumstances, enhances its toxicity. In addition, chloroquine interferes with FP sequestration and causes toxic nonhemozoin FP to accumulate to lethal levels in erythrocytes parasitized with malaria parasites. Evidently, {{this is how}} chloroquine kills malaria parasites. It is desirable, therefore, {{to know more about}} FP sequestration and how it is affected by chloroquine. Malaria parasites possess a catalyst for FP sequestration which is modulated by treatment with quinoline antimalarial drugs such as chloroquine and quinine. Chloroquine treatment causes the activity of the catalyst to decrease by 80 to 90 percent. Quinine treatment has no obvious direct effect on the catalyst for FP sequestration. Nevertheless, quinine treatment antagonizes and reverses the chloroquine-induced loss of ability to sequester FP. The effect of chloroquine treatment also is antagonized by various metabolic inhibitors, including inhibitors of protein biosynthesis such as cycloheximide. These findings indicate that chloroquine, like quinine, does not interact directly with the catalyst for FP sequestration. Instead, they are evidence that chloroquine acts by increasing the amount, accessibility, or reactivity of a regulator of the catalyst for FP sequestration. I propose that chloroquine increases the amount of the regulator, which inactivates the catalyst for <b>FP</b> sequestration, which <b>leads</b> to accumulation of nonhemozoin FP, which binds with high-affinity to chloroquine and which ultimately kills the malaria parasite...|$|R
40|$|F-box only protein 7 (Fbxo 7), {{a member}} of the F-box-only {{subfamily}} of FBPs, is a biologically and pathophysiologically important human protein that assumes many critical functions. The different functions of Fbxo 7 depend on the formation of various multi-protein complexes. Possible interplay between different Fbxo 7 functions further complicate the protein-protein interaction networks involved in Fbxo 7 biology. Although significant progresses have been made to understand the functions, regulation, specificity, and protein interaction network of Fbxo 7, a myriad of questions remain to be answered. The objectives of the work presented in this dissertation are to elucidate the molecular structures underlying the functions of Fbxo 7 and the interaction with its protein partners, such as proteasome inhibitor PI 31. The best known biological function of Fbxo 7 is its role as the substrate-recognition subunit of the SCFFbxo 7 (Skp 1 -Cul 1 -F-box protein) E 3 ubiquitin ligase that catalyzes the ubiquitination of hepatoma up-regulated protein (HURP) and inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP). Fbxo 7 also assumes various SCF-independent functions through interact with its protein partners that are not the substrates of the ubiquitin proteasome system, such as PI 31, Cdk 6, p 27, PINK 1 (PTEN-induced kinase 1), and Parkin. PI 31 is a known proteasome regulator which was initially characterized as a proteasome inhibitor in vitro. The binding affinity between Fbxo 7 and PI 31 is very strong, and The Fbxo 7 -PI 31 interaction is mediated by heterodimerization of the FP domains of the two proteins. This work is focus on study the protein structure of the two FP domains in Fbxo 7 and PI 3. Chapter 1 reviewed the F-box-only protein Fbxo 7 biology including the function of Fbxo 7 protein in ubiquitination proteasome pathway and some SCF-independent functions which are relate to human disease. Chapter 2 discussed the function of proteasome inhibitor PI 31. With the many important biological functions, Fbxo 7 is clearly an extraordinary important protein, but the lack of structural knowledge has hampered efforts to achieve a better understanding of Fbxo 7 biology. In this work, we have determined the crystal structure of Fbxo 7 FP domain (residues 181 - 335) and the crystal structure of the PI 31 FP domain (residues 1 - 161) using a longer protein construct both at 2. 0 Å resolution. The Fbxo 7 FP domain adopts an α/β-fold {{similar to that of the}} PI 31 FP domain and the secondary structure elements of the two FP domains are comparable including the C-terminal helix, indicating that the two FP domains share the same overall global fold. However, an α helix and three β strands in the Fbxo 7 are longer than their counterparts in the PI 31 FP domain. The two FP domains also differ substantially in the length and conformation of the longest connecting loop. More importantly, structural differences between the two <b>FP</b> domains <b>lead</b> to drastically different modes of inter-domain protein–protein interaction: the PI 31 FP domain utilizes either an α interface or β interface for homodimeric interaction, whereas the Fbxo 7 FP domain utilizes an αβ interface. We have note that the inter-domain interaction of the Fbxo 7 FP domain is much more extensive, featuring a larger contact surface area, better shape complementarity and more hydrophobic and hydrogen-bonding interactions. The results of this structural study provide critical insights into how Fbxo 7 may dimerize (or multimerize) and interact with PI 31 via the FP domain. Chapter 4 and Chapter 5 discussed the structure determinations, structure features and detail of protein-protein interactions of Fbxo 7 and PI 31 FP domains. Chapter 2 reviewed the corresponding fundamental biochemical techniques that been used in this study. Chapter 3 discussed protein structure determination by X-ray crystallography in structural biology studies. It was believed that the FP domains of Fbxo 7 and PI 31 mediate homodimerization and heterodimerization of the proteins and the FP domain is not present in other human proteins. In order to study the Fbxo 7 -PI 31 heterodimerization protein-protein interactions, we performed modeling studies. Chapter 6 discussed the model building and binding studies. Based on the result of model building studies, we propose that an interaction between the two FP domains of Fbxo 7 and PI 31 should be mediated by a αβ interface using the α-helical surface of the Fbxo 7 FP domain and the β-sheet surface of the PI 31 FP domain. According to the result of pull down assay, the PI 31 FP domain may complete with Skp 1 for the binding with Fbxo 7. It is possible that the formation of heterodimer between the Fbxo 7 and PI 31 mediate by <b>FP</b> domains may <b>lead</b> to the Fbxo 7 dissociation from SCFFbxo 7 complex which might reveal a new regulation mechanism...|$|R
40|$|The {{uncontrolled}} {{release of}} radioactive fission {{products from the}} primary circuit of a nuclear power reactor, described as “release source term”, {{is one of the}} major criteria for assessing a severe nuclear accident. A large number of tests were carried out under the European Commission (EC) Framework Programmes to improve our understanding of the fission product behaviour. Especially the five integral pile tests that were carried out in the Phébus <b>FP</b> programme <b>lead</b> to an increased understanding of the mechanisms of severe accidents, but also emphasized the need of further separate effect tests to study some individual phenomena in more detail. One of these was the possibility of chemical revaporisation of fission products (especially 137 Cs) after their initial deposition inside the primary circuit or containment. This revaporisation can lead to a significant release in the late phase of a severe accident which was previously not taken into account when calculating the release source term. To study this behaviour using realistic samples of fission product deposits, which were obtained from the Phébus test circuit, a lead shielded revaporisation device was designed and set-up inside a glove box. In the device, a compact high temperature furnace is used to heat the samples under a controlled gas flow up to 1273 K with nearly ambient pressure. The gas flow is slow enough to prevent physical resuspension. It consists of hydrogen, steam, air or argon. An on-line gamma spectroscopy system is used to scrutinize the revaporisation behaviour by monitoring the loss of activity for the 137 Cs in the sample. In the most recent test sequence, consisting of 3 experiments, samples from the Phébus FPT 3 upper vertical line were heated with 2 K/min up to 1273 K under steam, hydrogen or air. The tests showed similar results for the two experiments under oxidising conditions (steam or air) were used as process gas. Revaporisation started for steam at ~ 810 K respectively for air at ~ 860 K and progressed for some time with a loss of activity equal to ~ 1 %/min. More than ~ 90 % of the 137 Cs had revaporised at the end of the experiment. The experiment using reducing conditions (pure hydrogen) showed diverse results. The revaporisation did not start before ~ 955 K and progressed with a slower loss of activity (~ 0. 7 %/min). The total amount of revaporisation was only 79 %, which was caused by a power outage which the system experienced before the planned heating sequence had finished. Nevertheless, the results show that revaporisation is possible and that a switch in the atmospheric conditions (reducing to oxidising) lowers the threshold temperature which is necessary to trigger revaporisation. For the last experiment a sampling method was introduced to determine the size and chemical composition of the aerosols that form after the process gas is cooled down. Analysis showed a large number of particles in the diameter range 8 - 20 nm and EDX revealed Cs, Re and Si to be their main components. JRC. E. 2 -Safety of Irradiated Nuclear Material...|$|R
40|$|The International Space Station (ISS) orbits {{near the}} F-peak of the {{ionosphere}} (approximately 400 km altitude). Generally, satellites orbiting at this altitude {{would have a}} floating potential (FP) of approximately - 1 V due to the electron temperature (Te). However, the ISS has 8 large negatively grounded 160 V solar array wings (SAW) that collect a significant electron current from the ionosphere. This current drives the ISS FP much more negative during insolation and is highly dependent on the electron density (Ne). Also, due {{to the size of}} the ISS, magnetic inductance caused by the geomagnetic field produces a delta potential up to 40 V across the truss, possibly producing positive potentials. During Extravehicular Activity (EVA) the negative <b>FP</b> can <b>lead</b> to an arcing hazard when it exceeds - 45. 5 V, and the positive FP can produce a DC current high enough to stimulate the astronaut's muscles and also cause a hazard. Data collected from the Floating Potential Monitoring Unit (FPMU) have shown that the probability of either of these hazards occurring during times with quiet to moderately disturbed geomagnetic activity is low enough to no longer be considered a risk. However, a study of the ionosphere Ne during severe geomagnetic storm activity has shown that the Ne can be enhanced by a factor of 6 in the ISS orbit. As a result, the ISS Safety Review Panel (SRP) requires that ionospheric conditions be monitored using the FPMU in conjunction with the ISS Plasma Interaction Model (PIM) to determine if a severe geomagnetic storm could result in a plasma environment that could produce a hazard. A 'Real-Time' plasma hazard assessment process was developed to support ISS Program real-time decision making providing constraint relief information for EVAs planning and operations. This process incorporates 'real time' ionospheric conditions, ISS solar arrays' orientation, ISS flight attitude, and where the EVA will be performed on the ISS. This assessment requires real time data that is presently provided by the FPMU including ISS floating potential, along with ionospheric Ne and Te, in order to determine the present environment. Once the present environment conditions are known to be either above, below, or near the current IRI values, the IRI is used to forecast what the environment could become in the event of a severe geomagnetic storm. If the FPMU should fail, the Space Environments team needs another source of data which is utilized to support a short-term forecast for EVAs. The IRI Real-Time Assimilative Mapping (IRTAM) model is an ionospheric model that uses real time measurements from approximately 70 digisondes to produce foF 2 and hmF 2 global maps in 15 minute cadence. The Boeing Space Environments team has used the IRI coefficients produced in IRTAM to calculate the Ne along the ISS orbital track. The results of the IRTAM model have been compared to FPMU measurements and show excellent agreement (figure 1). IRTAM has been identified as a potential FPMU back-up system will be used as a backup for the FPMU to support the ISS Program following completion of an FPMU/IRTAM validation campaign...|$|R
