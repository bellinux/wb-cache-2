40|$|The {{evolution}} of the UK’s high profile and first ever Direct-Entry (DE) Superintendents programme followed the recommendations for policing identified by Winsor (2012) and the UK Government’s vision of enabling “fresh thinking and fresh blood [to be] brought in from outside the profession” (Green, 2013). The eighteen-month DE programme aims to attract highly talented and proven leaders from alternative sectors directly into <b>executive</b> <b>policing</b> roles. The College of Policing’s (2015) own review identifies the importance for executive leaders to demonstrate on-going personal development. As a result a joint College of Policing and Teesside University team worked together to develop the Post Graduate Certificate in Strategic Police Leadership which was mapped onto the new DE education and training programme, resulting {{in the provision of}} an educational award which meets the needs of the contemporary police service. The programme has been designed primarily to be both academically and vocationally challenging, recognising the education and training previously completed by direct entry superintendents, who may not have any previous policing experience, who are joining the police service in senior executive roles. The aim being that on successful completion of the eighteen-month mandatory higher educational programme, learners will be able to operate independently across a wide range of strategic leadership deployments as competent uniformed superintendents, bringing with them a range of new skills and ideas to the service...|$|E
40|$|Contemporary peace {{operations}} are characterised by a complex nature. Many tasks {{are carried out}} and numerous actors are involved in fulfilling them. The de-velopment of peacekeeping operations started in 1947 with observer tasks pro-vided by military personnel. The police forces {{have been involved in}} peace operations since 1960 (first participation in United Nations Operation in the Con-go). Today the tasks of the police in peace missions range from monitoring, con-sulting, education and training to <b>executive</b> <b>policing.</b> South-Eastern Europe is region, where the police peacekeeping is becoming very important part of the general peacekeeping after armed conflicts, and it is gaining more and more importance in the whole range of mentioned tasks. There are different international settings in which policemen cooperated in peacekeep-ing, from WEU, OSCE, UN to EU. The policemen participated in missions in Albania, currently they still serve in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kosovo, Macedonia. Currently the UN mission in Kosovo represents the operation with largest police force in the region, on the other hand the EU takes over many international police efforts (with the EU Police Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina and EUPOL Proxima in Macedonia). The police from different world countries con-tributed the personnel to the missions in region, and additionally, the police from the region contributed significant number of police troops to different missions all over the world. Slovenian police is one of those that successfully joined the club of police peacekeepers after 1997. Slovenian policemen in peace operations in South-Eastern Europe had or have been working under the authorities of WEU, UN OSCE and EU. Their peacekeeping experiences are systematically evaluated and integrated into preparations for new deployments...|$|E

40|$|SYNOPSIS The {{international}} {{presence in}} Kosovo {{is an example}} of full international administration. Its most important obligation is arguably to provide a safe and secure environment for all inhabitants, in which they can establish relations and structures for peaceful co-existence {{with the help of the}} international community. Both military and civilian agencies (KFOR and UNMIK) and many nations are involved in this project. However, history as well as research in international relations and organizational theory dictate an expectation that numerous and varied goals and preferences exist in such a scenario. This dissertation asks whether success criteria influence civil-military cooperation in the security sector of the international administration of Kosovo. An examination of KFOR and UNMIK with regards to their actual cooperation patterns in the security sector revealed conspicuous institutional differences. KFOR appears as a collection of organizational units between which there are command lines that cannot be used to issue proper orders due to national reluctance to relinquish control of their personnel. UNMIK appears more coherent institutionally, but lacks the resources and force to execute all their duties. The nature of security challenges and the resource situation have necessitated military engagement in <b>executive</b> <b>policing,</b> but KFOR and UNMIK are both reluctant due to institutional differences and preferences. KFOR and UNMIK seem to operate with partly the same success criteria – the UN mandate – and partly separate ones. The time horizon stands out as an unsorted issue, as KFOR looks to withdraw as soon as possible while UNMIK looks to stay until the situation is stable and self-sustainable. Due to these and other factors, security cooperation has to a significant degree assumed the form of ad hoc projects and solutions conducted on local and regional levels. Streamlined, uniform success criteria would probably offer enhanced economy and efficiency of joint efforts. On the other hand, it seems like the lack thereof may offer a desirable flexibility to effectuate rapid, tailored initiatives in response to sudden and unexpected challenges...|$|E

50|$|The {{question}} of Hindu-Muslim {{balance in the}} bureaucracy was a sensitive one. Muslims had predominated in the <b>executive,</b> <b>police</b> and administrative services. Before the invasion, the Indian Cabinet, with Nehru's leadership, decided {{that there would be}} as few changes as possible. However, Patel, who had a well-known rivalry with Nehru, ran his Ministry with little consultation with the Indian Cabinet. The initial plans were not followed after the invasion, partly due to different ideas at various levels of administration. Over a hundred officers were dismissed on an ethnic basis, from all levels, and many local officers were detained for their role in the violence. This pattern was seen in new hirings as well.|$|R
5000|$|To {{reduce the}} {{potential}} for violence, <b>police</b> <b>executives</b> must inculcate the values articulated by policy and procedure into two levels of the police department: the administrative level and the [...] "line" [...] or operational level. To accomplish the task of value-transition on one level without doing so on the other is futile, for no change in police behavior will result. In addition to the two levels of the organization which the <b>police</b> <b>executive</b> must address, two dimensions of law enforcement must also be addressed: the police culture and various community cultures. Thus, to effect change in police-community violence, <b>police</b> <b>executives</b> must take a multidimensional approach. Traditional approaches to reform have been one-dimensional, and have met with little success.|$|R
