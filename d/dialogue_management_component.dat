These components need to be evaluated, both intrinsically, to gauge development approaches, and extrinsically to measure subjective performance. We introduce a Natural Language Dialogue System, the YPA, developed at the University of Essex, that accesses classified directory information such as British Telecom's Yellow Pages. These directories contain much useful but hard-to-access information, especially in the free text in semi-display advertisements.

40|$|Abstract This paper {{proposes a}} new {{technique}} to test the performance of spoken dialogue systems by artificially simulating the behaviour of three types of user (very cooperative, coop-erative and not very cooperative) interacting with a system by means of spoken dialogues. Experiments using the technique were carried out to test {{the performance of a}} previously developed dialogue system designed for the fast-food domain and working with two kinds of language model for automatic speech recognition: one based on 17 prompt-dependent language models, and the other based on one prompt-independent language model. The use of the simulated user enables the identification of problems relating to the speech recogni-tion, spoken language understanding, and <b>dialogue</b> <b>management</b> <b>components</b> of the system. In particular, in these experiments problems were encountered with the recognition and understanding of postal codes and addresses and with the lengthy sequences of repetitive confirmation turns required to correct these errors. By employing a simulated user in a range of different experimental conditions sufficient data can be generated to support a systematic analysis of potential problems and to enable fine-grained tuning of the system...|$|R

40|$|Introduction Simple {{question}} answering systems {{are no longer}} enough to answer the complex questions asked by users, and increasingly there {{is the need to}} enter into dialogue in order to refine or reiterate user requests. Complex <b>Dialogue</b> <b>Management</b> (DM) <b>components</b> have been developed which allow users to have a more intelligent style of interaction with their information systems. More recently there have been efforts to abstract the principles of DM design, with a view to creating flexible, possibly portable DM systems (Agarwal, 1997; Dybkjaer et al., 1998). Within DM design itself research seems principally focused on two strands of development, either modelling dialogue cognitively (conversation as a collaborative task) or modelling linguistically (capturing individual features of discourse). Both of these remain as important research goals, but for the simplified dialogues which occur in some information retrieval systems, they may represent unrealistic aims. This paper...|$|R
40|$|Our overall program {{objective}} is to provide more natural ways for soldiers to interact and communicate with robots, much like how soldiers communicate with other soldiers today. We describe how the Wizard-of-Oz (WOz) method {{can be applied to}} multimodal human-robot dialogue in a collaborative exploration task. While the WOz method can help design robot behaviors, traditional approaches place the burden of decisions on a single wizard. In this work, we consider two wizards to stand in for robot navigation and <b>dialogue</b> <b>management</b> software <b>components.</b> The scenario used to elicit data is one in which a human-robot team is tasked with exploring an unknown environment: a human gives verbal instructions from a remote location and the robot follows them, clarifying possible misunderstandings as needed via dialogue.

40|$|The {{application}} of machine learning methods to the <b>dialogue</b> <b>management</b> <b>component</b> of spoken dialogue systems {{is a growing}} research area. Whereas traditional methods use handcrafted rules to specify a dialogue policy, machine learning techniques seek to learn dialogue behaviours from a corpus of training data. In this paper, we identify the properties of a corpus suitable for training machine-learning techniques, and propose a framework for collecting dialogue data. The approach is akin to a "Wizard of Oz" set-up with a "wizard" and a "user", but introduces several novel variations to simulate the ASR communication-channel. Specifically, a turn-taking model common in spoken dialogue system is used, and rather than hearing the user directly, the wizard sees simulated speech recognition results on a screen. The simulated recognition results are produced with an error-generation algorithm which allows the target WER to be adjusted. An evaluation of the algorithm is presented...|$|E
30|$|We {{extracted}} raw {{features as}} well as normalized versions of the features. In some cases, the normalized versions seem to be both more predictive and more interpretable. For instance, the number of hints could vary a lot from simpler/short problems, where the solution is relatively short and require less scaffolding in general, to more complex problems with longer solutions which require more scaffolding as there are more steps in the solution. A normalized feature such as percentage of hints {{would allow us to}} better compare the level of scaffolding in terms of hints across problems of varying complexity or solution length. In our case, we normalized the number of hints by using the maximum number of hints a student may get for a particular problem which happens when the student responds entirely incorrectly to every single hint from the computer tutor. We can infer the largest number of helpful moves, i.e. hints, from our <b>dialogue</b> <b>management</b> <b>component</b> a priori.|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- Utterances {{used by a}} human while framing a {{response}} during the interaction with a software agent like Spoken Dialogue system(SDS) carries a lot of valuable information {{with regards to the}} internal mental state of the user. Opinion mining is an analysis of the mental state of a person, his opinion, appraisal or emotion towards an event, entities or their attributes. The users level of certainty about a topic could be determined by the analysis not only of the text used in the utterance but by studying the prosody information structure. Prosody reveals Information about the context by highlighting information structure and aspects of the speaker hearer relationship. Most often it is observed that the speaker‘s internal state is not depicted by the words he uses but by the tone of his utterance or facial expression of the user. In this paper we had analyzed a sample of student‘s after a lecture on operating system‘s subject and used the prosodic features of each dialogue with the student based on few questions. It was determined whether the students were certain, uncertain or neutral about their understanding of the lecture contents. This paper uses PRAAT a software tool for speech analysis which uses 15 acoustic features to determine the certainty of the responses of the user through classification by RAPIDMINER based on the prosody information which will actually aid the <b>dialogue</b> <b>management</b> <b>component</b> of the SDS in framing a better dialogue strategy...|$|E

40|$|The <b>management</b> of man-computer <b>dialogues</b> {{involves}} policies, procedures, and methodologies {{that enable}} users and designers to control, monitor, {{and enhance the}} user-computer interface. Effective <b>dialogue</b> <b>management</b> can be facilitated by a computer-aided work-bench of <b>dialogue</b> <b>management</b> tools that integrate pertinent environmental attributes into executable dialogue forms. Consequently, a methodology for generating dialogue designs is required. This research presents a framework for modeling user-computer interactions, or dialogues. The approach taken herein focuses on analysis of task, user, and information technology attributes. This analytical framework isolates dialogue entities and entity groupings. Together, these entities and their groupings suggest a language for information presentation and elicitation in the user-computer dialogue process. As a result, alternative dialogue models can be specified independent of hardware and software technologies. Furthermore, these models can be evaluated to ensure completeness, consistency, and integrity. Under this framework, various <b>dialogue</b> <b>management</b> functions can be integrated into a generalized <b>dialogue</b> <b>management</b> environment. Such an environment facilitates the transformation of task, user, and information technology attributes into executable dialogue definitions.

The generic model is abstracted {{from a number}} of real application systems targetted at very different domains. Our research aim in developing this generic template is to investigate a new approach to the evaluation of <b>Dialogue</b> <b>Management</b> Systems.

40|$|Steps towards Multi-Party Dialogue ManagementAbstract The aim of {{this work}} is to enable the {{construction}} of artificial conversational agents capable of working in a multi-party setting. By an artificial conversational agent we mean a software agent (possibly with embodiment, personality etc.), capable of engaging in conversation with other conversational agents (human or artificial). By a multi-party setting we mean that more than two agents are engaged in the communication or dialogue. Components designed for two-party <b>dialogue</b> <b>management</b> including sequencing and turn management cannot, in general, handle multi-party dialogue phenomena, such as {{keeping track of the}} obligations regarding turn management and the rights and obligations to address an issue. We present an SCXML implementation of Issue-Based <b>Dialogue</b> <b>Management,</b> scaled up to handle more than two participants. The QUD-based dialogue manager makes a distinction between distributive questions (to be answered individually by each addressee) and collective questions (to be answered by the addressees collectively), in order to provide the right kind of grounding behaviour and in order to manage correctly the obligations put on the participants of the dialogue.
