5|$|Asa Gray (November 18, 1810 – January 30, 1888) is {{considered}} the most important American botanist of the 19thcentury.

Gray was adamant that a genetic connection must exist between all members of a species.

5|$|Butterflies {{have the}} typical four-stage insect life cycle. Winged adults lay eggs {{on the food}} plant on which their larvae, known as {{caterpillars}}, will feed. The caterpillars grow, sometimes very rapidly, and when fully developed, pupate in a chrysalis. When metamorphosis is complete, the pupal skin splits, the adult insect climbs out, and after its wings have expanded and dried, it flies off. Some butterflies, especially in the tropics, have several generations in a year, while others have a single <b>generation,</b> <b>and</b> a few in cold locations may take several years to pass through their whole life cycle.|$|E

5|$|Heating {{oil shale}} to a {{sufficiently}} high temperature causes the chemical process of pyrolysis {{to yield a}} vapor. Upon cooling the vapor, the liquid shale oil—an unconventional oil—is separated from combustible oil-shale gas (the term shale gas can also refer to gas occurring naturally in shales).

As the inflation rate grew during the period, the state financed part of these prices with subsidies. Investment in these areas decreased, and the <b>generation</b> <b>and</b> distribution networks suffered. Argentina lost its self-supply of energy, and had to import it, rather than being able to export surpluses.|$|E
