25|$|The {{keyboard}} LED uses blink codes: one blink {{means the}} keyboard ROM has a checksum error, two blinks means RAM failure, three blinks means watchdog timer failure. Using Caps Lock key {{and getting a}} response means CIA and the CPU works. There {{is no guarantee that}} every blinking state or color is accurate. Remember when the diagnostic codes are triggered it means the computer <b>has</b> <b>some</b> <b>kind</b> of fault and it can easily mis-interpret the fault and give false readings. For example, if the screen flashes green it can mean the Agnus is bad, the Agnus socket is bad, the logic connected to the Agnus is bad, the logic connected to the CPU is bad, the logic connected to the RAM is bad, a connection between CPU and/or logic and/or Agnus and/or Chip RAM is bad and/or some/all of the chip RAM is faulty etc. etc. Many of the issues with Amigas are caused by damage from corrosion or poor repair skills, especially the A500+ which has a Ni-Cad battery fitted and is always corroded if the battery has not been removed. Likewise a corroded battery on an A501 can cause faults on the A500 motherboard if the corrosion is very bad and has spread to the motherboard. The self-test chip RAM check is very brief and simplistic and all the other tests are minimalistic to minimize the start-up time (as documented in the Amiga Hardware Manual and many other official Commodore technical documents) so {{there is no guarantee that}} any of the diagnostic colours are 100% accurate.|$|E

This {{was because of}} her recent popularity in Monster's Ball, earning her the Academy Award for Best Actress. A budget cut meant that the Sentinels and the Danger Room were dropped. Guy Hendrix Dyas and a production crew had already constructed the Danger Room set. In the words of Dyas, [...] "The control room [...] was a large propeller that actually rotated around the room {{so that you can}} sit up [...] and travel around the subject who {{is in the middle of}} the control room.

[...] Walter suspects Roy is psychic and runs tests on him before realizing Roy <b>has</b> <b>some</b> <b>kind</b> of magnetic compound in his blood. This leads Walter to recall he and his old lab partner William Bell had conducted research on creating a [...] "Ghost Network" [...] to secretly communicate messages {{from one person to}} another in an otherwise undetectable frequency range. During this research, Roy was one of his past test subjects. Walter further theorizes that someone else has perfected his research, and that Roy is overhearing secret messages from some of the people behind the terrorist attacks. Olivia and Peter (Joshua Jackson) arrive at his old house to find equipment needed to tap into Roy's mind.|$|E
500|$|Reception of the game's audio was {{generally}} positive, with IGN {{referring to the}} music as [...] "top-notch" [...] and GamesRadar commenting [...] "The tunes are varied, catchy, match the settings, and show off the PSP's sound system." [...] Comments about the voice acting were lukewarm, however, especially regarding the amount of dialogue in the game. GameSpot referred to the dialogue as [...] "dull" [...] and IGN said [...] "the script itself is a mess." [...] The game's beginning was described as especially slow. [...] The game's art style and visuals were praised. X-Play said [...] "The monsters [...] designs here are creative, detailed takes {{on all kinds of}} different well-known fantasy archetypes." [...] GameZone's reviewer said [...] "The monster details are very good, as is the majority of the artwork", and IGN noted that [...] "Each of the characters also gets nice, crisp art for the conversational scenes." [...] Game Informer, however, mocked the character design, stating [...] "...each of the major heroes <b>has</b> <b>some</b> <b>kind</b> of glaring aesthetic blunder to make fun of. From the biggest faux-hawk in history to tan lines that Itagaki would be ashamed to put on one of his characters, there’s at least some shallow amusement to be had by mocking these hapless digital rejects." ...|$|E

2500|$|The album's artwork {{was shot}} by Mert and Marcus and {{directed}} by Giovanni Bianco. The deluxe edition was unveiled through Madonna's official Facebook page on January 31, 2012. Jocelyn Vena of MTV News described the image as [...] "glamorous, deconstructed photograph" [...] where Madonna [...] "cocks her head up, her curly hair pulled back. She's wearing lots of mascara, bright red lipstick, a choker and a silky bright pink top. The photo <b>has</b> <b>some</b> <b>kind</b> of broken mirror filter over it, giving it a funky, dance-queen vibe." [...] Robbie Daw of Idolator compared the [...] "multi-hued" [...] artwork to the one of True Blue (1986), with the similarity in Madonna's blond locks and the tilting of her head. He further added that the artwork symbolized the different angles through which the singer has been scrutinized throughout her career. The standard edition cover was revealed on February 6, 2012. Its art direction included the same color palette and the distorted appearance like the deluxe version image, but featured a body-shot of Madonna in a red dress and gloves with jewelry.|$|E
2500|$|Researchers Caitlin Buon and Tony Buon have {{suggested}} that attempts to profile ‘the bully’ have been damaging [...] They state that the [...] "bully" [...] profile is that ‘the bully’ is always aware {{of what they are}} doing, deliberately sets out to harm their ‘victims’, targets a particular individual or type of person and <b>has</b> <b>some</b> <b>kind</b> of underlying personality flaw, insecurity or disorder. But this is unproven and lacks evidence. The researchers suggest referring to workplace bullying as generic harassment along with other forms of non-specific harassment and this would enable employees to use less emotionally charged language and start a dialogue about their experiences rather than being repelled by the spectre of being labelled as a pathological predator or having to define their experiences as the victims of such a person. Tony Buon and Caitlin Buon also suggest that the perception and profile of the workplace bully is not facilitating [...] interventions with the problem. They suggest that to make significant progress and achieve behaviour change over the long term then, organisations and individuals need to embrace the notion that everyone must all potentially house ‘the bully’ within them and their organisations. It exists in workplace cultures, belief systems, interactions [...] and [...] emotional competencies and cannot be transformed if externalization and demonization continue the problem by profiling ‘the bully’ rather than talking about behaviours and interpersonal [...] interactions.|$|E
2500|$|Quite a few critics {{cited the}} long and {{fragmented}} development time as {{a major factor in}} the finished product. In a positive review PC Gamer noted that [...] "years of anticipation will spoil Duke Nukem Forever for some", adding, [...] "There’s no reinvention of the genre here, no real attempt at grandeur... Check unrealistic expectations at the door and forget the ancient, hyperbolic promises of self-deluded developers", and concluded, [...] "Don’t expect a miracle. Duke is still the hero we love, but struggles to keep up with modern times." [...] Game Informer, whilst disappointed in the game concluded [...] "I'm glad Gearbox stepped up and finished this game, but after hearing about it for 12 years, I have no desire to relive any of it again. I’m now satisfied in my knowledge of what Duke Nukem Forever is and ready to never talk about it again. Welcome back, Duke. I hope your next game (which is teased after the credits) goes off without a hitch." [...] GiantBomb however concluded that for those [...] "part of that faction that finds yourself so fascinated by this whole project that you need to know how it ends, I recommend you play Duke Nukem Forever for yourself. But I'd practically insist that you do so on the PC and try to wait for a sale. If you're not willing to play a sloppy, cobbled together first-person shooter just because it <b>has</b> <b>some</b> <b>kind</b> of weird historical meaning, though, just forget this ever happened and move on." [...] Jake Denton of Computer and Video Games wrote that parts of the game were fun to play and listed it as one of the [...] "5 most underrated games of 2011", while admitting the game's overall faulty structure. Also Joseph Milne of FPSguru.com featured the game on his list of [...] "Top 5 underrated games" [...] at number 4 on the list.|$|E

60|$|Now, in this short, stormy, {{winter day}} of our {{fleeting}} existence, when you now and then, in the Chapter of Accidents, meet an individual whose acquaintance is a real acquisition, there are all the probabilities against you, that you shall never meet with that valued character more.

As I am a sturdy believer in the powers of darkness, I take these to be the doings of that old author of mischief, the devil.

60|$|I {{will begin}} {{by saying that}} if I thought myself prejudiced against the Jew, I should hold it fairest to leave this subject to a person not {{crippled}} in that way. But I think I have no such prejudice. A few years ago a Jew observed {{to me that there}} was no uncourteous reference to his people in my books, and asked how it happened. It happened because the disposition was lacking. I am quite sure that (bar one) I have no race prejudices, and I think I have no colour prejudices nor caste prejudices nor creed prejudices. Indeed, I know it. I can stand any society. All that I care to know is that a man is a human being--that is enough for me; he can't be any worse. I have no special regard for Satan; but I can at least claim that I have no prejudice against him. It may even be that I lean a little his way, on account of his not having a fair show. All religions issue Bibles against him, and say the most injurious things about him, but we never hear his side. We have none but the evidence for the prosecution, and yet we have rendered the verdict. To my mind, this is irregular. It is un-English; it is un-American; it is French. Without this precedent Dreyfus could not have been condemned. Of course Satan <b>has</b> <b>some</b> <b>kind</b> of a case, it goes without saying. It may be a poor one, but that is nothing; that can be said about any of us. As soon as I can get at the facts I will undertake his rehabilitation myself, if I can find an unpolitic publisher. It is a thing which we ought to be willing to do for any one who is under a cloud. We may not pay Satan reverence, for that would be indiscreet, but we can at least respect his talents. A person who has during all time maintained the imposing position of spiritual head of four-fifths of the human race, and political head of the whole of it, must be granted the possession of executive abilities of the loftiest order. In his large presence the other popes and politicians shrink to midges for the microscope. I would like to see him. I would rather see him and shake him by the tail than any other member of the European Concert. In the present paper I shall allow myself to use the word Jew as if it stood for both religion and race. It is handy; and, besides, that is what the term means to the general world.|$|E
