5000|$|There are two {{significant}} differences between natural lighting and artificial sources. One is {{the character of the}} fill and the other is more rapid fall-off in intensity. In nature skylight fill is omni-directional and usually brighter from above. That [...] "wrap around" [...] characteristic is difficult to duplicate with a directional artificial source. In a <b>fixed</b> <b>studio</b> location it is possible to bounce fill backwards off a white wall to flood the space with indirect reflected light similar to how the sun reflects off the atmosphere. Another way is to supplement a fill source {{from the direction of the}} camera with reflectors placed near the sides of the foreground subject.|$|E

50|$|Another {{challenge}} {{that the members}} had to overcome was physical distance-all members were geographically dispersed over two continents; Mushfiq and Arshad were in Dhaka, Bangladesh, while Imran, Mainul and Mahbub were in the United States. Even with the location constraint, the members started exchanging lyrics and compositions over the internet, using technologies such as, Skype, DropBox, Google+, etc. After months {{of hard work and}} preparing demo tracks at the respective members' home studios, recording dates were <b>fixed</b> and <b>studio</b> time was booked at the Winterland Studios in Minneapolis, Minnesota in United States. Arshad flew to Minneapolis, Minnesota in the United States from Dhaka. Mahbub also flew in from Jackson, Mississippi and the recording of their second album started. The drum tracks for all eleven songs of the album were recorded over two days, during 12-hour shifts on each day. In addition, the composition of the song 'Ei Boshontey' was completed while working on the drum tracks in the studio.|$|R

5000|$|An album may be {{recorded}} in a recording <b>studio</b> (<b>fixed</b> or mobile), in a concert venue, at home, in the field, or {{a mix of}} places.

5000|$|Carl {{subsequently}} {{became the}} musical {{director of the}} band onstage; contracts at that time stipulated that promoters hire [...] "Carl Wilson plus four other musicians". Throughout 1965, Brian still performed live with the Beach Boys, but only on justified occasions. Shortly after completing the recording of the imminent Smiley Smile (1967), the band scheduled two performances in Hawaii for a prospective live album, Lei'd in Hawaii, that would be released on their new record label, Brother Records. Difficulties arose around this time. Johnston refused to travel {{for the reason that}} [...] "it had all got too weird." [...] To alleviate this, Brian was persuaded into making the trip. Ultimately, the band performed too poorly for the material to be released, and the recording allegedly suffered technical problems that could not be <b>fixed</b> in the <b>studio.</b> Brian would not go on another tour with the group until 1976, as part of the [...] "Brian's Back!"

5000|$|The live album {{had been}} {{intended}} to be a single LP disc, but at the suggestion of A&M Records additional shows were recorded and the album expanded to two LPs for release. On the special features for the [...] "Live in Detroit" [...] concert DVD, Frampton commented that some difficulty was encountered in the mixing after the cord to the bass drum mic was pulled, accidentally causing the microphone to face at a 90-degree angle from the drum head. During the concerts, Frampton principally used a distinctive black custom Gibson Les Paul electric guitar (with three humbucking pick-ups as opposed to the usual two). On In the Studio with Redbeard, Frampton said [...] "the album is mostly live except for the first verse of 'Something's Happening', the rhythm electric guitar on 'Show Me the Way' (the talk-box came out but the engineer forgot to move the mike) and the intro piano on 'I Wanna Go to the Sun' were <b>fixed</b> in the <b>studio</b> but the rest was all live (all the guitar solos, acoustic guitars, electric keyboards, drums, bass guitar and rest of vocals) which was unheard of at the time".|$|R
5000|$|Blue Peter {{content is}} wide-ranging. Most {{programmes}} are broadcast live, but usually {{include at least}} one filmed report. There will also often be a demonstration of an activity in the studio, or a music or dance performance. Between the 1960s and 2011 the programme was made at BBC Television Centre, and often came from Studio 1, the fourth-largest TV studio in Britain {{and one of the}} largest in Europe. This enabled Blue Peter to include large-scale demonstrations and performances within the live programme. From the September 2007 series, the programme was broadcast from a small <b>fixed</b> set in <b>Studio</b> 2. However, from 2009 the series began to use the larger studios once more; also more programmes were broadcast in their entirety from the Blue Peter Garden. The show is also famous for its [...] "makes", which are demonstrations of how to construct a useful object or prepare food. These have given rise to the oft-used phrase [...] "Here's one I made earlier", as presenters bring out a perfect and completed version of the object they are making - a phrase credited to Christopher Trace, though Marguerite Patten is another possibility. Trace also used the line [...] "And now for something completely different", which was later taken up by Monty Python. Time is also often given over to reading letters and showing pictures sent in by viewers.|$|R
40|$|Sounding Out The Museum II FRANCIS BACON,' is {{a series}} of works which {{explored}} the practices of performance within Gallery settings. The project built upon the successful Sounding Out the Museum performance in Nimes in June 2008 in which new works were performed in the atrium of the Musee des Beaux Arts {{as a response to the}} Between Two Heads exhibition by Peter Seddon. The Hugh Lane Gallery in Dublin is the site for the famous Francis Bacon Studio. In 1998, John Edwards, Francis Bacon’s sole heir, donated the entire contents of Bacon’s studio at 7 Reece Mews to the Hugh Lane Gallery. The studio was subsequently transported, speck by speck to Dublin andreassembled in the Hugh Lane Gallery. In his book ‘Inside the White Cube’ Brian O’ Doherty defends the ‘real life of the world against the sterilized operating room of the white cube – defends time and change against the myth of the eternality and transcendence of pure form’. The Francis Bacon studio is one such example of the changing landscape of museums and galleries in which the chaotic, the banal, the ad hoc take their place amongst the permanent, stable and the <b>fixed.</b> Consequently, the <b>Studio</b> raises questions for museology. The artist’s studio is a place of trial and error, a place for testing new materials, a place of discarded projects. It is the site in which work is made, but it is not the work. In creating the Francis Bacon Studio at Hugh Lane Gallery, new boundaries are defined in the practices of museology. It is into this context that ensemble Scratch the Surface were invited by the Hugh Lane Gallery to curate a performance which explored through sound and movement questions of hybrid practices in Gallery spaces raised by the Francis Bacon Studio. Hugh Lane Gallery presents Bacon’s studio as a site for artistic and aesthetic interest, similarly the work mounted by ensemble Scratch the Surface raised specific questions around sound, museology and hybrid practices in terms of site and genres. The work ‘upon the place beneath’ by Claudia Kappenberg explored a fascination with ‘process’ through oblique approaches to movement and sound. The project examined the role of ‘preparation’ and ‘chance’ within music improvisation. Similarly, the performance work of Conall Gleeson and Jean Martin examined the role of ‘preparation’ in the production of sound, investigating the process by which sound is produced prior to its performance as well as the production of new sound during the performance, as is the case during music improvisation...|$|R
