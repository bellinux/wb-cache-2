2500|$|Working {{with some}} of Spain's best-known actresses {{including}} Carmen Maura, Victoria Abril, Marisa Paredes and Penélope Cruz, Almodóvar has become famous for his female-centric films, his [...] "sympathetic portrayals of women" [...] and his elevation of [...] "the humdrum spaces of overworked women". He was heavily influenced by classic Hollywood films in which everything happens around a female main character, and aims to continue in that tradition. Almodóvar has frequently spoken {{about how he was}} surrounded by powerful women in his childhood: [...] "Women were very happy, worked hard and always spoke. They <b>handed</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> first sensations and forged my character. The woman represented everything to me, the man was absent and represented authority. I never identified with the male figure: maternity inspires me more than paternity". His portrayal of women in his films have been admired by most critics, but some representations have led to accusations of misogyny. A critic from Popmatters wrote that what [...] "many of the women in Almodóvar's films do have in common, despite their characterization as victim or martyr or heroine, is that they are survivors", noting that Almodóvar is interested in depicting women overcoming tragedies and adversities and the power of close female relationships. Ryan Vlastelica [...] from AVClub wrote: [...] "Many of his characters track a Byzantine plot to a cathartic reunion, a meeting where all can be understood, if not forgiven. They seek redemption". Almodóvar stated that he does not usually write roles for specific actors, but after casting a film, he custom-tailors the characters to suit the actors; he believes his role as a director is a [...] "mirror for the actors - a mirror that can't lie".|$|E
