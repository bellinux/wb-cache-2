5|$|The novel—Grossman's first—was written {{during his}} tenure as a video game designer. The book uses characters, settings, and storylines {{generally}} associated with comic books and superhero fiction, but is written entirely in prose. The story explores how superheroes cope with their powers and <b>interact</b> <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>another.</b> The potential motivations and perspectives of supervillains are also examined. Grossman's book has been variously described as clever, engaging, and fun—but overstuffed with comic book tropes. An audiobook was released along with the hardcover edition, while a movie has been in development since 2008.|$|E
5|$|The plot follows four characters, Karen, Rick, Luke, and Rachel, as {{they arrive}} in the lounge of an airport bar, as they <b>interact</b> <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>another,</b> and as they cope with chaos that erupts as cataclysmic events occur. The story {{addresses}} their motivations and perceptions, {{as well as their}} thoughts on certain themes. There are several minor characters and a fifth main character, Player One, who retells the events that the four main characters experience but from the perspective of an outside observer, like someone exploring a video game environment.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, {{because of}} strict rules forbidding direct {{conversational}} {{interactions between the}} sexes, the gandingan presented a means for teenagers to <b>interact</b> <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>another.</b> Using the gandingan, {{young men and women}} would spend hours teasing, flirting, gossiping, playing guessing games, trading friendly insults and simply conversing with one another. For instance, if friends were telling a boy that a girl liked him but the boy didn’t like her back, the boy wouldn’t resort to telling his friends literally he didn’t like her. Instead, he could use the gandingan to express his reasons and his friends would be able to pick up the message by translating his song.|$|E

5|$|Gliese 876 b is in a 1:2:4 Laplace {{resonance}} {{with the}} inner planet Gliese 876 c {{and the outer}} planet Gliese 876 e: {{in the time it}} takes planet e to complete one orbit, planet b completes two and planet c completes four. This is the second known example of a Laplace resonance, the first being Jupiter's moons Io, Europa and Ganymede. As a result, the orbital elements of the planets change fairly rapidly as they dynamically <b>interact</b> <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>another.</b> The planet's orbit has a low eccentricity, similar to the planets in the Solar System. The semimajor axis of the orbit is only 0.208 AU, less than that of Mercury in the Solar System. However Gliese 876 is such a faint star that this puts it in the outer part of the habitable zone.|$|E
5|$|Judging {{that both}} {{national}} governments and global institutions have proven ineffective in addressing worldwide problems {{that go beyond}} the capacity of individual nation-states to solve, some political scientists critical of New World Order conspiracism, such as Mark C. Partridge, argue that regionalism will be the major force in the coming decades, pockets of power around regional centers: Western Europe around Brussels, the Western Hemisphere around Washington, D.C., East Asia around Beijing, and Eastern Europe around Moscow. As such, the E.U., the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, and the G-20 will likely become more influential as time progresses. The question then is not whether global governance is gradually emerging, but rather how will these regional powers <b>interact</b> <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>another.</b>|$|E
5|$|Most insects, however, lead short {{lives as}} adults, and rarely <b>interact</b> <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> except to mate or compete for mates. A small number exhibit {{some form of}} parental care, where they will at least guard their eggs, and {{sometimes}} continue guarding their offspring until adulthood, and possibly even feeding them. Another simple form of parental care is to construct a nest (a burrow or an actual construction, either {{of which may be}} simple or complex), store provisions in it, and lay an egg upon those provisions. The adult does not contact the growing offspring, but it nonetheless does provide food. This sort of care is typical for most species of bees and various types of wasps.|$|E

25|$|Massively {{multiplayer}} online role-playing games (MMORPGs) are {{a combination}} of role-playing video games and massively multiplayer online games in which {{a very large number}} of players <b>interact</b> <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> within a virtual world.|$|E
25|$|Memory underpins and enables social {{interactions}} {{in a variety}} of ways. In order to engage in successful social interaction, people must be able to remember how they should <b>interact</b> <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>another,</b> whom they have interacted with previously, and what occurred during those interactions.|$|E
50|$|Mudskippers {{are quite}} active when out of water, feeding and <b>interacting</b> <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>another,</b> for example, {{to defend their}} territories and court {{potential}} partners. They are found in tropical, subtropical, and temperate regions, including the Indo-Pacific and the Atlantic coast of Africa.|$|R

It lasted from November 2008 to January 2011.|$|E
25|$|Attachment {{plays a role}} in the way actors <b>interact</b> <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>another.</b> A few {{examples}} include the role of attachment in affect regulation, support, intimacy, and jealousy. These examples are briefly discussed below. Attachment also {{plays a role in}} many interactions not discussed in this article, such as conflict, communication and sexuality.|$|E
25|$|The {{characters}} {{have all been}} slightly altered from the original story in the novel. The plot itself is not a direct adaptation but instead focuses on the individual characters' psycho-dramas which are the scenarios {{that make up the}} game. Notably, none of the characters <b>interact</b> <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> and eventually only one of them will be able to defeat AM.|$|E

25|$|Using {{interaction}} analysis techniques, {{the identified}} gene products could {{be shown to}} <b>interact</b> <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> {{in one or more}} larger protein complexes. If one of the components is missing, this protein complex cannot fulfill its function in the living cell, and it probably comes to the degeneration the same. The function of this protein complex has been suggested to participate in the signal transduction or in the cell adhesion of sensory cells.|$|E
25|$|Multisensory integration, {{also known}} as {{multimodal}} integration, {{is the study of}} how information from the different sensory modalities, such as sight, sound, touch, smell, self-motion and taste, may be integrated by the nervous system. A coherent representation of objects combining modalities enables us to have meaningful perceptual experiences. Indeed, multisensory integration is central to adaptive behavior because it allows us to perceive a world of coherent perceptual entities. Multisensory integration also deals with how different sensory modalities <b>interact</b> <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> and alter each other's processing.|$|E
25|$|Program founders Yaron Binur, Anat Binur, and Assaf Harlap {{became aware}} that many Israelis and Palestinians never {{get a chance to}} <b>interact</b> <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> on a {{personal}} level, even though they grow up and live a few short miles from one another. Inspired by their experiences of multicultural cooperation in international educational institutions, the founders decided that a fast-paced, intensive program in technology would be an ideal medium to bridge the divide. With this vision, they created MEET in the summer of 2004.|$|E
50|$|There {{are other}} less popular {{theories}} {{about the origin of}} the Sarakatsani. Among them E. Makris (1990) believes that they are a pre-Neolithic people, while London-based scholar John Nandris inserts them into a more complex context of nomadic people <b>interacting</b> <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>another,</b> and Arnold van Gennep connects the Sarakatsani with the Yörüks.|$|R

50|$|An {{ecological}} {{relationship is}} the relationship between an organism in its ecosystem. All organisms in an ecosystem are connected in <b>one</b> way or <b>another.</b> Each interaction depends on the one before it.

25|$|The minimal hairpin ribozyme-substrate complex folds into a {{secondary}} structure that includes two domains, each {{consisting of two}} short base paired helices separated by an internal loop. Domain A (helix 1 – loop A – helix 2) contains the substrate and the primary substrate-recognition region of the ribozyme. Domain B (helix 3 – loop B – helix 4) is larger and contains the primary catalytic determinants of the ribozyme. The two domains are covalently joined via a phosphodiester linkage that connects helix 2 to helix 3. These domains must <b>interact</b> <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> in order for catalysis to occur.|$|E
25|$|The first {{graphical}} character-based interactive {{environment is}} Club Caribe. First released as Habitat in 1988, Club Caribe {{was introduced by}} LucasArts for Q-Link customers on their Commodore 64 computers. Users could <b>interact</b> <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>another,</b> chat and exchange items. Although the game's open world was very basic, its use of online avatars (already well-established off-line by Ultima and other games) and the combination of chat and graphics was revolutionary. Online graphics in the late 1980s were severely restricted {{by the need to}} support modem data transfer rates as low as 300 bits per second. Habitat's graphics were stored locally on floppy disk, eliminating the need for network transfer.|$|E
25|$|Wikipedia, {{an online}} encyclopedia, {{is a good}} example of New Media, {{combining}} Internet accessible digital text, images and video with web-links, creative participation of contributors, interactive feedback of users and formation of a participant community of editors and donors for the benefit of non-community readers. Facebook is another type of New Media, belonging to the category of social media model, in which most users are also participants. Another type of New Media is Twitter which also belongs to the social media category, through which users <b>interact</b> <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> and make announcements to which the public receive. Both Facebook and Twitter have risen in usage in recent years and have become an online resource for acquiring information.|$|E
