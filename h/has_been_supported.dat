5|$|The {{implementation}} of SBS on the Woodhaven/Cross Bay corridor <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>supported</b> by transit advocates and bus riders, {{particularly those in}} the Rockaways. However, many residents of the communities north of the Rockaways, particularly car users and business owners, have opposed the Select Bus Service project. Much of the opposition has been due to the {{implementation of}} bus lanes {{down the center of the}} boulevard, which could cause increased traffic congestion. The plan in April 2015 would have prohibited left-turns at twelve intersections.|$|E

5|$|Attalea {{is a large}} genus of palms {{native to}} Mexico, the Caribbean, Central and South America. This pinnately leaved, non-spiny genus {{includes}} both small palms lacking an aboveground stem and large trees. The genus has a complicated taxonomic history, and has often been split into four or five genera based on differences in the male flowers. Since the genera can only be distinguished {{on the basis of}} their male flowers, the existence of intermediate flower types and the existence of hybrids between different genera has been used as an argument for keeping them all in the same genus. This <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>supported</b> by a recent molecular phylogeny.|$|E
5|$|In 2013 {{an appeal}} to raise £3 million was {{launched}} to restore the pools. The fundraising <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>supported</b> by The Prince's Trust. The project aims not just to preserve the existing architecture, but also to reopen it as an outdoor lido. This is hampered by poor access to the site {{and the possibility of}} flooding. It is intended to make the work sustainable and environmentally friendly, with renewable sources of energy including water source heat pumps using latent heat from the River Avon. A small landing stage is being proposed to enable access to the pools from river craft.|$|E
5|$|The {{book was}} {{the first volume of}} three Darwin wrote about the geology he had {{investigated}} during the voyage, and was widely recognised as a major scientific work that presented his deductions from all the available observations on this large subject. In 1853, Darwin was awarded the Royal Society's Royal Medal for the monograph and for his work on barnacles. Darwin's theory that coral reefs formed as the islands and surrounding areas of crust subsided <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>supported</b> by modern investigations, and is no longer disputed, while the cause of the subsidence and uplift of areas of crust has continued to be a subject of discussion.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} coffin of Thutmose I {{was taken}} over and re-used by a later pharaoh of the 21st dynasty. The mummy of Thutmose I {{was thought to be}} lost, but Egyptologist Gaston Maspero, largely on the strength of familial resemblance to the mummies of Thutmose II and Thutmose III, believed he had found his mummy in the otherwise unlabelled mummy #5283. This identification <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>supported</b> by subsequent examinations, revealing that the embalming techniques used came from the appropriate period of time, almost certainly after that of Ahmose I and made {{during the course of the}} Eighteenth dynasty.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} {{numerous}} debates as {{to the nature of}} Van Gogh's illness and its effect on his work, and many retrospective diagnoses have been proposed. The consensus is that Van Gogh had an episodic condition with periods of normal functioning. Perry was the first to suggest bipolar disorder in 1947, and this <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>supported</b> by the psychiatrists Hemphill and Blumer. Biochemist Wilfred Arnold has countered that the symptoms are more consistent with acute intermittent porphyria, noting that the popular link between bipolar disorder and creativity might be spurious. Temporal lobe epilepsy with bouts of depression has also been suggested. Whatever the diagnosis, his condition was likely worsened by malnutrition, overwork, insomnia and alcohol.|$|E
5|$|Upon release, Halo Wars 2 {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} professional critics. The campaign cinematics, created by Blur Studio, were lauded for their outstanding animation quality. Reviewers found {{the game to}} be very approachable to beginners but {{felt that it was}} in need of more strategic depth to gain popularity amongst experienced RTS players. Several nuisances present in the game's keyboard and mouse controls left some critics disappointed, however, enhancements made to the gamepad control scheme from the first Halo Wars were praised. Post-release, the game <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>supported</b> with additional content and updates such as support for cross-platform play. A campaign expansion, titled Awakening the Nightmare, was released in 2017.|$|E

5|$|From 1000 onwards, {{references}} to castles in texts such as charters increased greatly. Historians have interpreted this {{as evidence of}} a sudden {{increase in the number}} of castles in Europe around this time; this <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>supported</b> by archaeological investigation which has dated the construction of castle sites through the examination of ceramics. The increase in Italy began in the 950s, with numbers of castles increasing by a factor of three to five every 50years, whereas in other parts of Europe such as France and Spain the growth was slower. In 950 Provence was home to 12castles, by 1000 this figure had risen to 30, and by 1030 it was over 100. Although the increase was slower in Spain, the 1020s saw a particular growth in the number of castles in the region, particularly in contested border areas between Christian and Muslim.|$|E
5|$|Msambweni {{grew from}} a small village into a bustling little town. Fishing is {{important}} to the local community of Msambweni and is the primary source of income. The area is mainly Muslim and inhabited by Digo peoples. The Kwake District Development Plan 2002–2008 attempted to improve fish landing sites and beach access for fisherman on the coast of Msambweni. Coconut palm is grown, as are cashew nuts, fruits and buxa coloring. Maize, cassava, cowpeas and rice are grown for domestic consumption. There are numerous stalls along the main road in the town selling fruit and vegetables. Silica sand is mined at Msambweni and transported to Nairobi to make bottle glass. Beekeeping and seaweed farming are also local occupation and its commercialization in the area <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>supported</b> by ACT! Kenya with financial assistance from the European Union.|$|E
5|$|Tarbosaurus bataar was {{originally}} {{described as a}} species of Tyrannosaurus, an arrangement that <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>supported</b> by some more recent studies. Others prefer to keep the genera separate, while still recognizing them as sister taxa. A 2003 cladistic analysis based on skull features instead identified Alioramus as the closest known relative of Tarbosaurus, as the two genera share skull characteristics {{that are related to}} stress distribution and that are not found in other tyrannosaurines. If proven, this relationship would argue against Tarbosaurus becoming a synonym for Tyrannosaurus and would suggest that separate tyrannosaurine lineages evolved in Asia and North America. The two known specimens of Alioramus, which show juvenile characteristics, are not likely juvenile individuals of Tarbosaurus because of their much higher tooth count (76 to 78 teeth) and their unique row of bony bumps along the top of their snouts.|$|E

5|$|The {{fourth-generation}} iPad (marketed as iPad with Retina display, colloquially {{referred to}} as the iPad 4) is a tablet computer produced and marketed by Apple Inc. Compared to its predecessor, the third-generation iPad, the fourth-generation iPad maintained the Retina Display but featured new and upgraded components such as the Apple A6X chip and the Lightning connector, which was introduced on September 12, 2012. It shipped with iOS 6.0, which provides a platform for audio-visual media, including electronic books, periodicals, films, music, computer games, presentations and web content. Like the iPad 2 and the third-generation iPad, it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>supported</b> by five major iOS releases, in this case iOS 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. iOS 11, which was released on 19 September 2017, does not have support for the fourth-generation iPad because of hardware limitations.|$|E
5|$|The iPad 2 {{supports}} iOS 8 {{which was}} released on September 17, 2014, making it the first iOS device to support 5 major versions of iOS (including iOS 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8). While the device is still supported, {{most of the new}} features of the software are not supported due to relatively aged hardware and therefore, is limited in terms of performance. Users have also reported numerous problems after receiving the update including the accessibility features and battery-related issues. Many users predicted that the iPad 2 was going to be dropped from updating to iOS 8 along with the iPhone 4, the same process that happened with the iPhone 3GS and the iPod Touch (fourth generation) and earlier models, considering that it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>supported</b> for more than 3 years.|$|E
5|$|The project <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>supported</b> by editorials in newspapers, {{including}} The New York Times, the Chicago Sun-Times, the Los Angeles Times, The Boston Globe, and the Minneapolis Star Tribune, {{arguing that}} the existing system discourages voter turnout and leaves emphasis on only a few states and a few issues, while a popular election would equalize voting power. Others have argued against it, including the Honolulu Star-Bulletin. An article by Pierre S. du Pont, IV, a former governor of Delaware, in the opinion section of The Wall Street Journal has called the project an urban power grab that would shift politics entirely to urban issues in high population states and allow lower caliber candidates to run. A collection of readings pro and con has been assembled by the League of Women Voters.|$|E
