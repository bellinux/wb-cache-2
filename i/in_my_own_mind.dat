Professional wrestlers Andrew [...] "Test" [...] Martin and Oleg [...] "Vladimir Kozlov" [...] Prudius also featured, plus Olja Hrustic, Meriah Nelson, and Lorielle New as the Werewolf Women. According to Zombie, [...] "Basically, I had two ideas. It was {{either going to}} be a Nazi movie or a women-in-prison film, and I went with the Nazis.

40|$|Why are psychologists {{not often}} called on for their {{expertise}} {{in connection with}} the larger problems of society? The nature of expertise is analyzed in the framework of a theory of concept formation and categorization. Expert-novice differences in ap-proaches to problems, and, more generally, the nature of ab-straction and judgment, are interpreted in terms of cognitive processes that operate by computations on an instance-based composite memory. Applied to "growing pains " ofpsycholog-ical science, the theory has implications for graduate training and the direction of research support. Even though we lack formal methods for assessing the progress and current status of psychological science, we may find fairly wide agreement on some trends and con-trasts. The picture that I see <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>mind's</b> eye is exhibited in Figure 1. Other subjective evaluations will undoubtedly differ from mine, and readers are invited to fill in their own in blue, but I will be very surprised if the differences prove vast. Progress in psychological science as a discipline clearly outstrips the public view of our field as a source of expertise for coping with large-scale problems of society. A council of economic advisors is a fixture in Washington, though its record for predicting economic behavior is hardly enviable, but there seems to have been no call for a council of psychological advisors. And in a recent report to the Congress on the state of U. S. scientific resources (Office of Science and Technol-ogy Policy, 1992), one finds no mention of behavioral or psychological sciences. ON LEVELS OF EXPERTISE The tendency not to think of our field in connection with high-level scientific expertise characterizes even re-search on expertise by psychologists (Chi, Glaser, &...|$|R

2500|$|While {{working on}} his General Theory, Keynes wrote to George Bernard Shaw [...] "I believe myself to be {{writing a book on}} {{economic}} theory which will largely revolutionize, not I suppose at once but {{in the course of the}} next ten years – the way the world thinks about economic problems ... I don't merely hope what I say, <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>mind</b> I'm quite sure". Keynes's ideas quickly became established as the new foundations for mainstream economics, and also as a leading inspiration for industrial nations economic policy makers from about 1941 to the midseventies, especially in the English speaking countries. The 1950s and 1960s period, when Keynes's influence was at its peak, to many appeared in retrospect to have been a golden age.|$|E
6000|$|I {{told the}} Superintendent {{it meant that}} Miss Rachel's temper was upset {{by the loss of}} her jewel. Being anxious for the honour of the family, it distressed me to see my young lady forget herself--even with a police-officer--and I made the best excuse I could, accordingly. <b>In</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> private <b>mind</b> I was more puzzled by Miss Rachel's {{extraordinary}} language and conduct than words can tell. Taking what she had said at her bed-room door as a guide to guess by, I could only conclude that she was mortally offended by our sending for the police, and that Mr. Franklin's astonishment on the terrace was caused by her having expressed herself to him (as the person chiefly instrumental in fetching the police) to that effect. If this guess was right, why--having lost her Diamond--should she object to the presence in the house of the very people whose business it was to recover it for her? And how, in Heaven's name, could SHE know that the Moonstone would never be found again? ...|$|R
60|$|We {{were both}} {{silent for a}} while. Fears began {{crowding}} <b>in</b> on <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>mind.</b> Not doubts of Miss Trelawny, or of any act of hers; but fears lest such acts should be misunderstood. There was evidently a mystery somewhere; and if no solution to it could be found, the doubt would be cast on someone. In such cases the guesses of the majority are bound to follow the line of least resistance; and {{if it could be}} proved that any personal gain to anyone could follow Mr. Trelawny's death, should such ensue, it might prove a difficult task for anyone to prove innocence in the face of suspicious facts. I found myself instinctively taking that deferential course which, until the plan of battle of the prosecution is unfolded, is so safe an attitude for the defence. It would never do for me, at this stage, to combat any theories which a detective might form. I could best help Miss Trelawny by listening and understanding. When the time should come for the dissipation and obliteration of the theories, I should be quite willing to use all my militant ardour, and all the weapons at my command.|$|R
60|$|I {{tossed out}} {{on to the}} floor the old Lyndsey finery which some homesick impulse had persuaded me to bring away <b>in</b> <b>my</b> trunk. Seated there with busy needle under the window, sewing in every gewgaw and scrap of tinsel and finery I could lay hands on, I {{prepared}} for the morrow. How happy I was. Bats in the dewy dusk-light cast faint, flitting shadows on the casements. A large dark moth hawked to and fro above my head. It seemed I could spend eternity in this gentle ardent busyness. To think that God had given me {{what might have been}} so dreadful a thing as solitude, but which <b>in</b> reality, while <b>my</b> thoughts and fingers were thus placidly occupied, could be so sweet. When at length I leaned out on the cold sill, my work done, wrists and shoulders aching with fatigue, Croomham clock struck two. The moon was set. But there, as if <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> happy <b>mind,</b> away to the East shone Orion. Why, Sirius, then, must be in hiding under that quiet shoulder of the downs. A dwindling meteor silvered across space; I breathed a wish, shivered, and drew in.|$|R

Beatty did not respond until after surgery on his arm in September 1900 when he wrote, [...] "I landed from China with my heart full of rage, and swore I did not care if I ever saw you again, or if I were killed or not.

Often of a night would I steal from between the sheets, and climbing upon the high oak chest that stood before my bedroom window, sit peering down fearfully upon the aged gray tombstones far below, wondering whether the shadows that crept among them might not be ghosts--soiled ghosts that had lost their natural whiteness by long exposure to the city's smoke, and had grown dingy, like the snow that sometimes lay there.|$|R

6000|$|But, say some, {{we cannot}} admit the laity into convocation, as it [...] {{would be in}} {{derogation}} {{of the rights of}} the clergy; or as others [...] say, it would separate the church from the state.

Once on my venturing to expostulate with him on the subject, he reminded me of Solomon: [...] "Many sons I have; it is not fit that I should smile on them." [...] He would suffer faults, damage from his servants, and know what he suffered, and not speak of it; but I think the reason was, he waited a good time for speaking of it, and in a wise way amending it. He intimated, openly in chapter to us all, that he would have no eavesdropping: [...] "Let none," [...] said he, [...] "come to me secretly accusing another, unless he will publicly stand to the same; if he come otherwise, I will openly proclaim the name of him. I wish, too, that every Monk of you have free access to me, to speak of your needs or grievances when you will." ...|$|R

I see that <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> profession (never <b>mind</b> what that profession is just at present, as the ladies might think the worse of me for it). But in all professions, any work that shows signs of labor, straining, yearning--as the German gentleman said--or effort of any kind, is work beyond the man's strength that does it, and therefore not well done. Perhaps it's beyond his natural strength; but {{it is more likely that}} he was badly taught. Many teachers set their pupils on to strain, and stretch, so that they get used up, body and mind, in a few months. Depend upon it, the same thing is true in other arts. I once taught a fiddler that used to get a hundred guineas for playing two or three tunes; and he told me that it was just the same thing with the fiddle--that when you laid a tight hold on your fiddle-stick, or even set your teeth hard together, you could do nothing but rasp like the fellows that play in bands for a few shillings a night." ...|$|R
