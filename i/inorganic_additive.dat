40|$|With {{the rise}} of the {{environmental}} concerns from combustion of fossil fuels, the demand for the alternative clean energy sources has increased. One of the alternatives is rechargeable batteries. Among many types of rechargeable batteries, lithium-ion batteries have been the most promising due to the high energy density and long lifespan. The current lithium-ion batteries, however, hold a drawback as they utilize organic electrolytes. The use of organic electrolytes not only raises safety and environmental concerns, but also results in a higher manufacturing cost than would be with aqueous electrolytes. Therefore, these issues can be solved by replacing the organic electrolytes with aqueous electrolytes. Among the many types of lithium-ion batteries with aqueous electrolytes, Rechargeable Hybrid Aqueous Battery (ReHAB) was selected in this project. ReHAB utilizes lithium manganese oxide (LiMn 2 O 4) as the cathode and zinc as the anode. LiMn 2 O 4 is a good candidate because tightly bounded lithium ions make LiMn 2 O 4 stable in air and water. Also, it shows a small volume variation between lithiated and non-lithiated states. Zinc metal was chosen because of its low redox potential, good reversibility, high over-potential for hydrogen evolution in acidic environment, large specific capacity, good corrosion resistance, and cost effectiveness. While ReHAB is free of the problems posed by organic electrolytes in traditional Li-ion batteries, the current ReHAB technology must be improved to perform competitively in market. More specifically regarding the zinc anode, there are issues of corrosion, dendrite formation, and hydrogen evolution. Therefore, the goal of this project was to synthesize novel zinc anodes via electroplating with <b>additives</b> (organic and <b>inorganic)</b> reported in literature to mitigate issues of corrosion, dendrite formation, and hydrogen evolution (side reactions). The selected organic additives were cetyl trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), sodium dodecyle sulfate (SDS), polyethylene glycol 8000 (PEG), and thiourea; and the <b>inorganic</b> <b>additives</b> were indium (II) sulfate, tin (IV) oxide, and boric acid. Each anode was characterized by the following measurements to rate its performance: float current, corrosion current, cyclability, x-ray diffraction, and scanning electron microscope. All the anodes created with the inorganic and almost all with the organic additives performed better than the commercial zinc anode. Among the organic additives tested, Zn-SDS performed the best, with the lowest float current and corrosion current measurements and the highest retention of 79 % {{at the end of its}} 1000 th cycle. Among the <b>inorganic</b> <b>additives</b> tested, each fared very similarity, with similar float current and corrosion rate, and retaining in average 78 % of the initial discharge capacity at the end of 1000 th cycle. Between the organic and <b>inorganic</b> <b>additives,</b> however, the XRD results suggested that in general the zinc deposition efficiencies may be lower for <b>inorganic</b> <b>additives</b> (and thus less favourable when scaling up for commercial production).

40|$|The massiv {{usage of}} fossile fuels leads to high carbon dioxid {{emissions}} which cause global warming. To stop climate change {{we have to}} reduce the usage of fossile fuels and substitude them by renewable energie sources. Hydrogen {{is one of the}} most promising alternatives. Today steam reforming of natural gas is the most common production process of hydrogen. But there are also several renewable processes to produce hydrogen. One of them is the fermentative hydrogen production out of lignocellulosic biomas. The main focus should be on the usage of residual or waste materials. A competition between the energetic usage and the food industry is to be avoided. In this thesis the utilizability of grass silage is tested. Earlier experiments showed that monofermentation of grass silage lead to not acceptable conversion rates. Due to this results and to have a connection to practice a mixture of corn and grass silage was used. Moreover the effects of <b>inorganic</b> <b>additive</b> and enzyme on the fermentative process, the decay rate and the quality of hydrolysis gas were tested. For the experiments a fermenter with a netto capacity of 20 liters was used. The fermentation conditions were a mesophilic temperature from about 39 °C and a pH range of 4, 5 to 5, 0. In anaerobic degradations organic acids are produced which lower the pH range. To stabilize the process natriumhydroxid is used. The retention time is 4 days. To gain the best results several inokula has been tested. Primary and tertiary sludge from a purification plant and digestate of biogas fermentation have been tested. There was just a small gas yield when primary sludge and digestate have been applied. Furthermore it was not possible to inhibit the methanogenesis. It was not possible to reach the goal of hydrolysis gas without methan. In the end tertiary sludge has been chosen to be the best inokula for conducting the following experiments, because there was a high gas yield with no methan in it. Three experiments were done: ► Experiment 1 : Mixture of corn and grass silage (50 : 50) ► Experiment 2 : Mixture of corn and grass silage (50 : 50) plus <b>inorganic</b> <b>additive</b> ► Expermient 3 : Mixture of corn and grass silage (50 : 50) plus enzyme In Experiment 1 you gain a spezific hydrolysisgas yield of 78 l i. N/kgoTS and a hydrogen yield of 31 l i. N/kgoTS. You needed a lower amount of natriumhydroxid to stabilize the pH range because of the buffering effect of the grass silage. There was no methan in the hydrolysis gas. The addition of <b>inorganic</b> <b>additive</b> in experiment 2 lead to an lower degradation rate of the organic substrate. In comparission to experiment 1 a lower hydrolysis gas and hydrogen yield was reached. It was 61, 5 l i. N/kgoTs and 19, 2 l i. N/kgoTS. The inorganic additve pushed the methanogenesis. It was impossible to produce hydrolysis gas without methan. After a few days only methan got produced. The adding of this <b>inorganic</b> <b>additive</b> makes no sense for the hydrogenproduction. The best results had been reached with the addition of enzymes. The degradiation rate of the organic substrate was higher and the analyse of the gas quality showed an higher amount of hydrogen. In experiment 1 you got 37, 2 Vol. -% and in experiment 3 a hydrogen amount of 41 Vol. -% was reached. There was a specific hydrolysis gas yield of 89, 6 l i. N/kgoTS and a hydrogen yield of 36, 9 l i. N/kgoTS. The experiments demonstrate that the fermentative production of Hydrogen by lignocellulostic bio mass like corn and grass silage is possible. The next part was an economic efficiency calculation. The target was to calculate the production costs for the fermentative production of hydrogen and to compare them to the price of steam refoming. Bachelorarbeit von Danae Schmick – VII – The reactor for hydrolysation was considered as a pre-stage of a biogas reactor. The desulfurization and gas purification was realized by a pressure swing adoption plant. Two cases have been measured. In the first one only corn silage was used as substrate. In the second case a mixture of corn and grass silage were utilized. With corn sillage as substrate production costs of about 16 €/kg were generated. Because of lower substrat cost you reach a lower production cost with the usage of the mixture of grass and corn silage. It was ca. 13 €/kg. The calculation of the production cost of hydrogen come to the conclusion that the price for fermentative produced Hydrogen is 10 times higher than the process costs of hydrogen which was produced by steam reforming. The fermentative prosuction costs can be lowered by the selling of byproducts like for example carbon dioxid, but this wasn’t part of this thesis. To put it in a nutshell: There is still a high demand of research work and big technical progress in the sector of gas purification necessary to produce hydrogen by fermentation in an economic way...|$|E

Equilibrium CO 2 loading of biogas slurry was adopted to assess the CO 2 absorption performance and germination index (GI) of Chinese cabbage seeds in CO 2 -rich biogas slurry was selected to evaluate its phytotoxicity directly related to the application of biogas slurry. Raw biogas slurry can be used to absorb CO 2 to reach the maximum CO 2 loading with 0. 13 molCO 2 /L. However, the highest equilibrium CO 2 loading and lowest phytotoxicity of CO 2 -rich biogas slurry can not be obtained simultaneously at the same temperature, which means that a compromise on absorption temperature should be made. In addition, effect of additives like potassium glycinate (PG), monoethanolamine (MEA), potassium hydroxide (KOH) and aqueous ammonia (AA) on improvement of CO 2 absorption and phytotoxicity of CO 2 -rich biogas slurry were also experimented.

It helps {{to monitor the}} performance and rate of humification in the composting matrix. It has a dynamic part in succession and evaluation of microbiological communities in the entire biological process. It promotes the degradation of complex substrate into simpler compounds (Waqas et al. 2017). The temperature of the decaying waste increased quickly as composting preceded; however, temperature decreased slowly after the thermophilic stage and became stable (Iqbal et al. 2014). In this current study, the temperature was recorded daily over the entire composting process but was reported at 5 -day intervals. In the enriched compost, the temperature was raised rapidly in first 20 days which subsequently exhibited the decline in their temperature. It means the humification of composting matrix was higher than the unenriched compost. Temperature peak for unenriched compost revealed that the humification rate is much slow than the enriched compost due to the addition of <b>inorganic</b> <b>additive</b> which promoted the decomposition or humification of enriched compost (Fig.  1 b). Moreover, the temperature of enriched compost and ambient was not significantly different {{at the end of}} composting process.

When mineralization of composting matrix attained a peak, then the temperature of decomposed material shifted to ambient temperature, the material became soft, finer, and dark brown in color, no malodors were detected and C/N became stable.

PLA composites were prepared with a film stacking method and analysed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thermogravimetry (TGA), thermomechanometry and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) to investigate the physical and mechanical properties of the hybrid composites. PLA composites reinforced with hemp fibres in combination with nanosilica are thermally stable as the maximum rate of weight loss of the composites shifted to the highest temperature observed in TGA results. Dynamic mechanical properties of PLA composites showed that the reinforcement of hemp fibre and nanosilica strongly affected the mechanical properties of the composites. The highest storage modulus improvements were reached by addition of hemp fibre and nanosilica without plasticiser. An increase in storage modulus monitored in the temperature region from 70 to 100 °C reflected an increase in structural stiffness due to recrystallisation activity in the composites. The addition of TBC reduced the modulus though initiated the crystallisation on cooling, enhanced the nucleating ability of the fillers and chain mobility in PLA composites. The melting and crystallisation behaviour of PLA composites was explored with non isothermal DSC at various scanning rates. The characteristics of the crystallisation and melting behaviour of PLA composites were explained by the slow rate of crystallisation and recrystallisation, which is in agreement with DMA results. Non-isothermal crystallization kinetics shows that the crystallization rate of PLA composites was higher than of neat PLA and further increased with presence of TBC, indicating that the addition of plasticiser and nucleating agents enhanced the transportation ability of polymer chains. SEM revealed a good distribution of nanosilica for composites with and without TBC.

40|$|Composite {{materials}} with improved thermal conductivity and good mechanical strength properties should {{allow for the}} design and construction of more thermally efficient components (such as pipes and valves) for use in fluid-processing systems. These materials should have wide application {{in any number of}} systems, including ground support equipment (GSE), lunar systems, and flight hardware that need reduced heat transfer. Researchers from the Polymer Science and Technology Laboratory and the Cryogenics Laboratory at Kennedy Space Center were able to develop a new series of composite materials that can meet NASA's needs for lightweight materials/composites for use in fluid systems and also expand the plastic-additive markets. With respect to thermal conductivity and physical properties, these materials are excellent alternatives to prior composite materials and can be used in the aerospace, automotive, military, electronics, food-packaging, and textile markets. One specific application of the polymeric composition is for use in tanks, pipes, valves, structural supports, and components for hot or cold fluid-processing systems where heat flow through materials is a problem to be avoided. These materials can also substitute for metals in cryogenic and other low-temperature applications. These organic/inorganic polymeric composite materials were invented with significant reduction in heat transfer properties. Decreases of 20 to 50 percent in thermal conductivity versus that of the unmodified polymer matrix were measured. These novel composite materials also maintain mechanical properties of the unmodified polymer matrix. These composite materials consist of an <b>inorganic</b> <b>additive</b> combined with a thermoplastic polymer material. The intrinsic, low thermal conductivity of the additive is imparted into the thermoplastic, resulting in a significant reduction in heat transfer over that of the base polymer itself, yet maintaining most of the polymer's original properties. Normal polymer processing techniques can turn these composite materials into unique, custom parts for ground support, Shuttle, and Constellation needs. We fabricated test specimens of the composite and base materials for thermal and mechanical characterization and found that the strength of the composite material at nominal-percentage loading remained relatively unchanged from the base material...|$|E
40|$|New {{methods for}} the {{high-throughput}} characterisation of polymer electrolytes have been developed. Polymer electrolytes {{for use in}} lithium ion batteries have been prepared in a novel systematic manner that involves parallel preparation and subsequent high-throughput conductivity measurements of up to 64 individual compositions in a multi-electrode cell. The method of casting the polymer electrolytes directly onto the substrate also allows high-throughput characterisation by x-ray diffraction. The technique was applied specifically to a ternary system of PVdF-HFP, LiTFSI and PC. By preparing {{a vast array of}} samples across the composition range, {{it was found that the}} conductivity reached a maximum value when the weight fraction composition was 0. 45 / 0. 45 / 0. 1 of PVdF-HFP/LiTFSI/PC with completely free standing samples. The trend of increasing conductivity tended towards the maximum liquid conductivity of LiTFSI/PC. Due to limitations of this method with highly conductive polymer electrolytes, a second novel alternative polymer synthesis, preparation and measurement technique was developed for proton conducting polymers for fuel cell applications. In addition a second multi-electrode cell was designed and constructed specifically allowing AC Impedance measurements to be taken whilst allowing the polymer electrolytes to be subjected to temperature and relative humidity effects. The multi-electrode cell was calibrated using commercially available Nafion samples before being used with synthesised samples. PEEK was sulfonated to SPEEK using varying temperatures and reaction times to obtain many samples with differing DS values. The conductivity of the samples was measured in situ using an in-plane 4 electrode impedance measurement, over a range of environmental conditions. It was found that water loss caused significant conductivity decay under PEMFC conditions for Nafion but not for SPEEK samples. SPEEK with a DS of 75 % was found to have the maximum SPEEK equilibration conductivity of 0. 177 S cm- 1, a value comparable to that of commercial membranes. By blending this sample with a lower DS SPEEK, high conductivity values could be maintained at temperatures of 105 °C and 75 % relative humidity with maintained mechanical integrity. When an <b>inorganic</b> <b>additive</b> (Zr(HPO 4) 2) was introduced into the blended samples, the conductivity was enhanced further due to increased water retention within the phosphate structure.

40|$|The {{advent of}} the {{electron}} microscope has fostered major advances in {{a broad spectrum of}} disciplines. The required vacuum environment of standard electron microscopy, however, precludes imaging of systems containing high vapor pressure liquids. The recent development of liquid cells like the Penn nanoaquarium overcomes this limitation, enabling imaging of temporally evolving processes in liquids with nanoscale resolution at video frame rates. We used Liquid Cell Electron Microscopy to investigate the morphological evolution of the electrode-electrolyte interface during electroplating, the onset of diffusive instabilities in electrodeposits, beam-mediated nucleation, growth, and dissolution of metallic nanoparticles, the nucleation and growth of nanobubbles, and the fundamentals of the electron-water interactions (Radiation Chemistry). The control of interfacial morphology in electrochemical processes is essential for applications ranging from nanomanufacturing to battery technologies. Critical questions still remain in understanding the transition between various growth regimes, particularly the onset of diffusion-limited growth. We present quantitative observations at previously unexplored length and time scales that clarify the evolution of the metal-electrolyte interface during deposition. The interface evolution during initial stages of galvanostatic Cu deposition on Pt from an acidic electrolyte is consistent with kinetic roughening theory, while at later times the behavior is consistent with diffusion limited growth physics. To control morphology, we demonstrate rapid pulse plating without entering the diffusion-limited regime, and study the effects of the <b>inorganic</b> <b>additive</b> Pb on the growth habit. The irradiating electrons used for imaging, however, affect the chemistry of the suspending medium. The electron beam 2 ̆ 7 s interaction with the water solvent produces molecular and radical products such as hydrogen, oxygen, and hydrated (solvated) electrons. A detailed understanding of the interactions between the electrons and the irradiated medium is necessary to correctly interpret experiments, minimize artifacts, and take advantage of the irradiation as a tool. We predict the composition of water subjected to electron irradiation under conditions relevant to liquid cell electron microscopy. We interpret experimental data, such as beam-induced colloid aggregation and observations of crystallization and etching of metallic particles as functions of dose rate. Our predictive model is useful for designing experiments that minimize unwanted solution chemistry effects, extend liquid cell microscopy to new applications, take advantage of beam effects for nanomanufacturing such as the patterning of nanostructures, and properly interpreting experimental observations. ...|$|E
40|$|All <b>inorganic</b> <b>additives</b> {{in their}} optimal {{concentrations}} {{proved to be}} effective at reducing the initial viscosity to 1 %. In the case of NaOH two different trends were observed: firstly this additive behaved as a deflocculant agent where, at its optimal range of concentrations, the viscosity of kaolin dispersion reduced to its minimal value, secondly when used at concentrations above its optimal range, sodium hydroxide behaved like a flocculant agent increasing strongly the viscosity of kaolin dispersions. The possible cause was attributed to an excess of Na+ and OH- species in bulk media that promoted the reversible effect. Similar effect was also reported for NaCMC at high and medium molar weight, were the viscosity firstly decreased to a certain concentration of additive and then above that concentration started to increase. Thus low molar weight NaCMC was the most effective among the organic additives since it decreased the viscosity to 10 % of initial viscosity. Qualitative evaluation showed that organic additives promoted more stable dispersions, in contrast to poor stability offered by the <b>inorganic</b> <b>additives,</b> with exception of NaOH that provided dispersions with good stability inside of its optimal range...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{modification}} of clay properties with <b>inorganic</b> <b>additives</b> to deflocculate and flocculate inorganic soil {{for the development of}} a material that would be as easy to use as the current concrete products, but with a much lower environmental impact. Considering that the rheological behaviour of clays is controlled by their surface charge, we first introduce potential determining ions to deflocculate the clay particles and to reduce the yield stress of the earth material. Their efficiency is characterized using zeta potential measurements and rheological tests. We then achieve the flocculation of clay particles by using natural minerals that slowly dissolve in the interstitial liquid and ultimately precipitate calcium silicate hydrate (C–S–H). The precipitation products are identified by X-ray diffraction and the consequences of this delayed precipitation are followed by oscillatory rheometric measurements. Finally, it is suggested that in this process, C–S–H precipitation is not used as a binding vector but as an anti-plasticizer that removes the <b>inorganic</b> dispersant <b>additives...</b>|$|R
