25|$|The pink {{sandstone}} {{sculptures of}} Mathura evolved during the Gupta period (4th to 6th century) {{to reach a}} very high fineness of execution and delicacy in the modeling. Newer sculptures in Afghanistan, in stucco, schist or clay, display very strong blending of Indian post-Gupta mannerism and Classical influence, Hellenistic or possibly even Greco-Roman. Meanwhile, elsewhere in India, less anatomically accurate styles of human representation evolved, leading to the classical art {{that the world is}} now familiar with, and contributing to Buddhist and Hindu sculpture throughout Asia. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> like more information on this topic please let us recommend.|$|E

500|$|Kenyon's {{appointment}} was initially greeted with caution by his fellow barristers, who worried that, {{as he had}} practised {{in a court of}} equity rather than a court of common law, he might be unfamiliar with the area covered by his new posting in the Court of King's Bench. Despite this, he was noted as an excellent judge, although one who suffered from an [...] "excess of zeal" [...] in moral issues. One of his flaws was his defective education; he was too proud to avoid exhibiting his ignorance. He was particularly noted for using Latin incorrectly, leading George III to say [...] "My Lord... it would be well <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> stick to your good law and leave off your bad Latin". As a judge, Kenyon over-ruled the principles that a court of law could not consider trusts or a pecuniary legacy; it was said that he [...] "restored the simplicity and rigor of the common law". After nearly one and a half decades as a judge, Kenyon died on 4 April 1802 in Bath.|$|E
500|$|According to {{the book}} Film Genre 2000: New Critical Essays, [...] "God Help the Outcasts" [...] has an [...] "unusually somber tone" [...] for an {{animated}} Disney film. Performed [...] "as a prayer for deliverance from [...] pain and suffering," [...] lyrically, [...] "God Help the Outcasts," [...] a song about faith, explores themes such as discrimination. Additionally, “God Help the Outcasts” [...] "touches on a basic idea behind most faiths." [...] Asking [...] "was Jesus [...] not an outcast, too, as [...] sees firsthand how her people, are persecuted for their differences," [...] the first verse of the song reads, [...] "I don't know if You can hear me/Or if You're even there/I don't know <b>if</b> <b>You</b> <b>would</b> listen/To a gypsy's prayer." [...] Teen Ink observed, [...] "This part is about how it seems like God doesn't listen to you or help you, {{no matter how much}} you pray or talk to him." [...] Finally, asking people to be kind and unselfish, Esmeralda sings, [...] "Please help my people, the poor and downtrodden/I thought we all were the children of God.” In The Gospel According to Disney, author Mark I. Pinsky drew similarities between [...] "God Help the Outcasts" [...] and the Christian hymn [...] "His Eye Is on the Sparrow," [...] as both songs explore [...] "the love of God that knows no bounds."

500|$|Although {{science fiction}} heroes have, Porter argues, [...] "grown greyer over time", Jack {{represents}} as of Children of Earth a culmination of this trend, {{resulting in a}} full [...] "devolution/deconstruction of the traditional hero". In Children of Earth, Jack has to sacrifice his own grandson to save the world. Barrowman was concerned that the storyline could have made the character unpopular. He believes however that Jack was given the tough decision on how to save humanity; the actor says [...] "when I read all of the stuff he had to do, I {{had to look at}} it {{from the point of view}} of 'I'm Jack Harkness and I'm right'." [...] For Lynnette Porter, Jack's actions in the serial make him [...] "a benchmark for [...] grey heroes"; some audiences may even view him, in light of his actions, as [...] "villainous or downright monstrous." [...] Although Jack ultimately saves the majority of the world's children and finds a way to foil the monstrous 456, the situation in which he is placed forces him to make a morally difficult (and to some viewers, reprehensible) decision. Such, Porter argues, is the mark of a grey hero. Davies stated in an interview with SFX that he [...] "loved" [...] the uproarious reaction to Jack's actions, defending the character in saying [...] "He saved every single child in the world! <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> fail to do that then you’re the monster, frankly. It’s this extraordinary treatment that only science fiction heroes get." [...] When Jack is departing Earth, the music playing is titled [...] "Redemption", signifying that his departure is also perhaps his redeeming act in the serial.|$|E

500|$|Either/Or portrays two life views. Each life view {{is written}} and {{represented}} by a fictional pseudonymous author, with the prose of the work reflecting and depending on the life view being discussed. For example, the aesthetic life view is written in short essay form, with poetic imagery and allusions, discussing aesthetic topics such as music, seduction, drama, and beauty. The ethical life view is written as two long letters, with a more argumentative and restrained prose, discussing moral responsibility, critical reflection, and marriage. The views of the book are not neatly summarized, but are expressed as lived experiences embodied by the pseudonymous authors. The book's central concern is the primal question asked by Aristotle, [...] "How should we live?" [...] His book was certainly informed by Epictetus; [...] "Consider first, man, what the matter is, and what your own nature is able to bear. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> be a wrestler, consider your shoulders, your back, your thighs; for different persons are made for different things. Do {{you think that you}} can act as you do and be a philosopher, that you can eat, drink, be angry, be discontented, as you are now? You must watch, you must labor, you must get the better of certain appetites, must quit your acquaintances, be despised by your servant, be laughed at by those you meet; come off worse than others in everything—in offices, in honors, before tribunals. When you have fully considered all these things, approach, if you please—that is, if, by parting with them, you have a mind to purchase serenity, freedom, and tranquillity. If not, do not come hither; do not, like children, be now a philosopher, then a publican, then an orator, and then one of Caesar’s officers. These things are not consistent. You must be one man, either good or bad. You must cultivate either your own reason or else externals; apply yourself either to things within or without you—that is, be either a philosopher or one of the mob."

500|$|As {{the musical}} prelude climaxes, Woglinde and Wellgunde are seen {{at play in}} the depths of the Rhine. Flosshilde joins them after a gentle {{reminder}} of their responsibilities as guardians of the gold. They are observed by the Nibelung dwarf Alberich who calls out to them: [...] "I'd like to draw near <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> be kind to me". The wary Flosshilde cries: [...] "Guard the gold! Father warned us of such a foe". When Alberich begins his rough wooing the maidens relax: [...] "Now I laugh at my fears, our enemy is in love", says Flosshilde, and a cruel teasing game ensues. First, Woglinde pretends to respond to the dwarf's advances but swims away as he tries to embrace her. Then Wellgunde takes over, and Alberich's hopes rise until her sharp retort: [...] "Ugh, you hairy hunchbacked clown!" [...] Flosshilde pretends to chastise her sisters for their cruelty and feigns her own courtship, by which Alberich is quite taken in until she suddenly tears away to join the others in a mocking song. Tormented with lust, Alberich furiously chases the maidens over the rocks, slipping and sliding as they elude him, before he sinks down in impotent rage. At this point the mood changes: as a sudden brightness penetrates the depths, a magical golden light reveals, for the first time, the Rhinegold on its rock. The maidens sing their ecstatic greeting to the gold, which rouses Alberich's curiosity. In response to his question Woglinde and Wellgunde reveal the gold's secret: measureless power would belong to the one who could forge a ring from it. Flosshilde scolds them for giving this secret away, but her concerns are dismissed—only someone who has forsworn love can obtain the gold, and Alberich is clearly so besotted as to present no danger. But their confidence is misplaced; in his humiliation Alberich decides that world mastery is more desirable than love. As the maidens continue to jeer his antics he scrambles up the rock and, uttering a curse on love, seizes the gold and disappears, leaving the Rhinemaidens to dive after him [...] bewailing their loss.|$|E

2500|$|The Ancient Greeks and Romans {{believed}} the blood, excrement, rectum, genitalia, eyes, tongue, hair, skin, and fat, {{as well as}} the ash of different parts of the striped hyena's body, were effective means to ward off evil and to ensure love and fertility. The Greeks and Romans believed that the genitalia of a hyena [...] "would hold a couple peaceably together" [...] and that a hyena anus worn as an amulet on the upper arm would make its male possessor irresistible to women. [...] In West and South Asia, hyena body parts apparently {{play an important role in}} love magic and in the making of amulets. In Iranian folklore, it is mentioned that a stone found in the hyenas body can serve as a charm of protection for whoever wears it on his upper arm. In the Pakistani province of Sindh, the local Muslims place the tooth of a striped hyena over churns in order not to lose the milk's baraka. In Iran, a dried striped hyena pelt is considered a potent charm which forces all to succumb to the possessors attraction. In Afghanistan and Pakistan striped hyena hair is used either in love magic or as a charm in sickness. Hyena blood has been held in high regard in northern India as potent medicine, and the eating of the tongue helps fight tumors. In the Khyber area, burned striped hyena fat is applied to a man's genitals or sometimes taken orally to ensure virility, while in India the fat serves as a cure for rheumatism. In Afghanistan, some mullahs wear the vulva (kus) of a female striped hyena wrapped in silk under their armpits for a week. If a man peers through the vulva at the woman of his desire, he will invariably get hold of her. This has led to the proverbial expression in Dari of kus-e kaftar bay, as well as in Pashto of kus-e kaftar which literally mean [...] "it happens as smoothly as <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> look through the vulva of a female striped hyena". In the North-West Frontier Province and Baluchistan, the Pakhtun keep the vulva in vermilion powder, itself having aphrodesic connotations. The rectum of a freshly killed striped hyena is likewise used by homosexuals and bisexuals to attract young men. This has led to the expression [...] "to possess the anus of a [...] hyena" [...] which denotes somebody who is attractive and has many lovers. A striped hyena's penis kept in a small box filled with vermilion powder can be used for the same reasons.|$|E
