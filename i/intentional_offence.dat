40|$|Introduction: Today, mortalities and {{injuries}} due to traffic accidents {{have been confirmed}} as a global phenomenon. Meanwhile, mistakes and high risk behaviors by drivers, {{is the most important}} intervening factor in traffic accidents. This study is to analyze the causes of traffic accidents according to drivers' aberrant behaviors. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 540 taxi drivers using Manchester Driving Behaviour Questinnaire in 0 - 5 Likert scale. After being gathered, the data were analyzed by SPSS 11. 5 using Pearson Correlation and Logistic Regression. Findings: The mean score of aberrant driving behaviors was obtained 2. 06 (± 0. 47) and lapse obtained the highest score and driving mistakes did the lowest. As age advanced, the rate of aberrant behaviours declined (P = 0. 006). Commitment of mistakes and offences was more prevalent in ages under 30 years compared to other age ranges and lapse in the individuals over 50 years was more prevalent compared to other items. The results of logistic regression indicated that all variables of DBQ are important in predicting Iranian drivers' aberrant behaviors (P < 0. 001), but <b>intentional</b> <b>offences</b> had the highest correlation. There was an inverse correlation between driving history and <b>intentional</b> <b>offences</b> and mistakes (P < 0. 001). Conclusion: According to the results, it could be said that <b>intentional</b> <b>offences</b> and lapse in driving behaviors are more predictive of self-reported accidents compared to other variables. The drivers in low ages are more willing to practice aberrant behaviors due to lack of adequate skill and experience and having intrinsic excitements. By contrast, as age advances, intentional offenses declines and the rate of lapses ascends. It seems that through provision of regular, periodic training for the drivers by occupation and creating awareness, aberrant behaviors and, by extension, traffic accidents could be effectively decreased...|$|R

50|$|A {{criminal}} database {{exists in}} Hungary which is allowed for under the 85th Act of 1999 on the criminal database {{and the official}} certificate of criminal record. There are 5 different databases, the database of offenders, the database of those under coercive measures, database of those under criminal procedures, the database of fingerprint, palm prints and photographs and the database of DNA profiles. Therefore, there is not only information recorded {{for those who have}} had a criminal sanction place against them, covered by the database of offenders, but also for those that are in pre-trial detention (database for those under coercive measures) and those who are suspected and accused of a crime (database for those under criminal procedures).The Central Office for Administrative and Electronic Public Services (COAEPS) of the Ministry of the Interior operates, managers and maintains the databases. Investigative authorities, public prosecutors offices and criminal courts all contribute to the databases.The amount of time a person's information is held on these databases varies. For people imprisoned for an <b>intentional</b> <b>offence,</b> data will be removed 15 years after their release. If the offence was committed recklessly, then the data will be removed 5 years after release The data is not publicly accessible, but a person can obtain the data held about themselves upon request.|$|E
40|$|In {{relation}} to the international personal traffic and tourism there are situations encountered in penal proceedings when defendants are pleading ignorance of the Polish penal law, on top of it, {{in some cases the}} ignorance is also fostered by different socio-cultural conditions, system of moral norms and ethical values. According to the ancient Roman principle everyone, including also aliens, must know the penal law, thus ignorance of the law cannot be treated as a circumstance precluding a penal responsibility. Yet, the aliens find themselves in much worse situations then the (locals, a question thus anises whether they could be offered more „priviledged" treatment {{in the context of the}} „ignorantia iuris nocet" principle. Art. 24 par. 2 of the Penal Code proclaims that ignorance of illegality of act cannot preclude penal responsibility under condition that a perpetrator was able to avoid his error. If he was able to avoid his ignorance as to illegality, and committed an <b>intentional</b> <b>offence,</b> then the court may apply the extraordinary mitigation of they of the penalty (par. 3). If an allien-defendant explains committing his unlawful act by a custom adopted in his home society the Polish courts cannot take it as a circumstance excluding penal responsibility in principle, nor as mitigating it- contrary to the British jurisdictions, according to which a court may renounce of inflicting a punishment. The effect of ignorance of the law exhibited by aliens ought to be discussed against the background of the division of offences into: mala in są and mala prohibita. The author advocates that the ignorantia iuris is legally irrelevant in {{relation to}} the first group offences, but it has to be considered in case of certain offences of the second group.

40|$|The {{relation}} between traffic offences and road crashes; Preliminary study {{making use of}} Central Fine Collection Agency (CJIB) data. In The Netherlands, no {{research has been done}} as yet into the {{relation between}} the number of registered traffic offences and the involvement in registered road crashes. Such research could provide answers to the questions whether committing more offences {{goes hand in hand with}} disproportionately more and more serious crashes, and to which degree the types of offences or the road user characteristics play a role. These questions are important for the policy field that structures and designs road safety and enforcement policy in The Netherlands: the Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment (IenM) and the Ministry of Security and Justice, the police and road safety organizations. This subject is also connected to discussions as regards the importance for road safety of <b>intentional</b> <b>offences</b> versus unintentional errors on the one hand, and the relation between the number and severity of offences and road safety on the other. The present study is a first step in finding out whether Dutch data is sufficiently reliable for further investigation of the relation between offences and crashes. Within the limitations of the present data and method, the study gives preliminary answers to the following three questions: 1. From a technical viewpoint, is it possible to study the relation between offences and crashes by linking the data files of offences and crashes? 2. Is a higher number of crashes related to a disproportionally higher crash involvement? 3. In addition to the previous question: how large will a yet to be defined group of multiple offenders be, with a higher than average endangerment? To answer these questions SWOV analysed two data files that were made available by the Central Fine Collection Agency (CJIB) : 1. a file containing the offences committed with vehicles that had been involved in crashes in the year 2009 (combination of a file made available by the Centre for Transport and Navigation and a CJIB file); 2. a CJIB data file containing an arbitrary selection of vehicles that had committed at least one offence in 2009. In both the above files the number of offences per vehicle was considered for the period 2005 - 2009. By comparing the distribution of the vehicles across the number of violations in each of the files, the relation between crash involvement and the number of violations was studied...|$|R
40|$|Tattling –reporting {{to second}} parties norm {{violations}} committed by third parties – is frequent but little-studied among peers. We examined how 5 and 9 -year-old children evaluate stories involving transgressors and observers,to understand whether both groups consider reporting peers’ transgressions to adults a bad act, regardless of type or perceived seriousness of transgressions; likeability for transgressors and observers. We hypothesized that: both groups would positively evaluate reporting more serious transgressions; only younger children would positively evaluate reporting less serious transgressions; as children grewolder, liking for tattlers would decrease. Italian children (N= 76) {{were presented with}} 4 two-part-stories: in the first part, a child committed {{a more or less}} serious transgression, unaware of being observed by a peer; in the second part, the observer reported or didn’t report to the teacher. After reading each part, the interviewer asked participants to indicate: whether the action of the protagonist was good or bad on a 5 -point scale from “very good” to “very bad”; whether participants liked or disliked the protagonist on a 5 -point “feeling face scale”; what participants would have done in place of the observer. A t test has been performed on data from the 5 -point scales with age and genderas independent factors. Older children have significantly judged accidental damage as less serious than an <b>intentional</b> <b>offence</b> (t= 4. 586; p=. 000), the transgressor as more likeable (t= 3. 850; p=. 000), tattling on that as worse (t= 3. 850; p=. 000) and the tattler as more unlikeable (t=- 4. 542; p=. 000). Males have also significantly judged tattling as worse (t= 2. 525; p=. 005). Younger children and females declared that they would have tattled more frequently. We conclude that, as their age increases, children in Italy start to consider tattling of minor transgressions less appropriate and tattlers less likeable. This seems to occur more prominently in males than in females. We will be including groups of English and Colombian participants to investigate cross-cultural similarities and differences...|$|E
40|$|Serious {{forms of}} crime have {{abandoned}} the merely national dimension and become transnational: think of terrorism, organized crime, computer crime, trafficking in human beings, {{just to name a}} few. In order to adequately fight this kind of phenomena, criminal law should do the same and not be so tied to the merely national dimension. European citizens ask for security and their request should be interpreted as expressing the need for regulatory interventions in the criminal field. Of course they deserve certainty as to the fact that appropriate sanctioning measures will be taken by all the Member States of the European Union (EU) in order to effectively deal with crime. Anyway, one should remember that criminal law must not be dissociated from the protection of fundamental rights because that would result in the denial of basic values inherent in democratic societies, first of all the rule of law. Then, the need for an axiological horizon and principles which found and limit the EU criminal system arises. So, my research question is: what are the axiological horizon and the principles which found and limit the EU criminal system? This work focuses on the precedents of the European Court of Justice (ECJ), so on a judge-made law whose development has basically been made possible thanks to the preliminary ruling procedure. No one denies that case law should remain bound to the specific case, inasmuch the extension of the ratio decidendi to other cases always is the result of selective operations. However, the presentation of the topics in this PhD thesis shows not only that the judgments of the ECJ in the criminal field are numerous, but also that they are characterized by the progressive emergence of a criminal law consciousness, a criminal law sensibility, and the will to create a system which is intrinsically consistent. The case law of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) is also taken into account in light of the phenomenon called cross-fertilization. The works of Italian and European legal scholars are considered too. So, after an Introduction on the relationship between globalization, crime, and competences of the EU in criminal matters, the thesis deals with the concept of criminal law (First Chapter), the principles of legality of criminal offences and penalties (Second Chapter), offensiveness (Third Chapter), guilt (Fourth Chapter), and proportionality (Fifth Chapter) in the case law of the ECJ. In the Conclusion, an assessment of the results is provided. As problematic as it seems, the search for an axiological horizon and principles of EU criminal law has proven fruitful. In the first chapter, I found out {{that it is possible to}} identify two notions of criminal law which have been developed by the ECJ in the last twenty-five years. According to the former, criminal law is that branch of law which aims at protecting the values that are deemed fundamental by national communities. According to the latter, the criminal nature of a sanction should be asserted in light of the so-called Engel criteria as developed by the EctHR (legal classification of the offence under national law, very nature of the offence, and degree of severity of the sanction). The latter approach is now prevailing. At first sight, they do not look so different, but I think the latter should be preferred because of the different axiological horizon. The former approach relies on the values that are deemed fundamental by national communities, while the latter one implicitly relies on the European Convention on Human Rights. So, it is characterized by an inclusive dimension which may lack in the former one, since fundamental national values may not be consistent with human rights (think of the case of Hungary). The second chapter is devoted to the principle of legality of criminal offences and penalties and takes into account five major issues: the interpretative incidence of EU directives in criminal matters (the prohibition of determining or aggravating the liability in criminal law and the duty of conforming interpretation); the interpretative incidence of EU regulations and frameworks decisions (the duty of conforming interpretation); the integrating incidence of EU law (how EU law shapes the meaning of national legislation); the disapplying incidence (in case national provisions are not consistent with EU law, with in bonam partem effects); the lex mitior principle. The analysis led to the conclusion that the principle of legality of criminal offences and penalties is not dead, as someone said, but has adapted to national and international realities which have changed. The third chapter deals with the principle of offensiveness and is divided into two parts. In the first part, an analysis is provided with reference to those judgments (Amsterdam Bulb, Commission v Hellenic Republic) in which the ECJ ruled that some legal interests which belong to the EU (above all, the financial ones) should be protected by the Member States under conditions, both procedural and substantive, which are analogous to those applicable to infringements of national law of a similar nature and importance and which, in any event, make the penalty effective, proportionate and dissuasive, in light of the principle of sincere cooperation. In the second part, recent judgments concerning criminal law and immigration law (El Dridi, Achughbabian, Sagor) are considered in order to show how the ECJ has questioned national lawmakers' choices which were inconsistent with the principle of sincere cooperation. The fourth chapter is dedicated to the principle of guilt and, more specifically, to six topics: The distinction between intentionally-committed and unintentionally-committed offences, the concept of <b>intentional</b> <b>offence,</b> the concept of negligence, strict criminal liability, Ignorantia legis non excusat, and the concept of force majeure. In the fifth chapter, the case law concerning the principle of proportionality is taken into consideration by highlighting how the ECJ has solved the cases in which a clash between national regulations criminal in nature and one of the four fundamental freedoms had occurred. It is quite interesting to notice that the solution given by the Court has always aimed at finding a balance point between the values at stake by identifying some conditions under which the four fundamental freedoms may be sacrificed. In conclusion, the gradual recognition of competences in criminal matters to the European Union is the result of the emergence of the political identity of the Union, since the creation of criminal law – both at the international and national level – requires the prior identification of a system of shared fundamental values, which are expressive of an identity. Some legal scholars, in analyzing the events and reasons for the failure of the draft European Constitution, spoke of the absence of a European people characterized by common ethnicity, culture, society and language. Such reasoning has been discussed among criminal law scholars for a long time with reference to European criminal law, since the unification of criminal law presupposes the cultural unification of Europe. The point is that, without assuming a world legal commonality, one can hypothise a European legal commonality. In my opinion, it is very convincing the reasoning of those who state that the foundation of human rights must be sought not – or not only – in the human nature, but also – and most of all – in the history and culture of peoples, considering, at least at the European level, the set of ideas and principles of the tradition of the old continent, through the reference to the Christian roots of Europe and the Enlightenment. So, those values already exist. Undoubtedly, the culture of the Europeans is the culture of human rights, and the lingua franca of Europe is the language of rights as declined in the Nice Charter and the European Convention of Human Rights. As demonstrated in the thesis, the jurisprudential experience of the Court of Justice has been mature enough to get to deal with the issues of protection of fundamental rights and, most of all, the protection of those rights through criminal law. The Court did so by progressively becoming aware of the nature of that branch of law – as explained in the first chapter – which has been considered not as a simple tool of repression, but as a means through which affirm and reaffirm freedoms. I believe that can reasonably be confirmed by turning the attention to the essence of the principles of legality, offensiveness, guilt, proportionality. As a matter of fact, they represent the limits to the use of criminal methods of repression, the observance of which leads to the outcome of legitimization and re-legitimization of criminal law, both at the national and international level; they indicate the existence of criminal awareness and sensitivity of the Court; they mark the road that will lead to the final result of the emergence of a criminal law of the European Union, made up of both a general part and a special part, both inspired, supported and controlled by those principles...|$|E
