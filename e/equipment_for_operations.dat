500|$|On 7 November, the 24th US Infantry Division and 27th British Commonwealth Brigade {{followed}} up the Chinese withdrawal {{with a limited}} probing advance. That morning Australian clearing patrols killed seven Chinese soldiers, before 3 RAR prepared to advance with {{the remainder of the}} brigade. C Company occupied Hill 74 [...] to the north-east without opposition, only to discover a North Korean company on the reverse slope. The Australians engaged the North Koreans with machine-gun fire, inflicting heavy losses on the defenders and capturing five before forcing them to withdraw towards Tang-dong harried by artillery and airstrikes. The remainder of the battalion deployed on the right, while the Argylls occupied two hills further north. The brigade's advance had forestalled a planned North Korean attack on the night of 7/8 November, while large numbers of Chinese dead from the previous fighting were also discovered. On 9 November the advance wheeled to the north-west around Pakchon, with 3 RAR moving forward another [...] to the east, encountering little resistance and taking a number of prisoners in the process. From 11 November the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade advanced slowly north. On 16 November 3 RAR occupied Hill 117, on a bend in the Taeryong River [...] north of Pakchon. Over the following weeks they remained in the Pakchon area, conducting extensive patrolling up to company-size, and clashing with small groups of Chinese and North Koreans. As winter approached the weather became bitterly cold amid snow and strong winds. Unprepared for the extreme conditions the Australians increasingly suffered health problems, particularly among the older members of the battalion. Lacking the training and <b>equipment</b> <b>for</b> <b>operations</b> in ice and snow, maintenance also proved burdensome before additional US cold weather clothing and equipment was issued.|$|E

The 436th deployed an Airlift Control Element (ALCE) at Tocumen International Airport, Panama on 19 December 1989. It also provided airlift of personnel and equipment, and logistical support for operations in Southwest Asia, August 1990-May 1991.|$|E

50|$|Over time, Richardson {{obtained}} 51 {{aircraft and}} an assortment of top bush pilots and military pilots, all of which provided various services, particularly cargo transport, to Northwestern Canada. Whether it was financing operations, hiring and selecting personnel or selecting the best <b>equipment</b> <b>for</b> <b>operations</b> in Canada's tricky climate, he took a very hands on approach to running the WCA. He was also in constant contact with people throughout the aviation industry at the time, to learn and adapt efficiently. Something that made him so successful in the grain trade earlier in his career.|$|E
5000|$|Nyerere and Kaunda pursued {{different}} {{avenues for}} the construction of a rail route. When Nyerere visited Beijing in February 1965, he was hesitant to raise the issue of the railway out of concern that China was also a poor country. President Liu Shaoqi offered to assist Tanzania and Zambia in building a railway between the two countries. [...] Chairman Mao Zedong told Nyerere, “You have difficulties as do we, but our difficulties are different. To help you build the railway, we are willing to forsake building railways for ourselves.” [...] Chinese leaders assured Nyerere that the full ownership of the railway would be handed to Tanzania and Zambia upon completion along with the technology and <b>equipment</b> <b>for</b> <b>operations.</b> [...] Nyerere did not immediately accept the Chinese offer but sought to use it to induce Western backing for the railway, but none was forthcoming. [...] He did, however, accept a team of Chinese surveyors, who produced a short report in October 1966.|$|E
50|$|The 437th {{replaced}} the 1608th Air Transport Wing, in 1966, as the Military Airlift Command host wing at Charleston Air Force Base, South Carolina. It has since flown joint training missions with Army forces, aeromedical evacuation missions, mercy and humanitarian missions as needed, and airlifted personnel, cargo, and mail worldwide, primarily to Europe, the Middle East and Africa, {{but also to}} South America. The 437th converted from the C-124 Globemaster to the C-141 Starlifter in 1965 {{and was the first}} Air Force unit to receive the C-5 Galaxy in 1970. The wing flew both aircraft until 1973 when its C-5s were transferred to Dover AFB, Delaware and Dovers C-141s were moved to Charleston. It has participated in numerous tactical operations and exercises, particularly those of NATO. Wing aircrews have been augmented by attached Reserve aircrews from the 315th Airlift Wing. From 1966 to the early 1970s, the wing also flew numerous missions to the Far East and Southeast Asia. It added Russia as a special mission destination in 1988 and conducted humanitarian relief operations in Russia in 1992. The wing deployed support personnel and provided airlift of personnel and <b>equipment</b> <b>for</b> <b>operations</b> in Grenada, 24 October-19 December 1983; Panama, 18-29 December 1989; and Southwest Asia, August 1990 - December 1991.

40|$|The study {{sought to}} {{investigate}} the economic factors affecting the productivity of small scale sugar-cane farmers in the Lowveld of Zimbabwe with particular reference to Chipiwa farmers in Mkwasine area in Chiredzi District. The main objective {{of the study was}} to bring to light the economic challenges that contribute towards the low productivity by small scale sugar cane farmers so that the relevant stakeholders can assist to rectify the situation. The research sampled 100 farmers. The descriptive survey method was used to identify and explain the economic challenges faced by sugar cane farmers. The research showed that while sugar cane industry is a critical sector to the economy, its productivity is going down. It was discovered that the low productivity is largely due to failure to plough out old cane, lack of <b>equipment</b> <b>for</b> <b>operations,</b> low prices paid for the harvested cane, high transport and haulage charges, limited training and unavailability of inputs. This is largely due to limited access to cheap finance and credit. The research recommends that farmers be given cheap finance and easily access credit using their crop as collateral securit...|$|E
