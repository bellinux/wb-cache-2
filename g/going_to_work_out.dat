500|$|The Economist heralded the book's publication, saying [...] "If {{there is}} no place for Watership Down in children’s bookshops, then children’s {{literature}} is dead." [...] Peter Prescott, senior book reviewer at Newsweek, gave the novel a glowing review: [...] "Adams handles his suspenseful narrative more dextrously than most authors who claim to write adventure novels, but his true achievement lies in the consistent, comprehensible and altogether enchanting civilisation that he has created." [...] Kathleen J. Rothen and Beverly Langston identified the work as one that [...] "subtly speaks to a child", with [...] "engaging characters and fast-paced action [...] make it readable." [...] This echoed Nicholas Tucker's praise for the story's suspense in the New Statesman: [...] "Adams ... has bravely and successfully resurrected the big picaresque adventure story, with moments of such tension that the helplessly involved reader finds himself checking whether things are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>out</b> all right on the next page before daring to finish the preceding one." ...|$|E
500|$|In August 2015, Butters {{and fellow}} {{executive}} producer Chris Dingess stated that Madame Masque {{would appear in}} the season, and that an actress had been cast in the role. Everett was confirmed to be playing the character that October. After being cast and seeing {{a picture of the}} comic version of the character, Everett felt [...] "'They got the wrong girl,' only because I look nothing like her. I was very nervous about it ... thought, 'They will probably dye my hair dark, and I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> need <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>out</b> a bit. And those are some pretty big boobs.'" [...] However, the producers were looking to take a different approach to the character, taking inspiration from [...] "Hollywood icons like Hedy Lamarr and Lauren Bacall". The character also does not wear the gold mask from the comics, though the show does reference this, with masks appearing in the background of many scenes featuring Frost. Ivy George and Olivia Welch portray younger versions of Cully during her time growing up in Broxton, Oklahoma.|$|R
5000|$|Clinton won {{the state}} by a 41-percentage-point margin, and told {{supporters}} that she was [...] "more determined than ever to carry on in this campaign". After exit polls revealed {{that large numbers of}} Clinton supporters were planning to vote for John McCain rather than Obama should she lose the nomination, Clinton said it would be a [...] "terrible mistake" [...] for those voters to do so: [...] "I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> my heart <b>out</b> for whoever our nominee is. Obviously, I'm still hoping to be that nominee, but I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do everything I can to make sure that anyone who supported me ... understands what a grave error it would be not to vote for Sen. Obama." ...|$|R
5000|$|New Mission Systems International {{was voted}} {{one of the}} Best Christian Work Places for 2010. [...] Missionaries have to undergo a ten-week {{training}} program called COAT (Community Orientation, Assessment and Training) before <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do mission <b>work</b> <b>out</b> of the country. COAT is a ten-week program that includes intense seminars, mentoring, and workshops to help them be more equipped to fundraise and for doing mission work in the field. This training is undergone at NMSI’s home base in Fort Myers, Florida at the Center for Global Outreach or CGO for short. All workers including missionaries, office staff, maintenance workers and even {{the president of the}} organization have to raise their own support <b>to</b> <b>work</b> there.

NMSI is prospected to have four hundred more missionaries deployed in the next ten years.|$|R
500|$|The {{producers}} {{devised a}} romance storyline {{for the character}} alongside Mike Young (Guy Pearce). Jane's grandmother is {{not happy with the}} prospect of Jane and Mike forming a relationship. Jane decides not to pursue their relationship any further. Pearce told Patrice Fidgeon from TV Week that his character mainly shared a [...] "platonic" [...] relationship with Jane. But writers introduced a temporary love interest for Jane, pilot Glen Matheson (Richard Moss) who is much older than her. Nell disapproves of her new boyfriend because of the age difference. But Jane decides to end the romance, Pearce explained that [...] "she realises this was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>out</b> and calls it quits." [...] This wins Nell's support of Jane's involvement with Mike who is of a similar age. The pair had not been on good terms prior to working together on a photography assignment. They spend the day with Charlene and Scott Robinson (Jason Donovan) but after they leave the pair spend time alone and resolve their past problems. Pearce added that his character had been trying to charm Jane for some time. Eventually [...] "she gives in" [...] to Mike, Pearce believed that she felt sorry for Mike but over time comes to the realisation that she [...] "really likes him".|$|E
500|$|Slayer {{began writing}} lyrics {{for a new}} album prior to their {{appearance}} at the 1999 Ozzfest. However, every {{three to four months}} the band was distracted by commitments to Ozzfest, and worldwide [...] "Tattoo the Earth" [...] tour with Slipknot. Guitarist Jeff Hanneman later admitted [...] "that was the last break. Then we got our shit together." [...] The band's longtime producer, Rick Rubin, was too busy to work with Slayer, and felt [...] "burned out"—unable to create intense music. Araya and King had similar feelings about Rubin, and King remarked he [...] "wanted to work with someone into the heavy-music scene, and Rubin's not anymore. I wanted somebody who knows what's hot, knows what's selling, knows the new techniques, and will keep me on my toes." [...] Rubin recommended two producers, although the first producer was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>out</b> personality-wise according to Hanneman. The band gave second candidate, Matt Hyde, a trial on the song [...] "Bloodline", which appeared in the movie Dracula 2000. The band was pleased with Hyde's work on [...] "Bloodline" [...] and hired him to produce the entire album. [...] "Bloodline" [...] was also briefly used in the 2009 film Law Abiding Citizen. The song [...] "Here Comes the Pain" [...] had originally been recorded almost two years prior to the release of God Hates Us All, appearing on the compilation album [...] in 1999, and then used as the opening theme for WCW Thunder from February 16, 2000 to the final episode on March 21, 2001.|$|E
2500|$|Generally, {{the album}} {{consists}} of urban contemporary gospel music containing elements of R, neo-soul and traditional black gospel music, with inspirational lyrics about building, maintaining and appreciating {{a relationship with}} God which also encourage the listener that [...] "everything is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>out</b> fine". The album's lead single, [...] "Heard a Word", sums up {{the theme of the}} album, with its chorus: [...] "I heard a word / Saying girl, you'll be fine / I heard a word that would ease my troubled mind / Took all the hurt away / Warmed me up inside like a summer day / So glad that you'd never break your promises". Other songs are tributes to the victims of the September 11, 2001, attacks in the United States; [...] "Better Place", written by Michelle Williams, Damon Elliott and Kayla Parker, is one such example which was inspired by the catastrophic event and is an emotional tribute to those who died in the attack.|$|E

Mason told Kerry Harvey writing for TV Guide that [...] "he will {{definitely}} ruffle a few feathers when he comes into the Bay. He's a tough sort of a bloke with a few unresolved issues. He's come to the Bay looking for Brax {{so it will be}} interesting to see what happens there, whether it's good or bad." [...] Mason added that most of Ash's scenes are shared with Brax. He revealed an on-set [...] "bromance" [...] had formed with Peacocke, who acted as a mentor for Mason. When Brax becomes aggressive with his brother Kyle Braxton (Nic Westaway) because of his bad experiences in prison; the Braxton family question whether Ash should be around Brax. Westaway told a TV Week reporter that [...] "everyone is trying to figure out whether having Ash there is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> help Brax <b>work</b> <b>out</b> his problems, or whether Ash will be a constant reminder of what was one of the most painful times in his life." ...|$|R
40|$|YesThat {{organizations}} {{exist in}} a fluid environment of unprecedented and discontinuous change seems beyond debate. We seem to find ourselves immersed {{in a world in}} which events have a tendency to unfold and overtake us in unforeseeable and novel ways that defy comprehension; a crisis of meaning takes place and conventional sensemaking is disrupted. Our need to imaginatively construct new meanings that allow us to understand what is <b>going</b> on and <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>out</b> how <b>to</b> respond becomes ever more pressing. We do live in interesting times. The emergence of the new, however, challenges current established ways of knowing and opens a creative space for radical learning to take place. Novelty stimulates the generative process by which organizations and individuals learn, adapt to and cope with the exigencies they face in order to survive and progress. Such radical learning occurs when creative linguistic interventions in dialogue opens up semantic spaces whereby new terms are coined and old ones broken up, combined and/or redeployed in novel ways, in an effort to give expression to the fresh circumstances experienced or new phenomena observed. We call this kind of imaginative linguistic intervention semantic transformation. In this paper we argue that it is this semantic transformation that promotes radical transformational learning. Such semantic transformation is predicated on the improvisatory character of dialogue as a form of communication. We explore how, through this dialogical process of semantic transformation, we discover the resources and means to respond to the vagueness and equivocality experienced, by exploiting language in novel ways in our attempts to make sense of and account for such experiences...|$|R

Around this time, the psychedelic LSD was gaining popularity. Garcia first began using LSD in 1964; later, when asked how it changed his life, he remarked: [...] "Well, it changed everything [...] the effect was that it freed me because I suddenly realized that my little attempt at having a straight life and doing that was really a fiction and just wasn't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>out.</b> Luckily I wasn't far enough into it {{for it to be}} shattering or anything; it was like a realization that just made me feel immensely relieved".|$|E

It was not my intention that it go as far as it did. I apologize to anyone offended – including the audience, MTV, CBS and the NFL." [...] Due to the event being accidental and unintentional, Jackson refused to release another apology statement to media outlets following this. Speaking to USA Today, Jackson said, [...] "It's truly embarrassing for me to know that 90 million [...] people saw my breast, and then to see it blown up on the Internet the size of a computer screen ... but there are much worse things in the world, and for this to be such a focus, I don't understand."
