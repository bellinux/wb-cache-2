The {{first was the}} degree of improvement over earthbound operations that might be expected. The second area of investigation covered the problems in developing a flowing buffer electrophoresis apparatus. The third area of investigation was the problem of testing on the ground equipment designed for use in space. The fourth area of investigation was the improvement to be expected in space for purification of biologicals. The results of some ground-based experiments are described.

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of extracting, isolating, purifying, separating, or preparing medical and biological products of high socio-economic value in space was studied. In particular, {{the study was}} designed to concentrate on the isolation or purification of virals, pharmaceutical and immunological agents by means of electrophoresis, as the Apollo 16 flight demonstrated that a mixed population of latex spheres (. 2 and. 8 microns) could be successfully separated by <b>electrophoresis</b> <b>in</b> <b>space</b> and without sedimentation with minimal convection. This prompted NASA scientists to look into the possibility of carrying out types of biochemical experiments that would utilize space for medical purposes...|$|E

He joined the McDonnell Douglas Corporation in 1977 as a test engineer on the Aft Propulsion Subsystem for the Space Shuttle orbiters.

40|$|The Center for Cell Research (CCR) is a NASA Center for the Commercial Development of Space {{which has}} as its main goal {{encouraging}} industry-driven biomedical/biotechnology space projects. Space Station Freedom (SSF) will provide long duration, crew-tended microgravity environments which will enhance the opportunities for commercial biomedical/biotechnology projects in bioseparations and physiological testing. The CCR bioseparations program, known as USCEPS (for United States Commercial <b>Electrophoresis</b> Program <b>in</b> <b>Space),</b> is developing access for American industry to continuous-flow <b>electrophoresis</b> aboard SSF. <b>In</b> <b>space,</b> considerable scale-up of continuous free-flow electrophoresis is possible for cells, sub cellular particles, proteins, growth factors, and other biological products. The lack of sedemination and buoyancy-driven convection flow enhances purity of separations {{and the amount of}} material processed/time. Through the CCR's physiological testing program, commercial organizations will have access aboard SSF to physiological systems experiments (PSE's); the Penn State Biomodule; and telemicroscopy. Physiological systems experiments involve the use of live animals for pharmaceutical product testing and discovery research. The Penn State Biomodule is a computer-controlled mini lab useful for projects involving live cells or tissues and macro molecular assembly studies, including protein crystallization. Telemicroscopy will enable staff on Earth to manipulate and monitor microscopic specimens on SSF for product development and discovery research or for medical diagnosis of astronaut health problems. Space-based product processing, testing, development, and discovery research using USCEPS and CCR's physiological testing program offer new routes to improved health on Earth. Direct crew involvement-in biomedical/biotechnology projects aboard SSF will enable better experimental outcomes. The current data base shows that there is reason for considerable optimism regarding what the CCDS program and the biomedical/biotechnology industry can expect to gain from a permanent manned presence <b>in</b> <b>space...</b>|$|R

Buoyancy driven convective flows due to thermal and concentration gradients are absent in the reduced gravity environment of space. The elimination of convection in weightlessness offers possible improvements in electrophoresis and other separation methods which occur in fluid media. The mathematical modeling suggests {{new ways of}} doing <b>electrophoresis</b> <b>in</b> <b>space</b> and explains various phenomena observed during past experiments. The extent to which ground based separation techniques are limited by gravity induced convection is investigated and space experiments are designed to evaluate specific characteristics of the fluid/particle environment.

40|$|The {{use of the}} {{microgravity}} {{environment to}} separate and purify biological cells and proteins {{has been a major}} activity {{since the beginning of the}} NASA Microgravity Science and Applications program. Purified populations of cells are needed for research, transplantation and analysis of specific cell constituents. Protein purification is a necessary step in research areas such as genetic engineering where the new protein has to be separated from the variety of other proteins synthesized from the microorganism. Sufficient data are available from the results of past <b>electrophoresis</b> experiments <b>in</b> <b>space</b> to show that these experiments were designed with incomplete knowledge of the fluid dynamics of the process including electrohydrodynamics.

40|$|We {{have shown}} that aq. 100 % (w/v) chloral hydrate (2, 2, 2 -trichloroethane- 1, 1 -diol) dissociates bovine heart {{cytochrome}} c oxidase. We have developed new procedures of polyacrylamide-gel <b>electrophoresis</b> <b>in</b> the presence of chloral hydrate that permit variation in the pH of the separation, and, by using these procedures, we have observed 15 components in preparations of the enzyme. This number contrasts with the eight bands that were seen on <b>electrophoresis</b> <b>in</b> the presence of SDS (sodium dodecyl sulphate) and urea. We have isolated material from these eight bands and have characterized each by <b>electrophoresis</b> <b>in</b> the presence of chloral hydrate. Twelve of the fifteen components that were seen by <b>electrophoresis</b> <b>in</b> chloral hydrate were identified as constituents of the eight bands seen by <b>electrophoresis</b> <b>in</b> the presence of SDS and urea. Two-dimensional electrophoretic separations confirmed these identifications ans showed that the other three components which were resolved as discrete bands by <b>electrophoresis</b> <b>in</b> the presence of chloral hydrate appeared to be diffusely present in the electrophoretic separations performed {{in the presence of}} SDS and urea, which suggested anomalous behaviour in that detergent. Trypsin treatment of cytochrome c oxidase caused total loss, as observed by electrophoretic separations in the presence of chloral hydrate, of a number of components. The trypsin-sensitive components included all of those that behaved anomalously in the presence of SDS and urea. Chloral hydrate is a potent non-ionic dissociating agent for cytochrome c oxidase and its use <b>in</b> polyacrylamide-gel <b>electrophoresis,</b> with variation <b>in</b> the pH of the gel, permits charge-dependent separations that should have general application in the analysis of membrane proteins...|$|R
