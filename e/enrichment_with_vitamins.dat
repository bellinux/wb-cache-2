40|$|ABSTRACT The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the interaction of types of maize (Provitamin A-biofortified maize (PABM) versus white maize) and strain of laying birds (Amberlink and Hyline) on nutritional quality of eggs. Twenty-one of each of Amberlink and Hyline laying hens were fed on three diets for 30 days. Birds were distributed in a 3 × 2 factorial arrangement constituting three diets (0, 50 or 100 % of PABM) and two strains (Amberlink & Hyline). There was a diet × strain interaction on egg shell weight, average daily feed intake, egg production, egg weight and egg shell thickness. Eggs produced by layers under 100 % PABM had lighter eggshell weight and lower eggshell percentage. In contrast, eggs produced by layers under 50 % PABM diet had signi-ficantly higher eggshell percentage, heavier egg shell weight and thicker eggshell. As the level of PABM increased, the yellow and red hue (Hunter a* and b* values) significantly increased while the lightness values (Hunter L* values) decreased. As the level of PABM in the ration increased, the vitamin A content of the egg yolk also significantly increased. Assimilation of vitamin A from feed to egg yolk in Amberlink and Hyline hens was similar. Hence, egg <b>enrichment</b> <b>with</b> <b>vitamin</b> A can be achieved by using PABM in layers ration. The use of high level of PABM had a negative effect on the eggshell quality traits...|$|R
40|$|Background: Little {{is known}} about the effect of vitamin D status on bone gain in adolescents. Objective: The {{objective}} was to examine whether vitamin D sta-tus is associated with accrual of bone mineral density (BMD) and bone mineral apparent density (BMAD). Design: This 3 -y prospective study examined the association between changes in BMD or BMAD and serum 25 -hydroxyvita-min D [25 (OH) D] in 171 healthy Finnish girls aged 9 – 15 y. Lum-bar spine and femoral neck BMDs were measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Results: Baseline 25 (OH) D correlated significantly with the unadjusted 3 -y change in BMD at the lumbar spine (r = 0. 35, P < 0. 001) and femoral neck (r = 0. 32, P < 0. 001) in all partici-pants. The difference from baseline in adjusted 3 -y BMD accu-mulation between those with severe hypovitaminosis D [25 (OH) D < 20 nmol/L] and those <b>with</b> a normal <b>vitamin</b> D status [25 (OH) D ≥ 37. 5 nmol/L] was 4 % (12. 7 %, 13. 1 %, and 16. 7 % for the lowest, middle, and highest tertiles of 25 (OH) D, respectively; P for trend = 0. 01) at the lumbar spine in the girls with advanced sexual maturation at baseline (n = 129). Moreover, the adjusted change in lumbar spine BMD was 27 % greater in the highest vitamin D intake tertile than in the lowest tertile in the same girls (P for trend = 0. 016). Conclusions: Pubertal girls with hypovitaminosis D seem to be at risk of not reaching maximum peak bone mass, particularly at the lumbar spine. Dietary <b>enrichment</b> or supplementation <b>with</b> <b>vitamin</b> D should be considered to ensure an adequate vitamin D status. Am J Clin Nutr 2002; 76 : 1446 – 53.

40|$|The {{effects of}} vitamin E and vitamin B 2 on DNA damage and {{cellular}} reduction of chromium(VI) were investigated using Chinese hamster V- 79 cells. Pretreatment <b>with</b> alpha-tocopherol succinate (<b>vitamin</b> E) {{resulted in a}} decrease of DNA single-strand breaks produced by Na 2 CrO 4, while similar treatment <b>with</b> riboflavin (<b>vitamin</b> B 2) enhanced levels of DNA breaks. In contrast, levels of DNA-protein crosslinks induced by Na 2 CrO 4 were unaffected by these vitamins. Electron spin resonance (ESR) studies showed that incubation of cells with Na 2 CrO 4 resulted {{in the formation of}} both chromium(V) and chromium(III) complexes, and cellular pretreatment <b>with</b> <b>vitamin</b> E reduced the level of the chromium(V) complex, whereas pretreatment <b>with</b> <b>vitamin</b> B 2 enhanced the level of this intermediate. However, the levels of chromium(III) were unchanged by these vitamins. The uptake of chromate was not affected by vitamin E or vitamin B 2, nor were the levels of glutathione or glutathione reductase activity, which are both capable of reducing chromate. ESR studies demonstrated that a chromium(V) species was formed by the reaction of Na 2 CrO 4 <b>with</b> <b>vitamin</b> B 2 and that vitamin B 2 enhanced the formation of hydroxyl radicals during the reaction of Na 2 CrO 4 and hydrogen peroxide. Treatment cells with Na 2 CrO 4 resulted in a decrease of glutathione reductase activity, and pretreatment <b>with</b> <b>vitamin</b> E restored the enzyme activity suppressed by this metal.

40|$|ABSTRACT Vitamin K {{deficiency}} {{results in}} the appearance of abnormal prothrombin, deficient in 7 -carboxyglutamic acid, in the blood. The presence of abnormal prothrombin can be eliminated or lowered by the administration of vitamin K. Since the abnormal prothrombin antigen assay is approximately 1000 -fold more sensitive than the prothrombin time for the diagnosis of vitamin K deficiency, this assay {{was used to evaluate}} patients <b>with</b> intestinal abnormalities. <b>Vitamin</b> K deficiency was found in 18 of 58 patients (31 %) with chronic gastrointestinal disease and/or resection. All patients <b>with</b> <b>vitamin</b> K deficiency had either Crohn’s disease involving the ileum or ulcerative colitis treated with sulfasalazine or antibiotics. Abnormal prothrombin levels returned toward normal in patients treated <b>with</b> <b>vitamin</b> K but not in patients who were not treated <b>with</b> <b>vitamin</b> K. The mean plasma vitamin E level in patients <b>with</b> <b>vitamin</b> K deficiency was significantly lower than in vitamin-K sufficient patients (p < 0. 01).

Aim: To clarify changes in the expression of inflammatory biomarkers from cultured sebocytes after treatment <b>with</b> <b>vitamin</b> D. Materials and Methods: Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was done to measure changes in the expression of inflammatory biomarkers, including interleukin- 1 β (IL- 1 β), IL- 6, IL- 8, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and several subtypes of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) after treatment of a group of cultured sebocytes <b>with</b> <b>vitamin</b> D. Vitamin D receptor (VDR) small interfering RNA (siRNA) was added in the other group of cultured sebocytes to assure the role of vitamin D on the expression of inflammatory biomarkers.

The {{aim of this study}} was to determine whether the stress of forced exercise would result in injury to the myocardium. The effects of stress induced by short bout strenuous exercise and long term exercise on serum, cardiac and skeletal muscle troponin, also blood glucose and insulin were measured. Moreover, to determine whether vitamin E supplementation could modulate these effects or not. Five groups of rats were investigated, control, strenuous exercised rats, exercised and supplemented rats <b>with</b> <b>vitamin</b> E, long term exercise and long term exercised rats supplemented <b>with</b> <b>vitamin</b> E. Strenuous exercised rats and supplemented rats <b>with</b> <b>vitamin</b> E. produced significant increase in serum, cardiac and skeletal muscle troponin concentration.

The aim of the present meta-analysis is to describe the risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism after treatment <b>with</b> <b>vitamin</b> K antagonist in relation to the time since the index event. Methods: Computerized searches in MEDLINE and EMBASE databases; reference checks of pertinent articles; personal communication with colleagues to find randomized clinical trials and cohort studies in which patients with venous thromboembolism were treated <b>with</b> <b>vitamin</b> K antagonists. Per treatment arm, 2 reviewers independently extracted data on the number of recurrent events and the duration of follow-up per time period of 3 months. Results: A total of 135 potentially eligible studies were identified. Of these, 18 studies could be included, comprising 25 treatment arms that could be analyzed. Treatment arms were divided into 3 groups based on treatment duration (short, medium, and long). For all 3 groups, the monthly incidence immediately after discontinuation of treatment was high and declined rapidly thereafter. The monthly incidence after 9 months seemed independent of the treatment duration. Conclusions: There is a diminishing risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism over time and a stabilization after 9 months independent of the duration of the initial treatment <b>with</b> <b>vitamin</b> K antagonists.
