2500|$|Bill Clinton said, [...] "This {{proves the}} <b>Iraqis</b> <b>are</b> not cooperating," [...] and {{he ordered the}} {{inspectors}} out. But you know the United States government ordered the inspectors {{to withdraw from the}} modalities without conferring with the Security Council. It took Iraqis by surprise. Iraqis were saying, [...] "We're playing by the rules, why aren't you? If you're not going play by the rules, then it's a game that we don't want to participate in." [...] Bill Clinton ordered the inspectors out. Saddam didn't kick them out.|$|E
2500|$|Shia–Sunni discord in Iraq {{starts with}} {{disagreement}} over the relative {{population of the}} two groups. According to most sources, including the CIA's World Factbook, the majority of <b>Iraqis</b> <b>are</b> Shia Arab Muslims (60%-70%), and Sunni Arab Muslims represent between 32% and 37% of the population. However, Sunni are split ethnically between Arabs, Kurds and Turkmen. Many Sunnis hotly dispute their minority status, including ex-Iraqi Ambassador Faruq Ziada, and many believe Shia majority is [...] "a myth spread by America". One Sunni belief shared by Jordan's King Abdullah {{as well as his}} then Defense Minister Shaalan is that Shia numbers in Iraq were inflated by Iranian Shias crossing the border. Shia scholar Vali Nasr believes the election turnout in summer and December 2005 confirmed a strong Shia majority in Iraq.|$|E

2500|$|Movie Maker Magazine {{asked the}} producers, [...] "Voices of Iraq {{is truly a}} {{groundbreaking}} film—both {{in terms of its}} content and the process behind its production. What was your main mission in creating this film?" [...] Eric Manes responded, [...] "Our goal was simply to give the Iraqi people a voice. [...] For years we had heard only the American media’s version of what Iraq and its people were like. We decided that since Iraq was such a major issue in the U.S., it was time to hear their story first-hand. <b>Iraqis</b> <b>are</b> a wonderfully diverse group {{of people who have been}} silenced for over 24 years, living in fear of Saddam Hussein and his regime. We realized we could finally give Iraqis a venue to freely share their lives, hopes and dreams with the rest of the world now that he was no longer in complete control of the country." [...] When questioned on the film's budget, Martin Kunert said, [...] "We used single chip, GR-D30U JVC cameras, which you can buy used on the net for around $230." [...] "Our budget came out to around $500,000. With inexpensive cameras and editing stations, the greatest expense was our post-production staff: translators and assistant editors. Second to that, the 35 mm blow-up." ...|$|E
