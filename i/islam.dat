5|$|By March 1964, MalcolmX {{had grown}} disillusioned with the Nation of <b>Islam</b> and its leader Elijah Muhammad. Expressing many regrets about {{his time with}} them, which {{he had come to}} regard as largely wasted, he embraced Sunni <b>Islam.</b> After a period of travel in Africa and the Middle East, which {{included}} completing the Hajj, he also became known as el-Hajj Malik el-Shabazz. He repudiated the Nation of <b>Islam,</b> disavowed racism and founded Muslim Mosque, Inc. and the Organization of Afro-American Unity. He continued to emphasize Pan-Africanism, black self-determination, and black self-defense.|$|E
5|$|Chinese {{who married}} local Javanese women and {{converted}} to <b>Islam</b> created a distinct Chinese Muslim Peranakan community in Java. Chinese rarely had {{to convert to}} <b>Islam</b> to marry Javanese abangan women but {{a significant amount of}} their offspring did, and Batavian Muslims absorbed the Chinese Muslim community which was descended from converts. Adoption of <b>Islam</b> back then was a marker of peranakan status which it no longer means. The Semaran Adipati and the Jayaningrat families were of Chinese origin.|$|E

5|$|Members of the Republican Army who {{had come}} from Indonesian Hizbullah felt betrayed by the Indonesian Government. In May 1948, they {{declared}} a break-away regime, the Negara <b>Islam</b> Indonesia (Indonesian Islamic State), better known as Darul <b>Islam.</b> Led by an Islamic mystic, Sekarmadji Maridjan Kartosuwirjo, Darul <b>Islam</b> sought to establish Indonesia as an Islamic theocracy. At the time, the Republican Government did not respond, as they were focused on the threat from the Dutch. Some leaders of Masjumi sympathised with the rebellion. After the Republic regained all territories in 1950, the government took the Darul <b>Islam</b> threat seriously, especially after some provinces declared that they had joined Darul <b>Islam.</b> The rebellion was put down in 1962.|$|E
5|$|Periyar openly {{suggested}} {{to those who}} were marginalised within the Hindu communities to consider converting to other faiths such as <b>Islam,</b> Christianity, or Buddhism. On <b>Islam,</b> he stated how it was good for abolishing the disgrace in human relationship, based on one of his speeches to railway employees at Tiruchirapalli in 1947. Periyar also commended <b>Islam</b> for its belief in one invisible and formless God; proclamation of equal rights for men and women; and advocating of social unity.|$|E
5|$|The {{first group}} of {{converts}} to <b>Islam</b> in Medina were the clans without great leaders; these clans had been subjugated by hostile leaders from outside. This {{was followed by the}} general acceptance of <b>Islam</b> by the pagan population of Medina, with some exceptions. According to Ibn Ishaq, this was influenced by the conversion of Sa'd ibn Mu'adh (a prominent Medinan leader) to <b>Islam.</b> Medinans who converted to <b>Islam</b> and helped the Muslim emigrants find shelter became known as the ansar (supporters). Then Muhammad instituted brotherhood between the emigrants and the supporters and he chose Ali as his own brother.|$|E

5|$|Although <b>Islam</b> is the {{official}} religion of the federation, Sarawak has no official state religion. However, during the chieftainship of Abdul Rahman Ya'kub, the Constitution of Sarawak was amended to make the Yang di-Pertuan Agong {{as the head of}} <b>Islam</b> in Sarawak and empower the state assembly to pass laws regarding Islamic affairs. With such provisions, Islamic policies can be formulated in Sarawak and the establishment of Islamic state agencies is possible. The 1978 Majlis <b>Islam</b> Bill enabled the setting up of Syariah Courts in Sarawak with jurisdictions over matrimonial, child custody, betrothal, inheritance, and criminal cases in the state. An appeals court and Courts of Kadi were also formed.|$|E

5|$|Although {{there is}} some debate within <b>Islam</b> over {{whether it is a}} {{religious}} requirement, circumcision (called khitan) is practiced nearly universally by Muslim males. <b>Islam</b> bases its practice of circumcision on the Genesis 17 narrative, the same Biblical chapter referred to by Jews. The procedure is not explicitly mentioned in the Quran, however, it is a tradition established by Islam's prophet Muhammad directly (following Abraham), and so its practice is considered a sunnah (prophet's tradition) and is very important in <b>Islam.</b> For Muslims, circumcision is also a matter of cleanliness, purification and control over one's baser self (nafs). There is no agreement across the many Islamic communities about the age at which circumcision should be performed. It may be done from soon after birth up to about age 15; most often it is performed at around six to seven years of age. The timing can correspond with the boy's completion of his recitation of the whole Quran, with a coming-of-age event such as taking on the responsibility of daily prayer or betrothal. Circumcision may be celebrated with an associated family or community event. Circumcision is recommended for, but is not required of, converts to <b>Islam.</b>|$|E
