In the tuna fishery, however, the <b>fish-finder</b> by ultrasonic wave has not been used so effective as in trawl and purse sein. For the study on the method of its field operation, the auther had some experiments with the <b>fish-finder</b> at Philippine Sea,in June and November 1962. The <b>fish-finder</b> wich where installed on M. S. NAGASAKIMARU, the fishery training vessel, Nagasaki Univ., 130 GT, has charactors shown inTabie 1. The one NEC 1620 type, was used for detecting tuna shoal, another 1600 type, for tracing the tuna longline under waterco ntribution. From these experiments,it was recognized that the <b>fish-finder</b> could sharply catch the reflaction from the fish and was very covenient for the study of their ecology. And from echograms that the ability of sounding capacity was about 8000 m by 13. 5 KC and 800 m by 200 KC under cruising by 9 knots on the slight or moderate sea,and detecting a sigle tuna (20 db, bcdy weight 35 kg) it was 250 m by 13. 5 KC (Fig. 2 & 3). The results obtained are summarized as follows. 1) Their typical echograms are shown in PLATE Ⅲ- 2. 3 and detecting area of tuna echosunder the above conditions is shown in Fig. 5. Furthermore,it was caluculated from Fig. 5 that the <b>fish-finder</b> could cover the conical volume, 108 m 3 per hour under cruising by 9 knots. 2) It was measured that the running ultrasonic noise was 40 db under cruising by 9 knots against the wind being 12 m/sec, and the reflection loss of yellow-fin tuna (B. W. 30 kg) was 22 db (Fig. 7). The single tuna, however, was recorded distinguishably as "Λ" on the paper which was filled with ultrasonic noise (PLATE Ⅲ- 2). As the result from analysis of those echograms, it was estimated that the tuna were in 40 - 200 m depth layer and most of them were in "resting state", and some-times a few of them moved with 1 - 5 knots reactively against the aproaching plancton net or fishing gear. (PLATE Ⅳ- 5, 6) ﻿ 3) Especially, {{the fact that there were}} no correlation between the density of their population and the daily catch per hook; will have a important point on the estimation of their population (Fig. 10, Table 3). 4) From the PLATE Ⅳ- 7,Ⅴ- 8, 9 shown the daily migration of D.

50|$|With {{the advent}} of {{gasoline}} motors, winter trolling has become a common practice, and provides fresh fish in the cold months that traditionally depended on stored fish. Trolling poles {{are similar to those}} used in sport fishing, but are much heavier and stronger with correspondingly heavier tackle and longer lines. They are set in the stern and along the side gunwales of a boat, baited or strung with flashing spoons or spinners. The boat then slowly motors around areas where salmon, usually kings, are known to school during the winter, aided by ultrasonic <b>fish-finders.</b> Periodically the lines are checked and brought in to remove fish. The same techniques are used for halibut as well. The harvest by this method is fairly small as it depends more on luck; salmon are not guaranteed to bite at lures and bait, unlike the certainty in catching them while spawning. Because of this limited take, trolling is usually avoided during spawning season and only used to bring home fresh fish in the winter. Trolling is often a family event done on the weekends, and often includes overnights on board. Because of the relative inactivity in trolling, the poles are not always well minded. This occasionally results in seals or sea lions snatching hooked fish still on the line and making off with them, causing much consternation and fun stories to tell later.|$|R

40|$|Studies {{investigating}} how mobile marine predators {{respond to}} their prey are limited due to the challenging nature of the environment. While marine top predators are increasingly easy to study thanks to developments in bio-logging technology, typically there is scant information on the distribution and abundance of their prey, {{largely due to the}} specialised nature of acquiring this information. We explore the potential of using single-beam recreational <b>fish-finders</b> (RFF) to quantify relative forage fish abundance and draw inferences of the prey distribution at a fine spatial scale. We compared fish school characteristics as inferred from the RFF with that of a calibrated scientific split-beam echo-sounder (SES) by simultaneously operating both systems from the same vessel in Algoa Bay, South Africa. Customized open-source software was developed to extract fish school information from the echo returns of the RFF. For schools insonified by both systems, there was close correspondence between estimates of mean school depth (R 2 = 0. 98) and school area (R 2 = 0. 70). Estimates of relative school density (mean volume backscattering strength; S v) measured by the RFF were negatively biased through saturation of this system given its smaller dynamic range. A correction factor applied to the RFF-derived density estimates improved the comparability between the two systems. Relative abundance estimates using all schools from both systems were congruent at scales from 0. 5 km to 18 km with a strong positive linear trend in model fit estimates with increasing scale. Although absolute estimates of fish abundance cannot be derived from these systems, they are effective at describing prey school characteristics and have good potential for mapping forage fish distribution and relative abundance. Using such relatively inexpensive systems could greatly enhance our understanding of predator-prey interactions...|$|R

The details of catch per haul of trawl and plankton nets were shown in Table 1. In this research, the author observed as follows. 1. The reflection loss of Kôraiebi ♀× 5, full length 22 - 24 cm, (see Fig. 2) was 38 db. 2. The scattering layers (SL) showed remarkable journal migration, but lower SL near the sea bed showed little migration. 3. After his 17 hauls of 7. 5 cm plankton nets, the author did not prove organisms of SL and supposed that the origin of SL was not only plankton (Schizopoda, Copepoda, Amphipoda, Sagitta and etc.) and marine snow as shown in Fig. 12, but also distinct zone of temperature and salinity of the sea water and exceptionally SL near the sea bed might be by muddy water disturbed by trawl nets. 4. On the 50 KC echogram, the number of single traced at the coverage depth of trawl net was also in substantial agreement with the number of fish caught per haul at the rate of water volume covered by trawl net and echo beam, but on the 200 KC echogram, it was very difficult to estimate such a relation, as it catches too sensitively, the reverberation from any scatters in the sea water.

Zooplankton {{play a vital}} role in lake ecosystems. They serve as an important food source for fish, as well as being major consumers of algae, which contributes to greater water clarity. To understand the dynamics in a lake, it is necessary to understand zooplankton and how they are affected by the physical environment around them. The purpose of this research was to address the question of how turbulence and temperature stratification affect zooplankton aggregations in lakes. Laboratory experiments were performed to quantify the effects of temperature and turbulence on zooplankton distributions in a stratified tank. These measurements were designed to measure zooplankton aggregations and to provide detailed information on the physical conditions causing them. Comprehensive field measurements were taken throughout one summer, covering five 24 -hour periods, in order to investigate the effects of temperature and turbulence on zooplankton aggregations in the field. A high-frequency sonar measurement device was developed to take the measurements by modifying the output of a commercial <b>fish-finder</b> and calibrating it to match zooplankton net counts.

We are using emerging remote technologies, {{in the form of a}} remote controlled jet boat to survey bathymetry, and Structure from Motion (SfM) to characterise terminus morphology, to better understand relationships between lake growth and terminus evolution. Comparison of results between the jet boat mounted dual-frequency Garmin <b>fish-finder</b> with an Odom Echotrac DF 3200 MKII with 200 / 38 kHz dual-frequency transducer, showed that after a sound velocity adjustment, the remote survey obtained depth data within ± 1 m of the higher grade survey equipment.

However in some regions, water depth was 180 m only 20 m away from the calving face. Here the sub-aerial cliff height was around 20 - 25 m, meaning portions of the terminus were, or very close to, buoyancy.

40|$|Mr. NISHIMURA {{has pointed}} out in his report that we have become able to know {{underwater}} distribution of tunas. The author on board the Nagasaki-Maru engaged in tuna long-line fishing in the South China Sea and in the waters off the Palau Is., in January, June and December 1961. The author tried to record the underwater formation of the long-line {{by means of the}} fish finder obtaining succcessful records as shown in PL. Ⅲ-Fig. 1 in June and analysable dater in December for the first time. Using those records in December, the author calculated the resistance of water against the long-line. From the result of calculation, the author believes that the echo-sounding is the most reliable method to verify the underwater formation of long-line and the distribution of tuna. The available range of the <b>fish-finder,</b> however, is rather limited, and the long-line can not be recorded in many cases by it as the long-line is often moved out of the signal range by currents and other factors, especially on rough sea. Factors affecting the depth of hooks 1. Design of the long-line, the longer the main line, branch lines and float lines are designed, the deeper the hooks sink. 2. Amount of slack allowed during setting-down of line, The larger the distances between each buoy become, the deeper the hooks sink. 3. Effects of current and wind, The stronger the current and wind flow, the shallower the hooks become. Variation of hook-depth after setting-down of line ﻿Fig. 1 is the diagrm in which those records show the sinking stages of the deepest part of main line. Half an hour after setting-down of long-line, the main line usually sinks to a maximum catenary depth of 100 m, and after one hour, it becomes perfectly balanced. Theoretical diagram of vertical distribution of the gear 1. In case of no effect from current and wind According to reports by YOSHIHARA (1951), MORITA (1955), HAMURO and ISHII (1961) and J. J. GRAHAM (1958), they have all agreeded thet the underwater condition of tuna long-line indicates a catenary curve with any effect from external force. Fig. 2 shows the scale graph of a tuna long-line used by the Nagasaki-Maru. The condition of the main line differs according to the distance between buoys. The actual hook-depth is equal to the sum of the values of the branch line setting-point, length of buoy line and the branch line, i. e., y=a. cosh・x/a, 1 / 2 of total length of main line= 1 / 2 of buoy distances+(1 / 2 buoy dist.) 3 / 6 a 2 2.

This endorheic basin has been formed through upwelling of the water table, {{and that it is}} continuously fed by the thermal springs situated on its shores. In the shore of Lake Specchio di Venere, CO 2 fluxes and concentrations were measured with the accumulation chamber method for a total of 136 measurements. Furthermore a vertical profile of main water chemical-physical characteristics (EC, pH, Eh and T) and a bathymetric survey have been made. Flux measurements for the whole surveys gave values ranging from 1 to 4700 gCO 2 m- 2 day- 1 and a median of 21. 8 gCO 2 m- 2 day- 1. Organic activity and root respiration contributes can be distinguished on a probability plot evidencing statistically distinct populations. In this case a threshold of 30 g m- 2 day- 1 to separate background (organic) from anomalous (magmatic/geothermal) values was chosen. The total CO 2 output of the anomalous degassing areas was estimated through statistical method considering only values above the anomaly threshold. We have obtained a total output of about 0. 349 kg s- 1 over an area of about 0. 103 km 2. CO 2 concentrations in soils ranged from 0. 035 (atmospheric value) up to 95 % and two statistically distinct populations. The spatial distributions of CO 2 concentrations closely resemble those of the CO 2 fluxes. At sites where concentration and flux anomalies are both present, the C isotopic composition of CO 2, shows the imprint of the magmatic/geothermal isotopic marker (5 ± 1 ‰). The lake waters were inspected with one vertical profile. All analysed parameters (T, EC, pH, Eh) did not show any significant variation with depth. Such results exclude the presence at that time of any thermal or chemical stratification of the lake. Also the analysis of dissolved gases did not evidence anomalous gas accumulations in the lake waters. A bathymetric survey has been carried out using a <b>fish-finder</b> sonar coupled to a GPS.
