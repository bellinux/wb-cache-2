40|$|The {{study of}} {{hematite}} dry and wet grinding {{by means of}} two different kinds of mill, i. e. Hardgrove mill and <b>jar</b> <b>mill</b> in the presence and absence of grinding additives, is presented in this paper. It was apparent that dry grinding with calcium stearate as grinding aid could improve the efficiency due to its Inbricating effect and deagglomeration of fines, while in wet process dispersant such as sodium hexametaphosphate was required to increase the grinding rate and prevent the agglomeration of ground hematite. Oolitic hematite tended to be ground more easily than specular hematite. In ultrafine grinding process, the <b>jar</b> <b>mill</b> was more efficient than the Hardgrove mill and higher efficiency was obtained by wet grinding.

For such a purpose, a rigorous control was realized over the distribution and size of pores. Suspensions at 30 vol. % of solids (zirconia or alumina powder and sucrose) and 70 vol. % of liquids (isopropyl alcohol and PVB) were prepared in a <b>jar</b> <b>mill</b> varying the milling time of the sucrose particles, according to the pores size expected. The membranes were prepared by isostatic pressing method and structurally characterized by SEM, porosimetry by mercury intrusion and measurements of weight by immersion. The morphological characterization of the membranes identified the formation of porous zirconia and alumina membranes and supported membranes. The results of porosimetry analysis by mercury intrusion presented an average pore size of 1. 8 mu m for the microfiltration porous membranes and for the ultrafiltration supported membranes, pores with average size of 0. 01 - 0. 03 mu m in the top-layer and 1. 8 mu m in the support.

40|$|The {{solubility}} {{advantage of}} indomethacin amorphized by co-grinding with Neusilin US 2 in various media was investigated. Physical mixtures of γ-indomethacin and Neusilin US 2 (in the ratios 1 : 1, 1 : 4 and 1 : 5) were amorphized {{at room temperature}} employing 75 % RH in a porcelain <b>jar</b> <b>mill</b> using zirconia balls. The crystallinity of the samples was determined using ATR-FTIR and PXRD. The solubility and dissolution profiles of co-ground powders and crystalline counterparts were evaluated in 0. 1  N HCl, water and phosphate buffer (pH  6. 8) in a USP type II dissolution apparatus at 250  rpm and 37 °C. Very high concentrations of dissolved indomethacin {{as compared to the}} solubility of γ-indomethacin (~ 500 times in water and ~ 3. 7 times in phosphate buffer) were attained. However, the presence of other polymorphs detected by PXRD and a change in the pH of the medium made interpretation of the results difficult. In 0. 1  N HCl the solubility (i. e., the peak in a concentration versus time plot) of the amorphized drug in a 1 : 5 ratio with Neusilin increased to 109 times the solubility of crystalline γ-indomethacin alone. An increase in amount of drug and Neusilin in the same ratio added to the dissolution medium also increased peak and plateau dissolution concentrations. The presence of silicic acid and ions (Mg 2 + and Al 3 +) in the dissolution media were found to cause the increase in the plateau concentration of indomethacin. Amorphization alone does not account for all of the dissolution enhancement; acidity, ions, and silicic acid are major contributors to dissolution enhancement...|$|E
40|$|Granular {{materials}} forming part {{of engineering}} {{structures such as}} rockfill dams, embankments, the base of flexible pavements and foundations are constantly subjected to harsh environmental conditions and external forces including static and dynamic loads. As a result, these materials experience various levels of fragmentation. In this study, the levels of fragmentation were analyzed from particle/grain size distribution (PSD) plots before and after fragmentation {{as well as the}} fractal dimension concept from fractal theory. The fractal dimension concept was found to evaluate well the fragmentation induced in specimens of sands, gravels and glass beads. Tests on abrasion as a result of peripheral fragmentation of gravels (5. 5 mm.) were produced in the laboratory using the <b>Jar</b> <b>mill</b> apparatus. Applying the area-perimeter method of fractal analysis, it was found that as the profile of the particles becomes more rounded the fractal dimension reduces in value. Total fragmentation and crushing of granular specimens induced in test apparatus such as the Bromhead Ring Shear, Universal Testing machine and Standard Proctor produces the PSD that evolves from a uniform to a well-graded condition. As a result, the fragmentation fractal dimension increases. Changes in the engineering properties such as the elastic moduli, hydraulic conductivity and the shear strength were also studied. Tests on the elastic moduli of the fragmented gravels using an ultrasonic velocity Pundit apparatus indicated an increase in the elastic moduli as the levels of fragmentation were increased. Hydraulic conductivity tests indicated that the permeability of the samples decreased as the levels of fragmentation increased. Shearing of Quartz sand (1. 6 mm.) in the Ring Shear apparatus indicated a decrease in the angle of internal friction as the fragmentation was increased. An investigation on the angle of repose of binary mixtures of coarse and fine materials on a smooth glass base as compared to that on rough surface porous stone base was also conducted. A theoretical relationship between the angle of repose, the angle of internal friction and the interface basal friction was developed. It was found that the different compositions of the binary mixture and the basal friction significantly influenced the angle of repose...|$|E
40|$|Natural Aggregate (NA) is an {{essential}} ingredient for producing concrete. However, NA is a depleting resource and the quarrying and mining process are not environmentalfriendly. Thus, Recycled Aggregate @A) is introduced as an alternative material to replace NA Such an approach has been widely accepted in developed countries like United Kingdom, United States, Netherland, Denmark and Hong Kong. Nevertheless, concrete containing RA or known as Recycled Aggregate Concrete (RAC) has certain weakness in terms of permeability. This study is conducted in depth to explore ways to overcome these problems. Micronised Biomass Silica (MBS) has been recognised as a material with a good potential for such application. MBS is derived from controlled incineration of rice husk which is amorphous and with silicon dioxide (SiOz) content for about 87. 67 %. The reduction of MBS particle size to 25. 77 pin was by means of <b>jar</b> <b>mill.</b> The grade of 25 MPa concrete was produced with cement content 450 kg/m 3 and w/c 0. 5. MBS are used as cement replacement material for up to 12 % by weight and RA was used for up to 100 %. Comparative {{study was conducted with}} three different conditions namely; concrete with RA, concrete with MBS and MBS-RA concrete was carried out. It was found that the incorporation of 12 % MBS and 100 % RA has produced concrete with water permeability coefficient 7. 94 x 10 ' 12 d s and water penetration depth 64. 5 rnm for 28 days age of concrete and its compressive strength is 35. 40 MPa. Furthermore, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) was used to examine the microstructure of RAC and Natural Aggregate Concrete (NAC). It was observed that the quality of RAC significantly influences by ITZ. Regression analysis was also conducted to establish the relationship among different parameters (compressive strength, water permeability coefficient and water penetration) for RAC, NAC, MBS concrete and MBS-RA concrete. It was discovered that compressive strength has strong relationship with water permeability coefficient and water penetration. Two equations were proposed for predicting the compressive strength and water penetration for RAC and MBS-RA concrete. For proposing these equations, SPSS 14 was used. A nomograph chart as a guideline to designing RAC (with or without MBS) was also developed as the outcome of this study. This chart named as Nomograph Chart MBS-RA Concrete which comprises four axes represent cement content, compressive strength at 28 days or 365 days, percentage of RA and water penetration.

40|$|Mixtures of {{scheelite}} {{and carbon}} black, with different CaWO 4 :C weight ratios were prepared using either {{planetary ball milling}} (PBM) or ball milling in a custom made <b>milling</b> <b>jar</b> (BM). Three <b>milling</b> conditions were employed: 120 h ball milling (BM- 120), 8 h planetary ball milling (PBM- 8) and 24 h PBM (PBM- 24). SEM and XRD were used to estimate qualitatively the intensity of milling conditions. The most intense milling conditions were attained after 24 h planetary ball milling (PBM- 24). Powder mixtures prepared by 120 h ball milling (BM- 120) or 8 h planetary ball milling (PBM- 8) showed similar results. All mixtures were studied by thermal analysis (TGA–DTA), isothermal annealing at 1200 °C (1 h), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and electron microscopy techniques to determine the combined effect of different amounts of carbon stoichiometric excess and different intensities of milling conditions on the phase purity of tungsten carbide formed by carbothermic reduction of scheelite (CaWO 4 + 4 C → CaO + WC + 3 CO). This reaction occurs through several steps, where the Ca:O atomic ratio goes from 1 : 4 to 1 : 1 according to the sequence: CaWO 4 → Ca 3 WO 6 → CaO, and concomitant development of CO. Finally, reduced tungsten bearing phases (W 2 C and/or W) are carburized to give nanostructured WC. The intensity of milling {{and the presence of}} a carbon excess do not influence significantly the reduction of scheelite to CaO, which goes to completion at temperatures lower than 1200 °C. However, only more intense milling conditions (PBM- 24) allow one to achieve an almost quantitative yield of WC, independent of the presence of a carbon excess in the initial CaWO 4 :C mixture.

The reduced {{size of the}} particles constituting the end product and the incorporation of defects cause modified materials properties and increased solid-state chemical reactivity. Among grinding devices, the planetary ball mill features high efficiency and versatility, being suitable for almost any kind of material, from metals and ceramics to organic compounds and pharmaceuticals. While its design and the working principle are rather simple, since grinding occurs by impacts between milling media (balls and <b>jar)</b> and <b>mill</b> charge, {{the characteristics of the}} end product strongly depend on a multitude of variables, determining balls trajectories and velocities and, in turn, the nature of impulsive forces exchanged during collisions.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{investigate}} the relationship between comminution and amorphisation of alpha-lactose monohydrate particles during ball milling under different milling conditions, including ball-to-powder mass ratio, milling time and ball diameter. The results revealed that at a constant ball filling ratio, ball-to-powder mass ratio of 25 : 1 resulted in the lowest minimum particle diameter of similar to 5 mu m and the highest degree of apparent amorphous content of 82 %. The rate of comminution was high during early stage of milling whereas the degree of apparent amorphous content increased gradually at a slow rate. An increased ball-to-powder mass ratio during milling increased both the rate of comminution and the rate of amorphisation. Using a given ball-to-powder mass ratio, the ball diameter affected the degree of apparent amorphous content of the particles while the particle diameter remained unchanged. The relationship between comminution and amorphisation could be described as consisting of two stages, i. e. comminution dominated and amorphisation dominated stage.

During the milling, Fe(NO 3) 3 was first decomposed to iron oxide under milling collisions, and the iron oxide was then reduced to Fe by either NH 3 or B. These reduced Fe {{was much more}} reactive than the steel particles from the collisions between the steel <b>milling</b> <b>jar</b> and balls, due to both the more stable nature of steel and the smaller particle sizes of the chemically reduced Fe. During the heating up to 1, 300 °C in nitrogen-containing gases, the Fe became quasi-liquid at lower temperature than the steel particles and provides a better catalytic effect. BNNTs started to form from the BN layers precipitating {{on the surface of}} the metal particles diffused with excessive B and N atoms, following the VLS growth mechanism [22]. As a result, a strong BN phase XRD peak was observed after the heating (Figure[*] 5 (iv)). The Fe(NO 3) 3 [*]+[*]B milled powder showed even better BNNT yield than the B ink, possibly thanks to the 71 % more N content of the Fe(NO 3) 3 milled powder. The amorphous B-N phase produced by milling is unstable and can directly provide N source for BNNT growth with little aid from the nitrogen-containing gas. This can reduce the temperature of BNNT formation and result in a better yield of BNNTs.|$|R

Two systems were studied: (i) forms I and II of a 1 : 1 theophylline : benzamide cocrystal and (ii) forms A and B of an aromatic disulfide compound. For both systems, the most stable-bulk polymorph converted to the metastable-bulk polymorph upon NG. LAG experiments yielded different outcomes depending {{on the amount of}} solvent used. This was further investigated by performing carefully controlled LAG experiments with increasing μL amounts of solvents of different nature. With these experiments, we were able to monitor form A to B and form I to II conversions as a function of solvent concentration and derive polymorph equilibrium curves. The concentration required for a switch in polymorphic outcome was found to be dependent on solvent nature. We propose that these experiments demonstrate a switch in thermodynamic stability of the polymorphs in the <b>milling</b> <b>jar.</b> Form B, the stable-bulk polymorph, has less stable surfaces than form A, thus becoming metastable at the nanoscale when surface effects become important. Ex situ diffraction and electron microscopy data confirm crystal sizes in the order of tens of nanometers after the ball mill grinding experiments reach equilibrium. DFT-d computations of the polymorph particles stabilities support these findings and were used to calculate cross-over sizes of forms A and B as a function of solvent. Attachment energies and surface stabilities of the various crystalline faces exposed were found to be very sensitive to the solvent environment. Our findings suggest that surface effects are significant in polymorphism at the nanoscale and that the outcomes of equilibrium ball-mill NG and LAG experiments are in general controlled by thermodynamics.

Green spheres of PuO/sub 2 / were formed in a small <b>mill</b> <b>jar</b> and the particle size distributions of both the formable and non-formable powder fractions were determined by centrifugal sedimentation size analysis. Preparation of duplex pellets for determining the reaction between PuO/sub 2 / [...] UO/sub 2 / and possible cladding and diluent metals was continued. Pellets of pure PuO/sub 2 / and six compositions of coprecipitated PuO/sub 2 / [...] UO/sub 2 / were fabricated for corrosion testing in water and steam. Preliminary tests in steam at 750 deg F and 2200 psi for 10 hr showed no visual evidence of corrosion. The NUSURP code was modified to allow calculation of undermoderated systems. Equipment is being installed in alpha boxes. (M. C. G. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} of ball milling for in situ production of fermentable AXOS in {{wheat and rye}} bran in a dry milling process was investigated. An extensive lab scale ball mill treatment (120 h, 50 % jar volume capacity) increased the wheat bran water-extractable arabinoxylan (WE-AX) level from 4 % (untreated bran) to 61 %. Extractable AX fragments had an arabinose to xylose (A/X) ratio of 0. 7 and an average degree of polymerization (avDP) of 70. Ball-milling of rye bran gave rise to similar results, the A/X ratio of the extracted AX being somewhat lower (0. 5) compared to wheat bran. Optimization of the ball mill treatment by varying the degree of filling of the <b>milling</b> <b>jar</b> permitted to obtain equally high WE-AX levels (> 65 %) in wheat and rye bran within a 24 h ball-milling period. Ball-milling at optimal conditions yielded wheat bran AXOS with an A/X ratio of 0. 7 and an avDP of 38. Ball milling (24 h, 50 % jar volume capacity) of isolated wheat bran pericarp increased the WE-AX level from 1 (untreated pericarp) to 63 %. The extractable material was characterized by a high A/X (0. 97) and a low avDP (44). In vitro fermentation of the wheat bran AXOS preparation (A/X 0. 7, avDP 38, 42 % AXOS) with human fecal inoculum showed that 45 % and 65 % of the arabinose and xylose residues, respectively, were consumed within 48 h, leaving behind AXOS with a high A/X ratio (1. 0). Fermentation gave rise to production of short-chain fatty acids, the largest increase being observed for butyric acid. Surprisingly, {{in spite of the}} very high A/X value, the wheat pericarp AXOS preparation (A/X 0. 97, avDP 44, 61 % AX) was partially fermented (30 and 40 %, of the arabinose and xylose residues, respectively). These results show that AXOS can be produced in situ in wheat or rye bran in a single-stage dry milling process, rendering a wet extraction step redundant. It can be assumed that these preparations can exert prebiotic properties similar to what we observed in chickens 1 - 2 and rats 3 with isolated wheat bran-derived AXOS. status: accepte...|$|R
