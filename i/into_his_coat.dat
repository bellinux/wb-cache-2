5|$|As {{a mark of}} esteem, the Prince Regent made {{a special}} grant to allow the heraldic {{supporters}} {{that would have been}} incorporated <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>coat</b> of arms if he had lived, to be incorporated into the arms of Brock's father's descendants, and on monuments raised in Brock's memory.|$|E
25|$|By all accounts, Smith was a well-respected and even-tempered man. However Bogan's taunts {{began to}} wear on Smith, who {{eventually}} climbed down from his wagon and headed toward Bogan. As Smith walked toward Bogan, the latter stuck his hand <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>coat.</b> Smith told {{him that if he}} pulled his gun, he'd knock him to the ground. Bogan did pull his pistol, at which point Smith did knock him down with one punch. The two then wrestled briefly before Smith was able to take the young man's gun from him. As he did this, Kemp ran over producing his own handgun, and hit Smith {{in the back of the}} head. Smith then turned and pointed his pistol at Kemp, and pulled the trigger. However, the pistol misfired, according to witnesses, and Kemp fled at top speed. Smith turned Bogan's pistol over to the town marshal.|$|E
500|$|This {{traditional}} ancestry may {{be traced}} to the late 17th century when a chief adopted the designation of [...] "McOlaus" [...] and another was the first MacLeod to incorporate the royal Manx arms into MacLeod heraldry. In a document dating to 1630, Iain Mòr MacLeod of Dunvegan (chief 1626–1649) appears as [...] "John McOlaus of Dunvegane"—McOlaus representing MacOlaf. This chief's son, Iain Breac (chief 1664–1693), is the first MacLeod to have incorporated the Manx triskelion <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>coat</b> of arms. The triskelion was borne in the arms of the kings of Mann and the Isles {{as far back as the}} 13th century. The earliest known arms borne by the MacLeods of Harris and Dunvegan (pictured top-right) are, however, quite different the royal Manx arms. These earliest MacLeod arms date to the mid 15th century; recorded in a leading European armorial known as the Armorial de Berry. Accordingly, it has been suggested that these points show that 17th century belief of a descent from Olaf was not one of long standing.|$|E
60|$|Duson knocked softly at the door. Mr. Sabin {{thrust the}} letter and {{envelope}} <b>into</b> <b>his</b> breast <b>coat</b> pocket.|$|R
60|$|And having thus reconsecrated {{the ties}} of blood, he passed {{down the steps}} at his {{youthful}} gait and was wrapped <b>into</b> <b>his</b> fur <b>coat</b> by the junior porter.|$|R
60|$|Hendry was hustled <b>into</b> <b>his</b> Sabbath <b>coat,</b> {{and then}} came a tap at the door, a very genteel tap. Jess nodded to Leeby, who softly shoved Hendry into the room.|$|R
2500|$|The last {{survivor}} of the Ludlow Massacre, Mary Benich-McCleary, died of a stroke {{at the age of}} 94 on June 28, 2007. She was 18 months old when the massacre occurred. [...] McCleary's parents and her two brothers narrowly escaped death when the conductor of the train that brought the militia to the tent colony stopped the train to shield the family and others trying to flee, but Mary had been left behind. A 16-year-old boy heard her screams, gathered her up <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>coat</b> and then ran into the woods. Mary and the boy were found several days later, still hiding. McCleary's daughter said family members didn't speak of the massacre.|$|E
2500|$|On 23 November 1654, between 10:30 and 12:30 at night, Pascal had {{an intense}} {{religious}} vision and immediately recorded {{the experience in}} a brief note to himself which began: [...] "Fire. God of Abraham, God of Isaac, God of Jacob, not of the philosophers and the scholars..." [...] and concluded by quoting Psalm 119:16: [...] "I will not forget thy word. Amen." [...] He seems to have carefully sewn this document <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>coat</b> and always transferred it when he changed clothes; a servant discovered it only by chance after his death. This piece {{is now known as}} the Memorial. The story of the carriage accident as having led to the experience described in the Memorial is disputed by some scholars.|$|E
60|$|He dived {{his hand}} once more <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>coat.</b> 'And also this,' he said.|$|E
6000|$|... "Huh!" [...] {{the other}} repeated, {{reaching}} <b>his</b> one talon <b>into</b> <b>his</b> side <b>coat</b> pocket with swift definiteness. [...] "A {{hell of a}} chance you two cheap bums 'd have with me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hold on, now, that's too much!" [...] Bill {{dropped the}} trunk {{to the floor}} with a bang, {{straightened}} up, and thrust <b>his</b> hand <b>into</b> <b>his</b> inside <b>coat</b> pocket. [...] "I told you I was only kiddin'. There, look at that." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was seven}} o'clock {{when the doctor}} came down into the hall, and stood rubbing his freshly washed hands before opening the study door. Winton was still sitting before the fire, motionless, shrunk <b>into</b> <b>his</b> fur <b>coat.</b> He raised himself a little and looked round dully.|$|R
6000|$|... "You said it," [...] Old Tarwater remarked sententiously, {{tossing the}} single-tree aside and {{starting}} to struggle <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>coat.</b>|$|E
60|$|I had strolled {{with him}} {{so far as}} the cloak-room and was helping him to get <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>coat.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Epstein reached <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>coat.</b> [...] "Here." [...] He {{tossed a}} packet of {{photographs}} onto the table, tied with a string. [...] "Look for yourself." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{locked the}} books away {{and put him}} <b>into</b> <b>his</b> hat and <b>coat.</b> But I had much {{difficulty}} in getting {{him out of the}} office.|$|R
60|$|Aaron {{looked up}} at him quickly. But almost before there was time to speak, Lilly had slipped <b>into</b> <b>his</b> hat and <b>coat,</b> seized <b>his</b> letters, and gone.|$|R
50|$|Hercules {{is given}} a series of {{challenges}} each one was designed tougher by the other by his stepmother Hera. He was first sent to kill the Nemean lion which he succeeded <b>into</b> turning <b>his</b> <b>coat.</b> He also drove away the Stymphalian birds {{with the help of}} Athena's cymbals. Each one was made difficult by the other as his stepmother hopes to see the last of him.|$|R
6000|$|Sherikov reached slowly <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>coat.</b> He {{drew out}} a manila envelope. [...] "Here's all the {{information}} I collected about him, while he was with me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hear, hear," [...] ejaculated Alan, [...] "there {{goes the}} gong. Mind {{you come in}} and help to wait," [...] and hurrying <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>coat</b> he {{departed}} downstairs.|$|E
60|$|The man {{left the}} room. Wingate sat upon {{the arm of}} an easy-chair. Shields stood looking meditatively about him, his hands thrust deep <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>coat</b> pockets.|$|E
60|$|My uncle got <b>into</b> <b>his</b> hat and <b>coat,</b> and buckled an old rusty cutlass on; {{and then}} we trod the fire out, locked the door, and set forth upon our walk.|$|R
50|$|The {{outbreak}} of the Northern Seven Years' War in 1563 is mainly attributed to Denmark's displeasure over {{the dismantling of the}} Kalmar Union in the 1520s. When the Danish king Christian III (reigned 1534-1559) included the traditionally Swedish insignia of three crowns <b>into</b> <b>his</b> own <b>coat</b> of arms, the Swedes interpreted this as a Danish claim over Sweden. In response Erik XIV of Sweden (reigned 1560-1568) added the insignia of Norway and Denmark to <b>his</b> own <b>coat</b> of arms.|$|R
6000|$|He {{returned}} to the room and proceeded to struggle <b>into</b> <b>his</b> heavy <b>coat,</b> Chauvelin as before making no attempt to help him. He sat once more huddled up in the ingle-nook hugging his elbows with his thin white hands. There was a smile half scornful, but not wholly dissatisfied around his bloodless lips. When Martin-Roget {{was ready to go}} he called out quietly after him: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never mind it's not wet," [...] he said, {{pulling his}} cap {{over his eyes}} and {{plunging}} <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>coat,</b> regardless of the [...] "elegancies" [...] that afflicted him.|$|E
60|$|She {{took the}} candle and {{went a little}} in front. He hurried <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>coat</b> and {{gathered}} his tools, anxious to get away. She faced him, holding the candle.|$|E
6000|$|... "I wish we {{had gone}} with Dick and Uncle Randolph," [...] said Tom, as he slipped <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>coat</b> and shoes. [...] "I don't like this thing at all." ...|$|E
60|$|Lady Bellair assumed her coldest and haughtiest glance. Mrs. Montgomery {{appeared}} more gorgeous than ever. The splendour of her sweeping train almost required a page to support it; {{she held a}} bouquet which might have served for the centre-piece of a dinner-table. A slender youth, rather distinguished in appearance, simply dressed, with a rose-bud just twisted <b>into</b> <b>his</b> black <b>coat,</b> but whose person distilled odours whose essence might have exhausted a conservatory, lounged at her side.|$|R
6000|$|Levi did {{not seem}} to notice his scrutiny, leaning forward, now with his palms spread out to the {{grateful}} warmth, now rubbing them slowly together. But at last he suddenly whirled his chair around, rasping on the floor, and faced his stepbrother. He thrust <b>his</b> hand <b>into</b> <b>his</b> capacious <b>coat</b> pocket and brought out a pipe which he proceeded to fill from a skin of tobacco. [...] "Well, Hi," [...] said he, [...] "d'ye see I've come back home again?" ...|$|R
60|$|Ten {{minutes later}} {{we were both}} in a cab, and {{rattling}} through the silent streets {{on our way to}} Charing Cross Station. The first faint winter's dawn was beginning to appear, and we could dimly see the occasional figure of an early workman as he passed us, blurred and indistinct in the opalescent London reek. Holmes nestled in silence <b>into</b> <b>his</b> heavy <b>coat,</b> and I was glad to do the same, for the air was most bitter, and neither of us had broken our fast.|$|R
6000|$|... "Eh? Oh, ah, yes!" [...] Freddie {{struggled}} <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>coat.</b> More {{than ever}} did the adult Wally {{remind him of}} the dangerous stripling of years gone by. [...] "Well, cheerio!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{book will}} cut no figure in this matter," [...] replied the official, {{slipping}} it <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>coat</b> pocket; [...] "all the entries in it were {{made before the}} writer's death." ...|$|E
60|$|His master nodded, and the man, hastily {{pulling up}} {{the neck of}} his shirt and {{thrusting}} his arms <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>coat,</b> followed him as {{he led the way}} slowly to the well.|$|E
5000|$|He also {{cites the}} case of a man strolling by a canal when he saw a girl staring petrified at the water. [...] "Before he knew quite why, he had jumped <b>into</b> the water—in <b>his</b> <b>coat</b> and tie. Only once he was in the water did he realize that the girl was staring in shock at a toddler who had fallen in—whom he was able to rescue." ...|$|R
60|$|Immediately {{inside the}} front door was the door of his sitting-room; he flung it open, and stood in a coaxing attitude. Try how she would, Grace could not resist the supplicatory mandate written in the face and manner of this man, and {{distressful}} resignation sat on her as she glided past him <b>into</b> the room--brushing <b>his</b> <b>coat</b> with her elbow by reason of the narrowness.|$|R
60|$|He went {{clear up}} to the branch post-office after breakfast to get the Sunday mail, but the mail was a disappointment. He was {{awaiting}} a wonderful fully illustrated guide to the Land of the Midnight Sun, a suggestion of possible and coyly improbable trips, whereas he got only a letter from his oldest acquaintance--Cousin John, of Parthenon, New York, the boy-who-comes-to-play of Mr. Wrenn's back-yard days in Parthenon. Without opening the letter Mr. Wrenn tucked it <b>into</b> <b>his</b> inside <b>coat</b> pocket, threw away his toothpick, and turned to Sunday wayfaring.|$|R
