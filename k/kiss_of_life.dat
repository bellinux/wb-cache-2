500|$|Chris Cottingham of NME {{gave the}} album {{six out of}} ten, saying that [...] "Tinie is most {{definitely}} a star, second only to Dizzee Rascal on the UK scene, perhaps even above him following Dizzee's dismal ‘The Fifth’ album. So perhaps it's no surprise Tinie's brimming with confidence on record number two." [...] However, Cottingham dismissed the quality of some lyrics as [...] "all great fun for him, no doubt, {{but in the past}} he didn’t trade in this lowest common denominator stuff." [...] Robert Copsey of Digital Spy gave the album three out of five stars, describing the album as [...] "inoffensive grime-pop for the masses that makes all the right moves, but lacks any serious bite." [...] Larry Day of musicOMH gave the album two and half out of five stars, commenting [...] "this is a massive collaborative project. That's probably the reason it's such a chaotic, unwieldy mess." [...] On the other hand, he praised the promotional single [...] "Don't Sell Out", saying [...] "crunchy handclaps and jerky hooks work a <b>kiss</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> on the record, and Tempah's lyrics are fascinating to listen to – he compares himself to Othello and nods to everything from the Queen to Celebrity Juice – if utterly misogynistic." [...] Day concluded the review with [...] "Tempah has gone from rapping with a knowing wink or a glint in his eye to unloading a lewd spiel sans wit." ...|$|E

Then, the following season, Aberdeen's John McMaster had to be given the <b>kiss</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> at Ibrox after a vicious stamp on his throat. Relations between fans were further soured during a league match on 8 October 1988, when Aberdeen player Neil Simpson's tackle on Rangers' Ian Durrant resulted in Durrant being injured for two years. Resentment continued and in 1998 an article in Rangers match programme branded Aberdeen fans [...] "scum", although Rangers later issued a [...] "full and unreserved apology" [...] to Aberdeen and their supporters, which was accepted by Aberdeen. Fixtures have been described as [...] "even more of a powderkeg than Old Firm games".|$|E

She later starred as Mary Shelley in the 1986 film Gothic, a fictionalised account of the author's creation of Frankenstein.

2500|$|Allmusic were {{a little}} more generous, calling Brilliant an {{initially}} [...] "promising act: a more soulful take on the aggressive funk-rock of Killing Joke" [...] but added that, after being teamed up with Stock, Aitken and Waterman, they [...] "came up with a generic pop-dance album that fell well short of the original concept". Awarding <b>Kiss</b> the Lips <b>of</b> <b>Life</b> two stars out of five, they added that [...] "What aggression there is comes courtesy of Jimmy Cauty's metallic guitar solos; the sterile synth whitewash of SAW dominates {{the rest of the}} mix, and vocalist June Montana isn't strong or distinctive enough to fight through it".|$|R
