5|$|The {{draft was}} then {{transferred}} by pencil on white-primed panels of hardwood end grain. Not {{only was it}} hard work, but {{the quality of the}} printing block was crucial. Everything left white on the block, around Busch's drawn lines, was cut from the plate by skilled engravers. Wood engraving allows a finer differentiation than woodcut and the potential tonal values are of almost the quality of <b>intaglio</b> <b>printing,</b> such as copper engraving. Sometimes the result was not satisfactory, leading Busch to rework or reproduce plates. The wood engraving technique did not allow for fine lines, which is why Busch's drawing, especially in his illustrated tales up to the mid-1870s, are boldly drawn, giving his work its particular characteristic.|$|E
25|$|In 1965, 100-won notes (series III) {{were printed}} using <b>intaglio</b> <b>printing</b> techniques, {{for the first}} time on {{domestically}} printed notes, to reduce counterfeiting.

25|$|The {{printing}} process involves the substrate passing through presses for lithographic printing, <b>intaglio</b> <b>printing,</b> numbering printing, and varnish printing. The inks are transferred using the prepared plates, which are replaced when worn. The opacifier layers enable the inks of the offset and <b>intaglio</b> <b>printing</b> {{to adhere to}} the substrate. The varnish printing stage applies a required protective varnish to the polymer substrate. Offset printing deposits a 1.5µm layer, intaglio about 24µm, and the protective varnish is about 2µm thick.|$|E

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of my diploma work is to create {{intimate}} and expressive confession through my graphic work in <b>intaglio</b> <b>print</b> techniques. In the theoretical part I have researched the meaning of expression in art. I have closely examined the theoretical question as a role of graphic techniques for a certain expression, graphic drawing, lines and its expressiveness, gradation and format. I have connected the description of <b>intaglio</b> <b>print</b> techniques with my own artistic experience and presented my findings regarding their character and expressive options. I have also gathered information about the period of neoexpressionism and the evolvement of <b>intaglio</b> <b>print</b> during that period. In the second part I have exposed my own graphic work accompanied with intimate thoughts. I have connected the created work with expression and searching for personal identity. In the last part, the pedagogical one, I have analysed the educational process and pupils' final works after the implementation of art course dealing <b>intaglio</b> <b>print...</b>|$|R

25|$|Problems arose {{with the}} web press. The main {{drawback}} was {{its inability to}} sustain long continuous runs compared to the standard (Giori) sheet fed method of <b>intaglio</b> <b>printing,</b> resulting in constant breakdown. In addition, {{the quality of the}} prints were subpar compared to the established method. Due to these factors, the web press was discontinued in July 1996.|$|E
25|$|Between 1992 and 1996, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing experimented {{to see if}} a {{web press}} that used {{continuous}} rolls of paper was quicker and cheaper than <b>intaglio</b> <b>printing,</b> which used flat sheets. The affected notes are dollar bills from Series 1988A, Series 1993 and Series 1995. They are legal tender and are not considered error notes, although they are valuable due to their rarity.|$|E
25|$|The first {{denomination}} of {{the second}} series of pengő banknotes was the 1000 pengő note, designed by Zoltán Egri. In contrast to the 1926 series, this banknote (as {{well as the other}} bills of this series) was printed using <b>intaglio</b> <b>printing.</b> The next banknote of the series was the 5 pengő note (dated 1928), then the 10 pengő (1929), 20 and 100 pengő (1930), and the 50 pengő notes (1932). These banknotes were designed by Álmos Jaschik.|$|E

25|$|As a {{printing}} technology, lithography {{is different from}} <b>intaglio</b> <b>printing</b> (gravure), wherein a plate is either engraved, etched, or stippled to score cavities to contain the printing ink; and woodblock printing or letterpress printing, wherein ink {{is applied to the}} raised surfaces of letters or images. Today, most types of high-volume books and magazines, especially when illustrated in colour, are printed with offset lithography, which has become {{the most common form of}} printing technology since the 1960s.|$|E
25|$|Engraving is the {{practice}} of incising a design onto a hard, usually flat surface by cutting grooves into it. The result may be a decorated object in itself, as when silver, gold, steel, or glass are engraved, or may provide an <b>intaglio</b> <b>printing</b> plate, of copper or another metal, for printing images on paper as prints or illustrations; these images are also called engravings. Wood engraving {{is a form of}} relief printing and is not covered in this article.|$|E
25|$|Gravure {{printing}} is an <b>intaglio</b> <b>printing</b> technique, {{where the}} image being printed {{is made up}} of small depressions in the surface of the printing plate. The cells are filled with ink, and the excess is scraped off the surface with a doctor blade. Then a rubber-covered roller presses paper onto the surface of the plate and into contact with the ink in the cells. The printing cylinders are usually made from copper plated steel, which is subsequently chromed, and may be produced by diamond engraving; etching, or laser ablation.|$|E

25|$|Several, albeit disputable, errors {{have been}} {{discovered}} on banknotes of the New Generation series and have become the subject of ridicule over social media sites.

The result may be a decorated object in itself, as when silver, gold or steel are engraved, or may provide an <b>intaglio</b> <b>printing</b> plate, of copper or another metal, for printing images on paper, which are called engravings. Engraving was a historically important method of producing images on paper, both in artistic printmaking, and also for commercial reproductions and illustrations for books and magazines. It has long been replaced by photography in its commercial applications and, {{partly because of the}} difficulty of learning the technique, is much less common in printmaking, where it has been largely replaced by etching and other techniques. Other terms often used for engravings are copper-plate engraving and Line engraving. These should all mean exactly the same, but especially in the past were often used very loosely to cover several printmaking techniques, so that many so-called engravings were in fact produced by totally different techniques, such as etching.|$|E
