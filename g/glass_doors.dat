5|$|Concerts {{performed}} by the Grant Park Orchestra and directed by Kalmar {{were part of a}} June 19, 2009, citywide Burnham Plan centennial celebration that included the unveiling of the Burnham Pavilion elsewhere in the park. The concert featured the world premiere of Michael Torke's work for symphony and chorus entitled Plans, paired with Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 3. Also, the pavilion serves as host to the annual Chicago Winter Dance Festival. During the festival there is a month of free dance instructions behind the <b>glass</b> <b>doors</b> of the pavilion stage and free skating instruction at the McCormick Tribune Plaza & Ice Rink.|$|E
5|$|Bertha's broad {{circulation}} produced high waves {{which were}} reported along the southeastern {{coast of the}} United States, in North Carolina, the storm produced waves of 25–50ft (7.6-15.2m). The waves caused minor beach erosion along the North Carolina coastline including the Outer Banks. In Florida, rip currents from Bertha caused two drowning fatalities. 200other swimmers were rescued from the rough seas. The vortex of Bertha forced warm air and blocked sea breezes from South Florida. As a result, record high temperatures were reported in West Palm Beach, Miami, Hollywood, and Miami Beach; temperatures also tied records in Fort Lauderdale. The extreme heat also shattered numerous sliding <b>glass</b> <b>doors</b> and exhausted several air conditioners.|$|E
5|$|Goldfinger was premiered at the Odeon Leicester Square in London on 17 September 1964, {{with general}} release in the United Kingdom the {{following}} day. Leicester Square {{was packed with}} sightseers and fans and police were unable to control the crowd due {{to the number of}} people. A set of <b>glass</b> <b>doors</b> to the cinema was accidentally broken and the premiere was shown ten minutes late because of the confusion. The United States premiere occurred on 21 December 1964, at the DeMille Theatre in New York. The film opened in 64 cinemas across 41 cities and eventually peaked at 485 screens. Goldfinger was temporarily banned in Israel because of Gert Fröbe's connections with the Nazi Party. The ban, however, was lifted many years later when a Jewish family publicly thanked Fröbe for protecting them from persecution during World War II.|$|E
5000|$|Mirror-image : A {{design that}} can be read when {{reflected}} in a mirror, usually as the same word or phrase both ways. Ambigrams that form different words when viewed in the mirror are also known as <b>glass</b> <b>door</b> ambigrams, {{because they can be}} printed on a <b>glass</b> <b>door</b> to be read differently when entering or exiting.|$|R
5000|$|Slightly {{less than}} two months after, a <b>glass</b> <b>door</b> at Jurong East's Jem mall {{shattered}} on the evening of Nov 29 2013. The <b>glass</b> <b>door</b> is located on the first floor next to clothing retailer H&M, a third of the glass partition shattered into smaller pieces. The mall's spokesman said no one was hurt in the accident.|$|R
60|$|He {{came to a}} full stop. He {{stared at}} the notice-plate, stared at the <b>glass</b> <b>door,</b> and turning round, stared at the over-pathetic dead soldier {{on the arm of}} his over-heroic pistol-firing comrade; Mentana--and the date! Aaron {{wondered}} what and where Mentana was. Then at last he summoned his energy, opened the <b>glass</b> <b>door,</b> and mounted the first stairs.|$|R
25|$|<b>Glass</b> <b>doors</b> {{pose the}} risk of unintentional {{collision}} if a person believes the door to be open when it is closed, or is unaware there is a door at all. This risk may be particularly pronounced with sliding <b>glass</b> <b>doors</b> because they often have large single panes which are hard to see. To prevent injury from <b>glass</b> <b>doors,</b> stickers or other types of warnings are sometimes placed on the glass surface {{to make it more}} visible. For instance, in the UK, Regulation 14 of the Workplace (Health and Safety Regulations) 1992 requires the marking of windows and <b>glass</b> <b>doors</b> to make them conspicuous. Australian Standards: AS1288 and AS2208 require <b>glass</b> <b>doors</b> to be made from laminated or toughened glass.|$|E

25|$|A {{screen door}} {{can refer to}} a hinged storm door (cold climates) or hinged screen door (warm climates) {{covering}} an exterior door; or a screened sliding door used with sliding <b>glass</b> <b>doors.</b> In any case, the screen door incorporates screen mesh to block flying insects from entering and pets and small children from exiting interior spaces, while allowing for air, light, and views. The screen door was invented in 1887 by Hannah Harger.|$|E
25|$|The small outer {{lobby is}} meant to evoke {{feelings}} of entering the outer chamber of an ancient Egyptian tomb. The walls of the outer lobby are built from huge unadorned blocks with a faux sandstone surface. The front of the ticket box office is decorated in a dusky sienna red with a golden sunburst emblazoned above the window. Past the outer lobby of the DeKalb Egyptian Theatre, through the <b>glass</b> <b>doors</b> and into the main lobby, the original mosaic-tiled floor and the towering 40 foot (12.2 m) ceiling are both revealed.|$|E
25|$|Auvinen {{then began}} pouring {{two-stroke}} engine fuel (a gasoline and oil mixture) on corridor walls and floors, {{but he was}} not able to ignite the fuel. He then went to the school canteen on the first floor and tried to enter it, but the sliding <b>glass</b> <b>doors</b> were locked. After demanding to be let in, he fired through the glass, hitting some chairs inside. People hiding in the canteen were able to escape through the other end of the room and hid in the rooms behind the kitchen. No one was hit in the canteen.|$|E
50|$|Before {{the party}} hosts could be found, Officer Hopper left the kitchen, exiting through a side door. He searched the darkened, narrow path area behind the {{home with his}} {{flashlight}} before coming upon a <b>glass</b> <b>door.</b> Behind the door stood Lee and his friend, fellow actor Jeff Denton. The two were in Denton's bedroom chatting with another actor when they saw Officer Hopper's flashlight shine through the <b>glass</b> <b>door.</b> Officer Hopper then shot through the <b>glass</b> <b>door</b> nine times, hitting Lee {{a total of four}} times, once in the head and three times in the back. Lee died at the scene. Officer Hopper later said he fired his weapon because Lee aimed his replica gun at him, and he was unaware that the gun was not real.|$|R

50|$|A sliding <b>glass</b> <b>door</b> or patio door, {{is a type}} of {{sliding door}} in {{architecture}} and construction, is a large glass window opening in a structure that provide door access from a room to the outdoors, fresh air, and copious natural light. A sliding <b>glass</b> <b>door</b> is usually considered a single unit consisting of two panel sections, one being fixed and one a being mobile to slide open. Another design, a wall sized <b>glass</b> pocket <b>door</b> has one or more panels movable and sliding into wall pockets, completely disappearing for a 'wide open' indoor-outdoor room experience.|$|R
25|$|All {{passenger}} cars were air conditioned. The passages between {{the cars were}} wide and without doors, the seat pitch of 102 (second class) and 111cm (first class) was larger than on any other German train. Furthermore, the doors were unusually wide and featured steps that deployed automatically when the doors were opened to make entry as convenient as possible, and the <b>glass</b> <b>doors</b> dividing the two major areas of the intermediate cars were opened by proximity sensors. The ICE1 was the first German train in which smokers and non-smokers were separated not into {{different parts of the}} same car, but to different cars altogether.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the house’s interior, painted Elmslie-designed stencils repeat {{along the}} upper border of walls, with designs differing {{from room to}} room. Curtains were {{originally}} painted to match the rooms’ respective stencils, or were embroidered with other designs. Windows throughout the house also feature graceful geometric patterns of clear glass, highlighted with subtle colors, which vary slightly from window to window. In the first floor living room space, these patterns echo in art <b>glass</b> <b>doors</b> of the bookcase, built into the prow. Above the mantel-less fireplace, a mural by illustrator Charles Livingston Bull depicts Louisiana herons flying before a lake scene. A wood decoration of semicircular design, decorated with art glass and sawed wood decoration, partially frames the painted scene.|$|E
25|$|The front (east) {{elevation}} {{is framed}} by two octagonal towers {{and the entire}} structure is clad in a pink-colored brick. The building's hip roof features overhanging eaves, an element common to Prairie style architecture. The entire structure rests upon a stepped, limestone water table. The main feature of the front facade, besides the octagonal towers, is the 20ft (6.10 m) X 20ft, one-story sun porch projecting from the building. The sun porch has a low-pitched hip roof with an eave that projects over the front door, which is centered {{on the porch and}} flanked by two pairs of casement windows. Above the sun porch, on the second floor, is a pair of art <b>glass</b> <b>doors</b> which open onto a balcony between the two octagonal towers.|$|E

25|$|The Fairfield Street entrance, at {{basement}} level, {{serves the}} car park, the taxi rank, and the Metrolink station. Above it at track level is a concourse {{into which the}} main entrance feeds, housing ticket offices, information points, seating, timetables, toilets, shops, and food and drink outlets. Above the concourse is a second level of food outlets and bars, and the Virgin Trains First Class Lounge. On the main concourse, <b>glass</b> <b>doors</b> within a large glass partition lead to platforms 1 to 12. A travelator leads to the upper concourse linked by a footbridge, steps and lift to platforms 13 and 14. The island lounge contains retail outlets, toilets and a departure lounge. There are vending machines, waiting areas and snack bars on platforms 13 and 14.|$|E
25|$|The 2007 Glasgow Airport {{attack was}} a {{terrorist}} ramming attack which occurred on 30 June 2007, at 15:11 BST, when a dark green Jeep Cherokee loaded with propane canisters was driven at the <b>glass</b> <b>doors</b> of the Glasgow Airport terminal and set ablaze. It was the first terrorist attack {{to take place in}} Scotland since the Lockerbie bombing in 1988. The attack took place three days after the appointment of Scottish MP Gordon Brown as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, but Downing Street dismissed suggestions of a connection. A close link was quickly established to the 2007 London car bombs the previous day. Although the doors were damaged, security bollards outside the entrance stopped the car from entering the terminal, where there were 4,000 people, with the potential for many fatalities.|$|E
25|$|After the two {{retreat to}} the chapel, Max tells Nancy that her real life {{counterpart}} is Max's mother. They bid each other a tearful farewell before Nancy sacrifices herself by luring Billy with a striptease. Max collapses, but, now the final girl, she awakens {{with the power to}} kill Billy. They fight and she eventually decapitates him with his own machete. A wounded Chris arrives and the two kiss, while Camp Bloodbath closing credits play in the sky.

25|$|The {{interior}} {{of the house was}} much smaller than the year before. The living room was brought back inside the house, with two <b>glass</b> <b>doors</b> separating it from the main floor area. On Launch Night, McCall said the room will change colour depending on what mood the housemates were in, however the walls only changed colour on eviction nights. The bedroom was across from the living room, and featured a waterbed, the bathroom was accessed through the bedroom, and featured a bath, shower and also a toilet. The kitchen was small and beside the door leading to the garden. In the garden, which was much larger than the house, was a barbecue, a pool, a seating area and a bridge titled The Bridge to Nowhere which led to another seating area. The interior stairs remained closed off once again, and had a yellow and black theme.|$|E
25|$|This {{area was}} a sacred burial {{site for the}} aliʻi (ruling class). Kekāuluohi and Kanaʻina's {{original}} home {{was similar to that}} of the other estates in the neighborhood consisting of small buildings used for different purposes. The sitting and sleeping area had a folding door entrance of green painted wood under glass upper panels. The house had two rooms separated by a festooned tent door of chintz fabric and was carpeted with hand crafted makaloa mats. In the front was a lounge area opposite a sideboard and mirror. In the middle they placed a semi circle of armchairs with a center table where the couple would write. Four matching cabinet-bookshelves with <b>glass</b> <b>doors</b> were set in each corner of the room with silk scarves hanging from each. In his book, A visit to the South Seas, in the U.S. Ship Vincennes: during the years 1829 and 1830, Charles Samuel Stewart describes the area and homes in detail.|$|E
25|$|The main chapel, {{elevated}} {{another three}} steps, is {{integrated into a}} large boulder, with two small retabular structures, dedicated to the Menino Jesus (Baby Jesus) and Senhora da Boa Morte (Our Lady of Good Death), protected by iron grades, an oratory and nativity. Over the boulder is an oratory dedicated to Nossa Senhora das Dores (Our Lady of Sorrows). To the left is a doorway access to the Chapel of the Holy Sacrement, surmounted by a relief coat-of-arms, while flanked by pilasters topped by sculptures of lions is the arcosolium and grave of Pedro do Soveral. Immediately opposite, is the small door to the sacristy, with a staircase access to the belltower.
