40|$|A {{dissertation}} {{submitted to}} the Faculty of Science, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, in fulfilment of requirements for the degree of Master of Science. Johannesburg, 30. 09. 2014. ABSTRACT In this dissertation we study {{the action of the}} one loop dilatation operator on operators with a classical dimension of order N. We consider the su(3) and su(2) sectors. The operators in the su(3) sector are constructed using three complex fields X, Y and Z, while operators in the su(2) sector are constructed from only the two complex fields Y and Z. For the operators in these sectors non-planar diagrams contribute already at the leading order in N and the planar and large N limits are distinct. Although the spectrum of anomalous dimensions in su(3) has been computed for this class of operators, previous studies have neglected certain terms which were argued to be small. After dropping these terms diagonalizing the dilatation operator reduces to diagonalizing a set of decoupled oscillators. In this dissertation we explicitly compute the terms which were neglected previously and show that diagonalizing the dilatation operator still reduces to diagonalizing a set of decoupled oscillators. In the su(2) sector the action of the one loop and the two loop dilatation operator reduces to a set of decoupled oscillators and factorizes into an action on the Z fields and an action on the Y fields. Direct computation has shown that the action on the Y fields is the same at one and two loops. In this dissertation, using the su(2) symmetry algebra as well as structural features of field theory, we give compelling evidence that the factor in the dilatation operator that acts on the Y s is given by the one loop expression, at any loop order.

40|$|Experiments were {{performed}} to determine how glycerol affects macromolecular syntheses and nucleoside triphosphate levels in a strain of Escherichia coli that lacks a functional sn-glycerol- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase. The addition of glycerol to cultures of this strain, Lin 8, growing on a gluconeogenic carbon source causes immediate growth stasis (N. R. Cozzarelli, J. P. <b>Koch,</b> <b>S.</b> Hayashi, and E. C. C. Lin, J. Bacteriol. 90 : 1325 - 1329, 1965). Immediately after the addition of glycerol to cultures of Lin 8, the syntheses of DNA, RNA, and protein are completely inhibited. Phospholipid synthesis is not inhibited as severely by glycerol. The addition of glycerol to strain Lin 8 also results in a rapid decrease in its nucleoside triphosphate levels. The total intracellular concentration of ATP in strain Lin 8 was reduced by 85 % within 30 s after the addition of glycerol. These {{results suggest that the}} glycerol-induced inhibition of growth and macromolecular syntheses may be a secondary consequence of the decreased energy supply in this strain.

Theoretical and Applied Genetics, 103, (5), 696 - 701. An F 1 hybrid (n= 4 x= 28) between the tetraploid species Festuca arundinacea var. glaucescens (GGG?G?) and a synthetic tetraploid Lolium multiflorum (LmLmLmLm) was backcrossed to diploid L. multiflorum to produce triploid (2 n= 3 x= 21) BC 1 hybrids (LmLmG). At metaphase I of meiosis the triploids had a preponderance of ring bivalents and univalents with some linear and frying-pan trivalents. Genomic in situ hybridisation (GISH) differentiated the Festuca chromosomes from Lolium and revealed that the bivalents were exclusively between Lolium homologues, while the univalents were Festuca. Despite the limited amount of homoeologous chiasmata pairing in the triploids, some recombinant chromosomes were recovered in the second backcross when the hybrids were further crossed to diploid L. multiflorum. The progeny from the second backcross was predominantly diploid. Genotypes with recombinant chromosomes and chromosome additions involving an extra Festuca chromosome were identified using GISH.

Bacteriol. 90 : 1325 – 1329. 1965. —Cells of Escherichia coli K- 12 {{can grow}} on either glycerol or l-α-glycerophosphate {{as the sole}} source of carbon and energy. The {{first step in the}} dissimilation of glycerol requires a kinase, and the initial process of utilization of l-α-glycerophosphate involves an active transport system. In either case, intracellular l-α-glycerophosphate is an intermediate whose further metabolism depends upon a dehydrogenase. When this enzyme is lost by mutation, the cells not only fail to grow on glycerol or l-α-glycerophosphate, but are subject to growth inhibition in the presence of either compound. Resistance to inhibition by glycerol can be achieved by the loss of glycerol kinase. Such cells are still susceptible to growth inhibition by l-α-glycerophosphate. Similarly, in dehydrogenase-deficient cells, immunity to exogenous l-α-glycerophosphate can be achieved by genetic blocking of the active transport system. Such cells are still sensitive to free glycerol in the growth medium. Reversal of inhibition by glycerol or l-α-glycerophosphate in cells lacking the dehydrogenase can also be brought about by the addition of glucose. Glucose achieves this effect without recourse to catabolite repression. Our results suggest that growth stasis associated with the over-accumulation of l-α-glycerophosphate is due to interference with other cellular processes by competition with physiological substrates rather than to depletion of cellular stores of adenosine triphosphate or inorganic phosphate...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{the growing}} need for high {{specific}} energy density and good cycling performance has prompted the research to develop novel electrode materials for Li-ion batteries. In this context, carbon coated ZnFe 2 O 4 (C-ZFO) has attracted increasing interest as promising new anode material {{because it offers}} an exceptional specific capacity, higher than 1000 mAh g- 1, and it is environmentally friendly, non toxic and cheap. 1 This electrode material {{has been used in}} SIRBATT project in order to investigate the evolution of Solid Electrolyte Interphase (SEI) in this anode because the performances and durability of batteries are strongly influenced by the passivation layer formed on electrode surface. 2 The electrodes have been prepared by casting the slurry containing active material, conductive carbon and carboxymethyl cellulose as binder. The electrochemical performances and the study of electrode/electrolyte interface have been investigated by galvanostatic cycles at different C-rate values, Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) at 25 °C and 50 °C and soft X-ray adsorption spectroscopy (XAS) using synchrotron radiation. The electrochemical results have shown that C-ZFO has good cycling performance, with high capacity values also at highest rates, and high stability upon cycling. Furthermore, EIS measurements have reveal that the electrode interfacial stability is more compromised at high temperatures. The XAS results have allowed to obtain important information on SEI formation and evolution upon C-ZFO electrodes.

The DNA which can restore UV mutability to a umuD 44 strain and to a umuC 122 ::Tn 5 strain of E. coli has been cloned from Salmonella typhimurium TA 1538. DNA sequence analysis indicated that the cloned DNA potentially encoded proteins with calculated molecular weights of 15, 523 and 47, 726 and was an analog of the E. coli umuDC operon. We have termed this cloned DNA the samAB (for Salmonella mutagenesis) operon and tentatively referred to the umuDC operon of S. typhimurium LT 2 (C. M. Smith, W. H. <b>Koch,</b> <b>S.</b> B.

Zinder and <b>Koch</b> (<b>S.</b> H. Zinder and M. Koch, Arch. Microbiol. 138 : 263 - 272, 1984) originally predicted, {{on the basis}} of calculations of Gibbs free energies of reactions, that the H 2 partial pressure near the midpoint of growth of the coculture should be near 4 Pa (ca. 4 × 10 − 5 atm; ca. 0. 024 μM dissolved H 2) for both organisms to be able to conserve energy for growth. H 2 partial pressures in the coculture were measured to be between 20 and 50 Pa (0. 12 to 0. 30 μM) during acetate utilization, approximately one order of magnitude higher than originally predicted. However, when ΔGf (free energy of formation) values were corrected for 60 °C by using the relationship ΔGf = ΔHf − TΔS (ΔHf is the enthalpy or heat of formation, ΔS is the entropy value, and T is the temperature in kelvins), the predicted value was near 15 Pa, in closer agreement with the experimentally determined values. The coculture also oxidized ethanol to acetate, a more thermodynamically favorable reaction than oxidation of acetate to CO 2. During ethanol oxidation, the H 2 partial pressure reached values as high as 200 Pa. Acetate was not used until after the ethanol was consumed and the H 2 partial pressure decreased to 40 to 50 Pa. After acetate utilization, H 2 partial pressures fell to approximately 10 Pa and remained there, indicating a threshold for H 2 utilization by the methanogen. Axenic cultures of the acetate-oxidizing organism were combined with pure cultures of either Methanobacterium sp. strain THF or Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum ΔH to form reconstituted acetate-oxidizing cocultures. The H 2 partial pressures measured in both of these reconstituted cocultures were similar to those measured in the original acetate-oxidizing rod coculture.

Forty plants from eleven populations coming from this area were studied. All these plants are diploids whose {{karyotype}} contains 2 n= 14 chromosomes. A karyotypic analysis of the number, {{size and shape of}} chromosomes has revealed the following: The chromosome number 2 n= 14 of this diploid is stable. The expected triploid 2 n = 21 and tetraploid 2 n = 28 were not found. The range of the size of chromosomes, from the shortest to the longest, was 8. 05 — 12. 53 pm, and standard deviation, both for the longer and the shorter arm, did not exceed 1 pm. The values, apart from the ones given, can be slightly higher or lower (i. e. the karyotype longer or shorter), however, the difference between the shortest and longest chromosome is ± 4. 5 pm. The shape of the chromosomes is metacentric and submetacentric. The former predominate over the latter and in 40 % of mitoses the karyotype formula is 12 m+ 2 sm, while in 60 % of them 10 m+ 4 sm chromosomes. In each karyotype there are two submetacentric nucleolar chromosomes, known as the »neapolitanum« type, which are not the shortest in size in the regressing series of chromosomes. The haryotype is generally very stable, which is also reflected in the normal course of meiosis. The meiotic chromosomes are bivalent, n= 7, ring-shaped and rod- shaped in metaphase I., and during the entire course of meiosis they behave regularly forming nuclei (of pollen) without chromosome fragments. In short, all the studied karyotypes of Allium subhirsutum from eleven populations of the Mediterranean region of Croatia are mainly homomorphic (uniform), stable and of a high degree of symmetry, which are preconditions for a regular, bivalent formation in meiosis.

Firstly, Göhr broke her own world record at the Olympic Day meet in East Berlin winning {{in a time}} of 10.81 s. This record lasted less than a month, however, since Ashford broke it with a 10.79 s. Both athletes were in top form leading up to the inaugural World Championships, held in Helsinki. Both Göhr and Ashford won their {{respective}} semi-finals. Unfortunately, the final was anticlimactic since Ashford tore her hamstring during the race. Göhr won the gold medal from compatriot Marita <b>Koch</b> in 10.97 <b>s,</b> and she won a second gold medal in the 4 x 100 m relay.|$|R
40|$|Nanoparticle {{technologies}} {{intended for}} human administration must {{be designed to}} interact with, and ideally leverage, a living host environment. Here, we describe smart nanosystems classified in two categories: (i) those that sense the host environment and respond and (ii) those that first prime the host environment to interact with engineered nanoparticles. Smart nanosystems {{have the potential to}} produce personalized diagnostic and therapeutic schema by using the local environment to drive material behavior and ultimately improve human health.

40|$|The CRISPR-Cas 9 system, {{naturally}} {{a defense}} mechanism in prokaryotes, has been repurposed as an RNA-guided DNA targeting platform. It {{has been widely}} used for genome editing and transcriptome modulation, and has shown great promise in correcting mutations in human genetic diseases. Off-target effects are a critical issue {{for all of these}} applications. Here we review the current status on the target specificity of the CRISPR-Cas 9 system. National Institutes of Health (U.

40|$|To develop {{immunoprophylaxis}} regimens against mother-to-child {{human immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) transmission, we established a simian-{{human immunodeficiency virus}} (SHIV) model in neonatal macaques that mimics intrapartum mucosal virus exposure (T. W. Baba, J. <b>Koch,</b> E. <b>S.</b> Mittler et al: AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses 10 : 351 - 357, 1994). We protected four neonates from oral SHIV-vpu+ challenge by ante- and postpartum treatment with a synergistic triple combination of immunoglobulin (Ig) G 1 human anti-HIV- 1 neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) (T. W. Baba, V. Liska, R. Hofmann-Lehmann et al: Nature Med 6 : 200 - 206, 2000), which recognize the CD 4 -binding site of Env, a glycosylation-dependent gp 120, or a linear gp 41 epitope. Two neonates that received only postpartum mAbs were also protected from oral SHIV-vpu+ challenge, indicating that postpartum treatment alone is sufficient. Next, we evaluated a similar mAb combination against SHIV 89. 6 P, which encodes env of primary HIV 89. 6. One of four mAb-treated neonates was protected from infection and two maintained normal CD 4 + T-cell counts. We conclude that the epitopes recognized by the three mAbs are important determinants for achieving protection. Combination immunoprophylaxis with synergistic mAbs seems promising to prevent maternal HIV- 1 transmission in humans...|$|R
