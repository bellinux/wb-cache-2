5|$|Following {{the morning}} wake up call, the crew {{began work on}} the day's tasks, which were {{centered}} on <b>inspection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> orbiter's heat shield. Using the shuttle robotic arm and the Orbiter Boom Sensor System (OBSS), the crew went through a detailed <b>inspection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> orbiter's thermal protection system (TPS) tile and Reinforced carbon-carbon (RCC) surfaces. During the inspection, engineers on the ground noticed a small area of tile on the forward area of the shuttle's right wing that appeared to have suffered some damage during ascent.|$|E
5|$|The {{goal of this}} {{approach}} is twofold: to enable deeper <b>inspection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> code at compile time to identify additional opportunities for parallel execution, and to simplify processor design and reduce energy consumption by eliminating the need for runtime scheduling circuitry.|$|E
5|$|After {{the station}} opened, Soviet protests persisted. The issue was raised at {{official}} {{visits to the}} Soviet Union by Norwegian politicians in 1966, 1967 and 1968. The Soviet Consul in Barentsburg visited Ny-Ålesund in 1968 and attempted to make inspections of the installation. On 28 August 1968, Norway and the Soviet Union agreed for a one-time, two-day Soviet <b>inspection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> station. The last protest against the installation was made in April 1969.|$|E

The Italians conducted no fewer than eighty air raids on Pola between 1915 and 1917 which undoubtedly kept the crews of her anti-aircraft guns busy.|$|E

5|$|On 22 October 1987, a fatal {{accident}} occurred {{when one of}} the old HkB 600units suffered a catastrophic failure of its braking system, and rolled down the Holmenkoll Line, finally tipping over at Midtstuen. One person was killed and four were seriously injured, leading to a safety <b>inspection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old teak cars used on the line; the HkB 600units were withdrawn from service, but were reintroduced after some refits.|$|E

5|$|On March 4, {{the autopsy}} {{indicated}} Barker had nothing in her system since some chocolate milk {{the morning of}} her disappearance, and had not eaten since she vanished. There was no indication of foul play; no signs of violence or sexual molestation. It was found she must {{have lived in the}} closet for three days without food or drink.

In 1980, a glass fibre reinforced concrete canopy was constructed over the Portway close to where it passes below the Clifton Suspension Bridge, {{in order to protect}} traffic from such rock falls.|$|E
5|$|Sixty villages (including {{the large}} {{settlement}} of Dilman, which was relocated and rebuilt as Salmas) were {{destroyed in the}} Salmas Plain and in the surrounding mountainous regions. A destructive aftershock sequence affected many villages, and in some cases, damage was inflicted on some that had escaped devastation during the mainshock. An <b>inspection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> region was undertaken, but not until decades later, at which time substantial surface faulting and other ground effects were documented.|$|E

5|$|Blame for {{the loss}} of Blücher was not placed on Hipper, but on his {{superior}} Admiral von Ingenohl, who was removed from his post on 4 February. Also on the 4th, Hipper met with the Kaiser on an <b>inspection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fleet in Wilhelmshaven. That same day, Hipper was awarded the Iron Cross by the Kaiser; on the 23rd he was presented with the Friedrich August Cross, First and Second Classes, by the Grand Duke of Oldenburg. Three days later, Hipper was informed that his hometown had named its main street Hipperstrasse (Hipper Street).|$|E
5|$|Blamey {{was always}} {{interested}} in technical innovation, and was receptive to unorthodox ideas. He {{was instrumental in the}} adoption of the periscope rifle at Gallipoli, a device which he saw during an <b>inspection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> front line. He arranged for the inventor, Lance Corporal W. C. B. Beech, to be seconded to division headquarters to develop the idea. Within a few days, the design was perfected and periscope rifles began to be used throughout the Australian trenches.|$|E

The NRC officials tell Mr. Burns that Homer's job requires college training in nuclear physics, and that he must go back to college to keep his job. Homer is rejected by every college he applies to, but Mr. Burns helps him get into Springfield University.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{separation}} burn, the crew {{set to work}} performing the standard late <b>inspection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thermal protection system of the orbiter. Using the robotic arm, McArthur, Altman, and Johnson worked through the procedures to inspect the wing leading-edge panels, reinforced carbon-carbon nose cap, and heat shield tiles. After evaluating the weather reports, managers on the ground slightly refined the schedule for landing, opting to bring the shuttle home one orbit early {{to try to avoid}} the possibility of showers that would prevent a landing on Friday. The new landing opportunity would bring the crew home at 10:01am EDT.|$|E
5|$|However, Evans {{may have}} overly {{emphasised}} a political {{interpretation of the}} sermon for his own political gain; the see of Derry had just opened and Evans wished to have his friend William Nicolson take the position. Evans' political intrigue provoked Swift during an <b>inspection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> clergy of Meath at Trim. Swift, as vicar of Laracor spoke during a synod to defend himself, his sermons, and his politics, and instead of resolving the issue, only caused more dispute between the two.|$|E
5|$|In early 1345, Kantakouzenos sent Franciscan monks to the regency to make {{an offer}} of conciliation, but it was rejected. Despite this show of confidence, the regency's {{position}} remained insecure. The defections of the previous winter had weakened their control of the capital, and in response Apokaukos launched a series of proscriptions. He also ordered {{the construction of a}} new prison to house political prisoners. On 11 June 1345, while undertaking an <b>inspection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prison unaccompanied by his bodyguard, Apokaukos was lynched by the prisoners.|$|E
