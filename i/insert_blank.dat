40|$|Dairy Research, 2006 {{is known}} as Dairy Day, 2006 A project to {{evaluate}} the degree of heat stress in individual dairies {{was carried out in}} the summer of 2005. The object of this project was to develop a method to evaluate or audit how effective an individual dairy is in manag-ing heat stress. Approximately 45 herds in 20 different states were audited for the degree of heat stress cows experienced during a 72 -hr period. Dairies were selected based on geog-raphy, climate, and facility design. Lactating cows 40 to 100 days in milk (DIM) and dry cows within 30 days of calving were evalu-ated. Vaginal temperatures of 8 cows located in the same group were collected every 5 min by using data loggers (HOBO U 12 ®) attached to a vaginally placed <b>insert</b> (<b>blank</b> CIDR®). Ambient climatic data were collected on the project dairies by using logging devices that collected temperature and relative humidity at 5 -min intervals. Census data were collected at each dairy, and included pen sizes, milking frequency, milking times, average milk pro-duction, DIM, parity, holding-pen design, and timing of cow movements. Data were im-ported into Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA) as individual cow files aligned by time. The data for an individual cow were then averaged with all other cows in the pen in hourly incre-ments over a 24 -hr period. Each hour of the 24 -hr period is then a summary of that hour on 3 consecutive days, with 8 devices contribut-ing 12 points per hour per day to the sum-mary. So each hour is a summary of 12 data points × 8 cows × 3 days, or 288 data points per hour. Information was summarized graphically in PowerPoint (Microsoft, Red-mond, WA) and presented to the individual producers, along with recommendations on how to improve their heat-stress abatement practices. The project was not designed as a controlled experiment; therefore, caution is advised in over-interpreting the results. That being said, the project does demonstrate the feasibility and usefulness of using intra-vaginal temperature recording to monitor how well a...|$|E

40|$|In metal cutting, {{spindle speed}} {{optimization}} for process stability {{is one example}} of action that may reduce production time and increase process reliability. For process stability, it is crucial to avoid regenerative vibrations and thereby enable larger cutting depth, with higher material removal rate as benefit. A spindle speed optimization is usually based on the machine tool and cutting tool assembly’s frequency response at the tool-tip. This is normally obtained by dynamic testing of the full assembly. In this paper we use a receptance coupling technique to reduce testing time by synthesizing the frequency response displacement function of the system. The method utilizes test data of the machine tool with an <b>inserted</b> <b>blank</b> tool together with a finite element representation of the real cutting tool. The coupling is made via a state space coupling technique. Comparisons are made with data from full system tests and a stability prediction is demonstrated...|$|R

40|$|We have {{proposed}} that visual narratives in comics are organized with a hierarchic narrative “grammar. ” Inspired by classic “click ” studies of syntax, we <b>inserted</b> <b>blank</b> “disruption ” panels Before, At, or After the constituent boundaries of comic strips. In self-paced viewing, Experiment 1 found that blanks After the boundary were viewed slower than Before or At the boundary. Panels immediately following blanks were slower than corresponding panels in sequences without blank panels, but only when placed Before or After the boundary. Three ordinal panel positions following the boundary, panels following blanks At the boundary or with No-Blanks were viewed faster than panels following blanks After or Before the boundary. This supports constituency because disruptions had greater impact within, as opposed to between, constituents. Using ERPs, Experiment 2 found a larger anterior negativity to blanks within constituents (Before/After) than between constituents (At). This indicates disruptions of constituents are recognized before reaching a subsequent panel. A larger P 600 appeared to blanks After the boundary than in the first constituent (Before/At). This positivity may reflect a reanalysis reflecting the inability to integrate all prior panels into a single constituent, since they are divided by the constituent boundary...|$|R

50|$|Like EGA, VGA {{supports}} having up to 512 different simultaneous {{characters on}} screen, albeit in only 8 foreground colors, by rededicating one color bit {{as the highest}} bit of the character number. The glyphs on 80×25 mode are normally made of 9×16 pixels. Users may define their own character set by loading a custom font onto the card. As character data is only eight bits wide on VGA, just as on all of its predecessors, there is usually a blank pixel column between any two horizontally adjacent glyphs. However, some characters are normally made nine bits wide by repeating their last column instead of <b>inserting</b> a <b>blank</b> column, especially those defining horizontally connected IBM box-drawing characters. This functionality is hard-wired to the character numbers C0hex to DFhex, where all horizontally connecting characters are found in code page 437 and its most common derivatives. The same column-repeating trick was already used on the older MDA hardware with its 9×14 pixel glyphs, but on VGA it can be turned off when loading a font in which those character numbers do not represent box drawing characters.|$|R
