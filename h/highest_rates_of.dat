5|$|According to the 2000 census by INEGI, Nahuatl {{is spoken}} by an {{estimated}} 1.45million people, some 198,000 (14.9%) {{of whom are}} monolingual. There are many more female than male monolinguals, and females represent nearly {{two thirds of the}} total number. The states of Guerrero and Hidalgo have the <b>highest</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> monolingual Nahuatl speakers relative to the total Nahuatl speaking population, at 24.2% and 22.6%, respectively. For most other states the percentage of monolinguals among the speakers is less than 5%. This means that in most states more than 95% of the Nahuatl speaking population are bilingual in Spanish.|$|E

A study in 2000 found that nearly 70 percent of non-pregnant women and 75 percent of pregnant women were anemic in terms of iron-deficiency.

A 2009 report by Washington Monthly ranked Shimer third in graduate Ph.D. rate among U.S. liberal-arts colleges.

5|$|TBI {{is present}} in 85% of traumatically injured children, either alone or with other injuries. The {{greatest}} number of TBIs occur in people aged 15–24.

The age groups most at risk for TBI are children ages five to nine and adults over age 80, and the <b>highest</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> death and hospitalization due to TBI are in people over age 65.

5|$|The {{likelihood}} of developing paralytic polio increases with age, {{as does the}} extent of paralysis. In children, nonparalytic meningitis {{is the most likely}} consequence of CNS involvement, and paralysis occurs in only one in 1000 cases. In adults, paralysis occurs in one in 75 cases. In children under five years of age, paralysis of one leg is most common; in adults, extensive paralysis of the chest and abdomen also affecting all four limbs—quadriplegia—is more likely. Paralysis rates also vary depending on the serotype of the infecting poliovirus; the <b>highest</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> paralysis (one in 200) are associated with poliovirus type 1, the lowest rates (one in 2,000) are associated with type 2.|$|E

All mothers and infants were reviewed postnatally with a retrospective analysis of ultrasound and clinical outcome data. RESULTS: Elevated uterine artery indices were associated with increased <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> threatened miscarriage, <b>higher</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> pre-eclampsia (PET) and a higher incidence of fetal birth weight 95 th centile for gestation was associated with statistically <b>higher</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> small-for-gestational age (SGA) infants.

5|$|Health {{indicators}} in Ratanakiri are {{the worst}} in Cambodia. Life expectancy is 39 years for men and 43 years for women. Malaria, tuberculosis, intestinal parasites, cholera, diarrhea, and vaccine-preventable diseases are endemic. Ratanakiri has very high rates of maternal and child mortality; in Ratanakiri and neighboring Mondulkiri (whose figures were combined {{in the most recent}} survey), over 10% of children die before the age of five. Ratanakiri also has the country's <b>highest</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> severe malnutrition. Ratanakiri residents' poor health can be attributed to a variety of factors, including poverty, remoteness of villages, poor quality medical services, and language and cultural barriers that prevent Khmer Loeu from obtaining medical care. The province has one referral hospital, 10 health centers, and 17 health posts. Medical equipment and supplies are minimal, and most health facilities are staffed by nurses or midwives, who are often poorly trained and irregularly paid.|$|E
5|$|The {{predominant}} tree in Yellowstone, the lodgepole pine, fared poorly from the fires, except {{in areas where}} the heat and flames were very mild. The lodgepole pine is serotinous and often produces pine cones that remain closed and will not disperse seeds unless subjected to fire. Research of test plots established after the fires indicated that the best seed dispersal occurred in areas which had experienced severe ground fires, and that seed dispersal was lowest in areas which had only minor surface burns. Regions with crown fires sometimes had the <b>highest</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> regeneration of lodgepole pine after 5years. However, the rate of lodgepole regeneration was not uniform, with some areas seeing extremely high densities of new growth while other areas had less. Stands of dead lodgepole killed by the fires may persist for decades, rising above new growth and providing habitat for birds and other wildlife.|$|E
5|$|On 9 August 2007, an Odex {{representative}} said it {{intended to}} obtain search warrants for illegally downloaded anime if necessary. The company initially believed that, unlike in other countries, mere warning letters {{would not stop}} the downloads in Singapore. Letters were sent mainly to people who had downloaded more popular series, such as Bleach, D.Gray-man, Fullmetal Alchemist and InuYasha. There was speculation from the online community that the company would collect approximately S$15million from 3,000 individuals from out-of-court settlements, but Odex responded {{that it did not}} require each of them to pay a uniform S$5,000. The main factor it considered when deciding the level of compensation to demand was the amount of downloading by each individual. Odex confirmed that more than 3,000 IP addresses had been disclosed {{as a result of the}} court orders, but estimated that the amount collected would cover less than 20% of its enforcement costs. The company's director, Peter Go, subsequently revealed that most of the compensation payments had been paid to BayTSP and to ISPs for the retrieval of their subscribers' personal data. He justified his company's actions by stating that, according to BayTSP's statistics, Singapore had one of the <b>highest</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> illegal anime downloads in the world and that Odex wanted to reduce this by 85%.|$|E
