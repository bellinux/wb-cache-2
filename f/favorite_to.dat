The Chicago Film Critics Association and the Broadcast Film Critics Association named the film the best of 1999, but while the New York Film Critics Circle, the National Society of Film Critics and the Los Angeles Film Critics Association recognized American Beauty, they gave their top awards to other films.

5|$|Before the 2003 season, both Jason Whittle and Mike Rosenthal {{left the}} Giants via free agency, leaving two {{starting}} positions {{open on the}} offensive line. By {{the start of the}} Giants' pre-season minicamp, Allen was considered the <b>favorite</b> <b>to</b> start at right tackle, but he remained in competition with four other players for the two starting roles. The newly constructed right side of the offensive line played poorly in the first preseason game against the New England Patriots, but Allen showed enough improvement the following week against the Carolina Panthers to be named the starter going into the regular season.|$|E
5|$|Borislow's most {{successful}} horse was Toccet, who won four graded stakes, including the Champagne and Hollywood Futurity in 2002.

5|$|In {{the days}} leading up to the race, Secretariat was seen as the <b>favorite</b> <b>to</b> win by many; however there were doubts about him {{following}} a third-place finish at the Wood Memorial Stakes two weeks prior to the Derby. In the wake of Secretariat's loss, Angle Light and, in particular, Sham were the horses that were seen as the most likely to win the Derby, aside from Secretariat. Many sportswriters believed that the horses in the field possessed great speed and thought the course record would be broken.|$|E
