5|$|Development of Thracia 776 started {{around the}} {{beginning}} of 1998, with the initial plan being for a compact side project to Genealogy of the <b>Holy</b> <b>War.</b> Development was also supposed to end a considerable time prior to its eventual release date, but as the game evolved, the staff {{felt the need to}} keep going and create a full Fire Emblem title. This in turn caused difficulties with keeping the game within the world of Genealogy of the <b>Holy</b> <b>War,</b> with Kaga commenting {{that it would have been}} simpler to create a completely original title if they had known how big the project would become. Characters were intentionally given little buildup or backstory, leaving their individual personalities for players to imagine. As the strategic war simulation elements of Genealogy of the <b>Holy</b> <b>War</b> had suffered due to the goal of creating an intricate story, Kaga this time switched his focus to the gameplay. The basic structure was taken from , with additional elements such as branching pathways within maps and variations in unit movement. This was achieved by giving each map a different algorithm to work with. The fatigue system was introduced to challenge players further.|$|E

5|$|In {{a feature}} {{on the five}} best Fire Emblem titles up until 2013, Chris Carter of Destructoid {{included}} Genealogy of the <b>Holy</b> <b>War</b> among them due to the many lasting features it introduced to the series. In a retrospective feature about games not released in the United Kingdom, Digital Spy's Damian McFerren {{referred to it as}} the best game in the series, decrying its exclusivity to Japan. In a different feature for RPGamer, writer Cassandra Ramos called the game the entry she most wished to see released overseas due to its scale and quality when compared to other entries from the period. Both noted that Genealogy of the <b>Holy</b> <b>War</b> was a suitable subject for a remake {{in the wake of the}} international success of more recent titles in the series.|$|E
5|$|A {{key element}} in combat since Genealogy of the <b>Holy</b> <b>War</b> is the Weapon Triangle, a system {{governing}} {{the strengths and weaknesses}} certain weapons and types of magic have against each other in a Scissors, Paper, Rock fashion. For weapons, lances are stronger than swords, swords are stronger than axes, and axes are stronger than lances. In magic, fire is stronger than wind, wind is stronger than thunder, and thunder is stronger than fire. For Fates, the Weapon Triangle relationships add other weapons in the following way: swords and tomes are stronger than axes and bows, axes and bows were stronger than lances and shuriken, lances and shuriken are stronger than swords and tomes, and so on. Several games use a Weapon Durability system: after being used a certain number of times, a character's weapon will break. Different entries have various systems related to character weapons: in Genealogy of the <b>Holy</b> <b>War,</b> weapons can be repaired at special shops; in Path of Radiance and future games, weapons can be bought and upgraded, while the durability system is replaced in Fates with a system where more powerful weapons weaken some of a wielder's stats.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the rapid}} Muslim conquests of the 7th century, the Byzantine Empire found itself {{confined}} to Asia Minor, the southern coasts of the Balkans, {{and parts of}} Italy. As Byzantium remained the Caliphate's major infidel enemy, Arab raids into Asia Minor continued throughout the 8th and 9th centuries. Over time, these expeditions, launched from bases in the Arab frontier zone on an almost annual basis, acquired a quasi-ritualized character {{as part of the}} Muslim jihad (<b>holy</b> <b>war).</b>|$|E

5|$|In 1944, Arafat {{enrolled}} in the University of King Fuad I and graduated in 1950. At university, he engaged Jews in discussion and read publications by Theodor Herzl and other prominent Zionists. By 1946 he was an Arab nationalist and began procuring weapons to be smuggled into the former British Mandate of Palestine, for use by irregulars in the Arab Higher Committee and the Army of the <b>Holy</b> <b>War</b> militias.|$|E
5|$|The Second Crusade (1147–1149) was {{the second}} major crusade {{launched}} from Europe as a Catholic ('Latin') <b>holy</b> <b>war</b> against Islam. The Second Crusade was started {{in response to the}} fall of the County of Edessa in 1144 to the forces of Zengi. The county had been founded during the First Crusade (1096–1099) by King Baldwin of Boulogne in 1098. While it was the first Crusader state to be founded, it was also the first to fall.|$|E
5|$|Development {{began in}} 1998 as a compact side project to Genealogy of the <b>Holy</b> <b>War,</b> {{although}} it eventually grew considerably in scale. Series creator Shouzou Kaga acted as designer and scenario writer, the characters {{were designed by}} Mayumi Hirota, while the music was composed by Yuka Tsujiyoko. Kaga, Hirota and Tsujiyoko would later leave Intelligent Systems to pursue independent careers, with only Tsujiyoko returning to work on future games. The game was commercially successful upon release, although {{it was one of}} the poorer selling titles in the series as a whole. It also received positive reviews from critics. No version has been released outside Japan.|$|E

5|$|Fire Emblem: Genealogy of the <b>Holy</b> <b>War</b> is a {{tactical}} role-playing {{game in which}} the player takes the roles of Sigurd and his son Seliph {{across a variety of}} story-driven missions on the continent of Jugdral. The story is divided into chapters, which are in turn divided between two generations of characters. In between missions, the player units settle in a home base, where various actions such as forging new weapons, buying items, and triggering Support conversations between different characters. Castle towns within mission maps can also be visited for similar services.|$|E
5|$|On 27 November 1095, Urban II called {{together}} the Council of Clermont in France. There, amid {{a crowd of}} thousands {{who had come to}} hear his words, he urged all present to take up arms under the banner of the Cross and launch a <b>holy</b> <b>war</b> to recover Jerusalem and the east from the 'infidel' Muslims. Indulgences were to be granted to all those {{who took part in the}} great enterprise. Many promised to carry out the Pope's command, and word of the Crusade soon spread across western Europe.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{accession}} of Heraclius, the Sassanid advance pushed {{deep into}} the Levant, occupying Damascus and Jerusalem and removing the True Cross to Ctesiphon. The counter-attack launched by Heraclius took {{on the character of}} a <b>holy</b> <b>war,</b> and an acheiropoietos image of Christ was carried as a military standard (similarly, when Constantinople was saved from a combined Avar–Sassanid–Slavic siege in 626, the victory was attributed to the icons of the Virgin that were led in procession by Patriarch Sergius about the walls of the city). In this very siege of Constantinople of the year 626, amidst the climactic Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628, the combined Avar, Sassanid, and Slavic forces unsuccessfully besieged the Byzantine capital between June and July. After this, the Sassanid army was forced to withdraw to Anatolia. The loss came just after news had reached them of yet another Byzantine victory, where Heraclius's brother Theodore scored well against the Persian general Shahin. Following this, Heraclius led an invasion into Sassanid Mesopotamia once again.|$|E

50|$|While playing less {{prominent}} roles, all Masters and Servants of the 5th <b>Holy</b> Grail <b>War</b> from Fate/stay night appear again, {{with the}} exception of Kirei Kotomine and True Assassin, as they were never destined to survive the 5th <b>Holy</b> Grail <b>War</b> (with Kotomine having been cursed with an artificial heart in the 4th <b>Holy</b> Grail <b>War</b> and Fake Assassin not being able to coexist with True assassin).|$|R
5|$|Genealogy of the <b>Holy</b> <b>War</b> {{takes place}} on the {{continent}} of Jugdral, split between eight different countries founded by the Twelve Crusaders, an ancient group of soldiers who ended {{the rule of the}} ancient dragon Loptyr with divine aid. In the present, a cult working to revive Loptyr stir up war among the countries. The story is told over two generations — the first generation follows the Grannvalian prince Sigurd, while the second follows his son Seliph as he works to defeat the cult and avenge his father. Gameplay follows the traditional Fire Emblem system of tactical battles taking place on grid-based maps, while adding the Weapons Triangle and Support systems, which directly impacted both gameplay and story.|$|E
5|$|Hundreds {{of members}} of the Bosnian Muslim SS {{divisions}} volunteered to fight in the 1948–1949 Arab–Israeli War. Many were recruited by agents of al-Husayni, who achieved political leadership of the Palestinian Arabs following the 1947–48 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine. The Syrian government also made a request for the transfer of 8,000 Bosnian Muslim refugees to Syria, many for recruitment into the Syrian Armed Forces. Iraq sent representatives to Europe and invited 2,500 Bosnian Muslims to settle in their nation. Frantzman and Culibrk estimate that approximately 1,000 former Bosnian Muslim SS members fought in Palestine, but say it is possible that Bosnian Muslim participation was much more extensive. Contemporary Haganah intelligence records suggest that up to 4,000 Bosnian Muslim volunteers took part. Many of the volunteers served in the Arab Liberation Army's Ajnaddin Battalion, as well as the Army of the <b>Holy</b> <b>War.</b>|$|E
5|$|In early 1594, the Serbs in Banat rose {{up against}} the Ottomans. The rebels had, in the {{character}} of a <b>holy</b> <b>war,</b> carried war flags with the icon of Saint Sava. The war banners were consecrated by Patriarch Jovan Kantul, and the uprising was aided by Serbian Orthodox metropolitans Rufim Njeguš of Cetinje and Visarion of Trebinje (s. 1590–1602). In response, Ottoman Grand Vizier Koca Sinan Pasha demanded that the green flag of the Prophet Muhammed be brought from Damascus to counter the Serb flag and ordered that the sarcophagus containing the relics of Saint Sava be removed from the Mileševa monastery and transferred to Belgrade via military convoy. Along the way, the Ottoman convoy killed all the people in its path as a warning to the rebels. The Ottomans publicly incinerated the relics of Saint Sava on a pyre atop the Vračar plateau on April 27, 1595, and had the ashes scattered.|$|E

5|$|In early 902, Emir Ibrahim II {{was forced}} into abdication by his subjects, through the {{intervention}} of the Abbasid caliph. Ibrahim exchanged places with Abu'l-Abbas, who was named as his successor: Abu'l-Abbas left Sicily for Ifriqiya, while Ibrahim now resolved to take up the mantle of the <b>Holy</b> <b>War,</b> and accompanied a group of volunteers to Sicily in the summer. In an act that broke the long-standing stalemate on the island, Ibrahim and his followers advanced on Taormina, defeated the Byzantine garrison before its walls and laid siege to it. Left unsupported by the imperial government, the town fell on 1 August 902. Ibrahim then capitalized on his success by sending raiding parties against various strongholds in the vicinity, forcing either their capitulation and destruction or the payment of tribute.|$|E
5|$|The Emir's {{reply was}} shrewd but frank. He noted Afghanistan's {{vulnerable}} strategic position {{between the two}} allied nations of Russia and Britain, and the difficulties of any possible Turco-German assistance to Afghanistan, especially given {{the presence of the}} Anglo-Russian East Persian Cordon. Further, he was financially vulnerable, dependent on British subsidies and institutions for his fortune and the financial welfare of his army and kingdom. The members of the mission had no immediate answers to his questions regarding strategic assistance, arms, and funds. Merely tasked to entreat the Emir to join a <b>holy</b> <b>war,</b> they did not have the authority to promise anything. Nonetheless, they expressed hopes of an alliance with Persia in the near future (a task Prince Henry of Reuss and Wilhelm Wassmuss worked on), which would help meet the Emir's needs. Although it reached no firm outcome, this first meeting has been noted by historians as being cordial, helping open communications with the Emir and allowing the mission to hope for success.|$|E
5|$|When King Henry II died in 1189, his son Richard I, who {{had spent}} most of his life in France, arrived in Portsmouth before he was crowned in London. When Richard {{returned}} from captivity in Austria in May 1194, he summoned a fleet of 100 ships and an army to the port. He granted the town a Royal charter, giving permission for an annual fifteen-day free market fair, weekly markets, and a local court to deal with minor matters, and exempted its inhabitants from paying an annual tax of £18. Richard granted the town the arms of Isaac Komnenos of Cyprus, whom he had defeated during the Third Crusade in 1191, reflecting a significant involvement of local soldiers, sailors, and vessels in the <b>holy</b> <b>war.</b> The 800 anniversary was celebrated in 1994 as the city's founding.|$|E
