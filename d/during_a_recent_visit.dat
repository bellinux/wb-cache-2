6000|$|I {{had almost}} avoided the general election, {{but some of}} its consequences, on my return, had smartly to be faced. The season, in London, began to breathe again and to flap its folded wings. Confidence, under the new Ministry, was {{understood}} to be reviving, {{and one of the}} symptoms, in a social body, was a recovery of appetite. People once more fed together, and it happened that, one Saturday night, at somebody's house, I fed with George Gravener. When the ladies left the room I moved up to where he sat and begged to congratulate him. [...] "On my election?" [...] he asked after a moment; so that I could feign, jocosely, not to have heard of that triumph and to be alluding to the rumour of a victory still more personal. I dare say I coloured however, for his political success had momentarily passed out of my mind. What was present to it was that he was to marry that beautiful girl; and yet his question made me conscious of some discomposure--I hadn't intended to put this before everything. He himself indeed ought gracefully to have done so, and I remember thinking the whole man was in this assumption that in expressing my sense of what he had won I had fixed my thoughts on his [...] "seat." [...] We straightened the matter out, and he was so much lighter in hand than I had lately seen him that his spirits might well have been fed from a twofold source. He was so good as to say that he hoped I should soon make the acquaintance of Miss Anvoy, who, with her aunt, was presently coming up to town. Lady Coxon, in the country, had been seriously unwell, and this had delayed their arrival. I told him I had heard the marriage would be a splendid one; on which, brightened and humanised by his luck, he laughed and said [...] "Do you mean for HER?" [...] When I had again explained what I meant he went on: [...] "Oh she's an American, but you'd scarcely know it; unless, perhaps," [...] he added, [...] "by her being used to more money than most girls in England, even the daughters of rich men. That wouldn't in the least do for a fellow like me, you know, if it wasn't for the great liberality of her father. He really has been most kind, and everything's quite satisfactory." [...] He added that his eldest brother had taken a tremendous fancy to her and that <b>during</b> <b>a</b> <b>recent</b> <b>visit</b> at Coldfield she had nearly won over Lady Maddock. I gathered from something he dropped later on that the free-handed gentleman beyond the seas had not made a settlement, but had given a handsome present and was apparently to be looked to, across the water, for other favours. People are simplified alike by great contentments and great yearnings, and, whether or no it was Gravener's directness that begot my own, I seem to recall that in some turn taken by our talk he almost imposed it on me as an act of decorum to ask if Miss Anvoy had also by chance expectations from her aunt. My enquiry drew out that Lady Coxon, who was the oddest of women, would have in any contingency to act under her late husband's will, which was odder still, saddling her with a mass of queer obligations complicated with queer loopholes. There were several dreary people, Coxon cousins, old maids, to whom she would have more or less to minister. Gravener laughed, without saying no, when I suggested that the young lady might come in through a loophole; then suddenly, as if he suspected my turning a lantern on him, he declared quite dryly: [...] "That's all rot--one's moved by other springs!" ...|$|E

40|$|As the {{election}} campaign gets under way, a visiting political scientist reflects on four sometimes-surprising months in the national capital One of my first and strongest impressions {{of the differences between}} Canadian and Australian politics came, of all places, in the parliamentary gift shop in Canberra. As one of the small but hearty group of people with a professional interest in Westminster parliamentary institutions, I’ve {{had the good fortune to}} make short trips to Australia over the years to conduct comparative research. But <b>during</b> <b>a</b> <b>recent</b> four-month <b>visiting</b> fellowship at ANU’s School of Politics and International Relations, I had a chance not just to compare, but also to immerse myself in observing Australians and their political system. As you might expect, Parliament House’s gift shop sells souvenir teaspoons, magnets, a collection of prime ministerial mugs, and so on. But what struck me was that it also has a remarkable selection of recent books on Australian politics, including many volumes quite critical of current occupants of the building. On sale, for example, were all of the recent books on the fall of Tony Abbott and his lieutenant Peta Credlin. A hemisphere away, Canada’s counterpart on Parliament Hill in Ottawa sticks to selling innocuous trinkets and picture books; it’s inconceivable that it would stock anything remotely vexing to either visitors or parliamentarians.

40|$|We {{report a}} unique case of transmesenteric hernia {{resulting}} in death, which went undiagnosed <b>during</b> <b>a</b> <b>recent</b> hospital <b>visit.</b> The victim was a 2. 5 -year-old girl who - {{with the exception}} of chronic constipation - had no medical history. One night she complained of abdominal pains and was taken to a pediatric hospital where doctors performed an abdominal X-ray and echography. No significant findings suggesting bowel obstruction (e. g. air-fluid levels or dilation of the bowel) were obtained on examinations and bloody feces were not observed in this particular episode. As her abdominal pain gradually attenuated, the doctor allowed her to return home. A few hours later, she lost consciousness and expired despite resuscitation efforts attempted at an emergency hospital. A subsequent autopsy revealed that the small bowel had herniated through a defect in the mesentery resulting in two consecutive and inversely forming loops, in which each loop protruded {{on either side of the}} mesentery. This rare morphological anatomy seems to have progressed in a two-step process. The girl's mild abdominal pain was likely induced by herniation and formation of the first intestinal loop, followed by severe shock occurring when the subsequent intestinal segment invaginated into the same defect forming the second loop on the opposite side of the mesentery. This case illustrates the difficulty of diagnosing transmesenteric hernia due to the presentation of unspecific symptoms; especially in infants and toddlers. Furthermore, this report demonstrates the value of a complete autopsy in cases of sudden and unexpected deaths involving children...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a problem-based learning approach to develop systems thinking and capacity building {{for a team}} of interdisciplinary mid-career professionals, engaged in management of the Cat Ba Biosphere Reserve (CBBR) in Vietnam. Following a preliminary workshop in Viet Nam in 2007, which indentified a number of crucial areas for capacity building, an integrated multi-dimensional program was designed for {{a select group of}} managers and technical officers from different levels of government and cross sections of agencies working in the CBBR. A general introduction to systems thinking concepts and tools, including causal loop modelling and Bayesian Belief Networks, was followed by skills development courses and field trips. The training courses were evaluated weekly and at the end, followed-up six months after the completion of the program, using some of the participatory methods taught <b>during</b> the course. <b>A</b> <b>recent</b> <b>visit</b> to Viet Nam and discussions with the program participants revealed significant adoption and continued practice of the tools and concepts covered in the program, as well as further applications of the concepts within the participants’ teams and areas of responsibilities.

5000|$|Blast {{fishing in}} Indonesia {{has been around}} for over 50 years and {{continues}} to transform its one-of-a-kind coral reefs into desolate gray moonscapes, as fishermen continue to use explosives or cyanide to kill or stun their prey. Dive operators and conservationists say Indonesia is not doing enough to protect the waters off the Komodo Islands. They say enforcement declined following the exit of a U.S.-based conservation group that helped fight destructive fishing practices. Coral Gardens that were among Asia's most spectacular dive sites, were the latest victim of bomb blasting despite being located inside the Komodo National Park, a 500,000-acre reserve and U.N. World Heritage Site. The use of bombs made with kerosene and fertilizer is very popular in the region. While previously Komodo was relatively protected by a cooperative undertaking with CI (Conservation International) since the Indonesian government has assumed responsibility for park protection, there has been an upsurge in bombing. <b>During</b> <b>a</b> <b>recent</b> <b>visit</b> to Crystal Boommie, it was found to be 60% destroyed, with freshly overturned coral tables proving recent bombing. [...] In the market in the city of Makassar, an estimated 10 to 40 percent of the fish are caught in this manner. The local fishermen find the technique to be easier and more productive than traditional methods. The goal for the country has been to implement stricter polices and fisheries management programs to limit the killing of the fish as well as the destruction to the marine ecosystem. Forty years ago, blast fishing was practiced with dynamite which was in plentiful supply after World War II. Today, fishermen mostly use homemade bombs that are made from bottles filled with an explosive mixture; weights are also added to make the bottle sink faster underwater. After the bomb explodes, the fish killed or stunned by the shock wave from the explosion are collected.|$|E
