50|$|A Vietnamese monochord, {{called the}} Đàn bầu, also {{functions}} with {{the scale of}} harmonics. On this instrument only the right half (from {{the view of the}} musician) of the scale is present up to the limit of the first seven overtones (see 7-limit). The dots are on the string lengths 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/5, 1/6, 1/7 of the whole stringlength. The reason for this half scale is because the left half creates the same tones as the right half when played as a <b>flageolet</b> <b>tone</b> and therefore the extra dots on the left half are useless for how this instrument is played.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a physical modeling method for synthesizing <b>flageolet</b> <b>tones</b> played on string instruments. <b>Flageolet</b> <b>tones</b> are generated when a player gently damps the vibrating string {{at a certain}} location, so that only those modes that have a nodal point at the damping location remain ringing. A physical model of the spatially damped string is implemented using a wave digital resistor connected to a digital waveguide string. Also, a commuted waveguide version is derived and analyzed. The model is able to realistically synthesize <b>flageolet</b> <b>tones</b> with both static and time-varying damping parameters. Synthesis results are presented and analyzed. 1...|$|R
50|$|On the guqin, {{the left}} {{end of the}} dotted scale is {{a mirror image of}} the right end. The {{instrument}} is played with <b>flageolet</b> <b>tones</b> (harmonics) as well as pressing the strings on the wood. The flageolets appear on the harmonic positions of the overtone series, therefore these positions are marked as the musical scale of this instrument.|$|R
5000|$|String {{instruments}} {{can also}} produce multiphonic tones when strings are divided in two pieces or {{the sound is}} somehow distorted. The Sitar has sympathetic strings which help {{to bring out the}} overtones while one is playing. The overtones are also highly important in the tanpura, the drone instrument in traditional North and South Indian music, in which loose strings tuned at octaves and fifths are plucked and designed to buzz to create sympathetic resonance and highlight the cascading sound of the overtones. Western string instruments, such as the violin, may be played close to the bridge (a technique called [...] "sul ponticello" [...] or [...] "am steg") which causes the note to split into overtones while attaining a distinctive glassy, metallic sound. Various techniques of bow pressure may also be used to bring out the overtones, as well as using string nodes to produce natural harmonics. The most well-known technique on a guitar is playing <b>flageolet</b> <b>tones</b> or using distortion effects. The Ancient Chinese instrument the Guqin contains a scale based on the knotted positions of overtones. Also the Vietnamese Đàn bầu functions on <b>flageolet</b> <b>tones.</b> Other multiphonic extended techniques used are prepared piano, prepared guitar and 3rd bridge.|$|R
5000|$|Double bass symphony parts {{sometimes}} {{indicate that}} the performer should play harmonics (also called <b>flageolet</b> <b>tones),</b> in which the bassist lightly touches the string-without pressing it onto the fingerboard in the usual fashion-in {{the location of a}} note and then plucks or bows the note. Bowed harmonics are used in contemporary music for their [...] "glassy" [...] sound. Both natural harmonics and artificial harmonics, where the thumb stops the note and the octave or other harmonic is activated by lightly touching the string at the relative node point, extend the instrument's range considerably. Natural and artificial harmonics are used a great deal in virtuoso concertos for the double bass.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} acoustical {{properties and}} proposes a sound synthesis {{model for the}} plucked stringed instrument called guqin. The guqin is an ancient Chinese musical instrument with seven strings. The strings are plucked with the right hand while the left hand pushes the strings against the top plate of the body. In the playing of the instrument, slides and <b>flageolet</b> <b>tones</b> {{are an important part}} of the expression of the instrument. The instrument disappeared almost completely during the cultural revolution, but it has began a revival and now there are already thousands of players. A database of tones was recorded in anechoic conditions. The acoustic signal analysis and the model is based on these signals. The sound synthesis model is based on the digital waveguide technique. The physical model takes into account the most vital parts of the characteristics of the instrument. 1...|$|R
5000|$|The {{following}} table {{displays the}} stop points on a stringed instrument, {{such as the}} guitar (guitar harmonics), at which gentle touching of a string will force it into a harmonic mode when vibrated. String harmonics (<b>flageolet</b> <b>tones)</b> are described as having a [...] "flutelike, silvery quality" [...] that can be highly effective as a special color or tone color (timbre) when used and heard in orchestration. It is unusual to encounter natural harmonics higher than the fifth partial on any stringed instrument except the double bass, on account of its much longer strings. Harmonics are widely used in plucked string instruments, such as acoustic guitar, electric guitar and electric bass. On an electric guitar played loudly through a guitar amplifier with distortion, harmonics are more sustained {{and can be used}} in guitar solos. In the heavy metal music lead guitar style known as shred guitar, harmonics, both natural and artificial, are widely used.|$|R
