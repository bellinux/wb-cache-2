5|$|In 1957 five round trips <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> each day, {{while the}} trains made nine round trips from Rjukan to Mæl. Rjukan station handled 100 wagons, with 800 tonnes {{potassium}} nitrate and 400 tonnes ammonia; by 1962 723,482 tonnes were transported on the Rjukan Line, 14% of the transported amount of NSB (excluding the ore trains on the Ofoten Line). In total 30 million tonnes on 1,5 million carloads were transported from 1911 to 1991.|$|E
5|$|The optimal {{crossing}} point ran over Norwegian Talc's plant, and would involve placing the western pylon {{in the middle}} of their area. The company offered the authorities free land on the condition that they received a satisfactory intersection with the bridge. A formal agreement was reached in mid-1970. On the eastern side, an area development plan <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>made,</b> which was approved on 19 May 1967. The necessary land not already owned by the municipalities was expropriated.|$|E
5|$|These trains {{originally}} had no visual passenger information systems; station announcements <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> by the train operator. An automatic audio announcement system using voice synthesizers was installed on each train by September 1994.

5|$|After {{moving through}} the Tongan islands, the {{remnants}} of Waka brought large swells, estimated up to , to the North Island of New Zealand. Thousands of residents and tourists were in the region following the New Year's holiday. Meteorologists warned that the oceans would be increasingly dangerous and advised people not to venture into the water. Every lifeguard in Whangamata, as well as former lifeguards, were called in to assist in keeping an estimated 8,000 {{people out of the}} water. Although most people stayed within a designated swimming area, several rescues <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>made.</b> Rip currents also pulled 38 people out to sea in Mount Maunganui Main Beach; all were quickly rescued by lifeguards.|$|E
5|$|By {{agreement}} among the Allied nations, in March 1942 the Pacific theatre was divided into two separate commands, {{each with its own}} commander-in-chief. The South West Pacific Area, which included Australia, Indonesia, and the Philippines came under General Douglas MacArthur as supreme commander. Most of the remainder, known as the Pacific Ocean Areas, came under Admiral Chester W. Nimitz. There was no overall commander, and no authority capable of resolving competing claims for resources, setting priorities, or shifting resources from one command to the other. Such decisions <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> on the basis of compromise, cooperation and consensus.|$|E
5|$|Condor bones {{have been}} found in Native American graves, as have condor feather headdresses. Cave {{paintings}} of condors have also been discovered. Some tribes ritually killed condors to make ceremonial clothing out of their feathers. Shamans then danced while wearing these to reach the upper and lower spiritual worlds. Whenever a shaman died, his clothes were said to be cursed, so new clothing <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> for his successor. Some scientists, such as Noel Snyder, believe that this process of making ceremonial clothing contributed to the condor's decline.|$|E

Although Glenn Robinson, Jason Terry and Abdur-Rahim combined to average 57.9 ppg and become the highest-scoring trio in the league for the 2002–03 season, the Hawks {{failed to make the}} playoffs again. With an average of 19.9 ppg and 8.4 rpg, Abdur-Rahim played in {{all but one of the}} Hawks' games. By the end of the season, Hawks General Manager Billy Knight decided major changes <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> for the franchise to move forward, and Abdur-Rahim was traded the next season.|$|E
5|$|Ironside {{arrived at}} British General Headquarters at 06:00am on 20 May, {{the same day}} that {{continental}} communications between France and Belgium was cut. When Ironside made his proposals known to Gort, Gort replied such an attack was impossible. Seven of his nine divisions were engaged on the Scheldt and even if it was possible to withdraw them, it would create a gap between the Belgians and British which the enemy could exploit and encircle the former. The BEF had been marching and fighting for nine days and was now running short of ammunition. The main effort <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> by the French to the south.|$|E
5|$|James was not {{a perfect}} {{stand-in}} for Montgomery. He had lost a finger during the First World War, so a prosthetic <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>made.</b> He had also never flown before, so the London Controlling Section's Dennis Wheatley took James up for a test flight {{to make sure he}} did not suffer from air sickness. Finally, James both drank heavily and smoked cigars, while Montgomery was a teetotaler and disliked smoking. The deception planners were worried that James might be spotted drinking, spoiling the performance. Despite these hitches, and with Montgomery's approval, the plan went forward. To get into character, James spent some time with the general, posing as a journalist, to study his mannerisms.|$|E

5|$|Marcel Pagnol's 1953 film Manon des Sources {{was four}} hours long, and {{subsequently}} cut by its distributor. The end result left Pagnol dissatisfied, {{and led him}} to retell the story as a novel. The {{first part of the}} novel, titled Jean de Florette, was an exploration of the background for the film; a prequel of sorts. Together the two volumes made up the work Pagnol called L'Eau des collines (The Water of the Hills). Berri came across Pagnol's book by chance in a hotel room, and was captivated by it. He decided that in order to do the story justice it <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> in two parts.|$|E
5|$|Minneapolis's Oak Street Cinema, a volunteer-run {{repertory}} cinema, ran films {{seven days}} per week until cutbacks in programming <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> for financial reasons. A collective of the Oak Street volunteers formed Take-Up Productions, which was established to promote showing films not typically screened in larger movie houses. The organization began with outdoor screenings, starting with Watermelon Man, which was projected against a white brick wall behind a coffee shop, {{and then began to}} rent out theaters throughout the Minneapolis–Saint Paul area, including the Riverview, Heights, and Parkway. Some screenings, such as that of Lawrence of Arabia and a series of Alfred Hitchcock films, drew hundreds of viewers.|$|E
5|$|NESCo were {{represented}} by Craig Henderson and Sydney Turner. The NESCo representatives argued {{that although the}} company already supplied around 85% of the North East region, {{a great deal more}} generating capacity would need to be built to meet the demand for years to come, and that the mid-Durham area was the best place to erect a new station. Henderson claimed the only real opposition to the scheme was that it would interfere with the amenities of Durham. John Hacking, chief engineer of the Central Electricity Board, backed NESCo because if the scheme were declined, and consent and new arrangements <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>made,</b> they would have no new plant in operation until after 1948.|$|E

5|$|No {{immediate}} {{effort was}} made to start the works and they were postponed indefinitely when World War I started. With wartime restrictions in place, construction work for the railway was prevented. Yearly extensions to the earlier E acts were granted under special wartime powers each year from 1916 until 1922, giving a final date by which compulsory purchases <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> of 7 August 1924. Although the permissions had been maintained, the UERL could not raise the money needed for the works. Construction costs had increased considerably during the war years and the returns produced by the company could not cover the cost of repaying loans.|$|E
5|$|The ideal {{solution}} was a proximity fuze inside an artillery shell, {{but there were}} numerous technical difficulties with this. The radar set <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> {{small enough to fit}} inside a shell, and its glass vacuum tubes had to first withstand the 20,000 g force of being fired from a gun, and then 500 rotations per second in flight. A special Section T of NDRC was created, chaired by Tuve, with Parsons as special assistant to Bush and liaison between NDRC and BuOrd.|$|E
5|$|The main {{mission of}} the 96th was {{patching}} Jackson Drome's runways after Japanese bombing, but they also assisted with refuelling aircraft and loading them with bombs, and unloading ships in the harbour. It was found that craters could not be repaired simply by filling the holes with rubble. This would quickly fill with water, settle, and become a bog hole. A proper repair required that the water be pumped out, and the crater filled with stone, {{which had to be}} compacted, rolled and re-surfaced. In addition to the craters, bombing sprayed fragments over the runways that could cause punctures and blowouts in airplane tyres, resulting in accidents on takeoff and landing. A visual search for fragments <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> after each bombing raid.|$|E

5|$|Although {{effects from}} Igor were {{observed}} in Bermuda for several days, relatively little rain fell, with the highest amount being 3.19in (81mm). Winds {{proved to be the}} most significant factor; sustained winds reached 91mph (146km/h) and gusts peaked at 117mph (188km/h) at an unofficial AWOS station on St. David's Lighthouse. Additionally, a storm surge of 1.75ft (0.53m) took place in St. George's, this combined with tides to produce a storm tide of over 4ft (1.22m). As the storm arrived, the island's airport was shut down earlier than originally planned due to the threat of tornadoes. Against initial fears, Igor left relatively little damage across Bermuda. The most significant impact was from downed trees and powerlines which cut power to 27,500residents. A few emergency rescues <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> during the storm but no injuries took place. The causeway-bridge connecting St. George’s Islands to the main island of Bermuda sustained minor damage, leaving one lane closed for several days. Waves over 15ft (4.6m) battered the coast, breaking several ships from their moorings and tossing them into rocks. Officials in Bermuda stated that the biggest loss from Igor would be lessened tourism revenue following a mass exodus prior to the hurricane's arrival. Throughout the islands, damage from the storm was less than $500,000.|$|E
5|$|As Southern {{states were}} subdued, {{critical}} decisions <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> {{as to their}} leadership while their administrations were re-formed. Of special importance were Tennessee and Arkansas, where Lincoln appointed Generals Andrew Johnson and Frederick Steele as military governors, respectively. In Louisiana, Lincoln ordered General Nathaniel P. Banks to promote {{a plan that would}} restore statehood when 10 percent of the voters agreed to it. Lincoln's Democratic opponents seized on these appointments to accuse him of using the military to ensure his and the Republicans' political aspirations. On the other hand, the Radicals denounced his policy as too lenient, and passed their own plan, the Wade-Davis Bill, in 1864. When Lincoln vetoed the bill, the Radicals retaliated by refusing to seat representatives elected from Louisiana, Arkansas, and Tennessee.|$|E
5|$|In 1956 growing {{diplomatic}} {{tensions in}} the Middle East, tensions that would soon culminate in the Suez Crisis, resulted in the resurrection of 69 Squadron. On April 19 the IAF issued an order reactivating the squadron at Ramat David, with Nahum Efrat as its commanding officer. The squadron was soon tasked with its first mission, allocating two B-17s for search and rescue operations during Dassault Mystère delivery flights from France to Israel. The reformed squadron once again began training personnel and equipping the aircraft for possible hostilities. As Israel purchased more jet fighters, however, room <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> for the new arrivals, and in September 1956 the IAF ordered the squadron to send its aircraft into storage and changed its status to reserve. By October 3 the aircraft had been stored at Bedek Aviation (later Israeli Aircraft Industries) at Lod, but only three weeks later, on October 25, the IAF activated the squadron once more.|$|E
