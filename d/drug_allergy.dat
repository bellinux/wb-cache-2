25|$|Fever during {{treatment}} can {{be due to}} a number of causes. It can occur as a natural effect of tuberculosis (in which case it should resolve within three weeks of starting treatment). Fever can be a result of drug resistance (but in that case the organism must be resistant to two or more of the drugs). Fever may {{be due to a}} superadded infection or additional diagnosis (patients with TB are not exempt from getting influenza and other illnesses during the course of treatment). In a few patients, the fever is due to <b>drug</b> <b>allergy.</b> The clinician must also consider the possibility that the diagnosis of TB is wrong. If the patient has been on treatment for more than two weeks and if the fever had initially settled and then come back, it is reasonable to stop all TB medication for 72 hours. If the fever persists despite stopping all TB medication, then the fever is not due to the drugs. If the fever disappears off treatment, then the drugs need to be tested individually to determine the cause. The same scheme as is used for test dosing for drug-induced hepatitis (described below) may be used. The drug most frequently implicated as causing a drug fever is RMP: details are given in the entry on rifampicin.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{investigate}} {{the nature and}} accuracy of information carried by patients about their <b>drug</b> <b>allergies.</b> SUBJECTS: 2500 new adult patients. SETTING [...] Accident and emergency department of a tertiary referral centre. METHODS: Patients were questioned about <b>drug</b> <b>allergies.</b> Where they claimed allergies, general practitioners were contacted for corroboration. RESULTS [...] 242 patients (9. 7 %) claimed 276 allergies; 32 different drugs were implicated. Penicillin was implicated most often (151 patients); 38 patients could not remember what they were allergic to; 21 described severe reactions, but four could not remember the drugs involved. Only seven patients carried evidence of their allergies. General practitioners were contacted about 240 of the drug allergies; only 114 were confirmed as described. CONCLUSIONS [...] Many patients who believe themselves to have <b>drug</b> <b>allergies</b> are poorly informed about them. Emergency prescribing for these patients may risk anaphylaxis. The future acceptance of "Smart cards"would reduce this risk. In the meantime, patients with <b>drug</b> <b>allergies</b> should be strongly encouraged to carry evidence of their allergies...|$|R

40|$|Producción CientíficaObjective The {{diagnostic}} work-up {{of a drug}} {{hypersensitivity reaction}} is indeed difficult. In general, medical documentation of allergic reactions in medical reports is usually highly deficient or non-existent. The {{aim of this study}} was to analyse the prevalence of selfreported <b>drug</b> <b>allergies</b> in the surgical population as well as the criteria used in the diagnosis of drug hypersensitivity reactions. Methods A prospective study with the consecutive participation of 1439 patients, following surgical intervention, attended the Post-Operative Care Unit. Previously, as a routine process during the pre-anesthesia consultation, all patients were questioned about whether they had any <b>drug</b> <b>allergies</b> to report and diagnostic work-up. Results The prevalence of self-reported <b>drug</b> <b>allergies</b> was 8. 3 % (119 / 1439) : 3. 6 % considered themselves allergic to b-lactams and 2. 4 % to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Approximately one-third of the subjects (40 out of the 119) had not been subjected to any allergy diagnostic procedure and with 79 (66. 4 %), the only diagnostic test used by the Allergy Unit had been the skin prick-test. None of those participating in the study had tryptase, methylhistamine, specific IgE or intradermal tests carried out to characterize the diagnosis of the allergic reaction. Conclusions These results show that self-reported <b>drug</b> <b>allergies</b> are highly prevalent and as yet little explored. It is an important prevalence which should bring about modifications to the prescription of certain medicaments. The medical personnel must be made aware of the need to make an accurate diagnosis of allergies to medicaments...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Documentation in {{the medical}} record {{facilitates}} the {{diagnosis and treatment of}} patients. Few studies have assessed the quality of outpatient medical record documentation, and to the authors' knowledge, none has conclusively determined the correlates of chart documentation. We therefore undertook the present study to measure the rates of documentation of quality of care measures in an outpatient primary care practice setting that utilizes an electronic medical record. Methods We reviewed electronic medical records from 834 patients receiving care from 167 physicians (117 internists and 50 pediatricians) at 14 sites of a multi-specialty medical group in Massachusetts. We abstracted information for five measures of medical record documentation quality: smoking history, medications, <b>drug</b> <b>allergies,</b> compliance with screening guidelines, and immunizations. From other sources we determined physicians' specialty, gender, year of medical school graduation, and self-reported time spent teaching and in patient care. Results Among internists, unadjusted rates of documentation were 96. 2 % for immunizations, 91. 6 % for medications, 88 % for compliance with screening guidelines, 61. 6 % for <b>drug</b> <b>allergies,</b> 37. 8 % for smoking history. Among pediatricians, rates were 100 % for immunizations, 84. 8 % for medications, 90. 8 % for compliance with screening guidelines, 50. 4 % for <b>drug</b> <b>allergies,</b> and 20. 4 % for smoking history. While certain physician and patient characteristics correlated with some measures of documentation quality, documentation varied depending on the measure. For example, female internists were more likely than male internists to document smoking history (odds ratio [OR], 1. 90; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 27 – 2. 83) but were less likely to document <b>drug</b> <b>allergies</b> (OR, 0. 51; 95 % CI, 0. 35 – 0. 75). Conclusions Medical record documentation varied depending on the measure, with room for improvement in most domains. A variety of characteristics correlated with medical record documentation, but no pattern emerged. Further study could lead to targeted interventions to improve documentation. </p...|$|R

50|$|Common (≥ 1% of people) adverse drug {{reactions}} {{associated with}} use of the penicillins include diarrhoea, hypersensitivity, nausea, rash, neurotoxicity, urticaria, and superinfection (including candidiasis). Infrequent adverse effects (0.1-1% of people) include fever, vomiting, erythema, dermatitis, angioedema, seizures (especially in people with epilepsy), and pseudomembranous colitis. Penicillin can also induce serum sickness or a serum sickness-like reaction in some individuals. Serum sickness is a type III hypersensitivity reaction that occurs one to three weeks after exposure to drugs including penicillin. It is not a true <b>drug</b> <b>allergy,</b> because allergies are type I hypersensitivity reactions, but repeated exposure to the offending agent can result in an anaphylactic reaction. Anaphylaxis will occur in approximately 0.01% of patients.|$|E
