500|$|Like Andrew Hanson, The A.V. Club's Noel Murray {{called the}} {{introduction}} of the First People [...] "a masterstroke {{on the part of the}} Fringe writers". Murray graded the episode with a B+, explaining it [...] "was a strange Fringe for me. The dialogue was often painfully expository, with liberal doses of ADR to make sure that we viewers didn’t miss any of the massive amounts of significant information we need to understand as the story moves forward...And yet the episode was also funky and philosophical in the way <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>my</b> Fringe to be, using the plot and even the setting to put across more than just pieces of the series’ mythology." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Bass Down Low" [...] is a electro {{song with}} skittering synths and a {{pulsating}} electropop groove. Dev utilizes her sing-talk vocal style throughout the song, but also uses her singing voice near the end. In the song's hook, she sing-talks in a [...] "deadpan" [...] delivery while remarking that [...] "If you wanna get with me, there's {{some things you}} gotta know / <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>my</b> beats fast and my bass down low." [...] According to Scott Shetler of AOL Radio, Dev entices listeners with lines such as, [...] "Straight buzzin' Robotussin / Wanna get ya mitts in my oven? / Wanna get a lick of this lovin'?" [...] The song includes a shout-out to The Black Eyed Peas while The Cataracs sing about a sexual promise: [...] "giving you that Black Eyed Peas – you know, that 'Boom Boom Pow'". Lyrically, the song speaks of various forms of , such as taking shots.|$|E

500|$|Entertainment Weeklys Tim Stack {{analyzed}} it as [...] "breathy with a propulsive beat" [...] and [...] "exactly how <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>my</b> Jsquared," [...] calling Jackson [...] "the comeback {{story of}} 2008." [...] Andy Battaglia of The A.V. Club considered it [...] "a slight digital jam" [...] which masks Jackson among [...] "uncertain vocal tones and incongruous lines about guitars." [...] IGN called Jackson's vocals a [...] "metallic mess" [...] but {{goes on to}} say that the song is saved by a [...] "mediocre hook" [...] and a [...] "fuzzy dance beat." [...] The New York Times referred to the track as [...] "blippy and propulsive," [...] stating that it offers [...] "more proof that for Ms. Jackson, sex really doesn’t sell." [...] PopMatters called it [...] "energetic" [...] and a [...] "club-ready track perfect for both Janet's celebrated choreography and flirty vocal stylings," [...] adding [...] "she opts to forgo any shock and awe moments," [...] repeating the lines, [...] "sexy, sexy, sexy" [...] to grab your interests, versus a full onslaught of visceral come on's." [...] The Boston Globe called it [...] "droid-like," [...] built on [...] "metaphors and analogies." ...|$|E
500|$|Miguel held a {{press conference}} at the Las Ventas {{building}} in Madrid, Spain on the album's launch date of 13 September 1999. Miguel confirmed that it was the first album where he was more involved in the tracks' composition. [...] "Here something special was done, probably because I had more time to write a few things," [...] he added. When asked why he opted not to record an English-language album as other Latin acts such as Enrique Iglesias and Ricky Martin had successfully done, Miguel replied: [...] "I think that Spanish is a good language. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>my</b> language and I really feel proud of it. I'm not saying that I won't do it in the future, sing in English, I mean. But it's just that it's not the right time for me. Why should I do it, just because everybody else is doing it?" [...] He was also asked about the lack of a duet with his then-girlfriend Mariah Carey to which he responded that he does not like to involve his personal life with his career. However, Miguel noted that the music he performs is based on his feelings at the time, and hinted the album's title was influenced by his relationship with Carey.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} well {{received}} by television critics. Ology writer Josh Harrison gave the episode a {{nine out of}} ten rating, and opined that the episode was a [...] "home run episode" [...] for the series. Harrison continued: [...] "Its central conflict is intense, its action is solid, and its new arrivals are engaging characters in their own right. Light on the gore and heavy on the drama—just how <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>my</b> Sunday night zombie adventures." [...] Scott Meslow from The Atlantic gave the episode a positive review, deeming it as an improvement from the previous episode, and appreciated that the episode had opened up new plot points for future episodes to come. Meslow wrote, [...] "At the bare minimum, The Walking Dead should be exciting, and the final moments of [...] "Bloodletting" [...] provides more than enough action." [...] Echoing similar sentiments, Catherine Gee of The Daily Telegraph gave the episode a 3.5 out of 5 stars, and compared it to the second season premiere, opining: [...] "It may have been a calmer episode but there was no shortage of story to chew on." [...] Joe Oesterle of Mania.com commended the opening sequence of the episode, and praised the performances of Lincoln and Bernthal. Oesterle wrote, [...] "Andrew Lincoln and Jon Bernthal [...] gave a fine bit of acting, and I found it interesting how the character Rick started looking and walking a little bit zombish after giving blood. The scenes between the two men were moving, and if you listened close you could decipher the main differences between these two cowboy cops. Rick is bound and determined to get back to his wife and let her know their son is in mortal danger, without ever doubting his own ability to successfully complete the mission, while Shane on the other hand is not quite as automatically selfless and heroic." [...] In conclusion, Oesterle gave [...] "Bloodletting" [...] a 'B' grade. Eric Goldman of IGN gave the episode an 8.5 out of ten, signaling a [...] "great" [...] response. Goldman stated that it was an improvement over the last episode, and that it had a great scare moment and cliffhanger. Similarly, Paste Josh Jackson gave the episode an 8.3 out of ten rating, signifying a [...] "commendable" [...] rating. Steve West of Cinema Blend expressed that [...] "Bloodletting" [...] was superior to the previous episode, opining that it was [...] "a character strengthening episode." [...] He continued: [...] "Even those throwaway threads are immensely important to what’s about to go down at the Green farm." ...|$|E

2500|$|Like {{the other}} players in the Heartbreakers, Campbell avoids the virtuoso {{approach}} to playing, preferring to have his work {{serve the needs of}} each song. Guitar World magazine noted [...] "there are only a handful of guitarists who can claim to have never wasted a note. Mike Campbell is certainly one of them". He is a highly melodic player, often using two or three-strings-at-a-time leads instead of the more conventional one-at-a-time approach. [...] "People have told me that my playing sounds like bagpipes," [...] he muses. [...] "I'm not exactly sure what that means." [...] His estimation of his own style is typically modest: [...] "I don't think people can really top Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton as far as lead guitar goes. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>my</b> playing to bring out the songs." [...] Like Tench, he is heavily involved in constructing the arrangements for the Heartbreakers' tunes. And also like Tench, he prefers rawness to polish in the studio and onstage.|$|E
