5|$|A priori, it is {{not clear}} whether the new local frames in free fall {{coincide}} with the reference frames in which the laws of special relativity hold—that theory is based on the propagation of light, and thus on electromagnetism, which could have a different set of preferred frames. But using different assumptions about the special-relativistic frames (such as their being earth-fixed, or in free fall), one can derive different predictions for the gravitational redshift, that is, the way in which the frequency of light shifts as the light propagates through a gravitational field (cf. below). The actual measurements show that free-falling frames are the ones in which light propagates as it does in special relativity. The generalization of this statement, namely that the laws of special relativity hold to good approximation in freely falling (and non-rotating) reference frames, is known as the Einstein equivalence principle, a crucial <b>guiding</b> <b>principle</b> for generalizing special-relativistic physics to include gravity.|$|E

To help develop and illustrate the <b>guiding</b> <b>principles</b> relevant case study examples were sought from all protected area agencies in Australia and New Zealand. The <b>guiding</b> <b>principles</b> are listed below according to whether they are applicable to visitor monitoring systems, data collection, data storage or data application.

Following this development effort, Executive Order 13514 was signed in 2009.

25|$|If the romanization {{attempts}} to transliterate the original script, the <b>guiding</b> <b>principle</b> is a one-to-one mapping of {{characters in the}} source language into the target script, with less emphasis on how the result sounds when pronounced according to the reader's language.

The WFM's labor federation, the American Labor Union had not gained significant membership. The AFL was the largest organized labor federation, and the UBRE felt isolated. When they applied to the AFL for a charter, the Scranton Declaration of 1901 was the AFL's <b>guiding</b> <b>principle.</b>|$|E

Casanova claims not to be predatory ("my <b>guiding</b> <b>principle</b> has been never to direct my attack against novices or those whose prejudices were likely to prove an obstacle"); however, his conquests did tend to be insecure or emotionally exposed women.|$|E

One <b>guiding</b> <b>principle</b> for the project was that office space for at least 25,000 federal workers must be included. Another was that, although the buildings would be modern steel frame structures, they would each be the same height and faced with limestone. The National Capital Parks and Planning Commission had the least influence over the overall design of the project, primarily because it had only recently been formed.|$|E
25|$|A notable {{exception}} to normative medieval eschatology {{is found in}} Joachim of Fiore (c. 1135–1202), a Cistercian monk, who to an extent, stressed premillennial themes. Joachim divided earth's history into three periods. He assigned each age to a particular person of the Trinity as the <b>guiding</b> <b>principle</b> of that era. The first era was the Old Testament history and was accordingly {{the age of the}} Father; the current age of the church was the age of the Son; and still in Joachim's future was the age of the Spirit. For Joachim, year 1260 was to mark {{the end of the second}} and the beginning of the third and final golden age of earth's history.|$|E
25|$|Unger's {{attempts}} to develop global social, political, and economic alternatives have led him in episodic engagements in national debates around the world. His approach in these engagements {{recognizes that the}} problems facing contemporary societies are not distinct from nation to nation, and that general structural arrangements can first be implemented, which will allow for local innovation, flexibility, and development in social, economic, and political arenas. There is no institutional blueprint for Unger, however, only a direction that can be pointed to and general proposals that can be implemented to allow further institutional innovation and experimentation. Unger's <b>guiding</b> <b>principle</b> is that institutional flexibility needs to be built into the implemented system, {{and in this way}} a diversity of local experiments would take hold the world over.|$|E

25|$|A similar {{breakdown}} {{is employed}} in environmental analysis of total economic value. Both {{costs and benefits}} can be diverse. Financial costs tend to be most thoroughly represented in cost-benefit analyses due to relatively abundant market data. The net benefits of a project may incorporate cost savings or public willingness to pay compensation (implying the public has no legal right to {{the benefits of the}} policy) or willingness to accept compensation (implying the public has a right to the benefits of the policy) for the welfare change resulting from the policy. The <b>guiding</b> <b>principle</b> of evaluating benefits is to list all (categories of) parties affected by an intervention and add the (positive or negative) value, usually monetary, that they ascribe to its effect on their welfare.|$|E
25|$|During this time, WPI {{suffered}} {{from the lack of}} a unified library system, well-maintained buildings, and national recognition. This changed under the leadership of president Harry P. Storke from 1962 to 1969. Storke brought significant change to the school in what would be known as the WPI Plan. The Plan called for the creation of three projects and drastically redesigned the curriculum to address how a student learns. The Storke administration also launched a capital campaign that resulted {{in the creation of the}} George C. Gordon Library, added residence halls, an auditorium, and a modern chemistry building. Furthermore, women were first allowed to enter WPI in February 1968. The WPI Plan is the <b>guiding</b> <b>principle</b> behind undergraduate education at the Institute today, and is arguably the most notable contribution WPI has made towards science and engineering education.|$|E
25|$|On {{the accusations}} of being docile, Mathieu writes in her {{autobiography}} {{that she and}} Johnny Stark understood each other. She {{wanted to be a}} singer, and he was tired of people who just wanted to be famous. They were both hard workers, and he kept her schedule filled with lucrative contracts. She also writes that she was forbidden to read the press, and, having peeked at some of it, was content to follow that rule. Stark, of course, had a heavy hand in manipulating the press. Mireille writes that her mother was often surprised to read on the front page that she was engaged to someone famous, or {{was going to be in}} a movie by some famous director. Her <b>guiding</b> <b>principle</b> was just to sing, and never have her family return to the tenements of Croix des Oiseaux.|$|E
