5|$|In the 2nd century, Galen of Pergamum, an anatomist, clinician, {{writer and}} philosopher, wrote the final and highly {{influential}} anatomy treatise of ancient times. He compiled <b>existing</b> <b>knowledge</b> and studied anatomy through dissection of animals. He {{was one of}} the first experimental physiologists through his vivisection experiments on animals. Galen's drawings, based mostly on dog anatomy, became effectively the only anatomical textbook for the next thousand years. His work was known to Renaissance doctors only through Islamic Golden Age medicine until it was translated from the Greek some time in the 15th century.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} of the Jovian rings was inferred from observations of the planetary radiation belts by Pioneer 11 spacecraft in 1975. In 1979 the Voyager 1 spacecraft obtained a single overexposed image of the ring system. More extensive imaging was conducted by Voyager 2 in the same year, which allowed rough determination of the ring’s structure. The superior quality of the images obtained by the Galileo orbiter between 1995 and 2003 greatly extended the <b>existing</b> <b>knowledge</b> about the Jovian rings. Ground-based observation of the rings by the Keck telescope in 1997 and 2002 and the HST in 1999 revealed the rich structure visible in back-scattered light. Images transmitted by the New Horizons spacecraft in February–March 2007 allowed observation of the fine structure in the main ring for the first time. In 2000, the Cassini spacecraft en route to Saturn conducted extensive observations of the Jovian ring system. Future missions to the Jovian system will provide additional information about the rings.|$|E

25|$|Evidence of the Higgs {{field and}} its {{properties}} {{has been extremely}} significant for many reasons. The importance of the Higgs boson is largely that {{it is able to}} be examined using <b>existing</b> <b>knowledge</b> and experimental technology, as a way to confirm and study the entire Higgs field theory. Conversely, proof that the Higgs field and boson do not exist would have also been significant.|$|E
25|$|Convergent {{thinking}} is also linked to knowledge as it involves manipulating <b>existing</b> <b>knowledge</b> {{by means of}} standard procedures. Knowledge is another important aspect of creativity. It {{is a source of}} ideas, suggests pathways to solutions, and provides criteria of effectiveness and novelty. Convergent {{thinking is}} used as a tool in creative problem solving. When an individual is using critical thinking to solve a problem they consciously use standards or probabilities to make judgments. This contrasts with divergent thinking where judgment is deferred while looking for and accepting many possible solutions.|$|E
25|$|Stories tend to {{be based}} on experiential {{learning}}, but learning from an experience is not automatic. Often a person needs to attempt {{to tell the story of}} that experience before realizing its value. In this case, it is not only the listener who learns, but the teller who also becomes aware of his or her own unique experiences and background. This process of storytelling is empowering as the teller effectively conveys ideas and, with practice, is able to demonstrate the potential of human accomplishment. Storytelling taps into <b>existing</b> <b>knowledge</b> and creates bridges both culturally and motivationally toward a solution.|$|E
40|$|Interventions {{aiming to}} promote gender {{equality}} {{are a common}} feature of global HIV/AIDS policies. To develop effective interventions, {{it is important to}} understand how globally established concepts (e. g. 'gender') are (re) interpreted and legitimated locally. This paper examines what happens when the concept of 'gender' hits the local ground in the context of an internationally funded HIV/AIDS intervention in Cambodia. Interviews with participants reveal that 'gender' is itself understood to mean equal rights. Some elements of this concept are rejected as inapplicable in Khmer society, while others are hybridised with <b>existing</b> <b>knowledges.</b> The analysis demonstrates how relational, symbolic and material dimensions of the place into which HIV/AIDS programmes intervene shape not only what 'sense' participants make of new knowledge, but also their capacity to use it. Further, the paper argues that to achieve the desired health-enhancing outcomes, international health organisations must avoid essentialising local spaces as static and 'traditional'; rather, they must attend to and build on the ambiguities of <b>existing</b> <b>knowledges</b> and the changing dynamics of the places they enter.

25|$|As an {{alternative}} to TRUEX, an extraction process using a malondiamide has been devised. The DIAMEX (DIAMideEXtraction) process {{has the advantage of}} avoiding the formation of organic waste which contains elements other than carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen. Such an organic waste can be burned without the formation of acidic gases which could contribute to acid rain (although the acidic gases could be recovered by a scrubber). The DIAMEX process is being worked on in Europe by the French CEA. The process is sufficiently mature that an industrial plant could be constructed with the <b>existing</b> <b>knowledge</b> of the process. In common with PUREX this process operates by a solvation mechanism.|$|E
25|$|The {{story behind}} this order {{involved}} the historic voyage of H.M.S. Challenger. As {{recorded in the}} manuscript of “Report on the Scientific Results of the Voyage of H.M.S. Challenger during the years 1873-1876,” the HMS Challenger embarked from Portsmouth, England in December 1872. Onboard this military vessel that had auxiliary steam power were physicists, chemists and biologists led by Captain Wyville Thomson, collaborating in an interdisciplinary venture to discover the diversity of life. With guns removed from the ships and replaced with long sampling rope, wire, thermometers, bottom samplers and water bottles, “naturalists” on board collected samples of marine organisms and fossils throughout the ocean waters. After the death of Wyville Thomson, his successor John Murray supervised the publication and research of collected data from the voyage at which point samples of radiolarians were passed onto Haeckel who was already {{a professor at the}} University of Jena, Germany. In the editorial notes of the report, Murray stated that Haeckel’s “Report on the Radiolaria collected by H.M.S. Challenger” represents Haeckel’s ten years’ devotion. In Haeckel’s report, all <b>existing</b> <b>knowledge</b> on Radiolaria was recorded, and older species and fossils were redescribed into three volumes.|$|E

500|$|In the 1996 edition (volume 2) of Lemur News, Alison Jolly {{praised the}} first edition for its [...] "contribution to {{knowledge}} in general" [...] and [...] "its effect on its intended audience."

[...] She noted the attraction of Nash's subfossil lemur reconstruction, claiming that it was [...] "rapidly {{becoming one of the}} most pirated single book illustration on the primate lecture-slide circuit." [...] Jolly went on to praise the thoroughness of the natural history information provided for each species, including recently described species, noting that the information covered <b>existing</b> <b>knowledge</b> better than any other published literature, even when only a single paragraph was provided for poorly known species. [...] The book was recommended not only for lemur specialists, but also for tourists, hoping it would spark an interest in ecotourism in impoverished Madagascar. [...] The checklist of species, as well as the information on where to most easily spot them, earned a special mention from Jolly, who could only boast seeing 30 of the 50 known species at that time. [...] Finally, the [...] "most significant and most appreciative" [...] audience Jolly mentioned was the Malagasy researchers, to whom Mittermeier reportedly gave 50 copies of the book during a workshop in 1995.|$|E

30|$|Although {{we argue}} that the Mechanistic Assessment {{measured}} participants’ level of mechanistic knowledge of the robot, {{it is possible that}} the assessment’s questions target a different construct.

However, even if the assessment did not measure mechanistic knowledge per se, it is still measuring how participants think about the robot, suggesting that readily accessing mechanistic knowledge can influence the use of <b>existing</b> math <b>knowledge.</b>|$|R
