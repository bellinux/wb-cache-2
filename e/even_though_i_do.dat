A tall and graceful old man, though stooping much from lumbago and old wounds; with snow-white hair and whiskers, delicate aquiline features, the manners of a nobleman, and the heart of a child.

Even [...] "the Boys," [...] that terrible Berserk-tribe, self-organised, self-dependent, and bound together in common iniquities and the dread of common retribution, who were in Aberalva, as all fishing towns, the torment and terror of all douce fogies, male and female,--even the Boys, I say, respected Captain Willis, so potent was the influence of his gentleness; nailed not up his shutters, nor tied fishing-lines across his doorway; tail-piped not his dog, nor sent his cat to sea on a barrel-stave; nor put live crabs into his pocket, nor dead dog-fish into his well; yea, even when judgment, too long provoked, made bare her red right hand, and the lieutenant vowed by his commission that he would send half-a-dozen of them to the treadmill, they would send up a deputation to [...] "beg Captain Willis to beg the schoolmistress to beg them off."

Willis was one of those rare natures upon whose purity no mire can cling; who pass through the furnace, and yet not even the smell of fire has passed upon them. Bred, almost born, on board a smuggling cutter, in the old war-times; then hunting, in the old coast-blockade service, the smugglers among whom he had been trained; watching the slow horrors of the Walcheren; fighting under Collingwood and Nelson, and many another valiant Captain; lounging away years of temptation on the West-Indian station, as sailing-master of a ship-of-the-line; pensioned comfortably now for many a year in his native town, he had been always the same gentle, valiant, righteous man; sober in life, strict in duty, and simple in word; a soul as transparent as crystal, and as pure. He was the oracle of Aberalva now; and even Lieutenant Brown would ask his opinion,--non-commissioned officer though he was,--in a tone which was all the more patronising, because he stood a little in awe of the old man.|$|E

40|$|This thesis can {{generally}} {{be described as}} a close reading of Schelling's treatise Über das Wesen der menschlichen Freiheit (1809) in conjunction with a limited number of references to his later work Die Weltalter. This reading, however, is neither a line by line reading of the entire text, nor is it simply an "innocent" exposition. It is informed by Heidegger's reading of this text in Schellings Abhandlung Über das Wesen der menschlichen Freiheit, and attempts to confront a specific question arising from Heidegger's reading: the question of negativity. Schelling's conception of freedom, and its relation to system, I will argue, leads to a conception of negativity which complicates, if not displaces, certain assumptions or even the entirety of modern subjectivity. <b>Even</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not argue that Heidegger inherits this problem from Schelling, the date of this lecture course (1936) suggests that it coincides with a period of radicalization in Heidegger's thought.

40|$|Roger Ames and David Hall's {{translation}} and interpretation f the Confucian classic text Zhongyong ~ Focusing the Familiar (Ames & Hall), is the most ambi-tious, most innovative, and most significant work {{in the study of}} the Zhon~ong in recent years. In this work, Ames and Hall make a processual reading of the Zhongyong. Processual readings of Chinese classics can be found in the works of numerous Chinese philosophers in the 20 th century (see FANG Dongrnei in Li, 2002, Cheng, and Tang). What is most impressive in Ames and Hall's book is their Herculean undertaking of applying their "focus and field " language in the interpretation a d translation, the extent of their effort to generate a coherent process account, and their illuminating insights into the nuances of this most philosophical of all Confucian classics. While I am sympathetic tothe general non-substantialist and non-essentialist tone of Ames and Hall's work, I disagree with their interpretation of the central theme and central argument of the Zhongyong. My thesis is that the Zhongyong's central theme is the ideal of grand harmony in the cosmos and how human beings can participate in and promote such an ideal, and that Ames and Hall have missed this central theme in their reading and have failed to highlight his ideal in their interpretation f the Zhongyong.

40|$|Present-Day English is {{generally}} assumed to possess {{only a handful}} of lexicalized reflexive verbs (absent oneself from, pride oneself on, etc.) and to use the reflexive marker neither for the marking of middle situation types nor the derivation of anticausative (decausative) verbs. Such nonreflexivizing uses of reflexive markers are widespread in other Germanic languages (cf. Germ. sich offnen 'open' intr.). Based on data drawn from the British National Corpus, Siemund (forthc.) shows that the English reflexive pronoun itself does occur as a marker of middle situation types {{as well as for the}} derivation of anticausative verbs. I will here follow up the historical development of the verbs that participate in such processes beginning with the Middle English Period. My analysis is based on a survey of the relevant verbs in the Oxford English Dictionary (ca. 200 verbs). Here, a number of interesting observations can be made: Middle English had some lexicalized reflective verbs that used a simple pronoun for reflexive marking: For to pride hym in his strengthe of body it is an heigh foyle (OED, 1386) □ to pride oneself; who so fyndeth hym out of swich fame (OED, 1386) □ to find oneself 'be, exist'. When complex reflexives replace simple pronouns in relexive contexts, this also happens in lexicalized reflexive verbs. There are various borrowings of French lexicalized reflexive verbs where the French reflexive is replaced by the English complex reflexive: you express yourselfes worthy of it (OED, 1549). We also find reflexive lexicalizations of French/Latin-based verbs in (Early) Modern English: the thought suggested itself (OED, 1751). These may also be borrowings. Alongside the processes in 1 - 3, the reflexive marker increasingly comes to be used in motion middle contexts (fling itself, position itself, etc.) and for the formation of anticausative verbs (solve itself, sell itself, etc.). These observations nicely illustrate how continuity (inertia), innovation (grammaticalization, analogical extension, lexicalization) and contact-induced change work in parallel and give rise to a rather complex synchronic picture. <b>Even</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not wish to claim that each verb has its own history, my talk is a warning against a simple reconstruction of the current synchronic situation in terms of one process alone. Moreover, the Oxford English Dictionary proves a rich and highly valuable data source that can be used for serious linguistic analyses. This conference paper is not available in ORA...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} contemplates {{the possibility}} of a relationship between democracy and the democracy to come experienced from within an inoperative community of law students. The reason for this contemplation is to ascertain to what extent lawyers and law students in particular can contribute to transformation in South Africa. With transformation I envision the ongoing questioning of well known identities, opening up the structure for discourse on new possibilities of meaning. The relationship envisioned by a democracy in waiting of the democracy to come constitutes transformation. I investigate the radical and transcendental nature of human rights and democracy, to show the potential within these concepts to encompass transformation. The nature of these concepts will however allow misuse and manipulation which will be detrimental to the pursuit of transformation and democracy to come. Due to the legal nature of human rights and their entrenchment in the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, lawyers will by means of legal interpretation be responsible for the fixture of meaning of these concepts. <b>Even</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not argue for a definite distinction, I identify two aspects which may influence the way in which lawyers perform legal interpretation: the structure of the law and the cultural aspect of the law or legal culture. The focus is on legal culture, as a form of community of lawyers. Due to the traditionally conservative approach of South African legal culture to legal interpretation, transformative constitutionalism, a project by means of which lawyers partake in social and political projects by means of legal interpretation, is hindered. I argue that the transformation of legal culture in itself can occur at the foundations of legal culture: tertiary legal education. I argue that law students serve as a community in which legal culture is founded continuously by means of confirmation, instead of critical contestation. Law students are unaware of the impact legal culture has on the way they are taught to think and argue about the law. A community of lawyers is therefore created which is unable to critically evaluate the law – a skill which is required to promote human rights and democracy in the pursuit of transformation. I argue for legal interpretation to be orientated towards the needs of the society being served and for meaning of rights and meaning in general to be relational and not individually centred. It is therefore necessary to rethink the idea of community – with regards to the community of lawyers of legal culture, but also with regards to the greater community being served by lawyers. Community in the true sense of the word is however always eluding us which space creates the hope for community. The residue? The inoperative community. The temporary nature of the getting together focuses on the only true common denominator – difference. What we have in common {{is the fact that we}} are different. Meaning can therefore only be temporary. I argue that law students can from this perspective create human rights and democracy discourse which can promote transformation.

40|$|This {{presentation}} {{is part of}} the Gender in Evolutionary Psychology track. Many feminist philosophers of science have critiqued traditional scientific method, arguing that scientific method essentializes the subject and neglects to consider the cultural factors that may be at play in describing gender, racial and cultural differences in intelligence, mating strategies and other contentious issues. By extension, evolutionary theory, particularly as it pertains to the human mind, has often been critiqued for being status quo affirming. Responses to both of these conceptual frameworks have been laced with much antagonism, and it is this dimension that I wish to explore in my submission to the Feminism, Science and Values conference. My objective here is not to provide a commentary on the value of these ideas, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> think that they have much value, and have contributed much to our understanding of sexual differences. Regardless of “who’s right and who’s wrong”, or who can contribute what to the study of gender and with what accuracy is not my concern, but rather how we can unify the two perspectives. Massive amounts of literature in social psychology tend to demonstrate the existence of an in-group and out-group bias. In-group biases are biases that encourage the individual to think more favorably about their own group, whereas out-group biases tend to collapse “outsiders” into a homogenous group, rather than considering them as individuals (Quattrone 1986). This bias is omnipresent, even when an “other group” is not available for comparison (Gaertner, Iuzzini, Orina and Witt 2006). The sense of importance and identification that one gains from their involvement with a particular group has little, if {{nothing to do with the}} aims of the group – the simple function of belonging is what matters (Tajfel 1970, Brewer 1979). This is a function that occurs regardless of the content of the group – be it feminist scholars versus evolutionary psychologists, or English students versus Cultural Studies students – differences are exaggerated, and a sense of superiority develops. Attempts to reduce this bias have involved placing an emphasis what groups of people share or have in common. This has been used in contemporary anti-racist and anti-sexist discourse to some avail (Crisp and Beck 2005), though many people, such as Taylor (2004) “We all have the same blood” ideology, saying that it subsumes real and significant differences and serves as a cover for racist beliefs. While this is useful, it is only useful to an extent in understanding the bodies of literature that feminists and evolutionary psychologists put forth. Buss (1995) observes that feminists and evolutionary psychologists report many of the same findings about our social world, and thus their observations are not all that different. I am proposing a psychoanalytic reading of the exaggerated differences between feminists and evolutionary psychologists. In addition to the social psychological research, I intend to draw on Freud’s work in Beyond the Pleasure Principle, The Ego and the Id, Group Psychology and Formation of the Ego as well as his essay, “The Taboo of Virginity”. Secondly, I intend to draw on Anna Freud’s work The Ego and Mechanisms of Defense to illuminate how and why we protect our ego from injury and how this pertains to academic debate surrounding issues of science and gender. Our desires to protect out egos from injury inhibit our ability to take in and process information in a fair manner, and this is the link that I wish to make, as it is something that I think gets annihilated in discussions of either evolutionary psychology or feminist theory: just how often basic social psychology becomes implicated in traditional “academic” objectivist and subjectivist discourses alike...|$|E
40|$|Tese de doutoramento, Estudos de Literatura e de Cultura (Teoria da Literatura), Universidade de Lisboa, Faculdade de Letras, 2014 My {{title is}} missing a {{question}} mark. The {{reason for this}} will become clearer when we {{read some of the}} poems included. For now I {{would like to say that}} the term raises the issue of the relation between aesthetic and ethics in the field of `poetry‘. At first sight, `poetic attention‘ suggests either i) a way of reading poems, or ii) a way of reading the world and beings, `poetically‘. Sense i) relates to aesthetics in that we ascribe a certain value to texts, ii) to ethics in that a sense of value or presence comes to cover things and people, or even the world in general. What value means in each case must be ascertained. Two roles are involved in each instance: in i) the reader is a critic, the writer a pharmacist; in ii) the reader is a believer, the writer an oracle. So `poetic‘ in i) mostly refers to texts, and ii) to the world; and yet the picture of inspiration (ii) means reader i) often takes poems to mediate us and the world, to capture `glimpses of the true world‘ - as icons. Poems are thus taken to speak worldish through the oracle, a special use of language that reveals world through an `attentive‘ way of reading. This thesis is mostly about inspiration as the leading myth of attention. The grammar of this myth needs investigation. Like poems, all myths are part sense part nonsense; and so, as when reading poems, getting to the sense part of the myth has a lot to do with how we read. The biggest difference between the two cases above is that of the poet as pharmacist (or in a similar sense, illusionist), which refers to the craft of poets and their skill at manipulating language. The image of the pharmacist is meant to express knowledge in creating effects. The chemist‘s formula is a precise mix of concrete ingredients (mostly words, but also other publically-understood conventions such as punctuation and spacing), which articulate in such a way that if a single chemical is withdrawn, the desired effect will not occur. From a material point of view, poems are things crafted in language. The general effect particular to words is largely called `meaning‘. What meaning means in the reading of poems has to be ascertained. Yet as with drugs, the constituency, mood and context of the particular person will determine the reaction: there is no purely mechanical reaction that can be mathematically repeated. Reactions may also be good or bad: effects are often unpredictable (the snake of the Rod of Asclepius), and have to be determined case-by-case. Pharmacists and physicians should accompany their subjects. But in poems there are only words and their effects, no guiding hands. The main questions guiding this dissertation will be: What kind of attention is poetic attention? This implies asking what constitutes each term of the expression: attention and poetry. Given that poetry is not a thing like poems are, how is poetic attention related to the understanding of discourse – and what are the traits of this understanding and of this discourse? Is it itself a discourse - and if so, then is poetic attention more of a listening or a speaking? There is a traditional picture at play here: inspiration – can this be read as a philosophically plausible model, given certain constraints? Which? And given the recurring talk of aesthetic and ethical implications in poetry, in what sense can these terms be understood in comparison to each other? I shall mostly focus on ideas about poetry - attention, language, mind, thinking - within philosophical thought. However, I will also analyze a short selection of poems, where I will be especially interested in poems that talk about language and the nature of poetry itself (as a summons to poetic attention proper). Yet it is the reading-of poems I am ultimately interested in: and within this discussion the word `poetry‘, as a pull into theories, is often symptomatic of a befuddlement. The progression of my dissertation will be that of centripetally spiraling toward the ancient conception of `logos‘, revolving backwards in time through the key themes that structure the different kinds of attention organizing the four chapters, namely: prayer and poetry (therapy, and attention to ideas and presence), contemplation and meditation (methods and attention to self), nous and logos (forms of perception and attention to beings), listening and speaking (attention to words and logos itself). Although the dissertation travels back in time, respectively moving from Christianity, Stoicism and Aristotle to Socrates and Parmenides, my intention is most certainly not that of providing an historical account of attention. Such a project would be well beyond my reach and my present scope. My effort was mostly that of trying to find similarities and differences in the key ideas and beliefs associated with the topics of attention and poetry, and how these relate (most notoriously in the myth of inspiration, whose parallel in religion is contemplation). That there is more than one use for `attention‘, however, is made visible by looking at key aspects in its changes throughout time. Also, since a dissertation is not freestyle writing, but instead presupposes writing on the shoulders of others for some common ground; I shall, for these reasons keep returning to certain structural points, by initially dropping hints that will be citationally developed as we proceed, slowly forming a part of a larger thematic body, as we spiral toward the temporal origin denoted in `logos‘. This movement is pertinent to attention, for as poems and procheiron indicate, certain texts and activities require time, repetition and going back to - if one is to read and do `well‘, and also if one is to `learn by heart‘. The key, I believe, to making `attention‘ signify in regards to inspiration (i. e. as contemplative attention, my initial problem in Ch. 1) is to show how it is, against popular belief, a form of thinking. Since I am interested in inspiration as a mode of poetic attention, I shall be talking a lot about prayer and mysticism. I feel I should briefly say something about this, for I do not take myself as being religious in any ordinary sense, even though as a child I was educated as a Christian. And neither am I of the metaphysical persuasion, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> vividly recall veering between metaphysical phases of idealism and realism as I was respectively inspired by certain authors, philosophers and poets. Styles of writing make for systematized ways of thinking, and these are `believed‘, as they affect us with their words. The world is then seen in a certain way. Yet before any such systems of thought, there is mysticism, a comprehension that mystery and wonder lie, very inexplicably, at the core of our existence. Mysticism prompts, motivates thinking of a particular kind, about the whole. I therefore want to consider religion in the sense William James defines it: `the feelings, acts and experiences of individual men in their solitude, so far as they apprehend themselves to stand in relation to whatever they may consider the divine. ‘ (VRE 31) So it is a sort of attitude towards things that I intend to consider. It is in this more indefinite region that religion matters to poetic thinking, just as prayers may share a common attitude with poems. For to think the `divine‘ also comports first of all an attitude, before it might be given a form, conceived as a sort of thing or god: `There must be something solemn, serious, and tender about any attitude which we denominate religious he divine shall mean for us only such a primal reality as the individual feels impelled to respond to solemnly and gravely, and neither by a curse nor a jest. ‘ (VRE 38) This seriousness is felt as an attitude, but comes out of thinking, out of thinking life as a whole – which means an awareness of its limits. Perfectionism is what grows within this seriousness. But ideas about life can only be beliefs; and thus can only be spoken in the mode of poetry that is allegory, myth. Death is such a belief: for it is plainly something no one can know. (To experience it is to no longer be able to tell of it.) Some poems and prayers remind us of death – and thus remind us we are alive. Some poems and prayers remind us of life and the marvel of existence by evoking the thought of the being of beings, through imagery, or thematically. And all good poetry reminds us of life by taking us back to the opposite limit of death: the origin that is language. Good poetry is about experiencing language. Making it come alive is what ´poetic attention‘ means. The linguistic turn in philosophy, namely of Wittgenstein, has brought the attention of philosophers back from ideas and theories to how we talk about things. Poems are a very interesting subject-matter in this respect, for they are precisely the language use that most cares - to the finest detail, actually - about how we say things. I am interested in poetry - the ideas we have regarding the strangely wonderful uses we submit language to, and enjoy it as – because poems (the things that generate these ideas) seem to take us back to an intimate relation with the world. Prayers do the same thing, but only for the believer: words in prayers are, generally speaking, formally drier, and only fully implicate the reader once the general picture, the form of life, they belong to has been acknowledged beforehand. Yet their goal is similar, and as such of direct interest to an understanding of the idea of poetry. It is not a question of inventing and delivering through words, but of discovering what is there. In this sense, I am a realist. So in my discussion of poetry I will not be talking about fiction, but disclosure. A discussion of language is necessary because it is the watershed where mind is born. Falta um ponto de interrogação no meu título. A razão para tal esclarecer-se-á aquando a leitura de alguns dos poemas incluídos nesta dissertação. De momento gostaria de dizer que o termo levanta a questão da relação entre estética e ética no campo da `poesia‘. Numa primeira aproximação, `atenção poética‘ sugere quer i) uma maneira de ler poemas, ou ii) uma maneira de ler o mundo e os seres ‘poeticamente‘. O sentido i) relaciona-se com a estética na medida em que atribuímos um determinado valor a textos, ii) com a ética na medida em que um sentido de valor ou de presença vem preencher coisas e pessoas, ou até o mundo em geral. Teremos de apurar o que é que este sentido de valor significa em cada caso. Cada instância implica dois papéis: em i) o leitor é um crítico, o escritor um farmacêutico; em ii) o leitor é um crente, o escritor um oráculo. Portanto, a qualificação de `poético‘ em i) refere-se sobretudo a textos, e em ii) ao mundo; ainda que o quadro de inspiração (ii) signifique que o leitor i) amiúde entende que poemas são coisas que nos mediam o mundo, que capturam ´vislumbres do mundo real‘ – sendo ícones. Nesta visão, poemas são portanto vistos como coisas que falam mundês através de oráculos, um uso especial de linguagem que revela mundo através de uma maneira ‗atenta‘ de ler. Esta tese prende-se sobretudo com a inspiração como o principal mito vinculado à ideia de atenção. A gramática deste mito requer investigação. Como poemas, todos os mitos são parte sentido parte absurdo; e assim, tal como quando lemos poemas, chegar à parte do sentido tem muito a ver com a forma como lemos. A principal diferença entre os dois casos acima mencionados é a do poeta enquanto farmacêutico (ou num sentido semelhante, ilusionista), referindo-se ao ofício dos poetas e à sua habilidade em manipular a linguagem. A imagem do poeta enquanto farmacêutico pretende expressar conhecimento na criação de efeitos. A fórmula do químico é uma mistura exacta de ingredientes concretos (sobretudo palavras, mas também outras convenções publicamente aceites, tais como a pontuação e o espaçamento), articulada de tal maneira que se um elemento químico for retirado, o efeito desejado cai por terra. Do ponto de vista material, poemas são coisas trabalhadas artesanalmente na linguagem. O tipo de efeito que as palavras têm sobre nós é amplamente designado como ‘significado‘. O que conta como significado na leitura de poemas é algo que tem de ser apurado. Contudo, tal como com drogas, a constituição, disposição e contexto de uma pessoa particular determinará a sua reacção: não há uma reacção, puramente mecânica, que possa ser matematicamente repetida. As reacções também podem ser boas ou más, pois os efeitos são frequentemente imprevisíveis (a serpente no bastão de Asclépio), e têm que ser determinados caso a caso. Os farmacêuticos e os físicos deveriam acompanhar os seus pacientes. Mas em poemas só há palavras e os seus efeitos, não há mãos que nos orientem. As principais perguntas por detrás desta dissertação são: que tipo de atenção é atenção poética? Isto implica perguntar o que constitui cada termo da expressão: atenção e poesia. Dado que a poesia não é uma coisa, como o são poemas, então como é que a atenção poética se relaciona com a compreensão do discurso – e o cariz desta compreensão e deste discurso? É ela mesma um discurso – e nesse sentido é a atenção poética mais um escutar do que um falar? Em jogo está um quadro, uma imagem bastante tradicional: a inspiração. Pode o mito da inspiração funcionar como um modelo filosoficamente plausível, dadas certas restrições? Quais? E dado o tema recorrente das implicações estéticas e éticas da poesia, em que sentido é que estes dois termos podem funcionar juntos? Para tal teremos de os comparar no contexto da poesia. Esta dissertação focará sobretudo ideias sobre poesia – atenção, linguagem, mente, o pensar – dentro do pensamento filosófico. Contudo, analisarei também uma breve selecção de poemas, dedicando essa leitura a poemas que falem sobre linguagem e sobre a natureza da poesia em si (como um chamamento à atenção poética propriamente dita). Contudo, estou fundamentalmente interessado naquilo que é a leitura de poemas; e no contexto da minha discussão, a palavra ´poesia‘, enquanto chamamento para o pensamento teórico é, na maior parte dos casos, um sintoma de confusão. A minha dissertação mover-se-á centripetamente em espiral em direcção à antiga concepção de `logos‘, voltando atrás no tempo através dos temas chave que estruturam os diferentes tipos de atenção que, por sua vez, organizam os quatro capítulos, nomeadamente: oração e poesia (terapia, e atenção a ideias e presença), contemplação e meditação (métodos e atenção ao eu), nous e logos (formas de percepção e atenção a seres), escutar e falar (atenção a palavras e a logos em si). Ainda que a progressão dos capítulos vá, respectivamente, desde o Cristianismo, Estoicismo, e Aristóteles, até Sócrates e Parmênides, a minha intenção não é de todo a de fornecer um relato histórico da atenção. Tal projecto estaria fora do meu alcance e do meu âmbito actual. Esforcei-me, sobretudo, por tentar encontrar semelhanças e diferenças entre as ideias chave e crenças associadas aos tópicos de atenção e poesia, e em como estas se relacionam (sobretudo no mito da inspiração, cujo paralelo religioso é a contemplação). O facto de que existe, no entanto, mais do que um só uso de `atenção‘ torna-se evidente ao observar como certos aspectos chave foram mudando ao longo do tempo. Para além disso, uma dissertação não é uma escrita livre, mas pressupõe escrever sobre os ombros de outros, como forma de atingir um terreno comum; por todas estas razões, irei continuamente retornar a certos pontos estruturais, começando por deixar algumas pistas que serão desenvolvidas com citações à medida que prosseguimos, progressivamente formando um corpus temático alargado, enquanto nos movemos em espiral em direcção à origem temporal denotada por `logos‘. Este movimento é pertinente para a atenção, pois como poemas e procheiron indicam, certos textos e actividades requerem tempo, repetição e um voltar a – se é que devemos ler e fazê-lo bem, se é que devemos `aprender de cor(acção) ‘. A chave, creio, para que `atenção‘ signifique a respeito de inspiração (ou seja, enquanto atenção contemplativa, o meu problema inicial do Cap. 1) é mostrar como se trata, contra a crença popular, de uma forma de pensar. Uma vez que estou interessado em inspiração como um modo de atenção poética, terei muito a dizer acerca do que é orar e misticismo. Sinto que deveria acrescentar algo sobre este assunto, pois não me considero religioso em nenhum sentido comum, ainda que tenha tido uma educação cristã quando era mais novo. Também não tenho uma inclinação metafísica, ainda que me recorde vividamente de balouçar entre fases metafísicas de idealismo e realismo, respectivamente inspirado por determinados autores, filósofos e poetas. Estilos de escrita são formas de pensar, e nestas `acreditamos‘, na medida em que nos afectam com as suas palavras. O mundo é assim visto de uma certa maneira. Mas mesmo antes de qualquer sistema de pensamento vem o misticismo, a compreensão de que o mistério e a maravilha jazem, latentes e inexplicavelmente, no centro da nossa existência. O misticismo incita, motiva um certo tipo de pensamento: sobre o todo. Irei portanto considerar a religião no sentido de William James: `os sentimentos, actos e experiências dos homens individuais na sua solidão, na medida em que se apreendem em relação àquilo que possam considerar divino. ‘ (VRE 31) O que, para os efeitos desta dissertação, me interessa na religião é uma certa atitude em relação às coisas. É nesta região mais indefinida que a religião é congénere do pensamento poético, tal como orações podem partilhar uma atitude comum com poemas. Pois pensar o `divino‘ também comporta acima de tudo uma atitude - antes de lhe ser dada uma forma, de ser concebida como uma espécie de coisa ou deus: `Deve haver algo solene, sério e afectuoso em qualquer atitude que denominemos como religiosa [...] . O divino significará para nós tão só uma tal realidade primitiva à que o indivíduo se sinta impelido a responder solene e seriamente, jamais reagindo de forma insultuosa ou com chalaças. ‘ (VRE 38) Esta seriedade é tomada como uma atitude, mas advém do pensamento, do pensar a vida como um todo – o que significa uma consciência dos seus limites. O sentimento de perfeccionismo é aquilo que cresce dentro desta seriedade. Mas ter ideias sobre a vida é ter crenças; e portanto só podem ser ditas no modo próprio à poesia, que é a alegoria, o mito. A morte corresponde a tal tipo de crença: pois é claramente algo que ninguém pode saber. (Experienciá-la é já não ser capaz de a contar.) Certos poemas e orações recordam-nos da morte – e, assim, de que estamos vivos. Certos poemas e orações recordam-nos da vida e da maravilha da existência evocando o ser dos seres através de imagens, ou tematicamente. E toda a boa poesia nos recorda da vida ao levar-nos de volta ao limite oposto da morte: à origem que é a linguagem. A boa poesia é uma experiência com a linguagem. Torná-la viva é o que significa `atenção poética‘. A viragem linguística na história da filosofia (nomeadamente com Wittgenstein) recuperou a atenção dos filósofos - trazendo-a de volta do mundo das ideias e teorias – para a forma como falamos sobre as coisas. Poemas são um caso muito interessante a este respeito, pois é o uso de linguagem onde mais importa – ao mais ínfimo detalhe - o como dizemos. Estou interessado em poesia – as ideias que temos em relação aos usos estranhamente maravilhosos a que submetemos a linguagem, e a disfrutamos como tal – porque poemas (as coisas que geram tais ideias) parecem conduzir-nos de volta a uma relação íntima com o mundo. Orações fazem o mesmo, mas apenas para o crente: neste caso as palavras são, em geral, formalmente mais secas, e apenas implicam aquele para quem o quadro geral, a forma de vida, a que estas palavras pertencem seja aceite de antemão. Ainda assim a sua meta é semelhante, e como tal de interesse directo para uma compreensão da ideia de poesia. Não se trata de inventar e outorgar através de palavras, mas de descobrir o que está lá. Neste sentido, sou um realista. Na minha discussão sobre poesia não estarei, portanto, a falar de ficção, mas de revelação. Uma discussão acerca da linguagem é necessária pois é na divisão das águas que a mente nasce...|$|E
