In this episode, a little boy mysteriously reappears after having been kidnapped for ten years. However, he has not aged one bit after his disappearance. While the case stirs up painful memories for Doggett, suspicion stirs that the boy <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>all</b> he seems.|$|E

Likewise, SOCl2 is AX3E1, but because the X substituents <b>are</b> <b>not</b> identical, the X-A-X angles <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>all</b> equal.|$|R

25|$|The 247th Guards Air Assault Regiment is a {{regiment}} of the Russian Airborne Troops, currently {{part of the}} 7th Guards Mountain Air Assault Division.

25|$|Pollen {{analysis}} has allowed archaeologists to analyze vegetation selectively cultivated by area residents, the “native vegetation” {{of a particular}} area, and allow archaeologists to map out land use over time (which can be ascertained from weeds). But collecting a suitable sample <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>all</b> that easy. Failure to collect a suitable sample can be {{due in part to}} not sampling from areas where suitable pollen samples can be gathered (e.g. lakes and bogs, sites that were sufficiently exposed to air-borne pollen, sites that had both a long exposure to air and are deeply buried into the ground), or because pollen is vulnerable to destruction by the oxidation process or soil microbes such as bacteria and fungi, it negatively impacts an archaeologist’s ability to collect a suitable pollen sample.|$|E

He believes her to be a mute, as she has not spoken since he abducted her. Later, after meeting Bi Ryu's Party she speaks slowly with future predictions, accurately predicting Yhun Ah-Rin kicking Bi Ryu. It is also known that she apparently is wanted, as a group of assassins intrude upon Bi-Ryu's party and attempt to kill them to take Nirvana. She seems to like Cho Ryung, as she hugs her like a stuffed animal a lot (She's also {{the only one who can}} understand what Cho Ryung says).

25|$|With {{health care}} {{knowledge}} growing steadily, nurses can {{stay ahead of}} the curve through continuing education. Continuing education classes and programs enable nurses to provide the best possible care to patients, advance nursing careers, and keep up with Board of Nursing requirements. The American Nurses Association and the American Nursing Credentialing Center are devoted to ensuring nurses have access to quality continuing education offerings. Continuing education classes are calibrated to provide enhanced learning for all levels of nurses. Many States also regulate Continuing Nursing Education. Nursing licensing boards requiring Continuing Nursing Education (CNE) as a condition for licensure, either initial or renewal, accept courses provided by organizations that are accredited by other state licensing boards, by the American Nursing Credentialing Center (ANCC), or by organizations that have been designated as an approver of continuing nursing education by ANCC. There are some exceptions to this rule including the state of California, Florida and Kentucky. National Healthcare Institute has created a list to assist nurses in determining their CNE credit hours requirements. While this list <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>all</b> inclusive, it offers details on how to contact nursing licensing boards directly.|$|E
25|$|It is {{sometimes}} claimed that as {{with some other}} seabirds (e.g. the flightless Plotopteridae), the evolutionary radiation of cetaceans and pinnipeds outcompeted the pseudotooth birds and drove them into extinction. While this may be correct for the plotopterids, for pelagornithids it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>all</b> too likely for two reasons: First, the Pelagornithidae continued to thrive for 10 million years after modern-type baleen whales evolved, and in the Middle Miocene Pelagornis coexisted with Aglaocetus and Harrison's whale (Eobalaenoptera harrisoni) in the Atlantic off the Eastern Seaboard, while the Pacific Osteodontornis inhabited the same seas as Balaenula and Morenocetus; the ancestral smallish sperm whale genus Aulophyseter (and/or Orycterocetus) occurred in both Northern Hemisphere oceans at that time, while the mid-sized sperm whale Brygmophyseter roamed the North Pacific. As regards Miocene pinnipeds, a diversity of ancient walruses and ancestral fur seals like Thalassoleon inhabited the north-east, while the ancient leopard seal Acrophoca is a remarkable species known from the south-east Pacific. Secondly, pinnipeds are limited to near-shore waters while pseudotooth birds roamed the seas far and wide, like large cetaceans, and like all big carnivores all three groups were K-strategists with moderate to very low population densities.|$|E

[...] The song continues the album's theme of honesty and self-acceptance, both about pornography and musical tastes.

500|$|Chapter VI {{begins by}} saying the next three {{chapters}} will address possible objections to the theory, the first being that often no intermediate forms between closely related species are found, though the theory implies such forms must have existed.

[...] Why <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>all</b> nature in confusion, instead of the species being, as we see them, well defined?" [...] Darwin attributed this to the competition between different forms, combined with {{the small number of}} individuals of intermediate forms, often leading to extinction of such forms. This difficulty can be referred to as the absence or rarity of transitional varieties in habitat space.|$|E

500|$|The cold opening {{references}} several notable {{bands and}} musicians: the scene consists of Ryan complaining because he recently heard—erroneously—that notable musician Smokey Robinson died. Initially, Ryan refers {{to him as}} only [...] "Smokey", which causes Pam to believe {{he is talking about}} Smokey the Bear. However, Ryan, on the bequest of Pam, is only able to name one song that Robinson sung, [...] "The Tracks of My Tears". Pam, however, is later able to remember that he sang [...] "Tears of a Clown", and Jim references [...] "I Second That Emotion". After Jim proves that Robinson is both still alive and playing at a local venue, Ryan tells him that he will be unable to attend because the opening band is Paul Anka, and that is [...] "not what Smokey would have… does want!" [...] During his pontificating rant, Ryan mentions that popular music <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>all</b> about [...] "Jason Mraz and The Beatles", which shocks Dwight. Dwight lists of [...] "Eleanor Rigby" [...] and [...] "Paperback Writer" [...] and asks Ryan if he truly does not like those songs.|$|E
500|$|The review {{received}} barely a sentence from Walton of The Moving Picture News who stated it was: [...] "Good from A to Z." [...] The Moving Picture World offers little more, highlighting {{that the film}} would please children and offered a brief summary devoid of criticism or praise. The New York Dramatic Mirror gave a much more substantial treatment of the subject and stated, [...] "This film, intended for juvenile patrons, has yet a charm for older spectators as well, because it tells a pretty story in a pretty way. ... The narrative is frankly impossible in plot, but that makes it no less entertaining to the youthful. A little make-believe is relished by the best of men. The acting of the wee heroine is really wonderful; it is spontaneous, lively, resourceful, graceful, and charming. The part of the rich girl, however, although it is capitally played, should have been entrusted to a smaller, if not to a younger, woman. The size of the actress makes the film look bizarre. The scenery <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>all</b> that might be desired, still it is passable."
