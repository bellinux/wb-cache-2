50|$|Both the Classic 350 and the Classic 500 {{feature the}} new unit {{construction}} engine in their 350cc and 500cc variants respectively. However the Classic 350 uses a carburettor for fuel delivery and the Classic 500 has EFI. Also the Classic 350 has an ammeter while the Classic 500 {{has a low}} fuel indicator light and <b>engine</b> <b>check</b> <b>light</b> instead of the ammeter. The ammeter on the Classic 350 {{is more of a}} vestigial remain as the modern Classic 350 has no practical use for it. In the older models with CB points, when the piston was in the top dead centre (CB Points closed) then the ammeter would stay in the middle. This feature allowed the rider to use the decompresson lever to move the piston to top dead center and kick starter with relative ease. Both of these models are more expensive and targeted at a market segment above the Royal Enfield Bullet 350 and the Bullet 500.|$|E

5000|$|The Enhanced Traction System is an all-speed engine based {{traction}} control system used by General Motors Corporation in many of their automobile models. In some models, the driver has the option to disable this system by pushing a button marked [...] "ETS". The system uses sensors to monitor wheelspin and reduces engine speed, upshifts or retards ignition timing to improve traction. The Button is usually located on the gearshift and locks off when the <b>check</b> <b>engine</b> <b>light</b> comes on for any other reason.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{vehicles}} had {{a single}} indicator labeled [...] or {{this was not a}} <b>Check</b> <b>Engine</b> <b>Light,</b> but a catch-all warning light to indicate trouble that was serious enough to portend an imminent breakdown. Early 1980s Fords, such as the LTD Crown Victoria, without the instrument option, had only this light, which indicated low oil pressure, overheating and carburetion problems without distinguishing among them. This usage of the [...] "engine" [...] light was discontinued in the mid-1980s to prevent confusion with the MIL.|$|R
50|$|On November 9, 2011, Toyota {{announced}} a recall of 550,000 vehicles (447,000 in the U.S., 38,000 in Japan, and 25,000 in Australia and New Zealand) worldwide; the recall affects MY 2004-2005 Camry, Highlander, Sienna and Solara, MY 2004 Avalon, MY 2006 Highlander HV, MY 2004-2005 Lexus ES330 and RX330 and MY 2006 RX400h. The recall concerns a steering problem {{caused by the}} misalignment of {{the inner and outer}} rings of the crankshaft pulley, which could cause a noise or the <b>Check</b> <b>Engine</b> <b>light</b> to illuminate; if this problem is not corrected, the power steering belt can fall off the pulley, which can cause a sudden loss of power assist.|$|R
50|$|Due to the inordinate {{number of}} pre-2010 OM642 engines needing repair due to heat-related seal {{degradation}} causing oil cooler leaks, Mercedes reformulated the seals from an orange color rubber to a purple color Viton seal now used in all 2010 and later engines. There is a Mercedes Technical Service Bulletin that {{states that the}} leak {{can be attributed to}} an improperly installed seal. This engine also has an inherent design flaw with the TWC temperature sensor (part no. A005 153 40 28) and the part in the electronic parts catalog is now specifying part no. A007 153 74 28; there is no recall on this service item yet. A <b>check</b> <b>engine</b> <b>light</b> may present with the OBD-2 diagnostic code P2031 upon failure of this sensor.|$|R
50|$|A {{recurring}} theme is Penny's poor driving. She fails to service her vehicle regularly, and ignores her <b>check</b> <b>engine</b> <b>light,</b> {{which has been}} mentioned in multiple episodes. She once left her car's passenger side wing mirror {{in a parking lot}}. She once hit a Mercedes in a parking lot and left without leaving a note. She also inadvertently reveals that she knocked the mirror off Bernadette's car and did not leave a note. When her car's engine finally fails in Season 7, Leonard buys her a new one so she can go to auditions and pursue her dream of becoming an actress. In Season 8, after finding a job as a highly paid pharmaceutical sales representative at Bernadette's company, she obtains a company car and sells the one Leonard bought for her, returning him the money.|$|R
5000|$|M272 {{engines that}} were sold between 2004 and 2008 with engine serial numbers below 2729..30 468993 often show early wear {{of the balance}} shaft gears, {{requiring}} extensive repairs at a retail cost of over $4000. [...] These complaints led to a class action lawsuit against Mercedes-Benz (Greg Suddreth and Paul Dunton v. Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC), which alleged the M272 engines are equipped with defective balance shafts gears which [...] "wear out prematurely, excessively and without warning, purportedly causing the vehicles to malfunction, the <b>check</b> <b>engine</b> <b>light</b> to illuminate and the vehicle to misfire and/or stop driving." [...] The suit further alleged that Mercedes knew of this problem, sending out repair bulletins on how {{to address this issue}} and ultimately changing the balance shaft gears to avoid this problem. This suit was ultimately dismissed with the judge agreeing with Mercedes that because the gears fail at 60 -80K miles and outside of the warranty period, Mercedes is not legally responsible for these problems.|$|R
50|$|There {{also some}} {{alternative}} {{options in the}} way of interceptors like # Unichip that clamp the various inputs to the standard management systems, but they are restricted by the fact that fuel delivery generally cannot be easily increased as manipulation of the air-flow meter input and/or aggressive modifying of the ignition timing causes the <b>Check</b> <b>Engine</b> <b>Light</b> (CEL) to illuminate easily due to a deviation between the expected and targeted torque and quality of emissions.It is therefore common to increase the fuel pressure across the board by using an aftermarket fuel pressure regulator when tuning is performed by these interceptor computers, and trim the fuel out instead. However, increased fuel pressure has the side-effect of affecting the engine's ability to idle due to injector lockup, and as such sometimes an alternative solution of additional injectors instead of a raised-fuel-pressure regulator is proposed.The number of cars with such complex requirements is very low, and in general a full aftermarket engine management system is used in these cases, such as Nira or MoTeC.|$|R
5000|$|Base D100 {{models were}} added for 1984, {{replacing}} the previous [...] "Miser" [...] trim level {{available on the}} D150. A [...] "Ram-Trac" [...] shift-on-the-fly transfer case was added for the 1985's Power Rams, and both the crew cab and Utiline flared bed were dropped for 1986. In 1988 the Slant-6 engine {{was replaced by a}} 3.9 L fuel-injected V6 engine. The 318 cuin L engine also received electronic fuel injection in 1988. Because of a new computer controlled fuel injection, ignition and ABS system, more vehicle information needed to be displayed through any warning or notification lights; so inside the cab where a small compartment was once located on the dash, a new [...] "message center" [...] with four small rectangular light spots, contained the <b>check</b> <b>engine</b> <b>light</b> and other tell-tales including one for the parking brake and the ABS if the truck was so equipped. The message center later contained [...] "wait to start" [...] and [...] "water in fuel" [...] lights on diesel models. Diagnostic fault codes were stored in the computer's memory, and cycling the ignition key three times would allow the computer to flash the trouble codes through the check-engine light for diagnosis of some problems.|$|R

50|$|Non {{contact type}} TPS {{work on the}} {{principle}} of Hall effect or Inductive sensors, or magnetoresistive technologies, wherein generally the magnet or inductive loop is the dynamic part which is mounted on the butterfly valve throttle spindle/shaft gear and the sensor & signal processing circuit board is mounted within the ETC gear box cover and is stationary. When the magnet/inductive loop mounted on the spindle which is rotated from the lower mechanical stop to WOT, there is a change in the magnetic field for the sensor. The change in the magnetic field is sensed by the sensor and the voltage generated is given as the input to the ECU. Normally a two pole rare earth magnet is used for the TPS due to their high Curie temperatures required in the under-hood vehicle environment. The magnet may be of diametrical type, ring type, rectangular or segment type. The magnet is defined to have a certain magnetic field that does not vary significantly with time or temperature.In case of failure of the TPS operation the <b>CHECK</b> <b>ENGINE</b> <b>light</b> remains illuminated even if there is no problem or error in the ECU. It cannot be corrected by clearing ECU errors by running diagnostic software. In order to rectify the malfunction the TPS needs {{to be replaced by a}} new one.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the oil cooler seals; this engine can also have an issue with {{the design of the}} positive crankcase ventilation system. The crankcase ventilation system vents to the inlet of the turbo. The issue is that the air vented from the crankcase contains too much oil to easily pass through the swirl motor valves downstream of the turbo. Once this oil and sludge begin to accumulate, the valve becomes inoperative and blows a fuse that controls many other sensors required to properly operate the engine and emission system. This will immediately place the vehicle into limp home mode and limit the rpm to 3000. It also causes a <b>check</b> <b>engine</b> <b>light</b> and numerous OBDII Codes. Mercedes Benz has previously recognized this feature of the vehicle and has stated that this engine feature, the accumulation of oil at the turbo inlet, is [...] "normal". In a Technical Service Bulletin they issued in 2008 they state:"Engine oil venting occurs on the right hand side of the engine air intake duct. For this reason there is always some oil in the engine air intake duct, see (Figure 3). This is no justification for replacing the turbocharger. Turbochargers replaced for this reason will not be covered by warranty." [...] While a slight amount of oil may be normal and acceptable, sufficient quantities and accumulation will indeed lead to other failures as identified above.|$|R
5000|$|The 1981 {{model was}} nearly {{unchanged}} from 1980 {{and would be}} the last model year for the second-generation Camaro. The Z28 was still powered by a 350 CID L V8, however due to new emissions regulations the engine was now equipped with a CCC (Computer Command Control) unit for the first time. This predecessor to modern engine control modules had an oxygen sensor, an electronically controlled carburetor, a throttle position sensor, coolant sensors, a barometric pressure sensor, a Manifold Absolute Pressure sensor (MAP), and a <b>check</b> <b>engine</b> <b>light</b> on the dash. The transmission was now equipped with a lockup torque converter, controlled by the CCC as well. The CCC could also be used as a self-diagnostic tool. However, as the goal of this change was strictly emissions reduction, horsepower dropped to [...] This engine was now only available with an automatic transmission, while the four-speed manual versions had the [...] 305 CID L, which was the only engine offered in Z28s sold in California. Canadian models, however, could still get the 350 and 4-speed combination, and were not equipped with a CCC. Canadian 1981 Camaros were thus identical to 1980 US model. RS models were dropped this year, but the RS designation would reappear in 1989. Total production had dropped down to 126,139 from a high of 282,571 in 1979.|$|R
