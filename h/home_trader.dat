50|$|In {{spite of}} all its glorious {{achievements}} in arts and architecture, the empire was essentially a war administration. Every aspect of the governance indicated its sole purpose, that of repulsing Muslim invasion. As the kingdom expanded, it maintained local traditions in areas annexed into the empire. Thus as a whole, the Hoysala, Kakatiya, Sena and Pandya administrative machinery was adjusted to current needs and retained. The government became more decentralized later with more autonomy given to Nayakas and Palyagars. The kings cabinet was composed of Mahapradhana (Prime minister) and several Pradhanas (ministers). All cabinet ranking officials were military trained and given the title Dandanayaka or Dandanatha. Caste was no bar to rise to high military positions and included officers from the Kuruba, Nayaka and Bedas.Kavyakartha was chief secretary to the king and was also called Rayaswami. Navigadaprabhu was the naval chief. The use of paper for administrative purposes was popularised, though about 7000 stone and copper plate inscriptions (Shasana) have been discovered.Taxes were levied on all land revenues.

Businesses were well established on Main Street downtown by 1840, but little survives of that period's commercial district, as multiple great fires afflicted the community. While some of these fires harmed the village by destroying important businesses, including a major factory on South Main, others ultimately benefited the community by destroying ramshackle buildings and forcing the construction of better structures.

The government of Zimbabwe has embarked on major socio â€“economic transformation through supporting the informal sector in an endeavor to improve urban livelihoods. In this context, this research sought to examine the contribution of the informal sector to urban livelihoods. Specific focus was on the home industries in Glen â€“ View. The study mainly used the qualitative research methods {{in order to get a}} deeper understanding of how the informal sector is contributing to livelihoods. Interviews were conducted with twenty key informants drawn from the local council, Ministry of Small and Medium Enterprises, Academics, Informal <b>Traders,</b> <b>Home</b> Industry Management Committee and other suitable stake holders who had intimate knowledge about the informal sector operations. Ninety questionnaires were administered to the community of informal traders in Glen â€“ View Home Industries in wards 30 and 32. Data that emerged from the findings was analyzed and presented using the descriptive thematic approach which was analyzed using the statistical package for social sciences (SPSS). The findings of the study reveal that informal sector has a lot of potential to contribute to improved livelihoods through employment creation, supplementing incomes, upward mobility, enhancing the standard of living and fighting poverty. However, the findings of the study reveal that a number of challenges militate against operations of the informal sector such as funding, poor working environments and lack of social services. This means there is a serious need for concerted efforts by all stakeholders to ensure that the informal sector activities are fully supported to ensure that full benefits in terms of the contribution of the informal sector in sustaining urban livelihoods is not interrupted...|$|R

Moreover, a healthy business climate is needed to create conditions conducive to hastening development, increasing the employment field, and adding to local revenue. In June-August 2006, SMERU conducted {{a study of the}} business climate in NTT, concentrating on four districts and one city in West Timor. The study aims to identify various government policies at the central, provincial, and district/city level, which are directly and indirectly related to market structure, the flow of goods, fee structures, and prices received by producers and traders of agricultural products. The study also examines the impact of various agricultural product charges on provincial and district/city local revenue. The information and data was gathered from various respondents, including producers (farmers, livestock producers, fishermen, and <b>home</b> industry operators); <b>traders</b> (intermediate traders to exporters); as well as relevant government offices and agencies. The main finding of the research is that district/city local governments in West Timor are still attempting to increase local revenue by imposing various charges on the trade of agricultural commodities, although the total charges are currently lower than the period prior to 1997. Forestry products and large livestock (mainly cattle) attract the most charges. The study made several other findings. Firstly, in an effort to avoid a central government regulation that limits the total charges, the NTT local government has endeavored to reinvent charges as third party contributions or administration fees. Secondly, although the impact of official charges on the local budget (APBD) is relatively small, it can trigger the emergence of various unofficial charges, or bribes. Thirdly, agricultural producers generally have small-scale enterprises and weak bargaining powers as selling prices are still determined by several big inter-island tradersthus forming a monopsony environment. business climate, charges, commodities, agriculture, local government, permits...|$|R
