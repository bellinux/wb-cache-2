40|$|International audienceThis paper {{investigates the}} {{geolocation}} of unknown <b>HF</b> <b>transmitters</b> for medium range distances {{in the order}} of 1000 km. In such conditions, the signal propagates through skywaves in the ionosphere-Earth waveguide, and single-hop transmission can be assumed. To evaluate the accuracy of geolocation techniques, we use the Quasi-Parabolic model of the ionosphere, providing analytical expressions of the ground distance and group path length. Classical trilateration generates small errors {{in the order of}} 25 km, but requires the assessment of the ionospheric reflection height. We propose a new blind method, independent of the ionospheric profile, and evaluate its efficiency under realistic propagation conditions...|$|R

40|$|A {{theoretical}} model is developed for artificial spread F echoes elicited by irradiating the ionospheric F region with signals from ground-based <b>HF</b> <b>transmitters.</b> Account is {{taken of the}} irregularity polarizations, scale length and the magnetic dip angle of the echo. Ray tracing equations are defined for wave propagation in a horizontally stratified ionosphere which has been bathed with HF signals and therefore contains wavelike structures. Irregularities polarized within the meridian plane are found to cause the spread F echoes, while perpendicularly polarized irregularities do not. A magnetic dip angle of 5 deg must be exceeded for the spread F to become strong. The irregularities need scale lengths exceeding 100 m. Modes of operation are identified for inducing the required spread F echoes using ground-based radiotelescopes...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{radio-frequency}} (rf) {{performance of}} a 0. 18 - m CMOS logic technology is assessed by evaluating the cutoff and maximum oscillation frequencies (and max) the minimum noise figure (min) and associated power gain () and the 1 /-noise of the devices. Gate-biasing and channel-length and gate-finger-length adjustments are identified as means to optimize the rf performance without any technology process modifications. Changing to N 2 O gate dielectrics is shown to greatly reduce the 1 / noise without sacrificing the ac performance. The power amplifier characteristics of CMOS at low power levels are also discussed.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{explores the}} effect of {{increasing}} number of receivers to evaluate the geographic location of the High Frequency (<b>HF)</b> <b>transmitters</b> for distances in the radius of 2000 km. In the case of HF propagation over long distances, signals propagate using skywaves and are reflected back to the earth from the ionosphere. The Quasi-Parabolic (QP) model of the ionosphere provides analytic equations for ray path parameters through which the signal travel time is obtained. The position of the transmitter is found using time domain HF geolocation method namely Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA). An analysis of the QP model of the ionosphere is provided and limits of the model are emphasized. The geolocation algorithm for TDoA along with its mathematical equation is explained. Simulation results demonstrate that {{increasing the number of}} receivers leads to a significant improvement in the geolocation accuracy...|$|R

Present research and development is aimed at developing tactical, mobile, easy to deploy SSL systems for locating hostile <b>HF</b> <b>transmitters.</b> These systems can detect, determine azimuth and elevation angles of incoming signals, and using ionospheric height information can calculate emitter location. The success or failure of SSL systems is dependent on many different factors, some of which are associated with site effects.

50|$|The nation's growing {{commitment}} {{informed the}} need to have an external channel through which authoritative information about the African situation could be disseminated to the entire world. Even then, its transmission, using a 10 kW <b>HF</b> <b>transmitter,</b> was limited to West Africa for two hours daily in English and French.

50|$|A braid-breaker is {{a filter}} that {{prevents}} television interference (TVI). In {{many cases of}} TVI, caused by a high field strength of a nearby high frequency (<b>HF)</b> <b>transmitter,</b> the aerial down lead plugged {{into the back of}} the TV acts as a longwire antenna or as a simple vertical element. The radio frequency (RF) current flowing through the tuner of the TV tends to generate harmonics which then spoil the viewing.|$|E
50|$|If an {{electronic}} device {{with a long}} coaxial aerial lead is disturbed by a signal from a <b>HF</b> <b>transmitter</b> then the braid of the coaxial {{should be considered as}} a path of entry of RF into the affected device. One additional feature which can assist a braid breaker is the use of an RF ground, a quarter wavelength of wire will act as an RF ground even when it goes nowhere. This is because the quarterwave transforms the infinite impedance into a zero impedance. The quarterwave length of wire can be regarded as an artificial earth for RF purposes.|$|E

Australia was represented at the meeting by Dr David Martyn who ordered a substantial quantity of British radar equipment including six high frequency (<b>HF)</b> <b>transmitters,</b> designated MB (Mobile Base). With appropriate aerials on high towers, broad coverage patterns were being produced by the new British CH (Chain Home) stations. These stations gave long-range warning of high flying aircraft. However, transmitter/receivers for an air warning system against low flying aircraft (CHL or Chain Home Low Flying) were still being developed in Britain.

The station was initially built with small cottages flanking {{the eastern side of the}} site, housing the electrical engineer-in-charge and the sailors who {{maintained the}} transmitters and antennas. These were removed in the late 1980s, although the mess building remained, with personnel moving into housing in the growing suburbs that gradually encroached on the site. The station ended transmissions on 1 June 2005, and the remaining structures on the site were demolished in December 2006 to allow for residential development on the site, forming the new suburb of Lawson.|$|R
50|$|A new {{transmitting}} {{facility was}} installed by the PMG's Department at Cox Peninsula near Darwin {{in the late}} 1960s, rebroadcasting programs emanating from Radio Australia studios in Melbourne. Equipment included three Collins Radio 250 kW <b>HF</b> <b>transmitters</b> and five log-periodic antennas directed at East Asia and South-east Asia. The antennas were largely demolished by Cyclone Tracy on 25 December 1974 and Radio Australia broadcasts from this locality were not reinstated (by then Telecom Australia) until about 1988. During the first Gulf war in 1990/91 the station provided valuable information and support to expatriate Australians caught in Iraq, and others working in (eg) Saudi Arabia. In the event however, due to financial and political pressures, as it was an expensive facility to staff being some distance from Darwin proper, transmissions from Cox Peninsula were terminated in the late 1990s. For a few years the facilities were leased to commercial operators, but eventually it was closed down. The equipment and buildings removed, and the land restored.|$|R

Using a matched filter technique, e-POP RRI was able to observe individual radio pulses transmitted by a ground-based radar. These results were used to examine the temporal variations in the dispersion, polarization, and power of the pulses, demonstrating the capacity for e-POP RRI to contribute to studies of radio propagation at high-frequency (HF) ranges. Understanding radio propagation in the presence and absence of ionospheric irregularities is crucial for ionospheric physics, as well as commercial and military radio applications.

The system is configured so that as many as twenty-two <b>HF</b> <b>transmitters</b> can be operated simultaneously. The COSAM II(DECAL/PECAL) Wideband and Narrowband RF Architecture Analysis Program was used in conducting the evaluation. The program was first run in the necessary desired power mode to determine if any of the 506 possible RF coupling paths would have unsatisfactory interference levels and to determine the mean necessary desired power for each receiver. Then the program was run in the system performance score mode to evaluate the performance of each of the twenty-three receivers. Although two of the receivers had marginally unsatisfactory scores, the overall system performance was determined to be satisfactory, with an average performance score of 84 %.
