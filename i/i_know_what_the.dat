[...] "I wanted him to know he didn't need to pay {{attention}} to all this; that he was going to make it through. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> next Nirvana record was going to sound like. It was going to be an amazing fucking record, and I'm a little angry at him for killing himself. He and I were going to make a trial run of the album. It was set up. He had a plane ticket. At the last minute he called and said, 'I can't come.'" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I wish <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> other {{business}} of this gentleman is! He seems amicably disposed, except as regards Mr. Blunt. They looked coldly and suspiciously at each other." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I would <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Rabbi Jacob Ben Tudela would opine on it," [...] replied Isaac;--"nevertheless, {{the good}} youth must not bleed to death. Let Seth and Reuben bear him to Ashby." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "If <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> dusky {{image was}} {{thinking}} I should feel considerably more at ease," [...] he said. [...] "Still, I don't, and there's very little use in guessing. After all, {{we are a}} long way from grasping the negro's point of view on most subjects yet.

6000|$|... "I guessed as much, Menzies," [...] Ronald said. [...] "I think <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> story is, {{and who is}} the man who {{has spread}} it. It is that I bore another name in England." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{just give}} up then. <b>I</b> <b>knowed</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> matter was. That cut bank was an island, and Jim had gone down t'other side of it. It warn't no towhead that you could float by in ten minutes. It had the big timber of a regular island; it might be five or six miles long {{and more than half}} a mile wide.|$|R
6000|$|He {{smoothed}} {{down her}} hair with his hand. [...] "Why, Marsh! Did you think that made me unhappy? I didn't mind it a bit. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> trouble was, at the time; but I wasn't going to say anything. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> you {{would be all right}} as soon as you could think it over.

6000|$|... 'Messer Filippo,' she said, 'will {{you help}} me now?

6000|$|Sir Mallaby {{regarded}} him disprovingly. [...] "I'm hanged if <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what's</b> <b>the</b> {{matter with you}} to-night, Sam. You seem to have unhitched your brain and left it in the umbrella stand. You hadn't a word to say for yourself all through dinner. You {{might have been a}} Trappist monk. And with that delightful girl Miss Bennett, there, too. She must have thought you infernally dull." ...|$|R
5000|$|Zelazny {{experimented with}} a number of {{narrative}} techniques. [...] Doorways uses a flashforward technique which can be confused with flashback.
