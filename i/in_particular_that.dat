5|$|Edward's {{problems}} with the opposition did not end with the Falkirk campaign. Over the following years he would be held up to the promises he had made, <b>in</b> <b>particular</b> <b>that</b> of upholding the Charter of the Forest. In the parliament of 1301, the King was forced to order {{an assessment of the}} royal forests, but in 1305 he obtained a papal bull that freed him from this concession. Ultimately, it was a failure in personnel that spelt the end of the opposition against EdwardI. Bohun died late in 1298, after returning from the Falkirk campaign. As for Bigod, in 1302 he arrived at an agreement with the King that was beneficial for both: Bigod, who had no children, made Edward his heir, in return for a generous annual grant. Edward finally got his revenge on Winchelsey in 1305, when Clement V was elected pope. Clement was a Gascon sympathetic to the King, and on Edward's instigation had Winchelsey suspended from office.|$|E
5|$|Historically {{four major}} {{industries}} shaped the Texas economy prior to World War II: cattle and bison, cotton, timber, and oil. Before {{and after the}} U.S. Civil War the cattle industry, which Texas came to dominate, was a major economic driver for the state, thus creating the traditional image of the Texas cowboy. In the later 19th century cotton and lumber grew to be major industries as the cattle industry became less lucrative. It was ultimately, though, the discovery of major petroleum deposits (Spindletop <b>in</b> <b>particular)</b> <b>that</b> initiated an economic boom which became {{the driving force behind}} the economy for much of the 20th century. With strong investments in universities, Texas developed a diversified economy and high tech industry in the mid-20th century. As of 2015, it is second on the list of the most Fortune 500 companies with 54. With a growing base of industry, the state leads in many industries, including agriculture, petrochemicals, energy, computers and electronics, aerospace, and biomedical sciences. Texas has led the nation in state export revenue since 2002, and has the second-highest gross state product. If it were a country, Texas would be the 10th largest economy in the world.|$|E
5|$|Marquis {{developed}} his own theories regarding {{the history of}} the Cheyenne. One idea <b>in</b> <b>particular,</b> <b>that</b> many of Custer's men committed suicide when the situation became hopeless, proved to be highly controversial. This idea first surfaced in the Wooden Leg narrative, but was most fully developed in Keep the Last Bullet for Yourself, considered by Marquis to be his most important work and the culmination of his Custer research. The latter was not published during Marquis' life; much of his work did not appear in print until the 1970s. The last book to be published, The Cheyennes of Montana (pub. 1978), is regarded as especially valuable by historians. In 2006 of a collection of his photographs was published as, A Northern Cheyenne Album.|$|E

5|$|Not many predators {{challenge}} {{an adult}} black mamba {{although it does}} face a few threats such as birds of prey, particularly snake eagles. Although all species of snake eagle commonly prey on snakes, there are two species <b>in</b> <b>particular</b> <b>that</b> do so with high frequency, including preying on black mambas. These are the black-chested snake eagle (Circaetus pectoralis) and the brown snake eagle (Circaetus cinereus). The Cape file snake (Mehelya capensis), which is apparently immune to all African snake venoms and preys on other snakes including venomous ones, is a common predator of black mambas (limited only by the size it can swallow). Mongooses, which also are partially immune to venom, and are often quick enough to evade a bite, will sometimes tackle a black mamba for prey. Humans do not usually consume black mambas, but they often kill them out of fear.|$|E
5|$|Nothing {{is known}} of Gasparo Cairano before 1489. No {{information}} has been found about the date and place of his birth, education, or the circumstances {{that led him to}} Brescia. The appellation da Milano, with which he is often recalled in the sources, however, does not provide a definitive fact of his origin because it could refer to the city {{as well as to the}} dukedom or diocese. The generic reference, in any case, is compatible with the cultural basis of his artistic work. Some conjectures can be made on the surname Cairano, <b>in</b> <b>particular</b> <b>that</b> it leads one to Cairate in Varese province, which is to this day shortened to Caira in the local dialect.|$|E
5|$|Shakespeare {{influenced}} novelists such as Thomas Hardy, William Faulkner, and Charles Dickens. The American novelist Herman Melville's soliloquies owe much to Shakespeare; his Captain Ahab in Moby-Dick is {{a classic}} tragic hero, inspired by King Lear. Scholars have identified 20,000 pieces of music linked to Shakespeare's works. These include two operas by Giuseppe Verdi, Otello and Falstaff, whose critical standing compares {{with that of the}} source plays. Shakespeare has also inspired many painters, including the Romantics and the Pre-Raphaelites. The Swiss Romantic artist Henry Fuseli, a friend of William Blake, even translated Macbeth into German. The psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud drew on Shakespearean psychology, <b>in</b> <b>particular,</b> <b>that</b> of Hamlet, for his theories of human nature.|$|E

5|$|The algebra of observables {{in quantum}} {{mechanics}} is naturally an algebra of operators defined on a Hilbert space, according to Werner Heisenberg's matrix mechanics formulation of quantum theory. Von Neumann began investigating operator algebras in the 1930s, as rings of operators on a Hilbert space. The kind of algebras studied by von Neumann and his contemporaries are now known as von Neumann algebras. In the 1940s, Israel Gelfand, Mark Naimark and Irving Segal gave a definition {{of a kind of}} operator algebras called C*-algebras that on the one hand made no reference to an underlying Hilbert space, and on the other extrapolated many of the useful features of the operator algebras that had previously been studied. The spectral theorem for self-adjoint operators <b>in</b> <b>particular</b> <b>that</b> underlies much of the existing Hilbert space theory was generalized to C*-algebras. These techniques are now basic in abstract harmonic analysis and representation theory.|$|E
5|$|On {{the third}} morning, Bradman resumed {{proceedings}} {{by taking a}} single from a Bedser no ball. In same over, one ball reared from the pitch and moved into Bradman, hitting him in the groin, causing a delay as he recovered from the pain and recomposed himself before play resumed. In the second over bowled by Pollard, Hassett fell for 13 on the second ball, which lifted suddenly after bouncing. Miller came to the crease and drove his first ball for three runs, bringing Bradman on strike for the fourth ball of the over. Pollard then pitched a ball {{in the same place}} as he did to Hassett, but this time it skidded off the pitch and knocked out Bradman's off stump for 33. According to O'Reilly, Bradman backed away from the ball as it cut off the pitch with a noticeable flinch. O'Reilly attributed Bradman's unwillingness to get behind the ball to the blow inflicted on him by Bedser in the previous over and the rearing ball that dismissed Hassett. The crowd, sensing the importance of the two quick wickets, <b>in</b> <b>particular</b> <b>that</b> of Bradman, who had been so productive at Headingley, erupted. This left Australia struggling at 3/68, but a rapid counterattack by the middle and lower order took them to 9/457 at stumps and eventually 458 on the fourth morning.|$|E
