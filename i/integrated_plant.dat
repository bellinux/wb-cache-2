2500|$|Although U.S. Steel had {{continued}} to expand in the area west of Union-Miles Park from 1900 to 1925, the Great Depression led {{to the collapse of}} the steel industry in the neighborhood. U.S. Steel had been created {{from a wide range of}} companies. Rather than an <b>integrated</b> <b>plant,</b> the company found that gross inefficiencies emerged as the pieces of the company attempted to work together to make steel. The company had to move molten iron [...] from the Central Furnaces to the Newburgh Works using congested railroads. Once converted into steel, the steel had to be shipped to other Cleveland area plants for conversion into beams, plate, rods, and wire. U.S. Steel announced on December 1, 1932, that it would close the Newburgh Works in four months. The mill's furnaces and Bessemer converters went cold on April 30, 1933, and its demolition began in September 1935. Superior Screw moved to Shaker Heights, Ohio, in 1933 as well.|$|E

40|$|This paper tests four propositions {{regarding}} {{the efficiency of}} vertical arrangements: (1) vertically integrated and nonintegrated firms allocate inputs with efficiency and (2) achieve equal technical efficiency; (3) upstream transaction-specific investments provide monopsony power; and (4) monopsony behavior does not differ by vertical arrangement. A behavioral cost function for mine-mouth generating plants is estimated. The findings include {{significant differences in the}} allocative efficiency of <b>integrated</b> versus nonintegrated <b>plants</b> and increased technical efficiency for vertically <b>integrated</b> <b>plants.</b> Transaction-specific investments in mines provide monopsony power. Nonintegrated plants exercise this power, while <b>integrated</b> <b>plants</b> do not. Copyright 1991 by Blackwell Publishing Ltd. ...|$|R
