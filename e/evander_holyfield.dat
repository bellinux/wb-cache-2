5000|$|The {{gameplay}} of {{the game}} is very similar to that featured in <b>Evander</b> <b>Holyfield's</b> Real Deal Boxing.

5000|$|A 1998 {{ranking of}} [...] "The Greatest Heavyweights of All-Time" [...] by Ring {{magazine}} placed Tyson at No.14 on the list.

50|$|Mercer's victory {{propelled}} {{into one}} of the top heavyweights in the division and he made it known in his post-match interview that he wanted a shot at <b>Evander</b> <b>Holyfield's</b> Undisputed Heavyweight title. Mercer chose to bypass a WBO title match with Michael Moorer, instead vacating the title in order to move on to a number one contenders match with Larry Holmes scheduled on February 7, 1992 with a shot at Holyfield's Undisputed title on the line. Mercer was installed as a heavy favorite over the aging Holmes, but Holmes was able to outbox and outpoint Mercer en route to a unanimous decision victory, taking Mercer's title shot against Holyfield in the process.|$|R
2500|$|The sanctioning bodies {{ordered a}} rematch. Eight months later in Las Vegas (13 November 1999), {{the two men}} fought again in a more open and {{entertaining}} contest than the original fight, with the two boxers having some heavy exchanges from rounds six to nine. The punch stats however still clearly favoured Lewis who landed 195 punches to <b>Evander</b> <b>Holyfield's</b> 137 punches, although interestingly Lewis landed 119 power shots and 76 jabs, showing a definite shift in his tactics from the first fight when he focused more on the jab.

25|$|Lewis won the lineal title by {{defeating}} Shannon Briggs in 1998.

O'Brien's participation eventually became regular, as he was cast to play Lawrence Fletcher, the children's father, who appears in {{about half of the}} episodes in the show.|$|E
500|$|The fight {{scenes were}} heavily choreographed, but the actors were {{required}} to [...] "go full out" [...] to capture realistic effects like having the wind knocked out of them. Makeup artist Julie Pearce, {{who worked for the}} director on the 1997 film The Game, studied mixed martial arts and pay-per-view boxing to portray the fighters accurately. She designed an extra's ear to have cartilage missing, citing as inspiration the boxing match in which Mike Tyson bit off part of <b>Evander</b> <b>Holyfield's</b> ear. Makeup artists devised two methods to create sweat on cue: spraying mineral water over a coat of Vaseline, and using the unadulterated water for [...] "wet sweat". Meat Loaf, who plays a member of the fight club who has [...] "bitch tits", wore a 90-pound (40kg) fat harness that gave him large breasts for the role. He also wore eight-inch (20cm) lifts in his scenes with Norton to be taller than him.|$|R
50|$|Career mode is {{slightly}} altered, {{in that the}} player fights {{their way through the}} thirty imaginary boxers in the game, with the last of these fights being for the World Heavyweight Title. After the player has won the title, they then fight all eight of the pugilists based on real-life boxers, in 'challenge' matches. Also, when creating a fighter, it is no longer possible to alter whether the boxer is left or right-handed. Instead, it is now possible to choose the physical size of your boxer from three pre-sets. An improvement over <b>Evander</b> <b>Holyfield's</b> Real Deal Boxing is that the player now has many more colors to choose from when determining skin and hair colour for their fighter. If they so wish, they can have boxers that are wildly unrealistic colours such as bright blue or green. There are also more colors to choose from when adjusting the color of a fighter's shorts.|$|R
5000|$|Coetzer {{went on to}} earn a number-one {{contender}} {{spot for}} <b>Evander</b> <b>Holyfield's</b> IBF world title, but was made to fight a WBA Heavyweight Title Eliminator, scheduled for 12 rounds, against the number-two contender, Riddick Bowe. The bout took place on 18 July 1992 in Las Vegas, Nevada. During the fight, Bowe was ahead in scoring, although Coetzer disagreed. In the sixth round, Bowe hit Coetzer below the belt, for which the referee Mills Lane had deducted a point. In the seventh round, Bowe hit Coetzer with {{what appeared to be}} a right-handed low blow. Coetzer turned away, and anticipated that Lane would warn Bowe, however, he left his hands down, and Bowe delivered a jolting right uppercut. Bowe then followed with a left and right that drove Coetzer into the ropes, which caused Lane to step in and end the match with a TKO. [...] "It definitely shouldn't have been stopped," [...] said Coetzer. [...] "It was a low blow." ...|$|R
