5|$|After the 1969 {{burglary}} {{of a house}} Hendrix was renting in Benedict Canyon, California, {{and while}} <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>under</b> the influence of drugs and alcohol, he punched his friend Paul Caruso and accused him of the theft. He then chased Caruso away from the residence while throwing stones at him. A few days later, one of Hendrix's girlfriends, Carmen Borrero, required stitches after he hit her above her eye with a vodka bottle during a drunken, jealous rage.|$|E

5|$|In addition, most {{researchers}} have speculated {{as to why}} Sydney {{was so close to}} an unknown vessel, with various levels of blame assigned to Captain Burnett for the demise of his ship. Theories to explain Burnett's actions include that he was inexperienced or incompetent, deceived by Kormorans disguise, the idea that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>under</b> conflicting orders instructing that raiders be attacked at range but enemy supply ships be captured, or {{that he was trying to}} clearly identify the merchantman.|$|E

5|$|After the Japanese {{occupied}} the Dutch East Indies in 1942, Soeman {{was made a}} school supervisor by occupying forces. He soon became involved in politics, being elected to the Shūsangikai, a Japanese-sponsored regional representatives' council, for Riau. He later recalled that, {{because he had been}} elected rather than selected by the Japanese forces—and thus had strong backing among the community, which could be used for revolution—he had felt as though <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>under</b> constant surveillance. This situation continued until after the Japanese withdrew from Indonesia and Sukarno proclaimed an independent Indonesia.|$|E
5|$|From these positions, the New Zealanders {{were ordered}} to capture Belhamed, Sidi Rezegh proper and Ed Duda. This was to precede a renewed {{break-out}} offensive by the 70th Division. Scobie had informed Lieutenant-General Alfred Godwin-Austen, the XIII Corps commander, responsible for all operations near Tobruk, that the positions between him and Ed Duda were strongly defended. Godwin-Austen assured Scobie that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>under</b> no obligation to attack until the New Zealand Division had taken Ed Duda. Undertaking a night assault, the New Zealand infantry captured Belhamed despite strong resistance, but their attacks to take their other objectives were repulsed.|$|E

5|$|In 1855, Melvin {{was elected}} as the Commonwealth's {{attorney}} of Hancock County, {{despite the fact}} that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>under</b> the required minimum age of 21 to hold public office. He was twice reelected for full terms to the position in 1856 and 1860. Melvin continued to serve as Hancock County's prosecuting attorney notwithstanding his relocation to Wheeling in 1857. Following his move to Wheeling, he established a law practice known as Pendleton & Melvin with Joseph H. Pendleton, {{who was one of the}} city's preeminent lawyers. During this period, Melvin was affiliated with the Whig Party.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, many Olympic athletes began using drugs {{to improve their}} {{athletic}} abilities. For example, in 1904, Thomas Hicks, a gold medallist in the marathon, was given strychnine by his coach. The only Olympic death linked to performance enhancing occurred at the 1960 Rome games. A Danish cyclist, Knud Enemark Jensen, fell from his bicycle and later died. A coroner's inquiry found that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>under</b> the influence of amphetamines. By the mid-1960s, sports federations started to ban the use of performance-enhancing drugs; in 1967 the IOC followed suit.|$|E
5|$|Morrell left Arsenal {{during the}} First World War and James McEwen served as {{caretaker}} manager, presiding over two matches. Both managers' work over 1914–15 resulted in Arsenal finishing in fifth place and aided the club's re-election to the First Division. When professional football resumed in 1919, Norris appointed Leslie Knighton as the club's manager. Arsenal remained under financial strain {{during this period}} and stagnated in the league; Kingston in his autobiography claimed <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>under</b> strict instruction to spend little on transfers. His working relationship with Norris moreover deteriorated and in 1925 he was dismissed. The decision to sack Knighton {{was said to have}} been made following Arsenal's defeat to West Ham United in the FA Cup, a competition which presented the club's only realistic chance of silverware.|$|E

5|$|Norris {{began to}} plan for the rescue of Walker, still more than a {{kilometer}} behind front lines. Walker managed to evade capture for almost 11 days when on the night of April 18, without FAC coverage, he moved on his own accord and ran into a local villager who alerted the North Vietnamese. They began tracking him and the next morning the FAC saw NVA very near Walker's position. Walker radioed the FAC that rescue should not be attempted because NVA forces were closing in and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>under</b> fire. Bilk 36, a OV-10A flown by FAC 1st Lt. Mickey Fain, reported that Walker was surrounded by more than 20 NVA soldiers and shortly afterward saw his body lying in the grass. Walker's body was never recovered.|$|E
5|$|One of Briskin's children, Gerald (Jerry), {{also became}} a {{producer}} in the film industry, working at the same company as his father, Columbia. He also followed his father into the armed services during World War II, becoming a sergeant in the Signal Corps. Through Jerry, Briskin became a grandfather on May 23, 1944. Briskin's wife's name was Sara, and they had one other child, a son named Bernard. Throughout his life Briskin was a well-known philanthropist, and was quite active in Temple Israel in Los Angeles, as well as Cedars-Sinai Hospital, where he served as president. On Halloween 1968 (October 31), Briskin had a major heart attack and was admitted in critical condition to the hospital. He died two weeks later on November 14, 1968 at UCLA Medical Center, where <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>under</b> treatment.|$|E
5|$|Pantulf {{was present}} at the consecration of the church at Bec Abbey on 23 October 1077, along with King William the Conqueror of England. Pantulf lost his lands {{temporarily}} because he was suspected of murdering Roger's wife Mabel de Bellême, around 1077. Pantulf came under suspicion because Mabel had seized a castle at Peray en Saonnais held by Pantulf. When he was accused of the murder, Pantulf was in southern Italy, which had also been conquered by Normans. Pantulf sought refuge at the Abbey of Saint-Evroul in Normandy while <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>under</b> suspicion; he and his family were under the protection of the abbot.|$|E

5|$|Prince Sihanouk was {{surprisingly}} acquiescent {{about the whole}} affair. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>under</b> pressure from the U.S. to reopen diplomatic ties and to act militarily against the sanctuaries; from the North Vietnamese, who now received 80 percent of their supplies for their southernmost operations through Sihanoukville; and from the fledgling Chinese-supported Khmer Rouge (approximately 4,000 men). Sihanouk {{felt that this was}} a propitious moment to swing back to the right. By the summer he created a right-wing Government of National Salvation under General Lon Nol and he suspended DRV arms shipments through his ports.|$|E
5|$|Simpson {{fell ill}} with {{diarrhoea}} during the Tour's tenth stage. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>under</b> pressure from his personal manager {{to continue in}} the race, though members of his team encouraged him to quit. Near the summit of Mont Ventoux, Simpson fell off of his bike but was able to get back on it. After riding a short distance further, he collapsed. He was pronounced dead after being airlifted to a hospital. The post-mortem examination found that he had taken amphetamine and alcohol, a diuretic combination which proved fatal when combined with the heat, the hard climb of the Ventoux and the stomach complaint.|$|E
5|$|Taft sent {{a special}} message to Congress {{on the need}} for a revamped {{antitrust}} statute when it convened its regular session in December 1911, but it took no action. Another antitrust case that had political repercussions for Taft was that brought against the International Harvester Company, the large manufacturer of farm equipment, in early 1912. As Roosevelt's administration had investigated International Harvester, but had taken no action (a decision Taft had supported), the suit became caught up in Roosevelt's challenge for the Republican presidential nomination. Supporters of Taft alleged that Roosevelt had acted improperly; the former president blasted Taft for waiting three and a half years, and until <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>under</b> challenge, to reverse a decision he had supported.|$|E
