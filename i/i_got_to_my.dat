500|$|In 1982 the Cure {{recorded}} and released Pornography, {{the third and}} final album of an [...] "oppressively dispirited" [...] trio that cemented the Cure's stature as purveyors of the emerging gothic rock genre. Smith has said that during the recording of Pornography he was [...] "undergoing a lot of mental stress. But {{it had nothing to do}} with the group, it just had to do with what I was like, my age and things. I think <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> worst round about Pornography. Looking back and getting other people's opinions of what went on, I was a pretty monstrous sort of person at that time". Gallup described the album by saying, [...] "Nihilism took over [...] We sang 'It doesn't matter if we all die' and that is exactly what we thought at the time." [...] Parry was concerned that the album did not have a hit song for radio play and instructed Smith and producer Phil Thornalley to polish the track [...] "The Hanging Garden" [...] for release as a single. Despite the concerns about the album's uncommercial sound, Pornography became the band's first UK Top 10 album, charting at number eight. The release of Pornography was followed by the Fourteen Explicit Moments tour, where the band finally dropped the anti-image angle and first adopted their signature look of big, towering hair and smeared lipstick on their faces. The tour also saw a series of incidents that prompted Simon Gallup to leave the Cure at the tour's conclusion. Gallup and Smith did not talk to each other for eighteen months following his departure.|$|E
2500|$|Fiennes {{stated that}} he had two weeks to shoot the climactic {{showdown}} scene where he is gloating over a terrified Harry, played by Daniel Radcliffe. Fiennes said with a chuckle: [...] "I have no doubt children will be afraid of me now if they weren't before." [...] In preparation, he read the novel Goblet of Fire, but jokingly conceded: [...] "I was only interested in my scene, and I {{had to go through}} thousands and thousands of other scenes which I did, dutifully, until <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> scene and I read it many, many, many, many, many times and that was my research." [...] Fiennes reprised his role as Voldemort in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1 and Part 2.|$|E

60|$|When <b>I</b> <b>got</b> back <b>to</b> <b>my</b> room <b>I</b> {{locked the}} door behind me, {{and went to sleep}} in the dark. I did not want light just then--could not bear it.|$|R
6000|$|When <b>I</b> <b>got</b> back <b>to</b> <b>my</b> {{breakfast in}} the Boar's coffee-room, I found Mr. Pumblechook conversing with the landlord. Mr. Pumblechook (not {{improved}} in appearance by his late nocturnal adventure) was waiting for me, and addressed me in the following terms:-- ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> feet briskly, {{and he made}} {{way for me to}} go out. As I {{passed through}} the lobby I heard Mr. Burns' voice saying: ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> new {{destination}} {{the next}} day, presented my credentials, gave myself the {{full advantage of}} my high connections, and was received with enthusiasm and distinction.|$|E
6000|$|I ran home, {{clutching}} the ten delicious, crisp hundred pounds, and the dear little fifty which {{made up the}} account. I flew through the streets again. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> chambers. I bolted the outer doors. I sank back in my great chair, and slept. [...] .|$|E
6000|$|... "Had {{kind of a}} {{run-in with}} Graff in the office. He's getting too darn fresh. I'll stand for a good deal, but {{once in a while}} <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> assert <b>my</b> authority, and I jumped him. 'Stan,' I said--Well, I told him just exactly where he got off.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{only just}} believe it, Marse Tom, I know it. Day before {{yesterday}} they {{knew something was}} going to happen. They were that excited, and whispering around together; why, anybody could see that they-- But my! I must get back to her, and <b>I</b> haven't <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> errand yet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{picked it}} up," [...] I gurgled feebly, as <b>I</b> <b>got</b> on <b>to</b> <b>my</b> feet again, {{and it is}} a solemn fact that my mind was so {{disturbed}} that at the moment I could remember nothing else about the ring except that I had picked it up in Leo's cave.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> feet. I beheld Miller Gorse sitting impassive, {{with his}} {{encompassing}} stare, the strongest man of them all. A change of firmaments would not move him. But Dickinson had risen {{and put his}} hand on my shoulder. It was the first time I had ever seen him white.|$|E
60|$|Nevertheless {{something}} in Sullivan's voice and manner restored my confidence, and when I {{called on the}} editor of the Century I was able to assume the tone of successful authorship. The closer <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> market the more assured I became. I counted for {{something in}} New York. My thirty years of effort were remembered in my favor.|$|E
60|$|By {{the time}} <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> third {{appointment}} I was entirely exhausted. I met here some, however, whom I was exceedingly interested to see; among them Samuel Gurney, brother of Elizabeth Fry, {{with his wife}} and family. Lady Edward Buxton is one of his daughters. All had that air of benevolent friendliness which is characteristic of the sect.|$|E
5000|$|The beat is {{a simple}} production. In all, it {{includes}} three stabs in various pitches, pizzicato strings, repetitive hi-hats, open high hats, 808 claps, 808 bass drums, and a Lil' Keke sample [...] "Aye <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> work <b>my</b> wood grain wheel// Trunk steady bumpin', grills steady commin'" [...] which ties the track together.|$|R
6000|$|... "Fetter {{us without}} delay, Maestro!" [...] said the youth, [...] "for <b>I</b> have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> take <b>my</b> bride home and paint her under {{the light of}} a lantern." ...|$|R
60|$|He wished me good-night, {{and held}} up his light. I walked {{by the side of}} the down Line of rails (with a very disagreeable {{sensation}} of a train coming behind me) until I found the path. It was easier to mount than <b>to</b> descend, and <b>I</b> <b>got</b> back <b>to</b> <b>my</b> inn without any adventure.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{had been}} {{spending}} {{the day with}} the Wilkinsons. I did not start to ride home till it was rather late, and I was riding fast when, {{about a quarter of}} a mile before <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> place, I rode right into the middle of a lot of men on horseback. They evidently hadn't heard me coming, and were as much surprised as I was.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, the chain. I didn't {{care for}} the ship, as I saw it {{contained}} some skippers. On the way home the chain and anchor began to lie heavily on my stomach. I didn't seem to digest them properly, {{and by the time}} <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> palace, where you will notice there is no throne, I was thrown into throes of severe pain. So I at once sent for Dr. Shark--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But--" [...] there I stopped, {{paralyzed by}} what {{appeared}} to me the quintessence of feminine inconsistency and caprice. Yet, as I stared at her, she certainly did not appear capricious. It is not {{too much to say}} that I was fairly astounded at this evidence of self-command and decision, of the strength of mind to refuse me. Was it possible that she had felt nothing and I all? <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> feet.|$|E
6000|$|When <b>I</b> <b>got</b> back <b>to</b> <b>my</b> observatory, <b>I</b> found Mr. Jay digesting his mutton-chops in an armchair, {{with his}} pipe in his mouth. On his table were two tumblers, {{a jug of}} water, and the pint bottle of brandy. It was then close upon seven o'clock. As the hour struck the person {{described}} as [...] "Jack" [...] walked in.|$|R
60|$|At {{the end of}} a week <b>I</b> <b>got</b> {{an answer}} <b>to</b> <b>my</b> letter. It was what I wanted. I wrote again and sent a parcel. In three weeks' time the storm burst.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh dear no. <b>I</b> have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> mind <b>my</b> dress. There;--I {{have gone}} {{right into a}} puddle. Oh dear!" [...] So she ran on, and Silverbridge {{followed}} close behind her, leaving Dolly Longstaff in the distance.|$|R
60|$|After my {{talk with}} McCann I {{was sitting on}} the {{forecastle}} propped against the bitts of the Maria's anchor-chain, and looking at the swirling foam cast up by the tug's propeller. There were many things I wished to turn over in my mind just then, but I had not long been in a state of reverie when I became conscious that Miss Thorn was standing beside me. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> feet.|$|E
60|$|As <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> horse {{the next}} morning, the four ladies were {{all at the}} same window whence we had once looked down on Catriona, and all cried {{farewell}} and waved their pocket napkins as I rode away; one out of the four I knew was truly sorry; and at the thought of that, and how I had come to the door three months ago for the first time, sorrow and gratitude made a confusion in my mind.|$|E
60|$|Sir Leicester Dedlock coughed as if {{he could}} not {{possibly}} hear another word in reference to such an individual and took his leave with great ceremony and politeness. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> own room with all possible speed and remained there until I had recovered my self-command. It had been very much disturbed, but I was thankful to find when I went downstairs again that they only rallied me for having been shy and mute before the great Lincolnshire baronet.|$|E
6000|$|... "It won't be {{necessary}} for them to look at 'em," [...] returned the captain, doggedly. [...] "I have 'em and that's enough. <b>I</b> ain't <b>got</b> <b>to</b> show <b>my</b> papers no more than they hev <b>got</b> <b>to</b> show theirs." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{found myself}} that the cries were {{singularly}} irritating, and they grew in depth and intensity {{as the afternoon}} wore on. They were painful at first, but their constant resurgence at last altogether upset my balance. I flung aside a crib of Horace I had been reading, and began <b>to</b> clench <b>my</b> fists, <b>to</b> bite <b>my</b> lips, and <b>to</b> pace the room. Presently <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> stopping <b>my</b> ears with my fingers.|$|R
5000|$|We grew {{up going}} to Big Days Out on the Gold Coast… Luke Boerdam bought a ticket when he was 16 and his parents wouldn’t let him go so he pegged a cereal bowl at the wall and said [...] "Fuck you" [...] ran away and went to Big Day Out. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> see <b>my</b> {{favourite}} band in the year 2000, Blink-182, that was sick. So we’re stoked to be on Big Day Out ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I poured out, then, {{under the}} trees, {{and in the}} calm moonlight, that {{discourse}} which I had pronounced under the blazing sun of noon. My Israelite only interrupted me by exclamations indicative of surprise, assent, admiration, and increasing conviction. [...] "Prodigious!" [...] said he;--"Wunderschon!" [...] would he remark {{at the conclusion of}} some eloquent passage; in a word, he exhausted the complimentary interjections of our language: and to compliments what man is averse? I think we must have walked two miles when <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> third head and my companion begged I would enter his house, which we now neared, and partake of a glass of beer; to which I was never averse.|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{the moment}} we pulled into Quito, she did what she'd done before--vanished. Sarah never {{believes}} me when I say how relieved I felt to be quit of her. But {{it was not to}} be. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> 'dobe house and managed a cracking fine dinner my cook had ready for me. She was mostly Spiggoty and half Indian, and her name was Paloma.-- Now, Sarah, haven't I told you she was older'n a grandmother, and looked more like a buzzard than a dove? Why, I couldn't bear to eat with her around where I could look at her. But she did make things comfortable, and she was some economical when it came to marketing.|$|E
60|$|My next {{care was}} for some {{ammunition}} and arms. There were two very good fowling-pieces {{in the great}} cabin, and two pistols. These I secured first, with some powder-horns and a small bag of shot, and two old rusty swords. I knew there were three barrels of powder in the ship, but knew not where our gunner had stowed them; but with much search I found them, two of them dry and good, the third had taken water. Those two <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> raft with the arms. And now I thought myself pretty well freighted, and began to think how I should get to shore with them, having neither sail, oar, nor rudder; and the least capful of wind would have overset all my navigation.|$|E
40|$|After I {{finished}} my blog project Bilateral Kellerberrin in WA (April-May 2005) I had an epiphany. In Kellerberrin, I had an amazing time “getting {{to know the}} townsfolk” 2000 km from home, but when <b>I</b> <b>got</b> back <b>to</b> <b>my</b> own suburb, I {{was struck by how}} little I knew my own neighbours. So I decided to do the exact same project at home: and that’s what became Bilateral Petersham: April-May 2006...|$|R

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>got</b> back <b>to</b> <b>my</b> hotel {{without having}} met any one whom I knew, {{and that night}} I {{received}} a note from Barker, stating that he had fully intended coming to the steamer to see me off, but that an engagement would prevent him. He sent, however, his best good wishes for my safe passage, and assured me that he would keep me fully informed {{of the state of}} my affairs on this side.|$|R
