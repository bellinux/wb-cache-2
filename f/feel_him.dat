2500|$|The {{theological}} {{beliefs of}} Quaker yearly meetings vary considerably. Tolerance of dissent widely varies among yearly meetings. Most Friends believe in continuing revelation, {{which is the}} religious belief that truth is continuously revealed directly to individuals from God. George Fox, an [...] "early Friend", described it as [...] "Christ has come to teach His people Himself." [...] Friends often focus on trying to hear God. As Isaac Penington wrote in 1670, [...] "It {{is not enough to}} hear of Christ, or read of Christ, but this is the thing—to <b>feel</b> <b>him</b> to be my root, my life, and my foundation..." [...] Quakers reject the idea of priests, believing in the priesthood of all believers. Some Friends express their concept of God using various phrases including the inner light, or inward light of Christ, the Holy Spirit or other phrases.|$|E

We <b>feel</b> <b>him</b> so close", while Freddy Vallejos, of Vallegrande, proclaimed [...] "we have a faith, a confidence in Che. When I go to bed and when I wake up, I first pray to God and then I pray to Che – and then, everything is all right. Che's presence here is a positive force. I feel it in my skin, I have faith that always, at all times, he has an eye on us." [...] Remi Calzadilla, a resident of Pucara, claimed that praying to Che had helped him regain the ability to walk, adding that [...] "now every time I speak to Che I {{feel a strong force}} inside of me." ...|$|E
2500|$|While {{shooting}} {{a movie in}} Arizona, Stewart {{received a phone call}} from Dr. Keagy, his veterinarian, who informed him that Beau was terminally ill, and that Gloria sought his permission to perform euthanasia. Stewart declined to give a reply over the phone, and told Keagy to [...] "keep him alive and I'll be there." [...] Stewart requested several days' leave, which allowed him to spend some time with Beau before granting the doctor permission to euthanize the sick dog. Following the procedure, Stewart sat in his car for ten minutes to clear his eyes of tears. Stewart later remembered:After [...] died there were a lot of nights when I was certain that I could <b>feel</b> <b>him</b> get into bed beside me and I would reach out and pat his head. The feeling was so real that I wrote a poem about it and how much it hurt to realize that he wasn’t going to be there any more.|$|E

2500|$|Thus disguised, Jacob {{entered his}} father's room. Surprised to {{perceive}} that Esau was back so soon, Isaac asked {{how it could}} be that the hunt went so quickly. Jacob responded, [...] "Because the [...] your God arranged it for me"; Rashi (on [...] ) says Isaac's suspicions were aroused because Esau never used the personal name of God. Isaac demanded that Jacob come close so he could <b>feel</b> <b>him,</b> but the goatskins felt just like Esau's hairy skin. Confused, Isaac exclaimed, [...] "The voice is the voice of Jacob, but the hands are the hands of Esau!" [...] (27:22). Still trying to get at the truth, Isaac asked him point-blank, [...] "Are you really my son Esau?" [...] and Jacob answered simply, [...] "I am" [...] (which can be taken as [...] "I am me", not [...] "I am Esau"). Isaac proceeded to eat the food and to drink the wine that Jacob gave him, and then he blessed him with the dew of the heavens, the fatness of the earth, and rulership over many nations as well as his own brother.|$|E
2500|$|Disguised as Esau, Jacob entered Isaac's room. Surprised that Esau {{was back}} so soon, Isaac asked {{how it could}} be that the hunt went so quickly. Jacob responded, [...] "Because the LORD your God brought it to me." [...] Rashi, on [...] says Isaac's suspicions were aroused even more, because Esau never used the {{personal}} name of God. Isaac demanded that Jacob come close so he could <b>feel</b> <b>him,</b> but the goatskins felt just like Esau's hairy skin. Confused, Isaac exclaimed, [...] "The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau!" [...] Still trying to get at the truth, Isaac asked him directly, [...] "Art thou my very son Esau?" [...] and Jacob answered simply, [...] "I am." [...] Isaac proceeded to eat the food and to drink the wine that Jacob gave him, and then told him to come close and kiss him. [...] As Jacob kissed his father, Isaac smelled the clothes which belonged to Esau and finally accepted that the person in front of him was Esau. Isaac then blessed Jacob with the blessing that was meant for Esau. Genesis 27:28–29 states Isaac's blessing: [...] "Therefore God give thee of the dew of heavens, and the fatness of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine: [...] Let people serve thee: be lord over thy brethren, and let thy mother's sons bow down to thee: cursed be every one that curseth thee, and blessed be he that blesseth thee." ...|$|E

In January 2017, HIM were also announced as the headliner of Miljoona Rock, held in Tuuri, Finland, on 18 July 2017. On 5 March 2017, HIM announced the band would be disbanding following a farewell tour that same year. In the announcement, Valo stated: [...] "After quarter of a century [...] of love and metal intertwined we sincerely <b>feel</b> <b>HIM</b> has run its unnatural course and adieus must be said in order to make way for sights, scents and sounds yet unexplored. We completed the pattern, solved the puzzle and turned the key. Thank you." [...] Valo further elaborated on the band's decision to call it quits later, stating: [...] "We got together and started playing some songs and thinking whats next [...] We felt like the new material wasn't taking flight. We got along well together, but something was lacking. The stars weren't in alignment." [...] He also went on to say that: [...] "We felt like {{there was nothing left to}} give collectively. It was fun playing the old songs, everybody got along well together, but that spark was missing." [...] Valo didn't rule-out the possibility of the band reuniting in the future, stating: [...] "The good thing about this is that there's no drama [...] So it doesn't hurt the chances." ...|$|E

2500|$|Several album tracks gained notoriety {{within the}} {{entertainment}} industry, in particular [...] "Would You Mind" [...] {{due to its}} racy composition and explicit sexual content. Erotic Revolutionaries author Shayne Lee called the song [...] "a bold and proactive sexual maneuver for even a twenty-first century woman," [...] adding, [...] "she tells her man she's going to kiss, touch, lick, taste, bathe, ride, and <b>feel</b> <b>him</b> deep insider her. She ends the song by requesting that he come inside of her and let his juices flow deep in her passion." [...] Its shock value was considered [...] "enough to make Donna Summer's [...] "Love to Love You Baby" [...] sound like Christian rock." [...] Its explicit lyrics caused the album to be banned in several conservative countries such as Singapore. The song was used in films such as stoner comedy How High. Its [...] "gravity defying and mouth watering" [...] live rendition was regarded among the most controversial performances of her career. In 2012, it was ranked the steamiest song of her discography; an anecdote saying, [...] "This song is so racy people {{use it as a}} euphemism when talking about what they did the night before when children are present."

2500|$|... when Isaac {{was old and}} {{his sight}} had dimmed, he called Esau {{and asked him to}} hunt some game and prepare a dish, so that Isaac might give him his {{innermost}} blessing before he died. Rebekah had been listening, and when Esau departed, she instructed Jacob to fetch her two choice kids so that she might prepare a dish that Jacob could take to Isaac and receive his blessing. Jacob complained to Rebekah that since Esau was hairy, Isaac might touch him, discover him to be a trickster, and curse him. But Rebekah called the curse upon herself, insisting that Jacob do as she directed. So Jacob got the kids, and Rebekah prepared a dish, had Jacob put on Esau's best clothes, and covered Jacob's hands and neck with the kid's skins. When Jacob went to Isaac, he asked which of his sons had arrived, and Jacob said that he was Esau and asked for Isaac's blessing. Isaac asked him how he had succeeded so quickly, and he said that God had granted him good fortune. Isaac asked Jacob to come closer that Isaac might <b>feel</b> <b>him</b> to determine whether he was really Esau. Isaac felt him and wondered that the voice was Jacob's, but the hands were Esau's. Isaac questioned if it was really Esau, and when Jacob assured him, Isaac asked for the game and Jacob served him the kids and wine. Isaac bade his son to come close and kiss him, and Isaac smelled his clothes, remarking that he smelled like the fields. The fifth reading ( [...] , aliyah) ends here.|$|E
2500|$|After Badou Jack (21-1-2, 12 KOs) {{moved up}} to light heavyweight, on 19 June 2017, he {{revealed}} that his team were working towards a deal for him to fight Cleverly. He expected when the fight gets announced, it {{would be on the}} undercard of Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs. Conor McGregor in Las Vegas on 26 August 2017. On 19 July, according to sources, a deal was being close to being agreed from sides. On 27 July, [...] the World Boxing Association ordered Cleverly for fight undefeated WBA interim champion Dmitry Bivol (11-0, 9 KOs), which would eventually establish a mandatory challenger for 'super' champion Andre Ward. Both camps were given 30 days or it would go to purse bids. On August 9, Eddie Hearn confirmed that terms had been agreed for a fight between Jack and Cleverly. It was also reported that whether the WBA 'regular' title would be at state at this point was uncertain, as mandatory challenger Bivol was yet to agree a step aside fee. On 12 August, the WBA's Championships Committee granted special permission for the fight to be contested for their light heavyweight title. They also {{made it clear that the}} winner would need to negotiate a deal to fight Bivol by 11 September 2017. Cleverly lost the bout via 5th round stoppage, losing his WBA title in the process. Cleverly had some success in round 2, throwing and landing continuously without hurting Jack. In round 4, Jack piled the pressure on Cleverly, who left himself open and ended up with a bloodied nose. The end came with Cleverly against the ropes and Jack pounding him with combinations. Referee stepped in and called an end to the fight at 2 minutes and 47 seconds of round 5. At the time of stoppage, Jack had landed 172 punches of 442 thrown (39%), while Cleverly, who threw 409, only landed 82 punches (20%). In the post-fight, Jack said, [...] "I wanted to box him and <b>feel</b> <b>him</b> out while establishing my jab. Then the plan was to break him down from there. The plan was to finish him." [...] Cleverly stated that he suffered a broken nose in the third round. Jack also told Jim Gray of Showtime, “You can’t leave it in the hands of the judges. You have to go for the kill,” referring to his previous fight decisions.|$|E
