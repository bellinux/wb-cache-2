5|$|Abrams {{had been}} rumored as {{director}} since December 2006, and NBC confirmed this the following month. He and Buffy the Vampire Slayer creator Joss Whedon were both hired to direct an episode during February sweeps week. Abrams had known cast member Kate Flannery years before, {{when he used}} to write in a restaurant where Flannery worked as a waitress. The two were reunited on The Office set, where he stated that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>pleased</b> with her success.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{constitutional}} convention, {{it appeared that}} Garrard's political career was drawing to a close. He resigned all of his county offices to focus on {{his work in the}} Elkhorn Baptist Convention and his agricultural pursuits. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>pleased,</b> however, when his son William was chosen to represent the county in the state legislature in 1793. In 1795, William Garrard was reelected, and the other four state legislators from Bourbon County were close associates of Garrard's, including John Edwards, who had recently been defeated for reelection to the U.S. Senate.|$|E
5|$|Heidfeld {{was finally}} {{announced}} as Webber's 2005 teammate at the Williams season launch on 31 January, with Webber admitting <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>pleased</b> with the eventual decision. Webber's move to Williams brought about comparisons to Alan Jones, Australia's last F1 World Champion, {{also in a}} Williams. Expectations were high as Webber's former team boss Paul Stoddart predicted Webber would take his first victory in 2005 while Williams technical director Sam Michael said Webber would eventually win the World Championship with Williams.|$|E

5|$|On 10 January 2017, Dutch club SC Heerenveen {{confirmed}} that Ødegaard had joined them on loan for 18 months. He made his Eredivisie debut {{four days later}} in a 2–0 home win over ADO Den Haag, replacing Arber Zeneli in the last seconds. After the game, he spoke to Fox Sports about how <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>pleased</b> with his new surroundings. He scored his first goal for the Frisians on 18 May in his 15th appearance, a 3–1 home loss to FC Utrecht in {{the first leg of}} a play-off semi-final (5–2 aggregate).|$|E
5|$|Once, Veda {{left his}} ashram (hermitage), entrusting {{all of the}} {{administrative}} duties to Uttanka. Veda's wife was then in her menstrual period. The women of the ashram urged Uttanka to cohabit with her so that her fertility period would not be wasted, but Uttanka refused to oblige as he was duty bound to his guru and he considered the act immoral. When this episode was conveyed to Veda upon {{his return to the}} ashram, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>pleased</b> with his disciple and blessed Uttanka.|$|E
5|$|Series creator Rob Thomas {{included}} {{the scene in}} which Logan attacks Piz on his list of highlights from the third season. When Thomas first viewed the scene with his wife, she emitted an audible groan when she saw Logan walking through the cafeteria towards Piz, anticipating the fight {{that was about to}} come. Thomas thought that most fight scenes on the show were not well-done, as they are filmed quickly and without a second unit. However, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>pleased</b> with the final cut, stating that there was only one punch that he thought looked fake.|$|E

5|$|Stalin {{was aware}} that the Americans {{were working on the}} atomic bomb and, given that the Soviets' own rival program was in place, he reacted to the news calmly. The Soviet leader said <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>pleased</b> by the news and {{expressed}} the hope that the weapon would be used against Japan. One week {{after the end of the}} Potsdam Conference, the US bombed Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Shortly after the attacks, Stalin protested to US officials when Truman offered the Soviets little real influence in occupied Japan.|$|E
5|$|As {{cinematic}} {{director of}} The Battle for Middle-earth II, Richard Taylor {{was responsible for}} designing the game's opening and closing sequences, as well as campaign and mission introductions and endings. As the first Electronic Arts video game to be given free rein on material from The Lord of the Rings universe, several lands, characters, and creatures from the books appear visually {{for the first time}} in the game's cut scenes. Taylor considered it essential to use good graphical and audio combinations when telling a story, and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>pleased</b> to have Weaving on the project as the primary storyteller.|$|E
5|$|On 18 August 1917 McCudden scored {{his first}} victory as an {{official}} member of 56 Squadron over an Albatros D.V. Another the following day and two on 20 August raised his tally from 7 to 11 victories. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>pleased</b> with his success but berated the armourers for the frequent gun-stoppages. Over the next four weeks his machine suffered engine difficulties and gun-jams. He could only claim damaged enemy aircraft and once suffered a galling experience when the DFW C.V reconnaissance he was attacking holed his engine while his guns jammed. It had to be sent for major repairs. He received a new fighter, B4863, which then became his regular mount.|$|E

5|$|The {{start of}} his 2011 season saw him take a fourth {{consecutive}} national title over 60m with a European-leading time. At the 2011 European Athletics Indoor Championships the following month he was beaten to the line by Obikwelu, although <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>pleased</b> with the silver medal as he had changed his training to focus towards the 100m for that season. Four straight wins on the Brazilian Athletics Tour came {{at the beginning of}} his outdoor season in May, including a season's best of 10.01seconds, and he took his fifth national title at the British trials. At the 2011 World Championships he reached the 100m semi-finals but fell foul of the IAAF's new false start rule: he twitched in his blocks and was immediately disqualified.|$|E
5|$|When Harry Dean Stanton {{auditioned for}} Brett, he told Ridley Scott {{he was not}} a fan of science-fiction or horror films; Scott replied that he was not either, but {{expected}} Alien to do well. According to Stanton, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>pleased</b> with the film and said it and Pretty in Pink are the films for which he is best recognized. Several of Brett's scenes were deleted from the original cut, including Ripley and Parker seeing his death and his cocooned corpse in the Alien's lair; they were included in the 2003 director's cut. According to writer Dan O'Bannon, the latter scene hinted that Brett's body was becoming an Alien incubator.|$|E
5|$|All {{repair work}} on the New Orleans Arena was {{finished}} by March 2006, and a new scoreboard and video displays were added during the process. In June 2006, Shinn stated <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>pleased</b> with the ongoing recovery process in New Orleans and again reaffirmed his desire to permanently return for the 2007–08 season. However, the Hornets also announced {{that they were in}} the process of negotiating with Oklahoma City to play the 2007–08 season at the Ford Center as a contingency plan. The Hornets opened the 200607 season at New Orleans with a win over the Boston Celtics. They improved their final record from the previous season by one game, and again finished tenth in the Western Conference, three games out of the playoffs. Their attendance declined slightly compared to the previous season, and they finished 15th overall in attendance.|$|E

5|$|Gannon became {{manager of}} Stockport County, {{now in the}} National League North, {{for the third time}} in his career on 18 January 2016. Gannon started off well, taking the team to the Cheshire Senior Cup final and up to ninth in the table with a {{sequence}} of seven games unbeaten, including five victories, in the run up to Easter. County finished eighth in the 2016–17 season, one point outside the play-offs. Gannon was credited with turning around the career of Danny Lloyd, who signed for Peterborough United in May 2017, 12 months after Gannon had persuaded him to play for County rather than quit the game altogether. Gannon said that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>pleased</b> with his defence, but wanted to overhaul the attacking side so as to reach the play-offs the following season.|$|E
5|$|Harvard University offered Holst a lectureship for {{the first}} six months of 1932. Arriving via New York <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>pleased</b> to be reunited with his brother, Emil, whose acting career under the name of Ernest Cossart had taken him to Broadway; but Holst was dismayed by the continual attentions of press interviewers and photographers. He enjoyed his time at Harvard, but was taken ill while there: a {{duodenal}} ulcer prostrated him for some weeks. He returned to England, joined briefly by his brother for a holiday together in the Cotswolds. His health declined, and he withdrew further from musical activities. One of his last efforts was to guide the young players of the St Paul's Girls' School orchestra through one of his final compositions, the Brook Green Suite, in March 1934.|$|E
5|$|Kruger {{and others}} in the Transvaal {{government}} disliked Pretorius's unconstitutional dual presidency, and worried that Britain might declare the Sand River and Orange River Conventions void if the republics joined. Pretorius was told by the Transvaal volksraad on 10 September 1860 to choose between his two posts—to the surprise of both supporters and detractors he resigned as President of the Transvaal and continued in the Free State. After Schoeman unsuccessfully attempted to forcibly supplant Grobler as Acting President, Kruger persuaded him to submit to a volksraad hearing, where Schoeman was censured and relieved of his post. Willem Cornelis Janse van Rensburg was appointed Acting President while a new election was organised for October 1862. Having returned home, Kruger was surprised to receive a message urgently requesting his presence in the capital, the volksraad having recommended him as a suitable candidate; he replied that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>pleased</b> to be summoned but his membership in the Dopper Church meant he could not enter politics. Van Rensburg promptly had legislation passed to give equal political rights to members of all Reformed denominations.|$|E

5|$|The {{top three}} drivers {{appeared}} in Prince Rainier III of Monaco's Royal box to collect their trophies {{and in the}} subsequent press conference. Coulthard was delighted as securing victory at the Grand Prix which he considered {{as one of the}} races he wanted to win during his career because of the challenges the drivers take on the circuit. He also commented that he wanted to wait until the pit stop stages to get ahead of Michael Schumacher and Trulli to prevent unnecessary repairs to his car. Barrichello revealed that he was conserving his tyres and fuel, as well as being informed by Ferrari technical director Ross Brawn to reduce his pace towards the race's latter stages. Fisichella said that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>pleased</b> at taking third place. He also revealed that he wanted to remain at Benetton for the 2001 season after his strong result.|$|E
5|$|In 1962 Lord Evershed {{resigned}} as Master of the Rolls, and Denning {{was appointed to}} replace him on 19 April 1962 with a salary of £9,000. Although Denning himself described it as 'a step down' <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>pleased</b> with his appointment, as he had much preferred his time with the Court of Appeal than the House of Lords. Court of Appeal judges sit in threes, and the Lords in fives (or more), so {{it was suggested that}} to get his way in the Court of Appeal Denning only had to persuade one other judge whereas in the House of Lords it was at least two. The other 'benefit' of the Court of Appeal is that it hears more cases than the House of Lords, and so has a greater effect on the law. During his twenty years as Master of the Rolls, Denning could choose both which cases he heard, and the judges with whom he sat. Therefore, on most issues, he effectively had the last word; comparatively few cases went on to the House of Lords, which was at that time Britain's highest court of law.|$|E
5|$|Saturday's {{afternoon}} qualifying session {{lasted for}} an hour. Each driver {{was limited to}} twelve laps, with the starting order decided by the drivers' fastest laps. During this session, the 107% rule was in effect, which necessitated each driver set a time within 107% of the quickest lap {{to qualify for the}} race. The session was held in dry weather conditions. Michael Schumacher clinched his 28th pole position of his career, and his fourth at the circuit, with a time of 1:17.514. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Coulthard, who was three-tenths of a second off Michael Schumacher's pace. Häkkinen qualified third, and stated that his team made changes to his car's set-up having been unhappy with his car in previous sessions. Ralf Schumacher qualified fourth, and said <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>pleased</b> with revisions to his car's aerodynamics. Barrichello struggled with the handling of his car taking fifth position and stated that Coulthard prevented him from setting a faster lap time. Frentzen, Fisichella, Button, Salo and Irvine rounded out the top ten positions. Wurz missed out on qualifying in the top ten by two-tenths of a second. Trulli qualified 12th having struggled with oversteer, ahead of Diniz, Alesi, Arrows driver Pedro de la Rosa and Villeneuve. Johnny Herbert for Jaguar qualified 17th despite spinning late in the session, and was followed by Zonta, Nick Heidfeld and Jos Verstappen. The Minardi drivers qualified last; Marc Gené outqualified his teammate Gastón Mazzacane by two-tenths of a second.|$|E
