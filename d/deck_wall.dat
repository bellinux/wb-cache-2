50|$|Koenig {{made use}} of the {{sandwiched}} steel <b>decking</b> <b>walls</b> to conceal insulation, wiring and pipes. By piercing the roof over the bathroom and utility core, Koenig effectively penetrates {{the very core of}} the house with the exterior components of light, water, and plants. This provides an acoustical buffer between living and sleeping areas and underscores the airy, natural feel of the house.|$|R
25|$|Officers {{and several}} civilians {{provided}} suppressive {{fire from the}} ground with small weapons and hunting rifles, forcing Whitman to stay low and fire through storm drains {{at the foot of}} the observation <b>deck's</b> <b>wall.</b> A police sharpshooter in a small plane was driven back by Whitman's return fire but continued to circle at a distance, seeking to distract Whitman and further limit his freedom to choose targets.|$|R
5000|$|The {{largest and}} most well known {{negative}} of interstitial spaces is a high first cost. [...] Adding more floors increases the amount of material used for floor <b>decks,</b> <b>walls,</b> etc. The construction expense becomes much larger when anything is added because it affects many other systems in the building. One main thing that increases {{is the amount of}} façade material necessary to cover the skin of the building. Depending on that material, the cost and time of construction could be largely inflated.|$|R
50|$|CSH #21 is {{arranged}} along a North-South axis with a carport on the North {{side and a}} fully glazed South side {{to take advantage of}} the best view and maximum sunlight for winter months. Koenig opted for a compressed ‘L’ shaped plan to establish a linear progression from the carport and entry through the living space and out to the garden. This compression is achieved by opaque, steel <b>decking</b> <b>walls</b> blocking the unattractive views towards the “scrubby hillside” on the West and Wonderland Park Avenue on the East.|$|R
50|$|Officers {{attempting}} {{to reach the}} tower were forced to move slowly and take cover often, but {{a small group of}} officers including Houston McCoy began making their way to the tower via underground maintenance tunnels.Officers and other persons shot at Whitman from the ground with small weapons and hunting rifles, forcing Whitman to stay low and fire through storm drains {{at the foot of the}} observation <b>deck's</b> <b>wall.</b> A police sharpshooter in a small plane was driven back by Whitman's return fire but continued to circle at a distance to distract Whitman and limit his freedom to choose targets.|$|R
50|$|Longspan (LH) and Deep Longspan (DLH) Steel Joists are {{relatively}} light weight shop-manufactured steel trusses {{used in the}} direct support of floor or roof slabs or <b>decks</b> between <b>walls,</b> beams, and main structural members.|$|R
50|$|Sycamore Pool, {{located in}} the One Mile Recreation Area. The pool was {{constructed}} in the late 1920s and provides a unique swimming experience because its concrete <b>decks,</b> <b>walls,</b> and bottom are built to contain Big Chico Creek as it flows through the park. A dam and fish ladder at one end allow control of the creek's flow. The dam is raised and lifeguards are present from Memorial Day to Labor Day of each year. Above the fish ladder there is a bridge that separates the pool and the creek, from which many locals feed sucker fish {{in the bottom of}} the fish ladder. Locals often refer to Sycamore Pool simply as One Mile.|$|R

40|$|In eastern Turkey, the ark-shaped {{structure}} (called the Durupinar ark) likewise contains neither wood nor petrified wood. The {{absence of}} wood or petrified wood {{is indicated by}} collections of 12 samples of rock from inside the supposed ark (the ???<b>deck,???</b> ???<b>walls,???</b> and the top side-edge or gunnel of the boat) as well as outside the supposed ark in the ???ribs??? of the boat. David Fasold was told by other investigators at the site that these rock samples were petrified wood. I made thin sections of each sample, and none is petrified wood. All were volcanic basalt or andesite. Therefore, all that exists as evidence for Noah???s ark is the broad boat-shaped outline. This evidence is circumstantial because its 515 -foot length matches the 300 -Egyptian-cubit length of Noah???s ark (Fasold, 1988). Nevertheless, casts or impressions of former wood planking and beams of the ark {{might be expected to}} be present, as at Sutton Hoo, if this ???ark-structure??? is truly a remnant of Noah???s ark...|$|R
50|$|Located at 145.33 km is a {{sandstone}} culvert. The culvert is arched, {{with stone}} wing <b>walls</b> <b>deck</b> and abutments. Internally arch and {{floor of the}} causeway is lined with cut and dressed stone.|$|R

50|$|The Brussels' Comic Book Route (or also The {{comic strip}} route in Brussels) is a path {{composed}} by several comic strip murals which <b>deck</b> the <b>walls</b> of several buildings throughout the inner City of Brussels {{as well as}} the neighborhoods of Laeken and Auderghem. The large comic strip murals show motifs of the most famous and popular Belgian comics, for instance The Adventures of Tintin, Lucky Luke, Gaston, Marsupilami and Gil Jourdan.|$|R
50|$|The floor joists, {{measuring}} 6 by 8 in, are decked with 2 by 4 in wood laid on edge {{forming the}} <b>deck.</b> The interior <b>walls</b> {{were lined with}} a protective wheel guard about one foot above the deck.|$|R
50|$|For {{the comfort}} of the 1,075 crewmembers and 2,200 {{embarked}} troops, all manned spaces and berthing areas are individually heated and air conditioned. Berthing areas are subdivided to provide semi-private spaces without adversely affecting efficiency. <b>Deck</b> and <b>wall</b> coverings are decorative but also serviceable and easy to maintain. Messing areas facilitate rapid dining in a restaurant atmosphere. Onboard recreational facilities include a Library Multi-Media Resource Center with Internet access, a weight room, and satellite television capabilities.|$|R
5|$|The {{sides of}} the conning tower were 11inches thick {{and it had a}} 3-inch roof of KNC. It had a {{communications}} tube with 8inch walls of mild steel down to the Transmitting Station on the middle <b>deck.</b> The <b>walls</b> of the signal tower were 8inches thick while it had a roof of 3inches of KNC armour. 2inch torpedo bulkheads were fitted abreast the magazines and shell rooms of 'A', 'X' and 'Y' turrets, but this increased to 4inches abreast 'P' and 'Q' turrets to compensate for their outboard location.|$|R

50|$|The overall {{impression}} is of a hillside village {{with a high}} degree of unity resulting from the repetitive use of pitched metal <b>deck</b> roofs, <b>walls</b> of white painted bagged cavity brick masonry and timber elements - pergolas, balustrades and lattice screens all stained dark brown. The broken profile of roofs scattered and staggered over the steep slope and the consequent changing perspective together with the remnant regrowth eucalypt vegetation reinforced by landscaping based on Australian native species providing shade and shadow to white washed walls all serve to visually enliven the courtyard spaces and pathways on the site.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} {{accommodate}} the troops, two cargo holds amidships had to be converted into accommodation facilities. This was achieved by dividing each hold into three decks, and then building a number of passageways along each <b>deck.</b> Along both <b>walls</b> of each passageway, bunk-beds tiered five high were installed, and since space was still at a premium, each bunk was only thirty inches wide.|$|R
50|$|OSB is a {{material}} with favorable mechanical properties {{that make it}} particularly suitable for load-bearing applications in construction. The most common uses are as sheathing in walls, flooring, and roof <b>decking.</b> For exterior <b>wall</b> applications, panels are available with a radiant-barrier layer pre-laminated to one side; this eases installation and increases energy performance of the building envelope. OSB also sees some use in furniture production.|$|R

40|$|The {{corrosion}} risk {{of stainless}} steel is more pronounced in chloride containing carbonated concrete than in salt enriched alkaline concrete. Therefore doubts had been existed that stainless steel is sufficiently sure in cracked concrete of parking <b>decks</b> and <b>walls</b> by the road side contaminated with de-icing salts. Cracks can carbonate quickly and are open for chloride penetration. Electrochemical corrosion potential measurements and corrosion tests on cracked beams, reinforced with welded stainless steel bars, could not confirm this assumption. Stainless steel reinforcement, licensed in Germany, is also suit for the very unfavourable case of highly chloride contaminated cracked concrete.

500|$|Cordelias main {{armament}} {{consisted of}} two BL 6-inch (152mm) Mk XII guns that were mounted on the centreline in the stern, with one gun superfiring over the rearmost gun. Her secondary armament consisted of eight QF [...] Mk IV guns, four on each side, one pair forward of the bridge, another pair abaft it on the forecastle deck {{and the other two}} pairs one deck lower amidships. For anti-aircraft defence, she was fitted with one QF 6-pounder [...] Hotchkiss gun. The ship also mounted two twin, above-water, mounts for [...] torpedoes, one on each broadside.

60|$|Most people, {{on finding}} {{themselves}} in a strange and empty room, are seized {{with a desire to}} explore the same, and observe from internal evidence what manner of man is the owner. Nowhere does character come out so clearly as in the decoration of one's private den. Many a man, at present respected by his associates, would stand forth unmasked at his true worth, could the world but look into his room. For there they would see that he was so lost to every sense of shame as to cover his books with brown paper, or <b>deck</b> his <b>walls</b> with oleographs presented with the Christmas numbers, both of which habits argue a frame of mind fit for murderers, stratagems, and spoils. Let no such man be trusted.|$|R
50|$|Eastland Mall {{was renamed}} Courtland Center in 1986. In August 1986, the former Woolco space was {{subdivided}} and occupied by Crowley's department store and additional stores: B. Dalton Booksellers, Kinney Shoes, Silverman's, The Limited, Beverly Jean Cosmetics, Connie Shoes, County Seat, <b>Deck</b> the <b>Walls,</b> D.O.C Optical, Foot Locker, Leroy's Jewelers Lechter Housewares, Rave women's clothing, Summit Stationers and Things Remembered. Summit Stationers also took some space formerly {{used by the}} former Gutman location. In the 1990s, JCPenney expanded its presence at the mall by moving its home goods into a space that had been vacated by Perry Drug Stores. The mall had 80 stores in 1994. Crowley's closed in 1997,c and the theaters added an expansion in November 1998 under the management of National Amusements.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Nowadays, natural fibre-thermoplastics {{composites}} (NFPC) are {{replacing the}} conventional wood and timber {{due to its}} lower cost, avoid deforestation, higher strength-to-weight ratio and resistant to termites. These composites can be utilized for non-structural components of a building system such as <b>decking,</b> <b>wall</b> cladding, floor tiles and window frame. A natural fiber/plastic composite was produced by extrusion molding process to create a wall cladding profile. The raw materials used for the composites are 40 % kenaf fibre and 60 % polypropylene (PP). These materials were compounded through a twin-screw extruder and then cut into pellets. The moisture content found in the kenaf/PP composites (KPC) pellets was 2. 89 %. Therefore, the pellets required to be oven dried every time right before entering the hopper of the extruder. The temperature along the barrel was set to 180 °C and the die head temperature is set to 165 °C. At {{the end of the}} extrusion molding process, pressurized air was used for cooling the profile. Then, samples of the wall cladding were taken back to the laboratory for product quality assurance. Measurements of the samples show that the product experiences 3 % of shrinkage in term of width and 1 % of shrinkage in term of thickness. Water absorption test indicates an increase of 13. 6 % of weight after 24 hours immersion of water. Impact strength test was also conducted on the wall cladding samples and the mean result was 2. 55 kJ/m. Tensile test on the extruded KPC product indicates a low tensile strength at 4. 51 MPa and tensile modulus of 205. 01 MPa. The sample also proven to be light weight as the density of the material was found to be 0. 618 g/cm...|$|R
