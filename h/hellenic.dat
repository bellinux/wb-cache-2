5|$|The <b>Hellenic</b> Naval Air Service {{must not}} be {{confused}} with the current aviation branch of the <b>Hellenic</b> Navy, which includes the helicopter-equipped Navy Helicopter Command (Διοίκηση Ελικοπτέρων Ναυτικού– ΔΕΝ) and the 353rd Naval Cooperation Squadron (353 ΜΝΑΣ), run jointly with the <b>Hellenic</b> Air Force.|$|E
5|$|In 1930 the Air Ministry {{was founded}} and the <b>Hellenic</b> Air Force was {{established}} as a unified independent branch of the <b>Hellenic</b> Armed Forces. Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos {{was sworn in as}} the first Air Minister and assigned the reorganisation of the branch to the veteran aviator Alexandros Zannas.|$|E
5|$|In 1971, the <b>Hellenic</b> Air Force ordered {{brand new}} F-4E Phantoms, with {{deliveries}} starting in 1974. In the early 1990s, the <b>Hellenic</b> AF acquired surplus RF-4Es and F-4Es from the Luftwaffe and U.S. ANG.|$|E

5|$|Beginning at 8:00 the {{following}} day, Revithi ran the marathon course on her own. Before starting, {{she had the}} town's only teacher, the mayor, and the city magistrate sign a statement testifying to the time she departed from the village. She ran the race at a steady pace and reached Parapigmata (the place where the Evangelismos Hospital stands today, near the Hilton Athens) at 13:30 (5½hours). Revithi {{was not allowed to}} enter Panathinaiko Stadium—her race was stopped in Parapigmata by a few Greek military officers whom she asked to sign her handwritten report to certify her time of arrival in Athens. She stated to the reporters that she wanted to meet Timoleon Philimon (the General-Secretary of the <b>Hellenic</b> Olympic Committee) to present her case. Historians believe that she intended to present her documents to the <b>Hellenic</b> Olympic Committee in the hopes that they would recognize her achievement. Neither her reports nor documents from the <b>Hellenic</b> Olympic Committee have been discovered to provide corroboration.|$|E

5|$|The first {{aviation}} {{units in}} the Greek Armed Forces were formed in June 1912. In the following Balkan Wars, the <b>Hellenic</b> Navy {{was the first in}} military history to use aircraft to track down and bomb the enemy fleet (1913). The Naval Air Service was officially established during the First World War and participated with the Allies in several missions over the Aegean. After participation in the Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922) a long period of peace followed during which the Naval Air Service was reorganized and upgraded, especially with the establishment of the State Aircraft Factory, which manufactured various types of aircraft. In 1930 the Naval Air Service was merged with the <b>Hellenic</b> Army Aviation and formed the third branch in the Greek Armed Forces, the <b>Hellenic</b> Air Force.|$|E

5|$|Among {{the notable}} finds is a golden plaque showing a snake curling on a staff, a <b>Hellenic</b> symbol of Eshmun. and a granite altar bearing {{the name of}} Egyptian Pharaoh Achoris {{uncovered}} in the Eshmun sanctuary. This gift attests to the good relations between the Pharaoh and the kings of Sidon.|$|E
5|$|In 1954, {{the tour}} company R.K. Swan invited Wheeler to provide lectures on the {{archaeology}} of ancient Greece aboard their <b>Hellenic</b> cruise line, {{which he did}} in 1955. In 1957, he then gave {{a guided tour of}} the archaeology of the Indian subcontinent for the rival tour company Fairways and Swinford. After Swans appointed him to the position of chairman of their <b>Hellenic</b> Cruise division, he made two fortnight tours a year, in spring and summer. In late 1969 he conducted the Swans tour to the Indian subcontinent, visiting the south and east of the republic as well as Ceylon. During this period, Wheeler had kept in contact with many of his friends and colleagues in India and Pakistan, helping to secure them work and funding where possible.|$|E
5|$|The Faculty of Arts and Humanities {{was formed}} in 1989 {{following}} the amalgamation of the faculties of Arts, Music and Theology. The faculty encompasses traditional disciplinary subjects, as well as less-common subjects such as <b>Hellenic,</b> Portuguese and Medieval Studies, and emerging disciplines such as Digital Humanities and Queer Studies.|$|E
5|$|Aristagoras {{had brought}} all of <b>Hellenic</b> Asia Minor into revolt, but evidently {{realised}} that the Greeks would need other allies {{in order to}} successfully fight the Persians. In the winter of 499 BC, he first sailed to Sparta, the pre-eminent Greek state in matters of war. However, despite Aristagoras's entreaties, the Spartan king Cleomenes I turned down the offer to lead the Greeks against the Persians. Aristagoras therefore turned instead to Athens.|$|E
5|$|By the mid-1960s, the F-84/F-84F was {{replaced}} by the F-100 Super Sabre and the RF-84F by the RF-101 Voodoo in USAF units, being relegated to duty in the Air National Guard. The last F-84F Thunderflash retired from the ANG in 1971. Three <b>Hellenic</b> Air Force RF-84Fs that were retired in 1991 were the last operational F-84s.|$|E
5|$|Eshmun was {{identified}} with Asclepius {{as a result}} of the <b>Hellenic</b> influence over Phoenicia; the earliest evidence of this equation is given by coins from Amrit and Acre from the third century BC. This fact is exemplified by the Hellenized names of the Awali river which was dubbed Asclepius fluvius, and the Eshmun Temple's surrounding groves, known as the groves of Asclepius.|$|E
5|$|In April 2011, {{the company}} {{agreed to a}} $2.8 million {{settlement}} with the U.S. government over violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act {{that had taken place}} between 2003 and 2005. Payments of $536,000 had been made to the <b>Hellenic</b> Telecommunications Organization in order to obtain purchase orders and had been inaccurately reported as sales commissions in Comverse's accounting.|$|E
5|$|Moreover, <b>Hellenic</b> Nomarchy {{points to}} the ongoing {{successful}} struggle of the Serbs against the Ottoman rule, which began in 1804. The author states that the Orthodox clergy was holding back the national aspirations of the Greek people, while the educated and dynamic elements of Greek society and the mercantile diaspora should return to Greece and join the movement of national liberation.|$|E
5|$|The war went {{badly for}} the ill-prepared Greeks; the only saving grace was the {{swiftness}} {{with which the}} <b>Hellenic</b> Army was overrun. By the end of April 1897, the war was lost. The worst consequences of defeat for the Greeks were mitigated by {{the intervention of the}} King's relations in Britain and Russia; nevertheless, the Greeks were forced to give up Crete to international administration, and agree to minor territorial concessions in favor of the Turks and an indemnity of 4million Turkish pounds.|$|E
5|$|A {{signature}} {{feature of}} Parthian architecture was the iwan, an audience hall supported by arches or barrel vaults and open on one side. Use {{of the barrel}} vault replaced the <b>Hellenic</b> use of columns to support roofs. Although the iwan was known during the Achaemenid period and earlier in smaller and subterranean structures, it was the Parthians who first built them on a monumental scale. The earliest Parthian iwans are found at Seleucia, built in the early 1st century AD. Monumental iwans are also commonly found in the ancient temples of Hatra and perhaps modeled on the Parthian style. The largest Parthian iwans at that site have a span of 15m (50ft).|$|E
5|$|Anson {{argues that}} some <b>Hellenic</b> authors {{expressed}} complex or even ever-changing and ambiguous {{ideas about the}} exact ethnic identity of the Macedonians, who were considered by some such as Aristotle in his Politics as barbarians and others as semi-Greek or fully Greek. Roger D. Woodard asserts {{that in addition to}} persisting uncertainty in modern times about the proper classification of the Macedonian language and its relation to Greek, ancient authors also presented conflicting ideas about the Macedonians. Any preconceived ethnic differences between Greeks and Macedonians faded by 148BC soon after the Roman conquest of Macedonia and then the rest of Greece with the defeat of the Achaean League by the Roman Republic at the Battle of Corinth (146 BC).|$|E
5|$|Aristagoras {{had brought}} all of <b>Hellenic</b> Asia Minor into revolt, but evidently {{realised}} that the Greeks would need other allies {{in order to}} fight the Persians. In the winter of 499 BC, he sailed to mainland Greece to try to recruit allies. He failed to persuade the Spartans, but the cities of Athens and Eretria agreed to support the rebellion. In the spring of 498BC, an Athenian force of twenty triremes, accompanied by five from Eretria, {{for a total of}} twenty-five triremes set sail for Ionia. They joined up with the main Ionian force near Ephesus.|$|E
5|$|As his father's second son, Alexander {{was third}} {{in line to}} the throne, after his father and elder brother, George. His {{education}} was expensive and carefully planned, but while George spent part of his military training in Germany, Alexander was educated in Greece. He joined the prestigious <b>Hellenic</b> Military Academy, where several of his uncles had previously studied and where he made himself known more for his mechanical skills than for his intellectual capacity. He was passionate about cars and motors, {{and was one of}} the first Greeks to acquire an automobile.|$|E
5|$|At 4.00 a.m. on 17 September, <b>Hellenic</b> {{components}} of the 1st Division Group raided mount Preslap, a key position housing Bulgarian artillery. The Greeks rapidly descended from Golo Bilo and then began climbing the cliffs of Preslap with their bare hands. The Preslap garrison proceeded to abandon their positions and retreat eastwards. Having lost their artillery cover forces at Zborsko followed their comrades in retreat. The Timok Division conquered Topolets and advanced towards Studena Voda and Preslap while the Morava and Yugoslav Divisions overran Koutskov Kamene. At the same time, the Drina and Danube Divisions seized Gradešnica along with the Poltsista and Besistsa peaks, then halted at Melinitsa.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War I in July 1914, Greece's pro-German monarch, Constantine I, decided to remain neutral. The Entente powers landed troops in Salonika in 1915, which {{was a source of}} tension between France and Greece. Ultimately, the French seized the <b>Hellenic</b> Navy on 19 October 1916 (see Noemvriana and National Schism). Kilkis was reduced to a skeleton crew and had the breech blocks for her guns removed to render them inoperable. All ammunition and torpedoes were also removed. Ultimately, a pro-Entente government replaced Constantine and declared war on the Central Powers. Kilkis, however, did not see active service with Greece's new allies, and instead was used solely for harbor defense {{until the end of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|Deligiannis mobilized the <b>Hellenic</b> Army, and the British Royal Navy {{blockaded}} Greece. The admiral {{in charge}} of the blockade was Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, who had been the first choice of the Greeks to be their king in 1863, and the First Lord of the Admiralty at the time was Lord Ripon, whose brother-in-law had been murdered in Greece 16 years before. This was not the last time that King George discovered that his family ties were not always to his advantage. Deligiannis was forced to demobilize and Trikoupis regained the premiership. Between 1882 and 1897, Trikoupis and Deligiannis alternated the premiership as their fortunes rose and fell.|$|E
5|$|During {{the six-month}} fight against Italy, the <b>Hellenic</b> army made {{territorial}} gains by eliminating Italian salients. Greece {{did not have}} a substantial armaments industry and its equipment and ammunition supplies increasingly relied on stocks captured by British forces from defeated Italian armies in North Africa. To man the Albanian battlefront, the Greek command was forced to withdraw forces from Eastern Macedonia and Western Thrace, because Greek forces could not protect Greece's entire border. The Greek command decided to support its success in Albania, regardless of the risk of a German attack from the Bulgarian border.|$|E
5|$|George's silver jubilee in 1888 {{was celebrated}} {{throughout}} the <b>Hellenic</b> world, and Athens {{was decorated with}} garlands for the anniversary of his accession on 30 October. Visitors included the Crown Prince of Denmark, the Prince and Princess of Wales, the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh, Grand Dukes Sergei and Paul of Russia, and Djevad Pasha from the Ottoman Empire, who presented the King with two Arabian horses as gifts. Jubilee events in the week of 30 October included balls, galas, parades, a thanksgiving service at the Metropolitan Cathedral of Athens, and a lunch for 500 invited guests in a blue and white tent on the Acropolis.|$|E
5|$|Gjirokastër is principally a {{commercial}} center with some industries, notably {{the production of}} foodstuffs, leather, and textiles. Recently a regional agricultural market that trades locally produced groceries has {{been built in the}} city. Given the potential of southern Albania to supply organically grown products, and its relationship with Greek counterparts of the nearby city of Ioannina, {{it is likely that the}} market will dedicate itself to organic farming in the future. However, currently trademarking and marketing of such products are far from European standards. The Chamber of Commerce of the city, created in 1988, promotes trade with the Greek border areas. As part of the financial support from Greece to Albania, the <b>Hellenic</b> Armed Forces built a hospital in the city.|$|E
5|$|In December 2014, the <b>Hellenic</b> Parliament did {{not approve}} the new President with the supermajority required, and so a snap {{election}} was called {{for the end of}} January 2015. A few days before the 2015 election took place, Tsakalotos was quizzed on Syriza's economic policies by a number of economists, debt campaigners and investment analysts at the London School of Economics. Tsakalotos said there was a need for fiscal space, meaning 6–7billion Euros a year to spend on an expansionary fiscal policy. He also said that they would cancel the austerity budgets already agreed with the European Union (EU) and International Monetary Fund (IMF), pay back the loans from the IMF and focus on rescheduling and writing off the loans from the EU.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, Gjirokastër, as a multiethnic city, {{retained}} its Greek character. In April 1939, Gjirokastër {{was occupied by}} Italy following the Italian invasion of Albania. In December 8, 1940, during the Greco-Italian War, the <b>Hellenic</b> Army entered the city and stayed for a five-month period before capitulating to Nazi Germany in April 1941 and returning the city to Italian command. After the capitulation of Italy in the Armistice of Cassibile in September 1943, the city was taken by German forces and eventually returned to Albanian control in 1944.|$|E
5|$|The Asia Minor Campaign was {{followed}} by a long period of peace during which both the <b>Hellenic</b> Army and Naval Aviation Services were reorganized and upgraded. From 1925 new types of aircraft of British and, mainly, French manufacture were delivered. At 1925, in co-operation with the British Company Blackburn Aircraft, the State Aircraft Factory (KEA) was set up in Phaleron, near Athens. The factory developed a number of aircraft that were designed by Blackburn Aircraft and built under license, like the two-seat torpedo carrier, T3A Velos and the KEA Chelidon, as well as the Armstrong Whitworth Atlas and the Avro 504. On the other hand, a new Naval Aviation school was established at Tatoi, Attica, in 1926.|$|E
5|$|The G- and H-class destroyers were a {{group of}} 18 destroyers built for the Royal Navy during the 1930s. Six {{additional}} ships being built for the Brazilian Navy when World War II began in 1939 were purchased by the British and named the Havant class. The design was a major export success with other ships built for the Argentine and Royal <b>Hellenic</b> Navies. They {{were assigned to the}} Mediterranean Fleet upon completion and enforced the Non-Intervention Agreement during the Spanish Civil War of 1936–39.|$|E
5|$|The German plan {{of attack}} was {{influenced}} by their army's experiences during the Battle of France. Their strategy {{was to create a}} diversion through the campaign in Albania, thus stripping the <b>Hellenic</b> Army of manpower for the defence of their Yugoslavian and Bulgarian borders. By driving armoured wedges through the weakest links of the defence chain, penetrating Allied territory would not require substantial armour behind an infantry advance. Once Southern Yugoslavia was overrun by German armour, the Metaxas Line could be outflanked by highly mobile forces thrusting southward from Yugoslavia. Thus, possession of Monastir and the Axios valley leading to Thessaloniki became essential for such an outflanking maneuver.|$|E
5|$|The borders {{were still}} not {{finalized}} in June 1880 when a proposal very favorable to Greece that included Mount Olympus and Ioannina was {{offered by the}} British and French. When the Ottoman Turks strenuously objected, Prime Minister Trikoupis {{made the mistake of}} threatening a mobilization of the <b>Hellenic</b> Army. A coincident change of government in France, the resignation of Charles de Freycinet and his replacement with Jules Ferry, led to disputes among the Great Powers and, despite British support for a more pro-Greek settlement, the Turks subsequently granted Greece all of Thessaly but only the part of Epirus around Arta. When the government of Trikoupis fell, the new prime minister, Alexandros Koumoundouros, reluctantly accepted the new boundaries.|$|E
5|$|The rise of Macedon, {{from a small}} kingdom at the {{periphery}} of classical Greek affairs to one which came to dominate the entire <b>Hellenic</b> world (and beyond), occurred {{in the span of}} just 25 years, between 359 and 336 BC. This ascendancy is largely attributable to the personality and policies of Philip II (r. 359–336 BC). In addition to utilising effective diplomacy and marriage alliances to achieve his political aims, Philip II was also responsible for reforming the ancient Macedonian army into an effective fighting force. The Macedonian phalanx became the hallmark of the Macedonian army during his reign and the subsequent Hellenistic period. His army and engineers also made extensive use of siege engines.|$|E
