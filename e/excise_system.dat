A single levan series could be induced in excised orchardgrass leaves, without any 1 -kestose accumulation, strongly suggesting that fructan synthesis occurs independently of 1 -SST activity. This elegant <b>excised</b> leaf <b>system</b> was used to study fructan metabolism regulation as affected by environmental conditions and exogenous sugar treatments. In contrast to the well-studied barley <b>excised</b> leaf <b>system,</b> fructan biosynthesis could not be rapidly induced in the light without exogenous sugar and only a limited fructan synthesis was observed in the dark with sugar. {{it can be concluded}} that both light and sugar are needed to achieve an optimal fructan synthesis. To induce fructan biosynthesis, sucrose could be replaced by a combination of glucose and fructose. Fructans were found to be a surplus pool of sucrose when a threshold sucrose concentration is surpassed. A metabolic switch to fructan degradation was observed when induced orchardgrass leaves were incubated in the dark at 30 degrees C. Interestingly, fructans persisted during senescence of sugar-induced orchardgrass leaves.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In 2012, Uzbekistan {{ratified}} the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, {{which states that}} price and tax measures are {{an effective means of}} reducing tobacco consumption. We aimed to explore the effect of taxation policies on revenues and cigarette consumption. METHODS: Data on tax rates, revenues, cigarette sales were taken from national reports. To forecast potential revenues, a scenario analysis was performed. RESULTS: In 1991 - 2004, ad valorem <b>excise</b> <b>system</b> was in place in Uzbekistan, which was later replaced by the specific <b>excise</b> <b>system.</b> In 1997 - 2011, the nominal average excise has increased by a factor of twenty, but in real terms, after a sharp increase in 1999, average excise declined annually and increased only in 2010 - 2011. Annual cigarette sales per capita of adult population in 1999 - 2007 constituted 17 - 25 cigarette packs, while in 2008 - 2011 it increased to 30 - 37 packs. Four scenarios of excise tax increases in 2012 were developed: one actual scenario based on the rates effective in Uzbekistan in 2012, and three hypothetical ones anticipating excise rates increase by 1. 5, 2 and 3 -fold. With actual excise increase in 2012, the inflation-adjusted budget revenues would grow by 5 %, and with three hypothetical - by 17 %, 35 % and 66 % respectively, despite the decline of tax-paid cigarette sales. CONCLUSION: Stabilization or reduction in cigarette excises in Uzbekistan in 2002 - 2008 led to a decline in real excise revenues and the growth of cigarette sales. In 1999 and 2010 - 2011, excises were significantly increased and the real revenues have risen, despite the decline in cigarette sales. As cigarette prices are low, the illegal outflow of cigarettes from Uzbekistan apparently exceeds the illegal inflow. A significant increase in cigarette excise (1. 5 - 3 fold) can both increase budget revenues and reduce cigarette consumption, with greater increase yielding more benefits...|$|E

40|$|Introduction In October 2015, tobacco {{corporations}} arranged “price wars” in Ukraine by decreasing maximum retail cigarette prices, while specific excise {{was increased}} by 40 % since January 2016. In Moldova, the industry decreased prices of some brands by 20 - 30 % in December 2014, when government presented {{plans to increase}} excises. We estimate price wars' impact on tobacco consumption and revenue. Material and Methods Monthly data on cigarette prices, excise revenues, and cigarette sales were collected and analyzed. Results In October 2015 –February 2016, average cigarette prices in Ukraine decreased by 11 %. For some brands, total tax exceeded the price. Despite increased excise, price wars made cigarettes cheaper, consequently, their sales increased. Price wars were beneficial for the governmental excise revenue because Ukraine applies an <b>excise</b> <b>system</b> with a minimum specific tax floor. In 2016, tobacco excise revenue was 49 % higher than in same period of 2015, while excise rate increased by 40 %. In Moldova, {{in the first quarter}} of 2015 average cigarette prices decreased by 9 % and the excise revenue declined by 35 %. The government of Moldova planned to increase both specific and ad valorem rates, but after the “price war” it increased the specific rate but decreased ad valorem rate. Conclusions The tobacco industry uses “price wars” to keep customers and to press governments to adopt profitable excise rates. Tobacco companies can set price wars as they have right to determine maximum retail selling prices. If a country uses “maximum retail prices” to calculate ad valorem excise, regulations should prohibit downward changes of such prices...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Tobacco {{taxes are}} one of the most {{effective}} ways to reduce tobacco use. Transnational tobacco companies (TTCs) claim they wish to develop and secure excise systems that benefit both governments and the profitability of the companies themselves. The objective of the paper is to use the case of Ukraine, with its inconsistent history of excise tax changes in 1992 - 2008, to explore tobacco industry taxation strategies and tactics, and their implications for governmental revenues. Methods Details of tobacco industry policy on tobacco taxation in Ukraine were obtained by searching tobacco industry internal documents and various published reports. Results Even before entering the market in Ukraine, TTCs had made efforts to change the <b>excise</b> <b>system</b> in the country. In 1993 - 1994, TTCs lobbied the Ukrainian Government, and succeeded in achieving a lowering in tobacco tax. This, however, did not produce revenue increase they promised the Government. In 1996 - 1998, Ukrainian authorities increased excise several times, ignoring the wishes of TTCs, caused significant growth in revenue. Due to TTCs lobbying activities in 1999 - 2007 the tax increases were very moderate and it resulted in increased tobacco consumption in Ukraine. In 2008, despite the TTCs position, excise rates were increased twice and it was very beneficial for revenues. Conclusions The Framework Convention on Tobacco Control includes provisions both on tobacco taxation policy and on protection of public health policy from vested interests of tobacco industry. This paper provides arguments why tobacco taxation policy should also be protected from vested interests of tobacco industry. TTCs taxation strategy appears to be consistent: keep excise as low as possible. Apparent conflicts between TTCs concerning tax structures often hide their real aim to change tax structures for competing interests without increasing total tax incidence. Governments, that aim to reduce levels of tobacco use, should not allow tobacco companies to influence the development and implementation of tobacco taxation policy. </p...|$|E
