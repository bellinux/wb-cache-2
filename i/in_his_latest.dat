25|$|Having contributed {{directly}} to L'Indépendence Roumaines success (it became the second-most popular newspaper by 1897), Claymoor made a return trip to Paris in 1899. He died in Bucharest on June 12, 1903, after falling {{down in front}} of L'Indépendence Roumaine office, just as he was bringing <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>latest</b> Carnet chronicle. Although he is sometimes assumed to have died there, on the spot, he actually did so at his sister's home. The ultimate cause of death was a peptic ulcer. Claymoor was buried at Bellu cemetery, Plot 17. His objets d'art were auctioned off by January 1904, but the Almanach du High-Life continued to be published over the following years.|$|E
25|$|He {{started writing}} {{at the age of}} 17 in a school {{magazine}} and attained stylistic maturity <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>latest</b> works. He signed many of his works with the pseudonym Emil Leon. He often depicted rural environments of his native Upper Carniola, in which he saw a genuine and healthy counterpart to the somehow degenerate urban life. His most important work is Visoška kronika (The Visoko Chronicle), a short historical novel set in the period after the Thirty Years' War in the 17th century. Another important work is Cvetje v jeseni (Blossoms in Autumn), a novel of a middle age urban dweller who moves to the countryside, where he {{falls in love with a}} younger girl.|$|E
25|$|Although {{another plane}} was {{prepared}} for the passengers, Gleason {{had had enough of}} flying. He went into downtown Tulsa, walked into a hardware store, and asked its owner to lend him $200 for the train trip to New York. The owner asked Gleason why he thought anyone would lend a stranger so much money. Gleason identified himself and explained his situation. The store owner said he would lend the money if the local theater had a photo of Gleason <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>latest</b> film. But the publicity shots showed only the principal stars. Gleason proposed to buy two tickets to the movie and take the store owner; {{he would be able to}} see the actor in action. The two men watched the movie for an hour before Gleason appeared on screen. The owner gave Gleason the loan, and he took the next train to New York. There he borrowed $200 to repay his benefactor.|$|E

500|$|He wrote several books, {{among them}} the {{controversial}} memoir ...slik jeg ser det ("...the way I see it", 1975), in which he strongly attacked Gerhardsen. He also wrote a two-volume biography of his mentor Martin Tranmæl, Et bål av vilje and Veiviseren ("A Beacon of Resolve", 1988 and [...] "The Pathfinder", 1991). <b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>latest</b> book, released in 2008 at 103 years of age, being traditionally a strong proponent of cooperation with the United States, he called for enhanced security cooperation between the Nordic countries and argued Norway should buy the Swedish JAS Gripen aircraft instead of the US-made Joint Strike Fighter.|$|E
500|$|Following {{a five-year}} sabbatical, he {{returned}} with Julie Ganapathi (2003). The film {{was based on the}} psychological thriller novel Misery by Stephen King. According to Mahendra, Julie Ganapathi was made on the lines of his previous films Moondram Pirai (1982) and Moodu Pani (1980). A review from Rediff.com stated, [...] "Balu Mahendra has kept the flag of sensible cinema within the commercial format once again <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>latest</b> offering Julie Ganapathy" [...] and rated the film {{as one of the best}} thrillers ever made. In spite of being a critical success, the film turned out to be a commercial failure. For his next film Adhu Oru Kana Kaalam (2005), he decided to cast Dhanush in the lead role. Initially he stated that the film to be an extension of his 1979 film Azhiyatha Kolangal. However, he ended up making a different film. The film was loosely based on his own Malayalam film Yathra released in 1985. When asked about the difference between the two films, he said [...] "Yatra was the love story of two adults, this is the love story of two adolescents." [...] Shobha Warrier of Rediff.com wrote that the film was [...] "extremely disappointing".|$|E
500|$|The {{placement}} of the genus Rhodotus in the order Agaricales is uncertain, and various authors have offered solutions to the taxonomic conundrum. In 1951, Agaricales specialist Rolf Singer placed Rhodotus in the Amanitaceae because of similarities between the tribes Amaniteae and Rhodoteae, such as spore color and ornamentation (modifications of the spore wall that result in surface irregularities), structure of the hyphae and trama, and chlamydospore production during culture growth.In 1953, French mycologists [...] Robert Kühner and Henri Romagnesi placed Rhodotus in the family Tricholomataceae—a traditional [...] "wastebasket taxon"—on the basis of spore color. In 1969, Besson argued for the {{placement of}} Rhodotus with the Entolomataceae after studying the ultrastructure of the spores. By 1986, Singer had revised the placement of Rhodotus <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>latest</b> edition of The Agaricales in Modern Taxonomy, noting that [...] "It has formerly been inserted in the family Amanitaceae but is obviously closer to tribus Pseudohiatuleae of the Tricholomataceae." [...] Tribe Pseudohiatuleae included such genera as Flammulina, Pseudohiatula, Cyptotrama, and Callistodermatium. In 1988, a proposal was made to split the Tricholomataceae into several new families, including a family, Rhodotaceae, to contain the problematic genus.|$|E

500|$|Frazier Moore of Associated Press wrote, [...] "He plays {{this latest}} late-night {{conflagration}} {{right down the}} middle. He keeps the story moving almost cinematically, crosscutting from one personality to another, deftly and revealingly presenting different points of view." [...] Writing for BusinessWeek, Jim Windolf gave the book a rating of three stars {{out of a possible}} five, and commented, [...] "Bill Carter has become the Bob Woodward of the 11:35 time slot." [...] Paula Duffy of HULIQ News described the book as [...] "a juicy tell-all". Dylan Stableford of TheWrap called the book [...] "a must-read" [...] for fans of Conan O'Brien. Jeff Simon of The Buffalo News called the book a [...] "definitive history" [...] of the 2010 Tonight Show conflict. Willa Paskin wrote for New York Magazine that Carter, [...] "spoke with enough people involved in the situation to provide an account so detailed, it even includes re-created conversations and dialogue". Neal Justin of Star Tribune commented on the author's neutrality in his writing style, [...] "The next time network TV executives stumble into an ugly behind-the-scenes battle, they should consider hiring Bill Carter to negotiate.

500|$|In France, Anne was a maid of honour to Queen Mary, {{and then}} to Mary's 15-year-old {{stepdaughter}} Queen Claude, with whom she stayed nearly seven years. In the Queen's household, she completed her study of French and developed interests in art, fashion, illuminated manuscripts, literature, music, poetry, and religious philosophy. She also acquired knowledge of French culture, dance, etiquette, literature, music, and poetry and came to gain experience in flirtation and the game of courtly love. Though all knowledge about Anne's experiences in the French court are conjecture, even Eric Ives, <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>latest</b> edition of the biography, conjectures that she was likely to have made the acquaintance of King Francis I's sister, Marguerite de Navarre, a patron of humanists and reformers. Marguerite de Navarre was also an author in her own right, and her works include elements of Christian mysticism and reform that verged on heresy, though she was protected by her status as the French king's beloved sister. She or her circle may have encouraged Anne's interest in reform, {{as well as in}} poetry and literature. Anne's education in France proved itself in later years, inspiring many new trends among the ladies and courtiers of England, and it may have been instrumental in pressing their King toward the culture-shattering contretemps with the Papacy itself. Eric Ives's latest version of his biography hypothesises that Anne may have had evangelistic conviction and a strong spiritual inner life. William Forrest, author of a contemporary poem about Catherine of Aragon, complimented Anne's [...] "passing excellent" [...] skill as a dancer. [...] "Here", he wrote, [...] "was [...] fresh young damsel, that could trip and go." ...|$|E
