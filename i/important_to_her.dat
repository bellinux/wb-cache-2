I love being in bed and writing lyrics, and having my dog Jet and my kitty Dash on the bed. Anyway, we finally finished the lyric, then we completed the demo.|$|E

5|$|For the actress, having Chloe {{become part}} of the meteor {{infected}} community in season six allowed Mack's character to continue to evolve. Mack views this transition as a means for her character to become more emotionally connected to those people—the meteor infected—she spent five seasons trying to expose to the public. Being infected by the meteors gives Chloe motivation to try to understand them and allows her to grow closer to Clark, as she can better understand {{what it feels like to}} live in a world where you have a special ability. Writer Holly Harold believes that, in addition to being infected by the meteor rocks, bringing Lois into the journalistic field also provides Chloe with a lot of ammunition for growth and development. Lois's presence at the Daily Planet allows Chloe the chance to reflect upon herself, and discover what things are most <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> – her career or her family and friends. The competition that Lois provides is beneficial, as it gives Chloe a chance to bring out the best in herself.|$|E

It proved to be a headquarters for activities of women students as well as for alumnae.|$|E

30|$|Many novel {{molecular}} {{targets for}} anticancer treatment have been discovered. Targeting of HER 2 with the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab is a well-established therapeutic strategy for HER 2 -positive {{breast cancer in}} neoadjuvant [1], adjuvant [2], and metastatic settings [3].

After her marriage, Lewis's research was always fitted around the travel commitments associated with her husband's work on tropical diseases, which resulted in a wide and eclectic selection of research topics. They moved to the Sudan, where he was posted; there Lesley Lewis worked at the Agricultural Research Institute at Wad Medani as librarian and clerk, studying law by correspondence course in her spare time. She and her husband returned to London in 1955, after Sudan became independent from Britain. She was called to the Bar in 1956, becoming one of the earliest female members of Lincoln's Inn; although she did not practise, her legal training was <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> subsequent conservation work.|$|E

She has {{prosthetic}} legs, having had her original legs amputated below the knees {{as a result}} of a car accident. Despite her disability, she still has more than enough lower body strength to walk, and in fact she is a successful track runner. She values good diet and exercise, and is on friendly terms with the head nurse of Yamaku; she promises to keep tabs on Hisao's exercise in exchange for having him as a running partner. Indeed, she meets Hisao by literally running into him in the hallway, and ironically endangers his heart on more than one occasion. Hisao feels guilty whenever she pouts, equating her expression to that of a sad puppy. Emi is Rin's friend and hall mate due to both having extremely passionate vocations and complementary disabilities. However, she has trouble getting emotionally close to people, because she is afraid of losing people <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E

50|$|It is <b>important</b> <b>to</b> {{highlight}} <b>her</b> {{theoretical approach}} that is between the politically performative theory and activist criticism and theory in action. This means that the Gržinić's position is not a disengaged area of interpretation that derives from theoretical and philosophical contemplation but that her work in philosophy, theory and arts derives from concrete theoretical practice and interventions and related cultures.|$|R
25|$|Natsuki is {{a friend}} and classmate of Kanade; {{something}} that they both share in common is their shy nature. Because Natsuki barely talks at all, and is usually emotionless, {{it is difficult to}} tell what she is thinking. The most <b>important</b> person <b>to</b> <b>her</b> is Kanade, her only friend. In Your Diary +, she is promoted to a heroine from a sub-character.|$|R

Rebecca Oppenheimer also recalled Rubin's mentorship as <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> early career.|$|E
