40|$|The {{objective}} of this project {{was to examine the}} economic properties of <b>input</b> <b>taxes</b> and alternative production technologies as instruments for controlling non-point source pollutants. A theoretical analysis demonstrates that <b>input</b> <b>taxes</b> have the economic properties of residuals charges. The use of alternative production technologies is not a promising method for controlling effluents when compared with pollution <b>taxes.</b> Even though <b>inputs</b> may be used more efficiently with new production technologies, controlling technology does not control the quantity of inputs used. The empirical research on nitrate-nitrogen controls in the southern San Joaquin Valley confirms the interchangeable nature of <b>input</b> <b>taxes</b> and residuals charges. Some evidence supporting the second hypothesis was also found since the social costs of requiring sprinkler irrigation were nearly twice the social cost of an equivalent sprinkler penalty.

40|$|Like {{the theory}} of the second best that the 2006 {{congress}} marks, the VAT is now fifty years old. Judged by the extent and speed of its spread around the world, and the revenue that it raises, the VAT would seem to have been a remarkable success. Over the last few years, however, it has come under a series of attacks. This paper considers three of the most prominent of these. One is the fear (raised mainly in the United States) that the VAT actually does too good a job of raising tax revenue. The second is the view that the VAT does a bad job of taxing the informal sector-and that tariffs might be a better revenue-raising instrument for many developing countries. The third attack is the most literal, by criminals rather than theorists: in the European Union and elsewhere, sophisticated VAT fraud, targeting its refund provisions, has become a serious concern.

40|$|Graduation date: 1990 Technological {{advances}} in agricultural production {{over the past}} 40 years {{have contributed to the}} high standard of living enjoyed by many in the United States. Extensive use of chemicals to enhance yield and improve crop quality has {{played a major role in}} creating this highly productive U. S. agricultural system. Increased chemical use has imposed some significant environmental costs. One environmental concern receiving increased attention is pollution of groundwater by nitrates. The objective of this dissertation is to examine the economic effects on an irrigated Columbia Basin farm of adopting alternative strategies that reduce agricultural-related groundwater pollution from nitrates. The research involved the development and implementation of a multi-method approach which linked a farm-level linear programming crop mix model, field-level dynamic optimization models, crop simulators, and a geohydrology model of ground water nitrate movement. The analysis focused on optimal irrigation and nitrogen fertilizer scheduling for winter wheat, field corn, and potatoes, the principal crops in the study area, given the presence of various groundwater regulatory options. These options included <b>input</b> <b>taxes,</b> restriction on nitrogen applications, restrictions on nitrate leachate, and Pigovian taxes. The analysis also examined the relationships between the physical environment and the economic factors affecting nitrate pollution. The results of the dynamic optimization and linear programming models provide some important insights into the problem of nitrate pollution. First, careful management of soil moisture is critical to the reduction of pollution rates. Second, some nitrate leachate is unavoidable in the production of irrigated crops within the study area. Third, weather events play a significant role in explaining the existence of nitrate leachate under optimal irrigation and fertilization practices. Fourth, <b>input</b> <b>taxes</b> and restrictions on nitrogen application rate may not always reduce pollution rates. Fifth, Pigovian taxes appear to be the most efficient means of reducing nitrate levels, although they would be difficult to impose. Finally, federal government farm program provisions relating to price supports increase pollution rates and idlement requirements reduce pollution rates...|$|R

40|$|Research on nonpoint {{pollution}} control instruments has {{focused primarily on}} incentives applied either to production inputs that affect nonpoint pollution, or to ambient pollution concentrations. Both approaches may in theory yield an efficient solution. However, input-based incentives will generally have to be second-best to make implementation practical. Design issues include which inputs to monitor and the rates to apply to them. The limited research indicates that second-best, input-based incentives can be effective in adjusting input use in environmentally desirable ways. Alternatively, ambient-based incentives have theoretical appeal because efficient policy design appears to be less complex than for input-based incentives. These incentives have no track record nor close analogues that demonstrate potential effectiveness, however. Research on how households and firms might react in response to ambient-based incentives is needed before these instruments can be seriously considered.

40|$|The {{study is}} devoted to the {{comparative}} static analysis and econometric estimation of farm household decisions under both standard and agricultural taxes. Accounting for labor market constraints a non-separable model is constructed implying increasing per-unit costs of accessing labor markets. To control for tax-induced adjustments related to labor market imperfections we compare the results to those derived from a separable approach, assuming perfect labor markets. Theoretical results suggest that most tax-induced responses are ambivalent mainly caused by shadow prices effects. Further, tax-induced effects differ between the two model versions. In particular standard taxes may imply production adjustments in the case of non-separability. Thus, income and value-added taxes are no more necessarily superior to agricultural taxes.

40|$|Most {{economists and}} analysts claim that {{extended}} use of pollution charges in environmental policy will have substantial efficiency advantages in countries undergoing transition to market economies. Essentially this paper challenges this view {{and argues that}} the proposed policy presumes {{the existence of an}} already functioning institutional framework. By focusing on the Russian case, the paper identifies and discusses a number of reasons why it has become hard to implement pollution charges in an economic system where behavioral patterns and jurisdictions established in the past are still prevalent. Institutional obstacles both at the firm level and within Russian regulatory agencies are discussed. The paper concludes that it is probably more appropriate to view environmental problems in transition economies not as market imperfections per se, but as results of institutional inertia in the economic and political systems. As a consequence the choice of pollution control strategy becomes much more complex than is implied by economic theory.
