5|$|Following the {{conclusion}} of the regular season and prior to North Carolina's acceptance of the invitation to play in the Gator Bowl, Tar Heels head coach Mack Brown received an offer from the Texas Longhorns to become that school's head coach. A <b>day</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> after Texas extended the offer, Brown resigned his position as North Carolina's head coach and accepted the Texas job. He replaced John Mackovic, who was fired three days earlier after finishing the season with a 47 record.|$|E
5|$|It rained for {{the next}} <b>day</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half,</b> {{preventing}} battle. During this time, Baum's men constructed a small redoubt at {{the crest of the}} hill and hoped that the weather would prevent the Americans from attacking before reinforcements arrived. Stark sent out skirmishers to probe the German lines, and managed to kill thirty Indians in spite of the difficulties of keeping their gunpowder dry. Reinforcements for both sides marched out on the 15th; travel was quite difficult due to the heavy rains. Burgoyne sent 550 men under Heinrich von Breymann, while Warner's company of about 350 Green Mountain Boys came south from Manchester under Lieutenant Samuel Safford's command.|$|E
5|$|On April 18, 1989, a {{group of}} 39 women went into the Pittston Coal {{headquarters}} and held a 36â€‘hour sit-down strike. The women stated {{that they would not}} leave until a contract was signed. When questioned by police and media reporters to give up their names, the women responded by saying that they were daughters of Mother Jones. The Daughters gained the attention of the media and completely halted production at Pittston for an entire <b>day</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half.</b> The women involved were not members of the UMWA but wanted to support their cause, and due to this they were linked to the UMWA and considered by some {{to be a part of}} the union.|$|E

5|$|Several {{other factors}} {{complicated}} {{the rise of}} nationalism in the German states. The man-made factors included political rivalries between members of the German confederation, particularly between the Austrians and the Prussians, and socio-economic competition among the commercial and merchant interests and the old land-owning and aristocratic interests. Natural factors included widespread drought in the early 1830s, {{and again in the}} 1840s, and a food crisis in the 1840s. Further complications emerged {{as a result of a}} shift in industrialization and manufacturing; as people sought jobs, they left their villages and small towns to work during the week in the cities, returning for a <b>day</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> on weekends.|$|E
5|$|Australia had {{proceeded}} {{through the}} first two months of their tour of England undefeated. After winning 10 of the first 12 gamesthe other two being drawneight of these by an innings, they won the First Test by eight wickets. Between the Tests, they defeated Northamptonshire by an innings before drawing against Yorkshire. They crushed England by 409 runs in the Second Test at Lord's, Abefore defeating Surrey by ten wickets and crushing Gloucestershire by an innings and 363 runs, after amassing 774/7 declared, their highest score of the season. The Third Test was drawn amid rain interruptions that cost a <b>day</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> of play; England had been in a strong position, having been 316 runs ahead with seven wickets in hand in their second innings when rain came {{at the end of the}} third day. Australia proceeded to claim a ten-wicket triumph over Middlesex in their only county game before the Fourth Test.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, Danny Gardella, who {{had left}} the New York Giants for the Mexican League in 1946, filed suit against Major League Baseball, {{claiming}} Chandler's ban on players {{who went to the}} Mexican League had denied him a means of pursuing his livelihood. Gardella demanded $100,000 in damages from the suspension, and claimed that the award should be tripled because baseball was subject to federal antitrust laws. Similar suits were filed by Max Lanier and Fred Martin, both of whom also played in Mexico. On June 2, 1949, a federal court refused to reinstate the three players pending their trials, but urged that the antitrust issues be adjudicated as soon as possible. Attempting to alleviate the legal pressure on Major League Baseball, Chandler lifted the bans on players who had gone to Mexico, reinstating them almost two years early. Lanier and Martin dropped their suits, but Gardella pursued his. After Gardella's lawyer publicly questioned Chandler in court about baseball's antitrust exemption for a <b>day</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> in September 1949, baseball executives, including Chandler, agreed to settle Gardella's case for $60,000.|$|E

5|$|Other {{political}} stations {{include the}} likes of Galaxy FM, founded in the early 1980s and gaining a strong audience by the late 80's after becoming consistent reliable station broadcasting mostly on Fridays, weekends and Monday mornings. Galaxy FM did attempt to broadcast 24 hours on the FM briefly and did advertise for a short time, before returning to broadcasting mostly on Fridays, weekends and Monday mornings after 1992 with no profit making adverts. It was not until June 2012 Galaxy FM attempted to broadcast 24 hours {{a day on the}} FM again and deliberately continued to not use profit making advertisements to maintain the station. However, in late September/early October 2012 due to constant attacks from the authorities the station {{decided to go back to}} its original schedule, this time with an additional <b>day</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> of broadcasting per week; broadcasting on the FM from Thursday afternoons until Monday afternoons. Galaxy FM encourages the black population to liberate themselves through empowerment and self-reliance.|$|E

25|$|An unusual {{incident}} occurred on 13 September 1983, {{the last day}} of the 1983 County Championship season. Lancashire were playing Leicestershire, and rain had delayed the start of play by a <b>day</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half.</b> On the final afternoon, facing an attack consisting of David Gower (9â€“0â€“102â€“0) and James Whitaker (8â€“1â€“87â€“0), Lancashire openers Graeme Fowler and O'Shaughnessy both scored centuries: Fowler's in 46 minutes and O'Shaughnessy's in 35.|$|E

25|$|Play {{was only}} {{possible}} {{from the end of}} the second scheduled day, and both teams made heavy weather of bowling their opponents out.

The Commission also receives letters of recommendation and other background information on the candidates.

The normal budget for episodes during the first season were $185,000. Roddenberry later claimed that around $257,000 was spent on the episode, and said that he could have saved a further $20,000 if he had not insisted on high quality casting and sets. He also claimed that the original Ellison version would have cost a further $200,000 on top of what was already spent.|$|E
25|$|The pace of {{the trials}} was very fast before the standing-room-only, all-white audience. The judge and {{prosecutor}} wanted to speed the nine trials to avoid violence, so the first trial took a <b>day</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half,</b> and the rest took place one right after the other, in just one day. The judge had ordered the Alabama bar to assist the defendants, but the only attorney who volunteered was Milo Moody, a 69-year-old attorney who had not defended a case in decades. The judge persuaded Stephen Roddy, a Chattanooga, Tennessee, real estate lawyer, to assist him. Roddy admitted he had not had time to prepare and was not familiar with Alabama law, but agreed to aid Moody.|$|E
