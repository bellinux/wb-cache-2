40|$|The {{reactivity}} of cerebral blood vessels {{to changes in}} Paco 2 <b>in</b> <b>areas</b> of <b>the</b> cerebral cortex with or without diaschisis was investigated in 13 patients in a subacute or chronic stage after a small capsular infarct. A focal area of hypoperfusion (area of diaschisis) was detected <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ipsilateral sensorimotor cortex in each patient. Hyperventilation caused a significant reduction of regional cerebral blood flow <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>area</b> without diaschisis and only a tendency for regional cerebral blood flow to decrease <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>area</b> with diaschisis; CO 2 inhalation induced {{a slight increase in}} regional cerebral blood flow <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>area</b> without diaschisis and a significant increase in regional cerebral blood flow <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>area</b> with diaschisis. Regional cerebral blood flow reactivity to hypocapnia was significantly less <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>area</b> with diaschisis than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>area</b> without, whereas <b>the</b> hypercapnic response was more marked <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>area</b> with diaschisis than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>area</b> without. Our results suggest that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>area</b> with diaschisis, <b>the</b> arterioles may be abnormally vasoconstricted at rest such that they cannot constrict further in response to hypocapnia but can dilate more during hypercapnia than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>area</b> without diaschisis. This excessive resting vasoconstriction may result from decreased tissue elaboration of CO 2 due to local decrease of metabolic function. (Stroke 1988; 19 : 840 - 845...|$|R
