40|$|AbstractThe {{importance}} of structural metals for industrial applications {{is based on}} their superior combination of mechanical properties - strength, elongation, toughness and corrosion resistance – achieved at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>forming</b> processes. A numerical analysis for the prediction of microstructure is strongly required for the optimization of hot forming process parameters, because the microstructure of structural metals, which has the significant effects on mechanical properties, is strongly dependent to forming process conditions {{as well as the}} chemical composition. The off-line and on-line analyses of microstructure evolution are explained briefly, and the results of its application to hot strip rolling are presented. The linkage of microstructure analysis to kinetic property prediction of product is discussed, and finally, the remaining research topic, such as enlarging the analytical scheme to various alloys, is presented...|$|E
40|$|The {{architecture}} of a controller to enable process guidance in spin extrusion processes {{was developed in}} the project entitled "Process chains of bulk-metal forming under the consideration of productivity and environmental compatibility" which is sponsored by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (the German Research Association). The solution, in essence, consists of a model-based process planning module supported by the NC (CNC) itself, and components shaped as losed-loops for process control. Using these controlling components, we succeeded {{for the first time in}} creating a process uidance that is suitable for steel materials. It was possible to avoid the danger of buckling in the starting stage as uch as possible. As shown in the evaluation of results, the entire process is characterized by a strongly non-linear behavior which can be seen in disturbances that first appear in the starting stage, but act and also clearly increase until the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>forming.</b> The authors demonstrate the development of a process supervision strategy (algorithm) and the adaptation of a controller characteristic diagram derived from it...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis study {{deals with}} the {{mechanical}} behaviour and material modelling of an AA 5754 - 0 alloy at elevated temperature. Experimental shear tests were performed from room temperature up to 200 C and the material behaviour has been identi ed with both shear and tensile tests, {{as a function of}} temperature. To analyse the in uence of temperature during forming over springback, a split-ring test is used. Experimental results are obtained and compared to numerical simulations performed with the nite element in-house code DD 3 IMP. The numerical process of ring-splitting is performed with the inhouse code DD 3 TRIM. The main observed data are force-displacement curves of the punch during forming, cup thickness at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>forming</b> and ring gap after splitting. It is shown that all these parameters are strongly dependent on the forming temperature. A correlation is obtained between experimental data and numerical simulation for the evolution of punch force and opening after springback as a function of temperature. The distribution of the tangential stress in the cup wall is the main factor in uencing the springback mechanism in warm forming condition.

40|$|Introduction: а {{detailed}} {{investigation has}} been conducted within the frames of an integrated project and {{on the basis of}} a number of schools in 3 regional centers of Russian Federation, its goal presuming the search for psychological ways of refining the innovative education system. The set of the project’s objectives included analysis of the approaches to organization, implementation of innovative education as well as analysis of possible techniques of constructing pedagogical discourse. Маterials and Methods: this investigation presumed either open or hidden observation of the process of structuring and implementation of the education process, as well as observation of the pedagogical discourse, conducting the questioning of the schoolchildren, teachers, school administration and parents. Technical aids of video- and audio-registration were used in course of observations and questioning. The materials obtained were studies, and the conclusions drawn w ere generalized. Results: рithy material was obtained. Its analysis allows one to state that there are systemic problems in education and upbringing, and that there is the need to apply didactic approaches to the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>forming</b> mind, consciousness, feeling-sense sphere of mind and morality in schoolchildren. Discussion and Conclusions: definite approaches to solving these problems are discussed. It is exclusively important that refining the system of innovative education would follow the way of goal-oriented and systemic constructing confidential, correct and only under this circumstance truly innovative pedagogical discourse in class and outside the classroom. Such a discourse shall stimulate not only initiation of thinking activity of schoolchildren (as L. S. Vygotsky presupposed) but, first of all, formation of the feeling-sense sphere of mind, which is the basis for forming personally-valuable feelings, senses and moral orientations of schoolchildren. Formation of consciousness, self-dependence and business qualities of schoolchildren is possible only on such a fundamental basis. Only correctly formed, i. e. feeling-sense based upbringing, ideally and materially grounded education may guarantee high quality of education for schoolchildren, their formation as moral personaliti...|$|E
40|$|In {{sheet metal}} forming, the {{discrepancy}} between the fully loaded shape at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>forming</b> stage and the unloaded configuration is called springback. Springback is a major factor in preventing accurate dimensions of final products. Therefore, {{it is very important that}} springback be quantitatively predicted and compensated in the die design stage. In sheet metal stamping, especially when drawbead is used, the material experiences several cycles of bending-unbending-reverse bending. Therefore, in to order to accurately predict springback, the constitutive model must be able to accurately describe the material behaviour during cyclic loading. Yoshida-Uemori (YU) two-surface model is one of the most sophisticated models which is capable of reproducing the transient Bauschinger effect, permanent softening and workhardening stagnation. In this work, two different yield functions, i. e. Hill’s 1948 and Yld 2000 - 2 d, were used in conjunction with YU two-surface model. Moreover, two different numerical procedures were developed for numerical implementation of these models: a) a semi-implicit approach and b) a fully-implicit approach. The numerical procedures were used to develop user material subroutines for ABAQUS commercial software. Then, the subroutines were used to evaluate the capability of the model in prediction of springback for a channel draw process. In addition, the isotopic hardening (IH) and combined isotropic-nonlinear kinematic hardening (IH+NKH) models were also used to predict the springback of the problem. Finally, the springback profiles obtained by each model were compared with the experimental data. For DP 600, the error in springback prediction is around 3 % when YU model is used. For HSLA and AA 6022, the error associated with YU model is less than 3 % and 13 % at 25 % and 100 % drawbead penetrations, respectively. The YU model does not predict the springback accurately for AKDQ and the error is around 30 %. The results also show that the IH model overestimates the springback for all materials. For DP 600 and AA 6022, the results obtained by IH+NKH model are the same as those obtained by YU model. However, the YU model considerably improves the springback prediction compared to IH+NKH model for HSLA; while for AKDQ the IH+NKH model improves the springback prediction compared to YU model...|$|E
