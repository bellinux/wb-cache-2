40|$|International audienceModel dual-phase microstructures were {{developed}} to decouple the effect of martensite volume fraction and martensite hardness on the plastic behavior of <b>dual-phase</b> <b>steels.</b> The martensite volume fraction ranges from 11 % to 37 %, involving two levels of martensite hardness. The yield strength and tensile strength increase with increasing martensite volume fraction, while the uniform elongation decreases. The martensite hardness has a weak impact on the initial yield strength, but it significantly affects the flow behavior for sufficiently large martensite volume fraction. Increasing the hardness of the martensite leads to higher tensile strength combined with only a limited impact on uniform elongation, resulting in an improved strength/ductility balance. The experimental results are successfully captured using finite element based micromechanical analysis.
