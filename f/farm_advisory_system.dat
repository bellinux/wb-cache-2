This attribute is significant {{as far as a}} transformation of European agriculture is concerned which resulted in creating a <b>farm</b> <b>advisory</b> <b>system</b> for the territorial scope Europe. The effectiveness of the system depends on many factors mainly, however, on active trust of farmers in the knowledge they acquire. The case study uses a questionnaire data collecting method in the households of the Opole voivodeship. On their basis the place and aim of a farm advisory organisation in the system of both agricultural knowledge and information have been determined as well as kinds of knowledge sought by farmers. The respondents’ evaluation of the significance of this institutional structure in the development of households and in the local development has also been presented. 	A question of the use of regional internet platforms in the realisation of <b>farm</b> <b>advisory</b> <b>system</b> tasks has been considered.

40|$|By the {{beginning}} of 2007 Member States had {{to set up a}} system of advising farmers on land and farm management which should cover at least cross compliance requirements (the so-called <b>Farm</b> <b>Advisory</b> <b>System).</b> The report provides an overview on how Member States have set up the <b>Farm</b> <b>Advisory</b> <b>System</b> {{in the first year of}} its compulsory implementation. It describes and analyses the information acquired throughout a JRC questionnaire based survey in all Member States. The main topics presented are: the organisation of the system, the bodies that have been accredited to deliver advice, the funding support to farmers for the use of FAS, the way the advice is delivered, the priorities established for farmers and the number of holdings that may be concerned in the service.

40|$|The <b>Farm</b> <b>Advisory</b> <b>System</b> (FAS) {{has been}} {{established}} by all Member States in the EU since 2007. Advisory services provided within the FAS shall cover at least cross-compliance issues but Member States can extend them to topics that go beyond cross-compliance. This paper describes the main characteristics {{in the implementation of}} FAS in the Member States; as an example, it analyses the uptake of an agri-environmental scheme in an Italian region and discusses the relevance of extending FAS to assist farmers to implement agri-environmental measures (AEM). Yearly surveys carried out have showed that, even if FAS is differently operational in the Member States, the core approach is based on one-to-one advice on the farm mainly covering cross-compliance issues. Only in some Member States advice on agri-environmental issues within the FAS has been reported. In Lombardy Region the uptake of an agri-environmental measure on balanced fertilisation and crop rotation demonstrates how the participation of farmers within a geographically homogeneous area can be scattered. Therefore advisory services for agri-environmental measures can play an important role both in increasing farmers¿ awareness and in advising on agricultural practices that go beyond minimum cross-compliance requirements. At this regard the integration of these advisory services for AEM into the existing FAS should be promoted. JRC. DG. G. 3 -Monitoring agricultural resource...|$|E
40|$|Small-scale farming {{involves}} {{millions of}} {{households in the}} EU and {{plays an important role}} in the rural economy. A significant percentage of these farms produce commodities for the market. This productive dimension is often overlooked, however, as is the technical support needed by these farms. The privatization of national <b>farm</b> <b>advisory</b> <b>systems</b> (NFAS) has an impact on small-scale farming that should be better assessed. This paper, which looks at the characteristics of intangible services, helps demonstrate how the privatization of advisory services may have unexpected adverse effects on small farms. The dismantling of coordinating authorities has made these farms less visible as a target client. Less direct interaction with advisors makes it more difficult to co-produce knowledge that is relevant to their needs. In addition, back office activities such as scientific monitoring, building and updating databases and scientific experiments have been restructured in a way which does not support their interests...|$|R

The questions addressed are: Why is it necessary to reform European agricultural policy now? What is the CAP reform looking to achieve? Didn't the Brussels Council of October 2002 exclude further CAP reforms? What is the rationale behind proposing new rural development measures? What does de-coupling mean in practical terms? Does de-coupling mean paying farmers for doing nothing? Will the reform lead to a shrinking farm production harming farmers and industry? What will happen to farmers' incomes? What does de-coupling mean in WTO terms? How would cross-compliance be applied? What is the advantage of introducing a <b>Farm</b> <b>Advisory</b> <b>System?</b> What is the Commission's intention for the dairy industry? Why introduce such a radical price cut for rice? Why cut intervention prices for cereals? Why exclude rye from intervention? Will the proposals for the CAP reform result in a real simplification? Significant points highlighted in the memo include: only a 7 % reduction in beef production is expected, with farmers gaining from improved prices and net incomes increasing; the EU will remain an exporter of beef; the EU will remain a significant exporter of cereals; the proposals will {{have a positive effect on}} the EU food industry by reducing the costs of raw materials; market balances will be significantly improved; overall farm incomes will increase by 1. 7 %; reform would place a larger percentage of EU farm aid in the 'green box' making it easier to defend in the WTO. Comment: Singularly missing in the Q&A presentation was any consideration of the effects the proposed reforms would have on traditional preferred suppliers such as the ACP. For example, the impact of the 50 % price reduction in the rice sector on Guyana's and Surinam's rice exporters. This represents a major oversight which the EU needs to urgently address.

40|$|The agronomic {{measures}} made obligatory by the cross-compliance Standard Temporary {{measures for}} runoff water control on sloping land {{included in the}} Ministry of Agricultural, Food and Forestry Policies (MiPAAF) decree on cross compliance until 2008, and by Standard 1. 1 Creation of temporary ditches {{for the prevention of}} soil erosion in the 2009 decree, certainly appear to be useful for the control of soil erosion and runoff. The efficacy of temporary drainage ditches and of grass strips in controlling runoff and erosion has been demonstrated in trials conducted in field test plots in Italy. When level temporary drainage ditches are correctly built, namely with an inclination of not more than 2. 5 % in relation to the maximum hillslope gradient, they allow the suspended sediment eroded upstream to settle in the ditches, retaining the material carried away on the slope and, as a result, reducing the quantity of sediment delivered to the hydrographic network. In particular, among all the results, the erosion and runoff data in a trial conducted in Guiglia (Modena) showed that in corn plots, temporary drainage ditches reduced soil erosion by 94 %, from 14. 4 Mg ha- 1 year- 1 (above the limit established by the NRCS-USDA of 11. 2 Mg ha- 1 year- 1) to 0. 8 Mg ha- 1 year- 1 (within the NRCS limit and also within the more restrictive limit established by the OECD of 6. 0 Mg ha- 1 year- 1). With respect to the grass buffer strips the most significant research was carried out in Volterra. This research demonstrated their efficacy in reducing erosion from 8. 15 Mg ha- 1 to 1. 6 Mg ha- 1, which is approximately 5 times less than the erosion observed on bare soil. The effectiveness of temporary drainage ditches was also assessed through the application of the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) erosion model to 60 areas {{under the control of the}} Agency for Agricultural Payments (AGEA) in 2009, comparing the risk of erosion in these sample areas by simulating the presence and absence of drainage ditches at a distance of 80 metres from each other as required by the Standard. The results of the scenario analysis showed that the presence of ditches on average decreases erosion by 67 %. To sum up, the Standard was found to be effective from a hydraulic point of view, as the results have demonstrated the adequacy of temporary ditches for the control of runoff water. Another important result of this study was the production of a simple equation that can be directly used by farmers or, more realistically, by the <b>farm</b> <b>advisory</b> <b>system</b> to provide farmers with the information necessary for the realisation of temporary drainage ditches (depth and section that can be obtained with the most widespread types of ditch diggers) so that these ditches are effective and maintain their hydraulic efficacy throughout the entire cropping period. This equation would also be useful for cross-compliance control by the AGEA and regional control bodies...|$|E

Specifically, 18 advisory strategies for op-erators {{of a cold}} rolling mill were designed using different modelling assumptions.

In order to measure actual suitability of the <b>advisory</b> <b>systems,</b> we define two measures: operator’s performance index and coincidence of the observed operator’s actions with the advices. A time-variant model of <b>advisory</b> <b>system</b> suitability is proposed. Merging of the advices is achieved using Bayesian theory of decision-making. Final assessment of the original <b>advisory</b> <b>systems</b> and the new system is performed on data recorded during 6 months of operation of a real rolling mill.

Whereas institutional approaches, most often in (comparative) public administration, identify features of politico-administrative systems to account for policy-making such as politicization or {{the role of the}} centre, policy perspectives explain policy-making by factors related to the respective policy domain, e. g. frames or agenda-setting.

40|$|The growing {{multifunctionality}} in agriculture, {{combined with}} privatisation of previously state-funded agricultural extension services, {{has resulted in}} a pluralistic land management <b>advisory</b> <b>system.</b> Despite benefits in terms of increased client orientation and greater advisor diversity, it is argued that these changes have resulted in the fragmentation of the land management <b>advisory</b> <b>system</b> and a reduction of interaction within the <b>advisory</b> <b>system</b> and between the <b>advisory</b> <b>system</b> and science. In this paper we explore how advisors (land agents, applied ecologists and veterinarians) develop their knowledge and skills by engaging in different kinds of networks. Key findings suggest that advisors draw upon informal ‘communities of practice’ within their own advisory profession, but also draw upon broader ‘networks of practice’ involving multiple advisors from different advisory professions, resulting in knowledge sharing, brokered around the complex queries of clients. Whereas fragmentation and disconnect due to competition and epistemological differences do play a role; they do not appear to prevent overall knowledge sharing among advisors within and across different professions. Assumptions of a collapse of interaction within the land management <b>advisory</b> <b>system</b> are not supported by the evidence. However, to optimize interactions between professions, and between advisors and the science systems, informal or formal brokers could play a bigger role...|$|R
40|$|This report {{addresses}} {{the question of}} the evaluation of interventions based on <b>farm</b> <b>advisory</b> services. The aim is to provide guidelines for producing evidence about the effectiveness of such interventions. These guidelines have been tested on a specific case: the effectiveness of farm advice for reducing occupational exposure to pesticides of farm labour. In the first section, we discuss the distinction between the different objectives which an evaluation of <b>farm</b> <b>advisory</b> programmes can endorse. We propose to distinguish three major goals for evaluation, by adopting the typology of Berriet et al. (2014) : i) to measure the impact of <b>farm</b> <b>advisory</b> programmes; ii) to understand the causal path that generates changes through <b>farm</b> <b>advisory</b> programmes; and iii) to support learning processes for the stakeholders involved in a programme to in turn enhance its implementation. A key point of this typology is that it allows for reflection on the methodology which is needed to gather the best possible evidence according to the goal pursued by the evaluation. The ‘best’ possibleevidence should be: a) socially relevant to those concerned (external validity); b) based on types of evidence (evidence of presence, of difference-making, of mechanism) which is adequate for the purpose of the evaluation; c) reliable (produced using rigorous methods, to ensure the highest degree of probative force, i. e. the highest level of evidence). Numerous studies provide frameworks for describing the impact schemes (or causal paths) of <b>farm</b> <b>advisory</b> service interventions, however there is a clear knowledge gap regarding the actual of their impact, especially in Europe. The second section is focused on this specific question of impact assessment of interventions based on the support given to <b>farm</b> <b>advisory</b> services. It highlights the fact that many methods (experimental or quasi-experimental) are now available to implement impact assessments. It also gives some critical points for evaluating the internal quality of studies based on such methods and for identifying their limits of validity for practice. A key dimension is that the results of impact assessments of farm advice interventions might not be extrapolated beyond the very context where the study was implemented. This statement calls for a need for reviews that combine results from impact assessments implemented in various contexts. The third section poposes methodological corner stones for the implementation of such systematic reviews about the effectiveness of farm advice. It describes the different steps for implementing this methodology, and proposes some examples of analytical tools such as: i) algorithms and diagrams to search and sort the papers; ii) tables to describe and evaluate the quality of papers; iii) criteria to combine evidence from different researches. We tested this methodology on a specific case: the effectiveness of farm advice regarding the reduction of occupational exposure to pesticides of farm labour. The case study is presented extensively in section 6. The results highlight a specific knowledge gap in the European context. There are almost no studies on the impact of farm advice on health issues in European agriculture. Nevertheless, the systematic review reveals that some positive effects of interventions (training, advice [...] .) on farmers and workers have been demonstrated in North Ameca (Canada and United States of America) ...|$|R
