2500|$|All {{lactic acid}} {{bacteria}} (LAB) involved in winemaking, whether as a positive contributor or {{as a source for}} potential faults, have the ability to produce lactic acid through the metabolism of a sugar source, as well as the metabolism of L-malic acid. Species differ in how they metabolise the available sugars in wine (both glucose and fructose, as well as the unfermentable pentoses that wine yeasts do not consume). Some bacteria species use the sugars through a homofermentative pathway, meaning [...] only one main end product (usually lactate) is produced, while others use <b>heterofermentative</b> pathways that can create multiple end products such as carbon dioxide, ethanol, and acetate. While only the L-isomer of lactate is produced by LAB in the conversion of malic acid, both hetero- and homofermenters can produce D-, L- and DL-isomers of lactic from glucose which may contribute to slightly different sensory properties in the wine.|$|E
50|$|Lactobacillus paraplantarum is a rod shaped {{species of}} lactic acid {{bacteria}} first isolated from beer and human faeces. It is facultatively <b>heterofermentative.</b> Strain CNRZ 1885 (= CIP 104668) is the type strain.|$|E
50|$|<b>Heterofermentative</b> LAB use the pentose {{phosphate}} pathway, alternatively {{referred to}} as the pentose phosphoketolase pathway. One mole of glucose-6-phosphate is initially dehydrogenated to 6-phosphogluconate and subsequently decarboxylated to yield one mole of CO2. The resulting pentose-5-phosphate is cleaved into one mole glyceraldehyde phosphate (GAP) and one mole acetyl phosphate. GAP is further metabolized to lactate as in homofermentation, with the acetyl phosphate reduced to ethanol via acetyl-CoA and acetaldehyde intermediates. In theory, end products (including ATP) are produced in equimolar quantities from the catabolism of one mole of glucose. Obligate <b>heterofermentative</b> LAB include Leuconostoc, Oenococcus, Weissella, and group III lactobacilli.|$|E

50|$|To make cheese {{the cheese}}maker brings milk (possibly pasteurised) in the cheese vat to a {{temperature}} required {{to promote the}} growth of the bacteria that feed on lactose and thus ferment the lactose into lactic acid. These bacteria in the milk may be wild, {{as is the case with}} unpasteurised milk, added from a culture, frozen or freeze dried concentrate of starter bacteria. Bacteria which produce only lactic acid during fermentation are homofermentative; those that also produce lactic acid and other compounds such as carbon dioxide, alcohol, aldehydes and ketones are <b>heterofermentative.</b> Fermentation using homofermentative bacteria is important in the production of cheeses such as Cheddar, where a clean, acid flavour is required. For cheeses such as Emmental the use of <b>heterofermentative</b> bacteria is necessary to produce the compounds that give characteristic fruity flavours and, importantly, the gas that results in the formation of bubbles in the cheese ('eye holes').|$|E

5000|$|Lactobacillus rhamnosus is a {{bacterium}} that originally {{was considered to}} be a subspecies of L. casei, but later genetic research found it to be a species of its own. It is a short Gram-positive <b>heterofermentative</b> facultative anaerobic non-spore-forming rod that often appears in chains. Some strains of L. rhamnosus bacteria are being used as probiotics, and are particularly useful in treating female-related infections, most particularly very difficult to treat cases of bacterial vaginosis (or [...] "BV"). The Lactobacillus rhamnosus and L. reuteri species are most commonly found in the healthy female genito-urinary tract and are most helpful to supplement in order to regain control over dysbiotic bacterial overgrowth during an active infection. L. rhamnosus sometimes is used in yogurt and dairy products such as fermented and un-pasteurized milk and semi-hard cheese.

40|$|The {{effect of}} citrate on {{production}} of diacetyl and acetoin by four strains each of <b>heterofermentative</b> and homofermentative {{lactic acid bacteria}} capable of utilizing citrate was studied.

40|$|A {{total of}} 375 lactic acid {{bacteria}} were isolated from fermenting cassava in South Africa, Benin, Kenya and Germany, and were characterised by phenotypic and genotypic tests. These could be divided into five main groups comprising strains of facultatively <b>heterofermentative</b> rods, obligately <b>heterofermentative</b> rods, <b>heterofermentative</b> cocci, homofermentative cocci and obligately homofermentative rods, in decreasing order of predominance. Most of the facultatively <b>heterofermentative</b> rods were identified by phenotypic tests as presumptive Lactobacillus plantarum-group strains, which also comprised the most predominant bacteria (54. 4 % of strains) isolated in the study. The next predominant group of {{lactic acid bacteria}} (14. 1 % of total isolates) consisted of obligately <b>heterofermentative</b> rods belonging either to the genus Lactobacillus or Weissella, followed by the <b>heterofermentative</b> cocci (13. 9 % of isolates) belonging to the genera Weissella or Leuconostoc. Homofermentative cocci were also isolated (13. 3 % of isolates). Biochemical properties such as production of alpha-amylase, p-glucosidase, tannase, antimicrobials (presumptive bacteriocin and H 2 O 2 -production), acidification and fermentation of the indigestible sugars raffinose and stachyose, were evaluated in vitro for selection of potential starter strains. A total of 32 strains {{with one or more}} desirable biochemical properties were pre-selected and identified using rep-PCR fingerprinting in combination with 16 S rRNA sequencing of representative rep-PCR cluster isolates. Of these strains, 18 were identified as L. plantarum, four as Lactobacillus pentosus, two each as Leuconostoc fallax, Weissella paramesenteroides and Lactobacillus fermentum, one each as Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides and Weissella cibaria, while two remained unidentified but could be assigned to the L. plantarum-group. These strains were further investigated for clonal relationships, using RAPD-PCR with three primers, and of the 32 a total of 16 strains were finally selected for the development as starter cultures for Gari production.

40|$|Aims: This study {{evaluated}} the aerobic and respiratory metabolism in Lactobacillus reuteri and Lactobacillus spicheri, two <b>heterofermentative</b> species used in sourdough fermentation. Methods and Results: In silico genome analysis, production of metabolites andgene expression of pyruvate oxidase, pyruvate dehydrogenase and cytochrome oxidase were assessed in anaerobic and aerobic cultures of Lact. reuteri and Lact. spicheri. Respiring homofermentative Lactobacillus casei N 87 and Lact. rhamnosus N 132 {{were used for}} comparison. Aerobiosis and respiration increased the biomass production of <b>heterofermentative</b> strains compared to anaerobic cultivation. Respiration led to acetoin production by Lact. rhamnosus and Lact. casei, but not in <b>heterofermentative</b> strains, in which lactate and acetate were the major endproducts. Lactobacillus spicheri LP 38 showed the highest oxygen uptake. Pyruvate oxidase, respiratory cytochromes, NADH oxidase and NADH peroxidase {{were present in the}} genome of Lact. spicheri LP 38. BothLact. spicheri LP 38 and Lact. rhamnosus N 132 overexpressed pox in aerobic cultures, while cydA was up-regulated only when haeme was supplied; pdh was repressed during aerobic growth. Conclusions: Aerobic and respiratory growth provided physiological and metabolic advantages also in <b>heterofermentative</b> lactobacilli.
