5|$|A {{quarter of}} all people with Guillain–Barré {{syndrome}} develop weakness of the breathing muscles leading to respiratory failure, the inability to breathe adequately to maintain healthy levels of oxygen and/or carbon <b>dioxide</b> <b>in</b> the blood.

5|$|Solar energy {{may be used}} in a water {{stabilization}} pond to treat waste water without chemicals or electricity.

5|$|The {{oxidation}} state +5 {{can be produced}} by dissolving manganese <b>dioxide</b> <b>in</b> molten sodium nitrite. Manganate (VI) salts can be produced by dissolving Mn compounds, such as manganese <b>dioxide,</b> <b>in</b> molten alkali while exposed to air. Permanganate (+7 {{oxidation state}}) compounds are purple, and can give glass a violet color. Potassium permanganate, sodium permanganate, and barium permanganate are all potent oxidizers. Potassium permanganate, also called Condy's crystals, is a commonly used laboratory reagent because of its oxidizing properties; it {{is used as a}} topical medicine (for example, in the treatment of fish diseases). Solutions of potassium permanganate were among the first stains and fixatives {{to be used in the}} preparation of biological cells and tissues for electron microscopy.|$|E
5|$|Thorium dioxide is a {{refractory}} material {{with the highest}} melting point among any known oxide (3390°C). Adding 0.8–1% ThO2 to tungsten stabilizes its structure, so the doped filaments have better mechanical stability to vibrations. To dissolve ThO2 in acids, it is heated to 500–600°C; heating above 600°C produces a very resistant to acids and other reagents form of ThO2. Small addition of fluoride ions catalyses dissolution of thorium <b>dioxide</b> <b>in</b> acids.|$|E
5|$|Biogas, or {{landfill}} gas, is a biofuel produced {{through the}} intermediary stage of anaerobic digestion consisting mainly of 45–90% biologically produced methane and carbon <b>dioxide.</b> <b>In</b> early 2007 a thermophilic anaerobic digestion facility was commissioned in Stornoway in the Western Isles. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) and the Renewable Energy Association are also {{leading the way}} towards {{the establishment of a}} digestate standard to facilitate the use of solid outputs from digesters on land. Anaerobic digestion and mechanical biological treatment facilities have been planned at a number of other locations in Scotland, such as Westray.|$|E

5|$|Bromine oxides {{are not as}} {{well-characterised}} as {{chlorine oxides}} or iodine oxides, as they are all fairly unstable: it was once thought {{that they could not}} exist at all. Dibromine monoxide is a dark-brown solid which, while reasonably stable at −60°C, decomposes at its melting point of −17.5°C; it is useful in bromination reactions and may be made from the low-temperature decomposition of bromine <b>dioxide</b> <b>in</b> a vacuum. It oxidises iodine to iodine pentoxide and benzene to 1,4-benzoquinone; in alkaline solutions, it gives the hypobromite anion.|$|E
5|$|If OHS is suspected, various {{tests are}} {{required}} for its confirmation. The most important initial test is the demonstration of elevated carbon <b>dioxide</b> <b>in</b> the blood. This requires an arterial blood gas determination, which involves taking a blood sample from an artery, usually the radial artery. Given {{that it would be}} complicated to perform this test on every patient with sleep-related breathing problems, some suggest that measuring bicarbonate levels in normal (venous) blood would be a reasonable screening test. If this is elevated (27mmol/l or higher), blood gasses should be measured.|$|E
5|$|In {{the decade}} {{following}} World War II, Lambertsen et al. made further discoveries {{on the effects}} of breathing oxygen under pressure and methods of prevention. Their work on intermittent exposures for extension of oxygen tolerance and on a model for prediction of pulmonary oxygen toxicity based on pulmonary function are key documents in the development of standard operating procedures when breathing increased pressures of oxygen. Lambertsen's work showing the effect of carbon <b>dioxide</b> <b>in</b> decreasing time to onset of central nervous system symptoms has influenced work from current exposure guidelines to future breathing apparatus design.|$|E

5|$|Information {{from the}} {{peripheral}} chemoreceptors is relayed {{to a series}} of interconnected nuclei which comprise the respiratory centres in the medulla oblongata and the pons of the brainstem. This information determines the average rate of ventilation of the alveoli of the lungs, to keep the partial pressures of oxygen and carbon <b>dioxide</b> <b>in</b> the arterial blood constant.

5|$|Lithium, sodium, and {{potassium}} have many applications, while rubidium and caesium are very useful in academic contexts {{but do not}} have many applications yet. Lithium is often used in batteries, and lithium oxide can help process silica. Lithium stearate is a thickener {{and can be used}} to make lubricating greases; it is produced from lithium hydroxide, which is also used to absorb carbon <b>dioxide</b> <b>in</b> space capsules and submarines. Lithium chloride is used as a brazing alloy for aluminium parts. Metallic lithium is used in alloys with magnesium and aluminium to give very tough and light alloys.|$|E
5|$|Most americium(III) halides form {{hexagonal}} crystals with slight {{variation of}} the color and exact structure between the halogens. So, chloride (AmCl3) is reddish and has a structure isotypic to uranium(III) chloride (space group P63/m) and the melting point of 715°C. The fluoride is isotypic to LaF3 (space group P63/mmc) and the iodide to BiI3 (space group R). The bromide is an exception with the orthorhombic PuBr3-type structure and space group Cmcm. Crystals of americium hexahydrate (AmCl3·6H2O) can be prepared by dissolving americium <b>dioxide</b> <b>in</b> hydrochloric acid and evaporating the liquid.
