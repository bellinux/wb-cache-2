5|$|Experiments done by William Tavolga provide {{evidence}} that <b>fish</b> <b>have</b> pain and fear responses. For instance, in Tavolga's experiments, toadfish grunted when electrically shocked and over time they came to grunt at the mere sight of an electrode.|$|E
5|$|<b>Fish</b> <b>have</b> been {{recognized}} {{as a source of}} beauty for almost as long as used for food, appearing in cave art, being raised as ornamental fish in ponds, and displayed in aquariums in homes, offices, or public settings.|$|E
5|$|Logging {{was a large}} {{industry}} in the watershed of Hammersley Fork in the early 1900s, {{but there have been}} almost no industrial activities in the area since then. An old railroad grade is located on Hammersley Fork. <b>Fish</b> <b>have</b> been stocked in the stream since the 1930s or 1940s.|$|E

50|$|The <b>fish</b> <b>has</b> {{two pairs}} of tentacles around the mouth. The dorsal, {{pectoral}} and pelvic scales are small. The sub-adult <b>fish</b> <b>has</b> a silver colour. The adults are olive-grey with a golden-brown tint on the scales.|$|R
5|$|Most fish possess highly {{developed}} sense organs. Nearly all daylight <b>fish</b> <b>have</b> color vision {{that is at}} least as good as a human's (see vision in fishes). Many fish also have chemoreceptors that are responsible for extraordinary senses of taste and smell. Although they have ears, many fish may not hear very well. Most <b>fish</b> <b>have</b> sensitive receptors that form the lateral line system, which detects gentle currents and vibrations, and senses the motion of nearby fish and prey. Some fish, such as catfish and sharks, have the Ampullae of Lorenzini, organs that detect weak electric currents on the order of millivolt. Other fish, like the South American electric fishes Gymnotiformes, can produce weak electric currents, which they use in navigation and social communication.|$|E
5|$|Several {{locations}} {{are available for}} fishing. According to Texas Parks and Wildlife, the following <b>fish</b> <b>have</b> {{been caught in the}} stream: largemouth bass, bluegill, channel catfish, Rio Grande cichlid, longnose gar, green sunfish, sunfish hybrid, redbreast sunfish, and redear sunfish.|$|E
5|$|Teleosts possess highly {{developed}} sensory organs. Nearly all daylight <b>fish</b> <b>have</b> colour vision {{at least as}} good as a normal human's. Many fish also have chemoreceptors responsible for acute senses of taste and smell. Most <b>fish</b> <b>have</b> sensitive receptors that form the lateral line system, which detects gentle currents and vibrations, and senses the motion of nearby fish and prey. Fish sense sounds in a variety of ways, using the lateral line, the swim bladder, and in some species the Weberian apparatus. Fish orient themselves using landmarks, and may use mental maps based on multiple landmarks or symbols. Experiments with mazes show that fish possess the spatial memory needed to make such a mental map.|$|E
50|$|The <b>fish</b> <b>has</b> a {{long and}} slender body. It also has eight dorsal fin-rays, {{anywhere}} from nine to eleven anal fin-rays, thirteen to fourteen pectoral fin-rays and eight pelvic fin-rays. The <b>fish</b> <b>has</b> a dark spot of pigment {{at the base of}} its first few dorsal-fins, which distinguishes Lythrurus ardens from similar looking fish in its habitat. In addition, the <b>fish</b> <b>has</b> a stripe that fades as it approaches the dorsa fin and several bands of coloration across the back of the fish.|$|R
5000|$|In Louisiana, the <b>fish</b> <b>has</b> slowly {{taken over}} the waters of New Orleans. The <b>fish</b> <b>has</b> a high {{salinity}} tolerance (up to 8ppt), but {{it is likely that}} this is caused by the interbreeding of this fish and the Herichthys Carpintis, which makes it an ideal invader for the brackish conditions of southern Louisiana. [...] It is believed that this <b>fish</b> <b>has</b> entered into the New Orleans area through multiple aquarium releases in central Jefferson Parish in 1989. Since the <b>fish</b> <b>has</b> a short mating cycle, it did not take long for the fish to make its way through the canal system and into Lake Pontchartrain. [...] Pump stations and Lake Pontchartrain aided to the spreading of the fish into other canals.|$|R
50|$|As <b>fish</b> <b>has</b> {{traditionally}} {{been a major}} dietary component of people living near seas, rivers, and lakes, many regional variations of the <b>fish</b> cake <b>have</b> arisen.|$|R
5|$|The lake {{has been}} stocked {{annually}} {{with a variety}} of introduced and native species and over half a million <b>fish</b> <b>have</b> been released since 1981. There have been many changes to the fish populations in the lake as well as stocking practices since it was first filled.|$|E
5|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{wildlife}} {{can be found in}} and around San Antonio Bay. According to Texas Parks and Wildlife, the following <b>fish</b> <b>have</b> been caught in the bay: palmetto bass, striped bass, hardhead catfish, black drum, red drum, crevalle jack, southern kingfish, ladyfish, lefteye flounder, pinfish, spotted seatrout, and the sheepshead.|$|E
5|$|Fish are an {{important}} resource for humans worldwide, especially as food. Commercial and subsistence fishers hunt fish in wild fisheries (see fishing) or farm them in ponds or in cages in the ocean (see aquaculture). They are also caught by recreational fishers, kept as pets, raised by fishkeepers, and exhibited in public aquaria. <b>Fish</b> <b>have</b> {{had a role in}} culture through the ages, serving as deities, religious symbols, and as the subjects of art, books and movies.|$|E

5|$|Fish {{typically}} have quite small brains relative to body size {{compared with other}} vertebrates, typically one-fifteenth the brain mass of a similarly sized bird or mammal. However, some <b>fish</b> <b>have</b> relatively large brains, most notably mormyrids and sharks, which have brains about as massive relative to body weight as birds and marsupials.|$|E
5|$|Great white sharks, {{like all}} other sharks, have an extra sense given by the ampullae of Lorenzini which enables them to detect the {{electromagnetic}} field emitted by the movement of living animals. Great whites are so sensitive they can detect variations of half a billionth of a volt. At close range, this allows the shark to locate even immobile animals by detecting their heartbeat. Most <b>fish</b> <b>have</b> a less-developed but similar sense using their body's lateral line.|$|E
5|$|Its {{toxicity}} {{is due to}} tetrodotoxin, {{which is}} concentrated particularly in the liver, ovaries, intestines and skin. Many species of pufferfish bear this toxin, obtaining it from tetrodotoxin-containing bacteria in their diet. Eating the fish can have fatal consequences. The symptoms of poisoning, which are predominantly neurological, include ataxia, in addition to numbness and/or paraesthesia (tingling) around the mouth, lips, and limb extremities. Cases of pets being poisoned have occurred when the <b>fish</b> <b>have</b> been left where they can eat them.|$|E

5|$|Just as predators such as angler <b>fish</b> <b>have</b> a {{structure}} that lures prey, so some parasites mimic their host's natural prey, but with roles reversed; the parasite gets eaten by the host. This deception provides the parasite easy entry into the host, which they can then feed upon, allowing them to continue their life cycle. Researchers {{may be able to}} predict the host of such parasites based on their appearance and behavior.|$|E
5|$|Many <b>fish</b> <b>have</b> eyespots {{near their}} tails, {{a form of}} automimicry, to {{distract}} attacks away from the vulnerable head and eye. For example, Chaetodon capistratus has both a (disruptive) eyestripe to conceal the eye, and a large eyespot near its tail, giving {{the impression that the}} head is {{at the tail end of}} the body.|$|E
5|$|Many pets {{have escaped}} or been {{released}} into the Everglades from the surrounding urban areas. Some find the conditions quite favorable and have established self-sustaining populations, competing for food and space with native animals. Many tropical <b>fish</b> <b>have</b> been released, but blue tilapias (Oreochromis aureus) cause damage to shallow waterways by creating large nests and consuming aquatic plants that protect native young fish.|$|E

5|$|More <b>fish</b> <b>have</b> been {{discovered}} in the newly daylighted section of the river. Baby eastern blacknose dace and tessellated darter have been spotted in the river in addition to trout. In addition, wood frogs, eastern painted turtles, and redbreast sunfish live in the river too. All of these species have been hurt by the industrialization of the river.|$|E
5|$|Saltwater fish tend to lose water {{because of}} osmosis. Their kidneys return {{water to the}} body. The reverse happens in {{freshwater}} fish: they tend to gain water osmotically. Their kidneys produce dilute urine for excretion. Some <b>fish</b> <b>have</b> specially adapted kidneys that vary in function, allowing them to move from freshwater to saltwater.|$|E
5|$|Tooth shape {{depends on}} the shark's diet: those that feed on mollusks and {{crustaceans}} have dense and flattened teeth used for crushing, those that feed on <b>fish</b> <b>have</b> needle-like teeth for gripping, and those that feed on larger prey such as mammals have pointed lower teeth for gripping and triangular upper teeth with serrated edges for cutting. The teeth of plankton-feeders such as the basking shark are small and non-functional.|$|E
