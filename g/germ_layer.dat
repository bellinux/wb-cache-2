25|$|A tooth (plural teeth) is a hard, calcified {{structure}} {{found in}} the jaws (or mouths) of many vertebrates and used to break down food. Some animals, particularly carnivores, also use teeth for hunting or for defensive purposes. The roots of teeth are covered by gums. Teeth are not made of bone, but rather of multiple tissues of varying density and hardness. The cellular tissues that ultimately become teeth originate from the embryonic <b>germ</b> <b>layer,</b> the ectoderm.|$|E
25|$|Synchrotron X-ray tomographic {{analysis}} of early Cambrian bilaterian embryonic microfossils yielded new insights of metazoan evolution at its earliest stages. The tomography technique provides previously unattainable three-dimensional resolution at {{the limits of}} fossilization. Fossils of two enigmatic bilaterians, the worm-like Markuelia and a putative, primitive protostome, Pseudooides, provide a peek at <b>germ</b> <b>layer</b> embryonic development. These 543-million-year-old embryos support the emergence of some aspects of arthropod development earlier than previously thought in the late Proterozoic. The preserved embryos from China and Siberia underwent rapid diagenetic phosphatization resulting in exquisite preservation, including cell structures. This research is a notable example of how knowledge encoded by the fossil record continues to contribute otherwise unattainable information on the emergence and development of life on Earth. For example, the research suggests Markuelia has closest affinity to priapulid worms, and is adjacent to the evolutionary branching of Priapulida, Nematoda and Arthropoda.|$|E

50|$|The {{presence}} of the primitive streak will establish bilateral symmetry, determine the site of gastrulation and initiate <b>germ</b> <b>layer</b> formation. To form the streak, reptiles, birds and mammals arrange mesenchymal cells along the prospective midline, establishing the second embryonic axis, {{as well as the}} place where cells will ingress and migrate during the process of gastrulation and <b>germ</b> <b>layer</b> formation.The primitive streak extends through this midline and creates the left-right and cranial-caudal body axes, and marks the beginning of gastrulation.

40|$|We {{characterized}} {{the pattern of}} gap junctional communication in the 7. 5 - d mouse embryo (at the primitive streak or gastrulation stage). First we examined the pattern of dye coupling by injecting the fluorescent tracers, Lucifer Yellow or carboxyfluorescein, and monitoring the extent of dye spread. These studies revealed that cells within all three <b>germ</b> <b>layers</b> are well coupled, as the injected dye usually spread rapidly {{from the site of}} impalement into the neighboring cells. The dye spread, however, appeared to be restricted at specific regions of the embryo. Further thick section histological analysis revealed little or no dye transfer between <b>germ</b> <b>layers,</b> indicating that each is a separate communication compartment. The pattern of dye movement within the embryonic ectoderm and mesoderm further suggested that cells in each of these <b>germ</b> <b>layers</b> may be subdivided into smaller communication compartments, the most striking of which are a number of "box-like" domains. Such compartments, unlike the restrictions observed between <b>germ</b> <b>layers,</b> are consistently only partially restrictive. In light of these results, we further monitored ionic coupling to determine if some coupling might nevertheless persist between <b>germ</b> <b>layers.</b> For these studies, Lucifer Yellow was coinjected while ionic coupling was monitored. The injected Lucifer Yellow facilitated the identification of the impalement sites, both in the live specimen and in thick sections in the subsequent histological analysis. By using this approach, all three <b>germ</b> <b>layers</b> were shown to be ionically coupled, indicating that gap junctional communication is maintained across the otherwise dye-uncoupled "germ layer compartments. " Thus our results demonstrate that partially restrictive communication compartments are associated with the delamination of <b>germ</b> <b>layers</b> in the gastrulating mouse embryo. The spatial distribution of these compartments are consistent with a possible role in the underlying development...|$|R
40|$|Vertebrate {{embryogenesis}} entails an exquisitely coordinated {{combination of}} cell proliferation, fate specification and movement. After induction of the <b>germ</b> <b>layers,</b> the blastula is transformed by gastrulation movements into a multilayered embryo with head, trunk and tail rudiments. Gastrulation is heralded by {{formation of a}} blastopore, {{an opening in the}} blastula. The axial side of the blastopore is marked by the organizer, a signaling center that patterns the <b>germ</b> <b>layers</b> and regulates gastrulation movements. During internalization, endoderm and mesoderm cells move via the blastopore beneath the ectoderm. Epiboly movements expand and thin the nascent <b>germ</b> <b>layers.</b> Convergence movements narrow the <b>germ</b> <b>layers</b> from lateral to medial while extension movements elongate them from head to tail. Despite different morphology, parallels emerge with respect to the cellular and genetic mechanisms of gastrulation in different vertebrate groups. Patterns of gastrulation cell movements relative to the blastopore and the organizer are similar from fish to mammals, and conserved molecular pathways mediate gastrulation movements...|$|R
