40|$|Mangrove trees grow in an {{environment}} that is highly demanding for their water transport. Frequent tidal inundation may impede water uptake at the soil side, while in the prevailing tropical conditions, heat and wind are ‘pulling’ at the atmospheric side of the water column. On top, the mangrove environment is highly dynamic. Environmental conditions can quickly change in an unpredictable way. However, mangrove trees seem to make a virtue of necessity, thriving very well in these harsh environmental conditions. How can a water transport system of trees adapt to such environmental conditions? Is such adaptation part of the ecological success of the mangrove genus Avicennia in this environment as well as stretching its range into different climate zones? We address these two research questions through functional wood anatomy and ecophysiology, two research disciplines that search for anatomy-environment relationships both by physiological interpretation of observed internal structure and direct physiological experiments. In part one of the study we investigate the requirements of the hydraulic system for survival in the mangrove environment and its adaptation to the gradient of environmental conditions within the intertidal zone. We compare the vessel characteristics of nine mangrove genera - representing all but one families with core mangrove species - with those of their respective non-mangrove sister taxa (Chapter 1). Furthermore, we assess the wood anatomy of Avicennia marina and Rhizophora mucronata - the two most widespread species of the only two pantropical mangrove genera - along the intertidal gradient in soil water salinity and inundation frequency of the mangrove forest in Gazi Bay (Kenya) (Chapter 2). Our results show that survival in the mangrove forest requires a vascular system composed of numerous narrow water conducting vessels. This structure allows for bypassing air-filled vessel sections present to a greater extent in conditions of limiting water availability. With increasing soil water salinity and decreasing inundation frequency, the wood anatomy of mangrove trees has a more pronounced safety structure, i. e. numerous narrow vessels, and this at between-species and within-species level. Avicennia trees have the most pronounced hydraulic safety structure. This can partly explain the ecological success of the genus. In part two, we focus on the study of the successive cambia in the genus Avicennia. Unlike in other mangrove trees, the radial growth of Avicennia trees occurs through several vascular cambia, characterizing the tree stem with <b>internal</b> <b>phloem</b> tissue. We investigate the possible ecological advantage this anatomical feature could offer Avicennia trees for survival in the mangrove environment, both by the presence of <b>internal</b> <b>phloem</b> (Chapter 3 and 5) and the special patchy nature of radial growth (Chapter 4). We make a three-dimensional reconstruction of the internal hydraulic structure of Avicennia trees along the intertidal gradient through (micro-) CT-scanning (Chapter 3), investigate the link between species with <b>internal</b> <b>phloem</b> and drought-characterized habitats through a database analysis (Chapter 3), study the growth patterns of two Avicennia trees through a dendrometer analysis (Chapter 4) and assess the internal water content of three species with <b>internal</b> <b>phloem,</b> Bougainvillea spectabilis, Avicennia marina and A. cf. officinalis, a non-mangrove and two mangrove species respectively, through Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) (Chapter 5). The internal hydraulic structure of Avicennia is a complex network of xylem and phloem patches that can change extensively with small vertical distance. A large amount of <b>internal</b> <b>phloem</b> tissue is present in conditions that are highly demanding for the water transport, i. e. higher soil water salinity and less frequent inundation. Also, trees and shrubs with <b>internal</b> <b>phloem</b> mainly occur in habitats that are characterized by periodical or continuous physiological drought. This indicates the ecological significance of <b>internal</b> <b>phloem</b> tissue. Since <b>internal</b> <b>phloem</b> tissue shows high water content on MRI-scans, a high water storage capacity could allow trees with <b>internal</b> <b>phloem</b> to better overcome air-filling of vessel sections. Avicennia trees show a high degree of patchiness in their anatomical structure and in the shrinking and swelling patterns of their stems. Different locations around the stem circumference can, but do not necessarily, react in a similar way to the prevailing environmental conditions. Correspondingly, radial stem increment can be patchy, but is not a systematic feature. In this way, Avicennia has a large adaptive toolbox of possibilities to interact with the environment and to optimally distribute available resources over the tree stem, dynamic both in space and in time, adding to the explanation for its ecological success within the mangrove forest. We can conclude that the vascular factor is important in the survival of mangrove trees in their environment. It is the combination of a safe water conducting vessel system, an <b>internal</b> <b>phloem</b> tissue with high water content and a spatially and temporally dynamic growth system that contributes to the success of Avicennia in the mangrove environment, allowing for withstanding a gradient in soil water salinities and inundation frequencies. This research adds to the general understanding of tree functioning since it has brought insight in important vascular factors for tree survival in harsh environmental conditions. Future research focusing on ecological wood anatomy in a phylogenetic context and on the link between anatomy and physiology could deepen these insights...|$|E

40|$|In {{cucumber}} (Cucumis sativus L.), {{phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase}} (PEPCK) was shown by activity measurements and immunoblots {{to be present}} in leaves, stems, roots, flowers, fruit and seed. However, immunolocalisation showed that it was present only in certain cell types. PEPCK was present in the companion cells of the adaxial phloem of minor veins, the adaxial and abaxial phloem of larger veins, the <b>internal</b> and external <b>phloem</b> of vascular bundles in petioles and stems, the phloem in roots and the extra-fascicular phloem in leaves, cotyledons, petioles and stems. Immunohistochemical evidence suggests that both the extra-fascicular phloem and the adaxial phloem are involved in the transport of amino acids. In roots and stems, the abundance of PEPCK was greatly increased by watering plants with a solution of ammonium chloride at low, but not at high pH. PEPCK also increased in leaves, but not roots or stems, of seedlings grown in an atmosphere containing 5 % CO 2, and in roots and stems of seedlings watered with butyric acid. All these treatments are known to lower the pH of plant cells. Amino acid metabolism in the phloem may produce an excess of carbon skeletons, pH perturbations and an imbalance in the production/utilisation of NADH. This raises the possibility that PEPCK may function in the conversion of these carbon skeletons to PEP, which, depending on the energy requirements of the phloem, is subsequently utilised by either gluconeogenesis or the Krebs cycle, which both consume protons...|$|R

The phloem consists of parenchyma cells, sieve elements (SE), and companion cells (CC) which are in close association with SE. We isolated two cDNAs encoding PIN 2, SaPIN 2 a and SaPIN 2 b, from a S. americanum cDNA library using a tomato PIN 2 cDNA as hybridization probe. SaPIN 2 a shows 73. 6 % identity to SaPIN 2 b. Southern blot analysis confirmed that two genes occur in S. americanum. Northern blot analysis showed that both are wound-inducible and are expressed in flowers. Unlike SaPIN 2 b and other previously characterized plant PIN 2 proteins, SaPIN 2 a is abundantly expressed in stems. In situ hybridization studies on stem sections showed that SaPIN 2 a mRNA is expressed in CC and some SE, likely the immature developing SE, of external and <b>internal</b> <b>phloem.</b> Western blot analysis using SaPIN 2 a-specific antibodies showed SaPIN 2 a accumulation in stems, leaf midribs and fruits.

A comparative survey of trans-sectional root anatomy of the mature stele in the Poaceae, sampling 76 species representing all 12 subfamilies from herbarium and fresh-fixed specimens has been undertaken. The species are a subset of the 157 species of grasses for which plastomes (plastid genome), leaf shape data, and leaf anatomical data are available. Quantitative and qualitative characters including endodermal cell radial thickness and inner-tangential wall thickness, stele area, and metaxylem vessel diameters were measured. Additionally, some characters, such as the number of endodermal and pericycle cell layers, were scored, and some ratios, such as total metaxylem vessel area to stele area, were calculated. This study represents the first comprehensive survey of trans-sectional root anatomy in grasses in a phylogenetic context, to document existing variation and to better understand the functional significance of anatomical variation in the evolution and diversification of this ecologically successful and economically important family. More variation than expected from relatively sparse reports in the literature was uncovered and two unique features, <b>internal</b> <b>phloem</b> and an apparently multiseriate endodermis, were documented. <b>Internal</b> <b>phloem</b> is confirmed in a few taxa of the Bambusoideae, as well as newly reported in a few species in the Micrairoideae.

Often, buds of some eyes survive to produce secondary plants which soon develop necrotic spots similar to those in the parent plant. [ [...] . ...|$|E
40|$|Eugenia pyriformis Cambess., {{known as}} uvaia, is {{a species of}} Myrtaceae native to Brazil. Its leaves are used in folk {{medicine}} to treat gout because they possess the property of inhibiting xanthine oxidase, an enzyme involved in the conversion of xanthine into uric acid. The objective of this work was to study the leaf and stem morpho-anatomy of E. pyriformis, in order to contribute to {{what is known about}} the Brazilian flora, and this medicinal plant and potential vegetal drug. Samples of mature leaves and young stems were fixed and sectioned by freehand, or embedded in glycol methacrylate and sectioned with a microtome, and then stained. In addition, microchemical tests and scanning electron microscopy were performed. The leaf is simple, symmetric, elliptic-lanceolate, with an acute apex and base, and an entire margin. The epidermis is uniseriate and coated with a moderately thick cuticle. The stomata are anomocytic and inserted at the same level as the adjacent cells. Unicellular non-glandular trichomes are abundant on the abaxial surface. The mesophyll is dorsiventral. In transverse section, the midrib is plano-convex and the petiole is circular, and both of these structures have a single bicollateral vascular bundle. In the stem, the vascular cylinder consists of external phloem, xylem and <b>internal</b> <b>phloem,</b> traversed by narrow rays. Phenolic compounds, druses and prismatic crystals of calcium oxalate are also present in the leaf and stem...|$|E
40|$|In this work, a morpho-anatomical {{study of}} the leaves, stems and roots of Solanum torvum Sw. was {{performed}} {{with the objective of}} providing a macroscopical and microscopical morphodiagnosis for its characterization. The species is popularly called "jurubeba-branca" in the Northeastern Brazil and is used in folk medicine to treat liver diseases, tuberculosis, and as antianemic. Anatomical studies were done by paradermic sections of the leaf blade (adaxial and abaxial surfaces), and cross sections of leaves (blade and petiole), stems and roots. The sections were clarified and stained with safranin and/ or astrablue, observed and photographed on light microscope. Histochemical tests were carried out in cross sections of leaves, stems and roots and assayed for specific reagents. The leaves are chartaceous, ovate to elliptic, with lobed margins, oblique at the base. The leaf is amphistomatic with anisocytic and anomocytic stomata simultaneously, and the epidermal cells, in face view, have anticlinal walls sinuate on the upper surface and wavy on the lower surface. The mesophyll is dorsiventral; the midrib has a central bicollateral vascular bundle; and the petiole has three or fourone. The stem shows external phloem, xylem, <b>internal</b> <b>phloem</b> and a parenchymatic pith. The root is axial and striate longitudinally and the secondary xylem is a massive cylinder. The macroscopical and microscopical vegetative characters constitute a set of diagnostic parameters to the studied species...|$|E
40|$|The {{monoterpene}} indole alkaloids (MIAs) from Madagascar periwinkle (Catharanthus roseus) are secondary metabolites of {{high interest}} {{due to their}} therapeutical values. Secologanin, the monoterpenoid moiety incorporated into MIAs, {{is derived from the}} plastidial methyl-D: -erythritol 4 -phosphate (MEP) pathway. Here, we have cloned a cDNA encoding hydroxymethylbutenyl diphosphate synthase (HDS), a MEP pathway enzyme, and generated antibodies to investigate the distribution of transcripts and protein in MIA-producing aerial tissues. Consistent with our earlier work, transcripts for the genes encoding the so-called early steps in monoterpenoid biosynthesis (ESMB) enzymes (HDS, others MEP pathway enzymes and geraniol 10 -hydroxylase) were preferentially co-localized to <b>internal</b> <b>phloem</b> associated parenchyma (IPAP) cells. By contrast, transcripts for the enzyme catalysing the last biosynthetic step to secologanin, secologanin synthase, were found in the epidermis. A coordinated response of ESMB genes was also observed in cell cultures stimulated to synthesise MIAs by hormone treatment, whereas no changes in SLS expression were detected under the same experimental conditions. Immunocytolabelling studies with the HDS-specific serum demonstrated the localisation of HDS to the plastid stroma and revealed that HDS proteins were most abundant in IPAP cells but could also be found in other cell types, including epidermal and mesophyll cells. Besides showing the existence of post-transcriptional mechanisms regulating the levels of HDS in C. roseus cells, our results support that intercellular translocation likely plays an important role during monoterpene-secoiridoid assembly...|$|E
40|$|International audienceMadagascar {{periwinkle}} (Catharanthus roseus [L. ] G. Don, Apocynaceae) produces monoterpene indole alkaloids (MIAs), secondary metabolites of {{high interest}} {{due to their}} therapeutic value. A key step in the biosynthesis is the generation of geraniol from geranyl diphosphate (GPP) in the monoterpenoid branch of the MIA pathway. Here {{we report on the}} cloning and functional characterization of C. roseus geraniol synthase (CrGES). The full-length CrGES was over-expressed in Escherichia coli and the purified recombinant protein catalyzed the conversion of GPP into geraniol with a K(m) value of 58. 5 μM for GPP. In vivo CrGES activity was evaluated by heterologous expression in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain mutated in the farnesyl diphosphate synthase gene. Analysis of culture extracts by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry confirmed the excretion of geraniol into the growth medium. Transient transformation of C. roseus cells with a Yellow Fluorescent Protein-fusion construct revealed that CrGES is localized in plastid stroma and stromules. In aerial plant organs, RNA in situ hybridization showed specific labeling of CrGES transcripts in the <b>internal</b> <b>phloem</b> associated parenchyma as observed for other characterized genes involved in the early steps of MIA biosynthesis. Finally, when cultures of Catharanthus cells were treated with the alkaloid-inducing hormone methyl jasmonate, an increase in CrGES transcript levels was observed. This observation coupled with the tissue-specific expression and the subcellular compartmentalization support the idea that CrGES initiates the monoterpenoid branch of the MIA biosynthetic pathway...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} two {{different}} chelating agents [EDTA and EDDS S,S-ethylenediaminedissucinic acid) ] on Zn tissue accumulation in Solanum nigrum L. grown in a naturally contaminated soil was assessed. Under those conditions, {{the response of the}} plant to the inoculation with two different isolates of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) – Glomus claroideum and Glomus intraradices – was also studied. Plants grown in the local contaminated soil (Zn levels of 433 mg Kgˉ¹ 1) accumulated up to 1191 mg Kgˉ¹ of Zn in the roots, 3747 mg Kgˉ¹ in the stems and 3409 mg Kgˉ¹ in the leaves. S. nigrum plants grown in the same soil spiked with extra Zn (Zn levels of 964 mg Kgˉ¹) accumulated up to 4735, 8267 and 7948 mg Zn Kgˉ¹ in the leaves, stems and roots, respectively. The addition of EDTA promoted an increase in the concentration of Zn accumulated by S. nigrum of up to 231 % in the leaves, 93 % in the stems and 81 % in the roots, while EDDS application enhanced the accumulation in leaves, stems and roots up to 140, 124 and 104 %, respectively. In the stems, the presence of Zn was predominantly detected in the cortex collenchyma cells, the starch sheath and the <b>internal</b> <b>phloem</b> and xylem parenchyma, and the addition of chelating agents did not seem to {{have an effect on the}} localisation of accumulation sites.

40|$|International audienceIsopentenyl {{diphosphate}} isomerases (IDI) catalyze the interconversion {{of the two}} isoprenoid universal C 5 units, isopentenyl diphosphate and dimethylally diphosphate, {{to allow}} the biosynthesis of the large variety of isoprenoids including both primary and specialized metabolites. This isomerisation is usually performed by two distinct IDI isoforms located either in plastids/peroxisomes or mitochondria/peroxisomes as recently established in Arabidopsis thaliana mainly accumulating primary isoprenoids. By contrast, almost nothing is known in plants accumulating specialized isoprenoids. Here we report the cloning and functional validation of an IDI encoding cDNA (CrIDI 1) from Catharanthus roseus that produces high amount of monoterpenoid indole alkaloids. The corresponding gene is expressed in all organs including roots, flowers and young leaves where transcripts have been detected in <b>internal</b> <b>phloem</b> parenchyma and epidermis. The CrIDI 1 gene also produces long and short transcripts giving rise to corresponding proteins with and without a N-terminal transit peptide (TP), respectively. Expression of green fluorescent protein fusions revealed that the long isoform is targeted to both plastids and mitochondria with an apparent similar efficiency. Deletion/fusion experiments established that the first 18 -residues of the N-terminal TP are solely responsible of the mitochondria targeting while the entire 77 -residue long TP is needed for an additional plastid localization. The short isoform is targeted to peroxisomes {{in agreement with the}} presence of peroxisome targeting sequence at its C-terminal end. This complex plastid/mitochondria/peroxisomes triple targeting occurring in C. roseus producing specialized isoprenoid secondary metabolites is somehow different from the situation observed in A. thaliana mainly producing housekeeping isoprenoid metabolites...|$|E
40|$|Opium poppy (Papaver somniferum) {{contains}} {{a large family}} of tyrosine/dihydroxyphenylalanine decarboxylase (tydc) genes involved in the biosynthesis of benzylisoquinoline alkaloids and cell wall-bound hydroxycinnamic acid amides. Eight members from two distinct gene subfamilies have been isolated, tydc 1, tydc 4, tydc 6, tydc 8, and tydc 9 in one group and tydc 2, tydc 3, and tydc 7 in the other. The tydc 8 and tydc 9 genes were located 3. 2 kb apart on one genomic clone, suggesting that the family is clustered. Transcripts for most tydc genes were detected only in roots. Only tydc 2 and tydc 7 revealed expression in both roots and shoots, and TYDC 3 mRNAs were the only specific transcripts detected in seedlings. TYDC 1, TYDC 8, and TYDC 9 mRNAs, which occurred in roots, were not detected in elicitor-treated opium poppy cultures. Expression of tydc 4, which {{contains a}} premature termination codon, was not detected under any conditions. Five tydc promoters were fused to the β-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene in a binary vector. All constructs produced transient GUS activity in microprojectile-bombarded opium poppy and tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) cell cultures. The organ- and tissue-specific expression pattern of tydc promoter-GUS fusions in transgenic tobacco was generally parallel to that of corresponding tydc genes in opium poppy. GUS expression was most abundant in the <b>internal</b> <b>phloem</b> of shoot organs and in the stele of roots. Select tydc promoter-GUS fusions were also wound induced in transgenic tobacco, suggesting that the basic mechanisms of developmental and inducible tydc regulation are conserved across plant species...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1970 Developmental {{changes in}} the storage organ of Brassica campestris L. were {{followed}} from {{the organization of the}} embryonic radicle and hypocotyl to the mature storage organ. Three independent primary meristems gave rise to the cortex, the stele, and the root cap-epidermis. The primary development is typical of the Cruciferae. Cambial activity was followed through serial tangential sections of the phloem from four areas of the storage organ; the crown, the hypocotyl, the upper root and the middle root. The anticlinal divisions of the crown's cambium were primarily longitudinal and transverse. The divisions in the hypocotyl, although greatly oblique had fewer 'longitudinal divisions. The cambium of the upper root had fewer longitudinal and greatly oblique anticlinal divisions. The anticlinal divisions of the middle root showed few greatly oblique divisions with most divisions being oblique to slightly oblique. New ray initials originated by transverse divisions of fusiform initials. Both ray and fusiform initials that were lost differentiated into parenchyma cells. Decline of fusiform initials was rare and in no case did ray initials originate in this fashion. As the storage organ expanded, interxylary phloem strands and vascular bundles appeared. Phloem strands differentiated following longitudinal divisions of the axial xylem parenchyma. As the organ enlarged, parenchyma cells surrounding the phloem strand divided, a cambium was formed, and tertiary phloem and xylem were produced. These interxylary vascular bundles formed a network which in the upper hypocotyl united to form a continuous band between the xylem and the pith. In the crown the vascular bundles of the basal leaves are bicolateral and the <b>internal</b> <b>phloem</b> is continuous with that of the interxylary phloem...|$|E

Most of the alkaloid and pre-alkaloid iridoid pathway has been elucidated, but some critical areas remain uncharacterized. The early iridoid pathway is localized to <b>internal</b> <b>phloem</b> associated parenchyma (IPAP) cells, with {{the latter part of the}} pathway localized to the epidermal cells indicating intercellular transport within the leaf tissue does occur. However, possible transport or translocation of MIAs or pre-MIAs between organs within Catharanthus roseus has not been studied. Previously, 3600 EMS (ethyl methane sulfonate) mutagenized C. roseus plants had been screened with a simple TLC (thin layer chromatography) to identify mutants with altered MIA profiles yielded one plant with trace MIA production. This trace MIA status was confirmed using UPLC-MS (Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry) and the plant had a thick, stocky, short root system, small leaves, a rigid stem, premature senescence and was susceptible to infection resulting in its rescue to in-vitro. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis of iridoid gene expression showed significant downregulation of several iridoid pathway genes as well as the downregulation of transcription factors BIS 1 and BIS 2. Feeding the trace MIA mutant roots the iridoid secologanin resulted in alkaloid production in the leaves. While grafting trace MIA mutant shoots onto MIA producing WT roots also resulted in alkaloid production in the mutant leaves. This study establishes that MIAs or pre-MIA iridoids, such as secologanin, may be translocated between the plant organs and this may be useful for the identification of novel transporters, enzymes, and transcription factors...|$|E
40|$|Background and AimsSuccessive {{vascular}} cambia {{are involved}} in the secondary growth of at least 200 woody species from > 30 plant families. In the mangrove Avicennia these successive cambia are organized in patches, creating stems with non-concentric xylem tissue surrounded by <b>internal</b> <b>phloem</b> tissue. Little is known about radial growth and tree stem dynamics in trees with this type of anatomy. This study aims to (1) clarify the process of secondary growth of Avicennia trees by studying its patchiness; and (2) study the radial increment of Avicennia stems, both temporary and permanent, in relation to local climatic and environmental conditions. A test is made of the hypothesis that patchy radial growth and stem dynamics enable Avicennia trees to better survive conditions of extreme physiological drought. MethodsStem variations were monitored by automatic point dendrometers at four different positions around and along the stem of two Avicennia marina trees in the mangrove forest of Gazi Bay (Kenya) during 1 year. Key ResultsPatchiness was found in the radial growth and shrinkage and swelling patterns of Avicennia stems. It was, however, potentially rather than systematically present, i. e. stems reacted either concentrically or patchily to environment triggers, and it was fresh water availability and not tidal inundation that affected radial increment. ConclusionsIt is concluded that the ability to develop successive cambia in a patchy way enables Avicennia trees to adapt to changes in the prevailing environmental conditions, enhancing its survival in the highly dynamic mangrove environment. Limited water could be used in a more directive way, investing all the attainable resources in only some locations of the tree stem so that at least at these locations there is enough water to, for example, overcome vessel embolisms or create new cells. As these locations change with time, the overall functioning of the tree can be maintained. JOURNAL ARTICLESCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|Mangrove forests grow in {{conditions}} {{which must be}} considered extreme for woody angiosperms: high and changing salinity, frequent inundation with associated hypoxia, low relative humidity {{of the air and}} high temperatures. As ‘marine formations’, mangrove ecosystems are characteristic for the intertidal area of estuaries, creeks, sheltered bays and coastlines in tropical and sub-tropical areas worldwide. The genus Avicennia {{has been shown to be}} eurytopic as regards the above mentioned environmental conditions. Locally, Avicennia can often be found at the seaward as well as at the landward side (Disjunct zonation pattern) of the mangrove forest, sites with highly contrasting environmental conditions, while globally it has the largest latitudinal range in both the Eastern and the Western biogeographic mangrove regions (i. e. Indo-West Pacific and East Africa vs. America and West Africa respectively). The question is how Avicennia copes with this large and varying range of environmental conditions? It already has been proven that the wood anatomy of Avicennia is especially adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Properties of the wood (transport tissues) were suggested to be adapted to reduce cavitation events, defined as air bubble formation in the xylem sap. Inside vessels, those air bubbles can enlarge and therewith block the water transport (i. e. vessel embolism) so that cavitation and subsequent embolism is highly influencing the functionality of the hydraulic system. Amongst mangrove trees, the genus Avicennia L. (Acanthaceae) stands out by its successive cambia (i. e. having not one cambial layer but subsequent active cambia possibly conferring many sites of active growth in the stem). Secondary growth by successive cambia can offer Avicennia ecological advantages since (1) the <b>internal</b> <b>phloem</b> tissue can store water that could be used in refilling air-filled vessels with water and (2) the special, patchy growth can offer the tree woody tissue that is well-adapted to the conditions of the moment. In this study we investigate the organization of the successive cambia in Avicennia in three dimensions in order to complete the already investigated three dimensional network of transport tissues (phloem and xylem). Small stems (max. diameter: 3 cm) and branches of Avicennia marina (Forssk.) Vierh. and A. officinalis L. were sampled from the Rekawa lagoon in Sri Lanka, where the two species encounter spatially and temporally varying conditions as regards salinity, inundation. Serial sections and microscopic observation of the samples allow the reconstruction and visualization of the three-dimensional organization of the successive cambia. The working hypothesis of the research is: ‘successive cambia are important for Avicennia to survive in extreme high environmental conditions and explains the genus eurytopic nature as compared to other mangrove genera’...|$|E
