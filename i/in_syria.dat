5|$|<b>In</b> <b>Syria</b> {{difficulties}} in executing immunization {{programs in the}} ongoing civil war led to a return of polio, probably in 2012, acknowledged by the WHO in 2013. 15 cases were confirmed among children <b>in</b> <b>Syria</b> between October and November 2013 in Deir Ezzor. Later, two more cases, one each in rural Damascus and Aleppo, were identified. It was the first outbreak <b>in</b> <b>Syria</b> since 1999. Doctors and international public health agencies report more than 90 cases of polio <b>in</b> <b>Syria,</b> with fears of contagion in rebel areas from lack of sanitation and safe-water services.|$|E

5|$|After Saladin conquered {{almost the}} whole Kingdom of Jerusalem {{in the second}} half of 1187, Sibylla, Queen of Jerusalem, sought shelter in Tripoli, which became a center of her supporters. The noblemen who {{condemned}} her husband, Guy of Lusignan, for the fall of the kingdom, joined Conrad of Montferrat at Tyros. Saladin decided to invade the crusader states <b>in</b> <b>Syria.</b> He started his military campaign against Tripoli in May 1188, but the arrival of the fleet of William II of Sicily saved the town. After Saladin captured Tortosa and Jabala (present-day Tartus and Jableh <b>in</b> <b>Syria)</b> in July, only Tripoli, Krak des Chevaliers, and the citadel at Tortosa remained under Christian rule in the county.|$|E

In January 1942, Peeler was among the men of the 2/2nd Pioneer Battalion who embarked aboard HMT Orcades for Sumatra but later diverted to Java. He was promoted to Warrant Officer Class II during this time.|$|E
5|$|In 1936, as {{a general}} strike was {{underway}} {{in the country to}} demand a renegotiation of the French role <b>in</b> <b>Syria,</b> Quwatli was appointed the Bloc's vice president of internal affairs, but {{was not part of the}} treaty negotiation committee which led talks with the French in Paris in March. A new treaty was established by the end of the month, although the French did not ratify it. Between then and fall, Quwatli spearheaded efforts to unify nationalists ranks <b>in</b> <b>Syria,</b> convincing LNA leader Sabri al-Asali to join the Bloc's highest governing body. By enlisting the support of many prominent pan-Arabists like himself, Quwatli strengthened his position within the Bloc, particularly in regards to his chief nationalist rival Jamil Mardam Bey.|$|E

5|$|In January 2016, Russia, for {{the first}} time in combat conditions, {{deployed}} four Su-35S planes to Khmeimim air base <b>in</b> <b>Syria</b> as part of Russian air operations in the country. This occurred following an increase in tension between Russia and Turkey as a result of reported incursions by Russian aircraft into Turkish airspace. The aircraft complemented the Su-30SMs in flying combat air patrols and providing protection to other aircraft that were conducting bombing missions. As a result of operations <b>in</b> <b>Syria,</b> problems were identified with the aircraft's avionics and were subsequently rectified. The aircraft presumably attained full operational capability in September 2017.|$|E
5|$|In his {{writings}} Aflaq had been stridently {{in favor of}} free speech and other human rights and aid for the lower classes. During the Military Committee's gradual take over of power <b>in</b> <b>Syria,</b> Aflaq rallied against {{what he saw as}} the establishment of a military dictatorship, instead of the democracy for which Aflaq had planned. These ideals were never realized by the governments that used his ideology. Most scholars see the Assad government <b>in</b> <b>Syria</b> and Saddam Hussein's government in Iraq to have only employed Aflaq's ideology as a pretense for dictatorship.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1958, Nasser formed a {{tripartite}} committee consisting of Zakaria Mohieddin, al-Hawrani, and Salah Bitar to oversee developments <b>in</b> <b>Syria.</b> By moving the latter two, who were Ba'athists, to Cairo, he neutralized important political figures who had their own ideas about how Syria should be run. He put Syria under Sarraj, who effectively reduced the province to a police state by imprisoning and exiling landholders who objected {{to the introduction of}} Egyptian agricultural reform <b>in</b> <b>Syria,</b> as well as communists. Following the Lebanese election of Fuad Chehab in September 1958, relations between Lebanon and the UAR improved considerably. On 25 March 1959, Chehab and Nasser met at the Lebanese–Syrian border and compromised on an end to the Lebanese crisis.|$|E

5|$|Research {{indicates}} that the salinity of the Euphrates water in Iraq has increased considerably since the nearly simultaneous construction of the Keban Dam in Turkey and the Tabqa Dam <b>in</b> <b>Syria.</b> This increase can, among other things, {{be related to the}} lower discharge of the Euphrates {{as a result of the}} construction of the Keban Dam and the dams of the Southeastern Anatolia Project (GAP) in Turkey, and to a lesser degree of the Tabqa Dam <b>in</b> <b>Syria.</b> High-salinity water is less useful for domestic and irrigation purposes.|$|E
