2500|$|Usually the {{starlings}} {{are considered}} a family, as is done here. Sibley & Monroe included the mimids {{in the family and}} demoted the starlings to tribe rank, as Sturnini. This treatment was used by Zuccon et al. However, the grouping of Sibley & Monroe (besides leaving the subfamily rank vacant) is overly coarse due to methodological drawbacks of their DNA-DNA <b>hybridization</b> <b>technique</b> and most of their proposed revisions of taxonomic rank have not been accepted (see for example Ciconiiformes). The all-inclusive Sturnidae grouping is all but noninformative as regards biogeography, and obscures the evolutionary distinctness of the three lineages. Establishing a valid name for the clade consisting of Sibley/Monroe's [...] "pan-Sturnidae" [...] would nonetheless be desirable to contrast them with the other major lineages of Muscicapoidea.|$|E

50|$|Techniques for characterizing primary DNA {{sequences}} {{could not}} be directly applied to methylation assays. For example, when DNA was amplified in PCR or bacterial cloning techniques, the methylation pattern was not copied and thus the information lost.

Radiolabeled RNA and cDNA probes were generated from sequences of the L 3 segment of BTV serotype 17. These probes were used to detect BTV RNA in pools of infected C. variipennis by hybridizing the probes directly to analyte immobilized on nylon membranes or by using a nucleic acid sandwich hybridization test. Hybridization procedures were able to detect 1 infected C. variipennis {{in a pool of}} 50 and as little as 3. 55 log 10 50 % tissue culture infective doses per ml of virus.

A {{patented}} in situ <b>hybridization</b> <b>technique</b> his lab developed for detecting RNA in morphologically preserved cells revealed that messenger RNA can localize in specific cellular compartments. This work has given rise to the field of RNA transport and localization, enhanced by Singer’s and his colleagues’ development of imaging technology and RNA reporters.

50|$|Based on RT-PCR {{techniques}} the urotensin II receptor {{appears to}} be expressed throughout the entire brain.

These two different results are because urotensin II receptor can also be found in blood vessels which is what the sensitive RT-PCR technique was likely detecting. Urotensin II receptors are also found in the cholinergic neurons of the spinal cord indicating some type of motor function.|$|E

40|$|Background: Bacteria {{associated}} with insects {{can have a}} substantial impact on the biology and life cycle of their host. The checkerboard DNA-DNA <b>hybridization</b> <b>technique</b> is a semi-quantitative technique that has been previously employed in odontology to detect and quantify a variety of bacterial species in dental samples. Here we tested {{the applicability of the}} checkerboard DNA-DNA <b>hybridization</b> <b>technique</b> to detect the presence of Aedes aegypti-associated bacterial species in larvae, pupae and adults of A. aegypti. Findings: Using the checkerboard DNA-DNA <b>hybridization</b> <b>technique</b> we could detect and estimate the number of four bacterial species in total DNA samples extracted from A. aegypti single whole individuals and midguts.
