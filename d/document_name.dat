5000|$|Between 1140 and 1150 seven royal {{charters}} and one private <b>document</b> <b>name</b> Gutierre as [...] "lord in Soria" [...] (domino in Soria), and he {{may have}} held it down to 1152 at least. As of 26 July 1148, Gutierre had accepted a co-tenant in Soria: Fortún López. About the same time (1148), he received the lordship of Roa de Duero. He may even have been appointed [...] "commander" [...] (adelantado) of the diocese of Osma. In 1145-46 he was lord of Arnedo. In 1148-49 he held the fortress of Rueda de Jalón, which had been surrendered to Alfonso VII after Gutierre's embassy to Sayf al-Dawla in 1131. This fortress lay only 35 km west of Zaragoza, which Raymond Berengar of Barcelona held as a vassal of Alfonso. At about this time contemporary charters begin to record his preeminence in the Castilian heartlands, Old Castile. He is referred to as [...] "prince of Castile" [...] (princeps Castelle) in imperial diplomas and in private documents. He was not usually called a prince (an informal title), and he never held the formal rank of count; his most common title in royal documents was simply [...] "potentate" [...] (potestas). This title was employed without any reference to a tenancy between 1143 and 1150. A later series of documents calls him [...] "potentate (or authority) in Castile" [...] (potestas in Castella) between 1156 and 1158, probably indicating a new administrative role in Old Castile in conjunction with the succession events of 1157 and 1158. A fuero promulgated by the abbot of Santa María de Husillos on 21 November 1160 refers to the authority Gutierre still possessed in Castile at that time.|$|E

40|$|In early June of 1940 Lithuania’s Foreign Minister Juozas Urbšys sent a {{telegram}} (No. 288) to Lithuania’s missions abroad. The most often cited sentence from {{it is the}} last: “Should catastrophe strike us here, you are to regard Lozoraitis as the chief of our diplomatic service abroad, Klimas as the first deputy, and Šaulys as the second. ” When the Soviets occupied Lithuania a few weeks later, this telegram fragment became the start of Lithuanian exile diplomacy. For more than six decades the Lithuanian Diplomatic Service (LDS) was active abroad as the only remaining state institution of Lithuania. The telegram’s last sentence, possibly just an afterthought, raises many questions even today. The archives of the diplomats themselves, recollections of their contemporaries, and Lithuanian historiography yield somewhat different versions of that telegram’s text. Thus this article investigates the circumstances and motives surrounding the naming of the LDS Chief and his deputis {{as well as the}} problems involved in passing on these duties to others. Stasys Lozoraitis served as LDS Chief for more than 40 years. As his first deputy Petras Klimas was imprisoned and deported to Siberia, and the second, Dr. Jurgis Šaulys, died in 1948, Lozoraitis remained alone among the three persons mentioned in the telegram. The question of his succession and deputies was discussed several times in the ranks of the LDS itself. It was especially pressing in 1957 with the death of Povilas Žadeikis, Lithuania’s envoy to Washington when Lozoraitis himself was slated to be his successor. But only in 1978 did Lozoraitis in a separate <b>document</b> <b>name</b> Dr. Stasys Antanas Bačkis as the LDS Chief’s deputy and empower him to take over his duties in the case of his death. When Lozoraitis died in 1983, Bačkis served as LDS Chief until the reestablishment of Lithuanian independence, after which he transferred his powers to the Lithuanian Foreign Ministry and discontinued the LDS on September 6, 1991...|$|E
40|$|Organization LUND UNIVERSITY Department of Surgery, Clinical Sciences Skånes University Hospital Lund SE- 221 85 Lund Sweden <b>Document</b> <b>name</b> DOCTORAL DISSERTATION Date of issue: November 8, 2013 Author(s) : Daniel Åkerberg Sponsoring {{organization}} Title and subtitle: Differently charged polypeptides {{and their}} impact on peritoneal and pleural postoperative adhesion formation Abstract: Abdominal adhesions are formed after previous peritoneal traumas where previous surgery poses the most frequent cause. An increasing number of clinical complications due to adhesions have been detected such as small bowel obstructions, female infertility, and pain. Postoperative adhesions also form in pleura and pericardium after thoracic surgery. Complications include risk of bleeding, organ perforation and prolonged surgery, both in the thorax and abdomen, during reoperations. Previous reports have shown increased healthcare expenditures due to complications of abdominal adhesions. Several prophylactic anti-adhesion devices exist on the market, but none of them are sufficient in every aspect, such as being able to be used during abdominal infections, bleeding and in case of an intestinal anastomosis. The use of two differently charged polypeptides covering the peritoneal wounds during surgery has, in previous studies, shown promising anti-adhesion effects. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate whether the polypeptides in any way affected different important healing aspects of the peritoneum and if the polypeptides may be administered as a spray in an animal study (I). Furthermore, the aim was to elucidate if the administered polypeptides affected important aspects of the healing process during an extended time dynamic pattern (II). It was also investigated whether the polypeptides reduced adhesions after adhesiolysis in the abdomen (III) and pleura (IV), and if there was an impact on peritoneal/pleural healing. In order to investigate the impact of polypeptides, an in vitro cell model was set up (V). A significant decrease in adhesions was seen both in the abdomen and pleura using the polypeptides. A significant decrease in adhesion reformation was seen after adhesiolysis and polypeptide administration. Despite some variation, no significant impact on key parameters of peritoneal and pleural resolving processes were seen after administration of the polypeptides. It was feasible to administer the polypeptides with a spray atomizer. Cell proliferation was decreased when higher concentrations of the polypeptides were administered, indicating a dose response relationship relying on the configuration and amount of charges of the polypeptides. In conclusion, the use of the two differently charged polypeptides to prevent abdominal and pleural adhesions was feasible, reducing adhesions after primary surgery and relaparotomy, without affecting key parameters of the resolving process investigated.

40|$|Maria Nyman The Borders of travelling. Russia in Swedish travel {{accounts}} {{during the}} 18 th century. The primary {{objective of this}} study concerns how culturally created images of the Same and the Other, is expressed in descriptions of a journey, a sojourn someplace else. More specifically, the dissertation investigates how a number of Swedes, travelling during the eighteenth- and early nineteenth centuries, described their experiences in and of, Russia. The analysis focus on how the journey is described, the person writing, and the discursive formation of borders which inform the text. The {{first part of the}} study centre on the “scientific” creation of Russia and its borderlands. Here, the travel writers make clear Russia’s key position as a borderland between Europe and Asia, as well as the centrality of mapping the unknown for knowledge to underpin both the Russian and the European self-image. The consequent knowledge of the Other, the people of north-east Siberia in particular, could then be disseminated throughout Europe’s universities and Academies of Science. Here, Russia is seen as a sort of”stage” were travelers, natural historians and mapmakers fought for positions in this transmission of knowledge. Many of the travelers lingered on themes common in several accounts from the time. The question; are they civilized? Echoes in the accounts. I have shown how traveler’s descriptions of the religious practices of the Russians, of gender relations, and in particular, descriptions of women, were frequently commented upon. Most notably, it was the encounter with the Russian orthodox religion that created the clearest divide between a Swedish protestant ”Us” and a Russian ”Them”, but also, this divide decreased when travelers encountered people and religious practices outside the Russian orthodox sphere. How ”othering” is a practice carried out on a floating scale, becomes evident here. Two concepts, or phenomena, create boundaries in many of these accounts and in travel accounts in general, these are the concepts representation/image and encounter. In the two last chapters, the Swedish/Finnish traveler and prisoner of war, Adelaide von Hauswolff’s and the student Eric Gustaf Ehrström’s, travel diaries are studied. Here, the question of why some travelers seem to describe encounters, and seemingly, comes close to the country and its inhabitants, when others do not, is in focus. The traveler’s position within the texts is studied and categories such as gender, class, and ethnicity are seen as categories directing the positions taken by the travel writer. These categories influenced the texts to a great extent, but not always at the same time. Encounters were being described, positions altered, discourses challenged, but also withheld. Travelers wrote on different subjects, with different strategies, from different places and for different reasons. And still, centuries-old images and a discursively constructed knowledge of Russia, put its strong mark on these 18 th centuries’ texts.
