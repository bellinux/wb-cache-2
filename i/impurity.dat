In addition, if the electrode is not well protected by the gas shield or the operator accidentally allows it to contact the molten metal, it can become dirty or contaminated. This often causes the welding arc to become unstable, requiring that the electrode be ground with a diamond abrasive to remove the <b>impurity.</b>|$|E

The scientists proposed different names for the elements: Urbain chose neoytterbium and lutecium, whereas Welsbach chose aldebaranium and cassiopeium (after Aldebaran and Cassiopeia).

5|$|Silicon is {{a common}} <b>impurity</b> in diamond films grown by {{chemical}} vapor deposition and it originates either from silicon substrate or from silica windows or walls of the CVD reactor. It was also observed in natural diamonds in dispersed form. Isolated silicon defects have been detected in diamond lattice through the sharp optical absorption peak at 738nm and electron paramagnetic resonance. Similar to other large impurities, the major form of silicon in diamond has been identified with a Si-vacancy complex (semi-divacancy site). This center is a deep donor having an ionization energy of 2 eV, and thus again is unsuitable for electronic applications.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Vacuum {{evaporation}} {{is usually}} utilized to remove volatile <b>impurities</b> in {{metallurgical grade silicon}} to prepare solar grade silicon by metallurgical routes.

The {{results indicated that the}} content of <b>impurities</b> in raw material had deep effect on the removal efficiency of vacuum evaporation. The high quality product can be obtained by vacuum evaporation only once from raw materials with the lower content of <b>impurities</b> whereas it is not for high content of <b>impurities</b> in raw material. This is due to the vapor-liquid equilibrium in the vacuum furnace. The <b>impurities</b> can be removed effectively by vacuum evaporation many times...|$|R

The major <b>impurity</b> is usually thorium dioxide (ThO2); even the purest thorium specimens usually contain about a tenth of a percent of the dioxide. Experimental measurements of its density give values between 11.5and11.66g/cm3: these are slightly lower than the theoretically expected value of 11.7g/cm3 calculated from thorium's lattice parameters, perhaps due to microscopic voids forming in the metal when it is cast. These values lie between those of its neighbours actinium (10.1g/cm3) and protactinium (15.4g/cm3), part of a trend across the early actinides.|$|E
