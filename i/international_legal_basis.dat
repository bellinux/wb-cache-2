As with traditional qualified signature approaches, strong authentication of the signatory to the system is ensured by two factors.

This is an asset, considering that the Common Foreign and Security Policy is traditionally considered the least effective of the three EU pillars. In this field of EU Law there is an aspect deserving attention, namely the international legal aspect of the EU competence in crisis management. In fact, the implementation of ESDP requires one to consider the role of EU in the United Nations collective security system, in order to identify the <b>international</b> <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> of EU peace missions. This is not a simple task. The UN collective security system has the appearance of a patchwork obtained by stitching together legal and political ‘pieces’, and the presence of different sources can make more difficult to legally frame activities of international organizations for peace.

First chapter deals with definition of SEA, its advantages and disadvantages and its relationship with Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). SEA was introduced in order to overcome the limits of EIA, mainly EIA's inability to deal with cumulative impacts and wrong timing. Second chapter is about <b>international</b> <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> of SEA. Several international treaties regarding SEA are mentioned, among others Treaty from Espoo and Kyiv Protocol. Third chapter outlines development of SEA in European Union law. At first a broader context of European environmental law is set out {{and some of the}} basic principles are defined. Subsequently history of SEA Directive is described and its content is analyzed. Also a comparison of SEA Directive and Kyiv Protocol is provided. Fourth chapter deals with legal framework of SEA in the Czech Republic. At first, history of SEA legislative in the Czech Republic is introduced. Then contemporary law, i. e.

40|$|Inherent in and at {{the core}} of the right to fair trial in Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights is the concept of {{equality}} of arms, the construct to which this thesis is devoted within the context of criminal proceedings. As a contextual prelude to specific analysis of this concept, a background for Article 6 is first established which identifies influential historical developments in trial rights and provides an outline of the rationale for the Convention and of the content, and applicability, of the article. Thereafter, the thesis offers a theoretical insight on equality of arms, identifying and exploring its value, contemporary <b>international</b> <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> and constituent elements as per the Strasbourg definition. The insight on the latter recognises an underpinning relationship between the concept of equality of arms and Article 6 (3), and introduces the key argument in the thesis: the European Court of Human Rights equates inequality of arms not with procedural inequality in itself, which would be a dignitarian interpretation, but with procedural inequality that gives rise to actual or, in some circumstances, inevitable prejudice. This argument predominates the subsequent survey of case-law in which the Court’s approach to procedural equality is demonstrated and assessed within the context of the right to challenge and call witness evidence (Article 6 (3) (d)), the right to adequate time and facilities (Article 6 (3) (b)) and the right to legal assistance (Article 6 (3) (c)). Though the thesis is based on Article 6 decisions of the Court and, to a lesser extent, the former European Commission of Human Rights, references are made throughout to other national and international legal instruments and judgements whenever instructive.

40|$|Passenger {{air traffic}} in Europe has seen {{considerable}} {{growth in the}} past decades. The market-entry of Low-Cost-Carriers (LCC) has extended the traditional markets of Network Carriers (NC) and Charter-Airlines (CA) by offering low fares to a broad public, which otherwise would not fly. Given the fact that air traffic now accounts for about 3 % of total CO 2 -emissions, this strong traffic increase gave uplift to supporters of a kerosene tax. An environmental tax on kerosene would internalize external effects of air travel and therefore give an incentive to airlines to use the most modern aircrafts and engines {{as well as to}} optimize their network structure. At first this paper examines the economic as well as the <b>international</b> <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> for a tax on kerosene. By assigning monetary values to the emissions of air traffic it is then possible to determine three possible tax levels (low, medium and high). Subsequently the cost structure of different carrier models is investigated and the impact of a tax on the cost of different flight hauls is estimated. By adding the additional costs onto the current fares of air carriers it is examined by how much, the actual ticket prices would rise. Afterwards these fares increases are set in relation with price elasticities of different customer segments, which gives an insight on the passenger reductions that the different carriers would suffer. Finally it is also examined how a tax would change the existing market shares of carrier types on different segments. These calculations are done for two possible tax areas: while in the first one only kerosene of intra-EU flights is subject of the tax, in the latter all kerosene which is taken on board within the EU would be charged. The results indicate that in the short and medium haul segment LCC would be worst hit. ( [...] .)

40|$|The {{growth in}} the use of {{collective}} and unilateral economic sanctions in the post-Cold-War epoch calls for a re-examination of the <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> and constraints on the implementation of sanctions. This thesis is an attempt to explore, from a legal point of view, the problems and restrictions associated with sanctions, and suggest ways in which economic sanctions can be rendered more legitimate in terms of <b>international</b> <b>legal</b> requirements. Unilateral and collective economic sanctions are based on different legal premises: the traditional theory of retaliation and treaty principles respectively. It will be argued that a breach of an erga omnes obligation is also a legitimate <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> for economic sanctions. Key cases in which sanctions have been used will be reviewed and it will be contended that, in addition to traditional economic considerations, sanctions should be subject to other limitations such as respect for principles of international humanitarian law. Issues regarding the legitimacy of the Security Council's actions and authority will also be addressed and possible ways of controlling the actions of the Security Council will be put forth. After determining the restrictions on implementation of sanctions, proposals for refining current practices of imposing economic sanctions are submitted. In conclusion, it is submitted that unilateral sanctions are subject to serious legal constraints and that collective sanctions have the potential of being used in a more humane and institutionally coherent way...|$|R

40|$|The {{choice of}} the <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> for a given measure can {{influence}} the procedure by which legislation is adopted, and thereby the scope and content of EU policy. The ambiguity surrounding the choice of <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> for environmental acts based in Articles 130 s and 100 a {{opened the way for}} a 'legal-basis game', where EU institutions chose the <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> partly on the basis of political considerations. In the period 1987 - 93, the two most important legal bases for environmental acts (Articles 130 s and 100 a) were subject to very different procedures for adoption (unanimity and qualified majority voting, respectively). From 1993 onwards, both articles were subject to qualified majority voting. After a general discussion of the choice of <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> and its significance for policy, this paper examines the choice of <b>legal</b> <b>basis</b> for environmental legislation during the period 1987 - 99.

40|$|This chapter, a {{contribution}} to a book on <b>International</b> <b>Legal</b> Positivism in a Post-Modern World, gauges the potential for mutually enriching interactions between <b>international</b> <b>legal</b> positivism and legal realism. It first describes the encounter between legal positivism and legal realism in the U.

In a concluding section, the chapter assesses the compatibilities and tensions between the new <b>international</b> <b>legal</b> realism and the new <b>international</b> <b>legal</b> positivism. With its forthright embrace of the inescapability of uncertainty in law, the new <b>international</b> <b>legal</b> positivism adopts a sceptical position very similar to legal realism. However, this chapter contends, the new <b>international</b> <b>legal</b> positivism still requires a realist supplement in order to provide a fuller understanding {{of the way in which}} legal norms interact with non-legal factors and to help us describe, predict and analyse the behaviour of actors in international affairs. At the same time, new <b>international</b> <b>legal</b> realists can learn from the sceptical attitude towards sources of law that new <b>international</b> <b>legal</b> positivists have developed. The two movements can be symbiotic if brought into closer dialogue. Nonetheless, this chapter concludes with a dose of pessimism about the capacity of any of the currently available theories of international law to fully assimilate the complexities of both postmodern theory and postmodern global society into a comprehensive theory of international law in the postmodern world...|$|R
