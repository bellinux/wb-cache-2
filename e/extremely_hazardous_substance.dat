5|$|Elemental bromine is toxic {{and causes}} {{chemical}} burns on human flesh. Inhaling bromine gas results in similar irritation of the respiratory tract, causing coughing, choking, and shortness of breath, and death if inhaled in large enough amounts. Chronic exposure {{may lead to}} frequent bronchial infections and a general deterioration of health. As a strong oxidising agent, bromine is incompatible with most organic and inorganic compounds. Caution is required when transporting bromine; it is commonly carried in steel tanks lined with lead, supported by strong metal frames. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) of the United States has set a permissible exposure limit (PEL) for bromine at a time-weighted average (TWA) of 0.1ppm. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) of TWA 0.1ppm and a short-term limit of 0.3ppm. The exposure to bromine immediately dangerous to life and health (IDLH) is 3ppm.

40|$|On December 5, 1984, a {{pesticide}} {{manufacturing plant}} leaked highly toxic methyl isocyanate (MIC) {{and the resulting}} cloud of gas killed over 2, 000 people and injured more than 200, 000 others living in the shantytowns of Bhopal, India. While no toxic accident in the United States has approached the magnitude of Bhopal, a 1988 United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) study found that 11, 048 accidental releases of <b>extremely</b> <b>hazardous</b> <b>substances</b> occurred between 1982 and 1986. These accidents caused 309 deaths, 11, 341 injuries and the evacuation of 464, 677 people from homes and jobs. The EPA estimated that seventeen of these accidents could have caused more damage than Bhopal if climate and other factors had been different. Fred Millar, director of the Environmental Policy Institute 2 ̆ 7 s Toxic Chemical Safety and Health Project, has argued that millions of Americans are at risk from chemicals such as hydrofluoric acid, which is widely used by oil refineries to boost the octane levels of unleaded gas. To prevent catastrophic accidents, government must create incentives to encourage industry to substitute less harmful chemicals or store smaller quantities of toxic materials. This Article examines two methods for industry to internalize the social costs associated with reducing the risks of toxic accidents. First, the Article proposes {{a new type of}} incentive system called a toxic death risk index tax that would tax a user of <b>extremely</b> <b>hazardous</b> chemicals based upon how many people might be injured in case of a foreseeable accidental release. This Article will argue that such a tax is necessary because the tort liability system does not force firms to internalize the full costs of their activities because of the possibility that a firm may file for bankruptcy and not pay the full costs of an accident. In addition, this Article examines the neglected issue of mitigating the consequences of accidents and argues in favor of requiring buffer zones around facilities using <b>extremely</b> <b>hazardous</b> <b>substances</b> {{to reduce the number of}} potential injuries in adjacent residential areas. The buffer zone is another method of internalizing social costs. The tax and buffer proposals are interrelated because one method of reducing tax liability is for a firm to buy more buffer land...|$|R

The text is excerpted, with minor modifications, from the corresponding chapter of CRS Report RL 30798, Environmental Laws: Summaries of Statutes Administered by the Environmental Protection Agency, which summarizes 12 major environmental statutes. The Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (42 U. S. C. 11001 - 11050) was enacted in 1986 as Title III of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (P. L. 99 - 499). In Subtitle A, EPCRA established a national framework for EPA to mobilize local government officials, businesses, and other citizens to plan ahead for chemical accidents in their communities.

40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The United States has generated over 75, 000 metric tons of spent nuclear fuel and high-level nuclear waste [...] <b>extremely</b> <b>hazardous</b> <b>substances</b> [...] at 80 sites in 35 states {{and is expected to}} more than double that amount by 2055. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (NWPA) required the Department of Energy (DOE) to investigate a geologic repository for nuclear waste. In 1987, Congress amended NWPA to direct DOE to focus on a repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. In 2008, DOE submitted a license application for the repository but in March 2010 moved to withdraw it. However, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) or the courts [...] as a result of federal lawsuits [...] might compel DOE to resume the licensing process. GAO has reported on options for interim storage of this waste and the effects a Yucca Mountain termination could have on both commercial waste and DOE-managed waste. This testimony is based on that prior work and discusses (1) the status of the Yucca Mountain repository and national policy for nuclear waste disposal, (2) options for storing nuclear waste and their benefits and challenges, and (3) principal lessons that can be learned from past nuclear waste management efforts. ...|$|R
40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The principal role of the Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board (CSB) is to investigate accidental releases of regulated or <b>extremely</b> <b>hazardous</b> <b>substances</b> to determine the conditions and circumstances {{that led to the}} accident and to identify the cause or causes so that similar accidents might be prevented. Accidental releases of these toxic and hazardous chemicals occur frequently and often have serious consequences. CSB reported to Congress that the agency received notification of approximately 900 chemical accidents in calendar year 2007, and that 31 of these accidents were serious or even fatal events that warranted the commitment of CSB investigators. CSB began operating in 1998 as an independent agency created under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. The act directs CSB to (1) investigate and report on the cause or probable cause of any accidental chemical releases from stationary sources resulting in a fatality, serious injury, or substantial property damages; (2) make recommendations to reduce the likelihood or consequences of accidental chemical releases and propose corrective measures; and (3) establish regulations for reporting accidental releases. The agency publishes investigative reports and issues safety studies and videos to help prevent future accidents. Congress modeled CSB after the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), which has a similar public safety mission. Like NTSB, CSB has no enforcement authority and a limited regulatory role. As outlined in the authorizing statute, CSB is to be managed by a five-member board. Currently the board has one vacancy. CSB received an appropriation of $ 9. 4 million for fiscal year 2008 and had 39 staff as of January 30, 2008. ...|$|R

40|$|Ammonia {{is present}} in {{agriculture}} and commerce in many if not most communities. This report evaluates the toxic potency of ammonia, based on three types of data: anecdotal data, in some cases predating World War 1, reconstructions of contemporary industrial accidents, and animal bioassays. Standards and guidelines for human exposure have been driven largely by the anecdotal data, suggesting that ammonia at 5, 000 - 10, 000 parts per million, volume/volume (ppm-v), might be lethal within 5 - 10 min. However, contemporary accident reconstructions suggest that ammonia lethality requires higher concentrations. For example, 33, 737 ppm-v was a 5 -min zero-mortality value in a major ammonia release in 1973 in South Africa. Comparisons of secondary reports of ammonia lethality with original sources revealed discrepancies in contemporary sources, apparently resulting from failure to examine old documents or accurately translate foreign documents. The present investigation revealed that contemporary accident reconstructions yield ammonia lethality levels comparable to those in dozens of reports of animal bioassays, after adjustment of concentrations to human equivalent concentrations via U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) procedures. Ammonia levels potentially causing irreversible injury or impairing the ability of exposed people to escape from further exposure or from coincident perils similarly have been biased downwardly in contemporary sources. The EPA has identified ammonia as one of 366 <b>extremely</b> <b>hazardous</b> <b>substances</b> subject to community right-to-know provisions of the Superfund Act and emergency planning provisions of the Clean Air Act. The Clean Air Act defines emergency planning zones (EPZs) around industrial facilities exceeding a threshold quantity of ammonia on-site.
