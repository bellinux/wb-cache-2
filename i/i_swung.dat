2500|$|Bush's nickname, [...] "Donie", was {{reportedly}} bestowed {{on him as}} a result of a comment by Detroit teammate Ed Killian in 1909. Bush explained, [...] "One day after I had struck out, I asked Eddie Killian what kind of ball <b>I</b> <b>swung</b> at and missed. Killian said it was a donie ball. I never learned what a donie ball was, but the Tigers started calling me Donie and the name just stuck." ...|$|E
60|$|With silent paddle <b>I</b> <b>swung</b> {{slowly into}} {{the wake of the}} larger craft.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Pike {{turned on}} his heel, and <b>I</b> <b>swung</b> {{alongside}} of him as he moved aft.|$|E
60|$|CLEOPATRA (gasping). Oh, I'm smothered. Oh, Caesar; a {{man stood}} {{on me in}} the boat; and a great sack of {{something}} fell upon {{me out of the}} sky; and then the boat sank, and then <b>I</b> was <b>swung</b> up into the air and bumped down.|$|R
60|$|I had {{addressed}} him by {{his real}} name. Never a turnip fell from a bumping, laden cart, and the driver more unconscious of it, than I that I had dropped that word. I re-entered the house, but had not reached my chair when McKenzie's hand fell roughly on me, and <b>I</b> was <b>swung</b> round.|$|R
5|$|It {{was first}} time <b>I</b> ever <b>swung</b> wood full time. I was {{learning}} how to play pro ball. I had never played every day in my life. That's totally different.... You {{have to learn to}} conserve your energy. In college, you just left it all out on the field every game. In pro ball, you do that and you'll wear out, because you play every single day.|$|R
6000|$|... "I wish I {{could say}} the same," [...] I replied with {{appropriate}} dejection, as <b>I</b> <b>swung</b> in beside her, for she had evinced her intention of promenading.|$|E
60|$|The next instant <b>I</b> <b>swung</b> round, as Flora {{uttered a}} piteous little cry; and there, behind us, in the outlet of the cutting, stood Major Chevenix and Ronald.|$|E
60|$|With that, <b>I</b> <b>swung</b> on my heel, strode {{past the}} big-eyed girl, {{out of that}} foul kennel into God's sweet air, {{followed}} by the ordures of speech which that knave flung after me.|$|E
60|$|Twice {{again in}} the next forty-eight hours Luigi was taken out and interrogated. After that, a gibbering imbecile, he went to live in Bughouse Alley. He has a strong constitution. His {{shoulders}} are broad, his nostrils wide, his chest is deep, his blood is pure; {{he will continue to}} gibber in Bughouse Alley long after <b>I</b> have <b>swung</b> off and escaped the torment of the penitentiaries of California.|$|R
60|$|As {{the great}} gate where <b>I</b> stood <b>swung</b> open my fifty Tharks, headed by Tars Tarkas himself, rode in upon their mighty thoats. I {{led them to}} the palace walls, which I {{negotiated}} easily without assistance. Once inside, however, the gate gave me considerable trouble, but I finally was rewarded by seeing it swing upon its huge hinges, and soon my fierce escort was riding across the gardens of the jeddak of Zodanga.|$|R
60|$|Consider, if you please. For {{six days}} I had been {{oscillating}} within a pretty complete circumference of alarms. It is small blame to me, I hope, {{that with my}} nerve on so nice a pivot, <b>I</b> quivered and <b>swung</b> to this new apprehension like {{a needle in a}} compass-box.|$|R
60|$|Not a sound! Either the sentry was asleep, or he {{had gone}} on his round, {{and for a few}} moments the way was free. Without a moment's {{hesitation}} <b>I</b> <b>swung</b> my leg over the sill.|$|E
6000|$|... "My friend Pajol was {{swearing}} to himself. 'Well, then--go to the devil!' he shouted, exasperated. But as <b>I</b> <b>swung</b> round he repented, for I {{heard him}} say hurriedly, 'Shoot the fool's horse before he gets away.|$|E
60|$|I {{kept the}} {{advantage}} over Greaser, {{but still he}} punished me cruelly. Suddenly he got his snaky hands on my throat and began to choke me. With all my might <b>I</b> <b>swung</b> my fist into his stomach.|$|E
2500|$|Until 1936, {{principles}} of staff recruitment, told by Keswick, remained Scottish first, Oxbridge second. [...] "With all due {{deference to the}} 'east coast of England' [...] I do feel that men from {{north of the border}} are the most suitable for our routine business... I am very keen on keeping the Scottish entity of the Firm. But I hope I have not conveyed that <b>I</b> have <b>swung</b> against the University man... I merely consider that he must be aided and abettered by the solid, plodding type from Scotland." ...|$|R
60|$|The air {{was full}} {{of these and other}} voices as the dinghy, checking, <b>swung.</b> <b>I</b> passed one hand down Laughton's {{stretched}} arm and felt an iron gooseneck and a foot or two of a backward-sloping torpedo-net boom. The other hand I laid on broad, cold iron--even the flanks of H.M.S. Cryptic, which is twelve thousand tons.|$|R
60|$|A {{part of my}} {{duty was}} to watch the fanning mill (in the high cupola) in order that the sieves should not clog. Three flights of stairs led to the mill and these had to be mounted many times each day. I always ran up the steps when the mill {{required}} my attention, but in coming down <b>I</b> usually <b>swung</b> from beam to beam, dropping from footway to footway like a monkey from a tall tree. My mother in seeing me do this called out in terror, but I assured her {{that there was not}} the slightest danger--and this was true, for I was both sure-footed and sure-handed in those days.|$|R
60|$|A servant held my stirrup, and <b>I</b> <b>swung</b> {{myself up}} into the saddle, with which I was but indifferently acquainted. Then Arcolano mounted too, puffing over the effort, for he was a corpulent, rubicund man with the fattest hands I have ever seen.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>swung</b> my hatchet {{and split}} off {{a section of}} bark. Everywhere in the bark and round the tree ran little dust-filled grooves. I pried {{out a number of}} tiny brown beetles, {{somewhat}} the shape of a pinching-bug, only very much smaller.|$|E
60|$|I let {{him come}} almost upon me. Then I ducked beneath his outstretched arms, {{at the same time}} {{sidestepping}} to the right. Pivoting on my left toe, <b>I</b> <b>swung</b> a terrific right to his jaw, and, like a felled ox, he dropped in his tracks.|$|E
6000|$|... "Falmouth, July 6th, 1841.--I have at last my own study made comfortable; {{the carpet}} being now laid down, {{and most of}} my {{appurtenances}} in tolerable order. By and by I shall, unless stopped by illness, get myself together, and begin living an orderly life and doing my daily task. <b>I</b> have <b>swung</b> a cot in my dressing-room; partly as a convenience for myself, partly {{as a sort of}} memorial of my poor Uncle, in whose cot in his dressing-room at Lisworney I remember to have slept when a child. I have put a good large bookcase in my drawing-room, {{and all the rest of}} my books fit very well into the study." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{tethered}} {{his horse}} to an iron peg, beckoned {{me to do}} the same, and then, moving forward until we stood on the highest of the rise, pointed to something that rose darkly from the grass. Then <b>I</b> remembered, and <b>swung</b> my hat to my knee, as my eyes rested on a little wooden cross. Following the hand he stretched out, I could read the rude letters cut on it--"Helen Boone." ...|$|R
60|$|You {{would have}} been proud of me, my friends, if you could have seen and heard me, for I clashed my sabre as <b>I</b> spoke, and <b>swung</b> my dolman as though my {{regiment}} was picketed outside in the courtyard. They listened to me in silence, but the back of the Prince bowed more and more as though the burden which weighed upon it was greater than his strength. He looked round with haggard eyes.|$|R
60|$|Far ahead I {{presently}} heard a {{deep and}} sullen roar which increased in volume as I advanced, and then broke upon my ears with all the intensity of its mad fury as <b>I</b> <b>swung</b> round a sharp curve into a dimly lighted stretch of water.|$|E
60|$|It was sacrilege to wake that dreaming house-front {{with the}} clatter of machinery, but <b>I</b> <b>swung</b> the car to clear the turf, brushed {{along the edge of}} the wood and turned in on the broad stone path where the fountain-basin lay like one star-sapphire.|$|E
60|$|I ran {{forward with}} my companions; {{but it was}} {{impossible}} to use the musket, even had I been eager to shoot, because of the darkness, and as <b>I</b> <b>swung</b> the weapon from side to side, striving to feel my way, some one clutched me by the throat.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am a reactionary--so {{complete}} a reactionary that my position is incomprehensible to you {{who live in}} a veiled lie of social organization and whose sight is not keen enough to pierce the veil. You make believe that you believe in the survival of the strong and the rule of the strong. I believe. That is the difference. When I was a trifle younger,--a few months younger,--I believed the same thing. You see, the ideas of you and yours had impressed me. But merchants and traders are cowardly rulers at best; they grunt and grub all their days in the trough of money-getting, and <b>I</b> have <b>swung</b> back to aristocracy, if you please. I am the only individualist in this room. I look to the state for nothing. I look only to the strong man, the man on horseback, to save the state from its own rotten futility." ...|$|R
6000|$|But I never {{stayed to}} answer him. Unless I acted quickly blood would assuredly be shed. I {{was the one}} man who could explain matters, {{and it was a}} mercy for Lesperon that I should have been at hand in the hour of his meeting that fire-eater Marsac. I forgot the {{circumstances}} in which I stood to Castelroux; I forgot everything but the imminent necessity that I should intervene. Some seven feet below our window was the roof of the porch; from that to the ground it might be some eight feet more. Before my Gascon captain knew what I was about, <b>I</b> had <b>swung</b> myself down from the window on to the projecting porch. A second later, I created a diversion by landing {{in the midst of the}} courtyard fray, with the alarmed Castelroux--who imagined that I was escaping--following by the same unusual road, and shouting as he came [...] "Monsieur de Lesperon! Hi! Monsieur de Lesperon! Mordieu! Remember your parole, Monsieur de Lesperon!" ...|$|R
60|$|Then, one by one, they swore allegiance, till all had sworn. And, having sworn, {{my father}} took me by the hand; he led me in solemn {{procession}} into {{each of the seven}} Sanctuaries that are in this Temple of Ra-Men-Ma, and in each <b>I</b> made offerings, <b>swung</b> incense, and officiated as priest. Clad in the Royal robes I made offerings in the Shrine of Horus, in the Shrine of Isis, in the Shrine of Osiris, in the Shrine of Amen-Ra, in the Shrine of Horemku, in the Shrine of Ptah, till at length I reached the Shrine of the King's Chamber.|$|R
60|$|I {{waited until}} I saw {{him under the}} lights of the Grand Walk, and fairly running. Then <b>I</b> <b>swung</b> on my heel. I was of two minds whether to wait for Comyn, by far the wiser course. The unthinking {{recklessness}} I had inherited drove me on.|$|E
60|$|With {{the flat}} of my sword I struck down his polluting hand; and {{grasping}} Dejah Thoris round the waist, <b>I</b> <b>swung</b> her behind me as, with my back against the draperies of the dais, I faced the tyrant of the north and his roomful of noble warriors.|$|E
60|$|As my head outpassed {{the edge}} of the top so that she came into view, I could see she was looking at me with storm-bright eyes. And as <b>I</b> <b>swung</b> around the rigging lightly and joined her, I saw {{approval}} in her eyes that was quickly routed by petulance.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{came down}} from the north to do a little trading and hunting," [...] he said, [...] "and got way off the beaten track. My head man, who was {{the only member of the}} safari who had ever before been in the country, took sick and died. We could find no natives to guide us, and so <b>I</b> simply <b>swung</b> back {{straight}} north. We have been living on the fruits of our guns for over a month. Didn't have an idea there was a white man within a thousand miles of us when we camped last night by a water hole at the edge of the plain. This morning I started out to hunt and saw the smoke from your chimney, so I sent my gun bearer back to camp with the good news and rode straight over here myself. Of course I've heard of you--everybody who comes into Central Africa does--and I'd be mighty glad of permission to rest up and hunt around here for a couple of weeks." ...|$|R
60|$|The New York flung her {{answering}} pennant to the breeze, and, making another {{signal to the}} fleet, which probably meant “Stay where you are until <b>I</b> get back,” <b>swung</b> her bow to the westward and went racing for the game that the Mayflower had sighted. The big cruiser dashed forward, smoke trailing in dense masses from each of her three big funnels, a hill of foam around her bow, and in her wake a swell like a tidal wave. It was a winning pace, and a magnificent sight she presented as she dashed through the choppy seas with never an undulation of her long, graceful hull.|$|R
6000|$|... "Fortunately I {{was on the}} {{leeward side}} of the tower, and <b>I</b> was not <b>swung</b> about by the wind. Steadily I descended, and {{steadily}} {{the diameter of the}} form I grasped diminished; soon I could grasp it in my hand; then with a terrified glance I looked below. I was still at a sickening distance from the ground. I shut my eyes. I slipped down, down, down. The tail became like a thick rope which I encircled with each hand. It became thinner and thinner. It grew so small that I could not hold it; but as I felt it slip from my fingers my feet rested on a pile of stones.|$|R
