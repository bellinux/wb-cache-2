5|$|The Brooksville Tunnel is {{the most}} {{difficult}} work of the kind, I have seen any record of: at the Western entrance, the pressure of the big slides actually causes the bottom to surge up, as is sometime the case in coal mines; in view of the sliding tendency and immense pressure of this ground, it will be advisable to <b>enter</b> <b>on</b> that side with an invested arch to prevent a collapse...This work is vastly more difficult than the Greenwood Tunnel was, though it was not, by any means, an easy safe job.|$|E

In addition to the NBA draft class, the team had a 5-member senior class of Eso Akunne, Josh Bartelstein, Blake McLimans, Corey Person and Matt Vogrich.|$|E
5|$|Although {{tickets for}} the Masters are not expensive, they are very {{difficult}} to come by. Even the practice rounds can be difficult to get into. Applications for practice round tickets have to be made nearly a year in advance and the successful applicants are chosen by random ballot. Tickets to the actual tournament are sold only to members of a patrons list, which is closed. A waiting list for the patrons list was opened in 1972 and closed in 1978. It was reopened in 2000 and subsequently closed once again. In 2008, the Masters also began allowing children (between the ages of 8 and 16) to <b>enter</b> <b>on</b> tournament days free if they are accompanied by the patron who is the owner of his or her badge.|$|E

5|$|The Civil War refocused {{discussions about}} the road. There were fears that Great Britain would <b>enter</b> <b>on</b> {{the side of the}} Confederacy during {{the early days of the}} war. British troops were as close to Michigan as Ontario, and more than half of the copper used in the US came from mines along the {{proposed}} roadway. Control of the area could have been established by seizing the Soo Locks at Sault Ste. Marie, severing communication lines through the Great Lakes. If the locks fell to an enemy force, no troops or supplies could be moved to the Copper Country except by land. The road was also needed during the five or six months of the year that transportation on the Great Lakes was barred by ice or stormy weather.|$|E

25|$|Although {{ubiquitous}} in typeset material, the typographic apostrophe (’) is rather difficult to <b>enter</b> <b>on</b> a computer, since {{it does not}} have its own key on a standard keyboard. Outside the world of professional typesetting and graphic design, many people {{do not know how to}} enter this character and instead use the typewriter apostrophe ('). The typewriter apostrophe has always been considered tolerable on Web pages because of the egalitarian nature of Web publishing, the low resolution of computer monitors in comparison to print, and legacy limitations provided by ASCII.|$|E
25|$|In 2015, {{reconstruction}} and widening of I-45 began in Downtown Houston due to heavy traffic. The SB on-ramp from Allen Parkway {{will be moved}} to <b>enter</b> <b>on</b> the right side, and long-range plans call for the demolition of the outdated Pierce Elevated, with the reroute of I-45 being along Interstate 69/U.S. Highway 59 and Interstate 10 to the North Freeway; The parts of the Gulf Freeway at I-10 and 45 will {{be known as the}} Downtown Connector. If the rerouting of I-45 with the Pierce Elevated demolition (and/or redevelopment into the proposed Pierce SkyPark as part of additional greenspace), the connecting ramps south of Allen Parkway would become a second downtown spur, which will result in the demise of a full freeway loop around Downtown Houston (this will make Dallas, TX the only Texas metropolitan area to retain its downtown freeway loop with Interstates 30, 35E, 345, and Spur 366).|$|E
25|$|Modifications {{were made}} to a stub end tunnel (also known as the Penn Pocket, which was {{originally}} built for short turn World Trade Center to Exchange Place runs to handle PRR commuters from Harborside Terminal) to allow trains from Newark to reach the Hoboken bound tunnel and vice versa. The modifications required PATH to bore through the bedrock dividing the stub tunnel and the tunnels to and from Newark. The new Exchange Place station opened in June 2003. Because of the original alignment of the tracks, trains to/from Hoboken use separate tunnels from the Newark service. From Newark, trains cross over to the Newark/Hoboken bound track just north of Exchange Place. The train then reversed direction and used a crossover switch to go to Hoboken. From Hoboken, trains <b>enter</b> <b>on</b> the Manhattan-bound track at Exchange Place. The train then reversed direction and used the same crossover switch {{to go to the}} Newark-bound tracks before entering Grove Street.|$|E

25|$|One notable {{aspect of}} the {{construction}} at El Tajin {{is the use of}} poured cement in forms. Surviving roof fragments from Building C in the Tajín Chico section is an example of cement roof constructions. Due to the lack of beams or other materials to prop it up, this roof had to be very thick to support itself. To lighten the load and to bind the layers of cement, pumice stones and pottery shards were mixed into the cement. The cement could not be poured all at once but rather in successive layers. It has been suggested that the buildings were filled with earth to support the roof as it was being poured and dried. The finished roofs were nearly a meter thick and almost perfectly flat. While this kind of cement roof is common in modern times, it was unique in the Mesoamerican world. Impressions of baskets, tamale wrappers and other items have been found in the dried cement. The poured cement was used in the only building with two floors at the site, Building B, as a roof and as a separator between the ground and upper floor. The only other known example of two story construction is in the Mayan territories. Another feature shared only with the Mayans is the use of a light blue paint. (wikerson45) Another feature unique to El Tajin is that a number of the residences have windows placed to allow cool breezes to <b>enter</b> <b>on</b> hot days.|$|E

500|$|F-Zero AX {{cabinets}} can dispense {{magnetic stripe}} cards called a [...] "F-Zero license card" [...] {{to keep track}} of custom machine data, pilot points, and race data. A card was bundled with the Japanese release of F-Zero GX. The card expires after fifty uses, but its data can be transferred to a new card. Once inserted, the game builds a machine with three custom parts which can be upgraded by earning pilot points. Pilot points are acquired as the player progresses through the Race and Time Attack modes. Players can increase point earnings by improving finish place, eliminating opponents, and finishing races with a large amount of energy reserved. A magnetic stripe card is needed to enter the F-Zero AX Internet Ranking system. Similarly to GX, players receive a password after completing a Time Attack race to <b>enter</b> <b>on</b> the official F-Zero website's ranking system.|$|E
500|$|From {{downtown}} Saint Paul {{north to}} the junction with I-694 west (exit113) in Little Canada, where US10 also leaves I-35E, the highway carries three lanes of traffic in each direction, {{in addition to a}} single MnPASS HOV lane. Major interchanges here include Cayuga Street (exit108), and MN36 (exit111). An overlap of about one mile (1.5km) exists between the two interchanges with I-694 (exits113 and 114). Heading northbound on I-35E, the four lanes split into three for I-35E northbound and two for I-694 westbound, and then three lanes from I-694 eastbound <b>enter</b> <b>on</b> the right. These six lanes then split into three on the left for I-35E northbound and three on the right for I-694 eastbound; after the turn north, a lane joins on the right from I-694 westbound traffic. The configuration in the other direction, where I-35E southbound and I-694 westbound merge, is similar, but with only five total lanes instead of six where the freeways overlap. A four-year construction project, called [...] "Unweave the Weave" [...] beginning in 2004, was completed in 2008, and eliminated weaving where previously three I-35E lanes were inside three I-694 lanes, and left lane onramps existed.|$|E
