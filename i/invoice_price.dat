60|$|An {{influential}} planter, Senhor João de Salles Caldeira, kindly sent to Mr. John Blandy some {{specimens of}} his nicotiana {{for me to}} test in Africa. The leaf-tobaccos, all grown between 1879 and 1881, at Magdalena in the parish of St. Antonio, were of three kinds. The Havano was far too short for the trade; the Bahiano, also dark, was longer; and the so-called 'North-American' was still longer, light-coloured and well tied in prick-shape. The negro verdict was, 'Left, a lilly he be foine,' meaning they want but little to be excellent. The Gold Coast prefers yellow Virginia, whose <b>invoice</b> <b>price</b> is 7d. per lb. The traders are now introducing Kentucky, which, landed from Yankee ships, costs 6d. But, here as elsewhere, {{it is difficult to}} bring about any such change.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Law, Chief of Patna, being {{examined}} {{on the effect}} of that monopoly, delivered his opinion, that with regard to the Company's trade the monopoly was advantageous, but as sovereigns of the country they must be losers by it. These two capacities in the Company are found in perpetual contradiction. But much doubt may arise whether this monopoly will be found advantageous to the Company either in the one capacity or the other. The gross commodity monopolized for sale in London is procured from the revenues in Bengal; the certain is given for the hazardous. The loss of interest on the advances, sometimes the loss of the principal,--the expense of carriage from Patna to Calcutta,--the various loadings and unloadings, and insurance (which, though borne by the Company, is still insurance),--the engagement for the Ordnance, limited in price, and irregular in payment,--the charge of agency and management, through all its gradations and successions,--when all these are taken into consideration, it may be found that the gain of the Company as traders will be far from compensating their loss as sovereigns. A body like the East India Company can scarcely, in any circumstance, hope to carry on the details of such a business, from its commencement to its conclusion, with any degree of success. In the subjoined estimate of profit and loss, the value of the commodity is stated at its <b>invoice</b> <b>price</b> at Calcutta. But this affords no just estimate of the whole effect of a dealing, where the Company's charge commences in the first rudiments of the manufacture, and not at the purchase at the place of sale and valuation: for they [there?] may be heavy losses on the value at which the saltpetre is estimated, when, shipped off on their account, without any appearance in the account; and the inquiries of your Committee to find the charges on the saltpetre previous to the shipping have been fruitless.|$|E

Any fees or taxes added to the <b>invoice</b> <b>price</b> indicate the additional fees that are being tacked on to the price. If purchasing a product in a large volume, it may be possible for the manufacturer to waive some of these costs for a large enough order. If a car dealer has additional incentives available for the purchase of a vehicle, he generally discounts the vehicle below the <b>invoice</b> <b>price.</b> This should be seen as a sign for the buyer that additional room for negotiation may exist.|$|E

40|$|An {{important}} phenomenon on the Internet {{has been}} the emergence of “infomediaries ” or Internet referral services such as Autobytel. com and Carpoint. com in the automobile industry, Avviva. com in real estate and Healthcareadvocates. com in medicine. These services offer consumers {{the opportunity to get}} price quotes from enrolled brick-and-mortar retailers as also information on <b>invoice</b> <b>prices,</b> reviews and speciÞcations before they commence the shopping process. Internet referral services also direct consumer traffic to particular retailers who join them. The view of industry analysts and practitioners is that these infomediaries are valuable to consumers who can use them to get better prices from retailers. What is less clear though is the manner in which these infomediaries affect the market competition between retailers. In this paper, we analyze the impact of referral infomediaries on the functioning of retail markets and the contractual arrangements that they should use in selling their services. We identify the set of market conditions under which an infomediary can exist and provide an understanding of how they would evolve with the growth of the Internet.

It was at once spread abroad that the object was to drive the wax and ivory trade to São Paulo, and to leave Ambriz open to slavers. The irrepressible Briton transferred himself to Kinsembo, and agreed to pay the king £9 in kind, after [...] "country fashion," [...] for every ship. In 1857 {{the building of the}} new factories was opposed by the Portuguese, and was supported by English naval officers, till the two governments came to an arrangement. In February, 1860, the Kinsembo people seized an English factory, and foully murdered a Congo prince and Portuguese subject, D. Nicoláo de Agua Rosada, employed in the Treasury Department, Ambriz. Thereupon the Governor-General sent up two vessels, with thirty guns and troops; crossed the Loge River, now a casus belli; and, on March 3rd, burned down the inland town of Kinsembo. On the return march the column debouched upon the foreign factories. About one mile in front of the point, Captain Brerit, U.S. Navy, and Commander A. G. Fitzroy, R.N., had drawn up 120 of their men by way of guard. Leave was asked by the Portuguese to refresh their troops, and to house six or seven wounded men. The foreign agents, headed by a disreputable M--M--, now dead, protested, and, after receiving this unsoldierlike refusal, the Portuguese, harassed by the enemy, continued their return march to Ambriz. The natives of this country have an insane hate for their former conquerors, and can hardly explain why: probably the cruelties of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, not peculiar to the Lusitanians, have rankled in the national memory. A stray Portuguese would infallibly be put to death, and it will, I fear, be long before M.

Usher's, for example, in 1914 brewed both a 60/- (60 shilling) Mild and a 60/- Pale Ale. In 1909 Maclay brewed a 54/- Pale Ale and a 54/- Stout.
