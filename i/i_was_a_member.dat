25|$|The mediaeval {{church had}} three altars, with an apse {{in the south}} instead of the normal eastern orientation. This unusual feature has {{triggered}} many discussions among experts, and it is suspected that the church was adapted from a previously secular building. The church was surrounded by shops and a nearby building housed the Stadtguardia, a forerunner of the modern police. The old church burned down in 1661 and was given only makeshift repairs. The decision {{to build a new}} church was taken up {{with the arrival of the}} Fraternity of the Holy Trinity of which the emperor Leopold <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>member.</b> He had taken a vow to rebuild this church when Vienna was ravaged by the plague in 1679-1680.|$|E

When the first check came after I entered the firm, Mr. Thurmond brought to my desk one-third of the amount of the check, explaining what it was for. I said to him that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>member</b> of the Legislature, representing the people of Fannin County, and that my experience had taught me that men who represent the people should be as far removed as possible from concerns whose interests he was liable to be called on to legislate concerning, and that on that ground I would not accept a dollar of the railroad's money, though I was legally entitled to it. I never did take a dollar of it. I have been guided by the principle in all my dealings.|$|E
500|$|Spurs won the 1949–50 Second Division {{title with}} seven games to spare, scoring more goals and conceding fewer {{than any of}} their rivals, and were {{promoted}} to the First Division for the following season. In August 1950, shortly before Tottenham embarked on their first top-flight season since they had been relegated {{at the end of}} the 1934–35 campaign, Rowe told the club's annual meeting: [...] "As much as anything else, I would rate our good time last year to the acquisition of Alf Ramsey." [...] After an uncertain start to the 1950–51 season, Spurs quickly recovered their form of the previous year and by Christmas were top of the table. Ramsey continued to play a key role, according to McKinstry playing [...] "the best football of his life": [...] "He was the master of strategy, the lynchpin of a side that built its attacks from the back, the scheming practitioner who put Rowe's plans into action." [...] His understanding of the game and authority on and off the field led to his teammates nicknaming him [...] "The General". On 28 April 1951, with a 1–0 home victory over Sheffield Wednesday, Tottenham were crowned champions of England only a year after promotion. [...] "I think fortune shone upon me very handsomely during the 1950–51 season," [...] Ramsey remarked in Talking Football—"After all, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>member</b> of one of the finest club teams in years".|$|E

This branch of the Bland family first came to Virginia in 1654, when the father of Richard I, Theodorick Bland of Westover(1629–1671), emigrated from London and Spain, where he had been {{attending}} to the family mercantile and shipping enterprises. Theodorick moved to Virginia to manage the family enterprises there {{as a result of the}} death of his elder brother, Edward Bland in 1653. [...] Theodorick established Berkeley Plantation and Westover Plantation, and both survive still side by side as working plantations on the bank of the James River.

2500|$|The College of William & Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia, {{was home}} to the first known secret collegiate society in the United States, the F.H.C. Society (founded in 1750).

[...] William & Mary alumnus and third American president, Thomas Jefferson, was perhaps the most famous member of the F.H.C. Society. Other notable members of the original society included Col. James Innes, St. George Tucker, and George Wythe. Jefferson noted that, [...] "When I was a student of Wm. & Mary college of this state, there existed a society called the F.H.C. society, confined to the number of six students only, of which <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>member,</b> but it had no useful object, nor do I know whether it now exists." [...] The best opinion is that the society did not survive the British invasion of Virginia {{at the end of the}} American Revolution.
