40|$|This {{report has}} been {{produced}} by Loughborough University Department of Geography for Evidence on Demand {{with the assistance}} of the UK Department for International Development (DFID) contracted through the Climate, Environment, Infrastructure and Livelihoods Professional Evidence and Applied Knowledge Services (CEIL PEAKS) programme, jointly managed by DAI (which incorporates HTSPE Limited) and IMC Worldwide Limited. This paper evaluates the behaviour change aspects likely to affect the uptake of a proposed electric cooking concept, which consists of a simple battery and 500 W <b>electric</b> <b>hob.</b> The battery storage enables households with unreliable electricity supplies to cook at a time that is convenient to them. The specific focus is on the potential uptake of the eCook concept within the Sub-Saharan African (SSA) context, although where appropriate the paper draws upon relevant examples from other parts of the Global South (and beyond) and also makes some commentary upon the potential prospects for electric cooking within these contexts. The paper is organised into two main sections. The first comprises a literature review focusing on a range of related energy transitions, with the aim of drawing out the key lessons learned and highlighting their relevance to the assumptions underlying the proposed eCook concept. The second section draws on the review of experiences presented in the first section to make recommendations for how the eCook concept might be taken forward in ways that make transition more likely. The main findings of this study indicate that the eCook concept offers significant potential for a transition towards emission free cooking, with time/money saving for adopters and broader environmental benefits from reductions in fuelwood collection/purchase of charcoal/wood. The high upfront cost is predicted to be the most significant barrier that will affect household uptake, however recent developments in micro-loans and fee-for-service business models (particularly when combined with mobile phones) have the potential to overcome this. In contrast to other technologies such as solar cookers, where the adaptation of cooking practices has been a substantial barrier, the behaviour change required to use an <b>electric</b> <b>hob</b> is relatively minimal. The paper considers where this transition is likely to take place first, how it can be supported and what further research needs to be conducted...|$|E
30|$|Traditionally, {{household}} appliances use a single energy carrier {{to perform their}} function, usually electricity or gas, which cannot be substituted (Mauser et al. 2015). On the other hand, some devices can be supplied by multiple energy carriers, namely hot water, electricity, and gas, which are used alternatively or in parallel to operate (Mauser et al. 2017). This type of devices {{is referred to as}} hybrid and the potential benefit of their application have recently gained interest in literature (Mauser et al. 2015; Mauser et al. 2016; Stamminger et al. 2008). Although the idea of suppling from different energy carriers may sound far from reality, there are solutions already commercially available. Some dishwashers and washing machine can be connected to a hot water supply, drastically reducing the power demand, as the water is no longer internally heated (Stamminger et al. 2008). Gas clothes dryers heat the air by burning gas, while a hot water tumble dryer is equipped with a water-air heat exchanger (Stamminger et al. 2008). Additionally, dual-fuel cookers are widely used, combining gas hobs and electric ovens; although not yet commercially available, it could be possible to combine electricity and gas in the same cooking device (Mauser et al. 2017). Moreover, water can be boiled in an electric kettle or in a kettle (or a pot) placed on an <b>electric</b> <b>hob,</b> as well as in a kettle placed on a gas hob (Oberascher et al. 2011). The hot water needed for space heating and bathing can be provided by electric heaters as well as gas-burning boilers. An innovative alternative is being developed by Nerdalize (Nerdalize), which uses cloud servers as preheating systems in homes, reducing {{at the same time the}} consumptions of gas for house heating and of electricity for server cooling.|$|E

The cutlery is also a standard airport size so that the knives cannot be used as weapons. Ramsay requires that staff who are working at Plane Food must gain work experience in another one of his restaurants first.|$|R
40|$|By {{comparison}} {{with those in}} industry, domestic cooking processes are rarely studied with respect to heat transfer although they can drastically modify the quality of heated products. In order to compensate for this lack of information in the literature, {{the aim of this}} work was to propose test procedures to evaluate the variability of domestic appliance heating performances in the case of oven-baking and pan-frying. The measurements included the continuous recording of pan temperature during pan-frying using different types of <b>hobs</b> (<b>electric,</b> halogen, gas, induction) and pans; the continuous recording of air temperature and measurement of the convective heat transfer coefficient and equivalent radiative temperature during oven-baking using different types of ovens. The results revealed broad variations in heating conditions {{depending on the type of}} appliance used and on consumer behaviour. For pan-frying, it was shown that pan temperature varied constantly during heating. From an initial value of 200 degrees C and a given product load, it could fall to 150 degrees C or rise to 330 degrees C at medium or high heat, respectively. For oven-baking, heating was sometimes performed at an actual air temperature that differed considerably from the air temperature set on the oven. These measurements also showed relatively low convective heat transfer coefficient values, ranging from 6 W/m(2) K under free convection to 16 W/m(2) K under forced convection...|$|R
40|$|The energy {{efficiency}} (hC), carbon footprint (CF) and operating costs (CC) of home dried pasta cooking were assessed. In particular, hC for the electric hot-plate (46 ± 3 %), induction (33 ± 5 %), or LPG (30 ± 4 %) hob {{was found to}} be definitively smaller than the minimum {{energy efficiency}} performance requirements for EU domestic hobs. Pans of different size, but with the same high thermal diffusivity, had a negligible effect on hC at the probability level of 0. 05. By covering the pan with its lid and setting the power rate of each cooking appliance initially to the maximum level to make the cooking water boil faster, and then to the minimum one to keep almost constant the cooking water temperature and allow starch granule gelatinization, GHG emissions reduced by 81, 73, or 86 % with respect to those released with the LPG, <b>electric,</b> or induction <b>hob</b> adjusted at the maximum power setting, respectively. Such a cooking practice applied to the induction hob allowed CF and CC to be minimized to 0. 67 kg CO 2 e and € 0. 47 per kg of pasta cooked. The resulting energy saving amounted to 31 or 18 % of the energy consumed under the same procedure by the LPG or electric cooker, respectively. Such a cooking system in conjunction with the aforementioned practice might represent an eco-friendly solution to limit the environmental impact of dried pasta consumption.

40|$|International audienceThe Functional Rehabilitation and Reeducation Centre (CRRF) in Noth in the {{department}} of Creuse in France is seeking permanent home automation solutions that help patients to safely have more autonomy in everyday life. An experimental apartment consisting of a bedroom, a bathroom and a kitchen was equipped with communicating devices and remote controls. The aim is to validate the possibility of returning home a patient who have stayed at the medical centre and have motor and cognitive disabilities. A Konnex EIB/KNX bus is used to interface all the sensors and actuators. In the bedroom, an environment controller allows to control objects often inaccessible to the patient because of his disability. Ambient and reading light, shutters, heating, nurse call and television are actuated by conventional switches which have been increased and relayed by the controller. Different functions of the bed can be remotely controlled such as the folding legs, the inclination of the headrest and the height of the bed. A contrast of the switches has been adapted for better visibility. Easily understandable pictograms have been added for an intuitive use. The bedroom door is managed through push up buttons that can be switched with the elbow for a person in a wheelchair. In the bathroom, occupancy sensors have been installed to adjust lighting for better use of toilets facilities. Counting of water associated with flood detection prevents and detects potential overflow of sanitary and bath. In the kitchen, the height of work plans and mobile furniture is adjustable by hand or knee to facilitate access for people with motor disabilities, with safety contacts in case of obstacles. Scenarios have been defined with ergo therapists to prevent the patient against electrical, gas and water dangers in the apartment. These scenarios are managed by a controller that determines the type and degree of danger: the high level (gas, iron, fire risk) and the low level for events that do not require immediate action (oven, <b>electric</b> <b>hob,</b> gas hob, coffee maker and microwave oven). The supervision software used enables the complete management of all alarms and commands transiting through the communication bus via a MODBUS TCP interface. Doctors and therapists will be able to follow the daily activities in the apartment to assess the ability of residents to return home. The system also targets the requirements of housing adjustment aimed at dependent persons returning to their homes...|$|E
40|$|A {{variety of}} {{environmental}} problems increasingly attract academic research {{in order to protect}} ecosystems and minimise negative effects on human health. Advanced computational environmental analysis technologies have the potential to detect, monitor and perhaps effectively control these problems. However, computational environmental analysis is a complex and difficult problem to solve. The problems associated with environmental analysis are the underlying data. These data are collected from sub-optimal positions in urban and rural areas. The limited number of monitoring stations in the network means that we are collecting enough samples over time, however, insufficient data samples are collected across the monitored area. We determined the difficulty associated with computational analysis of environmental data via a critical review of existing approaches in the literature. Our review confirmed the biggest problem was associated with data collection, including noise introduced into the data stream, the big data problem {{in the form of an}} endless data stream, and missing data samples caused by ineffective equipment or poor placement of the monitoring equipment. In this thesis, we document our research into computational environmental methods for addressing land usage and air quality problems. The detection of land use change is a process of identifying differences in the state of a phenomenon by observing time-lapsed landscape imagery. Motivated by a simple neural pattern recognition mechanism, we propose a novel “one-step-more” incremental learning change detection method. In this method, an agent discovers knowledge from the first image using pixel-level incremental learning. When we detect changes in the subsequent image, the discovered knowledge model is updated and ready for the next change detection iteration. This is what we have called the “one-step more” incremental learning method. Powered by incremental data modelling techniques, the system demonstrates the capability of continuously detecting time sequenced imagery. Additionally, the method is shown to be computationally inexpensive when initializing and updating the change detection model. Land encroachment monitoring is essential to assist the economic growth, sustainable resource use and environmental protection of a city. We investigate land encroachment on public parks in the area of Auckland New Zealand, in which the proposed “one-step-more” method employed to analyse 26 Auckland parks. The obtained average region of interest (ROI) detection accuracy is 99. 91 % on five popular park related objects i. e. fences, houses, parks, trees and roads. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated on four categories of encroachment: periimanent land cover & use, and temporary & physical boundary encroachment. We document two detailed and comprehensive investigations of computational methods for air quality analysis. The first investigation is indoor emission source detection and the second is outdoor air quality prediction. Emission source detection indoors is important when locating the possible origin of pollution that could have a negative effect on the health of occupants. Outdoor air quality prediction is essential when attempting to minimise the negative effect on the health of citizens and the ecosystem. Addressing indoor emission source detection, we propose a novel inter-pollutant correlation analysis technique. Unlike other documented solutions that analyze merely primary pollution, our method is further enhanced by calculating intrapollutant correlation coefficients for characterizing and distinguishing emission events. Extensive experiments show that seven major indoor emission sources are identified by the proposed method, including (1) frying canola oil on <b>electric</b> <b>hob,</b> (2) frying olive oil on an <b>electric</b> <b>hob,</b> (3) frying olive oil on a gas hob, (4) spray of household pesticide, (5) lighting a cigarette and allowing it to smoulder, (6) no activities, and (7) using an exhaust or ventilation system. Furthermore, our method improves the detection accuracy by a support vector machine, compared to the classification without data filtering, and with feature extraction of PCA and LDA. Addressing outdoor air quality predication, we propose a novel spatial dataaided incremental support-vector regression (SaIncSVR). We overcome some of the problems associated with other prediction models. Existing models often demand data to be presented in a more convenient form than real data facilitates, for instance complete data, time-series complete, or a specified data capture process making them inadequate when used for environmental prediction. We conduct extensive experiments of PM 2 : 5 prediction over 13 monitoring stations in Auckland, New Zealand. The experimental results indicate that our SaIncSVR performs improved PM 2 : 5 prediction. Our method shows the capability to overcome missing data problems, an improvement over many other documented techniques. We compare our method with a local incremental support-vector regression. Further for PM 2 : 5 spatial prediction, we conduct experiments on outdoor air quality prediction using a data-driven Gaussian geometry model. This model shows promise on a limited number monitoring stations and warrants further investigations. We promote incremental data modelling, given its benefits in processing large amounts of data with parallelization capability in many dimensions, as a constructive solution to spatio-temporal computational environmental analysis. This research documents systematic and comprehensive research in the area of computational environmental analysis. For this study we investigated a variety {{of environmental problems}}, environmental data, change & emission source detection, pollution variation & distribution, and data modeling & prediction. The proposed computational methods could be useful for other environmental detection and prediction problems, especially those using large, asynchronous and spatial-temporal data...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, the European Ecodesign Directive {{has emerged}} as a new {{approach}} to integrate environmental concerns into the product design and related processes. Ecodesign aims to minimize environmental impacts throughout the product life cycle, without compromising performances and costs. In addition, the recent Ecodesign Directives require products which are increasingly eco-friendly and eco-efficient, preserving high-performances. It is very important for producers measuring performances, for <b>electric</b> cooking ranges, <b>hobs,</b> ovens, and grills for household use, and a low power consumption of appliances represents a powerful selling point, also in terms of ecodesign requirements. The Ecodesign Directive provides a clear framework about the sustainable design of products and it has been extended in 2009 to all energy-related products, or products with an impact on energy consumption during the use. The European Regulation establishes measures of ecodesign of ovens, hobs, and kitchen hoods, and domestic use and energy efficiency of a product has a significant environmental aspect in the use phase which is the most impactful in the life cycle. It is important that the product parameters and performances are not affected by ecodesign requirements from a user’s point of view, and the benefits of reducing energy consumption in the use phase should offset the possible environmental impact in the production stage. Accurate measurements of cooking appliance performance are essential to help the industry to produce more energy efficient appliances. The development of ecodriven products requires ecoinnovation and ecodesign tools to support the sustainability improvement. The ecodesign tools should be practical and focused on specific ecoobjectives in order to be largely diffused. The main scope of this paper is the development, implementation, and testing of an innovative tool, which could be an improvement for the sustainable design of induction hobs. In particular, a prototypical software tool is developed in order to simulate the energy performances of the induction hobs. The tool is focused on a multiphysics model which is able to simulate the energy performances and the efficiency of induction hobs starting from the design data. The multiphysics model is composed by an electromagnetic simulation and a thermal simulation. The electromagnetic simulation is able to calculate the eddy current induced in the pot, which leads to the Joule heating of material. The thermal simulation is able to measure the energy consumption during the operational phase. The Joule heating caused from the eddy currents is the output of electromagnetic simulation and the input of thermal ones. The aims of the paper are the development of integrated tools and methodologies of virtual prototyping {{in the context of the}} ecodesign. This tool could be a revolutionary instrument in the field of industrial engineering and it gives consideration to the environmental aspects of product design and focus on the ecodesign of energy-related products, in order to achieve a reduced environmental impact...|$|R
