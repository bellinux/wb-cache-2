40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} interaction between heavy precast cladding units attached to steel framed buildings. Cladding systems are designed as non-structural components and {{are not expected to}} contribute to the energy absorption of the primary structure. However, research has indicated that the cladding system may be designed to reduce the response of the primary structure under seismic excitations. The use of <b>flexible</b> <b>connections</b> between the cladding and primary structural frames may be able to provide beneficial effects to the entire structural response. In this study, a series of earthquake engineering simulations were conducted in OPENSEES to analyze the effects of the <b>flexible</b> <b>connections</b> of the cladding on both a 3 story and 9 story prototype structures. The research focus is on the 3 story structure. The results from 3 story and 9 story structures indicate that the <b>flexible</b> cladding <b>connections</b> have the ability to transfer hysteretic energy from the primary structure to the <b>flexible</b> cladding <b>connections...</b>|$|R

50|$|Prasophyllum {{commonly}} known as leek orchids, is a genus of about one hundred species of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae and is found in Australia and New Zealand. The Australian species are found in all states but have not been recorded in the Northern Territory. The common name arises from their having a hollow, leek- or onion-like leaf. Some species only flower after summer fires and have flowers {{similar to those of}} Xanthorrhoea which flower at the same time, suggesting that they employ the same pollinating insects. Leek orchids are similar to those in the genus Genoplesium except that the free part of the leaf is cylindrical (flat in Genoplesium) and the labellum has a solid (rather than <b>flexible)</b> <b>connection</b> to the column. They range in size from the little laughing leek orchid (P. gracile) at about 15 cm to the king leek orchid (P. regium) which grows up to 2 m tall.|$|E

5000|$|In 1913, American {{inventor}} Hugo Young, of Loudonville, Ohio, {{designed a}} new sidecar {{which was not}} rigidly fixed to the motorcycle. Instead, his invention employed a <b>flexible</b> <b>connection,</b> which allowed the sidecar to turn, raise, and lower without affecting {{the balance of the}} motorcycle. This was a great improvement over the original design, allowing for much safer and more comfortable experiences for both the passenger and driver. Young opened up the Flxible Sidecar Company (the first [...] "e" [...] was dropped to allow for trademarking the name) in Loudonville, Ohio and soon became the largest sidecar manufacturer in the world. When the motorcycle craze began to fade in the 1920s due to more affordable cars being marketed, as well as the banishment of sidecar racing in the United States, the Flxible Sidecar Company began producing transit buses, ambulances, and hearses.Until the 1950s sidecars were quite popular, providing a cheap alternative to passenger cars; they have also been used by armed forces, police and the UK's AA and RAC motoring organisations.|$|E
5000|$|Midrash {{performance}} {{uses the}} whole range of the human capability in art, to convey a meaning that only becomes fully apparent when placed in front of an audience. The performer, must have a highly trained body and voice, and spend many years refining and making the <b>flexible</b> <b>connection</b> between feeling, thought, psychic life and physical action. Thus on stage, they can interpret the midrash in its original language, using different tones of voice and singing, dance and movement and the particular juxtaposition of all these different human elements. It is the interpretation of the language, and the real-time encounter with the audience which gives birth to a particular meaning. Into midrash-bama come elements of colour (Often seen in costume and scenery), elements of rhythm, texture and editing (direction) additions (writing), which have been highly thought out and prepared before. But the actual midrash-bama which takes place in real time, is often very different in each performance, (just as the study of the same text is often very different depending on your state of mind and with whom you are learning.)

5000|$|There is {{evidence}} that numerical cognition is intimately related to other aspects of thought - particularly spatial cognition. One line of evidence comes from studies performed on number-form synaesthetes. Such individuals report that numbers are mentally represented with a particular spatial layout; others experience numbers as perceivable objects that can be visually manipulated to facilitate calculation. Behavioral studies further reinforce the connection between numerical and spatial cognition. For instance, participants respond quicker to larger numbers if they are responding {{on the right side}} of space, and quicker to smaller numbers when on the left—the so-called [...] "Spatial-Numerical Association of Response Codes" [...] or SNARC effect. This effect varies across culture and context, however, and some research has even begun to question whether the SNARC reflects an inherent number-space association, instead invoking strategic problem solving or a more general cognitive mechanism like conceptual metaphor. Moreover, neuroimaging studies reveal that the association between number and space also shows up in brain activity. Regions of the parietal cortex, for instance, show shared activation for both spatial and numerical processing. These various lines of research suggest a strong, but <b>flexible,</b> <b>connection</b> between numerical and spatial cognition.|$|E

40|$|An {{efficient}} stochastic finite element-based {{procedure is}} {{proposed for the}} reliability analysis of frame and truss structures with geometrical and material nonlinearities under static loading condition. The material properties, geometry and external loads of the structure are considered as random variables. The failure criteria of the structure are {{expressed in terms of}} limit-state functions. The method is based on the advanced first order second moment reliability analysis procedure. The assumed stress field approach is used in the finite element formulation to compute nonlinear structural responses and the corresponding response gradients. The proposed method is suitable for the reliability analysis of geometrically nonlinear frame structures with <b>flexible</b> <b>connections.</b> The mechanical properties of the nonlinear <b>flexible</b> <b>connections</b> can be deterministic or random. A random index parameter is introduced as a basic random variable to consider the uncertainties in the modeling of the connections. Structures with different types of connections can be handled by this method.

The proposed method avoids dealing with the complicated failure mechanisms and stable configurations in the structure system reliability analysis, and has several advantages over the other available methods...|$|R

40|$|Discussed {{here is the}} {{suggested}} installation of the 'unbalanced' 8 -cylinder VE-engine. The suggestion was that a flexible mounting be used instead of bolting the engine rigidly to the airplane structure. It was concluded that a <b>flexible</b> <b>connection</b> between the engine and the airplane is probably possible. A <b>flexible</b> <b>connection</b> primarily diminishes the vibrations due to inertia and, to a lesser degree, those due to torque variation. However, engines vibrate more when freely suspended than when rigidly mounted, and this vibration has a detrimental effect on all connections between the engine and the airplane. Therefore, {{in view of the}} relatively insignificant advantages which may be derived from the elastic suspension of the engine, the present rigid mounting is to be preferred. Vibration reduction can be achieved by incorporating in the fuselage as many of the rigid airplane parts as possible...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the dynamic {{behavior}} of tapered composite poles with circular hollow cross-section and <b>flexible</b> <b>connections,</b> which are designed for use in power transmission lines. These poles, made from polyester reinforced with E-glass fibers, are produced using the filament winding technique. Transmission poles are mainly subjected to cantilever bending, since loading due to the wires and wind gusts is applied laterally. In the present work, a simple, but reliable, tapered beam element is developed and the dynamic behavior of the poles is accurately captured using only a few elements. A simple model for <b>flexible</b> <b>connections</b> is established and incorporated in the analysis. The material is orthotropic and its behavior is assumed linearly elastic. Shear effects are accounted for in the analysis because of their significant role due to the low shear modulus. Modal analysis is performed for design purposes to obtain the natural frequency and period of poles with various geometrical characteristics and material lay-up, {{as well as the}} effect of connection flexibility. Experimental results on the dynamic behavior of jointed composite poles are also presented and the effect of damping is estimated. The analytical results presented in this work are based on typical composite poles produced by filament winding, and are compared to commercially available finite element codes.
