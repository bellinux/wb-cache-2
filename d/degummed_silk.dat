Preliminary results, by contact angle measurement, revealed that water absorbed immediately by the plasma-treated raw and <b>degummed</b> <b>silk</b> fabrics. In order {{to study the}} effect of plasma treatment conditions such as oxygen flow rate, exposure time, and jet-to-substrate distance on the water absorption properties of silk fabrics. The silk fabrics were treated under different plasma conditions and their water absorption properties were tested by measuring wettability and wickability.

40|$|Silk {{has always}} {{been one of the most}} favored textile materials. Fully <b>degummed</b> <b>silk</b> fiber (i. e., silk fibers without sericin) shows better luster than raw silk fiber (with sericin); it is also softer.

Recently, partially <b>degummed</b> <b>silk</b> has attracted researchers ’ attention because it provides better luster, feel, and dyeing properties. However, the partial degumming of silk is very difficult because it results in inhomogeneously degummed fiber. In the present study, silk yarns were degummed with surfactant aqueous solutions and the effects of each surfactant on the degumming ratio, crystallinity, and homogeneity of the <b>degummed</b> <b>silk</b> yarn were examined.

Methods In this study, we treated <b>degummed</b> <b>silk</b> with four kinds of calcium-alcohol solutions, and performed secondary structure measurements and enzyme activity test to distinguish the differences between the regenerated fibroins and <b>degummed</b> <b>silk</b> fibroin. Results Gel electrophoresis analysis revealed that Ca(NO 3) 2 -methanol, Ca(NO 3) 2 -ethanol, or CaCl 2 -methanol treatments produced more lower molecular weights of silk fibroin than CaCl 2 -ethanol. X-ray diffraction and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy showed that CaCl 2 -ethanol produced a crystalline structure with more silk I (α-form, type II β-turn), while the other treatments produced more silk II (β-form, anti-parallel β-pleated sheet). Solid-State 13 C cross polarization and magic angle spinning-nuclear magnetic resonance measurements suggested that regenerated fibroins from CaCl 2 -ethanol were nearly identical to <b>degummed</b> <b>silk</b> fibroin, while the other treatments produced fibroins with significantly different chemical shifts. Finally, enzyme activity test indicated that silk fibroins from CaCl 2 -ethanol had higher activity when linked to a known chemotherapeutic drug, L-asparaginase, than the fibroins from other treatments. Conclusions Collectively, these results suggest that the CaCl 2 -ethanol processing method produces silk fibroin with biomaterial properties that are appropriate for drug delivery. </p...|$|E

Silk {{is considered to be}} a promising candidate for tendon engineering because of its biological and mechanical properties. However, a major concern with using silk for biomedical applications is the immune responses generated by sericin, a glue-like protein that coats the silk fibres.

Bombyx mori silks were treated by sequential treatments with different proteases. The efficiency of degumming was determined by measuring weight loss, picric acid and carmine staining and scanning electron microscopy. To evaluate the cellular responses after degumming, the growth and differentiation of human tenocytes on silks were examined.

In the present study, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy with attenuated total reflection (ATR) geometry was used to evaluate the effect of processing conditions on the degumming of silk yarns. The crystallinity index, calculated from FTIR spectra, showed an increase with the degumming ratio. Therefore, the homogeneity of degumming could be evaluated by the variation of crystallinity index for 30 different spots in silk yarns.

Raw <b>silk</b> and <b>degummed</b> raw <b>silk</b> were immersed in four types of degradation solutions for 156 d to observe their degradation properties. The subcutaneous implants in rats were removed after 7, 14, 56, 84, 129, and 145 d for frozen sectioning and subsequent staining with hematoxylin and eosin (H.

The in vitro weight loss ratio of raw <b>silk</b> and <b>degummed</b> raw <b>silk</b> in water, PBS, DMEM and DMEM containing 10 % FBS (F-DMEM) were, respectively, 14 %/ 11 %, 12. 5 %/ 12. 9 %, 11. 1 %/ 14. 3 %, 8. 8 %/ 11. 6 %.

Recent investigations have shown that sericin, a <b>degumming</b> <b>silk</b> protein, can be successfully formed into a 3 -D scaffolds after mixing with other polymers which can be applied in skin tissue engineering. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the effectiveness of ethanol, ethylene oxide (EtO) and gamma irradiation on the sterilization of sericin scaffolds. The influence of these sterilization methods on the physical properties such as pore size, scaffold dimensions, swelling and mechanical properties, as well as the amount of sericin released from sericin/polyvinyl alcohol/glycerin scaffolds, were also investigated. Ethanol treatment was ineffective for sericin scaffold sterilization whereas gamma irradiation was the most effective technique for scaffold sterilization. Moreover, ethanol also caused significant changes in pore size resulting from shrinkage of the scaffold. Gamma-irradiated samples exhibited the highest swelling property, but they also lost the greatest amount of weight after immersion for 24  h compared with scaffolds obtained from other sterilization methods. The results of the maximum stress test and Young’s modulus showed that gamma-irradiated and ethanol-treated scaffolds are more flexible than the EtO-treated and untreated scaffolds. The amount of sericin released, which was related to its collagen promoting effect, was highest from the gamma-irradiated scaffold.

The ATR-IR spectra of the <b>degummed</b> <b>silks</b> samples using the same method [68] but different pH, temperature and time conditions DS 1 (pH  10, at constant boiling temperature for 1  h.) and DS 2 (pH  8.5, at constant 85  °C for 2  h.), display the same profile except for the intensity variation of the bands at 1617, 1440 and 1403  cm− 1. Relative to the spectrum of CS, {{the intensity of the}} first band decreases in the sample DS 1 and displays the same relative intensity in sample DS 2. In both degummed samples the band at 1063  cm− 1 reduces drastically its intensity when compared with the spectrum of CS. The spectral variation of the sericin bands [69] at 1403 and 1063  cm− 1 is consistent with the degumming process used. Raman spectral modifications between the CS and degummed samples were also observed. In general, no protein conformational changes can be inferred from Raman spectral variations observed for amide I (1650 – 1670  cm− 1) and amide III (1230 – 1280  cm− 1) vibrations, and skeletal modes in the 900 – 960  cm− 1 spectral region [70].

CS and SF solutions were prepared in a mixed solvent system of TFA/DCM (weight ratio = 7 : 3) at concentrations of 8 and 12.5 wt.%, respectively. CS/SF blend solutions with different SF/CS weight ratio (75 : 25, 50 : 50, and 25 : 75) were prepared in the same solvent system at 12, 10, and 9 wt.% (combined weight of CS and SF), respectively.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The {{present study}} aims at the {{preparation}} of silk fibroin solution for possible applications in tissue engineering. Pure silk fibroin protein was extracted from Bombyx mori silk cocoon by degumming method using aqueous Na 2 CO 3 solution followed by solubilizing in LiBr aqueous solution. The fibroin protein solution was purified and studied for the protein content. The degumming & solubility were significantly dependent on the salt concentration, treatment temperature, and time. A salt concentration of 0. 02 M Na 2 CO 3, temperature of 80 °C and time more than 40 min {{were found to be}} favorable degumming conditions. The proper conditions of dissolution were found as 9. 3 M LiBr, 70 °C temperature, and 3 h dissolving time. The morphology of <b>degummed</b> <b>silk</b> were investigated by SEM at different magnification. SEM revealed the absence of glue like sericine over the silk fibroin surface at optimal degumming condition. The fibroin protein content of the solution was measured by Bradford protein assay. The results indicate that the regenerated silk fibroin (RSF) can be used for fabrication of porous silk fibroin scaffolds for various tissue engineering applications...|$|E
40|$|Changes in {{molecular}} weight and secondary structure of eri silk during alkali degumming and silk powdering were studied. An increase in silk degumming intensity, through increased alkali concentration, treatment temperature, and time, reduced the fibroin {{molecular weight}} and, therefore, the fiber tenacity, {{but at the}} same time, increased the Beta-sheet fraction. These changes reduced the time required to mill the <b>degummed</b> <b>silk</b> fibers into fine powders. Mechanical forces used in wet attritor and air jet milling disturbed intermolecular packing along the direction of side chains, but the conformation remained essentially Beta-sheet even in the sub-micron silk particles. Dry milling drastically reduced molecular weight and changed the conformation of the fibroin chains. The rate of the spontaneous conformation transition in regenerated fibroin solution prepared from fibers and powders increased with a decrease in fibroin molecular weight, affecting the time fibroin solutions could be stored before gelling. Overall, the study showed that molecular weight and secondary structure of silk powders could be manipulated by suitably changing the degumming and milling conditions. It also suggests that wet media milling and air jet milling are better than dry media milling to prepare less degraded and more crystalline ultrafine silk particles...|$|E
40|$|Industrial {{biotechnology}} has {{the potential}} to fulfil many key criteria of greener textile production. This review outlines the current research and future directions of the emerging applications of enzymatic technology in the sustainable production and processing of textiles. The state-of-the-art industrial enzymes in textile processing include amylases for desizing of cotton and cellulases for denim-washing and biopolishing. Aside from these established processes, emerging enzymatic processes such as cotton scouring and bleaching, bast fiber retting/degumming, wool scouring and shrink-proofing, <b>silk</b> <b>degumming,</b> bio-dye production and enzyme-assisted dyeing and finishing are at various stages of development. To illustrate the state-of-the-art, representative examples of enzymes in the processing of various types of textile substrates are discussed and evaluated in this article. The major limitations of the large scale implications of textile biotechnology are lack of sufficient research efforts to make it an economically viable option and issues related to technological glitches. The limitations of existing approaches will be highlighted and the requirements of continuous improvement to overcome current obstacles will be demonstrated by critical assessment...|$|R
40|$|Silks are {{frequently}} {{a cause of}} concern for conservatorsand curators. Amongst other critical challenges, textileacidity is considered to pose a risk. Consequently, it iscommon practice to carry out pH measurements whenassessing condition. Enhanced acidity is usually ascribedto previous processing treatments, adsorbed pollutants,and oxidative deterioration. However, the results of thedetailed study reported in this paper suggest thatincreased acidity of silk is an expected consequence ofageing, irrespective of the effector of deterioration. <b>Degummed</b> Bombyx mori <b>silk</b> fabric was subjected to artificialageing by light, heat and heat plus high humidity, in air. The tensile strength of the fabric gradually decreasedunder each of the ageing regimes, seeming to follow firstorder decay. The pH values of saline extracts of the silkssimilarly decreased. There was a correlation between thetensile strength and the apparent acidity of the aged silks,which was independent of the ageing factor, at least to a 50 % drop in performance. While the tensile strength of silkwas compromised to a similar degree by high temperatureplus high humidity ageing in nitrogen, anoxic conditionsgenerated a five-fold lower increase in apparent acidity...|$|R
40|$|Degumming is {{the first}} process for the {{preparation}} of all silk-based products. In this paper, effect of sodium carbonate concentrations for <b>silk</b> <b>degumming</b> on the formation of electrospun silk fibroin nanofibers was investigated {{and the reason for}} the silk electrospinning process was explained for the first time by differences from the microstructure of regenerated silk fibroin. With increasing the sodium carbonate concentration, microstructure both in the aqueous solutions and in the electrospinning solutions transformed from nanofibrils to nanoparticles, leading to obvious changes on rheological property; electrospinning solutions with nanofibrils behaved like the native silk dope and owned remarkably higher viscosity than the solutions with nanoparticles showing very low viscosity. More interestingly, nanofibrils favored the formation of silk nanofibers with ease, and even nanofibers could be electrospun at concentration 2 %. However, nanoparticles were completely unable to generate nanofibers at high spinning concentration 8 %. Importance of sodium carbonate concentrations is heavily emphasized for impacting the microstructure types and further influencing the electrospinning performance of regenerated silk. Hence, sodium carbonate concentrations provide a controllable choice for the preparation of silk-based electrospun biomaterials with desired properties...|$|R
