500|$|The {{metallic}} {{state has}} historically been an important building block for studying properties of solids. The first theoretical description of metals was given by Paul Drude in 1900 with the Drude model, which explained electrical and thermal properties by describing a metal as an ideal gas of then-newly discovered electrons. [...] He was able to derive the empirical Wiedemann-Franz law and get results <b>in</b> <b>close</b> <b>agreement</b> <b>with</b> the experiments. [...] This classical model was then improved by Arnold Sommerfeld who incorporated the Fermi–Dirac statistics of electrons {{and was able to}} explain the anomalous behavior of the specific heat of metals in the Wiedemann–Franz law. [...] In 1912, The structure of crystalline solids was studied by Max von Laue and Paul Knipping, when they observed the X-ray diffraction pattern of crystals, and concluded that crystals get their structure from periodic lattices of atoms. [...] In 1928, Swiss physicist Felix Bloch provided a wave function solution to the Schrödinger equation with a periodic potential, called the Bloch wave.|$|E

One is the famous Prokofjew potential for sodium used and recommended by many workers. The other potential is constructed considering the most important interactions on a basis of one constructed by V. Heine for Aluminium. Calculations are made using O. P.
