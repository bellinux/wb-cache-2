25|$|Arsenic {{is used as}} a feed {{additive}} in poultry and swine production, in particular in the U.S. to increase weight gain, improve <b>feed</b> <b>efficiency,</b> and to prevent disease. An example is roxarsone, which had been used as a broiler starter by about 70% of U.S. broiler growers. The Poison-Free Poultry Act of 2009 proposed to ban the use of roxarsone in industrial swine and poultry production. Alpharma, a subsidiary of Pfizer Inc., which produces roxarsone, voluntarily suspended sales of the drug in response to studies showing elevated levels of inorganic arsenic, a carcinogen, in treated chickens. A successor to Alpharma, Zoetis, continues to sell nitarsone, primarily for use in turkeys.|$|E

40|$|North {{temperate}} fish in post-glacial lakes are textbook examples {{for rapid}} parallel adaptive radiation into multiple trophic specialists within individual lakes. Speciation repeatedly proceeded along the benthic – limnetic habitat axis, and benthic – limnetic sister species diverge {{in the number}} of gill rakers. Yet, the utility of different numbers of gill rakers for consuming benthic vs. limnetic food has only very rarely been experimentally demonstrated. We bred and raised families of a benthic – limnetic species pair of whitefish under common garden conditions to test whether these species (i) show heritable differentiation in <b>feeding</b> <b>efficiency</b> on zooplankton, and (ii) whether varia- tion in <b>feeding</b> <b>efficiency</b> is predicted by variation in gill raker numbers. We used zooplankton of three different size classes to investigate prey size dependency of divergence in <b>feeding</b> <b>efficiency</b> and to investigate the effect strength of variation {{in the number of}} gill rakers. Our results show strong interspecific differences in <b>feeding</b> <b>efficiency.</b> These differences are largest when fish were tested with the smallest zooplankton. Importantly, <b>feeding</b> <b>efficiency</b> is significantly positively correlated with the number of gill rakers when using small zooplankton, also when species identity is statistically controlled for. Our results support the hypothesis that a larger number of gill rakers are of adaptive significance for feeding on zooplankton and pro- vide one of the first experimental demonstrations of trait utility of gill raker number when fish feed on zooplankton. These results are consistent with the suggested importance of divergent selection driven feeding adaptation during adaptive radiation of fish in post-glacial lakes...|$|R
40|$|Populations of the {{introduced}} book trout, Salvelinus fontinalis, {{have recently}} become more widespread and abundant in western North American streams, possible {{at the expense}} of native Colorado River cutthroat trout, Oncorhynchus clarki pleuriticus. We examined the intensity and potential mechanism of competition between these species. Feeding experiments in laboratory stream channels showed that cutthroat trout <b>feeding</b> <b>efficiency</b> decreases {{in the presence of a}} brook trout. Decreased <b>feeding</b> <b>efficiency</b> appeared to be due to interference, as cutthroat trout were inactive in the presence of the brook trout. Evidence for interference competition in the feeding experiments was also given by the fact that brook trout <b>feeding</b> <b>efficiency</b> was lower than the <b>feeding</b> <b>efficiency</b> of cutthroat trout. The decreased <b>feeding</b> <b>efficiency</b> of cutthroat trout in the presence of brook trout was due to decreased attack rates by cutthroat trout, and was not due to attacks and consumption of the food items by the brook trout. A field enclosure experiment, in which riffle-pool sections of a stream were isolated by fencing, was performed to determine if the presence of brook trout had a negative effect on the growth, fat content, and diet of cutthroat trout. Cutthroat trout fat levels were significantly lower in the presence of brook trout. The growth of cutthroat trout was not significantly different in the presence and absence of brook trout, but there was a trend fro lower growth of cutthroat trout in the presence of brook trout. Diet choices and total biomass of prey consumed by cutthroat trout in the field experiment and in a survey of three streams were not affected by the presence of brook trout. The observed decreased <b>feeding</b> <b>efficiency</b> of cutthroat trout in the presence of brook trout may be the mechanism responsible for the significant;y decreased fat levels during the relatively short, summer growing season and may result in reduced population sizes due to high overwinter mortality and delayed sexual maturity...|$|R

A total of 36 heifers were used, 18 from each breed, randomly distributed in a completely randomized design, in a 2 x 3 factorial scheme. The treatments used were 20 and 40 % restriction compared to intake by animals from the third group, which were fed ad libitum (without restriction). For the behavioral analysis, the scan sampling method was used by logging and recording times in five-minute intervals during 24 hours, thus estimating the time spent feeding, ruminating and idling.

40|$|Triatoma brasiliensis is an {{important}} vector of Trypanosoma cruzi in Brazil. The <b>feeding</b> <b>efficiency</b> on its hosts depends on several parameters including {{the maintenance of the}} ingested blood at low viscosity, which could be modulated by the anterior midgut (crop) anticoagulant and haemagglutinant activities. In the present study, we characterized T. brasiliensis crop haemagglutination activity and evaluated its importance in the feeding process. Soluble crop contents (SCC) of T. brasiliensis were able to agglutinate rat, mouse and rabbit eryhtrocytes, but had no activity on cattle and Thrichomys apereoides, a rodent species commonly associated with T. brasiliensis in the wild. The haemagglutination was characterized by the immediate formation of several clusters of erythrocytes connected by flexible elastic-like fibers. The <b>feeding</b> <b>efficiency</b> of T. brasiliensis on rat (agglutinated by SCC) was almost double that from T. apereoides (not agglutinated by SCC). The influence of haemagglutination on feeding was confirmed by artificially feeding bugs on a diet composed of cattle or rat erythrocytes. The bugs fed on cattle erythrocytes had lower ingestion rates in comparison to those fed on rats. The results indicate that, in addition to other parameters, haemagglutination brought about by SCC has {{an important}} role in the <b>feeding</b> <b>efficiency</b> of T. brasiliensis.

40|$|Sabella spallanzanii, {{a filter}} feeding, sabellid polychaete worm which {{is common in}} the Mediterranean Sea, was {{recently}} discovered in Cockburn Sound, Western Australia. The species has been in Port Phillip Bay, Victoria for about 10 years, where it has spread widely, competes with native species and has economic impacts on the local scallop fishery. In Cockburn Sound, S. spallanzanii has colonised a shallow, sandy area known as the Southern Flats, reaching a mean biomass of 258 gDW m 2, as well as almost all artificial structures such as jetties and navigational marker pylons. A large biomass of this introduced filter feeder may have a considerable filtration capacity which could control levels of phytoplankton in the Sound. This study measured the biomass and filtration rate of S. spallanzanii to determine its potential to effect phytoplankton levels in Cockburn Sound through filter feeding. The results suggest that these polychaetes have a substantial filtering capacity, capable of filtering the water-column above them at the Southern Flats (5 m depth) 4. 6 times daily. To determine the <b>feeding</b> <b>efficiency</b> of S. spallanzanii (volume of water filtered per metabolic demand), the oxygen consumption and filtration rate were measured. <b>Feeding</b> <b>efficiency,</b> which may provide {{an indication of the}} potential spread of S. spallanzanii to less eutrophic waters, increased with temperature from 13 °C, reaching an optimum at 22 °C. Between 22 - 27 °C the <b>feeding</b> <b>efficiency</b> decreased sharply, indicating that its upper temperature limit is approached. To meet its metabolic requirements, S. spallanzanii requires a phytoplankton concentration with a chlorophyll a level of 1. 42 µg L 1 in winter (17 °C) and 0. 73 µg L 1 in summer (22 °C). It was concluded that the <b>feeding</b> <b>efficiency</b> of S. spallanzanii may limit it to eutrophic harbours {{with a high level of}} phytoplankton...|$|R

We investigated the existence of consistent individual differences {{in the level of}} neophobia in captive roe deer, Capreolus capreolus, using an experimental set-up. Our main objective was to explore the link between an individual's level of neophobia with behavioural and physiological responses measured during a stressful situation, i. e. capture and restraint, to facilitate characterization of neophobia in the wild. We found that the probability of initiating a feeding bout and the <b>feeding</b> <b>efficiency</b> over bouts both decreased {{in the presence of a}} novel object. However, there was pronounced variation in the degree to which individuals were affected by the experimental treatment. First, <b>feeding</b> <b>efficiency</b> decreased the most among individuals that reacted less markedly to an acutely stressful situation (capture). Second, latency between the first visit and the first feeding bout increased the most among individuals that had a higher concentration of fructosamine in their blood, an indicator of chronic stress. Our results indicate that individuals that are more neophobic (high latency to first feeding bout and low <b>feeding</b> <b>efficiency</b> in the presence of a novel object) are also less proactive (low behavioural response to capture, high levels of fructosamine), suggesting the existence of a behavioural syndrome.
