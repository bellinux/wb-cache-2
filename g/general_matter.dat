25|$|For {{the first}} law of thermodynamics, {{there is no}} trivial passage of {{physical}} conception from the closed system view to an open system view. For closed systems, the concepts of an adiabatic enclosure and of an adiabatic wall are fundamental. Matter and internal energy cannot permeate or penetrate such a wall. For an open system, there is a wall that allows penetration by matter. In <b>general,</b> <b>matter</b> in diffusive motion carries with it some internal energy, and some microscopic potential energy changes accompany the motion. An open system is not adiabatically enclosed.|$|E

2500|$|As {{an initial}} matter, Kennedy {{identified}} four principles that undergird the Eighth Amendment's proportionality principle as he understood it. First, [...] "the fixing of prison terms for specific crimes involves a substantive penological judgment that, as a <b>general</b> <b>matter,</b> is properly within {{the province of}} legislatures, not courts." [...] Second, the Eighth Amendment does not mandate the adoption of one theory of punishment over anotherstates are free to tailor their punishments {{to meet the needs}} of either a deterrence rationale, a retribution rationale, or both or some other rationale. Third, in light of these first two principles, there is bound to be some variation of punishments between and within particular jurisdictions. Thus, the intra- and interjurisdictional comparison required by the Solem test would frequently prove unworkable. Fourth, any proportionality analysis required by the Eighth Amendment should be informed by objective factors to the maximum possible extent.|$|E
2500|$|The court's ruling {{generated}} two dissents.

[...] He {{went on to say that}} Rehnquist used a flawed interpretation of the Estelle and Youngberg precedents, which Brennan held [...] "to stand for the much more generous proposition that, if a State cuts off private sources of aid and then refuses aid itself, it cannot wash its hands of the harm that results from its inaction." [...] Finally, Brennan argued that the Wisconsin child-protection laws created a regime in which private citizens and government bodies other than a Department of Social Services had no power or role to intervene with child abuse other than notifying the DSS. [...] As such, Brennan held that the child-protection laws constituted the same custodial [...] "deprivation of liberty" [...] that Rehnquist's opinion held necessary for a Due Process violation.|$|E

Mine is, incomparably, for brooding like the Hen, whom I differ from but by a syllable in designation; and see how little I personally lose by it, since your putting on girdles so quite inevitably involves your passing at a given moment where I can reach forth and grab you a little. Don't despise me for a spiritless worm, only livrez-vous-y yourself ... with all pride and power, and unroll the rich record later to your so inevitably deprived (though so basely resigned) and always so faithfully fond old ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Speedy {{has arrived}} in camp. He is {{to act as}} {{political}} adviser to General Napier, and his arrival is a <b>general</b> <b>matter</b> of satisfaction. Mr. Speedy was at one time {{an officer in the}} 81st Foot; he afterwards exchanged into the 10th Punjaubees, of which regiment he was some time adjutant. He afterwards left the service and wandered out to Abyssinia, where he entered the service of Theodore, and assisted him to organise and drill his army. Finding he was likely to share the fate of other British in this potentate’s employ, and to be cast into prison, Mr. Speedy threw up his appointment, and has since been living in Australia. General Napier, having heard of him, wrote to beg him to come; and Mr. Speedy received the letter just in time to come off by the mail, with a kit, according to popular report, consisting only of two blankets. He is not, I am happy to say, an Abyssinian worshipper. Dr. Krapf, Colonel Merewether’s adviser, is so. He seems to think that the black is a very much finer specimen of humanity than the white man; and that deeds which would be punished in the latter are highly excusable, if not laudable, when perpetrated by the former. Dr. Krapf is not singular in his ideas. Had his lines lain in England, I have no doubt that he would have been one of Governor Eyre’s foremost persecutors. I am very glad that a healthier tone is likely to be introduced in our dealings with the natives. Mr. Speedy rode out yesterday, at the General’s request, to some of the villages round, called upon the priests, and offered a present of money for the relief of the poor and distressed. The answer in each case was the same. The priests said that {{had it not been for}} our coming, a period of severe distress and suffering would probably have occurred. The crops had been devastated by the locusts, and the present drought would seriously affect the next harvest. Thanks, however, to the money which the English had distributed through the country in payment for cattle purchased by the commissariat, and for hay, wood, milk, &c., and for the hire of transport, the people were better off than usual; and therefore, with the exception of three or four dollars for the aged and infirm, they would decline with thanks General Napier’s gift.|$|E

I feel {{in the presence of}} your letter last night received that the little machine thrust under one's tongue may well now register or introduce the babble of a mind [...] "affected"; though interestingly so, let me add, since it is indeed a thrill to think that I am perhaps the last living depositary of Maupassant's wonderful confidence or legend. I really believe myself the last survivor of those then surrounding Gustave Flaubert. I shrink a good deal at the same time, I confess, under the burden of an honour [...] "unto which I was not born"; or, more exactly, hadn't been properly brought up or pre-admonished and pre-inspired to.

You will see in a moment everything that was wanting to make me the conscious recipient of a priceless treasure. You will see in fact how little I could have any of the right mental preparation. I didn't in the least know that M. himself was going to be so remarkable; I didn't in the least know that I was going to be; I didn't in the least know (and this was above all most frivolous of me) that you were going to be; I didn't even know that the monkey was going to be, or even realise the peculiar degree and nuance of the preserved lustre awaiting ces messieurs, the three taken together.

[...] "Here they are at it!"
