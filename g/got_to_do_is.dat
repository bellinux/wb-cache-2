[...] Lee responded with an unscripted speech made entirely in Malay opposing the government's pro-Malay policies: [...] "Of course there are Chinese millionaires in big cars and big houses. Is it the answer to make a few Malay millionaires with big cars and big houses? ... If we delude people into believing that they are poor because there are no Malay rights or because opposition members oppose Malay rights, where are we going to end up? You let people in the villages believe that they are poor because we don't speak Malay, because the government does not write in Malay, so he expects a miracle to take place [...] The moment we all start speaking Malay, he is going to have an uplift in the standard of living, and if doesn't happen, what happens then? Meanwhile, whenever there is a failure of economic, social and educational policies, you come back and say, oh, these wicked Chinese, Indian and others opposing Malay rights. They don't oppose Malay rights. They, the Malay, have the right as Malaysian citizens to go up to the level of training and education that the more competitive societies, the non-Malay society, has produced. That is what must be done, isn't it? Not to feed them with this obscurantist doctrine that all they have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> to get Malay rights for the few special Malays and their problem has been resolved." ...|$|E

He was named the Most Valuable Player {{of the game in}} 1945. It was at the Chicago College All-Star Game that Bidwell decided he would draft Trippi first overall, as [...] "Card-Pitt" [...] was winless in 1944 and in need of a play-maker. [...] "He said, 'I'm gonna get ya,'" [...] Trippi recalled. [...] "He wanted me to play for him, and I said, 'All you've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> draft me and I'm ready.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Lee also criticised the government's {{policies}} {{by stating}} that [...] "hey, the Malay, have the right as Malaysian citizens {{to go up to}} the level of training and education that the more competitive societies, the non-Malay society, has produced.

2500|$|Facing the {{possibility}} of defeat in the 2012 Presidential election the Obama Administration accelerated work {{in the weeks before}} the election to develop explicit rules for the targeted killing of terrorists by unmanned drones, so that a new president would inherit clear standards and procedures. The work to codify U.S. drone policy began in summer 2011. [...] "There was concern that the levers might no longer be in our hands," [...] said one unnamed U.S official. With a continuing debate about the proper limits of drone strikes, Obama did not want to leave an [...] "amorphous" [...] program to his successor, the official said. The effort, which would have been rushed to completion by January had Mitt Romney won, will now be finished at a more leisurely pace, the official said. [...] "One of the things we've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> put a legal architecture in place, and we need Congressional help in order to do that, to make sure that not only am I reined in but any president's reined in terms of some of the decisions that we're making," [...] Obama said and added [...] "creating a legal structure, processes, with oversight checks on how we use unmanned weapons, {{is going to be a}} challenge for me and my successors for some time to come." [...] U.S. President Obama also expressed wariness of the powerful temptation drones pose to policy makers. [...] "There's a remoteness to it that makes it tempting to think that somehow we can, without any mess on our hands, solve vexing security problems," [...] he said.|$|E

60|$|The {{manager and}} George said he 'ad got on wonderfully, and arter talking {{it over with}} Mrs. Alfredi they decided to open that evening, and pore Rupert {{found out that the}} shop was the theatre, and all the acting he'd <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> dance war-dances and sing in Zulu to people wot had paid a penny a 'ead.
