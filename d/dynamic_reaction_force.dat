Instrumentation was developed to collect the dynamic force and moment data. New data collections methodologies and analysis techniques were implemented to facilitate computer-aided-engineering for wheelchair designs. Data were collected during standardized wheelchair fatigue tests, while driving over a simulated road course within a laboratory, and while driving in the community. Seventeen subjects participated in this study. Based upon the three test conditions, a pseudo-statistical distribution of the force and moment data at both a caster and rear wheel was developed. The key parameters describing the distribution and the extremums of the data (minima and maxima) were compared using analysis of variance. The results showed that the force and moment distributions and extreme values were similar for the both sets of human trials (i. e., simulated road course and field trials). However, the standardized testing (i. e., wheelchair fatigue testing) differed from both human trials. The force/moment data gathered during this study are suitable for inputs in finite element analysis and dynamic modeling. Our results suggest that the fatigue tests should be modified to change the magnitude and increase the frequency of the forces and moments imparted on the wheelchair. The data reported from this study can be used to improve wheelchair standards and to facilitate computer-aided-engineer in wheelchair design...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a research study carried out to investigate the performance of the pentice structure at an underground mine in NSW during the extension and equipping of a haulage shaft by Macmahon under high-speed impact loading caused by the potential projectiles falling from the surface. This assessment will allow the structure to comply with AS 3785. 5 for “Headframes” (Australian Standard, 1998). The pentice structure is installed 1000 m below the surface in a 4. 268 m diameter shaft at the considered underground mine. The objective of the pentice is to allow Macmahon construction and shaft sinking crews to work in the shaft without any risk to their safety. The pentice structure includes a number of steel boxes 1 -m high that are filled with high yielding foaming grout Tekseal from Minova Australia Pty Ltd. The major aim of this investigation is to evaluate the capacity of the existing pentice to resist high-velocity impacts and to develop a high-performance protective system which is capable of absorbing energy and terminating large projectiles falling from a height of 1000 m. High-fidelity physics based finite element models for the mine pentice were developed to find a satisfactory solution to protect workers 1000 m below the surface from potential falling projectiles. It is established that the existing level 11 pentice structure is not capable of stopping the projectiles dropping from a height of 1000 m. Several high-performance protective solutions for strengthening the pentice against impact loads were proposed and evaluated numerically. As the final design, two-level protection is designed that includes the 9 level and 11 level pentice protective structures. The models of the 9 level pentice and the 11 level pentice are evaluated for the relevant impact loads. It is found that the new 9 level pentice requires an additional layer of the railway concrete sleepers along with the high-strength steel cover plate to provide adequate protection and terminate the falling projectiles. The supporting frames for the 9 level and 11 level pentice structures are designed using the <b>dynamic</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>forces</b> transferred from the pentice boxes.

40|$|Robotic {{systems are}} playing a more and more {{important}} role in space applications such as construction, assistance and maintenance of on-orbit space structures. Space free-flying robots (SFFRs) are robotic systems made of a platform (which has its own actuators such as thrusters, reaction wheels, etc.) equipped {{with one or more}} deployable manipulators. Unlike industrial robots which have their base fixed to the ground, the base of a SFFR is affected by the <b>dynamic</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>forces</b> due to the motion of both the manipulators and the captured target bodies. In order to effectively control a SFFR it is of fundamental importance to model this behavior. The present paper will focus on the issue of maintaining a stable contact between the manipulator's end point (i. e. the end-effector) and a target object after the first contact. Impedance control is a suitable strategy to solve this problem. In this approach the end-effector is controlled {{in order to make it}} behave like a mass-spring-damper system regardless of the reaction motion of the base so to absorb the impact energy. It is worth noting that the task to maintain the contact between the end-effector and the target will be carried out without a real grasp in order to reduce the complexity of the mechanical-structural design of the system. The usual approach consists in considering a point mass target and one-dimensional contact dynamics; however, the contact between the chaser and the target could generate a perturbation on the attitude of the target. On account of this, in the present work a rigid body target and a two-dimensional contact dynamics will be considered. Furthermore, different configurations of the SFFR (one manipulator vs. two manipulators) and their effectiveness will be analyzed. The performance of the proposed control architecture will be evaluated by means of a co-simulation involving the MSC Adams multi-body code (for describing the dynamics of the space robot and target) together with SIMULINK (for the determination of the control actions). The co-simulation is a particularly useful tool to implement robust control applied on detailed dynamic systems. Of course, since the mechanical parameters used to model the contact phase between two bodies are not always known a priori, the controller must be robust enough to overcome this problem.

The purpose of the study is to develop and use modal testing and vibration analysis which would involve obtaining the mathematical model of the system from the test data and subsequently obtaining the unbalanced parameters. The research work includes the application of modal testing method in rotor rig to investigate different modal parameters and detect the behaviour and performance of rotating machinery. This method would be capable of solving many of the related rotating machine problems, such as in turbine and compressor. Unbalance is one of the problems which exist in rotating machinery. Balancing is usually an expensive and laborious procedure and a balancing system would be beneficial for rotor dynamic systems and power generation applications. Excess vibration can cause noise, cyclic stress and wear in machinery. It is important to identify all the critical speeds within the range of operation and analyse the damping effect, mass unbalance and other phenomena in rotating machinery and their effects in their safe operation. These will be investigated in this study. There are several phenomena associated with rotating machinery such as centrifugal and gyroscopic forces which would create complexity in the mathematical procedures in modal analysis {{that they need to be}} addressed and interpreted appropriately before they could be used in modal testing of rotating machinery. The experimental technique used in this thesis to obtain the modal and dynamic response properties of structures. This technique has been applied to rotating structures, however the full implementation of modal testing in rotating structures and the implications are not fully understood. and are therefore in need of further investigations. In this study the Frequency Response Function (FRF) data obtained from the specific experimental results are curve-fitted by theoretical data regenerated from overall statistical analysis of measured data. Different excitation methods are used in experiment (hammer and shaker). For hammer test, transient signal is produced. While for shaker test, different vibration signals are produced (Sine, Random and Burst Random). In shaker test, a special frame was designed and used around a plain bearing and the accelerometers were attached to the outer surface of the bearing to measure the response of the lateral motion on several points of the shaft. The excitation force with help of push' rod was generated and applied to the shaft. This method can help to solve the problem in the attachment of shaker and force transducers to the rotor system. The analysis of vibration suppression with different locations and configurations of the unbalanced masses and effect of the adding of balance masses to suppress the vibration amplitude has been studied properly. The experimental results were used for verification of Finite Element (FE) models, since it has good capability for eigen analysis and also good graphical facility. 3 -D models result in large number of nodes and elements. This project demonstrates how to extract a plane 2 -D model from the 3 -D model that can be used with fewer nodes and elements with no loss in accuracy of the results.

This is not, however, the case in deformable body analyses wherein the generalized <b>reaction</b> <b>forces</b> depend on the system generalized reference and elastic coordinates. In this paper, a method for determining the actual <b>reaction</b> <b>forces</b> at the joints from the generalized <b>reaction</b> <b>forces</b> in deformable multibody systems is presented...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study was to propose a {{viscoelastic}} model which can generate two dimensional ground <b>reaction</b> <b>forces</b> in steady pace running. In our previous studies, the 3 degrees of freedom viscoelastic model was proposed to reproduce the vertical ground <b>reaction</b> <b>force</b> and rebound velocity. According to the angle of the ground <b>reaction</b> <b>force</b> calculated from the ratio of vertical and horizontal ground <b>reaction</b> <b>force</b> during contact period, the model needed the rotational control element because the rotational behavior of the model was a very complicated movement. To generate the two dimensional ground <b>reaction</b> <b>force</b> of running, the nonlinear rotational viscoelastic elements were incorporated to the model and the parameters of the model were calculated with parameter searching. The two dimensional ground <b>reaction</b> <b>force</b> was reproduced with the proposed model...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare {{prosthetic}} weight-bearing tolerance in the standing position to the <b>dynamic</b> vertical ground <b>reaction</b> <b>forces</b> (VGRF) experienced during walking in elderly dysvascular trans-tibia 1 amputees. Ten unilateral trans-tibia 1 amputees attending an amputee clinic (mean age = 67 * 6. 5 years) were selected as subjects. Selection criteria were the level of amputation, age, medical fitness to participate and informed consent. Each participant completed five trials of standing (static) weight bearing measurement followed by 10 walking (dynamic) trials on a 10 m level walkway, five trials for each limb. Static weight bearing (SWB) was measured using standard bathroom scales. Dynamic weight bearing (DWB) was measured during gait using a Kistler multichannel force platform. T-tests for dependent means indicated that the forces borne in prosthetic single limb stance (mean= 0. 97 + 0. 03 times body weight (BW)) were significantly lower than the forces borne by the prosthetic limb during the first peak (weight acceptance) VGRF (mean = 1. 08 d. 08 BW; t =- 4. 999; p = 0. 001) and significantly higher than the midstance VGRF(mean = 0. 82 d. 07 BW; t = 5. 401; p~ 0. 001). However, there was no significant difference between SWB and the second peak (push-off) VGRF generated by the prosthetic limb during walking (mean = 0. 96 k 0. 03 BW). It was concluded that clinical gait training may utilise SWB as a guide All correspondence to be addressed t...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{measurement}} of ground <b>reaction</b> <b>forces</b> {{is important in}} the biomechanical analysis of gait and other motor activities. Many applications require full ambulatory {{measurement of}} these forces, but this is not supported by current measurement systems. We propose the use of two six-degrees-of-freedom force and moment sensors under each shoe, which enables the ambulatory measurement of ground <b>reaction</b> <b>forces</b> and centers of pressure (CoP). The feasibility of this method is illustrated by experimental results in a healthy subject, using a force plate as a reference. The ground <b>reaction</b> <b>forces</b> and CoP recordings show good correspondence when they are evaluated for forces above 40 N and when it is simply assumed that the sensors are flat on the ground when they are loaded. The root mean square (rms) difference of the magnitude of the ground <b>reaction</b> <b>force</b> over 12 gait trials was 15 2 N, corresponding to 1 9 0 3 % of the maximum ground <b>reaction</b> <b>force</b> magnitude. The rms difference of the horizontal component of the ground <b>reaction</b> <b>force</b> was 3 2 N, corresponding to 0 4 0 2 % of the maximum ground <b>reaction</b> <b>force</b> magnitude and to 2 1 % of the maximum of the horizontal component of the ground <b>reaction</b> <b>force.</b> The rms distance between both CoP recordings is 2 9 0 4 mm, corresponding to 1 1 0 2 % of the length of the shoe, when the trajectories are optimally aligned.
