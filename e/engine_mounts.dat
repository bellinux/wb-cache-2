5|$|In October 1990, while {{flying a}} {{training}} route in eastern Colorado, B-1B (s/n 86-0128) from the 384th Bomb Wing, 28th Bomb Squadron, McConnell AFB, experienced an explosion as the engines reached full power without afterburners. Fire on the aircraft's left was spotted. The #1 engine {{was shut down}} and its fire extinguisher was activated. The accident investigation determined that the engine had suffered catastrophic failure, engine blades had cut through the <b>engine</b> <b>mounts</b> and the engine became detached from the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the road surface, vibrations in a motorcycle {{can be caused by}} the engine and wheels, if unbalanced. Manufacturers employ a variety of technologies to reduce or damp these vibrations, such as engine balance shafts, rubber <b>engine</b> <b>mounts,</b> and tire weights. The problems that vibration causes have also spawned an industry of after-market parts and systems designed to reduce it. Add-ons include handlebar weights, isolated foot pegs, and engine counterweights. At high speeds, motorcycles and their riders may also experience aerodynamic flutter or buffeting. This can be abated by changing the air flow over key parts, such as the windshield.|$|E

40|$|<b>Engine</b> <b>mounting</b> {{is one of}} the {{important}} components in a vehicle to isolate noise and vibration generated by the engine from the driver and passenger. There are three main types of <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> such as passive <b>engine</b> <b>mounting,</b> semi-active <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> and active <b>engine</b> <b>mounting.</b> The price of the mounting in the market range from the cheapest which is passive <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> to the most expensive type of <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> which is the active <b>engine</b> <b>mounting.</b> The effectiveness of the <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> vary with the price of the <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> with the passive <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> being the low quality isolation of noise, vibration and harshness (NVH) and the active <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> being the highest quality isolation of NVH. In order to reduce the vibrations, noise and harshness (NVH) level for vehicles, understanding about the vibration characteristics of the passive <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> in detail is crucial. The objective of this project is to analyze the vibration cause by the engine of a Perodua Kenari on the <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> system at different engine revolutions per minute (rpm). The experiment is carried out on a stationary vehicle using DasyLab software. Here, analysis on the vibration obtained from the experiment carried out helps to determine the time response and frequency response of the engine at different rpm. From the results obtained, we can understand the characteristics of the passive <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> which is the fundamental of <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> among the three types. By understanding the characteristics of the passive <b>engine</b> <b>mounting,</b> improvement can be made on the <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> in a low cost method to further improve on the NVH isolation qualit...|$|R

40|$|Ride comfort is an {{important}} factor in any road vehicle performance. Nonetheless, passenger ride comfort is sometimes affected by the vibrations resulting from the road irregularities. Vehicle ride comfort is also often compromised by <b>engine</b> vibration. <b>Engine</b> <b>mount</b> is one of the devices which act as vibration isolator from unwanted vibration from engine to the driver and passengers. This paper explains the development of the test rig used for laboratory testing of Magnetorheological (MR) <b>engine</b> <b>mount</b> characterization. MR <b>engine</b> <b>mount</b> was developed to investigate the vibration isolation process. An <b>engine</b> <b>mount</b> test machine was designed to measure the displacement, relative velocity and damper force with respect to current supply to characterize the hysteresis behavior of the damper and as force tracking control of the MR <b>engine</b> <b>mount...</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{frame was}} made stiffer through the {{enlarging}} {{of the front}} <b>engine</b> <b>mounting</b> bolts, though this still left the ZX-9R with just a single front <b>engine</b> <b>mount</b> {{on either side of}} the frame. Further, the rubber bushings in the top rear <b>engine</b> <b>mount</b> were changed to alloy. This combined to make the engine's contribution to the stiffness of the frame/engine unit greater.|$|R

25|$|A joint {{investigation}} by the Russian Interstate Aviation Committee, aircraft manufacturer, engine manufacturer and Azerbaijani Ministry of National Security was launched. Azerbaijan Airlines believed defective spare parts caused the crash. The {{joint investigation}} commission found that vibration caused the nuts on the <b>engine</b> <b>mounts</b> to loosen and fall off. This caused the engine turbines to shift and became damaged, leading to the crash. Azerbaijan Airlines deputy head Nazim Javadov, however, said {{the use of the}} defective parts for repairs was permitted by the engine manufacturer, Russian company Perm Motors.|$|E
25|$|Jack Riley Sr. {{built the}} first model {{with a team of}} four. With {{encouragement}} from Lycoming, the 125hp Lycoming O-290 four-cylinder engine was selected for the project. Design changes from the basic Navion structure included strengthened wing spars, that supported <b>engine</b> <b>mounts</b> and other components from Piper PA-18 Super Cub, plus new engine nacelles, a faired nose section that replaced the existing engine and cowling, and a new vertical tail and rudder based on the existing horizontal stabilizer. During testing in 1952, the aircraft was initially named the X-16 Bi-Navion. On 10 November 1952, it was granted certification by the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA), after which it was renamed as the D-16 Twin Navion.|$|E
25|$|In October 2007, the Cervo {{received}} the Good Design Award, and the SR version was introduced. This had a new, 64hp direct injection turbo engine and a seven-step CVT transmission, {{the first time}} for such a combination to be available. With front-wheel drive, this car achieved a remarkable 23.0km/l (54 mpg) on the test cycle. The Cervo also received some minor updates across the line, with new liquid seal <b>engine</b> <b>mounts</b> and suspension changes. In May 2008 the range received more minor updates, with new colors being added and a new limited edition model, the G Limited II, which featured alcantara interior and a sporty exterior. Other models received new aero parts and other equipment, gas discharge headlights were now available on the SR.|$|E

25|$|To {{adapt the}} BMW M52 engine to the Defender chassis, the {{engineers}} {{were able to}} utilize some of the parts from the recently developed BMW M51 diesel powered Range Rover 2.5 DSE. They used the clutch housing, clutch, flywheel, and slave cylinder from that vehicle to connect the engine to the R380 gearbox, {{but they had to}} produce a new clutch housing adaptor (bell housing) for the petrol M52 engine in the Defender. The unique clutch housing adaptor was necessary because the petrol M52 engine is tilted 10 degrees compared to the diesel M51 engine and it needed to be longer to match the input shaft of the R380 gearbox borrowed from the 300Tdi Defender. Due to the large diameter gearbox input shaft, the standard BMW pilot bearing could not be fitted, so a unique pilot bushing made of Oilite bronze was developed. It had an inside diameter of 7/8 inch with an outside diameter of 32mm. A mixture of non-metric and metric specifications are common on Land Rovers. Other unique parts that were developed for the 2.8i were the air intake ducts {{both before and after the}} Donaldson FPG RadialSeal™ air cleaner, <b>engine</b> <b>mounts,</b> radiator cowl, cooling hoses, fuel lines, clutch lines, air conditioning system, engine wiring, tachometer gauge, exhaust system, and a specially tuned Siemens MS41.0 DME with a Lucas 10AS alarm in place of the Drive Away Protection system (EWS) used on BMWs. There were also major changes for the 1999 model year, which included updated instrumentation, different chassis and engine wiring, an updated cooling system with aluminum radiator, and an updated fuel system with new fuel tank. The 1.667:1 gear ratio LT230 transfer box gave the vehicle a “rev happy” nature which delighted many off-road enthusiasts and made the vehicle particularly well suited for traversing a wide range of grueling terrain such as sand dunes. The high gear ratio also helped the 2.8i sprint from 0–100km/h in 9.3 seconds, making it the fastest production Defender ever made.|$|E
