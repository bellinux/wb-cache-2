These efforts at a permanent settlement fell through, however, and the support for Montfort's government gradually eroded. Henry's oldest son, Edward â€“ the later King Edward Istarted a military campaign that ended in the Battle of Evesham in August 1265, where Earl Simon was defeated and killed.

5|$|Troglita did {{not remain}} inactive: from Carthage, the praetorian prefect Athanasius and Troglita's young son {{organized}} reinforcements and {{supplies for the}} camp at Laribus, while Troglita himself succeeded not only in reconciling Cutzinas and Isfidaias, but also in gaining the allegiance of King Iaudas and his tribe. In the spring of 548, Troglita, having regrouped his forces, met with his Moorish allies at the plain of Arsuris on the northern limits of Byzacena. Corippus gives extraordinary numbers for the native contingents provided by each chief: 30,000 for Cutzinas, 100,000 for Isfidaias, and 12,000 under Iaudas's brother. Whatever the real numbers, <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> Troglita's regular troops formed the lesser portion of the imperial army.|$|E

5|$|Philip {{probably}} also campaigned in Thrace in late 352 BC, possibly {{after returning to}} Macedon from Thessaly. At this point, if not before, Philip defeated Amadokos and subjugated him, and possibly also expelled Cetriporis from his client kingship. During the campaign, Philip's army reached deep into Kersebleptes' territory and laid siege to the fortress of Heraion Teichos located somewhere near Perinthos, {{on the coast of}} the Propontis (although Buckler places this siege in 353 BC). On learning of the siege, the Athenians voted to dispatch 40 triremes to oppose Philip. However, they then heard that Philip had died (or had been taken ill), so the relief mission never actually sailed. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> Philip did fall ill during the campaign, but exactly how the campaign ended is unclear. It was probably at this time that Philip took Kersebleptes' son as a hostage to Pella, effectively ending Kersebleptes' freedom of action.|$|E
5|$|Anne was the {{daughter}} of Thomas Boleyn, later Earl of Wiltshire and Earl of Ormond, and his wife, Lady Elizabeth Howard, daughter of Thomas Howard, 2nd Duke of Norfolk. Thomas Boleyn was a well respected diplomat with a gift for languages; he was also a favourite of King Henry VII, who sent him on many diplomatic missions abroad. Anne and her siblings grew up at Hever Castle in Kent. However, the siblings were born in Norfolk at the Boleyn home at Blickling. A lack of parish records from the period has made it impossible to establish Anne's date of birth. Contemporary evidence is contradictory, with several dates having been put forward by various historians. An Italian, writing in 1600, suggested that she had been born in 1499, while Sir Thomas More's son-in-law, William Roper, indicated a much later date of 1512. Her birth was most likely sometime between 1501 and 1507. As with Anne herself, it is uncertain when her two siblings were born, but <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> her sister Mary was older than Anne. Mary's children clearly believed their mother had been the elder sister. Most historians now agree that Mary was born in 1499. Mary's grandson claimed the Ormonde title in 1596 on the basis she was the elder daughter, which Elizabeth I accepted. Their brother George was born around 1504.|$|E
5|$|Thermopylae {{is arguably}} the most famous battle in European ancient history, {{repeatedly}} referenced in ancient, recent, and contemporary culture. In Western culture at least, it is the Greeks who are lauded for their performance in battle. However, {{within the context of the}} Persian invasion, Thermopylae was undoubtedly a defeat for the Greeks. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the Greek strategy was to hold off the Persians at Thermopylae and Artemisium; whatever they may have intended, it was presumably not their desire to surrender all of Boeotia and Attica to the Persians. The Greek position at Thermopylae, despite being massively outnumbered, was nearly impregnable. If the position had been held for even a little longer, the Persians might have had to retreat for lack of food and water. Thus, despite the heavy losses, forcing the pass was strategically a Persian victory, but the successful retreat of the bulk of the Greek troops was in its own sense a victory as well. The battle itself had showed what a few free men, willing to do anything for victory against the invaders, could accomplish, and the defeat at Thermopylae had turned Leonidas and the men under his command into martyrs. That boosted the morale of all Greek soldiers in the second Persian invasion.|$|E

25|$|Cebus albifrons albifrons {{is found}} in eastern Vichada, close to the type locality, and was defined by von Humboldt using a tame animal {{maintained}} by humans (and a pig) {{in the village of}} Maipures. The original description of von Humboldt described an ashy gray animal with a black tail tip, characteristics that are not typical of any known population of C. albifrons.

25|$|The {{merits of}} the {{allegations}} are impossible to judge, although <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> Archer was acquainted with Cahill.

One sceptic has pointed out that the evidence only emerged once Father Robert Persons had published his A Conference about the Next Succession to the Crown of England. The book does appear to have alarmed Elizabeth's advisers, and from that date onward the flow of supposed plots against the queen's life became steady. In 1601 Cecil himself was accused of treason at the trial of the Earl of Essex {{on the basis of his}} reading of Person's book, but survived this twist and went on to secure the succession of James I upon the queen's death two years later.|$|E
25|$|Based on Statius' own testimony, the Thebaid {{was written}} c. 80 â€“ c. 92 AD, {{beginning}} when the poet was around 35, {{and the work}} {{is thought to have}} been published in 91 or 92. The poem is divided into twelve books in imitation of Virgil's Aeneid and is composed in dactylic hexameter. In the Silvae, Statius speaks of his extensive work in polishing and revising the Thebaid and his public recitations of the poem. From the epilogue <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> Statius considered the Thebaid to be his magnum opus and believed that it would secure him fame for the future. In the poem, Statius follows Virgil closely as a model (in the epilogue he acknowledges his debt to Virgil), but he also references a wide range of sources in his handling of meter and episodes.|$|E
25|$|Since synephrine {{exists as}} either of two enantiomers (see Chemistry section below for further discussion), {{which do not}} produce {{identical}} biological effects (see Pharmacology section below) some researchers have examined the stereoisomeric composition of synephrine extracted from natural sources. Although <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> synephrine is found in those Citrus species which have been studied predominantly as the l-isomer, low levels of d-synephrine have been detected in juice and marmalade made from C. unshiu, and low levels (0.002%) {{have been reported in}} fresh fruit from C. aurantium. There are indications that some d-synephrine may be formed by the racemization of l-synephrine {{as a result of the}} processing of fresh fruit, although this matter has not been completely clarified. However, regardless of the situation in Citrus species, Ranieri and McLaughlin reported the isolation of racemic (i.e. a mixture of equal amounts of d- and l- stereoisomers) synephrine from a cactus of the Dolichothele genus, under conditions that would be unlikely to cause a significant amount of racemization.|$|E

25|$|The Pitmilly Lands lie on {{both sides}} of the Pitmilly Burn, a stream that joins the larger Kenly Water, just before the latter reaches the North Sea between Craig Hartle and Babbet Ness on the east Fife coast. The lands on the east side of the Pitmilly Burn border that sea. In order to define further the Pitmilly Lands as they have been known through the centuries, it is helpful to note that in the early 20th century, before it was broken up, the Pitmilly estate {{consisted}} of the manor house with its grounds, known as Pitmilly House, several farms, a flax mill and a grist mill, both of which may have been ruins then, and a fisherman's bothy. The farms, all of which are identified on the 2008 Ordnance Survey map, are Boghall, Falside, Hillhead, Morton of Pitmilly and Kilduncan. A possible source of confusion is that the Kenly Water has sometimes been known, and shown on maps, as Pitmilly Burn, but <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the Pitmilly Burn of the Pitmilly Lands is the tributary stream.|$|E
