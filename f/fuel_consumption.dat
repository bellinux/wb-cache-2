40|$|This study uses panel cointegration {{techniques}} {{to examine the}} impact of energy consumption, and trade on economic growth for five North Africa countries within a multivariate framework over the period 1980 - 2009. Short-run dynamic relationship shows that there is evidence of one way short-run relationship from i) output, exports, and capital to imports, ii) fossil <b>fuels</b> <b>consumption</b> to exports, iii) exports to capital and iv) labor to combustible renewables and waste consumption. The vector error correction model shows that there is evidence of long-run relationship running from i) combustible renewables and waste <b>consumption,</b> fossil <b>fuels</b> <b>consumption,</b> exports, imports, capital, and labor to output, ii) fossil <b>fuels</b> <b>consumption,</b> exports, imports, capital, and labor to combustible renewables and waste consumption, and iii) combustible renewables and waste <b>consumption,</b> fossil <b>fuels</b> <b>consumption,</b> exports, capital, and labor to imports. The long-run elasticities show that combustible renewables and waste consumption is not statistically significant and only fossil <b>fuels</b> <b>consumption</b> can affect output while trade is statistically significant and {{have a negative impact on}} output through imports and positive impact through exports. The policy implication of these results is that, in these countries, trade openness is not sufficiently efficient to incite the use of energies for production. ...|$|R

5|$|The size of {{the rebound}} effect is {{determined}} by the price elasticity of demand for the good. In a perfectly competitive market where fuel is the sole input used, if the price of fuel remains constant but efficiency is doubled, the effective price of travel would be halved (twice as much travel can be purchased). If in response, the amount of travel purchased more than doubles (i.e. demand is price elastic), then <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> would increase, and the Jevons paradox would occur. If demand is price inelastic, the amount of travel purchased would less than double, and <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> would decrease. However, goods and services generally use more than one type of input (e.g. fuel, labour, machinery), and other factors besides input cost may also affect price. These factors tend to reduce the rebound effect, making the Jevons paradox less likely to occur.|$|E

40|$|From a {{theoretical}} viewpoint, a lean or ultra-lean mixture improves thermal efficiency of internal combustion engines when operating at partial loads. This is confirmed is current practice with compression-ignited motors. However, spark-ignited engines actually reach the lowest specific <b>fuel</b> <b>consumptions</b> at air-fuel ratios {{not very far}} from the stoichiometric when the fuel is gasoline, since with leaner mixtures combustion becomes too slow and erratic. Stratified-charge engines allow leaner mixtures, but they require combustion chamber designs that penalize efficiency. The presence of hydrogen in the mixture increases combustion speed and reduces misfiring. As a result, the lowest specific <b>fuel</b> <b>consumptions</b> are obtained with leaner mixtures {{as a whole and}} are reduced in amounts, as the ratio of hydrogen to the total amount of fuel supplied is increased. In this work, a new system of hydrogen enrichment is presented: a small amount of hydrogen is stratified around the spark-plug in an open combustion chamber, in order to combine stratified-charge and hydrogen-enrichment benefits. An experimental prototype is described in detail and the first experimental results are reported...|$|R

5|$|The fan {{diameter}} {{varies with}} the different models of the CFM56, and that change has {{a direct impact on}} the engine performance. For example, the low-pressure shaft rotates at the same speed for both the CFM56-2 and the CFM56-3 models; the fan diameter is smaller on the -3, which lowers the tip speed of the fan blades. The lower speed allows the fan blades to operate more efficiently (5.5% more in this case), which increases the overall fuel efficiency of the engine (improving specific <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> nearly 3%).|$|E
5|$|The {{first two}} blocks of JF-17 {{is powered by}} a single Russian RD-93 {{turbofan}} engine, which is a variant of the RD-33 engine used on the MiG-29 fighter.

The advantages of using a single engine are a reduction in maintenance time and cost when compared to twin-engined fighters. A thrust-to-weight ratio of 0.99 can be achieved with full internal fuel tanks and no external payload. The engine's air supply is provided by two bifurcated air inlets (see airframe section).|$|E
