At the Dutch Grand Prix McLaren crashed out and Hulme retired with <b>ignition</b> <b>failure.</b> After Lotus had begun the first experimentation with wings in Monaco and Ferrari and Brabham had debuted full height wings in Belgium, McLaren fitted a rear wing to their car for the French Grand Prix. However, mounted above the engine on the sprung mass of the car, {{it was not as}} effective as Lotus's wing mounted on the unsprung suspension components. In France Hulme was fourth, then fifth in Britain but both cars were out of the points-earning positions at the German Grand Prix.|$|E

40|$|A {{solution}} {{was developed to}} mitigate the potential risk of <b>ignition</b> <b>failures</b> and burn-through in aluminum primer chamber assemblies on pyrovalves. This was accomplished by changing the assembly material from aluminum to steel, and reconfiguration of flame channels to provide more direct paths from initiators to boosters. With the geometric configuration of the channels changed, energy is more efficiently transferred from the initiators to the boosters. With the alloy change to steel, the initiator flame channels do not erode upon firing, eliminating the possibility of burn-through. Flight qualification tests have been successfully passed...|$|R
40|$|A 1 kW {{electronic}} load was programmed {{to simulate the}} nonlinear i-v (volt-ampere) characteristics of an arcjet, both ignited and unignited. The simulator was tested and found to closely resemble an arcjet both for large transients and small perturbances up to about 40 kHz. No {{attempt was made to}} simulate the ignition process itself. The dynamic behavior of the arcjet (and the simulator) was shown to differ significantly from that of a resistor bank. Previous research led to the design and construction of a 1 kW arcjet power supply. A high voltage ignition circuit was added to this hardware, and tests on a 1 kW arcjet were performed at NASA-Lewis. All tests were successful and no <b>ignition</b> <b>failures</b> were observed.

50|$|Although direct {{injection}} provides {{more power and}} efficiency, a carbon build-up occurs in the intake valves that over time reduces the airflow to the cylinders, and therefore reduces power. Fuel contains various detergents and can keep the intakes clean. When fuel is no longer being sprayed in the intake valves, small amounts of dirt from intake air and blowback carbon from the crankcase ventilation system cakes on the intake walls, even with air filters that prevent most of the dirt from entering the cylinder. This build-up can become severe enough that a piece can break off and {{has been known to}} burn holes in catalytic converters. It can also cause sporadic <b>ignition</b> <b>failures.</b> These problems have been known for some time and technologies have been improved to reduce the carbon build-up.|$|R
40|$|Radiochemical {{diagnostic}} signatures {{are well}} known to be effective indicators of nuclear ignition and burn reaction conditions. Nuclear activation is already a reliable technique to measure yield. More comprehensively, though, important quantities such as fuel areal density and ion temperature might be separately and more precisely monitored by a judicious choice of select nuclear reactions. This report details an initial assessment of this approach to diagnosing <b>ignition</b> <b>failures</b> on point-design cryogenic National Ignition Campaign targets. Using newly generated nuclear reaction cross section data for Scandium and Iridium, modest uniform doping of the innermost ablator region provides clearly observable reaction product differences between robust burn and failure for either element. Both equatorial and polar tracer loading yield observable, but indistinguishable, signatures for either choice of element for the preliminary cases studied...|$|R
40|$|New product {{diffusion}} {{is critical}} to entrepreneurship. Without successful diffusion, {{the emergence of a}} new business is incomplete. Although we have several well-established models of the diffusion phenomenon, these models mainly describe the macro-level diffusion patterns after their ignition, thereby ignoring the ignition mechanism. This study conceptualizes an entrepreneur’s introduction of a new product and its diffusion as a generative emergence from a complexity science perspective and employs agent-based modeling and simulation (ABMS) to explain the full ignition-diffusion process as well as <b>ignition</b> <b>failures.</b> In this study’s model, the ignition process is made of individual consumers’ heterogeneous thresholds and their relative levels of activities. These micro-level characteristics and behaviors influence the speed and scope of the diffusion at the macro-level. Our simulations reveal the minimum number of initial adopters required to ignite the diffusion process and show how an entrepreneur’s advertising campaign may accelerate the ignition and diffusion speed. The simulations also reveal how consumers’ negative word-of-mouth may reduce the diffusion scope...|$|R

40|$|A {{project was}} {{developed}} to improve and implement new methods for measurement and analysis on the Purdue Hydrogen-Oxygen Multi-Element Experiment (HOMEE). The first step was the continued {{development and implementation of}} the Purdue Ignitor for reliable ignition. The overall development of the ignitor spanned several years, and has achieved a greater than 96 % reliability overall, with no <b>ignition</b> <b>failures</b> on the HOMEE project. ^ Further analytical improvements dictated the calibration of pressure transducers and venturis to provide well defined mass flow rate accuracy, determined to be 2. 3 %. New calibration setups and methods were developed to improve the accuracy. The pressure transducer setup was thoroughly analyzed and has proven useful in detecting nonlinear transducers prior to installation as well as the ability to identify nonfunctional transducers. ^ Work was also completed on the temperature measurements by an investigation of non-uniform flow via intentional local O/F biasing. The local O/F biasing was done by changing the inlet area on two of the seven injectors such that the LOX flow to each was biased up to 15 %. The data collected was inconclusive in determining the ability to detect small changes in the flow rates based on thermocouple data. ^ Overall the improvements to the data collection and data reduction methods were significant, and the overall reliability of the hardware was demonstrated. The project greatly improved the overall understanding of the driving uncertainty parameters, (venturi CD and upstream venturi pressure) in the mass flow rate, and allowed for further improvements to be concentrated on those parameters achieving larger gains in lowering the uncertainty. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{ignition}} thresholds of TiHx/KC 104, Mg/Teflon, and an A 1 -torch mix {{are measured}} {{as a function}} of gas pressure for ignition by 514. 5 nm pulses from an argon ion laser. The TiHx/KC 104 system in argon gas has three distinct pressure regimes. The thresholds are very high below about 0. 3 MPa, decrease rapidly between 0. 3 and 1. 5 MPa, and decrease gradually and become constant between 1. 5 and 7 MPa. Mg/Teflon and the A 1 -torch mix also have decreasing thresholds with increasing gas pressures and decreasing pellet densities. Ignition pulse lengths between 0. 25 and 20 milliseconds at a spot diameter of 65 microns in the TiHx/KC 104 system indicate that the thresholds are predominantly power, not energy, thresholds for pulses longer than one millisecond. The increase in threshold power below one millisecond is consistent with a calculated time to reach thermal equilibrium of 0. 96 milliseconds. The effect of beam diameters between 40 and 175 microns on the TiHx/KC 104 thresholds is consistent with ignitions occurring at approximately the same temperature {{at the center of the}} beam. TiHx/KC 104 and Zr/KC 104 /Viton/Graphite pyrotechnics are also ignitied in sealed devices through sapphire windows. Ignition thresholds are comparable to those on open surfaces in pressures of 0. 1 to 0. 5 MPa which suggests that samples first decompose and ignite under a pocket of pressure. <b>Ignition</b> <b>failures</b> in TiHx/KC 104 and in low density Zr/KC 104 /Viton/Graphite samples are attributed to increased porosity and/or gaps near the windows which allow reaction products to escape from the ignition zone...|$|R

40|$|Based on {{a general}} theory of {{detonation}} waves with an embedded sonic locus that we have developed in Kasimov (2004) and Stewart & Kasimov (2004), we carry out asymptotic analysis of weakly-curved slowly-varying detonation waves and show that the theory predicts the phenomenon of detonation <b>ignition</b> and <b>failure.</b> The analysis is not restricted to near Chapman??Jouguet detonation speeds and is capable of predicting quasi-steady, normal detonation shock speed, curvature (D??k) curves with multiple turning points. An evolution equation that retains the shock acceleration, D(dot), namely a D(dot) ??D??k relation is rationally derived and its solution for spherical (or cylindrical) detonation is shown to reproduce the ignition/failure phenomenon observed in both numerical simulations of blast wave initiation and in experiments. A simple physically transparent explanation of the ignition phenomenon is given {{in terms of the}} form of the evolution equation. A single-step chemical reaction described by one progress variable is employed, but the kinetics is sufficiently general and is not restricted to Arrhenius form, although most specific calculations in this work are performed for Arrhenius kinetics.

30|$|Rock dust {{bags are}} {{extensively}} {{used in some}} counties to create barriers for stopping explosion propagation. In order to make this explosion mitigation measure effective, the barriers should be properly placed and a certain minimum pressure is required to activate them. Various reports show more failure than successes in using this explosion mitigation measure (Zou and Panawalage 2001). Most failures are attributed to improper location, improper design, poor installation, and inadequate maintenance. If the explosion is too weak to disperse the selves—often {{as a result of}} placing the rock dust barriers closer than 60  m from the <b>ignition</b> point, a <b>failure</b> may occur. In addition, if the pressure front or the flame front moves too fast or is too short, the flame front could have easily passed the barrier locations before the dispersion of inert material is completed (Dixon et al. 1994).|$|R
