An intermediate protocol was also evaluated in which 0. 5 mol l(- 1) <b>hydroxylammonium</b> <b>chloride</b> at pH 2 was used. The procedures were applied to five soil and sediment substrates: a sewage sludge-amended soil, two different industrially contaminated soils, a river sediment and an inter-tidal sediment. Extractable iron and manganese concentrations were measured to assess {{the effects of the}} procedural modifications on dissolution of the reducible matrix components. Trace elements copper, lead and zinc were also determined. Statistical analysis (two-tailed t-tests at 95 % confidence interval) indicated that recovery of iron in step 2 was not markedly enhanced when the intermediate protocol was used. However, significantly greater amounts were isolated with the revised BCR scheme than with the original procedure. Copper behaved similarly to iron. Lead recoveries were increased by use of both modified protocols, with the greatest effect occurring for the revised BCR extraction. In contrast, manganese and zinc extraction did not vary markedly between procedures.

40|$|A three-stage {{sequential}} extraction procedure, {{following a}} protocol proposed by a European working group coordinated {{and supported by}} the Community Bureau of Reference (BCR), has been applied to two river sediments from an industrial region of East Catalonia, Spain. The extractant solutions were: Step One, acetic acid (0. 11 mol l(- 1)); Step Two, <b>hydroxylammonium</b> <b>chloride</b> (0. 1 mol l(- 1), pH 2); Step Three, hydrogen peroxide (8. 8 mol l(- 1)) oxidation followed by extraction with ammonium acetate (1 mol l(- 1), pH 2). The six elements determined in the extracts were Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn. Analysis of the extracts was carried out by flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS). There were slight differences in analyte sensitivity between calibrants prepared in the extractant matrices and acidified aqueous calibrants. No significant matrix interferences were found except for Cr in the acetic acid and <b>hydroxylammonium</b> <b>chloride</b> extracts, which required determination by the standard additions method.

Step 2 of the unmodified BCR procedure (subsequently called Method A) involves treatment with 0. 1 M <b>hydroxylammonium</b> <b>chloride</b> at pH 2, whereas 0. 5 M <b>hydroxylammonium</b> <b>chloride</b> at pH 1. 5 was used in the modified BCR procedure (subsequently called Method B). Metal analyses were carried out by flame atomic absorption spectrometry. A pseudo-total aqua-regia digest of BCR CRM 701 has also been undertaken for quality assurance purposes. The recovery of Method A for all metals studied ranges from 96. 14 to 105. 26, while the recovery for Method B ranges from 95. 94 to 122. 40. Our results reveal that Method A underestimated the proportion of metals bound to the easily reducible fraction except for copper. Therefore, the potential mobility of these elements is higher than others.

40|$|The revised, four-step BCR {{sequential}} extraction for soil or sediment {{has been}} compared with an alternative procedure in which 0. 2 mol 1 (- 1) ammonium oxalate (pH 3) replaced 0. 5 mol 1 (- 1) <b>hydroxylammonium</b> <b>chloride</b> (pH 1. 5) in step 2, the reducible step. A variety of substrates were studied: BCR CRM 601, a sewage sludge amended soil, two industrial soils, and a steel manufacturing by-product (basic oxygen furnace filter cake). Greater amounts of iron were recovered in step 2 when acid ammonium oxalate was used, for all substrates. Similar trends were observed for copper. Manganese and zinc were not strongly affected by the procedural modification, except for zinc in the two industrial soils, where oxalate extraction proved more efficient than use of <b>hydroxylammonium</b> <b>chloride.</b> A {{large proportion of the}} calcium and lead isolated in step 2 of the BCR procedure was not released until step 3 when the alternative procedure with oxalate in step 2 was used. This is probably due to rapid precipitation of analyte oxalates from solution. Thus, whilst oxalate offers superior dissolution of iron-containing matrix components, it should not be used if calcium or lead concentrations are to be measured. Selection of the most appropriated sequential extraction protocol for use in a particular study must always be carried out on the basis of 'fitness for purpose' criteria. However, the revised BCR protocol, involving use of 0. 5 mol 1 (- 1) (NH 2 OHHCI) -H-. in the reducible step, appears to be more generally applicable than procedures involving acid ammonium oxalate.

Our results reveal that facile-synthesized BiOCl NPs display strong UV-Vis light adsorption, improved charge carrier mobility and an inhibited rate of charge carrier recombination, when compared to traditional BiOCl. These enhancements result in an improved photocatalytic degradation rate of hazardous organic dyes under UV-Vis irradiance. For instance, the facile-synthesized BiOCl NPs attained 100 % degradation of methylene blue and methyl orange dyes in approximately 30 mins under UV-Vis irradiation, against 55 % degradation for traditional BiOCl under similar experimental conditions...|$|E

The PMA grafted OPEFB (PMA-OPEFB) was treated with <b>hydroxylammonium</b> <b>chloride</b> in alkaline medium to produce hydroxamic acid grafted fiber (PHA-OPEFB). The FTIR spectrum of OPEFB grafted with PMA showed an intense absorption band at 1734 cm- 1 which is attributed to C=O vibration in the grafted ester.

Results obtained by ICP-MS for aqua regia digests were slightly lower than those obtained by alpha spectrometry, but overall recoveries of uranium by sequential extraction were generally within +/- 10 % of pseudototal values. Application of the developed method to inter-tidal sediments collected from the vicinity of the Albright and Wilson phosphoric acid plant, Whitehaven, Cumbria, confirmed the presence of significant technological enhancement of uranium at Whitehaven Harbour but showed that concentrations had decreased since the plant discontinued phosphate ore processing in 1992.

The pseudototal metal content of the layers was determined following a microwave-assisted digestion with aqua regia. Operational speciation was performed using the BCR three-step sequential extraction procedure. Analyses were carried out by flame or electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS or ETAAS). A suppressive interference (similar to 30 %) was observed in the determination of cadmium in aqua regia digests by ETAAS, but not in 0. 11 mol l(- 1) acetic acid, 0. 1 mol l(- 1) <b>hydroxylammonium</b> <b>chloride</b> or 1. 0 mol l(- 1) ammonium acetate extracts.

40|$|The {{heterogeneously}} catalysed {{synthesis of}} promising substances {{for the use}} as stabilising lubricants derived from epoxystearic acid methyl ester by nucleophilic ring opening could be carried out successfully. With yields of more than 70 % mono-, di-, and triethyleneglycol, oxalic and malonic acid and <b>hydroxylammonium</b> <b>chloride</b> could be added. Also was {{the addition of the}} fatty alcohols n-octanol and n-dodecanol successful, as was the addition of the widely used industrial alcohol 2 -ethylhexanol, but in improvable yields of 30 %- 70 %. Also a variety of carboxylic acid derivatives of eSME could be synthesised, but not by nucleophilic ring opening. Due to the low reactivity of the carboxylic acids, eSME was opened with methanol and the product HMSME was esterified with the acids to form the substances methyl- 9 / 10 -hydroxy- 10 / 9 -pentanoyloxyoctadecanoate, methyl- 9 / 10 -hydroxy- 10 / 9 -hexadecanoyloxyoctadecanoate and methyl- 9 / 10 -hydroxy- 10 / 9 -(3 -oxobutanoyloxy) octadecanoate. All of the synthesised substances did not have any lubricating or stabilising effect in the polymer tests. Just the product of the reaction of eSME with hydroxyammonium chloride had a positive effect on the polymer colour, but it dramatically decreased its thermal stability. In the used amount of 1 phr, a distinct brightening of the colour was observed, accompanied by a quick degradation in the heat. The use of smaller amounts (0. 5 and 0. 2 phr) made the positive effect on the colour decease, but the negative one on the thermal stability still occur. A use in different polymer mixtures might have, due to different interaction with other additives, a distinct effect was observed, when 9, 10 -dihydroxystearic acid was used as an additive. Although DHSA did not have any effect on the lubrication or the thermal stability of the polymer mixture, it had a strong effect on its viscosity. While the viscosity increasing effect was clearly observable in laboratory scale, the upscaling to the industrially used extruder led to a breakdown due to mechanical overload, because the effect was too strong. To make up a useful amount of DHSA as an additive, additional experiments have to be carried out. Also the its preparation, at the moment via stochiometric chemistry, can be improved if the produced amounts rise by using the benefits of environmentally benign heterogeneous catalysis. Adding polyols an especially glycerol to eSME was not successful. Either the sterical requirements of these big molecules are too high, or the experimental setting made the addition impossible. In the first case, spear molecules could be a solution to lower the size of the active group, but these molecules would have to be synthesised intricately. Also, as shown with the n-alcanols, an increasing molecular weight lowers the reactivity. In any case, the addition of polyols to eSME should be further investigated, because this is a promising way to decrease additive migration or stop it completely. Also without success, against all presumptions, was the addition of nitrogen nucleophiles to eSME, although many patents and publications reported the feasibility of this reaction. But none of these publications delivered any spectroscopic proof of synthesising the desired product, only functional tests and elemental analysis was performed. Further investigations, eventually further calculations with the reactants DEA and eSME could lead to a solution to the problem, whether the reaction is impossible to perform or technical or practical conditions led to this failure. It also may be possible, that the synthesised substances give better results in different polymer mixtures. The numerous interactions between the additives make an evaluation difficult, so that a vast number of different mixtures has to be tested. A promising substance is HAM-SME with its colour improving effect, which coultd leave the thermal stability unaffected in other mixtures. With this work showing, that the heterogeneously catalysed synthesis of several derivatives of eSME is possible, these substances could be investigated as lubricants in other fields of the tribology. For example the eSME-glycol-adducts could serve well as additive or emulsifier in water based cooling lubricants. If this use makes sense, the catalyst can be improved as well...|$|E
