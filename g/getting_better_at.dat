500|$|Responding to {{criticism}} that some first season episodes were too neatly wrapped and solved, Jeff Pinkner commented {{towards the end}} of that season, [...] "We found that, absolutely, early on, we were falling into the trap of—the tease would be fantastic. And then we would too quickly answer it and [...] the tension. And we've tried to course-correct and have the tease promise" [...] questions that don't get answered right away. He further elaborated that the goal now is to [...] "have the energy of the show get bigger as [...] goes along... We're learning how to tell this version of a detective story. It's not really a police procedural. There are elements of that. But it's an incredible mish-mash of genres. I think we're <b>getting</b> <b>better</b> <b>at</b> finding our way through these stories." ...|$|E
500|$|For {{its fourth}} album, R.E.M. enlisted John Mellencamp {{producer}} Don Gehman. The result, Lifes Rich Pageant (1986) featured Stipe's vocals {{closer to the}} forefront of the music. In a 1986 interview with the Chicago Tribune, Peter Buck related, [...] "Michael is <b>getting</b> <b>better</b> <b>at</b> what he's doing, and he's getting more confident at it. And I think that shows up in the projection of his voice." [...] The album improved markedly upon the sales of Fables of the Reconstruction and eventually peaked at number 21 on the Billboard album chart. The single [...] "Fall on Me" [...] also picked up support on commercial radio. The album was the band's first to be certified gold for selling 500,000 copies. While American college radio remained R.E.M.'s core support, the band was beginning to chart hits on mainstream rock formats; however, the music still encountered resistance from Top 40 radio.|$|E
500|$|Amy Poehler {{said the}} first season {{struggled}} {{in part due to}} extremely high expectations from comparisons to The Office. Parks and Recreation staff also felt {{part of the reason for}} the improvement was that the characters have become better developed, and viewers have come to like and care more about them. Likewise, Michael Schur believed much of the early criticism stemmed from the fact that audiences were not yet familiar with the characters, and he believed viewers liked the second season better because they had gotten to know the characters better as the series progressed. Commentators said the supporting cast was now working with better material and that Poehler's character had improved and become less over-the-top and more human than in the first season, and more distinct from Michael Scott. Several reviewers praised the decision to drop season one subplots that risked becoming stale, like whether Andy and Ann would keep dating, and Leslie's long-standing crush on Mark. Others complimented the decision to fill in the pit during the second season, which they said freed the show up for more stories and better scripts. Despite the vast change in critical reception, Parks and Recreation staff said they felt only a few minor changes were made to the show itself. Michael Schur said, [...] "I don't think magical fairy dust was sprinkled over the show. I just think we're <b>getting</b> <b>better</b> <b>at</b> it." [...] NBC officials compared the late rush of critical acclaim for Parks and Recreation to that of The Office, which received mixed reviews during its first season before most critics agreed it found its rhythm in the second season.|$|E

[...] In a trend that started when then-vocalist Chuck Mosley lived in Los Angeles while the rest of the band resided in the Bay Area, the band would record demo tapes of the songs and exchange them between each other in Los Angeles before sending them to Jim Martin so that he could work on his guitar arrangements after which he would send them back for approval.|$|E
