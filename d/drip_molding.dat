2500|$|The front {{facade of}} the {{building}} displays {{an example of the}} lively architectural taste of the mid-to-late 19th century. [...] The contrast of red brick with light accents was a favorite of the high Victorian Gothic style. [...] The hoods and <b>drip</b> <b>molds</b> over the windows are medieval in style, while the tall, bracketed cornice shows the influence of the Italianate style.|$|R
50|$|The main {{entrance}} has {{two sets of}} double doors set in a segmental-arched entryway topped with a <b>drip</b> <b>mold,</b> similar to the windows. The outer doors are wooden with three large glass panes. They protect a pair of wooden inner doors with decoration similar to that on the porch just outside. Among the original interior features in the house are its original stairwell and two marble mantels.|$|R
50|$|A stone {{water table}} sets off the {{foundation}} stone from the brick facing the house. Windows on the facade are all one-over-one double-hung sash windows {{set in a}} slightly recessed wooden surround and topped by segmentally arched <b>drip</b> <b>molds,</b> as are all windows elsewhere on the building. The only deviation is above the front porch, where two narrower versions of the windows echo the double main entrance doors below.|$|R
50|$|The Columbia Union Church {{is located}} in northeastern Columbia, {{on the north side}} of Epping Road just east of its {{junction}} with Cemetery Road. It is a single-story wood frame structure, with a front-facing gable roof, clapboard and shingle siding, and a granite foundation. The front facade faces south, and has a fully pedimented gable above a pair of entrances that flank a central window. The doors and window are topped by Gothic <b>drip</b> <b>molding,</b> which is also found on other windows. The building's corners have pilasters, which rise to an entablature that encircles the building. A two-stage tower rises above the front, with windows in the second stage and crenellations above. The tower features <b>drip</b> <b>molding,</b> pilasters and friezes similar to those found on the main body.|$|E
50|$|The -story wood-frame cottage {{was built}} in 1856, and is a well-preserved example of Gothic Revival styling. This {{instance}} in particular is notable for its drip-style bargeboard decoration. The house was built {{as part of the}} initial subdivision of the Strawberry Hill area. Other Gothic features, including finials on the gable and <b>drip</b> <b>molding</b> surrounding the windows, have been lost.|$|E
50|$|Lynnwood is a {{historic}} house at 5 Linden Avenue in Wakefield, Massachusetts. Built c. 1858, {{it is one of}} the town's finest examples of Stick style architecture. It is a 1-1/2 story wood frame structure with an L-shaped cross-gable configuration; its features include deep eaves supported by arched brackets, and a 3-1/2 story tower topped by a hip roof with triangular dormer windows. Its eaves have brackets with pendants, and its windows have surrounds with <b>drip</b> <b>molding.</b>|$|E
50|$|The only {{feature of}} Perpendicular style is the three-light west window {{set in the}} tower and the Tudor <b>drip</b> <b>mold</b> over the window {{suggests}} it is very late in the Perpendicular period. The lower courses of the tower are earlier, and a late Romanesque/Transitional period west tower door is set into these courses. This may indicate that the tower was originally built in the earlier part of the 13th century, either before or {{at the time that}} the church was appropriated by Strata Marcella.|$|R
50|$|The handsome, asymmetrical, twin-spired Gothic Revival St. Joseph’s Church was {{designed}} around 1888-1890 by architect F.E. Page. The building has a tall, end-gable-roof, rectangular mass with a polygonal, hip-roof apse at the northeast end. One-story, shed-roof side aisles continue around the apse as an ambulatory {{to connect to}} a projecting, rectangular chapel. The three-story, shorter corner tower has paired lancet windows, battlemented string courses, louver-filled Gothic arches, and is topped by a broach spire. The four-story tower has large, traceried Gothic windows, <b>drip</b> <b>molds,</b> and is surmounted by an octagonal belfry and spire.|$|R
5000|$|... "Fenestration {{is mostly}} stained glass lancet windows, with drip moulds. Front gable has {{crucifix}} at apex, riche with corbelled <b>drip</b> <b>molds</b> containing bronze statue of St. Francis, rose window with radiating spokes immediately below. Central entrance has Gothic-arched opening with corbelled drip moulding, elaborate carved and glazed double doors, gabled brick entrance porch; flanking tower entrances are identical though smaller in scale, and with single doors. Towers have large recessed panels on 1st tier, 4-gabled 2nd tier with corbelled frieze Gothic-arched louvres; copper spires have flying buttresses, flemish wall-dormer louvres, wrought iron open-work crosses on top."

5000|$|In 1909 local {{architect}} Percival M. Lloyd, who {{had earlier}} designed the eclectic Lady Washington Hose Company building {{a few blocks}} to the south on Academy Street, was hired to build the new one. His building includes many features of the Gothic Revival II style, which was used for many public buildings in the early 20th century ... the projecting central bay, roof castellation, stone lintels with <b>drip</b> <b>molding</b> and arches, the stone course between the two lower floors and a mock stone basement at ground level.|$|E
50|$|Built in 1829 as the Epping Baptist Church, {{this was}} the first church {{building}} to be built within the municipal bounds of Columbia, which was incorporated in 1796. The congregation had been meeting in private homes since 1788 prior to construction of this building. It is unclear at what point the building's use changed to that of a union church (serving multiple denominations), but the Columbia Union Society was formally organized in 1866 to oversee the building's rehabilitation. Under that organization's oversight the building was renovated, adding Gothic features such as the tower crenellations and <b>drip</b> <b>molding.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Commerce Block-Hermes Building Building was {{constructed}} in 1870, but its Neo-classical stone ashlar façade now reflects the changes the district went through from the late 19th to the early 20th century. The elevation facing Maiden Lane Alley includes paired windows with round arch <b>drip</b> <b>molding,</b> reflecting its commercial Italianate origin. One of the first important cultural buildings, the Everett Building, was completed in 1871. Constructed in the Second Empire style with local sandstone and brick, the building housed a performance hall, offices and retail space. After an 1897 fire, owner S.T. Everett renovated the building and added two additional stories, making it primarily offices, although the Akron Public Library occupied the second story.|$|E
2500|$|The {{greatest}} novelty for 1981 was {{the introduction}} of a third trim level within the VAM's Rally line, the company's first high-end luxury sporty model called Rally SST. This version carried the same mechanicals as the Rally AMX except that it came equipped from the factory with the three-speed automatic transmission. Appearance wise, the car carried bright trim on the rocker panels, wheel lips, <b>drip</b> rails, B-pillar <b>molding</b> plus door and side glass bases. The moldings for the windshield and rear glass were also bright instead of blacked out while both bumpers were chromed. The lower portions of the sides, doors and front fenders carried wide moldings with a horizontal six-stripe pattern. The in-house five-spoke wheels held AMC's [...] "Noryl" [...] wheel cover design. Finally, chromed squared mirrors with inside controls were fitted to the doors. The Rally SST is the closest VAM counterpart to the AMC Spirits in terms of appearance and the Mexican equivalent of the US AMC Spirit Limited model. To reduce the sportiness and enforce the luxury appointments of the line, a fender-mounted electric antenna was made standard equipment so the AMX's sporty roof-mounted diagonal design would not be present. For this same reason, the rear spoiler was not available. Among its unique characteristics, the Rally SST included side armrest safety reflectors and sun visor lighted vanity mirror from the factory, which were unavailable in the AMXs and GTs. The interior of the Rally SST was the same as the one of the GTs and AMXs with the only exceptions of the center console having an open compartment in place of the auxiliary gauges and the quartz electric digital clock instead of both tachometer types. Despite the luxury focus, the sporty aspects were retained {{in the form of the}} individual reclining Recaro-type bucket seats, center console with armrest and rear ashtray, floor-mounted transmission, leather-wrapped sports steering wheel and the full suspension package with rear sway bar.|$|R
50|$|The Daman House {{stands on}} a hill {{overlooking}} the Ottauquechee River in western Woodstock. Wyman Lane, which provides access to the house, is {{a portion of the}} former stage route, now bypassed by United States Route 4 to the south. The main house is a 2-1/2 story I-house, five bays wide, and one bay deep, with a large ell extending to its rear. It has a post-and-beam frame, is covered by a gabled roof, and its exterior is sheathed in wooden clapboards. It rests on a c. 1945 concrete foundation, faced in granite. It has sash windows framed by plain surrounds with <b>drip</b> <b>molding.</b> The main entrance is flanked by pilasters and topped by a half-round transom and gabled pediment. The interior retains many original period features, including a fireplace surround finished in Dutch tile, something that is quite rare in Vermont.|$|E
50|$|The Winthrop Street Baptist Church {{is set on}} {{the west}} side of Winthrop Street (United States Route 44), across the Mill River from the heart of {{downtown}} Taunton. It is a single-story structure, built out of brick with brownstone trim. It has a gable, roof, and a square tower projects from the front (east-facing) facade. The main entrance is at the base of the tower, set in a Gothic-arched opening with brownstone <b>drip</b> <b>molding.</b> This molding detail and Gothic styling is repeated on most of the church's windows. The tower has buttresses at the corners, and the sides of the building are similarly buttressed. Above the main entrance is a large Gothic-arched stained glass window in the tower's tall second stage, above which stands the belfry, with louvered round-arch openings. The tower is topped by a pyramidal roof.|$|E
50|$|The Division No. 9 School {{is located}} {{on the south side of}} Maine State Route 9 in rural southwestern Wells, east of its {{junction}} with Bragdon Road. It is set on a small grassy lot surrounded by forest. It is a single-story wood frame structure with a front-facing gable roof, clapboard siding, and a granite foundation. The front facade has a pair of matching entrances flanking a doubled sash window at the center, with a slightly smaller similar window pair in the gable above. The doors are topped by transom windows, and both doors and windows have <b>drip</b> <b>molding</b> caps. The west facade has two groups of three sash windows flanking a single sash window, and the east facade has two sash windows. The south side of the building has a shed-roof ell, which contains the building's bathrooms and a woodshed. The interior of the building is well preserved, with tongue-and-groove wainscoting in both the entrance vestibules and the classroom.|$|E
50|$|The Union Evangelical Church {{is located}} west of Addison's village center, at the {{junction}} of Ridge Road with Church Hill Lane. It is set on a rise overlooking the Pleasant River, providing a spectacular view of the Maine coast. The building is a single-story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, clapboard siding, and granite foundation. The roof is topped by a two-stage square tower, consisting of a low first stage, and a belfry stage with rectangular louvers in each wall, framed by projecting hoods and pilasters. A simple dentillated cornice caps that stage. The tower was apparently once topped by crenellations. The building corners have pilasters with lancet-arched panels, rising to a broad entablature extending across the front and sides. The front facade is symmetrical, {{with a pair of}} entrances on either side of a central pair of long and narrow windows. The window and doors are topped by Gothic <b>drip</b> <b>molding,</b> a detail carried to the windows on the sides.|$|E
50|$|The Jenkins House {{is set on}} {{the east}} side of Pine Street, just south of State Street in Bangor's {{downtown}} area. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, roughly square in shape, with a peaked side gable roof which has a full second story under it, and a front facing steeply-pitched gable. The main (west-facing) facade is three bays wide, with the center entrance sheltered by a portico that has turned posts, a spindled frieze, and a jigsawn balcony rail above. The flanking bays have paired sash windows framed by louvered triangles above and <b>drip</b> <b>molding</b> at the side. The sides of the house are five bays at the first floor, three at the second, and one at the attic level, all with single sash windows that have similar trim. The interior contains high-quality trim elements exhibiting a diversity of styles, including early Italianate surrounds, a Federal style staircase, and original Greek Revival chimney surrounds on the second floor.|$|E
