5|$|In {{the early}} 16th century the great Safavid king, Shah Abbas <b>I</b> <b>settled</b> {{a number of}} Zoroastrians {{in a suburb of}} his new capital, Isfahan. The suburb of Isfahan where the Zoroastrians lived was called Gabr-Mahal, Gabristan or Gabrabad, derived from the word Gabr. Europeans who visited his court left {{accounts}} of the 'Gabars' or 'Gabrs', (an insulting term used for Zoroastrians by the Muslims), agree on the poverty and simplicity of their lives. Fearing desecration by Muslims, Zoroastrians hid the sacred fires, and conversed in a newly invented dialect called Dari. Later Safavid kings were not as tolerant as Shah Abbas. Muhammad Baqir Majlisi persuaded Sultan Husayn (1688–1728 CE) to decree the forcible conversion of Zoroastrians, those who refused were killed.|$|E
500|$|During {{the podium}} ceremony, Schumacher, Coulthard and Berger did not spray the {{traditional}} champagne as {{a mark of}} respect to Senna. Schumacher felt lucky to win the race, conceding that [...] "Damon {{was a little bit}} quicker than me...he ended up going off and that's racing, but I don't think I could have caught him." [...] He also believed that his good start was fortunate, as it was the first one he had made in the new Benetton car; the team had not practised starts previously due to being short of time. He also specified his evasion of Barrichello's slowing car in the pit-lane entry while making his first stop as a crucial moment of the race. Coulthard admitted that he had been affected by his tonsillitis: [...] "I wasn't able to match Michael and Damon's pace so <b>I</b> <b>settled</b> for running my own race". Berger, meanwhile, was frustrated to finish a lap down on Schumacher, saying that [...] "He was faster everywhere: down the straights, {{going in and out of}} the corners. What can you do in these conditions? Okay, the car's roadholding is not bad. We must work very hard now. But at least I finished, that's something." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a warm up {{game against}} England, as {{preparation}} for the 2007 Cricket World Cup Leverock took the wickets of Paul Collingwood and notably Kevin Pietersen, his 10 over spell returning figures of 2 for 32 and resulting in Leverock attaining a [...] cult following around the world. Leverock commented, [...] "It {{was the first time}} I have played against a team like this. <b>I</b> <b>settled</b> into a rhythm, and when <b>I</b> <b>settled,</b> I took wickets. The wicket was turning a little bit". England captain Michael Vaughan was full of praise for Leverock's performance. [...] "He bowled very well. Any spinner that drags Kevin Pietersen out of his crease, and does him in the flight, is a good bowler".|$|E

2500|$|In The Confession, McGreevey {{describes}} the duality {{of his life}} before he came out as gay: [...] "As glorious and meaningful {{as it would have}} been to have a loving and sound sexual experience with another man, I knew I'd have to undo my happiness step by step as I began chasing my dream of a public career and the kind of 'acceptable' life that went with it. So, instead, <b>I</b> <b>settled</b> for the detached anonymity of bookstores and rest stopsa compromise, but one that was wholly unfulfilling and morally unsatisfactory." ...|$|E
