25|$|Illuminants A, B, and C were {{introduced}} in 1931, {{with the intention of}} respectively representing average incandescent light, direct sunlight, and average daylight.

40|$|AbstractThe {{identification}} of objects, <b>illuminants,</b> and transparencies {{are probably the}} most important perceptual functions of color. This paper examines the effects of perceptual scission, image junctions, color adaptation, and color correlations on identification. Simulations of natural <b>illuminants,</b> materials, and filters were used in a forced-choice procedure to simultaneously measure thresholds for identifying filters and objects across <b>illuminants,</b> and discrimination thresholds within <b>illuminants.</b> In {{the vast majority of the}} cases, if observers could discriminate within <b>illuminants</b> they could identify across <b>illuminants.</b> Since results were similar for identical color distributions, whether transparency cues like X-junctions were present or not, the primary cues for color identification were systematic color shifts across <b>illuminants.</b> These color shifts can be well described by three-parameter affine transformations, and the parameters can be derived from differences and ratios of mean chromaticities. A strategy based on post-transformation color matching predicts generally accurate identification despite perceptible color shifts, and also provides plausible reasons for those few conditions where identification thresholds are significantly higher than discrimination thresholds...|$|R

25|$|A {{standard}} <b>illuminant</b> is {{a theoretical}} source of visible light with a profile (its spectral power distribution) which is published. Standard illuminants {{provide a basis}} for comparing images or colors recorded under different lighting.|$|E
25|$|The {{reflective}} and transmissive {{cases are}} very similar to the emissive case, with a few differences. The spectral radiance Le,Ω,λ is replaced by the spectral reflectance (or transmittance) S(λ) of the object being measured, multiplied by the spectral power distribution of the <b>illuminant</b> I(λ).|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, they {{do provide}} a measure, called the Metamerism Index, {{to assess the}} quality of {{daylight}} simulators. The Metamerism Index tests how well five sets of metameric samples match under the test and reference <b>illuminant.</b> In {{a manner similar to}} the color rendering index, the average difference between the metamers is calculated.|$|E
50|$|Although {{there is}} {{generally}} no one-to-one correspondence between <b>illuminants</b> and white points, {{in the case}} of the CIE D-series standard <b>illuminants,</b> the spectral power distributions are mathematically derivable from the chromaticity coordinates of the corresponding white points.|$|R

40|$|This study {{describes}} a novel spectral LED-based tunable light source used for customized lighting solutions, {{especially for the}} reconstruction of CIE (Commission Internationale de l’Éclairage) standard <b>illuminants.</b> The light source comprises 31 spectral bands ranging from 400 to 700 nm, an integrating cube and a control board with a 16 -bit resolution. A minimization algorithm to calculate the weighting values for each channel was applied to reproduce <b>illuminants</b> with precision. The differences in spectral fitting and colorimetric parameters showed that the reconstructed spectra were comparable to the standard, especially for the D 65, D 50, A and E <b>illuminants.</b> Accurate results were also obtained for <b>illuminants</b> with narrow peaks such as fluorescents (F 2 and F 11) and a high-pressure sodium lamp (HP 1). In conclusion, the developed spectral LED-based light source and the minimization algorithm are able to reproduce any CIE standard <b>illuminants</b> with a high spectral and colorimetric accuracy able to advance available custom lighting systems useful in the industry and other fields such as museum lighting.

25|$|The CRI {{can also}} be {{theoretically}} derived from the SPD of the <b>illuminant</b> and samples since physical copies of the original color samples are difficult to find. In this method, care {{should be taken to}} use a sampling resolution fine enough to capture spikes in the SPD. The SPDs of the standard test colors are tabulated in 5nm increments , so it is suggested to use interpolation up to the resolution of the illuminant's spectrophotometry.|$|E
25|$|To {{deal with}} the problem of having to compare light sources of {{different}} correlated color temperatures (CCT), the CIE settled on using a reference black body with the same color temperature for lamps with a CCT of under 5000K, or a phase of CIE standard <b>illuminant</b> D (daylight) otherwise. This presented a continuous range of color temperatures to choose a reference from. Any chromaticity difference between the source and reference illuminants were to be abridged with a von Kries-type chromatic adaptation transform.|$|E
25|$|A rare {{variety of}} natural sapphire, known as color-change sapphire, {{exhibits}} different colors in different light. Color change sapphires are blue in outdoor light and purple under incandescent indoor light, or green to gray-green in daylight and pink to reddish-violet in incandescent light. Color change sapphires {{come from a}} variety of locations, including Thailand and Tanzania. The color-change effect is caused by the interaction of the sapphire, which absorbs specific wavelengths of light, and the light-source, whose spectral output varies depending upon the <b>illuminant.</b> Transition-metal impurities in the sapphire, such as chromium and vanadium, are responsible for the color change.|$|E

25|$|CRI merely {{measures}} the faithfulness of any <b>illuminant</b> to an ideal source {{with the same}} CCT, but the ideal source itself may not render colors well if it has an extreme color temperature, {{due to a lack}} of energy at either short or long wavelengths (i.e., it may be excessively blue or red). Weight the result by the ratio of the gamut area of the polygon formed by the fifteen samples in CIELAB for 6500nbsp&K to the gamut area for the test source. 6500nbsp&K is chosen for reference since it has a relatively even distribution of energy over the visible spectrum and hence high gamut area. This normalizes the multiplication factor.|$|E
25|$|Electric {{lighting}} started displacing kerosene as an <b>illuminant</b> in {{the late}} 19th century, especially in urban areas. However, kerosene remained the predominant commercial end-use for petroleum refined in the United States until 1909, when it was exceeded by motor fuels. The rise of the gasoline-powered automobile in the early 20th century created a demand for the lighter hydrocarbon fractions, and refiners invented methods to increase the output of gasoline, while decreasing the output of kerosene. In addition, some of the heavier hydrocarbons that previously went into kerosene were incorporated into diesel fuel. Kerosene kept some market share by being increasingly used in stoves and portable heaters.|$|E
25|$|The vaporized {{oil burner}} {{was invented in}} 1901 by Arthur Kitson, and {{improved}} by David Hood at Trinity House. The fuel was vaporized at high pressure and burned to heat the mantle, giving an output of over six times the luminosity of traditional oil lights. The use of gas as <b>illuminant</b> became widely available with {{the invention of the}} Dalén light by Swedish engineer, Gustaf Dalén. He used Agamassan (Aga), a substrate, to absorb the gas allowing safe storage and hence commercial exploitation. Dalén also invented the 'sun valve', which automatically regulated the light and turned it off during the daytime. The technology was the predominant form of light source in lighthouses from the 1900s through the 1960s, when electric lighting had become dominant.|$|E

500|$|Clayton's {{findings}} did {{not have}} any practical application {{until the end of the}} 18th century. The gas produced during the coking of coal was allowed to escape unused until William Murdoch began to promote coal gas as an <b>illuminant.</b> Other such experiments, though limited in depth, had been done by: George Dixon in 1780 in Cockfield, Jean-Pierre Minckelers in 1785 in Louvain, and Archibald Cochrane in 1787 at his estate Culross Abbey. The true prototypes for later gasworks were first constructed in 1802 at the Soho Foundry and in 1805 at George Lee's cotton mill in Salford close to Manchester. However innovative the new technology, it was met with great skepticism by many critics. As late as 1810 Murdock was asked in a committee of the House of Commons: [...] "Do you mean to tell us that it will be possible to have a light without a wick?" [...] Not until the second decade of the 19th century did gaslight spread from industrial mills to urban street lighting and domestic lighting. Accum played a crucial role in this unfolding revolution.|$|E
