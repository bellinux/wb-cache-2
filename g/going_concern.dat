5|$|The canal {{gradually}} became clogged with weed, and the railway took {{much of the}} trade. Between 1870 and 1874, income dropped from £2,500 to £1,700. Three years later, the Bristol and Exeter Railway merged with the Great Western Railway. The new owners were remote, and {{were more interested in}} the water supply for Taunton station and for the Bridgwater Dock, than running the canal as a <b>going</b> <b>concern,</b> with the result that the canal deteriorated further. The Conservators continued their annual inspections, but had little hope of any improvements being made.|$|E
5|$|The Alford {{area was}} one of the largest medical {{practices}} in the United Kingdom, and in the winter months Forbes often had to travel through ten-foot snowdrifts in a converted Universal Carrier. These conditions were not entirely unfamiliar; a trip to see an uncle in St. Moritz at the age of thirteen had led to him taking up skiing and figure-skating, and winning a number of bob sled races. He did not live in Alford, but remained at Brux, appointing a medical assistant to live in the town. The farm, left {{in the hands of a}} small resident staff, quickly ran into financial troubles. To raise a large amount of money quickly, Forbes sold the practice in Alford, and returned to the farm in 1952, running it directly as a <b>going</b> <b>concern</b> from then on.|$|E

Commons begins with collective action captured in dynamic <b>going</b> <b>concerns</b> rather than individual choice. Individuals operating in <b>going</b> <b>concerns</b> have power to attempt to shape institutional reform. These actions are driven by expectations or futurity. Since different <b>going</b> <b>concerns</b> compete to influence institutional reform, conflict rather than harmony is the essential nature of economic inquiry. Rationing transactions guided by due process are necessary to create order based on mutuality. This is the search for reasonable value. collective action, expectations, causation,...|$|R

25|$|New {{industries}} {{emerged from}} the 16th century onwards. The woodlands had {{been a source of}} firewood for London during the mediaeval period. A small-scale woodenware industry; making shovels, brooms, spoons and chairs, began around 1538 and its expansion was accompanied by the planting of beechwoods between 17th and 19th centuries. Straw plaiting was seen as home-based work for the wives and daughters of labourers from the 18th century. Straw was also imported from Italy to produce the superior 'Tuscan plait' traded at a Saturday market for the Luton and Dunstable hat trade and remained the major cottage industry until around 1860, providing employment for women and girls some of whom attended a 'plait-school' in Waterside. Lace making developed in the 16th century as a cottage industry and was valued for its quality. Chesham specialised in black lace. The industry declined in the 1850s due to mechinisation in Nottingham. Between 1838 and 1864 silk-spinning, powered by a steam-driven mill in Waterside was started to make use of unemployed lace workers. This trend was relatively short-lived as changes in fashion and the growth of the railways resulted in competition from elsewhere for the valuable London markets. However one exception was the firm of George Tutill, which specialised in high-quality banners and was responsible for three-quarters of those made for trade unions. The firm is still a <b>going</b> <b>concern</b> still specialising in flags and banners.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} applies heterodox {{concepts of}} the social construction and allocation of resources in the provisioning process; the organization of <b>going</b> <b>concerns</b> in societies that are themselves going concerns; and the governance of markets, and production more generally, toward a heterodox theory of the firm. It is argued that, in contrast to extant theories of the firm, the boundaries of modern firms are {{not the result of}} processes of individual contracting in the face of transactions costs, or coterminous with knowledge-based resources. Rather, they are principally the product of the coevolution of business and technological practices, chiefly {{in the interest of the}} former over the latter. It is furthermore argued that this process, in a socioeconomic system defined by the firm as a hierarchy of <b>going</b> <b>concerns,</b> is more akin to the gerrymandering of congressional districts than to an efficient allocation of material transactions between the firm and market spheres. The history of the US software industry from the 1950 s through the 1990 s is provided as a case both illustrating and informing the theory. In particular, it is shown that this industry owes its structure, and indeed its existence, to the evolution of business strategies concerning th...|$|R
