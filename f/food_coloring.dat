40|$|Effects of {{some natural}} <b>food</b> <b>colors</b> on {{isolated}} rat hepatocytes were examined. Incubation of isolated hepatocytes {{with the natural}} <b>food</b> <b>colors</b> at concentrations of 100 and 1000 μg/ml for 2 -hr period resulted in a slight decrease of cell viability; over {{fifty percent of the}} hepatocytes survived beyond 2 hr, and over ten percent survived even at the concentration as high as 10000 μg/ml. Conversely, when the hepatocytes were incubated in the presence of artificial food dyes, the viability was decreased very rapidly, and viable cells could not be found after 2 hr. Natural <b>food</b> <b>colors</b> scarcely inhibited oxygen uptake in isolated hepatocytes at the concentration of 250 μg/ml.

5|$|Kanafeh is {{the most}} famed Nabulsi sweet.

5|$|One scene {{involved}} a burning head, {{which was created}} by taking a cast of the actor's face, head and body with a plaster, then placing soft rubber over the cast to simulate human flesh. It was also treated so it did not release black smoke like a rubber tire when it burned. For burn effects placed on the body after the fire, the crew made a sculpture of the wounds, then mounted them onto rubber appliances, which were glued to the actor. For Harriet's death scene, in which she is scalped and her brain is visible, makeup artist Cindy Jordan put a cap over actress V. Joy Lee's head and covered it with mortician's wax {{to make it look}} bumpy. Another special effect {{involved a}} spirit that appears in the form of ectoplasm during a séance. It was created from cellulose, water and green <b>food</b> <b>coloring.</b> It proved difficult to make, and several attempts were made before the right consistency was achieved. To create the appearance of it coming out of actress V. Joy Lee's mouth, an eight-foot long hose was attached to the side of her face. Project manager Mark Seibert had to suck the fake ectoplasm through the hose to get it in, then during filming he spit it out. It took several shots before the take was successful, and it looked so funny during filming that the crew kept laughing during takes.|$|E

MethodsDisc shaped samples of five types of light curing composite (A 2) (n= 10 samples/composite) were prepared and all samples were light-cured with a Plasma Arc light cure unit for ten seconds. One side of each sample disc was finished and polished with a Super-Snap system all samples. After 24 h, color measurements of each sample were conducted using a digital spectrophotometer. Five sample discs from each composite group were immersed in 30 ml of <b>food</b> <b>color</b> solution for 7 and 21 days, while the remaining five sample discs were immersed in 30 ml of distilled water as a control. Color measurements were repeated for all samples at 7 and 21 days after immersion. The color changes were statistically analyzed using t-tests within the same group. A result was considered statistically significant at α= 0. 05. ResultsThe color differences (ΔE) ranged from 0. 4 to 4. 66 and statistically significant differences on the finished and unfinished surfaces were observed after immersion in the <b>food</b> <b>color</b> solution for 7 days. No significant differences were found in any group after immersion in the <b>food</b> <b>color</b> solution for 21 days. The Tetric EvoCeram and Arabesk groups showed less color differences after 7 and 21 days than other composites.

25|$|In plants, algae, {{and other}} {{photosynthetic}} organisms, lycopene {{is an important}} intermediate in the biosynthesis of many carotenoids, including beta-carotene, {{which is responsible for}} yellow, orange, or red pigmentation, photosynthesis, and photoprotection. Like all carotenoids, lycopene is a polyunsaturated hydrocarbon, i.e. an unsubstituted alkene. Structurally, lycopene is a tetraterpene and assembled from eight isoprene units that are composed entirely of carbon and hydrogen. It is insoluble in water. Lycopene's eleven conjugated double bonds give its deep red color and its antioxidant activity in vitro. Owing to the strong color, lycopene is a useful <b>food</b> <b>coloring</b> (registered as E160d) and is approved for usage in the USA, Australia and New Zealand (registered as 160d) and the EU.|$|E
25|$|The {{most heavily}} studied betalain is betanin, also called {{beetroot}} red {{after the fact}} that it may be extracted from red beet roots. Betanin is a glucoside, and hydrolyzes into the sugar glucose and betanidin. It is used as a <b>food</b> <b>coloring</b> agent, and the color is sensitive to pH. Other betalains known to occur in beets are isobetanin, probetanin, and neobetanin. The color and antioxidant capacity of betanin and indicaxanthin (betaxanthin derived of L-proline) are affected by dielectric microwave heating. Addition of TFE (2,2,2-trifluoroethanol) is reported to improve the hydrolytic stability of some betalains in aqueous solution. Furthermore, a betanin-europium(III) complex has been used to detect calcium dipicolinate in bacterial spores, including Bacillus anthracis and B. cereus.|$|E
