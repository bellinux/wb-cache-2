50|$|Older gamma-ray {{detectors}} use the <b>Geiger-Mueller</b> <b>counter</b> principle, {{but have}} been mostly replaced thallium-doped sodium-iodide (NaI) scintillation detector, which has a higher efficiency. NaI detectors are usually composed of a NaI crystal coupled with a photomultiplier. When gamma ray from formation enters the crystal, it undergoes successive collisions with the atoms of the crystal, resulting in a short flashes of light when the gamma-ray is absorbed. The light is detected by the photomultiplier, which converts the energy into an electric pulse with amplitude proportional to the gamma-ray energy. The number of electric pulses is recorded in counts per seconds (CPS). The higher the gamma-ray count rate, the larger the clay content and vice versa.|$|E
40|$|A {{precision}} built moveable endplate <b>Geiger-Mueller</b> <b>counter</b> {{was used}} to measure the absolute disintegration rate of a beta-emitting radioactive gas. A <b>Geiger-Mueller</b> <b>counter</b> used for measuring gaseous radioactivity has < 100 % counting efficiency owing to two factors: (1) ''end effect, '' due to decreased and distorted fields at the ends where wire-insulator joints are placed, and (2) ''wall effect, '' due to non-ionization by beta particles emitted near to and heading into the wall. The end effect was evaluated by making one end of the counter movable and measuring counting rates at a number of endplate positions. Much of the wall effect was calculated theoretically, based on known data for primary ionization of electrons as a function of energy and gas composition. Corrections were then made for the ''shakeoff'' effect in beta decay and for backscattering of electrons from the counter wall. Measurements and calculations were made for a sample of krypton- 85 (beta energy, 0. 67 MeV). The wall effect calculation is readily extendable to other beta energies...|$|E

One method of obtaining low energy electron measurements is to fit <b>Geiger-Mueller</b> <b>counters</b> with extremely thin windows and to fill them with appropriate low-pressure mixtures, using them in spectrometers in much the same manner as their more rugged counterparts.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the Physics Institute of via Panisperna in Rome, getting ready for {{investigation}} on neutron physics before Fermi's discovery of neutron-induced radioactivity. The importance of nuclear research had been acknowledged in the Physics Institute in Rome since 1929.

An adjustment of the equipment and supplies was undertaken, so that strong radioactive sources, <b>Geiger-Mueller</b> <b>counters</b> and Wilson chambers were finally available at the end of 1933, thanks largely to Rasetti's efforts.

40|$|It {{is pointed}} out that most {{advances}} of cosmic-ray physics have been {{directly related to the}} development of observational techniques. A review is presented {{of the history of the}} evolution of the techniques and equipment for the study of cosmic-ray physics, taking into account the new scientific advances accompanying each new development related to experimental technology. All of the early observations were performed by means of ionization chambers. These chambers had already been in use for a number of years, when they were first applied to the study of cosmic rays in the early years of this century. However, an application to the low-intensity cosmic radiation required special refinements.

Data on Rospotrebnadzor bodies dosimetry equipment used for measurement of gamma radiation dose are collected and systematized. Over  60 kinds of dosimeters are used for monitoring of population external irradiation doses. Most of dosimeters used in the country have gas-discharge detectors (<b>Geiger-Mueller</b> <b>counters,</b> minor biochemical annunciators, etc.) which have higher total values of own background level and of space radiation response than the modern dosimeters with scintillation detectors. This feature of dosimeters is apparently one of most plausible reasons of a bit overstating assessment of population external irradiation doses. The options for specification of population external irradiation doses assessment are: correction of gamma radiation dose measurement results with consideration of dosimeters own background level and space radiation response, introduction of more up-to-date dosimeters with scintillation detectors, etc. The most promising direction of research in verification of population external irradiation doses assessment is account of dosimetry equipment. </p...|$|R

Radiation {{is defined as}} ?energy transmitted through space as waves or particles? and also determined as ?particles or waves emitted from the nucleus of unstable radioactive atoms to become stable? Mainly two types of radiation are exist; ionising radiation and non-ionising radiation. Ionising radiation is consist of alpha, beta particules, neutrons, x rays and gamma rays. Ionising radiation which can be measured by ion chambers, <b>geiger-Mueller</b> detectors, Scintillation <b>Counters,</b> fluorescent counters etc. Has harmfull effects on human health in levels of molecular, cellular, tissue, organs and organ systems.

40|$|An {{irradiation}} {{facility and}} {{the characteristics of}} the measurement devices are described that are capable to determine the absorbed dose to water in an intense mixed neutronphoton field. The collimated irradiation field of the PTB has a diameter of approximately 40 mm and is generated with the cyclotron beam via the d(E_d = 13. 3 MeV) +Be reaction. A water absorbed dose rate of up to 15 mGy/s at a distance of 585 mm from the neutron source can be achieved. The absolute absorbed dose to water is determined with a calorimeter with an uncertainty of less than 2. 5 %. The water calorimeter is transportable and can be used at the customer's site. A tissue-equivalent ionisation chamber is applied as a secondary standard instrument. The photon dose of the mixed field is determined with a <b>Geiger-Mueller</b> <b>counter.</b> An open-to-air ionisation chamber with an active volume of 0. 125 cm" 3 and made from polymethyl methacrylate is connected to a flexible hose and is operated in a water phantom.

40|$|Introduction: The {{ionizing}} radiation is increasingly applied in various fields for industrial and medical purposes {{due to its}} benefits. The {{aim of this study}} was to measure the radiation levels in six radiology departments of two educational hospitals in Ahvaz, Iran. Materials and Methods: The radiation levels were measured at six locations of six radiology departments, including behind the patient observation window, staff rest room, office, patient waiting room, behind the door of the X-ray room, and outdoor. These measurements were carried out while the X-ray equipment was in on and off status, using the halogen-quenched <b>Geiger-Mueller</b> <b>counter.</b> Results: According to the results, the range of radiation levels inside the radiology departments at X-ray units with on/off status were 0. 36 ± 0. 12 to 0. 09 ± 0. 02 µSv/h and 0. 13 ± 0. 02 to 0. 09 ± 0. 03 µSv/h, respectively. Furthermore, significant differences were observed between the indoor and outdoor radiation levels in all locations.   Conclusion: As the findings indicated, the surveyed X-ray equipment in the radiology departments of two educational hospitals was safe. The radiation dose levels were within the safe recommended limits in all locations except two points due to some structural problems, which were recognized and would be corrected as soon as possible...|$|E
40|$|During 1972 and 1973 a {{study was}} {{conducted}} in the B-C Cribs, 200 East Area, to learn the extent to which jackrabbits (Lepus californicus) and their predators had dispersed buried radioactive wastes in their fecal pellets and scats. The specific objective was to gather sufficient data on the pattern of dispersal so that statistically valid sampling strategies could be developed in future programs, depending upon management planning objectives for the area. A secondary objective was to relate these data with parameters, such as topography, wind direction, vegetation types, animal behavior, that might help explain the pattern of dispersal. In 1972, 2625 circular sampling sites were surveyed along 30 transects radiating out 2. 4 to 3. 2 km from the B-C Cribs. Radioactive contaminated feces, urine, soil and vegetation were distributed in all directions from the cribs, but the area to the south and southwest was more densely and uniformly contaminated. Of the ultimate sampling units surveyed, 278 or 10. 6 % had activity in excess o f 10, 000 counts per minute (cprn) measured with a <b>Geiger-Mueller</b> <b>counter.</b> Of these 278 circular areas, 179 or 64 % were found within 0. 5 km of the cribs, 23. 4 % were between 0. 5 and 1. 0 km, and the remaining 12. 2 % were further than 1 km from the central point. Although most droppings with a count rate greater than 20, 000 cpm were found within 400 meters of the crib, pellets registering in excess of 100, 000 cprn were found up to 1. 6 km from the cribs. The pellets appeared to be distributed into the prevailing wind directions and contrary to the immediate contours: the only correlation seemed to be with increased vegetation density to the south and southwest, vegetation that is prime jackrabbit habitat. In May-June, 1973, 48 additional transects were run: 7 were parallel to lines established in the B-C Crib Area during 1972; 18 radiated from an abandoned gun battery site 3. 2 km east of the cribs; and 23 were run from power lines 5 km south to southwest of the cribs back towards the source of contamination. No contaminated jackrabbit pellets were found at these distances, but one contaminated coyote scat was found near the gun battery site. During 1972 and 1973 field crews walked 106. 7 km along 78 radii and recorded observations on 6671 ultimate sampling units of approximately 1. 4 m{sup 2 }...|$|E
