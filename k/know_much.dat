5|$|Before {{the start}} of the Browns' 1954 {{training}} camp, Graham was questioned as part of the Sam Sheppard murder case. Sheppard, an osteopath, was accused of bludgeoning his pregnant wife to death, and Graham and his wife, Beverly, were friends with the couple. Graham told police that while he and Beverly liked the Sheppards, they did not <b>know</b> <b>much</b> about their relationship.|$|E
5|$|Bramatyo {{cast his}} wife, Zaskia Adya Mecca, as Ahmad Dahlan's wife Siti Walidah— Mecca {{also served as}} casting director, in charge of auditioning the {{supporting}} cast. Before filming began, Mecca attempted to research the biographies of Dahlan and his wife, as she and the other young actors did not <b>know</b> <b>much</b> about the couple. However, she found such research difficult as the libraries {{did not have the}} information she needed.|$|E
5|$|I was {{of course}} happy to meet the Hizbullah people, {{because it is a}} point of view that is rarely heard in the United States. I have no problem saying that I do want to express {{solidarity}} with them, and I am {{not going to be a}} coward of (sic) a hypocrite about it. I don't care about Hizbullah as a political organization. I don't <b>know</b> <b>much</b> about their politics, and anyhow, it's irrelevant. I don't live in Lebanon. It's a choice that the Lebanese have to make: Who they want to be their leaders, who they want to represent them. But there is a fundamental principle. People have the right to defend their country from foreign occupiers, and people have the right to defend their country from invaders who are destroying their country. That to me is a very basic, elementary and uncomplicated question.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Tom (Aziz Ansari) asks Andy (Chris Pratt), April (Aubrey Plaza), Jerry (Jim O'Heir) and Donna (Retta) to {{participate}} in a new game show called Know Ya Boo, that he is hoping to pitch to networks; he admits that it is a rip-off of The Newlywed Game. It quickly becomes clear that Jerry and Donna <b>know</b> <b>much</b> more about each other than the recently married Andy and April. When April reveals her favorite band is Neutral Milk Hotel and not Andy's band Mouse Rat, Andy angrily leaves the game and they later have a big fight which causes him to quit his music. April seeks advice from Ann because, although she dislikes her, Ann previously dated Andy for several years. Ann tells April she has to be supportive of Andy no matter how she feels. The next day, April brings the other members of Mouse Rat to city hall and surprises Andy by singing one of his songs. A thrilled Andy reconciles with April.|$|E
5|$|Kerrigan {{returns in}} StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty (2010). At BlizzCon 2007, Chris Metzen {{explained}} {{that in the}} years after Brood War, Kerrigan relocated to Char, pulling back most of the Zerg, and has since been quiet. She has the power to wipe out all her enemies but has not, creating a tense state of peace in the sector. Metzen also indicated an interest in exploring if there was any humanity left in Kerrigan or if she is beyond redemption in her current state. He revealed that Kerrigan's withdrawal {{has little to do with}} any suspicion she has of Duran, who is revealed towards the end of Brood War to be conducting secret experiments on creating a Protoss/Zerg hybrid; she does not <b>know</b> <b>much</b> about him, but in the time after Brood War, she is beginning to piece together the puzzle surrounding his motives. At BlizzCon 2008, Kerrigan made two brief appearances in cinematic trailers, one during an attack on a Terran city that was captured on video, and again in a series of caverns where Zeratul was studying ancient runes; in the latter, Kerrigan implies she has been waiting for his arrival.|$|E

25|$|Herodotus, Strabo, {{and other}} {{classical}} authors repeatedly mention the Caspians {{but do not}} seem to <b>know</b> <b>much</b> about them; they are grouped with other inhabitants of the southern shore of the Caspian Sea, like the Amardi, Anariacae, Cadusii, Albani (see below), and Vitii (Eratosthenes apud Strabo, 11.8.8), and their land (Caspiane) is said to be part of Albania (Theophanes Mytilenaeus apud Strabo, 11.4.5).|$|E
25|$|Since {{scientists}} cannot <b>know</b> <b>much</b> {{about the}} internal mechanisms of extinct creatures, most discussion focuses on homeothermy and tachymetabolism. However, {{it is generally}} agreed that endothermy first evolved in non-mammalian synapsids such as dicynodonts, which possess body proportions associated with heat retention, high vascularised bones with Haversian canals, and possibly hair. More recently, {{it has been suggested}} that endothermy evolved as far back as Ophiacodon.|$|E

25|$|However, Garfield {{won over}} two Industrial Indemnity executives, Harold Hatch and Alonzo B. Ordway. It was Hatch who {{proposed}} to Garfield the specific solution {{that would lead}} to the creation of Kaiser Permanente: Industrial Indemnity would prepay 17.5% of premiums, or $1.50 per worker per month, to cover work-related injuries, while the workers would each contribute five cents per day to cover non-work-related injuries. Later, Garfield also credited Ordway with coming up with the general idea of prepayment for industrial healthcare. Garfield also later explained that he did not <b>know</b> <b>much</b> at the time about other similar health plans except for the Ross-Loos Medical Group.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} sets of competencies for different specializations within I/O psychology and I/O psychologists are versatile behavioral scientists. For example, an I/O psychologist specializing in selection and recruiting should have expertise in finding the best talent for the organization and getting everyone on board while {{he or she might}} not need to <b>know</b> <b>much</b> about executive coaching. Some I/O psychologists specialize in specific areas of consulting whereas others tend to generalize their areas of expertise. There are basic skills and knowledge an individual needs in order to be an effective I/O psychologist, which include being an independent learner, interpersonal skills (e.g., listening skills), and general consultation skills (e.g., skills and knowledge in the problem area).|$|E
25|$|In the Japanese {{version of}} every Dragon Ball anime series and {{subsequent}} related media, Goku has been voiced by Masako Nozawa. Toriyama selected Nozawa upon hearing her audition sample, remarking that only Goku could sound like that. Nozawa stated {{that she was}} ecstatic when she got the role because she {{had always wanted to}} be in one of Toriyama's works. She said she had to be mindful of the fact that Goku grew up in the mountains and did not <b>know</b> <b>much</b> of the world. Despite having to voice Goku, Gohan, Goten and Burdock, Nozawa claims she is able to instantly get into the respective character simply upon seeing their image. Nozawa explained that she did not read the manga so that she would not know what was coming in the story until recording, making her reactions the same as Goku's.|$|E

25|$|A {{majority}} of the people along the San Joaquin River and its tributaries lived in small bands or tribes, which had no distinguishing names. Villages were small and usually the size of camps, rarely numbering more than a few hundred inhabitants. The Miwok, for example, rarely traveled more than a few miles from their home villages, and as such the inhabitants of one village would not <b>know</b> <b>much</b> of the surrounding country beyond the neighboring villages. The staple food for San Joaquin Valley inhabitants was the acorn, which when ground, could be made into various foods such as cakes. Grinding the acorns was a simple process where they crushed the nuts using rocks in natural granite depressions. Many of the surviving examples of acorn milling areas can still be found in the foothills, especially around the Kaweah River area.|$|E
25|$|Helena Lopata {{argued that}} a Polish {{nationalism}} grew in Polish Americans during World War I, but fell sharply afterward. Polish immigrants to the United States did not <b>know</b> <b>much</b> about Poland aside from their local villages. In preparation for World War I, the Polish government asked for donations using appeals {{on behalf of the}} safety of their loved ones back home, as well as promises of a good high status back in Poland when they returned home. Lopata found that after World War I, many Polish Americans continued to receive requests for aid in Poland, and feelings of anger for all the years they had delayed bettering their own situation were common. Return immigrants who had dreamed of using their American savings to buy status symbols in Poland (farmlands, houses, etc.) were still treated as peasants in Poland, creating resentment towards the motherland.|$|E
25|$|Ardashir had an {{outstanding}} {{role in developing}} the royal ideology. He tried to show himself as a worshiper of Mazda related to god and possessing khvarenah. The claim of the legitimacy of his reign as a rightful newcomer from {{the line of the}} mythical Iranian shahs and the propagations attributed to Ardashir against the legitimacy and role of the Parthians in the Iranian history sequence show the valuable place that the Achaemenid legacy had {{in the minds of the}} first Sasanian shahanshahs; though the current belief is that the Sasanians did not <b>know</b> <b>much</b> about the Achaemenids and their status. On the other hand, some historians believe that the first Sasanian shahanshahs were familiar with the Achaemenids and their succeeding shahanshahs deliberately turned to the Kayanians. They knowingly ignored the Achaemenids in order to attribute their past to the Kayanians; and that was where they applied holy historiography.|$|E

25|$|Through {{his wife}} Eleanor, {{he had come}} to <b>know</b> <b>much</b> about Ireland and {{especially}} Northern Ireland. She came from the Protestant plantation community of Ulster, originating largely in south-western Scotland. Presumably because of this knowledge, Davis was in 1985 induced by Sir David Wills into a project in historical education, to be financed by the Wills Trust, to encourage better understanding between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, and presumably between Catholics and Protestants in the North. Davis recruited teachers, school inspectors and academics to serve on a committee to frame a curriculum of Irish history which would be acceptable to schools in both North and South. The committee oversaw the writing of the Questions in Irish History series of history books. The Teaching of History Trust has continued to work long afterwards, sponsored by Longman. The first volumes of the series are dedicated to Ralph Davis' memory. He was still actively working for peace in Northern Ireland when he died.|$|E

"We {{had been}} {{covering}} the violence and politics in Swat in detail but we didn't <b>know</b> <b>much</b> about how ordinary people lived under the Taliban", said Mirza Waheed, the former editor of BBC Urdu.

Her blog was published under the byline [...] "Gul Makai" [...] ("cornflower" [...] in Urdu), a name taken from a character in a Pashtun folktale.|$|E
500|$|In {{defending}} himself {{from what he}} believed was the elitism of his online critics, Idol admitted {{that he was still}} learning about computers, but compared it to the early punk ethic of simply trying your best as a musician, even if you had difficulty. He also pointed out that William Gibson was computer illiterate when he wrote Neuromancer.
