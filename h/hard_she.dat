25|$|Coup d'Etat was a {{breakthrough}} album {{that began to}} blend the punk and metal genres, something that would later be done {{time and time again}} by bands such as S.O.D., Anthrax, and the Cro-Mags {{by the end of the}} 1980s. Wendy also broke ground for her unique singing style. She pushed her vocals so <b>hard</b> <b>she</b> had to make trips into Cologne, Germany, where the album was being recorded, each day for treatments to avoid permanent damage to her vocal cords.|$|E
25|$|Author and {{reporter}} Richard M. Levine {{later wrote}} that compared to Marlene Olive, Riley did not harbor much anger at Naomi Olive, whom he barely knew, and therefore Riley {{would be less}} likely to use a method of homicide suggesting rage; that Riley would have used his loaded gun as the weapon rather than a hammer; and that Marlene Olive had previously asked Riley how <b>hard</b> <b>she</b> would have to hit Naomi Olive in order to kill her. However, others have noted that Marlene had no blood on her clothing when she left the house and would not have had time to change clothes; that Riley used a hammer to avoid alerting neighbors because it made less noise than a gunshot; and that according to a hypnosis expert, Riley's revised confession lacked credibility. Marlene Olive continued to maintain that Riley had beaten and killed her mother in addition to shooting her father, and denied that she herself had any part in the killing of either parent.|$|E
25|$|Once {{a devoted}} and bright faerie, she {{questioned}} the King {{as to why}} a faerie like herself was not permitted to visit him as often and freely as Oran. The King responds by saying that she and Oran are different by birth, and faery as lowly as Seraphina can not possibly compare herself with Oran. This left Seraphina jealous and determine to best Oran, {{no matter what it}} took, and constantly strove towards what ever goal Oran was headed to. She tricks Oran into staying on Earth by ordering Goodfellow to lead Sindo to the bathing spring, then altering the barrier that was supposed to hide them from humans so that Oran's gown was exposed for stealing. Seraphina uses the opportunity to achieve her ambitions and become the Queen of Avalon. Unfortunately, she is rejected again and again by the King, who constantly reminds Seraphina that no matter how <b>hard</b> <b>she</b> works, even after she becomes a 1st class faerie, she will never compare to Oran because Seraphina simply tries too hard to be something Oran comes by naturally. When Pain and Fanta arrive in Avalon, Seraphina appears again to eliminate Pain only to find that he is powerful enough to detect her spells with ease. Oreadia eventually masterminds Seraphina's downfall by using Fanta, Pain, and Syndra; Seraphina is punished for her attempt to get rid of Oreadia and reborn as a human on earth who would remember her heavenly origins only when she turned fifteen.|$|E

500|$|An American admirer {{described}} her as [...] "ruling {{over a little}} kingdom of three thousand loving subjects with an iron scepter twined with roses." [...] Although Hill drove her associates <b>hard,</b> <b>she</b> drove herself harder. In 1877, she collapsed and {{had to take a}} break of several months from her work. Darley ascribes a number of contributory causes: [...] "chronic overwork, a lack of delegation, the death of her close friend Jane Senior, the failure of a brief engagement", as well as an attack on her by John Ruskin. The Hill family found a companion for her, Harriot Yorke (1843–1930). Yorke took on a great amount of the everyday work that had caused Hill's collapse. She remained her companion until Hill's death. [...] A further palliative was the building of a cottage, at Crockham Hill near Sevenoaks in Kent, where they could take breaks from their work in London.|$|E
500|$|Prefix {{magazines}} Craig Jenkins found [...] "retro-leaning flourishes and propulsive boom bap {{in equal}} measure" [...] in [...] "Rather Die Young". Likewise, Cameron Adams of the Herald Sun wrote that [...] "Rather Die Young" [...] is a [...] "boundary-pushing backdrop of 1970s soul dragged into tomorrow", further describing it as bizarre but brilliant. Mikael Wood of Spin magazine {{described it as}} a slow-to-bloom song which is [...] "preoccupied by love's pleasure". Ben Cardew of Music Week described [...] "Rather Die Young" [...] as a drum-heavy and gloomy ballad accompanied by a lovely melody. Jocelyn Vena of MTV News described the ballad as having an old-school vibe and commended how [...] "instead of going <b>hard,</b> <b>she</b> [...] keeps the music soft" [...] Robert Copsey of the British entertainment and media news website Digital Spy noted similarities between [...] "Rather Die Young" [...] and Beyoncé's older material.|$|E
500|$|The {{concept of}} the music video was a joint {{collaboration}} between Gaga and Lawrence. Originally, the video {{was going to be}} shot in New York City, with more elaborate sets, including sets outdoors. The idea was scrapped, however, for budgetary reasons: [...] the budget for the video was low and there was no product placement. Because of Gaga's schedule, the video was shot in Los Angeles over a two-day period. Lawrence described Gaga's work ethic and creativity during the video shoot: [...] "She loves the art form of music videos and she is a real creative partner and has great ideas and really cool and unique tastes. She has a great team working with her as well, helping build really fantastic things that she wears. She works <b>hard,</b> <b>she</b> shows up on time and she's pretty spontaneous ... it was great ... if she had a new song and wanted to do something, I would do it in a second. She was really fun to work with." ...|$|E
5000|$|According to [...] "Backstairs At the White House" [...] {{by former}} White House {{seamstress}} Lillian Rogers Parks, [...] "A Perfect Day" [...] was the favorite song of First Lady Florence <b>Harding.</b> <b>She</b> often had it played at White House concerts.|$|R

50|$|In {{company with}} three other destroyers, Harding began a running, {{twisting}} battle with the four boats, illuminated by starshell fire, and despite their superior maneuverability, all four were sunk, three by <b>Harding.</b> <b>She</b> brought survivors ashore and resumed her patrol until 24 August.|$|R
500|$|In {{the course}} of her career Wilkinson contributed to reforms in {{numerous}} policy areas: women's equal suffrage, women civil servants' equal pay, provision of air raid shelters for city dwellers, and protection of hire purchase borrowers' rights. The historian David Kynaston cites as her greatest practical achievement her success in meeting the timetable for the raising of the school leaving age; her successor as education minister, George Tomlinson, recorded how <b>hard</b> <b>she</b> had fought to avoid postponement of the reform, and expressed his sorrow that she died before the set date. Wilkinson was sometimes criticised for extending her efforts too widely; a local newspaper, the North Mail, complained in May 1937 that [...] "Miss Wilkinson is working for too many causes to do justice to Jarrow". Nevertheless, her book The Town that was Murdered brought to public notice the plight of Jarrow and the broader consequences of unbridled capitalism on working-class communities; the book, Harrison observes, [...] "educated the nation".|$|E
2500|$|Chisholm has cited Madonna as {{her biggest}} musical influence. She stated: [...] "I think she's {{inspired}} {{me a lot}} musically, and maybe [...] just the way I present myself. I've always admired how <b>hard</b> <b>she</b> works and what a strong lady she is, so she's always inspired me in that way." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{story of}} the album is about Atropos goddess of fate and destiny in Greek mythology, one of the Moirai. The Story goes on when Atropos decided to choose the {{mechanism}} of death instead of mortality and ended their life cutting their thread with her special scissor which they call it [...] "Abhorred Shears". She wasn't all alone in this, her other two sister; Lachesis and Clotho helped her. Clotho {{was the youngest of}} all sisters and Lachesis was the kindest one. But as Atropos was so inevitable and <b>hard</b> <b>she</b> used her power to convince them to help her to destroy mortality.|$|E
60|$|Composure in {{difficult}} circumstances {{was one of}} the characteristics of her family, yet Beatrice felt at a loss. <b>Harding,</b> <b>she</b> thought, was not the man to yield to a passing impulse or transgress from unmeaning effrontery; but this made the shock worse.|$|R
5000|$|Peters {{earned a}} B.S. in Communications from Bridgewater State University in 1987. Between 1992 and 2002, {{she worked for}} the Cape Cod Times.

60|$|The girl went out, {{and soon}} {{collected}} a large bundle, {{and then she}} plucked at a sprig of sweet-smelling rosemary for herself.

2500|$|In one of {{her last}} film roles, The Secret of Santa Vittoria (1969), she co-starred with Anthony Quinn, and they played husband and wife in what Life {{magazine}} called [...] "perhaps the most memorable fight since Jimmy Cagney smashed Mae Clarke {{in the face with}} a half a grapefruit." [...] Magnani and Quinn did feud in private outside view of the cameras, however, and their animosity spilled over into their scenes:"By the time the movie makers were ready to shoot the fight scene, the stars were ready too. Magnani not only went for Quinn with the pasta and with a rolling pin, but with her foot; she kicked so <b>hard</b> <b>she</b> broke a bone in her right foot. She also bit him in the neck. 'That's not in the script', Quinn protested. Magnani snarled, 'I'm supposed to win this fight, remember?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Commenting on Wellington's record, Newby-Fraser said, [...] "But {{the revelation}} I had was {{watching}} how <b>hard</b> <b>she</b> worked for it ... {{and it was}} clear she was going to the well. And I am certain she had to leave a little bit of herself out there to get it done. She didn't take a moment to enjoy until she crossed the line. Part of me was gratified by that. I know what she had to do to get it and I hope she realizes it's not that easy. I know it wasn't that easy for her. A race like that takes a piece of herself out there." [...] A year later her coach Dave Scott revealed that she had an upper hamstring injury and that, [...] "Deep down inside, she had a bit of a struggle in 2009." [...] Even though she had broken the long-standing course record, Scott said, [...] "But I knew, and she knew, and I told her in my ever-candid, callous style, that she didn't have her best day." ...|$|E
2500|$|Time {{magazine}} included Rihanna on its 100 Most Influential People in the World {{issue in}} 2012. Stella McCartney writes [...] "She's {{one of the}} coolest, hottest, most talented, most liked, most listened to, most followed, most impressive artists at work today, but she does it in her own stride. She works hard, very <b>hard.</b> <b>She</b> gives to her fans, friends and foundation not just herself but her energy and spirit." [...] On June 2, 2014, Rihanna was presented with Fashion Icon lifetime achievement award from Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA), a special prize reserved for [...] "an individual whose style has made {{a significant impact on}} popular culture on an international stage". In August 2013, Rihanna is placed at number 13 on Billboards [...] "Greatest Of All Time Hot 100 Artists" [...] list, being its highest ranking newcomer. Billboard also ranked Rihanna the top Hot 100 artist of the 2010s decade. In 2014, Time magazine's pop stardom ranking metric, ranked Rihanna second in history, based on all-time chart performance and contemporary significance.|$|E

It was a rare ballad released by the teenage crooner.|$|R
2500|$|Lệ Xuân's {{education}} at the Lycée Albert Sarraut was entirely in French, and she remembered as a schoolgirl learning about French history and nothing about Vietnamese history and of singing songs about the forests and mountains of France, observing later the purpose of her education was to eradicate any sense of a Vietnamese identity, and to make her into a proper young Frenchwoman. The purpose of French educational policies in Vietnam was always in reference to France's self-proclaimed mission civilisatrice ("civilizing mission") was to make all Vietnamese into [...] "Frenchmen with yellow skin", and thus French teachers tried to stamp out any sense of a Vietnamese identity in their students. The message French teachers taught their students was that to be French was to be [...] "civilized" [...] and to be Vietnamese was to be [...] "uncivilized". She dropped out of Lycée Albert Sarraut, a prestigious French school in Hanoi. She spoke French at home and could not write in Vietnamese; as an adult, she drafted her speeches in French and had them translated into Vietnamese. She gained a reputation in her youth as a tomboy who loved ballet and piano, once dancing solo at Hanoi's National Theatre. She had an elder sister named Trần Lệ Chi (who married the Frenchman Etienne Oggeri and changed her name to Lechi Oggeri) and a younger brother, Trần Văn Khiêm. Like many other Vietnamese, Lệ Xuân was to find {{that no matter how}} <b>hard</b> <b>she</b> tried to be French, that the French were only prepared to accept whites as French.|$|E
2500|$|Sue obsesses {{with the}} idea of having another child but no matter how <b>hard</b> <b>she</b> and Ali try, they cannot conceive. A phantom {{pregnancy}} in May 1986 leaves her heartbroken and she later tries to convince Michelle to let her adopt Michelle's daughter Vicki, culminating in Michelle slapping Sue. In September, Sue begins toying {{with the idea}} of adopting a Turkish child from Cyprus, which is met with indignation from Ali's family. She and Ali decide to apply to adopt in the UK instead. They meet a social worker to assess their suitability; however, their application is rejected because it is felt they are applying too quickly after the death of their child. Sue agonizes over this and in 1987, she faces more turmoil after finding a lump on her breast; she fears she has breast cancer. After much worrying, she is eventually persuaded to get the lump checked out and is subsequently given the all-clear. Later in the year, Sue grows attached to Ali's nephews and niece when they come to stay with her in Walford, and is saddened when they go home several months later. Still unable to conceive, Sue begins to crave a baby more than ever and Ali tires of her eternal broodiness. Sue decides she wants to move to the Isle of Dogs, thinking that the milder climate may increase her chances of conceiving. Ali refuses and in a fury, Sue packs a suitcase and disappears without word. Ali believes she has left him, but Sue is only visiting an old school friend and she returns in October 1987 to announce that she is expecting another baby. In March 1988, she gives birth to another son, [...] "Little Ali", who is delivered by Lofty Holloway (Tom Watt) and Pauline Fowler (Wendy Richard). Sue's desperation to be a good mother means that she often excludes her husband from parental duties. She becomes so obsessed with her baby's welfare that she has no time for Ali and their relationship suffers. Feeling neglected and tired of his wife's nagging, Ali has sex with Donna Ludlow (Matilda Ziegler). However, Donna blackmails Ali, threatening to inform Sue about their tryst unless he pays her regularly. A fearful Ali pays, silencing Donna for a while, but in March 1989 Sue argues with Donna, banning her from the café. In retaliation, Donna informs Sue about the affair. Upset, Sue turns to Ali's brother Mehmet (Haluk Bilginer) for comfort and attempts to kiss an innocent Mehmet in front of Ali for revenge. Believing that Sue is having an affair with his brother, Ali assaults Mehmet then informs Mehmet's wife Guizin (Ishia Bennison) about the fabricated affair, causing the Osman family to fracture. Following threats from Ali, Sue takes their son and leaves Walford.|$|E
