5|$|At {{this time}} though the {{chemical}} {{nature of what}} exactly in the blood conferred this protection was not known. In a few decades to follow, it was shown that the protective serum could neutralize and precipitate toxins, and clump bacteria. All these functions were attributed to different substances in the serum, and named accordingly as antitoxin, precipitin and agglutinin. That all the three substances were one entity (gamma globulins) was demonstrated by Elvin A. Kabat in 1939. In the preceding year Kabat had demonstrated the <b>heterogeneity</b> <b>of</b> antibodies through ultracentrifugation studies of horses' sera.|$|E
5|$|Eukaryotic cells {{exposed to}} DNA {{damaging}} agents also activate important defensive pathways by inducing multiple proteins involved in DNA repair, cell cycle checkpoint control, protein trafficking and degradation. Such genome wide transcriptional response is very complex and tightly regulated, thus allowing coordinated global response to damage. Exposure of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to DNA damaging agents results in overlapping but distinct transcriptional profiles. Similarities to environmental shock response {{indicates that a}} general global stress response pathway exist {{at the level of}} transcriptional activation. In contrast, different human cell types respond to damage differently indicating an absence of a common global response. The probable explanation for this difference between yeast and human cells may be in the <b>heterogeneity</b> <b>of</b> mammalian cells. In an animal different types of cells are distributed among different organs that have evolved different sensitivities to DNA damage.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Using a {{quasi-static}} three dimensional {{fault model}} {{which accounts for}} long range elastic interactions, we examine the influence <b>of</b> spatial <b>heterogeneities</b> <b>of</b> frictional strength on the slip distribution along a creeping fault. Slip fluctuates spatially because of pinning on local asperities. We show that three regimes of slip correlations exist. The rst regime results in a uniform slip as in an homogeneous medium. On the contrary, slip in the second regime highly fluctuates and is controlled by <b>heterogeneities</b> <b>of</b> frictional strength. The third regime is intermediate and develops ar-eas of high slip that are {{much bigger than the}} local asperity size (self-ane properties of the slip distribution). This par-ticular regime illustrates the possible misinterpretation of low frequency slip data (e. g. interferometric and GPS data) in terms of structural or compositional properties along th...|$|R

25|$|While most {{molecular}} epidemiology studies are still using conventional disease diagnosis and classification systems, {{it is increasingly}} recognized that disease evolution represents inherently heterogeneous processes differing from person to person. Conceptually, each individual has a unique disease process {{different from any other}} individual (“the unique disease principle”), considering uniqueness of the exposome (a totality of endogenous and exogenous / environmental exposures) and its unique influence on molecular pathologic process in each individual. Studies {{to examine the relationship between}} an exposure and molecular pathologic signature of disease (particularly cancer) became increasingly common throughout the 2000s. However, the use of molecular pathology in epidemiology posed unique challenges including lack of research guidelines and standardized statistical methodologies, and paucity of interdisciplinary experts and training programs. Furthermore, the concept of disease heterogeneity appears to conflict with the long-standing premise in epidemiology that individuals with the same disease name have similar etiologies and disease processes. To resolve these issues and advance population health science in the era of molecular precision medicine, “molecular pathology” and “epidemiology” was integrated to create a new interdisciplinary field of “molecular pathological epidemiology” (MPE), defined as “epidemiology of molecular pathology and <b>heterogeneity</b> <b>of</b> disease”. In MPE, investigators analyze the relationships between; (A) environmental, dietary, lifestyle and genetic factors; (B) alterations in cellular or extracellular molecules; and (C) evolution and progression of disease. A better understanding of <b>heterogeneity</b> <b>of</b> disease pathogenesis will further contribute to elucidate etiologies of disease. The MPE approach can be applied to not only neoplastic diseases but also non-neoplastic diseases. The concept and paradigm of MPE have become widespread in the 2010s.|$|E
25|$|The {{capacities}} and demands {{model has been}} proposed {{to account for the}} <b>heterogeneity</b> <b>of</b> the disorder. In this approach, speech performance varies depending on the capacity that the individual has for producing fluent speech, and the demands placed upon the person by the speaking situation. Capacity for fluent speech may be affected by a predisposition to the disorder, auditory processing or motor speech deficits, and cognitive or affective issues. Demands may be increased by internal factors such as lack of confidence or self esteem or inadequate language skills or external factors such as peer pressure, time pressure, stressful speaking situations, insistence on perfect speech, and the like. In stuttering, the severity of the disorder is seen as likely to increase when demands placed on the person's speech and language system exceed their capacity to deal with these pressures. However, the precise nature of the capacity or incapacity has not been delineated.|$|E

There has been no examination of the development <b>of</b> <b>heterogeneity</b> {{in the context of a}} cumulative meta-analysis. Methods Cumulative meta-analyses of five smoking cessation interventions (clonidine, nicotine replacement therapy using gum and patch, physician advice and acupuncture) were used to calculate I 2 and H. These values were plotted by year of publication, control event rate and sample size to trace the development <b>of</b> <b>heterogeneity</b> over these covariates. Results The cumulative evaluation <b>of</b> <b>heterogeneity</b> varied according to the measure <b>of</b> <b>heterogeneity</b> used and the basis of cumulation. Plots produced from the calculations revealed areas <b>of</b> <b>heterogeneity</b> useful in the consideration of potential sources for further study. Conclusion The examination <b>of</b> <b>heterogeneity</b> in conjunction with summary effect estimates in a cumulative meta-analysis offered valuable insight into the evolution of variation. Such information is not available in the context of conventional meta-analysis and has the potential to lead to the development of a richer picture of the effectiveness of interventions. </p...|$|R
