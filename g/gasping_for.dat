5|$|Beagles may {{exhibit a}} {{behaviour}} known as reverse sneezing, {{in which they}} sound {{as if they are}} choking or <b>gasping</b> <b>for</b> breath, but are actually drawing air in through the mouth and nose. The exact cause of this behaviour is not known, but it can be a common occurrence and is not harmful to the dog.|$|E
5|$|The station {{provided}} two permanent crew quarters, the Kayutkas, phonebox-sized booths set {{towards the}} rear of the core module, each featuring a tethered sleeping bag, a fold-out desk, a porthole, and storage for personal effects. Visiting crews had no allocated sleep module, instead attaching a sleeping bag to an available space on a wall; US astronauts installed themselves within Spektr until a collision with a Progress spacecraft caused the depressurisation of that module. It was important that crew accommodations be well ventilated; otherwise, astronauts could wake up oxygen-deprived and <b>gasping</b> <b>for</b> air, because a bubble of their own exhaled carbon dioxide had formed around their heads.|$|E
5|$|A young Addie (Katelyn Reed) {{stares up}} at an old mansion when two {{troublesome}} twins Brian and Troy (Kai and Bodhi Schulz) arrive, planning to enter the house. Addie warns them not to enter the house, but they ignore her warning and enter the house anyway. While they wreak havoc, Brian discovers a dying animal and the twins find an open door to the basement. They enter the basement where they find jars containing animal remains and human fetuses. After complaining about the smell, Brian leaves the basement {{only to find that}} his brother has gone silent. He searches for him and finds him with his throat slit, <b>gasping</b> <b>for</b> air. The Infantata (Ben Woolf) appears behind him and kills him off screen.|$|E

25|$|Dennis McGuire was {{executed}} in Lucasville, Ohio, on January 17, 2014. According to reporters, {{the execution of}} McGuire took more than 20 minutes and McGuire was <b>gasping</b> <b>for</b> air for 10 to 13 minutes. It was the first use of a new drug combination which was introduced in Ohio after the European Union banned sodium thiopental exports. This renewed criticism on the conventional three-drug method.|$|E

25|$|Twilight finds a {{book about}} the Crystal Empire's past, {{learning}} of a Crystal Fair used to raise the spirits of the Crystal Ponies. She and her friends go about to recreate the fair; Twilight assumes that one aspect, a Crystal Heart, is a ceremonial piece and constructs a crude version of it from crystal. As Cadance's magic starts to falter, the fair starts, and the Crystal Ponies soon cheer up and slowly remember their past. Rainbow Dash overhears one discuss part of the ceremony of the fair where they would channel their elated feelings into the Crystal Heart to protect the Empire; Rainbow races back to warn Twilight they need to find the real Crystal Heart, and Twilight discovers that the page about the Heart's powers has been purposely torn out from the book. Just then, Cadance's magic completely shuts down as she collapses in Shining Armor's arms, <b>gasping</b> <b>for</b> air, allowing King Sombra to surround the Empire.|$|E
25|$|In {{the winter}} of 1896 – 1897, the health of Grand Duke Friedrich Franz deteriorated. In the spring, Anastasia took her husband to Grasse {{in the hope that}} the change of {{location}} might initiate a recovery. It was during this time that their eldest daughter, Alexandrine, was engaged to the son of the Danish Crown Prince, who later became King Christian X of Denmark. A few weeks later, at the beginning of April, Anastasia returned with her husband to Villa Wenden. Anticipating the worst, she sent for their son, who was studying in Dresden. On April 10, while the family and household were at dinner, a coachman found Grand Duke Friedrich Franz unconscious at the bottom of the villa's -high retaining wall on the road below the rose-festooned parapet, which encircled the villa's garden. He had jumped in an attempt to end his life. He was carried back to the villa, where he finally died. The official report was that the sick grand duke, <b>gasping</b> <b>for</b> air, had gone to the balcony falling down over the railing accidentally.|$|E
25|$|The station {{provides}} crew {{quarters for}} {{each member of}} the expedition's crew, with two 'sleep stations' in the Zvezda and four more installed in Harmony. The American quarters are private, approximately person-sized soundproof booths. The Russian crew quarters include a small window, but provide less ventilation and sound proofing. A crew member can sleep in a crew quarter in a tethered sleeping bag, listen to music, use a laptop, and store personal items in a large drawer or in nets attached to the module's walls. The module also provides a reading lamp, a shelf and a desktop. Visiting crews have no allocated sleep module, and attach a sleeping bag to an available space on a wall. It is possible to sleep floating freely through the station, but this is generally avoided because of the possibility of bumping into sensitive equipment. It is important that crew accommodations be well ventilated; otherwise, astronauts can wake up oxygen-deprived and <b>gasping</b> <b>for</b> air, because a bubble of their own exhaled carbon dioxide has formed around their heads.|$|E

500|$|Her nanny, {{who called}} Elisabeth [...] "my baby," [...] woke Elisabeth {{in the middle}} of the night and settled her in a window seat of the nursery so that she might look out on the game spread out upon the grounds below. One morning, the eight-year-old awoke with a sore throat and pains in her chest, which the Russian Court doctor put down to too much {{excitement}} with her cousins the previous day. Her fever rose to 104 degrees. The imperial party didn't believe her illness was a serious one and went ahead with their plans for the day and attended the theater as planned. By the evening Elisabeth was in even more severe pain and had started <b>gasping</b> <b>for</b> breath. A specialist was summoned from Warsaw. The specialist gave her injections of caffeine and camphor to stimulate her slowing heart, but without success.|$|E
500|$|David Balls of Digital Spy rated [...] "Work" [...] {{three stars}} out of five, writing that it [...] "bears all the {{ingredients}} of a smash, but lacks the killer blow to leave you <b>gasping</b> <b>for</b> air." [...] Balls also noted that Ciara tends to rely on guest artists to guarantee a hit. The Houston Chronicle critic Joey Guerra called the song a [...] "blast of energy", but observed that it is [...] "too reminiscent of past Ciara/Elliott hits". Guerra said that [...] "A little variation would have made for a more dynamic tune." [...] Andy Kellman of Allmusic was more critical and called the song an [...] "over-stuffed dancefloor mess that does not benefit from Missy Elliott's hoarse hectorin". Jordan Sargent of PopMatters considered the song a letdown due to Ciara's [...] "lifeless" [...] vocal delivery. Dan Gennoe of Yahoo! UK & Ireland referred to the song as [...] "an underwhelming twitch which Missy surely wouldn't have had anywhere near {{one of her own}} albums." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{battle at}} Ostrach had been difficult, as Jourdan pointed out, {{due largely to}} the dense fog and terrible weather that {{hampered}} his observation of his enemy's movements, yet the same fog that blinded him to the Austrian movements {{did not seem to}} hamper Charles. [...] The fog and rainy weather did play a role, however. On a local level, in the damp night of the 20th, which was Gründonnerstag, (German: Green Thursday, or Maundy Thursday), the Danube overflowed, backing up into the Ostrach, and causing it to burst its own banks. The flood trapped 300civilians between the two armies intent on destruction; suspecting what was to come, Ostrachers huddled in their cellars, and hoped for the best and <b>gasping</b> <b>for</b> breath as the battle thundered overhead. Amazingly, none were killed, although they spent Easter Sunday caring for the wounded, and helping to bury the 4,000or so soldiers who died in the battle.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Dreamlover" [...] was {{directed}} by Diane Martel and filmed in upstate New York in June 1993. The video features scenes of Carey swimming in a small pond by a waterfall, boarding a colorful hot air balloon, and dancing alongside several shirtless male dancers. As the video begins, Carey is swimming underwater while wearing clothing. She is soon <b>gasping</b> <b>for</b> air and climbing into a flower bed above. As she frolics and rolls in a field, scenes of Carey boarding a hot air balloon are inter-cut. Her dog Jack makes a cameo appearance, as he follows her through the field and pond. After a short interval of dancing alongside several male dancers, Carey leaves with her dog as the video concludes. After filming the video, Carey revealed that the water was so cold that she refused to swim until the director, Martel, dived in first. Author Chris Nickson felt the video captured the song's soft and relaxed nature: [...] "The casual feel, almost like clips from home movies edited together, captured the song's off-the-shoulder airiness." [...] The video received heavy rotation on several video music channels, which added to the song's chart performance.|$|E
500|$|Backstage at SNL, Hartman {{was called}} [...] "the Glue", a name coined by Adam Sandler, {{according}} to Jay Mohr's book <b>Gasping</b> <b>for</b> Airtime. However, {{according to a}} biography on Hartman's life entitled You Might Remember Me: The Life and Times of Phil Hartman written by Mike Thomas, author and {{staff writer for the}} Chicago Sun-Times, the nickname was created by SNL cast member and Hartman's frequent on-screen collaborator Jan Hooks. Hartman often helped other cast members. For example, he aided Jan Hooks in overcoming her stage fright. SNL creator Lorne Michaels explained the reason for the name: [...] "He kind of held the show together. He gave to everybody and demanded very little. He was very low-maintenance." [...] Michaels also added that Hartman was [...] "the least appreciated" [...] cast member by commentators outside the show, and praised his ability [...] "to do five or six parts in a show where you're playing support or you're doing remarkable character work". Hartman won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Variety, Music or Comedy Program for SNL in 1989, sharing the award with the show's other writers. He was nominated in the same category in 1987, and individually in 1994 for Outstanding Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program.|$|E

The expulsions of the Trotskyists and disintegration of the party's youth section left the organization greatly weakened and <b>gasping</b> <b>for</b> life, its membership level at a new low.|$|E

2500|$|Flinching {{is showing}} a strong {{negative}} physical {{reaction to a}} proposal. [...] Common examples of flinching are <b>gasping</b> <b>for</b> air, or a visible expression of surprise or shock. [...] The flinch can be done consciously or unconsciously. [...] The flinch signals to the opposite party that you think the offer or proposal is absurd in hopes the other party will lower their aspirations. [...] Seeing a physical reaction is more believable than hearing someone saying, [...] "I'm shocked." ...|$|E

The track was recorded live at Le Metropolis in Montreal. According to The Guardian Alexis Petridis, the live recording is [...] "unadorned – you can hear Wainwright <b>gasping</b> <b>for</b> breath between each line". The EP version is slightly different from the Want Two version, which features an overdubbed horn solo.|$|E
