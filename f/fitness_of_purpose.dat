The aims of the study were: (1) to assess general perceptions of employability, and (2) to assess sports graduates’ and employers’ perceptions of specific capabilities and competencies in order to identify possible improvements for sports graduate employability programmes. A cross-sectional survey of sports graduates and employers was administered in six EU countries including the UK, France, Germany, Spain, Greece and the Czech Republic to assess graduate and employer perceptions. A graduate capabilities and competencies framework was devised to assess personal, interpersonal, cognitive, role-specific and generic skills.

We then discuss the evolution of the concept of quality and define it in its various forms. We focus on <b>fitness</b> <b>of</b> <b>purpose,</b> fitness for purpose and standard-based quality, and justify concern for quality assurance. We discuss three quality assurance mechanisms: quality audit, quality assessment and accreditation. We then identify the purposes of accreditation: quality control, accountability, transparency, academic mobility and quality enhancement. Different types of accreditation for institutions and programmes are then identified and described, with seven broad categories and four sub-categories of coverage. Examples of good practices are provided in each category. The paper then describes the accreditation process, including general and specific criteria, means of verifying that institutions meet the criteria using quantitative and qualitative data, the decision-making process, the outcome report and follow-up actions. The management and affiliation of accreditation systems is then discussed, including the role of the state and accountability measures. Finally, we identify eleven issues at stake. The paper ends with some general strategies for effective accreditation at the national, agency and institutional levels. Peer Reviewe...|$|E

40|$|Low {{language}} proficiency remains a significant barrier to healthcare access for many patients throughout the world. Training healthcare {{professionals in the}} language of their minority language patients, therefore, should lead to greater healthcare access, lowered costs, better health outcomes, and improved patient satisfaction (Zambrana, Molnar, Munoz, & Lopez, 2004). One important aspect of language training involves the development of accessible, appropriate, and pedagogically sound language training materials. The first goal of this thesis is to describe the development of the "Virtual Language Patient," a computer-based language training module based on the Virtual Dialogue Method (Harless, Zier, & Duncan, 1999). The prototype system under consideration employs automatic speech recognition (ASR) technology, using video clips of a simulated medical history interview with a minority language patient. The second goal of this thesis is to report the findings of a proof-of-concept feasibility study where the ease of operability and <b>fitness</b> <b>of</b> <b>purpose</b> of this prototype system were explored. Five nursing-students at a French language nursing college in Quebec reported the system to be easy to operate and fit for their anticipated language learning needs in terms of target language, choice of interlocutor, mode of interaction, task type, and corrective feedback. Training effects on participants' pronunciation scores, speech rate, and sense of preparedness for real life medical interviews suggest that the system can be effective in language training for healthcare professionals.

40|$|An {{innovative}} versatile strategy using Total Error {{has been}} proposed to decide about the method’s validity that controls the risk of accepting an unsuitable assay together {{with the ability to}} predict the reliability of future results. This strategy is based on the simultaneous combination of systematic (bias) and random (imprecision) error of analytical methods. Using validation standards both types of error are combined {{through the use of a}} prediction interval or β-expectation tolerance interval. Finally, an accuracy profile is built by connecting, on one hand all the upper tolerance limits, and on the other hand all the lower tolerance limits. This profile combined with pre-specified acceptance limits allows to evaluate the validity of any quantitative analytical method and thus their fitness for their intended purpose. In this work, the approach of accuracy profile was evaluated on several types of analytical methods encountered in pharmaceutical industrial field and also covering different pharmaceutical matrices. The four studied examples depicted the flexibility and applicability of this approach for different matrices ranging from tablets to syrups, different techniques such as liquid chromatography, or UV spectrophotometry and for different categories of assays commonly encountered in the pharmaceutical industry that are content assays, dissolution assays and quantitative impurity assays. The accuracy profile approach assesses the <b>fitness</b> <b>of</b> <b>purpose</b> of these methods for their future routine application,. It also allows to select the most suitable calibration curve, to evaluate adequately a potential matrix effect and propose efficient solution and to define correctly the limits of quantification of the studied analytical procedures.

40|$|Thesis (MSc) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2011. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: 3 D virtual environments {{can be used}} as therapy {{tools in}} {{patients}} with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs); however, the development of such tools is time-consuming. A 3 D virtual environment development platform for such tools has been developed specifically for the South African context, because of the language and culture sensitivity of these therapy tools. The 3 D virtual environment development platform has a Lua scripting interface for specifying logic in the virtual environments. Lua is a textual programming language, and presents a challenge to ASDs therapists’ ability to create therapy tools without engaging an expert programmer. The aim of this research was to investigate the design and implementation of a visual programming environment to support non-expert programmers in scripting within the 3 D virtual environment development platform. Various visual program representation techniques, reported in the literature, were examined to determine their appropriateness for adoption in our design. A visual programming language based on the “building-block” approach was considered the most suitable. The research resulted {{in the development of a}} visual script editor (VSE), based on an open source framework called the OpenBlocks library. The VSE successfully alleviated the syntax burden that textual programming languages place on non-expert programmers. The <b>fitness</b> <b>of</b> <b>purpose</b> of our VSE was exemplified in a sample 3 D virtual environment that was scripted using the VSE. Despite the success, we argue that the applicability of the “building-block” approach is limited to domain-specific programming languages due to the absence of visual expressions for defining user-defined types, and for specifying hierarchy.

40|$|The 3 rd American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists (AAPS) /Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Bioanalytical {{workshop}} in 2006 concluded with several new recommendations regarding the validation of bioanalytical methods {{in a report}} published in 2007. It was aimed to conciliate or adapt validation principles for small and large molecules {{and an opportunity to}} revisit some of the major decision rules related to acceptance criteria given the experience accumulated since 1990. The purpose here is to provide a "risk-based" reading of the recommendations of 3 rd AAPS/FDA Bioanalytical Workshop. Five decision rules were compared using simulations: the proposed pre-study FDA and Total Error Rules, the rules based on the beta-Expectation Tolerance and beta-gamma-Content Tolerance Interval and, finally, the 4 - 6 - 20 rule for in-study acceptance of runs. The simulation results demonstrated that the beta-Expectation Tolerance Rule controls appropriately the risk. The beta-gamma-Content Tolerance Interval was found to be too conservative, depending on the objective, and to lead to a high rate of rejection of procedures that could be considered as acceptable. On the other side, the FDA and the AAPS/FDA workshop Total Error Rule, combined or not, did not achieve their intended objective. With these rules, the risk is high to deliver results in study that would not meet the targeted acceptance criteria. This can be explained because, first, there is confusion between the quality of a procedure and the <b>fitness</b> <b>of</b> <b>purpose</b> of the results it could produce and, second, between the initial performances of a procedure, for example evaluated during pre-study validation {{and the quality of the}} future results.

40|$|Methods {{validation}} {{is mandatory}} {{in order to}} assess the <b>fitness</b> <b>of</b> <b>purpose</b> of the developed analytical method. Of core importance {{at the end of the}} validation is the evaluation of the reliability of the individual results that will be generated during the routine application of the method. Regulatory guidelines provide a general framework to assess the validity of a method, but none address the issue of results reliability. In this study, a Bayesian approach is proposed to address this concern. Results reliability is defined here as "the probability (π) of an analytical method to provide analytical results (X) within predefined acceptance limits (±λ) around their reference or conventional true concentration values (μ(T)) over a defined concentration range and under given environmental and operating conditions. " By providing the minimum reliability probability (π(min)) needed for the subsequent routine application of the method, as well as specifications or acceptance limits (±λ), the proposed Bayesian approach provides the effective probability of obtaining reliable future analytical results over the whole concentration range investigated. This is summarised in a single graph: the reliability profile. This Bayesian reliability profile is also compared to two frequentist approaches, the first one derived from the work of Dewé et al. [W. Dewé, B. Govaerts, B. Boulanger, E. Rozet, P. Chiap, Ph. Hubert, Chemometr. Intell. Lab. Syst. 85 (2007) 262 - 268] and the second proposed by Govaerts et al. [B. Govaerts, W. Dewé, M. Maumy, B. Boulanger, Qual. Reliab. Eng. Int. 24 (2008) 667 - 680]. Furthermore, to illustrate the applicability of the Bayesian reliability profile, this approach is also applied here to a bioanalytical method dedicated to the determination of ketoglutaric acid (KG) and hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) in human plasma by SPE-HPLC-UV...|$|E
