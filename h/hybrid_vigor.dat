40|$|Maize (Zea mays L.) is a {{tropical}} crop with low tolerance to cold conditions {{and has to}} be planted late in temperate areas due to low temperatures. The objective of this research was to identify new cold tolerant populations among the European germplasm useful for improving adaptation to early sowing. For that, the European Union Maize Landraces Core Collection (EUMLCC) was evaluated under cold conditions. After a preliminary screening of 95 populations the 11 populations with best germination and early growth under cold conditions were multiplied and evaluated in a cold chamber and in early field sowings at two locations during 2 years. The cold tolerant populations from the EUMLCC were not significantly different from the cold tolerant checks in the cold chamber. In early field sowing, some EUMLCC populations had similar emergence than the commercial checks and the coldest tolerant <b>hybrids,</b> and higher <b>vigor</b> than all the hybrids and the yield of some of the populations surpassed the yield of the cold tolerant hybrids. Altogether, Aranga 1 emerged as the most promising candidate as base population for improving adaptation to early sowing.

40|$|Sweet corn (Zea mays L.) has a poor {{adaptation}} to areas with short growing seasons and cool humid springs, {{such as the}} European Atlantic coast. Field corn inbreds adapted to the European Atlantic coast could improve the adaptation of sweet corn to these conditions. Our objectives were to identify field corn inbreds as potentials donors of early vigor and {{adaptation to}} the European Atlantic coast, and to provide additional information on the relationships among different estimators of favorable alleles for adaptation traits. Eleven European and American field corn inbreds adapted to Northwestern Spain, were crossed to seven sweet corn inbreds that were parents of seven sweet corn hybrids. The inbreds and the crosses field x sweet corn were evaluated separately in field trials at two locations in Northwestern Spain in 1993 and 1994. Early vigor and four agronomic traits were recorded. Estimates of relative number of alleles at six classes of loci (B, C, D, E, F and G), and six methods for identifying field corn inbreds with favorable alleles were computed, namely an estimate of favorable dominant alleles present in the donor {{but not in the}} hybrid (µG'), predicted three-way cross (PTC), minimum upper bound (UBND), net improvement (NI), probability of net gain of favorable alleles given complete dominance (PNGg) and given partial dominance or complementary epistasis (PNGceg) and general combining ability (GCA) effects. Correlations between µG', UBND, PTC, NI, and GCA were high for all traits. Some of the estimators were not possibly calculated presumably due to fails on the assumptions of the model. PTC, which was highly correlated with most of the other estimators, may be biased by fails on the assumptions of the model also. However, PTC can be calculated irrespectively of the presumably fails of the assumptions of the model used for estimating favorable alleles. The European flint inbred EP 42 was identified by all methods as the best source of early vigor and adaptation for improving sweet corn <b>hybrids.</b> Adult <b>vigor</b> was not clearly related with early vigor.

25|$|Since {{hypotheses}} for {{the origins}} of sex are difficult to test experimentally (outside of Evolutionary computation), most current work {{has focused on the}} maintenance of sexual reproduction. Sexual reproduction must offer significant fitness advantages to a species because despite the two-fold cost of sex, it dominates among multicellular forms of life, implying that the fitness of offspring produced outweighs the costs. Sexual reproduction derives from recombination, where parent genotypes are reorganized and shared with the offspring. This stands in contrast to single-parent asexual replication, where the offspring is identical to the parents. Recombination supplies two fault-tolerance mechanisms at the molecular level: recombinational DNA repair (promoted during meiosis because homologous chromosomes pair at that time) and complementation (also known as heterosis, <b>hybrid</b> <b>vigor</b> or masking of mutations).|$|E

Despite the economic importance of maize, {{and the fact that}} it naturally hybridizes with the teosinte taxon Zea mays ssp. mexicana, sometimes known as “chalco teosinte,” the question has received little experimental attention in this system. Using a glyphosate-tolerant maize cultivar and chalco teosinte as parental lines, we carried out a field experiment testing (1) the relative fitness of maize × teosinte hybrids, compared to their parental taxa, as well as (2) the relative fitness of transgenic hybrids compared to non-transgenic hybrids created from the same parental stock. In order to evaluate the influence of the transgenic construct in different genetic backgrounds, our study included transgenic and non-transgenic pure maize progeny from the cultivar as well. We measured both vegetative and reproductive parameters. Our results demonstrated that <b>hybrids</b> have greater <b>vigor</b> and produced more seeds than the wild parent. However, in the absence of selective pressure from glyphosate herbicide, we did not observe any direct positive or negative impact of the transgene on the fitness or vigor of either the hybrids or pure maize progeny.

Genetic research shows that wolf and dog populations initially diverged approximately 14,000 years ago and have interbred only occasionally since, accounting for the dissimilarity between dogs and wolves in behavior and appearance. In many cases the resulting adult wolfdog may be larger than either of its parents due to the genetic phenomenon of heterosis (commonly known as <b>hybrid</b> <b>vigor).</b> Breeding experiments in Germany with Poodles and wolves, and later on with the resulting wolfdogs showed unrestricted fertility, mating via free choice and no significant problems of communication (even after a few generations).

Carver left for Tuskegee when Wallace was eight, but his influence on Wallace was deep and lasting. By the age of ten, Wallace was experimenting with plant breeding in his own plot.

2500|$|The {{theory of}} <b>hybrid</b> <b>vigor</b> {{suggests}} {{that as a}} group, dogs of varied ancestry will be healthier than their purebred counterparts. In purebred dogs, intentionally breeding dogs of very similar appearance over several generations produces animals that carry {{many of the same}} alleles, some of which are detrimental. If the founding population for the breed was small, then the genetic diversity of that particular breed may be small for quite some time. In essence, when humans select certain dogs for new breeds, they artificially isolate that group of genes and cause more copies of that gene to be made than might have otherwise occurred in nature. Initially, the population will be more fragile {{because of the lack of}} genetic diversity. If the dog breed is popular, and the line continues, over hundreds of years diversity will increase due to mutations and occasional out-breeding; like an island with a few new birds—they will diversify. This is why some of the very [...] "old" [...] breeds are more stable. The problem is when certain traits found in the breed standard are associated with genetic disorders. Then, the artificial selective force favors the duplication of the genetic disorder, because it comes with a desired physical trait. The genetic health of hybrids tends to be higher. Healthy traits have been lost in many purebred dogs lines because many breeders of showdogs are more interested in conformation – the physical attributes of the dogs in relation to the breed standard – than in the health and working temperament for which the dog was originally bred.|$|E
