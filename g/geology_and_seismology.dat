5000|$|Calculations for {{determining}} seismic hazard were first formulated by C. Allin Cornell in 1968 and, {{depending on their}} level of importance and use, can be quite complex. [...] The regional <b>geology</b> <b>and</b> <b>seismology</b> setting is first examined for sources and patterns of earthquake occurrence, both in depth and at the surface from seismometer records; secondly, the impacts from these sources are assessed relative to local geologic rock and soil types, slope angle and groundwater conditions. Zones of similar potential earthquake shaking are thus determined and drawn on maps. The well known San Andreas Fault is illustrated as a long narrow elliptical zone of greater potential motion, like many areas along continental margins associated with the Pacific ring of fire. Zones of higher seismicity in the continental interior may be the site for intraplate earthquakes) and tend to be drawn as broad areas, based on historic records, like the 1812 New Madrid earthquake, since specific causative faults are generally not identified as earthquake sources.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{subject of}} non-equilibrium {{thermodynamics}} is now quite old, {{dating back to}} Prigogine, Biot and Truesdell in the 1950 ’s and 1960 ’s. It has had a resurgence in the physical sciences {{in the past five}} years largely due to a consolidation of ideas on thermodynamics as a whole and to advances in computer speeds. Non-equilibrium thermodynamics has now advanced to a stage where it forms an umbrella approach to understanding and modelling coupled phenomena in Earth Sciences. Currently, approaches are pioneered independently in geodynamics, seismology, material sciences (solid mechanics), atmospheric and marine sciences (fluid dynamics) and the chemical sciences. We present a first attempt at consolidating some ideas and show a simple example with potential significance for geodynamics, structural <b>geology</b> <b>and</b> <b>seismology...</b>|$|E

40|$|Loss {{estimation}} {{studies have}} traditionally been using individual scenario earthquakes {{as the basis for}} planning and decision making. Existing knowledge of regional <b>geology</b> <b>and</b> <b>seismology</b> have, in the same context, been used to generate maps with estimated intensities or ground-motion para-meters (e. g., accelerations). In combination with other factors (e. g., composition and structural characteristics of the building stock), these parameters allow a direct estimation of the damage to structures and lifelines and of the impacts on the population (e. g., number of injured and fatalities). Nowadays, the advent of high-speed computing, satellite telemetry, and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) has made it possible to generate rapid loss estimates for multiple earthquake scenarios, and to provide a greatly improved mapping capability. Perhaps most importantly, it is now within reach to derive damage and loss estimates for an earthquake in near real-time solely based on the source parameters of an event, with magnitude and location as a minimum. We have investigated the capabilities and efficiency of the seismic risk and loss assessment tool SELENA [Molina et al., 2007] for such a near real-time application. One of the main features of this tool consists of taking into account epistemic uncertainties in all types of input data by a logic-tree computation scheme.

40|$|To fully {{understand}} the complex interactions of various phenomena in the natural world, scientific disciplines such as <b>geology</b> <b>and</b> <b>seismology</b> increasingly rely upon analyzing large amounts of observations. However, data collection is growing {{at a faster rate}} than what is currently possible to analyze through traditional approaches. These datasets, supplied by the increasing use of sensors and remote sensing, require specialized computer programs to effectively analyze complex and expansive volumes of data. Elaborating on existing geophysical data processing approaches for infrasound data collected from an avalanche-prone area, this project proposes new techniques for processing large geophysical datasets. These improved techniques take advantage of Graphical Processing Units (GPU) to accelerate floating-point, computationally expensive operations. Additionally, they allow for dividing the workload among nodes in a High Performance Computing cluster yielding a performance speedup of 3. 5 times for every additional node added. Finally, a machine learning approach was used to classify events found in the processed data, which demonstrates the potential of automatic real-time avalanche detection. Applications with characteristics similar to infrasound processing are common throughout the earth-sciences, and this work exemplifies the potential of these techniques to an array of science fields. New algorithms for efficient data processing like those presented in this work are fundamental to analyzing large geophysical datasets, as well as to improving the accuracy of computer models across many disciplines...|$|E
40|$|International audiencePaleoseismology is a {{relatively}} young method of earthquake studies at the interface between <b>geology</b> <b>and</b> <b>seismology.</b> Paleoseismic investigations have enriched the fault rupture database in some active zones (e. g., California, Turkey, Italy) and contribute to a significant progress {{in the concept of}} earthquake cycle. The increasing number of paleoseismic studies in the last decades was dedicated primarily to the major continental faults that experienced large earthquakes (Mw > 7). The validity of paleoseismic results was tested in regions with long historical catalogs and well-documented past earthquake ruptures as along the North Anatolian Fault and Dead Sea Fault. Major advances in the calculation of realistic earthquake hazard assessment are achieved when earthquake geology and paleoseismic data are available. Among case studies, the probabilistic seismic hazard assessment of the Istanbul (Turkey) region, based on earthquake scenarios revealed the influence of paleoseismic data on the ground motion equations. The integration of paleoseismology in earthquake hazard projects is, however, not yet systematic and consequently many earthquake hazard maps include large uncertainties and approximations. 10. 1 INTRODUCTION Geological investigations applied to the study of past earthquakes are now at the forefront of seismological and seismic hazard research. Also known as paleoseismology, these investigations include the study of active faulting, seismites (sedimentary structures produced by shaking), liquefaction features, and other effects of earthquake shaking (e. g., rockfalls and landslides) that can be recorded in superficial geological units (Soloneko, 1973; McCalpin, 1996).

40|$|We {{examine the}} local {{nature of the}} dynamic stress field in the {{vicinity}} of the tip of a semi-infinite sub-Rayleigh (slower than the Rayleigh wave speed, c_R) mode II crack with a velocity-weakening cohesive zone. We constrain the model using results from dynamic photoelastic experiments, in which shear ruptures were nucleated spontaneously in Homalite- 100 plates along a bonded, precut, and inclined interface subject to a far-field uniaxial prestress. During the experiments, tensile cracks grew periodically along one side of the shear rupture interface at a roughly constant angle relative to the shear rupture interface. The occurrence and inclination of the tensile cracks are explained by our analytical model. With slight modifications, the model can be scaled to natural faults, providing diagnostic criteria for interpreting velocity, directivity, and static prestress state associated with past earthquakes on exhumed faults. Indirectly, this method also allows one to constrain the velocity-weakening nature of natural ruptures, providing an important link between field <b>geology,</b> laboratory experiments, <b>and</b> <b>seismology...</b>|$|R

An applicant for a combined license (COL) referencing the ESBWR design control document (DCD) will establish the actual site characteristics with respect to these areas when it applies for a COL, or it will reference an early site permit (ESP) that reflects such characteristics.

HVSR technique using microtremors is applied only in the populated area of Kastelli and Paleohora basins and reveals five fault zones in Kastelli and four major fault zones in Paleohora crosscutting the densely populated areas. The effects of the surface and subsurface structure are well patterned in the horizontal to vertical spectra ratios. One amplified clear frequency, two high amplified clear frequencies, broad and flat or low amplitude HVSR peaks attributes the effects of surface and subsurface structure on seismic ground motion.
