40|$|Michael Haynes {{has pointed}} out that the {{conventional}} methodology for estimating the number of Soviet war deaths provides only a lower limit. It calculates wartime “excess ” deaths, assuming that no one was killed by the war who would normally have died anyway; this sets a lower bound on the number of real war deaths that may have resulted directly or indirectly from enemy action. Where is the upper limit? Haynes proposes the 16 million total of “normal ” deaths as a measure of the maximum possible <b>downward</b> <b>error</b> when real Soviet war deaths are estimated by the excess mortality method. The possible margin of <b>downward</b> <b>error</b> arising from this method can be calculated and is not 16 million but approximately 1. 9 million...|$|E
40|$|Test retrievals for the {{airborne}} limb- and upward sounder MIPAS-STR (Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding-STRatospheric aircraft) were performed. The influence of spectral noise and systematic errors was tested {{for a set}} of atmospheric trace gases. <b>Downward</b> <b>error</b> propagation from the unknown part of the profile above the aircraft and unresolved features in the reference profiles lead to deviations of the fit result even for the unperturbed retrievals. In cases of smooth profiles it was possible to retrieve the gradient up to some km above the flight level. Averaging kernels and test retrievals showed the possibility to increase the vertical resolution by oversampled measurements. However, a field-of-view (FOV) oversampling with respect to a vertical FOV extent larger than 1 / 2 does not seem to improve the results significantly. 1...|$|E
40|$|Visual {{memory for}} the spatial {{location}} where {{a moving target}} vanishes {{has been found to}} be systematically displaced downward in the direction of gravity. Moreover, it was recently reported that the magnitude of the <b>downward</b> <b>error</b> increases steadily with increasing retention intervals imposed after object's offset and before observers are allowed to perform the spatial localization task, in a pattern where the remembered vanishing location drifts downward as if following a falling trajectory. This outcome was taken to reflect the dynamics of a representational model of earth's gravity. The present study aims to establish the spatial and temporal features of this downward drift by taking into account the dynamics of the motor response. The obtained results show that the memory for the last location of the target drifts downward with time, thus replicating previous results. Moreover, the time taken for completion of the behavioural localization movements seems to add to the imposed retention intervals in determining the temporal frame during which the visual memory is updated. Overall, it is reported that the representation of spatial location drifts downward by about 3 pixels for each two-fold increase of time until response. The outcomes are discussed in relation to a predictive internal model of gravity which outputs an on-line spatial update of remembered objects' location...|$|E

40|$|Ashenfelter and Krueger's (1993) within-twin, measurement-error- {{corrected}} {{estimate of}} the return to schooling is about 13 - 16 percent. If their estimate is unbiased, then their results imply considerable <b>downward</b> measurement <b>error</b> bias in uncorrected within-twin estimates of the return to schooling, and considerable downward omitted ability bias in cross-section estimates. This note points out that if there are ability differences among twins, then AK's IV estimator exacerbates the omitted ability bias in the within-twin estimate. Thus, upward omitted ability bias in within-twin estimates may provide an alternative explanation of the surprisingly high estimates of the return to schooling that AK obtain, and permit their results to be reconciled with upward, rather than downward omitted ability bias in cross-section estimates. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background To {{present an}} episodic random utility model that unifies time {{trade-off}} and discrete choice approaches in health state valuation. Methods First, we introduce two alternative random utility models (RUMs) for health preferences: the episodic RUM {{and the more}} common instant RUM. For the interpretation of time trade-off (TTO) responses, we show that the episodic model implies a coefficient estimator, and the instant model implies a mean slope estimator. Secondly, we demonstrate these estimators and {{the differences between the}} estimates for 42 health states using TTO responses from the seminal Measurement and Valuation in Health (MVH) study conducted in the United Kingdom. Mean slopes are estimates with and without Dolan's transformation of worse-than-death (WTD) responses. Finally, we demonstrate an exploded probit estimator, an extension of the coefficient estimator for discrete choice data that accommodates both TTO and rank responses. Results By construction, mean slopes are {{less than or equal to}} coefficients, because slopes are fractions and, therefore, magnify <b>downward</b> <b>errors</b> in WTD responses. The Dolan transformation of WTD responses causes mean slopes to increase in similarity to coefficient estimates, yet they are not equivalent (i. e., absolute mean difference = 0. 179). Unlike mean slopes, coefficient estimates demonstrate strong concordance with rank-based predictions (Lin's rho = 0. 91). Combining TTO and rank responses under the exploded probit model improves the identification of health state values, decreasing the average width of confidence intervals from 0. 057 to 0. 041 compared to TTO only results. Conclusion The episodic RUM expands upon the theoretical framework underlying health state valuation and contributes to health econometrics by motivating the selection of coefficient and exploded probit estimators for the analysis of TTO and rank responses. In future MVH surveys, sample size requirements may be reduced through the incorporation of multiple responses under a single estimator. </p...|$|R

The few existing estimates of the intergenerational correlation in income have been biased <b>downward</b> by measurement <b>error,</b> unrepresentative samples, or both.

40|$|Regressions can be {{weighted}} by propensity {{scores in}} order to reduce bias. However, weighting is likely to increase random error in the estimates, and to bias the estimated standard <b>errors</b> <b>downward,</b> even when selection mechanisms are well understood. Moreover, in some cases, weighting will increase the bias in estimated causal parameters. If investigators have a good causal model, it seems better just to fit the model without weights. If the causal model is improperly specified, there can be significant problems in retrieving the situation by weighting, although weighting may help under some circumstances...|$|R

40|$|A {{growing body}} of {{economics}} research projects the effects {{of global climate change}} on economic outcomes. Climate scientists often criticize these articles because nearly all ignore the well-established uncertainty in future temperature and rainfall changes, and therefore appear likely to have <b>downward</b> biased standard <b>errors</b> and potentially misleading point estimates. This paper incorporates climate uncertainty into estimates of climate change impacts on U. S. agriculture. Accounting for climate uncertainty leads to a much wider range of projected impacts on agricultural profits, with the 95 % confidence interval featuring drops of between 17 % to 88 %. An application to African agriculture yields similar results. ...|$|R

40|$|In situ {{airborne}} gravity data at altitudes of 11, 6. 3, and 1. 7 km over {{a smooth}} area of Alabama {{are used to}} assess gravity accuracy and errors in upward and downward continuations. Analysis of the Alabama free-air anomaly gravity data at crossover points at the three altitudes suggests 1 - 2 mgal accuracy for the dataset. Gravity data at each altitude are then expanded into local 3 D Fourier series, to prepare for continuation. This Fourier representation results in continuation errors at few-mgal level in Alabama, even in the extreme case of downward continuation from 11 km to sea level. The result in Alabama inspires an airborne gravity survey over the rough, inaccessible terrain of Tibet. Similar investigations as in Alabama are made in Tibet using EGM 08 -derived airborne gravity data at flight altitudes of 10, 5, and 0 km. Bouguer anomalies at the 10 -km altitude preserve the major tectonic features of Tibet. <b>Downward</b> continuation <b>errors</b> increase with terrain roughness, but the survey can enhance local tectonic features. This study highlights {{the value of a}} future Tibetan airborne gravity survey and points out the expected gravity accuracy and spatial resolution from this survey...|$|R
40|$|Two {{previous}} studies have used data from a social experiment to measure the impact of Progresa on children’s height. However most large scale nutrition interventions cannot afford to undertake a costly social experiment to measure program impact, leading {{to the question of}} whether program impact can be adequately estimated using non-experimental techniques. This study uses anthropometric data on beneficiary children taken from health centers to estimate program impact, and compares these estimates to those from the social experiment. The results show that the clinic based estimates are significantly smaller than those from the experiment. This result caused by two factors. First, significant differences between actual and listed treatment causes the impact estimator based on listed treatment to be biased <b>downward</b> (measurement <b>error).</b> Second, the clinic based data does not allow for the inclusion of an extensive set of control variables beyond child’s age and sex. The omitted variables are positively associated with program participation but negatively associated with child height, resulting in a further downward bias in program effects. 1 Thanks to Daniel Hernandez,Paul Gertler, and Marie Ruel for useful discussion.

40|$|International audienceIn {{order to}} {{accurately}} localize an object, human observers must integrate multiple sensory cues {{related to the}} environment and/or to the body. Such multisensory integration must be repeated over time, so that spatial localization is constantly updated according to environmental changes. In the present experimental study, we examined the multisensory integration processes underlying spatial updating by investigating how gradual modifications of gravitoinertial cues (i. e., somatosensory and vestibular cues) and visual cues affect target localization skills. These were assessed by using a continuous pointing task toward a body-fixed visual target. The ``single'' rotation of the gravitoinertial vector (produced by off-axis centrifugation) resulted in <b>downward</b> pointing <b>errors,</b> which likely were related {{to a combination of}} oculogravic and somatogravic illusions. The ``single'' downward pitch rotation of the visual background produced an elevation of the arm relative to the visual target, suggesting that the rotation of the visual background caused an illusory target elevation (induced-motion phenomenon). Strikingly, the errors observed during the ``combined'' rotation of the visual background and of the gravitoinertial vector appeared as a linear combination of the errors independently observed during ``single'' rotations. In other words, the centrifugation effect on target localization was reduced by the visual background rotation. The observed linear combination indicates that the weights of visual and gravitoinertial cues were similar and remained constant throughout the stimulation...|$|R
40|$|Wind {{predictions}} and bids in Denmark Wind {{power producers}} need a prediction method to bid their energy to day-ahead market. They pay balancing {{costs for the}} energy that has been forecasted wrong. If the prices for up- and down-regulation are asymmetric, it is worthwhile to bid a different amount than the forecast. Minimising the costs results in different bid than minimising the errors in energy. In this way the balancing costs are minimised. This is the case now in Denmark (both in West and in East), as the price difference of down-regulation and spot price is higher than for up-regulation. The question is, whether this kind of behaviour could result in wrong information for the TSO and cause more critical situations with larger errors in wind power production. This has been studied by a case of 12 months, for 2 wind farms in Denmark. They are both 20 MW wind farms, one is in East Denmark (Middelgrunden) and one in West Denmark (Klim). The results for the analysis are described in this document and more detailed results are in table 1. It is shown that for large <b>errors</b> <b>downward</b> (forecast production larger than realised production) there will be larger errors when using the bidding strategy. In those situations the information that the TSO receives from the bids would result in larger errors and more up-regulation would be needed...|$|R
40|$|Determination {{of natural}} angular {{frequency}} of concrete minarets by {{artificial neural network}} with various supporting conditions is general goal of this research. For the subject of neural network, training or learning algorithms are applied. The most famous of network structure which is back propagation algorithm is applied in this study. This algorithm is a systematic method for training multi layer artificial neural network. Back propagation algorithm is based on gradient descant which means that it moves <b>downward</b> on the <b>error</b> declination and regulates the weights for the minimum error. In this research, the real frequency of concrete minarets is calculated first using SAP 2000 program and {{is defined as a}} goal function for neural network, so that all outputs of the network can be compared to this function and the corresponding error can be calculated and so the best function will selected. Then, a set of inputs including dimensions or specifications of arches are made using MATLAB program. After the determination of algorithm and quantification of the network, the phases of training and testing of the results are carried out and the output of the network is created. It is concluded that the performance of the neural network is optimum and the errors are less than 8 %, so, the network trains in different manner. Furthermore the time of frequency calculations in neural network is less than real analysis time that calculated by SAP 2000 software and its precision is acceptable (less than 12 %) ...|$|R
40|$|A new {{technique}} for developing k-distributions applied to longwave radiation parameterization {{has been presented}} in a preceding paper. Now we discuss an extension of this technique to the shortwave spectral range. A fast k-distribution model (FKDM) for gaseous absorption calculations suitable for use in weather and climate prediction is described. FKDM has been created using 15 k-distribution terms only, less than in other comparable codes. The molecular species represented in the model are H 2 O, CO 2, O- 3, and O- 2. In k-distribution terms, characterized by strong absorption, representative absorption cross section is treated {{as a function of}} absorber amount along the direct solar radiation path, thus allowing improved fitting of solar fluxes and heating rates in upper troposphere and stratosphere. This technique has been applied to derive effective single-scattering properties of clouds in each term for a more accurate treatment of cloud optical properties by taking into account correlation between water vapor and liquid water or ice absorption. It is shown that disregarding the above correlation in radiation models can essentially distort simulated fluxes and heating rates. FKDM has been developed and validated using a fast line-by-line model (FLBLM). Both FKDM and FLBLM used a Monte-Carlo code. Validations have covered the tropical, midlatitude summer, midlatitude winter, subarctic summer, subarctic winter, and U. S. standard atmospheres, four atmospheres from the Spectral Radiance Experiment campaign, and a case of an observed tropical atmosphere. It is found that the FKDM heating rate accuracy for clear-sky conditions is as follows: similar to 0. 1 and similar to 0. 2 K d(- 1) in the troposphere for standard and real atmospheres, respectively, and similar to 0. 5 K d(- 1) in all the cases at altitudes below 70 km. <b>Downward</b> flux <b>errors</b> are below 1 %, upward flux errors are below 2 % (usually similar to 1. 5 W m(- 2)), and total atmospheric absorption errors are below 3 % (usually 1. 5 - 3 W m(- 2)) in every case. The Intercomparison of Radiation Codes in Climate Models (ICRCCM) cloud models have also been used for the validations. It has been demonstrated that the usage of the technique to derive effective cloud optical properties halves maximal errors in calculated radiation fluxes absorbed by cloud. Pages: Art.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{behind this}} thesis is {{to test whether}} certain contrarian factors can predict longterm stock returns in frontier markets. We do this by measuring simple, observable variables and their effect on returns 1 to 5 years ahead. The study is based on Skagen Funds investment strategy, which seeks to overweight under-valued, under-analyzed and unpopular companies. To identify under-valued companies, we have used price-book and price-earnings measures. For under-analyzed and unpopular, we have used analyst coverage and analyst consensus. In addition, we included index weight {{as a proxy for}} size to avoid potential issues with endogeneity. To secure unbiased estimators we control for fixed effects using dummy variables. In addition to this, we estimate standard errors by double clustering to avoid <b>downward</b> biased standard <b>errors.</b> Our results conclude that price-book and index weight are significant determinants on longterm returns. We to do not find that analyst consensus or recommendations affect returns. This indicates that no superior returns can be obtained from buying under-analyzed and unpopular companies. This may however also be due to the choice of wrong proxies. With few exceptions, our results have also been tested to be robust across different regions and sectors. With this research, we make several contributions to the literature: - We believe that we are the first to test the long-term relationships between contrarian factors and long-term returns in frontier markets. - We believe that we are the first to test such relationships after the financial crisis, regardless of holding periods. - As far as we know, we are also the first to use double clustering of standard errors while studying overlapping returns. As this approach increases the robustness of our results, we wish to encourage others to adapt this methodology in future research...|$|R
40|$|Background Self-contained tests {{estimate}} {{and test}} the association between a phenotype and mean expression level in a gene set defined a priori. Many self-contained gene set analysis methods have been developed but the performance of these methods for phenotypes that are continuous rather than discrete and with multiple nuisance covariates has not been well studied. Here, I use Monte Carlo simulation to evaluate the performance of both novel and previously published (and readily available via R) methods for inferring effects of a continuous predictor on mean expression {{in the presence of}} nuisance covariates. The motivating data are a high-profile dataset which was used to show opposing effects of hedonic and eudaimonic well-being (or happiness) on the mean expression level of a set of genes that has been correlated with social adversity (the CTRA gene set). The original analysis of these data used a linear model (GLS) of fixed effects with correlated error to infer effects of Hedonia and Eudaimonia on mean CTRA expression. Methods The standardized effects of Hedonia and Eudaimonia on CTRA gene set expression estimated by GLS were compared to estimates using multivariate (OLS) linear models and generalized estimating equation (GEE) models. The OLS estimates were tested using O’Brien’s OLS test, Anderson’s permutation ${r}_{F}^{ 2 }$ r F 2 -test, two permutation F-tests (including GlobalAncova), and a rotation z-test (Roast). The GEE estimates were tested using a Wald test with robust standard errors. The performance (Type I, II, S, and M errors) of all tests was investigated using a Monte Carlo simulation of data explicitly modeled on the re-analyzed dataset. Results GLS estimates are inconsistent between data sets, and, in each dataset, at least one coefficient is large and highly statistically significant. By contrast, effects estimated by OLS or GEE are very small, especially relative to the standard errors. Bootstrap and permutation GLS distributions suggest that the GLS results in <b>downward</b> biased standard <b>errors</b> and inflated coefficients. The Monte Carlo simulation of error rates shows highly inflated Type I error from the GLS test and slightly inflated Type I error from the GEE test. By contrast, Type I error for all OLS tests are at the nominal level. The permutation F-tests have ∼ 1. 9 X the power of the other OLS tests. This increased power comes at a cost of high sign error (∼ 10 %) if tested on small effects. Discussion The apparently replicated pattern of well-being effects on gene expression is most parsimoniously explained as “correlated noise” due to the geometry of multiple regression. The GLS for fixed effects with correlated error, or any linear mixed model for estimating fixed effects in designs with many repeated measures or outcomes, should be used cautiously because of the inflated Type I and M error. By contrast, all OLS tests perform well, and the permutation F-tests have superior performance, including moderate power for very small effects...|$|R
