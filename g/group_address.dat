50|$|An IP {{multicast}} <b>group</b> <b>address</b> {{is used by}} {{sources and}} the receivers to send and receive multicast messages. Sources use the <b>group</b> <b>address</b> as the IP destination address in their data packets. Receivers use this <b>group</b> <b>address</b> to inform the network that {{they are interested in}} receiving packets sent to that group. For example, if some content is associated with group 239.1.1.1, the source will send data packets destined to 239.1.1.1. Receivers for that content will inform the network that they are interested in receiving data packets sent to the group 239.1.1.1. The receiver joins 239.1.1.1. The protocol typically used by receivers to join a group is called the Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP).|$|E
50|$|These are all {{examples}} of <b>group</b> <b>addresses,</b> {{as opposed to}} individual addresses; the least significant bit of the first octet of a MAC address distinguishes individual <b>addresses</b> from <b>group</b> <b>addresses.</b> That bit is set to 0 in individual addresses and set to 1 in <b>group</b> <b>addresses.</b> <b>Group</b> <b>addresses,</b> like individual addresses, can be universally administered or locally administered.|$|R
50|$|The IEEE has {{allocated}} {{the address}} block 01-80-C2-00-00-00 to 01-80-C2-FF-FF-FF for <b>group</b> <b>addresses</b> {{for use by}} standard protocols. Of these, the MAC <b>group</b> <b>addresses</b> {{in the range of}} 01-80-C2-00-00-00 to 01-80-C2-00-00-0F are not relayed by MAC bridges conforming to 802.1D.|$|R
50|$|A <b>group</b> <b>addressing</b> {{this problem}} is MANET (Mobile Ad Hoc Network).|$|R
50|$|Key {{concepts}} in IP multicast include an IP multicast <b>group</b> <b>address,</b> a multicast distribution tree and receiver driven tree creation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Group</b> <b>address</b> {{and unknown}} {{destination}} individual frames are optimally transmitted to only {{members of the}} same Ethernet service. IEEE 802.1aq supports the creation of thousands of logical Ethernet services in the form of E-LINE, E-LAN or E-TREE constructs which are formed between non participating logical ports of the IEEE 802.1aq network. These <b>group</b> <b>address</b> packets are encapsulated with a PBB header which indicates the source participating address in the SA while the DA indicates the locally significant <b>group</b> <b>address</b> this frame should be forwarded on and which source bridge originated the frame. The IEEE 802.1aq multicast forwarding tables are created based on computations such that every bridge which is on the shortest path between a pair of bridges which are {{members of the same}} service group will create proper forwarding database (FDB) state to forward or replicate frames it receives to that members of that service group. Since the <b>group</b> <b>address</b> computation produce shortest path trees, there is only ever one copy of a multicast packet on any given link. Since only bridges on a shortest path between participating logical ports create forwarding database (FDB) state the multicast makes the efficient use of network resources.|$|E

50|$|Another form of {{promiscuous}} traffic {{occurs when}} two different applications happen to listen {{on the same}} <b>group</b> <b>address.</b> As the former type of promiscuous traffic (lack of address filtering) {{can be considered a}} bug at the operating system level, the latter reflects global configuration issues.|$|E

50|$|In particular, in {{multicast}} socket networking, {{an example}} of promiscuous traffic is when a socket configured to listen on a specific multicast address group A with a specific port P, noted A:P, receives traffic from A:P but also from another multicast source. For instance, a socket is configured to receive traffic from the multicast <b>group</b> <b>address</b> 234.234.7.70, port 36000 (noted 234.234.7.70:36000), but receives traffic from both 234.234.7.70:36000 and 234.234.7.71:36000.|$|E
50|$|A {{multicast}} address {{is associated with}} a group of interested receivers. In IPv4, addresses 224.0.0.0 through 239.255.255.255 (the former Class D addresses) are designated as {{multicast address}}es. IPv6 uses the address block with the prefix ff00::/8 for multicast applications. In either case, the sender sends a single datagram from its unicast address to the multicast <b>group</b> <b>address</b> and the intermediary routers take care of making copies and sending them to all receivers that have joined the corresponding multicast group.|$|E
50|$|The actual <b>group</b> <b>address</b> {{forwarding}} operation operates {{more or less}} identically {{to classical}} Ethernet, the backbone destination address (B-DA)+ backbone VLAN identifier (B-VID) combination are looked up to find the egress set of next hops. The only difference compared with classical Ethernet is that reverse learning is disabled for participating bridge backbone media access control (B-MAC) addresses and is replaced with an ingress check and discard (when the frame arrives on an incoming interface from an unexpected source). Learning is however implemented {{at the edges of}} the SPBM multicast tree to learn the B-MAC to MAC address relationship for correct individual frame encapsulation in the reverse direction (as packets arrive over the Interface).|$|E

50|$|MSDP uses TCP as its {{transport}} protocol. Each multicast tree has to {{have its}} own RP. All of the RP's are peers (directly or through other MSDP peers). Messages contain Source of Data, <b>Group</b> <b>Address</b> The Data Source Sends To (S,G). If an RP on its own domain receives a message it determines if there are group members on this domain interested in a multicast. If someone is interested it triggers a join towards the data source (into the source domain) in the way of (S, G). In a peering relationship, one MSDP peer listens for new TCP connections on the well-known port 639. MSDP is the protocol for IPv4 and IPv6 Multicast.|$|E
5000|$|A {{service is}} {{assigned}} to a given ECMT B-VID {{at the edge of}} the network by configuration. As a result, non participating packets associated with that service are encapsulated with the VID associated with the desired ECMT end to end path. All individual and <b>group</b> <b>address</b> traffic associated with this service will therefore use the proper ECMT B-VID and be carried symmetrically end to end on the proper equal cost multi path. Essentially the operator decides which services go in which ECMT paths, unlike a hashing solution used in other systems such as IP/MPLS. Trees can support link aggregation (LAG) groups within a tree [...] "branch" [...] segment where some form of hashing occurs.|$|E

50|$|The {{adoption}} of the Statute of Westminster was soon followed by {{the debate on the}} future of the British Commonwealth in its transformation into the Commonwealth of Nations. In April 1949 Ireland, formerly the Irish Free State, declared itself a republic and ceased to be a member of the Commonwealth. Fraser's government reacted by passing the Republic of Ireland Act 1949, which treated Ireland as if it were still a member of the Commonwealth. Meanwhile, newly independent India would have to leave the Commonwealth on becoming a republic also, although it was the Indian Prime Minister's view that India should remain a member of the Commonwealth as a republic. Fraser believed that the Commonwealth could as a <b>group</b> <b>address</b> the evils of colonialism and maintain the solidarity of common defence.|$|E
50|$|In SPBM, the Backbone MAC (B-MAC) {{addresses}} {{of the participating}} nodes and also the service membership information for interfaces to non-participating devices (user network interface (UNI) ports) is distributed. Topology data is then input to a calculation engine which computes symmetric shortest path trees based on minimum cost from each participating node to all other participating nodes. In SPBV these trees provide a shortest path tree where individual MAC address can be learned and <b>Group</b> <b>Address</b> membership can be distributed. In SPBM the shortest path trees are then used to populate forwarding tables for each participating node's individual B-MAC addresses and for Group addresses; Group multicast trees are sub trees of the default shortest path tree formed by (Source, Group) pairing. Depending on the topology several different equal cost multi path trees are possible and SPB supports multiple algorithms per IS-IS instance.|$|E
50|$|Multicasting, the {{transmission}} of a packet to multiple destinations in a single send operation, {{is part of the}} base specification in IPv6. In IPv4 this is an optional although commonly implemented feature. IPv6 multicast addressing shares common features and protocols with IPv4 multicast, but also provides changes and improvements by eliminating the need for certain protocols. IPv6 does not implement traditional IP broadcast, i.e. {{the transmission}} of a packet to all hosts on the attached link using a special broadcast address, and therefore does not define broadcast addresses. In IPv6, the same result can be achieved by sending a packet to the link-local all nodes multicast group at address ff02::1, which is analogous to IPv4 multicasting to address 224.0.0.1. IPv6 also provides for new multicast implementations, including embedding rendezvous point addresses in an IPv6 multicast <b>group</b> <b>address,</b> which simplifies the deployment of inter-domain solutions.|$|E
