5000|$|Because analog VHF {{transmission}} used a bandwidth of 7 MHz, but <b>digital</b> <b>transmissions</b> need 8 MHz, {{the frequencies}} are shifted accordingly, with one channel being unavailable for <b>digital</b> <b>transmission.</b> Due to the {{proximity to the}} FM radio band, some cable networks have opted to further shifting the frequencies by one megahertz.|$|R
40|$|To {{solve the}} problem of the high cost in the GPRS {{communication}} and the limit transmission distance of WiFi, a transmission scheme for distant agriculture image acquisition was designed based on <b>digital</b> <b>transmission</b> radio in this paper. However, the majority of current <b>digital</b> <b>transmission</b> radio was designed for a small amount of data transmission. It could get a greater transmission distance {{with the help of the}} <b>digital</b> <b>transmission</b> radio, but the signal interference increased heavily when the <b>digital</b> <b>transmission</b> radio was used for image transmission. A fault-tolerant transmission protocol for agriculture image (FTTP-AI) based on <b>digital</b> <b>transmission</b> radio was designed in this paper. Packet verification was used to reduce the data errors caused by the signal interference of the <b>digital</b> <b>transmission</b> radio. At the same time, overtime retransmission and the lost packet retransmission were used to overcome the problem of packet loss. Experiments showed that the FTTP-AI could send the agriculture image to a remote computer center successfully in the field. With the help of the FTTP-AI, the rate of accuracy of data transmission was up to 99. 2 %, the success rate of image transmission was up to 95. 8 %, the costless distant transmission can achieve several kilometers. This scheme could satisfy the requirement of the low-cost for distant agriculture images transmission reliably.  ...|$|R
