5|$|The race {{began in}} November 1998 when four-term {{incumbent}} New York Senator <b>Daniel</b> <b>Patrick</b> <b>Moynihan</b> announced his retirement. Both the Democratic Party and Republican Party sought high-profile candidates {{to compete for}} the open seat. By early 1999 Clinton and Mayor of New York City Rudolph Giuliani were the likely respective nominees. Clinton and her husband, President Bill Clinton, purchased a house in Chappaqua, New York, in September 1999; she thereby became eligible for the election, although she faced characterizations of carpetbagging since she had never resided in the state before. The lead in statewide polls swung from Clinton to Giuliani and back to Clinton as the campaigns featured both successful strategies and mistakes as well as dealing with current events. In late April and May 2000, Giuliani's medical, romantic, marital, and political lives all collided in a tumultuous four-week period, culminating in his withdrawing from the race on May 19.|$|E

5|$|When New York's long-serving U.S. Senator <b>Daniel</b> <b>Patrick</b> <b>Moynihan</b> {{announced}} his retirement in November 1998, several prominent Democratic figures, including Representative Charles Rangel of New York, urged Clinton to run for Moynihan's open seat in the Senate election of 2000. Once she decided to run, the Clintons purchased a home in Chappaqua, New York, north of New York City, in September 1999. She became the first First Lady of the United States to {{be a candidate for}} elected office. Initially, Clinton expected to face Rudy Giuliani (the mayor of New York City) as her Republican opponent in the election. Giuliani withdrew from the race in May 2000 after he was diagnosed with prostate cancer and matters related to his failing marriage became public and Clinton instead faced Rick Lazio, a Republican member of the U.S. House of Representatives representing New York's 2nd congressional district. Throughout the campaign, opponents accused Clinton of carpetbagging, as she had never resided in New York nor participated in the state's politics before the 2000 Senate race.|$|E

Assistant Secretary of Labor <b>Daniel</b> <b>Patrick</b> <b>Moynihan</b> was assigned to help staff the committee.

25|$|On September 5, {{two weeks}} after the riot had been controlled, Anthony Graziosi, an Italian sales {{representative}} with a white beard dressed in dark business attire, was driving in the neighborhood. As he stopped at a traffic light at 11pm, six blocks away from where Yankel Rosenbaum had been murdered, a group of four black men surrounded his car and one of them shot and killed him. It was alleged by Graziosi's family and their attorney, as well as Senator Al D'Amato, Senator <b>Daniel</b> <b>Patrick</b> <b>Moynihan,</b> State Attorney General Robert Abrams, former Mayor Ed Koch, and a number of advocacy organizations, that Graziosi's resemblance to a Hasidic Jew precipitated his murder. The New York Police Department, Mayor Dinkins, newspaper columnist Mike McAlary, and the U.S. Justice Department did not agree. The murder was not treated as a bias crime.|$|E
