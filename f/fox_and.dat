40|$|In {{its current}} {{distribution}} and abundance, the swift fox (Vulpes velox) has been significantly reduced from its historic range. A possible cause is competition with, and predation by, coyotes (Canis latrans). We investigated {{the level of}} spatial, temporal, and dietary resource use overlap between swift <b>foxes</b> <b>and</b> coyotes at the Pinon Canyon Maneuver Site in southeastern Colorado. We captured <b>and</b> radio-tracked 73 <b>foxes</b> <b>and</b> 24 coyotes from April 1997 to August 1998. We collected 10 832 and 5350 locations of <b>foxes</b> <b>and</b> coyotes, respectively. Overall, home-range sizes of <b>foxes</b> <b>and</b> coyotes were 7. 6 ± 0. 5 (mean ± SE) and 19. 8 ± 1. 9 km 2, respectively. A high degree of interspecies spatial overlap was apparent, with fox home ranges being overlapped by coyote home ranges {{by as much as}} 100...|$|R

5|$|DNA {{analysis}} {{shows that the}} first three form monophyletic clades. The wolf-like canids and the South American canids together form the tribe Canini. Molecular data imply a North American origin of living Canidae some ten million years ago and an African origin of wolf-like canines (Canis, Cuon, and Lycaon), with the jackals being the most basal of this group. The South American clade is rooted by the maned wolf and bush dog, and the fox-like canids by the fennec <b>fox</b> <b>and</b> Blanford's fox. The grey <b>fox</b> <b>and</b> island fox are basal to the other clades; however, this topological difference is not strongly supported.|$|E
