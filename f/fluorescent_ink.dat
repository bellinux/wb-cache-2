Under the D 65 illuminant we establish in the CIELAB space the gamut of a classical cmyk printer and the gamut of the same printer {{using a combination of}} classical <b>inks</b> with daylight <b>fluorescent</b> <b>inks.</b> These gamuts show that {{a significant part of the}} classical ink gamut can be reproduced by combining classical <b>inks</b> with daylight <b>fluorescent</b> <b>inks.</b> By printing parts of images with a combination of classical and daylight <b>fluorescent</b> <b>inks</b> instead of using classical inks only, we can hide security patterns within printed images. Under normal daylight, we do not see any difference between the parts printed with classical inks only and the parts printed with daylight <b>fluorescent</b> <b>inks</b> and classical inks. By changing the illumination, e. g. by viewing the printed image under a tungsten lamp or under a UV lamp, the daylight <b>fluorescent</b> <b>inks</b> change their colors and reveal the security pattern formed by combinations of classical inks and of daylight <b>fluorescent</b> <b>inks...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. pH {{value of}} <b>fluorescent</b> ink-jet <b>ink</b> has an obvious {{influence}} on fluorescent powder, {{high or low}} pH value could cause some problems, such as fluorescence quenches, fluorescent quantum yield decreased, and so on.

50|$|Various factors {{contributed to}} the {{development}} of the bumper sticker. Developments in material manufacturing during World War II led to the widespread use of daylight <b>fluorescent</b> <b>inks,</b> which were created by Bob Switzer and his brother Joe. These inks appeared to glow during the daytime and were useful to support various wartime activities; they were favored by early bumper sticker manufacturers after the war. In addition, the first commercially produced pressure-sensitive stickers appeared after World War II; new developments in adhesive materials led to the production of paper strips with adhesive on the back. In addition, the rise of consumer use of vinyl after World War II led to the eventual use of this material in bumper stickers.|$|R
40|$|The {{number of}} {{possible}} reproducible colors in a printing method is called the color gamut. This gamut is the range of colors around the spectrum and from light to dark that {{are available in the}} process. Previous research has found that the three parameters, spectral reflectance of the ink, solid ink density level and screening method, all influence the gamut in process color printing. This thesis evaluated how much these parameters change the color gamut both as individual parameters and in combination. A test target with 168 patches in the most saturated combinations of cyan, magenta, yellow and black was printed and measured with a spectrophotometer. The three coordinates L*, a* and b* for each patch in the target was plotted in the CIELAB space. Connecting these points forms a three dimensional object, the color gamut volume. By calculating the volume of this object the number of CIELAB combinations that can be reproduced in the system was derived. The pressrun was made at three levels of solid ink density and the targets were screened using frequency and amplitude modulated screening. The print was made on the six color Heidelberg Speedmaster 72 sheet fed lithography press at School of Printing Management and Science, Rochester Institute of Technology. The inks that were used in the test print are the Naturalith process cyan, magenta, yellow and black from Sun Chemical. In addition to these, a fluorescent magenta and yellow ink from DayGlo 2 ̆ 7 s ink series Starfire were used. These alternative magenta and yellow inks were printed with the Naturalith cyan and black. In this way two four color process combinations were evaluated with only six inks. The prints where made on a glossy coated paper, Centura Gloss from Consolidated Paper Inc. The result show that: <b>Fluorescent</b> <b>inks</b> can be used in process color printing and that they produced a color gamut that reproduce light and more colorful colors than normal process colors, while dark colors were reproduced with lower colorfulness. The <b>fluorescent</b> <b>inks</b> that were used are semi transparent and can not yield a dark black when printed on top of black. The solution is to use a high degree of under color removal and or to printing black as the last down ink. High solid ink densities was found to increase the color gamut for both ink sets. Frequency modulated screening was found to reproduce a color gamut with significantly higher gamut for the normal sheet fed inks, while no increase could be found for the <b>fluorescent</b> <b>inks.</b> By using frequency modulated screening and increasing the solid ink density when using normal sheet fed ink, the color gamut could be increased about 30 percent compared to amplitude modulated screening and SWOP solid ink densities. The Silicon Graphics based 3 D software Explorer was found to be a very useful tool when determining the shape of the color gamut...|$|R

50|$|Tattoo removal is most {{commonly}} performed using lasers that {{break down the}} ink particles in the tattoo. The broken-down ink is then fought off by the immune system, mimicking the natural fading that time or sun exposure would create. All tattoo pigments have specific light absorption spectra. A tattoo laser must be capable of emitting adequate energy within the given absorption spectrum of the pigment to provide an effective treatment. Certain tattoo pigments, such as yellows and <b>fluorescent</b> <b>inks</b> are more challenging to treat than darker blacks and blues, because they have absorption spectra that fall outside or {{on the edge of}} the emission spectra available in the tattoo removal laser. Recent pastel coloured inks contain high concentrations of titanium dioxide which is highly reflective. Consequently, such inks are difficult to remove since they reflect a significant amount of the incident light energy out of the skin.|$|R

These colors are printed {{with a combination of}} classical cmyk inks and the two additional daylight fluorescent magenta and yellow inks. The goal is to enhance image parts by printing them with high chroma and bright colors. We first select the image parts to be enhanced. We then apply to their colors a gamut expansion that increases both their chroma and their lightness towards the colors located at the boundary of the gamut formed by the combination of classical and <b>fluorescent</b> <b>inks.</b> This expansion can be controlled by user-defined parameters. We create smooth chroma transitions between the expanded and nonexpanded image parts. We also preview the printable gamut expanded image generated according to user-defined gamut expansion parameters.

40|$|Smart {{packaging}} {{is becoming}} more popular on world market as {{a new type of}} packaging able to react to changes in a packaged product during storage and informs a customer about the safety of consumption of packaged food. This article investigates the main technological issues of the use of nanophotonic printing inks based on ZnO/SiO 2 nanoparticles and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) for printing active elements of smart packaging on paper substrates, concerning material properties and parameters of screen printing. It is determined that the use of ink compositions with medium content of ZnO/SiO 2 nanoparticles allows obtaining blue-green and blue shades of luminescence color of screen printed images by changing ink layer thickness on papers with different contents of optical brightness agents (OBAs). The minimum content of ZnO/SiO 2 nanoparticles in the developed <b>fluorescent</b> <b>inks</b> leads to blue luminescence colors regardless the contents of OBAs of the papers and ink layer thickness. The luminescence intensity is directly proportional to ink layer thickness and partly depends on the content of OBAs in the selected paper. In order to fabricate nanophotonic elements of smart packaging with predetermined photoluminescence properties, the influence of investigated factors on photoluminescence properties of printed nanophotonic labels should be taken into account...|$|R
