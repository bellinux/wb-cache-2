They bought a semi-detached house called Mendips—named after {{the range of}} hills—at 251 Menlove Avenue, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>middle</b> class area of Liverpool. Menlove Avenue {{suffered}} extensive damage during World War II, {{and she said that}} she often had to throw a wet blanket on incendiary bombs that fell in the garden. During the war the government took over the Smiths' farmland for war work, and Smith was called up for service, but was discharged three years later, working in an aircraft factory in Speke {{until the end of the}} war. Smith later left the milk trade and started a small bookmaker's business, which led Mimi to complain later that he was a compulsive gambler, and had lost most of their money.|$|E

25|$|Robert Mannyng (1264–1340) is {{credited}} with putting the speech of the ordinary people of his time into recognisable form.

His Handlyng Synne is acknowledged to be of great value for the glimpses it gives into the ways and thoughts of his contemporaries and shows us the language then in common use.|$|E

25|$|Noteworthy was the {{adoption}} of European-style woven wool clothes kept together by pins and buttons {{in contrast to the}} earlier usage of clothing made of leather and plant fibres. Two-aisled timber houses in Late Neolithic Denmark correspond to similar houses in southern Scandinavia and at least parts of central Scandinavia and lowland northern Germany. In Denmark, this mode of building houses is clearly rooted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>Middle</b> Neolithic tradition. In general, Late Neolithic house building styles were shared over large areas of northern and central Europe. Towards the transition to LN II some farm houses became extraordinarily large.|$|E
25|$|Collins, {{the son of}} {{a cattle}} dealer, grew up <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>middle</b> class Irish family in Camlough, a small, staunchly Irish republican town in South Armagh. Despite the {{sentiment}} of the area, the Collins family had no association and little interest in Irish Nationalist politics. Collins' mother was devout Catholic, and he was brought up under her influence with a sense of awe for the martyrs of that religion in Irish history, in its conflicts with Protestantism.After completing his schooling, Collins worked for a time in the Ministry of Defence in a clerical capacity in London before studying Law at Queen's University, where he became influenced by Marxist political ideology.|$|E

After graduation from middle school, Qichang went to another city with his parents, so they separated. But they continued their relationship by mail. Lanying and Qichang had different dreams about future. Qichang told Lanying {{that he wanted to}} marry her in the future and they could work as teachers <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>middle</b> school. However, Lanying was more ambitious. So when time went by, they stopped writing to each other. At the age of 17, Qichang died due to leukemia.|$|E

25|$|Newman {{believed}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>middle</b> {{way between}} free thinking and moral authority – {{one that would}} respect the rights of knowledge {{as well as the}} rights of revelation. His purpose was to build a Catholic university, in a world where the major Catholic universities on the European continent had recently been secularised, and most universities in the English-speaking world were Protestant. For a university to claim legitimacy in the larger world, it would have to support research and publication free from church censorship; however, for a university to be a safe place for the education of Catholic youth, {{it would have to be}} a place in which the teachings of the Catholic church were respected and promoted.|$|E
25|$|October 31: Three days {{following}} {{the conclusion of the}} 2011 World Series, the Braves began to make some organizational roster moves. In the first trade of the offseason in the Major Leagues, the Braves traded struggling starting pitcher Derek Lowe to the Cleveland Indians in return for High-A lefty reliever Chris Jones. In addition, the Indians agreed to pay $5 million of Lowe's guaranteed $15 million salary in 2012. Lowe served as the Atlanta Braves' Opening Day starter in 2009, 2010, and 2011. Due to his struggles in 2011, however, Lowe likely would have merely served <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>middle</b> relief role for the bullpen in 2012. On the same day, the Braves announced that they had declined the $10.65 million option for center fielder Nate McLouth, ending his lackluster tenure as an Atlanta Brave. McLouth later signed a one-year contract to return to the Pittsburgh Pirates on December 7. Additionally, the Braves decided to exercise the $1.5 million option for utility man Eric Hinske, assuring his return for the 2012 season.|$|E
25|$|On 24 December (Christmas Eve), {{there was}} {{a party at the}} flat. A petty criminal, John Fisher, who knew Ryan, and Arthur Henderson (Aitken's boyfriend) were there. After all their beer had been consumed, Walker and Henderson left to find sly-grog in Albert Park for more drinks. An hour later Walker {{returned}} alone to the flat. He had killed Henderson <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>Middle</b> Park toilet block. Henderson was shot {{in the back of his}} head by Walker. The escapees left the flat and returned to Kensington. On 26 December, Aitken and another woman were charged with harbouring the criminals. They came forward after Henderson was killed and the escapees had left. The charges were later dropped. The pair returned to hiding in the basement of the house in Kensington. Murray was given money to buy a car in Sydney and return with it. Murray returned with the car with Queensland plates on 31 December (New Year's Eve). Ryan and Walker left for Sydney on 1 January 1966 (New Year's Day) and arrived on 2 January.|$|E
