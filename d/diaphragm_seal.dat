50|$|The problem {{occurs when}} small {{concentrations}} of ozone gas are present near to exposed elastomer surfaces, such as O-rings and <b>diaphragm</b> <b>seals.</b> The product {{must be in}} tension, but only very low strains are sufficient to cause degradation.|$|R
50|$|<b>Diaphragm</b> <b>seals</b> are {{susceptible}} to failure via several mechanisms, including cracking. Ozone cracking can occur in many elastomers for example used in pneumatic systems. If the gas contaminates the air supply, then many rubber diaphragms are at risk from the problem.|$|R
50|$|Since <b>diaphragm</b> <b>seals</b> need to {{be highly}} flexible, {{elastomers}} are commonly used, and include {{a wide variety of}} both general purpose and speciality rubbers.

40|$|World market {{pressures}} {{demand that}} corporations continually bring new and innovative products to market {{as rapidly as}} possible. Traditional build and test product development methods in today’s competitive markets are too slow, costly, and rarely yield optimized robust product designs. Complex large deflection patterns of rubber diaphragm seals combined with non-linear contact and material behaviors are difficult to calculate utilizing classical methods. Non-linear, Hyper-Elastic contact analysis capabilities found in finite element analysis programs like ANSYS, combined with fast workstations now allow engineers to rapidly evaluate and optimize rubber <b>diaphragm</b> <b>seal</b> designs prior to committing to costly prototypes and tooling. Presented is the non-linear finite element analysis of a rubber <b>diaphragm</b> <b>seal</b> utilizied in a pushbutton design. Analysis considerations encompassed, nonlinear hyper-elastic material behavior of the rubber, large deflection analysis of seal complex motion, and contact analysis with mating parts. Design parameters of primary interest were, seal deflection patterns and seal actuation force {{as a function of}} travel. Technologies like finite element analysis {{play an important role in}} bringing robust new products of the highest quality to global customers.

40|$|Liquid lead-lithium (Pb- 16 Li) is {{of primary}} {{interest}} {{as one of}} the candidate materials for tritium breeder, neutron multiplier and coolant fluid in liquid metal blanket concepts relevant to fusion power plants. For an effective and reliable operation of such high temperature liquid metal systems, monitoring and control of critical process parameters is essential. However, limited operational experience coupled with high temperature operating conditions and corrosive nature of Pb- 16 Li severely limits application of commercially available diagnostic tools. This paper illustrates indigenous calibration test facility designs and experimental methods used to develop non-contact configuration level diagnostics using pulse radar level sensor, wetted configuration pressure diagnostics using <b>diaphragm</b> <b>seal</b> type pressure sensor and bulk temperature diagnostics with temperature profiling for high temperature, high pressure liquid Pb and Pb- 16 Li applications. Calibration check of these sensors was performed using analytical methods, at temperature between 380 C- 400 C and pressure upto 1 MPa (g). Reliability and performance validation were achieved through long duration testing of sensors in liquid Pb and liquid Pb- 16 Li environment for over 1000 hour. Estimated deviation for radar level sensor lies within [- 3. 36 mm, + 13. 64 mm] and the estimated error for pressure sensor lies within 1. 1 % of calibrated span over the entire test duration. Results obtained and critical observations from these tests are presented in this paper. Comment: 09 Pages, 19 Figures, 02 Table...|$|E
50|$|Pressure gauges: If the {{pressure}} of aggressive fluids or gases has to be measured, the gauge has to be isolated from the flow.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a new compact {{hydraulic}} linear actuator. The concept is developed to change the rolling piston diameter of an active air spring during usage. By doing so, the air spring can actively apply pressure and tension forces. The actuator is designed for small movements at high forces. It is insensitive to side forces, which are introduced by the bellows rolling on the rolling piston of the air spring. A <b>diaphragm</b> <b>sealing</b> is used to minimize friction. Hence a precise adjustment of small displacements at high dynamics is possible and the system is completely leakage-free. We describe the design and development of this actuator and show first measurement results from preliminary tests to show its functionality...|$|R

In accordance with the present invention, an explosive material is loaded into a chamber. A <b>diaphragm</b> <b>seals</b> the chamber, containing a plasma material. The explosive material is subsequently heated to its ignition temperature thereby raising the pressure in the chamber until the diaphragm ruptures. The rupture of the diaphragm results {{in the flow of}} plasma out of the chamber. Upon exiting the chamber, the plasma is forced to flow between two parallel rectangular electrodes. A magnetic field is applied in a direction orthogonal to both the plasma flow and the electrodes, thereby generating an electromagnetic field sufficient to a power source for MEMS devices...|$|R

25|$|Lubricants {{can also}} clog heat exchangers, {{especially}} the regenerator. For these reasons, designers prefer non-lubricated, low-coefficient of friction materials (such as rulon or graphite), with low normal {{forces on the}} moving parts, especially for sliding seals.

40|$|LecturePg. 77 - 90 Clearances between sealing {{devices of}} {{rotating}} and stationary components of turbomachinery {{have always been}} important to engineers in controlling gas leakages. One way of accomplishing this is {{by the use of}} abradable seals which reduces clearances and limits the risk of damage to the rotating/stationary member if a rub occurs. The program presented evaluates various candidate abradable materials through performance in a test rig and the development of the final process parameters. The results of the tests indicated that for centrifugal compressor applications, the mica filled tetrafluoroethylene (TFE), silicone rubber, aluminum polyester and nickel graphite are all acceptable materials for abradable seals. Temperature limits were specified for each of these materials. For steam turbines, nickel chromium and nickel graphite are suitable and, again, temperature limits were specified. Application of abradable seals to centrifugal compressors has shown efficiency improvements of up to 0. 5 percent per stage for high flow machines, and up to 2. 5 percent per stage for low flow machines. Performance improvements in excess of two percent have been calculated for noncondensing steam turbines utilizing abradable materials in shaft end packing, blade tip and stage <b>diaphragm</b> <b>seals...</b>|$|R
50|$|Ozone cracks form in {{products}} under tension, but the critical strain is very small. The cracks are always oriented {{at right angles}} to the strain axis, so will form around the circumference in a rubber tube bent over. Such cracks are very dangerous when they occur in fuel pipes because the cracks will grow from the outside exposed surfaces into the bore of the pipe, so fuel leakage and fire may follow. Seals are also susceptible to attack, such as <b>diaphragm</b> <b>seals</b> in air lines. Such seals are often critical for the operation of pneumatic controls, and if a crack penetrates the seal, all functions of the system can be lost. Nitrile rubber seals are commonly used in pneumatic systems because of its oil resistance. However, if ozone gas is present, cracking will occur in the seals unless preventative measures are taken.Ozone attack will occur at the most sensitive zones in a seal, especially sharp corners where the strain is greatest when the seal is flexing in use. The corners represent stress concentrations, so the tension is at a maximum when the <b>diaphragm</b> of the <b>seal</b> is bent under air pressure.The seal shown at left failed from traces of ozone at circa 1 ppm, and once cracking had started, it continued as long as the gas was present. This particular failure led to loss of production on a semi-conductor fabrication line. The problem was solved by adding effective filters in the air line and by modifying the design to eliminate the very sharp corners. An ozone-resistant elastomer such as Viton was also considered as a replacement for the Nitrile rubber. The pictures were taken using ESEM for maximum resolution.|$|R

Techniques used to reduce transmission of sound through the walls of the cabinet include thicker cabinet walls, lossy wall material, internal bracing, curved cabinet walls—or more rarely, visco-elastic materials (e.g., mineral-loaded bitumen) or thin lead sheeting applied to the interior enclosure walls.|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} the gas-particle dynamics of a device designed for biological pre-clinical experiments. The device uses transonic/supersonic gas flow to accelerate microparticles {{such that they}} penetrate the outer skin layers. By using a shock tube coupled to a correctly expanded nozzle, a quasi-one-dimensional, quasi-steady flow (QSF) is produced to uniformly accelerate the microparticles. The system utilises a microparticle cassette (a <b>diaphragm</b> <b>sealed</b> container) that incorporates a jet mixing mechanism to stir the particles prior to diaphragm rupture. Pressure measurements reveal that a QSF exit period - suitable for uniformly accelerating microparticles - exists between 155 and 220 mus after diaphragm rupture. Immediately preceding the QSF period, a starting process secondary shock was shown to form with its (x,t) trajectory comparing well to theoretical estimates. To characterise the microparticle, flow particle image velocimetry experiments were conducted at the nozzle exit, using particle payloads with varying diameter (2. 7 - 48 mu m), density (600 - 16, 800 kg/m(3)) and mass (0. 25 - 10 mg). The resultant microparticle velocities were temporally uniform. The experiments also show that the starting process does not significantly influence the microparticle nozzle exit velocities. The velocity distribution across the nozzle exit was also uniform {{for the majority of}} microparticle types tested. For payload masses typically used in pre-clinical drug and vaccine applications...|$|R
40|$|An airtight, {{flexible}} joint is disclosed for the interfacing of two pressure vessels such as between the Space Station docking tunnel and the Space Shuttle Orbiter bulkhead adapter. The joint provides for flexibility while still retaining a structural {{link between the}} two vessels required due to the loading created by the internal/external pressure differential. The joint design provides for limiting the axial load carried across the joint to a specific value, a function returned in the Orbiter/Station tunnel interface. The flex joint comprises a floating structural segment which is permanently attached {{to one of the}} pressure vessels through the use of an inflatable seal. The geometric configuration of the joint causes the tension between the vessels created by the internal gas pressure to compress the inflatable seal. The inflation pressure of the seal is kept at a value above the internal/external pressure differential of the vessels in order to maintain a controlled distance between the floating segment and pressure vessel. The inflatable seal consists of either a hollow torus-shaped flexible bladder or two rolling convoluted <b>diaphragm</b> <b>seals</b> which may be reinforced by a system of straps or fabric anchored to the hard structures. The joint acts as a flexible link to allow both angular motion and lateral displacement while it still contains the internal pressure and holds the axial tension between the vessels...|$|R

To fire the gun, a solenoid-driven needle struck and ruptured the diaphragm, allowing the compressed air to drive the chicken (in its container—a cylindrical cardboard ice cream carton) down the barrel.

40|$|One of {{the main}} sources of {{efficiency}} loss in heat engines is the inability of a sinusoidally displaced piston engines to approx-imate the ideal heat volumetric cycles the engines require.
