The method referred to here is that of towing (German: treideln or any number of other terms such as treilen, trekken, jagen, bomätschen, etc., depending on the region), briefly defined in the sub-title above. A detailed discussion of the term treideln is followed by the identification and evaluation of historically relevant sources. The picture credits are divided into five sections: early towing in Europe (antiquity, Middle Ages); horse-powered towing in the Netherlands (17 th - 20 th centuries) with particular regard to the transport of passengers and mail by <b>inland</b> <b>waterway</b> <b>vessel,</b> a method that was highly advanced in that region and attained major significance under the designation "Trekvaart"; towing in East Friesland, Germany (19 th - 20 th centuries) and its special forms: the Ems River form, inland village and "Fehn" navigation (Fehn being the term for linear settlements built along canals in the high moor areas) as well as the (short-lived) "Treckfahrt" between cities; "Die schwere Arbeit" (hard work) : reproductions of scenes from various cultures depicting towing by manpower: artistic interpretations which are often quite moving and in some cases also socio-critically expressive; several depictions of European horse-powered towing carried out in otherwise unusual dimensions.

40|$|Future {{climate change}} is {{expected}} to affect <b>inland</b> <b>waterway</b> transport in most main natural waterways in Europe. For the river Rhine it is expected that, in summer, more and longer periods with low water levels will occur. In periods of low water levels <b>inland</b> <b>waterway</b> <b>vessels</b> have to reduce their load factors and, as a result, transport prices per tonne will increase. One possible consequence of these higher transport prices is a deterioration of the competitive position of <b>inland</b> <b>waterway</b> transport compared with rail and road transport, and thus a change in modal split. We study this issue using a GIS-based software model called NODUS which provides a tool for the detailed analysis of freight transportation over extensive multimodal networks.

The operational area considered is a small lake in northern Italy with a mild climate, and consequently with a quite moderate environmental demand acting on the vessel. Moreover, the peculiar service suggests the adoption of eco-friendly solutions to provide power for both propulsion and on-board use. Specifically, a series hybrid power system has been set up: the electric energy is generated by different sources, and stored in batteries; two electric motors drive each propeller shaft directly. Even if such a system calls for higher costs of purchase and maintenance, it offers a very appreciable low environmental impact in terms of fuel consumption, noise and gas emissions.

40|$|Nowadays {{predicting}} {{transportation costs}} {{is more and}} more important. Most significant part of inland navigation's costs are the costs of fuel.

On <b>inland</b> <b>waterways</b> the ship resistance is strictly related to the depth of the waterway. There is a tendency to build a formula that allows its user to calculate the resistance of any <b>inland</b> <b>waterway</b> <b>vessel,</b> but researches claim that most of them are accurate only for particular types of ships and/or operating conditions. The paper presents selected methods of calculating ship resistance on <b>inland</b> <b>waterways.</b> These methods are examined for different types of ships and different conditions using results of model tests. The performed comparison enabled selecting the best option for pushboats and pushed barge trains, but also showed that any of the tested methods is good enough to be used for calculating the resistance of motor cargo vessels.
