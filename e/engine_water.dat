5|$|The {{electric}} {{fire engine}} would have several advantages over the steam fire engine. One {{was that an}} electric fire engine could be brought eto full power immediately, whereas a steam fire engine took time. It was necessary to keep the fire going {{all the time to}} boil the water on a steam pump vehicle, with workmen furnishing coal for it. This was required so that as little time as possible was lost getting the water to boil to produce steam to run the water pump to extinguish the fire. In the case of an electric motor running a fire <b>engine</b> <b>water</b> pump, its operation was basically instantaneous since the motor was running at full power capacity when the switch was turned on. The advantage of using electricity was its lower cost overall, (i.e. no coal or extensive maintenance) and simplicity of operation.|$|E

I increased the throttle to little effect and then started {{to look for a}} safe landing place, but the area was full of high trees and houses. I increased the throttle and was able to hold height {{for a few minutes and}} then noticed the <b>engine</b> <b>water</b> temperature was over 100 degrees Celsius and I could see steam from the left hand engine cowling. The engine lost power again and I saw a chance to land in some allotments, I pushed the control down to 45 degrees and hit the ground at the same angle. I was trapped by my foot and released myself after about two minutes, as I freed myself the engine caught fire. I managed to get to the door of the cabin and only one of the passengers was conscious." ...|$|E

2500|$|The tunnel was 2,966 yard (2712m) long, [...] wide at water level, and [...] {{from water}} to soffit (depending {{on the water}} level). At the time of {{building}} {{it was the third}} longest canal tunnel in the World after Sapperton and Dudley. Thirty-three shafts were sunk during construction with the workings dewatered using a Woodhouse steam <b>engine.</b> <b>Water</b> was provided for the Cromford Canal from the [...] Butterley Reservoir situated on the hill above the tunnel. The Butterley Reservoir is itself crossed by a stone railway embankment currently used by the locomotives of the Midland Railway - Butterley's preserved steam railway. Water flowed from the reservoir directly into the tunnel via an adit [...] along the tunnel from the Western Portal. Above the Eastern portal the Butterley Park Reservoir once provided water to the canal. This Reservoir was filled in during 1935. Both the tunnel and reservoirs were constructed by the Butterley Company, formed in 1790 by Benjamin Outram (1764–1805) and Francis Beresford (died 1801) with William Jessop (1745–1814) and John Wright (1758–1840) joining by 1793.|$|E

50|$|Because {{water is}} incompressible, the valve gear of <b>water</b> <b>engines</b> is more {{complicated}} than that used in steam <b>engines,</b> and some <b>water</b> <b>engines</b> even had a small secondary engine solely to power the operation of their valves. Closing a valve too quickly can cause very large pressures to result, and pipework to explode (a phenomenon similar to water hammer), and in addition to valves designed to close slowly, many <b>water</b> <b>engines</b> used air chambers to provide some absorption of force by compressing the air in them.|$|R
5000|$|In {{internal}} combustion <b>engines,</b> <b>water</b> injection, {{also known as}} anti-detonant injection (ADI), can spray water into the incoming air or fuel-air mixture, or directly into the cylinder to cool {{certain parts of the}} induction system where [...] "hot points" [...] could produce premature ignition. In jet engines it increases engine thrust at low speeds and at takeoff.|$|R
