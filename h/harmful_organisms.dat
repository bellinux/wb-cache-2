25|$|Large-scale urban UV {{wastewater}} treatment is performed in {{cities such as}} Edmonton, Alberta. The use of ultraviolet light has now become standard practice in most municipal {{wastewater treatment}} processes. Effluent is now starting to be recognized as a valuable resource, not a problem that needs to be dumped. Many wastewater facilities are being renamed as water reclamation facilities, whether the wastewater is discharged into a river, used to irrigate crops, or injected into an aquifer for later recovery.

25|$|Sulfonamide {{drugs were}} the first {{antibiotics}} to be used systemically, and {{paved the way for}} the antibiotic revolution in medicine. The first sulfonamide, trade-named Prontosil, was a prodrug. Experiments with Prontosil began in 1932 in the laboratories of Bayer AG, at that time a component of the huge German chemical trust IG Farben. The Bayer team believed that coal-tar dyes which are able to bind preferentially to bacteria and parasites might be used to attack <b>harmful</b> <b>organisms</b> in the body. After years of fruitless trial-and-error work on hundreds of dyes, a team led by physician/researcher Gerhard Domagk (working under the general direction of Farben executive Heinrich Hörlein) finally found one that worked: a red dye synthesized by Bayer chemist Josef Klarer that had remarkable effects on stopping some bacterial infections in mice. The first official communication about the breakthrough discovery was not published until 1935, more than two years after the drug was patented by Klarer and his research partner Fritz Mietzsch.|$|E

2500|$|Marine Biofouling is {{described}} as the undesirable buildup of microorganisms, plants, and animals on artificial surfaces immersed in water. Significant buildup of biofouling on marine vessels can be problematic. Traditionally, biocides, a chemical substance or microorganism that can control the growth of <b>harmful</b> <b>organisms</b> by chemical or biological means, are used {{in order to prevent}} marine biofouling. Biocides can be either synthetic, such as tributyltin (TBT), [...] or natural, which are derived from bacteria or plants. TBT was historically the main biocide used for anti-fouling coatings, but more recently TBT compounds have been considered toxic chemicals which have negative effects on human and environment, and have been banned by the International Maritime Organization. The early design of anti-fouling coatings consisted of the active ingredients (e.g. TBT) dispersed in the coating in which they [...] "leached" [...] into the sea water, killing any microbes or other marine life that had attached to the ship. The release rate for the biocide however tended to be uncontrolled and often rapid, leaving the coating only effective for 18 to 24 months before all the biocide leached out of the coating.|$|E

30|$|As {{mentioned}} above, branch heartwood contained greater {{quantities of}} active extracts, hexane and ethyl acetate extracts, than trunk heartwood. Therefore, the branch heartwood of hinoki is likely {{more resistant to}} wood decaying fungi and other attacking organisms to hinoki than its trunk heartwood. Moreover, it would be also considered that these effects are protecting hinoki branch against wide spectrum of <b>harmful</b> <b>organism</b> in the living hinoki tree {{from the viewpoint of}} chemical ecology.|$|R
50|$|A {{biocidal}} product is a substance intending to destroy, deter, render harmless, prevent the action of, or exert a controlling effect on any <b>harmful</b> <b>organism</b> {{by any means}} other than mere physical or mechanical action. These products are highly regulated because of health and performance concerns. They first have to be legally regulated, and all products or substances on the market {{also have to be}} tested and certified in order to ensure their compliance with current directives and regulations.|$|R
30|$|Biocides {{are active}} {{substances}} and products which {{are intended to}} destroy (…) any <b>harmful</b> <b>organism</b> by chemical or biological means. Typical applications are for instance wood preservatives, antifouling products or disinfectants. In the European Union the use of biocidal products is regulated since 1998 by the Biocidal Product Directive 98 / 8 /EG (BPD). The BPD was transposed into German law in 2001 by the “Biozid-Gesetz”. The Federal Environment Agency {{is responsible for the}} environmental risk assessment of biocidal active substances and products under the “Biozid-Gesetz” in Germany.|$|R

40|$|One {{requirement}} in the biocides regulation (528 / 2012 /EU) {{is that the}} efficacy of the biocidal product has to be demonstrated when applying for approval. It has to be shown that the product really has the intended effect on the <b>harmful</b> <b>organism.</b> How such a requirement will affect the marketing of articles treated with biocides is an interesting question that is discussed in the report. The study aims at giving an overview of different types of efficacy requirements in the biocidal rules but also and in other types of neighbouring regulations...|$|R
40|$|The European Commission {{requested}} that the EFSA Panel on Plant Health perform a pest categorisation for Radopholus similis and Radopholus citrophilus. R. similis is regulated in Annex II, Part A, Section II of Council Directive 2000 / 29 /EC as a <b>harmful</b> <b>organism</b> known {{to occur in the}} European Union (EU). R. citrophilus is regulated in Annex II, Part A, Section I of Council Directive 2000 / 29 /EC as a <b>harmful</b> <b>organism</b> not known to occur in the EU. This pest characterisation applies only to R. similis, because R. citrophilus has been recognised as an invalid species designation and is considered as a junior synonym of R. similis. R. similis is a distinct taxonomic entity that is absent in the field production sites (citrus, bananas) of the risk assessment area and can cause significant losses in citrus production. Moreover, various susceptible hosts other than citrus species are present in the EU under climatic conditions that are suitable for the development of R. similis. The pest has a sporadic presence on ornamental plants (under protected cultivation) in a few EU countries. Plants for planting are a pathway for introduction and spread of R. similis. The pest is observed to cause impacts on ornamentals in some MSs and further impacts are expected should further spread happen in the EU...|$|R

50|$|White stork nests are {{habitats}} for {{an array}} of small arthropods, particularly over the warmer months after the birds arrive to breed. Nesting over successive years, the storks bring more material to line their nests and layers of organic material accumulate within them. Not only do their bodies tend to regulate temperatures within the nest, but excrement, food remains and feather and skin fragments provide nourishment for a large and diverse population of free-living mesostigmatic mites. A survey of twelve nests found 13,352 individuals of 34 species, the most common being Macrocheles merdarius, M. robustulus, Uroobovella pyriformis and Trichouropoda orbicularis, which together represented almost 85% of all the specimens collected. These feed on the eggs and larvae of insects and on nematodes, which are abundant in the nest litter. These mites are dispersed by coprophilous beetles, often of the family Scarabaeidae, or on dung brought by the storks during nest construction. Parasitic mites do not occur, perhaps being controlled by the predatory species. The overall effect of the mite population is unclear, the mites may {{have a role in}} suppressing <b>harmful</b> <b>organisms</b> (and hence be beneficial), or they may themselves have an adverse effect on nestlings.|$|E
