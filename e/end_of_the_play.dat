5|$|That no one marries at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>play</b> was {{a daring}} {{innovation}} for Victorian theatre, and the reviewer from Era mentioned his surprise at this.|$|E
5|$|In Macbett, Eugène Ionesco's 1972 stage adaptation, Fleance is {{merged with}} the Malcolm character. Macol (Malcolm), who {{is thought to be}} King Duncan's son, is {{revealed}} to be Banco's (Banquo's). Duncan, wanting a male heir, adopted Macol. Macol fills the role of Malcolm in taking the kingdom from Macbett (Macbeth) at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>play.</b>|$|E
5|$|At the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>play,</b> {{the actors}} file out slowly (most {{important}} first, with gaps between actors), {{and while they}} are on the bridge (hashigakari), the audience claps restrainedly. Between actors, clapping ceases, then begins again as the next actor leaves. Unlike in western theatre, there is no bowing, nor do the actors return to the stage after having left. A play may end with the shite character leaving the stage as part of the story (as in Kokaji, for instance)—rather than ending with all characters on stage—in which case one claps as the character exits.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>ending</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>play</b> is {{different}} every night as audience members hear clues, question the characters, and then vote on who {{they think is}} guilty.|$|R
50|$|In addition, {{a player}}'s {{contract}} can be tolled {{if a player}} does not satisfy his <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>playing</b> contract (i.e., refuses to report while his contract is in force).|$|R
50|$|Under the {{challenge}} system, the league championship would change hands until <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>playing</b> season. Under <b>the</b> series system, the league championship was only determined at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> season by best overall record or playoff.|$|R
5|$|One {{consequence}} of the reassessment of sources is the reappearance of Troilus in his ancient form of andropais. Troilus takes this form in Giraudoux's The Trojan War Will Not Take Place, his first successful reappearance in the 20th century. Troilus is a fifteen-year-old boy whom Helen has noticed following her around. After turning down the opportunity to kiss her when she offers and when confronted by Paris, he eventually accepts the kiss at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>play</b> just as Troy has committed to war. He is thus {{a symbol of the}} whole city's fatal fascination with Helen.|$|E
5|$|Following the missed field goal, Air Force's offense began {{operations}} at its 24-yard line. Running back Anthony Butler broke free for an 18-yard gain {{on the third}} play of the drive, giving Air Force a first down. Two plays later, however, Harridge threw a pass that was intercepted by Tech linebacker Vegas Robinson. At the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>play,</b> Air Force committed a 15-yard personal foul penalty, which allowed the Tech offense to take over at the Air Force 15-yard line. Tech needed just two plays to drive the 15 yards and earn a touchdown, its first of the game. With 2:26 remaining in the quarter, Air Force's lead had been cut to 10–7.|$|E
5|$|The Bearcats' kickoff was {{returned}} to the Tech 14-yard line, and the Hokies began the first drive of the third quarter. Evans rushed for four yards, but Oglesby lost four yards on a run during the next play. Facing third and ten, Taylor picked up the first down with an 11-yard run, but fumbled the ball at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>play.</b> The loose ball was scooped up by Boone, who kept the Hokies' drive going at the Tech 30-yard line. After the fumble, Evans ran for seven yards and Taylor completed a 10-yard pass to Roberts for a first down at the Tech 47-yard line. Coale then rushed for seven yards on an end-around, and his run was followed by one by Boone, who ran for 16yards and a first down at the Cincinnati 30-yard line. Two more rushes by Roberts and Evans resulted in another first down, but once the Hokies passed the Cincinnati 20-yard line, the Bearcats' defense stiffened and denied the Hokies another first down. Facing fourth down, Tech again sent in Keys, who kicked a 35-yard field goal. The kick extended Tech's lead to 13–7 with 8:32 remaining in the quarter.|$|E
5000|$|In 1937, when World War II broke out, {{the famous}} Chinese playwright Ouyang Yuqian altered <b>the</b> <b>ending</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>play</b> into [...] "Having cut his hair, Hou {{surrendered}} to the Qing dynasty and served its royal court", satirizing the traitor Wang Jingwei of that time.|$|R
50|$|Shooting {{took place}} in May 1971 {{immediately}} after <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>play's</b> Sydney season. <b>The</b> shoot only took two weeks in at the Australiana village, Wilberforce, near Sydney. $15,000 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> budget came from the Australian Council for the Arts and $16,000 from the Australian Film Development Corporation.|$|R
5000|$|In a {{game played}} on a playing field, such as rugby, one team would have an unfair {{advantage}} if the field had a slope. Since some real-life playing fields do in fact have slopes, it is customary for teams to swap <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>playing</b> field at half time.|$|R
5|$|The third, and final, London season {{under the}} triumvirate was in 1946–47. Olivier played King Lear, and Richardson took {{the title role}} in Cyrano de Bergerac. Olivier would have {{preferred}} the roles to be reversed, but Richardson {{did not wish to}} attempt Lear. Olivier's Lear received good but not outstanding reviews. In his scenes of decline and madness towards the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>play</b> some critics found him less moving than his finest predecessors in the role. The influential critic James Agate suggested that Olivier used his dazzling stage technique to disguise a lack of feeling, a charge that the actor strongly rejected, but which was often made throughout his later career. During the run of Cyrano, Richardson was knighted, to Olivier's undisguised envy. The younger man received the accolade six months later, by which time the days of the triumvirate were numbered. The high profile of the two star actors did not endear them to {{the new chairman of the}} Old Vic governors, Lord Esher. He had ambitions to be the first head of the National Theatre and had no intention of letting actors run it. He was encouraged by Guthrie, who, having instigated the appointment of Richardson and Olivier, had come to resent their knighthoods and international fame.|$|E
5|$|By {{this point}} in the game, Florida State was fully {{committed}} to running down the clock and executed three straight rushing plays to keep the time running out. Virginia Tech was forced to use two of its timeouts to stop the clock, but was eventually successful in forcing a Seminole punt. The kick rolled inside the Virginia Tech 10-yard line before being downed, pinning the Hokies deep in their territory. The first play of Tech's drive was almost a disaster for Virginia Tech, as Marcus Vick fumbled the ball while attempting to avoid a sack. Fortunately for the Hokies, the ball was leapt on by Tech's Duane Brown and the drive stayed alive. Virginia Tech moved the ball downfield through the air with difficulty. Due to the limited time remaining, Virginia Tech was forced to rely mainly on passing plays, which stopped the clock when incomplete or were completed for a first down. A 14-yard pass to Josh Morgan and a 10-yard throw to Cedric Humes moved the Hokies to their 47-yard line. Vick then completed a 19-yard pass to Jeff King and Florida State committed a 15-yard roughing the passer penalty on Marcus Vick, which was tacked onto the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>play.</b> After the penalty, Virginia Tech's offense was deep in Florida State territory, and two plays later, Marcus Vick ran into the end zone on a one-yard quarterback scramble. Rather than attempt another two-point conversion, the Hokies kicked the extra point, and with 1:44 remaining, Virginia Tech had closed the gap to 2722.|$|E

50|$|Finally, on December 1, 1922, {{construction}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gym was completed. At 105 ft {{long and}} 80 ft wide, the new gym {{was big enough}} to not only accommodate basketball games and spectators (with bleacher seating around <b>the</b> sides and <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>playing</b> floor), but also many civic and community oriented events.|$|R
50|$|The {{film version}} avoided {{censorship}} problems with some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sexual references and language with a modified screenplay. The film featured <b>the</b> original <b>ending</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>play</b> that was overwhelmingly {{rejected by the}} war weary test screening audience. A new ending giving hope {{to those who had}} loved ones in the Philippines was filmed.|$|R
5000|$|Hagen {{went on to}} <b>play</b> <b>the</b> title {{roles in}} Anton Chekhov's Ivanov and in Raskolnikov, based on Fyodor Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment, both at Hålogaland Teater. He said that playing Raskolnikov had been “{{extremely}} dark and extremely difficult,” {{and that he had}} had to take six months off after <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>play's</b> run to “recharge my batteries.” ...|$|R

25|$|There {{is also a}} small voice-only part of a man's voice (unclear {{whether it}} is the voice of the Chesters' father or just someone imitating it) towards the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>play,</b> {{whispering}} the names of the two daughters. Like Julia in Haunting Julia, the father in this play can be considered a very strong off-stage character.|$|E
25|$|If the offence {{attempts}} {{a forward}} pass {{and it is}} intercepted by the defence; the defence takes possession immediately (and may try to advance {{the ball on the}} play). Note that incomplete forward passes (those which go out of bounds, or which touch the ground without being first cleanly caught by a player) result in the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>play,</b> and are not returnable by either team.|$|E

25|$|In {{the second}} quarter, after a UCLA missed field goal, Earl McCullouch would run 52 yards on a flanker reverse; he fumbled near the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>play</b> but USC recovered. He then caught another 13-yard pass. This set up O. J. Simpson for a weaving 12-yard {{touchdown}} run {{through most of}} the UCLA defensive unit in which he dragged two tacklers to the end zone. USC led at halftime 14-7.|$|E
25|$|According to Sophocles' play of The Trachiniae Iole's {{mother was}} Antiope and her {{siblings}} were Iphitus, Clytius, Toxeus, Deioneus, Molion, and Didaeon. In the play Iole {{is described as}} the daughter of King Eurytus, the royal princess of Oechalia. She is among the captive maidens of Oechalia when Heracles ransacks the city. She is to become the concubine of Heracles. Toward the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>play</b> Heracles asks his son Hyllus to marry her when he dies, so she will be well taken care of. Hyllus agrees to do this for his father.|$|E
25|$|On the surface, Agnes is {{completely}} supportive of her husband, Tobias. She looks {{to him to}} confirm her thoughts, and, likewise, she confirms his. It is not until near the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>play</b> that she brings up issues that show cracks in {{her relationship with her}} husband. When the memory of the death of her son is brought to the surface of her thoughts, she reminisces about how difficult a time that was for her, a time when she questioned everything, including her husband’s love and faithfulness to her.|$|E
50|$|The film greatly changes <b>the</b> <b>ending</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>play,</b> {{in which}} <b>the</b> lovers Mio and Miriamne are {{shot to death}} by gangsters. In the film, the two are cornered, but Mio {{deliberately}} causes a commotion by loudly playing a nearby abandoned hurdy-gurdy and deliberately causing himself and Miriamne to be arrested, thus placing them out <b>of</b> reach from <b>the</b> gangsters.|$|R

50|$|The goals (or 'gulleys') {{are three}} metres wide and are sited at {{opposite}} <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>playing</b> area on <b>the</b> pool bottom.

25|$|Evolution has a {{different}} meaning {{in terms of the}} lizards. Leslie and Sarah are literally evolving. They were creatures that lived in the sea but apparently developed beyond their species. They were compelled to move to the land, though they do not really understand why. Though Leslie and Sarah are somewhat fearful of the change, they do accept the help that Nancy, enthusiastically, and Charlie, reluctantly, give them. At the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>play,</b> rather than go back into the sea where they might feel safer, they remain on land.|$|E
25|$|The play {{describes}} the Apshinken {{family and the}} pursuits in love of Owen and his butler, Robin. Owen pursues four women and Robin pursues only one. However, Robin is pursuing Sweetissa, whom Owen wishes to have for himself. To separate the two, Owen forges a letter which works until Robin's virtue proves his own devotion to Sweetissa. Although Robin lacks virtue in most regards, such as his stealing from his master, {{he is able to}} marry Sweetissa and, at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>play,</b> Fielding breaks from his own tradition of comedic marriages by having Owen and Molly marry.|$|E
25|$|The {{success of}} the Brook {{production}} seems to have provided an impetus for directors to tackle the play, and ever since 1955, {{there has been a}} steady stream of performances on the English and American stages. After Brook, the next major production came in 1967, when Douglas Seale directed an extremely graphic and realistic presentation at the Centre Stage in Baltimore with costumes that recalled the various combatants in World War II. Seale's production employed a strong sense of theatrical realism to make parallels between the contemporary period and that of Titus, and thus comment on the universality of violence and revenge. Seale set the play in the 1940s and made pointed parallels with concentration camps, the massacre at Katyn, the Nuremberg Rallies and the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings. Saturninus was based on Benito Mussolini and all his followers dressed entirely in black; Titus was modelled after a Prussian Army officer; the Andronici wore Nazi insignia and the Goths at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>play</b> were dressed in Allied Forces uniforms; the murders in the last scene are all carried out by gunfire, and at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>play</b> swastikas rained down onto the stage. The play received mixed reviews with many critics wondering why Seale had chosen to associate the Andronici with Nazism, arguing that it created a mixed metaphor.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>play</b> tells <b>the</b> story <b>of</b> Eteocles and Polynices, <b>the</b> sons <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shamed King <b>of</b> Thebes, Oedipus. <b>The</b> sons {{agree to}} {{alternate}} in <b>the</b> throne <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city, {{but after the}} first year Eteocles refuses to step down, and Polynices wages war to claim his crown. The brothers kill each other in single combat, and <b>the</b> original <b>ending</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>play</b> consisted <b>of</b> lamentations for <b>the</b> dead brothers.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> game is <b>played</b> on a {{two-dimensional}} side-scrolling gamefield, where two players start at main bases on opposing sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> field. The player operates a Choplifter-esque helicopter defending {{a string of}} advancing units, which the player purchases throughout the game. The objective is to create and defend a force that can escort a van filled with explosives to the enemy base at <b>the</b> other <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>playing</b> field.|$|R
