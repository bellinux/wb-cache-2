There was not a significant difference in orientation with respect to the feature sizes used. The number of neurites per cell was constrained by the ridges and grooves, producing bipolar rather than branching phenotypes.|$|E

An unsteady convective heat transfer model is used that deals with the material-cutting process by a continuous Gaussian laser beam. The geometric non-linearity due to the melting region is handled by an iterative scheme. Convergence analyses are performed with various meshes for the groove shapes, temperature distributions, maximum <b>groove</b> <b>depths,</b> and flux distributions. The present studies by a boundary element method based on transient convective heat transfer equation show excellent agreement {{with the results of}} a finite element method in terms of groove shapes, temperature distributions, and maximum <b>groove</b> <b>depths...</b>|$|R

50|$|Like the Mk IV {{this was}} based on the 4.5 inch barrel design lined down to 3.7 inches, and using the 4.5 inch size cartridge.

This smoothed the two driving bands of a new design shell giving reduced air resistance and hence better ballistic performance, and causing far less barrel wear. The maximum ceiling for the gun was about 15240 m. It was mounted on the Mounting Mk IIA and therefore deployed in static emplacements only. In service from 1944 to 1959.|$|E

5000|$|While not {{as common}} as [...] "pure analog" [...] or [...] "pure digital" [...] methods, these {{situations}} do occur in practice. Indeed, all analog systems show discrete (quantized) behaviour at the microscopic scale, and asynchronously operated class-D amplifiers even consciously incorporate continuous time, discrete amplitude designs. Continuous amplitude, discrete time systems have also been used in many early analog-to-digital converters, {{in the form of}} sample-and-hold circuits. The boundary is further blurred by digital systems which statistically aim at analog-like behavior, most often by utilizing stochastic dithering and noise shaping techniques.While vinyl records and common compact cassettes are analog media and use quasi-linear physical encoding methods (e.g. spiral <b>groove</b> <b>depth,</b> tape magnetic field strength) without noticeable quantization or aliasing, there are analog non-linear systems that exhibit effects similar to those encountered on digital ones, such as aliasing and [...] "hard" [...] dynamic floors (e.g. frequency modulated hi-fi audio on videotapes, PWM encoded signals).|$|E
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{an application}} of gray scale electron beam lithography (EBL) for the fabrication of polymer waveguides and grating out-put couplers with depth variable features, using the SU- 8 resist. The technique is mainly applicable for multi-level binary profile, where <b>groove</b> <b>depths</b> of the structure are controlled by choosing a proper exposure dose. Unlike reactive ion etching which {{is limited by the}} lag effect, the gray scale EBL allows free combination of <b>groove</b> widths and <b>depths.</b> Shrinking effect which is critical in polymer couplers' writing is taken into account and can be compensated. For better fabrication feasibility, the grating couplers can be simultaneously pro-duced with waveguides with no inter-step alignment required. Therefore, this is a promising technique in manufacturing grating output couplers for polymer based waveguides with high performance in terms of mode matching/confinement and coupling efficiency.

5000|$|In 1990, power pop punk band Flop's [...] "Drugs/Action" [...] 7-inch single was {{the labels}} second release. The {{relationship}} between the label and band began after Swenson, childhood friends with Flop bassist Paul Schurr and a longtime fan of Flop songwriter/singer Rusty Willoughby (Pure Joy, The Dwindles), heard final cassette mixes of the songs on Schurr's bedroom boombox. Both songs, plus several others, were recorded by Chris Hanzsek at Reciprocal Recording in Seattle. Swenson asked to release them all, but reduced the release to 7-inch vinyl because of budget issues. The band and label agreed to include only two songs on the 7-inch citing a mutual desire to keep as much quality of the recording as possible, since squeezing more than one song per side would compress the vinyl <b>groove</b> <b>depth</b> and width thus producing lower quality audio.

5000|$|The Gewehr 88 {{was built}} for the new 8×57mm I with a 0.318-inch bullet. The I and IS designations are used to {{differentiate}} the two bullets used with the same basic cartridge. The actual diameter of the 8.1mm is 0.318898 inches. Commonly known today as the [...] "8 mm Mauser I", it was used for later Mauser rifle models. This was not a Mauser designed and engineered cartridge. The 8×57mm I incorporated the advantages of smokeless powder and higher velocity found in the Lebel. It was rimless, which allowed smoother feeding for both rifles and machine guns. The original bullet had a round nose and was relatively heavy by modern standards but was typical of early smokeless powder small bore military designs. Several redesigns, including {{the adoption of the}} spitzer bullet of 153 grains weight (later 198 grains weight), led to a change in the rifling <b>groove</b> <b>depth</b> from [...]10mm to [...]15mm to solve problems brought about by the greater velocity and the 8×57mm IS or 8×57mm JS 8.2mm or 0.323-inch bullet. This bullet, with a sharp point (and later in the 1930s a boat tail), brought the cartridge to its eventual potency.
