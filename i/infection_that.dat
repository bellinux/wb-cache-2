5|$|At {{the time}} of Henson's death, doctor David Gelmont first {{announced}} that he died from Streptococcus pneumoniae, a bacterial <b>infection</b> <b>that</b> causes bacterial pneumonia. However, on May 29, Gelmont later confirmed that Henson's {{cause of death was}} organ failure resulting from streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (caused by Streptococcus pyogenes). S. pyogenes is the bacterial species that causes strep throat, scarlet fever, and rheumatic fever. It can also cause other infections.|$|E
5|$|Beekeepers in Scotland also {{reported}} losses {{for the past}} three years. Andrew Scarlett, a Perthshire-based bee farmer and honey packer, lost 80% of his 1,200 hives during the 2009/10 winter. He attributed the losses to a virulent bacterial <b>infection</b> <b>that</b> quickly spread {{because of a lack of}} bee inspectors, coupled with sustained poor weather that prevented honey bees from building up sufficient pollen and nectar stores.|$|E

40|$|Zoonoses are <b>infections</b> <b>that</b> {{are spread}} from animals to humans. Most often, humans are “dead-end” hosts, meaning {{that there is}} no {{subsequent}} human-to-human transmission. If one considers most of the emerging <b>infections</b> <b>that</b> were recognized {{at the end of the}} last century and the beginning of this century, they would fall into the category of zoonoses. One of the most important common traits exhibited by <b>infections</b> <b>that</b> have been or can be eliminated from the face of the earth (e. g. smallpox, measles, polio) is the absence of any host other than humans. Therefore, zoonses represent <b>infections</b> <b>that</b> can never be eliminated and must be considered as permanent and recurrent factors to be dealt with in protecting human health...|$|R

He also had trigeminal neuralgia, a nerve disorder that causes severe pain in the face; it has been called one of the most painful known ailments.|$|E
5|$|In benign infections {{found in}} some wild and captive African elephants, these viruses can affect either the skin or the {{pulmonary}} system. In the former case, it produces small pinkish nodules {{on the head and}} trunk in juveniles, which appear for a few weeks and then regress, suggesting an intermittently reactivated localized <b>infection</b> <b>that</b> mostly remains dormant. In the second case, it has been found in small white pulmonary nodules on necropsy of many asymptomatic adults. These are both characteristic of EEHV2, EEHV3 and EEHV6.|$|E
5|$|LeDuc {{had many}} {{problems}} with diabetes {{toward the end}} of his life. While visiting his son in Atlanta, Georgia, LeDuc slipped in the shower. As a result of the injuries, he developed an <b>infection</b> <b>that</b> ultimately led to his death. He died of a lung infection on May 1, 1999 in Atlanta. After his death, the revelation that he and Paul LeDuc were not related caused a minor scandal on talk shows in Quebec.|$|E

5|$|Pathogenic fungi cause {{a variety}} of {{diseases}} in humans and livestock. Aspergillosis, most commonly caused by Aspergillus fumigatus, kills some 600,000 people per year, mostly those with already weakened immune systems. Pneumocystis causes pneumonia, again mainly in people with weakened immune systems. Candida yeasts are the agents of Candidiasis, causing infections of the mouth, throat, and genital tract, and more seriously of the blood. Ringworm is a skin <b>infection</b> <b>that</b> infects some 20% of the human population; it is caused by some 40 different fungi.|$|E
5|$|The {{diagnosis}} {{should be}} considered in anyone who develops a fever within two weeks of being in the tropics or subtropics. It can be difficult to distinguish dengue fever and chikungunya, a similar viral <b>infection</b> <b>that</b> shares many symptoms and occurs in similar parts of the world to dengue. Often, investigations are performed to exclude other conditions that cause similar symptoms, such as malaria, leptospirosis, viral hemorrhagic fever, typhoid fever, meningococcal disease, measles, and influenza. Zika fever also has similar symptoms as dengue.|$|E

5|$|The viral <b>infection</b> <b>that</b> causes croup {{leads to}} {{swelling}} of the larynx, trachea, and large bronchi due to infiltration of white blood cells (especially histiocytes, lymphocytes, plasma cells, and neutrophils). Swelling produces airway obstruction which, when significant, leads to dramatically increased work of breathing and the characteristic turbulent, noisy airflow known as stridor.|$|E
5|$|A rapid strep test may assist a {{clinician}} {{in deciding}} whether to prescribe an antibiotic to a person with pharyngitis, a common infection of the throat. Viral infections {{are responsible for the}} majority of pharyngitis, but a significant proportion (20% to 40% in children and 5% to 15% in adults) is caused by bacterial infection. The symptoms of viral and bacterial infection may be indistinguishable, but only bacterial pharyngitis can be effectively treated by antibiotics. Since the major cause of bacterial pharyngitis is GAS, the presence of this organism in a person's throat may be seen as a necessary condition for prescribing antibiotics. GAS pharyngitis is a self-limiting <b>infection</b> <b>that</b> will usually resolve within a week without medication. However, antibiotics may reduce the length and severity of the illness and reduce the risk of certain rare but serious complications.|$|E
5|$|A {{urinary tract}} {{infection}} (UTI) is an <b>infection</b> <b>that</b> affects part of the urinary tract. When it affects the lower urinary tract it {{is known as a}} bladder infection (cystitis) and when it affects the upper urinary tract it is known as kidney infection (pyelonephritis). Symptoms from a lower urinary tract include pain with urination, frequent urination, and feeling the need to urinate despite having an empty bladder. Symptoms of a kidney infection include fever and flank pain usually in addition to the symptoms of a lower UTI. Rarely the urine may appear bloody. In the very old and the very young, symptoms may be vague or non-specific.|$|E

5|$|AIDS {{was first}} {{clinically}} observed in 1981 in the United States. The initial cases were {{a cluster of}} injection drug users and gay men with no known cause of impaired immunity who showed symptoms of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), a rare opportunistic <b>infection</b> <b>that</b> was known to occur in people with very compromised immune systems. Soon thereafter, additional gay men developed a previously rare skin cancer called Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). Many more cases of PCP and KS emerged, alerting U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and a CDC task force was formed to monitor the outbreak. The earliest retrospectively described case of AIDS {{is believed to have}} been in Norway beginning in 1966.|$|E
5|$|Common elands are {{resistant}} to trypanosomiasis, a protozoan <b>infection</b> <b>that</b> has the tsetse fly as a vector, {{but not to the}} Rhipicephalus-transmitted disease theileriosis. The disease-causing bacteria Theileria taurotragi has caused many eland deaths. Clostridium chauvoei, another bacterium, can be harmful as well. Eland are also hosts to several kinds of ticks. In one study an eland was found to be host to the Amblyomma species A. gemma and A. variegatum, and Rhipicephalus species R. decoloratus, R. appendiculatus, R. evertsi, R. pulchellus and R. pravus. Elands produce antibodies for Brucella bacteria, but none for Mycobacterium paratuberculosis or various types of pneumonia like contagious bovine pneumonia and contagious caprine pneumonia, normally infectious in cows or antelopes.|$|E
5|$|During the 1932–33 season Gardiner {{began to}} develop a tonsil <b>infection</b> <b>that</b> drained his strength. While he {{initially}} kept the infection private, Gardiner made his condition public on December 23, 1932. Even though he was ill, Gardiner played the next night in Toronto. Though his fifty-five saves were the deciding factor in the Black Hawks win and his performance was so good that both league President Frank Calder and Maple Leafs star forward Charlie Conacher praised him, he was so sick he would collapse on the dressing room floor in between periods with a fever of over 100 degrees Fahrenheit; after the game Gardiner was rushed to a local hospital. This was the first notable symptom of Gardiner's health issues.|$|E
