Biodiesel fuel properties have limited their application in diesel engines at high blending ratio therefore, chemical additives introduced as a vaible option to improve these properties. Hence, in the present study, the effect of alcohol additived with biodiesel-diesel blended <b>fuel</b> <b>B</b> 30 on diesel engine cyclic variations was investigated with 6 % of two alcohol additives (ethanol and butanol). The in-cylinder pressure analyses results reveal that the lowest coefficient of variation indicated for the blended <b>fuel</b> <b>B</b> 30 without additives.

Biodiesel is considered for mixing with fishing boat fuels to adjust their fuel characteristics so that toxic pollutants and greenhouse-effect gas emissions from such shipping might be reduced. The effects of blending fishing boat fuels A and B with various weight proportions of biodiesel are experimentally investigated in this study. The results show that biodiesel blending can significantly improve the inferior fuel properties of both fishing boat fuels and particularly <b>fuel</b> <b>B.</b> The flash points of both of these fuels increases significantly {{with the addition of}} biodiesel and thus enhances the safety of transporting and storing these blended fuels. The flash point of fishing boat <b>fuel</b> <b>B</b> even increases by 16 % with 25 wt% biodiesel blending. The blending of biodiesel with no sulfur content is found {{to be one of the}} most effective ways to reduce the high sulfur content of fishing boat fuel, resulting in a reduction in the emission of sulfur oxides. The addition of only 25 wt% biodiesel decreased the sulfur content of the fishing boat fuel by 37 %.

40|$|Biodiesel is {{receiving}} {{more and more}} attention as a renewable fuel; serve {{as an alternative to}} mineral diesel. Fossil fuels are depleting with time due to their limited resources. On the other hand; the world energy consumption increases continuously due to the modern life requirements which lead to series energy crises. Although blended biodiesel-diesel fuel can replace mineral diesel satisfactorily at low blending ratios up to 20 % biodiesel, problems related to fuel properties persist at high blending ratio more than 20 %. The aim of this thesis is to investigate the feasibility of biodiesel-diesel blended fuel at 30 % biodiesel, as fuel for unmodified diesel engines. Chemical additives are introduced as a viable option to improve the blended fuel properties. The experimental characterization of the blended fuel properties was conducted with ethanol, butanol and diethyl ether additives at low ratios up to 8 % compared to the blended fuel standard ASTM D 7467. Furthermore, engine is tested with blended <b>fuel</b> <b>B</b> 30 and additives to investigate the engine performance, exhaust emissions and engine cyclic variations using the coefficient of variation and the wavelet analysis method. A statistically significant improvement in blended fuel kinematic viscosity and density was observed with all additives starting at 4 % and 6 % additive ratios for kinematic viscosity and density, respectively. On the other hand, a significant reduction in the blended fuel heating value was observed with all additive types starting at 6 % additive ratio. The least reduction of blended <b>fuel</b> <b>B</b> 30 heating value observed at 8 % additive ratio is about 4 % for B 30 with diethyl ether additive. The blended fuel cold flow properties were improved with increasing additive ratios and maximum reduction in pour and cloud point was observed with diethyl ether by 2 oC and 3 oC respectively; at 8 % additive ratio. The engine brake thermal efficiency was comparable for blended <b>fuel</b> <b>B</b> 30 with different additives and mineral diesel. Furthermore, blended fuel with diethyl ether additive showed higher engine power at lower brake specific fuel consumption compared to other additives at similar ratios, and better engine brake power was achieved at 6 % diethyl ether with increasing the additive ratio. The formation of NOx and CO 2 emissions was reduced significantly with increasing the additive ratios. Better improvement in these emissions observed with diethyl ether additive at 8 % ratio, which was comparable to that of diesel fuel. The significant impact of the additives on reducing the maximum in-cylinder pressure for B 30 was observed with increasing additive ratios and the better trend obtained for B 30 with 4 % to 6 % diethyl ether additive, which was comparable to that of the mineral diesel. Both the wavelet analysis and coefficient of variation reveal that increasing the additive ratio would give a noticeable effect on increasing the engine cycle-to-cycle variations which limits their usage at high ratios. It can be concluded that chemical additives are a viable option to introduce the blended <b>fuel</b> <b>B</b> 30 as an alternative fuel for diesel engine that meets the blended fuel standard ASTM D 7467 specifications...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{was to investigate the}} brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) of the engine, installed in an agricultural tractor, fueled before with diesel oil (B 0) and then with biodiesel (B 100). This was done both vs. the engine speed, which vs. engine load. To understand the influence of the fuel heating value and the brake thermal efficiency (BTE), a mathematical modeling of the BTE vs. engine speed and engine torque was developed. The bench tests on the engine, fueled with the two <b>fuels</b> (<b>B</b> 0 and B 100), allowed to point out that on average, the BTE of the engine was unchanged in the comparison between the two fuels, while the average BSFC was 19 % higher with the B 100, consistent with the lower heating value of B 100 (- 17. 2 %). However, the power output of the engine with the B 100 was not reduced by the same amount, but with an average value of 11 %, as there was a partial recovery due to the slight increase in the fuel consumption rate. The fitting of the mathematical model to the engine, fuelled with the two <b>fuels</b> (<b>B</b> 0 and B 100), allowed to draw the diagrams of the calculated BTE and BSFC contours for both fuels, with a good accuracy represented by a mean relative error of 2. 1 ± 2. 2 % (B 0) and 2. 0 ± 1. 5 % (B 100). Finally, the comparison of the previous results, allowed to highlight the points of the engine speed-torque plane where the biodiesel BTE was different than that of diesel oil BTE. It emerged that the engine fuelled with B 100 had a higher BTE at low load and speed, but lower than that of B 0 at high speed due to reduced inclination to evaporate compared to diesel oil, which is critical when the speed increases and the time available for combustion is reduced...|$|R

Though biodiesel-diesel blended fuel can replace diesel satisfactorily at low blending ratios up to 20 %, problems related to fuel property persist at high blending ratio. Hence, in the present study, the feasibility of biodiesel-diesel blended <b>fuel</b> <b>B</b> 30 was investigated with respect to its properties and engine cyclic variations with increasing butanol additive. The blended fuel with additive were tested experimentally in a diesel engine and the in-cylinder pressure data were collected and analyzed using the coefficient of variation and wavelet power spectrum to evaluate the engine cyclic variations compared to diesel fuel engine test results. The fuel property test results showed slight improvement in density and acid value with significant reduction in viscosity when increasing butanol additive. Furthermore, the blended fuel pour point was reduced to − 6 °C at 8 % butanol additive. On the other hand, the energy content slightly affected with increasing butanol additive in the blend. From the wavelet power spectrum, it is observed that the short-period oscillations appear intermittently in pure blended fuel, while the long and intermediate-term periodicities tends to appear with increasing additive ratio. Moreover, the spectral power increased with an increase in the additive ratio indicating that the additive has a noticeable effect on increasing the cycle to cycle variation.

Currently, diesel fuel is mainly used in the industrial and transportation sectors. Though blended biodiesel-diesel fuel can replace diesel satisfactorily at low blending ratios up to 20 %, fuel property problems may persist and worsen at high blending ratios. Hence, the feasibility of the blended biodiesel-diesel <b>fuel</b> <b>B</b> 30 was investigated {{in the present study}} with respect to its property and engine cyclic variations when using ethanol as an additive. The blended fuel and ethanol additive were tested experimentally in a diesel engine. The in-cylinder pressure data were collected and analysed using the coefficient of variation and wavelet power spectrum. The fuel property test results showed slight improvement in density and acid value with a significant reduction in viscosity when increasing the ethanol additive.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{observed}} though not documented that some gas filling stations in Nigeria adulterate their fuel before selling to customers. Numerous engine users had also complained of fuel obtained from some petrol filling stations burn faster than others. Engines used in automobile vehicles and power plants always developed one fault or the other leading to frequent visit to mechanics. In view of these preceding issues, experimental {{study was conducted to}} determine the influence of gasoline sold in Nigeria market on engine performance characteristics. Four samples of commercial gasoline were collected from different petrol stations within Omu-Aran metropolis, Kwara State, Nigeria and tested on a four stroke single cylinder spark ignition engine (P 8161) automotive test bed at wide throttle opening. However, the octane rating of the selected fuel samples could not be ascertain because gasoline supplied at Nigeria petrol stations are no longer rated {{as it used to be}} as regular, premium and regular unleaded. The results of this investigation show that the performance parameters such as torque, brake power, brake mean effective pressure and thermal efficiency for each fuel sample increase with increase engine speed up to a maximum value and begin to decrease as engine speed increase due to frictional loss. Maximum brake power obtained with fuel sample A was 5. 751 kW at 3083 rpm. For <b>fuel</b> sample <b>B,</b> the maximum brake power was 5. 025 kW at 2884 rpm, 5. 269 kW at 2727 for fuel sample C and 5. 019 kW at 2718 rpm for fuel sample D. From this test, brake maximum power and torque occur at the same engine speed for each sample of fuel sample studied. Also the maximum power obtained from <b>fuel</b> sample <b>B</b> and D were approximately the same at different engine speed. It may suffice to say that <b>fuel</b> sample <b>B</b> and D were likely supplied to the different petrol filling stations by the same source.

40|$|Diesel engines {{which is}} an {{attractive}} power unit used widely in many fields are among the main contributors to air pollutions for {{the large amount of}} emissions, especially particulate matter (PM) and nitrogen oxides (NOx). PM {{is one of the major}} pollutants emitted by diesel engine which have adverse effects on human health. Accordingly, many research have been done to find alternative fuels that are clean and efficient. In this study, waste cooking oil (WCO) biodiesel has been used as an alternative source for diesel engine which produces lower PM than diesel fuel. The emission of PM and gaseous emission (carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO 2), nitric oxide (NO) and NOx) has been collected from single cylinder diesel engine fuelled with diesel and WCO biodiesel blends (B 5, B 10 B 20 and B 100) at five different engine speed (1200 rpm, 1500 rpm, 1800 rpm, 2100 rpm and 2400 rpm) with constant load of 20 Nm. The comparison between diesel and WCO biodiesel blends has been made in terms of PM characterization which is PM mass concentration, its component (soluble organic fraction (SOF) and soot) and its influence on PM formation, PM morphology and PM size distribution. In addition, combustion characteristic which is in-cylinder pressure of the engine as well as exhaust temperature also has been observed. The results show PM emission of B 100 is lower than diesel fuel with variation of 5. 56 % to 21. 82 %. This is due to oxygen content contained in B 100. As for SOF concentration, blended <b>fuels</b> <b>B</b> 10, B 20, and B 100 have higher SOF value (3. 23 % to 82. 36 %) compared to diesel fuel at moderate and high engine speed. Meanwhile, soot concentration for blended <b>fuels</b> <b>B</b> 10, B 20 and B 100 is lower (10 % to 62. 50 %.) compared to diesel fuel Observation on PM morphology shows that the images is chain-like agglomeration which is extremely small non uniform nanostructure. As for the PM size distribution, the trend were similar for diesel and WCO biodiesel blends. The size distribution of diesel fuel and WCO biodiesel blends were shifted to the larger size as the engine speed is increased. Simultaneously, the size distribution is shifted to the smaller PM diameter as blending ratio of WCO biodiesel in the fuel blend is increase. The observation of in-cylinder pressure shows uncertain trend with the WCO biodiesel ratio in the fuel blend while decreasing with the increasing engine speed due to the prolong ignition delay period. At the same time, WCO biodiesel blends gives higher value of exhaust temperature which is 1. 49 % compared to diesel fuel and it increases as the engine speed increase. In terms of gaseous emission, increasing engine speed increased the CO, CO 2, NOx and NO emission while decrease the O 2 emission. The effect of WCO biodiesel blends on the gaseous emission shows uncertain trend while PM-NOx trade off observation shows B 100 simultaneously decrease both NOx and PM emission at the same time. This study shows that the PM and gaseous emission as well as combustion characteristic of the WCO biodiesel are comparable with diesel fuel thus WCO biodiesel has potential as an alternative fuel to be used in diesel in the future...|$|R
40|$|Directed Technologies Inc. has {{analyzed}} {{the costs and}} other attributes of three fuel infrastructure systems to support fuel cell vehicles: hydrogen, methanol and gasoline. This work compliments previous DTI analyses of onboard fuel system costs for these three <b>fuels</b> <b>B</b> onboard hydrogen storage systems {{in the case of}} hydrogen, and onboard fuel processors for methanol and for gasoline. The results of our fuel infrastructure cost analyses contradict the conventional wisdom that a hydrogen fueling infrastructure would be very expensive. In fact, we estimate that the total costs to society of providing a hydrogen infrastructure for fuel cell vehicles via steam methane reforming of natural gas at the local fueling station would be up to two times less costly than maintaining the existing gasoline infrastructure. Both hydrogen and methanol fuel infrastructures based on natural gas would be less expensive than the crude oil-to-gasoline path used to power cars today. We also analyzed several other aspects of the three fuel systems. For gasoline, we evaluated the likely costs of producing a low-sulfur, fuel cell-grade gasoline. For methanol, we estimated likely future fuel costs, assuming that millions of fuel cell vehicles required new methanol production capacity. For hydrogen, we completed several older analyses such as comparing booster-compression vs. cascade-filling of tanks, producing hydrogen on-site from truckedin methanol, evaluating the greenhouse gas effects of electrolyzing water in various countries around the world, an...|$|R
