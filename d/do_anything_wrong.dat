500|$|In January 1999, Javie was {{the only}} one of fifteen referees to be acquitted of tax evasion charges as a result of not {{reporting}} income he received by downgrading airline tickets provided by the league. [...] Other referees were sentenced to probation or a period of house arrest, and ordered to pay the taxes. [...] He fought the charges because he believed he did not intentionally <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>wrong.</b> [...] Discussing the trial, Javie told Referee magazine, [...] "My job is about my name. My dad taught me your name is the most important thing. I had to fight for my name." [...] During the trial, Javie argued that he didn't owe taxes on more than $84,000 in income over three years because the money was value-earned from frequent flyer miles, which are non-taxable. [...] He later described the trial as [...] "the hardest two weeks" [...] of his life.|$|E
500|$|In May 1994, Jackson married Lisa Marie Presley, the {{daughter}} of Elvis and Priscilla Presley. They had met in 1975, when a seven-year-old Presley attended one of Jackson's family engagements at the MGM Grand Hotel and Casino, and reconnected through a mutual friend. According {{to a friend of}} Presley's, [...] "their adult friendship began in November 1992 in L.A." [...] They stayed in contact every day over the telephone. As the child molestation accusations became public, Jackson became dependent on Presley for emotional support; she was concerned about his faltering health and addiction to drugs. Presley said: [...] "I believed he didn't <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>wrong</b> and that he was wrongly accused and yes I started falling for him. I wanted to save him. I felt that I could do it." [...] She eventually persuaded him to settle the civil case out of court and go into rehabilitation to recover.|$|E
500|$|Jackson {{first met}} Lisa Marie Presley (and Elvis Presley) in 1974, during a Jackson 5 {{engagement}} at the MGM Grand. In November 1992, Jackson was reconnected with Presley through a mutual friend, staying in contact {{almost every day}} by telephone. As the child sexual abuse accusations became public, he became dependent on Presley for emotional support; she was concerned about his faltering health and his addiction to drugs. She explained, [...] "I believed he didn't <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>wrong</b> {{and that he was}} wrongly accused and yes I started falling for him. I wanted to save him. I felt that I could do it." [...] In one phone call he made to her, she described him as high, incoherent and delusional. He proposed to her over the phone towards the fall of 1993, saying, [...] "If I asked you to marry me, would you do it?". The marriage was, in her words, [...] "a married couple's life ... that was sexually active". They divorced fewer than two years later, remaining friendly.|$|E

500|$|Frank, {{who worked}} on the Vioxx case early in his career, was called [...] "perhaps the loudest critic of the Vioxx litigation," [...] and debated trial lawyer Mark Lanier about the issue. Frank {{continued}} his criticism in a 2011 article. [...] "A final sordid chapter in the tort litigation over Vioxx closed, as Judge Eldon Fallon divvied up $315 million to be paid to the plaintiffs' attorneys {{who worked on}} the litigation. This sum was in addition to the more than $1.2 billion already paid to such attorneys. When you add in what Merck paid to plaintiffs and for its own attorneys, the Vioxx litigation cost it more than $7 billion. Yet Merck almost certainly did not <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>wrong.</b> Even as an unsympathetic corporate defendant, it won the vast majority of cases that went to trial, and another dozen or more that plaintiffs' attorneys dismissed on the eve of trial rather than risk the publicity of a certain loss. Even in the handful of cases that Merck lost at trial, such as the $253 million verdict in the Ernst case that generated much of the publicity that led {{to tens of thousands of}} cases being filed, Merck won reversals of most of those on appeal because the verdicts were based on conclusory junk-science expert testimony that should not have been admitted into evidence." [...] Lanier defended the settlement as fair.|$|E
500|$|Delhi police {{registered}} {{a criminal}} case against {{the editor of a}} Delhi-based tabloid, Mail Today, for disclosing the female victim's identity, as such disclosure is an offence under section 228(A) of Indian Penal Code. Shashi Tharoor, then a union minister, suggested that if the parents had no objection, her identity could be made public, with a view to showing respect for her courageous response by naming future laws after her, but Tharoor's remark created controversy. Speaking to a British press reporter on 5 January, the victim's father was quoted as saying, [...] "We want the world to know her real name. My daughter didn't <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>wrong,</b> she died while protecting herself. I am proud of her. Revealing her name will give courage to other women who have survived these attacks. They will find strength from my daughter." [...] Indian law forbids revealing the name of a rape victim unless the family agrees to it and, following the news article which published the father's reported quote and the victim's name, some news outlets in India, Germany, Australia, and the United States also revealed her name. However, the following day Zee News quoted the father as saying, [...] "I have only said we won't have any objection if the government uses my daughter's name for a new law for crime against women that is more stringent and better framed than the existing one." ...|$|E
500|$|On 31 August 2016, the {{deadline}} {{day for the}} summer transfer window, {{it was announced that}} Balotelli had joined OGC Nice on a free transfer, after signing on a one-year deal. In an interview leading up to his Nice debut on 11 September, Balotelli told Canal Plus that joining Liverpool in the summer of 2014 was the [...] "worst mistake of his life" [...] and that Brendan Rodgers and Jürgen Klopp (the two Liverpool managers during Balotelli's time at the club) did not make a good impression on him and he did not get along with them. He made his debut for Nice, starting in a home Ligue 1 match against Marseille, converting a penalty in the 7th minute and scoring a header from Ricardo's cross in the 78th minute as Nice won the match 3–2. On 21 September, Balotelli, in only his second Ligue 1 appearance, struck another double in the 30th and 68th minutes as Nice thrashed Monaco 4–0 in the Azurean derby at the Allianz Riviera to go to the top of Ligue 1. No other player had scored four goals in their first two Ligue 1 matches in the last 25 years. On 29 September, Balotelli scored his fifth goal in just four competitive matches for Nice when he fired home a right-footed shot from just outside the penalty area in the 43rd minute after an assist from Malang Sarr in a 2016–17 UEFA Europa League Group I match against Krasnodar in an eventual 5–2 away defeat. That was his first goal in a UEFA club competition since February 2015, when he scored for Liverpool against Beşiktaş in the round of 32 of the 2014–15 UEFA Europa League knockout phase. On 2 October, Balotelli scored the winning goal in the 86th minute by sending a powerful kick {{from the edge of the}} box into the top right corner as Nice defeated Lorient 2–1 in a home Ligue 1 match, during which he received a yellow card for taking off his shirt in celebration of his goal and was subsequently sent off minutes later in stoppage time after receiving a second, controversial yellow card, following an altercation with Lorient's Steven Moreira, where neither player appeared to <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>wrong.</b> Balotelli's red card was rescinded four days later after referee Olivier Thual's admission that he had made a mistake in showing Balotelli the second yellow card and the French Football League's Disciplinary Commission decided to annul his second yellow card, thus allowing him to be available for the following league match. On 21 December, he received his first official red card in a Nice shirt in a 0–0 Ligue 1 away draw with Girondins de Bordeaux for kicking Igor Lewczuk.|$|E

2500|$|The United States {{stated that}} it was [...] "not a letter of apology," [...] as some state-run Chinese media outlets {{characterized}} it at the time, but [...] "an expression of regret and sorrow".

2500|$|Melford Spiro {{remarks on}} an {{interesting}} difference {{with the concept}} of suffering in Burmese folk religion as opposed to Buddhism. Buddhism teaches that suffering comes from bad karma (which one has [...] rightfully accumulated from a past life) and this karma can’t be improved upon until the next life. In contrast, folk faith places the cause of suffering on mischievous evil spirits. In this way those that suffer are free from blame involving misdeeds they did in their past life. They didn’t <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>wrong,</b> but they must deal with the nuisance of nats. Burmese folk religion also allows for a cure to suffering, in the form of supernatural help from magical people, or offerings to the spirits.|$|E
2500|$|Amy McDougall/Barone (Monica Horan) becomes Robert Barone's {{second wife}} (in season 7), {{and is the}} best friend of Debra, who {{introduces}} her to Robert. A recurring character for the first seven seasons of the series, Amy became essentially a regular cast member {{for the remainder of}} the show's run. However, Horan's name did not get added to the opening credits until the final season. Many issues cause Amy and Robert to break up in the first six seasons, with one being caused by Raymond. Quite often, Amy apologizes to someone even if she did not <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>wrong.</b> She was born to very religious parents who, according to Amy, [...] "wouldn't yell if they were on fire." [...] In real life, Horan is the wife of creator/executive producer Philip Rosenthal.|$|E

2500|$|The [...] "murderer" [...] that he {{was hunting}} had never {{actually}} killed anyone, but he had manipulated others to kill for him, subtly and psychologically manipulating the moments where others desire to commit murder so that they carry out the crime when they might otherwise dismiss their thoughts {{as nothing more than}} a momentary passion. Poirot thus was forced to kill the man himself, as otherwise he would have continued his actions and never been officially convicted, as he did not legally <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>wrong.</b> It is revealed at the end of Curtain that he fakes his need for a wheelchair to fool people into believing that he is suffering from arthritis, {{to give the impression that}} he is more infirm than he is. His last recorded words are [...] "Cher ami!", spoken to Hastings as the Captain left his room. (The TV adaptation adds that as Poirot is dying alone, he whispers out his final prayer to God in these words: [...] "Forgive me... forgive...") Poirot was buried at Styles, and his funeral was arranged by his best friend Hastings and Hastings' daughter Judith. Hastings reasoned, [...] "Here was the spot where he had lived when he first came to this country. He was to lie here at the last." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2007, Savile {{was interviewed}} under caution by police {{investigating}} an allegation of indecent assault in the 1970s at the now-closed Duncroft Approved School for Girls near Staines, Surrey, {{where he was}} a regular visitor. The Crown Prosecution Service advised there was insufficient evidence to take any further action and no charges were brought. In March 2008, Savile started legal proceedings against The Sun, which had linked him in several articles to child abuse at the Jersey children's home Haut de la Garenne. He denied visiting Haut de la Garenne, but later admitted he had done so following the publication of a photograph showing him at the home surrounded by children. The States of Jersey Police said that in 2008 an allegation of an indecent assault by Savile at the home in the 1970s had been investigated, but there had been insufficient evidence to proceed. In 2009 in a taped interview with his biographer, Savile defended pop star Gary Glitter, who was convicted in 1999 of possession of child pornography, whom he described as a celebrity being vilified for watching [...] "dodgy films": [...] "It were for his own gratification. Whether it was right or wrong is up to him as a person... they [...] didn't <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>wrong</b> but they are then demonised." [...] This was not published at the time, and the recording was not released until after Savile's death.|$|E
