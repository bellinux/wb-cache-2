5|$|Burton {{remained}} a Senator while {{each of his}} appeals were pending. Allegedly, his colleagues made it known that they would move to expel him if he appeared in the Senate.

5|$|Marshall died {{of heart}} failure {{at the age of}} 38 in 1939. Twenty-five years later, {{partly as a result of}} his efforts, The Wilderness Society helped gain passage of the Wilderness Act. The Act was passed by Congress in 1964 and legally defined {{wilderness}} areas of the United States and protected some nine million acres (36,000km2) of federal land. Today, Marshall is considered largely responsible for the wilderness preservation movement. Several areas and landmarks, including The Bob Marshall Wilderness in Montana and Mount Marshall <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Adirondacks,</b> have been named in his honor.|$|E
5|$|Fleming {{borrowed}} from his surroundings, {{as he had}} done with all his writing up to that point, to include places he had seen. One such location was a motel <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Adirondacks</b> in upstate New York, which Fleming would drive past on the way to Ivar Bryce's Black Hollow Farm; this became the Dreamy Pines Motel. Similarly, he took incidents from his own life and used them in the novel: Vivienne Michel's seduction in a box in the Royalty Kinema, Windsor, mirrors Fleming's loss of virginity in the same establishment. A colleague at The Sunday Times, Robert Harling, gave his name to a printer in the story while another minor character, Frank Donaldson, was named after Jack Donaldson, a friend of Fleming's wife. One of Fleming's neighbours in Jamaica was Vivienne Stuart, whose first name Fleming purloined for the novel's heroine.|$|E

25|$|Reintroduction {{efforts for}} beaver began around 1904 by {{combining}} the remaining beaver <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Adirondacks</b> with those of Canada and later on those from Yellowstone The population quickly grew to around 2000 roughly ten years and around 20,000 in 1921 {{with the addition of}} beaver in different areas of the Park.

25|$|During {{the summer}} the Lloyds {{would go to}} Piseco, NY <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Adirondacks</b> where they engaged in {{numerous}} outdoor activities like canoeing, hiking and swimming.

25|$|In 2004, Schumer won {{re-election}} against Republican Assemblyman Howard Mills of Middletown {{and conservative}} Marilyn F. O'Grady. Many New York Republicans were {{dismayed by the}} selection of Mills over the conservative Michael Benjamin, who held significant advantages over Mills in both fundraising and organization. Benjamin publicly accused GOP chairman Sandy Treadwell and governor George Pataki of trying to muscle {{him out of the}} Senate race and undermine the democratic process. Schumer defeated Mills, the second-place finisher, by 2.8 million votes and won reelection with 71% of the vote. Schumer won every county in the state except one, Hamilton County <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Adirondacks,</b> the least populated and most Republican county in the state. Mills conceded defeat minutes after the polls closed, before returns had come in.|$|E
25|$|While {{this had}} no {{immediate}} {{effect on the}} hoteliers, other trends of the era began producing a decline in guests at the Escarpment hotels. Expansions of the railroad network meant that the wealthy guests who had previously been content {{to go to the}} Mountain House or Kaaterskill instead went to their own great camps <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Adirondacks,</b> or to other mountainous or coastal regions. Competing hotels in areas further inland now recognized as being in the Catskills claimed to offer a more genuine mountain experience, and purer air, to their guests. The guests who did come tended to stay for shorter periods, mainly hot weekends in the summer. Beach and the Mountain House made a long-planned joint venture to build an incline railway up the Escarpment to the hotel a reality in 1892, but it cut into their profits.|$|E

25|$|The New York State College of Forestry, {{the first}} {{professional}} school of forestry in North America, {{opened its doors}} at Cornell University, in Ithaca, New York, {{in the autumn of}} 1898. After just a few years of operation, it was defunded in 1903, by Governor Benjamin B. Odell, in response to public outcry over the College's controversial forestry practices <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Adirondacks.</b> Less than a decade later, in 1911, the New York State College of Forestry was reestablished at Syracuse University by the New York State Legislature, with a mandate for forest conservation. The institution has continued to evolve and is now part of the State University of New York (SUNY) system, while still closely related and immediately adjacent to Syracuse University. Today, the State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry, or SUNY-ESF, is a doctoral degree-granting institution based in Syracuse, New York, with facilities and forest properties in several additional locations in upstate New York and Costa Rica; it commemorated its centennial anniversary in 2011.|$|E
25|$|On September 6, President McKinley was {{attending}} the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York {{when he was}} shot by Leon Czolgosz. Roosevelt was vacationing in Vermont, and traveled to Buffalo to visit McKinley in the hospital. It appeared that McKinley would recover, so Roosevelt resumed his vacation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Adirondacks.</b> When McKinley's condition worsened, Roosevelt began the trip to Buffalo. McKinley died on September 14, and Roosevelt was informed while he was in North Creek; he continued on to Buffalo and was sworn in at the Ansley Wilcox House. As there was no formally designated order of succession for the post in the event that a president resigned, became incapacitated, or died (the Twenty-fifth Amendment would not be drafted and ratified until the 1960s), Roosevelt served his first term without a vice president. McKinley's supporters were nervous about the new president, and Hanna was particularly bitter that the man he had opposed so vigorously at the convention had succeeded McKinley. Roosevelt assured party leaders that he intended to adhere to McKinley's policies, and he retained McKinley's Cabinet. Nonetheless, Roosevelt sought to position himself as the party's undisputed leader, seeking to bolster the role of the president and position himself for the 1904 election.|$|E
