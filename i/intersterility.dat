40|$|Abstract: Recent {{advances}} in the genetics and population biology of Heterobasidion annosum are reviewed. H. annosum is a heterothallic (outbreeding) basidiomycete with a unifactorial, multiallelic incompatibility system which regulates mating. H. annosum in western North America consists of two <b>intersterility</b> groups (biological species) which can be identified through mating tests and isozyme analysis. <b>Intersterility</b> groups in western North America appear to be host specific. <b>Intersterility</b> between groups is attributable to specific genes. Intergroup hybrids have been formed in the laboratory, but have not been identified from the field. Heterobasidion annosum (Fr.) Bref. [formerly Fomes annosus (Fr.) Karst. ] {{has been the subject}} of numerous investigations because of its significance as a root- and butt-rot pathogen of many commercially important conifers (Koenigs 1960; Hodges and others 1971). Most research on H. annosum has been devoted to various aspects of its pathology, impact, ecology, physiology, and biological and chemical control. The sexuality, genetics, and population structure of H. annosum have received little attention until recently. Knowledge concerning the genetics and population structure of the pathogen has the potential to significantly enhance our efforts to manage disease losses resulting from H. annosum. This paper reviews research conducted over the past 10 years on the life cycle, sexuality, host specificity, and population structure of H. annosum. Publications in this area are relatively few, but some significant advances have been made nonetheless...|$|E

40|$|Little {{is known}} about genetic {{differentiation}} during speciation in fungi. The Collybia dryophila complex (Basidiomycetes: Tricholomataceae) contains several closely related groups of fungi at various levels of evolutionary divergence.

Genetic relationships among five <b>intersterility</b> groups were compared by the method of DNA·DNA hybridization. Clustering techniques were used to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships of these fungi. Genic identity based on DNA·DNA hybridization corresponds well with mating compatibility.

40|$|This thesis {{comprises}} studies {{concerning the}} potential of using double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) mycoviruses as biological control agents against Heterobasidion annosum, a pathogen that causes root and butt rot in conifers. A large number of H. annosum isolates of various origin have been screened {{for the presence of}} dsRNA and it was found that dsRNA elements are present in a low proportion of isolates from most forest sites affected by H. unnosum. The highest proportion, up to 25 %, of dsRNA infected isolates were found in localities heavily infected with H. unnosum. Sequence information indicates that the dsRNA elements in H. annosum belong to the virus family Partitiviridae. Studies on transmission of dsRNA in H. annosum indicated that horizontal transmission between vegetative cells occurs readily in this species and that anastomoses that allow dsRNA to transfer occur between both homo- and heterokaryotic mycelia, and also between isolates from different <b>intersterility</b> groups. Vertical transmission into spores was less efficient, particularly into conidiospores. It was concluded that conidia are not important for the spread of dsRNA in H. annosum, while basidiospores transmit dsFNA efficiently enough to be of importance for the spread of dsRNA. There was little difference in virulence between dsRNA infected and dsRNA free H. annosum isolates of the same genotype in virulence tests on ten-day-old seedlings of pine and spruce. Moreover, the virulence of the fungus was not affected when dsRNA was transferred from isolates of the S <b>intersterility</b> group to a P isolate. In conclusion, the present work indicates that partitivirus-like dsRNA elements cannot be used as biocontrol agents against H. annosum, since they do not cause hypovirulence in this species. However, the ease with which dsRNA was transmitted between incompatible isolates shows promise that deleterious mycoviruses have a potential as biocontrol agents in H. annosum, although the low transmission rate of dsRNA into conidia poses a potential problem concerning application of such a biocontrol ag...|$|E

The project was designed {{to gain a better understanding}} of the biology and population structure of H. annosum on a little studied host, and ultimately to provide land managers with a means for reducing the incidence and severity of annosus root and butt rot. Data for the study were collected from two study sites on the Warm Springs Indian Reservation (WSIR), Oregon. Thirty potential crop trees per stand, both wounded and unwounded, were selected. Trees were sampled using the following techniques: 1) collection of basic tree data; 2) destructive tree dissections or non-destructive wood chip extraction with subsequent isolation analysis; and 3) thirty foot circular stump plots collecting pertinent stump data. Vegetative compatibility (VC) tests were conducted to analyze the clonal distribution of H. annosum within individual trees and ultimately to examine the relative importance of primary and secondary spread. Many VC groups were present in individual trees suggesting the importance of primary spore infection. Starch gel electrophoresis was used to analyze isozyme patterns and determine the <b>intersterility</b> group (biological species) of a subsample of H. annosum isolates recovered from live noble fir trees. All isolates belonged to the S type <b>intersterility</b> group. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to determine if tree, stump and wound variables were associated with H. annosum infection and decay. Results suggested that percent H. annosum infection increased as the total surface area of wounds below breast height and total tree height increased.

The major conclusions of this study are as follows: 1) the incidence of H. annosum infection is high in thinned and wounded noble fir stands; 2) wounded trees are significantly more decayed than unwounded trees, however, the presence of H. annosum was not significantly associated with the presence of wounds and/or decay columns; 3) both wounds and stumps are involved in disease spread, and wounds may exacerbate the decay process; 4) decay volumes steadily increase with time; and 5) manager's should treat stumps with borax, or an equivalent protectant, and take measures to minimize wounding...|$|E

The most significant mortality {{is occurring in}} Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco.) trees of all age classes. This project was designed to study {{some aspects of the}} general biology of H. annosum in central Idaho. Study sites were selected on the Elk City and Clearwater Ranger Districts of the Nez Perce National Forest, Idaho. The specific objectives of the study were: 1) characterize the population structure of H. annosum on three sites with grand fir habitat types on the Nez Perce National Forest, including identifying the <b>intersterility</b> group(s) present; 2) determine if the relative incidence of the disease on these three sites has significantly increased with clearcutting; and 3) determine if the relative incidence of H. annosum varies between species of trees, and between sizes of trees and stumps on these three sites. Three pairs of stands in the grand fir series habitat types were intensively examined during the summers of 1990 and 1991. Each pair consisted of a 10 to 30 -year-old clearcut and an adjacent 80 + year old uncut stand. Basic stand data were collected from 1 / 125 th-hectare (1 / 50 th-acre) plots. These plots were then rated for root disease severity using the following guidelines: 0 = no evidence of root disease; 1 = H. annosum fruiting bodies and/or decay present; and 2 = symptomatic trees present. Plots from each of these ratings were then selected for intensive sampling. Intensive sampling was done on 1 / 5 Oth-hectare (1 / 20 th-acre) plots. Samples were collected using three techniques: 1) stumps were sawed to ground level and wood samples and/or H. annosum fruiting bodies were collected; 2) trees 12. 7 cm (5 inches), diameter at breast height (dbh) or larger, were drilled above two major roots with a gas powered drill and the resultant chips were collected; and 3) trees less than 12. 7 cm (5 inches) (dbh) were excavated and two roots were collected. All isolations were placed on a selective medium for H. annosum. Vegetative compatibility (vc) plate pairings between isolates were used to describe the vc groups of H. annosum in the study areas. All possible pairings within stands were performed, as well as all possible pairings between adjacent stands. Forty-one vc groups were identified with this plate pairing method. Thirty-three were unique, represented by single isolates. The other 20 isolates fit into eight multiple isolate vc groups. Isozymes from seven enzyme systems were then used to discern differences within multiple isolate vc groups in order to identify possible clonal groups. Four of the eight multiple isolate vc groups had identical banding patterns within each vc group, so were considered clones. Two other multiple isolate vc groups came from the same tree, so were assumed to be clones, although the isozyme work was incomplete. The last two multiple isolate vc groups were separated by a great distance, and proved to have different isozyme banding patterns, and were thus determined to be separate individuals. The largest distance between isolates from the same clone was approximately 136 meters (446 feet). The <b>intersterility</b> group(s) of all collected isolates were identified by examining selected enzyme systems. All isolates belong to the S <b>intersterility</b> group. The most noteworthy conclusions from the incidence work done in this study are as follows: clearcutting stands in the grand fir series habitat types without treating stumps significantly increases the frequency of H. annosum; uncut stands in the grand fir series habitat types are infected with H. annosum, although at relatively low frequencies; and Douglas-fir and grand fir (Abies grandis (Dougl.) Lindl.) have very similar disease incidence rates and are likely very similar in their susceptibilty to infection by H. annosum. The following additional conclusions have been made: 1) Spore infections are apparently the major means of introduction of annosus root disease into these uncut and clearcut stands. Vegetative spread is secondary in importance; and 2) H. annosum is rarely the only root disease present in stands in the grand fir series habitat types in central Idaho. It is often found in combination with other root pathogens including Armillaria sp., Phaeolus schweinitzii ((Fr.) Pat.), and Perenniporia subacida ((Pk.) Donk) ...|$|E
40|$|Pinus sylvestris L. {{seedlings}} representing half-sib {{families of}} several trees of known resistance in field conditions were inoculated with three strains of Heterobasidion annosum (Fr.) Bref. representing the P <b>intersterility</b> group. Standardized inoculation procedure and uniform in vitro conditions allowed {{for evaluation of}} the genetically controlled host/pathogen interactions. Early and advanced stages of infection after prolonged exposure to the fungus were studied {{with the help of}} light and transmission electron microscopy. Abundance of osmiophilic material in vacuoles, necrotic reaction of cortical cells and secondary thickenings of cell walls in root regions in proximity to external mycelium were responsible for transient stagnation of pathogen spread in the cortex of resistant seedlings. Immobilized and degenerating hyphae inside vacuolar deposits in cortical cells of short roots of resistant plants are indicative of elevated toxicity of the protective materials at the initial stage of infection. Structural changes of vacuolar deposits and their subsequent disappearance, which coincided with heavy colonization of cortical cells of moderately susceptible seedlings, preceded hyphal penetration into the stele within 2 - 6 -months after inoculation. Despite severe damage to root caps, there was no further spread of the fungus into meristems of growing roots and short dormant roots., In susceptible seedlings, lack of a hypersensitive reaction and apparently low levels of osmiophilic material resulted in quick colonization of cortical cells, breakdown of endodermis and root abortion after entering the stele...|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{we present}} a 2 (nd) {{generation}} genetic linkage map of a cross between the North American species Heterobasidion irregulare and H. occidentale, based on the alignment of the previously published 1 (st) generation map to the parental genomes. We anchored 216 of the original 308 AFLP markers to their respective restriction sites using an in silico-approach. The map resolution was improved by adding 146 sequence-tagged microsatellite markers and 39 sequenced gene markers. The new markers confirmed {{the positions of the}} anchored AFLP markers, fused the original 39 linkage groups together into 17, and fully expanded 12 of these to single groups covering entire chromosomes. Map coverage of the genome increased from 55. 3 % to 92. 8 %, with 96. 3 % of 430 markers collinearly aligned with the genome sequence. The anchored map also improved the H. irregulare assembly considerably. It identified several errors in scaffold arrangements and assisted in reducing the total number of major scaffolds from 18 to 15. This denser, more comprehensive map allowed sequence-based mapping of three <b>intersterility</b> loci and one mating type locus. This demonstrates the possibility to utilize an in silico procedure to convert anonymous markers into sequence-tagged ones, as well as the power of a sequence-anchored linkage map and its usefulness in the assembly of a whole genome sequence...|$|E
40|$|The Heterobusidion taxonomic complex {{comprises}} two of {{the most}} important hngal tree pathogens in North America (Okosina 1989), and includes at least three other taxa in Eurasia (Niemela 1998). These taxa were initially identified as <b>intersterility</b> groups (ISGs) (Korhonen 1978) within the species H. annosum, but the current trend is to assign them the species rank based on molecular, morphological, and host-association haits. European 1 SGs have already been accepted as different species (Niemela 1998). Although yet to he defined as species by taxonomists, the North American Ileterobusidion ISGs have a much wider genetic divergence and isolation than their European counterparts (Otrosina 1993), and are also ecologically specialized on different hosts (Otrosina 1989; Worrall 1983). In this paper we will use the terms "species " and "ISGs " interchangeably when referring to the two North American taxa of Heterobasidion. In California, host specificity effectively strengthens the genetic isolation between the two sympatric Heterobasidion ISGs. Isolates of the "S " ISG infect mostly true firs, hemlocks, and sequoias; the "P " ISG infects mostly pines, junipers, and incense cedars (Otrosina 1989). Nevertheless, there is significant interfertility among S and P isolates in lahoratory mating tests (Hamngton 1989), where host-specific discrimination is artificially removed. We have recently gathered evidence for hybridization between the North American S and P ISGs. In a...|$|E
40|$|Ceratocystis fimbriata {{sensu lato}} {{represents}} {{a complex of}} cryptic and commonly plant pathogenic species that are morphologically similar. Species in this complex have been described using morphological characteristics, <b>intersterility</b> tests and phylogenetics. Microsatellite markers have been useful to study the population structure and origin of some species in the complex. In this study we sequenced the genome of C. fimbriata. This provided an opportunity to mine the genome for microsatellites, to develop new microsatellite markers, and map previously developed markers onto the genome. Over 6000 microsatellites were identified in the genome and their abundance and distribution was determined. Ceratocystis fimbriata has a medium level of microsatellite density and slightly smaller genome when compared with other fungi for which similar microsatellite analyses have been performed. This is the first report of a microsatellite analysis conducted on a genome sequence of a fungal species in the order Microascales. Forty-seven microsatellite markers have been published for population genetic studies, of which 35 could be mapped onto the C. fimbriata genome sequence. We developed an additional ten microsatellite markers within putative genes to differentiate between species in the C. fimbriata s. l. complex. These markers were used to distinguish between 12 species in the complex.

40|$|Given {{the pending}} {{biodiversity}} crisis, species delimitation is a critically important task in conservation biology, but its efficacy based on single lines of {{evidence has been}} questioned as it may not accurately reflect species limits and relationships. Hence, {{the use of multiple}} lines of evidence has been portrayed as a means to overcome identification issues arising from gene/ species tree discordance, morphological convergence or recent adaptive radiations. Here, the integrative taxonomic approach has been used to address the study of the Monocelis lineata species complex. The taxonomic resolution of the complex is challenging, as the species lacks sclerotised copulatory structures, which {{as a rule of thumb}} aid identification in Proseriata. Eighteen populations, which encompass most of the geographic range of the complex, were studied using morphology, karyology, crossbreeding experiments and molecular analysis. These different markers provided evidence of four (karyology) to eight (morphology) discrete entities, whereas crossings showedvarious degrees of <b>intersterility</b> among the tested populations. Molecular species delimitation revealed a different number of candidate species, spanning from five (ABGD and K/θ) to 11 (GMYC). Such incongruences reflect the multifaceted evolutionary history of M. lineata s. l. and hamper the full taxonomic resolution of the complex. However, two candidate species were consistently validated by all of the markers and are described as new species: Monocelis algicola nov. sp. and M. exquisita nov. sp. The latter species appear to have a restricted distribution, and the possibility that meiofaunal taxa may be of conservation concern is discussed...|$|E
40|$|<b>Intersterility</b> (IS) {{is thought}} to prevent mating {{compatibility}} between homokaryons that belong to different species. Although IS in Heterobasidion is regulated by the genes located at the IS loci, {{it is not yet}} known how the IS genes influence sexual compatibility and heterokaryon formation. To increase our understanding of the molecular events underlying IS, we studied mRNA abundance changes during IS compatible and incompatible interactions over time. The clustering of the transcripts into expression profiles, followed by the application of Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment pathway analysis of each of the clusters, allowed inference of biological processes participating in IS. These analyses identified events involved in mating and sexual development (i. e., linked with IS compatibility), which included processes associated with cell–cell adhesion and recognition, cell cycle control and signal transduction. We also identified events potentially involved in overriding mating between individuals belonging to different species (i. e., linked with IS incompatibility), which included reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, responses to stress (especially to oxidative stress), signal transduction and metabolic biosynthesis. Our findings thus enabled detection and characterization of gene expression changes associated with IS in Heterobasidion, as well as identification of important processes and pathways associated with this phenomenon. Overall, {{the results of this study}} increase current knowledge regarding the molecular mechanisms underpinning IS in Heterobasidion and allowed for the establishment of a vital baseline for further studies.
