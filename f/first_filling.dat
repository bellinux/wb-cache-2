5|$|Days {{after the}} <b>first</b> <b>filling</b> of the reservoir, around 80 {{hairline}} cracks {{were observed in}} the dam's structure. The submerged spillway gates of the dam might pose a risk of cavitation, similar to that which severely damaged the poorly designed and cavitating spillways of the Glen Canyon Dam in the US state of Arizona, which was unable to properly withstand the Colorado river floods of 1983. However 163,000 concrete units of the Three Gorges dam all passed quality testing and the deformation was within design limits. An experts group gave the project overall a good quality rating.|$|E

2500|$|A Baraita {{taught that}} [...] “Aaron {{and his sons}} shall set it in order, to burn from evening to morning,” means that God {{instructed}} them to provide the Menorah with the requisite amount of oil {{so that it could}} burn from evening to morning.. And the Sages calculated that a half-log of oil (roughly 5 ounces) would burn from evening to morning. The Gemara reported that some said that they calculated this by reducing the original quantity of oil, <b>first</b> <b>filling</b> each lamp with a large quantity of oil and on finding in the morning that there was still oil in the lamp, gradually reducing the quantity until they arrived at a half-log. [...] Others said that they calculated it by increasing it, <b>first</b> <b>filling</b> the lamp with a small quantity of oil and the next evening increasing the quantity of oil until they arrived at the standard of the half-log. [...] Those who said that they calculated it by increasing the quantity of oil said that the Torah has consideration for the Israelites' resources and to calculate by using the larger quantity of oil in the first instance wasted the oil that was still in the lamp in the morning. [...] And those who said that they calculated it by reducing it said that there was no stinting in the place of wealth, the Sanctuary..|$|E

The dam was then [...] high; its present height of [...] was achieved only later in 1938.

[...] The <b>first</b> <b>filling</b> station was opened in 1919 and at the time was the only one between Roanoke, Virginia and Bluefield, West Virginia. [...] The town's first landing strip was built in 1929 and was 1,800 feet (548.64 m) in length. [...] The grass landing strip was given airport status in 1931 and [...] later became Virginia Tech Airport. [...] Local buses began to make their rounds {{for the first time in}} 1947.|$|E

2500|$|All {{advertising}} {{was banned}} on the Reichsautobahn. Instead of advertising signs, noticeboards {{to be used}} to alert drivers to telephone messages were placed on the median near exits. The Reichsautobahn and its innkeeping subsidiary retained all commercial rights in a strip extending [...] in either direction from the highway; gasoline was bought in bulk and sold by the Reichsautobahn, so that there were no brand names on the filling stations, and station attendants trained at a special school at Michendorf on the Berlin ring road so that they would correctly embody the autobahn. Straßenmeistereien (road governance stations) at roughly [...] intervals maintained the highway and assisted motorists in trouble. These were usually located near settlements, where they provided jobs for 15 to 20 people. The <b>first</b> <b>filling</b> stations were located in the triangle formed by the exit and access lanes, and were of simple, modern design, most of them built to a few standardized designs; the Bauhaus architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe designed two. Beginning in 193637, they were relocated {{to the side of the}} road where there was more space, and developed from purely utilitarian service stations into rest stops with overnight accommodation intended to be attractive to the driver. Both the rest stops and the less visible Straßenmeistereien were designed to reflect local architecture, to guard against the danger of the autobahn acting as a homogenizing influence. So, for example, the Chiemsee rest stop took the form of an Alpine chalet. The result has been described as [...] "a kind of völkisch Disney World". Seifert went so far as to write in 1941 that the rest stops should reflect their locations [...] "not only in material and form, but also in their interiors, their dishware, their decorations... right up to the check and the music." [...] However, the Alpine style tended to predominate.|$|E

Smoke, puff, blow thy cloud; and tell the people, if any {{question}} be made, that it is for thy health, and that so the physician orders thee to do. And, sweet one, when thou shalt find thy pipe getting low, go apart into some corner, and (<b>first</b> <b>filling</b> thyself with smoke) cry sharply, 'Dickon, a fresh pipe of tobacco!' and, 'Dickon, another coal for my pipe!' and have it into thy pretty mouth as speedily as may be. Else, instead of a gallant gentleman in a gold-laced coat, thou wilt be but a jumble of sticks and tattered clothes, {{and a bag of}} straw, and a withered pumpkin! Now depart, my treasure, and good luck go with thee!" ...|$|E
60|$|The army {{accordingly}} halted, and {{the necessary}} arrangements {{were made for}} the review. The first thing was to ascertain the numbers of the troops; and as the soldiers were too numerous to be counted, Xerxes determined to measure the mighty mass as so much bulk, and then ascertain the numbers by a computation. They made the measure itself in the following manner: They counted off, first, ten thousand men, and brought them together in a compact circular mass, {{in the middle of}} the plain, and then marked a line upon the ground inclosing them. Upon this line, thus determined, they built a stone wall, about four feet high, with openings on opposite sides of it, by which men might enter and go out. When the wall was built, soldiers were sent into the inclosure--just as corn would be poured by a husbandman into a wooden peck--until it was full. The mass thus required to fill the inclosure was deemed and taken to be ten thousand men. This was the <b>first</b> <b>filling</b> of the measure. These men were then ordered to retire, and a fresh mass was introduced, and so on until the whole army was measured. The inclosure was filled one hundred and seventy times with the foot soldiers before the process was completed, indicating, as the total amount of the infantry of the army, a force of one million seven hundred thousand men. This enumeration, it must be remembered, included the land forces alone.|$|E
