50|$|By 26 January 1942, all USAFFE units {{had made}} good their {{withdrawal}} to the Orion-Bagac line. The Japanese {{forces on the}} other hand, were eager to force a quick conclusion to the battle and pressed on with little respite. Unfortunately for the USAFFE troops, there was still much confusion as to the <b>final</b> <b>disposition</b> of some <b>units</b> along the front. During the withdrawal from the Mauban-Abucay line, a number of changes {{were made by the}} USAFFE Command to initial plans and assignments, and this information did not get to some individual unit commanders in time. As a result, there were many critical gaps along the line that were left undefended. One such gap was the position astride Trail 2 and near the barrio of Capot (since renamed to Barangay General Vicente Lim), an important north-south trail that offered the Japanese the easiest route of advance (with the exception of Bataan's East Road) south to Limay, one of the objectives of the Japanese attack.|$|R

40|$|Background: Prediction {{of outcome}} after stroke is {{important}} for triage decisions, prognostic estimates for family and for appropriate resource utilization. Prognostication must be timely and simply applied. Several scales have shown good prognostic value. In Calgary, the Orpington Prognostic Score (OPS) {{has been used to}} predict outcome as an aid to rehabilitation triage. However, the OPS has not been assessed at one week for predictive capability. Methods: Among patients admitted to a sub-acute stroke unit, OPS from the first week were examined to determine if any correlation existed between <b>final</b> <b>disposition</b> after rehabilitation and first week score. The predictive validity of the OPS at one week was compared to National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score at 24 hours using logistic regression and receiver operator characteristics analysis. The primary outcome was <b>final</b> <b>disposition</b> after discharge from the stroke unit if the patient went directly home, or died, or from the inpatient rehabilitation unit. Results: The first week OPS was highly predictive of <b>final</b> <b>disposition.</b> However, no major advantage in using the first week OPS was observed when compared to 24 h NIHSS score. Both scales were equally predictive of <b>final</b> <b>disposition</b> of stroke patients, post rehabilitation. Conclusion: The first week OPS can be used to predict final outcome. The NIHSS at 24 h provides the same prognostic information...|$|R
