25|$|Work on {{the glass}} panels also proceeded. The DVLMF hired Cloud Gehshan Associates {{to assist with the}} {{selection}} of quotations for the panels. Research into the speeches and writings of famous disabled veterans was made, and hundreds of interviews with disabled veterans conducted. More than 700 quotations were gathered, but just 18 of them—representing a wide diversity of voices spread through time—were used. Initially, a New York-based firm was hired to fabricate the glass panels, but this company backed out of the project. Savoy Studios, a glass manufacturing firm located in Portland, Oregon, was then hired to inscribe and fabricate the panels. Individual sheets of glass were purchased from PPG Industries. Savoy Studios used a computer-controlled water <b>jet</b> <b>cutter</b> to carve the text into them. Moon Shadow Glass, a decorative glass fabricator (known for sandblasting artwork onto vandalized bus shelter glass for the TriMet bus system in Portland) used fine-art abrasive blasting to etch the photo-realistic images into the glass. Savoy Studios then used GlassLam, a liquid polymer trademarked by the GlassLam company of Pompano Beach, Florida, to laminate the glass sheets together into a panel. The laminate not only cemented the sheets together, but also filled in any empty spaces between the sheet. Savoy Studios then used a computer-controlled water jet to cut the panels to their final size.|$|E

[...] This {{can be achieved by}} a number of different methods, depending upon the thickness of the material and the alloy content of steel to be cut.

Materials that are more difficult to work with, or jobs that require higher production volume, can be accomplished with water <b>jet</b> <b>cutters,</b> lasers or electron beam cutting. These two lend themselves towards larger custom shops. Some custom knife makers cut their blanks from steel using a metal-cutting bandsaw.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{guides the}} reader through {{the design of}} an {{inexpensive}} XY stage for abrasive water jet cutting machine starting {{with a set of}} functional requirements and ending with a product. Abrasive water jet cutting allows for mass customization of 2 D parts, such as inlaid tiles. Most water <b>jet</b> <b>cutters</b> are based on a prismatic-prismatic design (gantry type). In an effort {{to reduce the number of}} precision parts in the machine, a rotary-rotary parallel drive design is proposed. The proposed mechanism will be actuated by electric DC windshield wiper motors directly coupled to the links, this eliminates the need for gearing mechanisms that add up to the total cost and complexity of the design. Kinematics of the design is simulated for a working area of 310 mm x 310 mm. Dynamic analysis is performed and the concepts of decoupled and configuration invariant inertia are derived, simplified to a set of conditions on the kinematic structure/mass properties of the arm linkages and applied to significantly simplify the mechanism's control system. The XY stage was designed to be inexpensive and small enough to be placed in hardware stores, garages and small machine shops. A vision of water <b>jet</b> <b>cutters</b> sold in boxes stacked on shelves in Wal-Mart, available for all machinists, artists, schools, and industries might one day thus become a reality if the pumps could also be made cheaply. by Fadi Abu Ibrahim.

40|$|Positive {{displacement}} pumps {{are critical to}} applications ranging from drug delivery to water <b>jet</b> <b>cutters.</b> The reciprocating motion of these pumps means that their output inevitably pulses at the rate proportional to {{the speed of the}} drive. However, if the constant speed drive, traditionally employed in PD pumps, is replaced by one that can dynamically vary speed and torque the possibility of controlling the form of the output pulses arises. To enable such a system this paper reports the modeling of a drive train connected to a Positive Displacement Pump. The drive train comprises a internal combustion engine to generate rotary power, a gearbox transmission to enable changes in the speed-torque ratio and a hydrodynamic coupling in between the two to accommodate flexible power flow. The behavior of the swept pumping volume is generated from a parametric model derived from a CFD analysis. The result demonstrates that there is {{a significant difference in the}} flow predicted by models that use average, rather than instantaneous speeds...|$|R

40|$|Water {{flow through}} a convergent-divergent nozzle used for <b>jet</b> <b>cutters</b> is {{simulated}} with five two-equation turbulence models. Flow separation within the nozzle leads to two distinctly {{different types of}} behaviour for mean velocity along the nozzle. The realizable k-ε and the RNG k-ε models are found to produce generally similar results but which differ significantly from the k-ω based models. The standard k-ε model predicts pressure inside the throat of the nozzle well below {{that of the other}} models. Except for the standard k-ε model, all predict mass flow rates which agree with experimental values. Further simulations involved the Rotating Cylinder Electrode (RCE). The Spalart-Allmaras, k-ε and k-ω models were used to predict the near-wall flow properties. It was found that the k-ε models with enhanced wall treatment predicted the near-wall flow conditions better than the k-ω models, however all models failed to accurately predict the near-wall turbulence dissipation rate. Wall shear stress values for all models were well below those predicted by direct numerical simulation.
