5|$|In August, Khánh {{gave himself}} more powers, {{provoking}} widespread riots and demonstrations across the nation, with Buddhist activists prominent in expressing opposition against Khánh. The anarchy forced Khánh to back <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>make</b> concessions, {{and he ended}} up in a weaker position than before. Among the concessions he made was to remove or demote some Catholic officials who had been close to Diệm's religiously discriminatory rule, angering the minority Catholic community. Among those demoted were Generals Phát and Đức, both Catholic. They launched a coup attempt backed mainly by Catholic elements against Khánh before dawn on 13 September. They took over the city without firing a shot, and used the national radio station to proclaim the deposing of Khánh's junta. There was little initial reaction from most of the military commanders, including Thi.|$|E

Mrs Norris also takes every opportunity to save money, such as taking jellies and sewing materials from the main house for her own home. Historian and biographer Jon Spence suggested in Becoming Jane Austen that Mrs Norris was based on Austen's sister-in-law Mary Lloyd, who had married James Austen, and who was the younger sister of Austen's close friend Martha Lloyd.|$|E

500|$|In May 1968, Jeff Beck re-recorded [...] "Shapes of Things" [...] {{with his}} new band, the Jeff Beck Group, for their debut album Truth. [...] According to Beck, vocalist Rod Stewart {{suggested}} that they record the song and Beck added, [...] "let's slow it <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>make</b> it dirty and evil". Music critic Bruce Eder calls the reworking of the Yardbirds' tune [...] "strikingly bold... deliberately rebuilding the song {{from the ground up}} so it sounds closer to Howlin' Wolf". [...] Despite the new arrangement, the album liner notes only list the writer as Samwell-Smith and on the 1991 Beckology boxed set, Chris Dreja is included along with Relf, McCarty, and Samwell-Smith.|$|E

Alonso was again fastest with a 1:34.057. Hamilton, both Ferraris, BMW Saubers, and Toyotas, as well as Rosberg (Williams) and Webber (Red Bull) also passed through to the final part. Kovalainen (Renault), Fisichella (Renault), Coulthard (Red Bull), Sato (Super Aguri), Button (Honda) and Liuzzi (STR) were eliminated. 2006 champions Renault failed to get either car into the final part. Team engineering director Pat Symonds noted that [...] "...the overall level of performance is disappointing, but we now have to knuckle <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>make</b> the most of the situation we find ourselves in."

500|$|Lopez {{began working}} on a [...] "collection of songs" [...] in 2011, unaware {{of what she was}} [...] "going to do with them". At the time, she was {{deciding}} whether she wanted to release a greatest hits album or a new studio album. Lopez stated that {{when it comes time to}} make an album, she doesn't sit down and write for the entire thing. She revealed that she is always working on new music and that her albums [...] "happen organically" [...] when she has recorded enough material. Lopez explained: [...] "I don't ever stop. I keep going with it. These records, like 'Follow the Leader,' [...] they just kind of came about. It wasn't something like, 'Oh, I'm going to sit <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>make</b> a record right now.'" [...] Among the songs she recorded, two were chosen to be included on Dance Again... The Hits: [...] "Dance Again" [...] and [...] "Goin' In".|$|E
500|$|All of {{the music}} on the record was written by Frusciante, save for the cover of {{hardcore}} punk band Bad Brains' song [...] "Big Takeover". The track was intentionally slowed down and recorded melodically because of a pastime in which Frusciante sang punk songs in different time signatures: [...] "It was just something I had been walking around thinking of in my head. Sometimes I'll walk around singing punk rock songs to myself, but {{as if they were}} regular songs instead of punk rock songs, you know, slow it <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>make</b> a melody instead of just yelling them out. And then the idea occurred me to record it like a Led Zeppelin ballad with mandolins and stuff." [...] River Phoenix, a friend of Frusciante's, had contributed guitar and backing vocals to two songs that were intended be included on the record, but they were ultimately left off due to protests from his family. These were later included under different names on the album Smile from the Streets You Hold in 1997.|$|E

When a race is stopped under {{a red flag}}, cars must slow <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>make</b> {{their way back to}} the pit lane or starting grid unless notified of a restart. This protects race marshals and medical staff at the crash scene, and allows easier access for medical cars to the incident. Approximately 10 minutes after Senna's crash, the Larrousse team mistakenly allowed one of their drivers, Érik Comas, to leave the pits despite the circuit being closed under red flags. Marshals frantically waved him down as he approached the scene of the accident travelling at [...] "pretty much full speed". Eurosport commentator John Watson described the incident as [...] "the most ridiculous thing I have ever seen at any time in my life". Comas avoided hitting any of the people or cars that were on the circuit but after going over towards Senna's accident scene, he was so distressed at what he saw that he withdrew from the race.|$|E

[...] The filmmakers [...] "decided to shoot all the 50s stuff first, and make the town look real beautiful and wonderful. Then we would just totally trash it <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>make</b> it all bleak and ugly for the 1980s scenes." [...] The interiors for Doc Brown's house were shot at the Robert R. Blacker House, while exteriors took place at Gamble House. The exterior shots of the Twin Pines Mall, and later the Lone Pine Mall (from 1985) were shot at the Puente Hills Mall in City of Industry, California. The exterior shots and some interior scenes at Hill Valley High School were filmed at Whittier High School in Whittier, California.

[...] Sandals also stated, [...] "clearly, from what was described in the media, the materials that were being used are totally inappropriate and are in no way connected to the Ontario health and phys ed curriculum" [...] and [...] "I’m relieved that Toronto District School Board (TDSB) has gotten rid of the material and that the teacher {{is no longer in}} the classroom." [...] He had been [...] "ordered [...] to work from home pending an investigation." [...] Sandals called it a [...] "one off." [...] Sandals stated how this type of material would not be included in the new Ontario curriculum. Lisa MacLeod, the critic for education from the Progressive Conservative Party, stated [...] "parents have not asked for this type of sexually explicit information to be made available to their children. The fact that an Ontario teacher felt comfortable enough to post it speaks to the cozy relationship the Liberal government has with their unions."

[...] A spokesman for the school board claimed that the teacher had [...] "good intentions."
