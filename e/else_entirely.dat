Marshall had seen the Aston Martin DBS V12 used in the James Bond film Casino Royale (2006) and sought to implement a similarly [...] "sexy" [...] car. Since the car company did not do product placement, the filmmakers purchased three new Bentley Continental GTs for US$150,000 each.

The production was designed by Simon Bowles who had worked previously with Marshall on [...] "Dog Soldiers" [...] and [...] "The Descent".

40|$|Requirements {{changes are}} {{an issue in}} the {{software}} development life cycle which often originates from an incomplete knowledge of the domain of interest. Hardly any requirement manifests in isolation, and usually the provision of one requirement may affect the level of provision of another. Understanding the relations among system requirements is essential to ensuring their consistency and change management. In practice, many organizations either focus their traceability efforts on functional requirements (FRs) or <b>else</b> fail <b>entirely</b> to implement an effective traceability process. Tracing non-functional requirements (NFRs) has, by and large, been neglected. In this paper, we propose a metamodel which explicitly captures NFRs and their relations, and which is independent from any programming paradigm. In addition, we present an implementation using XML-based representations for the metamodel and XQuery queries to represent tracing information...|$|R

2500|$|The {{sources have}} {{recently}} been reexamined by the scholar Mary Valante, who has taken an economic approach. Accepting Mac Airt's translation of súaitrech not as soldiers but officials, she interprets this as Ivar and Norse Limerick's dominance of international trade within its region, sphere of influence, or [...] "periphery" [...] in Ireland. She notes that the poll tax described in the Cogad [...] "is {{very similar to that}} listed in the Book of Rights and the Book of the Uí Maine from Dublin [...] ", referring to that collected for the Kings of Dublin, and furthermore finds a possible reference to Norse Limerick's royal [...] "officials" [...] in two versions of the Book of Rights itself. However, whether this tribute from Limerick's hinterland (as with Dublin's) was extracted in [...] "a sort of protectionism racket, or as tolls on trade, or as something <b>else</b> <b>entirely</b> is unclear." [...] In any case the Norse economy in Munster, judging from silver finds, appears to have operated somewhat differently from that of the Dublin region. Trade with France, and from there southern Europe and the Mediterranean, can be assumed, but that with elsewhere in the Anglo-Celtic Isles and the wider Norse world may have been more limited by Limerick's location.|$|E
2500|$|According to his {{promoter}} Cisek, Theodorescu-Sion's organic {{treatment of}} nature emanates from [...] "the fundamental law" [...] of Romania's ancient folk arts, namely: [...] "man does not master surrounding nature; he grows from the stony and craggy soil [...] like plants, like trees, like animals." [...] This, Cisek argues, was {{the revelation of}} a true artistic expression of the Romanian soul, opposed to the idyllic canvasses of Impressionist master Nicolae Grigorescu, but akin to the Poporanist prose of Calistrat Hogaș. In 1926, he assessed: [...] "It has been said—and many among the artistically illiterate continue to repeat as much to this day—that only Grigorescu's art can ever be Romanian, and that Theodorescu-Sion's painting can {{have nothing in common}} with the substance of our soil. [...] tomorrow perhaps, [...] may find himself able to overturn skeptical impressions and theories". Cisek depicts Sion as Romania's [...] "best connoisseur of artistic techniques", with a [...] "sovereign mastery", locating him at the opposite end from post-Grigorescu official art. Sion's understanding of national specificity, he argues, had nothing in common with the [...] "mulligan" [...] traditionalism of Octav Băncilă and Kimon Loghi: [...] "if Mr. Loghi is a painter, then Teodorescu-Sion must surely be something <b>else</b> <b>entirely!</b> One should bear in mind that Mr. Teodorescu-Sion is still developing, whereas 'Master' Loghi has reached his summit. The summit of mediocrity." [...] Contrarily, Nichifor Crainic, who was a Grigorescu aficionado, posthumously described Sion as Grigorescu's one equal; however, he noted, Sion bowed to commissions, and as such never produced an actual masterpiece.|$|E

When I had groped my way, blindly, through these difficulties, and had mastered the alphabet, which was an Egyptian Temple in itself, there then appeared a procession of new horrors, called arbitrary characters; the most despotic characters I have ever known; who insisted, for instance, that a thing like the beginning of a cobweb, meant expectation, and that a pen-and-ink sky-rocket, stood for disadvantageous. When I had fixed these wretches in my mind, I found that they had driven everything else out of it; then, beginning again, I forgot them; while I was picking them up, I dropped the other fragments of the system; in short, it was almost heart-breaking.|$|E

40|$|In {{software}} industry, {{many organizations}} either focus their traceability efforts on Functional Requirements (FRs) or <b>else</b> fail <b>entirely</b> to implement an effective traceability process. NonFunctional Requirements (NFRs) such as security, safety, performance, and reliability are {{treated in a}} rather ad hoc fashion and are rarely traced. This is {{mainly because of the}} unique nature of NFRs. They are subjective, relative and they tend to become scattered among multiple modules when they are mapped from the requirements domain to the solution space. Furthermore, NFRs can often interact, in the sense that attempts to achieve one NFR can help or hinder the achievement of other NFRs at particular software functionality. Such an interaction creates an extensive network of interdependencies and tradeoffs among NFRs which is not easy to trace. In a previous work, we proposed a conceptualization of NFRs through the NFRs Ontology. In this paper, we extend the previous work by proposing a change management mechanism for tracing the impact of NFRs on the other constructs in the ontology such as FR or NFR operationalization and vice versa, and providing a traceability mechanism using Datalog expressions to imp lement queries on a relational model-based representation for the ontology. The proposed traceability queries are then evaluated through a multiproject variation quasi-experiment on regression testing conducted in the industry...|$|R

40|$|The {{significance}} of any system of explicit representation depends {{not only on}} the immediate properties of its representational structures, but also on two aspects of the attendant circumstances: implicit relations among, and processes defined over, those individual representations, and larger circumstances in the world in which the whole representational system is embedded. This relativity of representation to circumstance facilitates local inference, and enables representation to connect with action, but it also limits expressive power, blocks generalisation, and inhibits communication. Thus {{there seems to be an}} inherent tension between the effectiveness of located action and the detachment of general-purpose reasoning. It is argued that various mechanisms of causally-connected self-reference enable a system to transcend the apparent tension, and partially escape the confines of circumstantial relativity. As well as examining self-reference in general, the paper shows how a variety of particular self-referential mechanisms [...] autonymy, introspection, and reflection- provide the means to overcome specific kinds of implicit relativity. These mechanisms are based on distinct notions of self: self as unity, self as complex system, self as independent agent. Their power derives from their ability to render explicit what would otherwise be implicit, and implicit what would otherwise be explicit, all the while maintaining causal connection between the two. Without this causal connection, a system would either be inexorably parochial, or <b>else</b> remain <b>entirely</b> disconnected from its subject matter. When appropriately connected, however, a self-referential system can move plastically back and forth between local effectiveness and detached generality...|$|R
