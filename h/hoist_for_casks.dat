They took ladies' boudoirs and turned them into machine-gun posts without showing anything from the outside; I'm sure they never got the concrete out. There was a big building inside the village that had a <b>hoist</b> <b>for</b> <b>casks.</b> The boys arranged a big barrel of petroleum, with phosphorus bombs inside, that was all poised ready to swing. When a tank came through the village and slowed to make the turn they would just pull a catch and the barrel would smack the tank fair and square and go off with a great gust of flame." ...|$|E

40|$|The LR- 56 cask is an International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), type B (U) {{certified}} Medium to High Level Radioactive Liquid Waste Transport Cask.

Rinse heads and connections allow the cask to be rinsed using supplied rinse water. The cask {{was designed to be}} vented using the LR- 56 onboard ventilation system, which is connected to the cask via a hose through a penetration in the cask. Three wells located {{on the top of the}} cask, offer valved penetrations into the <b>cask</b> <b>for</b> venting, waste pumping, and rinsing. Other penetrations in the cask enable surveillance instrumentation to be used to monitor inside the cask. To date, the LR- 56 cask system at the Hanford facility has not been used. Since the vessel has never received radioactive waste, the LR- 56 is not yet a regulated system. It is desired to use the LR- 56 cask to transport waste in calendar year 2000...|$|R

Introduction This paper {{presents a}} study on the docking of a mobile platform to a docking port where six degrees of freedom (dof) misalignments (3 dof in position and 3 dof in orientation) may occur in the general case. This study is motivated by a requirement of ITER where mobile platforms are required <b>for</b> <b>cask</b> transference between the Vacuum Vessel Building (VVB) and the Hot Cell Building (HCB). A common problem that arises when docking mobile platforms is the unavoidable existence of small position (x and y) and orientation (yaw) errors {{in the vicinity of the}} docking port. These small errors exist for any type of guidance solution used on the mobile platform to appro [...] ...|$|R
