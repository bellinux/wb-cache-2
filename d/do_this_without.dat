25|$|Spiders do {{not usually}} adhere {{to their own}} webs, because {{they are able to}} spin both sticky and non-sticky types of silk, and are careful to travel across only non-sticky {{portions}} of the web. However, they are not immune to their own glue. Some of the strands of the web are sticky, and others are not. For example, if a spider has chosen to wait along the outer edges of its web, it may spin a non-sticky prey or signal line to the web hub to monitor web movement. However, in the course of spinning sticky strands, spiders have to touch these sticky strands. They <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>without</b> sticking by using careful movements, dense hairs and nonstick coatings on their feet to prevent adhesion.|$|E

500|$|In November 2009 Loretta {{became the}} centre of media {{controversy}} when various media outlets announced that Loretta {{would be part of}} a storyline which revealed that she had murdered a child in her past. The controversy began when tabloid newspaper The Sun compared the storyline to the real life murder of James Bulger. Bulger had been murdered when he was two years old by two young children. Being just 10 years of age they were handed small sentences to serve and were later released with new identities. Soon afterwards various other news sources and lifestyle magazines picked up the story and mimicked The Sun and its claims. Bulger's mother, Denise Fergus, condemned the storyline. While speaking to the news website Click Liverpool she criticised the decision to air a plot that allegedly mirrored her son's death, stating they should have consulted her first. She said, [...] "I'm shocked and disgusted at what Hollyoaks is doing. They have clearly based this story on what happened to James and it's outrageous that they should <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>without</b> consulting with me in any way." [...] She threatened to encourage a boycott of the show. Channel 4 released a statement defending the plot, explaining {{it had nothing to do}} with any real life case: [...] "The forthcoming storyline is not based on any real-life case and it will in no way seek to recreate real events. The storyline focuses on the psychological repercussions for two characters in the show who were responsible for the death of a 12-year-old girl in the past." [...] The storyline would answer questions for viewers who had been speculating on Loretta's secret past. It would reveal that Loretta had spent time in prison for her crime, was born with the name Joanna Norman, and is living under a false identity.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the most}} {{dangerous}} situations that leads to bear attacks is when a bear perceives a threat to her offspring. Female bears are very defensive of their young, devoting, on their own without any participation of the male bear, many years of their lives just to raise their cubs and teach them to hunt, hence the term [...] "mama bear" [...] to refer to extremely reactive and protective mothers of humans, particularly those who <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>without</b> paternal care. While solo bears will usually retreat, a mother bear protecting her cubs is mostly likely to attack any sudden threat. Black bears present something of an exception to this, however, as mother black bears sometimes urge their cubs to climb trees for safety instead of remaining on the ground to protect their young.|$|E
2500|$|This {{technique}} has limitations in both ZFC and NFU. In ZFC, since {{the universe is}} not a set, it seems possible to abstract features only from elements of small domains. This can be circumvented using a trick due to Dana Scott: if R is an equivalence relation on the universe, define [...] as the set of all y such that [...] and the rank of y is {{less than or equal}} to the rank of any [...] This works because the ranks are sets. Of course, there still may be a proper class of 's. In NFU, the main difficulty is that [...] is one type higher than x, so for example the [...] "map" [...] is not in general a (set) function (though [...] is a set). This can be circumvented by the use of the Axiom of Choice to select a representative from each equivalence class to replace , which will be at the same type as x, or by choosing a canonical representative if there is a way to <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>without</b> invoking Choice (the use of representatives is hardly unknown in ZFC, either). In NFU, the use of equivalence class constructions to abstract properties of general sets is more common, as for example in the definitions of cardinal and ordinal number below.|$|E
