40|$|Background. This study {{compared}} knee alignment and laxity {{in patients}} before, {{during and after}} total knee arthroplasty, using methodologically similar procedures, with an aim to help inform pre-operative planning. Methods. Eighteen male and 13 female patients were recruited, mean age 66 years (51 - 82) and mean body mass index of 33 (23 - 43). All were assessed pre- and postoperatively using a non-invasive infrared position capture system and all underwent total knee arthroplasty using a navigation system. Knee kinematic data were collected and comparisons made between preoperative clinical and intraoperative measurements for osteoarthritic knees, and between postoperative clinical and intraoperative measurements for prosthetic knees. Findings. There {{was no difference in}} unstressed coronal mechanical <b>femoral-tibial</b> <b>angles</b> for either osteoarthritic or prosthetic knees. However, for sagittal alignment the knees were in greater extension intraoperatively (osteoarthritic 5. 2 ° p< 0. 001, prosthetic 7. 2 ° p< 0. 001). For osteoarthritic knees, both varus and valgus stress manoeuvres had greater angular displacements intraoperatively by a mean value of 1. 5 ° for varus (p= 0. 002) and 1. 6 ° for valgus (p< 0. 001). For prosthetic knees, only valgus angular displacement was greater intraoperatively (0. 9 °, p= 0. 002) ...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Patient {{specific}} instruments (PSI), {{an alternative}} to standard total knee arthroplasty (TKA) technology, have shown mixed results regarding effectiveness in previous studies. This study evaluated {{the accuracy of the}} predicted PSI plan, compared incremental cost savings with PSI, and compared outcomes of PSI and standard TKA patients. Patients and Methods: This randomized, prospective feasibility study included 19 primary TKA patients receiving a cruciate-retaining cemented prosthesis from a single surgeon (DCA). 9 patients randomized to PSI received a pre-operative knee MRI for PSI fabrication using proprietary software. 10 standard TKAs were completed. Operative data collected included operating times, implant details, femoral (medial/lateral distal and posterior) and tibial (medial/lateral) resections, and instrument trays used. Hospitalization data collected included length of stay, blood loss, drain output, and transfusions. SF- 36 and WOMAC scores, routine radiographic analysis, and <b>femoral-tibial</b> <b>angles</b> were collected pre- and post-operatively. Costs of operating room use and anesthesia, implants, and hospitalization were collected. Statistical analyses included t-tests and chi-square tests. Results: All implant sizes matched surgical team adjusted PSI software plans. Flexion gap resection (posterior medial/lateral femur) was extremely accurate (average 3 ̆c 1 3 ̆emm). Sagittal plane tibial component posterior slope was larger in PSI TKA (mean 7. 3 degrees) than standard instrumentation (mean 4. 2 degrees) (p 0. 05). There were no differences in operating room times or hospitalization data, and {{there were no significant differences}} in functional outcomes between the two groups (p 3 ̆e 0. 05). PSI patients used 4 fewer instrument trays per case (p 3 ̆c 0. 0001). Conclusion: PSI TKA demonstrated outstanding accuracy in bone resection when compared with the pre-operative plan, and resulted in appropriate limb and component alignment with primary TKA. The number of instrument trays used in PSI TKA was significantly less than standard TKA, which led to less cost for instrument sterilization and assembly...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{effectiveness}} of arthroscopic treatment for osteoarthritic knee is a controversy. This study presents {{the technique of}} a novel concept of arthroscopic procedure and investigates its clinical outcome. Method An arthroscopic procedure targeted on elimination of focal abrasion phenomenon and regaining soft tissue balance around patello-femoral joint was applied to treat osteoarthritis knees. Five hundred and seventy-one knees of 367 patients with osteoarthritis received this procedure. There were 70 (19 %) male and 297 (81 %) female and the mean age was 60 years (SD 10). The Knee Society score (KSS) and the knee injury and osteoarthritis outcome score (KOOS) were used for subjective outcome study. The roentgenographic changes of <b>femoral-tibial</b> <b>angle</b> and joint space width were evaluated for objective outcomes. The mean follow-up period was 38 months (SD 3). Results There were 505 knees in 326 patients available with more than 3 years follow-up and the mean follow-up period was 38 months (SD 3). The subjective satisfactory rate for the whole series was 85. 5 %. For 134 knees with comprehensive follow-up evaluation, the KSS and all subscales of the KOOS improved statistically. The <b>femoral-tibial</b> <b>angle</b> improved from 1. 57 degrees (SD 3. 92) to 1. 93 degrees (SD 4. 12) (mean difference: 0. 35, SD 0. 17). The joint space width increased from 2. 02 millimeters (SD 1. 24) to 2. 17 millimeters (SD 1. 17) (mean difference: 0. 13, SD 0. 05). The degeneration process of the medial compartment was found being reversed in 82. 1 % of these knees by radiographic evaluation. Conclusions Based on these observations arthroscopic cartilage regeneration facilitating procedure is an effective treatment for osteoarthritis of the knee joint and {{can be expected to}} satisfy the majority of patients and reverse the degenerative process of their knees. </p...|$|E
40|$|During {{the period}} from 2007 to 2010 38 {{operations}} of the hybrid knee arthroplasty and 24 cementless knee arthroplasty (LCS De Puy) were performed. In the control group of patients 100 operations in cement knee replacement (LCS De Puy) ware carried out. In the studied groups of patients women dominated – 125 (77, 1 %). The patients’ age ranged from 38 to 88 years (average – 62 years). Treatment results were evaluated {{in accordance with the}} scales of Joseph & Kaufman and WOMAC, based on postoperative radiographs, the measurement of <b>femoral-tibial</b> <b>angle.</b> In the study and control groups in the early postoperative period, as well as future annual observation period of 3 years, the authors obtained the same results. Thus, hybrid and cementless arthroplasty are indicated in patients with good bone quality metaepiphysis femur and tibia bones, those young adults with high levels of physical activity, as well as in cases where it is desirable to eliminate or minimize the use of polymethylmethacrylate bone cement for fixation of femoral components. </p...|$|E
40|$|Lower limb {{alignment}} {{is important}} for the internal loading conditions in the knee. In this study, we aimed to evaluate a new imageless, non-invasive method for quantifying frontal plane alignment by direct comparison against CT. To determine the mechanical <b>femoral–tibial</b> <b>angle</b> (mFTA), functional posture analysis was performed in 15 limbs (13 individuals) using previously published methods for the minimisation of skin marker artefact together with the functional identification of joints, and compared against a published regression method. Whilst the average Functional-mFTA (1. 3 ± 2. 3) was not significantly different (p > 0. 25) from the CT-mFTA (1. 5 ± 2. 1), the Regression-mFTA (4. 7 ± 5. 6) showed a significant error (p < 0. 01). The Functional-mFTA correlated significantly (R = 0. 91; p < 0. 0001), with a small bias (0. 3 °) and agreed better with the CT-mFTA than the Regression-mFTA (R = 0. 76; p < 0. 001), which had a bias of 3. 4 °. The results demonstrate that the mFTA can be quantified accurately using an imageless, non-invasive functional approach, which also offers greater accuracy over regression methods. These new techniques could provide an accurate, non-invasive approach for quantifying frontal plane alignment, particularly in cases where X-rays may not be available...|$|E
40|$|To {{discuss the}} method and effect of total knee {{arthroplasty}} osteotomy and soft tissue release for serious knee joint space narrowing. Clinical data of 80 patients from October 2013 to December 2014 was selected with a retrospective method. All patients have undergone total knee arthroplasty. Then the X-rays plain film in weight loading was measured {{before and after}} operation and osteotomy was performed accurately according to the knee joint scores and the conditions of lower limb alignments. The average angle of tibial plateau osteotomy of postoperative patients was 4. 3 °, and the corrective angle of soft tissue balancing was 10. 7 °; the postoperative patients’ indicies including range of joint motion, knee joint HSS score, angle between articular surfaces, tibial angle, <b>femoral-tibial</b> <b>angle</b> and flexion contracture were distinctly better than the preoperative indicies (p< 0. 05) and the differences were statistically significant; the postoperative patients’ flexion contracture and range of joint motion were distinctly better than the preoperative indicies (p< 0. 05) and the differences were statistically significant. The effective release of the soft tissue of the posterior joint capsule under direct vision can avoid excess osteotomy and get satisfactory knee replacement space without influencing the patients’ joint recovery...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Objectives: To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that autologous iliac bone grafts do not enhance clinical results and do not decrease complication rates in patients undergoing medial opening-wedge high tibial, osteotomy. Methods: Forty patients allocated in a randomized, two-armed, double-blinded clinical trial were evaluated between 2007 and 2010. One group received bone graft, and the other group was left without filling the osteotomy defect. The primary outcome was the Knee Society Score., Radiographic measurement of the frontal anatomical <b>femoral-tibial</b> <b>angle</b> and the progression of osteoarthritis according to the modified Ahlback classification were used as secondary outcomes., Results: There {{was no difference in}} KSS scale between the graft group (64. 4 ± 21. 8) and the graftless group (61. 6 ± 17. 3; p= 0. 309). There was no difference of angle between the femur and tibia in the frontal plane between the groups (graft, = 184 ± 4. 6 degrees, graftless = 183. 4 ± 5. 1 degrees; p= 1. 0), indicating that there is no loss of correction {{due to the lack of}} the graft. There was significant aggravation of osteoarthritis in a greater number of patients in a graft group (p= 0. 005). Conclusion: Autologous iliac bone graft does not improve clinical outcomes in medium and long-term follow-up of medial opening-wedge high tibial osteotomy fixed with a first generation Puddu plate in the conditions of this study...|$|E
40|$|Although {{being debated}} for many years, {{the superiority of}} {{posterior}} cruciate-retaining (CR) total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and posterior-stabilized (PS) TKA remains controversial. We compare the knee scores, post-operative knee range of motion (ROM), radiological outcomes about knee kinematic and complications between CR TKA and PS TKA. Literature published up to August 2015 was searched in PubMed, Embase and Cochrane databases, and meta-analysis was performed using the software, Review Manager version 5. 3. Totally 14 random control trials (RCTs) on this topic were included for the analysis, which showed that PS and CR TKA had {{no significant difference in}} Knee Society knee Score (KSS), pain score (KSPS), Hospital for Special Surgery score (HSS), kinematic characteristics including postoperative component alignment, tibial posterior slope and joint line, and complication rate. However, PS TKA is superior to CR TKA regarding post-operative knee range of motion (ROM) [Random Effect model (RE), Mean Difference (MD) = - 7. 07, 95 % Confidential Interval (CI) - 10. 50 to - 3. 65, p< 0. 0001], improvement of ROM (Fixed Effect model (FE), MD = - 5. 66, 95 % CI - 10. 79 to - 0. 53, p = 0. 03) and <b>femoral-tibial</b> <b>angle</b> [FE, MD = 0. 85, 95 % CI 0. 46 to 1. 25, p< 0. 0001]. There are no clinically relevant differences between CR and PS TKA in terms of clinical, functional, radiological outcome, and complications, while PS TKA is superior to CR TKA in respects of ROM, while whether this superiority matters or not in clinical practice still needs further investigation and longer follow-up...|$|E
