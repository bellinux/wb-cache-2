[...] In 1997, Spin wrote, [...] "Zooropa took U2 as far from the monastic mysticism of The Joshua Tree as they could go. It freed U2 from itself."

Weiss added, [...] "The more we thought about it, Jon is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> against so many old guys with beards in the North that like 'What if she was a tougher audience?' It seemed like an inherently fun scene to watch, it also is terrifying because it's putting a lot of dramatic weight on the shoulders of somebody who needs to be very young." [...] David Benioff concluded the featurette speaking about the Ironborn story, noting [...] "Yara's not a therapist, in our kind of sense of the word, she's not there to tell him to 'buck up' and 'everything's going to be okay,' it's a pretty brutal kind of therapy, but that's who they are, I mean they're essentially a Viking people. There's not {{a lot of room for}} sort of soft, and gentle psychology. I think it's the kind of tough love Theon needed at this point, and when he finally raises his eyes, and looks into her eyes, we see a glimpse of the old Theon that had been lost for so long." ...|$|E

Some of these techniques are ITU-T H. 263 + (or H. 263 Version 2), MJPEG (Motion JPEG) and SPIHT (Set Partitioning In Hierarchical Trees). H. 263 + is a ITU-T video coding standard, MJPEG and SPIHT are common video coding techniques. These video compression formats are optimized for either compression or random access. For example, MJPEG provides excellent random access and moderate compression, while H. 263 + optimizes for compression at the expense of random access. This paper compares the performance of these three formats at bit rates less than 128 kb/s. Simulation results showed that at all bit rates tested, the peak signal-tonoise ratio (PSNR) values are highest for H. 263 +, while SPIHT has better PSNR values compare [...] ...|$|R

[...] Stephen Whitty of The Star-Ledger wrote that [...] "after The Blair Witch Project got by with sticks and stones and offscreen noises, filmmakers started thinking they didn't have to show anything. Well, no. It's better when you don't show too much - but if your story is about the supernatural, eventually you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> with something. The Devil Inside can’t." [...] Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune felt that the film [...] "joins a long, woozy-camera parade of found-footage scare pictures, among them The Blair Witch Project, the Paranormal Activity films and certain wedding videos that won't go away." [...] Michael Rechtshaffen of The Hollywood Reporter stated that the film [...] "proves as scary and unsettling as a slab of devil's food cake - only considerably less satisfying. The New York Times reviewer Manohla Dargis had a positive response to Suzan Crowley's acting and the scenes where the possessed is played by a contortionist, but considered that The Devil Inside was another foray into [...] "a tediously exhausted subgenre that was already creatively tapped out when The Blair Witch Project spooked audiences more than a decade ago." ...|$|R

40|$|State {{and local}} {{pensions}} have been headline {{news since the}} financial collapse reduced {{the value of their}} assets, leaving a substantial unfunded liability. The magnitude of that liability depends on the interest rate used to discount future benefit promises but, regardless of the assumptions, states and localities are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> with more money. This brief looks at the size of the additional funding relative to state budgets. The brief proceeds as follows. The first section provides an overview of state and local plans and in­troduces our sample of six states: California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, and New Jersey. The second section presents data on pension expendi­tures relative to budget totals for states and localities in the aggregate and for our sample of plans. The third section develops baseline budgets for the period 2010 - 2043 for all states and localities and for the six individual states. It then projects annual required pension contributions beginning in 2014 under three scenarios: 1) amortizing the unfunded liability valued at an 8 -percent discount rate over the next 30 years; 2) amortizing the unfunded liability valued at 5 per­cent over the next 30 years; and 3) continuing to pay contributions at current levels until the trust fund is exhausted and then paying benefits on a pay-as-you-go basis. The final section concludes that whereas public plans are substantially underfunded, in the aggregate they currently account for only 3. 8 percent of state and local spending. Assuming 30 -year amortization beginning in 2014, this share would rise to only 5. 0 percent and, even assuming a 5 -percent discount rate, to only 9. 1 percent. Aggregate data, however, hide substantial variation. States that have seriously underfunded plans and/or generous benefits, such as California, Illinois, and New Jersey, would see contributions rise to about 8 percent of budgets with an 8 -percent discount rate and 12. 5 percent with a 5 -percent discount rate.
