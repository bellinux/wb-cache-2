40|$|A simple, low-cost, {{constant}} frequency, analog controller {{is proposed}} for the front-end <b>half-bridge</b> <b>rectifier</b> of a single-phase transformerless UPS system to maintain near unity power factor at the input and zero dc-offset voltage at the output. The controller generates the required gating pulses by comparing the input current with a periodic, bipolar, linear carrier without sensing the input voltage. Two voltage controllers and a single integrator with reset are used to generate the required carrier. All the necessary control operations can be performed without using any PLL, multiplier and/or divider. The controller can be fabricated as a single integrated circuit. The control concept is validated through simulation and also experimentally on an 800 W <b>half-bridge</b> <b>rectifier.</b> Experimental results are presented for ac-dc application, and also for ac-dc-ac UPS application with both sinusoidal and nonlinear loads. The simulation and experimental results agree well...|$|E
40|$|Half-bridge {{rectifiers}} {{are able}} to provide two voltage outputs, which offers three voltage levels, but the two voltage outputs depend on each other and also on system parameters. Moreover, the two voltage outputs contain large ripples because the currents following through the split capacitors contain significant fundamental-frequency components. In this paper, after analyzing the drawbacks of half-bridge rectifiers in detail, an independently controlled neutral leg is added to conventional half-bridge rectifiers to address these drawbacks. Furthermore, the associated decoupling control strategies are proposed. The rectification leg from the conventional <b>half-bridge</b> <b>rectifier</b> is controlled to maintain the dc-bus voltage and to draw a clean sinusoidal current that is in phase with the supply voltage. The neutral leg is controlled with a PI-repetitive controller to regulate one voltage output and also to provide the current path for any dc and/or fundamental-frequency components. As a result, the two voltage outputs are regulated independently and are robust against system parameters. The output voltage ripples are also reduced, and hence, the required capacitance {{to achieve the same}} level of voltage ripples is reduced. Experimental results are provided to validate the performance of the proposed single-phase rectifiers having two independent voltage outputs...|$|E

40|$|There is an {{interest}} in developing electronic devices which do not require wires, such as wireless sensors. However, powering these devices wirelessly is a big challenge. Batteries are one solution to power these devices, except that the energy stored in batteries is not infinite. Current research if focused on extracting electrical energy from the force exerted on a piezoelectric device, placed under a shoe during walking or running or from mechanical vibrations, and supply it to the battery. This paper presents an energy harvesting comparison between fullbridge and <b>half-bridge</b> diode <b>rectifiers,</b> and also an energy harvesting technique with active power electronic circuitry which will control the voltage across the piezoelectric device. In the active approach the piezoelectric device {{is connected to the}} half bridge transistor circuit.

40|$|Abstract. Based on {{the studies}} of the {{problems}} occurred in using single-cycle control method to eliminate the electric Power Harmonic, this article proposes {{a new kind of}} general dead-time setting method with no dead-time effect and testify the effect of single-cycle controlled three-phase APF, for the problem of the dead-time in bridge inverter. In the widely-used full-bridge or <b>half-bridge</b> inverter and <b>rectifier,</b> dead time is usually needed to be set in order to avoid straight-through of two switching tubes of the same bridge arm. Compared with the theoretical waveforms, the output voltage waveform (or current waveform) of the converter is distorted due to the set-up of dead time. The distortion affects the quality of the converter output waveform, and furthermore affects the performance of the converter. In order to eliminate dead-time effect，a commonly used method currently is dynamically adjusting a given value in real time to, according to the deviation of the actual output waveform and the expected output waveform[1]. However, because the converter works at high frequency, adjustment of the expected given value according to the deviation of output often adds complexity to the control loop, and the compensation effect is not satisfactory. This thesis proposes a general dead time setting program with no dead-time effect，and studies the implementation method based on single-cycle control an...|$|R
40|$|A simple analog {{controller}} {{is proposed}} for the single-phase half-bridge pulsewidth modulation rectifier to maintain near unity power factor at the input and balance the voltages across each half of the dc bus. The controller works in the principle of constant-frequency current programmed control. The required gating pulses are generated by comparing the input current with a linear and bipolar carrier without sensing the input voltage. Two voltage controllers and a single reset-integrator are used to generate the carrier. All the necessary control operations are performed without using any phase locked loop, multiplier, and/or divider circuits. Resistor based sensors are {{used to measure the}} voltages across two halves of the dc bus and the input current. The controller can be fabricated as a single integrated circuit. The averaged small signal models and all the necessary design equations are provided. The condition of stability against subharmonic oscillation is analyzed. Calculation of switching and conduction losses is presented. The control concept is validated through simulation and also experimentally on an 800 -W <b>half-bridge</b> <b>rectifier.</b> Experimental results are presented for ac-dc application, and also for ac-dc-ac application with both linear and nonlinear loads at two different output fundamental frequencies (50 and 60 Hz) ...|$|E
40|$|In the {{wireless}} power transfer system for freely moving biomedical implants, the receiving unit was generally inefficient for the reason that its design parameters including the receiving coil’s dimension and receiving circuits’ topology were always determined by experiments. In order to build the relationship between these parameters and the total transfer efficiency, this paper developed a novel efficiency model based on the impedance model of the coil and the circuit model of the receiving circuits. According to the design constraints, the optimal design parameters in the worst case were derived. The results indicate that the combination of the two-layered receiving coil and <b>half-bridge</b> <b>rectifier</b> has more advantages in size, efficiency and safety, which is preferred in the receiving unit. Additionally, when the load resistance increases, the optimal turn number of the receiving coil basically keeps constant and the corresponding transmitting current and total efficiency decrease. For 100 Ω load, the transmitting current and total efficiency in the worst case were measured to be 5. 30 A and 1. 45 % respectively, which are much better than the published results. In general, our work provides an efficient method to determine the design parameters of {{the wireless}} power transfer system for freely moving biomedical implants...|$|E
40|$|Within the {{electronics}} industry {{there is a}} continual demand for DC-DC power converters that achieve high power density at low cost. Since a piezoelectric transformer (PT) has an electrical equivalent circuit {{that is similar to}} several resonant converter topologies, a PT can be used to replace many of the reactive components in these topologies with a single ceramic component, thereby offering potential savings in cost, size, and mass. The first part of this thesis presents a new equivalent circuit model {{for one of the most}} promising types of PT, the radial mode Transoner. This model relates the electrical characteristics of the PT to the physical dimensions and material properties. Considerable insight is then gained about how to design these devices to meet a particular set of converter specifications whilst simultaneously maximising PT power density. The second part of this thesis concerns the effect of the rectifier topology on PT power density. Using concepts from material science, together with equivalent circuit models of both the PT and the rectifier topologies, it is shown that a given PT will always achieve a higher thermally limited maximum output power when used in an AC-output topology compared to a DC-output topology. The half-bridge inductor-less PT-based converter topology is particularly attractive because it requires no additional components between the <b>half-bridge</b> and the <b>rectifier.</b> However, it is difficult to achieve zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) without significantly compromising PT power density when using this topology. The third part of this thesis details the development and experimental verification of a new model for the ZVS condition. Using a normalisation scheme and numerical optimisation techniques, the requirements for achieving inductor-less ZVS are accurately quantified for the first time. The impact of these requirements on PT power density is assessed, and design guidelines for maximising PT power density are given...|$|R
