50|$|Image {{resolution}} of SAR in its range coordinate (expressed in image pixels per <b>distance</b> <b>unit)</b> is mainly {{proportional to the}} radio bandwidth of whatever type of pulse is used. In the cross-range coordinate, the similar resolution is mainly proportional to the bandwidth of the Doppler shift of the signal returns within the beamwidth. Since Doppler frequency depends on {{the angle of the}} scattering point's direction from the broadside direction, the Doppler bandwidth available within the beamwidth is the same at all ranges. Hence the theoretical spatial resolution limits in both image dimensions remain constant with variation of range. However, in practice, both the errors that accumulate with data-collection time and the particular techniques used in post-processing further limit cross-range resolution at long ranges.|$|E

The next largest unit was reported by Cobo to be the topo or tupu, measuring 6,000 thatkiys, or about 7.7 km; careful study has shown that a range of 4.0 to 6.3 km is likely. Next was the wamani, composed of 30 topos (roughly 232 km). To measure area, 25 by 50 wingspans were used, reckoned in topos (roughly 3,280 km2).

The distance is simply the reciprocal of the parallax: [...] For example, Proxima Centauri (the nearest star to Earth other than the Sun), whose parallax is 0.7687, is 1 / 0.7687 = [...] distant.
