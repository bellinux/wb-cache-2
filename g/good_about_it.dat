Travolta responded a week later to the awards: [...] "I didn't even know there were such awards. I have people around me {{whose job it is}} to not tell me about such things. They're obviously doing their job. Not every film can be a critical and box office success. It would have been awful only if Battlefield Earth was neither. That's not the case. It is edging toward the $100m mark which means it has found an audience even if it didn't impress critics. I'd rather my films connect with audiences than with critics because it gives you more longevity as a performer." [...] He later insisted that he still felt [...] "really <b>good</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Here I was taking big chances, breaking a new genre." ...|$|E
500|$|Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter {{gave the}} film a mixed review. He wrote, [...] " [...] is an instant guilty pleasure, a gorgeously shot, {{visually}} complex film whose badness is what's so <b>good</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> You might howl at the sheer audacity of mixing mental illness with the body-fatiguing, mind-numbing rigors of ballet, but its lurid imagery and a hellcat competition between two rival dancers is pretty irresistible." [...] Honeycutt commended Millepied's [...] "sumptuous" [...] choreography and Libatique's [...] "darting, weaving" [...] camera work. The critic {{said of the}} thematic mashup, [...] "Aronofsky ... never succeeds in wedding genre elements {{to the world of}} ballet ... White Swan/Black Swan dynamics almost work, but the horror-movie nonsense drags everything down the rabbit hole of preposterousness." [...] Similarly, in a piece for The Huffington Post, Rob Kirkpatrick praised Portman's performance but compared the film's story to that of Showgirls (1995) and Burlesque (2010) while concluding Black Swan is [...] "simply higher-priced cheese, Aronofsky's camembert to [...] Antin's cheddar.|$|E
500|$|In a September 2008 {{interview}} with BBC Radio 4, Ray Davies said {{of a possible}} reunion, [...] "There is a desire to do it", but that he wouldn't participate {{if it were a}} nostalgia act: [...] "The thing that would make me decide 'yes' or 'no' would be whether or not we could do new songs". He added that the main barrier to the band getting back together was his brother's condition following his stroke. Two months later, he told the BBC that the band was beginning to write new material for a possible reunion, but failed to detail which members were involved. In an interview aired that December on the Biography Channel, Quaife rejected any possibility that he would take part in a reunion. That same month, Ray Davies spoke again about the possibility of performing with his brother: [...] "I suggested he do some low-key shows to see how well he can play. If we're going to play together again, we can't hit the road straight away with a big-time announcement.... But, if Dave feels <b>good</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> and there's good new material that we can write, it'll happen." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1990, Nicholas Meyer {{was brought}} in to direct the sixth film in the series: [...] Roddenberry and he clashed creatively, as Roddenberry felt that having the Enterprise crew hold prejudices against the Klingons did not fit with his view of the universe. Meyer {{described}} a meeting with Roddenberry he later regretted, saying:His guys were lined up {{on one side of the}} room, and my guys were lined up on the other side of the room, and this was not a meeting in which I felt I'd behaved very well, very diplomatically, I came out of it feeling not very good, and I've not felt <b>good</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> ever since. He was not well, and maybe there were more tactful ways of dealing with it, because at the end of the day, I was going to go out and make the movie. I didn't have to take him on. Not my finest hour. In Joel Engel's biography, Gene Roddenberry: The Myth and the Man Behind Star Trek, he states that Roddenberry watched The Undiscovered Country alongside the producers of the film at a private screening two days before his death, and told them they had done a [...] "good job". [...] In contrast, Nimoy and Shatner's memoirs report that after the screening he called his lawyer and demanded a quarter of the scenes be cut; the producers refused.|$|E
500|$|Blogger Andrew Nosnitsky of hip hop blog Cocaine Blunts wrote, [...] "while it's a very {{personal}} and honest affair there's also something, well, not quite <b>good</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> The early buzz about B {{was that he was}} making outsider art and England is probably the closest he comes to that standard. He has ideas about what the creation of spoken word poetry and ambient music entails but it's quite clear he hasnâ€™t taken a ton of time to study those forms." [...] David Morris of Tiny Mix Tapes said that although the album is [...] "conceptually daring" [...] and a showcase for Lil B's [...] "poetic, philosophical streak", he called the musical backing [...] "utter garbage" [...] and [...] "pure, unstructured noodling". Morris blamed what he saw as a misguided effort to be [...] "left-field and trendy" [...] on Lil B's internet hype and coverage in the indie rock press. The Quietus praised the album as [...] "baffling, flawed but utterly engrossing", and said Lil B's flow is [...] "more measured but no less dexterous than his contemporaries, and the pace of his eloquent, brooding verses lend themselves well to the alien, frosted glass synth sounds and syrupy electronics that form the majority of the backing tracks here. Rain In England comes across like the work of some rap savant, a man whose inner filter has been disabled, creating something which may polarise but which is, at least, utterly distinctive." [...] Daniel Levin Becker wrote in Dusted that, despite its unconventionality, the album is [...] "irredeemably bad".|$|E
2500|$|... "Dumb Head" [...] was Arnell's fifth solo single, {{released}} {{over three}} years after her solo debut, and her second for MGM Records, following [...] "Trouble's Back In Town". [...] Her earlier records had been commercial failures, never charting and receiving little press. [...] The record company teamed her with arranger Al Gorgoni and producer Jim Vienneau. [...] Arnell initially disliked the song [...] "Dumb Head", later saying in an interview:I said to my manager, [...] "I'm {{not so sure about}} this song." [...] I didn't like calling myself a dumb head, especially as I had just graduated high school with high honours. [...] How could I call myself dumb and feel <b>good</b> <b>about</b> <b>it?</b> [...] But when we recorded it, with the kazoos in the background and all, it was fun. [...] It came out really good...|$|E

2500|$|Carlisle is a {{supporter}} of several causes. She has been an ardent supporter of LGBT rights, which she made public after her son, James, came out to her at age fourteen. Carlisle is also a vegetarian and {{a supporter}} of animal rights. She and her bandmates were the first stars to pose for PETA's [...] "Rather Go Naked Than Wear Fur" [...] campaign in 1990. In a 2013 interview, she talked {{about going back to}} vegetarianism after a long break, stating that [...] "I fell off the vegetarian wagon and never felt <b>good</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> I wouldn't let myself think of my plate of meat as an animal, but I knew deep inside it was, and actually it was gross, especially chicken. I was full of shame. Then I started practicing yoga, which is all about nonviolence, and realized eating meat isn't compatible with that. Now I teach yoga, and I'm so full of pride not to support factory farms and to be socially responsible." [...] She contributed her song [...] "Bless the Beasts and the Children" [...] to the album Tame Yourself to benefit PETA.|$|E

60|$|The tone now {{commonly}} taken {{toward the}} practice of lying in bed is hypocritical and unhealthy. Of all the marks of modernity that seem to mean a kind of decadence, there is none more menacing and dangerous than the exultation of very small and secondary matters of conduct {{at the expense of}} very great and primary ones, at the expense of eternal ties and tragic human morality. If there is one thing worse than the modern weakening of major morals, it is the modern strengthening of minor morals. Thus it is considered more withering to accuse a man of bad taste than of bad ethics. Cleanliness is not next to godliness nowadays, for cleanliness is made essential and godliness is regarded as an offence. A playwright can attack the institution of marriage so long as he does not misrepresent the manners of society, and I have met Ibsenite pessimists who thought it wrong to take beer but right to take prussic acid. Especially this is so in matters of hygiene; notably such matters as lying in bed. Instead of being regarded, as it ought to be, as a matter of personal convenience and adjustment, it has come to be regarded by many {{as if it were a}} part of essential morals to get up early in the morning. It is upon the whole part of practical wisdom; but there is nothing <b>good</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> or bad about its opposite.|$|E
