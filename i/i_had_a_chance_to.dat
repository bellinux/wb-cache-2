500|$|After {{serving his}} {{suspension}} {{of the rest of}} the , Ron Artest returned to the Pacers at the beginning of the [...] After playing 16 games he demanded to be traded, and the Pacers put him on the injured list. The Pacers' Walsh said that Artest's demands were [...] "the last straw", and many Pacers players who had fought in the brawl to help their teammate felt betrayed. Jackson later said, [...] "I put my career on the line for him, going into the stands and fighting ... I lost $3 million [...] there was no 'thank you' or nothing." [...] After more than a month of inactivity, Indiana traded Artest to the Sacramento Kings for Peja Stojaković. Artest faced Ben Wallace for the first time after the fight in November 2006, and finally made his return to Detroit in January 2007. During the Kings' 91–74 loss to the Pistons, Artest was booed constantly, but there were no unusual incidents. After a year's stop with the Houston Rockets in the 2008–09 season, Artest signed with the Los Angeles Lakers. After winning his first NBA championship in , Artest apologized to Jackson and other Pacers for being [...] "so young and egotistical", stating [...] "sometimes I feel like a coward when I see those guys. I'm on the Lakers, but <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> win with you guys. I feel almost like a coward." [...] On September 16, 2011, Artest legally changed his name to Metta World Peace.|$|E
500|$|The next {{race was}} the Breeders' Cup Classic on November 1. Because many leading older horses retired in 2014, {{most of the}} main contenders for the 2014 Classic were the three year olds: in {{addition}} to California Chrome, former foes Bayern, Candy Boy and Tonalist entered. His chief rival {{was considered to be}} the then-undefeated American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt, Shared Belief, a gelding who missed the Triple Crown series due to hoof problems; the two had never faced each other. California Chrome was 4-1 on the morning line, second favorite to Shared Belief. In the race, Bayern bumped into Shared Belief at the start, then took the lead {{for the duration of the}} race. California Chrome was clear of traffic, maintained third place for most of the race, was closing at the end, and finished a very close third, only a neck behind winner Bayern, who won by a nose over second-place finisher Toast of New York. Shared Belief was fourth. Post race analysis noted that California Chrome stayed on the outside throughout the race, and actually ran 44 feet farther than the winner. [...] Sherman spoke in positive terms of the horse's finish, stating, [...] "My horse ran his eyeballs out. He was right there, right down to the money. I thought it was a great effort. He came back strong." [...] Espinoza was less enthusiastic: [...] "On the backstretch I thought <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> win... The last sixteenth [...] was digging as hard as he could, but getting just a little tired. I wish he had one more race. It was a little too much for him today." [...] Coburn visited the colt the following day and stated, [...] "He was full of himself. I think he thought he won. And if the race had been just a little bit longer, I believe he would have." ...|$|E
2500|$|Peppino's brother Giovanni {{declared}} {{before the}} Italian Antimafia Commission: [...] "It seemed that Badalamenti was well liked by the carabinieri {{as he was}} calm, reliable, and always liked a chat. It almost {{felt like he was}} doing them a favour in that nothing ever happened in Cinisi, it was a quiet little town. If anything, we were subversives who made nuisances of ourselves. This was what the carabinieri thought. When <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> speak to one of them – something which didn't happen often because I didn't really trust them – I realised that it was a widely held belief that Tano Badalamenti was a gentleman and it was us who were the trouble-makers." [...] "I often used to see them walking arm in arm with Tano Badalamenti and his henchmen. You can't have faith in the institutions when you see the police arm in arm with mafiosi." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "After {{you left}} I fired two rounds, and then crawled into the bushes.
