6000|$|... "And a royal blood sends <b>glances</b> <b>up</b> her princely eye to trouble, [...] And {{the shadow}} of a monarch's crown is {{softened}} in her hair," ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How say you, Prince? {{shall we}} cross?" [...] asked Stanley, as they rested on their paddles and cast furtive <b>glances</b> <b>up</b> {{at the dark}} clouds and across the still quiet bay.|$|E
60|$|While {{she blushed}} and blundered, Mr. Dashwood {{had taken the}} manuscript, and was turning over the leaves {{with a pair of}} rather dirty fingers, and casting {{critical}} <b>glances</b> <b>up</b> and down the neat pages.|$|E
60|$|So {{the note}} ran. Frona <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> expectantly at the Indian woman.|$|R
60|$|And Dahlia {{was in the}} drawing-room. She <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> at my entrance.|$|R
60|$|Philippa <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> {{from her}} work with a little exclamation of surprise.|$|R
6000|$|... "Very likely," [...] said he, {{and settled}} down to his book again, {{but his eyes were}} for ever darting little {{suspicious}} <b>glances</b> <b>up</b> at the window. I watched it also, but all was quiet outside.|$|E
6000|$|There {{are none}} of England's daughters that bear a prouder presence. [...] ***** [...] And a kingly blood sends <b>glances</b> <b>up,</b> her princely eye to trouble, [...] And {{the shadow of}} a monarch's crown is {{softened}} in her hair.|$|E
60|$|The men {{followed}} {{them out on}} the yard, and worked in desperate haste, with occasional <b>glances</b> <b>up</b> at the mast head. In a couple of minutes the sail was firmly secured in its gaskets, and all made their way below.|$|E
60|$|Philippa <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> to {{find her}} companion's dark eyes fixed upon her.|$|R
60|$|She <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> {{at him and}} waited. Arnold, however, {{had stopped}} short.|$|R
60|$|Dane nodded, and {{the girl}} <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> and down the lane suspiciously.|$|R
6000|$|... "When {{shall we}} start?" [...] I ask presently, as we return, rather like bashful yokels, to the library, {{and the old}} gentleman reading the Arabian Nights in the {{armchair}} in the corner <b>glances</b> <b>up</b> {{at me with a}} sudden curiosity.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Weevle again <b>glances</b> <b>up</b> {{and down}} the court and then looks at the stationer. Mr. Snagsby, blankly {{catching}} his eye, looks upward for a star or so and coughs a cough expressive of not exactly seeing {{his way out of}} this conversation.|$|E
6000|$|They are all alike, the wits of Queen Anne; {{and even}} Matt Prior, {{when he writes}} of ladies occasionally, writes down to them, or at least <b>glances</b> <b>up</b> very saucily from his {{position}} on his knees. But Prior {{is the best of}} them, and the most candid: ...|$|E
60|$|Elma <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> at {{him with}} a certain tinge of half-incredulous surprise.|$|R
60|$|He <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> hastily, and she {{answered}} the question in his eyes.|$|R
60|$|Ursula crimsoned. Her {{girls were}} <b>glancing</b> <b>up</b> at her, smirking their accusation.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] Very {{apprehensive}} {{of being}} overheard, Jo looks {{about him and}} even <b>glances</b> <b>up</b> some ten feet {{at the top of}} the hoarding and through the cracks in it lest the object of his distrust should be looking over or hidden on the other side.|$|E
6000|$|There's a lady, an earl's daughter,--she {{is proud}} {{and she is}} noble, [...] And she treads the crimson carpet and she {{breathes}} the perfumed air, [...] And a kingly blood sends <b>glances</b> <b>up,</b> her princely eye to trouble, [...] And {{the shadow of a}} monarch's crown is softened in her hair.|$|E
60|$|Then Master Fernald {{walked a}} few paces in advance of his friends, moving stealthily, as if knowing danger menaced them on every hand, and casting furtive <b>glances</b> <b>up</b> {{and down the street}} until, had any one {{observed}} his movements, suspicions must have been aroused as to the innocence of his purpose.|$|E
60|$|Lady Cicely, after {{a single}} <b>glance</b> <b>up,</b> {{continues}} stitching, apparently quite unconcerned.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Raggett started, and <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> at {{somebody}} leaning from the window.|$|R
60|$|The {{young man}} <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> in surprise, and asked who was there.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Burton, still {{propping}} him up, trod {{a measure}} with fewer steps, and cast uneasy <b>glances</b> <b>up</b> the lonely road. On their left the sea broke quietly {{on the beach}} below; on their right were one or two scattered cottages, at the doors of which an occasional figure appeared to gaze in mute astonishment at the proceedings.|$|E
60|$|He led {{him into}} a {{neighboring}} bar, and a little later {{the crew of the}} schooner, who had been casting anxious and curious <b>glances</b> <b>up</b> the quay, saw the couple approaching them. Both captains were smoking big cigars in honor of the occasion, and Captain Gething, before going on board, halted, and in warm terms noticed the appearance of the Seamew.|$|E
60|$|For {{half an hour}} he sat {{in silent}} {{enjoyment}} of the situation--enjoyment {{which would have been}} increased if he could have seen Mr. Rose standing at the gate of Holly Farm, casting anxious <b>glances</b> <b>up</b> and down the road. Celia's luggage had gone down to the White Swan, and an excellent cold luncheon was awaiting her attention in the living-room.|$|E
60|$|The boy <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> and {{saw them}} {{standing}} there. He excused himself gracefully.|$|R
60|$|The {{girl looked}} {{thoughtful}} a moment; then <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> {{with a bright}} smile.|$|R
60|$|Philip <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> with a {{quick look}} of {{expectant}} curiosity, but said nothing.|$|R
6000|$|BARBARA [looking at Bill, whose {{attitude}} has never changed, and whose expression of brooding wrath has deepened] Oh, we shall cure him in no time. Just watch. [She {{goes over to}} Bill and waits. He <b>glances</b> <b>up</b> at her and casts his eyes down again, uneasy, but grimmer than ever]. It {{would be nice to}} just stamp on Mog Habbijam's face, wouldn't it, Bill? ...|$|E
60|$|The {{wind had}} abated {{somewhat}} in violence {{as they walked}} home, and, moreover, they had their backs to it. The walk was slower and more enjoyable in many respects than the walk out. In an unusually soft mood she replied to his remarks and stole little critical <b>glances</b> <b>up</b> at him. When they reached the house she stood a little while at the gate gazing at the starry sky {{and listening to the}} crash of the sea on the beach.|$|E
60|$|He was silent. His {{silence was}} {{positively}} noisy. He {{wanted her to}} hear it. But {{it is difficult to}} be sulky with a bland, plump woman of thirty who remembers your childhood trick of biting your nails, and <b>glances</b> <b>up</b> at you from her embroidery, occasionally patting her brown silk hair or smoothing her brown silk waist in a way which implies a good digestion, a perfect memory of the morning's lesson of her Sunday-school class, and a mild disbelief in men as anything except relatives, providers, card-players, and nurslings. Carl gave up the silence-cure.|$|E
60|$|She merely <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> at his entrance. Her {{eyes were}} still far away.|$|R
60|$|He <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> {{from his}} work to behold--none other than Colonel Comyn Carvel.|$|R
60|$|He <b>glanced</b> <b>up</b> to Jacob Welse, {{as though}} for consent, and {{received}} it.|$|R
