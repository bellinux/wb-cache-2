40|$|The {{research}} {{was carried out}} {{on the grounds of}} milk performance as well as the traits related to condition, type, and build of first-calf cows from the Kujawsko-Pomorskie province. The research covered the body condition scores of 333 cows as well as build and conformation scores of 645 animals. A group of 135 cows was distinguished from the analyzed cows which met the following criteria: first-calf cows, their first calving took place in 2007, all the animals in their first lactation were scored in the area of their type and build as well as the condition up to the hundredth day of lactation. The highest productivity of milk and its components was found in cows with the highest type and build scores. A negative relation between body condition scoring and <b>first-calf</b> <b>cow</b> milk performance results as well as cow type and build scoring was found. High and positive correlations between build general scoring and partial scoring pertaining to conformation were found...|$|E
40|$|A study {{replicated}} {{over two}} years involving 197 <b>first-calf</b> <b>cows</b> compared reproductive performance, growth and health of calves and concentration of Cu in liver, colostrum, and milk. Three treatments were evaluated: control (no Cu but Mo and Fe added to hay diet); 200 mg Cu from CuSO 4; and 100 mg Cu from AvailaCu® added daily. In 1998 a fourth treatment, 400 mg AvailaZn® was included with 100 mg AvailaCu®. Supplementation of Cu and/or Zn did not improve total pregnancy rate, or growth and health of calves. In 1998 cows fed only AvailaCu® conceived 10 days earlier compared to controls; however, in 1997 no differences in date of conception were found. Cu in colostrum and milk, and IgG levels in colostrum and calf serum were not improved by Cu supplementation...|$|R
40|$|Phosphorus (P) {{deficiency}} {{is a major}} constraint to {{the productivity}} of breeder herds grazing low-P rangelands due to adverse effects on growth and fertility. However, P supplementation during the wet season, when additional dietary P is most needed, is often difficult due to practical constraints. Body P reserves in breeders can be mobilised and alleviate dietary P deficiency within an annual cycle. Approaches to estimate bone P reserves and net mobilisation or replenishment of P from the analysis of rib and hip (tuber coxae) biopsies are discussed. In at least some circumstances, breeder cows grazing P-deficient pastures mobilise bone P to alleviate the effects of diet P deficiency. Recent experiments with breeders have investigated mobilisation of body P to alleviate the adverse effects of dietary P deficiency during pregnancy and early lactation, and subsequent replenishment of body P reserves. Both mature <b>cows</b> and <b>first-calf</b> <b>cows</b> (FCC) calving in a high P status and fed severely P-deficient diets during lactation were able to mobilise sufficient body P reserves to provide milk for moderate calf growth (viz. 0. 6 - 0. 8 kg liveweight (LW) /day for 3 months), but this was associated with rapid cow-LW loss and markedly decreased bone P content. <b>First-calf</b> <b>cows</b> appear to have lesser capacity than mature cows to mobilise body P. FCC fed P-adequate diets during late pregnancy maintained high voluntary intakes and had higher LW and bone P reserves at calving. When fed a P-deficient diet during early lactation, these greater bone P reserves were utilised. Bone P reserves can be replenished by P-adequate diets fed post-weaning. Breeder management that relies more on mobilising body P reserves when P demands are high and on replacing these body P reserves when P demands are lower offers an opportunity to alleviate the effects of dietary P deficiencies during the early wet season in situations where P supplementation is not possible...|$|R
40|$|In three grazing {{experiments}} in the seasonally dry tropics of Australia, growing steers (Experiment 1), <b>first-calf</b> <b>cows</b> (Experiment 2) and mature breeder cows (Experiment 3), ingested diets for 12 – 17 months, which were either adequate or severely deficient in phosphorus (P) (Padeq and Pdefic, respectively). Bone mineral density (BMD) at the proximal end of the ninth coccygeal vertebra (Cy 9) was measured at intervals using single photon absorptiometry (SPA). Liveweight (LW) and plasma inorganic phosphorus (PIP) concentrations were monitored at intervals and rib-bone cortical bone thickness (CBT) of biopsy samples was measured {{at the end of}} Experiments 1 and 3. Measurements of LW change, PIP concentrations and CBT confirmed that diet P intakes of cattle in the Padeq treatments were adequate whereas there was severe and chronic P deficiency in the Pdefic treatments. In Experiment 1 BMD in Padeq steers increased with LW and age from ~ 0. 25 – 0. 27 g/cc (8 months, 200 kg LW) to ~ 0. 34 g/cc (32 months, 490 kg LW), whereas in Pdefic steers BMD decreased progressively to ~ 0. 23 – 0. 24 g/cc. Although BMD decreased in the Pdefic steers bone volume of Cy 9 (calculated from tail-bone thickness) increased, and some net bone deposition in the Cy 9 continued. Rib-bone CBT and tail-bone BMD at the end of Experiment 1 were closely correlated (r = 0. 93). In Experiment 2 BMD was initially 0. 33 g/cc (~ 25 months, 400 kg LW) and did not change through pregnancy and lactation in Padeq cows. However, in the Pdefic cows there was a gradual decline in BMD to ~ 0. 25 g/cc. There was no change in dimensions of the Cy 9 so the decreases in BMD involved net demineralisation of bone. In Experiment 3 BMD was less responsive to P deficiency than in Experiments 1 and 2. Only after ~ 11 months was BMD reduced (P < 0. 05) in the Pdefic cows, and then only by 15 %. In contrast, rib-bone CBT decreased by 30 % due to P deficiency, and BMD was poorly correlated with CBT (r = 0. 4). The effects of animal weight, age and maturity on tailbone BMD of P-adequate animals, and the different responses to P deficiency observed in young growing steers, <b>first-calf</b> <b>cows</b> and mature breeders are discussed in relation to the use of SPA measured tail-bone BMD to diagnose P deficiency in grazing cattle...|$|R
40|$|This work {{evaluated}} the reproductive performance of <b>first-calf</b> <b>cows</b> at {{three years of}} age, submitted or not to protein supplementation at yearling on natural pastures. After calving, cows were managed on natural or improved pastures. The feeding managements were the following: on natural pastures as yearlings and during pregnancy, post-calving period and breeding season; on natural pastures with protein supplement as yearlings and only natural pasture during pregnancy, post-calving and breeding season; on natural pastures as yearlings and during pregnancy and on improved natural pastures (Lolium multiflorum L., Trifolium repens cv. Yi and Lotus corniculatus cv. São Gabriel) during the post-calving period and breeding season; on natural pastures with protein supplement at yearling, on natural pastures during pregnancy, and on improved natural pasture during post-calving period and breeding season. Cows did not differ on body weight, but from calving {{to the beginning of}} breeding season, cows on improved natural pastures presented higher weight gain than those on natural pastures (0. 203 vs. 0. 109 kg/day). Cows in post-calving on natural pastures lost 1. 0 point of body condition score during mating, determinant of the lowest pregnancy rate and later conception in relation to cows on improved natural pasture. Pregnant cows presented higher body weight (440 vs. 413 kg) and body condition score (4. 14 vs. 3. 66 points) than open cows {{at the end of the}} breeding season...|$|R

40|$|Current control {{practices}} against gastrointestinal nematodes in {{dairy cows}} rely strongly on anthelmintic use. To reduce {{the development of}} anthelmintic resistance or disposition of drug residues in the environment, novel control approaches are currently proposed that target anthelmintic treatment to individual animals instead of the whole herd. However, such selective treatment strategies come with additional costs for labor and diagnostics and, so far, no studies have addressed whether they could be economically sustainable. The objectives {{of this study were}} to (1) investigate the economic effects at farm level of whole-herd versus more selective anthelmintic treatment strategies in adult dairy cows, and (2) determine how these economic effects depend on level of infection and herd size. A Monte Carlo simulation, fed by current epidemiological and economical knowledge, was used to estimate the expected economic effects and possible variation of different control strategies under Belgian conditions. Four treatment strategies were compared with a baseline situation in which no treatments were applied: whole herd at calving (S 1), selective at calving with (S 2) or without (S 3) treatment of the <b>first-calf</b> <b>cows,</b> and wholeherd when animals are moved from grazing to the barn in the fall (housing treatment, S 4). The benefit per lactation for an average dairy herd varied between -$ 2 and $ 131 (average $ 64) for S 1, between -$ 2 and $ 127 (average $ 62) for S 2, between -$ 17 and $ 104 (average $ 43) for S 3, and between -$ 41 and $ 72 (average $ 15) for S 4. The farmer’s risk associated with any treatment strategy, as indicated by the width of the 95 % credible intervals of economic benefit of anthelmintic treatment, decreased with increasing level of exposure, as assessed by bulk tank milk ELISA. The order of the different strategies when sorted by expected benefit was robust to changes in economic input parameters. We conclude that, on average, strategies applying anthelmintic treatment at calving outperform a strategy applying treatment at housing. Within the strategies that applied treatment at calving, more selective treatment strategies can be economically sustainable. However, given the large variation in possible benefits within each treatment strategy, decision support systems are needed to account for the multitude of cow, epidemiological, and economic factors that determine the economics of nematode control and select the optimal treatment strategy for a specific farm.

40|$|In {{the current}} cow-calf {{production}} {{system in the}} United States when restricted breeding seasons are used a heifer must calve by two years of age to obtain maximum lifetime productivity. Heifers that reach puberty {{at a younger age}} and have ≥ 3 estrous cycles have a greater chance of conceiving early in their first breeding season than contemporaries. Due to the longer postpartum period of an estrus of <b>first-calf</b> <b>cows</b> calving at two years age, heifers that conceive early in the breeding season have a greater opportunity to initiate estrous cycles before the next breeding season and become pregnant. In contrast, heifers that do not reach puberty until after the breeding season starts, conceive later in the breeding season and subsequently calve later the following year. Calving late in the calving season increases the chances of heifers not becoming pregnant during the following breeding season and being lost from the herd. Therefore, age at puberty is an important reproductive trait in developing replacement heifers. Improved management practices and selection of reproductive traits have enhanced the physiological processes associated with attainment of puberty to maximize the number of heifers that reach puberty before the breeding season. Development of replacement heifers {{in the presence of a}} mature sterile bull is a management practice that decreases the age at which puberty is attained compared to heifers developed in the absence of a bull. However. increased selection pressure applied to age of puberty in heifers and the subsequent decrease in age at puberty has some disadvantages. Heifers reaching puberty and initiating estrous cycles at a young age while still suckling their dams are often exposed to fertile bulls during the darns breeding season or to intact male calves before weaning. Exposure to fertile bulls during this time period could result in heifers that become pregnant at a very young age and calve as yearlings. These heifers usually conceive late in the breeding season and calve late or after the normal calving season as yearlings. These heifers are of small body size which increases the chances of dystocia that sometimes results in loss of the calf and/or heifer, increased labor and time required for postpartum recovery. The combination of small body size and increased dystocia result in the majority of these animals failing to conceive during the following breeding season. Money invested in developing the heifer would be lost. In addition, precocious puberty in heifers that are destined to be sold as market animals results in heifers becoming pregnant prior to entering the feedlot. Pregnant feedlot heifers have decreased feed efficiency and growth rate compared to nonpregnant heifers which is a factor for lower prices paid by feedlots for heifers compared to steers. The research objectives were to determine the percentage of heifers developed at the University of Nebraska research station that exhibit precocious puberty and if exposure to bulls would affect the incidence of precocious puberty...|$|R
