25|$|If {{the rail}} {{line has been}} built with {{sufficient}} vertical clearance then Double-stack rail transport can be used. Where lines are electrified with overhead <b>electric</b> <b>wiring</b> double stacking is normally not possible. The mandatory requirement to fit under overhead wire for the traction engine electrical power supply sets the height limit for the railcars to allow for trailer transport. This requires a certain low building height {{which led to a}} minor size of wheels for the railcars. Hence increased degradation of bogeys by wheel wear-out is a cost disadvantage for the system.|$|E
25|$|Contact voltage energizes objects {{which are}} {{normally}} safe – fences, telephone booths, street signs, etc. Anywhere buried <b>electric</b> <b>wiring</b> exists, a failure {{can occur in}} that wiring and create conditions that allow electricity to flow into the immediate surroundings. Some systems have protective devices such as circuit breakers or Ground Fault Circuit Interrupters (GFCI), designed to isolate such a fault. However, {{in the absence of}} protective devices, if the devices fail, or if they are not installed correctly, a fault will go undetected until it either causes a failure of the circuit or until it is found by a person.|$|E
25|$|On November 28, 1912, around 10:30pm, a fire, {{probably}} due to faulty <b>electric</b> <b>wiring,</b> {{broke out in the}} attic of the newest administration building, where a Thanksgiving dance was being held. The approximately 80 students on the premises evacuated themselves safely, and then formed a makeshift bucket brigade. The fire departments summoned from nearby Hyattsville and Washington, D.C., arrived too late. Fanned by a strong southwest wind, the fire destroyed the barracks where the students were housed, all the school's records, and most of the academic buildings, leaving only Morrill Hall untouched. The loss was estimated at $250,000 (about $5.8 million in 2012 U.S. dollars) despite no injuries or fatalities. The devastation was so great that many never expected the university to reopen. University President Richard Silvester resigned, brokenhearted.|$|E

Along {{with the}} people {{environmental}} protection consciousness enhancement, the enterprise and the family are inclined to use the green <b>electric</b> <b>wire</b> and cable to reduce the environmental pollution. This paper firstly introduces the concept of green <b>electric</b> <b>wire</b> and cable, and then expounds thecurrent situation of green <b>electric</b> <b>wire</b> and cable materials, finally gives the development tendency of green <b>electric</b> <b>wire</b> and cable materialsin order to provide references for the related researchers. Concept of Green <b>Electric</b> <b>Wire</b> and Cable The green <b>electric</b> <b>wire</b> and cable is also called environmental-friendly <b>electric</b> <b>wire</b> and cable, which is {{a new type of}} the wire and cable aggressively promoted in the world. It is characterized little environmental pollution and harm to human body in the product manufacturing and use. The main requirements of green environmental protection cable are no halogen, flame retardant, not produce toxic and corrosive gas, and not contain heavy metals, easy recycling. The main technical conditions for environmental protection type of wire and cable: Cable halogen containing heavy metals and harmful chemicals can cause the air, water and soil pollution, already is an indisputable fact.

25|$|In 1994 a {{hydrographic survey}} of the area {{to the east of}} Muhurraq Island off the end of the runway located a wing of an {{aircraft}} subsequently identified as that of DC-4 F-BBDM. A seabed inspection of the area located two of the Pratt & Whitney radial engines and three bent propellers together with assorted aircraft debris consisting of part of the tailplane, <b>electric</b> <b>wiring,</b> small passenger items and broken bottles. The Christian Cemetery Committee responsible for the maintenance of the Old Christian Cemetery in which the 86 casualties had originally been interred approved the idea of a permanent memorial. A joint venture between the Bahrain-based diving company TECHDIVE and Royal Navy divers recovered the least damaged propeller and after sandblasting and painting, it was mounted in the cemetery. In December the memorial was formerly dedicated by the French Ambassador, various church dignitaries and those involved in its recovery.|$|E

60|$|It {{can hardly}} be due to {{anything}} in the curriculum or programme of studies. Indeed, to any one accustomed to the best models of a university curriculum as it flourishes in the United States and Canada, the programme of studies is frankly quite laughable. There is less Applied Science in the place than would be found with us in a theological college. Hardly a single professor at Oxford would recognise a dynamo if he met it in broad daylight. The Oxford student learns nothing of chemistry, physics, heat, plumbing, <b>electric</b> <b>wiring,</b> gas-fitting {{or the use of}} a blow-torch. Any American college student can run a motor car, take a gasoline engine to pieces, fix a washer on a kitchen tap, mend a broken electric bell, and give an expert opinion on what has gone wrong with the furnace. It is these things indeed which stamp him as a college man, and occasion a very pardonable pride in the minds of his parents.|$|E
