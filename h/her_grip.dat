5|$|Shortly {{after her}} 17th {{birthday}} {{she changed her}} hair colour with a pink rinse. She took judo lessons once {{a week at a}} local school, but found partners reluctant to train with her, as she was often slow to release <b>her</b> <b>grip.</b> She took a job at Bratby and Hinchliffe, an engineering company in Gorton, but was dismissed for absenteeism after six months.|$|E
5|$|After his victory, Zabdas marched {{south along}} the Jordan Valley and {{apparently}} met little opposition. There is evidence that Petra was attacked by a small contingent which penetrated the region. Arabia and Judaea were eventually subdued. Palmyrene dominance of Arabia is confirmed by many milestones bearing Vaballathus' name. Syrian subjugation required less effort because Zenobia had substantial support there, particularly in Antioch, Syria's traditional capital. The invasion of Arabia coincided with the cessation of coin production in Claudius' name by the Antiochean mint, indicating that Zenobia had begun tightening <b>her</b> <b>grip</b> on Syria. By November 270, the mint began issuing coinage in Vaballathus' name.|$|E
5|$|Larter defined Clear {{as a girl}} who's {{suffered}} numerous {{losses in}} her life, has fallen into herself, and has made a life within that. She broadened her description as an estranged artist who's holding to <b>her</b> <b>grip</b> for what the world has given her. In the original screenplay of James Wong and Glen Morgan, she is described as the loner in the group who wears dark colors to hide her sex appeal, something she's insecure about. Larter dyed her hair brunette {{for the majority of}} the film to suit Clear's gothic outlook. Despite this, Larter reverted to her original blonde hair colour for the film's ending.|$|E

5|$|Stealing a Ride follows two children, Susie Gay and Johnnie Eddy, {{who are out}} tobogganing on sleds. The two see Susie's parents {{going out}} for a drive in a sleigh and ask to come along. The parents refuse and {{secretly}} two hitch their sleds behind the sleigh. When going up a hill, Susie loses <b>her</b> <b>grip</b> on her sled and Johnnie tries to save her from falling in vain. The two fall off and are unable to catch up the sleigh. The children wander into the woods and become lost. When Susie's parents discover the empty sleds they turn back and track down the children by the footprints they left in the snow {{with the aid of a}} dog. The parents find them asleep in the snow and bring them back home in the sleigh. The children are punished by spanking and then kissed by their parents for their actions.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor {{explains}} that crossing the Void causes a traveller to become saturated in Void material. If {{he opens the}} breach and reverses it, anything saturated in Void material will be pulled in. Everyone except Jackie has crossed the breach and is thus vulnerable to being trapped in the Void, so the Doctor sends them all to the parallel universe. Rose decides she would rather be with the Doctor than her family and jumps back to help him. The Cybermen attempt to stop the Doctor but are repelled by a converted Ms. Hartman, who has resisted the effects of her conversion and at least partially retains her sense of self. The Doctor and Rose open the breach and hang on to magnetic clamps as the Cybermen and Daleks are pulled in. The Cult of Skaro use an emergency temporal shift to escape. Rose's lever slips, and in resetting it she loses <b>her</b> <b>grip</b> and plunges toward the Void. At the last second, Pete reappears and grabs her, and together they transport back to the parallel universe. The breach closes, leaving a devastated Rose trapped in the parallel universe. The devices used to travel between the two worlds have also stopped working. The Doctor presses his ear against the wall, as a tearful Rose does {{the same in the}} other universe, as if trying to listen for each other.|$|E
25|$|How {{the brush}} is held {{depends on the}} {{calligrapher}} and which calligraphic genre is practiced. Commonly, the brush is held vertically straight gripped between the thumb and middle finger. The index finger lightly touches {{the upper part of}} the shaft of the brush (stabilizing it) while the ring and little fingers tuck under the bottom of the shaft, leaving a space inside the palm. Alternatively, the brush is held in the right hand between the thumb and the index finger, very much like a Western pen. A calligrapher may change his or <b>her</b> <b>grip</b> depending on the style and script. For example, a calligrapher may grip higher for cursive and lower for regular script.|$|E

25|$|Lulu begins {{investigating}} Rick's death, {{and starts}} to suspect Tracy's brother Alan Quartermaine (Stuart Damon) and his wife Monica Quartermaine (Leslie Charleson) of the murder, since Monica and Rick had been lovers. However, when Alan dies from a heart attack, Lulu intercepts a letter from Alan to her father revealing that Scott actually killed Rick. Lulu teams up with her boyfriend Logan Hayes (Josh Duhon) to prove Scott's guilt, while Scott attempts to gain guardianship of Laura. After telling Lulu that Luke raped Laura, Scott is able to gain custody of her, only to have Luke kidnap Laura and send her into hiding. Logan reveals himself to be Scott's son, and his relationship with Lulu begins to unravel after interference from Maxie. Laura, meanwhile, is returned to Shadybrook and Nikolas is again given guardianship. Desperate to get Lulu back, Logan attacks Maxie and when he realizes that Lulu has witnessed this he breaks into the penthouse she is sharing with her new boyfriend Johnny Zacchara (Brandon Barash). Lulu is forced to stab him with a knife, and after fleeing from police with Johnny, Lulu begins to lose <b>her</b> <b>grip</b> on reality and is eventually placed in the same asylum as her mother.|$|E
500|$|Ali Larter, {{who starred}} in the 1999 film Varsity Blues, was cast as female lead Clear Rivers. [...] "The film shows {{how easy it is}} to turn on someone, to blame someone when you're scared," [...] Larter said. [...] "It's also about trusting your intuitions and yourself". She defined her part as [...] "that girl who has a lot of loss in her life and has fallen for herself, and had made a life within that. She's an artist, she lives by herself, and she's kinda holding to <b>her</b> <b>grip</b> for what the world has given her".|$|E
500|$|Michael's father, George Bluth Sr. (Jeffrey Tambor), is {{the patriarch}} of the family, a corrupt real estate {{developer}} arrested in the first episode, hence {{the name of the}} series. George goes to considerable lengths to manipulate and control his family in spite of imprisonment, and makes numerous efforts to evade justice. His wife, and Michael's mother, Lucille (Jessica Walter), is ruthlessly manipulative, materialistic, and hypercritical of every member of her family, as well as perpetually drinking alcohol. <b>Her</b> <b>grip</b> is tightest around her youngest son, Byron [...] "Buster" [...] Bluth (Tony Hale), an over-educated (yet still under-educated) mother's boy who has dependency issues and is prone to panic attacks.|$|E

500|$|The {{remaining}} members opt {{to climb up}} the elevator shaft {{at the risk of}} destabilizing the pool. In the process, Janice loses <b>her</b> <b>grip</b> and falls into the shark-infested water. Despite Carter's attempts to save her, the shark ultimately kills her. In the facility's kitchen, which has been partially flooded, cook Sherman [...] "Preacher" [...] Dudley manages to kill the first shark with an explosion. He then makes his way to the elevator shaft, where he encounters Carter, Tom and Susan. Carter and Tom go to the flooded laboratory to activate a control panel that drains a stairway to the surface, while Susan heads to her room to collect her research material. Carter and Tom reach the control panel, but the largest shark ultimately kills Tom and destroys the controls. In her room, Susan is ambushed by another shark, but manages to kill it with a power cable, destroying her research in the process.|$|E
500|$|While {{attending}} a party thrown for the Gotham Police Department, Kate meets and flirts with detective Maggie Sawyer, and runs into her cousin Bette Kane (better {{known as the}} Teen Titans member Flamebird). Kate is apparently unaware of her cousin's vigilante activities, and inadvertently hurts her feelings when she cuts her off {{in the middle of}} a conversation to answer her cell phone. While dancing with Maggie, Kate discovers that Alice has kidnapped her father and plans to destroy Gotham by spreading a deadly airborne chemical from a hijacked airplane, thus succeeding where Mannheim failed. Batwoman boards the plane and defeats Alice's subordinates, eventually stopping the plot and rescuing her father in the process. However, Alice is accidentally thrown from the plane, only to be caught by Batwoman. Alice then shocks her by saying that Batwoman has [...] "Our father's eyes," [...] apparently revealing that she is in fact Kate's sister Beth (who was believed to have been killed years ago). With Batwoman stunned by the revelation, Alice stabs her in the wrist with a knife. Batwoman is forced to release <b>her</b> <b>grip,</b> sending Alice to her apparent demise in the river below.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{critics were}} less kind. Robert Barnard wrote [...] "Another murder-in-the-past case, with nobody able to {{remember}} anything clearly, including, alas, the author. At one time {{we are told that}} General Ravenscroft and his wife (the dead pair) were respectively sixty and thirty-five; later we are told he {{had fallen in love with}} his wife's twin sister 'as a young man'. The murder/suicide is once said to have taken place ten to twelve years before, elsewhere fifteen, or twenty. Acres of meandering conversations, hundreds of speeches beginning with 'Well, …' That sort of thing may happen in life, but one doesn't want to read it." [...] According to The Cambridge Guide to Women's Writing in English, this novel is one of the [...] "execrable last novels" [...] where Christie [...] "loses <b>her</b> <b>grip</b> altogether".|$|E
60|$|Mistress Endicott was {{the color}} of wax, <b>her</b> husband was <b>gripping</b> <b>her</b> wrist with a clutch of steel, trying, through the {{administration}} of physical pain, to keep alive her presence of mind.|$|R
60|$|He flung {{her from}} {{him back into}} the chair. In his left hand he held the pistol he had taken from the bosom of her gown--a dainty little affair of ivory and silver. He turned it over curiously. She lay back in the chair where he had thrown <b>her,</b> <b>gripping</b> its sides with tremulous fingers, her eyes deep-set, distended, staring at him. He thrust the weapon into his pocket.|$|R
60|$|Alvina ran upstairs. She found Mrs. Tuke {{crouched}} in a chair, with a drawn, horrified, terrified face. As <b>her</b> pains suddenly <b>gripped</b> <b>her,</b> she uttered an exclamation, {{and pressed her}} clenched fists hard on her face.|$|R
60|$|She fumbled in her pocket, craning awkwardly to keep <b>her</b> <b>grip</b> {{upon the}} baby.|$|E
60|$|She {{suddenly}} relaxed <b>her</b> <b>grip</b> of his arm. Something {{of the old}} hopelessness was {{settling down}} upon her face. Her hands fell into her lap.|$|E

60|$|Mrs. Lyons had resumed her seat. Her {{hands were}} {{grasping}} {{the arms of}} her chair, and I saw that the pink nails had turned white with the pressure of <b>her</b> <b>grip.</b>|$|E
60|$|I {{went back}} to the sitting-room. She hadn't moved an inch. She was still bolt upright on the edge of <b>her</b> chair, <b>gripping</b> <b>her</b> {{umbrella}} like a hammer-thrower. She gave me another of those looks as I came in. There was no doubt about it; for some reason she had taken a dislike to me. I suppose because I wasn't George M. Cohan. It was a bit hard on a chap.|$|R
