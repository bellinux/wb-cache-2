Meanwhile, Bart starts school, but he finds that his new class is far above the standards of Springfield Elementary. When his teacher discovers that Bart cannot read cursive writing, he places him in a remedial class, much to Bart's shock. Lisa goes for a nature walk and discovers that she is allergic to all of the plants around Cypress Creek. Marge tries to go about her daily chores, but the house does everything automatically. This ends up depressing her to the point where Marge starts drinking wine to cope.

5|$|The major field {{operation}} of the fall was Hood's Franklin-Nashville Campaign, an invasion of Tennessee, which he undertook despite Beauregard's counsel that it made little operational or logistical sense. Hood did not treat Beauregard with the respect due to the department commander, communicating his plans reluctantly and making movements {{without regard to the}} consequences for his supply line, which Beauregard scrambled to maintain. While Hood traveled through Alabama and into Tennessee, Union Maj. Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman began his March to the Sea from Atlanta to Savannah, which focused Beauregard's attention back to Georgia. He was ineffective in stopping, or even delaying, Sherman's advance. He had inadequate local forces and was reluctant to strip defenses from other locations to concentrate them against Sherman. Furthermore, Sherman did an <b>excellent</b> <b>job</b> of deceiving the Confederates as to the intermediate and final targets of his march. Savannah fell on December 21 and Sherman's army began to march north into South Carolina in January. Also in late December, Beauregard found out that Hood's army had been severely damaged in its defeat at the Battle of Nashville; there were very few men in fighting condition who could oppose Sherman's advance.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to design {{ophthalmic}} lenses that correct peripheral refractive errors of human eyes along a meridian. We designed lenses with the tangential section of one surface based on a figured spheroid but figured in the tangential section only. The curvature of the sagittal section of this surface was adjusted separately. A merit function was used to modify these surfaces until the lenses had power errors that corrected the eye. Examples are presented of lenses that correct a schematic eye. They do <b>excellent</b> <b>jobs</b> of correcting the peripheral power errors of the eye and are relatively insensitive to small changes in fitting distance. We conclude that it is theoretically feasible to design lenses to correct peripheral refractive errors...|$|R

50|$|Second is extra-curricular {{support for}} students.

Therefore, RDF staff take personal interest in students and assist in various ways, including providing personal counseling, persuading parents to keep children in school, seeking sponsors for students, and providing logistical support for graduates seeking employment or further training away from home.Third is keeping graduates connected to their home areas. Helping rural kids graduate and move to middle class careers in the city only depletes rural resources unless the graduates remain closely involved with their homecommunities.

There are simple safety skills and understandings that can be easily incorporated into computer usage. Six hundred (600) questionnaires were personally administered to computer operators and other computer-users ranging from Students, Lecturers, Bankers, Civil Servants to Health Workers in the major cities of South- West of Nigeria. The result of the survey was analysed using SPSS and descriptive statistical techniques. The study shows that computer operators spend more hours working with computers than other computer-users. 83. 4 % of these computer operators spend more than 6 hours, working with computers at a stretch per day, very few (16. 6 %) observe breaks in-between. The study also reveals that RSIs are more prevalent among computer operators than other computer-users. Larger percentage of computer operators suffers some forms of RSI syndrome than other computer-users who rarely suffer more than one syndrome. Precautionary measures how these syndromes can be reduced are also highlighted in this study...|$|R

25|$|A {{change in}} market {{conditions}} {{also contributed to}} Borland's fall from prominence. In the 1980s, companies had few people who understood the growing personal computer phenomenon, and so most technical people were given free rein to purchase whatever software they thought they needed. Borland had done an <b>excellent</b> <b>job</b> marketing to those with a highly technical bent. By the mid-1990s, however, companies were beginning to ask what the return was on the investment they had made in this loosely controlled PC software buying spree. Company executives were starting to ask questions that were hard for technically minded staff to answer, and so corporate standards began to be created. This required new kinds of marketing and support materials from software vendors, but Borland remained focused on the technical side of its products.|$|E

25|$|Ahead of the 1983 season, Eggen {{chose to}} {{prioritize}} his teaching job, and Tommy Cavanagh {{was hired as}} manager. In Norwegian, the terms coach and manager are used interchangeably.

He believed in breaking down the players and then building them up, and was unarguably good at the former. By the summer, his style was costing the club players: Eggen transferred to Orkanger in the Fourth Division, while Husby transferred to Brøndby in Denmark. Cavanagh was fired in August, at which time the club was second-last in the league, and Eggen took over as manager {{for the rest of the}} season. The team finished on a seventh place.

40|$|The {{motivation}} {{of the current}} study was to design an algorithm that can speed up the processing of a query. The important feature is generating code dynamically for a specific query. We present the technique of code generation that is applied to query processing on a raw file. The idea was to customize a query program with a given query and generate a machine- and query-specific source code. The generated code is compiled by GCC, Clang or any other C/C++ compiler, and the compiled file is dynamically linked to the main program for further processing. Code generation reduces the cost of generalizing query processing. It also avoids the overhead of the conventional interpretation during achieve high performance. Database Management Systems (DBMSs) perform <b>excellent</b> <b>jobs</b> in many aspects of big data, such as storage, indexing, and analysis. DBMSs typically format entire data and load them into their storage layer. They increase data-to-query time, which is the cost time it takes to convert data into a specific schema and persist them in a disk. Ideally, DBMSs should adapt to the input data and extract one/some of columns, not the entire data, that is/are associated with a given query. Therefore, the query engine on a raw file can reduce the cost of conventional general operators and avoid some unnecessary procedures, such as fully scanning, tokenizing and paring the whole data. In the current study, we introduce our code-generation approach for in-situ processing of raw files, which is based on the template approach and the hype approach. The approach minimizes the data-to-query time and achieves a high performance for query processing. There are some benefits from our work: reducing branches and instructions, unrolling loops, eliminating unnecessary data type checks and optimizing the binary code with a compiler on a local machine.
