40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel {{use of the}} {{reciprocal}} calculation procedure (RCP) to calculate workplace emergency action levels (WEALs) for accidental releases of hydrocarbon mixtures. WEALs are defined here as the concentration in air that area monitors should alarm at to pro-vide adequate warning and be sufficiently protective of health to allow at least enough time to don respiratory protective equipment (RPE) and escape. The rationale for the approach is an-alysed, and ways of defining suitable substance group guidance values (GVs) for input into the RCP are considered and compared. WEAL GVs could be based on: 33 RCP GVs (i. e. using the 33 rule), the 53 RCPGVs (i. e. using the 53 rule for calculating ceiling values), <b>emergency</b> <b>exposure</b> limits, or immediately dangerous to life or health values (IDLHs). Of these, the method of choice is to base WEAL GVs on health-based IDLH values, which were developed for emergency situations in the workplace. However, IDLHs have only been set for 11 hydro-carbons, so the choice of GVs is also informed by comparison with possible GVs based on the other approaches. Using the proposed GVs, WEALs were calculated for various hydrocarbon mixtures, {{and the way they}} vary with the composition of the mixture was examined. Also, the level of health pro...|$|E

Current work in this area within ICRP Task Group (TG) 105 is highlighted. For example, how simplified numeric criteria may be used in planned exposure situations that are protective of both the public and non-human biota.

The study was performed by exposing blood samples taken from seven healthy donors to gamma rays at dose range of 0. 1 to 4. 0 Gy, followed by culturing them for 48 - 72 hours at 37 Â°C by the standard technique. After being harvested, the chromosome spread at metaphase and MN were stained with Giemsa 2 Ì 7 s solution. The results showed that the frequency of both dicentrics and MN of samples were increased with the increase of radiation dose. Considerable increases of both cytologic damages were found in the samples exposed to higher doses (> 2 Gy). Significant differences (p> 0. 05) only found in mean frequencies of MN for all doses tested. Reconstruction of the relationship of these frequencies with doses was found to follow linear-quadratic curve lines and was consistent with that of other studies. Due to the aforementioned advantages namely the dependence of radiation dose and dose rate on the frequency of of both dicentric and MN, despite some limitations, these assays have been found to be suitable to be used as biological dosimetry.

As such {{they are the most}} likely pathway for CO 2 to return to the surface in large quantities and present a hazard without adequate management. We surveyed oil industry experience of CO 2 well failures, and separately, calculated the maximal CO 2 flow rate from a 5000 Â ft depth supercritical CO 2 reservoir. The calculated maximum of 20, 000 tonne/day was set by the sound speed and the seven-inch well casing diameter, and was greater than any observed event. We used this flux to simulate atmospheric releases and the associated hazard utilizing the National Atmospheric Release Advisory Center (NARAC) tools and real meteorology at a representative location in the High Plains of the United States. Three cases representing a maximum hazard day (quiet winds < 1 Â mÂ sâ 1 near the wellhead) and medium and minimal hazard days (average winds 3 Â mÂ sâ 1 and 7 Â mÂ sâ 1) were assessed.

In all three cases the hazardous Temporary <b>Emergency</b> <b>Exposure</b> Levels (TEEL) 2 or 3 only occurred within the first few hundreds of meters. Because the preliminary 3 -D model runs may not have been run at high enough resolution to accurately simulate very small distances, we also used a simple Gaussian plume model to provide an upper bound on the distance at which hazardous conditions might exist.

New international requirements were issued by the IAEA in 2015 taking into account lessons learned from the accident at the NPP Fukushima Daiichi in Japan on 11 March 2011. The IAEA pays particular attention to the development of safety infrastructure in Member States embarking on a nuclear power programme. In the framework of the national projects of technical cooperation, the IAEA is actively implementing international safety requirements released in the IAEA Safety Standards. Following the IAEA safety standards for these States became mandatory. The key issue of the requirements is a demand to Member State to have a public protection strategy in place before the commissioning the first NPP. The strategy shall be based on the Generic criteria to be used in emergency preparedness and response to protect the people in <b>emergency</b> <b>exposure</b> situation -to prevent severe deterministic effects, and-to limit the risk of stochastic health effects on the reasonably achievable level. The strategy shall include 1. Classification of facilities and areas according to the degree of potential radiological hazard. 2.

40|$|Advantageous and/or {{detrimental}} influences {{associated with}} purposeful deviations from atmospheric levels of O 2 and CO 2 are studied. Specific goals have been directed to simulating situations of <b>emergency</b> or accidental <b>exposure</b> to hypoxic (10 % O 2) environments. They included establishing dynamic effects of hypoxia {{with and without}} CO 2 (rate of acute adaptation), and stable-state (equilibrium) effects on blood and brain oxygenation. They also included effects on the physiological parameters of respiration and blood gas composition which underlie brain oxygenation. For 10 % O 2, a complete experiment consisted of three identical rest-exercise phases of 32 minutes duration. Following a five minute air control period, each inspired gas was administered over the next 27 minutes. The test gases were room air control, 10 % +/- 0. 1 % O 2 with 4 % +/- 0. 1 % CO 2, and 10 % +/- 0. 1 % O 2. A minimum of 45 minutes separated each phase. Relative to inspiration of 10 % O 2, brain oxygenation is enhanced by addition of 4 % CO 2. This is accomplished by increasing {{the rate at which}} O 2 in arterial blood is supplied to the brain circulation (well above even the normoxic level), and on relative improvement in the arterial pressure of O 2...|$|R
