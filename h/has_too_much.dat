25|$|The problem—which also {{exists in}} the State Senate—can be boiled down to a single {{overarching}} issue: The Assembly speaker <b>has</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> power. He controls everything, from the legislation that can be voted on to how his normally docile members vote on it. He decides what the Assembly will accept in a state budget. He negotiates secretly {{with the other two}} leaders to hammer out important, expensive and far-reaching laws. And he ignores the wishes of less-exalted lawmakers.|$|E

An angry ranger takes the hobbits into another room, warning them they are drawing {{too much attention to}} themselves. He introduces himself as Strider (Daran Norris) and asks if he may join them on their journey. At this point, the innkeeper, Barliman Butterbur (Daran Norris), arrives with a letter from Gandalf which informs Frodo that Strider is really Aragorn, a trusted friend. Attracted by Frodo's accidental use of the Ring, the Nazgûl come to Bree, but Aragorn successfully hides the hobbits.|$|E

The Duchess's Cook is throwing dishes and making a soup that <b>has</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> pepper, which causes Alice, the Duchess, and her baby (but not the cook or grinning Cheshire Cat) to sneeze violently. Alice is given the baby by the Duchess and to her surprise, the baby turns into a pig. The Cheshire Cat appears in a tree, directing her to the March Hare's house. He disappears, but his grin remains behind to float on its own in the air, prompting Alice to remark that she has often seen a cat without a grin but never a grin without a cat.|$|E
25|$|While the {{rudimentary}} {{method of}} testing pH is to expose the grape juice to a pH indicator such as the strips used for a standard litmus test, the results are usually not as detailed and accurate as {{what is needed to}} evaluate ripeness. Therefore, most wineries will us a pH meter that can give readings to an accuracy of plus or minus 0.1. As with sugars and acids, the ideal pH levels to determine ripeness will vary. For white wines, winemakers often look for pH readings between 3.1 and 3.2, while would be a maximum of 3.4. If the pH is too high, it may be a sign that the grapes are overripe (or that the soil <b>has</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> potassium which will also influence pH readings). While there are risks to letting the pH go too high, winemakers can counter high pH by adding more tartaric or malic acid during the winemaking. However many viticulturists and winemakers uses pH readings as a strong boundary line for when to start the harvest.|$|E

Finally, she returns home, only to find Homer tied up, Lisa's arms and legs stuck to the wall, Maggie stuck in a cage, and Becky holding a knife in her hands. When Becky is about to 'kill' Homer, Marge snatches the knife from her and attempts to strangle her. It turns out that Bart is filming a scene in his movie for the school (now a music video). Homer also reveals that while he was fixing Marge's car, he accidentally drained the brake fluid. Marge apologizes to Becky, but Becky admits she was going to kill Marge and steal her family, but decided not to after she couldn't get a shovel. Suddenly the mental hospital doctors show up and shoot three tranquilizer darts into Marge's neck, which don't take effect. Marge tells them that she <b>has</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> to do to take a nap. She instructs Lisa to take Maggie out of the cage and tells Homer that she has some 'S for him' - scrubbing and mopping, since he is dressed for the job anyway. As Marge giggles, Homer fires a dart borrowed from the doctors into her, which sends her straight to sleep.|$|E
25|$|Monica Charles Brooks-Dent (played by Keesha Sharp) is William's wife. All {{four of the}} girlfriends (especially Lynn and Toni) {{hated her}} (Joan comes to see her {{vulnerable}} side and becomes her friend, and Toni moves to New York {{at the end of}} the sixth season). In the seventh season, they slowly and later fully accept Monica as their friend as Monica does the same. Although engaged to William, the two date twice before; they meet at a bar the first time. Since the last time William proposes to her in Monaco, he has occasionally had doubts about ever doing so. Eventually he marries her, but on their wedding day he <b>has</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> to drink and confesses that he has had and still has doubts about marrying her. Monica leaves William in Season 7 but returns shortly after the girlfriends go to Chicago to persuade her to get back together with William. On their visit, they discover that Monica, due to her father's dementia and her mother's power of attorney, has been cut off from her family fortune, so Joan offers Monica a job at the J-Spot. William is thrilled about Monica's return until she demands half of what he earned while they were married. They manage to slowly rebuild their relationship but constantly clash at the J-Spot. In the Season 7 finale, they get back together. By Season 8, Monica was pregnant and is seen spending more time with the other three girlfriends, particularly Joan.|$|E

The fourth reviewer, Hope Chapman, expressed absolute disdain towards the series.

2500|$|Hedge funds {{share many}} of the same types of risk as other {{investment}} classes, including liquidity risk and manager risk. Liquidity refers to the degree to which an asset can be bought and sold or converted to cash; similar to private equity funds, hedge funds employ a lock-up period during which an investor cannot remove money. Manager risk refers to those risks which arise from the management of funds. As well as specific risks such as style drift, which refers to a fund manager [...] "drifting" [...] away from an area of specific expertise, manager risk factors include valuation risk, capacity risk, concentration risk and leverage risk. Valuation risk refers to the concern that the net asset value of investments may be inaccurate; capacity risk can arise from placing too much money into one particular strategy, which may lead to fund performance deterioration; and concentration risk may arise if a fund <b>has</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> exposure to a particular investment, sector, trading strategy, or group of correlated funds. These risks may be managed through defined controls over conflict of interest, restrictions on allocation of funds, and set exposure limits for strategies.|$|E
2500|$|In 1926, {{there was}} much debate about race and intelligence. Mead felt the methodologies {{involved}} in the experimental psychology research supporting arguments of racial superiority in intelligence were substantially flawed. In [...] "The Methodology of Racial Testing: Its Significance for Sociology" [...] Mead proposes {{that there are three}} problems with testing for racial differences in intelligence. First, there are concerns with the ability to validly equate one’s test score with what Mead refers to as racial admixture or how much Negro or Indian blood an individual possesses. She also considers whether this information is relevant when interpreting IQ scores. Mead remarks that a genealogical method could be considered valid if it could be “subjected to extensive verification”. In addition, the experiment would need a steady control group to establish whether racial admixture was actually affecting intelligence scores. Next, Mead argues {{that it is difficult to}} measure the effect that social status has on the results of a person’s intelligence test. By this she meant that [...] environment (i.e., family structure, socioeconomic status, exposure to language) <b>has</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> influence on an individual to attribute inferior scores solely to a physical characteristic such as race. Lastly, Mead adds that language barriers sometimes create the biggest problem of all. Similarly, Stephen J. Gould finds three main problems with intelligence testing, in his book The Mismeasure of Man that relate to Mead's view of the problem of determining whether there are indeed racial differences in intelligence.|$|E
