5|$|Following the Act of 1819, in 1820 the Court {{began to}} {{distinguish}} Palmer. In United States v. Klintock (1820), the Court distinguished Palmerin {{a case involving}} piracy by a U.S. citizen, claiming to act {{under the authority of}} the Mexican Republic, committed against a Danish ship and citizens, under the <b>fraudulent</b> <b>claim</b> that the Danes were Spanish (Spain being at war with the Mexican Republic)on the grounds that the victims in Palmer were not subjects of a nation recognized by the United States. In United States v. Furlong (1820), sometimes referred to as United States v. Pirates, authored by Justice Johnson (a dissenter in Palmer), the Court distinguished Palmer again, primarily on the ground that the pirate vessel had no nationality (it was an American ship prior to being hijacked). United States v. Holmes (1820) distinguished Palmer on the same ground, further holding that the burden was on the defendant to prove that his vessel flew a lawful flag.|$|E
500|$|Taft {{had ordered}} {{government}} officials not {{to comment on}} the fracas. In January 1910, Pinchot forced the issue by sending a letter to Iowa Senator Dolliver alleging that but for the actions of the Forestry Service, Taft would have approved a <b>fraudulent</b> <b>claim</b> on public lands. According to Pringle, this [...] "was an utterly improper appeal from an executive subordinate to the legislative branch of the government and an unhappy president prepared to separate Pinchot from public office". Pinchot was dismissed, much to his delight, and he sailed for Europe to lay his case before Roosevelt. A congressional investigation followed, which cleared Ballinger by majority vote, but the administration was embarrassed when Glavis' attorney, Louis D. Brandeis, proved that the Wickersham report had been backdated, which Taft belatedly admitted. The Ballinger–Pinchot affair caused progressives and Roosevelt loyalists to feel that Taft had turned his back on Roosevelt's agenda.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Fraudulent</b> <b>claims</b> {{can be one}} of two types. [...] They can be {{otherwise}} legitimate claims that are exaggerated or “built up,” or they can be false claims in which the damages claimed never actually occurred. [...] Once a built up claim is identified, insurance companies usually try to negotiate the claim down to the appropriate amount. [...] Suspicious claims can also be submitted to “special investigative units”, or SIUs, for further investigation. [...] These units generally consist of experienced claims adjusters with special training in investigating <b>fraudulent</b> <b>claims.</b> [...] These investigators look for certain symptoms associated with <b>fraudulent</b> <b>claims,</b> or otherwise look for evidence of falsification of some kind. [...] This evidence can then be used to deny payment of the claims or to prosecute fraudsters if the violation is serious enough.|$|R

5000|$|Writing for a {{unanimous}} court, Justice Samuel Alito notes that, [...] "while §3729(a)(1) requires a plaintiff {{to prove that}} the defendant “presented” a false or <b>fraudulent</b> <b>claim</b> to the Government, the concept of presentment is not mentioned in §3729(a)(2)." [...] He concludes: What §3729(a)(2) demands is not proof that the defendant caused a false record or statement to be presented or submitted to the Government but that the defendant made a false record or statement for the purpose of getting “a false or <b>fraudulent</b> <b>claim</b> paid or approved by the Government.” Therefore, a subcontractor violates §3729(a)(2) if the subcontractor submits a false statement to the prime contractor intending for the statement to be used by the prime contractor to get the Government to pay its claim. If a subcontractor or another defendant makes a false statement to a private entity and does not intend the Government to rely on that false statement as a condition of payment, the statement is not made with the purpose of inducing payment of a false claim “by the Government.” Opinion of the Court, 553 U.S. 662, 671-72 (2008) ...|$|E
