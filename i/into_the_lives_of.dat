5|$|The press, the radio, and the {{television}} also contributed to these discussions by hosting meetings where students and young workers could ask questions of writers such as Goldstucker, Pavel Kohout, and Jan Prochazka and political victims such as Josef Smrkovský, Zdenek Hejzlar, and Gustav Husak.

5|$|By {{the second}} {{decade of the}} 21st century, the overall {{consensus}} supported the position {{that there was only}} a single author who was writing either {{at the end of the}} 4th century or the beginning of the 5th century, and who was interested in blending contemporary issues (political, religious and social) <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> the 3rd century emperors. Further, that the author used the fictitious elements in the work to highlight references to other published works, such as to Cicero and Ammianus Marcellinus in a complex allegorical game. Despite these conundrums, it is the only continuous account in Latin for much of its period and is thus continually being re-evaluated, since modern historians are unwilling to abandon it as a unique source of possible information, despite its obvious untrustworthiness on many levels.|$|E

Meanwhile, enterprise and trade at the North's ports influenced the birth of Manchester Liberalism, a laissez-faire free trade philosophy. Expounded by C. P. Scott and the Manchester Guardian, the movement's greatest success was the repeal of the Corn Laws, protests against which had led to the 1819 Peterloo Massacre in Manchester.|$|E
