30|$|The most {{important}} part of the Accepted Tide includes the time when the tsunami arrived and when it produced maximum water levels. For this interval, early on November 28, the Accepted Tide is anchored in two control points. The first is the last of the tides gauged before the tsunami, for which we use the fitted quadratic time and height of the low water near the midnight of November 27 – 28. The second is the securely computed <b>higher</b> <b>high</b> <b>water,</b> just discussed, that was predicted for 0637 IST on November 28.

30|$|Fitting a {{polynomial}} through fluctuations {{during the}} tsunami has smaller effects on tsunami amplitudes {{later in the}} morning of November 28.

The Accepted Tide hastening this high water slightly to 0631 IST. It is delayed until about 0705 IST in the Alternative Tide, because of curve-fitting to the positive waves between 0500 IST and 0900 IST. However, for the maximum gauged water level at 0747 IST, the detided tsunami amplitudes are similar: 2.29  m with the Alternative Tide, and 2.37  m with the Accepted Tide.|$|E

The height of this tide is evaluated along the dotted purple curve that passes through fitted quadratic times and heights of the higher high waters on November 27 and 30 (Fig.  4 b). This purple curve has a gentle slope because it passes through water levels of 2.39  m on November 27 and 2.44  m on November 30.

40|$|Estuaries, and {{the varied}} {{ecosystems}} they support, {{are affected by}} human action in many ways. One of the fundamental environmental questions pertaining to estuaries is how material is mixed into ambient waters and transported within and beyond the estuary. Characterizing transport and mixing is essential for tackling local environmental questions, such as gauging the water-quality impacts of a wastewater outfall, or how dredging may alter estuarine circulation. In many estuaries the dominant physical dispersion mechanism is shear dispersion. A fundamental and idealized approach to the scalar transport problem is undertaken, in which canonical shear dispersion regimes are augmented with a new, intermediate regime. This mode of shear dispersion, in which the longitudinal variance of the plume increase with the square of time, is {{likely to occur in}} channel-shoal basins where bathymetric transitions can create sheared velocity profiles. A key tool in the engineer's arsenal for pursuing studies of scalar transport is the numerical model, but care must be taken to separate physical mixing effects from numerical artifacts. Unstructured models are particularly well-suited to estuarine problems as the grid can be adapted to complex local topography, but the numerical errors of these models can be difficult to characterize with standard methods. An in-depth error analysis reveals a strong dependence of numerical diffusion on the orientation of the grid relative to the flow. Flexible grid generation methods allow for optimizing the grid in light of this dependence, and can decrease across-flow numerical diffusion by a factor of two. The most far-reaching impact of our actions, though, must certainly be global climate change. A period of rising sea level is being ushered in by climate change, and the final research-oriented chapter seeks to further our understanding of how rising sea levels will affect basin-scale tidal dynamics. Numerical and analytic approaches show that as basins get deeper tidal amplification becomes more effective and tidal range increases. The crux of the analysis, though, is the inclusion of inundation within these scenarios. Inundated areas dissipate incident tidal energy, countering the added amplification due to basins becoming deeper. The net effect, in the case of San Francisco Bay, is that tidal amplification under sea level rise actually decreases, such that a particular rise in mean <b>higher</b> <b>high</b> <b>water</b> in thecoastal ocean is predicted to raise mean <b>higher</b> <b>high</b> <b>water</b> within the bay by a lesser amount...|$|E

Using fund level data from 1994 to 2011 from a major hedge fund data vendor, we identify 1, 230 hedge funds as having significant exposure to the direct and securitized real estate market.

Additionally, hedge funds that have significant exposure to real estate are predominantly classified as fund of hedge funds implying a diversification strategy through real estate investments.
