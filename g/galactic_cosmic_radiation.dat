This methodology does not replicate the multi-ion species and energies found in the space radiation environment, nor does it reflect the low dose rate found in interplanetary space. In radiation biology studies, {{as well as in the}} assessment of health risk to astronaut crews, the differences in the biological effectiveness of different ions is primarily attributed to differences in the linear energy transfer of the radiation spectrum. Here we show that the linear energy transfer spectrum of the intravehicular environment of, e. g., spaceflight vehicles can be accurately generated experimentally by perturbing the intrinsic properties of hydrogen-rich crystalline materials in order to instigate specific nuclear spallation and fragmentation processes when placed in an accelerated mono-energetic heavy ion beam. Modifications to the internal geometry and chemical composition of the materials allow for the shaping of the emerging field to specific spectra that closely resemble the intravehicular field. Our approach can also be utilized to emulate the external <b>galactic</b> <b>cosmic</b> ray field, the planetary surface spectrum (e. g., Mars), and the local radiation environment of orbiting satellites.

40|$|Telomeres are {{nucleoprotein}} complexes {{comprised of}} tandem arrays of repetitive DNA sequence that serve to protect chromosomal termini from inappropriate degradation, {{as well as}} to prevent these natural DNA ends from being recognized as broken DNA (double-strand breaks; DSBs) and triggering of inappropriate DNA damage responses. Preservation of telomere length requires telomerase, the specialized reverse transcriptase capable of maintaining telomere length via template-mediated addition of telomeric repeats onto the ends of newly synthesized chromosomes. Loss of either end-capping function or telomere length maintenance has been associated with genomic instability or senescence in a variety of settings; therefore telomeres and telomerase have well-established connections to cancer and aging. It has long been recognized that oxidative stress promotes shortening of telomeres, and that telomerase activity is a radiation-inducible function. However, the effects of ionizing radiation (IR) exposure on telomeres per se are much less well understood and appreciated. To gain {{a deeper understanding of the}} roles telomeres and telomerase play in the response of human cells to ionizing radiations of different qualities, we tracked changes in telomeric end-capping function, telomere length, and telomerase activity in panels of mammary epithelial and hematopoietic cell lines exposed to low linear energy transfer (LET) gamma(γ) -rays or high LET high charge, high energy (HZE) particles, delivered either acutely or at low dose rates (LDR). In addition to demonstrating that dysfunctional telomeres contribute to IR-induced mutation frequencies and genome instability, we reveal non-canonical roles for telomerase, in that telomerase activity was required for IR-induced enrichment of mammary epithelial putative stem/progenitor cell populations, a finding also suggestive of cellular reprogramming. Taken together, the results reported here establish the critical importance of telomeres and telomerase in the radiation response and as such, have compelling implications not only for accelerated tumor repopulation following radiation therapy, but for carcinogenic potential following low dose exposures as well, including those of relevance to spaceflight-associated <b>galactic</b> <b>cosmic</b> <b>radiations...</b>|$|R

The Moon is also witness to more than 4. 5 Ga of Solar System history {{and is the only}} planetary body other than Earth for which we have collected samples from known locations. Moreover, the lunar surface preserves a record of the cratering rate and the evolution of solar and <b>galactic</b> <b>cosmic</b> <b>radiations</b> throughout the history of the Solar System. Understanding the Moon is key to understanding both Earth and our Solar System. Consequently, the Moon has been the prime target in Solar System exploration programmes, before the pursuit of more distant targets such as Mars and beyond. Our knowledge about the Moon is based on telescopic observations from Earth, observations by spacecraft from the lunar orbit, measurements on the lunar surface by manned and unmanned landed missions and the analyses of lunar samples in terrestrial laboratories. The knowledge gained from Apollo and Luna programmes of 1960 ’s and subsequent lunar missions, carried out over the last 4 decades, continue to demonstrate the value of the Moon for the understanding of our Solar System and the fundamental processes that drive planetary formation and evolution. Because of its restricted geological activity and relatively simple composition compared with the Earth the Moon provides insights into elementary planetary processes affecting all planetary bodies. Compared to the Earth, the Moon is depleted in both volatile elements and iron and other siderophile elements. Recently, however, the presence of H 2 O and OH has been confirmed on the lunar surface as well as in lunar samples. While it has long been suspected that water-ice might be preserved in cold traps at the lunar poles, recent results indicate the presence of OH and H 2 O outside of these regions. This new discovery makes the Moon again an extremely interesting target, both scientifically and as a potential resource.

40|$|Cosmic rays were {{discovered}} in 1911 by the Austrian physicist, Victor Hess. The planet earth is continuously bathed in high-energy <b>galactic</b> <b>cosmic</b> ionizing <b>radiation</b> (GCR), emanating from outside the solar system, and sporadically exposed to bursts of energetic particles from the sun referred to as solar particle events (SPEs). The main source of GCR {{is believed to be}} supernovae (exploding stars), while occasionally a disturbance in the sun's atmosphere (solar flare or coronal mass ejection) leads to a surge of radiation particles with sufficient energy to penetrate the earth's magnetic field and enter the atmosphere. The inhabitants of planet earth gain protection from the effects of <b>cosmic</b> <b>radiation</b> from the earth s magnetic field and the atmosphere, {{as well as from the}} sun's magnetic field and solar wind. These protective effects extend to the occupants of aircraft flying within the earth s atmosphere, although the effects can be complex for aircraft flying at high altitudes and high latitudes. Travellers in space do not have the benefit of this protection and are exposed to an ionizing radiation field very different in magnitude and quality from the exposure of individuals flying in commercial airliners. The higher amounts and distinct types of radiation qualities in space lead to a large need for understanding the biological effects of space radiation. It is recognized that although there are many overlaps between the aviation and the space environments, there are large differences in radiation dosimetry, risks and protection for airline crew members, passengers and astronauts. These differences impact the application of radiation protection principles of risk justification, limitation, and the principle of as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA). This chapter accordingly is divided into three major sections, the first dealing with the basic physics and health risks, the second with the commercial airline experience, and the third with the aspects of <b>cosmic</b> <b>radiation</b> appertaining to space travel including future considerations...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The Cosmic Ray Telescope for the Effects of Radiation (CRaTER), an {{instrument}} {{carried on the}} Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft, directly measures the energy depositions by solar and <b>galactic</b> <b>cosmic</b> <b>radiations</b> in its silicon wafer detectors. These energy depositions are converted to linear energy transfer (LET) spectra. High LET particles, which are mainly high-energy heavy ions found in the incident cosmic ray spectrum, or target fragments and recoils produced by protons and heavier ions, are of particular importance because of their potential to cause significant damage to human tissue and electronic components. Aside from providing LET data useful for space radiation risk analyses for lunar missions, the observed LET spectra {{can also be used}} to help validate space radiation transport codes, used for shielding design and risk assessment applications, which is a major thrust of this work. In this work the Monte Carlo transport code HETC-HEDS (High-Energy Transport Code-Human Exploration and Development in Space) is used to estimate LET contributions from the incident primary ions and their charged secondaries produced by nuclear collisions as they pass through the three pairs of silicon detectors. Also in this work, the contributions to the LET of the primary ions and their charged secondaries are analyzed and compared with estimates obtained using the deterministic space radiation code HZETRN 2010, developed at NASA Langley Research Center. LET estimates obtained from the two transport codes are compared with measurements of LET from the CRaTER instrument during the mission. Overall, a comparison of the LET predictions of the HETC-HEDS code to the predictions of the HZETRN code displays good agreement. The code predictions are also in good agreement with the CRaTER LET measurements above 15 -keV/μm but differ from the measurements for smaller values of LET. A possible reason for this disagreement between measured and calculated spectra below 15 -keV/μm is an inadequate representation of the light ion spectra in HETC-HEDS and HZETRN code calculations. It is also clear from the results of this work that Vavilov distributions need to be incorporated into the HETC-HJEDS code before it will be able to recreate the observed LET spectra measured by the CRaTER instrument. Key Points Vavilov corrections should be incorporated into simulated results The predictions of the transport codes reasonably agree with the CRaTER LET The observed LET can be used to help validate space radiation transport codes...|$|R

The total dose rate from iron ions is found to be 1. 57 Gy=d and dose equivalent is found to be 17 Sv=d.
