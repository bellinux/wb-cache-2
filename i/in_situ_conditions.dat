50|$|Accumulation of {{chemicals}} by a POCIS device generally follows first order kinetics.

During the integrative phase of uptake, a passive sampling device accumulates residues linearly relative to time, assuming constant exposure concentrations.

Therefore, both laboratory and field data justify {{the use of a}} linear uptake model for the calculation of sample rates.

40|$|Abstract The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} in vitro and <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> the effects of two bleaching treatments on human enamel surface microhardness. Sixty enamel slabs from recently extracted thirty molars were used. The specimens were polished with sandpapers under water-cooling. The enamel samples were randomly divided in four groups, treated with 10 % hydrogen peroxide (HP) or Whitening Strips (WS) containing 10 % hydrogen peroxide and using two conditions: in vitro or <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> model. For <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> <b>condition,</b> six volunteers wore an intra-oral appliance containing enamel slabs, while for in vitro condition the specimens were kept in deionized water after the bleaching protocols. The bleaching treatments were applied one-hour daily for 14 days. Similar amounts of bleaching agents were used in both conditions. Before and after bleaching treatments, microhardness was measured. Statistical analysis (ANOVA and Tukey test) showed that <b>in</b> the <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> <b>condition</b> there was no statistically significant microhardness reduction in the bleached enamel (p> 0. 05). Significant decrease in hardness was observed for enamel slabs bleached with both treatments in the in vitro condition (p< 0. 05). Regarding the bleaching agents, <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> results showed no difference between HP and WS, while in vitro WS produced the lowest hardness value.

30|$|For the systematical {{underestimation}} of calculated temperatures discerned in “Multicomponent geothermometry” section, {{a number}} of processes or parameters are worth considering. Anticipated processes are the dilution with superficial water during ascent of fluids, the deviation of measured pH from in situ pH (due to degassing and {{as a function of}} temperature), as well as the uncertainties of aluminum concentrations (due to precipitations, sampling, sample storage and measurement errors).
