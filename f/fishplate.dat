25|$|Jointed rails {{were used}} {{at first because}} {{contemporary}} technology did not offer any alternative. However, the intrinsic weakness in resisting vertical loading results in the ballast becoming depressed and a heavy maintenance workload is imposed to prevent unacceptable geometrical defects at the joints. The joints also needed to be lubricated, and wear at the <b>fishplate</b> (joint bar) mating surfaces needed to be rectified by shimming. For this reason jointed track is not financially appropriate for heavily operated railroads.|$|E
25|$|Through {{the use of}} low wing- and span-loading to {{generate}} greater effectiveness than conventional counterparts, the Islander could lift considerably heavier payloads than the typical aircraft in its power, weight or cost classes. To reduce manufacturing costs, both the wings and tail surfaces maintain a constant chord and thickness, while the ribs within the aircraft's wing are all identical; both rivets and external <b>fishplate</b> joints are used for the same purpose. The type was originally intended to use a fabric-and-steel design. A light alloy monocoque approach was adopted instead. The structure is designed to give rise to and experience low levels of stress, and has an infinite fatigue life without testing.|$|E
25|$|The {{track laying}} was divided up into various parts. In {{advance of the}} track layers, {{surveyors}} consulting with engineers determined where the track would go. Workers then built and prepared the roadbed, dug or blasted through hills, filled in washes, built trestles, bridges or culverts across streams or valleys, made tunnels if needed, and laid the ties. The actual track-laying gang would then lay rails on the previously laid ties positioned on the roadbed, drive the spikes, and bolt the <b>fishplate</b> bars to each rail. At the same time, another gang would distribute telegraph poles and wire along the grade, while the cooks prepared dinner and the clerks busied themselves with accounts, records, using the telegraph line to relay requests for more materials and supplies or communicate with supervisors. Usually the workers lived in camps built near their work site. Supplies were ordered by the engineers and hauled by rail, possibly then to be loaded on wagons if they were needed ahead of the railhead. Camps were moved when the railhead moved a significant distance. Later, as the railroad started moving long distances every few days, some railroad cars had bunkhouses built in them that moved with the workers—the Union Pacific had used this technique since 1866. Almost all of the roadbed work {{had to be done}} manually, using shovels, picks, axes, two-wheeled dump carts, wheelbarrows, ropes, scrapers, etc., with initially only black powder available for blasting. Carts pulled by mules, and horses were about the only labor saving devices available then. Lumber and ties were usually provided by independent contractors who cut, hauled and sawed the timber as required.|$|E

60|$|The huts {{of the mud}} village were {{crumbling}} {{back into}} the desert sand. The old British fort {{and a number of}} storehouses--relics of the Gordon Relief Expedition--were in ruins. The railway from Sarras had been pulled to pieces. Most of the sleepers had disappeared, but the rails lay scattered along the track. All was deserted: yet one grim object proclaimed the Dervish occupation. Beyond the old station and near the river a single rail had been fixed nearly upright in the ground. From one of the holes for the <b>fishplate</b> bolts there dangled a rotten cord, and on the sand beneath this improvised yet apparently effective gallows lay a human skull and bones, quite white and beautifully polished by the action of sun and wind. Half-a-dozen friendly Arabs, who had taken refuge on the island below the cataract, were the only inhabitants of the district.|$|E

50|$|In rail terminology, a <b>fishplate,</b> {{splice bar}} or joint bar is a metal bar that is {{bolted to the}} ends of two rails to join them {{together}} in a track. The name is derived from fish, a wooden bar with a curved profile used to strengthen a ship's mast. The top and bottom edges are tapered inwards so the device wedges itself between {{the top and bottom of}} the rail when it is bolted into place. In rail transport modelling, a <b>fishplate</b> is often a small copper or nickel silver plate that slips onto both rails to provide the functions of maintaining alignment and electrical continuity.|$|E
50|$|In October 2016, {{extensive}} {{sections of}} the track are in poor condition, even unsafe. Sleepers are rotten in parts, <b>fishplates</b> unbolted, pointwork derelict, some rails have sunk some 8 cms below the road surface, overhead voltage supply is poorly regulated. Speeds are low.|$|R
50|$|The keyed hook scarf {{is common}} in ship and boat-building, as well as timber framing and wooden bridge construction. In large timbers such as these the scarf is {{virtually}} always secured with through bolts, and is frequently reinforced externally with iron or steel <b>fishplates,</b> and/or strapping.|$|R
50|$|The wooden {{main frame}} is {{strengthened}} by tapering steel <b>fishplates</b> along the inner {{faces of the}} longitudinal members. One of the transverse-members supports the change speed lever. From these transverse members an underframe is suspended and it supports the engine at a level below the main frame.|$|R

50|$|The {{prosecution}} admitted {{a number}} of exhibits during the trial, including a box of 27 bricks, a blood-stained stone, Bulger's underpants, and the rusty iron bar described as a railway <b>fishplate.</b> The pathologist spent 33 minutes outlining the injuries sustained by Bulger; many of those to his legs had been inflicted after he was stripped from the waist down. Brain damage was extensive and included a haemorrhage.|$|E

50|$|In May 1925 a train, {{passing through}} the Corridor {{on its way to}} East Prussia, crashed because the spikes had been removed from the tracks for a short {{distance}} and the <b>fishplates</b> unbolted. 25 persons, including 12 women and 2 children, were killed, some 30 others were injured.|$|R
50|$|The moving {{blades of}} a set of points can be {{connected}} to the stock rails by looser than normal <b>fishplates.</b> This is called a heeled switch. Alternatively, the blade and stock rail can be a one piece heel-less switch, with a flexible thinned section to create the moving heel.|$|R

50|$|Even though {{fishplates}} {{strengthen the}} weak points represented by rail joints, improvements {{can still be}} made. For example, the joints can be welded together using the thermite welding process. In 1967, at Hither Green on the Southern Region of British Railways, a major disaster occurred when a rail fractured at its <b>fishplate</b> joint. Welded Rail installation was sped up due to this error, with strict procedures on concrete and wooden Sleepers.|$|E

5000|$|On 12 July 2013, {{the last}} four cars of an SNCF Paris-Limoges train left the track while {{entering}} the Brétigny-sur-Orge station, killing seven people and injuring 32. The French land transport accident investigation bureau BEA-TT concluded in an interim report published on 10 January 2014 that [...] "the derailment {{was caused by a}} <b>fishplate</b> obstructing the flangeway of an oblique crossing forming part of a double slip. Under the weight of the train travelling at 137 km/h, the <b>fishplate</b> had pivoted around the first of four bolts meant to hold it in place, the three others having come loose. The most likely cause of the bolts coming loose, says BEA-TT, were stresses caused by cracking in the cast steel crossing. This had caused the head of the third bolt to break off and the others to fail, one becoming unscrewed and the heads of the other two also shearing off." [...] Recommendations included improving agency expertise in bolted track joints, clarification and reinforcement of regulations for defect detection and repair, and identification of switches and crossings where higher levels of maintenance and early renewal should be implemented.|$|E
50|$|When railway {{lines are}} {{equipped}} with track circuits, or where the line is electrified for electric traction, the electrical connection provided by <b>fishplates</b> is poor and unreliable {{and has to be}} supplemented by bonding wire fixed to the two rails either side of the joint by spot welding or other means.|$|R
50|$|From the {{evidence}} available, the rail was secured using dog spikes to wooden sleepers {{of a small}} but long profile, although none survive to this day so {{it is difficult to}} say exactly. The Society still possesses three original 1945 metal sleepers, and a small quantity of 14lb rail, with one pair of <b>fishplates.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Fatuha train {{crash was}} a rail {{transport}} accident that occurred on 4 April 1998, in India. Removal of <b>fishplates</b> {{led to the}} packed Howrah-Danapur Express jumping tracks, killing at least 11 passengers and injuring more than 50 others near Fatuha Station in Fatuha city on the Eastern Railway's Danapur division. In all, nine bogies derailed disrupting traffic.|$|R
