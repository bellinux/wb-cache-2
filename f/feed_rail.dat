5|$|Other than {{establishing}} new rail corridors, GO Transit {{introduced the}} Bi-Level coaches in 1979, {{in order to}} increase the number of passengers carried per train. These unique rail cars were developed in partnership with Bombardier Transportation. In that same year, the current GO concourse at Union Station was built to accommodate these additional passengers. GO Bus service also started on September 8, 1970, extending the original Lakeshore line to Hamilton and Oshawa, as well as providing service north to Newmarket and Barrie. It eventually became a full-fledged network in its own right after 1989, <b>feeding</b> <b>rail</b> service and serving communities beyond the reach of existing trains.|$|R

In 1989, GO started running buses between outer train stations and Union at off-peak times when trains were not scheduled. The bus network started expanding beyond train lines, <b>feeding</b> <b>rail</b> service and serving communities beyond the reach of existing trains. In 2000, GO Transit went beyond its existing train corridors and began service along Highway 407, linking York University to Oshawa, Mississauga and Oakville.|$|R
40|$|In {{the process}} towards {{understanding}} plant root foraging behaviour, much {{focus has been}} on root proliferation responses to nutrient availability and on using animal foraging theories such as the marginal value theorem to understand plant root foraging behaviour. A common problem is the lack of generality of these theories and variation is often explained by life history. The geometric framework was developed as a general animal foraging concept and has been tested on a variety of organisms such as locusts and slime mould. I adapted this framework by replacing the carbohydrate and protein axes with nitrogen and phosphorus. I used Poa annua as the model species for the first test on a plant, and I defined the intake target by applying nitrogen and phosphorus at 6 different concentrations and measuring nutrient intake levels. I hypothesised that the plants would defend an optimal intake target and I was able to define the intake target from the data. However, the results showed that there was a phosphorus limitation to reach this target and I found that the plants tend to defend an optimal intake ratio for suboptimal nutrient availability within the boundaries of regulative ability. This provided the optimal nutrient intake ratio which defines the optimal <b>feeding</b> <b>rail.</b> This rail separates the zones in the fitness landscape that determine which nutrient the plant should take up exclusively to reach the optimal <b>feeding</b> <b>rail.</b> I tested the hypothesis of exclusive feeding and the plant’s ability for nutrient self selection with two split root experiments, one to measure root biomass and another to measure carbon allocation using 11 C. I found a stronger ability for the plant to regulate phosphorus intake than to regulate nitrogen intake and the labelled carbon experiment showed a direct foraging response of a nitrogen starved plant when provided with a high nitrogen patch. The geometric framework is an invaluable tool for plant research with respect to nutrient cycling and behaviour, and nutrient uptake and regulation mechanisms need to be considered for developing a general plant foraging concept...|$|R

50|$|The weapon feeds {{from the}} left side from open-link, metal {{ammunition}} belts: either the American disintegrating M13 belt (NATO standard) or the segmented German DM1 belt, whose 50-round sections can be linked through a cartridge. In order to adapt the weapon to feed from one belt type to the other, several components of the feed mechanism need to be reconfigured since the position of the feed tray's cartridge stop and pawl angles in the top cover are different. The MAG features a pawl-type feeding mechanism that continues to move the feed link during both the rearward and forward cycles of the reciprocating bolt carrier, producing a smooth belt flow. The feeding mechanism's three pawls are actuated by a roller connected to the bolt carrier. The <b>feed</b> channel <b>rail,</b> <b>feed</b> link, both feed slides and the feed tray are chrome plated. The top cover body is an anodized aluminum casting.

40|$|International audienceWhen modern light-rail {{technology}} {{does have}} a sound economic role in urban transport, how should its deployment be organized? In particular, what role might there be for private enterprise? In many countries, a city coordinates its light-rail and bus services: buses <b>feed</b> light <b>rail</b> rather than run in parallel; travel passes are valid on all modes. In contrast, light rail in England may experience onstreet competition because deregulation has removed restrictions on bus entry. In many cases, light rail is established not only to provide basic public transport but also (1) to provide high-quality service that attracts use by car-owners, (2) to reduce pollution from buses and (3) to facilitate changes to urban form. In that context, competition may be both impracticable and undesirable. In cases where these three aims matter little, on-street competition may be beneficial, but light rail may not be worthwhile. The paper identifies arrangements for franchising and contracting-out that respect these considerations...|$|R

50|$|Water rails are omnivorous, {{although}} they mainly feed on animals. These include leeches, worms, gastropods, small crustaceans, spiders, {{and a wide}} range of both terrestrial and aquatic insects and their larvae. Small vertebrates such as amphibians, fish, birds and mammals may be killed or eaten as carrion. Vertebrates are impaled with a strike of the bill which breaks the prey's spinal cord. Plant food, which is consumed more in autumn and winter, includes the buds, flowers, shoots and seeds of water plants, berries and fruit. In south Asia, paddy (harvested rice kernels) may sometimes be eaten. The young rails are fed mainly on insects and spiders. Food obtained on land or from mud is normally washed in water before it is eaten. After rain, rails may probe soft ground for earthworms. This species will occasionally feed in the open even when not forced to do so by cold weather; Edmund Meade-Waldo described seven <b>rails</b> <b>feeding</b> in an open meadow. Despite its skulking nature, the water rail appears to thrive in captivity when fed on animal food such as raw meat or earthworms; one individual was taught to jump for worms suspended from a fishing rod.|$|R
500|$|Canny {{investments}} and {{the purchase of}} major competitors in 1888 and 1892 {{under the direction of}} financier Hiram Bond, TCI Corporate General Superintendent, saw the firm grow rapidly. The corporation was for several decades one of the few major heavy industries based in the largely agricultural Southern United States, by a wide margin the largest blast furnace operator in the South and at one time the second largest steel producer on the continent. Its 1900 asset sheet listed 17 blast furnaces, 3256 beehive coke ovens, 120 Solvay coke ovens, 15 red ore mines, as well an extensive network of railroads, although following the panic of 1893 the company shifted its primary interests from railroads to steel. TCI's largest industrial plant was located in Ensley, a company town founded in 1886 on the outskirts of Birmingham, Alabama, by company president Enoch Ensley. Ensley (...) was served by the sizable Birmingham Southern Railroad, one of TCI's early acquisitions, and from 1899 contained four 200-ton blast furnaces. In 1906 two more furnaces were constructed, and 40,000 tonnes of steel were produced that year, <b>feeding</b> Ensley's integrated <b>rail,</b> wire and plate mills. The company was fiercely competitive with the larger Pittsburgh steel businesses to the north, owing to the remarkable fact that all the natural resources required to produce steel were located in abundance within a relatively small radius of the Birmingham mills.|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Studies on {{determinants}} of dairy farmers' exposure to dust and endotoxin have been sparse {{and so far}} none has addressed the combined effect of tasks and farm characteristics. : To study whether and how work tasks and specific stable characteristics influence the level of dairy farmers' personal exposure to inhalable dust and endotoxin. : We applied an observational design involving full-shift repeated personal measurements of inhalable dust and endotoxin exposure among 77 subjects (owners and farm workers) from 26 dairy farms. Performed tasks were self-registered in activity diaries, and information on stable characteristics was collected through personal interviews and walk-through surveys. Associations between exposure, tasks, and stable characteristics were examined in linear mixed-effect models with individual and farm treated as random effects. Separate as well as combined models for tasks and stable characteristics were elaborated. : The 124 personal samples collected had a geometric mean level (geometric standard deviation) of 360 EU m(- 3) (3. 8) for endotoxin exposure and of 1. 0 mg m(- 3) (2. 7) for dust exposure. Identified factors that increased endotoxin exposure included a lower outdoor temperature and use of slope-based or back-flushed slurry systems along with milking, distribution of bedding, and handling of feed and seeds in barns. For dust, exposure was higher when fully automatic (robotic) milking was used and during re-penning of animals, handling of feed and seeds, handling of silos and when distributing bedding. Dust exposure increased also {{as a result of}} use of <b>rail</b> <b>feed</b> dispensers in a model without fully automatic milking. : The current exposure to dust and in particular endotoxin among Danish dairy farmers demand effective strategies to reduce their exposure. The present findings suggest that future interventions should focus on feeding and manure handling systems. Use of respirators during handling of feed and distribution of bedding should be advised until adequate risk management measures have been established. The expected increased use of fully automatic milking in the future might increase dust exposure of dairy farmers...|$|R
