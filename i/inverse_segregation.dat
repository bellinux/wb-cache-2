5000|$|Although {{one of the}} {{benefits}} of spray forming is purportedly the ability to produce bulk material with fine scale microsegregation and little or no macrosegregation work on Al-Mg-Li-Cu alloys showed that as a consequence of the interconnected liquid in the billet there was significant macrosegregation in large spray formed wrought Al billets. The distribution of Cu, Mg and Li in, for example, Al alloy 8091 showed surprisingly pronounced macrosegregation with the variation of Cu(wt%) in a spray formed 8091 billet, ranging from approximately 1.4 at the billet centre to 1.92 at the billet periphery. These macrosegregation patterns were explained in terms of <b>inverse</b> <b>segregation</b> in which solute rich liquid from the billet centre is sucked back through the primary Al-rich network to feed solidification shrinkage at the billet periphery. This effect was suggested to be exacerbated by centrifugal effects from the billet rotation.|$|E

Wavelengths and amplitudes of these sinusoidal surfaces are varied to study their e#ects on processes like solidification, macrosegregation and <b>inverse</b> <b>segregation.</b> Solidification and macrosegregation are modeled using a slightly modified {{form of a}} stabilized finite element method developed recently to model high Rayleigh number solidification and porous media flows. For pure metal solidification, the e#ect of varying amplitudes and wavelengths is observed in heat transfer, fluid-flow and phase change processes. The relative importance of shrinkage driven flow and solutal convection on the redistribution of solute for an alloy solidifying in a rectangular cavity is compared. The analysis is then extended by modifying one of the surfaces to a sinusoid.

X-ray fluorescence spectrometry was used to determine the macrosegregation profiles. The measurement of microporosity was performed using pyknometry analysis. The local composition along an Al- 9 wt%Si- 3 wt%Cu casting length was used as an input parameter for simulations of microporosity evolution.

40|$|Solidification of Aluminum alloys {{is modeled}} on uneven {{surfaces}} characterized by sinusoidal curves. Wavelengths and amplitudes of these surfaces are varied {{to study the}} effect of changing surface topography on fluid flow, macrosegregation and <b>inverse</b> <b>segregation</b> in the solidifying alloy. Solidification is initiated by convective heat removal from the uneven surfaces and simulations are carried out in both vertical and horizontal configurations. Stabilized finite element methods, recently used for modeling solidification {{in the presence of}} shrinkage and buoyancy driven flows, are used to discretize and solve the governing transport equations derived by volume averaging. The effect of varying amplitudes and wavelengths is observed in heat transfer, fluid-flow, macrosegregation and <b>inverse</b> <b>segregation</b> processes. In vertical solidification, <b>inverse</b> <b>segregation,</b> that usually occurs {{at the bottom of the}} cavities, is studied for different sinusoidal topographies quantified by a particular wavelength and amplitude. The fluid flow here is driven by a combination of shrinkage and thermosolutal buoyancy. Shrinkage driven flow arises due to different densities of solid and liquid phases. During horizontal solidification of an Aluminum alloy from uneven surfaces, thermosolutal buoyancy plays a dominant role in fluid flow and the effect of shrinkage is neglected by assuming the individual phase densities to be equal. Convection in this case is much stronger than that in the vertical case and large scale redistribution of the solute element occurs. To measure variation in macrosegregation with changing surface topography, global extent of segregation and difference between maximum and minimum solute concentrations are calculated for different amplitudes and wavelengths. In both the cases, the main aim is to quantify changes in macrosegregation due to changing surface topography accomplished by varying amplitudes or wavelengths or both...|$|E
40|$|Experiments are {{described}} which confirm the previously reported <b>inverse</b> <b>segregation</b> of Sb in the Pb-Sb alloy castings. Supercooling of Sb at eutectic temperatures and a pre-ferred orientation and growth {{direction for the}} Sb crystals {{are responsible for the}} exces-sively large coverage by Sb in the surface of the cast alloy. Interdendritic flow, pre-viously claimed as a principal factor in this <b>inverse</b> <b>segregation,</b> is now found to be unnecessary. Preferred orientation with the [111]direction perpendicular to the surface and preferred irections of growth parallel to the (111) plane are shown to be caused by the strong covalent linkages within the (111) pairs of planes. This, plus a number of factors such as temperature gradient, surface tension, and Sb concentration i the surface film, favors the growth of those nuclei that originate with their (111) planes parallel to the surface.

(Astronomical Institute of the Charles University) Abstract: Young star {{clusters}} are widely discussed {{from the point}} of view of their evolution and structure. In this work we focused our attention on studying a typical representative of these objects - the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC, M 42) - based on the observational data, including their confrontation with N- body models from Šubr et al. (2012). These numerical models were inspired by the recently proposed evolutionary scenario, according to which the {{star clusters}} begin their evolution from very dense initial conditions. From the analysis of the X-ray sources we revealed that the ONC is likely to be rotationally symmetric in the inner area (� 0. 7 pc). Further analysis including also optical and IR observational data led us to the conclusion that the ONC is elongated from the North-East to the South-West on large scales (up to 2 pc). We also compared radial profiles of different mass groups of stars and we discovered a possibly <b>inverse</b> mass <b>segregation</b> between stars with masses in the interval (1; 5) M⊙ and the stars less massive than 0. 5 M⊙ in the range from 0. 5 pc to 1. 5 pc.

The soil particles experienced projection, long-distance flying, sliding, and rolling. Trajectory <b>segregation,</b> <b>inverse</b> grading, and particle crushing were found in the landslide event, which contributed to the heterogeneity of the soil deposits.

In the run-out area, the particle flow tended to cause large particles to travel further. However, particle disintegration and crushing led to more small particles along the movement paths and the observed characteristic flow distances of very large particles did not increase with the particle diameter, which is different from observations of an idealized granular mass flow...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe general aim of {{this work}} {{is to build a}} model of {{solidification}} that includes all pertinent elementary phenomena, which may contribute to the segregation in the sub-surface region of continuously cast metal. This paper presents a first attempt to take into account simultaneously: the solidification shrinkage, the thermal contraction of both the liquid and solid phases, the thermomechanical deformation of the mushy zone, and the undercooling at the growth front. Mathematical expressions of segregation rates occurring during solidification with spongy deformation of an alloyed mushy zone have been derived from classical mass balance equations. The main result is a mathematical expression for the local macrosegregation rate. This expression is combined with a numerical one-dimensional model of the heat flow previously developed for the study of directional solidification of an undercooled mushy zone using an Eulerian frame of reference. In addition to <b>inverse</b> <b>segregation</b> close to the mold, segregation induced by deformation and growth undercooling of the columnar growth front are predicted.

When <b>inverse</b> <b>segregation</b> {{takes place in}} a {{landslide}} soil deposit, the coefficient of permeability of the soil statistically decreases from the surface {{to the bottom of the}} deposit. Such material spatial variability can be characterized using non-stationary random fields. The objectives of this paper are to develop algorithms to generate non-stationary random fields for a slope with the mean coefficient of saturated permeability decreasing with depth and to carry out analysis of infiltration in an anisotropic non-stationary slope. Basic anisotropic stationary random fields with orthogonal major and minor scales of fluctuation are considered first. Non-stationary random fields are then formulated by adding a trend to the stationary random fields. The Cholesky decomposition method is applied to produce correlated random numbers following an exponential correlation structure. After generating the anisotropically heterogeneous non-stationary random fields, the steady-state pore-water pressures in each random field are obtained by solving the Richards equation.

The uneven surfaces are modelled as sinusoids with different wavelengths and amplitudes. Phenomena occurring during {{early stages of}} so-lidification {{play an important role}} in the formation of surface defects. At the mold-metal interface, formation of air-gaps leads to variations in heat flux from the solidifying shell to the mold. The heat flux is either determined from the contact pressure during perfect con-tact or through air-gap sizes during imperfect contact (air-gap nucleation). The effects of <b>inverse</b> <b>segregation,</b> arising from shrinkage driven flow in the melt, on nucleation of air-gaps and evolution of stresses in the solidifying shell are examined.

40|$|A coupled thermomechanical, thermal {{transport}} and segregation analysis of aluminum alloys solidifying on uneven surfaces is presented here. Uneven surfaces are modelled as sinusoids with different wavelengths and amplitudes. Effects of various coupling mechanisms between the solid-shell deformation, air-gap formation, heat transfer, fluid flow and segregation, near the mold-metal interface, are observed for different mold topographies {{during the early}} stages of solidification of an aluminum alloy. The role of <b>inverse</b> <b>segregation,</b> arising from shrinkage driven flow in the melt, melt superheat and varying mold surface topography on nucleation of air-gaps and evolution of stresses in the solidifying shell is examined. The numerical model consists of a volume-averaged solidification model coupled with a small-deformation model combining elasto-viscoplastic deformation in the solidifying shell with air-gap nucleation and imperfect contact at the metal/mold interface. Heat transfer at the mold-metal interface is either contact pressure or air-gap dependent and is modelled using the actual contact pressure or air-gap size obtained from the contact sub-problem at the metal-mold interface. Variation in heat transfer leads to variations in fluid flow, segregation and stresses developing in the solid and mushy-zone, which in turn affect the morphology of the growing solid-shell. A wavelength range that leads to a reduction in equivalent stresses, segregation and growth front morphology unevenness, in the evolving solid-shell, is obtained for varying solute concentrations.

The aim {{of the present study was}} to contribute to a better understanding about the relationship between the scale of the dendritic network and the corresponding mechanical properties and wear behavior. The Al-Sn (15 and 20 wt pct Sn) and Al-Si (3 and 5 wt pct Si) alloys were directionally solidified under unsteady-state heat flow conditions in water-cooled molds in order to permit samples with a wide range of dendritic spacings to be obtained.

40|$|Although Twin Roll Casting (TRC) {{process has}} been used for almost 60 years in the {{aluminum}} industry, TRC of magnesium is relatively new. In TRC, molten metal is fed onto water-cooled rolls, where it solidifies and is then rolled. Solidification of the molten metal starts at the point of first metal-roll contact and is completed before the kissing point (point of least roll separation) of the two rolls. The unique thermo-physical properties inherent to magnesium and its alloys, such as lower specific heat and latent heat of fusion and larger freezing ranges (in comparison with aluminum and steel) make it challenging for TRC of this alloy. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the process and the interaction between the casting conditions and strip final quality is imperative to guarantee high quality twin roll cast strip production. A powerful tool to achieve such knowledge is to develop a mathematical model of the process. In this thesis, a 2 D mathematical model for TRC of AZ 31 magnesium alloy has been developed and validated based on the TRC facility located at the Natural Resources Canada Government Materials Laboratory (CanmetMATERIALS) in Hamilton, ON, Canada. The validation was performed by comparing the predicted exit strip temperature and secondary dendrite arm spacing (SDAS) through the strip thickness with those measured and obtained by experiments. The model was developed in two stages, first a thermal-fluid model was developed followed by validation and then a thermal-fluid-stress model was developed. This is the first time a comprehensive thermal-fluid-stress model has been developed to simulate the TRC process for magnesium alloys. The work has led to new knowledge about the TRC process and its effects on magnesium strip quality including the following: 1) 	Using ALSIM and ANSYS® CFX® commercial packages a 2 D mathematical model of thermal-fluid-stress behavior of the magnesium sheet during TRC was successfully developed and validated. 2) 	An average value of 11 kW/m 2 °C for the Heat Transfer Coefficient (HTC) was found to best represent the heat transfer between the roll and the strip during TRC casting of AZ 31 using the CanmetMATERIALS facility. 3) 	Modeling results showed that increasing casting speed, casting thicker strips and applying higher HTCs led to less uniform microstructure through thickness in terms of SDAS. 4) 	Simulations showed the importance of casting parameters such as casting speed and set-back distance on the thermal history and stress development in the sheet during TRC; higher casting speeds led to deeper sumps and higher exit temperatures as well as lower overall rolling loads and lower total strains experienced during TRC. 5) 	The effect of roll diameter on the thermal history and stress development in the strip was also studied and indicated how larger roll diameters increased the surface normal stress and rolling loads but had little effect on the mushy zone thickness. 6) 	The correlation between the mechanisms of center-line and <b>inverse</b> <b>segregation</b> formation and thermo-mechanical behavior of the strip was performed. The modeling results suggested that increasing the set-back distance decreases the risk of both defects.
