5|$|Entertainment can be {{distinguished}} from other activities such as education and marketing <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> learned {{how to use the}} appeal of entertainment to achieve their different goals. The importance and impact of entertainment is recognised by scholars and its increasing sophistication has influenced practices in other fields such as museology.|$|E
5|$|Jon Snow, Sam {{and their}} party {{return to the}} Wall after finding two frozen corpses. Lord Commander Mormont recognizes them as Benjen Stark's fellow rangers and orders their bodies examined. Sam points {{out that there is}} no sign of decay on their corpses, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> {{apparently}} been dead for weeks. Later, Mormont informs Jon about events in the south and warns him to keep his commitment to the Night's Watch. Jon loses his temper after Ser Alliser Thorne mocks Eddard Stark's treason. Enraged, Jon charges at Thorne with a knife but is held back by his companions and confined to his quarters by Mormont.|$|E
5|$|There are {{variations}} on the potbelly theme including complete potbelly sculptures, headless potbellies, {{some of which may}} be deliberately headless, and potbelly sculptures that consist of only a bodiless head that are recognised as belonging to the style <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> no potbelly body. Some potbelly sculptures are wearing collars or clothing while others are apparently naked. There are examples with very prominent navels while other sculptures have no emphasis on the navel at all. Some examples of potbelly sculpture have chest ornaments and some sculptures are seated on pedestals. There are examples of potbelly sculptures corresponding to the general type that are not so fat as is the norm.|$|E

25|$|Note that isometries {{of order}} n include, {{but are not}} {{restricted}} to, n-fold rotations. The theorem also excludes S8, S12, D4d, and D6d (see point groups in three dimensions), <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> 4- and 6-fold rotational symmetry only.|$|E

25|$|Tumors may {{be caused}} by {{conditions}} other than an overgrowth of neoplastic cells, however. Cysts (such as sebaceous cysts) are also referred to as tumors, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> no neoplastic cells. This is standard in medical billing terminology (especially when billing for a growth whose pathology has yet to be determined).|$|E
25|$|Adoption {{studies also}} suggest a strong genetic {{tendency}} towards alcoholism. Studies on children {{separated from their}} biological parents demonstrates that sons of alcoholic biological fathers {{were more likely to}} become alcoholic, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> been separated and raised by non alcoholic parents. Female show similar results, but to a lesser degree.|$|E
25|$|During rush hours, {{people from}} upper or middle classes (one {{of the main}} targets of TransJakarta) usually prefer to use private cars or taxis to avoid {{inconvenience}} of the overcrowded TransJakarta buses <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> to bear with traffic jams instead. Many passengers are thus lower-middle-class people who are ex-users of other less comfortable and/or more expensive commercial buses.|$|E

As of 2010, {{a large number}} of notes from this series have not yet been exchanged, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> not been legal tender for more than 10 years; for example, the value of those 500-franc banknotes still in circulation represents 129.9 million Swiss francs.|$|E
25|$|The {{intervention}} of {{artists in the}} design process has been criticized by experts such as anthropologist Victoria Novelo, who claims {{that many of these}} artists “interfere” in the craft process by introducing ideas <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> no studies in the cultural traditions behind these crafts. She also claims that many college-educated designers believe that with innovative designs, they can help the artisan get out of poverty, without knowing why the artisan is poor in the first place.|$|E
25|$|Over the years, Mao {{has come}} to love Hikari very deeply {{although}} he {{has a hard time}} expressing his feelings for her. When there is tension between them, it {{can be seen in the}} way Hikari performs, but when they are united and on good terms they are invincible. <b>Even</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> a close relationship, Hikari is in love with Ooishi, and this causes hard times in Hikari and Mao's friendship. He knows of her feelings for him, but remains by her side no matter what.|$|E

50|$|In late 2007 (December 21), an H5N2 {{outbreak}} {{was found}} in the Dominican Republic. 15 roosters and 2 hens were eliminated <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> no visible sign of infection.|$|R

25|$|Under special circumstances, certain players may {{be deemed}} {{eligible}} for induction <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> not met all requirements. Addie Joss {{was elected in}} 1978, despite only playing nine seasons before he died of meningitis. Additionally, if an otherwise eligible player dies before his fifth year of retirement, then that player may {{be placed on the}} ballot at the first election at least six months after his death. Roberto Clemente's induction in 1973 set the precedent when the writers chose to put him up for consideration after his death on New Year's Eve, 1972.|$|E
25|$|Equilibria {{are defined}} for {{specific}} crystal phases. Therefore, the solubility product {{is expected to}} be different depending on the phase of the solid. For example, aragonite and calcite will have different solubility products <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> both the same chemical identity (calcium carbonate). Under any given conditions one phase will be thermodynamically more stable than the other; therefore, this phase will form when thermodynamic equilibrium is established. However, kinetic factors may favor the formation the unfavorable precipitate (e.g. aragonite), which is then said to be in a metastable state.|$|E
25|$|Coming out of {{the closet}} is the source of other gay slang {{expressions}} related to voluntary disclosure or lack thereof. LGBT people who have already revealed or no longer conceal their sexual orientation or gender identity are out, i.e. openly LGBT. Oppositely, LGBT people who have yet to come out or have opted not to do so are labelled as closeted or being in the closet. Outing is the deliberate or accidental disclosure of an LGBT person's sexual orientation or gender identity, without their consent. By extension, outing oneself is self-disclosure. Glass closet means the open secret of when public figures' being LGBT is considered a widely accepted fact <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> not officially come out.|$|E
50|$|<b>Even</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> {{their own}} show, <b>they</b> still <b>had</b> several shorts in Animaniacs {{after they got}} the show, they still {{appeared}} in the shows intro, and often appeared in cameo appearances.|$|R

50|$|In 2013, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> {{previously}} {{happened during}} 2008, some negotiations about Canal+ sale appeared again. These ones {{would be more}} real because of the hurry banks had to solve Prisa's debt to them.|$|R
25|$|Whether Tobias had {{an affair}} with Claire is not certain; however, his {{infidelity}} is. Claire knows about an affair that Tobias had with a young woman, but she has never told Agnes about it. Claire only uses the information to taunt Tobias. Some critics have suggested that the young anonymous woman with whom Tobias had the affair was actually Claire. Despite all this, Tobias appears secure in his marriage with Agnes, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> not shared the same bed for many years. Their marriage seems to have become something of a habit. Tobias shows very little affection to his wife except in the way that he reinforces her thoughts, giving her assurances, for instance, that she, of all people, should not worry about going mad.|$|E
25|$|The {{long history}} of the West in popular culture tends to define those clothed in Western {{clothing}} as cowboys or cowgirls whether they have ever been on a horse or not. This is especially true when applied to entertainers {{and those in the}} public arena who wear western wear as part of their persona. However, the reality is that many people, particularly in the West, including lawyers, bankers, and other white collar professionals wear elements of Western clothing, particularly cowboy boots or hats, as a matter of form <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> other jobs. Conversely, some people raised on ranches do not necessarily define themselves cowboys or cowgirls unless they feel their primary job is to work with livestock or if they compete in rodeos.|$|E
25|$|In certain circumstances, {{an implied}} {{contract}} may be created. A contract is implied in fact if the circumstances imply that parties have {{reached an agreement}} <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> not done so expressly. For example, John Smith, a former lawyer may implicitly enter a contract by visiting a doctor and being examined; if the patient refuses to pay after being examined, the patient has breached a contract implied in fact. A contract which is implied in law is also called a quasi-contract, {{because it is not}} in fact a contract; rather, it is a means for the courts to remedy situations in which one party would be unjustly enriched were he or she not required to compensate the other. Quantum meruit claims are an example.|$|E
