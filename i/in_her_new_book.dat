In an ethnographically rich description West shows how the Gimi produce coffee; attach meaning to it and how coffee production has profoundly changed the Gimi environment and subjectivities. By tracing the movement of coffee, she shows how the Gimi interact with Papua New Guinean buyers, what social worlds coffee creates among coffee workers and coffee producer elites of urban PNG and finally how coffee from Eastern Highlands is being sold in capitalism’s centers...|$|R

The poems aren’t all great, some of them aren’t even good, but collectively they are overwhelming — which is both a compliment to Bang’s talent and to the toughness of mind that allowed her to attempt this difficult project in the first place.|$|E
50|$|Her new poetic {{direction}} with Septemberlyran ("The September Lyre") met {{no greater}} understanding {{from the public}} and from critics.

The newspaper debate in Södergran's case was harsh - none of the debaters seemed either to have had any sense of the conditions under which the poems had been written: hunger, tuberculosis, the threat of being exiled or killed if Raivola was taken by the Red Guard - but she won a friend and lifelong ally in the young critic Hagar Olsson (1893-1978).|$|E

"With her {{characteristic}} fierce passion, West argues <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>new</b> <b>book</b> {{that the}} Communist infiltration {{led to a}} successful 'assault on our nation's character' during the Cold War that left us the 'heirs to a false and hollow history' and 'unwitting participants' in 'a secretly subverted pageant.' In other words, perhaps we didn't win the Cold War after all. ... West argues {{that the impact of}} this 'deep occupation' did not simply fall away {{with the collapse of the}} Soviet Union. It lives today in our embrace of the Communists' false historical narrative, exemplified in our 'denial of the Soviet regime-engineered Famine in the Ukraine ... a seminal moment in the history of the world. The seminal moment, perhaps, of the twentieth century.' It lives also in our weakened resistance to their ideology. 'Americans are not equipped,' West notes, 'not prepared, to regard anything resembling Communism ... as an existential threat to liberty.' Instead, we still romanticize Moscow's agents as 'idealists' and 'are continually conditioned to embrace Communistic principles, all serving to expand the power and authority of the state over the individual.'" ...|$|E

40|$|How are {{developments}} in neuroscience shaping {{our understanding of}} the concepts of self, morality, free will, and consciousness? Much has been written on how and whether findings from brain science challenge deeply held, everyday views about who we are and why we do what we do. <b>In</b> <b>her</b> <b>newest</b> <b>book</b> Touching a Nerve: The Self as Brain, the philosopher Patricia Churchland sets out to reassure the concerned reader that despite the sensationalism of media reports and the apparent nihilism of certain academic perspectives, all is well in the world of neuroscience. For her, unraveling the biological threads that make up the fabric of our existence provides a reassuring, not a threatening, form of explanation. Although she admits that there are still many pieces that are not yet in place, according to Churchland the puzzles of brain and mind will be solved, and the answers—in the form of neurobiological mechanisms—will be deeply enlightening rather than depressing. Despite the fact that the fundamental questions in psychology are founded in philosophical questions, the two disciplines remain mostly estranged, and communication between them is virtually nonexistent in most institutions. The empirical mind-set of most psychologists leads them to see much of the philosophy of mind as consisting of armchair though...|$|R
