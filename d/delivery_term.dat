40|$|A {{target zone}} for the forward {{exchange}} rate is developed using a log-linear monetary model. Exchange rates are driven by a Wiener process. A central bank purchases or sells foreign exchange forward to keep the target forward rate in a specified band. Defending such a target zone does not require regulated Wiener process, for the central bank's forward exchange intervention can avoid disturbing the money supply. A forward-rate target zone can stabilize the spot rate against a free float and its stabilizing effects become more significant if the <b>delivery</b> <b>term</b> applying to the target forward rate is shorter. ...|$|E

40|$|Businesses are {{increasingly}} interested in improving their operations {{with the purpose}} of boosting company performance, which can be impacted through enhanced working capital management. Inventory management is one area that can help release working capital to other investments. In particular, the inventories in the end of supply chain are a potential phase for improvements, because these mostly tie up capital. In international trade, the commonly accepted trade terms, Incoterms, determine where the main risks and responsibilities are exchanged between the trade parties, and the companies can recognize their sales as revenue at this point. Therefore, one opportunity for decreasing the tied-up capital is to select the <b>delivery</b> <b>terms,</b> Incoterms, differently in the supply chain. The Incoterms are defectively studied in the academic literature, and there are {{only a small number of}} papers deepening the knowledge surrounding the topic. The relationship between the <b>delivery</b> <b>terms</b> and working capital management seems to be unobserved in these previous studies and hence this thesis examines if the amount of the goods-in-transit inventories is dependent on the <b>delivery</b> <b>terms</b> used in inter- and intra-organizational contracts. This thesis is conducted as a single case study and a mixed methods approach was selected as the applied research strategy as it enables reaching a wider perspective in the topic. The quantitative data describes the potential correlation between the choices of the <b>delivery</b> <b>terms</b> and the inventories, while the qualitative data from the interviews brings a practical approach to this research.

In nine patients adnexal tumours coexisted with pregnancy. Laparascopic operation {{was performed in}} all nine patients. In the observed period there were 8, 708 deliveries so {{that the percentage of}} tumours of ovary in pregnant women in our hospital was 0.1 % and that is lower rate than found in the literature. All of the pregnancies had gestation age between 12 and 15  weeks, clinical diagnoses: cysts ovarialis and patohistologic diagnoses were: cystys folicularis ovari in three cases, cystadenoma serosum in five cases and cystis dermoidalis in one case. The smallest diametre of the cyst measured by ultrasound was 8  cm and the greatest 12  cm. Neither of the tumours observed by ultrasound had malignant characteristics and CA 125 was within normal limits. In three cases we performed cystectomy (cystis folicularis) and in another cases adnexectomy. In all operations histopathologic analysis” ex tempore” was done and results were “benignant”. The post-operative period in all patients was regular and they were discharged the next day. We did not prescribe antibiotics as therapy.

40|$|Elevated gestational {{concentrations}} of allopregnanolone {{are essential for}} the development and neuroprotection of the foetal brain. Preterm birth deprives the foetus of these high levels of allopregnanolone, which {{may contribute to the}} associated adverse effects on cerebellar development. Preterm birth alters expression of GABA A receptor subunit composition, which may further limit neurosteroid action. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the effects of suppression of allopregnanolone levels on the markers of development and functional outcome. Pregnant guinea pigs were treated with finasteride at a dose (25 mg/kg maternal weight) shown to suppress allopregnanolone between 60 days of gestation until <b>delivery</b> (<b>term</b> ∼ 71 days). The cerebella from neonates, whose mothers were treated with finasteride or vehicle during pregnancy, were collected at postnatal age 8. Pups that received finasteride displayed significantly greater glial fibrillary acid protein area coverage and reduced GABA A receptor α 6 -subunit messenger RNA within the cerebellum than pups that were exposed to vehicle. These findings indicate that loss of neurosteroid action on the foetal brain in late gestation produces prolonged astrocyte activation and reductions in GABA A receptor α 6 -subunit expression. These changes may contribute to the long-term changes in function associated with preterm birth...|$|E

Diagnosis {{could be very}} simple if one {{consider}} brain tumor alongside blurred symptoms of headache, repetitive vomiting and/or epileptic attacks during pregnancy. The aim {{of this paper was}} to emphasize the importance of such pregnancy expert control and completion. Case report. We presented a 45 -year-old pregnant woman at 30 weeks of gestation, and with brain tumor recidive in frontal lobe, hystologicaly confirmed as astrocytoma. The patient was newly diagnosed with tumor in 1995, and monitored until 2003, when she was operated. Due to malignant profile and a partial removal of tumor masses, postoperative gamma-ray therapy was recommended. Because of the continuous need for that kind of therapy, termination of pregnancy was also recommended. It was carried out by the application of PGE 2 vaginal tablets.

Its use varies depending on business environments, countries and companies involved. The most common factors affecting the choice of <b>delivery</b> <b>terms</b> from Incoterms 2000 are volume/value of the consignment, control over delivery, common practice, legislation obstacles, etc. Countries participating in seafood trade have different practices in the use of <b>terms</b> of <b>delivery</b> that can be stipulated by various factors such as location of the country itself and its suppliers, economical and legal regulations, and others.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Perinatal {{asphyxia}} is {{an important}} cause of mortality and permanent neurological and developmental deficit. Early and accurate diagnosis would help to establish the likely prognosis and may also help in determining the most appropriate treatment. Studies in experimental animal models suggest that a protein called Hsp 70 {{may be a good}} and potentially useful marker of cellular stress that may be clinically useful in determining the presence of neonatal asphyxia. OBJECTIVES: Regarding the importance of early and accurate diagnosis of asphyxia, we conducted this study, which is the first investigation of the comparison of the serum Hsp 70 antigen level between asphyxiated and healthy infants. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this observational study, the serum concentrations of Hsp 70 antigen were compared between neonates suffering from perinatal asphyxia (n = 50) and normal neonates (n = 51). The inclusion criteria for the cases were neonates who had reached term and had at least two clinical criteria of asphyxia. Exclusion criteria were babies with gestational age < 37 weeks, infants with congenital abnormalities or positive blood culture. Exclusion criteria in this group were the requirement to hospital stay during first week of the life or babies whose mothers had difficulties during pregnancy or <b>delivery.</b> <b>Term</b> neonates without major anomalies who had asphyxia during delivery were enrolled in the first six hours after delivery, and control group consisted of healthy term neonates without problems and normal delivery process {{in the first week of}} life.

The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the pregnancy outcome of women with IBD who have been exposed to thiopurines. METHODS: 215 pregnancies in 204 women were registered and documented in the CESAME cohort between May 2004 and October 2007. Physicians documented the following information from the women: last menstrual date, <b>delivery</b> <b>term,</b> details of pregnancy outcome, prematurity, birth weight and height, congenital abnormalities, medication history during each trimester, smoking history and alcohol ingestion. Data were compared between three groups: women exposed to thiopurines (group A), women receiving a drug other than thiopurines (group B) and women not receiving any medication (group C). RESULTS: Mean age at pregnancy was 28. 3 years. 75. 7 % of the women had Crohn's disease and 21. 8 % had ulcerative colitis, with a mean disease duration of 6. 8 years at inclusion. Of the 215 pregnancies, there were 138 births (142 newborns), and the mean birth weight was 3135 g. There were 86 pregnancies in group A, 84 in group B and 45 in group C.

40|$|Suspended solids (SS) {{discharge}} from a {{tropical rain forest}} was observed at the Bukit Tarek Experimental Watershed in Peninsular Malaysia in order to elucidate mechanisms of SS production and transport. Peaks of water discharge and electrical conductivity (EC) lagged further behind rainfall peaks than did dissolved oxygen (DO), indicating that the discharge in the early stage of a storm is mainly formed by rain water with high DO. Stream water showing a high value of EC originating from subsurface water formed the main storm flow and lagged behind the rainfall. SS concentrations rose to a peak quickly and, like DO, the peak preceded that of water discharge. A clockwise hysteresis loop {{in the relationship between}} SS and water discharge exists, and the magnitude of hysteresis loop is in proportion to storm size. The values of SS concentration correlate positively with the values of rainfall intensity on logarithmic axes. The time intervals between peaks of rainfall and SS concentrations are assumed to be a <b>delivery</b> <b>term</b> expressing distance from sediment source to measuring point. Immediate transport of SS from the source to the sampling site, the short time gap between the peaks of rainfall and SS concentrations, and the high rate of infiltration on the hillslope suggest that the sources of high SS concentrations are located close to the stream. The calculated source area is located at a gentler part of the stream, where wet riparian areas exist. The strong relationship between water discharge and SS concentration during the small storm proves that the source areas of SS and water were the same. In contrast, the source area of SS disappeared when rainfall ceased, whereas the source area of water discharge was still expanding in the larger storm. These phenomena may produce clockwise loops in the SS concentration-water discharge relationship...|$|E
