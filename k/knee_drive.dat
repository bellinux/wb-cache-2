40|$|Characterization of {{the joint}} torque {{coupling}} strategies used in the lower extremity to generate maximal and submaximal levels of torque at either the hip, knee, or ankle is lacking. Currently, there are no available isometric devices that quantify all concurrent joint torques in the hip, knee, and ankle of a single leg during maximum voluntary torque generation. Thus, joint-torque coupling strategies in the hip, knee, and concurrent torques at ankle and/or coupling patterns at the hip and <b>knee</b> <b>driven</b> by the ankle {{have yet to be}} quantified. This manuscript describes the design, implementation, and validation of a multiple degree of freedom, lower extremity isometric device (the MultiLEIT) that accurately quantifies simultaneous torques at the hip, knee, and ankle. The system was mechanically validated and then implemented with two healthy control individuals and two post-stroke individuals to test usability and patient acceptance. Data indicated different joint torque coupling strategies used by both healthy individuals. In contrast, data showed the same torque coupling patterns in both post-stroke individuals, comparable to those described in the clinic.

This thesis {{is part of the}} research activities "Active actuators for prostheses and orthoses" at the Fraunhofer IPA. The analysis and design of a drive system for active powered knee prostheses is discussed. The derivation of technical requirements for an active prosthesis system is carried out for an active <b>driven</b> <b>knee</b> prosthesis system. Parameters for the drive system in the active <b>driven</b> <b>knee</b> prosthesis are defined using methods from the engineering of electrical drives.

Possible methods for the modeling of multidisciplinary systems are discussed using the example of an active knee prosthesis. Modeling of the active knee prosthesis using a state space model, the bondgraph methodology and the Port-Hamilton-Approach is described. The simulation of the active powered knee prosthesis is conducted using the state space model and the Port-Hamilton-Approach.

30|$|Femoral {{lengthening}} with {{or along}} intramedullary (IM) nails will occur along {{the axis of}} the nail coincident with the anatomical axis of the bone. In the femur particularly, such lengthening often creates lateral mechanical axis deviation as the <b>knee</b> is <b>driven</b> medially. In cases where shortening is associated with frontal plane deformity the surgeon needs to correct the deformity intra-operatively, however, subsequent lengthening along the anatomical axis will create deformity. Thus, planning for lengthening of the femur with or along IM nails, whether shortening is associated with frontal plane deformity or not, requires a completely different planning strategy. The author questioned if a resolution anatomical axis can be identified and used for planning when lengthening the femur along or with IM nails while still applying the same classic CORA deformity analysis method.|$|R

40|$|Cloud {{computing}} is able {{to deliver}} large amount of computing resources on demand, {{and it has become}} one of the most effective ways to implement large-scale computationally intensive applications. In a cloud computing environment, applications typically involve workflows. Therefore, optimized workflow scheduling can greatly improve the overall performance of cloud computing. However, existing studies on cloud workflow scheduling usually consider at most three objectives only and effective methods to solve scheduling problems with four or more objectives still lack. To address the above issue, a new cloud workflow scheduling model is formulated that simultaneously considers four objectives, namely, minimization of makespan, minimization of the average execution time of all workflow instances, maximization of reliability, and minimization of the cost of workflow execution. To solve this four-objective scheduling problem, an improved <b>knee</b> point <b>driven</b> evolutionary algorithm is proposed.

40|$|Abstract—Biomechanical {{studies of}} human walking reveal that {{compliance}} {{plays an important}} role at least in natural and smooth motions as well as for self-stabilization. Inspired by this, we present here {{the development of a new}} lower leg segment of the dynamic biped robot “RunBot”. This new lower leg segment features a compliant ankle connected to a flat foot. It is mainly employed to realize robust self-stabilization in a passive manner. In general, such self-stabilization is achieved through mechanical feedback due to elasticity. Using real-time walking experiments, this study shows that the new lower leg segment improves dynamic walking behavior of the robot in two main respects compared to an old lower leg segment consisting of rigid ankle and curved foot: 1) it provides better self-stabilization after stumbling and 2) it increases passive dynamics during some stages of the gait cycle of the robot; i. e., when the whole robot moves unactuated. As a consequence, a combination of compliance (i. e., the new lower leg segment) and active components (i. e., actuated hip and <b>knee</b> joints) <b>driven</b> by a neural mechanism (i. e., reflexive neural control) enables RunBot to perform robust self-stabilization and at the same time natural, smooth, and energy-efficient walking behavior without high control effort.

A realistic bio-inspired musculoskeletal knee joint model is used to control the exoskeleton.

Identification of the model parameters is done through an unconstrained optimization problem formulation. A control law strategy based on the principle of assistance as needed is proposed. This approach guarantees asymptotic stability of the knee joint orthosis and adaptation to human-orthosis interaction. Moreover, the proposed control law is robust with respect to external disturbances. Experimental validations are conducted online on a healthy subject during flexion and extenion of their knee joint.

50|$|One {{measuring}} device is {{placed at the}} surface of the sonde, the identical second of the pair is placed a necessary distance off the body of the sonde by unfolding a 1 m long boom (carbon composite tube). Two redundant pyrotechnical cutters cut one loop of thin rope to free the power of metal springs. The <b>driven</b> <b>knee</b> lever rotates the boom perpendicularly outwards and latches it in place. Only the use of a pair of sensors together with the rotation of the sonde allows to resolve the small natural magnetic field beneath the fields of the disturbing fields of the probe itself. The measurements to identify the fields produced by the craft took place on the route from Earth to Venus. The lack of magnetic cleanness was due to the reuse of the Mars Express spacecraft bus which did not carry a magnetometer. By combining the data from two-point simultaneous measurements and using software to identify and remove interference generated by Venus Express itself, it was possible to obtain results of a quality comparable to those produced by a magnetically clean craft.|$|R
40|$|Patellofemoral joint (PFJ) {{complications}} are {{a common}} cause of dissatisfaction leading to revision total knee arthroplasty (TKA) due to wear and/or pain. It is thought that increased contact pressures and forces within the PFJ contribute to increased incidences of pain and wear of the patella button. Previous work suggests {{that this may be}} associated with femoral component rotation and hence this should be controlled tightly during surgery; but the available data are limited. This study aimed to assess the influence of femoral component rotation on the quadriceps forces, and the contact areas and compressive forces within the PFJ using an in vitro, non-cadaveric, TKA model. Static and dynamic tests were carried out using a six degrees of freedom vertical knee simulator designed to replicate motion of an average UK woman. The movement at the <b>knee</b> is <b>driven</b> by actuation of the quadriceps model. The hamstrings are modelled physiologically by two cables each with a constant tension of 50 N. Scorpio PS size 7 (Stryker, NJ) components were implanted in composite bones by an orthopaedic surgeon and primary ligaments were modelled using synthetic cords. The required quadriceps force to achieve extension during a squat and the associated patella compressive forces were assessed using single axis load cells. The PFJ centre of pressure (COP) was measured using a pressure array (Novel, Munich) and the contact areas assessed using pressure film (FujiFilm). Three femoral positions were assessed (neutral, 5 ° internal and 5 ° external rotation) each with a 5 mm medialised patella dome and a centrally placed asymmetric patella button. Six repeats were carried out. Irrespective of patella button type, femoral external rotation caused an increase of up to 10 % in the required quadriceps force and compressive PFJ forces, likely due to the alteration of the Q angle caused by the component rotation. Internal rotation caused corresponding reductions. These trends are only significant in mid-flexion and are masked by increased loading. The patella button geometry also appeared to influence the degree to which femoral rotation affected the PFJ. Fewer differences were demonstrated with the medialised dome, which was associated with increasing lateral COP measurements post-TKA with external rotation. In contrast, the asymmetric dome demonstrated medial COP shifts with external rotation. In conclusion, PFJ forces and pressures are influenced by a complex combination of prosthesis geometry and component positioning. As little as 5 ° of femoral rotation may have an implant specific, detrimental effect on the PFJ...|$|R

40|$|Fusion Motion Capture (FMC), a {{wearable}} {{motion capture}} system was developed, {{and applied to}} the optimisation of athlete performance in alpine ski racing. In {{what may be a}} world first, the three-dimensional movements of a skilled athlete (with less than 20 FIS 1 points) skiing through a complete training giant slalom racecourse were analysed. FMC consists of multiple light weight sensors attached to the athlete including inertial measurement units (IMUs), pressure sensitive insoles and a global position system (GPS) receiver. The IMUs contain accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers. Limb orientation and location are obtained by mathematically combining the most reliable data from each sensor using fusion algorithms developed by the author. FMC fuses the signals from the IMUs and GPS without the need for the post filtering, usually applied to motion capture data, and therefore, maintains maximum bandwidth. The FMC results were stable and relatively independent of motion type and duration unlike other inertial systems available in 2005, when the research was initiated. Analysis of data collected from an athlete skiing giant slalom contradict the traditional „going straight turning short? race strategy. The shortest path may not always be the fastest. Instead each gate has a different optimum approach arc. Optimum turn radius increases with both increasing speed and increasing terrain slope. The results also contradict laboratory measurements of ski/snow sliding friction and suggest that snow resistance in giant slalom is of similar importance to wind drag. In addition to gravity, the athlete increased speed using the techniques of „lateral projection? and „pumping?. Race performance was determined from the analysis of the athlete skiing through the entire course. FMC proved, therefore, to be more suitable than traditional optical systems that are practically limited to capturing small sections of a race course. The athlete experienced high and rapidly fluctuating torques about all three axes of the lower joints. This information could be useful in designing training programmes racecourses and equipment to reduce <b>knee</b> injuries.

40|$|Background: Gait and {{mobility}} impairments affect {{the quality of}} life (QoL) of patients with progressive multiple sclerosis (MS). Robot-assisted gait training (RAGT) is an effective rehabilitative treatment but evidence of its superiority compared to other options is lacking. Furthermore, the response to rehabilitation is multidimensional, person-specific and possibly involves functional reorganization processes. The aims of this study are: (1) to test the effectiveness on gait speed, mobility, balance, fatigue and QoL of RAGT compared to conventional therapy (CT) in progressive MS and (2) to explore changes of clinical and circulating biomarkers of neural plasticity. Methods: This will be a parallel-group, randomized controlled trial design with the assessor blinded to the group allocation of participants. Ninety-eight (49 per arm) progressive MS patients (EDSS scale 6 - 7) will be randomly assigned to receive twelve 2 -h training sessions over a 4 -week period (three sessions/week) of either: (1) RAGT intervention on a robotic-driven gait orthosis (Lokomat, Hocoma, Switzerland). The training parameters (torque of the <b>knee</b> and hip <b>drives,</b> treadmill speed, body weight support) are set during the first session and progressively adjusted during training progression or (2) individual conventional physiotherapy focusing on over-ground walking training performed with the habitual walking device. The same assessors will perform outcome measurements at four time points: baseline (before the first intervention session); intermediate (after six training sessions); end of treatment (after the completion of 12 sessions); and follow-up (after 3 months {{from the end of the}} training program). The primary outcome is gait speed, assessed by the Timed 25 -Foot Walk Test. We will also assess walking endurance, balance, depression, fatigue and QoL as well as instrumental laboratory markers (muscle metabolism, cerebral venous hemodynamics, cortical activation) and circulating laboratory markers (rare circulating cell populations pro and anti-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines, growth factors, neurotrophic factors, coagulation factors, other plasma proteins suggested by transcriptomic analysis and metabolic parameters). Discussion: The RAGT training is expected to improve mobility compared to the active control intervention in progressive MS. Unique to this study is the analysis of various potential markers of plasticity in relation with clinical outcomes. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials. gov, identifier: NCT 02421731.
