5|$|The {{employer}} mandate requires employers meeting certain {{criteria to}} provide health insurance to their workers. The mandate applies to employers with more than 50 employees that do not offer health insurance to their full-time workers. Critics claimed that the mandate created a perverse incentive for business to keep their full-time headcount below 50 and to hire part-time workers instead. Between March 2010 and 2014 the number of part-time jobs declined by 230,000, {{while the number of}} full-time jobs increased by 2 million. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>sector</b> full-time jobs turned into part-time jobs much more than in the private sector.

40|$|The present {{demand for}} {{economically}} viable buildings <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Saudi <b>Public</b> <b>Sector</b> is {{coupled with the}} need to maximise the efficient use of Saudi Arabian natural resources. The lack of consideration paid to sustainability issues during the concept phase has resulted in higher consumption of materials and energy during both the construction and operational phases of many building projects. Although there is extensive Value Management (VM) knowledge and experience, many who work <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Saudi <b>Public</b> <b>Sector</b> appear to have less experience of sustainable development, consequently sustainable construction is all too often not a major consideration. This paper is part of an ongoing research which aims to exploit the VM experiences and skills of those <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Saudi <b>Public</b> <b>Sector</b> <b>in</b> order to accelerate the understanding and implementation of sustainable development <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country.
