During food preparation, {{vegetables and fruits}} are usually placed on a movable belt and washed, then are placed into a container to be steamed or boiled for 1–3 minutes. This process {{is referred to as}} blanching, and is used as a method to destroy enzymes in the food that can cause chemical changes negatively affecting overall flavor and color of the fruit and vegetables. As for meats, prior to cooking, they are trimmed of fat and cut into proper sizes. The fish is usually cleaned and cut into fillets, and poultry is usually washed thoroughly and dressed. Meats are then seasoned, placed on trays, and are cooked in an oven for a predetermined amount of time. After all the food is ready to be packaged, it is sent to the <b>filling</b> <b>lines.</b> The food is placed in its compartments as the trays pass under numerous filling machines; to ensure that every packaged dinner gets an equal amount of food, the filling devices are strictly regulated.|$|E

40|$|Master of Science in Engineering - EngineeringWastewater is {{generated}} {{in the production of}} water-based paints when vessels and <b>filling</b> <b>lines</b> are washed in between batches. This results in a dilute paint wastewater stream. This dissertation concerns the study of the treatment of wastewater, using flocculation and coagulation processes. Standard jar test were used in screening the flocculants. The inorganic flocculants used were ferric chloride (FeCl 3) and aluminium sulphate (Al 2 (SO 4) 3) A thermodynamic model is developed for understanding the coagulation and flocculation process for inorganic flocculants. Properties such as the effect of bulk concentration, pH and feed concentration of flocculant on wastewater were investigated. The impact of kinetics and other properties such as the influence of redox potential on flocculation experiments are also evaluated in order to have an understanding of the properties that influence the flocculation of wastewater. It was found that thermodynamics could be used to predict gross flocculation behaviour. However mixing and the rate of the nucleation and growth of flocs are also important and need to be controlled for efficient and reproducible flocculation...|$|E
40|$|Waste {{water is}} {{generated}} in the batch production process of water-based paints when vessels and <b>filling</b> <b>lines</b> are washed between batches. This results in a diluted paint wash water stream. The wash water is currently treated in a flocculation process using ferric chloride as a coagulant. An opportunity was identified for re-using wash water from white, non-textured paints. It is necessary to stabilise the wash water with biocides. This water is then used in place of fresh feed water for lower quality paints. Since the wash water originates from high quality products, adding this water to the lower quality paints results in a quality improvement. In addition, treatment costs of the wash water are reduced. This wash water represents approximately 65 % of total effluent from the plant. With respect to {{the remainder of the}} wash water, the concentration of paint solids in the wastewater stream can vary widely. For effective treatment different solids content in the waste water requires different dosage levels of the coagulant. If ferric chloride is used as the coagulant overdosing results in waste that must be disposed of as toxic. Ferric chloride dosing can be more easily controlled by using a dilute feed solution. This paper presents the findings of the effect of concentration of the coagulant on the coagulation process. Both the solids content of the wash water and the concentration of the coagulant {{have been found to be}} important variables to ensure efficient flocculation and coagulant utilisation...|$|E

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} the work {{discussed}} in {{this paper is to}} understand, analyse and benchmark the "Packing and Filling" processes within BASF. A benchmarking project is described in detail which aimed to cover sites in different countries that supplied many different variants of finished goods in order to establish best practice and then to generate some options for their implementation. Design/methodology/approach - The project used an adaptation of accepted benchmarking methodology combined with other techniques (such as rich picture generation, and cluster analysis) to maximise the insight generated. Findings - The findings of the research showed that one of the main factors effecting the process was how third parties were used (e. g. extent and nature of out-sourcing, and its degree of centralisation). Research limitations/ implications - The exercise was challenged by the selection of suitably similar benchmarking candidates because the environment was complex and highly varied; the paper explains practical solutions for dealing with this challenge. Practical limitations - Strategic and tactical options are outlined {{at the end of the}} paper and will have applicability to other organisations and industries that are looking to find the answers to frequently asked questions about how to successfully implement an internal process benchmarking project in a large complex organisation that has high variety in end products and delivery methods. Originality/value - The methodology described in this paper is of a proprietary and unique nature. The paper is structured around some key questions commonly asked of benchmarking, and the answers are provided via a real in-depth case study from BASF that spans 4 sites in 3 countries using 15 different <b>filling</b> <b>lines.</b> © Emerald Group Publishing Limited...|$|E
40|$|This study aims {{to advance}} {{understanding}} of baked-in siliconization of cartridges for application in Insulin injection pens. This research {{is motivated by}} {{lack of knowledge of}} baked-in siliconization and business opportunities a better understanding can provide. The primary contribution from this work is the development of a recommended silicone profile that can significantly reduce friction force variation within a cartridge during device use. An Insulin pen delivers Insulin to patients by the mechanical pushing of a rubber stopper through a cylindrical glass cartridge forcing the Insulin through a hypodermic needle at the cap end. This cartridge is coated with a very thin layer of silicone to reduce the force necessary for injection. This silicone layer is introduced to the cartridge prior to filling in the manufacturing process. This step of the filling process was characterized and results revealed different silicone profiles and friction force profiles for different <b>filling</b> <b>lines.</b> Correlations between silicone profile and friction forces were then developed for cartridges. As predicated, lower levels of silicone thickness and a higher percent of dry spots led to increased friction forces and higher variation among samples. These correlations were used to recommend a silicone profile with an average layer thickness greater than 60 nm with fewer than 20 % dry spots. Finally, atmospheric pressure plasma (APP) treatment was explored as a pre-treatment step to improve siliconization. Findings from APP feasibility studies showed that APP increases glass surface energy and wettability, but that its effect wears off over time and therefore impact on siliconization is still unknown. These results set the stage for further research and process optimization of siliconization in the context of medical injection devices. Insights gained will contribute to design of new devices, improved manufacturing operations and increased quality for Sanofi and the pharmaceutical medical device industry.
