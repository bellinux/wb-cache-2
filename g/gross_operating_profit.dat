It is noted that management contracts have become increasingly commonplace in the international hotel sector and that gross revenue and <b>gross</b> <b>operating</b> <b>profit</b> are the most extensively used determinants of operator incentive fee remuneration. These findings present a platform for examining how revenue and <b>gross</b> <b>operating</b> <b>profit</b> are deficient in promoting owner-operator goal congruency. In light of this, return on investment (ROI) and residual income (RI) are examined as potential alternative determinants of operator reimbursement. Although it is appears that both ROI and RI as determinants of hotel operator fees would represent an advance in promoting owner-operator goal congruency, a rationale outlining how RI is preferable to ROI is outlined. © 2010 International Council on Hotel, Restaurant and Institutional Education...|$|E

Further, the objective of this study is to examine whether there is any significant difference in profitability between firms in services and manufacturing sector during the period of 2006 to 2010. Panel data regression analysis using fixed effects estimation has been applied in this study based on secondary data collected from a sample of 75 trading/services firms and 143 industrial products firms listed in the Main Market of Bursa Malaysia for the period of 2006 to 2010, which represents services and manufacturing sector respectively. The results of the study revealed that there is a significant negative relationship found on the number of days accounts receivable (ARD) and cash conversion cycle (CCC) with the profitability of firms in services sector, measured by <b>gross</b> <b>operating</b> <b>profit</b> (GOP). Meanwhile, a significant positive relationship is established between number of days inventories (INV) and profitability of the firms in services sector. In addition, the services firms are found to adopt an aggressive working capital investment policy (WCIP), which resulted in an increase in profitability. Meanwhile, there is no significant relationship found between working capital financing policy (WCFP) and profitability of the firms. Overall, the results indicate that the profitability of the firms in services sector can be enhanced by reducing the ARD and CCC, as well as increasing the INV level. For manufacturing firms, it is revealed that there is a significant negative relationship found between number of days accounts receivable (ARD) and <b>gross</b> <b>operating</b> <b>profit</b> (GOP) of the firms, which means that the profitability of the firms can be improved by reducing the ARD. The rest of the working capital management components such as number of days inventories (INV), number of days accounts payable (AP) and cash conversion cycle (CCC) do not indicate a significant relationship with the <b>gross</b> <b>operating</b> <b>profit</b> (GOP) of the firms. The manufacturing firms are found to adopt a conservative working capital investment policy (WCIP) that resulted in an increase in profitability, which is evidenced by the significant positive relationship reported between WCIP and GOP during the period of 2006 to 2010. However, it is also found that manufacturing firms adopts an aggressive working capital financing policy (WCFP) that decreases the profitability of the firms in view that there is a significant negative relationship found between WCFP and GOP of the firms.

40|$|Purpose – The {{objective}} of this exploratory study is to investigate the “flow-through” or relationship between top-line measures of hotel operating performance (occupancy, average daily rate and revenue per available room) and bottom-line measures of profitability (<b>gross</b> <b>operating</b> <b>profit</b> and net operating income), {{before and during the}} recent great recession. Design/methodology/approach – This study uses data provided by PKF Hospitality Research for the period from 2007 - 2009. A total of 714 hotels were analyzed and various top-line and bottom-line profitability changes were computed using both absolute levels and percentages. Multiple regression analysis was used {{to examine the relationship between}} top and bottom line measures, and to derive flow-through ratios. Findings – The results show that average daily rate (ADR) and occupancy are significantly and positively related to <b>gross</b> <b>operating</b> <b>profit</b> per available room (GOPPAR) and net operating income per available room (NOIPAR). The evidence indicates that ADR, rather than occupancy, appears to be the stronger predictor and better measure of RevPAR growth and bottom-line profitability. The correlations and explained variances are also higher than those reported in prior research. Flow-through ratios range between 1. 83 and 1. 91 for NOIPAR, and between 1. 55 and 1. 65 for GOPPAR, across all chain-scales. Research limitations/implications – Limitations of this study include the limited number of years in the study period, limited number of hotels in a competitive set, and self-selection of hotels by the researchers. Practical implications – While ADR and occupancy work in combination to drive profitability, the authors 2 ̆ 7 study shows that ADR is the stronger predictor of profitability. Hotel managers can use flow-through ratios to make financial forecasts, or use them as inputs in valuation models, to forecast future profitability. Originality/value – This paper extends prior research on the relationship between top-line measures and bottom-line profitability and serves to inform lodging owners, operators and asset managers about flow-through ratios, and how these ratios impact hotel profitability...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. B. A.) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2009. The primary {{objective}} of any corporation should be shareholder wealth maximisation. A firm's working capital policies {{have an effect}} on the firm's expected future returns and the risk associated with the returns, which ultimately have an impact on shareholder wealth. Efficient working capital management is a fundamental portion of the overall corporate strategy to create shareholder value. In this study the relationship of corporate profitability and working capital management was investigated. This relationship is examined using regression analysis. A sample of 118 firms listed on the Johannesburg Securities Exchange (JSE) for the period 2003 to 2007 was used. The purpose of this study is to establish whether a relationship exists between working capital management efficiency and profitability, considering the cash conversion cycle and operating profitability of the firm. The results of the regression analysis indicated that a statistical significance exists for three of the five years (2003 - 2005) analysed between profitability, measured with the <b>gross</b> <b>operating</b> <b>profit,</b> and the cash conversion cycle. It is observed (2003 - 2005 regression results) that a lower <b>gross</b> <b>operating</b> <b>profit</b> is associated with an increase in number of days accounts payable. The negative relationship between accounts receivable and firms' profitability (for 2003 - 2005) suggests that less profitable firms will pursue a decrease of accounts receivables in the attempt to reduce cash gap in the respective cash conversion cycles. The negative relationship between the number of days inventory and corporate profitability (for 2003 - 2005) suggests that a sudden decrease in sales accompanied by mismanagement of inventory, will lead to tying up excess capital at the expense of profitable operations. Managers or owners of firms can improve profits for firms by handling correctly the cash conversion cycle and keeping each individual component (accounts receivable, accounts payable and inventory) to an optimum level. These results (for 2003 - 2005) suggest that managers can create value for shareholders by reducing the cash conversion cycle and its individual components. Master...|$|E
40|$|A {{survey of}} nearly 500 revenue {{management}} {{professionals in the}} hotel and related industries forecasts that the application of revenue management (RM) will become more strategic and will be supported by increasingly sophisticated technology as it includes more of hotels’ income streams. In particular, RM will likely be applied to function space, and may also include such revenue streams as spas, restaurants, and golf courses. As a consequence, the revenue management function will become more central to hotel operations, and will quite likely be a separate department that is under the general manager’s supervision. The central, strategic role of RM will require upgraded measurement techniques. Rather than revenue per available room (RevPAR), future revenue management may have a profit-oriented metric, such as <b>gross</b> <b>operating</b> <b>profit</b> per available room (GOPPAR) or total revenue per available room or per available unit of area.

40|$|Working capital optimization, {{as an act}} of {{balancing}} liquidity and profitability, presents significant challenges when small businesses lack managerial expertise and access to affordable capital and credit facilities. To remain successful through efficient utilization of working capital, small business leaders need to understand the association between working capital management (WCM), working capital policy (WCP), and business profitability (PFT). Anchored in the cash conversion cycle theory, the purpose of this correlational {{study was to examine the}} relationship between WCM, WCP, and PFT. The study employed a retrospective secondary analysis of financial data from 2004 to 2013 from a random sample of 176 publicly traded small U. S. manufacturing companies. The regression results incorporating 3 models were significant in predicting profitability in terms of <b>gross</b> <b>operating</b> <b>profit</b> (GOP), return on asset (ROA), and Tobin 2 ̆ 7 s q (TBQ). The regression results showed that WCM and WCP were significant predictors of GOP, F (5, 170) = 8. 580, p 3 ̆c. 000, R 2 =. 201; ROA, F (5, 170) = 4. 079, p 3 ̆c. 002, R 2 =. 107; and TBQ, F (5, 170) = 6. 231, p 3 ̆c. 000, R 2 =. 155.

Small business leaders may incorporate working capital optimization practices into overall corporate strategy, thereby aligning working capital needs with the changing business requirements. The implications for positive social change included the potential to provide small business leaders with knowledge of WCM and WCP as drivers of PFT.

40|$|Our {{research}} {{demonstrates that}} {{supply chain management}} techniques can improve the incremental gross profits of wind plant and storage operations by up to five times. Using Monte-Carlo simulation we create and test scenarios that achieve incremental <b>operating</b> <b>profits</b> of up to 15 percent of base case revenue, and show pre-tax profit. We show that energy storage-specifically {{in the form of}} utility-scale batteries - can become economically-viable today when using supply chain management strategies under certain scenarios. To achieve these results we have built a simulation model with three data inputs. First, we synthesized the output of a 120 MW wind plant in Maine for both summer and winter seasons. Second, we simulated New England ISO market pricing data for both the Day-Ahead and Real-Time markets in summer and winter seasons using Monte Carlo simulations. Third, using actual data from two existing battery companies, we incorporated the technical and cost specifications for two energy storage facilities. All of these data inputs feature adjustable parameters so we can test various plant configurations, market volatilities and storage capabilities, among other inputs. Using our model, we then employed supply chain management network design strategies and daily operating policies to test profitability improvements on our wind plant-plus-storage operation. For example, we ran simulations for scenarios where our storage facility is either located in Maine next to our wind plant, or located in another state. (cont.) Also, since storage can make wind generation a predictable capacity resource, we ran simulations to test results in both the Day-Ahead and Real-Time markets. In addition we developed four (4) inventory management policies with dynamic input (charge) and output (discharge) strategies for our storage units. For each policy, we had to conceptualize the policy - while considering planning horizon, lead time, holding costs, shortage costs, market pricing and storage capabilities - and then build functionality in our model to execute those strategies in dynamic pricing and wind plant output environments. The outcomes of our simulation model include incremental <b>gross</b> <b>profit,</b> <b>operating</b> <b>profit</b> and pre-tax profit for each of 54 scenarios, as well as 11 management insights for wind plant and storage operators, storage technology manufacturers and New England ISO leadership. by Prashant Saran and Clayton W.
