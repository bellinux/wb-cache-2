50|$|Brahmbhatt, who is {{the founder}} and CEO of Jade Management, had {{previously}} stated that more than 30 of his clients had purchased about $12 million in <b>fraudulent</b> <b>notes</b> from Success Trade. He had sent an e-mail to some of his clients indicating that it was unclear whether they would get their money back.|$|R
50|$|There {{have been}} several {{instances}} where people have used the <b>fraudulent</b> <b>notes</b> as legitimate currency, often resulting in arrest. In March 2006, agents from ICE and the Secret Service seized 250 notes, each bearing a denomination of $1,000,000,000 (one billion dollars) from a West Hollywood apartment. The suspect had previously been arrested on federal charges for attempting to smuggle more than $37,000 in currency into the U.S. following a trip to South Korea in 2002. Much of the artwork on the notes was duplicated from the real $1000 bill, including the portrait of Grover Cleveland. Another incident involving similar notes bearing a denomination each of $500,000,000, occurred in Chiasso, Switzerland in June 2009.|$|R
50|$|Joseph McCabe {{suggested}} that Goligher had used {{her feet and}} toes to levitate the table and move objects in the séance room and compared her fraudulent mediumship to Eusapia Palladino who performed similar tricks. Edward Clodd also dismissed the experiments as <b>fraudulent</b> and <b>noted</b> that Goligher refused invitation to be examined {{by a group of}} magicians and scientists.|$|R
5000|$|Fortress {{has said}} it lost $125 million {{purchasing}} <b>fraudulent</b> promissory <b>notes</b> from Marc Dreier, who had been operating a Ponzi scheme. Fortress {{filed a lawsuit against}} the law firm Dechert in an attempt to recover the loss. The lawsuit was filed in New York state court, alleging Dechert issued a [...] "false" [...] legal opinion letter that Dreier used to defraud Fortress.|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to study how informational {{frictions}} affect asset liquidity in OTC markets in a laboratory setting. The experiments replicate an OTC market similar to the one used in monetary and financial economics (Shi, 1995; Trejos and Wright, 1995; Duffie, Garleanu, and Pedersen, 2005) : individuals are matched bilaterally and at random, there are gains from trades due to differences in technologies and endowments, and the terms of trade are determined through a simple bargaining protocol. Subjects buy commodities that have different private values with assets that have common values and can be subject to a private information problem. The asset plays the role of a medium of exchange, but this role can be affected by its lack of recognizability. We study a benchmark experiment where the OTC bargaining game takes place under complete information, a set of experiments with adverse selection where the terminal value of notes are determined exogenously, and a set of experiments with hidden actions where subjects can produce <b>fraudulent</b> <b>notes</b> at some cost...|$|R
50|$|Lord Selbourne's {{statement}} {{has been}} heavily criticized, {{particularly on the}} requirement that the defaulting fiduciary / trustee has to be dishonest or <b>fraudulent.</b> A commentator <b>noted</b> that Fyler v Fyler and AG v The Corporation of Leicester, two decisions on knowing assistance in the 1840s which predated Barnes v Addy, {{did not mention the}} moral quality of the breach induced or assisted at all.|$|R
5000|$|On August 9, 2016, the CNE {{presented}} a timeline for the referendum {{that made it}} unlikely it would be held {{before the end of}} 2016, in part due to a new 90-day verification period for signatures. The second stage of the petition was estimated by the CNE to likely take place in October 2016, resulting in a vote likely happening in February 2017. Opposition leaders were reported to be planning a large protest march in response, with leaders accusing the CNE of favoring the incumbent Socialist Party with the wait time. According to Reuters on August 9, [...] "Socialist Party leaders have dismissed the recall effort as <b>fraudulent</b> and <b>noted</b> that the elections council found nearly 10,000 signatures corresponding to people who were deceased." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{analysis}} of unstructured data types is another challenge getting {{attention in the}} industry. Unstructured data differs from structured data in that its format varies widely and cannot be stored in traditional relational databases without significant effort at data transformation. Sources of unstructured data, such as email, the contents of word processor documents, PDFs, geospatial data, etc., are rapidly becoming a relevant source of business intelligence for businesses, governments and universities. For example, in Britain the discovery that one company was illegally selling <b>fraudulent</b> doctor's <b>notes</b> in order to assist people in defrauding employers and insurance companies, {{is an opportunity for}} insurance firms to increase the vigilance of their unstructured data analysis. The McKinsey Global Institute estimates that big data analysis could save the American health care system $300 billion per year and the European public sector €250 billion.|$|R
50|$|Temples to Melqart {{are found}} {{at least three}} Phoenician/Punic sites in Spain: Cádiz, Ibiza in the Balearic Islands and Cartagena. Near Gades/Gádeira (modern Cádiz) was the westernmost temple of Tyrian Heracles, near {{the eastern shore of}} the island (Strabo 3.5.2 - 3). Strabo notes (3.5.5 - 6) that the two bronze pillars within the temple, each 8 cubits high, were widely proclaimed to be the true Pillars of Heracles by many who had visited the place and had sacrificed to Heracles there. Strabo {{believes}} the account to be <b>fraudulent,</b> in part <b>noting</b> that the inscriptions on those pillars mentioned nothing about Heracles, speaking only of the expenses incurred by the Phoenicians in their making.|$|R
5000|$|Social {{networking}} spam is spam directed {{specifically at}} users of internet social networking {{services such as}} Google+, Facebook, Pinterest, LinkedIn, or MySpace. Experts estimate {{that as many as}} 40% of social network accounts are used for spam. These spammers can utilize the social network's search tools to target certain demographic segments, or use common fan pages or groups to send <b>notes</b> from <b>fraudulent</b> accounts. Such <b>notes</b> may include embedded links to pornographic or other product sites designed to sell something. In response to this, many social networks have included a [...] "report spam/abuse" [...] button or address to contact. Spammers, however, frequently change their address from one throw-away account to another, and are thus hard to track.|$|R
5000|$|In 1663 they aided the Esopus {{tribe in}} attacking the Dutch colonists, and were {{defeated}} by Martin Cregier (see Esopus Wars). By a <b>noted</b> <b>fraudulent</b> treaty {{known as the}} Walking Purchase, {{the main body of}} the Munsee was forced to move from the Delaware River about the year 1740. They settled on the Susquehanna River, on lands assigned them by the Iroquois - (Ong we Oweh - [...] "The only true men"). Soon afterward they moved westward, joining the main Lenape nation on the Ohio River. Most became incorporated with that group. In 1756 those remaining in New York were placed upon lands in Schoharie County and were incorporated with the Mohawk.|$|R
50|$|Near {{the eastern}} shore of the island of Gades/Gadeira (modern Cádiz, just beyond the strait) Strabo {{describes}} the westernmost temple of Tyrian Heracles, the god with whom Greeks associated the Phoenician and Punic Melqart, by interpretatio graeca. Strabo notes that the two bronze pillars within the temple, each eight cubits high, were widely proclaimed to be the true Pillars of Hercules by many who had visited the place and had sacrificed to Heracles there. But Strabo believes the account to be <b>fraudulent,</b> in part <b>noting</b> that the inscriptions on those pillars mentioned nothing about Heracles, speaking only of the expenses incurred by the Phoenicians in their making. The columns of the Melqart temple at Tyre were also of religious significance.|$|R
40|$|The {{challenge}} of calculating damages in securities litigation is often {{compounded by the}} phenomenon of investors that have accrued both gains and losses {{as a result of}} the defendant company’s same <b>fraudulent</b> misrepresentations. This <b>Note</b> traces the opposing damages approaches and accounting methods courts have adopted in these instances to the dual origins and objectives of the Rule 10 b- 5 private right of action. Underscoring the shortcomings in these damages calculations founded predominantly upon either deterrent or compensatory grounds, this Note instead strives for a measure that not only balances both imperative ends but also yields a more sensible and equitable outcome. Namely, this Note proposes that losses should only be offset by gains when they are sufficiently linked by an ongoing trading strategy, and that matching sales of securities with the latest purchases will most clearly reflect gains and losses during the class period...|$|R
5000|$|In recent years, metal {{boxes of}} <b>fraudulent</b> Federal Reserve <b>Notes</b> in astronomically high {{denominations}} (often in $100 million, $500 million, or $1 billion) and often with coupons attached {{have turned up}} in various eastern countries such as the Philippines or Malaysia. In many cases, the notes are claimed {{to be part of}} a lost trove of secretly issued Federal Reserve Notes, and are special or not known to the public due to secrecy. Also, the bonds are sometimes treated to make them look old by getting them wet and moldy. However, the Federal Reserve has never issued notes in such denominations, and has issued warnings against them on its website. Additionally, there are several errors in the bonds as well as the metal boxes, many of them anachronistic. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York writes thatThe Federal Reserve is aware of several scams involving high denomination Federal Reserve notes and bonds, often in denominations of 100 million or 500 million dollars, dating back to the 1930s, usually 1934. In each of these schemes, fraudulent instruments are claimed {{to be part of a}} long-lost supply of recently discovered Federal Reserve notes or bonds.Fraudsters often falsely claim that the purported Federal Reserve notes or bonds that they hold are somehow very special and are not known to the public because they are so secret. Fraudsters have attempted to sell these worthless instruments, or to redeem or exchange them at banks and other financial institutions, or to secure loans or obtain lines of credit using the fictitious instruments as collateral.|$|R
5000|$|The McPherson party, {{apart from}} McPherson's testimony, claimed actual {{contact with the}} kidnappers through blind attorney-at-law Russell A. McKinley who was trusted by the kidnappers because he was blind. In May and again in June, two men, Miller and Wilson, aliases for [...] "Steve" [...] and the unnamed assailant of the McPherson complaint, {{allegedly}} approached him then made an offer to return Aimee Semple McPherson for $25,000. They told him a rubber mask was briefly used on McPherson when taking her and the drug was laced with one quarter grain (16 mg) of morphine insuring she was [...] "doped" [...] safely and quickly. They were given four questions passed to McKinley from Kennedy that only her daughter knew to prove the men actually had her. Mildred Kennedy also gave McKinley $1,000 to assist him in his work. A ransom note was relayed and given to the police who in disguise, visited a hotel lobby drop site as a precaution in case it was genuine. No results were forthcoming and the <b>note</b> dismissed as <b>fraudulent.</b> Another ransom <b>note</b> demanding $500,000 {{was sent to the}} Angelus Temple with two of the questions correctly answered. McPherson later recalled an incident from her captivity when two of the kidnappers returned annoyed from an errand at a hotel stating they recognized the detectives positioned there and left. She also said they asked her personal questions and once she realized what they were doing and refused to answer further. She thought as the $500,000 being asked for her return was way too much, the Temple did not have it. One of them then burned her with his cigar in an attempt to get the other two questions answered. They threatened to take a finger if their ransom note did not work. Some days later, McPherson escaped.|$|R
