40|$|A {{cross-sectional}} {{study was conducted}} to evaluate the prevalence of extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) - and plasmid-mediated AmpC-producing Escherichia coli and associated risk factors in dairy herds. One hundred dairy herds were randomly selected and sampled to study the presence of ESBL- and AmpC-producing E. coli in slurry samples. The sensitivity of testing slurry samples for ESBL/AmpC herd status is less than 100 %, especially for detecting herds with a low ESBL/AmpC prevalence. Therefore, whereas herds that tested positive for ESBL/AmpC-producing E. coli in slurry were defined as positive herds, herds with negative slurry samples were defined as unsuspected. Isolates of ESBL- and AmpC-producing E. coli were further characterized by detection and typing of their ESBL/AmpC gene. At the initial sampling, a comprehensive questionnaire was conducted at the participating farms. The farmers were asked questions about management practices potentially associated with the ESBL/AMPC herd status. Also, data on antimicrobial purchases during 2011 were acquired to evaluate whether the animal-defined daily dose of antimicrobials per year at farm level was associated with the ESBL/AmpC herd status. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to determine the association between management practices and the ESBL/AmpC herd status. Six months after the initial slurry sampling, 10 positive herds and 10 herds that had an unsuspected ESBL/AmpC herd status during the first visit were resampled. At each farm, slurry samples and feces from 24 individual cows were collected to evaluate within herd dynamics. During the first sampling, ESBL/AmpC-producing E. coli were isolated from the slurry samples collected at 41 % of the herds. In total, 37 isolates were further characterized, revealing 7 different ESBL genes (blaCTX-M- 1, - 2, - 14, - 15, - 32, - 55 and blaTEM- 52), 1 plasmid-encoded AmpC gene (blaCMY- 2), and 1 chromosomally encoded ampC gene (ampC type 3). The total animal-defined daily dose of antimicrobials per year at farm level was not significantly different between ESBL/AmpC-positive and unsuspected dairy herds. The use of third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins, however, was found to be associated with ESBL/AmpC status, with higher use of these antimicrobials resulting in a significant higher odds to be ESBL/AmpC-positive. Management factors that were associated with a higher odds of being ESBL/AmpC-positive were treatment of all cases of clinical mastitis with antimicrobials, a higher proportion of calves treated with antimicrobials, not applying teat sealants in all cows at dry off, and the use of a <b>floor</b> <b>scraper.</b> This last association, however, was considered a methodological effect rather than a true risk factor. On 5 of the 10 initially positive farms, no ESBL/AmpC-producing E. coli were cultured from the slurry or any of the individual cow samples collected during the second sampling. In 4 of the initially unsuspected farms, slurry or individual cow samples tested positive during the second sampling. In conclusion, ESBL/AmpC could frequently be cultured from slurry samples collected from Dutch dairy farms and the ESBL/AmpC genes carried by the isolates were consistent with those reported earlier. The use of third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins appeared to be associated the ESBL/AmpC herd status...|$|E

50|$|By {{this point}} in his career, Caillebotte had painted many images with great {{fidelity}} to realistic portrayals of people and their environment. As with his Les raboteurs de parquet (English title: The <b>Floor</b> <b>Scrapers),</b> Caillebotte did not attempt to show an idealized form of masculinity, but instead depicted a typical 19th-century male.|$|R
50|$|Les raboteurs de parquet (English title: The <b>Floor</b> <b>Scrapers)</b> is an oil {{painting}} by French Impressionist Gustave Caillebotte. The canvas measures 102 x 146.5 cm. It was originally given by Caillebotte's family in 1894 to the Musée du Luxembourg, {{then transferred to}} the Musée du Louvre in 1929. In 1947, it {{was moved to the}} Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume, and in 1986, it was transferred again to the Musée d'Orsay in Paris, where it is currently displayed.|$|R

5000|$|Despite {{the effort}} Caillebotte {{put into the}} painting, it was {{rejected}} by France's most prestigious art exhibition, the Salon, in 1875. The depiction of working-class people in their trade, not fully clothed, shocked the jurors and was deemed a [...] "vulgar subject matter". He was hurt by this rejection, and instead showed it at the second exhibition of the Impressionists, {{with whom he had}} already associated himself, in 1876. He presented it alongside some of his other works, including a [...] from 1876, and his earlier work Jeune homme à sa fenêtre (Young Man at His Window) The images of the <b>floor</b> <b>scrapers</b> came to be associated with Degas's paintings of washerwomen, also presented at the same exhibition and similarly scorned as [...] "vulgar".|$|R
2500|$|The [...] "Impressionists" [...] – {{also called}} the [...] "Independents", [...] "Intransigents", and [...] "Intentionalists" [...] – had broken away from the {{academic}} painters showing in the annual Salons. Caillebotte made his debut in the second Impressionist exhibition in 1876, showing eight paintings, including, Les raboteurs de parquet (The <b>Floor</b> <b>Scrapers)</b> (1875), his earliest masterpiece. Its subject matter, the depiction of labourers preparing a wooden floor (thought to have been that of the artist's own studio) was considered [...] "vulgar" [...] by some critics {{and this is the}} probable reason for its rejection by the Salon of 1875. At the time, the art establishment deemed only rustic peasants or farmers acceptable subjects from the working class. The painting is now at the Musée d'Orsay. A second version, in a more realistic style resembling that of Degas, also was exhibited, demonstrating Caillebotte's range of technique and his adept restatement of the same subject matter.|$|R
40|$|Most free-stall housing {{systems in}} the Netherlands are {{equipped}} with slatted or solid concrete <b>floors</b> with manure <b>scrapers.</b> A slipping incident occurs when the required coefficient of friction (RCOF) exceeds the coefficient of friction (COF) at the claw–floor interface. An experiment was conducted to measure ground reaction forces (GRF) of dairy cows (n = 9) performing various locomotory behaviors on a nonslippery rubber-covered concrete floor. The RCOF was determined as {{the ratio of the}} horizontal and vertical components of the GRF. It was shown that during straight walking and walking-a-curve, the RCOF reached values up to the COF, whereas for sudden stop-and-start responses, the RCOF reached values beyond the maximum COF that concrete floors can provide. Our results indicate that concrete floors do not provide enough friction to allow natural locomotory behavior and suggest that tractional properties of floors should be main design criteria in the development of better flooring surfaces for cattle...|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of digital dermatitis (DD) in dairy cows has increased considerably {{over the last}} 10 years in The Netherlands, resulting in a current prevalence of 30 % in cows kept in cubicle houses. Our objective was to evaluate a diversified sample of cow- and herd-related risk factors for DD in dairy cows housed in cubicle houses with different flooring systems. Associations were analysed in random-effects logistic-regression models using 2134 cows (37 herds) and 2892 cows (47 herds) in the pasture and housing studies, respectively. At cow-level, the odds of having DD were increased {{in the case of}} lower parity and lactation. Important risk factors at herd-level were: restricted grazing time, fast rise in concentrate amount after calving, feeding by-products, herd trimming only at long intervals, and introduction of dry cows into the lactating herd before calving. The odds for DD were lower if cows were housed on a slatted <b>floor</b> with manure <b>scraper</b> and provided long and wide cubicles, and if calves were reared in the dairy cows¿ accommodation...|$|R
40|$|Risk factors {{concerning}} {{both the}} pasture and housing seasons for interdigital dermatitis and heel-horn erosion (IDHE) were studied in dairy cows in a cross-sectional study in The Netherlands. The study population included 2326 cows (41 herds) and 2751 cows (46 herds) for the pasture and housing seasons, respectively. Of these animals, 545 (23 %) showed serious lesions of IDHE (stages 2 and 3) {{at the end}} of the pasture season and 1269 (46 %) during housing. Logistic regression of the pasture study indicated that increased parity, solid concrete floor, restricted grazing time, and herd trimming at long intervals were associated with an increased odds of IDHE, while dry cows and lactating cows within 30 days after calving as well as cows on a slatted <b>floor</b> with manure <b>scraper,</b> and grassland with mixed type of soil were associated with lower odds. In the housing study, odds of IDHE increased with parity, administering low- or medium-energy roughage, and introduction of dry cows into the lactating herd at > 2 weeks before calving. The presence of long cubicles, knee-bumpers installed in cubicles as well as rearing calves and heifers within the dairy cows¿ accommodation decreased the odds of IDHE...|$|R
40|$|Claw {{health was}} {{examined}} in an observational study on Dutch dairy farms {{with either a}} slatted floor (SL), slatted <b>floor</b> with manure <b>scraper</b> (SL-SCR), solid concrete floor (SCF), a straw yard (SY), or a zero-grazing feeding system (ZG). Hooves of cows' hind legs were examined for the presence and severity of claw disorders during hoof trimming events {{at the end of}} the pasture (P-study) and housing period (H-study). The number of cows in each study was 3078 (49 herds) and 3190 (47 herds), respectively. Due to a different hoof trimming strategy, data collected during both observation periods in SY herds (638 cows; 16 herds) were combined. Cows in straw yards (SY) had by far the lowest numbers of claw disorders. Over 80 % of cows exposed to concrete flooring had at least one claw disorder at the time of observation, whereas on SY surfaces, this percentage was between 55 and 60. Cows on SL-SCR were less frequently affected by interdigital dermatitis/heel erosion (IDHE) and digital dermatitis (DD) than cows on SL (reference floor system). Little difference in claw health was found between SF and SL. The ZG cows were at higher risk (OR > 2) for most claw disorders in the P-study, whereas in the H-study, ZG cows showed less IDHE, sole hemorrhage, and sole ulcer. All herds on concrete flooring (SL, SL-SCR, SCF, ZG) were infected by DD, resulting in an average cow level prevalence of 30 %. This indicates that the level of DD infection has increased considerably over the last 10 yr in The Netherlands...|$|R
40|$|Since {{more and}} more dairy cattle is housed in zero grazing {{production}} systems, claw health is today more than ever an area of concern. In particular, digital dermatitis (DD) or Mortellaro disease is considered {{a major cause of}} epidemic lameness. In literature, several risk factors associated with DD are mentioned. A digital survey was conducted among Flemish dairy farmers (420 completed questionnaires) to provide an overview of the prevalence of DD in Flemish dairy herds and the associated risk factors. Associations between the DD prevalence and possible risk factors are the result of a chi-squared test. A large herd with a number of lactating cows was positively associated with a high prevalence of DD (P = 0. 0031). More than 67 % of the respondents used a claw bath or sprayer. The use of a claw bath was positively associated with a higher prevalence of DD (P 20 %) was mentioned by 34. 5 % of the respondents with cubicle housing, it is used in most farms (more than 85 % of the respondents used cubicle housing). Cleaning of the <b>floors</b> by manure <b>scrapers</b> and robots was associated with a high prevalence of DD (P= 0. 0001). The DD prevalence was higher in dairy farms that buoght heifers and adult cows (prevalence DD> 20 % in 52. 6 % of the farms; P 20 % in 51, 4 % of the farms; P< 0. 0001). These results demonstrate an association between the DD prevalence on a farm and specific management factors. status: publishe...|$|R
