5|$|Double-articulation cranes, {{which can}} load {{at a rate}} of 1,000tons per hour, {{represent}} a widely used method, and the use of shore-based <b>gantry</b> <b>cranes,</b> reaching 2,000tons per hour, is growing. A crane's discharge rate is limited by the bucket's capacity (from 6 to 40tons) and by the speed at which the crane can take a load, deposit it at the terminal and return to take the next. For modern <b>gantry</b> <b>cranes,</b> the total time of the grab-deposit-return cycle is about 50seconds.|$|E
5|$|To {{obtain the}} {{greatest}} operational efficiency, ML constructed two dedicated container terminals {{with their own}} <b>gantry</b> <b>cranes,</b> spreaders etc. The Manchester terminal was built on an open site next to {{the western end of}} No. 9 Dock. A second container berth was added in 1972. The other terminal was created at Montreal, with similar equipment, where the containers were trans-shipped to a dedicated liner train operated by Canadian National Railways, which carried them onwards to Toronto and further destinations.|$|E
5|$|The keel of Yamato, {{the lead}} ship of the class, was laid {{down at the}} Kure Naval Arsenal, Hiroshima, on 4 November 1937, in a {{dockyard}} {{that had to be}} adapted to accommodate her enormous hull. The dock was deepened by one meter, and <b>gantry</b> <b>cranes</b> capable of lifting up to 350 tonnes were installed. Extreme secrecy was maintained throughout construction, a canopy even being erected over part of the drydock to screen the ship from view. Yamato was launched on 8 August 1940, with Captain (later Vice-Admiral) Miyazato Shutoku in command. A great effort was made in Japan to ensure that the ships were built in extreme secrecy to prevent American intelligence officials from learning of their existence and specifications.|$|E
40|$|The use of <b>gantry</b> <b>crane</b> {{systems for}} {{transporting}} payload {{is very common}} in industrial application. However, moving the payload using the crane {{is not an easy}} task especially when strict specifications on the swing angle and on the transfer time need to be satisfied. To overcome this problem, an intelligent <b>gantry</b> <b>crane</b> system had been introduced. Fuzzy logic controllers were adopted, designed and implemented for controlling payload position as well as the swing angle of the <b>gantry</b> <b>crane.</b> In this paper, robustness of the proposed intelligent <b>gantry</b> <b>crane</b> system is evaluated and compared with an automatic <b>gantry</b> <b>crane</b> controlled by the classical PID controllers.

40|$|Abstract: This article {{presents}} the design system for high efficiency <b>gantry</b> <b>crane</b> system using elevator and conveyor system. The basic concept {{for the proposed}} <b>gantry</b> <b>crane</b> system {{can be used with}} modification of the classical <b>gantry</b> <b>crane</b> instead of changing lots of them. However, the proposed crane system can reduce the cycle time more than the classical <b>gantry</b> <b>crane.</b> The high efficiency <b>gantry</b> <b>crane</b> can also improve the productivity of the container transportation job because of reducing cycle time. In order to achieve the effectiveness of the proposed design system, the loading and unloading capabilities are compared with the classical crane, and then these results show that the proposed crane system has better performances than the classical type.

25|$|Belfast's skyline {{is still}} {{dominated}} today by Harland & Wolff's famous twin <b>gantry</b> <b>cranes,</b> Samson and Goliath, built in 1974 and 1969 respectively. There is also speculation about a resurgence in {{the prosperity of}} the shipyard thanks to the company's diversification into emerging technologies, particularly in renewable energy development, such as offshore wind turbine and tidal power construction, which may {{provide an opportunity to}} further improve the company's fortunes in the long term. For example, the United Kingdom planned to build 7,500 new offshore wind turbines between 2008 and 2020, creating great demand for heavy assembly work. Unlike land-based wind turbines, where assembly occurs on site, offshore wind turbines have part of their assembly done in a shipyard, and then construction barges transport the tower sections, rotors, and nacelles to the site for final erection and assembly. As a result of this, in late 2007, the 'Goliath' gantry crane was re-commissioned, having been moth-balled in 2003 {{due to the lack of}} heavy-lifting work at the yard.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Problem statement: Most of {{the common}} <b>gantry</b> <b>crane</b> results in a sway motion when {{transporting}} the load as fast as possible. In addition, precise cart position control of <b>gantry</b> <b>crane</b> must required a zero or near zero residual sway. Approach: In this study, the development of hybrid control schemes for input tracking and anti-sway control of a <b>gantry</b> <b>crane</b> system was investigated. To study {{the effectiveness of the}} controllers, a Proportional-Derivative (PD) -type fuzzy logic control was developed for cart position control of a <b>gantry</b> <b>crane.</b> It was then extended to incorporate input shaper control schemes for anti-sway control of the system. The positive and new modified Specified Negative Amplitude (SNA) input shapers were designed based on the properties of the system for control of system sway. The new SNA was proposed to improve the robustness capability while increasing the speed of the system response. Results: Simulation results of the response of the <b>gantry</b> <b>crane</b> with the controllers were presented in time and frequency domains. The performances of the of the hybrid control schemes were examined in terms of input tracking capability, level of sway reduction and robustness to parameters uncertainty. Conclusion: A significant reduction in the system sways had been achieved with the hybrid controllers regardless of the polarities of the shapers.

500|$|A major hurdle {{to achieve}} {{sustainability}} is the alleviation of poverty. It {{has been widely}} acknowledged that poverty is one source of environmental degradation. Such acknowledgment has {{been made by the}} Brundtland Commission report Our Common Future and the Millennium Development Goals. There is a growing realization in national governments and multilateral institutions {{that it is impossible to}} separate economic development issues from environment issues: according to the Brundtland report, [...] "poverty is a major cause and effect of global environmental problems. It is therefore futile to attempt to deal with environmental problems without a broader perspective that encompasses the factors underlying world poverty and international inequality." [...] Individuals living in poverty tend to rely heavily on their local ecosystem as a source for basic needs (such as nutrition and medicine) and general well-being. As population growth continues to increase, increasing pressure is being placed on the local ecosystem to provide these basic essentials. According to the UN Population Fund, high fertility and poverty have been strongly correlated, and the world's poorest countries also have the highest fertility and population growth rates. The word sustainability is also used widely by western country development agencies and international charities to focus their poverty alleviation efforts in ways that can be sustained by the local populace and its environment. For example, teaching water treatment to the poor by boiling their water with charcoal, would not generally be considered a sustainable strategy, whereas using PET solar water disinfection would be. Also, sustainable best practices can involve the recycling of materials, such as the use of recycled plastics for lumber where deforestation has devastated a country's timber base. Another example of sustainable practices in poverty alleviation is the use of exported recycled materials from developed to developing countries, such as Bridges to Prosperity's use of wire rope from shipping container <b>gantry</b> <b>cranes</b> to act as the structural wire rope for footbridges that cross rivers in poor rural areas in Asia and Africa.|$|E
