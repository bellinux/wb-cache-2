2500|$|According to Crampin [...] {{shear wave}} {{splitting}} measurements {{can be used}} to monitor stress levels in the earth. [...] It is well known that rocks near an earthquake-prone zone will exhibit <b>dilatancy.</b> [...] Shear wave splitting is produced by seismic waves traveling through a medium with oriented cracks or crystals. [...] The changes in shear wave splitting measurements over the time leading up to an impending earthquake can be studied to give insight to the timing and location of the earthquake.

2500|$|In the 1970s the dilatancy–diffusion {{hypothesis}} was highly regarded as providing a physical basis for various phenomena seen as possible earthquake precursors.

The intercept of the straight line on the shear stress axis is called the cohesion. It is well known that the resulting intercept depends on the range of stresses considered: it is not a fundamental soil property. [...] The curvature (nonlinearity) of the failure envelope occurs because the <b>dilatancy</b> of closely packed soil particles depends on confining pressure.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{many studies}} {{questioned}} these results, and the hypothesis eventually languished. Subsequent study showed it [...] "failed for several reasons, largely {{associated with the}} validity of the assumptions on which it was based", including the assumption that laboratory results can be scaled up to the real world. Another factor was the bias of retrospective selection of criteria. Other studies have shown <b>dilatancy</b> to be so negligible that [...] concluded: [...] "The concept of a large-scale 'preparation zone' indicating the likely magnitude of a future event, remains as ethereal as the ether that went undetected in the Michelson–Morley experiment." ...|$|E

[...] Small-scale laboratory experiments {{have shown that the}} ratio of these two velocities – represented as Vp/Vs – changes when rock is near the point of fracturing. [...] In the 1970s it was considered a likely breakthrough when Russian seismologists reported observing such changes (later discounted.) in the region of a subsequent earthquake. This effect, as well as other possible precursors, has been attributed to <b>dilatancy,</b> where rock stressed to near its breaking point expands (dilates) slightly.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to the friction and interlocking (<b>dilatancy)</b> components of strength, the structure and fabric also {{play a significant role}} in the soil behavior. [...] The structure and fabric include factors such as the spacing and arrangement of the solid particles or the amount and spatial distribution of pore water; in some cases cementitious material accumulates at particle-particle contacts. Mechanical behavior of soil is affected by the density of the particles and their structure or arrangement of the particles as well as the amount and spatial distribution of fluids present (e.g., water and air voids). Other factors include the electrical charge of the particles, chemistry of pore water, chemical bonds (i.e. cementation -particles connected through a solid substance such as recrystallized calcium carbonate) ...|$|E
2500|$|Crampin [...] (1980) {{proposed}} {{the theory of}} earthquake prediction using shear wave splitting measurements. [...] This theory {{is based on the}} fact that microcracks between the grains or crystals in rocks will open wider than normal at high stress levels. [...] After the stress subsides, the microcracks will return to their original positions. [...] This phenomenon of cracks opening and closing in response to changing stress conditions is called <b>dilatancy.</b> [...] Because shear wave splitting signatures are dependent on both the orientation of the microcracks (perpendicular to the dominant stress direction) and the abundance of cracks, the signature will change over time to reflect the stress changes in the area. [...] Once the signatures for an area are recognized, they may then be applied to predict nearby earthquakes with the same signatures.|$|E
2500|$|But in {{addition}} to friction, soil derives significant shear resistance from interlocking of grains. [...] If the grains are densely packed, the grains tend to spread apart from {{each other as they}} are subject to shear strain. The expansion of the particle matrix due to shearing was called <b>dilatancy</b> by Osborne Reynolds. If one considers the energy required to shear an assembly of particles there is energy input by the shear force, T, moving a distance, x and there is also energy input by the normal force, N, as the sample expands a distance, y. [...] Due to the extra energy required for the particles to dilate against the confining pressures, dilatant soils have a greater peak strength than contractive soils. Furthermore, as dilative soil grains dilate, they become looser (their void ratio increases), and their rate of dilation decreases until they reach a critical void ratio. Contractive soils become denser as they shear, and their rate of contraction decreases until they reach a critical void ratio.|$|E
2500|$|When {{stress is}} removed from a {{consolidated}} soil, the soil will rebound, drawing water back into the pores and regaining some of the volume it had lost in the consolidation process. If the stress is reapplied, the soil will re-consolidate again along a recompression curve, defined by the recompression index. Soil that has been consolidated to a large pressure and has been subsequently unloaded {{is considered to be}} overconsolidated. The maximum past vertical effective stress is termed the preconsolidation stress. A soil which is currently experiencing the maximum past vertical effective stress is said to be normally consolidated. [...] The overconsolidation ratio, (OCR) is the ratio of the maximum past vertical effective stress to the current vertical effective stress. The OCR is significant for two reasons: firstly, because the compressibility of normally consolidated soil is significantly larger than that for overconsolidated soil, and secondly, the shear behavior and <b>dilatancy</b> of clayey soil are related to the OCR through critical state soil mechanics; highly overconsolidated clayey soils are dilatant, while normally consolidated soils tend to be contractive.|$|E

50|$|Drumlins usually {{comprise}} layers constituting till, {{sand and}} gravel in various proportions - indicating that material was repeatedly added to a core, which may be of rock or glacial till. The <b>dilatancy</b> of glacial till was invoked as {{a major factor in}} drumlin formation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dilatancy</b> is {{a common}} feature of the soils and sands. Its effect can be seen when the wet sand around {{the foot of a}} person walking on beach appears to dry up. The {{deformation}} caused by the foot expands the sand under it and the water in the sand moves to fill the new space between the grains.|$|E
50|$|The {{relationship}} between dilation and internal friction is typically {{illustrated by the}} sawtooth model of <b>dilatancy</b> where the angle of dilation {{is analogous to the}} angle made by the teeth to the horizontal. Such a model can be used to infer that the observed friction angle is equal to the dilation angle plus the friction angle for zero dilation.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Dilatancy</b> is {{the volume}} change {{observed}} in granular materials {{when they are}} subjected to shear deformations. [...] This effect was first described scientifically by Osborne Reynolds in 1885/1886 [...] and {{is also known as}} Reynolds <b>dilatancy.</b> Unlike most other solid materials, the tendency of a compacted granular material is to dilate (expand in volume) as it is sheared. This occurs because the grains in a compacted state are interlocking and therefore do not have the freedom to move around one another. When stressed, a lever motion occurs between neighboring grains, which produces a bulk expansion of the material. On the other hand, when a granular material starts in a very loose state it may initially compact instead of dilating under shear. A sample of a material is called dilative if its volume increases with increasing shear and contractive if the volume decreases with increasing shear.|$|E
50|$|Because of <b>dilatancy,</b> {{the angle}} of {{friction}} increases as the confinement increases until it reaches a peak value. After the peak strength of the soil is mobilized {{the angle of}} friction abruptly decreases. As a result, geotechnical engineering of slopes, footings, tunnels, and piles in such soils {{have to consider the}} potential decrease in strength after the soil strength reaches this peak value.|$|E
50|$|During the shearing, a {{granular}} material will typically have {{a net gain}} or loss of volume. If it had originally been in a dense state, then it typically gains volume, a characteristic known as Reynolds' <b>dilatancy.</b> If it had originally been in a very loose state, then contraction may occur before the shearing begins or {{in conjunction with the}} shearing.|$|E
50|$|The {{phenomenon}} of <b>dilatancy</b> {{can be observed}} in a simple shear test on a sample of dense sand. In the initial stage of deformation, the volumetric strain decreases as the shear strain increases. But as the stress approaches its peak value, the volumetric strain starts to increase. After some more shear, the soil sample has a larger volume than when the test was started.|$|E

50|$|Though cooked custard is a weak gel, viscous and thixotropic, a {{suspension}} of uncooked custard powder (starch) in water, {{with the proper}} proportions, has the opposite rheological property: it is negative thixotropic, or dilatant, {{which is to say}} that it becomes more viscous when under pressure. This suspension is termed oobleck and often used in science demonstrations of non-Newtonian fluids. The popular-science programme Brainiac: Science Abuse demonstrated <b>dilatancy</b> dramatically by filling a swimming pool with this mixture and having presenter Jon Tickle walk across it.|$|E
50|$|From the {{triaxial}} test data, {{it is possible}} to extract fundamental material parameters about the sample, including its angle of shearing resistance, apparent cohesion, and <b>dilatancy</b> angle. These parameters are then used in computer models to predict how the material will behave in a larger-scale engineering application. An example would be to predict the stability of the soil on a slope, whether the slope will collapse or whether the soil will support the shear stresses of the slope and remain in place. Triaxial tests are used along with other tests to make such engineering predictions.|$|E

50|$|<b>Dilatancy</b> in a colloid, or {{its ability}} to order in the {{presence}} of shear forces is dependent on the ratio of interparticle forces. As long as interparticle forces such as Van der Waals forces dominate, the suspended particles remain in ordered layers. However, once shear forces dominate, particles enter a state of flocculation and are no longer held in suspension; they begin to behave like a solid. When the shear forces are removed, the particles spread apart and once again form a stable suspension. This is opposite of the shear thinning effect where the suspension is initially in the state of flocculation and becomes stable when a stress is applied.|$|E
