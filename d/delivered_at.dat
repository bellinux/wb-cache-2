40|$|Background: An {{estimated}} 358, 000 maternal deaths still occur worldwide each year. The {{place of}} delivery is of great significance to the reduction of maternal mortality. Moreover, socio-economic factors, cultural traits, and local customs are associated with health-seeking behavior. This study aimed to explore determinants of association between social support and {{place of delivery}}. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted from September to November 2011 at Sosiot Health Center, Kericho West District, Kenya. Participants were 303 mothers who brought their babies to the health center for immunization within {{their first year of}} life. Women underwent a structured interview using a questionnaire on demographic characteristics and their experiences of delivery including place of delivery and social support. Results: The proportion of deliveries at health facilities was significantly higher in unmarried than married women (93 % and 78 %, respectively; P = 0. 008). Unmarried women whose mothers supported them in housework and whose sisters helped them fetch water were more likely to <b>deliver</b> <b>at</b> health facilities (P = 0. 002 and 0. 042, respectively) than those without this support. However, married women whose husbands supported them in farming and whose neighbors helped them fetch water were less likely to <b>deliver</b> <b>at</b> health facilities (P = 0. 003 and 0. 021, respectively) than those without this support. Married women who were advised to <b>deliver</b> <b>at</b> a health facility by their mother-in-law or health staff were more likely to <b>deliver</b> <b>at</b> health facilities (P = 0. 015 and 0. 022, respectively) {{than those who did not}} receive this advice. Multivariate analysis revealed that married women were more likely to <b>deliver</b> <b>at</b> health facilities if they were highly educated (odds ratio [OR] = 2. 5); had financial capability (OR = 4. 3); had medical insurance (OR = 4. 2); were primiparous (OR = 3. 5); did not have the support of sisters-in-law for fetching water (OR = 2. 2); or were advised to <b>deliver</b> <b>at</b> a health facility by family or neighbors (OR = 2. 5). Conclusions: Promotion of delivery at health facilities requires approaches that consider women's social situation, since factors influencing place of delivery differ for married and unmarried women...|$|R

5|$|In smaller litters, {{difficulties}} {{may occur}} during labour due to oversized pups. Large litters result in higher incidences of stillbirth, {{but because the}} pups are <b>delivered</b> <b>at</b> an advanced stage of development, {{lack of access to}} the mother's milk has little effect on the mortality rate of newborns. Cohabitating females assist in mothering duties if lactating.|$|E
5|$|The {{cumulative}} effect of these delays resulted {{in the production of}} {{only a small number of}} Mk VIIs; estimates place the final total produced to be between 100 and 177. The name 'Tetrarch' was given to the Mk VII, on 22 September 1941, on the orders of the War Office. The last of the tanks were built in the first quarter of 1942 and <b>delivered</b> <b>at</b> the end of the year.|$|E

25|$|The {{majority}} of Ghanaian women <b>deliver</b> <b>at</b> {{home with a}} traditional birth attendant and are referred {{to the hospital in}} cases of complicated labor. Although most deliveries are attended by a traditional birth attendant, most women prefer to deliver with a health professional. Barriers to obtaining professional health care include high costs, inadequate transportation, long distances to health care facilities, and poor road conditions. Some women were also too embarrassed to go to a hospital because they did not have nice clothes and preferred to <b>deliver</b> <b>at</b> home where no one could see that they were poor.|$|R

A total of 486 live and inert training bombs were eventually <b>delivered,</b> <b>at</b> a cost of between $1,000 and $2,000 apiece.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1879, Walker and the {{political}} economist Henry George engaged in a prominent debate over economic rents, land, money, and taxes. Based {{on a series of}} lectures <b>delivered</b> <b>at</b> Harvard, Walker published his Land and Its Rent in 1883 as a criticism of George's 1879 Progress and Poverty. Walker's position on international bimetallism influenced his arguments that the primary cause of economic depressions was not land speculation, but rather constriction of the money supply. Walker also criticized George's assumptions that technical progress was always labor saving and whether land held for speculation was unproductive or inefficient.|$|E
5|$|Despite his father's {{wishes that}} DeLee become a rabbi, DeLee {{attended}} Chicago Medical College. Of particular influence on DeLee was obstetrics professor W. W. Jaggard. He graduated in 1891. Author Charlotte Borst noted {{that most women}} <b>delivered</b> <b>at</b> home in the 1870s through 1890s; medical students at Northwestern only witnessed deliveries at that time if they could bribe women into having their babies at the hospital's amphitheatre. DeLee felt fortunate to have observed two such births {{while he was a}} student.|$|E

5|$|Extant {{documentation}} {{makes it}} possible to follow the competition more clearly than {{in the case of the}} shrine dei Miracoli, and the delivered works, their dates and respective payments lend themselves to interesting analyses. By Tamagnino's arrival in 1499, Cairano already had <b>delivered</b> <b>at</b> least five different Caesars and other stone material, but only a payment for a single bust is documented, because his attention was completely taken up with two gigantic angular trophies that he had recently begun. In November 1499, Tamagnino delivered four Caesars and three leonine busts, which showcased his calibre and scale of production.|$|E
5|$|Landings by the 1st Allied Airborne Army's three {{divisions}} {{began in}} the Netherlands on 17September 1944. Although allocation of aircraft for each division was roughly similar, the U.S. 101st Airborne Division landing at Nijmegen would use only one lift. The U.S. 82nd Airborne Division at Grave required two lifts while the British 1st Airborne Division at Arnhem would need three lifts. Whereas the two American divisions <b>delivered</b> <b>at</b> least three quarters of their infantry in their first lift, the 1st Airborne's similar drop used only half its infantry capacity and the remainder to deliver vehicles and artillery.|$|E
5|$|Motor Racing Developments {{initially}} {{concentrated on}} making money by building cars {{for sale to}} customers in lower formulae, so the new car for the Formula One team was not ready until partway through the 1962 Formula One season. The Brabham Racing Organisation (BRO) started the year fielding a customer Lotus chassis, which was <b>delivered</b> <b>at</b> 3:00 am {{in order to keep}} it a secret. Brabham took two points finishes in Lotuses, before the turquoise-liveried Brabham BT3 car made its debut at the 1962 German Grand Prix. It retired with a throttle problem after 9 of the 15 laps, but went on to take a pair of fourth places {{at the end of the}} season.|$|E
