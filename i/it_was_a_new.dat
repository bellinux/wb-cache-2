5|$|During a {{ministry}} of over half-a-century, Luang Pu Sodh taught Dhammakaya meditation continuously, guiding meditation every Thursday and preaching on Buddhism on Sundays and Uposatha days. Luang Pu Sodh would distribute an introductory book about meditation to practitioners. At first, the Dhammakaya meditation method drew {{criticism from the}} Thai Sangha authorities, because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> method. Discussion within the Sangha led to an inspection at Wat Paknam, but {{it was concluded that}} Luang Pu Sodh's method was correct.|$|E
5|$|In July 1917, Corps {{offices in}} Kiev {{circulated}} {{the first issue}} of a recruitment gazette, România Mare ("Greater Romania"), which became the essential component of its propaganda effort in Russia. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> edition of the Bucharest gazette founded by Voicu Nițescu, and, in this new form, was managed by a team of pro-union activists: the Transylvanians Sever Bocu, Ghiță Popp, Iosif Șchiopu and the Bukovinan Filaret Doboș. România Mare was successful, despite the fact that only between 3,000 and 5,000 copies were published per issue.|$|E

5|$|When {{thinking}} about including character goods with the volume releases, Sugawara {{came up with}} the atypical idea of releasing a deluxe and normal edition of the manga after contemplating the inconsistency of novels getting both a soft-cover and hard-cover release, but manga only received one version. Because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> concept, the group experienced several mishaps such as accidentally placing a vertically flipped illustration on the first deluxe edition. The group also decided to use another atypical practice of keeping catchphrases that appeared in the magazine identical to the ones that appear on the frontispieces of the deluxe editions.|$|E
5|$|Development of the I-6 (Istrebitel—fighter) {{began in}} September 1928 with a {{deadline}} for delivery for the first prototype of 1 August 1929 after the first prototypes of the Polikarpov I-3 were completed. Although the new fighter shared many {{of the characteristics of}} the earlier design, including the staggered sesquiplane, single-bay, layout of the wings, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> design which used a nine-cylinder, single-row, air-cooled Bristol Jupiter radial engine rather the water-cooled inline engine of its predecessor. It was designed by the OSS (—Landplane Department), later redesignated as OPO-1 (—Experimental Department) of Aviatrest ("Aviation Trust") under the supervision of Nikolai Polikarpov, head designer of the department. It was originally intended to be compared to the I-3, but this was changed to an evaluation of construction methods with the wooden construction I-6 compared to the mixed construction Polikarpov I-5. Both aircraft used the Jupiter VI engine for which a license had recently been negotiated.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, Thompson wrote The Further Tale of Peter Rabbit as an {{addition}} to the Peter Rabbit series by Beatrix Potter to commemorate the 110th anniversary of the publication of The Tale of Peter Rabbit. She was approached by the publishers to write it, the first authorised Peter story since 1930 {{and the only one}} not written by Potter. The book falls {{in the middle of the}} earlier series, rather than at the end, and takes Peter Rabbit outside of Mr. McGregor's garden and into Scotland. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>New</b> York Times Best Seller. In 2013, Thompson wrote a second book in the series titled The Christmas Tale of Peter Rabbit.|$|E

5|$|Stossel {{has written}} three books. Give Me a Break: How I Exposed Hucksters, Cheats, and Scam Artists and Became the Scourge of the Liberal Media is a 2005 {{autobiography}} from Harper Perennial documenting {{his career and}} philosophical transition from liberalism to libertarianism. It describes his opposition to government regulation, his belief in free market and private enterprise, support for tort reform, and advocacy for shifting social services from the government to private charities. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>New</b> York Times bestseller for 11 weeks. Myths, Lies, and Downright Stupidity: Get Out the Shovel– Why Everything You Know Is Wrong, {{which was published in}} 2007 by Hyperion, questions the validity of various conventional wisdoms, and argues that the belief he is conservative is untrue. On April 10, 2012, Threshold Editions, an imprint of Simon & Schuster, published Stossel's third book No, They Can't: Why Government Fails– But Individuals Succeed. It argues that government policies meant to solve problems instead produce new ones, and that free individuals and the private sector perform tasks more efficiently than the government does.|$|E
5|$|The Dungeons & Dragons Basic Set, {{released}} in 1977, was an introductory {{version of the}} original D geared towards new players and edited by J. Eric Holmes. But in the same year, TSR Hobbies released a completely new and complex version of D, Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (AD). The Monster Manual, released later that year, became the first supplemental rule book of the new system, and many more followed. The AD rules were not fully compatible {{with those of the}} D Basic Set and as a result, D and AD became distinct product lines. Splitting the game lines created a further rift between Gygax and Arneson; although Arneson received a 10% royalty on sales of all D products, Gygax refused to pay him royalties on AD books, claiming <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> and different property. In 1979, Arneson filed a lawsuit against TSR; it was eventually settled in March 1981 with the agreement that Arneson would receive a 2.5% royalty on all AD products, giving him a very comfortable six-figure annual income for the next decade.|$|E
5|$|The type {{specimen}} of Daspletosaurus torosus (CMN 8506) is a partial skeleton including the skull, the shoulder, a forelimb, the pelvis, a femur {{and all of}} the vertebrae from the neck, torso and hip, as well as the first eleven tail vertebrae. It was discovered in 1921 near Steveville, Alberta, by Charles Mortram Sternberg, who thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> species of Gorgosaurus. It was not until 1970 that the specimen was fully described by Dale Russell, who made it the type of a new genus, Daspletosaurus, from the Greek δασπλής (dasples, stem and connective vowel resulting in daspleto~) ("frightful") and σαυρος/sauros ("lizard"). The type species is Daspletosaurus torosus, the specific name torosus being Latin for 'muscular' or 'brawny'. Aside from the type, there is only one other well-known specimen, RTMP 2001.36.1, a relatively complete skeleton discovered in 2001. Both specimens were recovered from the Oldman Formation in the Judith River Group of Alberta. The Oldman Formation was deposited during the middle Campanian stage of the Late Cretaceous, from about 77 to 76 Ma (million years ago). A specimen from the younger Horseshoe Canyon Formation in Alberta has been reassigned to Albertosaurus sarcophagus.|$|E

5|$|Thomas Nuttall {{described}} the {{species in the}} second volume of the his 1846 work The North American Sylva with specific epithet aurea ('golden' in Latin). In 1768, Scottish botanist Philip Miller described Ficus maxima, citing Carl Linnaeus' Hortus Cliffortianus (1738) and Hans Sloane's Catalogus plantarum quæ in insula Jamaica (1696). Sloane's illustration of the species, published in 1725, depicted it with figs borne singly, a characteristic of the Ficus subgenus Pharmacosycea. As {{a member of the}} subgenus Urostigma, F. aurea has paired figs. However, a closer examination of Sloane's description led Cornelis Berg to conclude that the illustration depicted a member of the subgenus Urostigma (since it had other diagnostic of that subgenus), almost certainly F. aurea, and that the illustration of singly borne figs was probably artistic license. Berg located the plant collection upon which Sloane's illustration was based and concluded that Miller's F. maxima was, in fact, F. aurea. In his description of F. aurea, which was based on plant material collected in Florida, Thomas Nuttall considered the possibility that his plants belonged to the species that Sloane had described, but {{came to the conclusion that}} <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> species. Under the rules of botanical nomenclature, the name F. maxima has priority over F. aurea since Miller's description was published in 1768, while Nuttall's description was published in 1846.|$|E
