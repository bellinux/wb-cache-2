40|$|AbstractA new {{approach}} {{based on the}} correlated spectroscopy (COSY) in 2 D NMR has been described for <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>sugar</b> geometries in oligonucleotides. Under the usual low resolution conditions employed in COSY, the intensities of cross peaks depend on the magnitudes of coupling constants. There are five vicinal coupling constants in a deoxyribose ring which {{are sensitive to the}} sugar geometry. The presence, absence and rough comparison of relative intensities of COSY cross peaks arising from such coupling constants enable one to fix the sugar conformation to a fair degree of precision. The methodology has been applied to d-GAATTCGAATTC. It is observed that ten out of the twelve nucleotide units in this sequence exhibit a rare Ol′-endo geometry. The EcoRI cleavage sites (between G and A) in the dodecanucleotide show an interesting variation in the conformation with the two sugars attached to the Gs acquiring a geometry between C 2 ′-endo and C 4 ′-endo...|$|E
40|$|Ethanol, {{reducing}} sugars and acetic acid content, related to yeasts and bacteria spoiling activities, were chosen {{as indicators of}} technological suitability for marc devoted {{to the production of}} grappa. A fiber-optic probe was directly put in contact with marc using the visible near infrared (Vis-NIRS) spectral range from 350 to 1800 nm. Analytical <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>sugar,</b> ethanol and acetic acid concentration was done following standard laboratory methods and partial least squares regressions were performed using untreated and pretreated spectra data. Models were validated using full cross-validation, and their predictive ability was determined by coefficient of determination of cross-calibration and standard error of cross-validation. The best prediction models were developed using absorbance spectra for ethanol and for sugar content while a medium predictive ability of NIRS was obtained for acetic acid.

40|$|The {{deuterium}} {{content of}} sugar in fruits is influenced mainly by two factors – the botanical {{and also the}} geographical origin of the fruit. The information of the fruit origin is kept even after fermentation of the sugar, in the molecules of ethanol. The deuterium content on the methyl group of ethanol then varies depending upon the botanical origin of the fruit. SNIF-NMR (Site-specific Natural Isotope Fractionation – Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) is a specific method for determination of the deuterium isotopic ratio (D/H) in small molecules, e. g. ethanol. This isotopic technique is widely used for <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>sugar</b> adulteration of fruit-based beverages (wines, fruit juices [...] ).

The procedure involving oxi e formation followed by silylation {{for the analysis of}} standard hexoses resulted in the formation of unseparated peaks for D-glucose, D-mannose and D-galactose. Therefore, this procedure was modified to obtain clear separation of hexoses. 2 ̆ 2 STOX 2 ̆ 2 was mixed with TMSI or HMDS, and then added to a standard sugar. mixture containing D-glucose, D-galactose and D-mannose. The mixture was analyzed by gas chromatography with OV- 17 / 0 V- 22 as the stationary phase, resulting in three distinct peaks. Abstract II: Quantitative <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>sugars</b> in gums by GLC method. A modified GLC method was utilized for the detection and quantitative <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>sugars</b> derived from commercial gums. The method is suitable for the analysis of Guar gum, Locust bean gum, Tamarind gum, Agar, Carageenan, Xanthan, Gum Ghatti, Gum Arabic, Emulgum, Gum Tragacanth and Gum Karaya.

Initially, IgG and IgM titres were done using ELISA technique for detecting antibodies against C.

A mobile phase consisting of 20 % 10 mM aqueous ammonium acetate, 8 % methanol, and 72 % water was found to provide abundant [M + NH 4](+) adduct ions when coupled with electrospray ionization. Use of a polymer-based amino analytical column resolved the target compounds from the bulk solvent and provided limited separation among the target compounds. The tat-get analytes were quantified using their [M + NH 4](+) ions. Sample pretreatment was greatly simplified {{in comparison with the}} more commonly used gas chromatographic methods. It involved extraction of aerosol filters in methanol, evaporation of the solvent, and reconstitution with 5 mM ammonium acetate in water prior to the LC-MS analysis. The analyte recoveries were measured at the levels of 100, 500 and 1000 mu g/L to be in the range of 78 - 102 %, 94 - 112 %, and 92 - 110 %, respectively.

We have mainly committed ourselves to the search for answers to two specific and important problematic in this domain. We begin by showing the applicability of visible imaging using an inactinic light and passive thermographic imaging to image the development of seeds and seedlings, a biological phenomenon usually occurring in soil and darkness. We present our contributions to this type of imaging through our contributions to the conception and the realization of a vision system using visible inactinic imaging, whose finality is the realization of individualized automated measurement on the seeds, the seedlings and the organs of the seedlings. This system handle seedling crossing, through the original use of anisotropic diffusion, which allowed us to multiply, without information loss, the output by ten. Furthermore, this system carries out the separation of the organs by means of a generic criterion based on gravitropism. The validation of the image processing algorithms of the vision system use original ways (numerical simulation and test of the influence of the uncertainty through agronomic simulation). Thermographic imaging, which captures the passive heat radiation of objects, allows us to visualize and to measure seeds and seedlings in the darkness. It also allows realizing the segmentation and the tracking of the organs of seedlings. This imaging technology also allowed us to demonstrate the feasibility of a non-destructive <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>sugar</b> quantity in organs of beet seedlings. We then propose a generic methodology that allows the conception of spectrally optimized low-cost sensors, according to determined application tasks. This methodology uses information theory, to extract from, relatively expensive, hyperspectral imaging, the information needed for the conception of the dedicated low-cost sensors. The interest of this methodology for plant phenotyping has been shown and justifies its transfer to the world of research in plant biology...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{characterize}} the influence of nut composition on quality, seventeen cultivars grown in Viterbo were analysed in 2000 - 2001. Quantitative and qualitative <b>determinations</b> <b>of</b> <b>sugars,</b> organic acids, lipids and vitamins were carried out. Total polyphenols in the pellicle and in the seed were measured. The sensory profiles of six cultivars (‘Tonda Gentile delle Langhe’, ‘Tonda di Giffoni’, ‘Tonda Gentile Romana’, ‘Mortarella’, ‘Nocchione’ and ‘Tombul’) were examined. Fatty acid composition and level of tocopherolic and non tocopherolic antioxidant confirmed the nutritional and dietetic value of the nuts. Polyphenols were mainly concentrated in the perisperm. Sensory analysis was able to reveal varietal differences for attributes related to taste and flavour. A positive relationship between sweetness scores and sugar concentration was observed...|$|R
