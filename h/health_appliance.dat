ISO/IEEE 11073 family defines standards for device communication between agents (e. g. blood pressure monitors, weighing scales) that collect information about a person and manager (e. g., cell phone, <b>health</b> <b>appliance,</b> or personal computer) for collection, display, and possible later re-transmission. The particular draft standard ISO/IEEE P 11073 - 20601 defines protocols for data exchange between agents and managers. Although such a system in medical use must be extremely reliable under all circumstances, until now a formal analysis has been used only in analyzing draft IEEE P 11073 - 20601 {{as a part of}} developing the protocols in this family of standards. We analyzed the protocols both manually and automatically. For the automated analysis of safety properties we applied model-checking techniques, which is feasible since the number of processes is limited, and because we can abstract from most data in the protocols. We used the language Promela and the tool Spin, since this combination has a good reputation in practical applications and it is well documented. The results of our work are now incorporated in this standard...|$|E

40|$|Solar {{photovoltaic}} {{is strongly}} proven for cutting down greenhouse gases emissions and environmental destruction {{problems that the}} world is facing today due to the use of non-renewable energy sources. Tanzania considered in this study is also experiencing these challenges with imbalance and unreliable electrical power supply more precisely in health facilities. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate and evaluate ways solar photovoltaic (PV) can be used to improve reliability of existing power supply in health facilities in Tanzania. This research adopts an exploratory case study approach with a qualitative method for collecting and analysing the data. The case chosen was Kolandoto Hospital- Tanzania. The methods used for collecting data are measurement, participatory observation, participatory workshops, interview and documentation. The empirical findings have been analysed and used in calculations of the solar PV components that can be integrated in existing power system. The modelling of hybrid of solar PV and existing power system is carried out by use of HOMER software to get the optimal size of solar PV components. The results show that solar PV with backup system interconnected with power grid and diesel generator is feasible, and it provides solutions to energy security problems at Kolandoto hospital. Appropriately configuration is designed and proposed for selected emergency <b>health</b> <b>appliances</b> considered as critical loads in this report. The use of energy efficiency devices, replacement of old electrical equipments and exploitation of thermal solar for heating purposes are recommended to support the proposed solar PV system and to reduce further the electricity bills.

40|$|Sleep apnea is {{a serious}} sleep disorder, and {{the most common type}} is obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Untreated OSA will cause lots of {{potential}} <b>health</b> problems. Oral <b>appliance</b> therapy is an effective and popular approach for OSA treatment, but making a perfect fit for each patient is time-consuming and decreases its efficiency considerably. This paper proposes a System-on-a-Chip (SoC) enabled sleep monitoring system in a smart oral appliance, which is capable of intelligently collecting the physiological data about tongue movement through the whole therapy. A tunneling sensor array with an ultra-high sensitivity is incorporated to accurately detect the subtle pressure from the tongue. When the device is placed on the wireless platform, the temporary stored data will be retrieved and wirelessly transmitted to personal computers and cloud storages. The battery will be recharged by harvesting external RF power from the platform. A compact prototype module, whose size is 4. 5 × 2. 5 × 0. 9 cm 3, is implemented and embedded inside the oral appliance to demonstrate the tongue movement detection in continuous time frames. The functions of this design are verified by the presented measurement results. This design aims to increase efficiency and make it a total solution for OSA treatment...|$|R
40|$|Demineralizations around {{orthodontic}} brackets are a main disadvantage of orthodontic treatment. Several {{methods have been}} advocated to prevent their development, such as fluoride rinses or varnishes. In this randomized clinical trial, a fluoride rinse (a combination of sodium fluoride and amine fluoride) was compared with a placebo rinse, to be used every evening after toothbrushing. A total of 81 participants (mean age: 13. 3 yr) completed the study (mean treatment period: 24. 5 months). Demineralizations, measured using quantitative light-induced fluorescence and the decayed, missing, and filled surfaces (DMFS) index, were assessed before treatment (baseline) and around 6 wk after debonding (post treatment). Bleeding scores were measured at baseline, and during and post treatment. The incidence rate ratio for demineralizations was 2. 6 (95 % CI: 1. 1 - 6. 3) {{in the placebo group}} vs. the fluoride group. In the fluoride group, 31 % of participants developed at least one demineralization, compared with 47 % in the placebo group. Relative to baseline, gingival bleeding increased significantly in the placebo group 1 yr after the start of treatment and onwards. For the fluoride group, bleeding scores during treatment were not different from those at baseline. In conclusion, using a fluoride rinse helps to maintain better oral <b>health</b> during fixed <b>appliance</b> treatment, resulting in fewer demineralizations...|$|R
40|$|The {{report shows}} that Australians {{generally}} have {{good health and}} are privileged to {{have a range of}} health care services available to them. There are stark exceptions to this that can be confronting—even if well-known already—notably the generally much poorer health status of Indigenous Australians. Health care service provider and funding arrangements are both increasingly complex and increasingly costly to both individuals and taxpayers. A continuing challenge is how to balance both the complementary and competitive perspectives of government and non-government agencies, professional groups, and small businesses. Overall, national expenditure on health was 9. 7 % of GDP in 2003 – 04; and average health expenditure per person has grown by an average 3. 8 % each year between 1997 – 98 to 2002 – 03. Expenditure on aids and <b>appliances,</b> <b>health</b> research and pharmaceuticals contributed more to this growth than other areas.

40|$|Introduction : Patients {{undergoing}} {{orthodontic treatment}} with fixed appliances have a challenging oral hygiene situation because brackets tenaciously trap {{food and other}} oral debris. Good plaque control {{is an important factor}} in the maintenance of dental <b>health</b> during fixed <b>appliance</b> therapy. Many different types of specially designed toothbrushes have been developed in recent years in order to improve the plaque removal. One of these new developments is a manual triple headed brush which is called ′superbrush′ which is intended to clean the oral, buccal and occlusal surfaces of the teeth at one time. A clinical study was planned to evaluate the effectiveness of plaque removal by using the new triple headed toothbrush compared to the conventional manual toothbrush and an orthodontic toothbrush. Methods : A total of 75 patients, aged between 18 and 28 years, were equally divided into three groups: Group I (triple headed toothbrush), group II (orthodontic toothbrush) and group III (conventional toothbrush). The gingival index (Loe and Silness, 1963) and plaque index (Turesky Gilmore and Glickman, 1962) were recorded at baseline, month 1, month 2, month 3 and month 4, and results were subjected to statistical analysis utilizing ANOVA one way and multiple comparison Tukey′s HSD test. Results : Comparison of the mean gingival and plaque index scores and difference in mean plaque scores between the groups was done and found to be statistically significant (p < 0. 05). Conclusion : The study indicated that the triple headed toothbrush was more efficient in reduction of plaque scores and improvement in gingival index scores overall, and more effective in removal of plaque from tooth surfaces compared to the other two toothbrushes...|$|R
40|$|In 2007, Delft University of Technology {{celebrates its}} 165 th birthday. This unique {{occasion}} is celebrated with several activities revolving around the subject "Sustainable Solutions, {{with a focus}} on Africa". For the interdisciplinary course "Technical Universities and Sustainable development of Africa" a group of eight students under supervision of prof. Ir. C. A. J. Duijvestein and drs. ing. G. de Vries of Delft University of Technology attempted to find an answer to the question: "What can technical universities contribute to sustainable development, especially with regard to Africa?" This report contains the results of this course. Its goal is to create more awareness for the students of Delft University of Technology and their employees on the sustainable development of Africa. First, global models like the Millennium goals, the Ecological Footprint, the Environmental Sustainability Index and the Environmental Performance Index were researched in order to find keystones for answering this question. In what way do these models take technology development into account? Which topics would be interesting for technical universities? Do the models just analyze or do they also give solutions for improvements? Generally, there are two classes of models: The analytic model, which looks at the past and the current situation, and the objective based model, which sets goals for the future and the way to get there. For example, the Environmental Sustainability Index (ESI) and the Environmental Performance Index (EPI) are true analytic models whereas the Millennium Development Goals model is an objective based one. The objective models give technical universities a much clearer direction on which they should focus in the future. Besides, engineers work better with goals, because they are trained in solution thinking. The analytic models are used mostly to analyze the development of the objective models and check whether they give a positive result. The target of all models is to increase understanding of a difficult theme and analyse it on a country level. These models and the data they are based on will give the policy makers of these countries greater awareness of the positive and negative developments in their country. In a way they can be considered a kind of marketing tool to ask attention for a certain subject. The original goal of the models is not to create research assignments for technical universities; they are intended to give direction {{to the development of a}} country and bring about policy changes on a national level. Even though a lot of technical solutions lie on the local level, there are several returning global topics which are relevant to technical universities. - Water management Technical universities can look into solutions to guarantee both proper water quality and quantity, therefore preventing water stress. Research should cover the access to clean drinking water, good sanitation and sustainable irrigation for the inhabitants as well as reducing the water use by industrial processes. - Energy Where energy is concerned, topics found in the models are the reduction of primary energy usage, the reduction of energy usage of products and the development of renewable energy sources. Technical universities can research these problems and help define solutions. - Food Technical universities can search for methods to increase the crop yield per unit of surface. - Health Although health does not look like a topic befitting a technical university, it is possible that technical solutions could be given for solving health problems. Examples are guaranteeing a good indoor climate, developing good <b>health</b> care <b>appliances</b> or increasing the life expectancy of people by improving sanitation measures and other means.
