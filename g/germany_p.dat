50|$|The great {{cormorant}} {{is a large}} black bird, {{but there is a}} wide variation in size in the species wide range. Weight is reported to vary from 1.5 kg to 5.3 kg. Males are typically larger and heavier than females, with the nominate race (P. c. carbo) averaging about 10% larger in linear measurements than the smallest race in Europe (P. c. sinensis). The lightest average weights cited are in <b>Germany</b> (<b>P.</b> c. sinensis), where 36 males averaged 2.28 kg and 17 females averaged 1.94 kg. The highest come from Prince Edward Island in Canada (P. c. carbo), where 11 males averaged 3.68 kg and 11 females averaged 2.94 kg. Length can vary from 70 to 102 cm and wingspan from 121 to 160 cm. They are tied as the second largest extant species of cormorant after the flightless cormorant, with the Japanese cormorant averaging at a similar size. In bulk if not in linear dimensions, the Blue-eyed shag species complex of the Southern Oceans are scarcely smaller at average. It has a longish tail and yellow throat-patch. Adults have white patches on the thighs and on the throat in the breeding season. In European waters it can be distinguished from the common shag by its larger size, heavier build, thicker bill, lack of a crest and plumage without any green tinge. In eastern North America, it is similarly larger and bulkier than double-crested cormorant, and the latter species has more yellow on the throat and bill and lack the white thigh patches frequently seen on {{great cormorant}}s. Great cormorants are mostly silent, but they make various guttural noises at their breeding colonies.|$|E
50|$|The World NGO Day {{initiative}} {{was founded in}} 2009 by university student Marcis Liors Skadmanis, aged just 24. Inspired by the thesis he was writing {{as part of his}} master’s degree, he believed that such an initiative had the potential to help create a better future for all. Convinced that innovation was the key to a more sustainable future, he was keen to utilise his passion for developing new solutions for global problems to make a platform that would benefit each of us, {{in the form of an}} international day. Each country of the Baltic Sea NGO Network is encouraged to celebrate World NGO Day, providing information to the Baltic Sea Co-ordinating Committee. X. Baltic Sea NGO Forum, The German Presidency of the CBSS - Final Statement, 23-25 April 2012, Berlin, <b>Germany,</b> <b>p.</b> 3. World NGO Day was officially recognised by the Baltic Sea NGO Forum of the Council of the Baltic Sea States on the 17th April 2010. It was proposed by Ms Rasma Pipike, the member of the Baltic Sea NGO Forum's Committee and Director of Civic Alliance-Latvia. The member countries of the Baltic Sea NGO Forum were Belarus, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Russia, Norway and Sweden. World NGO Day was thereafter officially adopted into Baltic Sea NGO Forum's Final Statement Resolution of X, on the 23rd April 2012, German CBSS Presidency of the Council of the Baltic Sea States. Taking place at Humboldt University in Berlin, the event was attended not only by the Council itself, but also representatives of the German government, the European Commission, and the Baltic Development Forum, as well as representatives of Belarusian NGOs and the Black Sea NGO Network, every one of them inspired by the principles behind it and keen to embrace them.|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveIn an international, prospective, {{observational}} study, we contrasted adverse vascular outcomes {{among four}} countries and then assessed practice pattern differences {{that may have}} contributed to these outcomes. MethodsA total of 5065 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery were analyzed at 70 international medical centers, and from this pool, 3180 patients from the 4 highest enrolling countries were selected. Fatal and nonfatal postoperative ischemic complications related to the heart, brain, kidney, and gastrointestinal tract were assessed by blinded investigators. ResultsIn-hospital mortality was 1. 5 % (9 / 619) in the United Kingdom, 2. 0 % (9 / 444) in Canada, 2. 7 % (34 / 1283) in the United States, and 3. 8 % (32 / 834) in <b>Germany</b> (<b>P</b> =. 03). The rates of the composite outcome (morbidity and mortality) were 12 % in the United Kingdom, 16 % in Canada, 18 % in the United States, and 24 % in <b>Germany</b> (<b>P</b> <. 001). After adjustment for difference in case-mix (using the European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation) and practice, country was not an independent predictor for mortality. However, there was an independent effect of country on composite outcome. The practices that were associated with adverse outcomes were the intraoperative use of aprotinin, intraoperative transfusion of fresh-frozen plasma or platelets, lack of use of early postoperative aspirin, and use of postoperative heparin. ConclusionsSignificant between-country differences in perioperative outcome exist and appear to be related to hematologic practices, including administration of antifibrinolytics, fresh-frozen plasma, platelets, heparin, and aspirin. Understanding the mechanisms for these observations and selection of practices associated with improved outcomes may result in significant patient benefit...|$|E
