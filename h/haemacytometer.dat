40|$|A {{proportion}} of peritoneal leukocytes from CBA mice adhered to glass <b>haemacytometer</b> surfaces and withstood a gentle washing. This proportion was reduced with cells taken from mice sensitized to a methylcholanthrene‐induced tumour, when the specific tumour antigen was {{added in the}} form of a soluble extract. The reaction of leukocyte adherence inhibition (LAI) may have an immunological basis similar to that of macrophage migration inhibition, but LAI is a much simpler procedure. Leukocytes were active in LAI when taken from animals bearing tumours and after tumour removal. When serum from mice bearing a particular tumour was added to sensitized leukocytes in the presence of the specific tumour antigen, the inhibition of adherence was substantially relieved or blocked. LAI could thus be used to demonstrate both cellmediated immunity to tumours and blocking factors in serum by a brief, simple procedure. A potential application to human tumour immunology is indicated. Copyrigh...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to observe the {{cytotoxicity}} and apoptotic effects of nickel oxide nanoparticles on human cervix epithelioid carcinoma cell line (HeLa). Nickel oxide precursors were synthesized by an nickel sulphate-excess urea reaction in boiling aqueous solution. The synthesized NiO nanoparticles (< 200 nm) were investigated by X-ray diffraction analysis and transmission electron microscopy techniques. For cytotoxicity experiments, HeLa cells were incubated in 50 - 500 Îźg/mL NiO for 2, 6, 12 and 16 hours. The viable cells were counted with a <b>haemacytometer</b> using light microscopy. The cytotoxicity was observed low in 50 - 200 Îźg/mL concentration for 16 h, but high in 400 - 500 Îźg/mL concentration for 2 - 6 h. HeLa cells' cytoplasm membrane was lysed and detached from the well surface in 400 Îźg/mL concentration NiO nanoparticles.

40|$|Numerous {{studies have}} been {{conducted}} on ballast water species composition and diversity in other countries but not in the Philippines. Thus, this study aimed to provide baseline information on the plankton diversity in ballast water of the inter-island passenger-cargo vessel calling the ports of Iloilo-Bacolod-Manila Cagayan de Oro, Philippines and vice-versa. Specifically, this study aimed to determine the presence of phytoplankton and zooplankton diversity and species density of this plankton measured in cells/ml using the <b>haemacytometer</b> technique. Composite sampling was employed having one liter of ballast water used per ballast tank. A total number of 15 genera of phytoplankton (diatom) and one genus of zooplankton were recorded. Chroococcus, Nannochloris and Protococcus had the highest cells/ml while Ankistrodesmus, Micromonas and Synedra had the lowest cells/ml. The most common phytoplankton observed in ballast tanks were Nannochloris and Protococcus. Neocalanus (copepod) was present in all ballast tanks except in ballast tank 1 (fore-peak). The phytoplankton and zooplankton composition was found to be non-invasive in nature showing its ubiquity in the marine environment.

30|$|Protoplasts of A. carbonarius {{were made}} from young {{mycelium}} harvested after overnight growth in YPD medium. The cell walls were degraded by 60 mg/ml of the commercial product Vino Taste Pro (Novozymes A/S) in protoplasting buffer (1.2 M MgSO 4, 50 mM Phosphate Buffer, pH 5.0) for approx. 4 hours. Protoplasts were filtered and purified from the mixture, suspended in STC buffer (1.0 M sorbitol, 50 mM Tris, 50 mM CaCl 2 pH 8.0) and counted with appropriate dilution folds in a <b>haemacytometer.</b> The final concentration of protoplasts for aliquots was adjusted to 2 × 107 /mL.

The parasites were inoculated in each tube containing the V-bouillon medium and different concentrations of drugs. After the incubation for 48 hours at 37 ℃, the numbers of active parasites were counted using Burker-Turk's <b>haemacytometer,</b> and the percentages of growthinhibition by the drugs were calculated by comparison with data in the control where no drug was added into the culture medium. The percentage data were transformed into Probit value to calculate a regression line for each strain and each drug. Then, 99. 9 % inhibiting dose (ID_) and 50 % inhibiting dose (ID_) of the drugs {{were obtained from the}} regression lines. Among the drugs tested carbarsone and pimaricin had rather higher ID_ and ID_, whereas trichomycin, piperanitrozole, metronidazole and nimovazole showed lower ID_ and ID_.

MOST MALIGNANT TUMIOURS in man and experimental animals possess characteristic antigens which permit differential imm-unoreactivity to be demonstrated (Hellstrom et al., 1971). A number of in vitro methods have been used to detect such reactivity, including cytotoxicity testing (Jagarlamoody et al., 1971), leucocyte migration inhibition (Bull et al., 1973), and lymphocyte transformation (Vainky et al., 1971).

40|$|AbstractMicroalga Haematococcus pluvialis is {{reported}} {{as a large}} producer of carotenoid. One of the carotenoids produced by the microalgae is astaxanthin {{that can be used}} as antioxidant. The astaxanthin is known as “the king of antioxidant”, reportedly 800 times stronger than Coenzyme Q 10 (CoQ 10), 75 times stronger than Alpha Lipoic Acid (ALA) and 6000 times stronger than Vitamin C. Research has discovered that astaxanthin absorbs more free radicals than any other antioxidants. It is also indicated for sun protection, exercising recovery and eye health. However, under normal condition, carotenoid and biomass of the microalgae are very low. Light stress treatment {{is reported}}ly able to enhance carotenoids in plants and presumably in microalgae. Therefore, this research aims to increase carotenoid and biomass of the microalga by using the combination of blue, red, and white with ultraviolet lights. The microalga H. pluvialis was cultured in Bold Basal medium for 14 days under irradiation of blue, red and white lamp (1500 lux) for 21 hours and irradiation of ultraviolet light (500 lux) for 3 hours. As a control, the microalga wascultured in Bold Basal medium under irradiation of white lamp (1500 lux) for 12 : 12 hours (dark and light cycle). Each treatment and control was repeated for three times. Its parameters were cell number, chlorophyll and carotenoid content. The number of cells was counted by <b>Haemacytometer</b> Neubauer 1 mm and chlorophyll, and carotenoids content were analyzed by spectrophotometry at absorbance of 700, 663, 645, and 478 nm. The combination of ultraviolet and blue light was the best treatment for increasing the total carotenoid and chlorophyll content since the total carotenoid content increased about 8 times of the control and the total chlorophyll content increased about 2 times of the control, they accounted for 5, 1 mg / L and 6, 55 mg / L, respectively. Meanwhile, the combination of ultraviolet and red light increased its biomass up to 1. 4 x 104 cell /ml which was about 2 times of the control...|$|E
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of seaweed extracts {{for the control}} of peach leaf curl (Taphrina deformans) on Red Diamond nectarines was compared with a copper fungicide and with two varieties of peach claimed resistant to peach leaf curl. Field and laboratory tests were undertaken. The peach varieties Winiata Gold and Gordon's Glory were tolerant to peach leaf curl under conditions of severe disease pressure. They were more effective than seaweed extracts in {{the control of the}} fungus. The seaweed extract, Seagro, did not control peach leaf curl disease on Red Diamond nectarines planted in a randomised complete block design in Palmerston North in 1987. No evidence of fungicidal properties was found in the second year of the study when there were eleven infection periods suitable for the leaf curl fungus. In this season both seaweed extract and copper oxychloride fungicide were ineffective. In laboratory experiments, the seaweed extracts Response, Ecklonia and Carpophyllum had no effect on T. deformans growth. In vitro, T. deformans grew well on a media of potato dextrose agar and 1 % peptone. Satisfactory growth was also obtained on whole potato extract but the ease of preparation of the commercial agar mix made it the best option for this study. T. deformans grew more slowly on malt agar and peptone and did not grow at all on Czapek media. Acidifying the PDA media to a pH of 3. 5 did not significantly affect T. deformans growth. Quick laboratory tests for comparison of fungal growth on different fungicide/seaweed extract amended PDA plates were compared. The measurement of light absorbance of cell suspensions with a spectrophotometer was quicker than counting cells using a <b>haemacytometer.</b> The petri dish zonal inhibition technique was useful for quantifying the {{effectiveness of}} some fungicides against T. deformans.

40|$|Dientamoeba fragilis is a {{protozoan}} parasite {{first described}} in 1918. It {{resides in the}} human large intestine. D. fragilis {{has been associated with}} diarrhoea and abdominal pain in some patients. An indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) assay was used to examine the presence of D. fragilis trophozoites in preserved faecal specimens. Antiserum to D. fragilis trophozoites was raised in a rabbit with a dixenic culture from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC 30948). After absorption with Klebsiella pneumoniae and Bacteroides vulgatus, the immune rabbit serum was used for IFA examination. A total of 155 clinical samples were tested: 42 with no parasites, 9 with D. fragilis and 104 with other parasites. The IFA assay detected D. fragilis in 7 / 9 known positive samples. There were no false-positive IFA readings. Monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) against the parasite was produced in mice and characterized. A MAb (8 B 2) was obtained against an antigen released when D. fragilis was frozen and thawed. MAb 8 B 2 reacted with cultured D. fragilis in indirect immunofluorescence but did not react with clinical D. fragilis strains and it did not immunoblot. Another MAb (1 H 11) was generated against a sodium acetate-acetic acid-formalin fixed antigen. It reacted with D. fragilis isolates in patient specimens and identified a D. fragilis 39 kDa protein. Susceptibility testing was performed on D. fragilis ATCC 30948. D. fragilis was cocultured with the bacteria in ATCC medium 1171. The activities of antiparasitic drugs were assessed by counting viable D. fragilis trophozoites with a <b>haemacytometer</b> by trypan blue exclusion. The minimal amoebicidal concentrations of the following four drugs were determined: iodoquinol at 128 μg/ml, paromomycin at 16 μg/ml, tetracycline (questionably) at 32 μg/ml, and metronidazole at 32 μg/ml. In this seroprevalence study sera from 3 symptomatic patients (F 10 y, M 12 y and F 16 y), 12 age and sex-matched controls, and 189 randomly-selected healthy individuals (age range 6 months to 19 years) were tested by an indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) assay for antibodies. All 3 symptomatic patients infected with D. fragilis gave positive IIF titres of 80, and all 12 matched controls were also positive (titre ranges from 20 to 160, geometric mean titer (GMT) was 48).

40|$|The {{growth of}} {{adherent}} animal cells (Madin Darby Canine Kidney, ECACC) on a microcarrier system (Cytodex 1, Amersham Biosciences) {{could be described}} by using a simple unstructured, non-segregated model. At first some necessary model parameters had be determined in different experiments or had be found in several publications. The literature query on the topic “modelling of the cell growth of MDCK cells” was not successful. Therefore, only parameters derived from the evaluation of own experiments were used. Additionally, a non-linear regression of parameters without constraints after the Nelder-Meads simplex algorithm was applied. Due to not satisfactory fits of the non-linear regression a manual variation of model parameters was applied. In addition to the optimization of parameters several experiments were performed to determine characteristics of the influenza vaccine process. The interactions between the cells and microcarriers were taken into account. Due to the determination of mass and geometric properties of a single living MDCK cell an estimation of the maximal biomass on one microcarrier and in the whole process was possible. However, when calculating the biomass in the process {{according to the data}} given by the microcarrier supplier values were too high compared to the measured values. An investigation of the used microcarrier system gave no final answer to the open question of the mass specific surface. Another aim of the thesis was the quantitative determination of the oxygen mass transfer into the medium and the oxygen uptake of the MDCK cells. Thus, the knowledge of the oxygen uptake rates allowed of an estimation of the living biomass concentration in the process using the known on-line signal of oxygen partial pressure (pO 2). The estimation of the lactate concentration using the on-line signal of sodium hydroxide consumption should be possible, too. Finally, the model simulation and the experimental data of a standard cultivation showed a good agreement for the substrates (glucose and glutamine), for the metabolites (lactate and ammonia) and also for the consumption of sodium hydroxide. A good fit for the biomass in the process could not be obtained with the model. Thus, the indirect determination of cell numbers in the process through evaluation of trends of metabolites - the main goal of the work – was not achieved. This could be due to an inhomogen sample taking. In the future a modified method of the direct determination of cell numbers using a <b>haemacytometer</b> for immobilized cell cultures could overcome the actual scattering of the biomass data. The modification is a new reference value for the cell numbers. In place of living cells per mL the new unit could be living cells per cm 2 or living cells per microcarrier. In this way changes of conditions during sample taking could be compensated. But the new reference value of the biomass requires the determination of the microcarrier concentration in the sample. Further the knowledge about the properties of the used microcarrier system is also essential, especially mean diameter of microcarriers and the mass specific surface or the mass specific particle number for a monodispersed particle system. Additionally, the assumption of qualitative equal cell coverage on microcarriers between bioreactor and sample is necessary...|$|E
