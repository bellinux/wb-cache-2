40|$|This policy brief {{presents}} {{a number of}} scenarios to illustrate {{the impact on the}} budget from the Emissions Reduction Fund and removing the carbon price. Summary The Government proposes to remove the current legislated carbon price and replace it with its taxpayer-funded Emissions Reduction Fund (ERF). Over the four years of forward estimates, this is projected to have a negative fiscal impact of over $ 15 billion. To 2020, the negative impact grows to over $ 24 billion if ERF expenditure is capped. It reaches over $ 40 billion if pollution reduction targets are to be reached and if the Government doesn’t amend its position of purchasing only Australian emission reductions for its minimum target commitment. This multibillion dollar hit on the budget stems from two sources: 	Emissions  Reduction Fund: Over the forward estimates, the Government has indicated it would spend $ 2. 55 billion of taxpayer funds to subsidise emission reduction activities. In the past, the Government has indicated that the scheme will be scaled up to an average $ 1. 2 billion a year. 	Loss of  carbon pricing revenue: The payment by major polluting companies of next year’s fixed carbon price and their subsequent purchase of carbon pollution permits under the emission trading scheme due to start in 2015 is a significant source of Government revenue. The current carbon laws conservatively raise over $ 18 billion to 2020. The budgetary impact form the loss of carbon revenue not only threatens funds now supporting clean energy, low emission programs, technology research and development, as well as support for households and business, but also affects broader choices. The Climate Institute has calculated the net fiscal hit under a number of scenarios, to illustrate the impact on the budget from the ERF and removing the carbon price. Under all budget constrained scenarios, <b>ERF</b> <b>funding</b> is assumed to follow the spending outlined in Coalition policy documents. These scenarios do not address the approximately $ 24 billion annual subsidy that the International Monetary Fund estimates Australian governments gives the coal, oil and gas industries...|$|E

All EU member states apart from Denmark participated in the <b>ERF.</b> The <b>Fund</b> financed both national and transnational projects, including providing skills and language training to refugees, improvements to reception facilities and refugee resettlement or relocation operations. The ERF was allocated €630 million in funding over the period 2008-13. It {{was set up in}} 2000, replacing previous ad hoc funding measures. In April 2014, the ERF, along with the European Integration Fund and the European Return Fund, was replaced by the Asylum Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF) established for the period 2014-20.|$|R

40|$|The Early Reading First (ERF) program {{provided}} {{grants to}} transform preschools into cen-ters of education excellence {{with the ultimate}} goal of preventing later reading difficulties (No Child Left Behind Act of 2001). The intent of ERF grants was to provide preschoolers with the necessary cognitive, early language, and literacy skills for success in kindergarten (United States Department of Education, 2007). Programs that received <b>ERF</b> <b>funds</b> were required to monitor children’s progress in specific literacy and language skills (i. e., automatic recognition of alphabet letters, knowledge of the conventions of print, understanding of phonemes and letters, and use of increasingly complex vocabulary) and to identify children who may be “at risk. ” However, ERF failed to provide guidelines for monitoring progress or definitions of at risk. In this article, we explore an alternative approach to identifying children as at risk in preschool using data from the third year of Project EXEL, a 2002 ERF project. Our study developed a set of benchmarks for end-of-year preschool accomplishments in the areas of alphabet recognition, concepts about print, phonemic awareness and alphabetic principle, and vocabulary development. We also explored how these benchmarks might be used with monitoring assessments to identify preschoolers who may not be making satisfactory progress toward expected end-of-the-year performance.

50|$|The {{funding for}} the {{establishment}} of the URVT came originally from the European Council decision to establish the European Refugee <b>Fund</b> (<b>ERF)</b> II for 2005-2010. Cyprus has been participating in the ERF since 2004, with the Asylum Service being appointed as the responsible authority for its implementation. The national program for the implementation of the ERF is mainly focused on actions in the areas of reception of asylum seekers and integration of persons enjoying a form of international protection (including refugees) currently residing in Cyprus.|$|R

30|$|Both New Zealand and Australia {{have been}} early movers {{in terms of}} the {{implementation}} of domestic carbon market based schemes with mixed results in terms of promoting new plantings. In Australia, this has included the New South Wales Greenhouse Gas Reduction Scheme (GGAS) and the Carbon Farming Initiative, the latter which links as a land crediting mechanism to the national Emissions Reduction <b>Fund</b> (<b>ERF).</b> The ERF is a reverse auction market mechanism to buy low-cost emission reduction activities in the Australian economy, with the Australian Government initially allocating $ 1.55 billion to the Fund over a three year period commencing 1 July 2014 (Commonwealth of Australia 2013).|$|R

The centrepiece of the Commonwealth Government’s climate policies is the Emissions Reduction <b>Fund</b> (<b>ERF).</b> Various commentators and policy analysts have proposed transforming this into a baseline-and- credit scheme, a type of emissions trading scheme.

Together they form the 3 R Mechanism (Relief, Recovery and Reconciliation) in Haiti.

This article seeks {{to account for}} the recent establishment of the European refugee <b>fund</b> (<b>ERF),</b> and assess its effectiveness in ‘promoting a balance of efforts in receiving and bearing the consequences of displaced persons’. It argues that the decision to create the ERF can be interpreted as an act of partly solidaristic, but mostly symbolic, EU politics. The ERF’s redistributive rules are characterized by a side-payment logic in which countries that possess the greatest potential (or most credible threat) to cause difficulties in other areas of EU policy-making are most influential {{when it comes to the}} distribution of EU spoils. While this logic can facilitate moves towards further integration, it undermines the achievement of the EU’s redistributive objectives...|$|R
30|$|In Denmark and Greece, {{policies}} concerning housing {{are made}} centrally {{at the nation}} state level. Denmark is {{not a part of}} CEAS and has not fully implemented council directives on the reception, qualification, and asylum procedure. The Immigration Service (a sub-institution of the Ministry of Justice) is responsible for the asylum procedure and housing. It contracts the Danish Red Cross or communes to manage refugee accommodation. In Greece, administrative responsibilities appear to be complicated. Particularly since 2013, it has implemented EU laws creating a stronger legal framework concerning reception and care. The Ministries of Citizen Protection, Migration Policy, and Labour, together with the Greek navy and military are responsible for the management of housing. Often one of these runs the camps directly, or contracts are given to NGOs, which are financed through the European Refugee <b>Fund</b> (<b>ERF).</b> UNHCR and the EU have also initiated an accommodation project, in support of the Greek authorities’ efforts to expand reception capacity since 2014.|$|R

40|$|Emissions {{reductions}} can {{be promoted}} through regulatory measures but most economists support placing {{a price on}} carbon as a complementary and, possibly, more effective measure. A pricing measure typically {{takes the form of}} either (or both) a carbon tax or an emissions trading scheme (ETS). Whilst both measures have their advantages and disadvantages an ETS might be preferred {{on the basis of the}} ability to set caps and link with other schemes. A number of ETSs are now operating around the globe but there is no one template. This paper will compare the different approaches adopted by the Californian and Tokyo ETSs with the Australian regime that operated for two years from 2012 until 2014 and the so-called emissions reduction <b>fund</b> (<b>ERF)</b> that replaced it. It will be demonstrated that fundamental points of difference reflected by these alternative arrangements are the extent to which the regimes focus on domestic rather than global emissions reductions and the primacy given to the market. The ETSs can also be contrasted to the voluntary nature of the ERF, at least as currently enacted, and how that system seeks to reward responsive businesses whilst the ETSs penalise non-responsive entities...|$|R
40|$|The Rangeland Journal – Climate Clever Beef {{special issue}} {{examines}} {{options for the}} beef industry in northern Australia {{to contribute to the}} reduction in global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and to engage in the carbon economy. Relative to its gross value (A$ 5 billion), the northern beef industry is responsible for a sizable proportion of national reportable GHG emissions (8 – 10 %) through enteric methane, savanna burning, vegetation clearing and land degradation. The industry occupies large areas of land and has the potential to impact the carbon cycle by sequestering carbon or reducing carbon loss. Furthermore, much of the industry is currently not achieving its productivity potential, which suggests that there are opportunities to improve the emissions intensity of beef production. Improving the industry’s GHG emissions performance is important for its environmental reputation and may benefit individual businesses through improved production efficiency and revenue from the carbon economy. The Climate Clever Beef initiative collaborated with beef businesses in six regions across northern Australia to better understand the links between GHG emissions and carbon stocks, land condition, herd productivity and profitability. The current performance of businesses was measured and alternate management options were identified and evaluated. Opportunities to participate in the carbon economy through the Australian Government’s Emissions Reduction <b>Fund</b> (<b>ERF)</b> were also assessed. The initiative achieved significant producer engagement and collaboration resulting in practice change by 78 people from 35 businesses, managing more than 1   272   000  ha and 132   000 cattle. Carbon farming opportunities were identified that could improve both business performance and emissions intensity. However, these opportunities were not without significant risks, trade-offs and limitations particularly in relation to business scale, and uncertainty in carbon price and the response of soil and vegetation carbon sequestration to management. This paper discusses opportunities for reducing emissions, improving emission intensity and carbon sequestration, and outlines the approach taken to achieve beef business engagement and practice change. The paper concludes with some considerations for policy makers...|$|R
40|$|Public Health Relevance: This {{evaluation}} {{seeks to}} analyze and discuss {{the effectiveness of a}} novel model of fundraising and grant management to aid in the resolution of a large epidemic. On March 23, 2014 the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the outbreak of Ebolavirus in Guinea, which continued to spread and overwhelm the neighboring countries Liberia and Sierra Leone. Ebolavirus is a hemorrhagic virus with a case fatality rate of 50 - 70 %. In September of 2015, the National Peace Corps Association (NPCA) formed the Ebola Relief <b>Fund</b> (<b>ERF)</b> in response to members’ desires to participate in the international relief effort. Between October and February, the ERF collected 100 proposals and awarded 25 grants, totaling approximately $ 75, 000. Presently, the ERF is midway through its operations having completed Round 1 programs, Round 2 programs are nearing completion, and funds were recently disbursed for Round 3. The objectives of this report are broadly to 1.) Assess the effectiveness of the ERF at soliciting high quality program proposals, as well as the impact of selected programs and 2.) To determine the future of ERF as the outbreak is being rapidly controlled. Qualitative reviews of participating organizations’ initial proposal critiques, mid-term reports, and final reports were conducted to assess overall quality of grants submitted, compliance with proposed funding requests, and success of funded programs. A comprehensive review of news articles published between the dates of February 1, 2015 and April 1, 2015 was conducted to make recommendations regarding the future direction of the ERF. The evaluation found that ERF had been able to elicit proposals of sufficient quality to warrant funding and the organizations were highly compliant and successful in the delivery of their programs. Moving forward the ERF should consider changing the criteria used to select grants. If grants will continue to be awarded in the future to assist in the Ebola effort, applicants should only be limited to parts of Guinea and Sierra Leone still fighting the outbreak. A better use of funds may be to invest in longer term development efforts in the three countries to assist with recovery from the epidemic...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} effect of using {{regional}} data for livestock attributes on estimation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for the northern beef industry in Australia, compared with using state/territory-wide values, as currently used in Australia’s national GHG inventory report. Regional GHG emissions associated with beef production are reported for 21 defined agricultural statistical regions within state/territory jurisdictions. A management scenario for reduced emissions that could qualify as an Emissions Reduction <b>Fund</b> (<b>ERF)</b> project was used to illustrate {{the effect of}} regional level model parameters on estimated abatement levels. Using regional parameters, instead of state level parameters, for liveweight (LW), LW gain and proportion of cows lactating and an expanded number of livestock classes, gives a 5. 2 % reduction in estimated emissions (range + 12 % to – 34 % across regions). Estimated GHG emissions intensity (emissions per kilogram of LW sold) varied across the regions by up to 2. 5 -fold, ranging from 10. 5  kg CO 2 -e kg– 1  LW sold for Darling Downs, Queensland, through to 25. 8  kg CO 2 -e kg– 1  LW sold for the Pindan and North Kimberley, Western Australia. This range was driven by differences in production efficiency, reproduction rate, growth rate and survival. This suggests that some regions in northern Australia {{are likely to have}} substantial opportunities for GHG abatement and higher livestock income. However, this must be coupled with the availability of management activities that can be implemented to improve production efficiency; wet season phosphorus (P) supplementation being one such practice. An ERF case study comparison showed that P supplementation of a typical-sized herd produced an estimated reduction of 622 t CO 2 -e year– 1, or 7 %, compared with a non-P supplemented herd. However, the different model parameters used by the National Inventory Report and ERF project means that there was an anomaly between the herd emissions for project cattle excised from the national accounts (13   479  t CO 2 -e year– 1) and the baseline herd emissions estimated for the ERF project (8   896  t CO 2 -e year– 1) before P supplementation was implemented. Regionalising livestock model parameters in both ERF projects and the national accounts offers the attraction of being able to more easily and accurately reflect emissions savings from this type of emissions reduction project in Australia’s national GHG accounts...|$|R
40|$|The Climate Institute {{requested}} SKM MMA and Centre of Policy Studies (CoPS) {{to undertake}} {{an assessment of}} alternative policy options to achieve a given carbon emission target in Australia. The focus {{of the study was}} to compare outcomes under a suite of subsidy based policies to the outcomes under an emission trading scheme. The outcomes of the study are presented in this report. There are several market based approaches that could be used to achieve a carbon emission target. Which approach is more or less effective in achieving the target will depend on any restriction placed on the measure, the ability of each approach to manage the uncertainties on the cost and future scale of abating carbon emissions, the long term behavioural signals provided and the relative impacts on the broader economy. In principle, a subsidy scheme, such as the proposed Emission Reduction <b>Fund</b> (<b>ERF),</b> could achieve the same level of abatement at a similar cost to an emission trading scheme provided the sectoral coverage was the same and the eligible abatement options were the same. Any difference in effectiveness and cost may be due to other factors such as a limit on the budget available to be spent through the subsidy scheme and differences in sectoral coverage. Whether projects receiving funding under the subsidy scheme will proceed or go under either before they are built or after a few years of operation, as has happened under other subsidy scheme, is also important to the effectiveness of the scheme. SKM MMA used a marginal abatement cost approach to assess the options chosen under the subsidy fund. The approach was used to assess a range of emissions abatement opportunities in a range of sectors covering energy, transport, agriculture and land use change, industrial processes, fugitive emissions, and waste. The approach involved the assessment of the cost and potential emission abatement of the eligible options. The assumption was that the lowest cost combination of options is selected under the fund to meet the abatement cap up to any budget or other declared constraints. Only options that are additional (i. e. would not have proceeded in absence of the fund or carbon abatement incentive) were considered. The estimated level of abatement by options and their cost are input into CoPS’s Monash Multi Regional Forecasting Model (MMRF) to determine broader economic impacts. This report outlines the assumptions and method used and discusses the result of the modelling. Limitations and uncertainties in the approach are also outlined. The focus of the analysis was on potential impacts – there is no discussion on which approach is more efficient...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY The Authority is {{required}} by legislation to review the Carbon Farming Initiative (CFI) every three years; this is its first review. The review has benefited from consultations with stakeholders {{from a range of}} sectors and the Authority thanks those who contributed. When introduced in 2011, the CFI was designed to complement the carbon pricing mechanism. Accordingly, it focused on sectors not covered by the carbon price, namely: agriculture, waste (in part), and land use, land use change and forestry. CFI projects earned credits that could be sold to entities with liabilities under the carbon pricing mechanism. The carbon price has since been repealed, and the CFI has been expanded to form the Emissions Reduction <b>Fund</b> (<b>ERF)</b> and now covers all sectors of the economy. The ERF is the central plank of the government’s Direct Action Plan to reduce Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions. It has been introduced through amendments to the Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Act 2011 (Cth), which brings it within the scope of this review. For simplicity’s sake, this report refers to the CFI as the scheme as originally configured, and the ERF as the scheme as approved by the parliament in November 2014. Under the ERF, the government will purchase emissions reductions through auctions (and possibly other means). Fixed-price contracts, typically for seven years, will be offered to those who are successful at auction. Other changes to streamline the scheme are also being introduced, and a safeguard mechanism (that will discourage large emitters from increasing their emissions above historical levels) is to commence in July 2016. While these changes are substantial, the ERF retains an essential characteristic of the CFI in that it credits projects for reducing emissions below a defined baseline, and the baseline reflects what would have been expected to occur {{in the absence of the}} scheme. The changes to the CFI are important for this review in two ways. First, as the scheme is being expanded to become the central element of Australia’s policy to reduce emissions and meet its targets, the lessons to be gleaned from its operation to date will be of interest in assessing the likely performance of the ERF. Second, as this review follows closely on the policy development process for the ERF, care has been taken not to duplicate that process, but to focus instead on the extent to which the design of the ERF addresses problems identified with the CFI, as well as other challenges that may arise...|$|R
