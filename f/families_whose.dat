5|$|In {{the days}} after Chanchu moved through the Philippines, then-President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo ordered that the country's National Disaster Coordinating Council help all towns {{affected}} by the storm. The agency helped coordinate search and rescue missions. Several areas were {{declared a state of}} calamity, mostly on Mindoro, Samar, and Batangas. The Tzu Chi Foundation visited islands in eastern Samar, providing money to the <b>families</b> <b>whose</b> houses were destroyed. Towns in the region also assisted by supplying thatch to rebuild homes. In Oriental Mindoro, the Philippine Red Cross provided food and relief items to families in Calapan. The Adventist Development and Relief Agency also provided building materials for 200families in Mindoro. Ultimately, the government provided storm victims with ₱415.1million (PHP, $7.6million USD) worth of relief supplies. Rainfall from the storm caused a red tide in Taal Lake, after dispersing a Ceratium bloom.|$|E
5|$|Robie Mortin {{came forward}} as a {{survivor}} during this time; {{she was the}} only one added to the list who could prove she lived in Rosewood in 1923, totaling nine survivors who were compensated. Gaining compensation changed some <b>families,</b> <b>whose</b> members began to fight among themselves. Some descendants refused it, while others went into hiding to avoid the press of friends and relatives who came asking for handouts. Some descendants, after dividing the funds among siblings, received not much more than $100 each. Later, the Florida Department of Education set up the Rosewood Family Scholarship Fund for Rosewood descendants and ethnic minorities.|$|E
5|$|The work {{caused a}} scandal in contemporary, still-partitioned Poland; it was {{discussed}} even before its unveiling. It offended {{a number of}} society figures, many tracing direct lineage to the major magnate <b>families</b> <b>whose</b> members are portrayed in the painting as traitors to the Polish cause. There {{were a number of}} critical reviews of the work in the contemporary press, Matejko received anonymous threats, and some aristocrats are said to have considered buying the painting only to destroy it. Some accused him of defeatism, pessimism, exploiting public sentiment over a historical scandal for contemporary publicity; it was thus criticized by notable artists such as Józef Ignacy Kraszewski and Cyprian Norwid. In Paris, a French-Polish aristocrat, Count Alexandre Joseph Colonna-Walewski, campaigned against including it in an exhibition. The painting, however, quickly garnered supporters, who in turn reproduced modified copies of it, replacing historical figures with major contemporary critics. Responding to the public outcry, Matejko painted a response — a painting titled Judgement on Matejko (Wyrok na Matejkę, 1867), in which he portrayed his execution by some of his most vocal critics.|$|E
