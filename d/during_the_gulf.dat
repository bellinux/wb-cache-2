5|$|Following {{the success}} of the GR1B/T2B upgrade, the RAF {{launched}} a plan to upgrade its Jaguar fleet to a common standard, incorporating improvements introduced to some aircraft <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> War, together with adding the ability to use TIALD and new reconnaissance pods.

5|$|The Jaguar is an {{orthodox}} single-seat, swept-wing, twin-engine monoplane design, with tall tricycle-type retractable landing gear. In its original configuration, {{it had a}} maximum take-off weight in the 15 tonne class; and could manage a combat radius on internal fuel alone of , giving the Jaguar a greater operational range than competitor aircraft such as the Mikoyan MiG-27. The aircraft had hardpoints fitted for an external weapons load of up to 10,000lb (4,500kg), typical weapons fitted included the MATRA LR.F2 rocket pod, BAP 100-mm bombs, MATRA AS37 anti-radar missiles, AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles, and Rockeye cluster bombs.

5|$|America's Asian {{conflicts}} against Japan, North Korea, and North Vietnam brought Sun Tzu to {{the attention}} of American military leaders. The Department of the Army in the United States, through its Command and General Staff College, has directed all units to maintain libraries within their respective headquarters for the continuing education of personnel in the art of war. The Art of War is mentioned as an example of works to be maintained at each facility, and staff duty officers are obliged to prepare short papers for presentation to other officers on their readings. Similarly, Sun Tzu's Art of War is listed on the Marine Corps Professional Reading Program. <b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> War in the 1990s, both Generals Norman Schwarzkopf Jr. and Colin Powell employed principles from Sun Tzu related to deception, speed, and striking one's enemy's weak points. However, the United States and other Western countries have been criticised for not truly understanding Sun Tzu's work and not appreciating The Art of War within the wider context of Chinese society.|$|E
