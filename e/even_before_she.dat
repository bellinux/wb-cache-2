5|$|Prince of Wales was {{originally}} named King Edward VIII but upon the abdication of Edward VIII {{the ship was}} renamed <b>even</b> <b>before</b> <b>she</b> had been laid down. This occurred at Cammell Laird's shipyard in Birkenhead on 1 January 1937, {{although it was not}} until 3 May 1939 that she was launched. She was still fitting out when war was declared in September, causing her construction schedule, and that of her sister, , to be accelerated. Nevertheless, the late delivery of gun mountings caused delays in her outfitting.|$|E

In 1840, Leopold arranged the marriage of his niece, Queen Victoria, to his nephew, Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. <b>Even</b> <b>before</b> <b>she</b> succeeded to the throne, Leopold had been advising Victoria by letter, and continued to influence her after her accession.|$|E
25|$|The {{basic design}} of the new {{building}} was apparently successful, as <b>even</b> <b>before</b> <b>she</b> was completed SF Line's fellow Viking Line members Rederi AB Slite and Rederi Ab Sally asked access to the ship's plans {{so that they could}} order additional ships of the same design. However, in the end Slite opted to order a slightly larger vessel from Meyer Werft in Germany, while SF Line refused to give Sally access to the new ship's plans and as a result Sally too placed an order with Meyer Werft.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{the success}} of Rand's 1943 novel The Fountainhead, she had no trouble {{attracting}} a publisher for Atlas Shrugged. This was a contrast to her previous novels, which she had struggled to place. <b>Even</b> <b>before</b> <b>she</b> began writing it, she had been approached by publishers interested in her next novel. However, her contract for The Fountainhead gave the first option to its publisher, Bobbs-Merrill Company. After reviewing a partial manuscript, they asked her to discuss a number of cuts and other changes. She refused, and Bobbs-Merrill rejected the book.|$|E

500|$|Tess Harper was {{performing}} {{on stage in}} Texas when she attended a casting call for a minor role in the film. Beresford {{was so impressed with}} her that he cast her in the lead. He later said that the actresses he had seen before her demonstrated a sophistication and worldliness inappropriate for the part, while she brought a kind of rural quality without coming across as simple or foolish. Beresford said of Harper, [...] "She walked into the room and <b>even</b> <b>before</b> <b>she</b> spoke, I thought, 'That's the girl to play the lead. Harper said she knew she won the role when Beresford appeared on her doorstep with a bottle of champagne in each hand.

When filming ended, Duvall gave her a blue cowgirl shirt as a gift with a card that read, [...] "You really were Rosa Lee".|$|E

When was asked about why she agreed to work with Aguilera, M.I.A. revealed, [...] "Other people were involved who I respect like Peaches and it was like a sea of women coming together to write this new thing. Christina had also had a baby, you know, so it was kind of an interesting situation". Aguilera's decision not to perform her [...] "trademark warbling" [...] while recording the song disappointed M.I.A., as she detailed in an interview with MTV News UK:I really thought I {{was going to be able}} to go in there and get her vocals on to the next level and she didn't want to do it. She was like 'You might think that's great because it's not what you do, but to me I'm really bored of it'. It's interesting getting to work with people who can do things vocally that you can't... but yeah I only heard the song for the first time when everyone else did.|$|E
500|$|Meagan Damore of Comic Book Resources said, [...] "There {{is nothing}} not to love about Ms. Marvel #1: every {{character}} is well formed and distinct; the story, lovingly crafted; the art, meticulously planned and—at times—downright funny." [...] Jen Aprahamian of Comic Vine said [...] "Ms. Marvel makes a delightful debut, showing confidence and heart <b>even</b> <b>before</b> <b>she</b> {{puts on a}} mask. Kamala is not your average superheroine and her stories seem like they're headed in an exciting direction. Kudos to Marvel for expanding its range; amping up the diversity factor {{in a way that}} doesn't feel token or temporary is a great move, and Ms. Marvel is launching with a solid first issue and a world—a universe, even—of story possibilities." [...] Joshua Yehl of IGN said, [...] "Ms. Marvel introduces a vibrant and troubled character that you can't help but love." [...] George Marston of Newsarama said, [...] "Ms. Marvel is a solid debut issue, and that in itself should be a victory not just for G. Willow Wilson and Adrian Alphona, but for Marvel Comics itself... It's not exactly edgy, and Kamala Khan is not exactly the first reluctant teen hero in Marvel's long history, but Ms. Marvel is one of the strongest debuts for a new character that Marvel has had in a long time." ...|$|E

2500|$|Due to the show's live factor, {{a number}} of {{technical}} problems, performer mishaps, intentional acts of sabotage by performers, protests, and cuts to dead air have occurred throughout the show's run. One incident that garnered widespread media coverage was the October 3, 1992, appearance by singer Sinéad O'Connor, in which she ripped up a photo of Pope John Paul II during her performance.

But it produced no impression on me then: I had no attention for anything but my approaching interview with Margaret. My life throbbed and burned within me, in that direction: it was all coldness, torpor, insensibility, in every other.|$|R
