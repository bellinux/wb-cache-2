40|$|The {{accurate}} {{determination of}} the quality parameters of crops requires a spectral range from 400  nm to 2500  nm (Kawamura et al., 2010, Thenkabail et al., 2002). Presently the hyperspectral imaging systems that cover this wavelength range consist of several separate hyperspectral imagers and the system weight is from 5 to 15  kg. In addition {{the cost of the}} Short Wave Infrared (SWIR) cameras is high (  50  k€). VTT has previously developed compact hyperspectral imagers for drones and Cubesats for Visible and Very near Infrared (VNIR) spectral ranges (Saari et al., 2013, Mannila et al., 2013, Näsilä et al., 2016). Recently VTT has started to develop a hyperspectral imaging system that will enable imaging simultaneously in the Visible, VNIR, and SWIR spectral bands. The system can be operated from a drone, on a camera stand, or attached to a tractor. The targeted main applications of the DroneKnowledge hyperspectral system are <b>grass,</b> <b>peas,</b> and cereals. In this paper the characteristics of the built system are shortly described. The system was used for spectral measurements of wheat, several <b>grass</b> species and <b>pea</b> plants fixed to the camera mount in the test fields in Southern Finland and in the green house. The wheat, <b>grass</b> and <b>pea</b> field measurements were also carried out using the system mounted on the tractor.

40|$|The {{spread of}} {{agriculture}} in the Iberian Peninsula is documented from at least ca. 5600 – 5500 BC, although botanical data are absent or very limited for large areas. Archaeobotanical information shows from the beginning an imported agrarian system with a great diversity of crops: hulled and naked wheats and barleys, legumes such as pea, lentil, fava bean, vetches and <b>grass</b> <b>peas,</b> flax and poppy. This diversity of plants with different requirements, processing and uses, implies that the first farmers quickly imported or acquired {{a wide range of}} agrarian knowledge. Regional and inter-site agrarian differences are discussed in relation to factors like ecology, culture, use of the cultivated plants and management of the risk of crop failure.

5000|$|Osteolathyrism is a {{collagen}} cross-linking deficiency {{brought on}} by dietary over-reliance on the seeds of Lathyrus sativus or <b>grass</b> <b>pea,</b> a legume often grown as a famine crop in Asia and East Africa. [...] Other members of the genus are also known to cause the disease, including L. sylvestris, L. cicera, and L. clymenum. L. sativus grows well under famine conditions, often severe drought, where it is cultivated. [...] The condition results in damage to bone and mesenchymal connective tissues. It is seen in people in combination with neurolathyrism and angiolathyrism in areas where famine demands reliance on a crop with known detrimental effects. It occurs in cattle and horses with diets overreliant upon the <b>grass</b> <b>pea.</b> Osteolathyrism {{is caused by a}} variety of osteolathyrogenic compounds, specifically excitatory amino-compounds. The most widely-studied of these compounds is beta-aminopropionitrile (BAPN), which exerts its deleterious effect by an unknown yet potently irreversible mechanism. Other instigators are ureides, semicarbazides and thiosemicarbazides, which are believed to chelate the prosthetic Cu(II)-bipyridine cofactor complex in the enzyme lysyl oxidase.|$|E
50|$|In some regions, {{including}} the Indian subcontinent, Bangladesh, Ethiopia and Nepal, the <b>grass</b> <b>pea</b> {{has become a}} staple food item.

The fire which destroyed the small settlement was archaeologically dated to the middle of the 5 th century A. D., few years before the end of the Roman Empire. This was a period in which the state structure, undermined by the barbarian invasions which provoked famine and destruction, was in deep economic and political crisis, and the population in Rome and in the countryside lived in precarious conditions. No archaeobotanical data have been available until now for this period in the region of Rome. The presence of <b>grass</b> <b>peas,</b> acorns, two-rowed barley caryopses, and small horse bean seeds demonstrate the general state of regression in the late Roman Empire, when misery and famine were widespread.

40|$|Background]: Currently, {{disorders}} such as diabetes mellitus, obesity or atherosclerosis are recognised {{as major}} global health problems. The use of inositols for treating these illnesses has attracted considerable attention and their extraction from natural sources presents added value as they are considered bioactive ingredients in the food industry. Legumes are natural and rich sources of inositols; however, the co-existence of other low molecular weight carbohydrates (LMWCs) in their extracts, which interfere in their bioactivity, might constitute an important drawback, thereby making their removal essential. [Results]: LMWCs, including inositols, methyl-inositols and glycosyl-inositols of different legume extracts, were determined by GC-MS; the presence of bornesitol (2. 35 mg g- 1) and lathyritol (0. 27 mg g- 1) were reported {{for the first time}} in <b>grass</b> <b>peas.</b> The use of Saccharomyces cerevisiae for the selective removal of interfering carbohydrates was optimised. Incubation time (3 - 40 h) was highly dependent on the composition of the legume considered; inositol contents were generally stable along the treatment. [Conclusion]: Removal of interfering LMWCs from inositol-enriched extracts was successfully achieved using a clean and easily scalable fractionation methodology. This biotechnological procedure not only represents high interest for the production of bioactive food ingredients but for applications in other research areas. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry.
