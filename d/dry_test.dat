40|$|Abstract Background The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the effect of commonly self-prescribed proton pump inhibitors (PPI) on the results of rapid urease test and histology for the diagnosis of H. pylori infection. Methods One hundred-nine consecutive patients with dyspeptic symptoms attending the endoscopy suite were enrolled in this study. Antrum biopsy specimens were collected at endoscopy for the rapid urease test (Pronto Dry, Medical Instrument Corp, France) and histopathology. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and like-hood ratio of a positive and negative of Pronto <b>Dry</b> <b>test</b> were compared against histology. The gold standard test for the diagnosis of H. pylori infection was histopathology. Results Sixty-one percent (66 / 109) patients were males with mean age of 43 ± 14. 1 years and age range 17 – 80 years. Fifty-two percent (57 / 109) were not on any medications while 48 % (52 / 109) used PPI before presentation to the outpatients. Pronto Dry was positive in 40 % (44 / 109) and negative in 60 % (65 / 109). Histopathology was positive for H. pylori in 57 % (62 / 109) and negative in 43 % (47 / 109). The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and like-hood ratio of a positive and negative Pronto <b>Dry</b> <b>test</b> with and without PPI were 43. 3 %, 86. 4 %, 81. 3 %, 3. 18, 0. 656 and 52. 8 % vs 71. 9 %, 80 %, 82. 1 %, 69 %, 3. 59 and 0. 35. Conclusion This study shows that the sensitivity, specificity, NPV and PPV of rapid urease test was reduced in patients who are on PPI. The exclusive use of the rapid urease test for the diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori cannot be recommended in patients with prior PPI use. </p...|$|E

Convective drying in chamber driers is the presentday dominant technique for wood desiccation. Nevertheless, available scientific literature on the subject does not place high emphasis {{on the issue of}} gas flow structure inside the drier installations and, in particular, in the clearance between horizontal rows of stacked saw timber. Whereas, the air flowing between horizontal rows facilitates wood heating and moisture removing from the boundary layer. The present article studies aerodynamics of the experimental timber <b>drying</b> <b>test</b> stand at the A. V. Luikov Heat and Mass Transfer Institute of NAS of Belarus. The timber <b>drying</b> <b>test</b> stand geometry structure is complicated, which is why aerodynamics valuation of the drier agent in the chamber involves the software system ANSYS Fluent 14. 5. For that end, the researchers developed the convective drier installation geometrical model. A physico-mathematical simulation was developed for sawn timber convective drying aerodynamics in the timber <b>drying</b> <b>test</b> stand of the Heat and Mass Transfer Institute. Based on the computations made, the drier agent flow configuration was analyzed, stagnant pockets identified.

To this effect, speed of the drier agent in the chamber should be reduced at the expense of reduction of pressure differential at the blower: from initial (150 Pa) to final (90 Pa).
