5|$|As the French approached, the British lines {{held their}} fire. Wolfe had devised a firing method for {{stopping}} French column advances in 1755 {{that called for}} the centre—in this case, the 43rd and 47th Foot regiments—to <b>hold</b> <b>fire</b> {{while waiting for the}} advancing force to approach within , then open fire at close range.|$|E
5|$|Navarro, for his part, {{pressured}} by Madero, {{tried to keep}} the ceasefire {{for as long as he}} could. This proved to be quite costly to the defenders. The rebel forces captured the outer defenses of the city unopposed, as no federal officer was willing to countermand the orders to <b>hold</b> <b>fire.</b> Instead, the troops withdrew deeper into the city.|$|E
5|$|As Bellerophon slowly drifted away, she was sighted by the 74-gun , {{approaching}} the centre. It was by now about 9 pm; {{in the darkness}} Swiftsures captain, Benjamin Hallowell, was unable to identify the dismasted ship and presumed {{that she was a}} damaged French ship attempting to escape. He debated firing into her, but decided to <b>hold</b> <b>fire</b> and press on to the French centre, where he eventually came to anchor astern of Orient, close to Bellerophons original position. Darby had by this time recovered sufficiently to resume command, and at his order the battered Bellerophon came to anchor at the east end of the bay, and her crew began making repairs. The battle raged throughout the night, and eventually ended in a decisive victory for the British. The next five days were spent repairing the ship and burying the dead. 49 men were killed and 148 wounded on Bellerophon. Eight more died of their wounds in the following week.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, Chivington and 425 {{men of the}} 3rd Colorado Cavalry rode to Fort Lyon {{arriving}} on November 28, 1864. Once at the Fort, Chivington took command of 250 men of the 1st Colorado Cavalry and maybe as many as 12 men of the 1st Regiment New Mexico Volunteer Infantry then set out for Black Kettle's encampment. James Beckwourth, noted frontiersman, acted as guide for Chivington. The following morning, Chivington gave the order to attack. Two officers, Captain Silas Soule and Lieutenant Joseph Cramer, commanding Company D and Company K of the First Colorado Cavalry, refused to obey and told their men to <b>hold</b> <b>fire.</b>|$|E
25|$|Mamedov {{received}} {{the rank of}} Senior Sergeant and fought in military operations on the Northwestern Front as an assistant platoon leader in the 42nd Rifle Regiment of the 180th Rifle Division. He joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1941. Mamedov fought in battles around Novgorod. He led 20 soldiers in defending the command post and communication line near Pustynka settlement in the Novgorod Oblast. His troops were {{cut off from the}} main Soviet forces. After the artillery preparation the Germans commenced a new attack, assuming that the Soviet forces were weakened. Understanding their strategy, Mamedov ordered his troops to <b>hold</b> <b>fire,</b> allowing the enemy to get within 10–15 meters. After three German assaults, he launched a counter-attack with bayonets. The Germans lost over 300 soldiers and retreated. Mamedov personally killed approximately 70 enemy troops, including three officers. For his actions, Mamedov was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union and the Order of Lenin on 11 December 1941 from Pavel Kurochkin. He was the first Azeri to receive the title.|$|E

25|$|Indian Army Eastern Command {{had ordered}} Bangladesh Navy gunboats BNS Palash and BNS Padma, {{accompanied}} by INS Panvel {{and under the}} overall command of Commander M. N. Samant, to sail to the port at Chalna. These ships, carrying Bengali seamen and Indian command crews, had been operating against Pakistani shipping since November, and under the advice of Indian Eastern Air command, had painted their superstructure yellow to avoid misidentification. This had been reported back to Eastern Air Command. This task force sailed on 6 December, entered Mangla at 7:30 AM on 10 December, and took over the port facility. Commander Samant knew that Khulna was an IAF target, but decided to push on anyway. Around 11:30 AM, when the 3 ships were closing in on Khulna dockyard, 3 airplanes dived on them. Commander Samant recognized the IAF planes and ordered the ships to <b>hold</b> <b>fire,</b> but all 3 ships were strafed and sunk by the planes. 3 Bengali naval commandos and 7 Bengali sailors were killed, while 6 naval commandos, 1 BSF JCO, 3 Indian officers, and 7 Bengali seamen were injured. The Indian Navy gave 14 awards (including 3 Mahavir Chakras and 6 Vir Chakras) to the Indian rank-and-file involved in this incident. Bengali Seaman Ruhul Amin, who tried to save M. V. Palash despite being wounded and ordered to abandon ship, and who had later had died under torture, was awarded the Bir Shershtra by the Bangladeshi government. 21 Indian and Bengali sailors also became POWs.|$|E

[...] Captain Parker told his men instead to disperse and go home, but, because of the confusion, the yelling all around, and due to the raspiness of Parker's tubercular voice, some did not hear him, some left very slowly, and none laid down their arms.

500|$|As Caroline approached, Captain Jager {{ordered his}} men to open fire on the British frigate at extreme range, also calling on support from the other Dutch vessels {{anchored}} nearby. In response, Rainier gave orders for {{his men to}} <b>hold</b> <b>fire,</b> enduring the Dutch guns until his frigate was just [...] away before unleashing a full broadside. Jager responded, but the British fire was too strong and within half an hour the Dutch flag was struck. Taking possession of the Dutch frigate, Lieutenant Lemage discovered that 50of the 270men aboard had been killed or wounded and that the ship had suffered moderate damage to its masts and rigging. British casualties in the engagement were three killed outright and eighteen more wounded, six of whom subsequently died. Also killed were four Dutch prisoners who had been sheltering in the hold.|$|E
500|$|In the {{south-east}} Lonsdale Force's Major Cain {{armed with}} a PIAT anti-tank projectile engaged {{in a fight with}} German armoured vehicles for which he would be awarded the Victoria Cross. Elsewhere around the brigade's positions the Germans mounted a number of small attacks, at times supported by armour. Shortage of ammunition made the defenders <b>hold</b> <b>fire</b> until the Germans got within [...] The tactic was successful and time after time the Germans were beaten back. In between German infantry attacks, the defenders came under almost constant mortar and artillery bombardment, which was responsible for the destruction of the divisional ammunition dump. At one stage Major Powell of 156 Para discovered that he and his men were surrounded when the British units on either side of them pulled back without informing them. Asking for permission to withdraw, he gained the impression that headquarters had forgotten about them or thought they had been wiped out. The gaps in the perimeter did allow individual German snipers to infiltrate brigade positions and the Glider Pilots had to send out dedicated anti-sniper patrols to hunt them down. Patrols from both sides moved around the brigade's area and anyone caught in the open during daylight was liable to be confronted by the other side and shot. Touring his brigade positions, Brigadier Hackett, Lieutenant-Colonel Thompson of the artillery and the Brigade Major Tiny Maddon, were caught in the open by mortar fire. Maddon was killed outright while Hackett and Thompson were both wounded and taken to the house of Mrs Kate ter Horst for treatment.|$|E
500|$|Temeraire then rammed {{into the}} Redoutable, {{dismounting}} {{many of the}} French ship's guns, and worked her way alongside, after which her crew lashed the two ships together. Temeraire now poured continuous broadsides into the French ship, taking fire {{as she did so}} from the 112-gun Spanish ship Santa Ana lying off her stern, and from the 74-gun French ship Fougueux, which came up on Temeraires un-engaged starboard side. Harvey ordered his gun crews to <b>hold</b> <b>fire</b> until Fougueux came within point blank range. Temeraires first broadside against Fougueux at a range of 100yards caused considerable damage to the Frenchman's rigging, and she drifted into Temeraire, whose crew promptly lashed her to the side. Temeraire was now lying between two French 74-gun ships. As Harvey later recalled {{in a letter to his}} wife [...] "Perhaps never was a ship so circumstanced as mine, to have for more than three hours two of the enemy's line of battle ships lashed to her." [...] Redoutable, sandwiched between Victory and Temeraire, suffered heavy casualties, reported by Captain Lucas as amounting to 300 dead and 222 wounded. During the fight grenades thrown from the decks and topmasts of Redoutable killed and wounded a number of Temeraires crew and set her starboard rigging and foresail on fire. There was a brief pause in the fighting while both sides worked to douse the flames. Temeraire narrowly escaped destruction when a grenade thrown from Redoutable exploded on her maindeck, nearly igniting the after-magazine. Master-At-Arms John Toohig prevented the fire from spreading and saved not only Temeraire, but the surrounding ships, which would have been caught in the explosion.|$|E

500|$|On 5 July 1943, {{the first}} day of Operation Citadel (5–16 July 1943), the German code name for the Battle of Kursk, in the Großdeutschland area of operations, the Panther {{battalion}} got bogged down in the mud near Beresowyj and failed to support the Füsiliers attack. Nipe indicates that often Oberst Karl Decker and Oberstleutnant Meinrad von Lauchert have been made responsible for this failure. However, Nipe argues [...] "that it can safely be assumed that Strachwitz was present; thus, any responsibility regarding actions of Großdeutschlands Panzers belongs to the Panzer Count." [...] Following the battle, Decker wrote a letter to Guderian complaining about the unnecessary losses incurred by the Großdeutschland division. In this letter Decker stated that how Strachwitz led his tanks on {{the first day}} of Kursk was [...] "idiotic". Strachwitz was wounded again on 10 July. His battle group had been ordered into combat by Hörnlein. The objective was to capture Hill 258.4, about [...] west of Werchopenje. The battle group encountered roughly 30 Soviet tanks on evening of 9 July. An attack proved unfeasible due to the settling darkness. During these events he received news that his son, Hyacinth, had been severely wounded. At dusk on 10 July he ordered the attack on the Soviet tanks. The first T-34s had been destroyed and Strachwitz was directing the attack from his command Panzer and had ordered his gunner to <b>hold</b> <b>fire.</b> Strachwitz was carelessly resting his left arm on the gun-breech. The gunner, without orders, fired the gun, causing the recoiling gun to smash his left arm. Strachwitz was immediately evacuated to a field hospital. Strachwitz's arm was put in a cast and against medical advice he returned to his regiment. When Hörnlein learned of this he gave Strachwitz a direct order to return to the field hospital.|$|E

2500|$|Hallowell {{was still}} in command of Swiftsure in 1798, when {{he was ordered to}} join Horatio Nelson's squadron, {{watching}} the French fleet at Toulon. [...] After the French escaped and captured Malta in June, and invaded Egypt in July, Nelson and his fleet pursued them, eventually locating them anchored in Aboukir Bay on 1 August. Swiftsure was not initially with the fleet, having been ordered by Nelson to reconnoitre Alexandria, before the French had been discovered. He arrived on the scene after dark and moved into the bay to attack. The darkness and the smoke made it difficult to tell which ship was British and which was French, so Hallowell decided to <b>hold</b> <b>fire</b> until he had anchored and prepared his ship. [...] As he moved closer, a darkened ship was spotted standing out of the action. Hallowell determined her to be French, but decided to hold to his original plan and passed her by. The ship was in fact , which had gone up against the much larger 110-gun French first rate Orient earlier in the battle, until being dismasted and forced to drift out of the action.|$|E
