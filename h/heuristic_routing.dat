50|$|<b>Heuristic</b> <b>routing</b> is {{achieved}} using specific algorithms {{to determine a}} better, although not always optimal, path to a destination.

40|$|AbstractAs {{the travel}} time covers a {{substantial}} part of picking processes in warehouses, an appropriate sequencing of picking lines within a batch is crucial to achieve high efficiency. <b>Routing</b> <b>heuristics</b> for line sequencing in order picking batches are well researched, documented and implemented in today's Warehouse Management Systems (WMS). For storage areas in practice where <b>routing</b> <b>heuristics</b> could hardly be applied, an optimisation routine could be an alternative. Based on a digitised network, the Line Sequence Optimisation (LSO) calculates the line sequence for a given batch with the minimum travel time. For a case study at a distributor in the electronic devices business segment, the quantitative evaluation showed an overall improvement potential of 7, 4 %. But in contrast to systematically working <b>heuristics</b> for <b>routing,</b> the sequences generated by the LSO may look illogical to the picker - a qualitative evaluation needs to follow to identify sequence patterns and to discuss the methodology with the picking personnel...|$|R

5000|$|The Freenet {{protocol}} uses a key-based routing protocol, {{similar to}} distributed hash tables. The routing algorithm changed significantly in version 0.7. Prior to version 0.7, Freenet used a <b>heuristic</b> <b>routing</b> algorithm where each node had no fixed location, and routing {{was based on}} which node had served a key closest to the key being fetched (in version 0.3) or which is estimated to serve it faster (in version 0.5). In either case, new connections were sometimes added to downstream nodes (i.e. the node that answered the request) when requests succeeded, and old nodes were discarded in least recently used order (or something close to it). Oskar Sandberg's research (during the development of version 0.7) shows that this [...] "path folding" [...] is critical, and that a very simple routing algorithm will suffice provided there is path folding.|$|E

In this paper we extend the recent work of Arthur and Panigrahy [1] on modelling the distribution of individual data blocks in BT systems, aiming at {{a better understanding of}} why BT can achieve a high degree of parallelism. In particular, we include in our study several new network features that BT systems are using, as well as different local <b>heuristics</b> for <b>routing</b> data blocks in each client. We conduct simulations to figure out to what extent the new network features and <b>routing</b> <b>heuristics</b> would affect the distribution efficiency. Our findings confirm that for the primitive network setting studied in [1], it does require Ω(blog n) phases for n clients to download b data blocks. More interestingly, our work suggests that for the more realistic network setting, the heuristics Random and Rarest Block First both allow n clients to download b blocks in b+O(log n) phases. We believe that the latter bound better reflects the high degree of parallelism of BT observed in reality. It is also worth-mentioning that b +logn is the smallest possible number of phases needed; it is interesting to see that some simple local <b>routing</b> <b>heuristics</b> have a performance so close to the optimal. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} an {{efficient}} <b>heuristic</b> <b>routing</b> {{algorithm is proposed}} that increase the network throughput irrespective of the network traffic load. Its effectiveness {{is based on an}} efficient cost metric, which achieves a successful trade-off between the use of the minimum-hop routes and the load balancing.

This results in an effective compromise of the performance of the algorithm between light and heavy loads. Finally, its simplicity and its suitability for a real-time application render it as an efficient routing algorithm for ATM networks...|$|E
