5|$|About 20officers then marched {{him away}} from Pearl Roundabout. Alekry said that while walking him, riot police also broke his nose and damaged his left eye so badly in the process that he {{temporarily}} lost his sight. He was then taken to a police bus, where <b>his</b> <b>pants</b> were pulled down by an officer who threatened Alekry with sexual assault; though the threat was not carried out.|$|E
5|$|Chance leads Natasha to {{his uncle}} Douvee's (Wilford Brimley) house {{deep in the}} bayou, and enlists his help in {{defeating}} the men. Chance, Natasha, and Douvee lead the hunting party to a warehouse of old damaged Mardi Gras floats and statues, called Mardi Gras graveyard, and even kill off Fouchon's men one by one. Van Cleef is finally gunned down by Chance in a shootout. In the end only Fouchon is left, but he holds Chance at bay by taking Natasha hostage and stabbing Douvee in the chest with an arrow. Chance charges him, attacking with a flurry of blows, and then drops a grenade in <b>his</b> <b>pants.</b> Fouchon attempts to dismantle the grenade, but fails and gets incenerated in the explosion. Chance, Natasha, and Douvee now make {{their way out of}} the warehouse.|$|E
5|$|Lisa {{attempts}} to find her brother by exploring the Squidport for clues. She learns from Grampa that black sedans that have been appearing around town are connected to Bart's disappearance, she also learns from Chief Wiggum that government-style agents have been appearing across the Squidport area. Lisa destroys the sedans, but finds them to be empty. After completing a task for the Sea Captain, she destroys a black limo but discovers Bart {{got out of it}} and boarded a ship. She finds Bart on the ship; he appears to have memory loss and is mumbling unintelligibly, as well as soiling <b>his</b> <b>pants,</b> while occasionally mentioning the sedans and Buzz Cola.|$|E
5000|$|In another, Jack Be Nimble accidentally {{knocked over}} a {{candlestick}} onto the shagged carpeting and insured with GEICO because of <b>his</b> flaming <b>pants,</b> <b>his</b> new <b>pants</b> are bought from Banana Republic.|$|R

5|$|The {{question}} of supply—let me {{deal with it}} this way. I generally believe if a government is elected to power in the lower House and has the numbers and can maintain the numbers in the lower House, it is entitled to expect that it will govern for the three-year term unless quite extraordinary events intervene... Having said that... if we do make up our minds at some stage that the Government is so reprehensible that an Opposition must use whatever power is available to it, then I'd {{want to find a}} situation in which Mr. Whitlam woke up one morning finding the decision had been made and finding that he had been caught with <b>his</b> <b>pants</b> well and truly down.|$|E
5|$|Leslie (Amy Poehler) holds {{a drawing}} to {{determine}} who will fill the park's hummingbird feeders, a job reviled by the parks and recreation department. Jerry (Jim O'Heir), who is often mocked by his co-workers, is chosen because everybody writes down Jerry's name instead of their own. Later, Leslie receives a call from Ann (Rashida Jones) that Jerry is {{in the hospital with}} a dislocated shoulder. Jerry claims to have been mugged in the park, and Leslie decides nobody should tease Jerry anymore. When Jerry returns, he acts particularly buffoonish during a slideshow presentation, and ends up farting and splitting <b>his</b> <b>pants,</b> but everyone holds back laughter at Leslie's request. Leslie meets with Carl Lorthner (Andy Samberg), a park security ranger who is incredibly loud but oblivious to the fact. Leslie suggests Carl get more help for the park to be safe. Meanwhile, Ron (Nick Offerman) teaches a self-defense course {{to the rest of the}} department so they don't end up like Jerry.|$|E
5|$|Mythology and {{folklore}} often {{exaggerate the}} skills of famous gunfighters. Most of these historical figures were not known {{to be capable of}} trick shooting, nor did they necessarily have a reputation for precision sharpshooting. Such tropes that are frequently seen in Westerns include shooting the center of a coin, stylistic pistol twirling, glancing shots that intentionally only graze an opponent (the bullet through the hat being an example), shooting an opponent's belt buckle (thus dropping <b>his</b> <b>pants),</b> a bullet cutting the hangman's rope, or shooting the guns out of opponents' hands (typically as an alternative to killing). The latter was debunked by Mythbusters as an impossibility, as unjacketed bullets tend to shatter into fragments that can hurt or even kill. Ed McGivern dispelled the myth of the inaccuracy of pistol fanning by shooting tight groups while fanning the revolver.|$|E

60|$|Ernest {{paused for}} a moment and {{regarded}} him thoughtfully, noting his face dark and twisted with anger, <b>his</b> <b>panting</b> chest, <b>his</b> writhing body, and his slim white hands nervously clenching and unclenching.|$|R
60|$|When Taurus Antinor {{reached the}} topmost step Caligula {{caught sight of}} him, and the {{intensity}} of his rage was such that his cheeks turned livid and blotchy and hoarse inarticulate sounds escaped <b>his</b> <b>panting</b> throat.|$|R
5|$|The mob lit garbage on {{fire and}} stuffed it through the broken windows as the police grabbed a fire hose. Because it had no water pressure, the hose was {{ineffective}} in dispersing the crowd, and seemed only to encourage them. When demonstrators broke through the windows—which had been covered by plywood by the bar owners to deter the police from raiding the bar—the police inside unholstered their pistols. The doors flew open and officers pointed their weapons at the angry crowd, threatening to shoot. The Village Voice writer Howard Smith, in the bar with the police, took a wrench from the bar and stuffed it in <b>his</b> <b>pants,</b> unsure if {{he might have to}} use it against the mob or the police. He watched someone squirt lighter fluid into the bar; as it was lit and the police took aim, sirens were heard and fire trucks arrived. The onslaught had lasted 45minutes.|$|E
25|$|In another incident, a man's iPod Nano set <b>his</b> <b>pants</b> on fire {{while he}} was working at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport.|$|E
25|$|He {{regularly}} {{wore his}} Phi Beta Kappa key as a zipper {{pull on the}} fly of <b>his</b> <b>pants.</b> He joined Mensa in 1958 or 1959, possibly the first American to do so.|$|E
6000|$|He {{suddenly}} {{gave way}} to his irritation. His self-control vanished. [...] "Damn it!" [...] he cried, and <b>his</b> <b>panting</b> breath quickened; [...] "the thing's got to end. As if I didn't understand! As if I didn't understand!" ...|$|R
60|$|Poyor, {{seeing that}} both the boys had nearly run their race, shouted in his own {{language}} {{a few words to}} Cummings, clasped <b>his</b> <b>panting</b> companions by the waist, and, although thus burdened, soon drew away from both the white men.|$|R
60|$|He {{had ceased}} to roar, but snarl upon snarl escaped <b>his</b> <b>panting</b> throat. The public delighted in him. They loved to see the ferocious brute maddened by these tortures, beside which the agony of Tantalus was but the misery of a child.|$|R
25|$|A badly {{decomposed}} body {{recovered from}} the Chartres Street Wharf in New Orleans on December 28 was identified on January 4, 2006, as Barry. He had {{a piece of paper}} with his name and phone number in <b>his</b> <b>pants</b> pocket. The official cause of death is believed to be drowning as the New Orleans coroner found no signs of foul play.|$|E
25|$|This was {{the first}} tour in which Manson began using stilts. The band also began their {{signature}} bizarre looks during these concerts as well, by shaving their eyebrows, and donning makeup and sexually suggestive clothes (with Manson wearing jock straps to pulling <b>his</b> <b>pants</b> down and tucking his penis between his legs, and with Ramirez beginning his traditional kinderwhore cross-dressing gimmick).|$|E
25|$|Steiner made {{international}} news in June 2007 with his live-blogging of Pearson v. Chung, the $54 million pants lawsuit. The case involved DC Administrative Law Judge Roy Pearson suing his dry cleaner for $54 million under the DC consumer protection act after they lost <b>his</b> <b>pants.</b> Steiner's exclusive live-blogging coverage provided the only up-to-the minute reporting {{from inside the}} Washington, DC Superior Courthouse.|$|E
50|$|However, in March 1944, the German guards, always {{suspicious}} of escapes, caught the telltale sign of sand being dropped {{by one of}} the penguins out the bottom of <b>his</b> <b>pant</b> legs and immediately rounded up Wally and 19 others and transferred them to another camp in Belaria.|$|R
60|$|A moment sufficed {{to enable}} Bob Croaker, who was nearly twice Martin's weight, to free {{himself from the}} grasp of <b>his</b> <b>panting</b> antagonist, whom he threw on his back, and doubled his fist, {{intending}} to strike Martin on the face; but a general rush of the boys prevented this.|$|R

25|$|As Tipton began a {{more serious}} music career, he adopted his father's nickname, Billy, and more {{actively}} worked to pass as male by binding his breasts and padding <b>his</b> <b>pants.</b> At first, Tipton only presented as male in performance, but by 1940 was living as a man in private life as well. Two of Tipton's female cousins, with whom Tipton maintained contact over the years, were the only persons known to be privy to Tipton's assigned sex.|$|E
25|$|In {{one scene}} Hassan is {{attacked}} {{and it is}} suggested that he is raped. The filmmakers wanted Ahmad to take off <b>his</b> <b>pants</b> for the shooting, but his father refused to let him do that. The boy has said that he would never have taken the role had he known Hassan would be raped. Reports vary on whether he and his family were properly informed in advance. The scene has now been depicted in a less harrowing manner than originally planned, and there is no nudity in it. Nevertheless, a body double was used to show the boy's pants being tugged slightly down.|$|E
25|$|Guan Yu {{appears in}} Chinese operas such as Huarong Trail, Red Cliffs, and other {{excerpts}} from Romance of the Three Kingdoms. His costume is a green military opera uniform with armour covering {{his right arm}} and the knees of <b>his</b> <b>pants.</b> The actor's face is painted red with a few black lines, to represent honour and courage. He also wears a long three-section black beard made of yak hair and carries the Green Dragon Crescent Blade. Traditionally, after the show ends, the actor has to wash his face, burn joss paper, light incense, and pray to Chinese deities.|$|E
50|$|M.R. emptied {{his pockets}} and, after being {{asked by the}} vice-principal to do so, pulled up <b>his</b> <b>pant</b> legs. There was a bulge in his sock. The vice-principal removed a plastic bag of marijuana. The bag {{was given to the}} police officer who advised M.R. that he was under arrest for {{possession}} of a narcotic.|$|R
60|$|The {{traveller}} returned {{no answer}} to this speech, but holding the light near to <b>his</b> <b>panting</b> and reeking beast, examined him in limb and carcass. Meanwhile, the other man sat very composedly in his vehicle, which {{was a kind of}} chaise with a depository for a large bag of tools, and watched his proceedings with a careful eye.|$|R
6000|$|Calvin {{looked down}} at <b>his</b> <b>panting,</b> reeking horse, and {{carelessly}} replied: [...] "Oh no. I'm just takin' it out o' this watch-eyed bronco." [...] He exchanged a look with the sheriff. [...] "I thought I'd ketch ye 'fore ye left the agency. I'd like a word with you, sheriff; tumble out here for a minute. You'll wait a second, won't you, Major?" ...|$|R
25|$|In August, {{the band}} headed {{off on the}} Operation Starlift Tour, an all-Australian concert series, which featured: The Masters Apprentices, Johnny Farnham, Ronnie Burns, Russell Morris, Johnny Young, Zoot, and The Valentines. Although the tour was {{apparently}} a financial disaster, it was a promotional success for the band. The Brisbane Festival Hall concert was a highpoint of the tour and they drew a record crowd there, breaking The Beatles' 1964 attendance record. Wheatley was dragged offstage by the audience and had <b>his</b> <b>pants</b> and coat literally torn to shreds, {{with the result that}} one of the police on hand threatened to arrest him for indecent exposure if they did not finish playing immediately.|$|E
25|$|In the Senate of the Philippines, Roseller Lim of the Nacionalista Party {{held out}} the longest {{filibuster}} in Philippine Senate history. On the election for the President of the Senate of the Philippines in April 1963, {{he stood on the}} podium for more than 18 hours to wait for party-mate Alejandro Almendras who was to arrive from the United States. The Nacionalistas, who comprised exactly half of the Senate, wanted to prevent the election of Ferdinand Marcos to the Senate Presidency. Prohibited from even going to the comfort room, he had to relieve in <b>his</b> <b>pants</b> until Almendras' arrival. He voted for party-mate Eulogio Rodriguez just as Almendras arrived, and had to be carried off via stretcher out of the session hall due to exhaustion. However, Almendras voted for Marcos, and the latter wrested the Senate Presidency from the Nacionalistas {{after more than a decade}} of control.|$|E
25|$|In the {{alternate}} ending, Cindy is told Cody does not exist. After hitting {{a few people}} in the face with a shovel, Cindy asks everybody who is not real to stand over at a different spot. Cody goes over there, but is followed by Santa Claus. The aliens then begin to invade but George stops them by transforming into The Hulk. President Harris tries to hulk out, but ends up soiling <b>his</b> <b>pants.</b> Cindy enters the Logan House, where she is attacked by Tabitha. She is teleported away to Aunt Shaneequa, who teaches her how to defeat Tabitha. Cindy must then confront hundreds of Tabithas. She wins the battle by performing moves from The Matrix and teleports back to the Logan House. The cast then gets into a car with the President, but are horrified to learn that the driver happens to be M. Night Shyamalan.|$|E
6000|$|A {{little after}} half-past six, when several {{of us were}} {{beginning}} to think that Pepton had failed in his plans, he drove rapidly into the grounds, making a very short turn at the gate, and pulled up <b>his</b> <b>panting</b> horse {{just in time to}} avoid running over three ladies, who were seated on the grass. The champion was by his side! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The rascal has halted here, I see!" [...] cried Ian, pulling up, leaping off, {{and running}} to the water, which he lifted to his mouth in both hands, while <b>his</b> <b>panting</b> horse stooped and drank. [...] "It was very likely more for Tony's sake than for his own. But if he could stop, so can we for a few minutes." ...|$|R
5000|$|However, a dog grasped <b>his</b> <b>pant</b> leg, piteously crying, and so moving God of Heaven {{to leave}} a few seeds from each type of grain with the dog, thus {{providing}} the seed stock of today's crops. Thus {{it is said that}} because humans owe their possession of grain seed stocks to a dog, people should share some of their food with dogs.(Yang 2005: 53-54) ...|$|R
