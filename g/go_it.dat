5|$|On 30 March 1999, the Council met to {{initiate}} {{planning for a}} centre to house the visual and performing arts at the former Civic Centre site in the Port Macquarie central business district. It recommended a project plan be developed by 2001. On 21 August 2000 a Cultural Facilities Taskforce was created. In December 2000, the Council approached {{the management of the}} neighbouring shopping centre, Port Central, about a possible joint venture on the site, and the Council endorsed further negotiations on 28 May 2001. The joint venture was expected to cost around A$13.5 million, with the Council contributing A$7.3 million. The joint venture collapsed in August 2002 because the Council was not prepared to accommodate the needs of their commercial partner to make the project viable, and decided to <b>go</b> <b>it</b> alone. The new centre became an icon building {{under the direction of the}} Council's General Manager, managed by a Project Control group including the Mayor and Deputy Mayor. The costs blew out considerably by 28 June 2004, when the Council unanimously backed the project, outlays had already reached A$15A$20 million, and by late 2007 they had reached A$41.7 million. This was due to a range of factors including, that the Council bought and demolished neighbouring shops to make the facility big enough to include meeting rooms and conference facilities, and a drain built by convicts in the 19th century, and still in remarkably good condition, was discovered by archaeologists and needed to be preserved.|$|E
5|$|On 8 December 1970, in {{response}} to a request from the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a highly secret meeting was held at the Military Assistance Command, Vietnam's (MACV) Saigon headquarters to discuss the possibility of an ARVN cross-border attack into southeastern Laos. According to General Creighton W. Abrams, the American commander in Vietnam, the main impetus for the offensive came from Colonel Alexander M. Haig, an aide to National Security Advisor Dr. Henry Kissinger. MACV had been disturbed by intelligence of a PAVN logistical build-up in southeastern Laos but was reluctant to let the ARVN <b>go</b> <b>it</b> alone against the North Vietnamese. The group's findings were then sent on to the Joint Chiefs in Washington, D.C. By mid-December, President Richard M. Nixon had also become intrigued by possible offensive actions in Laos and had begun efforts to convince both General Abrams and the members of his cabinet of the efficacy of a cross-border attack.|$|E
5|$|Raju and his team, now {{disguised}} as Sabarimala pilgrims, rent a van {{hoping to catch}} Jayan. Raju's teammate, Ameer Amanulla (Abu Salim), pretends to be an informer for Arif Bhai (Joy Mathew). He lures Jayan into a trap by telling him a gift from Arif is {{waiting for him in}} the van. Jayan is captured and interrogated by Raju who questions the 30,000 Dirham Jayan received from Arif in Dubai, as well as the circumstances surrounding the death of Rafeeq. Jayan reveals that Rafeeq was purposely pushed off a building to his death as part of Arif's master plan to transport the gold, thinking no one would suspect the gold was hidden in his casket. The trail leads Raju to the home of Ramesh's parents where Ramesh has been hiding under the protection of his mother, who is also aware of the smuggling. Raju takes Ramesh into custody along with others involved in the crime but he lets Ramesh <b>go.</b> <b>It</b> is eventually revealed that co-smuggler Shaji (Suresh Krishna), a young politician had deceived Unni and took the gold for himself.|$|E

The win was controversial because with 5 laps to <b>go,</b> <b>it</b> appeared that Earnhardt went below the yellow line to gain position, but NASCAR ruled that Matt Kenseth had forced him below the line, making it a clean pass.|$|E

25|$|When Murphy {{began his}} career as a federal {{attorney}} the workload of the attorney's office was increasing at a rapid rate, mainly because of the number of prosecutions resulting from the enforcement of national prohibition. The government's excellent record in winning convictions in the Eastern District was partially due to Murphy's record of winning all but one of the cases he prosecuted. He practiced law privately to a limited extent while still a federal attorney, and resigned his position as a United States attorney on March 1, 1922. He had several offers to join private practices, but decided to <b>go</b> <b>it</b> alone and formed a partnership with Edward G. Kemp in Detroit.|$|E
25|$|With the Connecticut Huskies {{trailing}} by 8 {{points with}} less than 3 minutes to <b>go,</b> <b>it</b> {{looked as if the}} Duke Blue Devils were going to spoil Jim Calhoun's chance at a second national title. Connecticut's All-American center Emeka Okafor was limited to just 22 minutes because of early foul trouble, but he came up clutch with several big plays down the stretch and finished with 18 points and only 3 fouls. By contrast, all three of Duke's centers fouled out, including Shelden Williams, who committed his fifth foul with 3:04 to play. In addition, Duke went without a field goal for the last 4½ minutes until Chris Duhon's meaningless three-pointer at the buzzer. Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski was denied his 65th NCAA Tournament victory which would have tied him with Dean Smith for the all-time record. He later broke that record.|$|E

25|$|Ngugi {{makes the}} {{dichotomy}} between the villagers (the honest working class) and the elite (corruption) most {{visible in the}} speech that Nyakinyua gives before the villagers, which motivates them {{to make the trip}} to Nairobi. She says, “I think we should <b>go.</b> <b>It</b> is our turn to make things happen. There was a time when things happened the way we in Ilmorog wanted them to happen. We had power over the movement of our limbs. We made up our own words and sang them and we danced to them. But there came a time when this power was taken from us.... We must surround the city and demand back our share” (pp.115–116).

We would {{certainly}} not take a redshirt off Sherrod Harris at this point; it would be unfair for him because he has sat this year with the idea that he'll start the spring as a redshirt freshman. And then Mack (Brown) and I will sit down and discuss the possibility of an emergency situation as we've done in the past; one year Tony Jeffrey worked as quarterback for us because he had played quarterback in high school. So we'll sit down and look at some different options as to which way we would <b>go.</b> <b>It</b> would certainly be somebody that we think can run the offense and have a limited package for those guys. I don't think we'll need an emergency quarterback, but we'll certainly have a third guy ready.|$|E
25|$|Fictitious {{forces can}} be {{considered}} to do work, provided that they move an object on a trajectory that changes its energy from potential to kinetic. For example, consider {{a person in a}} rotating chair holding a weight in their outstretched hand. If they pull their hand inward toward their body, {{from the perspective of the}} rotating reference frame, they have done work against the centrifugal force. When the weight is let <b>go,</b> <b>it</b> spontaneously flies outward relative to the rotating reference frame, because the centrifugal force does work on the object, converting its potential energy into kinetic. From an inertial viewpoint, of course, the object flies away from them because it is suddenly allowed to move in a straight line. This illustrates that the work done, like the total potential and kinetic energy of an object, can be different in a non-inertial frame than an inertial one.|$|E

25|$|Of the Blue Colour of the Sky is {{the third}} studio album by American rock band OK <b>Go.</b> <b>It</b> was {{released}} on January 12, 2010 on Capitol Records in the USA and EMI in the UK, and re-released on the band's independent label Paracadute Records on April 1. The album was produced by Dave Fridmann and was recorded in a span of seven months at Fridmann's Tarbox Road Studios in Cassadaga, New York. The album's name, lyrics, and concept are based on The Influence of the Blue Ray of the Sunlight and of the Blue Colour of the Sky, a pseudoscientific book published in 1876. Its style was noted as {{a significant departure from}} the power pop of their earlier albums. After the band's split with EMI and Capitol, Paracadute took over the promotional campaign and all distribution responsibilities. The album received generally positive reviews from music critics upon release and debuted at number 40 on Billboard 200 chart.|$|E
25|$|The top 10 drivers {{set their}} early quick laps. Hamilton took the early lead with Vettel and Rosberg close behind. With only {{two minutes to}} <b>go</b> <b>it</b> {{looked to be a}} close to who would take pole position. The top three were {{unchanged}} with Vettel very quick on track while Rosberg was going even quicker. However, Barrichello spun off and hit the wall hard, destroying much of {{the left side of his}} car, which brought out the yellow flags meaning anyone who was on a flying lap had to slow down unless they had already passed the scene of the accident. The red flag was brought out with 26 seconds remaining on the clock. As no other cars crossed the line, Hamilton took pole position ahead of Vettel, Rosberg and Mark Webber. Although Barrichello qualified fifth, he started the race tenth after his gearbox change. The session was restarted with only 26 seconds left there was no time to start a flying lap so no one rejoined the circuit. This session was the third of four to be red flagged during the weekend, only the third practice session was not interrupted.|$|E
