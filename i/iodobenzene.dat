500|$|The carbon–iodine bond is {{a common}} {{functional}} group that forms part of core organic chemistry; formally, these compounds may {{be thought of as}} organic derivatives of the iodide anion. The simplest organoiodine compounds, alkyl iodides, may be synthesised by the reaction of alcohols with phosphorus triiodide; these may then be used in nucleophilic substitution reactions, or for preparing Grignard reagents. The C–I bond is the weakest of all the carbon–halogen bonds due to the minuscule difference in electronegativity between carbon (2.55) and iodine (2.66). As such, iodide is the best leaving group among the halogens, {{to such an extent that}} many organoiodine compounds turn yellow when stored over time due to decomposition into elemental iodine; as such, they are commonly used in organic synthesis, because of the easy formation and cleavage of the C–I bond. They are also significantly denser than the other organohalogen compounds thanks to the high atomic weight of iodine. A few organic oxidising agents like the iodanes contain iodine in a higher oxidation state than −1, such as 2-iodoxybenzoic acid, a common reagent for the oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes, and <b>iodobenzene</b> dichloride (PhICl2), used for the selective chlorination of alkenes and alkynes. One of the more well-known uses of organoiodine compounds is the so-called iodoform test, where iodoform (CHI3) is produced by the exhaustive iodination of a methyl ketone (or another compound capable of being oxidised to a methyl ketone), as follows: ...|$|E

40|$|Under high {{pressure}} of CO, typically 40 atm, Palladium-catalyzed cyclization of ω-vinyl <b>iodobenzenes</b> {{in the presence}} of MeOH provides an efficient synthesis of 5 - and 6 -membered ring β-keto-esters (Type II Ac-Pd). Di- and tricarbosubstituted alkenes react similarly, but premature esterification and Type I Ac-Pd can be serious competitive reactions. Nonetheless the use of less nucleophilic trapping agents and lower polarity solvents allows clean cyclization. Moreover, free hydroxyls are detrimental to the cyclization process, while protected, they give good yield of Type II Ac-Pd products and allow high level of asymmetric induction. Cyclization of iodo-dienes and -trienes provides an efficient synthesis of polycyclic structures via cascading cyclic acylpalladation. The use of carbon monoxide as a one carbon unit in a cascading process allows the novel angular-fused-mode cascade. In the related carbonylative cyclization of alkynes, Ac-Pd is restricted to the formation of 5 -membered rings; while the intermolecular process provides an efficient synthesis of butenolides from the carbonylation of aryl iodides {{in the presence of}} internal alkynes. Cyclic carbopalladation is indeed more favored and usually overshadows the competitive acylpalladation process. This has allowed the development of 2 ̆ 2 zipper 2 ̆ 2 -mode and 2 ̆ 2 dumbbell 2 ̆ 2 -mode cascade carbopalladation of alkynes where termination has been effectively achieved via various carbonylative trapping processes such as esterification, amidation, C-enolate trapping, and carbonylative cyclization of alkenes. 1, 1 -Disubstituted alkenes can also participate in tandem carbopalladation-carbonylative esterification processes.

40|$|The UV {{photochemistry}} {{of various}} fluorinated <b>iodobenzenes</b> (4 -fluoro-, 2, 4 -difluoro-, 3, 5 -difluoro-, and perfluoro-iodobenzene) {{has been investigated}} at many wavelengths by velocity map imaging, time-resolved near infrared absorption spectroscopy and (spin-orbit resolved) ab initio calculations of the ground and excited state potentials along the C-I stretch coordinate, R(C-I). The textbook description of the near UV photochemistry of CH(3) I, i. e., σ∗←n excitation to the (3) Q(0 +) state, followed by direct dissociation (to yield spin-orbit excited iodine atom (I∗) products) or by non-adiabatic coupling via a conical intersection (CI) with the (1) Q(1) potential (to yield ground state iodine (I) atoms) is shown to provide a good zero-order model for aryl iodide photochemistry also. However, the aryl halides also possess occupied π and low-lying π∗ orbitals, and have lower (C(2 v) or C(s)) symmetry than CH(3) I. Both of these factors introduce additional subtleties. For example, excitations to and predissociation of ππ∗ excited states provide additional routes to I products, most obviously at long UV wavelengths. nσ∗∕πσ∗ configuration mixing stabilizes the (analogue of the) (3) Q(0 +) potential energy surface (PES), to an extent that scales with the degree of fluorination; the corresponding 4 A(1) PES in C(6) F(5) I is actually predicted to exhibit a minimum at extended R(C-I). This {{has the effect of}} extending the long wavelength threshold for forming I∗ products. The lowered symmetry enables an additional (sloped) CI with the 5 A(2) (9 A(") in 2, 4 -difluorobenzene) PES, which provides an extra non-adiabatic route to (fast) ground state I atoms when populating the 4 A(1) PES at shorter UV excitation wavelengths...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} our {{investigations into}} {{the development of a}} general method for the catalytic, asymmetric bromination of alkenes. The bromination catalysts employed in the research are ortho-substituted <b>iodobenzenes,</b> which are hypothesised to deliver Br+ to the alkene substrate via a hypervalent I(III) -Br bond. Initially, endeavours to achieve a large scale preparation of our asymmetric bromination catalyst, 2, 6 -di-[(4 R, 5 R) - 4, 5 -diphenyl- 4, 5 -dihydro- 1 H-imidazol- 2 -yl]iodobenzene, or R-IBAM, are detailed. In order to facilitate this, a large quantity of enantiopure 1, 2 -diphenylethylene diamine was required to form the chiral amidine moieties of our R-IBAM catalyst. Thus, the development of two novel methods for the synthesis and resolution of 1, 2 -diphenylethylene diamine are described and the subsequent application of each route to a large scale preparation of the enantiopure diamine. The subsequent novel and optimised preparation of our catalyst to produce 25 g of R-IBAM is detailed. The following studies into the catalytic asymmetric bromination of alkenes include the screening of the various reaction conditions, stoichiometric addition of N-bromosuccinimide to the catalysts and the synthesis and screening of a range of R-IBAM derivatives and analogues. An improved understanding of the catalytic cycle and the possible mechanisms of loss of enantioexcess in our brominated product is detailed. The final section of the thesis describes research into the exchange of Br+ between enantiopure bromonium ions and alkenes. The generation of an enantiopure bromonium ion in the absence of alkene was achieved via the rearrangement of enantiopure bromohydrin, (2 S) - 1 -bromo- 1 -phenylpropan- 2 -ol. The intermediate bromonium ion was trapped by chloride to produce the enantiopure bromochlorinated product. This, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, represents the first example of the generation and trapping of an enantiopure bromonium ion. Our subsequent investigations into Br+ transfer from the bromonium ion to added alkene are described. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
