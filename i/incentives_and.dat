40|$|This {{laboratory}} experiment investigates {{the effects of}} a performance <b>incentive</b> scheme <b>and</b> financial audit threats on transfer price negotiations. Three hypotheses are developed, based on a review of transfer pricing, budget-goal setting, <b>incentive,</b> <b>and</b> auditing literatures. Experimental data are gathered over multiple periods of negotiations from forty-eight students, and are analyzed using repeated measure ANOVA. The outcome measured is firm profits. The results show that bonus <b>incentive</b> scheme <b>and</b> audit threats have no effect on firm profits. However, the interaction between the performance based bonus <b>incentive</b> scheme <b>and</b> an audit threat is significant. With both management controls, bonus <b>incentive</b> <b>and</b> audit threats, firm profits are significantly lower than under a bonus incentive scheme only. Possible reasons for these results are explored in the discussion section. In a deflationary pricing environment, study findings have implications for designing a negotiated transfer pricing mechanism in the presence of performance based <b>incentive</b> schemes <b>and</b> financial audit threats...|$|R

When <b>incentive</b> <b>and</b> regulation lose their impacts {{on the cost of}} solar and wind energies at the medium period, newly generated energy capacities of solar and wind systems decrease in a few iterations but then they recover their increasing state. This state stems from increasing solar and wind energy capacities that cause the increase in energy demand and reduce of energy price and profits such that model reacts to balance the system by decreasing supports (<b>incentive</b> <b>and</b> regulation) on solar and wind energies.|$|R

5|$|By {{the end of}} 1957, Nasser nationalized all {{remaining}} British and French {{assets in}} Egypt, including the tobacco, cement, pharmaceutical, and phosphate industries. When efforts to offer tax <b>incentives</b> <b>and</b> attract outside investments yielded no tangible results, he nationalized more companies and made them {{a part of his}} economic development organization. He stopped short of total government control: two-thirds of the economy was still in private hands. This effort achieved a measure of success, with increased agricultural production and investment in industrialization. Nasser initiated the Helwan steelworks, which subsequently became Egypt's largest enterprise, providing the country with product {{and tens of thousands of}} jobs. Nasser also decided to cooperate with the Soviet Union in the construction of the Aswan Dam to replace the withdrawal of US funds.|$|E
5|$|Nixon {{supported}} {{the pipeline project}} even before the oil crisis. On September 10, 1973, he released a message stating that the pipeline was his priority {{for the remainder of}} the Congressional session that year. On November 8, after the embargo had been in place for three weeks, he reaffirmed that statement. Members of Congress, under pressure from their constituents, created the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act, which removed all legal barriers from construction of the pipeline, provided financial <b>incentives,</b> <b>and</b> granted a right-of-way for its construction. The act was drafted, rushed through committee, and approved by the House on November 12, 1973, by a vote of 361–14–60. The next day, the Senate passed it, 80–5–15. Nixon signed it into law on November 16, and a federal right-of-way for the pipeline and transportation highway was granted on January 3, 1974. The deal was signed by the oil companies on January 23, allowing work to start.|$|E
5|$|The {{contact between}} South India and Islam {{goes back to}} the 7th century, when trade between Hindu kingdoms and Islamic caliphates thrived. These Muslim traders settled on the Malabar Coast and married local Hindu women, and their {{descendants}} {{came to be known as}} Mappillas. By the 14th century, Muslims had become a significant minority in the south, though the advent of Portuguese missionaries checked their growth. Haider Ali, though a devout Muslim, did not allow his faith to interfere with the administration of the predominantly Hindu kingdom. Historians are, however, divided on the intentions of Haider Ali's son, Tipu Sultan. It has been claimed that Tipu raised Hindus to prominent positions in his administration, made generous grants to Hindu temples and brahmins, and generally respected other faiths, and that any religious conversions that Tipu undertook were as punishment to those who rebelled against his authority. However, this has been countered by other historians who claim that Tipu Sultan treated the non-Muslims of Mysore far better than those of the Malabar, Raichur and Kodagu regions. They opine that Tipu was responsible for mass conversions of Christians and Hindus in these regions, either by force or by offering them tax <b>incentives</b> <b>and</b> revenue benefits to convert.|$|E

40|$|A {{number of}} internet-based digital {{currency}} platform based on decentralized public ledgers have started since {{the introduction of}} the blockchain concept by the founder of Bitcoin in 2008. An important element of these public ledger platforms is an incentive system that elicits efforts from a distributed global workforce to verify and record transactions on the public ledger and a governance system for the platform. The economic efficiency and possibly viability of a public ledger platform ultimately depend on the design of these <b>incentive</b> <b>and</b> governance systems. Even if a decentralized public ledger were a more efficient technology for conducting financial transactions, and for providing a platform for distributed innovation, deficiencies in its <b>incentive</b> <b>and</b> governance systems could make it overall inferior to alternatives, including existing systems. Current claims that public ledger platforms can conduct financial transactions more efficiently ignore the inefficiencies associated with the <b>incentive</b> <b>and</b> governance systems and the likely costs associated with regulation of these platforms and complementary service providers such as vaults, wallets, and exchanges. It is possible that public ledger platforms are more efficient than other alternative platforms for conducing financial transactions, but as of now the proposition is based on apples-to-oranges comparisons compounded with speculation. Competition will lead to better <b>incentive</b> <b>and</b> governance systems for public ledger platforms...|$|R
