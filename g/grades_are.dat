5|$|About fifty {{grades of}} {{titanium}} and titanium alloys are designed and currently used, although {{only a couple}} of dozen are readily available commercially. The ASTM International recognizes 31 grades of titanium metal and alloys, of which Grades 1 through 4 are commercially pure (unalloyed). Those four vary in tensile strength as a function of oxygen content, with Grade 1 being the most ductile (lowest tensile strength with an oxygen content of 0.18%), and Grade 4 the least ductile (highest tensile strength with an oxygen content of 0.40%). The remaining <b>grades</b> <b>are</b> alloys, each designed for specific properties of ductility, strength, hardness, electrical resistivity, creep resistance, specific corrosion resistance, and combinations thereof.|$|E
5|$|Administered by the International Baccalaureate (IB), the IBDP {{is taught}} in schools in over 140 countries, {{in one of three}} languages: English, French, or Spanish. In order to participate, {{students}} must attend an IB school. IBDP students complete assessments in six subjects, one from each subject group, and three core requirements. Students are evaluated using both internal and external assessments, and courses finish with an externally assessed series of examinations, usually consisting of two or three timed written tests. Internal assessment varies by subject: there may be oral presentations, practical work, or written work. In most cases, these are initially graded by the classroom teacher, whose <b>grades</b> <b>are</b> then verified or modified, as necessary, by an appointed external moderator.|$|E
5|$|Odin Sphere is a {{two-dimensional}} (2D) side-scrolling action role-playing game where the player takes control of five different characters across six playable scenarios. Areas within levels are circular stages allowing movement {{left or right}} with exits leading to other areas; the main goal in each area is to eliminate all enemies and proceed to the next area. Combat—which uses a beat em up-style battle system—takes place within these areas, and revolves around the player character {{using a combination of}} physical attacks and Psypher skills, skills tied to each character's magical weapon. Combination attacks are triggered by attacking enemies continuously. Jumping can be used to reach airborne enemies within stages. At the end of each battle, <b>grades</b> <b>are</b> awarded based on the battle time, damage taken from enemies, and the amount of damage dealt. The amount of in-game currency the player receives as a reward after each battle depends on the battle grade.|$|E

5|$|The {{technicians}} {{start the}} washing process immediately, since delay can cause fermentation of the sugary coating surrounding the bean and ruination {{of the coffee}} flavour. The beans are first thrown into a deep tank. The best cherries sink {{to the bottom and}} pass through a machine that removes their skin. The technicians remove any floating cherries and process them {{in the same way as}} the others for the cooperative to sell on the domestic market for less than specialty-coffee price. The beans are fed through one of the cooperative's three de-skinning and selection machines to remove their skins and most of the sugary coating before running the individual beans through a vibrating colander. The colander separates the very highest quality Grade A beans from those labeled Grade B; the two <b>grades</b> <b>are</b> sent separately down the hill in a water chute with a 1 percent gradient. This process allows for further separation of beans based on quality, with around 15 tanks available at the bottom for capture of the different types. The beans are kept submerged, two days for the best and 15–20 hours for the lesser beans, which causes a small amount of fermentation to convert the remainder of the sugar without significantly impairing the flavour.|$|E

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} analyze the quality of English summative test taken by the {{students}} of MAN Boarding School Meulaboh I in terms of validity, reliability, difficulty index, discrimination index, {{and the effectiveness of}} distractors. Content analysis was employed in this study. Two techniques were carried out to collect the data, namely checklist and document analysis. The data from checklist were analyzed by using a statistical procedure in percentage form and the data from document analysis were analyzed by using Anates Software version 4. The results showed that English summative test in the context of content analysis of the first grade has sufficient validity, the second grade has poor validity, and the third grade has a very poor validity. However, in terms of construct validity the first grade and the third grade have poor construct validity, while the second grade has sufficient construct validity. Meanwhile, in terms of validity coefficient, the first grade and the third <b>grade</b> <b>is</b> 60 % and the second <b>grade</b> <b>is</b> 44 %. Secondly, English summative test of MAN Boarding School has a consistent degree of reliability. The reliability index of the first grade and the second <b>grade</b> test <b>is</b> 0. 70 and the third <b>grade</b> <b>is</b> 0. 88. Thirdly, 60 % of the test in the first grade test, 48 % of which in the second grade, and 8 % of which in the third <b>grade</b> test <b>are</b> accepted. It means that the third grade has a very poor difficulty index. Fourthly, a good discrimination index of the test in the first <b>grade</b> <b>is</b> 76 %, second <b>grade</b> <b>is</b> 56 %, and the third <b>grade</b> <b>is</b> 72 %. In other words, more than half of discrimination index is good. Finally, the quality of distractors of English summative test of the third <b>grade</b> <b>is</b> not as good as that of the first grade and second grade. The effectiveness of English summative test in first <b>grade</b> <b>is</b> 53 %, the second <b>grade</b> <b>is</b> 67 %, and the third <b>grade</b> <b>is</b> 50 %. Banda Ace...|$|R
