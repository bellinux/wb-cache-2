5|$|In many {{developing}} countries, the ketogenic <b>diet</b> <b>is</b> expensive because dairy fats and meat {{are more expensive}} than grain, fruit and vegetables. The modified Atkins diet has been proposed as a lower-cost alternative for those countries; the slightly more expensive food bill can be offset by a reduction in pharmaceutical costs if the <b>diet</b> <b>is</b> successful. The modified Atkins <b>diet</b> <b>is</b> less complex to explain and prepare and requires less support from a dietitian.|$|E
5|$|The {{ketogenic}} <b>diet</b> <b>is</b> usually {{initiated in}} combination with the patient's existing anticonvulsant regimen, though patients may be weaned off anticonvulsants if the <b>diet</b> <b>is</b> successful.

5|$|In Dalmatia, {{the golden}} jackal's diet {{consists}} of mammals, fruits, vegetables, insects, birds and their eggs, grasses and leaves. Jackals change their diet to {{more readily available}} foods. In Serbia, their <b>diet</b> <b>is</b> primarily livestock carcasses that are increasingly prevalent {{due to a lack}} of removal, and this may have led to the expansion of their population. In Hungary, 55% of their <b>diet</b> <b>is</b> composed of common voles and bank voles, and 41% is composed of wild boar carcasses. Information on the diet of the golden jackal in northeastern Italy is scant, but it is known to prey on small roe deer and hares. In Israel, golden jackals are significant predators of snakes; during a poisoning campaign against golden jackals there was an increase in human snakebite reports, but a decrease when the poisoning ceased.|$|E

5000|$|Two {{experimental}} <b>diets</b> <b>were</b> {{selected for}} the DASH study and compared with each other, and with a third: the control diet. The control <b>diet</b> <b>was</b> low in potassium, calcium, magnesium and fiber and featured a fat and protein profile so that the pattern was consistent with a “typical American diet at the time”. The first experimental <b>diet</b> <b>was</b> higher in fruits and vegetables but otherwise similar to the control diet (a “fruits and vegetables diet” [...] ), {{with the exception of}} fewer snacks and sweets. Magnesium and Potassium levels were close to the 75th percentile of U.S. consumption in the fruits-and-vegetables diet, which also featured a high fiber profile. The second experimental <b>diet</b> <b>was</b> high in fruits-and-vegetables and in low-fat dairy products, as well as lower in overall fat and saturated fat, with higher fiber and higher protein compared with the control diet—this <b>diet</b> has <b>been</b> called “the DASH Diet”. The DASH diet (or combination <b>diet)</b> <b>was</b> rich in potassium, magnesium and calcium—a nutrient profile roughly equivalent with the 75th percentile of U.S. consumption.

5|$|Japan's {{legislative}} body is the National Diet, seated in Chiyoda, Tokyo. The <b>Diet</b> <b>is</b> a bicameral body, comprising the lower House of Representatives with 475 seats, elected by popular vote {{every four years}} or when dissolved; and the upper House of Councillors with 242 seats, whose popularly elected members serve six-year terms.

The <b>Diet</b> <b>is</b> dominated by the social liberal Democratic Party of Japan (DP) and the conservative Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). The LDP has enjoyed near-continuous electoral success since 1955, except for brief periods between 1993 and 1994 and from 2009 to 2012. As of May 2017, it holds 294 seats in the lower house and 121 seats in the upper house.|$|E
5|$|The {{albatross}} <b>diet</b> <b>is</b> predominantly cephalopods, fish, crustaceans, and offal (organ meat), {{although they}} will also scavenge carrion and feed on other zooplankton. It {{should be noted that}} for most species a comprehensive understanding of <b>diet</b> <b>is</b> known for only the breeding season, when the albatrosses regularly return to land and study is possible. The importance of each of these food sources varies from species to species, and even from population to population; some concentrate on squid alone, others take more krill or fish. Of the two albatross species found in Hawaii, one, the black-footed albatross, takes mostly fish while the Laysan feeds on squid.|$|E
5|$|The {{ketogenic}} <b>diet</b> <b>is</b> indicated as an adjunctive (additional) {{treatment in}} children with drug-resistant epilepsy. It is approved by national clinical guidelines in Scotland, England and Wales and reimbursed by nearly all US insurance companies. Children with a focal lesion (a single point of brain abnormality causing the epilepsy) who would make suitable candidates for surgery {{are more likely to}} become seizure-free with surgery than with the ketogenic diet. In the UK, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence advises that the diet should not be recommended for adults with epilepsy. About a third of epilepsy centres that offer the ketogenic diet also offer a dietary therapy to adults. Some clinicians consider the two less restrictive dietary variants—the low glycaemic index treatment and the modified Atkins diet—to be more appropriate for adolescents and adults. A liquid form of the ketogenic <b>diet</b> <b>is</b> particularly easy to prepare for, and well tolerated by, infants on formula and children who are tube-fed.|$|E

5|$|The primary predators of {{this species}} are diurnal birds of prey, such as falcons and hawks. During nesting, corvids, grackles, housecats, or rat snakes will prey on their eggs.

5|$|Among pterodactyloids {{a greater}} {{variation}} in <b>diet</b> <b>is</b> present. Pteranodontia contained many piscivorous taxa, such as ornithocheirans, boreopterids, pteranodontids and nyctosaurids.

The biggest exception among this group are the istiodactylids, which were likely primarily scavengers.|$|E
