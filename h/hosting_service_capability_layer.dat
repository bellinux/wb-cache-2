40|$|International audienceThe European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) {{released}} {{a set of}} specifications to define a restful architecture for enabling seamless service provisioning across heterogeneous Machine-to-Machine (M 2 M) systems. The current version of this architecture is strongly centralized, thus requiring new enhancements to its scalability, fault tolerance, and flexibility. To bridge this gap, herein it is presented an Overlay <b>Service</b> <b>Capability</b> <b>Layer,</b> based on Information Centric Networking design. Key features, example use cases and preliminary performance assessments are also discussed to highlight the potential of our approach...|$|R
30|$|Taking a more telecom operator-oriented {{approach}} to service provisioning in Machine-to-Machine (M 2 M) networks (which {{can be regarded}} as a generalization/superset of sensor networks), ETSI recently completed the specification of the functional architecture for M 2 M communications [34]. This architecture relies on a <b>service</b> <b>capability</b> <b>layer</b> located at the network and gateway (or device) domains, which is responsible for functions like application enablement, secure transport session establishment, network communication selection, network reachability and addressing, remote entity management, secure service bootstrap, etc. In contrast to SWE, the ETSI M 2 M architecture builds on the use of resources for the exchange of information between system components. The structure of the resources as well as API primitives has been specified and the information exchange follows a RESTful approach. In compliance with this approach, the communication between the gateway and the resource-constrained devices takes place through the COAP protocol [35], which is currently under standardization in IETF.|$|R
40|$|Abstract We {{propose a}} multi-tiered {{architecture}} for middleware-independent Grid job management. The architecture {{consists of a}} number of services for well-defined tasks in the job management process, offering complete user-level isolation of <b>service</b> <b>capabilities,</b> multiple <b>layers</b> of abstraction, control, and fault tolerance. The middleware abstraction layer comprises components for targeted job submission, job control and resource discovery. The brokered job submission layer offers a Grid view on resources, including functionality for resource brokering and submission of jobs to selected resources. The reliable job submission layer includes components for fault tolerant execution of individual jobs and groups of independent jobs, respectively. The architecture is proposed as a composable set of tools rather than a monolithic solution, allowing users to select the individual components of interest. The prototype presented is implemented using the Globus Toolkit 4, integrated with the Globus Toolkit 4 and NorduGrid/ARC middlewares and based on existing and emerging Grid standards. A performance evaluation reveals that the overhead for resource discovery, brokering, middleware-specific format conversions, job monitoring, fault tolerance, and management of individual and groups of jobs is sufficiently small to motivate the use of the framework...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Optical dense {{wavelength}} division multiplexing (D WDM) {{has yielded}} unprecedented levels of bandwidth scalability. In order to exploit these gains, new converged multi-service transport setups have been evolved, most notably under the multi-protocol label. switching (MPLS) and generalized MPLS (GMPLS) frameworks. These paradigms offer very eff ient data-optical integration and enable a <b>host</b> of new <b>service</b> <b>capabilities.</b> As operators deploy these new technologies, the provisioning of “sub-wavelength ” demands over wavelengths has become a crucial requirement, i. e., traffic engineering/grooming. This paper addresses data-optical grooming in converged GMPLS networks. Here, novel integrated constraint-based routing algorithms are developed to provision sub-wavelength demands at both packet-switching and lightpath routing levels. Simulations indicate notable performance gains and resource eficiencies with the proposed schemes...|$|R
40|$|Reusing <b>service</b> <b>capabilities</b> to {{implement}} different integrated services in Next Generation networks (NGN) provides flexible and open service architecture capable of creating innovative services {{that do not}} need to be standardized and are based on the standardized <b>service</b> <b>capabilities.</b> In this architecture, invoking each integrated service may provoke the invocation of multiple <b>service</b> <b>capabilities.</b> The <b>service</b> architecture must therefore provide a mechanism to manage the interactions and the incompatibilities that may occur between these <b>service</b> <b>capability</b> invocations. Due to the shortcomings in the NGN service architecture domain for defining such mechanisms, we define in this paper, new architectural concepts regarding the implementation of a <b>service</b> <b>capability</b> interaction manager as well as the functionalities that this new entity must provide to avoid conflicts between <b>service</b> <b>capability</b> interactions in order {{to implement}} integrated services based on the standardized <b>service</b> <b>capabilities.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBased on the {{differences}} of operation characters between ATC service and manufacturing industry, this paper researched {{the implication of}} safety <b>services</b> <b>capability</b> of ATC <b>service</b> by combining the latest implication of process capability and safety. And this paper established the elemental composition system made of safety <b>services</b> <b>capability</b> of ATC <b>service,</b> which is composed of 4 second-level elements and 15 third-level index. The 4 second-level index includes personnel capability, equipment capability, environmental capability and management capability.
