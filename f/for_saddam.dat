25|$|Although no {{attorneys}} <b>for</b> <b>Saddam</b> {{were present}} at the 1st of July hearing, his first wife, Sajida Talfah, hired a multinational legal team of attorneys, headed by Jordanian Mohammad Rashdan and including Ayesha Gaddafi (Libya), Curtis Doebbler (United States), Emmanuel Ludot (France) and Marc Henzelin (Switzerland). Towards {{the end of the}} first hearing, the deposed president refused to sign the legal document confirming his understanding of the charges.|$|E

25|$|During the 1970s, Baghdad {{experienced}} {{a period of}} prosperity and growth because of {{a sharp increase in}} the price of petroleum, Iraq's main export. New infrastructure including modern sewerage, water, and highway facilities were built during this period. The masterplans of the city (1967, 1973) were delivered by the Polish planning office Miastoprojekt-Kraków, mediated by Polservice. However, the Iran–Iraq War of the 1980s was a difficult time for the city, as money was diverted by Saddam Hussein to the army and thousands of residents were killed. Iran launched a number of missile attacks against Baghdad in retaliation <b>for</b> <b>Saddam</b> Hussein's continuous bombardments of Tehran's residential districts.|$|E
25|$|In February and March 2003, {{he visited}} Iraq {{and talked with}} Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, as a special {{representative}} of President Putin. He brought to Baghdad a message from Putin to call <b>for</b> <b>Saddam</b> to resign voluntarily. He tried to prevent the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, a move which received some support from several nations opposed to the war. Primakov suggested that Saddam must hand over all Iraq's {{weapons of mass destruction}} to the United Nations, among other things. However, the Iraqi leader told Primakov he was confident that no harm would befall him personally—a belief that was later proven incorrect. Primakov later claimed Saddam's execution in 2006 was rushed to prevent him from revealing information on Iraq–United States relations that could embarrass the U.S. government.|$|E
500|$|In 2008 Robert Fisk {{obtained}} a report written in September 2002, <b>for</b> <b>Saddam</b> Hussein's [...] "presidency intelligence office," [...] by Iraq's [...] "Special Intelligence Unit M4." [...] The report {{said that the}} Iraqis had been interrogating Abu Nidal in his home as a suspected spy for Kuwait and Egypt, and indirectly for the United States. It {{said he had been}} asked by the Kuwaitis to find links between Iraq and Al-Qaeda. Just before being moved to a more secure location, Abu Nidal asked to be allowed to change his clothing, went into his bedroom and shot himself, the report said. He was buried on 29 August 2002 in al-Karakh's Islamic cemetery in Baghdad, in a grave marked M7.|$|E
5000|$|A {{spokeswoman}} <b>for</b> <b>Saddam's</b> daughters reported, [...] "They {{felt very}} proud {{as they saw}} their father facing his executioners so bravely." [...] In Amman, the capital of Jordan, Saddam's eldest daughter, Raghad Hussein, joined protests against her father's execution. Protesters expressed sentiment that Saddam is a martyr {{and that he was}} the only Arab leader who said no to the United States.|$|R
50|$|He {{was later}} {{sentence}}d to death {{in an effort to}} terrorize him but the sentence was reduced to lifetime imprisonment as the regime always hoped it could benefit from his skills and expertise one day—a false hope which never materialized <b>for</b> <b>Saddam's</b> regime. He was put in a solitary confinement prison cell for 8 years and was not allowed to make any communication with his family or the outside world during that period.|$|R
50|$|In December 2003, {{he flew to}} CIA {{headquarters}} in Langley together with fellow INA official Nouri Badran to discuss detailed plans for setting up a domestic secret service. The agency was to be headed by Badran, a former Ba'athist who served Saddam as an ambassador until 1990, and, controversially, recruited several agents <b>for</b> <b>Saddam's</b> Mukhabarat. When the Iraqi National Intelligence Service {{was set up in}} March 2004, its designated director was Mohammed Abdullah Mohammed al-Shehwani, another former Ba'athist exile with ties to INA.|$|R

Because of the crime problem in the District, McEwen also attempted to pass legislation overturning the District council's ban on mace, saying people in the District {{should be able to}} defend themselves. During the Persian Gulf War in 1991, McEwen introduced legislation to end President Gerald Ford's ban on U.S. government employees assassinating foreign leaders (Executive Order 12333) in order to clear the way <b>for</b> <b>Saddam</b> Hussein's removal, McEwen objecting to the [...] "cocoon of protection that is placed around him because he holds the position that he holds as leader of his country." ...|$|E
500|$|Following the 2003 {{invasion}} of Iraq, American intelligence agencies reported that aides of Saddam Hussein managed to acquire Belarusian passports while in Syria, {{but that it}} was unlikely that Belarus would offer a safe haven <b>for</b> <b>Saddam</b> and his two sons. This action, along with arms deals with Iraq and Iran, prompted Western governments to take a tougher stance against Lukashenko. The US was particularly angered by the arms sales, and American political leaders increasingly began to refer to Belarus as [...] "Europe's last dictatorship". The EU was concerned for the security of its gas supplies from Russia, which are piped through Belarus, and took an active interest in Belarusian affairs. With the accession of Poland, Latvia and Lithuania, the EU's border with Belarus has grown to more than 1000kilometers.|$|E
500|$|Throughout {{the first}} season, {{different}} characters struggle {{to change their}} identities. Buster works to escape from his mother's control by bonding with brothers Michael and Gob {{as well as with}} love interest Lucille Austero, Lucille Bluth's neighbor and chief social rival. George Michael nurses a forbidden crush on his cousin Maeby, while continually trying to meet his father's expectations. Lindsay's husband Tobias searches for work as an actor, with the aid of Carl Weathers. Michael falls in love with his screw-up older brother Gob's neglected girlfriend Marta, and is torn between being with her and putting [...] "family first". After seeing Michael physically fight with Gob, Marta realizes that they do not share the same family values and she leaves them both. To spite Buster, Lucille adopts a Korean son whom she calls [...] "Annyong" [...] after she mistakes the Korean word for [...] "hello" [...] as his name. Through an escalating series of dares, Gob gets married to a woman he just met, played by Will Arnett's real-life then-wife Amy Poehler, but cannot get an annulment because he refuses to admit that he did not consummate the marriage. Kitty, George Sr.'s former assistant and mistress, tries to blackmail the company. She is caught in the Bluth family yacht's explosion, as used in one of Gob's magic acts, but survives with a cooler full of damning evidence labeled [...] "H Maddas". After previous failed attempts, and a brief religious stint in Judaism, George Sr. finally escapes from prison by faking a heart attack. It is also revealed that George Sr. committed [...] "light treason" [...] by using the company to build mini-palaces <b>for</b> <b>Saddam</b> Hussein in Iraq.|$|E
50|$|As I {{said at the}} outset, none of {{this should}} come as a {{surprise}} to any of us. Terrorism has been a tool used by <b>Saddam</b> <b>for</b> decades. <b>Saddam</b> was a supporter of terrorism long before these terrorist networks had a name. And this support continues. The nexus of poisons and terror is new. The nexus of Iraq and terror is old. The combination is lethal.|$|R

During that time they also wrote and composed some original songs, and for them to get any airtime on the local radio, they had to compose a song <b>for</b> <b>Saddam's</b> Birthday. The song, having a nice catchy tune to it, was aired on the VOY FM more than twice every hour during the public celebratory times of his birthday.|$|R

500|$|During the insurgency's Ramadan Offensive, a {{military}} Chinook transport helicopter carrying 32 soldiers {{was shot down}} with an SA-7 missile near Fallujah on 2 November. Thirteen were killed and the rest wounded. Following the shootdown, Fallujah {{was quiet for a}} few months. On 5 November, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld announced that the Marines would return to Iraq early the next year and would take over Anbar Province. As the Marines prepared to move in, there was a growing consensus that the 82nd had lost control of the area, although the only real problem was Fallujah. Some Marine commanders, like Major General James Mattis and Lieutenant Colonel Carl Mundy, criticized the Army's tactics as [...] "hard-nosed" [...] and [...] "humiliating the Sunni population", promising that the Marines would act differently. Late that November, Operators from A Squadron SAS launched a heliborne assault on a remote farm in Al Anbar province, after they came under fire from insurgents inside, air support was called in and hit the farm, after it was cleared; seven dead insurgents were found whom American intelligence believed were foreign fighters. [...] Riots in Fallujah and Ramadi followed the December capture of Saddam Hussein. The capture of Saddam created significant problems in Anbar: instead of weakening the insurgency, many Anbaris were outraged over what they saw as the degrading treatment of Saddam. Saddam's removal allowed the insurgency to recruit fighters who had previously opposed the Americans but had remained passive out of hatred <b>for</b> <b>Saddam.</b> As Saddam loyalists were killed or captured, leadership positions went to AQI-affiliated hardliners such as Abdullah Abu Azzam al-Iraqi, who was directly responsible for murdering government officials in 2004. While the Ba'ath Party continued {{to play a major role}} in the insurgency, the balance of power had shifted to various religious leaders who were advocating a jihad against American forces.|$|E

5000|$|Khalil al-Duleimi is an {{attorney}} best known <b>for</b> representing <b>Saddam</b> Hussein at his trial. He was one of 22 lawyers representing Hussein at his trial, {{and the only one}} based in Iraq. When Saddam's legal team learned that Saddam was to be interrogated, they requested the presence of a lawyer. Al-Duleimi represented Saddam, and told the head of the legal team, Jordan-based lawyer Ziad al-Khasawneh, that Saddam had answered the tribunal with [...] "confidence and serenity". Al-Duleimi has spent significant time in hiding since his meeting with Saddam, as he received numerous death threats, including a message to his home warning that suicide cells had been formed specifically to kill him as an example to all other attorneys who had volunteered <b>for</b> <b>Saddam's</b> defense team. In May 2005, upon release of photos showing Saddam sleeping and washing his trousers, by an anonymous US Army officer, al-Duleimi made comments critical of the United States Army, but did not comment on a possible lawsuit proposed by al-Khasawneh.|$|R
