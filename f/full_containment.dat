40|$|The {{aim of this}} master theses was to {{evaluate}} the thermal-hydraulic calculation software GOTHIC {{for the purpose of}} nuclear containment safety analyses. The evaluation was performed against some of the Marviken <b>full</b> scale <b>containment</b> experiments and a comparison was also made against the two codes RELAP 5 and COPTA. Models with different complexity were developed in GOTHIC and the parameters pressure, temperature and energy in different areas of the enclosure was investigated. The GOTHIC simulations in general showed a good agreement with the Marviken experimental results and had an overall better agreement then RELAP 5. From the results it was possible to conclude that the developed GOTHIC model provided a good representation of the Marviken facility. ...|$|R

2500|$|The RBMK {{design was}} built {{primarily}} to be powerful, quick {{to build and}} easy to maintain. Full physical containment structures for each reactor would {{have more than doubled}} the cost and construction time of each plant, and since the design had been certified by the Soviet nuclear science ministry as inherently safe when operated within established parameters the Soviet authorities assumed proper adherence to doctrine by workers would make any accident impossible. Additionally, RBMK reactors were designed to allow fuel rods to be changed without shutting down (as in the pressurized heavy water CANDU reactor), both for refueling and for plutonium production (for nuclear weapons). This required large cranes above the core. As the RBMK reactor is very tall (about [...] ), the cost and difficulty of building a heavy containment structure prevented the building of additional emergency containment structures for pipes on top of the reactor. In the Chernobyl accident, the pressure rose to levels high enough to blow the top off the reactor, breaking open the fuel channels in the process and starting a massive fire when air contacted the superheated graphite core. After the Chernobyl accident, some RBMK reactors were retrofitted with a partial containment structure (in lieu of a <b>full</b> <b>containment</b> building), which surround the fuel channels with water jackets in order to capture any radioactive particles released.|$|E

50|$|A {{simplified}} {{diagram of}} the key elements of an SRF cavity setup is shown below. The cavity is immersed in a saturated liquid helium bath. Pumping removes helium vapor boil-off and controls the bath temperature. The helium vessel is often pumped to a pressure below helium's superfluid lambda point {{to take advantage of}} the superfluid's thermal properties. Because superfluid has very high thermal conductivity, it makes an excellent coolant. In addition, superfluids boil only at free surfaces, preventing the formation of bubbles on the surface of the cavity, which would cause mechanical perturbations. An antenna is needed in the setup to couple RF power to the cavity fields and, in turn, any passing particle beam. The cold portions of the setup need to be extremely well insulated, which is best accomplished by a vacuum vessel surrounding the helium vessel and all ancillary cold components. The <b>full</b> SRF cavity <b>containment</b> system, including the vacuum vessel and many details not discussed here, is a cryomodule.|$|R
40|$|In {{the frame}} of the SARnet Network of Excellence, the need was felt for {{assessing}} the status of condensation models adopted in CFD codes relevant for nuclear reactor containment applications. The motivation for this work was provided by the increasingly widespread use of CFD in the analysis of containment behavior consequent to postulated severe accidents, in which wall condensation can promote containment atmosphere mixing. Since standard models are seldom available in many CFD codes for dealing with condensation and in consideration of the different strategies envisaged for analyzing downscaled facilities or <b>full</b> scale <b>containments,</b> this aspect was considered worth of a specific attention. In this aim, after performing a review of the models available to the Participants in the network, appropriate Benchmark Problems were proposed to assess and compare their behavior. The University of Pisa took the charge of coordinating these efforts, proposing an initial step of the Benchmark (identified as the 0 th Step) aimed at comparing code responses among each other and with applicable correlations in the application to a classical problem of condensation on a flat plate; the reference geometrical and operating conditions for this step were selected as an idealization of those typical in the CONAN experimental facility, operated at the University of Pisa. Then, the 1 st Step of the activity involved addressing experimental data from the CONAN facility at different steam mass fractions and velocities and the comparison of the measured condensation rates and of local heat fluxes with code predictions. Both the steps in this activity were fruitful, since they constituted a gradual and relatively systematic approach to the actual experimental conditions, allowing for revising model details and discussing numerical and physical options. Though the comparison with experiments involved up to now {{only a limited number of}} data points, the activity is not considered to be completed and additional experimental data will be offered in the future to obtain a broader assessment of codes in conditions of interest for severe accidents in light water reactors...|$|R
40|$|Other written product {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Since 1992, GAO has published long-term fiscal simulations showing federal deficits and debt levels under both "Baseline Extended" and an "Alternative" set of assumptions. GAO has regularly updated these twice a year. GAO developed its long-term model {{in response to a}} bipartisan request from Members of Congress concerned about the long-term effects of fiscal policy. GAO's simulations provide a broad context for consideration of policy options by illustrating both the importance of taking action and the magnitude of the steps necessary to change the path. They are not intended to suggest particular policy choices that are the prerogative of elected officials but rather to help facilitate a dialog on this important issue. As in the past, GAO shows two simulations: "Baseline Extended" and an "Alternative. " Each is run using two different projections for Social Security and the major health entitlements [...] CBO's baseline and alternative assumptions and the Social Security and Medicare Trustees' (Trustees) intermediate assumptions and projections based on the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Office of the Actuary (CMS Actuary) alternative assumptions. "Baseline Extended" follows the Congressional Budget Office's (CBO) August 2010 baseline estimates for the first 10 years and then simply holds revenue and spending other than interest on the debt and the large entitlement programs (Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid) constant as a share of gross domestic product (GDP). As a share of GDP, revenue over the entire period is higher than the 20 -and 40 -year historical average; discretionary spending is below both the 20 - and 40 -year average. In the "Alternative" simulation, all tax provisions are extended to 2020 and the alternative minimum tax (AMT) exemption amount is indexed to inflation through 2020; revenues are then brought back to the historical average as a share of GDP; discretionary spending grows with GDP during the entire period [...] keeping it just below the 40 -year historical average as a share of GDP; Medicare physician payment rates are not reduced as in CBO's baseline. The two different sets of projections for Social Security and the major health entitlement programs are as follows: For Baseline Extended GAO uses (i) the Social Security and Medicare Trustees' intermediate projections from their most recent report issued in August and (ii) the CBO projections that are closest to current law and CBO's cost estimates for the recently enacted health care legislation. For the Alternative, projections for the major health entitlement programs are based on: (i) The CMS Actuary's alternative projections, which assume that the <b>full</b> cost <b>containment</b> in the health care legislation is not sustained and (ii) the CBO alternative which assumed some of the policies intended to restrain growth in health care spending would not continue after 2020. At this point the spending effects of the cost containment mechanisms are unknown. GAO also calculates the Fiscal Gap [...] the size of action that must be taken to stabilize debt at the current share of GDP. ...|$|R

40|$|Background: Seclusion (the {{isolation}} {{of a patient}} in a locked room) {{and transfer to a}} psychiatric intensive care unit (PICU; a specialised higher-security ward with higher staffing levels) are two common methods for the management of disturbed patient behaviour within acute psychiatric hospitals. Some hospitals do not have seclusion rooms or easy access to an on-site PICU. It is not known how these differences affect patient management and outcomes. Objectives: To (1) assess the factors {{associated with the use of}} seclusion and PICU care, (2) estimate the consequences of the use of these on subsequent violence and costs (study 1) and (3) describe differences in the management of disturbed patient behaviour related to differential availability (study 2). Design: The electronic patient record system at one trust was used to compare outcomes for patients who were and were not subject to seclusion or a PICU, controlling for variables, including recent behaviours. A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed (study 1). Nursing staff at eight hospitals with differing access to seclusion and a PICU completed attitudinal measures, a video test on restraint-use timing and an interview about the escalation pathway for the management of disturbed behaviour at their hospital. Analyses examined how results differed by access to PICU and seclusion (study 2). Participants: Patients on acute wards or PICUs in one NHS trust during the period 2008 – 13 (study 1) and nursing staff at eight randomly selected hospitals in England, with varying access to seclusion and to a PICU (study 2). Main outcome measures: Aggression, violence and cost (study 1), and utilisation, speed of use and attitudes to the <b>full</b> range of <b>containment</b> methods (study 2). Results: Patients subject to seclusion or held in a PICU were more likely than those who were not to be aggressive afterwards, and costs of care were higher, but this was probably because of selection bias. We could not derive satisfactory estimates of the causal effect of either intervention, but it appeared that it would be feasible to do so for seclusion based on an enriched sample of untreated controls (study 1). Hospitals without seclusion rooms used more rapid tranquillisation, nursing of the patient in a side room accompanied by staff and seclusion using an ordinary room (study 2). Staff at hospitals without seclusion rated it as less acceptable and were slower to initiate manual restraint. Hospitals without an on-site PICU used more seclusion, de-escalation and within-eyesight observation. Limitations: Official record systems may be subject to recording biases and crucial variables may not be recorded (study 1). Interviews were complex, difficult, constrained by the need for standardisation and collected in small numbers at each hospital (study 2). Conclusions: Closing seclusion rooms and/or restricting PICU access does not appear to reduce the overall levels of containment, as substitution of other methods occurs. Services considering expanding access to seclusion or to a PICU should do so with caution. More evaluative research using stronger designs is required.
