Inhibition of Salmonella enteritidis {{ingested}} in mononuclear phagocytes from {{liver and}} subcutaneous tissue of mice immunized with live vaccine. J. Bacteriol. 83 : 1306 – 1312. 1962. —In our earlier studies {{it was shown}} that mice hyperimmunized with live vaccine of Salmonella enteritidis resisted intravenous challenge with 1, 000 MLD of virulent strain 116 – 54 of S. enteritidis. Survivors of this challenge completely resisted additional intravenous challenge with 10, 000 MLD of the same organism. Mononuclear phagocytes obtained from the abdominal cavity of mice immunized with live vaccine of S. enteritidis inhibited intracellular multiplication of virulent strain 116 – 54, regardless {{of the presence of}} antibody in the cell-culture medium. In the present study, mononuclear phagocytes were obtained in a nearly pure state from liver or subcutaneous tissue of mice and were maintained in vitro in good condition. These cells also resisted cellular degeneration caused by intracellular existence of virulent strain 116 – 54, regardless of the presence of antibody in the cell-culture medium. In contrast, cells obtained from normal mice or mice immunized with <b>dead</b> <b>vaccine</b> were subject to degeneration...|$|E
40|$|Live {{vaccines}} {{have long}} been known to trigger far more vigorous immune responses than their killed counterparts 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. This {{has been attributed to}} the ability of live microorganisms to replicate and express specialized virulence factors that facilitate invasion and infection of their hosts 7. However, protective immunization can often be achieved with a single injection of live, but not dead, attenuated microorganisms stripped of their virulence factors. Pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), which are detected by the immune system 8, 9, are present in both live and killed vaccines, indicating that certain poorly characterized aspects of live microorganisms, not incorporated in dead vaccines, are particularly effective at inducing protective immunity. Here we show that the mammalian innate immune system can directly sense microbial viability through detection of a special class of viability-associated PAMPs (vita-PAMPs). We identify prokaryotic messenger RNA as a vita-PAMP present only in viable bacteria, the recognition of which elicits a unique innate response and a robust adaptive antibody response. Notably, the innate response evoked by viability and prokaryotic mRNA was thus far considered to be reserved for pathogenic bacteria, but we show that even non-pathogenic bacteria in sterile tissues can trigger similar responses, provided that they are alive. Thus, the immune system actively gauges the infectious risk by searching PAMPs for signatures of microbial life and thus infectivity. Detection of vita-PAMPs triggers a state of alert not warranted for dead bacteria. Vaccine formulations that incorporate vita-PAMPs could thus combine the superior protection of live vaccines with the safety of <b>dead</b> <b>vaccine...</b>|$|E
40|$|Only 12 {{years after}} Paris, the first Pasteur Institute in Serbia and the Balkans {{was founded in}} Niš, in 1900. Its {{contribution}} to preventive medicine of Serbia was enormous, primarily in production of vaccine against variola and rabies. After the liberation in 1919, the Pasteur Institute was re-established and it continued its scientific work under the management of Gerasim Alivizatos, a Greek {{who had come to}} help Serbian people. He {{is the author of the}} so-called mixed method in rabies prophylaxis, in which he combined dilution of live vaccine with concentrated ether treated vaccine. He published his work on this method in the journal Deutschen Medicinische Wochenschrift in 1922. After 1928, the only active Pasteur Institute in the whole Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes was the Pasteur Institute in Novi Sad, which has remained the central anti-rabies institution to the present day. Its first director, Dr. Adolf Hempt, born in Novi Sad in 1874, was the author of the world famous vaccine against rabies, which was named after him and was in use from 1925 to 1989. He was the first in the world to have made a completely inactive, i. e. <b>dead</b> <b>vaccine,</b> which was much safer for use, so many European countries such as Austria, Czechoslovakia, Germany, Hungary gradually accepted it under the name of Hempt, and from the Novi Sad Institute it was exported to some African countries as well. Dr Hempt published his first work on the new vaccine in the magazine Annales de l'Institut Pasteur in 1925 in French, and he also published a monograph in German by Bering Institute in 1938, nowadays ranked as a monograph of international importance...|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY Inmune {{response}} in Calves Vaccinated with {{several types of}} Antirrabic Vaccines In order to evaluate the inmunitary {{response in}} calfs of one, two, and three mont of age, a Trial Clinic was made in a free zone of Paralitic Rabies, in which calfs were inoculated with to Lives Virus and <b>Dead</b> Virus Antirrabies <b>Vaccines.</b> In order to evaluate the antibodies, the Seroneutralization test in mouse was applied, and the measurement of the antibodies tittles was made at the 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, and 360 days after the vaccination. Antibodies tittles in levels upper 1 : 5 were determined {{and the appearance of}} the lives and <b>dead</b> Virus <b>Vaccine</b> within group of age was made. The "Control Group" was negative in the diferents measurements. In Calfs of one and three month of age, the antibodies tittles obtained for the Lives Virus Vaccine were significantly different to be appareance with the antibodies tittles of the <b>dead</b> virus <b>vaccine.</b> In calves of two month of age, both vaccines don 4 t show significant difference. At the 16 days after the antirrabics vaccination, with Lives and <b>Dead</b> Virus <b>Vaccine,</b> the porcentages of calfs of differents groups of age didn 4 t show Significant difference, while at the 360 days after the vaccination the porcentages of calfs of one and the three months of age vaccinated with the Lives Virus Vaccine showed significant difference to be appearance with the <b>dead</b> virus <b>vaccine.</b> These results indicate that the antibodies levels in calfs vaccinated with the Lives Virus Vaccine, are maintained for more time that in calfs vaccinated with the <b>dead</b> Virus <b>vaccine.</b> This Trial Clinic show the effective response of calfs to be vaccinated with the Antirrabics Vaccines at the first month of age, in wich a real condition of protection is installe...|$|R

40|$|Live {{attenuated}} vaccines {{are often}} superior to <b>dead</b> <b>vaccines,</b> yet the immunological mechanisms remain largely obscure. We have recently uncovered an inherent capacity of antigen-presenting cells (APC) to discriminate live from killed bacteria {{by virtue of}} vita-PAMPs. Here we found that innate recognition of bacterial viability strongly promotes the differentiation of fully functional T follicular helper (TFH) cells. We identify TLR 8 and its signaling adaptor MyD 88 as critical sensor for bacterial viability in human APC, activation of which is required and sufficient to induce selective transcriptional remodeling {{and the production of}} TFH promoting signals like IL- 12. Activators of other TLRs including licensed vaccine adjuvants fail to do so. Consequently, vita-PAMP receptors such as TLR 8 represent promising targets for adjuvants to improve the efficacy of modern inanimate subunit vaccines...|$|R

40|$|Hyperimmunization of {{rabbits and}} mice against streptococcal groups A-variant and A polysaccharides (Av-CHO and A-CHOP {{leads to the}} {{induction}} of a long-lived immunological memory. The number of clonotypes of specific IgG antibodies remains constant with time and repeated immunizations. This pattern is already stable from the moment when IgG antibodies are first detectable (1). It was previously shown that peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) from rabbits primed in vivo with the Av-CHO can be restimulated in vitro. It was observed that the pattern of IgG antibodies overlapped with the clonotype patterns induced in vivo (2). In the present paper the state of immunological memory was investigated by using both conventional and microculture techniques (2 - 4). Materials and Methods Rabbits. The rabbits used within this study were taken from a colony bred selectively for restricted high responders (5). They had been previously immunized with <b>dead</b> <b>vaccines</b> of Group A-variant (strain A 486 variant, M-) streptococci and produced 10 - 25 mg/ml of antibody {{at the peak of}} the response. Rabbit K 19 - 205 was additionally immunized with a Group A (strain J 17 A 4) streptococcal vaccine 6 mo after the irdection course with the Group A-variant vaccine. Cultures.

30|$|Although the {{synergetic}} {{effects of}} VC, E and/or Bet may enhance laying traits, it received little thoughtfulness deposited through various mode of action. For example, {{a combination of}} ascorbate and α -tocopherol impaired myoglobin oxidation, whereas α-tocopherol or ascorbate alone did not delay metmyoglobin formation (Yin et al. 1993). In addition, VC was found to boost antioxidant activity of VE and guard VE from peroxidation (Jacob 1995; Sahin et al. 2002) by restore the tocopheroxyl radicals to their active form of VE or by sparing available VE (Retsky and Frei 1995). Thus, a positive synergistic influence of 75  IU/kg of VE and 200  ppm of VC on the immune function as antibody titer increased of broilers against Brucella abortus and Newcastle modified live and <b>dead</b> virus <b>vaccine</b> was shown (Gonzalez-Vega-Aguire et al. 1995). Also, VE (125  mg/kg diet) plus VC (200  mg/kg diet) boosted laying performance in heat-stressed layers (Çiftçi et al. 2005), and VC (150  mg) and/or VE 150  mg improved laying characteristics in layers to heat stress (Ajakaiye et al. 2011). However, VE (α-Tocopherol acetate) did not affect performance of heat-stressed (33  °C) laying hens but increased serum cholesterol and immunity.|$|R
40|$|The {{large number}} of {{different}} proteins synthesized by the mycobacterial cell are currently classified and studied in terms of groups of proteins with certain common properties such as physical and chemical characteristics, function, and localization in the mycobacterial cell. Proteins that are actively secreted during culture on synthetic media represent a particular group of great current interest. At least eight proteins secreted by Mycobacterium tuberculosis have been isolated and characterized to various extents. The genes coding for five proteins secreted from M. tuberculosis and/or Mycobacterium bovis BCG have been cloned and sequenced. All of them contain typical signal sequences. The proteins of the antigen 85 complex, which form the main subject of this review, are often the most common proteins in M. tuberculosis culture fluid. The constituents denoted 85 A, 85 B, and 85 C are encoded by three genes located at different sites in the mycobacterial genome and show extensive cross-reactivity as well as homology at amino acid and gene levels. The proteins differ slightly in molecular mass in the 30 - to 31 -kDa region, {{and all of them}} are fibronectin-binding proteins, but the significance of the latter observation and the role of these proteins in mycobacterial physiology and interaction with the infected host remain to be elucidated. The antigen 85 complex proteins are strongly immunogenic in natural and experimental mycobacterial infections in terms of both induction of antibody synthesis and T-cell-mediated reactions. The well-recognized difference in the efficacy of live and <b>dead</b> mycobacterial <b>vaccines</b> should be considered in relation to the group of secreted antigens. After inoculation, live bacteria in vaccines such as BCG multiply in the host, probably releasing several constituents belonging to the class of secreted proteins and hence resulting in more efficient stimulation of the immune system. Secreted mycobacterial antigens are expected to be of particular significance in induction of various immune responses that are responsible for development of protective immunity in some individuals and for clinical symptoms and complications of the ensuing disease in others...|$|R
