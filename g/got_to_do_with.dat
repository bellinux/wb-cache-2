In 1988, both Tina and Ike signed away their rights to have their lives dramatized in a biopic based off Tina's book. Ike Turner would later claim that he signed against his will since he was heavily addicted to crack {{at the time and}} accepted a $50,000 payment, waiving the right to sue the film company for their portrayal of him in the film. The film What's Love <b>Got</b> <b>to</b> <b>Do</b> <b>with</b> It helped to damage Ike's career in the 1990s. Due to the film and the book, Ike's name became synonymous with domestic violence, overshadowing his contributions to music.|$|E

500|$|After {{her divorce}} from Ike Turner, she rebuilt her career through live performances.

In 1993, [...] "What's Love <b>Got</b> <b>to</b> <b>Do</b> <b>with</b> It" [...] {{was used as the}} title of a biographical film adapted from her autobiography, along with the film's accompanying soundtrack album. In addition to her musical career, Turner has also garnered success acting in films, including the role of the Acid Queen in the 1975 rock musical Tommy, a starring role alongside Mel Gibson in the 1985 action film Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome, and a cameo role in the 1993 film Last Action Hero.|$|E

I haven't dwelled on it; it's all in the past where it belongs." [...] Following the film's and soundtrack's release, Turner embarked on her first US tour in seven years.

500|$|In November 1983, Tina {{released}} her cover of Al Green's [...] "Let's Stay Together", with Capitol. The record became a hit, reaching several European charts, including a top 10 placement in the United Kingdom. The song peaked at number 26 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Turner's first solo {{entry into the}} U.S. charts. It also peaked at the top 10 of the Hot Dance Club Songs and Hot Black Singles charts. The success of the song forced Capitol to rethink its contract with Turner, offering the singer a three album deal, demanding an album on short notice, which had Turner staging what Ebony magazine later called an [...] "amazing comeback." [...] Recorded in two months in London, the album, Private Dancer, was released in June 1984. That same month, Capitol issued the album's second single, [...] "What's Love <b>Got</b> <b>to</b> <b>Do</b> <b>with</b> It.", earlier recorded by the rock group Bucks Fizz in 1984. It reached the top 10 within a month and in September had reached number 1 on the Hot 100 in the U.S. Featuring hit singles, such as [...] "Better Be Good to Me" [...] and [...] "Private Dancer", the album peaked at number 3 on the Billboard 200, selling five million copies alone in the states and selling over twenty million copies worldwide, making it her most successful album.

[...] In February of that year, she embarked on her second world tour supporting the Private Dancer album, where she toured to huge crowds.

During this time, she also contributed on vocals to the USA for Africa benefit song [...] "We Are the World." ...|$|E
500|$|The winning entry was by Angel Gracia and Cliff Guest and {{it showed}} the female protagonist (played by the director's sister Anabel Garcia) being {{supported}} and guided by her girlfriends who introduce her with the male protagonist. The girl even goes to the boy's door to gift him flowers, thereby reversing the usual gender-directed pattern of gift-giving. The male protagonist is portrayed as a [...] "perfect boy" [...] (played by William Fitzgibbon) having the sensibilities like attentiveness, cuteness, playfulness like a friend (after the lyrics [...] "You're my best friend") and not sexual overtones. The video in-turn contrasts him with a self-centered boy who puts on sunglasses, throws his leather jacket {{over his shoulder and}} walks away from the girl. Other videos portrayed a girl pining for her sailor, US-Soviet relations and an arguing couple with the girl in a scene inspired by the music video of Tina Turner's 1984 single [...] "What's Love <b>Got</b> <b>to</b> <b>Do</b> <b>with</b> It".|$|E

MLB {{does not have a}} hard salary cap, instead {{employing}} a luxury tax which applies to teams whose total payroll exceeds certain set thresholds for a given season. Free agency did not exist in MLB prior {{to the end of the}} reserve clause in the 1970s, allowing owners before that time to wholly dictate the terms of player negotiations and resulting in significantly lower salaries. Babe Ruth, widely regarded as one of the greatest baseball players ever, earned an estimated $910,696 ($ inflation-adjusted from 1931 dollars) over his entire playing career.

He believed that such a match flew in the face of German interests. Albert replied angrily [...] "What has that <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> you?...

Albert agreed there were going to be problems with the match, but as he could find no alternative bride, he wrote to Ernest that keeping the affair a private matter (and outside the realm of government) was [...] "the only way to prevent a break with Prussia {{and the only way to}} keep the game in our own hands, impose the conditions that we think necessary, and as far as we can, take off its political edge". Albert also warned his son of Ernest's endeavors to interfere with the match, commenting, [...] "Your uncle...will try his hand at this work.

Zendaya drew criticism because people felt that she was too light skinned and did not greatly resemble Aaliyah. She voiced her strong respect for Aaliyah before dropping out of the project. She explained her choice to withdraw from the film in videos on Instagram. Aaliyah's family has been vocal in their disapproving of the film. Her cousin Jomo Hankerson stated the family would prefer a [...] "major studio release along the lines" [...] of What's Love <b>Got</b> <b>to</b> <b>Do</b> <b>with</b> It, the biopic based on the life of Tina Turner. Aaliyah's family has consulted a lawyer to stop Lifetime from using [...] "any of the music, or any of the photographs and videos" [...] they own and Jomo Hankerson claimed the TV network [...] "didn't reach out."

500|$|It was in {{the video}} of [...] "Material Girl" [...] that Madonna began to accept and utilize herself being {{compared}} to Monroe. However, she established a safe distance from those comparisons and developed inside the same pastiche. Details like the usage of different gloves or different fans in the video brought forth the connections between these women, but Madonna alluded to herself in subtle ways. The fan in Monroe's hand for the original video was an iconography of the Sudarshana Chakra (wheel) held by the Indian idol Vishnu. Scholar Georges-Claude Guilbert, who wrote Madonna as postmodern myth: how one star's self-construction rewrites sex, said that the fan symbolized fiery desire aroused by Monroe as well as ritual sacrifice, eerily foreshadowing her untimely death in 1962. Madonna's fan, which appeared {{at the end of}} the video, signified that Madonna– while paying her tribute to Monroe– was signaling that she had no intention of being a victim like her, and that she was on the path of becoming a feminist post-modern myth. Author Nicholas Cook commented that the video promoted Madonna's identity as the song suggested, with the purpose of shifting [...] "Madonna's image from that of a disco-bimbo to authentic star." [...] Lisa A. Lewis, author of Gender, Politics and MTV said that with the video, Madonna achieved the rare distinction of being accepted as a literature medium by the music authors. [...] "Material Girl" [...] was nominated for best female video at the 1985 MTV Video Music Awards but lost to Tina Turner's [...] "What's Love <b>Got</b> <b>to</b> <b>Do</b> <b>with</b> It". The video was ranked at position 54 on VH1's 100 Greatest Videos.|$|E
