5|$|Upon his adoption, Octavius assumed his great-uncle's name Gaius Julius Caesar. Roman {{citizens}} adopted into a {{new family}} usually retained their old nomen in cognomen form (e.g., Octavianus for one who had been an Octavius, Aemilianus for one who had been an Aemilius, etc.). However, though some of his contemporaries did, {{there is no evidence}} that Octavius ever himself officially used the name Octavianus, as <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> his modest origins too obvious. Historians usually refer to the new Caesar as Octavian during the time between his adoption and his assumption of the name Augustus in 27BC in order to avoid confusing the dead dictator with his heir.|$|E
5|$|Wrestling in Kristiansund {{was first}} {{introduced}} by Løvold wrestling at circuses and town fairs. On 8 January 1911 he held a major show against circus artist Erik Blixt, for which Løvold was promised 100 Norwegian krone (NOK) if he won. Although successful, he did not accept the prize money, as <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> him a professional. He started competing for Fagforeningernes TIF and later IF Ørnulf in Oslo. He represented the latter {{when he won the}} 1912 Norwegian championships, thus qualifying him for the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm. There he participated in the Greco-Roman light heavyweight, but was sent home after losing both his introductory rounds, against Finland's Karl Lind and Austria's Karl Barl.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, if Kemp had won his {{campaign}} for the United States Presidency, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> him {{the first person to}} move from the United States House of Representatives to the White House since James Garfield. When he formed his exploratory committee, he signed Ed Rollins, Reagan's 1984 re-election political director, as an advisor. From the outset, Kemp had failed to position himself as the primary alternative to Vice President Bush. Except for a select few cognoscenti, the general public did not recognize Kemp's leadership ability, although he was a successful man of ideas. In fact, most of the Republican electorate found themselves unfamiliar with Kemp early in {{his campaign}}. Political pundits recognized him, however, as a visionary idea man. In addition, he was quickly perceived as a verbose speaker who sometimes lost contact with his audience. Although Kemp tried to appeal to conservatives, his libertarian philosophies of tolerance and individual rights and his commitment to supporting minorities, women, blue-collar workers and organized labor clashed with conservative voters' social and religious values. To Democrats, Kemp's free-market philosophies were a form of laissez-faire anarchy. However, as much as Kemp wanted to minimize government's role, he acknowledged that moves toward a more laissez-faire system should be well-thought out.|$|E

5|$|In the 1920s, {{however, the}} son, Clarence, {{repeated}} {{the story and}} published a book in the United States, My Uncle George V, in which he claimed {{he was born in}} London in September 1890, about nine months after Albert Victor's meeting with Mrs. Haddon. In 1933, he was charged with demanding money with menace and attempted extortion after writing to the King asking for hush money. At his trial the following January, the prosecution produced documents showing that Haddon's enlistment papers, marriage certificate, officer's commission, demobilisation papers and employment records all showed he was born in or before 1887, at least two years before Albert Victor met Mrs. Haddon. Haddon was found guilty and the judge, believing Haddon to be suffering from delusions, did not jail him but bound him over for three years on the condition that he made no claim that he was Albert Victor's son. Haddon breached the conditions and was jailed for a year. Dismissed as a crank, he died a broken man. Even if Haddon's claim had been true, as with other royal illegitimacies, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> no difference to the royal line of succession.|$|E
5|$|Originally, the {{developers}} planned to only upgrade the graphics and tweak the gameplay. However, as development was {{getting closer to}} completion, Capcom started making more substantial changes in the game. For example, the inventory was expanded so that players could carry a standard item like Jill's lock picking, while defense items, which were initially {{not going to be}} separated from the main inventory, were introduced to make the game a bit easier than the original Resident Evil. The developers originally planned to make all enemies invisible but the idea was ultimately discarded because <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> the remake very different from the original game. However, they designed the zombies so that they could come back to life {{a certain amount of time}} after they are killed. The developers also added new areas for the player to explore, changed most of the puzzle designs, and included a new control scheme called Type C where players move their characters by pressing the R button of the GameCube controller and steer them with the analog stick. Another addition is the subplot involving the character Lisa Trevor, which was cut from the original game. Instead of using adjectives to describe difficulty levels, Mikami deliberately decided to have unique questions so that the player would pick the hard one.|$|E

25|$|Tyre, on {{the coast}} of modern-day Lebanon, was the last major Crusader city that was not {{captured}} by Muslim forces. Strategically, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> more sense for Saladin to capture Tyre before Jerusalem; Saladin, however, chose to pursue Jerusalem first because {{of the importance of the}} city to Islam. Tyre was commanded by Conrad of Montferrat, who strengthened its defences and withstood two sieges by Saladin. In 1188, at Tortosa, Saladin released Guy of Lusignan and returned him to his wife, Queen Sibylla of Jerusalem. They went first to Tripoli, then to Antioch. In 1189, they sought to reclaim Tyre for their kingdom but were refused admission by Conrad, who did not recognize Guy as king. Guy then set about besieging Acre.|$|E
25|$|The priory was {{dedicated}} to St. Mary but was often simply referred to as Black Ladies and the elided form, Blackladies, is also used. The Benedictine nuns resident in the priory wore black habits, but this was so elsewhere too. The {{use of the term}} Black Ladies for the Brewood priory is in contradistinction to another priory in the neighbourhood - an Augustinian convent dedicated to St. Leonard and known as White Ladies Priory. The two priories were founded {{at about the same time}} and were of about the same size and importance. Medieval documents, particularly in the reign of Henry III frequently refer to the nuns or the priory of Brewood without indicating which community is meant. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> sense to distinguish the communities by the colour of their habits.|$|E

25|$|Sharaf {{played a}} minor but {{important}} part in the drama that unfolded in Cairo surrounding the initial consideration of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences of Naguib Mahfouz for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1982. Sharaf was quietly and unofficially approached in 1981 by Dr. Attia Amer, Professor of Arabic Literature at Stockholm University, with a request to forward translations of Mahfouz's work for further study and evaluation by the Swedish Academy. Sharaf acted on the request, only to be rebuffed by Cairo and presented with an alternative candidate, which the Academy politely declined as all nominations were its sole prerogative and mandate and did not yield to government pressure. Sharaf would express disappointment at Cairo’s incomprehensible stance on the issue, believing <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> an enormous difference {{to the cause of}} Arabic literature, to Egypt, to him as ambassador, and naturally to Mahfouz, had the latter been nominated and won the prize, joining the list of Nobel Laureates for that year.|$|E
25|$|KTVT {{was one of}} the few long-tenured major market independents {{that did}} not align with the fledgling Fox Broadcasting Company in the run-up to the network's launch in October 1986. It, however, was {{eliminated}} from contention in becoming a Fox station from the start, as network parent News Corporation had purchased KRLD-TV (the former KNBN-TV, which would become KDAF) as part of its merger with Metromedia in May 1985, six months prior to the Rupert Murdoch-owned media company's announcement of the formation of the Fox network. KDAF and the other five former Metromedia stations served as the nuclei for the new network as the original members of the Fox Television Stations, its group of owned-and-operated stations. However, even without the presence of KDAF, KTVT would have likely passed on the Fox affiliation in any event. Most of the smaller markets that were within KTVT's vast cable footprint had enough commercial television stations to allow Fox to maintain an exclusive affiliation, meaning that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> little sense to have the station relay the network's programming to multiple markets located beyond the reach of its broadcast signal. In the late 1980s, the station relocated its operations to its current facility at 5233 Bridge Street, as a construction project that would widen the West Freeway into a four-lane highway forced KTVT to move from its original studios, which were torn down to make way for the additional freeway lanes.|$|E
