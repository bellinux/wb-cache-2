500|$|NSP3 {{is bound}} to viral mRNAs in {{infected}} cells and it {{is responsible for the}} shutdown of cellular protein synthesis. [...] NSP3 inactivates two translation initiation factors essential for synthesis of proteins from host mRNA. [...] First, NSP3 ejects poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) from the translation <b>initiation</b> <b>factor</b> eIF4F. [...] PABP is required for efficient translation of transcripts with a 3' poly(A) tail, which is found on most host cell transcripts. [...] Second, NSP3 inactivates eIF2 by stimulating its phosphorylation. Efficient translation of rotavirus mRNA, which lacks the 3' poly(A) tail, does not require either of these factors.|$|E
500|$|Non-proteinogenic {{amino acids}} {{that are found}} in {{proteins}} are formed by post-translational modification, which is modification after translation during protein synthesis. These modifications are often essential for the function or regulation of a protein.

Another example is the formation of hypusine in the translation <b>initiation</b> <b>factor</b> EIF5A, through modification of a lysine residue. Such modifications can also determine the localization of the protein, e.g., the addition of long hydrophobic groups can cause a protein to bind to a phospholipid membrane.|$|E

40|$|Initiation {{of protein}} {{synthesis}} {{is a key}} step in the control of gene expres-sion in all kingdoms of life (1). Specific exogenous factors, called initia-tion factors, assist the ribosome in positioning the initiation codon of the messenger RNA (mRNA) and a charged initiator transfer RNA (Met-tRNAiMet) in the P site of the ribosome. Whereas bacteria use just three <b>initiation</b> <b>factors,</b> eukaryotes use almost a dozen <b>initiation</b> <b>factors,</b> {{many of which are}} large multisubunit complexes themselves [reviewed in (2 – 4) ]. Despite substantial differences in the mechanism of initiation, all kingdoms of life share a subset of universally conserved initiation fac-tors (5). In particular, the three bacterial <b>initiation</b> <b>factors</b> IF 1, IF 2, and IF 3 are functionally related to the eukaryotic <b>initiation</b> <b>factors</b> eIF 1 A, eIF 5 B, and eIF 1, respectively.

40|$|The cricket {{paralysis}} virus (CrPV) {{intergenic region}} (IGR) internal ribosome entry site (IRES) uses an unusual mechanism of initiating translation, whereby the IRES occupies the P-site of the ribosome and the initiating tRNA enters the A-site. In vitro experiments {{have demonstrated that}} the CrPV IGR IRES is able to bind purified ribosomes and form 80 S complexes capable of synthesizing small peptides {{in the absence of}} any translation <b>initiation</b> <b>factors.</b> These results suggest that initiation by this IRES is factor-independent. To determine whether the IGR IRES functions in the absence of <b>initiation</b> <b>factors</b> in vivo, we assayed IGR IRES activity in various yeast strains harboring mutations in canonical translation <b>initiation</b> <b>factors.</b> We used a dicistronic reporter assay in yeast to determine whether the CrPV IGR IRES is able to promote translation sufficient to support growth in the presence of various deletions or mutations in translation <b>initiation</b> <b>factors.</b> Using this assay, we have previously shown that the CrPV IGR IRES functions efficiently in yeast when ternary complexes (eIF 2 •GTP•initiator tRNAmet) are reduced. Here, we demonstrate that the CrPV IGR IRES activity does not require the eukaryotic <b>initiation</b> <b>factors</b> eIF 4 G 1 or eIF 5 B, and it is enhanced when eIF 2 B, the eIF 3 b subunit of eIF 3, or eIF 4 E are impaired. Taken together, these data support a model in which the CrPV IGR IRES is capable of initiating protein synthesis {{in the absence of any}} <b>initiation</b> <b>factors</b> in vivo, and suggests that the CrPV IGR IRES initiates translation by directly recruiting the ribosomal subunits in vivo...|$|R
