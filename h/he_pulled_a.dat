5|$|Signing for Chelsea in July 2004 for £24million, Drogba {{scored in}} his third game for the club with a header against Crystal Palace. His season was {{interrupted}} when <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>a</b> stomach muscle against Liverpool which {{kept him out of}} action for over two months. Chelsea won the Premier League, only their second English top-flight championship and their first in 50 years, and the League Cup. Later, Drogba scored in extra time in a 3–2 final win against Liverpool at the Millennium Stadium, as well as reaching the semi-finals of the Champions League. Drogba scored a somewhat disappointing 16 goals in a total of 40 games for Chelsea in his first season: ten in the Premier League, five in the Champions League and one in the League Cup final.|$|E
5|$|In {{the tour}} matches, Loxton {{sometimes}} opened the bowling when Bradman sought to rest Lindwall and Miller {{to save their}} energy for the Tests, and he occasionally batted above the middle-order. Loxton was the most economical, but the least incisive of the bowlers, and he never took more than three wickets in an innings. He played 22 first-class matches and scored 973 runs at 57.23 with three centuries, and took 32 wickets at 21.71. He was eighth in the run-scoring aggregates, but was productive when given an opportunity, ranking fifth in the Australian averages. Loxton was the eighth-leading wicket-taker; all seven frontline bowlers ahead of him took at least 50 wickets. Noted for his energetic and combative approach, Loxton was twice forced out of action for his troubles; <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>a</b> groin while searching for extra pace with the ball early in the tour, and {{towards the end of}} the season, he hit a ball into his face and broke his nose.|$|E
5|$|On March 9, 1842, Francisco Lopez, {{the uncle}} of Antonio's second wife, Jacoba Feliz, took a rest under {{an oak tree}} in Placerita Canyon and had a dream that he was {{floating}} on a pool of gold. When he awoke, <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>a</b> few wild onions from the ground finding flakes of gold in the roots. Contrary to some portraits {{of him as a}} farmer who stumbled upon his discovery by dumb luck, Lopez had studied mineralogy at the University of Mexico and had been actively searching for gold. Evidence suggests that gold had previously been found in the area about thirty years prior, but the Lopez gold find was the first popularly documented incident in the area. This sparked a gold rush on a much smaller scale than the 1849 California Gold Rush. About 2,000 people, mostly from the Mexican state of Sonora, came to Rancho San Francisco to mine the gold.|$|E

5|$|Pattillo Higgins {{was born}} to Roberto James and Sarah (Raye) Higgins on December 5, 1863, in Sabine Pass, Texas. His family moved to Beaumont when he was six years old. He {{attended}} school {{until he reached the}} fourth grade, after which he apprenticed as a gunsmith under his father’s direction. In his youth, he was a violent troublemaker, pulling pranks and harassing African Americans. When he was seventeen, <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>a</b> prank on a black Baptist church that got the attention of a sheriff deputy. The deputy fired a warning shot over Higgins' head, after which Higgins fired back and delivered what would later {{turn out to be a}} fatal hit. The wounded deputy managed to fire again, striking Higgins lower left arm. Higgins' arm would later become severely infected, requiring amputation from the elbow down. Higgins was put on trial for the murder of the deputy, but he would be found not guilty by a jury that perceived his act as self-defense. After his acquittal, he worked as a logger along the Texas-Louisiana border, apparently unhindered by his lack of an arm. It was in 1885 that he attended a Baptist revival meeting where he made the decision to become a Christian. Realizing that the lumber camps were not the ideal place to maintain a good morality, he decided to return to Beaumont, Texas to establish himself as a businessman.|$|E

25|$|Hoad started 1953 {{poorly in}} the singles {{with a second}} round exit against Clive Wilderspin at the Australian Championships in Melbourne after playing an uncharacteristic {{baseline}} game. He was more successful in doubles when he and Rosewall became the youngest team to win the Australian doubles title after {{a victory in the}} final against Mervyn Rose and Don Candy. In March he successfully defended his singles title Australian Hardcourt Championships, defeating 34-year-old John Bromwich in the final. In the semifinal he had survived six matchpoints against Rosewall. Two weeks later Hoad lost the final of the N.S.W. Hardcourt Championships against Mervyn Rose. Hoad's second overseas tour started in late April and after an exhibition in Cairo at the Gezira Sporting Club he entered the Italian Championships in Rome. He reached the final, losing to Drobný in straight sets but won the doubles title with Rosewall. At the 1953 French Championships in May Hoad was seeded fourth and made it to the quarterfinal which he lost to Vic Seixas due to overhitting and an unreliable serve. Hoad and Rosewall followed up their Australian title with a win at the French Championships after a convincing three-set win in the final against countrymen Rose and Wilderspin. In June Hoad's attacking serve-and-volley game proved too good for Wimbledon favorite Rosewall in the final of the Queen's Club Championship and he won the tournament without losing a set. At Wimbledon Hoad was seeded sixth and as at the French Vic Seixas defeated him in the quarterfinal, this time in a close five-set match that ended 7–9 in the final set on a Hoad double fault. In an all-Australian doubles final Hoad and Rosewall defeated Hartwig and Rose to win their Grand Slam doubles title of the year. Hoad lost to Enrique Morea in the final of the Dutch Championships in mid July. Hoad won his first title on U.S. soil in South Orange at the Eastern Grass Court Championships in mid August, defeating compatriot Rex Hartwig in the final. In the semifinal against Rosewall <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>a</b> back muscle, the first sign of the back problems that would later plague his career. Hoad and Rosewall's hopes of winning the doubles Grand Slam, two years after fellow Australians Ken McGregor and Frank Sedgman had first achieved that feat, were dashed when they lost surprisingly in the third round of the U.S. Doubles Championships.|$|E
500|$|By {{the end of}} {{the year}} Pauline, who was pregnant, wanted to move back to America. John Dos Passos {{recommended}} Key West, and they left Paris in March 1928. Hemingway suffered a severe injury in their Paris bathroom when <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>a</b> skylight down on his head thinking he was pulling on a toilet chain. This left him with a prominent forehead scar, which he carried for the rest of his life. When Hemingway was asked about the scar, he was reluctant to answer. After his departure from Paris, Hemingway [...] "never again lived in a big city".|$|E
500|$|Williams slept {{rough in}} some woodland, and was arrested the next morning, in Spring Gardens, Buxton, after a [...] car chase at high speed, {{starting}} on the Derbyshire moors. After {{his car was}} involved in a collision, <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>a</b> gun and attempted to hijack one of the police cars which had been following him. He was overpowered without firing his gun by the unarmed officers who had been pursuing him. He later said he had wanted the police to shoot him.

500|$|Despite {{his strong}} 2011 {{performance}} and World Series exploits, new manager Mike Matheny assigned Craig {{the role of}} utility player in the outset of 2012, {{with the likes of}} veterans Carlos Beltrán, Berkman, and Holliday already stationed at first base and in the outfield corners. [...] Further, Craig spent all of April on the disabled list (DL) recovering from knee surgery. [...] However, when he returned to play May 1, the Cardinals designated outfielder Erik Komatsu for assignment to make room, and Craig found a windfall of playing time with Berkman now on the DL. [...] After hitting five home runs in a seven-game stretch, injury quickly struck again when <b>he</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>a</b> hamstring in a game against the San Francisco Giants on May 18 and landed back on the 15-day DL. [...] To that point, Craig made a convincing argument for forcing his way into the starting lineup with a combination of top prospect Matt Adams' slumping and hitting [...]373 with a [...]424 on-base percentage and [...]765 slugging percentage in thirteen games.|$|E

In the same US election campaign, Mercer asked Democratic candidate Al Gore to promise to visit the [...] "Canadian capital city" [...] of Toronto after his election. Gore did not question Mercer's incorrect identification of the capital of Canada.|$|E
