Lexell helped Leonhard Euler greatly, especially in applying mathematics to physics and astronomy. He helped Euler to write calculations and prepare papers. On 18 September 1783, after a lunch with his family, during a conversation with Lexell about the newly discovered Uranus and its orbit, Euler <b>felt</b> <b>sick.</b> He died a few hours later.|$|E
25|$|Case 2. This case {{illustrates}} autonomic status epilepticus {{with behavioral}} disturbances {{that would be}} difficult to attribute to seizure activity before the motor focal ictal events. A 6-year-old normal boy had a seizure at 4 years of age while traveling on a train with his parents who vividly described the event: “He was happily playing and asking questions when he started complaining that he was feeling sick, became very pale, and quiet. He did not want to drink or eat. Gradually, he was getting more and more pale, kept complaining that he <b>felt</b> <b>sick,</b> and became restless and frightened. Ten minutes from the onset, his head and eyes slowly turned to the left. The eyes were opened but fixed to the left upper corner. We called his name but he was unresponsive. He had completely gone. We tried to move his head but this was fixed to the left. There were no convulsions. This lasted for another 15 minutes, when his head and eyes returned to normal and he looked better, although he was droopy and really not there. At this stage he vomited once. In the ambulance, approximately 35 minutes from the onset, he was still not aware of what was going on, although he was able to answer simple questions with yes or no. In the hospital he slept for three quarters of an hour and gradually came around, but it took him another half to an hour before he became normal again”. EEG showed occipital paroxysms and MRI was normal. A similar prolonged episode, preceded by behavioral changes, occurred 8 months later at school. He received no medication. Since then he has been well.|$|E

500|$|There {{was little}} advance {{excitement}} about the pending Warriors-Knicks game that Friday. Only five games {{remained in the}} regular season, with the Warriors (46–29) in second place—eleven games behind the Boston Celtics—and the Knicks in last place. Chamberlain {{had spent the night}} before the game in New York City, partying all night with a female companion before dropping her off at her home at 6am With no sleep and suffering from a hangover, he boarded the train to Philadelphia at 8am, met several friends at the Philadelphia train station, and had a long lunch with them, thus almost missing the team bus to Hershey. The other players were similarly bored. Warriors player York Larese said: [...] "The biggest thrill in my life was to see that. There was nothing exciting about the Knicks playing the Warriors in Hershey. Chocolate was more exciting." [...] The game was played at Hershey Sports Arena, an old drafty gym originally built for ice hockey. The league occasionally played games in remote towns to attract new fans. This was the Warriors' third [...] "home" [...] game of the season in Hershey, which was [...] from Philadelphia. [...] The Warriors' Tom Meschery called the arena [...] "god-forsaken place ... The town of Hershey was built around a huge chocolate factory; everything there became permeated with the smell of chocolate. It was practically impossible to stay indoors; people <b>felt</b> <b>sick.</b> I was just dreaming to leave the place as fast as I could." ...|$|E

Masaya knows Mew Ichigo's real identity, but initially pretends otherwise as he knows Ichigo {{does not want}} him to know. Ichigo describes Masaya as [...] "smart", [...] "cute", [...] "very athletic" [...] and [...] "popular at school". He is also depicted as being a polite and calm person, though he does have moments when he yells at others in anger and acts jealous and possessive regarding Ichigo. Towards the end of the series, Masaya reveals that as an orphan, he began acting like a [...] "perfect child" [...] to be adopted, in reality, however, he <b>felt</b> <b>sick</b> of humans and disgusted by how they treat the planet. He also reveals that Ichigo is the sole exception, and it was only with her that he felt like a [...] "real human being". As the series progresses, it is revealed that Masaya is the Blue Knight, but that Masaya did not know that he was the Blue Knight, nor did the Blue Knight appear to have any knowledge that he was Masaya. Once Masaya becomes aware of his transformation, he realizes it was born from his desire to protect Ichigo. Shortly after this revelation, Masaya collapses and reawakens as Deep Blue, the leader of the aliens and the Mew Mew's final enemy. Deep Blue claims that he created Masaya in order to deceive the world until the time was right for his awakening. Masaya sacrifices himself by releasing the final Mew Aqua inside his body in order to stop Deep Blue, and is revived when Ichigo gives her life to save him. In turn, the mew aqua remaining his body then saves her. At the end of the series, Masaya decides to go to England to study the endangered species used for the Mew Project and the Mew Mews hold a mock wedding for Masaya and Ichigo before he leaves. In Tokyo Mew Mew a la Mode, Masaya is the first to sense the new danger to the Mew Mews, and encourages Ichigo to return to help her friends. Towards the end of a la Mode, he also returns to Tokyo.|$|E

2500|$|The second seizure {{occurred}} 6 {{months later}} on a ferryboat trip: “He {{told me that}} he <b>felt</b> <b>sick,</b> and {{on his way to the}} toilet his eyes and head turned to the right and he was talking out of context, and then he was sick. I thought he was having another fit. He was still able to converse with me in and out of sleep. He did not become unconscious, but he was continuously sick for several hours. By the time we arrived in a hospital 3 hours later, he was improving; he just seemed tired. The doctors told us that this was due to dehydration, for which treatment was provided. He was normal the next morning”.|$|E
2500|$|At Wittgenstein's insistence, Moore, {{who was now}} a Cambridge don, {{visited him}} in Norway in 1914, reluctantly because Wittgenstein {{exhausted}} him. David Edmonds and John Eidinow write that Wittgenstein regarded Moore, an internationally known philosopher, {{as an example of}} how far someone could get in life with [...] "absolutely no intelligence whatever." [...] In Norway it was clear that Moore was expected to act as Wittgenstein's secretary, taking down his notes, with Wittgenstein falling into a rage when Moore got something wrong. When he returned to Cambridge, Moore asked the university to consider accepting Logik as sufficient for a bachelor's degree, but they refused, saying it wasn't formatted properly: no footnotes, no preface. Wittgenstein was furious, writing to Moore in May 1914: [...] "If I am not worth your making an exception for me even in some STUPID details then I may as well go to Hell directly; and if I am worth it and you don't do it then—by God—you might go there." [...] Moore was apparently distraught; he wrote in his diary that he <b>felt</b> <b>sick</b> and could not get the letter out of his head. The two did not speak again until 1929.|$|E
2500|$|Case 3. This case {{illustrates}} autonomic status epilepticus {{with frequent}} vomiting witnessed from onset. An 8-year-old boy of mixed race had 2 prolonged seizures {{at the age}} of 5 years. The first seizure occurred during a brief nap. He woke up and walked with “shaking feet” to his mother, complaining that he <b>felt</b> <b>sick.</b> Within 2 to 3 minutes, his eyes and subsequently his head turned to the extreme right. His mother recalls: “I asked him to look at me, and he would not. If I moved his head to the front, it would go back to the right. Within a minute he vomited, and his eyes started blinking, and there were also tiny jerks of his body, legs, and arms that lasted for a minute. He became unresponsive to anything I said to him. He then was rigid, and he went to a deep sleep like in a coma. In the hospital he continued to be in this unconscious state, ever so often just getting up to be sick, and straight back down again. He did not start to regain consciousness or be aware of people around until about 3 hours later. He was well the next morning and discharged home.” ...|$|E

2500|$|He {{walked into}} the nearby Lindo Brothers jewelry store where he told one of the owners, David Lindo, that he <b>felt</b> <b>sick.</b> He asked for some brandy and, when it failed to revive him, a Dr. Hunt was called from West Twenty-Ninth Street. Thorne, at his suggestion, was brought to a back room while a {{messenger}} brought back a sergeant and detective from the West Thirteenth police station. He asked that his wife be sent for, however he died before her arrival 20 minutes after he had entered the store. His body was removed to his home on West Fourteenth Street. His funeral was organized by Captain Williams on his family's behalf and held in the front parlor of his home three days later. When the funeral procession began, around 1,100 policemen had formed in line stretching from Eight to Sixth Avenue. Three police battalions under Captains Theron S. Copeland, Anthony J. Allaire and George Washburn escorted his body to the Calvary Baptist Church for the funeral. Superintendent Walling, Inspectors Thomas F. Byrnes, George W. Dilks and William Murray, and Captains William H. Clinchy, Joseph B. Eakins, Thomas Killilea and John J. Mount walked alongside the hearse as pallbearers. The funeral procession included 16 carriages carrying Thorne's family and friends {{as well as a}} delegation from the Mecca Temple of the Mystic Shrine led by Potentate Walter M. Flemming.
