At the beginning of the course, the pre-service teachers had not really engaged with the content knowledge they required in order to teach pupils up to 11 years of age.

Therefore, it was <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>audit</b> <b>the</b> pre-service teachers’ mathematical knowledge at the beginning of their 38 week course. This paper highlights the issues raised with regard to pre-service teacher confidence, attitude,and course provision by the decision to expose them to deficits in their knowledge. This is of current importance in Wales and England as recent Government regulations require all pre-service teachers to demonstrate levels of competency in mathematics.
