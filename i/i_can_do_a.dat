500|$|English actor Chris Coxon {{played the}} role of SpongeBob. Coxon was a fan of the series and said [...] "If I'd been told a year ago that I would be playing SpongeBob today I would have loved it, {{although}} I'm not sure I would have believed it." [...] Coxon admitted it was difficult to adapt the show into a musical. He remarked [...] "It is difficult because you are trying to recreate this character that is so fluid on screen. For example I'm just getting used to my square costume, although it does have an incredible design, so that, although I am restricted, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> lot of the things he does in the cartoon." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Danke Schoen" [...] {{is one of}} the {{recurring}} motifs in the film and is sung by Ferris, Ed Rooney, and Jeanie. Hughes called it the [...] "most awful song of my youth. Every time it came on, I just wanted to scream, claw my face. I was taking German in high school—which meant that we listened to it in school. I couldn't get away from it." [...] According to Broderick, Ferris's singing [...] "Danke Schoen" [...] in the shower was his idea. [...] "Although it's only because of the brilliance of John's deciding that I should sing [...] "Danke Schoen" [...] on the float in the parade. I had never heard the song before. I was learning it for the parade scene. So we're doing the shower scene and I thought, 'Well, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> little rehearsal.' And I did something with my hair to make that Mohawk. And you know what good directors do: they say, 'Stop! Wait till we roll.' And John put that stuff in." ...|$|E

2500|$|Raiden was {{originally}} {{going to use}} his staff as a weapon already in Mortal Kombat II, but Midway was forced to omit it due to memory constraints. He was unplayable in all versions of Mortal Kombat 3 and briefly appeared only as part of Nightwolf's Friendship, which saw him transform into Raiden while a Mortal Kombat II arcade cabinet appeared along with one of two quotes, [...] "No, But <b>I</b> <b>Can</b> <b>Do</b> <b>a</b> Raiden Transformation", or [...] "I've never seen a Kano transformation", {{both of which were}} based on false reports that Kano was secretly playable in Mortal Kombat II and Raiden likewise in Mortal Kombat 3. The Friendship was changed in the Nintendo 64 version of Mortal Kombat Trilogy after Raiden became a playable character in that game.|$|E
2500|$|Genco Russo's once {{described}} {{his role in}} the community to the social activist Danilo Dolci. It provides an illustration of the self-image of the mafioso in the second, [...] "legitimate" [...] stage of his career - the mafioso as a public benefactor rather than as a dangerous criminal: [...] "It's in my nature. I have no ulterior motives. If <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> man a favour, no matter who he is, I will; because that's how I'm made... I can't say 'no' to anyone. The trouble I'm put to is not so great that I have to refuse people in need... Very often warm-heartedness will win a man gratitude and friendship, and then the time comes to ask for one thing or another in... Folks come and ask how they should vote because they feel the need for advice. They want to show that they are grateful to those who have worked for their good; they want to thank them for what they've done by voting for them; but they are ignorant, and want to be told how to do it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Leslie then {{produced}} {{her entire}} album, {{which is a}} mix of pop and R Cassie described her sound as [...] "mellow, chill, and easy to relate to. This album represents what I've always wanted to do." [...] She said in another interview, [...] "I rap, I sing, I do my R, I do my slow songs and stuff that the girls will love, I have a down South joint, I have a rock song that I did with my girls–this band called Pretty Boys. [...] It has some funk, some old stuff, it's really fun." [...] She paid tribute to her Filipino culture by incorporating OPM sounds into some of the ballads. While describing the process of working with Leslie, she stated, [...] "I will talk about situations that I was going through at the time and we'll talk about that and it comes straight from the heart that's why it works out well between us," [...] continuing about her songwriting input, [...] "I was just kind of going along with it trying to get the vibe. I'm starting to get into it and I'm excited to write." [...] Cassie also mentioned [...] "Not With You" [...] was one of her favorite songs, [...] "It's slow, it's simple, and you get to really hear me as opposed to all the synthesizers and everything in the background," [...] and compared the second single, [...] "Long Way 2 Go," [...] to Vanity 6's vibe. [...] "I'm hoping to show <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> wide range of things," [...] concluding, [...] "The whole album really just goes back to love songs." ...|$|E

But the idea may please His Majesty, and since you will not allow me to kill the birds, it is the best thing <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do.</b> <b>As</b> for your other condition, you seem to be a very bright boy, and so I will have the butler take you as his page, and you shall stand back of the King's chair and keep the flies away while he eats." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'That's {{a direct}} challenge. If {{you can do}} a Melancolia that isn't merely a sorrowful female head, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> better one; and I will, too.

"Well," [...] said Jone, [...] "I {{must say}} I <b>do</b> feel <b>a</b> little overshadowed when I {{go into that}} dining-room and see those proud and haughty waiters, some of them with silver chains and keys around their necks, showing that they are lords of the wine-cellar, {{and all of them}} with an air of lofty scorn for the poor beings who have to sit still and be waited on; but I'll try what <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do.</b> <b>As</b> far as <b>I</b> am able, I'll hold up my end of the social boom." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "It {{will look}} suspicious, Doctor, but I must {{run the risk}} of that till I can remark them again. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> good deal that way before I sail.

60|$|January 11.--Ditto repeated.

A bow that is slackly strung will never send an arrow very far. Heavy snow. We are engaged at Mr. Scrope's, but I think I shall not be able to go. I remained at home accordingly, and, having nothing else to do, worked hard and effectively.
