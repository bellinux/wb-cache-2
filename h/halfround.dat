50|$|Aaveqaspis inesoni {{is almost}} flat (dorso-ventrally). Its body is {{narrowly}} oval in general outline, disregarding the two large spines. The upper non-calcified (or dorsal) {{side of the}} body consists of a cephalon, 5 thorax segments, and a pygidium. The axis is slightly raised, but without a discernible furrow defining its outline. The axis is about 20% of the width of the cephalon. The cephalon is <b>halfround,</b> and almost twice as wide as long (along the axis). The (posterolateral) corners of the cephalon are acute, ending in short stout spines. The back margin of the cephalon from the spine to the midline has in the pleural region a forward angle and is first concave, then convex, then concave again, attaining a backward angle when reaching the axis, and finally convex, with a small node or median spine reaching the back margin. This pattern is repeated with all thorax segments. Antennae are not known. Dorsal eyes are absent. The thorax segments are each about 1.5 mm along the axis. The tail shield is dominated by a pair of large segmental marginal spines, reminiscent of large (or macropleural) spines in the thorax and of pygidial spines of certain trilobites. The one node it carries is larger and more sharply defined than the nodes on the segments. The frontal border of the tail shield is convex and curves laterally into the large spines which extend postero-laterally, constituting half the total body length. The back margin of the spines is concave and merges into a second pair of short, broad, triangular spines. Body parts on the belly (or ventral) side are not known, including any appendages.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} a known plaintext attack on RC 5 based on correlations. Compared {{with the best}} previous known-plaintext attack on RC 5 - 32, a linear cryptanalysis by Borst, Preneel, and Vandewalle, our attack applies to {{a larger number of}} rounds. RC 5 - 32 with r rounds can be broken with a success probability of 90 % by using 2 ^ plaintexts. Therefore, our attack can break RC 5 - 32 with 10 rounds (20 half-rounds) with 2 ^ plaintexts with a probability of 90 %. With a success probability of 30 %, our attack can break RC 5 - 32 with 21 <b>halfrounds</b> by using 2 ^ plaintexts.
