Thus, {{it is much}} more difficult to perform electromagnetic side-channel attacks against them, due to high levels of noise and <b>fast</b> <b>clock</b> rates. Despite these issues, researchers in 2015 and 2016 showed attacks against a laptop using a near-field magnetic probe. The resulting signal, observed for only a few seconds, was filtered, amplified, and digitized for offline key extraction. Most attacks require expensive, lab-grade equipment, and require the attacker to be extremely close to the victim computer. However, some researchers were able to show attacks using cheaper hardware and from distances of up to half a meter. These attacks, however, required the collection of more traces than the more expensive attacks.|$|E
50|$|For example, the Tektronix 7D11 Digital Delay uses {{a counter}} architecture. A digital delay may be set from 100 ns to 1 s in 100 ns increments. An analog circuit {{provides}} an additional fine delay of 0 to 100 ns. A 5 MHz reference clock drives a phase-locked loop {{to produce a}} stable 500 MHz clock. It is this <b>fast</b> <b>clock</b> that is gated by the (fine-delayed) start event and determines the main quantization error. The <b>fast</b> <b>clock</b> is divided down to 10 MHz and fed to main counter. The instrument quantization error depends primarily on the 500 MHz clock (2 ns steps), but other errors also enter; the instrument is specified to have 2.2 ns of jitter. The recycle time is 575 ns.|$|E

Therefore, despite being very <b>fast</b> <b>clock</b> by clock, the 6x86 and MII were forced to compete at the low-end of the market as AMD K6 and Intel P6 Pentium II were always ahead on clock speed. The 6x86's and MII's old generation [...] "486 class" [...] floating point unit combined with an integer section that was at best on-par with the newer P6 and K6 chips meant that Cyrix could no longer compete in performance.|$|E

50|$|The Fifth, last wave of {{computers}} specially meant {{for use as}} home computers arrived in June 1985 with the Atari ST. Soon after, but unavailable until 1986, came Commodore's Amiga. These new machines were an entirely new breed built around Motorola's 16/32-bit 68000 processor, the same as used in Apple's expensive Macintosh and premature Sinclair QL. This chip promised superior performance due to its advanced architecture and <b>fast</b> <b>clock</b> rate, made possible by fast yet inexpensive memory chips. Also, the 68000 could access megabytes of memory linearly, without any need for Intel's segmented memory model. This made huge, sophisticated programs easy to produce. Both machines used the new 3.5 inch floppy drives offering four times the storage of the 5.25 inch drives. The user interface used was graphical, like the Macintosh. The ST used a licensed version of Digital Research's GEM and the Amiga's original GUI featured true multitasking and windowing capability. The video hardware in these two computers could render graphics in {{hundreds or thousands of}} colors in high resolution. The Amiga had dedicated graphics and sound coprocessors for high performance video and audio. It found use as a workstation for motion video, a first for a standalone computer costing far less than dedicated motion-video processing equipment. Stereo sound became standard for the first time; the Atari ST gained popularity as an affordable alternative for MIDI equipment for the production of music. After a slow start the ST and Amiga gained traction in the market as software developers increased support for them. In following years both lines would be advanced using the faster, fully 32-bit successors of the Motorola 68000 CPU.|$|E

40|$|To harvest {{increasing}} {{levels of}} ILP {{while maintaining a}} <b>fast</b> <b>clock,</b> clustered microarchitectures have been proposed. However, the <b>fast</b> <b>clock</b> enabled by clustering comes {{at the cost of}} multiple cycles to communicate values among clusters. A chief performance limiter of a clustered microarchitecture is inter-cluster communication between instructions. Specifically, inter-cluster communication between critical-path instructions is the most harmful. The slipstream paradigm identifies critical-path instructions in the form of effectual instructions. We propose eliminating virtually all inter-cluster communication among effectual instructions, simply by ensuring that the entire effectual component of the program executes within a cluster. This thesis proposes two execution models: the replication model and the dedicated-cluster model. In the replication model, a copy of the effectual component is executed on each of the clusters and the ineffectual instructions are shared among the clusters. In the dedicated-cluster model, the effectual component is executed on a single cluster (the effectual cluster), while all ineffectual instructions are steered to the remaining clusters. Outcomes of ineffectual instructions are not needed (in hindsight) ...|$|E

40|$|Memory latency is a {{major issue}} for many modem {{microprocessor}} based systems, including the Hewlett-Packard PA- 8000. Due to its <b>fast</b> <b>clock</b> rate and wide issue capability, cache misses in the PA- 8000 are very expensive. The PA- 8000 combines out-of-order exe-cution with multiple outstanding memory requests to tolerate memory latency; however, this approach as its limitations. In order to substantially reduce much of the memory latency penalty, the PA- 8000 uses software-based data cache prefetching.

40|$|With {{increasing}} clock {{frequencies and}} silicon integration, power aware computing {{has become a}} critical concern {{in the design of}} embedded processors and systems-on-chip. One of the more effective and widely used methods for poweraware computing is dynamic voltage scaling (DVS). In order to obtain the maximum power savings from DVS, it is essential to scale the supply voltage as low as possible while ensuring correct operation of the processor. The critical voltage is chosen such that under a worst-case scenario of process and environmental variations, the processor always operates correctly. However, this approach leads to a very conservative supply voltage since such a worst-case combination of different variabilities will be very rare. In this paper, we propose a new approach to DVS, called Razor, based on dynamic detection and correction of circuit timing errors. The key idea of Razor is to tune the supply voltage by monitoring the error rate during circuit operation, thereby eliminating the need for voltage margins and exploiting the data dependence of circuit delay. A Razor flip-flop is introduced that double-samples pipeline stage values, once with a <b>fast</b> <b>clock</b> and again with a time-borrowing delayed clock. A metastability-tolerant comparator then validates latch values sampled with the <b>fast</b> <b>clock.</b> In the event of a timing error, a modified pipeline mispeculation recovery mechanism restores correct program state. A prototype Razor pipeline was designed in 0. 18 µm technology and was analyzed. Razor energy overheads during normal operation are limited to 3. 1 %. Analyses of a fullcustom multiplier and a SPICE-level Kogge-Stone adder model reveal that substantial energy savings are possible for these devices (up to 64. 2 %) with little impact on performance due to error recovery (less than 3 %). ...|$|E
