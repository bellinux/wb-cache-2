5|$|Burnt Norton is {{the first}} poem of T. S. Eliot's Four Quartets. He created it while working on his play Murder <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cathedral</b> and it was first {{published}} in his Collected Poems 1909–1935 (1936). The poem's title refers to a Cotswolds manor house Eliot visited. The manor's garden served as an important image within the poem. Structurally, the poem is based on Eliot's The Waste Land with passages of the poem related to those excised from Murder <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cathedral.</b>|$|E

The final burial would only occur on 5 December 1939, when the dictator Getúlio Vargas {{took advantage of the}} ceremony as an opportunity to benefit his own popularity (just as Mussolini had done during Anita Garibaldi's funeral in 1932). Vargas dedicated the funerary chapel <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cathedral</b> of Petrópolis where the mortal remains of the Emperor and his wife were interred.|$|E

5|$|After his cathedral {{church was}} burned down in 1114, Luffa managed to secure King Henry I's {{financial}} help in rebuilding the church. Besides the rebuilding, Luffa built a Lady chapel, which still remains. Other work still extant <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cathedral</b> are the arcades, the exteriors of the clerestory and those galleries that are unvaulted. The art historian George Zarnecki {{has argued that}} the rood screen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cathedral</b> also dates from Luffa's episcopate. Two panels from this work still survive, and depict the meeting of Jesus with Mary and Martha at Bethany as well as the miracle where Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead. The scenes show some resemblance to works in Hildesheim and Cologne, and this resemblance may mean that Luffa was from Germany, or hired sculptors from there.|$|E
