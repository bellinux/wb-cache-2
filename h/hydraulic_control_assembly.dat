40|$|AbstractDigital {{hydraulic}} valve {{system is a}} new kind of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>control</b> valve <b>assembly,</b> which has potential to save energy and improve performance of valve controlled actuators. The typical digital valve system has 4 - 6 parallel connected on/off valves per control edge totaling 16 - 24 valves in the four-way valve configuration. The flow capacities of the parallel connected valves are set according to the powers of two such {{that it is possible to}} achieve 2 N different flow rates with N valves. An alternative approach is to use equally sized valves, which means that N parallel connected valves give only N+ 1 different flow rates. This approach has several benefits, but the number of valves becomes very large. This paper shows that it is possible to implement valve assembly having 128 miniaturized valves, such that it can be installed instead of traditional CETOP 3 servo or proportional valve. Careful electromagnetic optimization and mechatronic design are used together with novel manufacturing methods and new type of power electronics. The prototype is build and experimentally studied and results show that the performance of this kind of digital valve system is superior to traditional four-way control valves in terms of response time and fault tolerance...|$|R

40|$|Safety {{systems in}} {{nuclear power plants}} have become an {{important}} research topic owing to the significant impact of nuclear disasters. Herein, a passive in-core cooling system is proposed to delay the time of fuel melting and to enhance the safety of nuclear power plants during station blackout accidents. The passive in-core cooling system consist of a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>control</b> rod drive mechanism and a hybrid <b>control</b> rod <b>assembly</b> that combines the heat pipes with the control rods. To achieve the unique features of its system, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>control</b> rod drive mechanism is designed using hybrid control rods located inside the reactor vessel. The study deals with the test of a 4 -finger hydraulic-rod control system {{as one of the}} components of the passive in-core cooling system. The experimental study focuses on the force-induced system based on the pressure differential between the grooved cylinders, which controls the elevation of the upper cylinder, i. e., the hybrid <b>control</b> rod <b>assembly.</b> As a result, the stable inlet flow and position were found at each step, yielding a well predicted holding flow, in accordance to the force balance equation. In withdrawal steps, reduced inlet flow was not observed, but reduced pressure was observed due to the narrow gap between the cylinders during the lift delay condition. Drop test results yield good agreement with those predicted by the simple model, resulting in percentage errors within ± 15 %. In the heat removal test, the time taken to reach the maximum pool temperature was increased by approximately 2. 5 times by using the refrigerant as the working fluid of the hybrid control rod. The test shows the behavioral features of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>control</b> rod drive mechanism in conjunction with the hybrid control rod, and the possibility of the in-core application of the hydraulic drive system to PINCs. clos...|$|R

The numerical control servo press performance and <b>control</b> principle of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>control</b> system are analyzed. According to the flow equation of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>control</b> valve, <b>hydraulic</b> cylinder flow continuity equation and the force balance equation of the hydraulic cylinder with load press, the mathematical model of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>control</b> system is established. And the servo press hydraulic system transfer function is deduced.

Immune algorithm is used to optimize new control parameters {{of the system and}} adopt the new optimization results to optimize the system simulation. The simulation result shows that the hydraulic system’s transition time controlled by the immune particle swarm algorithm is shorter than traditional ones, and the control performance is obviously improved.

40|$|Control of Solids Retention Time (SRT) in the {{activated}} sludge process {{is critical for}} ensuring effective wastewater treatment. SRT sets {{the growth rate of}} microorganisms in the {{activated sludge}} process, thereby selecting the microbial composition of the mixed liquor and its settling and treatment properties. The industry has developed various methods to control activated sludge. This study evaluated seven (7) methods to calculate SRT and implemented a simple, straightforward <b>hydraulic</b> <b>control</b> of SRT method. The study was conducted at the 34 mgd Seneca WWTP in Eagan, MN, which operates a plug-flow nitrifying activated sludge process with reduced air-flows in initial zones to enhance phosphorus removal. <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>control</b> of SRT is based on a solids mass balance over the aeration tanks and clarifiers. Specifically, it depends on the influent wastewater forward flow rate into the aeration tanks, the clarifier underflow rate, the waste sludge flow rate and aeration tank volume in service. It eliminates the need for costly TSS sampling at various points in the process, along with its associated measurement variation and time lags. During this study, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>control</b> produced an SRT that agreed with conventional estimation methods, i. e. mass under aeration divided by mass flow rate wasted, when the conventional methods were corrected for solids inventory in the clarifiers. <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>control</b> of SRT provides a simple, real-time calculation to adjust wasting flow rates of return sludge to maintain a target SRT and a stable microbial population. At the Seneca WWTP, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>control</b> of SRT, combined with gently air-mixed inlet aeration zones, simplified process control, reduced O&M costs, and produced an excellent effluent quality that averaged 4. 6 mg/l TSS, 3. 6 mg/l BOD, 0. 58 mg / l total phosphorus and 0. 14 mg/l ammonia...|$|R

40|$|<b>Hydraulic</b> <b>control</b> {{systems of}} {{butterfly}} valves are presently valve-controlled and pump-controlled. Valve-controlled hydraulic systems have serious power loss and generate much heat during throttling. Pump-controlled hydraulic systems have no overflow or throttling losses but {{are limited in}} the speed adjustment of the variable-displacement pump, generate much noise, pollute the environment, and have motor power that does not match load requirements, resulting in low efficiency under light loads and wearing of the variable-displacement pump. To overcome these shortcomings, this article designs a closed <b>hydraulic</b> <b>control</b> system in which an AC servo motor drives a quantitative pump that controls a spiral swinging hydraulic cylinder, and analyzes and calculates the structure and parameters of a spiral swinging hydraulic cylinder. The hydraulic system adjusts the servo motor’s speed {{according to the requirements}} of the control system, and the motor power matches the power provided to components, thus eliminating the throttling loss of hydraulic circuits. The system is compact, produces a large output force, provides stable transmission, has a quick response, and is suitable as a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>control</b> system of a large butterfly valve...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the development of}} a condition monitoring procedure for mechanical parts which involves time series higher-order spectra analysis. Several approaches based on autoregressive (AR) bispectrum, trispectrum and its slices are investigated as data mining techniques in the fault diagnosis of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>control</b> valves. The characteristics of vibration signals obtained from the control valves have been extracted by means of analyzing the 2 -dimensional and diagonal slices of bispectrum and trispectrum, with the main goal of detecting a possible working condition including the normal and fault conditions. The experimental analysis shows that there are distinct bump values {{in the center of the}} two-dimensional slices of trispectrum space in the fault conditions, on the contrast, the bump values disappear in normal condition. Comparisons have been done between trispectrum and bispectrum. Results show the slices of the trispectrum reveal the corresponding bispectrum and its slices for diagnosing the faults of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>control</b> valves. The experimental and theoretical results have indicated that trispectrum is a more suitable tool for diagnosing the faults of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>control</b> valves. ...|$|R
