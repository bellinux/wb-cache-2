5|$|Risk is a {{combination}} of <b>hazard,</b> vulnerability and likelihood of occurrence, which can be the probability of a specific undesirable consequence of a <b>hazard,</b> or the combined probability of undesirable consequences of all the hazards of an activity.|$|E
5|$|The {{areas of}} highest <b>hazard</b> {{are those that}} could be {{affected}} by pyroclastic flows and lahars (see map). These areas, including Hat Creek Valley, are those {{in the immediate vicinity}} and downhill from likely eruption sites. Fallout of ash will affect areas downwind at the time of an eruption. Within the <b>hazard</b> zones, relative <b>hazard</b> is gradational, decreasing away from the location of potential vents.|$|E
50|$|Physical <b>hazards</b> are a subtype of {{occupational}} <b>hazards</b> that involve environmental <b>hazards</b> {{that can cause}} harm with or without contact. Physical <b>hazards</b> include ergonomic <b>hazards,</b> radiation, heat and cold stress, vibration <b>hazards,</b> and noise <b>hazards.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{the domain}} of central {{processing}} unit (CPU) design, <b>hazards</b> are problems with the instruction pipeline in CPU microarchitectures when the next instruction cannot execute in the following clock cycle, and can potentially lead to incorrect computation results. Three common types of <b>hazards</b> are data <b>hazards,</b> structural <b>hazards,</b> and control flow <b>hazards</b> (branching <b>hazards).</b>|$|R
30|$|We {{compared}} the patient characteristics related to HCC development in proportional <b>hazards</b> models (Table  2). Male gender, high {{body mass index}} (BMI), advanced liver fibrosis, low platelet counts, {{and high levels of}} AFP had significant associations with HCC development in univariate analysis (<b>Hazards</b> ratio 5.6, p[*]=[*] 0.0062, <b>Hazards</b> ratio 1.2, p[*]=[*] 0.0086, <b>Hazards</b> ratio 3.8, p < 0.0001, <b>Hazards</b> ratio 0.77, p < 0.0001, and <b>Hazards</b> ratio 1.1, p[*]=[*] 0.0002, respectively). The incidence of HCC development was significantly lower in the patients with PNPLA 3 148  M than in those with PNPLA 3 148 I (<b>Hazards</b> ratio 0.4, p[*]=[*] 0.043). Liver steatosis and amino acid 70 of HCV core affected HCC development slightly (<b>Hazards</b> ratio 2.1, p[*]=[*] 0.067, and <b>Hazards</b> ratio 3.4, p[*]=[*] 0.082, respectively), while the SNP genotype of IL 28 B was not associated with the risk of HCC development (<b>Hazards</b> ratio 0.62, p[*]=[*] 0.31). Stepwise multivariate analysis revealed that male gender, high BMI, low platelet counts, and high levels of AFP had significant associations with HCC development (<b>Hazards</b> ratio 5.5, p[*]=[*] 0.011, <b>Hazards</b> ratio 1.2, p[*]=[*] 0.029, <b>Hazards</b> ratio 0.76, p[*]=[*] 0.0002, and <b>Hazards</b> ratio 1.1, p[*]=[*] 0.046, respectively).|$|R

5|$|According to the Montour County Multi-jurisdictional <b>Hazard</b> Mitigation Plan, a {{major failure}} in the Lake Chillisquaque Dam could cause damage to several nearby communities, such as Strawberry Ridge and Washingtonville. It {{could also result in}} a {{decrease}} in the output of the Montour Power Plant, causing a brownout in the area. A severe failure of the dam is considered by the Multi-jurisdictional <b>Hazard</b> Mitigation Plan to be the most dangerous threat to Montour County.|$|E

25|$|Due to the {{difficulty}} of the rule-making process (which is governed by the Administrative Procedures Act), OSHA has focused on basic mechanical and chemical <b>hazards</b> rather than procedures. Major areas which its standards currently cover are: Toxic substances, harmful physical agents, electrical <b>hazards,</b> fall <b>hazards,</b> <b>hazards</b> associated with trenches and digging, hazardous waste, infectious disease, fire and explosion dangers, dangerous atmospheres, machine <b>hazards,</b> and confined spaces.|$|R
50|$|The {{pipeline}} stalls can {{be caused}} by structural <b>hazards</b> (processor resource limit), data <b>hazards</b> (output of one instruction needed by another instruction) and control <b>hazards</b> (branching).|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{designed}} heuristics {{for applying}} the list scheduling algorithm to processors with complex pipelines. On these processors the pipeline can stall due to resource contention (structural <b>hazards)</b> {{in addition to}} the usual data <b>hazards.</b> Conventional heuristics consider only data <b>hazards.</b> Our heuri-stics reduce structural <b>hazards,</b> too. Code with much instruction-level paral-lelism is optimized to avoid structural <b>hazards,</b> sequential code is scheduled for reducing data <b>hazards.</b> Embedded in a postpass strategy our scheduler removes 60 %{ 100 % of the removable stalls from conventionally scheduled code. ...|$|R

40|$|Travelers have to {{take into}} {{consideration}} a variety of <b>hazards</b> when deciding on a destination. Although some research has considered the deterrent effect of specific <b>hazards</b> such as terrorism, the context in relation to other <b>hazards</b> has not been investigated. The purpose of this research was to investigate the relative importance of a number of travel <b>hazards</b> that may influence people's travel decisions. A sample of 160 British university students, 37 nonstudent scuba divers, and 102 members of the public rated the risk of various travel <b>hazards</b> and whether these would deter them from traveling. Three types of travel <b>hazards</b> were identified using Smallest Space Analysis (SSA) : political, social, and physical <b>hazards.</b> These were moderately correlated, but the greatest deterrence was reported for political <b>hazards.</b> It is concluded that although research should take account of the full context influencing travel decisions, some <b>hazards,</b> such as terrorism, are likely to have a dominant effect...|$|R
5|$|Other {{volcanic}} techniques, such as <b>hazard</b> mapping, {{displays a}} volcano's eruptive history in detail and speculates {{an understanding of}} the hazardous activity that could possibly be expected in the future. At present no <b>hazard</b> maps have been created for the Silverthrone Caldera because the level of knowledge is insufficient due to its remoteness. A large volcanic <b>hazard</b> program has never existed within the Geological Survey of Canada. The majority of information has been collected in a lengthy, separate way from the support of several employees, such as volcanologists and other geologic scientists. Current knowledge is best established at Mount Meager and is likely to rise considerably with a temporary mapping and monitoring project. Knowledge at the Silverthrone Caldera and other volcanoes in the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt is not as established, but certain contributions are being done at least Mount Cayley. An intensive program classifiying infrastructural exposure near all young Canadian volcanoes and quick <b>hazard</b> assessments at each individual volcanic edifice associated with recent seismic activity would be in advance and would produce a quick and productive determination of priority areas for further efforts.|$|E

50|$|There is {{a number}} of {{different}} <b>hazards</b> involved with being a diener. There is approximately six different types of <b>hazards</b> that a diener is at risk for: mechanical, sharp force, electrical, chemical, radiation, and infection. Mechanical <b>hazards</b> categorize harm such as back injury from activity such as transporting cadavers. Sharp force <b>hazards</b> categorize any bodily harm from the use of tools and equipment such as scalpels and needles which resulting in cuts or punctures. Electrical <b>hazards</b> encompass any potential harm in the form of shock from the use of equipment like saws or defibrillators. Chemical <b>hazards</b> include harm from the use of a variety of chemicals used in the autopsy process such as cyanide and formaldehyde. Radiation <b>hazards</b> are related to any exposure from performing x-rays. Infection <b>hazards</b> are due to the potential that a cadaver is infected with any communicable disease.|$|R
