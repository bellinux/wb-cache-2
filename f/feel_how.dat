This has led to numerous faults, as she is unable to <b>feel</b> <b>how</b> much power she is generating. The new action led to an elbow injury, but under Thomas Högstedt it has improved but can still be erratic. This improvement in serving {{can be seen in the}} 2013 Australian Open and following tournaments where Maria Sharapova committed fewer double faults than in previous years.|$|E

500|$|Parliament President [...] John Henry Barrows said, [...] "India, the Mother of {{religions}} {{was represented by}} Swami Vivekananda, the Orange-monk who exercised the most wonderful influence over his auditors". Vivekananda attracted widespread attention in the press, which called him the [...] "cyclonic monk from India". The New York Critique wrote, [...] "He is an orator by divine right, and his strong, intelligent face in its picturesque setting of yellow and orange was hardly less interesting than those earnest words, and the rich, rhythmical utterance he gave them". The New York Herald noted, [...] "Vivekananda is undoubtedly the greatest figure in the Parliament of Religions. After hearing him we <b>feel</b> <b>how</b> foolish it is to send missionaries to this learned nation". American newspapers reported Vivekananda as [...] "the greatest figure in the parliament {{of religions}}" [...] and [...] "the most popular and influential man in the parliament".|$|E

Nan stays with Florence and her brother Ralph, working as their housekeeper. Nan and Florence grow closer during the year they live together, and Nan learns that the [...] previous boarder with Florence and Ralph had a child and died shortly after giving birth. Florence was deeply {{in love with the}} boarder but her affections were not returned. During an outing to a women's pub, Nan is recognised by former fans, to Florence's astonishment, and Nan divulges her own spotty past to Florence. Cautiously, they begin a love affair. Putting her theatrical skills to use, Nan assists Ralph in preparing a speech at an upcoming socialist rally. At the event Nan jumps onstage to help Ralph when he falters, and is noticed once more by Kitty, who asks her to come back so they can continue their affair in secret. Realising how much shame Kitty continues to <b>feel,</b> <b>how</b> much of herself was compromised during their affair, and that her truest happiness is where she is now, Nan turns Kitty away and joins Florence.|$|E
500|$|After VE Day, the Churchills first {{returned}} to Chartwell on 18 May 1945, to {{be greeted by}} what the horticulturalist and garden historian Stefan Buczacki describes as, [...] "the biggest crowd Westerham had ever seen". But military victory was rapidly followed by political defeat as Churchill lost the June 1945 general election. He almost immediately went abroad, while Clementine went back to Chartwell to begin the long process of opening up the house for his return – [...] "it will be lovely when the lake camouflage is gone". Later that year, Churchill again gave thought to selling Chartwell, concerned by the expense of running the estate. A group of friends, organised by Lord Camrose, raised the sum of £55,000 which was passed to the National Trust allowing it to buy the house from Churchill for the sum of £43,800. The excess provided an endowment. The sale was completed on 29 November. For payment of a rent of £350 per annum, plus rates, the Churchills committed to a 50 year lease, allowing them to live at Chartwell until their deaths, {{at which point the}} property would revert to the National Trust. Churchill recorded his gratitude in a letter to Camrose in December 1945, [...] "I <b>feel</b> <b>how</b> inadequate my thanks have been, my dear Bill, who (...) never wavered in your friendship during all these long and tumultuous years".|$|E
500|$|When Chapter 27 premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, {{the film}} was debated {{fiercely}} by critics. A website reported, [...] "the audience's reactions made it obvious that some people would love it and others would not." [...] Andrew O'Hehir from Salon wrote, [...] "Some viewers may well find Chapter 27 sleazy or distasteful, and I won't argue the point. But Schaefer's movie creates its own highly compelling world, which {{is pretty much the}} prime directive in filmmaking." [...] He stated that [...] "Leto almost makes you <b>feel</b> <b>how</b> it happened," [...] and called his acting a [...] "highly compelling performance on many levels." [...] He also enjoyed Lohan's performance. Duane Byrge of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, [...] "Chapter 27 is a smart attempt to distill the twisted psychology and motivation of Mark David Chapman, which we've all superficially gleaned through mass-media reports and intermittent updates on Chapman's incarceration." [...] He praised Leto's acting saying, [...] "Jared Leto is mesmeric as the bloated, deranged Chapman. It's a brilliantly measured performance, evincing the tale of a madman through his own awful rhyme and reason." [...] He also praised Schaefer's direction, the other cast and crew. Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune gave the film three out of four stars saying, [...] "By the end of this modest, strange venture, Leto made me believe it was worth being forced to hang out on the sidewalk with this man, if only to get a creeping sense of what that might've been like." ...|$|E

[...] Visitors are invited {{to look at a}} drawing of the inner structure of the object, and to try to work out how to grind the corn. [...] When turning the headstone, you can <b>feel</b> <b>how</b> the grain lessens the friction enough for the headstone to turn easily, while the roughness of the stone continues to provide enough friction to grind the corn: a paradox perhaps, but it works. [...] However, to allow entry of grain, the central wooden spindle of a quern-stone is by necessity very loosely fitted {{through the hole in the}} headstone, which means that the headstone can move sideways, and young children's fingers must be supervised.|$|E

In 2008 Central Pharmacy, which Aggarwal still owns and operates, was awarded the Best in UK Clarins Gold Salons Award.

She said that being bound still to the desires and suffering that derive from sin {{makes it impossible for}} of God. The Pope commented: [...] "We too <b>feel</b> <b>how</b> distant we are, how full we are of so many things that we cannot see God.

2500|$|By {{the spring}} of 1963, the Ovshinskys had {{exhausted}} the savings with which they had initially funded ECL. [...] Before seeking public funding, Stan wanted validation {{of the importance of}} his work from a well-recognized scientist. [...] He telephoned Nobel Laureate John Bardeen, a co-inventor of the transistor and co-discoverer of the BCS theory of superconductivity. [...] Bardeen immediately recognized the importance of Ovshinsky's work but his schedule did not permit him to visit ECL for five months. [...] Stan replied, [...] "We'll be broke by then." [...] In his place, Bardeen sent Hellmut Fritzsche, a University of Chicago physicist. Fritzsche became very positive in his support of Ovshinsky's work and helped attract other scientists to the Ovshinsky laboratory. As Fritzsche and Brian Schwartz later wrote, [...] "There is a mysterious quality in Ovshinsky's persona that attracts people into his sphere, builds life long friendships and awakens deep respect and devotion. [...] Meeting him leaves each person with a deep impression of his superior intellect, his self confidence, his compassion to improve society combined with his certainty that his vision can be realized. His enthusiasm is contagious. [...] In his presence, you <b>feel</b> <b>how</b> exciting it would be to join him in his endeavors." [...] Among the many famous scientists who came regularly to ECL as friends or collaborators over the next years, were David Adler, Bardeen, Arthur Bienenstock, Morrel Cohen, Kenichi Fukui, William Lipscomb, Sir Nevill Mott, Linus Pauling, Isadore I. Rabi, Edward Teller, David Turnbull, Victor Weisskopf, and Robert R. Wilson. [...] Some joined as consultants or as members of the Board of Directors. [...] Meanwhile, the ECL community developed a uniquely productive, non-hierarchical, multicultural, international environment, reflecting Stan and Iris' social values. [...] In 1964, Stan and Iris changed the laboratory's name to Energy Conversion Devices and moved the company to larger quarters in Troy, Michigan.|$|E
