40|$|Developing new syntheses {{for high}} energy {{polymers}} by attaching nitro groups to preformed polymers and characterizing these polymers are {{the objectives of}} this work. Our efforts have been directed toward two overall strategies. They are (a) nitromercuration followed by demercuration and (b) nitroiodination followed by dehydroiodination or deiodination. Both are illustrated below for a trans- 1, 4 -butadiene unit. ^ ^ Application of the nitration method reported by Corey and Estreicher to diene polymers fails owing to the insolubility of the hydrophobic polymers in the aqueous nitromercuration reagents. Use of water immiscible organic cosolvents gives slow nitromercuration with substantial amounts of nitrate esters formed. To overcome these problems, a non-aqueous phase transfer catalyzed method for rapid selective nitromercuration of diene polymers, poly(cis- 1, 4 -butadiene), <b>hydroxy-terminated</b> <b>polybutadiene,</b> and carboxy-terminated poly(butadiene-co-acrylonitrile), has been developed. ^ Conducting the dinitrogen tetroxide - alkene reaction in ether {{in the presence of}} iodine has been found to produce (beta) -nitroalkyl iodides which can be transformed into either nitroalkenes or nitroalkanes easily when treated with base or reducing agent, such as sodium borohydride, respectively.
