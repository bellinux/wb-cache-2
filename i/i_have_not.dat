5|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> {{the least}} doubt {{that if these}} Vagabonds can be stopped they must.... Let us be the {{sledge-hammer}} in this, or I shall be beset by hundreds of the same crew when I {{come out with a}} long story.|$|E
5|$|I neither fear nor eschame to say, is {{the most}} perfect school of Christ that ever was in the earth {{since the days of}} the apostles. In other places I confess Christ to be truly preached; but manners and {{religion}} so sincerely reformed, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> yet seen in any other place...|$|E
5|$|As to Captain Benbow, I {{know of no}} {{difference}} between him and me, nor have we had any. He has no small obligation to me, but being called {{in some of the}} foolish printed papers ‘the famous Captain Benbow’, I suppose has put him a little out of himself, and has made him play the fool, as I guess, in some of his letters. I will not farther now particularize this business, but time will show <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> been in the wrong, unless being too kind to an ungrateful man.|$|E
6000|$|... "That 's very true," [...] said Roderick, serenely. [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> come to Rome, <b>I</b> would <b>n't</b> <b>have</b> risen, and if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> risen, <b>I</b> should <b>n't</b> <b>have</b> fallen." ...|$|R
60|$|JACK. [Clasping his head.] But I can't {{give you}} what <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>n't</b> got. Don't <b>I</b> tell you <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>n't</b> a beastly cent.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> even drawn my revolver--I <b>had</b> {{forgotten}} it. <b>I</b> {{was covered}} with coaly mud--knees, elbows, shoulders, back. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> even drawn my revolver! [...] .|$|R
5|$|I hope <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> exaggerated {{in talking}} about Liszt; he won't make me {{anything}} wonderful, so that I can come home and set the Thames on fire—not at all, so don't expect it; but—his readings or interpretations are greater and higher than anyone else's; if I can {{spend some time with}} him and go through a good deal of music with him, I shall pick up at least a great deal of his ideas;... The two or three lessons I had of him this summer showed me what an immensity I might learn.|$|E
5|$|The rest of {{this edition}} <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> read, but, from the little that I have seen, I think it not {{dangerous}} to declare that, in my opinion, its pomp recommends it more than its accuracy. There is no distinction made between the ancient reading, and the innovations of the editor; {{there is no reason}} given for any of the alterations which are made; the emendations of former editions are adopted without any acknowledgement, and few of the difficulties are removed which have hitherto embarrassed the readers of Shakespeare.|$|E
25|$|So long as <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> {{kept all}} the precepts purely, I will not {{participate}} in any lay donor's Buddhist meetings.|$|E
60|$|It {{was with}} some {{bitterness}} {{in my heart}} that I answered that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not,</b> that as yet <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> seen any opportunity of sending letters to anybody.|$|R
6000|$|... "And who was it, then?" [...] said Ursula; [...] "for if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> {{been sent}} for, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> been {{here at this}} time of night, I promise you!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Maurice, Maurice! as if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> been a most provoking, presuming sister-in-law. As if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> acted {{so that if}} Albinia {{ever had}} a temper, she must have shown it.' ...|$|R
25|$|Finegan told me {{you would}} be down to-night, but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> been so {{fortunate}} as to come across you.|$|E
25|$|So long as <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> {{attained}} {{the stage}} where my six faculties are pure, I will not venture out into the world.|$|E
25|$|So long as <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> {{attained}} wisdom (lit. hannya 般若), I {{will not}} participate in worldly affairs unless it be to benefit others.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> {{been her}} friend <b>had</b> <b>I</b> <b>not</b> obeyed her without question.|$|R
6000|$|FENWICK. Know it? Do {{you think}} I cannot guess? Do you think <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> heard he {{followed}} you? Do you think <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> suffered--O, suffered! George Austin is the man. Dear shall he pay it! ...|$|R
60|$|I {{dismounted}} as lightly as if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> ridden lately {{more than}} just the ten miles from Pagliano. Indeed, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> become unconscious of all fatigue, entirely oblivious of the fact that for three nights now <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> slept--save for the three hours at Bologna.|$|R
25|$|Mrs. Adams {{reads it}} with great delight, and reads {{to me what}} she finds interesting, and that is, indeed, the whole book. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> time to hear it all.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> quite done my big {{portrait}} of the two wonderful young women, one of them having been ill, but she is mending. I still {{hope it will be}} a respectable picture.|$|E
25|$|Any chametz or leaven {{that is in}} my {{possession}} which <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> {{seen and}} have not removed and do not know about should be annulled and become ownerless like the dust of the earth.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> seen {{moonlight}} and daylight together before, but <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> seen {{daylight and}} black night elbow to elbow before. At least <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> seen the daylight resting upon an object sufficiently close at hand, before, {{to make the}} contrast startling and at war with nature.|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> been at Killaloe when Mr. Monk was here, {{and if we}} had not,--had not,--oh dear, if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> {{loved you}} so very much, you might have {{remained}} in London, and that lady would have been your wife." ...|$|R
60|$|Antoinette's {{eyes filled}} with tears,--tears of pride, of humiliation, ay, and of an anger of which <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> thought her capable. She was indeed a superb {{creature}} then, a personage <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> imagined. Gathering up her gown, she passed Auguste and turned on him swiftly.|$|R
25|$|Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha {{extended}} his congratulations to Trump saying: We {{have to adjust}} to change. Things keep changing. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> been indifferent to change. Instead, I have been keeping abreast of it.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> as {{yet been}} able to {{discover}} the reason for these properties of gravity from phenomena, and I do not feign hypotheses. For whatever is not deduced from the phenomena must be called a hypothesis; and hypotheses, whether metaphysical or physical, or based on occult qualities, or mechanical, {{have no place in}} experimental philosophy. In this philosophy particular propositions are inferred from the phenomena, and afterwards rendered general by induction.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> met John Snow, the {{outstanding}} personality and most dominating cricketer of the 1970-71 Anglo-Australian series...To me, {{he is one}} of the most faithful and effective servants Nemesis ever employed...Never did he lose that aura of menace. When he loped in to bowl he wore malevolence like Mandrake wore a cloak...But for him, Redpath, Walters, Ian Chappell and probably even Paul Sheahan must have bloomed as most of them did against the West Indians in 1968-69.|$|E
6000|$|When at {{last she}} began to speak she hesitated and her {{sentences}} were broken. [...] "I am very sorry--but you see <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> heard from you for a long time--it would be impossible--for me {{to live on the}} plains so far away--even if--even if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> promised Mr. King----" ...|$|R
60|$|Secondly, The {{reason why}} you find me empty of the {{language}} of the learned, I mean their sentences and words which others use, is because <b>I</b> <b>have</b> them <b>not,</b> nor <b>have</b> <b>not</b> read them: <b>had</b> it <b>not</b> been for the Bible, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> only not thus done it, but not at all.|$|R
6000|$|... "How else am I to talk {{after reading}} that letter?" [...] she answered, [...] "for what woman can hold her own against a dead rival? Now also I must be indebted to her bounty all my days. Oh! if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> lost the jewels--if only <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> lost the jewels!" ...|$|R
25|$|Men are {{not always}} {{themselves}} and put on their behaviour with their clothes, but if you live with a man on board ship for years, if you are continually {{with him in his}} cabin, your mind will soon find out how to appreciate him. I could forever tell of the qualities of this beloved man, Horatio Nelson. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> shed a tear before the 21st October, and since whenever I am alone, I am quite like a child.|$|E
25|$|Obviously {{it was one}} {{of those}} things that {{reinforce}} that I can't have alcohol. I got away from the one thing that kept me on the straight and narrow and that was my relationship with the Lord. That should always come first. Hopefully some good will come out of this. It just crossed my mind that night, 'Can I have a drink?' Obviously I can't and this reinforces that. Since that night, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> had another thought like that. I know it's something I shouldn't do because it leads to other things.|$|E
25|$|Verbs were {{conjugated}} in {{the past}} and future. The present tense was a compound tense, and was artificial (i.e., it wasn't in the language originally); it was made using forms of the verb ಆಗು/ಆ (= to become). There was a negative mood (e.g. from ಕೇಳ್ - To listen, ಕೇಳೆನ್ = I do not listen, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> listened, I won't listen). Note that the negative mood is devoid of time aspect, and could and can be used with a past, present, or future meaning. Apart from the negative mood, all tenses were formed using personal terminations attached to participles of verbs.|$|E
6000|$|All {{through that}} night, {{one of the}} longest <b>I</b> <b>had</b> ever known (a time of agony and remorse as well as of fear), I blamed myself for {{bringing}} on the wild disorder of the building. [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> gone away, if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> enlarged my plan, the house would now be in order," [...] was the thought which tortured me.|$|R
60|$|This smart reply {{produced}} an effect which <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> anticipated.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> {{actually}} {{entered the}} Shwedagon, but I felt just {{as happy as}} though <b>I</b> <b>had.</b>|$|R
