It was a lapse in judgement for him to get involved with this company. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>he</b> hadn't done it.

500|$|In October Robert Dudley {{returned}} to court, many believed, [...] "in great hope {{to marry the}} Queen". Elizabeth's affection and favour towards him was undiminished, and, importuned by unsolicited advice against a marriage with Lord Robert, she declared the inquest had shown [...] "the matter … to be contrary to which was reported" [...] and to [...] "neither touch his honesty nor her honour." [...] However, her international reputation and even her position at home were imperilled by the scandal, {{which seems to have}} convinced her that she could not risk a marriage with Dudley. Dudley himself had no illusions about his destroyed reputation, even when he first got notice of the jury's decision: [...] "God's will be done; and <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>he</b> had made me the poorest that creepeth on the ground, so this mischance had not happened to me." [...] In September 1561, a month after the coroner's verdict was officially passed, the Earl of Arundel, one of Dudley's principal enemies, studied the testimonies in the hope of finding incriminating evidence against his rival.|$|E
500|$|Tina fell in {{love for}} the first time with a boy named Harry. She spoke about this {{relationship}} in her 1986 interview with Rolling Stone. [...] "It was a basketball game – the school Harry attended was playing my school. I was just graduating from junior high. Well, I looked across the gym and saw Harry, and I {{fell in love}}. My heart was beating so fast. I'm a very bold person, so I ran down to the coach and said, 'Who is number 9?' I just had to have that guy. And he said, 'His name is Harry.' And then he told Harry that I had asked who he was. And Harry looked up at me, and I'll never forget it; it was love at first sight." [...] She recalls he was a playboy,"Harry was real popular and had tons of girlfriends, but eventually I got him, and we went steady for a year." [...] The reason for their break-up she says, [...] "Harry and I broke up because he started playing around. He started dating a girl named Theresa, and by the time he and I got back together, she had become pregnant. He felt he should marry her. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>he</b> had told me his decision himself, but he didn't. One morning I got on the bus to school, and my friend said, 'Did you hear that Theresa and Harry got married?' I had to go a full day without crying. At the end of the day, I cried it all out." ...|$|E

500|$|The next {{race was}} the Breeders' Cup Classic on November 1. Because many leading older horses retired in 2014, {{most of the}} main contenders for the 2014 Classic were the three year olds: in {{addition}} to California Chrome, former foes Bayern, Candy Boy and Tonalist entered. His chief rival {{was considered to be}} the then-undefeated American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt, Shared Belief, a gelding who missed the Triple Crown series due to hoof problems; the two had never faced each other. California Chrome was 4-1 on the morning line, second favorite to Shared Belief. In the race, Bayern bumped into Shared Belief at the start, then took the lead {{for the duration of the}} race. California Chrome was clear of traffic, maintained third place for most of the race, was closing at the end, and finished a very close third, only a neck behind winner Bayern, who won by a nose over second-place finisher Toast of New York. Shared Belief was fourth. Post race analysis noted that California Chrome stayed on the outside throughout the race, and actually ran 44 feet farther than the winner. [...] Sherman spoke in positive terms of the horse's finish, stating, [...] "My horse ran his eyeballs out. He was right there, right down to the money. I thought it was a great effort. He came back strong." [...] Espinoza was less enthusiastic: [...] "On the backstretch I thought I had a chance to win... The last sixteenth [...] was digging as hard as he could, but getting just a little tired. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>he</b> had one more race. It was a little too much for him today." [...] Coburn visited the colt the following day and stated, [...] "He was full of himself. I think he thought he won. And if the race had been just a little bit longer, I believe he would have." ...|$|E
2500|$|Given his {{meteoric}} rise {{in church}} and public office, one historian commented that Taylor {{would be much}} better known if his life hadn't ended at such an early age. His father, who was president of the LDS Church at the time, said in his obituary [...] "I cannot think of anything which <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>he</b> had done differently." [...] John Morgan took his place as one of the presidents of the Seventy.|$|E
2500|$|Following Lille's {{final game}} of the 2010–11 season, a 3–2 win over Rennes, Lille manager Rudi Garcia {{confirmed}} that Cabaye would be departing the club to sign with Newcastle United in England, stating, [...] "Yohan told us yesterday– first me, then the whole group before the game– that he has chosen to join Newcastle. It is a choice that I respect, although <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>he</b> continued the adventure with us." [...] The transfer was confirmed on 10 June 2011, with Cabaye agreeing to a five-year deal with Newcastle. The transfer fee was undisclosed. Cabaye described the move to Newcastle as [...] "fantastic" [...] while also stating, [...] "I have enjoyed great times with Lille, but the time is right now to test myself against the best and playing for Newcastle United in the Premier League does just that." ...|$|E

2500|$|As {{she came}} from a strong legal background, her family [...] "weren't wildly happy" [...] about her desire to become an actress: [...] "My parents were always making me watch Rumpole of the Bailey, going 'You see? It’s just like acting, you make things up, you wear a wig and a funny outfit. Why not the law?' But I just always, always wanted to act, {{as far back as}} I remember." [...] Her joining the Royal Shakespeare Company though, finally won her parents over. However, in a 2004 {{interview}} Oberman noted that her father's death seven years earlier prevented his seeing the development of her career and her national success as an actor: [...] "I've {{come a long way in}} my career since he died and <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>he</b> was here to see it. He was a big EastEnders fan so I know he'd be very, very proud of me." ...|$|E
2500|$|During the 1930s, {{he worked}} with great {{determination}} under considerable pressure on {{the expansion of the}} RAF during the period in which the menace of Nazism rose in Germany. Bullock was personally committed to the policy of expansion and strove, against the pacific temper of the time, to awaken public and Parliament to the need to strengthen the RAF to meet the dangers that lay ahead. Even when Churchill was not in government during the 1930s, Bullock supplied him with figures on German air strength which Churchill used in attacking the Government's policy of appeasement. His supporters included T.E. Lawrence, who wrote in 1934, [...] "Bullock is doing well. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>he</b> was C.A.S. (Chief of the Air Staff) and the Air Council as well!". His achievements have been justly recognised in the accounts of rearmament {{and the role of the}} RAF during the Second World War.|$|E
2500|$|On July 15, 2007, {{after the}} source's death, Novak said on Meet the Press that the unnamed senator was Thomas Eagleton. Political analyst Bob Shrum says that Eagleton {{would never have}} been {{selected}} as McGovern's running mate if it had been known at the time that Eagleton was the source of the quote: [...] "Boy, do <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>he</b> would have let you publish his name. Then he never would have been picked as vice president. Because the two things, the two things that happened to George McGovern—two of the things that happened to him— were the label you put on him, number one, and number two, the Eagleton disaster. We had a messy convention, but he could have, I think in the end, carried eight or 10 states, remained politically viable. And Eagleton {{was one of the great}} train wrecks of all time." ...|$|E

5000|$|At the Casablanca Conference, King {{was accused}} by Field Marshal Sir Alan Brooke of favoring the Pacific war, and the {{argument}} became heated.

2500|$|Henry the Young King died, aged 28, in {{the summer}} of 1183, {{during the course of a}} {{campaign}} in Limousin against his father and his brother Richard. He had just completed a pillage of local monasteries to raise money to pay his mercenaries. He contracted dysentery at the beginning of June. Weakening fast, he was taken to Martel, near Limoges. It was clear to his household that he was dying on 7 June, when he was confessed and received the last rites. As a token of his penitence for his war against his father, he prostrated himself naked on the floor before a crucifix. He made a testament and, since he had taken a crusader's vow, he gave his cloak to his friend William Marshal, with the plea that he should take the cloak (presumably with the crusader's cross stitched to it) to the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem. On his deathbed, he reportedly asked to be reconciled to his father, but King Henry, fearing a trick, refused to see him. He died on 11 June, clasping a ring his father had sent instead as a sign of his forgiveness. After his death, his father is said to have exclaimed: [...] "He cost me much, but <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>he</b> had lived to cost me more." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{was ranked}} {{as the top}} East Yokozuna on the May banzuke, {{the first time a}} Japanese wrestler has held the highest {{position}} since Takanohana in July 2001. He withdrew from the tournament on Day 11 having lost four matches, due to his failure to recover from his upper body injuries and inability to use his left arm properly. Nishiiwa Oyakata, a coach at Tagonoura stable, said that Kisenosato had suffered from a lack of preparation time. [...] "He only had about a week to practice against wrestlers before the meet. You would usually train for about a month after healing from injury, so <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>he</b> had more time. I hope {{he will be able to}} live up to fans’ expectations at the Nagoya basho." [...] The only previous time Kisenosato has withdrawn from a tournament in his 15-year career was the final day of the January 2014 tournament. Kisenosato declared himself fit for the July tournament but lost to Mitakeumi on the opening day and Tochinoshin on Day 3. He then withdrew from the tournament on Day 6 after suffering a left ankle ligament injury in his defeat the previous day to Ikioi. His stablemaster said, [...] "The pain in his left arm seems to be gone but he hasn't been able to put on good sumo." [...] He began full training for the Aki basho with 13 practice bouts with Yago of the jūryō division on September 4, but admitted he [...] "had a long way to go." [...] Shibatayama Oyakata commented, [...] "He is not in a condition to engage in bouts at a sumo tournament. I felt that he was just testing how much he has recovered from his injuries." [...] On September 7 Kisenosato's stablemaster confirmed that he would sit out the tournament, saying [...] "it takes courage to rest, and I hope this break will turn things in the right direction." ...|$|E
