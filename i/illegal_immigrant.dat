40|$|Tatiana Hořavová: <b>Illegal</b> <b>immigrants</b> in the U.

The number of <b>illegal</b> <b>immigrants</b> currently present in the country is estimated to be around 11 million, and the inflow of new <b>illegal</b> <b>immigrants</b> seems unstoppable. Finding and applying the right solutions, however, seems to be highly problematic; this thesis will therefore try to analyze the reasons of such an impasse, and what could be expected in the discussion about this issue. The thesis, aside from a necessary introduction to today's immigration system and demographic characteristics of <b>illegal</b> <b>immigrants,</b> also contains an illumination of the reasons why illegal immigration is criticized. It focuses on four areas of criticism - legal, economic, cultural and security- related, and shows that arguments in the discussion about all these aspects exist for both sides of the debate - one that sees <b>illegal</b> <b>immigrants</b> primarily as criminals and a burden for America, and also the one that tries to defend <b>illegal</b> <b>immigrants,</b> and stresses their right to be treated humanely. The existence of two conflicting concepts pertaining to the approach to <b>illegal</b> <b>immigrants</b> in the USA is in this text further documented [...] ...|$|R

The Sabahan locals refer to the <b>illegal</b> <b>immigrants</b> from the southern Philippines as [...] "Pilak" [...] which means (Filipino <b>illegal</b> <b>immigrants)</b> pejoratively. The cause of this anti {{sentiment is}} due to the Muslims Filipino <b>illegals</b> <b>immigrants</b> who arrived in the 1970s from the Southern Philippines insurgency bringing along their social problems, culture of crime, and poverty conditions as well as taking away jobs, business opportunities and allegedly stealing Sabahan native land (NCR) in the state. This hatred was further strengthened when many of these <b>illegal</b> <b>immigrants</b> were involved in crime mostly robbery, murder and rape.
