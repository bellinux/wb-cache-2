40|$|In {{this paper}} I study the {{business}} cycle implications of alternative <b>insurance</b> <b>technologies</b> using a computable general equilibrium heterogeneous agent environment. I find that the limited monetary arrangement entails larger fluctuations in hours relative to productivity than those that obtain in an identical economy where every risk is costlessly insurable. I also find that in the monetary economy the price level displays a markedly countercyclical behavior. Finally I evaluate the welafare costs of the monetary self-insurance arrangement...|$|R

40|$|We {{characterize}} how public {{insurance schemes}} are constrained by hidden 8 ̆ 5 nancial transactions. When non-exclusive private insurance entails increasing unit transaction costs, public transfers are only partly o¤set by hidden private transactions, and can inuence consumption allocation. We show that e ¢ cient transfer schemes should {{take into account}} the impact of insurance on unobservable e¤ort and saving choices as well as the relative cost of public and private <b>insurance</b> <b>technologies.</b> We provide suggestive evidence for the empirical relevance of these results by inspecting the cross-country relationship between available indicators of insurance transaction costs and variation in public and private insurance...|$|R

5000|$|In 1998, the Progressive Insurance company {{started a}} pilot program in Texas, in which drivers {{received}} a discount for installing a GPS-based device that tracked their driving behavior and reported the results via cellular phone to the company. Policyholders were reportedly more upset about having {{to pay for the}} expensive device than they were over privacy concerns. The program was discontinued in 2000. In following years many policies (including Progressive) have been trialed and successfully introduced worldwide into what are referred to as Telematic Insurance. Such 'telematic' policies typically are based on black-box <b>insurance</b> <b>technology,</b> such devices derive from stolen vehicle and fleet tracking but are used for insurance purposes. Since 2010 GPS-based and Telematic Insurance systems have become more mainstream in the auto insurance market not just aimed at specialised auto-fleet markets or high value vehicles (with an emphasis on stolen vehicle recovery). Modern GPS-based systems are branded as 'PAYD' Pay As You Drive insurance policies, 'PHYD' Pay How You Drive or since 2012 Smartphone auto insurance policies which utilise smartphones as a GPS sensor, e.g[...] A detailed survey of the smartphone as measurement probe for insurance telematics is provided in ...|$|E
40|$|I {{study the}} role played by uninsured {{idiosyncratic}} risk and liquidity constraints in the propagation of aggregate fluctuations. To this purpose, I compare the aggregate fluctuations of two model economies that differ in their insurance technologies only. In one of these model economies liquidity constrained households vary their holdings of a nominally denominated asset in order to buffer an uninsured idiosyncratic shock to their individual production opportunities. In the other economy every idiosyncratic component of risk can be costlessly insured. I find that the limited <b>insurance</b> <b>technology</b> implies fluctuations in output that are 20 % larger, fluctuations in hours relative to output that are 9 % larger, fluctuations in consumption relative to output that are 18 % smaller, and a correlation of hours and productivity that is 15 % smaller than those that obtain under the full <b>insurance</b> <b>technology.</b> ...|$|E

By using garbage as a premium of the insurance scheme, it has served the poor community in  Malang with the free health facilities. By elaborating governmentality theory of Foucault as a theoretical framework, this research is aimed to investigate the means used by Indonesia Medika to shape people’s behavior through <b>insurance</b> <b>technology.</b> Moreover, this study is also dedicated {{to contribute to the}} policy discourse of addressing health access inequality. Using case study as the research design, this research found that Indonesia Medika has produced a risk discourse of <b>insurance</b> <b>technology</b> as government rationality, to govern people. This was implemented through various practices of surveillance, using the body as a target of intervention. Health risk awareness is the targeted conducts upon society, the governed. Despite the wide recognition, both at the national and international level, GCI faced diﬃculties to approach local government, as the part of their strategic alliance. However, this initiative has been considered as an alternative policy in tackling poverty, by creating a certain condition, which stimulates people to govern themselves according {{to the end of the}} state...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{descriptive}} study was to evaluate the banking and <b>insurance</b> <b>technology</b> curriculum at ten junior colleges in Taiwan. The study focused on curriculum, curriculum materials, instruction, support services, student achievement and job performance. Data was collected from a diverse sample of faculty, students, alumni, and employers. ^ Questionnaires on the evaluation of curriculum at technical junior colleges were developed for use in this specific case. Data were collected from the sample described above and analyzed utilizing ANOVA, T-Tests and crosstabulations. Findings are presented which indicate that {{there is room for}} improvement in terms of meeting individual students 2 ̆ 7 needs. ^ Using Stufflebeam 2 ̆ 7 s CIPP model for curriculum evaluation it was determined that the curriculum was adequate in terms of the knowledge and skills imparted to students. However, students were dissatisfied with the rigidity of the curriculum and the lack of opportunity to satisfy the individual needs of students. Employers were satisfied with both the academic preparation of students and their on the job performance. ^ In sum, the curriculum of the two-year banking and <b>insurance</b> <b>technology</b> programs of junior college in Taiwan was shown to have served adequately preparing a work force to enter businesses. It is now time to look toward the future and adapt the curriculum and instruction for the future needs of the ever evolving high-tech society. ...|$|E
40|$|Enterprise-Wide Risk Management (EWRM) is the {{new model}} of risk management, in which the identification, understanding, {{measurement}} {{and management of the}} assortment of risks (i. e., operational, <b>insurance,</b> <b>technology,</b> financial, environmental, etc.) a business is facing is integrated and coordinated across the entire organization. It is a structured and disciplined approach that aligns strategy, processes, people, technology and knowledge with the purpose of evaluating and managing the uncertainties the enterprise faces as it creates value. In the past risk management was highly fragmented from an organizational perspective. EWRM is fast becoming the best practice standard because the traditional approach of managing risk separately or “managing risk by silos ” has proven to be ineffective. This paper provides an overview of recent advances in risk identification and measurement and modern risk management strategies (avoiding, retaining and financing, reducing, transferring or exploiting risk) used by enterprises today.
