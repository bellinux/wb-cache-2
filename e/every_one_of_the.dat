5|$|Having {{finished}} third in the league in May 2003, Given and Newcastle lost 4–3 on penalties to Partizan Belgrade early in the 2003–04 season, meaning that Newcastle failed to reach the group stages of the Champions League.

Given played in <b>every</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> club's league matches for a third successive season, as well as all 13 European games.|$|E
5|$|In 1971 Matlock became Director of Soviet Affairs in the State Department. During Richard Nixon's presidency, {{a period}} known as détente, {{there was a}} {{reduction}} of Cold War tension. Matlock participated in the negotiation of arms control treaties and other bilateral agreements. In fact, he attended <b>every</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> U.S.-Soviet summits for the 20-year period 1972–1991, {{with the exception of}} the 1979 Carter - Brezhnev summit.|$|E

5|$|Lead affects <b>every</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body's organ systems, {{especially}} the nervous system, {{but also the}} bones and teeth, the kidneys, and the cardiovascular, immune, and reproductive systems.

Aside from the developmental effects unique to young children, the health effects experienced by adults are similar to those in children, although the thresholds are generally higher.|$|E

Di Luca's aggressive descent of Prà Martino gave him a gap over the elite group of riders who had been able to hold his wheel to that point, and the stage win. The day saw a big winner in time gains and a big loser: Lance Armstrong finished 29 seconds behind Di Luca in the same group as the man finishing sixth on the stage, gaining seven places in the GC, while Thomas Lövkvist lost over a minute and fell from second to eighth in the GC.|$|E
5|$|After an offseason of speculation, Favre officially {{signed with}} the Minnesota Vikings on August 18, 2009. He {{would go on to}} have a {{landmark}} season in which he surpassed former Vikings defensive end Jim Marshall for consecutive starts at one position, with 291, became the first quarterback in NFL history to defeat <b>every</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> league's 32 franchises since the NFL first expanded to 32 franchises in 2002, surpassed Dan Marino's previous record for four-touchdown games, and was named to his 11th Pro Bowl. The Vikings finished 12-4 and advanced to the NFC Championship game, ultimately losing in overtime to the eventual Super Bowl XLIV champion New Orleans Saints. Despite the loss, Favre set playoff records for pass completions and passing yards previously held by Joe Montana.|$|E

5|$|Southern Rhodesia {{effectively}} {{became the}} entirety of Rhodesia in 1964 when Northern Rhodesia became independent as Zambia. After Southern Rhodesia's colonial government unilaterally declared independence from Britain on 11 November 1965, the anniversary became celebrated as Independence Day. The penultimate Monday in October was designated Republic Day in 1970 following {{the adoption of a}} republican system of government. All of these holidays were celebrated until 1979, when Rhodesia reconstituted itself under majority rule as the unrecognised state of Zimbabwe-Rhodesia. The country's national holidays were replaced soon after with alternatives intended to be more inclusive: President's Day, Unity Day and Ancestors' Day. These were in turn superseded in April 1980, when the country became the recognised state of Zimbabwe. The modern Zimbabwean holiday calendar differs radically from that of Rhodesia, but retains <b>every</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> traditional holidays defined by name in the 1895 Bills of Exchange Regulations, with the exception of Whit Monday.|$|E
5|$|Today, {{several hundred}} {{complete}} genomic sequences of Escherichia and Shigella species are available. The genome {{sequence of the}} type strain of E. coli {{has been added to}} this collection not before 2014. Comparison of these sequences shows a remarkable amount of diversity; only about 20% of each genome represents sequences present in <b>every</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> isolates, while around 80% of each genome can vary among isolates. Each individual genome contains between 4,000 and 5,500 genes, but the total number of different genes among all of the sequenced E. coli strains (the pangenome) exceeds 16,000. This very large variety of component genes has been interpreted to mean that two-thirds of the E. coli pangenome originated in other species and arrived through the process of horizontal gene transfer.|$|E
5|$|With the {{transfer}} of political power, the Rhodesian Army, ZANLA and ZIPRA began to be merged to form the new Zimbabwe National Army. ZANLA and ZIPRA personnel were mixed into new battalions, guerrillas were picked out for officer training, and old Rhodesian units were variously disbanded or earmarked for reform. In some cases the latter meant only a change of symbolism and nomenclature; the Rhodesian Air Force, for example, remained almost all white as the Air Force of Zimbabwe. <b>Every</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> approximately 34,000 guerrillas was promised {{a place in the}} new army. In the meantime they would wait in respective ZANLA and ZIPRA assembly camps around the country with pay and rations identical to those of black privates in the old Rhodesian forces.|$|E

5|$|In January 1448, {{the terms}} of the {{previous}} Captains and Defenders ended, and in the following election the Guelphs rose to political prominence. Being especially adverse to Sforza, they entered peace negotiations with Venice, which, also threatened by Sforza's growing power, was willing to come to terms, albeit dictated by herself. Two of the Ghibellines who helped to found the Republic, namely Lampugnano and Bossi, stirred the populace against the Guelphs in a massive demonstration before the Court of Arengo. The Council of Nine Hundred was forced to abandon its plans for peace, and Sforza was given the go-ahead for his next campaign to seize the Adda River. However Sforza's plans were voted down by the Republic in favor of more traditional tactics, namely besieging Lodi directly. While this happened, the Venetian fleet under Andrea Quirini assaulted the bridge of Cremona. However, Sforza's wife Bianca was there, and led the defense until her husband relieved the city. The Venetian fleet withdrew and entrenched while it waited for the arrival of the Venetian army. Sforza trapped the fleet behind its defenses and, with his unorthodox use of artillery, utterly destroyed or captured <b>every</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> seventy ships. This victory was celebrated in Milan, but the leaders of the Republic still feared Sforza, and sent him off to occupy himself with the Ghiarad'adda region while Lodi and Caravaggio were besieged, hoping that their fall would end the war.|$|E
5|$|Tapp {{is forced}} to move further into the asylum, where he is {{captured}} by Pighead and {{is placed in the}} Shotgun Collar, which is later used in Saw III. Still in the trap, Tapp finds a second victim who is being held by Jigsaw. The victim, Jennings Foster, blames Tapp for being in his trap and thus harbors hatred for him. Tapp finds Jennings in a Pendulum Trap similar to the one used in Saw V. Tapp releases Jennings, who quickly runs away, believing that Tapp would get him killed if he stayed with him. Tapp moves on to find the next victim left behind by Jigsaw. He traverses the asylum and is led to the grave of his former partner Detective Steven Sing. It is there that Tapp discovers that Jigsaw has captured Melissa Sing, Detective Sing's widow. She has become a neglectful parent and is convinced that it is Tapp's fault that her husband was killed. Melissa is found in an Iron Maiden-esque Trap with spinning blades that will mangle her body should the device close on her. Jigsaw informs her that Tapp did not call for backup when searching Jigsaw's lair and that <b>every</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> traps there could have been easily avoided by using standard police procedure, which makes Tapp responsible for his partner's death. Tapp saves Melissa. She says Jigsaw gave her the option to leave Tapp, so she quickly runs away.|$|E
