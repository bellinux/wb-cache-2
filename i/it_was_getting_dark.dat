5|$|At 14:45, {{covered by}} an {{artillery}} barrage and machine-gun fire, the Turkish troops counter-attacked again. The regiment's machine gunners returned fire {{and for a}} short time the battle became a machine-gun engagement. During this time the Wellington Mounted Rifles, to the right, had occupied a prominent hill, but were under heavy fire. To support them, the 3rd Squadron sent two troops to engage their opponents, which they caught {{in the bottom of a}} valley, with enfilade fire. Then in front of the regiment a fresh Turkish battalion was sent to assault them. In some places, the Turkish force got close enough to throw hand grenades into the regiment's defences. These killed or wounded all those defending a small hill, which was then occupied by the Turkish troops, bringing indirect fire onto the rest of the regiment's positions, which by now were becoming untenable. At first, messengers sent to the 4th Squadron asking for assistance failed to get through. Eventually the squadron received the message and charged across the open ground, recapturing the hill. This brought the rest of the Turkish line into range of the squadron's guns. Confronted by the new threat, the Turkish troops retired back to their starting point. McCarroll was ordering a regiment attack on the orange grove when he was wounded in the neck and shoulder, forcing Major Henry Whitehorn to assume temporary command of the regiment. By then <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>dark</b> and the only Turkish offensive action was an artillery bombardment. Instead of attacking, the regiment spent the rest of the day evacuating the wounded and strengthening their lines. Their casualties during the battle were fifteen dead and seventy-four wounded. The next morning it was discovered that Ayun Kara had been evacuated by the Turkish troops.|$|E
25|$|Gray started {{shooting}} indiscriminately, targeting a utility vehicle full of locals {{who had seen}} the Holden house burning and stopped to help. He first shot Vanessa Percy {{several times in the}} back as she ran down the street in terror; she died a few hours later at the scene. He then turned to the three children. He killed the two boys, Leo Wilson and Dion Percy. The boys' sister, Stacey, was critically injured by a bullet to her abdomen, but survived. Ross Percy, the children's father, who had been driving them home after a day fishing when they saw the fire, was fatally shot in the head. Next, Aleki Tali was killed. Gray then entered the home of Tim Jamieson, killing him and another elderly local, former Green Island mayor Vic Crimp. The next victim was James Dickson, who was looking for his dog. Eva Helen Dickson, James' mother, and neighbour Chris Cole went into the road to see what the noise was. Gray shot at both of them, wounding Cole who was in a phone booth calling the police and forcing Mrs Dickson to dive for cover. Mrs Dickson, who had recently had a hip replacement and was unable to walk without assistance, pulled herself along on her stomach using her arms and feet in a ditch to get inside and called 1-1-1 (emergency telephone number). She then crawled back to Cole to tell him help was coming. By this stage, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>dark</b> and the dispatcher advised her to stay inside. Mrs Dickson later received the George Medal for bravery. Help arrived too late for Cole, who died in the hospital.|$|E

2500|$|While {{a member}} of the 2d U.S. Cavalry during the American Indian Wars, he participated in the pursuit of a group of Sioux Indians who had stolen a herd of ponies. On April 1, 1880 the group was located by scouts making camp with the herd at the head of O'Fallon Creek. In what would later be known as the Battle of O'Fallons Creek he was ordered to take ten {{soldiers}} and attempt to capture the complete herd. The soldiers were able to retrieve the herd and cut the Indians off from their horses as well. When the Indian group attempted to get to their horses and escape they were driven away, causing them to separate. In the action one of the Indians was killed and five were captured, while the rest escaped into a nearby group of trees. When Brett and his men tried to approach the trees, the Indians, who had lain down on the ground inside the woods, opened fire on the troops. In the battle one soldier {{was shot in the head}} and one horse was hurt and the soldiers' attack had been repelled. While the soldiers considered their next move, the Indians moved into a more defensible position, although completely surrounded. By this point <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>dark</b> and the soldiers were cold and tired from the day's fighting and they determined it unfeasible to attack. At some point the Indian group escaped from their position without a trace and escaped. For his actions during the battle, Brett received the Medal of Honor, which was presented to him February 7, 1895.|$|E
