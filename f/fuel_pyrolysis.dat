25|$|Pyrolysis is {{a process}} of thermo-chemical {{decomposition}} of organic materials by heat in the absence of oxygen which produces various hydrocarbon gases. During pyrolysis, the molecules of object are subjected to very high temperatures leading to very high vibrations. Therefore, every molecule in the object is stretched and shaken to an extent that molecules starts breaking down. The rate of pyrolysis increases with temperature. In industrial applications, temperatures are above 430°C (800°F). Fast pyrolysis produces liquid fuel for feedstocks like wood. Slow pyrolysis produces gases and solid charcoal. Pyrolysis hold promise for conversion of waste biomass into useful liquid <b>fuel.</b> <b>Pyrolysis</b> of waste plastics can produce millions of litres of fuel. Solid products of this process contain metals, glass, sand and pyrolysis coke which cannot be converted to gas in the process.|$|E

A mathematical model {{has been used to}} examine fluid flows and heat transfer of the aviation kerosene RP- 3 with endothermic <b>fuel</b> <b>pyrolysis</b> at a supercritical pressure of 5 MPa.

Effects of <b>fuel</b> <b>pyrolysis</b> and inlet flow velocity on flow dynamics and heat transfer characteristics of RP- 3 are investigated. Results reveal that the endothermic <b>fuel</b> <b>pyrolysis</b> significantly improves the heat transfer process in the high fluid temperature region. During the supercritical-pressure heat transfer process, the flow velocity significantly increases, caused by the drastic variations of thermophysical properties. Under all the tested conditions, the Nusselt number initially increases, consistent with the increased flow velocity, and then slightly decreases in the high fluid temperature region, mainly owing to the decreased heat absorption rate from the endothermic pyrolytic chemical reactions...|$|E

40|$|UnrestrictedBasic {{understanding}} of the combustion kinetics of jet fuels is critical to optimal design of gas-turbine engines. Because jet fuels contain {{a large number of}} compounds, a current approach to their combustion kinetics is to use a surrogate, containing several compounds, to mimic jet-fuel behaviors. Towards the goal of developing a combustion kinetic model for jet-fuel surrogates, a theoretical study was undertook here, focusing largely on a particular class of surrogate component, namely, the normal alkanes.; To develop a combustion reaction model for fuel surrogates requires a reliable H 2 /CO/C 1 -C 4 combustion sub-model as its foundation. Therefore, {{a significant portion of the}} current work is to improve H 2 /CO/C 1 -C 4 high-temperature combustion model through a critical evaluation of rate parameters, theoretical studies for several key reactions, ab initio calculations of thermochemical properties, and validation tests against a wide range of experimental data.; Notably, the kinetics of reactions CO+HO 2 • → CO 2 +•OH and •OH+HO 2 • → H 2 O+O 2 were studied using a combination of ab initio electronic structure methods, transition state and RRKM theories, and master equation modeling. New mathematical formulations and numerical algorithms for treating asymmetric hindered internal rotation were developed. Rate parameters were recommended along with their uncertainty factors.; On the basis of the updated H 2 /CO/ C 1 -C 4 kinetic model, a detailed kinetic model was proposed for the combustion of normal alkanes up to n-dodecane. The model is valid for fuel oxidation and pyrolysis above 850 K, and was validated against a wide range of experimental data, including <b>fuel</b> <b>pyrolysis</b> in plug flow and jet-stirred reactors, laminar flame speeds, and ignition delay times behind reflected shock waves, with n-heptane, n-decane, and n-dodecane being the emphasis.; Analyses revealed that for a wide range of combustion conditions, the kinetics of fuel cracking to form smaller molecular fragments is fast and may be decoupled from the oxidation kinetics of the fragments. Subsequently, a simplified reaction model containing 4 species and 20 reaction steps was proposed to predict the <b>fuel</b> <b>pyrolysis</b> rate and product distribution. Combined with the base H 2 /CO/C 1 -C 4 model, the simplified model was shown to predict <b>fuel</b> <b>pyrolysis,</b> laminar flame speeds, and ignition delays as closely as the detailed model...|$|E

Each flame presents a minimum in the combined LIF-LII intensity in a region separating the <b>fuel</b> <b>pyrolysis</b> and soot containing regions. Opacity, geometric in definition, and extent of crystallinity measured through both bright and dark field Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) characterizes the thermophoretically sampled material from within this minimal LIF-LII intensity region.

In the normal diffusion flame, rapid chemical and physical coalescence of PAHs results in initial formation of soot precursor particles that are highly crystalline and evolve toward fully formed soot. In the inverse diffusion flame, rapid coalescence of pyrolysis products occurs, producing tarlike, globular structures equivalent in size to fully formed soot aggregates but with markedly less crystallinity than normal-appearing soot.

It presents an endothermic decomposition with possible coke formation. Its additional permeation through the porous structure involves internal convection. This implies very complex phenomena (heat and mass transfers with chemistry). In this paper, the n-dodecane pyrolysis is studied through stainless steel porous medium up to 820 K and 35 bar (supercritical state). The longitudinal profiles of chemical compositions inside the porous medium are given thanks to a specific sampling technique with off-line Gas Chromatograph and Mass Spectrometer analysis. By comparison with previous experiments under plug flow reactor, the conversion of dodecane is higher for the present experimental configuration. The pyrolysis produces preferentially light gaseous species, which results in a higher gasification rate for a similar pyrolysis rate.
