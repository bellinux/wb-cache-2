5|$|Able {{to attack}} the HEIC ships individually, Caroline pulled {{alongside}} Europe at 06:30 and began a heavy fire into the merchant ship, which intermittently replied with her available guns. Within 30 minutes, Europes rigging was tattered, many of her guns dismounted {{and a number of}} <b>her</b> <b>crew</b> wounded or killed. Moving past his now disabled opponent, Féretier next attacked Streatham, which had slowed in an unsuccessful attempt to support Europe. Now alone against the frigate, Streatham came under heavy fire at 07:00 and by 08:00 was badly damaged, with casualties in <b>her</b> <b>crew,</b> her guns all dismounted and her lascars hiding below decks. With further resistance hopeless, Dale hauled down the company flag and surrendered.|$|E
5|$|Captain Rachel Garrett of the Enterprise-C and <b>her</b> <b>crew</b> learn {{they have}} {{traveled}} into the future. Garrett explains {{that they were}} responding to a distress call from the Klingon outpost on NarendraIII, and were attacked by Romulan starships. While his crew works to repair the Enterprise-C and tend to the crew's injuries, Picard and his command staff discuss {{whether or not the}} ship should return to the past. Commander Riker argues that their deaths would be meaningless, but Data suggests that it would be considered an honorable act by the Klingons. Picard discusses the situation with Garrett, who tells him that <b>her</b> <b>crew</b> will serve the Federation in the present. Picard quietly reveals to her that the Federation {{is on the verge of}} defeat and the presence of one ship will make no difference, but if the Enterprise-C were to return to the past they might prevent the war from ever starting. Garrett agrees and announces to <b>her</b> <b>crew</b> that they will return through the anomaly; at that moment, the two ships are ambushed by a Klingon Bird of Prey. Garrett is killed, and her helmsman, Richard Castillo, takes command.|$|E

She fought off attacks by the Luftwaffe, and shot down one enemy aircraft, but {{was forced to}} withdraw to Belgrade. Due to high river levels and low bridges, navigating monitors was difficult, and she was scuttled by <b>her</b> <b>crew</b> on 11 April. Some of <b>her</b> <b>crew</b> tried to escape cross-country towards the southern Adriatic coast, but most surrendered on 14 April. The remainder {{made their way to}} the Bay of Kotor, which was captured by the Italian XVII Corps on 17 April. She was later raised by the Navy of the Independent State of Croatia, an Axis puppet state, and continued in service as Bosna until June 1944, when she struck a mine and sank.|$|E

5|$|For a {{while it}} seemed that Franklin would also be burnt, but <b>her</b> <b>crew</b> were able {{to put out the}} fires. With Brueys killed aboard Orient, Du Chayla now became commander. Both he and Captain Gillet had been seriously wounded and taken below, but he {{continued}} to order the attack.

She finally struck her colours.|$|E

50|$|Apart from minor hull-cracking problems, Dreadnought {{proved to}} be a {{reliable}} vessel, popular with <b>her</b> <b>crews.</b> On 10 September 1970, she completed a major refit at Rosyth, in the course of which her nuclear core was refuelled and her ballast tank valves were changed to reduce noise.|$|R

She spent the war in the Mediterranean, covering the Otranto Barrage in the Adriatic. France, accompanied by her sister ship , was sent to the Black Sea in 1919 to oppose the Bolsheviks during the Russian Civil War. <b>Her</b> <b>crew</b> briefly mutinied in April 1919 from a combination of war-weariness, Communist sympathizers in the crew and difficult conditions. The mutiny and general lack of morale among <b>her</b> <b>crew</b> caused her to return to France later that month. Striking an uncharted rock off the French coast in 1922, she foundered four hours later.|$|E

5|$|From Madras, Müller had {{originally}} intended to rendezvous with his colliers off Simalur Island in Indonesia, but instead {{decided to make a}} foray to the western side of Ceylon. On 25 September, Emden sank a pair of British merchantmen and two days later, captured the collier Buresk, which was carrying a cargo of high-grade coal. A German prize crew went aboard Buresk and she was thereafter used to support Emdens operations. Later that day, the German raider sank two more British vessels. Low on fuel, Emden proceeded to the Maldives to coal. She arrived there on 29 September and remained for a day while <b>her</b> <b>crew</b> replenished her coal stocks. The raider then cruised the routes between Aden and Australia and between Calcutta and Mauritius for two days without success.

The ship left Libau for Kiel on 1 August, arriving there two days later. On 24 August, <b>her</b> <b>crew</b> was reduced further. She was thereafter used as a training ship for naval recruits, until 20 August 1917, when she was decommissioned and used as a barracks ship {{until the end of the}} war in November 1918.
