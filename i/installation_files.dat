500|$|In September 2015, it was {{reported}} that Microsoft was triggering automatic downloads of the Windows10 <b>installation</b> <b>files</b> on all compatible Windows7 or 8.1computers configured to automatically download and install updates, {{regardless of whether or not}} they had specifically requested the upgrade. Microsoft officially confirmed the change, claiming it was [...] "an industry practice that reduces time for installation and ensures device readiness." [...] This move was criticized by users who have data caps or devices with low storage capacity, as resources were consumed by the automatic downloads of up to 6GB of data. Other critics argued that Microsoft should not have triggered any downloading of Windows10 <b>installation</b> <b>files</b> without user consent.|$|E
500|$|In October 2015, Windows10 {{began to}} appear as an [...] "Optional" [...] update in the Windows Update interface, but pre-selected for {{installation}} on some systems. A Microsoft spokesperson {{said that this was}} a mistake, and that the download would no longer be pre-selected by default. However, on October 29, 2015, Microsoft announced that it planned to classify Windows10 as a [...] "recommended" [...] update in the Windows Update interface some time in 2016, which will cause an automatic download of <b>installation</b> <b>files</b> and a one-time prompt with a choice to install to appear. In December 2015, it was reported that a new advertising dialog had begun to appear, only containing [...] "Upgrade now" [...] and [...] "Upgrade tonight" [...] buttons, and no obvious method to decline installation besides the close button.|$|E
500|$|Microsoft {{was criticized}} for the tactics that it used to promote its free upgrade {{campaign}} for Windows 10, including adware-like behaviours, using deceptive user interfaces to coax users into installing the operating system, downloading <b>installation</b> <b>files</b> without user consent, and {{making it difficult for}} users to suppress the advertising and notifications if they did not wish to upgrade to 10. The upgrade offer was marketed and initiated using the [...] "Get Windows 10" [...] (GWX) application, which was first downloaded and installed via Windows Update in March 2015. Registry keys and group policies could be used to partially disable the GWX mechanism, but the installation of patches to the GWX software via Windows Update could reset these keys back to defaults, and thus reactivate the software. Third-party programs were also created to assist users in applying measures to disable GWX.|$|E

500|$|The {{offer was}} {{promoted}} and delivered via the [...] "Get Windows10" [...] application ("GWX"), which was automatically installed via Windows Update ahead of Windows 10's release, and activated on systems deemed {{eligible for the}} upgrade offer. Via a notification area icon, users could access an application that advertised Windows10 and the free upgrade offer, check device compatibility, and [...] "reserve" [...] an automatic download of the operating system upon its release. On July 28, a pre-download process began in which Windows10 <b>installation</b> <b>files</b> were downloaded to some computers that had reserved it. Microsoft said that those who reserved Windows10 {{would be able to}} install it through GWX in a phased rollout process. The operating system could alternatively be downloaded at any time using a separate [...] "Media Creation Tool" [...] setup program (similar to Windows8's setup program), that allows for the creation of DVD or USB installation media.|$|E

[...] While details have changed from version to version, it has always scanned the computer to find what operating system components and software are installed, and compared the versions of those components with the latest available versions. [...] The ActiveX component then executes the downloaded <b>installation</b> <b>files</b> in their silent/unattended mode to install or update those components, and to report {{the success or failure of}} those installations back to Microsoft's servers.|$|E

N-Gage was subsequently reported working on other Nokia Nseries devices, such as N73 and N95.
