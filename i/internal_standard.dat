5|$|Octaphenylrhodocene, , is {{the first}} rhodocene {{derivative}} to be isolated at room temperature. Its olive green crystals decompose rapidly in solution, and within minutes in air, demonstrating a dramatically greater air sensitivity than the analogous cobalt complex, although it is significantly more stable than rhodocene itself. This difference is attributed to the relatively lower stability of the rhodium(II) state {{as compared to the}} cobalt(II) state. The reduction potential for the + cation (measured in dimethylformamide relative the ferrocenium / ferrocene couple) is −1.44V, consistent with the greater thermodynamic stabilisation of the rhodocene by the C5HPh4 ligand compared with the C5H5 or C5Me5 ligands. Cobaltocene is a useful one-electron reducing agent in the research laboratory as it is soluble in non-polar organic solvents, and its redox couple is sufficiently well behaved that it may be used as an <b>internal</b> <b>standard</b> in cyclic voltammetry. No substituted rhodocene yet prepared has demonstrated sufficient stability to be used in a similar way.|$|E
5|$|The works {{had its own}} <b>internal</b> <b>standard</b> gauge railway {{for over}} 100 years, which used three steam and three diesel {{locomotives}} {{over the course of}} its existence, until its replacement by road vehicles in the 1990s. During the 1926 general strike, the locomotives hauled trains over the main line, delivering wagons to Kilnhurst tip under a special dispensation. By the 1960s, the Sheffield sewer system was inadequate for the volume of effluent produced, and the Don Valley Interceptor Sewer was tunnelled beneath the city to the works, enabling 26 storm sewage overflows into the river to be shut down. Water quality was further improved by a new treatment process installed in 1992 to reduce ammonia levels, enabling fish stocks to be re-established in the lower River Don. Subsequent improvements have been made so that the works complies with the Waste Incineration Directive and the Freshwater Fish Directive. The works was inundated by flood water on 25 June 2007, when the Don burst its banks, but was recommissioned in just 18 days.|$|E
25|$|It is {{important}} that the <b>internal</b> <b>standard</b> displays very similar (ideally identical) properties, with respect to detector response (i.e. ionisation), as the analyte of interest. To simplify the selection of <b>internal</b> <b>standard,</b> most laboratories use an analogous stable isotope in an isotope dilution type analysis. The stable isotope is almost guaranteed to be chemically and physically {{as close as possible to}} the analyte of interest, hence producing an almost identical detector response in addition to behaving identically during sample preparation and chromatographic resolution. To this end, the ion suppression experienced by both the analyte and the <b>internal</b> <b>standard</b> should be identical. It {{is important}} to note that an excessively high concentration of stable isotope <b>internal</b> <b>standard</b> may cause ion suppression itself, since it will co-elute with the analyte of interest. Hence, the <b>internal</b> <b>standard</b> should be added at an appropriate concentration.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a systematic {{investigation of the}} viability of using <b>internal</b> <b>standards</b> to correct for chip-to-chip imprecision in disposable microchip capillary electrophoresis (μCE) devices. The effects of two <b>internal</b> <b>standards</b> (CsCl and LiCl) on the reproducibility of Na quantification were explored using in-house fabricated microchips. Five concentrations of NaCl were analyzed consecutively over five days, resulting in a dataset of 900 electropherograms with which to draw reliable conclusions from.

30|$|General topics The {{general section}} {{includes}} historical aspects of SIDAs, the prerequisites {{and limitations of}} the use of stable isotopically labelled <b>internal</b> <b>standards</b> along with possible calibrations procedures.

30|$|Nevertheless, {{automated}} SPME {{also works}} for measuring free concentrations, solventless at pre-equilibrium conditions. Small aliquots (≤ 20 mL) of water samples are filled in SPME vials, tightly closed, and measured subsequently without any additional manual treatment. However, no <b>internal</b> <b>standards</b> {{can be used}} to correct variations during the measuring process, which is challenging when working with mass spectrometry [MS]. <b>Internal</b> <b>standards</b> cannot be used due to their similarity to the analyte. For that reason, the <b>internal</b> <b>standards</b> are also bound by OM, and a correction by <b>internal</b> <b>standards</b> would not lead to the freely dissolved concentration. However, the absence of <b>internal</b> <b>standards</b> is also a drawback in manual SPME approaches. Without internal standardization, ageing of the SPME fiber is challenging, as is the variation of the MS performance. Since a correction method for routine analysis is missing for MS, the alternative is to measure freely dissolved concentrations with more robust detection systems such as GC coupled to a flame ionization detector or an electron capture detector. In addition, due to the fast process, SPME seems capable to easily monitor the course of a BCF study with high temporal resolution.|$|R

25|$|Historically, deuterated {{solvents}} were {{supplied with}} a small amount (typically 0.1%) of tetramethylsilane (TMS) as an <b>internal</b> <b>standard</b> for calibrating the chemical shifts of each analyte proton. TMS is a tetrahedral molecule, with all protons being chemically equivalent, giving one single signal, used to define a chemical shift = 0 ppm.|$|E

30|$|Before extraction, the eel {{samples were}} dried by {{thorough}} mixing with anhydrous sodium sulfate and homogenised. A mixture of 13 C 12 -labelled <b>internal</b> <b>standards</b> {{was added to}} the samples before the extraction procedure. After spiking, the samples were extracted with a mixture of appropriate polar and non-polar solvents for ultratrace-analyses (e.g. hexane/acetone). The extraction was followed by a cleanup procedure using a column system (involving florisil resp. alumina). Further 13 C 12 -labelled <b>internal</b> <b>standards</b> were added to the extract for the determination of the recovery of the <b>internal</b> <b>standards</b> added before. The measurement was taken by means of HRGC/HRMS. For each substance, two isotope masses were measured. The quantification was carried with the use of <b>internal</b> and external <b>standards.</b>|$|R
25|$|Several {{techniques}} use ions {{created in}} a dedicated ion source injected into a flow tube or a drift tube: selected ion flow tube (SIFT-MS), and proton transfer reaction (PTR-MS), are variants of chemical ionization dedicated for trace gas analysis of air, breath or liquid headspace using well defined reaction time allowing calculations of analyte concentrations from the known reaction kinetics {{without the need}} for <b>internal</b> <b>standard</b> or calibration.|$|E
25|$|A common way to {{get more}} {{quantitative}} information out of a mass spectrum {{is to create a}} standard curve to compare the sample to. This requires knowing what is to be quantitated ahead of time, having a standard available and designing the experiment specifically for this purpose. A more advanced variation on this is the use of an <b>internal</b> <b>standard</b> which behaves very similarly to the analyte. This is often an isotopically labeled version of the analyte. There are forms of mass spectrometry, such as accelerator mass spectrometry that are designed from the bottom up to be quantitative.|$|E
25|$|NMR is {{primarily}} used for structural determination, however {{it can also}} be used for purity determination, providing that the structure and molecular weight of the compound is known. This technique requires the use of an <b>internal</b> <b>standard</b> of a known purity. Typically this standard will have a high molecular weight to facilitate accurate weighing, but relatively few protons so as to give a clear peak for later integration e.g. 1,2,4,5-tetrachloro-3-nitrobenzene. Accurately weighed portions of the standard and sample are combined and analysed by NMR. Suitable peaks are selected for both compounds and the purity of the sample determined via the following equation.|$|E

Further 13 C 12 -labelled <b>internal</b> <b>standards</b> were added to the extracts for the determination of the recovery of the <b>internal</b> <b>standards</b> added before.

The respective stock solution was diluted with 50  % methanol in water to obtain a mixture of <b>internal</b> <b>standards</b> containing lamivudine (1  μg/ml), zidovudine (1  μg/ml), and nevirapine (2  μg/ml).|$|R
25|$|Ferrocenium salts are {{sometimes}} used as oxidizing agents, {{in part because}} the product ferrocene is fairly inert and readily separated from ionic products. Substituents on the cyclopentadienyl ligands alters the redox potential in the expected way: electron-withdrawing groups such as a carboxylic acid shift the potential in the anodic direction (i.e. made more positive), whereas electron-releasing groups such as methyl groups shift the potential in the cathodic direction (more negative). Thus, decamethylferrocene is much more easily oxidised than ferrocene and can even be oxidised to the corresponding dication. Ferrocene is often used as an <b>internal</b> <b>standard</b> for calibrating redox potentials in non-aqueous electrochemistry.|$|E
25|$|The {{colliery}} had {{an extensive}} <b>internal</b> <b>standard</b> gauge rail network, {{connected to the}} mainline at Snowdown and Nonington Halt. The line was operated by steam locomotives, the last of which survived in working condition after the demise of steam traction on the national mainline in 1968. The colliery railway was by then using a mixed fleet of steam and diesel locomotives, with the final steam withdrawals {{taking place in the}} late 1970s. The final three steam locomotives were named after saints with nearby Canterbury connections. St Thomas (named for St Thomas of Canterbury), St Dunstan (named for Dunstan, also a medieval Archbishop of Canterbury), and St Martin (named for St Martin, patron of England's oldest parish church, St Martin's Church, Canterbury). The colliery railway network was dismantled following the closure of the colliery in 1987. St Thomas and St Dunstan both survive into preservation. St Martin, which had been badly damaged when its tanks were left full of water which froze on a winter night, was scrapped.|$|E

The recoveries of the individual <b>internal</b> <b>standards</b> of PCDD/F and PCB congeners were determined by adding the recovery standards just before mass spectral analysis. The recoveries of the <b>internal</b> <b>standards</b> were 60 – 120  %. The limits of quantification (LOQ) for individual congeners were determined by a signal-to-noise ratio of 3 : 1 [based on Commission regulation (EU) No 252 / 2012] in the chromatogram or in case of analyte peak existing in the blank sample, concentration of the analyte in blank sample.|$|R

2500|$|Inside PGP Inc., {{there was}} still concern about patent issues. RSADSI was {{challenging}} {{the continuation of the}} Viacrypt RSA license to the newly merged firm. The company adopted an informal <b>internal</b> <b>standard</b> they called [...] "Unencumbered PGP" [...] which would [...] "use no algorithm with licensing difficulties". [...] Because of PGP encryption's importance worldwide, many wanted to write their own software that would interoperate with PGP 5. Zimmermann became convinced that an open standard for PGP encryption was critical for them and for the cryptographic community as a whole. In July 1997, PGP Inc. proposed to the IETF that there be a standard called OpenPGP. They gave the IETF permission to use the name OpenPGP to describe this new standard as well as any program that supported the standard. The IETF accepted the proposal and started the OpenPGP Working Group.|$|E
50|$|In {{experiments}} comprising several gels, {{a common}} technique is {{to include an}} <b>internal</b> <b>standard</b> in each gel.

30|$|When {{considering}} derivatisation reagents for quantitative studies, {{the use of}} <b>internal</b> <b>standards</b> are important, as they {{compensate for}} variations in the sample work-up procedure {{as well as in}} detector response (Remane et al. 2010). Studies have reported the use of deuterium labelled isocyanates, generated from thermal degradation of carbamate ester derivatives of the corresponding deuterium labelled amines, as <b>internal</b> <b>standards</b> (Karlsson et al. 1998; Karlsson et al. 2000; Karlsson et al. 2002). However, this process is time consuming and laborious (Karlsson et al. 2005). Therefore, the use of <b>internal</b> <b>standards</b> with deuterium labelled reagents, such as d 9 -DBA or d 18 -DBA as well as d 3 - 1 - 2 MP, have been developed (Marand et al. 2004; Henriks-Eckerman et al. 2002; Sennbro et al. 2004). An increase of instrumental precision for HPLC-MS/MS with the increase of the number of deuterium in the molecule has also been reported (Karlsson et al. 2005).|$|R

50|$|Sometimes an <b>internal</b> <b>standard</b> {{is added}} at a known {{concentration}} directly to an analytical sample {{to aid in}} quantitation. The amount of analyte present is then determined relative to the <b>internal</b> <b>standard</b> as a calibrant.

50|$|This {{ratio for}} the samples is {{then used to}} obtain their analyte {{concentrations}} from a calibration curve. The <b>internal</b> <b>standard</b> used needs to provide a signal {{that is similar to}} the analyte signal in most ways but sufficiently different so that the two signals are readily distinguishable by the instrument. For example, deuterated chlorobenzene (C6D5Cl) is an <b>internal</b> <b>standard</b> used in the analysis of volatiles on GC-MS because it is similar to Chlorobenzene but does not occur naturally.

40|$|Perceptual voice {{evaluation}} {{is a common}} clinical tool for rating the severity of vocal quality impairment. However, the evaluation process involves subjective judgment, and reliability is therefore a major issue {{that needs to be}} considered. When listeners are asked to judge the quality of a voice signal, they use their own <b>internal</b> <b>standards</b> as the references. These <b>internal</b> <b>standards</b> can be variable, as different individuals may have acquired different standards in prior situations. In order to improve the reliability of the perceptual voice evaluation process, external anchors and training are provided to counteract the effect of these <b>internal</b> <b>standards.</b> This study investigated to what extent the provision of anchors and a training program would improve the reliability of perceptual voice evaluation by naive listeners. The results show, in general, that anchors and training helped to improve the reliability of perceptual voice evaluation, especially in the rating of male voices. Furthermore, it was found that anchors made up of synthesized signals combined with training were more effective in improving reliability in judging perceptual roughness and breathiness than natural voice anchors. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
