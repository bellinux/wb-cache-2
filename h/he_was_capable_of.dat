5|$|Although {{he later}} became renowned {{for his ability}} to occupy the crease for hours of {{defensive}} play, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> playing attacking cricket. His highest one day score, a match-winning 146, came in the 1965 Gillette Cup final against Surrey. In his previous Gillette Cup match, the quarter-final against Somerset, Boycott took 32overs to accumulate 23runs.|$|E
5|$|As a batsman, Macaulay was {{reasonably}} good and possibly {{better than his}} statistics would suggest. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> batting well in a crisis but may have been prevented from honing his batting skills by the Yorkshire leadership who wished him to focus on bowling. He generally batted low down in the order after the all-rounders in the team. Macaulay's fielding was also very effective. He was excellent at close range to the batsmen, particularly from his own bowling.|$|E
5|$|Colonel Moor quickly apologized. While General Ewing {{respected}} {{the discipline of}} the German regiment, he preferred a different atmosphere in his own command, better suited to Americans. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> recognizing the military tradition of other units while accommodating {{the unique needs of}} his own. General Ewing was ordered to North Carolina in 1865, and was planning an expedition up the Roanoke river to co-operate with the Army of the James, when Lee surrendered.|$|E

5|$|During the {{following}} decades Hines drifted between jobs and countries, including spending {{three years in}} the King's Liverpool Regiment and serving as a guide in the Second Boer War, before arriving in Australia in mid-1914. He was a large man and much of his body was covered in tattoos. Hines may also have been illiterate, though <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> signing his name.|$|E
5|$|Nathan Johnson {{was charged}} with simple {{possession}} of methamphetamine and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, and received a $10,000 bond at a bond hearing. Some media outlets said the low bond amount indicated authorities did not believe <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> assassinating Obama. On December 16, 2008, Johnson pleaded guilty to one count of possession of a weapon by a prohibited person. Johnson {{was released from the}} Englewood Federal Correctional Institution on March 4, 2010.|$|E
5|$|After the 2004 {{release of}} , Powderfinger took a hiatus, and several members {{played in the}} side {{projects}} Drag and The Predators. Fanning decided to work independently and acted on direction he felt unable to explore {{as a member of}} Powderfinger. Some of his inspiration was derived from a will to see if <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> recording a solo album, considering what he viewed as his limited guitar playing abilities; compared to bandmates Darren Middleton and Ian Haug. The distance from the band, coupled with the more relaxed writing process for Tea & Sympathy helped Fanning to unwind from the stress left over from 10 years working recording and touring with Powderfinger.|$|E

5|$|He {{is known}} to have absorbed the {{abilities}} of Luke Cage, Vision, Red Hulk and Protector, and it is suggested that he also absorbed the abilities of his current Dark Avengers. In his final form, his body grew to the Hulk's size, and like Hulk <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> creating shockwaves by hitting the ground or smashing his hands together. His durability was sufficient to withstand the combined attacks of all the Avengers, and he demonstrated remarkable healing abilities, recovering in seconds after Daisy Johnson used her powers to make his heart explode. He could also turn intangible by manipulating his density, as the Vision does.|$|E
5|$|However, Australian bowlers such as O'Reilly and Grimmett troubled him by bowling at his leg stump, restricting his scoring as he {{had fewer}} {{effective}} leg-side shots. Occasionally, he displayed discomfort against the fastest bowlers. His team-mate Charlie Barnett {{said that he did}} not relish fast bowling, although <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> playing it well in the initial stages of his career. Other colleagues, such as Les Ames, Bob Wyatt and Reg Sinfield, believed that he did not like to face the new ball, and he was occasionally happy for the other batsmen to face the difficult bowling.|$|E
5|$|Sanford's {{opponent}} in the 1992 election was Lauch Faircloth, a former Democrat turned Republican who had served as state Highway Commissioner in Sanford's gubernatorial administration. Enjoying substantial backing from Sanford's Senate colleague, Jesse Helms, Faircloth accused Sanford of being a tax-and-spend liberal bound to special interests. While initial polls showed that Sanford had a comfortable lead over his rival, he lost supporters after an operation for an infected heart valve kept him from campaigning for much of October and raised doubts as to whether <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> serving another term. On November 3, 1992, Faircloth won the election by a 100,000-vote margin.|$|E
50|$|Stefano Mauri (born 8 January 1980) is an Italian footballer. A {{versatile}} midfielder, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> playing {{both as an}} attacking midfielder and as a winger, {{courtesy of}} his dribbling and passing ability. Although predominantly left-footed, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> also <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> striking or passing the ball well with his right foot.|$|R

5|$|Thomas was an {{accomplished}} writer of prose poetry, with collections such as Portrait of the Artist as a Young Dog (1940) and Quite Early One Morning (1954) showing <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> writing moving short stories. His first published prose work was After the Fair, printed in The New English Weekly on 15 March 1934. Jacob Korg believes that Thomas's fiction {{work can be}} classified into two main bodies, vigorous fantasies in a poetic style and, after 1939, more straightforward narratives. Korg surmises that Thomas approached his prose writing as an alternate poetic form, which allowed him to produce complex, involuted narratives that do not allow the reader to rest.|$|E
5|$|A complete, {{tenacious}} {{and consistent}} two-footed player, Nedvěd frequently played as a left-sided, offensive wide midfielder or as a left-winger throughout his career, {{due to his}} crossing ability with his left foot, as well as due to his ability to cut inside and shoot with his right foot, although <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> playing anywhere in midfield due to his offensive and defensive work-rate. He was also deployed as a central midfielder on occasion, {{as well as in}} an attacking midfield and playmaking role, or as a supporting striker, where he excelled as an assist-man due to his excellent dribbling ability, passing range and vision. Primarily known for his powerful shots and volleys from distance, as well as his stamina, he was also noted for his speed, endurance, technique and goal-scoring ability. He was also an accurate set-piece and penalty kick taker.|$|E
5|$|After {{the failure}} of his first marriage, Waugh {{converted}} to Catholicism in 1930. His traditionalist stance led him to strongly oppose all attempts to reform the Church, and the changes by the Second Vatican Council (1962–65) greatly disturbed his sensibilities, especially {{the introduction of the}} vernacular Mass. That blow to his religious traditionalism, his dislike for the welfare state culture of the postwar world and the decline of his health, darkened his final years, but he continued to write. To the public, Waugh displayed a mask of indifference, but <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> great kindness to those whom he considered to be his friends. After his death in 1966, he acquired a following of new readers through the film and television versions of his works, such as the television serial Brideshead Revisited (1981).|$|E

50|$|Chack'n, a small yellow {{creature}} (later recolored green) with extendable legs must traverse {{a series}} <b>of</b> single-screen mazes. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> walking on floors or ceilings but not walls. He can climb steps and traverse high walls by extending his legs until <b>he</b> <b>is</b> {{tall enough to}} pass onto the next step. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> throwing hand grenades to his left or right which, after a short period, explode into a cloud of smoke. Separate fire buttons control rolling {{to the left or}} right. Chack'n is killed if caught by the explosion cloud.|$|R
5|$|Argento {{reportedly}} {{offered the}} lead role of Peter Neal to Christopher Walken, but eventually it went to Anthony Franciosa. Kim Newman felt that Franciosa's casting was fortunate, as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> bringing more to the role than the script asked of him. He also believed that if Walken had been cast, {{it would have been}} more obvious that he was the killer. According to Jones and Daria Nicolodi, the relationship between Franciosa and Argento was a fractious one. In addition, Nicolodi and Argento were romantically involved at the time, but their relationship had suffered over a disputed story credit during the filming of Suspiria. Nicolodi therefore only agreed to a brief appearance in Tenebrae. By her own account, she originally asked for the small role of Jane McKerrowwhich ultimately went to Veronica Lario. Nicolodi was, according to Alan Jones, cast as the woman on the beach in Neal's flashback. Conversely, Thomas Rostock opines that Nicolodi was never intended for that role, only that of Jane. Transgender actress Eva Robin's was later hired to play the woman on the beach.|$|E
5|$|Others like Stroud, Krause and Phillips opine {{that even}} Rommel's {{recklessness}} and disobedience during {{the invasion of}} France benefitted the German cause, while rescuing Hitler's mercurial objectives and inventing the actual application of blitzkrieg ("lightning war"), and it was Hitler who downgraded strategic victory to operational victory. According to Alan J. Levine, contrary to the allegation {{that he was only}} a genius tactician without a good grasp of logistics, Rommel was a clearer thinker than most of his colleagues (shown by his judgements on developing situations), and although he was the most defeatist German general, there was a serious qualification to his pessimism and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> displaying a surprising amount of energy in building the Normandy defense at the same time.|$|E
5|$|There was {{speculation}} during September {{and early}} October 2007 about whether Brown {{would call a}} snap general election. Indeed, the party launched the Not Flash, Just Gordon advertising campaign, which was seen largely as pre-election promotion of Brown as Prime Minister. However, Brown announced on 6 October {{that there would be}} no election any time soon – despite opinion polls showing that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> winning an election should he call one. This proved to be a costly mistake, as during 2008 his party slid behind the Conservatives (led by David Cameron) in the polls. Disputes over political donations, a string of losses in local elections, and by-election losses in Crewe and Glasgow did himself and the government no favours either.|$|E

5|$|Although Roberts {{won four}} Grand Nationals in 1976, he {{continued}} to experience mechanical misfortunes {{as well as a}} horsepower deficit to the Harley-Davidson motorcycles in the mile and half-mile dirt track events. He had been leading the Daytona 200 once again when tire troubles forced him to make a lengthy pit stop, and Johnny Cecotto {{went on to win the}} race. He dropped to third in the national championship as Jay Springsteen claimed the title for the Harley-Davidson team. He returned to England in April 1977, winning four out of six races at the 1977 Transatlantic Match races. Roberts then travelled to Italy where he raced in the Imola 200, leaving no doubt <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> competing at the international level by winning both legs and setting a new track record. He returned to the United States to compete in the Grand National championship where he won five of the six road races that made up the pavement portion of the series. In the road race event at Sears Point, Roberts started the race at the back of the pack and passed the entire field within four laps to win the race. Despite being in contention for much of the season, Roberts was unable to win any of the dirt track events and eventually finished the year in fourth place.|$|E
5|$|Aronofsky {{followed}} his debut with Requiem for a Dream, a film based on Hubert Selby, Jr.'s {{novel of the}} same name. He was paid $50,000, and worked for three years with nearly the same production team as his previous film. Following the financial breakout of Pi, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> hiring established actors, including Ellen Burstyn and Jared Leto, and received a budget of $3,500,000 to produce the film. Production of the film occurred over the period of one year, with the film being released in October 2000. The film went on to gross $7,390,108 worldwide. Aronofsky received acclaim for his stylish direction, and was nominated for another Independent Spirit Award, this time for Best Director. The film itself was nominated for five awards in total, winning two, for Best Actress and Cinematography. Clint Mansell's soundtrack for the film was also well-regarded, and since their first collaboration in 1996, Mansell has composed the music to every Aronofsky film. Ellen Burstyn was nominated for numerous awards, including for an Academy Award for Best Actress, and won the Independent Spirit Award. Aronofsky was awarded the PRISM Award from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation with the National Institute on Drug Abuse for the film's depiction of drug abuse.|$|E
