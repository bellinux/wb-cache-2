5000|$|The tomatillo (from Nahuatl, tomatl) is {{also known}} as <b>husk</b> <b>tomato,</b> Mexican groundcherry, large-flowered tomatillo, or [...] Mexican <b>husk</b> <b>tomato.</b> Some of these names, however, can also refer to other species in the Physalis genus. Other names are Mexican green tomato and miltomate. In Spanish, it is called tomate de cáscara, tomate de fresadilla, tomate milpero, tomate verde (green tomato), tomatillo (Mexico; this term means [...] "little tomato" [...] elsewhere), miltomate (Mexico, Guatemala), or simply tomate (in which case the tomato is called jitomate). Tomatillos are {{sometimes}} called [...] "green tomatoes"; unripe tomatoes may go by the same name, though the fruit is in a different genus.|$|E

30|$|A {{significantly}} higher resolution {{can be obtained}} using TEM, which {{has been used for}} detection of graphene oxide in the tissues of wheat (T. aestivum) seedlings [179], the presence of graphene inside the <b>husk</b> of <b>tomato</b> (S. lycopersicum) seeds [172], localization of C 70 in rice (O. sativa) leaves [145], MWCNTs in root and leaves of maize (Z. mays) and soybean (G. max.) seedlings [129]. Challenges related to TEM comprise low contrast between CNMs and plant tissue structures [130, 151], a complicated sample preparation and the need for analysis of large numbers of samples. Use of fluorescent labels attached to CNTs can significantly improve the feasibility of microscopic techniques [187]. However, this type of chemical CNT functionalization can also lead to alterations of their physicochemical properties associated with altered effects on plants [166].|$|R
5000|$|Home canning, of both {{garden and}} foraged foods, {{is a strong}} {{tradition}} in Appalachia as well; mason jars are an everyday sight in mountain life; the most common canned foods are savory vegetables: green beans (half-runners, snaps), shelly beans (green beans that were more mature and had ripe beans along with the green <b>husks),</b> and <b>tomatoes,</b> as well as jam, jelly and local fruits. Dried pinto beans are a major staple food during the winter months, {{used to make the}} ubiquitous ham-flavored bean soup usually called soup beans. Kieffer pears and apple varietals are used to make pear butter and apple butter. Also popular are bread and butter pickles, fried mustard greens with vinegar, pickled beets, chow-chow (commonly called [...] "chow"), a relish known as corn ketchup and fried green tomatoes; tomatoes are also used in tomato gravy, a variant of sausage gravy with a thinner, lighter roux.

50|$|Physalis pubescens is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the nightshade family known by many common names, including <b>husk</b> <b>tomato,</b> low ground-cherry and hairy groundcherry in English, and muyaca and capulí in Spanish. It is native to the Americas, including the southern half of the United States, Mexico, Central and much of South America. It can be found elsewhere as an introduced species and sometimes a weed. It can grow in many types of habitat, including disturbed areas. This is an annual herb producing a glandular, densely hairy stem up to about 60 cm in maximum height from a taproot. The oval or heart-shaped leaves are 3-9 cm long and have smooth or toothed edges. The flowers blooming from the leaf axils are bell-shaped and about a centimeter long. They are yellow with five dark spots in the throats, and have five stamens tipped with blue anthers. The five-lobed calyx of sepals {{at the base of}} the flower enlarges as the fruit develops, becoming an inflated, ribbed, lanternlike structure 2-4 cm long which contains the berry.|$|E

40|$|The {{growth of}} various {{vegetative}} {{parts of the}} <b>husk</b> <b>tomato</b> cv. `Rendidora' has been studied. The samples for dry mass determination were taken every 1 - 2 weeks. The life cycle of a plant was divided into 4 phases according to the developmental stages of the leaf area. The plants of cv. 'Rendidora' show 2 main types of growth: prostrated and erect.

40|$|The <b>husk</b> <b>tomato</b> (Physalis ixocarpa Brot.) is {{commonly}} cultivated in Central Mexico for its fruits. The plants of cv. 'Rendidora' show sympodial growth after forming 3 - 5 internodes {{in the main}} axis. From there on, each internode is terminated with a node having one flower bud, one leaf and 2 branches (dichasium type of branching). With {{the exclusion of the}} first 3 bifurcations which initiate 4 equal apparent main branches of the plant, each subsequent bifurcation has unequal ramifications: a stronger one which prolongs the apparent main branch, and a weaker one which serves as the origin of an apparent lateral branch. The apparent lateral branches form smaller internodes but these internodes require more time for their growth which is the reason that the plastochron lasts longer in the apparent lateral branches. By forming a smaller number of internodes in the same period of time, the apparent lateral branches reach a lower value of the plastochron index. All apparent lateral branches of a plant produce a greater total number of fruits, but a large proportion of them abscise. Due to this, the harvested fruits come principally from the apparent main branches. The phenology of the <b>husk</b> <b>tomato</b> plant is described. Its short period of development makes possible its cultivation in regions with a limited vegetative period...|$|E

These last flower buds and flowers did not have the opportunity to produce fruits of commercial size. The number of fruits reached its maximum at the 11 th week AE but a great proportion of fruits smaller than 2 cm were shed.

40|$|The {{reproductive}} {{development of}} tomatillo (<b>husk</b> <b>tomato)</b> {{was investigated in}} the conditions of central Poland. The developmental cycle of tomatillo in Poland lasts 20 - 23 weeks, including 6 weeks in a greenhouse or a tunnel and is longer than in Mexico (15 weeks). The plant grows well in Poland and is fruiting aboundantly. The cv. Rendidora B 1 was early fruiting and sensitive to drought so it should be cultivated in a garden. Cvs Bujna and Antocyjanowa were medium late or late and suitable for open-field cultivation. Fruit development lasts about 6 weeks. Fruiting was concentrated on the apparent lateral branches of the 1 st and 2 nd order during the large part of a vegetative season. Among the abscised generative organs predominated flowers {{and at the end}} of vegetative season the flower buds. The maximum abscission of flower buds and flowers took place about 2 - 4 weeks after the most intensive flowering and fruit set. The fruits of many individuals are easily cracking. After being abscised they are attacked frequently by Botrytis sp...|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} aimed to {{identify}} the physical and chemical characteristics that determine the state of maturity of the fruit of four varieties of <b>husk</b> <b>tomato.</b> One hundred fruits of the varieties: San Martin, Tecozautla 04, Rendidora, and Diamante, were collected. They were cultivated at a density of 40, 000 plants/ha under experimental greenhouse conditions at the Interdisciplinary Research Center for Integrated Regional Development (CIIDIR), National Polytechnic Institute (IPN), in Oaxaca, Mexico. The plants were grown during the summer-autumn 2013 and spring-summer 2014 growing cycles. The husk filling and elapsed time since the fruit set were considered as indicators of harvest. Fruits were stored at room temperature (25 ± 3 °C), and each week 10 fruits of each variety were selected and analyzed for weight loss, penetration resistance, soluble solids, color, pH and titratable acidity. The statistic results indicate that color parameters a*, h * and color index (IC), were significantly high, and showed a high correlation with the {{physical and chemical properties}} for the state of maturation. The a* color coordinate presented the highest coefficient of correlation with fruit texture, followed by IC and h*. At the same time, a * and CI showed strong correlation with variables weight loss, titratable acidity, pH, and soluble solids.

40|$|México es centro de origen del tomate de cáscara (Physalis ixocarpa Brot.), el cual ocupa el cuarto lugar dentro de las especies olerícolas. La investigación en esta especie es escasa, particularmente en los procesos que ocasionan el deterioro de las semillas almacenadas, fenómeno que provoca una pérdida anual hasta de 10 % de germinación. La presente investigación se llevó a cabo en tres fases. En la primera se evaluaron respiración y contenido de ácidos grasos y su correlación con perdida de germinación y vigor en semillas deterioradas de P. ixocarpa var. CHF 1 -Chapingo, almacenadas hasta por siete años en una bodega sin control de clima. En la segunda fase, se evaluaron las mismas {{variables}} en semillas sometidas a envejecimiento acelerado (deterioro artificial). Finalmente, en {{la tercera}} fase se elaboró un modelo matemático para estimar la viabilidad de semillas almacenadas en una bodega sin control de temperatura ni humedad relativa ubicada en el Valle de México. En la primera fase se encontró que semilla almacenada hasta por siete años perdió capacidad germinativa a una tasa anual de 11 %. El ácido linoleico mostró una disminución constante conforme aumentó el tiempo de almacenamiento, de tal manera que al séptimo año la disminución fue del 94 %. La actividad respiratoria también mostró un decremento constante desde el primer año de almacenamiento. La germinación correlacionó positivamente con velocidad de emergencia de radícula (r = 0. 99; P ≤ 0. 01), actividad respiratoria (r = 0. 79; P ≤ 0. 01) y contenido del ácido linoleico (r = 0. 78; P ≤ 0. 01); así, tanto la actividad respiratoria como el contenido del ácido linoleico están involucrados en la disminución de la germinación y vigor conforme aumenta el tiempo de almacenamiento. En la segunda fase se observó que los tratamientos de envejecimiento acelerado no cambiaron significativamente la composición de ácidos grasos en las semillas. El tratamiento de 50 °C combinado con 65 % de humedad relativa provocó una disminución promedio de 63 % en la germinación, así como un decremento en la respiración a valores inferiores a 0. 1 mL de CO 2 g- 1 h- 1. De igual manera, la velocidad de emergencia de radícula disminuyó 75 % al subir la temperatura de 45 a 50 °C. La respiración correlacionó positivamente con la pérdida de germinación (r = 0. 84; P ≤ 0. 01) y velocidad de emergencia de radícula (r = 0. 98; P ≤ 0. 01); así, la disminución de respiración fue la principal causante del deterioro en semillas envejecidas artificialmente.

ABSTRACT : Mexico is origin center of <b>husk</b> <b>tomato</b> (Physalis ixocarpa Brot.), which occupies the fourth {{place among the}} horticultural species. The investigation in this species is still scarce, particularly about the processes that cause seed deterioration in stored seeds, phenomenon that provoke a annual loss of 10 % in the germination. The investigation {{was carried out in}} three phases. In the phase one, the respiration and content of fatty acids were correlationated with the loss of germination and vigor in P. ixocarpa seeds var. CHF 1 -Chapingo stored from two months as far as seven years in a store without control of both, temperature and relative humidity. In the second phase the same variables were evaluated in seeds with accelerated aging (artificial seed deterioration). Finally, in the third phase, a mathematical model was elaborated to estimate the viability of seeds stored in a store without control of both, temperature and relative humidity. It store is localized in the Valley of Mexico. In the first phase was found that the seed stored as far as seven years missed germinative capacity in a rate annual of 11 %. The linoleic acid showed a constant decrease in accordance with the time of storage, {{in such a way that}} in the seventh year showed a decreased of 94 %. The respiratory activity also showed a constant decrease since the first year of storage. The germination correlationed positively with the speed of root emergence (r = 0. 99; P ≤ 0. 01), respiratory activity (r = 0. 79; P ≤ 0. 01) and content of linoleic acid (r = 0. 78; P ≤ 0. 01). In this way both, the respiratory activity and content of linoleic acid are involved in the decrease of the germination and vigor in accordance with the increase of the time of storage. In the second phase was observed that the treatments of accelerated aging did not change significatively the fatty acids content in seeds. The treatment of 50 °C with 65 % of relative humidity caused a decrease average of 63 % in germination and a decrease in respiration with values lower than 0. 1 mL of CO 2 g- 1 h- 1. Similarly, the speed of root emergence decreased 75 % when the temperature increased from 45 to 50 °C. The respiration correlationed positively with the loss of germination (r = 0. 84; P ≤ 0. 01) and speed of root emergence (r = 0. 98; P ≤ 0. 01). In this way, the decrease in the respiration was the main factor that caused deterioration in <b>husk</b> <b>tomato</b> seeds aged artificially. Finally, in the third phase, the mathematical model showed that the prediction of seed moisture was in a rank from 5 to 14 %, what is adequate to protect the seed longevity. The best calibration of the Ellis and Roberts viability equation was when CH, CW, and Ki were simultaneously optimized with the Simplex method, which, the changes in these parameters were smaller than 4. 6 %, the error was 3. 4 % and the R 2 was high. The seed viability was major or equal than 85 % until 263 d of storage and reached 50 % of viability at fourth years and five months...|$|E
