25|$|Berkeley's biographer, J. D. Davies, wrote after {{examining}} his letters that Berkeley {{appears as a}} 'lively, friendly young man, fully aware of his dependence on the patronage of others, supportive of and loving towards his family, and genuinely enthusiastic to make a success of his chosen career', quoting a letter from William to Charles Berkeley in June 1663: I must assure you <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> so beggarly a trade as this if people serve truly and honestly, as I am resolved I will do, although I am never worth six pence. All my hope is on my dearest brother's kindness.|$|E
500|$|Calvert {{dispatched}} Captain Edward Wynne and a {{group of}} Welsh colonists to Ferryland, where they landed in August 1621, and set about constructing a settlement. Wynne sent positive reports concerning the potential for local fisheries and for the production of salt, hemp, flax, tar, iron, timber and hops. Wynne also praised the climate, declaring, [...] "It is better and not so cold as England," [...] and predicted that the colony would become self-sufficient after one year. Others corroborated Wynne's reports: for example, Captain Daniel Powell, who delivered a further party of settlers to Ferryland, wrote: [...] "The land on which our Governor [...] planted is so good and commodious, that for the quantity, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> better in many parts of England"; but he added ominously that Ferryland was [...] "the coldest harbour in the land". Wynne and his men began work on various building projects, including a substantial house and the shoring up of the harbour. To protect them against marauding French warships, a recent hazard in the area, since the recent founding of New France in the interior (modern Lower Canada of the 18th and 19th centuries, Province of Quebec and Dominion of Canada) along the St. Lawrence River, Calvert employed the pirate John Nutt.|$|E
2500|$|I {{think the}} {{decision}} {{will have no}} impact on people's right to privacy, because I don't regard truthful information in court records published by court order in a newspaper to be private information. If anything, the decision is likely to simply muddle the interesting philosophical questions {{and make it more}} difficult to make real progress on privacy issues. In the case of truthful, non-defamatory information obtained legally, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> possibility of any defensible [...] "right" [...] to censor what other people are saying. It is important to avoid language like [...] "data" [...] because we aren't talking about [...] "data"—we are talking about the suppression of knowledge.|$|E

2500|$|Haddon added, in the {{conversation}} with Terry Gross, [...] "I have to say honestly that I did more research about the London Underground and the inside of Swindon Railway Station, {{where some of the}} novel takes place, than I did about Asperger's syndrome. I gave him kind of nine or 10 rules that he would live his life by, and then I didn't read any more about Asperger's because <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> typical person who has Asperger's syndrome, and they're as large and diverse a group of people as any other group in society. And {{the important thing is that}} I did a lot of imagining, that I did a lot of putting myself into his shoes in trying to make him come alive as a human being rather than getting him right, whatever that might mean." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, certainly. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> {{doubt of}} that. I {{was waiting for}} the man to go, and went in almost before {{he was out of the}} house." ...|$|E
60|$|Yours of to-day received. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> {{probability}} of my remaining here {{more than two}} days longer. If that is too long come down. I passed last night at Richmond and have just returned.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you mean}} don't people buy them? A little--not {{so much as}} I could wish. Writing books, unless one be a great genius--and even then!--is the last road to fortune. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> more {{money to be made}} by literature." ...|$|E

60|$|I feel {{inclined}} to Relativity myself. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> one absolute principle in the universe. I think everything is relative.

And that all things in the universe are just relative to the individual living creature. And that individual living creatures are relative to each other.|$|E
60|$|The {{time of our}} {{sojourn in}} Scotland had drawn towards its close. Though feeble in health, this visit to me has been full of enjoyment; full of lofty, but sad memories; full of sympathies and inspirations. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> nobler land, and I pray God that the old seed here sown in blood and tears may never be rooted out of Scotland.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> {{other point}} of {{importance}} requiring illustration respecting the roof itself, or its cornice: but this Venetian form of ornamental parapet connects itself curiously, at the angles {{of nearly all}} the buildings on which it occurs, with the pinnacled system of the north, founded {{on the structure of}} the buttress. This, it will be remembered, is to be the subject of the fifth division of our inquiry.|$|E

6000|$|... “Certainly; <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> {{doubt that}} that inlet is the pirates’ head-quarters, {{and that they}} are certain to have storehouses there choke-full of plunder. Some of their {{associates}} will in that case be on shore looking after it, and if their ship doesn’t return they will divide the most valuable portion of these stores among themselves, and set fire to all the rest. We have done extremely well so far, but another big haul will make matters all the pleasanter.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} {{speaking}} with Captain Whitney, {{and he says that}} he with his men will certainly stay here, for the present. He sent off a messenger, last night, for six more of his men to join him here; for he still hopes to get news from his native boy, which may set him on the tracks of the bush rangers. You need, however, be under no alarm; for <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> chance, whatever, of the bush rangers returning.|$|E
60|$|And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> {{thought so}} much {{calculated}} {{to make one}} doubt death itself, to feel that sublime doubt which has created all religion--the doubt that found death incredible. Edwin Drood {{may or may not}} have really died; but surely Dickens did not really die. Surely our real detective liveth and shall appear in the latter days of the earth. For a finished tale may give a man immortality in the light and literary sense; but an unfinished tale suggests another immortality, more essential and more strange.|$|E
