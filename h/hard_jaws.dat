40|$|International audienceVolume {{images of}} tongue were {{acquired}} by MRI from one subject uttering a corpus representative of French allophone articulations. Supplementary images of <b>hard</b> palate, <b>jaw,</b> and hyoid bone were acquired by CT. The three-dimensional tongue surface outline was represented, {{for each of}} the 46 articulations of the corpus, by a mesh obtained by fitting a generic mesh to the set of tongue contours traced from the MR images. Jaw and hyoid bone positions were also determined. The set of the 3 D coordinates of all vertices of the tongue mesh constituted the variables on which linear component analysis was applied. Six linearly independent components were found to explain 87 % of the variance of the tongue data. The associated parameters that control the linear articulator tongue model are related to jaw and hyoid positions, and to the actions of tongue muscles such as the genioglossus, the hyoglossus or the styloglossus. In addition, it was shown that the full 3 D tongue surface is predictable from its 2 D midsagittal contour with a mere 13. 6 % increase in the overall full 3 D reconstruction RMS error, which confirms quantitatively previous results. Finally, the tongue volume was found to depart by at most ± 5 % from its mean over the corpus, which supports the hypothesis of tongue tissue incompressibility for speech...|$|R

50|$|The oldest true {{fossils of}} baleen are only 15 {{million years old}} because baleen rarely fossilizes, and {{scientists}} believe it originated considerably earlier than that.

Baleen {{is believed to have}} evolved around thirty million years ago, possibly from a <b>hard,</b> gummy upper <b>jaw,</b> like the one a Dall's porpoise has; it closely resembles baleen at the microscopic level. The initial evolution and radiation of baleen plates is believed to have occurred during Early Oligocene when Antarctica broke off from Gondwana and the Antarctic Circumpolar Current was formed, increasing productivity of ocean environments. This occurred because the current kept warm ocean waters away from the area that is now Antarctica, producing steep gradients in temperature, salinity, light, and nutrients where the warm water meets the cold.|$|R

60|$|Ants, says Mr. Wallace, {{without one}} touch of satire, 'force {{themselves}} upon {{the attention of}} everyone who visits the tropics.' They do, indeed, and that most pungently; if by no other method, at least by the simple and effectual one of stinging. The majority of ants in every nest are of course neuters, or workers, that is to say, strictly speaking, undeveloped females, incapable of laying eggs. But they still retain the ovipositor, which is converted into a sting, and supplied with a poisonous liquid to eject afterwards into the wound. So admirably adapted to its purpose is this beautiful provision of nature, that some tropical ants can sting with such violence as to make your leg swell and confine you for some days to your room; while cases have even been known in which the person attacked has fainted with pain, or had a serious attack of fever in consequence. It is not every kind of ant, however, that can sting; a great many can only bite with their little <b>hard</b> horny <b>jaws,</b> and then eject a drop of formic poison afterwards into the hole caused by the bite. The distinction is a delicate physiological one, not much appreciated by the victims of either mode of attack. The perfect females can also sting, but not, of course, the males, who are poor, wretched, useless creatures, only good as husbands for the community, and dying off {{as soon as they}} have performed their part in the world--another beautiful provision, which saves the workers the trouble of killing them off, as bees do with drones after the marriage flight of the queen bee.|$|R

Then, {{beginning}} in the second round—and {{to the consternation of}} his corner—Ali retreated to the ropes and invited Foreman to hit him while covering up, clinching and counter-punching, all while verbally taunting Foreman. The move, which would later become known as the [...] "Rope-a-dope", so violated conventional boxing wisdom—letting one of the hardest hitters in boxing strike at will—that at ringside writer George Plimpton thought the fight had to be fixed. Foreman, increasingly angered, threw punches that were deflected and did not land squarely.

40|$|The {{association}} between a dendronotid nudibranch {{and the soft}} coral Parerythropodium fulvum fulvum (Forskål, 1775) is described from the Red Sea. The nudibranch is a new species of the genus Marioniopsis Odhner, 1934 (Nudibranchia: Dendronotacea). This species feeds on the alcyonacean octocoral P. f. fulvum, and the slugs do not take zooxanthellae from their prey. The nudibranchs are randomly distributed on the soft coral host, usually one slug per colony, and 24. 5 % of the soft coral colonies found are occupied by slugs. The nudibranch matches the colour of its prey and the gill clusters have a shape {{similar to that of}} the soft coral polyps, and because of these they are very cryptic on its surface. Marioniopsis fulvicola sp. n. is characterized by a thin, elongated body with a smooth dorsal surface, a narrow foot, seven to nine clusters of gills, three to four velar processes per side, 22 – 32 stomach <b>hard</b> plates, and <b>jaws</b> with more than 100 denticles arranged in four to five rows. The radula presents a median tricuspid tooth, a simple first lateral, and the rest of laterals hamate, without denticles.

40|$|Cartilaginous jaws have {{historically}} been considered primitive in comparison to those of bony fishes. Yet sharks are capable of cutting through materials, such as bone and sea turtle shells, which are paradoxically <b>harder</b> than the <b>jaws</b> themselves. To examine feeding mechanisms in sharks, I used finite element analysis (FEA) to digitally reconstruct the jaws of four shark species: the sandtiger (Carcharias taurus), great white (Carcharodon carcharias), tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier) and bull shark (Carcharhinus leucas). I developed a new method for material testing shark jaw cartilage. Using this method I obtained multi-directional species-specific mechanical properties for jaw cartilage and incorporated these data into the models. I also examined differences between species and ontogenetic changes in mechanical properties of jaw cartilage. The data show several adaptations of shark jaws that are discussed in relation to feeding mechanics. Comparison of the jaws of macropredatory species to the crushing jaws of the Port Jackson shark (Heterodontus portusjacksoni) show that there are directional differences in the material properties of jaw cartilage {{that are consistent with}} feeding behaviour in sharks. Furthermore, the data suggest that the jaws of subadult great whites are mechanically vulnerable when handling large prey. Ontogenetic mineralisation of the jaws is thus considered necessary to feed on large marine mammals. This hypothesis is supported by the finding that the jaws of the bull shark stiffen with age. As with the great white, the bull shark undergoes dietary shifts to large mammalian prey. Surprisingly, the data reveal that the jaws of sharks are an order of magnitude less stiff than previously believed. This flexibility is exemplified by the highly compliant jaws of the tiger shark, which are here hypothesised to conform to the shape of turtle shells during biting. Close contact between the jaws and teeth may enhance sawing through hard materials by the uniquely shaped teeth of the tiger shark...|$|R
60|$|Upon {{our arrival}} at the village, we were ushered into Mr Evans' neat cottage, from the windows {{of which is a}} fine view of Playgreen Lake, studded with small islands, {{stretching}} out to the horizon on the right, and a boundless wilderness of trees on the left. Here were collected the ladies and gentlemen of Norway House, and a number of indescribable personages, apparently engaged in mystic preparations for the approaching feast. It was with something like awe that I entered the schoolroom, and beheld two long rows of tables covered with puddings, pies, tarts, stews, hashes, and vegetables of all shapes, sizes, and descriptions, smoking thereon. I feared for the Indians, although they can stand a great deal in the way of repletion; moderation being, of course, out of the question, with such abundance of good things placed before them. A large shell was sounded after the manner of a bugle, and all the Indians of the village walked into the room and seated themselves, the women {{on one side of the}} long tables, and the men on the other. Mr Evans stood at the head, and asked a blessing; and then commenced a work of demolition, the like of which has not been seen since the foundation of the world! The pies had strong crusts, but the knives were stronger; the paste was hard and the interior tough, but Indian teeth were <b>harder</b> and Indian <b>jaws</b> tougher; the dishes were gigantic, but the stomachs were capacious, so that ere long numerous skeletons and empty dishes alone graced the board. One old woman, of a dark-brown complexion, with glittering black eyes and awfully long teeth, set up in the wholesale line, and demolished the viands so rapidly, that those who sat beside her, fearing a dearth in the land, began to look angry. Fortunately, however, she gave in suddenly, while in the middle of a venison pasty, and reclining languidly backward, with a sweetly contented expression of countenance, while her breath came thickly through her half-opened mouth, she gently fell asleep--and thereby, much to her chagrin, lost the tea and cakes which were served out soon afterwards by way of dessert. When the seniors had finished, the juveniles were admitted en masse, and they soon cleared away the remnants of the dinner.|$|R
