5|$|Because of the xenon atom's large, {{flexible}} outer electron shell, the NMR spectrum {{changes in}} response to surrounding conditions {{and can be used}} to monitor the surrounding chemical circumstances. For instance, xenon <b>dissolved</b> <b>in</b> water, xenon <b>dissolved</b> <b>in</b> hydrophobic solvent, and xenon associated with certain proteins can be distinguished by NMR.|$|E
5|$|By Paul's estimate, about 50 or 60 {{doctors were}} {{certified}} by the NBO. The NBO was incorporated in 1999, but Paul allowed it to be <b>dissolved</b> <b>in</b> 2000 {{when he did not}} file the required paperwork with the Kentucky Secretary of State's office. He later recreated the board in 2005, but it was again <b>dissolved</b> <b>in</b> 2011.|$|E

50|$|The {{ability of}} one {{compound}} to <b>dissolve</b> <b>in</b> another compound is called solubility. When a liquid can completely <b>dissolve</b> <b>in</b> another liquid the two liquids are miscible. Two substances {{that can never}} mix to form a solution are called immiscible.|$|R
5000|$|Lipophilicity (from Greek λίπος [...] "fat" [...] and φίλος [...] "friendly"), {{refers to}} the ability of a {{chemical}} compound to <b>dissolve</b> <b>in</b> fats, oils, lipids, and non-polar solvents such as hexane or toluene. These non-polar solvents are themselves lipophilic (translated as [...] "fat-loving" [...] or [...] "fat-liking")—the axiom that [...] "like dissolves like" [...] generally holds true. Thus lipophilic substances tend to <b>dissolve</b> <b>in</b> other lipophilic substances, while hydrophilic ("water-loving") substances tend to <b>dissolve</b> <b>in</b> water and other hydrophilic substances.|$|R
50|$|The {{ability of}} a {{substance}} to <b>dissolve</b> <b>in</b> water is determined by whether the substance can match or exceed the strong attractive forces that water molecules generate between themselves. If the substance lacks the ability to <b>dissolve</b> <b>in</b> water the molecules form a precipitate.|$|R
5|$|Mephedrone can be {{synthesised}} {{in several}} ways. The simplest method, {{due to the}} availability of the compounds, is to add 4-methylpropiophenone <b>dissolved</b> <b>in</b> glacial acetic acid to bromine, creating an oil fraction of 4'-methyl-2-bromopropiophenone. The oil fraction can then be <b>dissolved</b> <b>in</b> dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) and drops of the solution added to another solution of CH2Cl2-containing methylamine hydrochloride and triethylamine. Hydrochloric acid (HCl) is then added and the aqueous layer is removed and turned alkaline using sodium hydroxide before the amine is extracted using CH2Cl2. The CH2Cl2 is then evaporated using a vacuum, creating an oil which is then <b>dissolved</b> <b>in</b> a nonaqueous ether. Finally, HCl gas is bubbled through the mixture to produce 4-methylmethcathinone hydrochloride. This method produces a mixture of both enantiomers and requires similar knowledge to that required to synthesise amphetamines and MDMA.|$|E

5|$|According to the {{procedure}} {{described in the}} 1975 Aron patent, and the Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Encyclopedia, equimolar amounts of dimethylamine and 2-cyanoguanidine are <b>dissolved</b> <b>in</b> toluene with cooling to make a concentrated solution, and an equimolar amount of hydrogen chloride is slowly added. The mixture begins to boil on its own, and after cooling, metformin hydrochloride precipitates with a 96% yield.|$|E
50|$|Copper(I) oxide <b>dissolves</b> <b>in</b> {{concentrated}} ammonia solution {{to form the}} colourless complex Cu(NH3)2+, which is easily oxidized in air to the blue Cu(NH3)4(H2O)22+. It <b>dissolves</b> <b>in</b> hydrochloric acid to give solutions of CuCl2−. Dilute sulfuric acid and nitric acid produce copper(II) sulfate and copper(II) nitrate, respectively.|$|R
25|$|The {{principle}} {{outlined above}} under polarity, that like dissolves like, {{is the usual}} guide to solubility with organic systems. For example, petroleum jelly will <b>dissolve</b> <b>in</b> gasoline because both petroleum jelly and gasoline are non-polar hydrocarbons. It will not, on the other hand, <b>dissolve</b> <b>in</b> ethyl alcohol or water, since the polarity of these solvents is too high. Sugar will not <b>dissolve</b> <b>in</b> gasoline, since sugar is too polar in comparison with gasoline. A mixture of gasoline and sugar can therefore be separated by filtration, or extraction with water.|$|R
50|$|Gold is {{resistant}} to most acids, {{though it does}} <b>dissolve</b> <b>in</b> aqua regia, a mixture of nitric acid and hydrochloric acid, which forms a soluble tetrachloroaurate anion. Gold is insoluble in nitric acid, which dissolves silver and base metals, a property {{that has long been}} used to refine gold and to confirm the presence of gold in metallic objects, giving rise to the term acid test. Gold also <b>dissolves</b> <b>in</b> alkaline solutions of cyanide, which are used in mining and electroplating. Gold <b>dissolves</b> <b>in</b> mercury, forming amalgam alloys, {{but this is not a}} chemical reaction.|$|R

5|$|After the Grand Fleet was <b>dissolved</b> <b>in</b> early 1919, Orion was {{transferred}} to back to the Home Fleet {{for a few months}} before she was assigned to the Reserve Fleet.

50|$|Given a cellulose-containing material, the {{carbohydrate}} portion {{that does}} not <b>dissolve</b> <b>in</b> a 17.5% solution of sodium hydroxide at 20 °C is α cellulose, which is true cellulose. Acidification of the extract precipitates β cellulose. The portion that <b>dissolves</b> <b>in</b> base but does not precipitate with acid is γ cellulose.|$|R
5|$|Elemental iodine is {{slightly}} soluble in water, with one gram dissolving in 3450ml at 20°C and 1280ml at 50°C; potassium iodide may {{be added to}} increase solubility via formation of triiodide ions, among other polyiodides. Nonpolar solvents such as hexane and carbon tetrachloride provide a higher solubility. Polar solutions, such as aqueous solutions, are brown, reflecting the role of these solvents as Lewis bases; on the other hand, nonpolar solutions are violet, the color of iodine vapour. Charge-transfer complexes form when iodine is <b>dissolved</b> <b>in</b> polar solvents, hence changing the colour. Iodine is violet when <b>dissolved</b> <b>in</b> carbon tetrachloride and saturated hydrocarbons but deep brown in alcohols and amines, solvents that form charge-transfer adducts.|$|E

Having {{described himself as a}} reporter, Maxwell married 19-year-old tailoress Mabel Maxwell (unrelated) in a Catholic ceremony at Bellevue Hill, Sydney on 14 February 1921. The marriage produced a daughter, Jean, before being <b>dissolved</b> <b>in</b> 1926 upon Mabel's instigation.|$|E

They each exist as several isomers with dextro- and laevo-rotatory forms that cause polarized light to diverge to the right or the left.|$|E
