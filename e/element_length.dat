But using the above sort of analysis one can calculate the performance given a set of parameters and adjust them to optimize the gain (perhaps subject to some constraints). Since with an [...] element Yagi - Uda antenna, there are [...] parameters to adjust (the element lengths and relative spacings), {{this is not a}} straightforward problem at all. The mutual impedances plotted above only apply to [...] length elements, so these might need to be recomputed to get good accuracy. What's more, the current distribution along a real antenna element is only approximately given by the usual assumption of a classical standing wave, requiring a solution of Hallen's integral equation taking into account the other conductors. Such a complete exact analysis considering all of the interactions mentioned is rather overwhelming, and approximations are inevitably invoked, as we have done in the above example.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{technics}} {{for predicting}} thermal cycle of a quenching {{by using the}} finite element method have been studied by comparing theoretical values with numerical analysis results. The basic equation of a minimum <b>element</b> <b>length</b> for cylinder thermal cycle was proposed, which was able to calculate from informations such as an initial temperature, a radius of cylinder, a heat transfer coefficient and the aimed temperature change at the cylinder surface. The minimum time increment for guaranteeing accuracy was given corresponding to the minimum <b>element</b> <b>length.</b> It was shown that the minimum <b>element</b> <b>length</b> for pipe thermal cycle was replaced by that of cylinder. Temperature distribution in cylinder during quenching process can be sufficiently predicted by the finite element method with the above, mentioned minimum <b>element</b> <b>length</b> and the minimum time increment...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} the <b>element</b> <b>length</b> is {{examined}} in modelling crack growth in fatigue loading of an adhesive joint. This is done for a cohesive element using an expression for the damage evolution developed at the University of Skövde which is implemented using the UMAT subroutine in the FE-solver Abaqus. These analyses are done for pure mode I loading by analysing a DCB-specimen loaded by a pure moment. An expression is developed in which the critical <b>element</b> <b>length</b> {{is dependent on the}} geometry of the specimen (in the form of the wave number of the adhesive joint), the <b>element</b> <b>length,</b> the material properties of the adhesive (in form of the material parameters,,), the load applied (in form of the stress in the crack tip), the time step used in the analysis and the crack growth rate. It is shown that the results converge by decreasing the <b>element</b> <b>length</b> and the time step used. Therefore an expression for the crack growth rate {{as a function of the}} remaining parameters can be determined. Another expression is thereafter developed for the <b>element</b> <b>length</b> needed in order to get a crack growth rate within a certain range of the critical <b>element</b> <b>length.</b> The results show a regular pattern but are not monotone. Therefor two different definitions of the critical <b>element</b> <b>length</b> are tested, either by defining the critical <b>element</b> <b>length</b> as the point where the error is greater than an arbitrary boundary of 1 % of a converged result or where a least square approximation of the error is within 1 % of the converged results. The first method shows a highly irregular result which makes it difficult to develop an expression out of these results. The second method on the other hand gives results that are predictable enough to develop a function out of them. This is done using a regression analysis with all parameters of a third order expression in order to get an expression...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn this study, a {{reliable}} and computationally efficient beam-column model is proposed for seismic analysis of Reinforced Concrete (RC) frames. The model is a simplified version of the Flexibility-Based Fiber Models (FBFMs), which rely on dividing the <b>element</b> <b>length</b> into small segments and dividing the cross section of each segment into concrete and steel fibers. In the proposed model, only the two end sections are subdivided into fibers and uniaxial material models that consider the various behavioral characteristics of steel and concrete under cyclic loading conditions are assigned for the cross section fibers. The proposed model is simpler than the FBFMs as {{it does not require}} monitoring the responses of many segments along the <b>element</b> <b>length,</b> which results in a significant reduction in computations. The inelastic lengths at the ends of the proposed model are divided into two inelastic zones; cracking and yielding. The inelastic lengths vary according to the loading history and are calculated in every load increment. The overall response of the RC member is estimated using preset flexibility distribution functions along the <b>element</b> <b>length.</b> A flexibility factor η is utilized to facilitate selecting the proper flexibility distribution shape.

Three rigid V-plates with V-angles of 60 °, 90 ° and 120 ° were designed and fabricated from steel plates. Blast tests with PE 4 charges ranging from 19 g to 58 g at a stand-off distance (SOD) of 34 mm were performed. The geometric scaling was based on the dimensions of the TM- 57 landmine and the Casspir APC MK II. In the numerical model, the optimum <b>element</b> <b>length</b> for the air mesh was obtained by performing a mesh convergence study on the Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) mesh, and validated using the impulse values measured from a 58 g detonation onto a 120 ° V-plate as it resulted in the highest impulse.

Element lengths of 1. 5 and 2. 0 mm both produced accurate results, though the run-time for an <b>element</b> <b>length</b> of 2. 0 mm was significantly lower.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} our participation in INEX 2010 in the Ad Hoc Track and the Book Track. In the Ad Hoc track we investigate {{the impact of}} propagated anchor-text on article level precision {{and the impact of}} an <b>element</b> <b>length</b> prior on the within-document precision and recall. Using the article ranking of an document level run for both document and focused retrieval techniques, we find that focused retrieval techniques clearly outperform document retrieval, especially for the Focused and Restricted Relevant in Context Tasks, which limit the amount of text than can be returned per topic and per article respectively. Somewhat surprisingly, an <b>element</b> <b>length</b> prior increases withindocument precision even when we restrict the amount of retrieved text to only 1000 characters per topic.

XML {{retrieval}} is {{a departure}} from standard document retrieval in which each individual XML element, ranging from italicized words or phrases to full blown articles, is a retrievable unit. The distribution of XML element lengths is unlike what we usually observe in standard document collections, prompting us to revisit the issue of document length normalization. We perform a comparative analysis of arbitrary elements versus relevant elements, and show the importance of <b>element</b> <b>length</b> as a parameter for XML retrieval. Within the language modeling framework, we investigate a range of techniques that deal with length either directly or indirectly. We observe a length-bias introduced {{by the amount of}} smoothing, and show the importance of extreme length bias for XML retrieval. We also show that simply removing shorter elements from the index (by introducing a cut-off value) does not create an appropriate <b>element</b> <b>length</b> normalization. Even after restricting the minimal size of XML elements occurring in the index, the importance of an extreme explicit length bias remains.

40|$|Abstract. The {{worldwide}} {{progress to}} date in experimental and computational studies on composite frame structures having rectangular concrete-filled steel tube (RCFT) beam-columns and steel girders and braces has revealed their exceptional seismic resistance. In this paper, a computational study to develop reliability-based performance-based seismic design guidelines of RCFT members is presented. A three-dimensional geometrically and materially nonlinear mixed distributed-plasticity finite element formulation is developed for RCFT beam-columns as part of complete composite frame structures. The element stiffness matrices and internal forces are derived using a two-field mixed formulation, where deformation and stress-resultant fields along the <b>element</b> <b>length</b> are interpolated independently. Translational degrees-of-freedom for the steel tube and the concrete are defined separately to allow for differential slip displacement along the <b>element</b> <b>length</b> between the constituent materials, modeling cyclic interface and load transfer response ranging from perfect slip to complete bond. The material nonlinearity of the steel tube and the concrete core is accounted for through assigning comprehensive cyclic nonlinear stress-strain relations.
