In this case, the legal notice at issue did not even mention the names of the beneficiaries. Furthermore, under normal circumstances, property holders are directly aware of legal proceedings regarding their property, either directly or through a caretaker. But in this case, the caretaker was the beneficiaries' adversary - the trustee itself - which could not be expected to give them reasonable notice, and the special guardian was also not required to give notice.|$|R

Museums, like libraries, are adapting to transformations in the larger culture. Mass audiences and corporate sponsorship have become their primary engines of growth and survival. Museums and libraries both are wrestling with the need to democratize and to expand their audiences and to find new sources of funding.

40|$|When I {{say that}} my belief that p is fallible or fallibly justified, do I mean to say only that my belief or my {{justification}} is uncertain, or do I mean to say more than this? This question is useful for navigating the literature on fallibilism in contemporary epistemology. Most epistemologists agree that certainty is a rare commodity, {{and that we are}} error-prone in some sense. They also agree that neither of these things is incompatible with knowledge. But there exists no consensus amongst epistemologists regarding what we mean, or ought to mean, when we describe ourselves as fallible. This dissertation considers some of the myriad things that are, or may <b>be,</b> <b>at</b> <b>stake</b> <b>here.</b> I begin by defending an uncertainty account of fallibility. I then propose an answer to the question: is fallible knowledge possible? This question invites us to consider the reasons for thinking that the concept of knowledge is incompatible with fallibility. For example, what link is there (if any) between the motivations for infallibilism and internalism? How we answer these questions, I contend, depends upon our attitude towards epistemic circularity. I will argue, in effect, that there is no middle path between the traditional Scylla of dogmatism and Charybdis of scepticism. My argument for this is ultimately based on the intuitive incompatibility of knowledge and epistemic circularity. I formulate and defend this argument. Along the way I also weigh the merits of other arguments against different types of fallibilism...|$|R

These are, first, the conversion of the shelf list of the University Library to machine -readable form, and, second, the design and operation of a new type of computer-based circulation system. These activities were initiated and are being carried out at Johns Hopkins as part of an operations research and systems engineering study of university libraries, under the sponsorship of the National Science Foundation. The leadership in initiating and directing this study has from the beginning been that of Robert H. Roy, Dean of the School of Engineering Science and Chairman of the Department of Operations Research of the University. The Project team has been fortunate throughout in having a close and cordial working relationship with the staff of the Johns Hopkins University Library. From providing a field for examination and case study of systems problems, to sympathetic and responsive reception of proposals for action, the Library has been friend, teacher, and subject all at once. This fortunate and indeed essential state of affairs has been due above all to the perception, the vision, and the understanding of the University Librarian, John Berthel.
