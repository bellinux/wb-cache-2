5|$|Of the season's ten {{tropical}} storms, {{seven of}} those strengthened into a hurricane. One {{of the seven}} hurricanes deepened further into a major hurricane, which are tropical cyclones that reach at least Category3 on the modern day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. The second, third, and fourth systems left the most significant impacts during this season. The second storm, which struck Jamaica in August, devastated Martinique, Jamaica, and the Cayman Islands. At least 149deaths were attributed to this storm, while it also caused $10million (1903USD) in damage in Jamaica alone. The third cyclone made landfall in Florida twice in mid-August, leaving 14fatalities and about $500,000 in damage. Only a few days later, the fourth cyclone struck New Jersey. The storm impacted many areas <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mid-Atlantic</b> region of the United States and caused 57deaths and about $8million in damage.

There were also very few juvenile tilefish seen in tilefish population surveys in the southern U.S. waters in both the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico. Declines in population could negatively affect other organisms in their surrounding environment {{due to the fact}} that without tilefish, the burrows underneath the continental shelf will disappear, therefore putting an end to the symbiotic relationship with other organisms that use the tunnels as shelter.|$|E
