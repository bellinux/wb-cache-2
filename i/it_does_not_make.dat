5|$|The poem is an elegy in {{name but}} not in form; it employs a style {{similar to that of}} {{contemporary}} odes, but it embodies a meditation on death, and remembrance after death. The poem argues that the remembrance can be good and bad, and the narrator finds comfort in pondering the lives of the obscure rustics buried in the churchyard. The two versions of the poem, Stanzas and Elegy, approach death differently; the first contains a stoic response to death, but the final version contains an epitaph which serves to repress the narrator's fear of dying. With its discussion of, and focus on, the obscure and the known, the poem has possible political ramifications, but <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> any definite claims on politics to be more universal in its approach to life and death.|$|E

5|$|The Jain {{concept of}} Ahimsa is characterised by several aspects. <b>It</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> any {{exception}} for ritual sacrificers and professional warrior-hunters. Killing of animals for food is absolutely ruled out. Jains also make considerable efforts not to injure plants {{in everyday life}} as far as possible. Though they admit that plants must be destroyed {{for the sake of}} food, they accept such violence only inasmuch as it is indispensable for human survival, and there are special instructions for preventing unnecessary violence against plants. Jains {{go out of their way}} so as not to hurt even small insects and other minuscule animals. For example, Jains often do not go out at night, when they are more likely to step upon an insect. In their view, injury caused by carelessness is like injury caused by deliberate action. Eating honey is strictly outlawed, as it would amount to violence against the bees. Some Jains abstain from farming because it inevitably entails unintentional killing or injuring of many small animals, such as worms and insects, but agriculture is not forbidden in general and there are Jain farmers.|$|E

25|$|Similarly, for Emmanuel Levinas, God is ethics, so one {{is brought}} closer to God when justice is {{rendered}} to the Other. This means that one experiences {{the presence of}} God through oneâ€™s relation to other people.

25|$|In another {{description}} of his view {{on the concept of}} God, Sagan emphatically wrote: The idea that God is an oversized white male with a flowing beard who sits in the sky and tallies the fall of every sparrow is ludicrous.

25|$|The rock-haunting {{ringtail}} possum lives {{exclusively in}} rocky outcrops and prefers areas with large boulders and deeply fissured rock.

It is strictly nocturnal; it only moves out of it sheltered rock crevices to climbing trees to feed at night. <b>It</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> a nest and has been observed occasionally to be sleeping in well protected rock ledges during the day. This suggests {{a high level of}} adaptation to a terrestrial existence. Indicators of a reduction in arboreal adaptation are shorter legs, shorter claws, shorter tail and a slightly longer snout.|$|E

Color temperature is a characteristic of visible light that has important applications in lighting, photography, videography, publishing, manufacturing, astrophysics, horticulture, and other fields. In practice, {{color temperature}} is meaningful only for light sources that do in fact correspond somewhat closely to the radiation of some black body, i.e., those on a line from reddish/orange via yellow and more or less white to blueish white; <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> sense to speak of the color temperature of, e.g., a green or a purple light.

500|$|Skeptics {{argue that}} the current gambit of {{contemporary}} conspiracy theorists who use The Protocols is to claim that they [...] "really" [...] come from some group other than the Jews, such as fallen angels or alien invaders.

500|$|Thirty-one U.S. state {{constitutional}} amendments banning legal recognition of same-sex unions have been adopted.

500|$|While Augusta National Golf Club has {{consistently}} chosen CBS as its U.S. broadcast partner, {{it has done}} so in successive one-year contracts. Former CBS Sports president Neal Pilson stated that their relationship had {{gotten to the point}} where they [...] "could do our deal in hours". Due to the lack of long-term contractual security, as well as the club's limited dependence on broadcast rights fees (owing to its affluent membership), it is widely held that CBS allows Augusta National greater control over the content of the broadcast, or at least performs some form of self-censorship, in order to maintain future rights. The club, however, has insisted <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> any demands with respect to the content of the broadcast. Despite this, announcers who have been deemed not to have acted with the decorum expected by the club have been removed, notably Jack Whitaker and Gary McCord, and there also tends to be a lack of discussion of any controversy involving Augusta National, such as the 2003 Martha Burk protests.|$|E
500|$|On the {{critical}} side, The Daily Telegraphs Jenny McCartney dismissed the metaphors {{in the chorus}} and thought the song's topic was over-hyped. She disagreed with {{the critical}} praise, arguing that women accept abusive relationships for deeper reasons than sexual and emotional pleasure, such as family and financial issues and helplessness. In an NPR article, the writer Maura Johnston commented that the lyrics portray Rihanna as the subject of Eminem's violence. Jay Smooth, a New York radio personality, responded that [...] "while Eminem explores the psyche of the abuser with an almost disturbing amount of depth and detail," [...] Rihanna's perspective is downplayed and not explained fully. Johnston and Smooth wrote that such imbalances are a prevalent issue in popular music duets. To Sady Doyle, although [...] "Love the Way You Lie" [...] is one of Eminem's most affecting tracks and finds him remorseful, <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> up for his past misogynistic actions and hateful songs.

500|$|This is {{not universally}} agreed upon. [...] Anton Bierl argues that Sappho's offer to pray to Hera is contrasted with a {{masculine}} ideology {{in which the}} pursuit of wealth is {{the solution to the}} family's problems, and therefore suggests a male relative of Sappho as the addressee of the poem. [...] Lardinois sees the argument that Sappho's mother could have gone to pray to Hera for her son's safe return herself, and therefore <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> sense for her to send Sappho to do so on her behalf, as the strongest against the thesis that the addressee is Sappho's mother, arguing on this basis for a male addressee. [...] In contrast, Mueller and Leslie Kurke both argue that the addressee is probably meant to be female, based on Sappho's use of the word [...] to describe their speech: meaning [...] "chattering" [...] or [...] "babbling", the word has negative connotations which would make Sappho unlikely to use it to address a man. [...] Anja Bettenworth has argued that the addressee is of a lower social status than Sappho, again based on the use of , but Kurke argues that the addressee is likely {{to be in a position}} of authority over Sappho, as Sappho expects them to send her to pray to Hera.|$|E
