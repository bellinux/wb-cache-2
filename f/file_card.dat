2500|$|The {{earliest}} flag {{known for}} the 6th Arkansas is a 1st pattern Hardee (Buckner) battle flag- 28" [...] x 38", no white border on three sides, and only a 2" [...] white border on the staff edge. (See Battle Flags of the Confederate Army of Tennessee, p.55) This flag is in the collections of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC; accession no. 18342. This flag (according to its <b>file</b> <b>card)</b> [...] "was made by a soldier of the Sixth Arkansas, from remnants of blue and white shirts." [...] The blue field is extensively pieced.|$|E
2500|$|Hawk {{was part}} of the first wave of G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero action figures that were {{released}} in 1982, packaged with the Mobile Missile System playset. Although he held the rank of colonel and his <b>file</b> <b>card</b> has flattering statements about his leadership abilities, his job description was [...] "Missile Commander", though in the Marvel Comics [...] series he was G.I. Joe team's field commander. All of the original sixteen figures from 1982 were released with [...] "straight arms". The same figure was re-released in 1983 with a [...] "swivel-arm battle grip", which made it easier for figures to hold their rifles and accessories.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>file</b> <b>card</b> is {{cardboard}} packaging with profile information, {{that accompanies}} most G.I. Joe or Cobra action figures. The {{owner of the}} action figure is encouraged to cut out the <b>file</b> <b>card</b> and save it. Over the years, the <b>file</b> <b>card</b> has evolved, but they generally contain the following information: ...|$|E
500|$|Hama created most {{characters}} {{in collaboration with}} Hasbro. Hasbro would send him character sketches and brief descriptions of each character's military specialties, and Hama would create detailed dossiers on each characters, giving them distinct personalities and background stories. Hama kept track of each character on <b>file</b> <b>cards,</b> and eventually Hasbro decided to reprint shortened versions of these dossiers as <b>file</b> <b>cards</b> on the packaging for the action figures. The <b>file</b> <b>cards</b> themselves became a selling point for the toy line, and appealed to both children and adults. Hama noted that: ...|$|R
5000|$|At {{the end of}} 2013 social {{pressure}} increased and Zepeda [...] "started a slow process of delivery of information", telling the sites of memory and victims' relatives {{that he was willing}} to release information, but he sent misleading signals about the number of <b>file</b> <b>cards,</b> their relevance, about the existence (or not) of the intelligence report on the <b>file</b> <b>cards,</b> etc. In the investigations which Zepeda leads about Colonia Dignidad [...] "everything is confusing", says Journalist Luis Narváez.|$|R

50|$|Storm Shadow {{was only}} listed with a rank while {{a member of}} the Joe team. There are four {{instances}} where his <b>file</b> <b>card</b> provides a pay-grade: 1991, 1994, and 1997 releases all have him listed as a Master Sergeant or E-8 (the same rank as Duke), and in 2007, the 25th anniversary release the <b>file</b> <b>card</b> lists him as E-5.|$|E
50|$|In the UK Action Force comics and toys, Flint's {{real name}} was David R. Faireborn and his <b>file</b> <b>card</b> stated that he hailed from Lincoln, England.|$|E
50|$|They {{were known}} for giving much needed {{details about the}} characters, such as their specialties, {{education}} and training. So detailed were the <b>file</b> <b>cards,</b> that they even mention the military schools the G.I. Joe characters attended. The 1982 to 1984 <b>file</b> <b>cards</b> contained information on weapons specialties, but this was removed afterwards with due to concerns that children may be being given knowledge on firearms and the feeling that a character would only be limited to what he knows to use.|$|R
40|$|It {{seems not}} only possible, but even {{comfortable}} {{to compare the}} following models of artistic creation: Jean-Luc Godard’s Jump cut film cut and editing and John Zorn’s <b>File</b> <b>cards</b> montage of musical blocks. These methods aren’t just similar in execution (differences in media and certain technicalities aside) – {{they come from the}} same ideological place and embody artists’ social subversions and revolts towards the mainstream in arts. This is a study on similarities, analogies and divergences between Godard and Zorn, incused in the Jump cut and <b>File</b> <b>cards</b> methods...|$|R
5000|$|The new figures {{also saw}} a {{significant}} change of the <b>file</b> <b>cards.</b> The names, the security number, and the birthplace information have been removed. The new format consisted of: ...|$|R
5000|$|Stingray - {{a one-man}} submarine, {{similar to those}} used in the James Bond film Never Say Never Again. The craft came {{packaged}} with an Aqua Trooper figure whose accompanying <b>file</b> <b>card</b> identified him as Shark.|$|E
5000|$|The {{figure was}} repainted and {{released}} {{as part of}} the Tiger Force line in 1988, packaged with the [...] "Tiger Fly" [...] covert assault helicopter. The <b>file</b> <b>card</b> for this figure reveals Recondo has extensive experience with helicopters.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Mc tab on a <b>file</b> <b>card</b> divider of British origin. Some {{traditional}} {{filing systems}} treated Mac/Mc names {{as if the}} prefix were a letter such as a putative [...] "Mc" [...] between M and N in the alphabet.|$|E
2500|$|This {{method of}} {{combining}} composition and improvisation involved [...] Zorn writing descriptions or ideas on file-cards and arranging them {{to form the}} piece. Zorn described the process in 2003: [...] "I write in moments, in disparate sound blocks, so I find it convenient to store these events on <b>filing</b> <b>cards</b> {{so they can be}} sorted and ordered with minimum effort. Pacing is essential. If you move too fast, people tend to stop hearing the individual moments as complete in themselves and more as elements of a sort of cloud effect... I worked 10 to 12 hours a day for a week, just orchestrating these <b>file</b> <b>cards.</b> It was an intense process." ...|$|R
50|$|Grögers {{resistance}} group {{broke into}} the building dressed up as policemen. They bemused the guards and blasted the building. Through this act thousands of <b>file</b> <b>cards</b> of Dutch people {{who would have been}} deported to concentration camps were destroyed.|$|R
25|$|One highly {{significant}} application was the Sabre airline reservations system, which first went into operation in 1960. With Sabre reservations {{could be placed}} remotely using teleprinters and all functions were done automatically, including ticket printing. This eliminated manually handling <b>file</b> <b>cards.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Gnawgahyde {{is later}} listed as [...] "unknown" [...] in the G.I. Joe Threat Index. This is a {{reference}} to the <b>file</b> <b>card</b> of the Dreadnok Crusher, where its states that Gnawgahyde went missing after going on a trip with the new Dreadnok.|$|E
50|$|Lady Jaye is a {{featured}} {{character in}} the slightly altered 'Action Force' continuity, starting with issue one. This version of Lady Jaye has the same file name, and {{is a native of}} Cork, Ireland, according to the 1987 Action Force <b>file</b> <b>card</b> of Lady Jaye.|$|E
5000|$|His <b>file</b> <b>card</b> {{states that}} he [...] "freaks people out. He's always clumsy, jittery, and {{dropping}} things except when he's working with high explosives. Explosives are {{the only things that}} calm him down". This source of humor is played up in the comics (see below).|$|E
50|$|The IIRNS has {{the most}} {{important}} numismatic library in India. Available for use by scholars (the Institute also has guest houses) it includes both Indian and non-Indian numismatic works as well as slides, <b>file</b> <b>cards,</b> and other records of numismatic collections.|$|R
5000|$|Besides, {{the judge}} refused to release to the Human Rights National Institute (Spanish: Instituto Nacional de Derechos Humanos, or INDH) the {{analysis}} {{report of the}} <b>file</b> <b>cards</b> which he himself had ordered the leadership of Police Intelligence (Jipol) to perform during six months in 2005. Once the police had started to make progress, Zepeda stopped them and ordered absolute secret about it. All parties in the several Colonia Dignidad trials, including their lawyers, were also denied access to it. The INDH appealed to court to reverse Zepeda's decision. Following a public outcry, the press started an investigation about the <b>file</b> <b>cards,</b> finally finding 45.612 cards and giving them human to rights associations ...|$|R

5000|$|Royal Guards - The arthropod-themed foot {{soldiers}} of Cobra-La. According to their <b>file</b> <b>card,</b> the Royal Guards were Cobra-La citizens who had living insect bodyparts permanently bonded onto their bodies because their brains were lobotomized {{in order to}} ensure their complete loyalty to Golobulus.|$|E
50|$|In 1991, {{in a major}} {{overhaul}} of the <b>file</b> <b>card</b> format, the paragraphs and the quotes were replaced by a short quote from the character him/herself, followed by a paragraph that hypes up the character's abilities. This would be the general format for all the file cards that followed.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} years, the toyline mostly held off on {{identifying}} the one character {{that served as}} the team's leader. The first run of the toyline featured Hawk as the highest-ranking team member; however though his <b>file</b> <b>card</b> makes specific mention of his abilities as a leader, it falls short of explicitly naming him as the team’s commander. Duke, who appeared the following year, is not specifically mentioned as either the team's commander or second-in-command, but his <b>file</b> <b>card</b> extols his ability to command by winning respect and mentions his current assignment as acting First Sergeant of the team. Any question of the team's commanding officer ended in 1986 when Hawk's second action figure version was released, and the character was officially billeted as the team's overall leader rather than field commander.|$|E
50|$|In 2004, a {{two pack}} {{featuring}} a Viper and a Tele-Viper was also released {{as part of}} the Valor Vs. Venom line in Python Patrol uniforms, but the packaging and the <b>file</b> <b>cards</b> makes no reference of these figures being in the Python Patrol.|$|R
5000|$|After the [...] "No more secret files" [...] {{campaign}} {{sustained by}} Londres 38, {{and other human}} rights associations, involving representatives of Chilean Congress, in 2014 Zepeda agreed to release 407 <b>file</b> <b>cards</b> to the relatives of executed and disappeared detainees, leaving more than thirty eight thousand other cards under secrecy though. It has been noticed that if the victims of Pinochet's dictatorship amount to around 4.000, {{the rest of the}} almost 40.000 <b>file</b> <b>cards</b> might contain information about those who provided support for Colonia Dignidad, from members of parliament, judges, big business, state services, police, armed forces, and many others who did business with them, buying and reselling their products, including arms, ammunition, dangerous chemicals, illegal adoptions, and money laundering.|$|R
50|$|His {{real name}} is Farley S. Seward, and his rank is that of {{corporal}} E-4. Frostbite was born in Galena, Alaska. All <b>file</b> <b>cards</b> as of 2005 list Frostbites rank as Sergeant E-5 except for his Rise of Cobra figure that lists his rank as Classified.|$|R
5000|$|Flint's action figure card {{describes}} {{him as a}} [...] "Warrant Officer" [...] but {{his character}} profile states his grade as E-6 for his original release. This {{was due to the}} error by an editor, and not the original author of the <b>file</b> <b>card,</b> Larry Hama. All subsequent releases give him a Rank of WO-2.|$|E
5000|$|The second version {{appeared}} in 2003 {{as part of}} the G.I. Joe vs. Cobra series. This Overkill is a cyborg, which is half-man and half-machine. The <b>file</b> <b>card</b> spells his name as [...] "Over Kill" [...] rather than one word although news releases and the credits in Valor vs. Venom spelled it as [...] "Overkill".|$|E
50|$|In 2010, the Red Shadows {{were the}} main adversary {{featured}} in the Official G.I. Joe Collectors' Club Convention Set. The set featured a new, G.I. Joe-style version of the Black Major {{as one of the}} figures in the set, and the <b>file</b> <b>card</b> information stated that the Black Major {{was in charge of the}} Red Shadows.|$|E
50|$|The Iron Grenadiers {{are led by}} Destro. Following the storyline in {{the comic}} book series at the time, the <b>file</b> <b>cards</b> {{indicate}} that Destro had, at some point, left Cobra and formed his own army. He begins having dreams of world domination, as did Cobra Commander.|$|R
50|$|If the <b>file</b> <b>cards</b> {{that came}} with the Overkill action figures are to be believed, there are {{actually}} two different characters that owned the name Overkill. Both versions of the character are the leader of the B.A.T.s (short for Battle Android Troopers) that are controlled by the ruthless Cobra Organization.|$|R
5000|$|Hama {{also wrote}} the {{majority}} of the G.I. Joe action figures' <b>file</b> <b>cards</b> - short biographical sketches designed to be clipped from the G.I. Joe and Cobra cardboard packaging. [...] In 2007 these filecards were reprinted in the retro packaging for the G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero 25th Anniversary line.|$|R
