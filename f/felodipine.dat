50|$|<b>Felodipine</b> is {{a member}} of the 1,4-dihydropyridine class of calcium channel blockers. It is a racemic mixture, and is {{insoluble}} in water but is soluble in dichloromethane and ethanol.|$|E
50|$|In April 2016, AstraZeneca {{announced}} that they were selling the right to market <b>felodipine</b> in China to China Medical System Holdings for $310 million; AZ would continue to manufacture the drug.|$|E
5000|$|The Swedish company Hässle, a {{division}} of Astra AB, discovered felodipine; it filed a patent application in 1979 claiming <b>felodipine</b> as an antihypertensive drug. [...] Astra partnered this drug and others with Merck & Co. in the US under a 1982 agreement between the companies. [...] The drug {{was approved by the}} FDA in 1991 after a three and a half year review; the drug entered a very crowded market the included the other calcium channel blockers nifedipine, verapamil, nicardipine, and isradipine.

50|$|Nicardipine is a {{dihydropyridine}} calcium-channel blocking agent {{used for}} the treatment of vascular disorders such as chronic stable angina, hypertension, and Raynaud's phenomenon. It is available in oral and intravenous formulations. Its mechanism of action and clinical effects closely resemble those of nifedipine and the other dihydropyridines (amlodipine, <b>felodipine),</b> except that nicardipine is more selective for cerebral and coronary blood vessels. Nicardipine also has a longer half-life than nifedipine. Nicardipine was approved by the FDA in December 1988. The patent for both Cardene and Cardene SR expired in October 1995.|$|E
50|$|Following the {{introduction}} of the CDS concepts, work along those lines started in numerous pharmaceutical centers around the world, and brain-targeting CDSs were explored for many therapeutic agents such as steroids (testosterone, progestins, estradiol, dexamethasone), anti-infective agents (penicillins, sulfonamides), antivirals (acyclovir, trifluorothymidine, ribavirin), antiretrovirals (AZT, ganciclovir), anticancer agents (Lomustine, chlorambucil), neurotransmitters (dopamine, GABA), nerve growth factor (NGF) inducers, anticonvulsants (Phenytoin, valproate, stiripentol), Ca2+ antagonists (<b>felodipine),</b> MAO inhibitors, NSAIDs and neuropeptides (tryptophan, Leu-enkephalin analogs, TRH analogs, kyotorphin analogs). A number of new chemical entities (NCE) were developed based on these principles, such as E2-CDS (Estredox or betaxoxime are in advanced clinical development phases.|$|E
5000|$|In 1998, various {{researchers}} showed that grapefruit juice, and grapefruit in general, {{is a potent}} inhibitor of CYP3A4, which can affect the metabolism {{of a variety of}} drugs, increasing their bioavailability. In some cases, this can lead to a fatal interaction with drugs like astemizole or terfenadine. The effect of grapefruit juice with regard to drug absorption was originally discovered in 1989. The first published report on grapefruit drug interactions was in 1991 in the Lancet entitled [...] "Interactions of Citrus Juices with <b>Felodipine</b> and Nifedipine" [...] and was the first reported food-drug interaction clinically. The effects of grapefruit last from 3-7 days, with the greatest effects when juice is taken an hour previous to administration of the drug.|$|E
40|$|<b>Felodipine,</b> a dihydropyridine, {{is a new}} vasodilating calcium {{antagonist}} which lowers blood pressure (BP) by selective action on vascular smooth muscle, especially in the resistance vessels. The effects on BP, heart rate (HR) and tolerance of different single oral doses of <b>felodipine</b> were studied in two series of hypertensive patients. When <b>felodipine</b> was given as single drug to 14 previously untreated hypertensives in a single-blind manner, BP was rapidly reduced by about 15 % while HR increased by 25 %. <b>Felodipine</b> given in a double-blind manner to eight patients on chronic beta-adrenoceptor blockade reduced BP by some 15 - 20 % compared to placebo, while HR did not change. There was a significant correlation between the pre-treatment mean arterial BP (MAP) and the maximal relative change in MAP, i. e. the higher the initial BP the greater the reduction after <b>felodipine.</b> A significant correlation was also found between the plasma concentration of <b>felodipine</b> and the relative change in MAP. <b>Felodipine</b> was generally well tolerated.

40|$|Absorption of <b>felodipine</b> is {{rapid and}} complete. A {{pronounced}} first-pass metabolism {{results in a}} bioavailability of 15 %, irrespective of the oral formulation used. The peak plasma concentrations and area under the plasma concentration-time curve are linearly related to the dose. The variability in plasma concentrations is wide, and individualisation of the dosage is recommended. Plasma <b>felodipine</b> concentrations are increased in the elderly, and in patients with congestive heart failure or liver cirrhosis; in these patients <b>felodipine</b> should be started at a low dosage. Food intake has no clinically significant effect on <b>felodipine</b> absorption. Serum digoxin concentrations are increased by <b>felodipine</b> in plain tablet form, but not when it is administered as extended release tablets. Activators, inducers and inhibitors of the cytochrome P 450 system affect the plasma concentrations of <b>felodipine.</b> No displacement reactions with high affinity protein binding drugs have been observed. There is a significant correlation between plasma concentration and haemodynamic effect. The mean elimination half-life of 24 h together with the extended release formulation of <b>felodipine</b> favours once-daily dosage in patients with hypertension...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} calcium (Ca 2 +) {{antagonism}} with <b>felodipine</b> on the intracellular concentrations and transmembrane fluxes of cations in erythrocytes, was studied in 10 normal volunteers at rest and during exercise. All subjects performed two uninterrupted incremental exercise tests {{on a bicycle}} ergometer in a randomized order either after placebo administration or after 3 days of pretreatment with <b>felodipine</b> 5 mg t. i. d. <b>Felodipine</b> {{did not affect the}} erythrocyte ouabain-sensitive 86 rubidium uptake, furosemide-sensitive sodium (Na+) - and potassium (K+) -effluxes and the Na+,Li+-countertransport at rest and during exercise and recovery. Intra-erythrocyte and plasma Na+ and K+ concentrations were not different during <b>felodipine</b> whereas the plasma Ca 2 + concentration was significantly increased. Plasma magnesium (Mg 2 +) concentration was reduced during <b>felodipine</b> treatment while the intra-erythrocyte Mg 2 + concentration tended to be increased. The intra-erythrocyte to plasma concentration ratios for Na+ and K+ were not significantly affected by <b>felodipine</b> whereas the ratio for Mg 2 + was increased. It is concluded that short-term Ca 2 + antagonism with <b>felodipine</b> is not accompanied by major alterations in the intracellular concentrations and transmembrane fluxes of Na+ and K+ in red blood cells of normotensive subjects. The red cell transmembrane gradient for Mg 2 + is however altered by <b>felodipine.</b> status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Aims The study {{aimed to}} compare the {{addition}} of <b>felodipine</b> to metoprolol, and of the replacement of metoprolol by <b>felodipine,</b> with continuation of metoprolol, in patients with angina pectoris despite optimal beta-blockade. Methods and results The study was double-blind, parallel, randomized and controlled, and comprised 363 patients from 27 outpatient cardiology clinics in the Netherlands. The patients had angina and positive bicycle exercise tests despite optimal beta-blockade (resting heart rate < 65 beats. min(- 1)). Randomization waste three treatment groups: continuation of metoprolol (control), addition of <b>felodipine</b> to metoprolol, and replacement of metoprolol by <b>felodipine.</b> Exercise tests were repeated after 2 and 5 weeks. The main outcome measure was: exercise result after 5 weeks, compared with baseline, between-group comparison of changes vs control. There {{were no significant differences}} in exercise duration and onset of chest pain vs control. The addition of <b>felodipine</b> increased time until 1 mm ST depression (43 s, 95 % confidence interval 20 - 65 s), and decreased both ST depression at highest comparable work load (0. 46 mm, 95 % confidence interval 0. 19 - 0. 72), and maximal ST depression (0. 49 mm, 95 % confidence interval 0. 23 - 0. 74). Exercise results after replacement of metoprolol by <b>felodipine</b> were not different from control, apart from a significant increase in rate pressure product. Significantly more patients experienced adverse events in the <b>felodipine</b> monotherapy group. Conclusion Combination of metoprolol and <b>felodipine</b> is to be preferred to <b>felodipine</b> monotherapy in patients who have signs and symptoms of myocardial ischaemia despite optimal beta-blockade...|$|E
40|$|Cardiovascular {{effects of}} submaximal {{antihypertensive}} {{doses of the}} angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, ramipril (0. 25 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 [*]day− 1 in the food), and the calcium channel blocker, <b>felodipine</b> (0. 4 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 [*]day− 1 subcutaneously by osmotic minipump), both alone and in combination, were examined in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) in a four-week study. Both ramipril and <b>felodipine</b> as monotherapy decreased systolic blood pressure. The antihypertensive effect of the drug combination {{was more than that}} of ramipril treatment alone, but not significantly better than that of <b>felodipine</b> monotherapy. Ramipril or <b>felodipine</b> treatments did not significantly affect the heart rate, either alone or in combination. The beneficial effect of ramipril monotherapy on left ventricular hypertrophy was more prominent than that of <b>felodipine.</b> The cardioprotective effect of <b>felodipine</b> was improved when combined to ramipril. The systolic blood pressure {{at the end of the}} experimental period correlated only weakly with left ventricular hypertrophy. Responses of mesenteric arterial rings in vitro were examined at the end of the four-week study. Ramipril and <b>felodipine</b> monotherapies as well as their combination markedly improved the endothelium-dependent vascular relaxation responses to acetylcholine. The combination of ramipril and <b>felodipine</b> slightly enhanced the endothelium-independent vascular relaxation responses to sodium nitroprusside. Ramipril treatment alone slightly diminished the vascular contractile responses to noradrenaline. Neither ramipril nor <b>felodipine</b> alone or in combination affected the vascular contractile responses to potassium chloride. Ramipril treatment, both alone and in combination with <b>felodipine,</b> caused a three fold increase in plasma renin activity. Serum aldosterone, fasting blood glucose level, serum insulin and the 24 hour urinary excretions of sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, phosphorus or protein were not significantly affected by the drug treatments. Our findings suggest that a better overall control of hypertension and end-organ damages, without an increase in adverse effects, can be achieved by the combination of submaximal antihypertensive doses of <b>felodipine</b> and ramipril than by monotherapy with either drug alone...|$|E
40|$|The {{symptomatic}} {{effects of}} <b>felodipine</b> (Plendil(R)) have been assessed in 10 patients with primary Raynaud's phenomenon {{in a single}} blind study. After 2 weeks on placebo, the patients were treated for 6 weeks with <b>felodipine,</b> the dose being titrated stepwise every 2 weeks, starting with 5 mg, and increasing to 10 mg and 20 mg once daily if symptoms persisted. After the drug period the patients received placebo for 2 weeks. Objective measurement by cold exposure finger plethysmography did not show any benefit of <b>felodipine</b> in the higher temperature range, taking 33 -degrees-C as reference point. However, when using 24 -degrees-C as the reference point, the area under the plethysmography versus temperature curve (AUC) for 5 mg <b>felodipine</b> were significantly larger than the initial placebo area. The AUC during recovery from cold exposure for the maximal accepted dose of <b>felodipine</b> was significantly larger than for the initial placebo period. Subjective judgement by the patients showed {{a significant reduction in}} the number of Raynaud attacks and a trend to a shorter duration of attacks with the maximal dose of <b>felodipine.</b> Two patients became free from attacks of Raynaud's phenomenon. <b>Felodipine</b> 10 mg once daily was well tolerated.

40|$|We {{studied the}} effects of adding <b>felodipine</b> to beta-adrenoceptor {{blockade}} on haemodynamics and exercise capacity in 14 patients with stable angina pectoris using a placebo controlled double-blind crossover protocol. <b>Felodipine</b> reduced supine and standing systolic pressure by 13 % (P less than 0. 01) and 14 % (P less than 0. 01) respectively and increased supine heart rate 7. 4 % (P less than 0. 05). <b>Felodipine</b> at a plasma concentration of 15. 5 +/- 3. 0 nmol l- 1 increased exercise duration by 16 % (P less than 0. 01) but failed to attenuate the degree of ST segment depression during exercise. The mean daily number of episodes of angina (0. 53 +/- 0. 16 on placebo vs 0. 37 +/- 0. 11 on <b>felodipine)</b> and mean daily GTN consumption (0. 51 +/- 0. 07 on placebo vs 0. 36 +/- 0. 12 on <b>felodipine)</b> were not significantly reduced (0. 1 less than P greater than 0. 05).

40|$|Abstract OBJECTIVE: This double-blind, {{placebo-controlled}} randomized {{study was}} designed to compare the antihypertensive effect and tolerability of extended-release <b>felodipine</b> and slow-release nifedipine retard in elderly hypertensive patients. METHODS: Thirty patients of both sexes (mean age 71 years) with mild to moderate essential hypertension were recruited from our hypertension outpatient clinic. After a 2 -week placebo period, <b>felodipine</b> extended-release (<b>felodipine</b> ER), 10 mg once daily, nifedipine slow-release retard (nifedipine SR), 20 mg twice daily or placebo were administered to each patient for 2 weeks according to a 3 x 3 latin-square design.
