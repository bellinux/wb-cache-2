5|$|Per {{traditional}} accounts, some Brahmins of Varanasi {{were still}} not satisfied, and sent two thieves {{to steal the}} manuscript. The thieves tried {{to break into the}} Ashram of Tulsidas, but were confronted by two guards with bows and arrows, of dark and fair complexion. The thieves {{had a change of heart}} and came to Tulsidas in the morning to ask who the two guards were. Believing that the two guards could be none other than Rama and Lakshmana, Tulsidas was aggrieved to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> guarding his home at night. He sent the manuscript of Ramcahritmanas to his friend Rai Todar Mal, the finance minister of Akbar, and donated all his money. The thieves were reformed and became devotees of Rama.|$|E

However, as Japan continued military expansion, the military found itself short of Japanese volunteers, and turned to the local population to coerce women into serving in these stations, or abducted them. Many women responded to calls for work as factory workers or nurses, and did not <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> being pressed into sexual slavery.|$|E

25|$|There are {{two types}} of {{misrepresentation}}: fraud in the factum and fraud in inducement. Fraud in the factum focuses on whether the party alleging misrepresentation knew they were creating a contract. If the party did not <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> entering into a contract, there is no meeting of the minds, and the contract is void. Fraud in inducement focuses on misrepresentation attempting to get the party to enter into the contract. Misrepresentation of a material fact (if the party knew the truth, that party would not have entered into the contract) makes a contract voidable.|$|E

500|$|On {{the night}} of 23 February, Missouri and Wisconsin turned their big guns on Kuwait's Faylaka Island to support the US-led {{coalition}} ground offensive to free Kuwait from the Iraqi occupation forces. The two ships were to conduct a diversionary assault aimed at convincing the Iraqi forces arrayed along the shores of Faylaka Island that Coalition forces were preparing to launch an amphibious invasion. As part of this attack, Missouri and Wisconsin were directed to shell known Iraqi defensive positions on the island. Shortly after Missouri completed her shelling of Faylaka Island, Wisconsin, while still over the horizon (and thus out of visual range of the Iraqi forces) launched her RQ-2 Pioneer Unmanned Aerial Vehicle to spot for her [...] guns. As Wisconsins drone approached Faylaka Island, the pilot of the drone was instructed to fly the vehicle low over Iraqi positions so that the soldiers would <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> once again being targeted by a battleship. Iraqi {{troops on the ground}} heard the Pioneer’s distinctive buzzing sound, and having witnessed the effects of Missouris artillery strike on their trench line, the Iraqi troops decided to signal their willingness to surrender by waving makeshift white flags, an action dutifully noted aboard Wisconsin. Amused at this sudden development, the men assigned to the drone’s aircrew called Wisconsins commanding officer, Captain David S. Bill III, and asked, [...] "Sir, they want to surrender, what should I do with them?" [...] This surrender to Wisconsins Pioneer has since {{become one of the most}} remembered moments of the Gulf War; the incident was also the first-ever surrender of enemy troops to an unmanned aircraft controlled by a ship. Wisconsin drone also carried out a number of reconnaissance missions on occupied Kuwait before the coalition's ground offensive.|$|E
2500|$|In {{order to}} {{preserve}} and shield (mask) their traditional beliefs, the Lucumí people syncretized their Orichás with Catholic saints. (As a consequence, the terms [...] "saint" [...] and [...] "orichá" [...] are commonly used interchangeably among practitioners.) Spanish colonial planters who saw the enslaved African people celebrating on saints' days did not <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> actually performing rituals related to Orichás, and assumed that they were showing more interest in Catholic saints than in the Christian God—hence the derisory origin of the term Santería.|$|E

The tribe responded by mocking Muhammad's followers for accepting him as a prophet and also mocked their victory at Badr saying the Quraish {{had no knowledge of}} war.
