5|$|After the war Wiśniowiecki {{engaged in}} a number of {{conflicts}} with neighbouring magnates and nobles. Jeremi was able to afford a sizable private army of several thousands, and through the threat of it he was often able to force his neighbours to a favourable settlement of disputes. Soon after his return from the Russian front, he participated {{on the side of the}} Dowmont family in the quarrel over the estate of Dowmontów against another magnate, Samuel Łaszcz, located on his lands; soon after the victorious battle against Łaszcz <b>he</b> <b>bought</b> <b>the</b> lands from the Dowmonts and incorporated them into his estates.|$|E
5|$|As his {{businesses}} grew, {{he added}} to his fleet of ships, big ones to ship salmon to San Francisco and smaller ones for shallow waters and for towing larger ships {{in and out of}} the Rogue mouth. In 1879 <b>he</b> <b>bought</b> <b>the</b> steamer Varuna and the tug Mary Hume and started a shipyard at Ellensburg. In 1880 he added the steam schooner Mary D. Hume, the tug Pelican in 1883, the schooner Berwick in 1887, the steamer Thistle in 1888, and replacement craft in subsequent years. Returning ships brought goods for Hume's general store.|$|E
5|$|Aside from renovating the {{factories}} in Godegård (the largest ironworks in Östergötland) {{he also had}} an English park planned and built at his manor in Godergård. The park had an orangery, canals, bridges and pavilions and was modelled after the larger park at Drottningholm Palace with its Chinese Pavilion. The Godegård estate also included Mariedamm with the Trehörnings blast furnace and the De Geersfors manufacturing house. Grill also bought the Bona estate in Västra Ny, where he built a wrought iron factory and the Medevi seat farm in 1779, (sold the following year).

His elder brother John was already {{an officer in the}} same regiment. As was usual at the time, Brock's commission was purchased. On 16 January 1790 <b>he</b> <b>bought</b> <b>the</b> rank of lieutenant and later that year he raised his own company of men. As a result, he was promoted to captain (of an independent company of foot) on 27 January 1791 and transferred to the 49th (Hertfordshire) Regiment of Foot on 15 June 1791.|$|E
5|$|Benn met Caroline Middleton DeCamp (born 13 October 1926, Cincinnati, Ohio, United States) over tea at Worcester College, Oxford, in 1949 {{and just}} nine days after meeting her; he {{proposed}} to her {{on a park bench}} in the city.

5|$|Hill {{called the}} {{attention}} of the Nebraska State Historical Society (NSHS) to the site and, in 1924, joined representatives of the Society in conducting further excavations, showing that a village of considerable size had existed there. In 1925, to ensure archaeological access to the site and to protect it from relic-hunting, <b>he</b> <b>bought</b> <b>the</b> two farms on whose land it lay. Between 1924 and 1930, he excavated two lodges and over fifty graves.|$|E

5|$|In 1599, a {{partnership}} {{of members of}} the company built their own theatre on the south bank of the River Thames, which they named the Globe. In 1608, the partnership also took over the Blackfriars indoor theatre. Extant records of Shakespeare's property purchases and investments indicate that his association with the company made him a wealthy man, and in 1597, <b>he</b> <b>bought</b> <b>the</b> second-largest house in Stratford, New Place, and in 1605, invested in a share of the parish tithes in Stratford.|$|E
5|$|In the {{two years}} {{following}} the release of Horse in 1941, Kurosawa searched for a story he could use to launch his directing career. Towards the end of 1942, {{about a year after}} the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, novelist Tsuneo Tomita published his Musashi Miyamoto-inspired judo novel, Sanshiro Sugata, the advertisements for which intrigued Kurosawa. <b>He</b> <b>bought</b> <b>the</b> book on its publication day, devoured it in one sitting, and immediately asked Toho to secure the film rights. Kurosawa's initial instinct proved correct as, within a few days, three other major Japanese studios also offered to buy the rights. Toho prevailed, and Kurosawa began pre-production on his debut work as director.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Mail Steam Packet Company was a British {{shipping}} company founded in London in 1839 by James MacQueen. It became the largest shipping {{group in the}} world when it took over the White Star Line in 1927. Lord Kylsant had been chairman of the company since 1902. He had expanded the company rapidly: aside from the White Star Line, <b>he</b> <b>bought</b> <b>the</b> Pacific Steam Navigation Company in 1910 for £1.5million, the Union-Castle Line in 1912, and assumed control of the Harland and Wolff shipyards in 1924.|$|E

5|$|Chartwell is {{a country}} house {{near the town of}} Westerham, Kent in South East England. For over forty years it was the home of Winston Churchill. <b>He</b> <b>bought</b> <b>the</b> {{property}} in September 1922 and lived there until shortly before his death in January 1965. In the 1930s, when Churchill was excluded from political office, Chartwell became the centre of his world. At his dining table, he gathered those who could assist his campaign against German re-armament and the British government's response of appeasement; in his study, he composed speeches and wrote books; in his garden, he built walls, constructed lakes and painted. During the Second World War Chartwell was largely unused, the Churchills returning after he lost the 1945 election. In 1953, when again Prime Minister, the house became Churchill's refuge when he suffered a devastating stroke. In October 1964, he left for the last time, dying at his London home, 28, Hyde Park Gate, on 24 January 1965.|$|E
5|$|Chesney was {{a builder}} in his diocese, where {{he ordered the}} {{construction}} of the episcopal palace. He also founded a Gilbertine house of canons just outside the city of Lincoln, the priory of St Catherine, shortly after the order was recognised by the papacy in 1148. Unusually for its time it was only founded for men, although Gilbertine monastic houses typically accommodated both men and women. In 1161 <b>he</b> <b>bought</b> <b>the</b> Old Temple in London as a house for himself. These expenditures contributed to his financial difficulties, along with royal demands, which led to complaints about Chesney's spending. Another cause for complaint was that he gave away some of his estates as marriage portions for his nieces. Chesney also was a benefactor to the town of Banbury, to which he granted the right to hold a fair some time before 1154.|$|E
5|$|Gowariker {{had always}} aspired {{to make a}} romantic comedy and was {{inspired}} to adapt Rye's novel into a feature film after watching a play {{based on the same}} source material. Later, <b>he</b> <b>bought</b> <b>the</b> rights and co-wrote the screenplay with playwright Naushil Mehta. In the process, several plot changes were made for the cinematic adaptation, notably the similarity between the twelve girls, and the ending. Since Gowariker was against using prosthetics to create the twelve characters, Chopra worked on her body language and her voice to make them distinct. Principal photography was extensively done at sixty-seven locations across Mumbai, and partly in Baroda and Chicago. The soundtrack, consisting of thirteen songs, each representing an astrological sign and one compilation, was composed by Sohail Sen, with lyrics by Javed Akhtar.|$|E

5|$|In 1924, John Ingle, {{the former}} captain of Pegasus, was tasked with {{clearing}} wrecks from the harbor in Dar es Salaam. At that time, <b>he</b> <b>bought</b> <b>the</b> salvage rights to Königsberg {{for the price}} of £200; he sent divers to extract non-ferrous scrap metal from the wreck and in turn sold the rights. Salvage work continued into the 1930s, and by the 1940s the hull had rolled over to her starboard side. As late as 1965, salvage work continued, but in 1966 the wreck collapsed and finally sank into the riverbed. Three of the ship's 10.5cm guns are preserved, one in Pretoria, South Africa, one in Jinja, Uganda, and one in Mombasa, along with a gun from Pegasus.|$|E
5|$|Johnson had {{purchased}} the car from a junkyard in 1956. Johnson and his son, Craig, would restore {{the car as}} a father-son project while Craig attended the Georgia Military Academy. The two spent two years and over $1,800 restoring the vehicle. Johnson utilized spare parts from many different sources to refurbish the rusty hulk. <b>He</b> <b>bought</b> <b>the</b> mahogany dash from a parts dealer in Caracas, Venezuela and used Convair 440 aluminum sheets to replace the flooring. After Craig graduated from high school, he attended Florida State on a track scholarship. In 1960, Craig's track team would be in Atlanta competing against Tech. Johnson, wanting to see his son compete, took the Model A to Tech campus, parked it near Towers dormitory, and went to watch Craig compete.|$|E
5|$|Though the 1890s brought Carte more disappointments than {{hits in the}} theatre, {{his hotel}} {{business}} prospered and grew. He acquired Simpson's-in-the-Strand and Claridge's Hotel, both of which he entirely rebuilt. There was one grave setback, in 1897, {{when he had to}} dismiss his manager, Ritz, and his star chef, Escoffier, for financial misconduct. Carte's choice as successor to Ritz was George Reeves-Smith, manager and part-owner of the Berkeley Hotel. To secure his services, Carte bought the Berkeley in 1900 and promoted Reeves-Smith to be managing director of the whole Savoy Group. Carte had used the same method, a year earlier, to secure a new maître d'hôtel. He was determined to engage M. Joseph, proprietor of the Marivaux Restaurant in Paris, then at the height of its fame. Carte was seriously ill, but he insisted on being carried to the boat-train. In Paris <b>he</b> <b>bought</b> <b>the</b> Marivaux and returned with Joseph to the Savoy.|$|E
