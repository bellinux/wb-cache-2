5|$|A {{method of}} {{measuring}} {{the speed of}} light is to measure the time needed <b>for</b> <b>light</b> to travel to a mirror at a known distance and back. This is the working principle behind the Fizeau–Foucault apparatus developed by Hippolyte Fizeau and Léon Foucault.|$|E
5|$|Green {{is without}} {{comparison}} the best colour <b>for</b> <b>light</b> troops with dark accouterments; and if put {{on in the}} spring, by autumn it nearly fades with the leaves, preserving its characteristic of being scarcely discernible at a distance.|$|E
5|$|A bulk carrier's {{design is}} largely {{defined by the}} cargo it will carry. The cargo's density, also known as its stowage factor, is the key factor. Densities for common bulk cargoes vary from 0.6tons per cubic meter <b>for</b> <b>light</b> grains to 3tons per cubic meter for iron ore.|$|E
5000|$|... 19% {{of energy}} {{use in the}} world is used <b>for</b> <b>lighting,</b> and 6% of {{greenhouse}} emissions in the world derive from this energy used <b>for</b> <b>lighting.</b> In the United States, 65 percent of energy consumption is used by commercial and industrial sectors, and 22 percent of this is used <b>for</b> <b>lighting.</b>|$|R

5|$|A pulse with {{different}} group and phase velocities (which occurs if the phase velocity {{is not the}} same for all the frequencies of the pulse) smears out over time, a process known as dispersion. Certain materials have an exceptionally low (or even zero) group velocity <b>for</b> <b>light</b> waves, a phenomenon called slow light, which has been confirmed in various experiments.|$|E
5|$|All {{terminals}} and hangars were on {{the square}} periphery. By the late 1970s, the shorter north–south and east–west runway pairs had been closed, though some were converted to taxiways. The other four runways remain in use, all strengthened and enhanced, but about the same lengths as always. A short runway (13R/31L) <b>for</b> <b>light</b> aircraft was added in 1989.|$|E
5|$|Although {{some work}} was done to {{strengthen}} the structure in the 1960s, the complex was allowed to fall into disrepair. Also during the 1960s, some sections of the complex began to be left unoccupied and others burned down including an engine block. During this period, parts of the complex were used <b>for</b> <b>light</b> industrial use before they too fell into disuse. In the 1990s, the buildings fell victim to vandalism and arson that threatened to destroy {{what remained of the}} site.|$|E
5000|$|Darkening of the arena, often {{accompanied}} by mood lighting or strobe lighting, such as in The Undertaker's, Triple H's, or Sting's entrances. Certain colors of lighting {{have been associated with}} specific wrestlers; <b>for</b> instance, blue <b>lighting</b> <b>for</b> The Undertaker, green <b>lighting</b> <b>for</b> Triple H, D-Generation X, and Shane McMahon, red and orange <b>lighting</b> <b>for</b> Kane, multicolored <b>lighting</b> <b>for</b> John Morrison, gold <b>lighting</b> <b>for</b> Goldust, pink <b>lighting</b> <b>for</b> Val Venis, and so forth.|$|R

5|$|As of 2011 the police's new {{patrol cars}} are four-wheel drive Volkswagen Passat with {{automatic}} transmission. New transport cars are Mercedes-Benz Vito <b>for</b> <b>light</b> transport and Mercedes-Benz Sprinter for heavy transport. The police force operates two Eurocopter EC135 helicopters, {{which are based}} at Oslo Airport, Gardermoen. In addition, the Emergency Response Unit can use the Royal Norwegian Air Force's Bell 412 helicopters.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the storm}} reached Atlantic Canada, the Meteorological Branch of the Department of Transport {{provided}} notices for the advancing storm. On {{the day of}} the storm, the forecast from the Halifax weather office was <b>for</b> <b>light</b> winds, and although it was amended to highlight severe conditions, boats in the region had no radio to learn of the threat. There were many salmon in the region, which prompted fishermen to set sail. As the storm approached, there were about 45 boats in the Northumberland Strait between New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island.|$|E
5|$|Cadmium is a {{component}} of some compound semiconductors, such as cadmium sulfide, cadmium selenide, and cadmium telluride, used <b>for</b> <b>light</b> detection and solar cells. HgCdTe is sensitive to infrared light {{and can be used}} as an infrared detector, motion detector, or switch in remote control devices.|$|E

5|$|Communication in {{the form}} of quorum sensing plays a role in the {{regulation}} of luminescence in many species of bacteria. Small extracellularly secreted molecules stimulate the bacteria to turn on genes <b>for</b> <b>light</b> production when cell density, measured by concentration of the secreted molecules, is high.|$|E
5|$|From 1963 to 1966, RAN {{warships}} {{took part}} in the Indonesian Confrontation. During this period, Australian minesweepers and frigates patrolled Malaysia's coastline to counter Indonesian infiltration parties travelling in small craft. These ships also bombarded Indonesian positions in East Kalimantan near the border with Malaysia on several occasions. The RAN's experiences during this conflict led it to perceive a need <b>for</b> <b>light</b> destroyers and patrol boats tailored to Confrontation-type tasks.|$|E
5|$|Gravitational {{redshift}} {{was first}} measured {{in a laboratory}} setting in 1959 by Pound and Rebka. It is also seen in astrophysical measurements, notably <b>for</b> <b>light</b> escaping the white dwarf Sirius B. The related gravitational time dilation effect has been measured by transporting atomic clocks to altitudes of between tens {{and tens of thousands}} of kilometers (first by Hafele and Keating in 1971; most accurately to date by Gravity Probe A launched in 1976).|$|E

5|$|In March 1965, a NOTAM {{was issued}} of changes {{had been made}} into the {{arrangements}} <b>for</b> <b>light</b> aircraft crossing the Channel. These changes were partly to avoid conflict with traffic flying into Lydd (Ferryfield). Non-radio aircraft could use the route between Hythe and Ambleteuse. Non-radio aircraft were advised to call at Lympne before crossing. On 11 July, one of Skyways Coach Air's Avro 748s crashed on landing at Lympne.|$|E
5|$|In October 2014, MART {{announced}} that it would run dedicated bus service from Gardner to Wachusett station when the station opened. By the end of 2014, retaining walls for ramps to the platforms and concrete bases <b>for</b> <b>light</b> poles in the parking lot were in place. Track and signal work on the Pan Am Southern mainline began in Spring 2015. In January 2015, the opening was delayed further to Fall 2016.|$|E
5|$|In {{the nineteenth}} century Białystok was an {{important}} center <b>for</b> <b>light</b> industry, which {{was the reason for}} the substantial growth of the city's population. The tradition continued with many garment factories established in the twentieth century, such as Fasty in the district of Bacieczki. However, after the fall of communism in 1989 many of these factories faced severe problems and subsequently closed down.|$|E

5|$|Manchester {{became the}} first city in the UK to acquire a modern light rail tram system when the Manchester Metrolink opened in 1992. In 2016–17, 37.8 million {{passenger}} journeys were made on the system. The present system mostly runs on former commuter rail lines converted <b>for</b> <b>light</b> rail use, and crosses the city centre via on-street tram lines. The network consists of seven lines with 93 stops. A new line to the Trafford Centre is currently under construction and is due to open by 2020.|$|E
5|$|Midsomer Norton {{traditionally}} hosted {{other industries}} {{and became a}} major manufacturing centre for printing and packaging. Some 2,000 people (27% of total employment) work in this industry locally. Following the decline of mining, these companies expanded on local trading estates and in Welton. The sites of the disused collieries in the area have subsequently been developed <b>for</b> <b>light</b> industry.|$|E
5|$|One {{study has}} shown {{theoretically}} that, while a bike leaned in a turn, road undulations can excite the weave mode {{at high speed}} or the wobble mode at low speed if either of their frequencies match the vehicle speed and other parameters. Excitation of the wobble mode can be mitigated by an effective steering damper and excitation of the weave mode is worse <b>for</b> <b>light</b> riders than for heavy riders.|$|E
