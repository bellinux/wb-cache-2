5|$|Promoted to brigadier in 1928, Burgess became Commandant of the New Zealand Military Forces, a {{position}} {{now known as}} the Chief of Army, in 1931 for a four-year term. The country's economic difficulties made his appointment a <b>difficult</b> <b>one.</b> The depression had resulted in New Zealand's compulsory military training scheme being abolished and the Territorial Force needed to be reorganised accordingly.|$|E
5|$|Dermide {{was born}} on 20 April 1798, in Milan, which was then part of the Cisalpine Republic, a puppet state of the First French Republic. He {{was the first and}} only child of his parents, Maria Paola di Buonaparte (known as Pauline) and Charles Victoire Emmanuel Leclerc, a general in the French Army. Dermide's birth was a <b>difficult</b> <b>one,</b> and its effects would be visible in Pauline's health for many years. He was christened Dermide Louis Napoléon, after a {{character}} in the epic Gaelic poems of Ossian, at the request of his uncle, general Napoleon Bonaparte, who greatly admired Ossian's works.|$|E

With much of the town in {{disrepair}} and the population depleted, the isolated village faced a <b>difficult</b> period. As <b>one</b> returning soldier wrote, [...] "Tampa was a hard-looking place. Streets and lots were grown up with weeds and the outlook certainly was not very encouraging.".|$|R
5|$|Shea's {{relationship}} with the engineers at North American was a <b>difficult</b> <b>one.</b> While Shea blamed North American's management for the continuing difficulties {{in the development of}} the command module, project leader Harrison Storms felt that NASA itself was far from blameless. It had delayed in making key design decisions, and persisted in making significant changes to the design once construction had begun. While Shea did his part in attempting to control the change requests, Storms felt that he did not understand or sympathize with the inevitable problems involved in the day-to-day work of manufacturing.|$|E
5|$|The legendary herb {{has entered}} the modern Bulgarian {{vocabulary}} {{as a metaphor for}} a magic key or a panacea in the wider sense. The phrase “to find the razkovniche” („да намериш разковничето“ „da namerish razkovnicheto“) means to find the solution to a certain problem, usually a complex or <b>difficult</b> <b>one.</b> Razkovniche is also the common Bulgarian name for the plant European waterclover (Marsilea quadrifolia) which, in its appearance, has many similarities with the descriptions of the mythical raskovnik. In eastern Serbia, raskovnik also refers to a specific plant used in vernacular medicine, namely Laserpitium siler.|$|E
5|$|There was {{a simpler}} {{performance}} on tape {{and a more}} <b>difficult</b> <b>one,</b> with Mariah singing out more, with more licks. But we chose a happy medium. The song really calls for not anything really fancy. But she's always fighting the forces inside of her because she's her own devil's advocate. She {{wants to do something}} that's so over the top and use her talents and the voice she has. But she also knows she has to restrain herself and do what the music really calls for.|$|E

50|$|The {{last few}} months of Codignac in the Ottoman Empire were <b>difficult</b> <b>ones,</b> as he was {{attacked}} by Rustem Pasha {{for the failure of}} the French government to repay debts to the Ottomans. Codignac himself had apparently incurred debts and was disgraced by the Sultan.|$|R
5|$|Antichrist Superstar was {{recorded}} at Nothing Studios in New Orleans by an extensive group of musicians, {{including members of}} Marilyn Manson (namely the band's eponymous vocalist, Twiggy Ramirez, Madonna Wayne Gacy, Daisy Berkowitz, and Ginger Fish) and Nine Inch Nails (guitarists Robin Finck and Danny Lohner, and drummer Chris Vrenna). Manson, Trent Reznor and frequent Nine Inch Nails mixer Sean Beavan produced the record, alongside former Skinny Puppy member and longtime producer Dave Ogilvie. The process of creating the album was reputedly a long and <b>difficult</b> <b>one,</b> highlighted by experiments involving sleep deprivation, near-constant drug use, as well as self-harm, with Manson indicating that he would regularly insert sewing needles underneath his own fingernails. During this time, antagonism between band members was high, with most of this directed toward founding member Daisy Berkowitz.|$|E
5|$|Lay {{pleaded not}} guilty to the eleven {{criminal}} charges, and claimed that he was misled by those around him. He attributed the main cause for the company's demise to Fastow. Lay was convicted of all six counts of securities and wire fraud for which he had been tried, and he was subject to a maximum total sentence of 45 years in prison. However, before sentencing was scheduled, Lay died on July 5, 2006. At the time of his death, the SEC had been seeking more than $90 million from Lay in addition to civil fines. The case of Lay's wife, Linda, is a <b>difficult</b> <b>one.</b> She sold roughly 500,000 shares of Enron ten minutes to thirty minutes before the information that Enron was collapsing went public on November 28, 2001. Linda was never charged with any of the events related to Enron.|$|E
5|$|The Flames re-signed Conroy {{to a new}} {{contract}} prior to the 2008–09 season and named him an alternate captain. He scored his 500th career point on January 3, 2009, when he assisted on Todd Bertuzzi's game-winning goal in a 3–2 win against the Nashville Predators, and finished the year with 48 points. The 2009–10 season proved a <b>difficult</b> <b>one</b> for Conroy, as he scored only three goals and 12 assists during a season shortened by wrist and knee injures along with a broken foot. He returned for another season as the Flames re-signed him to a one-year, two-way contract for the League minimum of $500,000. At the age of 39 years, Conroy played his 1,000th NHL game, against the Colorado Avalanche, on October 28, 2010. Only Grant Ledyard was older (age 40) when he reached that milestone.|$|E

5|$|Worldwide {{identified}} {{reserves in}} 2008 were {{estimated by the}} US Geological Survey (USGS) to be 13 million tonnes, though an accurate estimate of world lithium reserves is <b>difficult.</b> <b>One</b> {{reason for this is}} that most lithium classification schemes are developed for solid ore deposits, whereas brine is a fluid that is problematic to treat with the same classification scheme due to varying concentrations and pumping effects. The world has been estimated to contain about 15 million tonnes of lithium reserves, while 65 million tonnes of known resources are reasonable. A total of 75% of everything can typically be found in the ten largest deposits of the world. Another study noted that 83% of the geological resources of lithium are located in six brine, two pegmatite, and two sedimentary deposits.|$|E
5|$|Andrić was {{appointed}} Yugoslavia's ambassador to Germany in late March or early April 1939. This appointment, Hawkesworth writes, shows he was highly regarded by his country's leadership. In 1934, Yugoslavia's King Alexander had been assassinated in Marseille. He was succeeded by his ten-year-old son Peter, and a regency council led by Peter's uncle Paul {{was established to}} rule in his place until he turned 18. Paul's government established closer economic and political ties with Germany. In March 1941, Yugoslavia signed the Tripartite Pact, pledging support for Germany and Italy. Though the negotiations had occurred behind Andrić's back, {{in his capacity as}} ambassador he was obliged to attend the document's signing in Berlin. Andrić had previously been instructed to delay agreeing to the Axis powers' demands for as long as possible. He was highly critical of the move, and on 17 March, wrote to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs asking to be relieved of his duties. Ten days later, pro-Western Royal Yugoslav Air Force officers overthrew the regency and proclaimed Peter of age. This led to a breakdown in relations with Germany and prompted Adolf Hitler to order Yugoslavia's invasion. Given these circumstances, Andrić's position was an extremely <b>difficult</b> <b>one.</b> Nevertheless, he used the little influence he had and attempted unsuccessfully to assist Polish prisoners following the German invasion of Poland in September 1939.|$|E
5|$|Smith {{resumed his}} {{football}} career {{back at home}} with Keighley Central Club. A goalkeeper, he was still playing for Keighley Central in 1948 when he was offered a trial with his local Football League side Bradford City, {{who were at the}} time in the Third Division North. His trial was unsuccessful and he was released. Instead, Smith joined Lancashire Combination League side Nelson. He was still living in Keighley, and travelled to Nelson by bus with his brother Jack, who had previously played for Leeds United but had been released when Major Frank Buckley took over as manager and instead also joined Nelson. Smith played for Nelson for three years {{at a time when the}} club were competing at the top of the Lancashire Combination and sought re-election back into the Football League. However, Smith initially gave up the game when Nelson could no longer afford to pay him. He was not long out of the game before he signed Rossendale United, a member of the Lancashire Combination's Second Division. Smith said the journey by bus was a <b>difficult</b> <b>one</b> so he bought a motorbike. However, like Nelson, Rossendale could not afford to pay him, and after another two years, Smith gave up the game once again.|$|E
