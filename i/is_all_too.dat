25|$|During 1985, Den and Angie {{celebrate}} their seventeenth wedding anniversary {{but it soon}} becomes clear that their marriage is a sham. Behind the scenes of their great business partnership, {{there is not much}} of a relationship going on. Den has a posh mistress Jan Hammond (Jane How), a fact that Angie <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>too</b> aware of. Early in the year, Den even manages to get on holiday to Spain with Jan, telling Angie that he is checking out a possible time-share holiday home purchase. With Den gone, Angie does what she always does in times of trouble, and turns to alcohol to drown her sorrows. She also sets about trying to seduce the men of Walford in a bid to get back at her philandering husband. Lofty Holloway (Tom Watt), Simon Wicks (Nick Berry) and even Arthur Fowler (Bill Treacher) are all subject to Angie's not-so-subtle flirting, but her only successful conquest is local builder, Tony Carpenter (Oscar James). Tony falls for Angie, but she is only using him to get back at Den. The affair is conducted in secret, but they are caught in a passionate clinch in the middle of The Queen Vic by Sharon. Angie has to bribe her daughter to ensure her silence, and even informs her about Den's infidelity. Sharon is disgusted that both her parents are guilty of adultery. Upon Den's return from his holiday, Angie calls off the affair, but it isn't long before Sharon gives Den the impression that her mother has been up to no good. Den confronts Angie, and she admits to the affair, but unfortunately for her, Den isn't concerned about her infidelity, more about his reputation, which upsets Angie even more.|$|E

Scalia warned that if one accepted that constitutional standards should evolve with a maturing society, [...] "the risk of assessing evolving standards is that it <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>too</b> easy to believe that evolution has culminated in one's own views". He compared the Constitution to statutes he contended were not understood to change their meaning through time.|$|E

Hajibagheri said [...] "The appearance of Beyoncé's vocal alongside ringtones on Telephone adds {{to the sense of}} utter chaos." [...] White elaborated that [...] " [...] celebrates a heedless refusal to communicate; to mindlessly, heartlessly indulge pop culture—Tarantino style." [...] Melanie Bertoldi from Billboard gave the song a positive review, stating [...] "Much like Kesha's 'Blah Blah Blah', 'Telephone' sets out to silence bugaboos, with whom featured artist Beyoncé <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>too</b> familiar. ...

500|$|In the 1978 {{edition of}} their book , Roy Carr and Tony Tyler said that Harrison had [...] "desperately" [...] {{employed}} [...] "last-minute devices" [...] to save Extra Texture, by featuring [...] "'zany' ex-Bonzo Dog Band drummer 'Legs' Larry Smith on a track, and by instructing his graphic designers to 'get a little humour into the packaging'. They do; and 'Legs' duly sings; but it <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>too</b> little, too late." [...] Writing in 1981, NME critic Bob Woffinden identified {{the song and}} the album art, {{as well as the}} single [...] "You", as evidence that Harrison was attempting to re-engage with his listeners. Woffinden welcomed this approach but, noting the lack of a lyric sheet with the album, he added: [...] " [...] is not a success, since most of the vocals are lost in the raucous mix; Larry might have had pearls of wisdom to impart, but who could tell?" [...] More recently, Richard Ginell of AllMusic has described the song as a [...] "baffling salute" [...] to Smith, while former Mojo editor Mat Snow dismisses it as [...] "a throwaway among throwaways".|$|E
500|$|Among Harrison biographers, Simon Leng {{describes}} [...] "This Guitar" [...] as a [...] "harrowing song", with a [...] "passionate and powerful" [...] Harrison vocal, {{and draws}} parallels {{between it and}} Neil Young's similarly anti-journalistic [...] "Ambulance Blues". Elliot Huntley says that, while Harrison's decision to write a follow-up to [...] "While My Guitar Gently Weeps" [...] was misguided, the sequel is [...] "a good song in its own right, with excellent lead guitar work from the master". Ian Inglis writes of the [...] "gulf" [...] separating Harrison's 1968 composition from the 1975 song: [...] "While {{the first was a}} poignant and satisfying commentary that drew attention to his newfound maturity as a songwriter, this is a petulant and rather arrogant statement in which he appears to want to put himself above criticism ... Both words and music depict a sour and troubled performer, whose resentment <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>too</b> clear." [...] Dale Allison describes [...] "This Guitar" [...] as a [...] "beautiful song" [...] with [...] "ardent lyrics", and groups it with Harrison compositions such as [...] "Isn't It a Pity", [...] "The Light That Has Lighted the World", [...] "Blow Away" [...] and [...] "Sat Singing" [...] – all songs that [...] "remain close to the hearts of those familiar with them".|$|E

Some of the brain teasers feel a bit {{recycled}} - instead of foxes and chickens, you're shuttling dogs and cats across the river, for example - but there's more than enough variety to warrant doggedly tracking down every last one. But if you only solve the ones you need to move the story forward, that's ok, too." [...] The Guardian gave it four stars out of five, saying, [...] "If you've not {{been a fan of}} the series, this isn't the game that's going to change your mind. For everybody else though, Professor Layton & The Spectre's Call is several days of commute-improving, grey cell stimulation in a mostly effective package. [...] And bravo to Nintendo for keeping this franchise on the standard DS rather than – for the time being, at least – adding that third dimension." [...] However, The Daily Telegraph gave it two-and-a-half stars out of five, saying, [...] "The Layton charm is undoubtedly still present, but it's not enough to carry the series by itself. Upon solving certain puzzles, Layton exclaims 'I love the thrill of a good solution'. So do we, Hershel, so do we. And in this Layton game, sadly, that thrill <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>too</b> rare." ...|$|E

500|$|Peter Brown {{wrote in}} his memoir, The Love You Make: An Insider's Story of the Beatles, that he had once found a suicide note written by Epstein and had spoken with him about it. According to Brown the note read in part, [...] "This <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>too</b> much and I can't take it any more". Brown had also found a will in which Epstein left his house and money {{to his mother and}} his brother, with Brown also being named as a minor beneficiary. When confronted with the notes, Epstein told Brown that he would be {{grateful}} if Brown did not tell anyone, and was sorry he had made Brown worry. He explained that when he wrote the note and composed the will he had simply taken one pill too many, and that {{he had no intention of}} overdosing, promising to be more careful in the future. Brown later wrote that he wondered if he had done the right thing by not showing the note to Epstein's doctor, Norman Cowan, who would have stopped prescribing drugs. The coroner, Gavin Thurston, told the Westminster inquest that Epstein's death was caused by an overdose of Carbitral, and ruled it as an accidental death. The pathologist, Dr. Donald Teare, stated that Epstein had been taking bromide in the form of Carbitral for some time, and that the barbiturate level in Epstein's blood was a [...] "low fatal level".|$|E
500|$|As A Game of Thrones begins, Tyrion is a witty, hedonistic curiosity, {{protected}} {{by his family}} status but still the object of subtle derision. He {{is perhaps the most}} intelligent member of his family but is consistently underestimated and marginalized. Tyrion embraces the advantages of being a Lannister {{but at the same time}} <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>too</b> aware of its negative aspects and his own place as the embarrassment of the family. Initially he is the one Lannister remotely sympathetic to the Starks but he is soon caught in the middle of the conflict between the two Houses. Taken prisoner and put on trial for his life, [...] "all of his skills at conniving must be brought to bear simply to stay alive". With the Starks and Lannisters fully at war, Tywin tasks Tyrion to manage affairs at King's Landing, recognizing that his son is intelligent and has inherited his skills with statecraft. In A Clash of Kings, Tyrion relishes his new power but finds that his sincere efforts to stabilize his nephew Joffrey's rule are being undermined and thwarted by the misguided and self-serving machinations of everyone around him. He plots to nullify the counterproductive whims of Joffrey and Cersei but the [...] "much-maligned dwarf" [...] finds himself [...] "teetering between order and disaster as he tries to keep the Lannisters from losing absolutely everything". Thomas M. Wagner calls it a [...] "defining moment" [...] when Tyrion comments that he is all that keeps chaos from overwhelming the family and population who both despise him. Roberta Johnson of Booklist likens Tyrion to the calculating title character of Robert Graves' I, Claudius.|$|E
500|$|Kwame Opam at The Verge {{chose to}} examine rape {{and the nature}} of consent in the season. Comparing Jessica Jones to other {{television}} series that have depicted rape (Game of Thrones, Orange Is the New Black, and Outlander), Opam felt that [...] "since rape is one of the show’s core themes, we never need to see it... rape is a foundational part of the text, and its presence is constant. Even if it’s invisible, it’s always there." [...] He also felt the season took the time to examine how rape happens and what it means, especially in terms of power and consent, concluding, [...] "Jessica Jones moves the conversation about rape forward by treating it as a complex subject worth investigating, rather than as spice for a story...Maybe we don’t need to see it anymore to grasp how violent it is. Maybe our energies are better spent thinking deeply about why it happens at all." [...] The Guardians Lili Loofbourow also discussed the season's depiction of rape and consent, noting the complications that come with Kilgrave telling his victims how to feel rather than just how to act, and saying, [...] "however exceptional Kilgrave’s power seems, the moral quagmire it produces <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>too</b> common. It’s the condition of the rape victim who had an orgasm during her assault. It’s the condition of the soldier trained to kill when he suspects his targets are innocent. It’s the condition of the battered woman who goes back to her abuser and stays “of her own free will”. It’s the condition of...any person, really, who agrees, whatever the context, to consent to forgo consent in the future." [...] Loofbourow also discussed the character of Simpson, comparing his power-inducing red pill to the anti-feminist [...] "red pillers", and noting that his taking of the pills [...] "renders him not just dangerously delusional, but so utterly at odds with nature and reality of any kind that he will forget to breathe unless he counteracts the pill’s effects." ...|$|E

2500|$|Sperry's first book, One Day with Manu, a colorfully {{illustrated}} tale {{of everyday}} life in Bora Bora, appeared in 1933. Critic Joan McGrath, cautions modern readers to take his depictions of other cultures in context, stating, [...] "His early work, such as the tales of Manu, Jambi, and Tuktu, {{are unlikely to be}} found in library collections of today, in an era rendered more sensitive to the feelings of minority cultures and racial pride than in the 1930s.

2500|$|According to Joseph Pearce, As {{with so much}} of Campbell's satire, The Georgiad's invective is too vindictive. It <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>too</b> often {{spoiled by}} spite. This {{underlying}} weakness has obscured the more serious points its author sought to make. Embedded between the attacks on Bertrand Russell, Marie Stopes, Vita Sackville-West, Virginia Woolf {{and a host of}} other Bloomsbury's and Georgians are classically refined objections to the prevailing philosophy of scepticism, mounted like pearls of wisdom in the basest of metal. [...] "Nor knew the Greeks, save in the laughing page, The philosophic emblem of our age."... The [...] "damp philosophy" [...] of the modern world, as espoused by the archetypical modern poet, was responsible for the prevailing pessimism and disillusionment of the post-war world. In preaching such a philosophy, which was [...] "the fountain source of all his woes", the poet's [...] "damp philosophy" [...] left him [...] "damp in spirit". Nihilism was self-negating. It was the philosophy of the self-inflicted wound. In the rejection of post-war pessimism and its nihilistic ramifications... Campbell was uniting himself with others, such as T.S. Eliot and Evelyn Waugh, who were similarly seeking glimmers of philosophical light amidst the prevailing gloom. In his case, as in theirs, the philosophical search would lead him to orthodox Christianity.|$|E
