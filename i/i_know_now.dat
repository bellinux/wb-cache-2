25|$|The reason I didn't {{review the}} book is that it perhaps would have taken me three weeks. My {{appreciation}} {{of it is that}} diverse and that complicated... John is perhaps the only contemporary writer who <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>now</b> who gives me the sense of the fact that life is—the life that we perform is in an environment that enjoys a grandeur that escapes us. Rabbit is very much possessed of a paradise lost, of a paradise known fleetingly perhaps through erotic love and a paradise that he pursues through his children. It's the vastness of John's scope that I would have described if I could through a review.|$|E
25|$|If I {{knew what}} <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>now</b> I {{probably}} would have switched. At the time I had already been playing two or three years, {{and it seemed like}} I had been playing a long time. I thought I’d never be able to change the way I played. The reality of the situation was that I hadn’t been playing very long at all, and I probably could have spent {{the same amount of time}} learning to play right handed. I did have a go at it, but I just didn’t have the patience. It seemed impossible to me. I decided to make do with what I had, and I made some plastic fingertips for myself. I just persevered with it.|$|E
500|$|Before the 1992–93 NBA season, Johnson {{announced}} {{his intention to}} stage an NBA comeback. After practicing and playing in several pre-season games, he returned to retirement {{before the start of}} the regular season, citing controversy over his return sparked by opposition from several active players. In an August, 2011 interview Johnson said that in retrospect, he wished that he had never retired after being diagnosed with HIV, saying, [...] "If I knew what <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>now,</b> I wouldn't have retired." [...] Johnson said that despite the physical, highly competitive practices and scrimmages leading up to the 1992 Olympics, some of those same teammates still expressed concerns about his return to the NBA. He said that he retired because he [...] "didn't want to hurt the game." ...|$|E

500|$|Lieutenant Lillian Pimlott {{wrote to}} her mother, after being {{deployed}} to Pearl Harbor, and said, [...] "I {{was fascinated by the}} ships which are making history in every battle. I've talked to seamen and I've met flyers-from Iwo (Iwo Jima), from Okinawa, heroes from every encounter. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>now</b> what war means and {{my heart goes out to}} every one of them. Among them I am making, I hope, life long friends, for their experiences mean everything to my self-satisfaction... As long as they fight on, I have no desire to return home, for I feel I belong here... I have learned much in these brief three months about life and living. And I know I have already changed in many ways and many viewpoints... It is truly a most broadening experience and I shall never outlive it".|$|E
500|$|Astonishing Stories is not {{remembered as}} {{being among the}} best science fiction magazines: both critic Peter Nicholls and sf writer Jack Williamson have {{described}} it as a [...] "training ground" [...] for writers who would go on to do their best work elsewhere. [...] However, Nicholls adds that [...] "its stories were surprisingly good considering how little was paid for them", and Wolf and Thompson agree, claiming that [...] "there was much that was memorable in Astonishing, both by way of immediate appeal and of more lasting quality". [...] Pohl himself, who later became a very successful magazine editor, felt he made many mistakes. [...] He quotes as an example his serialization of Malcolm Jameson's story [...] "Quicksands of Youthwardness" [...] in three parts; the story was only 27,000 words long, and readers complained (justifiably, in Pohl's view) that serializing it in a bimonthly magazine meant they had to wait for five months to read the whole story, in relatively small 9,000-word pieces. [...] Overall, Pohl assessed his performance by saying [...] "I wasn't really a very good editor"; adding [...] "With what <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>now</b> I could have made those magazines sing, but as it was they just lay there".|$|E
2500|$|Dan Rather stated, [...] "if I {{knew then}} what <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>now</b> — I {{would not have}} gone ahead with the story as it was aired, and I {{certainly}} would not have used the documents in question." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I've {{seen him}} in the light. I flashed a candle in his face. I saw it. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> him <b>now.</b> He was there at Stonebridge with us, and <b>I</b> never <b>knew</b> him. But <b>I</b> <b>know</b> him <b>now.</b> His name is--" ...|$|R

2500|$|On September 20, CBS {{retracted}} the story. Rather stated, [...] "If I {{knew then}} what <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>now,</b> I {{would not have}} gone ahead with the story as it was aired, and I certainly would not have used the documents in question." [...] The controversy {{has been referred to}} by some as [...] "Memogate" [...] and [...] "Rathergate." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{speaking}} about the show in 2010, Bain reflected: [...] "We had some very good science fiction people as advisors who {{knew what they were}} talking about. For instance, they knew that sound up there wouldn't travel, and it would just be quiet up there. But then we wouldn't have a series, so we couldn't do that. There were various considerations that had to be made, but they were based on what is, or what was, known at the time. For all <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>now</b> it's out of date. I don't really know." ...|$|E
2500|$|Next, Henslow {{called upon}} Admiral Robert FitzRoy, {{who had been}} Darwin's captain and {{companion}} on the voyage of the Beagle twenty-five years earlier. FitzRoy denounced Darwin's book and, [...] "lifting an immense Bible first {{with both hands and}} afterwards with one hand over his head, solemnly implored the audience to believe God rather than man". He was believed to have said: [...] "I believe that this is the Truth, and had I known then what <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>now,</b> I would not have taken him [...] aboard the Beagle." ...|$|E
60|$|For I didn't {{want it to}} get {{talked about}} and be put into all the newspapers. And <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>now</b> if <b>I</b> {{wanted to keep it}} out, I must first be silent.|$|R
60|$|And as I listened {{the sense}} of triumph filled my bitter heart, for <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>now</b> that by my own hand should this ruined woman die and the justice of the Gods be done.|$|R
60|$|I {{went down}} the broad steps, walked out up the lawn, and {{surveyed}} house and trees and garden and sky. To the heights and the depths and the uttermost, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>now</b> {{what it was to}} be amazed....|$|R
2500|$|On December 31, 2007, at age 77, Moore was {{released}} from prison on parole after serving 32 years of her life sentence. Ford had died from natural causes on December 26, 2006, one year and five days before her release. Moore has stated that she regrets the assassination attempt, saying she was [...] "blinded by her radical political views". Moore {{was released}} under a federal law that makes parole mandatory for inmates who have served at least 30 years of a life sentence and have maintained a satisfactory disciplinary record. When asked about her crime in an interview, Moore stated, [...] "I am very glad I did not succeed. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>now</b> that I was wrong to try." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{a sophomore}} at Alabama in 1999–2000, the 21-year-old Cotton was the team's most veteran player. [...] With four {{freshman}} starters, the Crimson Tide were among the youngest teams in Division I. Although the team struggled, Cotton averaged a team-leading 15.5 points and 4.6 rebounds per game, and he earned second-team all-conference honors in the Southeastern Conference (SEC). Playing out of position as an undersized power forward, he did not help to address critics of his perimeter skills. Forgoing his remaining {{two years of college}} eligibility, he hired an agent and declared early for the NBA. In 2010, he expressed disappointment in his college experience. [...] "If I had known what <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>now,</b> I would probably have skipped college,” said Cotton.|$|E
2500|$|On December 19, Duty offered Wise some {{cigarettes}} {{in exchange for}} allowing himself to be tied up to make the guards think {{that he had been}} taken hostage, with the goal of having Duty transferred into administrative security. The prosecutor's report stated that after tying Wise's hands and feet behind his back, Duty strangled him to death with a shoelace. Duty then wrote a letter to Wise's mother Mary, in which he stated: [...] "Well {{by the time you get}} this letter you will already know that your son is dead. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>now</b> because I just killed him an hour ago. Gee you'd think I'd be feeling some remorse but I'm not." [...] The letter was intercepted at the prison.|$|E
60|$|Six ladies {{leaned forward}} in their places, {{and looked at me}} with {{flashing}} eyes. It was a suitable triumph for Mr. de Valentin. And yet <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>now</b> all that <b>I</b> desired. Dimly I began to understand the great plot, and all that it meant.|$|R

2500|$|Goldstone {{wrote that}} [...] "If I had known then what <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>now,</b> the Goldstone Report {{would have been}} a {{different}} document." [...] He said that the lack of Israeli cooperation had meant that no Israeli officers were interviewed during the writing of the report. In hindsight, incidents that had been interpreted as the deliberate targeting of civilians may have had other explanations, such as poor intelligence information. Goldstone also praised Israel for investigating claims of war crimes while faulting Hamas for its failure to launch any investigations of its own forces. Goldstone commended Israel for responding to his report by revising military procedures e.g. to discontinue the use of white phosphorus (including as a smokescreen) in or near civilian areas.|$|E
2500|$|Castro, on {{the other}} hand, was {{convinced}} that an invasion of Cuba was soon at hand, and on October 26, he sent a telegram to Khrushchev that appeared {{to call for a}} pre-emptive nuclear strike on the US in case of attack. However, in a 2010 interview, Castro expressed regret about his earlier stance on first use: [...] "After I've seen what I've seen, and knowing what <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>now,</b> it wasn't worth it at all." [...] Castro also ordered all anti-aircraft weapons in Cuba to fire on any US aircraft: the orders had been to fire only on groups of two or more. At 6:00am EDT on October 27, the CIA delivered a memo reporting that three of the four missile sites at San Cristobal and the two sites at Sagua la Grande appeared to be fully operational. It also noted that the Cuban military continued to organize for action but was under order not to initiate action unless attacked.|$|E
2500|$|While many of {{her books}} were best sellers, critics were most appreciative of her murder mysteries. Rinehart, in The Circular Staircase (1908), is {{credited}} with inventing the [...] "Had-I-But-Known" [...] school of mystery writing. In The Circular Staircase [...] "a middle-aged spinster is persuaded by her niece and nephew to rent a country house for the summer. The gentle, peace-loving trio is plunged {{into a series of}} crimes solved {{with the help of the}} aunt." [...] The Had-I-But-Known mystery novel is one where the principal character (frequently female) does things in connection with a crime that have the effect of prolonging the action of the novel. Ogden Nash parodied the school in his poem Don't Guess Let Me Tell You: [...] "Sometimes the Had I But Known then what <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>now</b> I could have saved at least three lives by revealing to the Inspector the conversation I heard through that fortuitous hole in the floor." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>knew,</b> <b>now,</b> {{how great}} my uncle's rage was; for {{nothing short of}} his being almost beside himself would have induced him to utter that {{concluding}} word, which he held in such repugnance that it was never spoken or hinted at before him on any account.|$|R
60|$|After that I haunted {{the spot}} every time I could get away, {{creeping}} {{down to the}} river bank and lying in hiding hours long at a stretch; for <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>now</b> that the otters lived there, and they gave me many glimpses of a life I had never seen before.|$|R
60|$|When I {{heard that}} astounding answer, all my {{thoughts}} were startled {{back on the}} instant to my parting with Lady Glyde. I can hardly say I reproached myself, {{but at that moment}} I think I would have given many a year's hard savings to have known four hours earlier what <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>now.</b>|$|R
2500|$|After {{the news}} broke {{at the end}} of the week tributes have poured in for the former Ajax and Netherlands legend, with all Eredivisie games {{featuring}} a round of applause on 14 minutes, Cruyff’s former shirt number. Ahead of their league game against Eibar at the Camp Nou (25 October 2015), Barcelona players showed their support for Cruyff by wearing orange T-shirts bearing the words 'Ànims Johan' (Catalan for 'Get well soon Johan'). Writing in his weekly De Telegraaf column, Cruyff admitted, “Often the media are an additional tax, but the last week that has been different. The way in which a reply is posted via a variety of media in my situation, was emotional and heartwarming. I am extremely proud of the appreciation shown by all responses.” On his condition, Cruyff added, “Meanwhile, we have to wait. It’s really annoying that it has been leaked so quickly, because the only thing <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>now</b> is that I have lung cancer. No more. Because the investigation is ongoing.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Butler's {{last line}} in Gone with the Wind, [...] "Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn," [...] {{is one of}} the most famous lines in movie history. Gable was an almost {{immediate}} favorite for the role of Rhett with both the public and producer David O. Selznick. Since Selznick had no male stars under long-term contract, though, he needed to go through the process of negotiating to borrow an actor from another studio. Gary Cooper was Selznick's first choice. When Cooper turned down the role of Butler, he was quoted as saying, [...] "Gone With the Wind is going to be the biggest flop in Hollywood history. I’m glad it'll be Clark Gable who's falling flat on his nose, not me." [...] By then, Selznick had become determined to hire Gable, and set about finding a way to borrow him from MGM. Gable was wary of potentially disappointing an audience that had decided that no one else could play the part. He later conceded, [...] "I think <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>now</b> how a fly must react after being caught in a spider's web." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{authenticity}} of the documents was challenged within hours on Internet forums and blogs, with questions initially focused on alleged anachronisms in the documents' typography. [...] Content soon spread to the mass media. Although CBS and Rather defended the authenticity and usage of the documents for a two-week period, continued scrutiny from other news organizations and independent analysis of the documents obtained by USA Today and CBS raised questions about their validity {{and led to a}} public repudiation on September 20, 2004. Rather stated, [...] "if I knew then what <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>now</b> – I would not have gone ahead with the story as it was aired, and I certainly would not have used the documents in question," [...] and CBS News President Andrew Heyward said, [...] "Based on what we now know, CBS News cannot prove that the documents are authentic, which is the only acceptable journalistic standard to justify using them in the report. We should not have used them. That was a mistake, which we deeply regret." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{could not}} {{wait for her to}} be more explicit. <b>Knowing</b> what <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>now,</b> the memory of Miss Fairlie's look and manner at the breakfast-table told me that the {{expected}} visitor at Limmeridge House was her future husband.

"I wish I knew," [...] resumed Mrs. Abbott; {{for there}} existed in her head, {{as well as}} in that of Mr. Dodge, such a total {{confusion}} on the subject of deportment, that neither saw nor felt the cool sarcasm of the old sailor; [...] "I wish <b>I</b> <b>knew,</b> <b>now,</b> whether Eve Effingham has really been regenerated!
