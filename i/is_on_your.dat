500|$|Most reviewers {{felt that}} though the {{gameplay}} and storyline {{had not changed}} much since the first games, Diamond and Pearl were still engaging. Ryan Davis of GameSpot said, [...] "t's a little surprising how well the formula holds up in Diamond and Pearl, which {{is a testament to}} the strong fundamentals of the series as well as the quality of the execution." [...] The games' Wi-Fi connectivity also earned largely positive reviews. 1UP.com called the addition of wireless connectivity the games' [...] "biggest improvements". GameSpot and GameSpy both listed the addition of online play as one of the positive points of the games and called the system [...] "robust" [...] and [...] "probably the most significant new feature."

500|$|Joey Thurmond of Push Square wrote how playing {{through the}} {{campaign}} from Modern Warfare {{reminded him of}} its sheer memorability and how it had long endured with fans compared with other games in the series, saying [...] "there's tension and gravity shot through the experience, {{as if the world}} <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> shoulders to push past every enemy line with explosive bravado or exacting stealth. [...] There's a grounded feel to player characters that make you another cog in the machine with the abilities and limitations of an ordinary soldier, not a supernatural saviour." [...] He praised the game's graphical enhancements, saying [...] "Modern Warfare Remastered looks and sounds like a fresh game on par with today's graphical and aural standards" [...] and calling it a [...] "ridiculously faithful remake", but wrote that the game still showed some slight signs of age, such as artificial intelligence problems and pacing issues. In short, he commended Raven Software [...] "for arguably delivering the most substantial, masterful remake we have ever experienced", and that [...] "Modern Warfare Remastered celebrates this legacy with updated visuals and sound that really go above and beyond the call of duty, sprucing up an old care package for a more modern age to near-perfection." ...|$|E

While art therapy may involve learning skills or art techniques, the emphasis is generally first on developing and expressing images that come from inside the person, rather than those he or she sees in the outside world. And while some traditional art classes may ask you to paint or draw from your imagination, in art therapy, your inner world of images, feelings, thoughts, and ideas are always of primary importance to the experience.|$|E

Grierson respected Flaherty immensely for {{his contributions}} to documentary form and his attempts to use the camera to bring alive the lives of everyday people and everyday events. [...] Less commendable in Grierson's view was Flaherty's focus on exotic and faraway cultures. ("In the profounder kind of way", wrote Grierson of Flaherty, [...] "we live and prosper each of us by denouncing the other").
