I wouldn't want to exaggerate, because in the end it's only football, but Rivera <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> a genius." [...] — Nereo Rocco on Rivera. Rivera was highly regarded for his outstanding ball control, dribbling skills, and excellent technique, {{as well as his}} quick feet, acceleration over short distances, agility, and balance on the ball, which allowed him to change direction quickly, and dribble past players with ease. Despite his notable skill, technical ability, and elegance on the ball, Rivera would often avoid undertaking individual dribbling runs or challenging defenders gratuitously in one on one situations, in particular in his later career, unless he deemed them necessary; he preferred instead to create space and chances for his team through his precise passing game and offensive movement. Indeed, above all, Rivera was known for his excellent vision, ability to interpret the game, and his sublime range of passing, which allowed him to control his team's play in midfield with short exchanges, spread long passes across the pitch, or even play the ball first time, and also made him an excellent assist provider from any position on the field, with both feet; in 2011, former playmaker and UEFA president Michel Platini described Rivera {{as one of the greatest}} passers in the history of the sport.|$|E

The outpouring of support and the show of appreciation that {{has been given to}} me from friends, fans and my peers has been just tremendous. …overwhelming even. I do agree with Joe’s post. Pearl Jam has always seemingly had a perceived level of integrity and has been known to stand their ground & fight the good fight, but it seems the allure of being given this trophy is just to important for them to take a stand. I want to let you all know that ultimately, it’s gonna be okay. We still have the music and no amount of corporate conglomerate or ticky-tack bullshit can keep us from enjoying the power of the music we love. The fact that we find ourselves fighting for the integrity of the validity of a segment of Pearl Jam history to be acknowledged is straight up beautiful. The reason we have to is what the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame is supposed to have been built to celebrate; The love of the music. I have always thought that every award given to a band that celebrates the bands lifetime achievements should be awarded to every person that was ever a debt incurring, life sacrificing, blood spilling, member of that band. Maybe the Hall should reevaluate the need to put all the monkeys in the same cage in order to boost revenue, and instead let the history of the band be fully and completely represented as they were and as they are. …leave it up to the group to show their true colors as they celebrate their own history in a manner of their choosing. I don’t know. But whoever is ultimately responsible for the decision that deemed my work with Pearl Jam as an effort that was not important enough to grant me induction knows nothing of what we accomplished, and I am personally {{at a loss for words}} for how Stone, Mike, Jeff, Matt, Edward and Kelly Curtis are accepting of such an injustice. I will admit to wanting to look out over my drum kit at the faces of Jeff, Stone, Mike and Eddie. Looking to my left at my drum tech, the mainest of mellow, Mr. Jimmy Shoaf and seeing him give me that look that dares me to destroy my cymbals and kick the songs ass, the bands ass and the crowds ass… The idea of counting it off and giving the band, the music & the people all that I have to give, as I always have without compromise or hesitation… The sound of the people singing along… Making eye contact with the person air drumming their ass off right before the big drum fill, so we can do it together…I loved it. I loved it every single time. If you were there, then you know what this band Pearl Jam was like when it had something to prove. Well, we proved it every single time. Show after show. I was there and I am still proud to be a part of what Pearl Jam was. My point <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> to share the fact that what Pearl Jam once was, is what is still, and will always be Pearl Jam. I know things are tough. We need music, each other and the spirit of Rock & Roll now, more than ever before. Thanks for everything, everyone.
