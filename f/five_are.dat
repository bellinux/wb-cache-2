5|$|Archaeological {{investigations}} have {{found evidence of}} domestication of Cucurbita going back over 8,000 years from the very southern parts of Canada down to Argentina and Chile. Centers of domestication stretch from the Mississippi River watershed and Texas down through Mexico and Central America to northern and western South America. Of the 27 species that Nee delineates, <b>five</b> <b>are</b> domesticated. Four of them, C.argyrosperma, C.ficifolia, C.moschata, and C.pepo, originated and were domesticated in Mesoamerica; for the fifth, C.maxima, these events occurred in South America.|$|E
5|$|By definition, modern {{democratic}} constitutional monarchies are parliamentary, {{as there}} is no elected head of state who could assume non-ceremonial competences; of the twenty one republican member states of the European Union, only one is a presidential republic (Cyprus) and <b>five</b> <b>are</b> semi-presidential republics (France, Lithuania, Poland, Portugal and Romania). These six (semi-)presidential republics elect their president by direct popular vote. Among the fourteen parliamentary republics, half do the same (namely Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Finland, Ireland, Slovakia and Slovenia), whereas in the remaining seven (Estonia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia and Malta), the president is elected by parliament or other special representative body such as the German Bundesversammlung.|$|E

5|$|Each {{instalment}} is {{a separate}} adaptation of a short story, ranges between 30 and 50 minutes in duration, and features well-known British actors such as Clive Swift, Robert Hardy, Peter Vaughan, Edward Petherbridge and Denholm Elliott. The first <b>five</b> <b>are</b> adaptations of ghost stories by M. R. James, the sixth {{is based on a}} short story by Charles Dickens, and the two final instalments are original screenplays by Clive Exton and John Bowen respectively. The stories were titled A Ghost Story for Christmas in listings such as the Radio Times, although this never appeared on screen, where they were regarded as individual films.|$|E

Twenty-two species are protected nationally; <b>five</b> <b>are</b> listed on the annex OO of the Bonn Convention, which aims to conserve migratory species throughout their range. However, no species {{can be considered as}} heritage. The northern goshawk and Eurasian sparrowhawk benefit from the abundance of sparrows feeding. The common grasshopper warbler stops there during its migration and the common nightingale nests there occasionally.|$|E

Blyton concluded several of her long-running series in 1963, publishing the last books of The Famous Five (<b>Five</b> <b>Are</b> Together Again) and The Secret Seven (Fun for the Secret Seven); she also produced three more Brer Rabbit books with the illustrator Grace Lodge: Brer Rabbit Again, Brer Rabbit Book, and Brer Rabbit's a Rascal.

5|$|Of {{the nine}} figures depicted, <b>five</b> <b>are</b> looking {{directly}} {{out at the}} royal couple or the viewer. Their glances, along with the king and queen's reflection, affirm the royal couple's presence outside the painted space. Alternatively, art historians H. W. Janson and Joel Snyder suggest {{that the image of}} the king and queen is a reflection from Velázquez's canvas, the front of which is obscured from the viewer. Other writers say the canvas Velázquez is painting is unusually large for a portrait by Velázquez, and is about the same size as Las Meninas. Las Meninas contains the only known double portrait of the royal couple painted by Velázquez.|$|E

The collected volumes have seven chapters each, spanning about a week in series time. The first five volumes cover a summer vacation period.|$|E

In all seven monarchies that are in the EU, the monarch is legally prohibited from using political power, or the monarch does not utilise the political powers vested in the office by convention. At the dawn of the 20th century, France was the only republic among the future members states of the European Union; the ascent of republicanism to the political mainstream only started {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century.

Popular support for the monarchy has historically been higher in Flanders and lower in Wallonia; however, in recent decades these roles have reversed.|$|E
