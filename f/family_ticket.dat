60|$|The Castle grounds {{are very}} ample and very beautiful; {{and as they}} joined the Hotel grounds, with no fences to climb, but only some nobly shaded stone {{stairways}} to descend, we spent a part of nearly every day in idling through their smooth walks and leafy groves. There was an attractive spot among the trees where were a great many wooden tables and benches; and there one could sit in the shade and pretend to sip at his foamy beaker of beer while he inspected the crowd. I say pretend, because I only pretended to sip, without really sipping. That is the polite way; but when {{you are ready to}} go, you empty the beaker at a draught. There was a brass band, and it furnished excellent music every afternoon. Sometimes so many people came that every seat was occupied, every table filled. And never a rough in the assemblage--all nicely dressed fathers and mothers, young gentlemen and ladies and children; and plenty of university students and glittering officers; with here and there a gray professor, or a peaceful old lady with her knitting; and always a sprinkling of gawky foreigners. Everybody had his glass of beer before him, or his cup of coffee, or his bottle of wine, or his hot cutlet and potatoes; young ladies chatted, or fanned themselves, or wrought at their crocheting or embroidering; the students fed sugar to their dogs, or discussed duels, or illustrated new fencing tricks with their little canes; and everywhere was comfort and enjoyment, and everywhere peace and good-will to men. The trees were jubilant with birds, and the paths with rollicking children. One could have a seat in that place and plenty of music, any afternoon, for about eight cents, or a <b>family</b> <b>ticket</b> for the season for two dollars.|$|E

40|$|This thesis aims {{to analyze}} the factors {{influencing}} the attendance of the historical monument, the castle Litice. I am focusing on the standard, reduced and <b>family</b> <b>tickets.</b> For measurement {{of the impact of}} the individual variables I use the daily data from 2004 to 2012. Into the determinants that have impact on the demand for attendance I include the ticket prices, temperature, precipitation, public holidays, weekends, summer holidays and cultural events. The model shows that an increase of ticket price by 1 % will result in increase of sales of <b>family</b> <b>tickets</b> by 2, 4 % ceteris paribus. Regarding the standard and reduced ticket, the resulting coefficient is insignificant. Public holidays, weekends and summer holidays have a positive impact on attendance for all three types of admission. The most significant impact has an annual event "Pochod přes tři hrady" (March through three castles). During this event sales of standard tickets increase by 190 % and sales of reduced tickets are ten times higher ceteris paribus. The events have an insignificant impact on sales of <b>family</b> <b>tickets...</b>|$|R
