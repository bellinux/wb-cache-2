40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{experimental and}} numerical results of intermediate-scale and full-scale fire tests conducted on flexurally strengthened reinforced concrete members. Two full-scale reinforced concrete T-beams and two intermediate-scale slabs were strengthened in flexure with carbon fibre reinforced polymer sheets or plates and insulated {{with a layer}} of spray-on material. T-beams and slabs were then exposed to a standard fire. T-beams were loaded to their service load. Deflections and temperatures were measured during the tests. A numerical finite-difference/volume heat transfer model was used to simulate the temperature field inside the section. The validity of the numerical model was verified by comparing the predicted temperatures with those recorded during the fire test. Fire test results show that <b>fire</b> <b>endurances</b> of more than 4 h can be achieved using an appropriate insulation system. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R

5000|$|Each {{of these}} test {{procedures}} have very similar <b>fire</b> <b>endurance</b> regimes and heat transfer limitations. Differences include the hose-stream tests, which {{are unique to}} Canada and the United States, whereas Germany includes a very rigorous impact test during the fire for firewalls. Germany is unique in including heat induced expansion and collapse of ferrous cable trays into account for firestops, resulting in the favouring of firestop mortars, which tend to hold the penetrating cable tray in place, whereas [...] "softseals", typically made of rockwool and elastomeric toppings, have been demonstrated in testing by Otto Graf institute to be torn open and rendered inoperable when the cable tray expands, pushes in and then collapses. Spin-offs from these basic tests cover closures, firestops and more. Furnace operations, thermocoupling and reporting requirements remain uniform within each country.|$|E

The Black Hand’s standard infantry is the [...] "Confessor Cabal"; {{a squad of}} six Confessor units armed with hallucinogenic grenades (this time a manually activated ability), as well as anti-infantry Gatling guns which can be upgraded with [...] "Charged Particle Beams" [...] to increase their firepower (Charged Particle Beams are also applied to the Shredder Turret for increased firepower). Confessor Cabals also give other nearby allied infantry a buff that increases their rate of <b>fire,</b> their <b>endurance</b> on the battlefield and which renders them more resistant to almost any suppression. All Black Hand shock troops and Flame Tanks come with veteran status by default, and the Commando starts out at the heroic rank, with two such commandos being trainable at any given time, although the commando is not stealthed for this faction. The [...] "Black Disciples" [...] upgrade adds a Black Hand shock troop to all Confessor Cabals and Militant Rocket Squads, in similar fashion to how Confessors {{are added to the}} militia squads of Tiberium Wars. The Black Hand's warmechs, an earlier model of the Avatar warmech, are called [...] "Purifiers" [...] and automatically come equipped with flamethrowers, yet cannot be further upgraded. All flame weaponry of this sub-faction, whether infantry or vehicle-based, can be upgraded with Purifying Flame for much greater damage. In return for all this raw offensive and destructive prowess however, the Black Hand forgo stealthed and air units entirely - including the Call for Transport ability - and the Laser Capacitor is also unavailable to them. Since the Stealth Tank and Venom are both unavailable, a new vehicle called the [...] "Mantis" [...] serves as a specialized anti-aircraft vehicle for the faction - it is very powerful against aircraft, and can also detect stealth units, though it cannot attack targets on the ground. The new Specter artillery unit is still available to the Black Hand, but is not itself stealthed.|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} paper the fire {{behaviour}} of full-locked coil ropes under axial loading conditions is addressed. Since there are no standards for these structural elements, ISO 834 standard curve was considered as fire model for its severity. The analysis of full-locked coil ropes fire behaviour was carried out both from the experimental and numerical point of view, thus obtaining a complete description of rope responses. Two distinct full-locked coil ropes were tested and heat fluxes, temperature fields in the rope cross-section and <b>fire</b> <b>endurance</b> times were determined. An experimental campaign, aimed to establish how wires mechanical properties change with temperature, was also carried out. Subsequently, a parametric Finite Element model (FE) able to predict the rope response, undergoing to the experimental thermal and mechanical loads, was implemented, thus obtaining the time evolution of damage and the failure mechanisms for the rope.

50|$|In {{the years}} prior to production, the Modelo 1905 pistol was tested {{multiple}} times in Europe alongside various other handguns.In late 1898, a board of army officers held a test in Bern, Switzerland between multiple pistols. These pistols included the six shot capacity and 10 shot capacity Mausers, the Bergmann, the Borchardt-Luger, the Roth, and the Mannlicher. The pistols were put through several tests, including assembly, explanation, firing 50 rounds, target shooting, timing while <b>firing,</b> and an <b>endurance</b> test in which the pistol must fire 400 rounds without being cleaned or allowed to cool. The Borchardt-Luger was the only pistol to pass the endurance test. Next, the pistols performed firing 20 rounds after dust and water tests, and the Borchardt-Luger was again, {{the only one to}} pass it without any malfunctions. A second test was held a year later, with the pistols being modified to the board's specifications. The Luger was modified to be much lighter and accurate for these tests that followed. As a result, the Luger became an instant success and the Swiss were the first to adopt it, and its popularity soared from there.The fact that the Modelo 1905 was not comparatively effective in testing against other pistols at the time is likely what led to its declined use in Europe.|$|R
50|$|Santa Fe {{accomplished}} the resupply mission and landed the marines on 25 April. Members of the Argentine garrison had salvaged a crippled BAS launch, {{which was used}} to download the cargo. Some hours later, after leaving Grytviken, Santa Fe was detected on radar by Lieutenant Chris Parry, the observer of the Westland Wessex HAS.3 anti-submarine helicopter from Antrim, and attacked with depth charges. This attack caused extensive internal damage, including the splitting of a ballast tank, the dismounting of electrical components and shocks to the machinery. As the submarine struggled to return to Grytviken on the surface, Plymouth launched a Westland Wasp HAS.1 helicopter, and Brilliant launched a Westland Lynx HAS.2. The Lynx dropped a Mk 46 torpedo, which failed to strike home, but strafed the submarine with its pintle-mounted 7.62 mm L7 General Purpose Machine Gun (GPMG). The Wessex also fired on Santa Fe with its GPMG. The Wasp from HMS Plymouth and two other Wasps launched from <b>Endurance</b> <b>fired</b> AS-12 air-to-surface anti-ship missiles at the submarine, scoring hits. Santa Fes men and the marines onshore attempted to fight off the attack by firing their rifles, machine guns, and an old Bantam anti-tank missile at the aircraft, but the Argentine boat was damaged badly enough to prevent her from submerging or even from sailing away. The crew abandoned the listing submarine at the jetty at King Edward Point on South Georgia and surrendered, along with the Argentine garrison, to the British forces. Brilliants diving officer, Lt. Chris Sherman, went down to place a charge to disable the submarine further, and blew off its rudder.|$|R

40|$|No {{building}} is {{free from the}} threat of fire. A designer, however, can ensure that only limited damage will result if fire breaks out by reducing the over-all fire risk. There are various means at his disposal, but the single design feature that will contribute most to this reduction of risk is his use of fire-resistant construction to separate a building into fire-resistant compartments. Fire-resistant construction may be described as construction that continues to fulfil its function {{during the course of a}} fire, and where walls, Boors and partitions are involved prevents the transmission of fire beyond these boundaries. It must not be confused with non-combustible construction, which may or may not have the requisite degree of fire resistance in a given set or Circumstances. It is, however, frequently necessary to resort to largely non-combustible construction in order to achieve substantial <b>fire</b> <b>endurance</b> (i. e. a long fire resistance time). The fire resistance or <b>fire</b> <b>endurance</b> of a structural element is universally defined in terms of the length of time it will meet certain requirements when e,(posed in a test furnace that follows a specified time-temperature curve. For a particular building the <b>fire</b> <b>endurance</b> requirements are in turn related to the fire load within it...|$|E
40|$|Circular {{steel tube}} filled with steel-reinforced {{high-strength}} concrete {{is a new}} model of composite column design. The fire resistance of this composite column was investigated experimentally. One circular steel tube column filled with steel-reinforced high-strength concrete and one circular steel tube column filled with high- strength concrete were tested under axial load and fire. The test results show that the axial deformations of both kinds of the composite columns under the same load level have experienced three stages variation:the initial expansion deformation stage,the compression deformation gradual growth stage and the damage stage with the dramatic increasing in compression deformation. The second compression stable development stage of the circular steel tube filled with steel-reinforced high-strength concrete is much longer than that of the circular steel tube column filled with high-strength concrete. Thus the <b>fire</b> <b>endurance</b> of the circular steel tube filled with steel-reinforced high-strength concrete reaches 166 minutes while the <b>fire</b> <b>endurance</b> of the circular steel tube column filled with high-strength concrete only reaches 46 minutes. Thus encasig section steel can remarkably improve the <b>fire</b> <b>endurance</b> of the circular steel tube filled with high-strength concrete.

40|$|The use of Near Surface Mounted (NSM) FRP for {{strengthening}} {{and rehabilitation}} of reinforced concrete structures {{has been the}} subject of various research projects in recent years. FRP strengthening systems are known to perform weak at elevated temperatures. This can be attributed to the relatively poor performance of both adhesive and FRP matrix polymers at temperatures in the range of their glass transition temperatures. Hence, there is a need for thermal protection of such elements. An investigation on the <b>fire</b> <b>endurance</b> of NSM FRP concrete beams under standard fire conditions was undertaken. Six reinforced concrete beam were strengthened in flexure with NSM bars and insulated with different insulation system. Temperatures and deflections were measured during fire testing.

30|$|The role of connections, diaphragms, and {{multiple}} load paths in maintaining overall structural integrity during fire is ignored in structural fire design.

40|$|To {{encourage}} {{new developments}} in building technology, a solid basis for building code requirements is needed. <b>Fire</b> <b>endurance</b> is a code requirement, yet no objective procedure exists for computing a structure’s chances of failing (degree of risk) in a fire. However, a model for predicting the <b>fire</b> <b>endurance</b> of part of a structure, a conventional unprotected wood joist floor, is available. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the <b>fire</b> <b>endurance</b> performance of an unprotected wood joist floor for use in the model. Eleven ASTM Standard E 119 floor tests were conducted. All the floors were 2 by 10 Douglas-fir wood joists, sixteen inches on center with 2 3 / 32 -inch-thick plywood as the floor sheathing. In addition to one trial test, five tests were conducted using a live load of 11. 35 lb/ft 2. For the other five tests, the live load was 79. 2 lb/ft 2. Twenty joists were tested for modulus of elasticity and modulus of rupture. The joist population had a mean modulus of rupture of 5, 280 lb/in. 2 and a mean modulus of elasticity of 1, 530, 000 lb/in. 2. For the five floors loaded to 11. 35 lb/ft 2, the mean time for initial joist failure was 17. 9 min with a coefficient of variation (COV) of 3. 7 %. For the five floors loaded to 79. 2 lb/ft 2, the mean time was 6. 5 min with a COV of 11. 6 %. Based on linear interpolation of these results, first joist failure would have occurred in 13. 1 min if a 40 lb/ft 2 live load had been used, which is the typical live loading specified in the building codes for residential one- and two-family dwellings. As a result of this study, fire-resistance performance of a wood floor is known for a specific population of wood joists with known structural properties. These results can be used to verify and revise the model for predicting <b>fire</b> <b>endurance...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{worldwide}} {{movement toward}} performance-based building codes is prompting {{the need for}} new computational methods to predict <b>fire</b> <b>endurance</b> of wood assemblies. Progress in the past twenty years in understanding <b>fire</b> <b>endurance</b> of individual solid wood components has been achieved in many different countries. The greatest opportunity for major advance in fire research is the development of computational <b>fire</b> <b>endurance</b> models that incorporate heat transfer, thermal degrade, and structural analysis algorithms for not only single components but multiple-component assemblies subject to standardized and natural fire scenarios. Full-scale test programs will also be needed to verify computational techniques and further deve!op thermal degradation theories. Why Fire Research is Needed Fire is a special design consideration addressed to minimize the risk of failure modes including structural collapse. Fire is not a loading condition in the traditional structural sense of applied forces, but instead an environmental condition that can have a dramatic impact on load carrying capacity and structure safety. The primary objective of fire resistant structural design is to maintain structural integrity during a fire for a sufficient period so that occupants may safely evacuate, fire fighters may safely extinguish the fire and to minimize property loss. This design process includes confining any potential fire with strategically-placed barriers and fire stops. Research on fire resistant design and construction in the United States appears to have diminished in recent years, although internationally it continues to be actively researched. In the U. S. fire resistant design receives much less research attention than similar efforts related to earthquake resistant design or the response of structures to wind events such as hurricanes.

However, elevated heating (800 – 1300 °C) was further applied for the purpose of monitoring behavior at the verge of disintegration. Specimens were allowed to cool in the oven prior to compressive strength tests until room temperature is attained. Test results indicate that significant mechanical capabilities could be achieved by the inclusion of an appropriate quantity of latex concentrate and proper selection of befitting curing regime. Interestingly, the superiority of NRLMC over NC is maintained even under fire, up to the critical limit of latex-film capability performance...|$|E

40|$|Advances in {{materials}} technology {{have resulted in}} newer products {{for the construction of}} stoppings used in USA underground coal mines. Some of the newer materials were developed for the construction industry and were consequently introduced into the mining industry [...] Ventilation control devices such as stoppings, overcasts and undercasts have traditionally been constructed of concrete block or metal panels. Efforts to reduce material and labor costs in the construction of stoppings and other ventilation controls have led to the introduction and use of “nontraditional ” materials. The “nontraditional ” or newer materials may consist of lightweight blocks composed of various cement-type compounds or panels composed of gypsum or other mineral-type compounds, and plastic membrane and steel fabricated designs.

The full-scale floor assembly consisted of CLT panels encapsulated with fiberglass wool and a single layer of 15. 9 mm thick Type X gypsum board on the exposed side and with two layers of 12. 7 mm thick cement board on the unexposed side. The full-scale wall assembly was constructed from CLT panels encapsulated with two layers of 15. 9 mm thick Type X gypsum board on both faces. Nine thermocouples were installed on the unexposed face of both assemblies to monitor the temperature rise throughout the test and nine deflection gauges were installed on each assembly to monitor deformations. The superimposed load applied on the floor assembly was 9. 4 kN/m 2 and the load imposed on the wall assembly was 449 kN/m.

40|$|Intuitively, the <b>fire</b> <b>endurance</b> of {{concrete}} members reinforced with fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) bars {{is related to}} the decrease in the mechanical properties of the materials concerned, especially resin. Large-scale fire tests recently performed on nine concrete slabs reinforced with glass FRP bars demonstrated the importance of bond between FRP and concrete for performance under fire situations. The experimental results showed that (1) the length of the FRP bars in the zone of slabs not directly exposed to fire (namely, anchoring length in fire situations) can be much more relevant to <b>fire</b> <b>endurance</b> than the concrete cover in the zone directly exposed to fire; and (2) the shape of the bar, for instance bent at the end, allows a reduction in anchoring length. From a design point of view, evaluating the necessary anchoring length through a bond model seems to be a key aspect. Full-scale test results, extensively presented elsewhere, are used in this paper to investigate the bond behavior of FRP bars embedded in concrete at high temperature and to assess a procedure to predict bond stress, slip, and load transfer at elevated temperature, based on both the results of numerical thermal analysis and the predictions of a bond theoretical model adjusted for fire situations. The design procedure outlined for calculating the minimal required anchoring length proves a valuable approach for the practicing engineer and stands together with the experimental and numerical results presented earlier. Finally, design nomograms are shown as examples of application of the procedure...|$|E
