40|$|This paper {{recommends}} a rapid classification methodology for Sustainable Flood <b>Retention</b> <b>Basins</b> to control runoff in a temperate climate. Particular emphasis is given towards vegetated <b>retention</b> <b>basins</b> in Baden (Germany). The most important groups of variables were of engineering, environmental {{and land use}} nature. The classification methodology {{can be used by}} urban and landscape planners to determine the type of Sustainable Flood <b>Retention</b> <b>Basin</b> based on a total sum of weights obtained for 34 qualitative or quantitative variables. The following six types of Sustainable Flood <b>Retention</b> <b>Basins</b> (SFRB's) were defined: Hydraulic Flood <b>Retention</b> <b>Basin,</b> Traditional Sustainable Flood <b>Retention</b> <b>Basin,</b> Sustainable Flood <b>Retention</b> Wetland, Aesthetic Flood Retention Wetland, Integrated Flood Retention Wetland and Natural Flood Retention Wetland. The methodology was developed with a general database (approximately 460 basins) and a very detailed database (24 basins). Most of the thoroughly researched SFRB of the latter database are Traditional Sustainable Flood <b>Retention</b> <b>Basins.</b> The most important variables for Baden were Elevation, Dam Existance, Flotsam, Forest, Dam Length and Vegetation. These variables were applied to determine the type of Sustainable Flood <b>Retention</b> <b>Basin</b> (predominantly used for hydraulic purposes) with an error of < 8 % in comparison to the application of all 34 variables...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The <b>retention</b> <b>basin</b> is a {{hydraulic}} structure for flood mitigation by storing river flow over a design flood. In this study, numerical models were adopted {{to simulate the}} flood mitigation effects by a <b>retention</b> <b>basin.</b> The large flood condition was applied as a boundary condition to consider an abnormal flood caused by climate change. Furthermore, the two-dimensional numerical model was adopted to regenerate the complex flow pattern due to the topography and lateral flow near the <b>retention</b> <b>basin.</b> The numerical results of the one- and two-dimensional model were analyzed and compared. The {{results showed that the}} two-dimensional model is more applicable to assessing flood mitigation by the <b>retention</b> <b>basin</b> with a complex topography and lateral flow patterns...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The <b>retention</b> <b>basin</b> is a river-facility for {{the flood}} {{mitigation}} by storing the river flow temporarily. The new 3 <b>retention</b> <b>basins</b> are installed {{in these regions}} YeoJu, NaJu, YoungWol by the Large River Management Project. In this study, 1 D and 2 D numerical flow simulation are conducted to evaluate the reduction effect of the peak flood stage for the YeoJu <b>retention</b> <b>basin.</b> HEC-RAS and FLDWAV models are used for 1 D simulation with the option of <b>retention</b> <b>basin.</b> CCHE 2 D model is used for 2 D simulation with the same hydrograph used in 1 D simulation. It is verified that the peak flood stage is reduced very largely about 0. 13 m near the overtopping section of the levee in 1 D simulation. It is verified that the peak flood stage is reduced very largely about 0. 20 m at the upstream-end of the simulated reach in 2 D simulation. 2 D simulation for the <b>retention</b> <b>basin</b> is more reasonable because physical characteristics of topography in the model, and also more advantageous {{for the evaluation of}} the flow characteristics of the in- and outside of the <b>retention</b> <b>basin</b> o...|$|R
40|$|In the 1950 s, the Savannah River Site {{built an}} open, unlined <b>retention</b> <b>basin</b> to {{temporarily}} store potentially radionuclide contaminated cooling {{water from a}} chemical separations process and storm water drainage from a nearby waste management facility that stored large quantities of nuclear fission byproducts in carbon steel tanks. The <b>retention</b> <b>basin</b> was retired from service in 1972 when a new, lined basin was completed. In 1978, the old <b>retention</b> <b>basin</b> was excavated, backfilled with uncontaminated dirt, and covered with grass. At the same time, much of the underground process pipeline leading to the basin was abandoned. Since {{the closure of the}} <b>retention</b> <b>basin,</b> new environmental regulations require that the basin undergo further assessment to determine whether additional remediation is required. A visual and radiological inspection of the pipeline was necessary to aid in the remediation decision making process for the <b>retention</b> <b>basin</b> system. A teleoperated pipe crawler inspection system was developed to survey the abandoned sections of underground pipelines leading to the retired <b>retention</b> <b>basin.</b> This paper will describe the background to this project, the scope of the investigation, the equipment requirements, and the results of the pipeline inspection...|$|R

40|$|Climate change {{results in}} higher water levels and {{therefore}} more frequent flooding and longer inundation of the floodplains of the river Rhine. <b>Retention</b> <b>basins</b> are installed in Germany and anticipated in the Netherlands to reduce peak flows and to prevent loss of property. In Germany, many of the <b>retention</b> <b>basins</b> are covered with forests that have experienced few floodings {{and that may be}} severely damaged by an extensive flood. In the Netherlands, the allocation of <b>retention</b> <b>basins</b> provides opportunities for new forest development. In both cases, knowledge is required on the effects of flooding on germination, establishment and survival of woody species to support the selection of <b>retention</b> <b>basins.</b> We analyzed the effects of flooding regimes on germination, establishment and survival of both saplings and adult trees, using analyzing available data; by collecting observational data; by performing field experiments; and by integrating this knowledge in a simulation model. We found clear differences between species in their response to flooding characteristics. The model is available for future studies on selection of <b>retention</b> <b>basin...</b>|$|R

40|$|Objectives: Determine toxic {{chemical}} compounds present {{that would be}} detri mental to marine and aquatic life. Procedure: Collect water samples from waste water outfall and run chemical analysis according to procedures in Standard Methods for the Examination of Sewage and Industrial Waste. Findings: Sinclair Refinery {{is located on the}} Houston Ship Channel approxi mately 2 § miles above Washburn Tunnel in Pasadena, Texas. Sinclair employs 2, 000 personnel and processes over 150, 000 barrels of crude per day. Five thousand gallons per minute of waste waters from the refinery enters the Houston Ship Channel after being run through old, outdated oil skimmers. However, since our visit on June 29, 1959, a large U-shaped concrete <b>retention</b> <b>basin</b> was completed and is now in operation. The <b>retention</b> <b>basin</b> has a reten tion time of approximately 20 hours. At each end of the U-shaped basin there are oil skimmers to remove any floating oils.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{recommend}} a rapid conceptual classification model for Sustainable Flood <b>Retention</b> <b>Basins</b> (SFRB) used to control runoff in a temperate climate. An SFRB is an aesthetically pleasing <b>retention</b> <b>basin</b> predominantly used for flood protection adhering to sustainable drainage and best management practices. The classification model was developed on the basis of a database of 141 SFRB using the River Rhine catchment in Baden (part of Baden-Wu¨rttemberg, Germany) as a case study. It is based on an agglomerative cluster analysis and is intended to be used by engineers and scientists to adequately classify the following different types of SFRB: Hydraulic Flood <b>Retention</b> <b>Basin,</b> Traditional Flood <b>Retention</b> <b>Basin,</b> Sustainable Flood <b>Retention</b> Wetland, Aesthetic Flood Retention Wetland, Integrated Flood Retention Wetland and Natural Flood Retention Wetland. The selection of classification variables was supported by a principal component analysis. The identification of SFRB in the data set was based on a Ward cluster analysis of 34 weighted classification variables. Scoring tables were defined to enable the assignment of the six SFRB definitions to <b>retention</b> <b>basins</b> in the data set. The efficiency of these tables was based on a scoring system which gave the conceptual model for the example case study sites an overall efficiency of approximately 60...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{describe}} a conceptual classification model for Sustainable Flood <b>Retention</b> <b>Basins</b> (SFRB) used to control runoff in temperate climates. The author has defined a SFRB as an aesthetically pleasing (from the general publics' point of view) <b>retention</b> <b>basin,</b> predominantly used for flood protection and adhering to sustainable drainage and best management practices. The classification model concept was developed on the basis of an example database of 147 SFRB in Baden-Württemberg (Germany). The data were of high quality because the researchers had detailed local knowledge of the case study area. The model quality was improved on the basis of a more detailed case study of The Kaiserstuhl, a region (no clearly defined boundaries) with a very high density of flood <b>retention</b> <b>basins</b> (one SFRB per 2 km 2; 51 sites in total). The model is based on an agglomerative cluster analysis and is intended to be used by landscape planners, environmental engineers, and environmental scientists to adequately classify the following different types of SFRB with the purpose of improving communication among stakeholders: Hydraulic Flood <b>Retention</b> <b>Basin,</b> Traditional Flood <b>Retention</b> <b>Basin,</b> Sustainable Flood <b>Retention</b> Wetland, Aesthetic Flood Retention Wetland, Integrated Flood Retention Wetland, and Natural Flood Retention Wetland. Despite the limited regional variation in flood <b>retention</b> <b>basin</b> characteristics within The Kaiserstuhl, the classification model example had an accuracy of 60 percent. A scoring template for the classification of future SFRB was devised on the basis of researcher experience, and this was optimized with a genetic algorithm...|$|R

40|$|A <b>retention</b> <b>basin</b> is a {{stormwater}} facility {{which includes}} a permanent impoundment, or pool of water, and, therefore, is normally wet, even during non-rainfall periods. Inflows from stormwater runoff may be temporarily stored above this permanent pool. Purpose A <b>retention</b> <b>basin</b> provides for long-term water quality enhancement of stormwater runoff. Stormwater inflows may also be temporarily stored above the permanent pool for downstream flood control and channel erosion control. A <b>retention</b> <b>basin</b> {{is considered one of}} the most reliable and versatile BMPs available. Water Quality Enhancement High removal rates of particulate and soluble pollutants (nutrients) can be achieved in <b>retention</b> <b>basins</b> through gravitational settling, biological uptake and decomposition. When an even higher degree of pollutant removal efficiency is required, the basin can be enhanced by using various modifications relating to the size and design of the permanent pool. Monitoring studies have shown sediment removal efficiencies to range from 50 - 90 %, total phosphorus removal efficiencies to range from 30 - 90 % and soluble nutrient removal efficiencies t...|$|R
40|$|The Ems estuary {{suffers from}} high {{concentrations}} of suspended sediment, which is harmful for the life in the river. Sediment import occurs because of tidal asymmetry, {{a difference between the}} velocity of the current during high tide and low tide. The use of <b>retention</b> <b>basins</b> are a possible measure to reduce the tidal asymmetry. An analytic model, using partial differential equations derived from the Shallow Water equations and Navier-Stokes equations, was used to investigate the influence of <b>retention</b> <b>basins</b> on the tidal dynamics and sediment transport in estuaries in general and the Ems estuary specifically. For these investigations, this analytic model is useful because system conditions can easily be changed. Results show that the locations of <b>retention</b> <b>basins</b> are of great importance for their performance. In the Ems estuary the location minimizing the sediment import {{is at the end of}} the estuary, near the weir. Enlarging the <b>retention</b> <b>basin</b> is better than placing a second basin at a different location in the estuary.

40|$|Urbanization-induced {{changes in}} landcover and {{hydrology}} affect erosion, transportation, and sediment storage. Understanding urban sediment production and composition {{in a desert}} region {{can be achieved by}} studying sediments in <b>retention</b> <b>basins</b> and mapping the landcover of their watersheds. How water and sediment flow through the urban system has consequences for flood control and riparian biota, both within the urbanized area and downstream. <b>Retention</b> <b>basins</b> reduce stormwater volumes reaching channels and trap urban sediments. Through analysis of aerial photography and City of Tempe stormwater GIS data, we selected and mapped two internally-drained neighborhood <b>retention</b> <b>basins</b> and collected sediment stored in the <b>retention</b> <b>basin</b> structures to calculate yearly-scale sediment production rates. Sediment for each basin was sorted by size. The pebble size fractions were separated into organic material, rocks, and trash. Sediment production analyses indicated that ~ 0. 002 - 0. 400 ft 3 /yr per acre were produced from these neighborhood landscapes. These production rates imply a geologically-scaled erosion rate of 0. 01 - 3 m/My for the urbanized desert...|$|R
