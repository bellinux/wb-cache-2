For the light-hole excitons in the quantum well region, shifts of the energy positions are observed following fabrication of the discs, confirming that strain relaxation occurs in the pillars.

A further consequence of the small lateral sizes of the discs is that the intensity of the donor-bound exciton emission from the disc is found to decrease with the disc radius. These size-related effects occur before the disc radius is reduced to dimensions necessary for lateral quantum confinement to occur but will remain important when the discs are made small enough to be considered as quantum dots.

50|$|LIMP2 has {{recently}} {{been identified as a}} novel component of intercalated discs in cardiac muscle. Intercalated discs are composed of gap junctions, adherens junctions and desmosomes, and are critical for the mechanical and electrical coupling of adjacent cardiomyocytes. The discovery of LIMP-2 as a component of this complex came about from a genetic screen of a homozygous, hypertensive transgenic rat model of renin overexpression, in which a population of these rats rapidly develop heart failure and another remains compensated. Out of 143 differentially-regulated genes, LIMP-2 was identified to be significantly upregulated in heart failure-prone rat cardiac muscle biopsies, which also proved true in human heart failure. Further analysis employing a LIMP-2 knockout mouse demonstrated that animals lacking LIMP-2 failed to flight a normal hypertrophic response following Angiotensin II treatment, however they developed interstitial fibrosis and dilated cardiomyopathy coordinate with disrupted intercalated <b>disc</b> <b>structure.</b> Biochemical and immunohistochemical analyses discovered that LIMP-2 interacts with N-cadherin at intercalated discs, a function outside of lysosomal membranes. Knockdown of LIMP-2 with RNA interference decreased the binding of N-cadherin to the phosphorylated form of beta-catenin, and LIMP-2 overexpression had the reverse effect.|$|E

40|$|The {{growth of}} dust {{particles}} into planet embryos needs {{to circumvent the}} radial-drift barrier, i. e. the accretion of dust particles onto the central star by radial migration. The outcome of the dust radial migration is governed by simple criteria between the dust-to-gas ratio and the exponents p and q of the surface density and temperature power laws. The transfer of radiation provides an additional constraint between these quantities because the <b>disc</b> thermal <b>structure</b> is fixed by the dust spatial distribution. To assess which discs are primarily affected by the radial-drift barrier, we used the radiative transfer code MCFOST to compute the temperature structure {{of a wide range}} of disc models, stressing the particular effects of grain size distributions and vertical settling.

Because the degree of variability in the King et al.

When the stochastic magnetic dynamo model of King et al. (2004) is added to these models, we find similar variability behaviour to before. We are now better placed to put physical constraints on model parameters. In particular, we find that in order to be consistent with the low degree of variability seen in the thermal disc component of black hole binaries, we need to limit the energy density of the poloidal field that can be produced by local dynamo cells in the disc to less than a few percent of the energy density of the dynamo field within the disc itself.
