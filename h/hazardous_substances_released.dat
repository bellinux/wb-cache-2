5000|$|While Russia {{possesses}} vast mineral {{and energy}} wealth, {{this does not}} come without some price both to Russia and to the greater globe. Particularly, oil and gas extraction exacts a heavy cost {{to the health of}} the land and people. Drilling waste water, mud, and sludges are accumulated, annual volumes have been estimated at 1.7 million tons of chemical reagents contaminating 25 million cubic meters of topsoil. Considerable geomechanical disturbances, contamination of soils and water, and multiple increases of contaminated waste water ejected into surface water streams, is a serious problem offsetting Russia's profits from the industry. It has been estimated that between 1991-1999 the volume of contaminated waste waters from the Russian oil industry amounted to 200 million cubic meters. Complete utilization of co-extracted gas in oil extraction does not exceed 80% in Russia, it has been variously estimated that annually 5-17 billion cubic meters of un-utilized gas extracted alongside oil is burnt in [...] "gas torches," [...] with 400,000 tons or more <b>hazardous</b> <b>substances</b> <b>released</b> into the atmosphere from this each year, creating the double impact of wasted resource and negative environmental effect. 560 million tons of methane is estimated to leak annually into the atmosphere from oil and gas extraction, not counting accidental outbursts and pipe breakage. Other valuable industries also have their costs, such as the coal industry's release of vast quantities of hazardous, toxic, and radioactive materials. Also the Russian gold industry, with Russia being the only nation for at least a century with high extraction of gold from placer deposits, and having 4000+ large deposits, inevitably creates problems for the river systems. The associated pollution from using mass explosions in mining also can be a problem. Overall, the extensive mineral wealth and riches, brings with it both great benefit to the Russian economy & people, and the greater globe and all people, yet also several difficult problems to be dealt with.|$|E

40|$|Frequently {{environmental}} pollution results from different <b>hazardous</b> <b>substances</b> <b>released</b> in the environment, meaning that contaminated sites may have many different chemical sources and transport pathways. Problems concerning {{environmental pollution}} affect mainly physical, {{chemical and biological}} properties of air, water and soil. The relationships between the sources, exposure and effects of contaminants to human and ecological receptors are complex and many times are specific to a particular site, to certain environmental conditions and to a particular receptor.

These questions are used {{to meet the needs}} of assessment, particular important in focusing the assessment during the problem formulation. Risk assessments vary widely in scope and application.

The HSEES system is a computerized database used to monitor the acute public health consequences of emergency <b>hazardous</b> <b>substances</b> <b>releases</b> into the environment.

HSEES is used to describe the morbidity and mortality experienced by employees, responders, and the general public that result from <b>hazardous</b> <b>substances</b> emergency events. The system documents all reportable <b>hazardous</b> <b>substances</b> <b>releases</b> in the state except for those involving only petroleum products (for example, natural gas, propane, jet fuel, and gasoline). HSEES events can occur at fixed facilities or during transportation. There are four objectives of the <b>Hazardous</b> <b>Substances</b> Emergency Events Surveillance system. These are:!

To describe the morbidity and mortality experienced by employees, responders, and thegeneral public that result from hazardous emergency releases. !
