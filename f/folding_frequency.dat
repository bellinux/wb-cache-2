40|$|Three {{dimensional}} simulations on the viscous folding in diverging microchannels {{reported by}} Cubaud and Mason are performed using the parallel code BLUE for multi-phase flows. The more viscous liquid L_ 1 is {{injected into the}} channel from the center inlet, and the less viscous liquid L_ 2 from two side inlets. Liquid L_ 1 {{takes the form of}} a thin filament due to hydrodynamic focusing in the long channel that leads to the diverging region. The thread then becomes unstable to a folding instability, due to the longitudinal compressive stress applied to it by the diverging flow of liquid L_ 2. Given the long computation time, we were limited to a parameter study comprising five simulations in which the flow rate ratio, the viscosity ratio, the Reynolds number, and the shape of the channel were varied relative to a reference model. In our simulations, the cross section of the thread produced by focusing is elliptical rather than circular. The initial folding axis can be either parallel or perpendicular to the narrow dimension of the chamber. In the former case, the folding slowly transforms via twisting to perpendicular folding, or it may remain parallel. The direction of folding onset is determined by the velocity profile and the elliptical shape of the thread cross section in the channel that feeds the diverging part of the cell. Due to the high viscosity contrast and very low Reynolds numbers, direct numerical simulations of this two-phase flow are very challenging and to our knowledge these are the first three-dimensional direct parallel numerical simulations of viscous threads in microchannels. Our simulations provide good qualitative comparison of the early time onset of the folding instability however since the computational time for these simulations is quite long, for such viscous threads, long-time comparisons with experiments for quantities such as <b>folding</b> <b>frequency</b> are limited.

The study was conducted on a flat plate in parallel flow and zero external pressure gradient for the free stream.

40|$|A {{climatology}} of tropopause folds occurring {{over the}} Eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East (EMME) {{has been established}} using the ERA-Interim reanalyses for the years 1979 - 2012. The methodology employs an algorithm that detects folds at grid points where the vertical profile features multiple crossings of the dynamical tropopause and allows their classification according to their vertical extent. Our results confirm the findings of an earlier 1 year climatology that recognized a global "hot spot" of summertime fold activity between the eastern Mediterranean and central Asia, {{in the vicinity of}} the subtropical jet. Two distinct maxima of activity are identified over Turkey and Iran-Afghanistan where <b>fold</b> <b>frequency</b> exceeds 25 %. Occasionally, medium and deep folds form over the two regions at surprisingly low latitudes. This summertime peak in fold activity diverges from the zonal mean seasonal cycle over the subtropics and is driven by the South Asian Monsoon. Starting in late spring, the EMME is gradually brought under the influence of the zonally asymmetric background state induced by the monsoon. As areas of sharply sloping isentropes develop especially over the eastern Mediterranean and Iran-Afghanistan, subsidence and fold formation are favored. Further investigation of the reanalysis data provided empirical evidence that the monsoon also drives the interannual variability of EMME fold activity. An upward trend in fold activity is identified, especially in May, attributed to the recent advanced monsoon onset and the deepening convective activity throughout summer, which promotes upper-level baroclinicity over the EMME and favors folding...|$|R

In {{this study we}} combine both approaches to complement their specific strengths and weaknesses, resulting in a method with higher statistical power and fewer false positive signals. We applied our approach to dairy cattle as they underwent extremely successful selection for milk production traits and since an excellent phenotypic record is available. We performed whole genome association tests with a new mixed model approach to account for stratification, which we validated via Monte Carlo simulations. Selection signatures were inferred with the integrated haplotype score and a locus specific permutation based integrated haplotype score that works with a <b>folded</b> <b>frequency</b> spectrum and provides a formal test of signifance to identify selection signatures. Results About 1, 600 out of 34, 851 SNPs showed signatures of selection and the locus specific permutation based integrated haplotype score showed overall good accordance with the whole genome association study. Each approach provides distinct information about the genomic regions that influence complex traits. Combining whole genome association with hitchhiking mapping yielded two significant loci for the trait protein yield. These regions agree well with previous results from other selection signature scans and whole genome association studies in cattle. Conclusion We show {{that the combination of}} whole genome association and selection signature mapping based on the same SNPs increases the power to detect loci influencing complex traits. The locus specific permutation based integrated haplotype score provides a formal test of significance in selection signature mapping.

The traditional method for treatment of patients with facial palsy is the two-stage free gracilis flap which has a long latency period of between the two stages of surgery. Methods: In this paper, we prospectively compared the results of the one-stage gracilis flap method with the two -stage technique. Results:Out of 41 patients with facial palsy refered to Hazrat-e-Fatemeh Hospital 31 were selected from whom 22 underwent two- stage and 9 one-stage method treatment. The two groups were identical according to age,sex,intensity of illness, duration, and chronicity of illness. Mean duration of follow up was 37 months. There was no significant relation between the two groups regarding the symmetry of face in repose, smiling, whistling and nasolabial <b>folds.</b> <b>Frequency</b> of complications was equal in both groups. The postoperative surgeons and patients' satisfaction were equal in both groups. There was no significant difference between the mean excursion of muscle flap in one-stage (9. 8 mm) and two-stage groups (8. 9 mm). The ratio of contraction of the affected side compared to the normal side was similar in both groups. The mean time of the initial contraction of the muscle flap in the one-stage group (5. 5 months) had a significant difference (P= 0. 001) with the two-stage one (6. 5 months).

In order to get a molecular understanding of the experimental results we developed an Ising-like model for proteins that incorporates the osmophobic nature of their backbone. The model benefits from analytical thermodynamics and kinetics amenable to Monte-Carlo simulation. The prevailing view used to be that small protecting osmolytes bridge the separating beta-strands of proteins with mechanical resistance, presumably shifting the transition state to significantly higher distances that correlate with the molecular size of the osmolyte molecules. Our experiments showed instead that protecting osmolytes slow down protein unfolding and speed-up protein folding at physiological pH without shifting the protein transition state on the mechanical reaction coordinate. Together with the theoretical results of the Ising-model, our results lend support to the osmophobic theory according to which osmolyte stabilisation {{is a result of the}} preferential exclusion of the osmolyte molecules from the protein backbone. The results obtained during this thesis work have markedly improved our understanding of the strategy selected by Nature to strengthen protein stability in hostile environments, shifting the focus from hypothetical protein-osmolyte interactions to the more general mechanism based on the osmophobicity of the protein backbone. ...|$|R

This thesis is aimed at designing a dependable finite element analysis (FEA) model of the vocal <b>folds</b> for <b>frequency</b> and dynamic analysis and for calculating the impact stress between the vocal folds during glottal closure. A three-dimensional model with irregular geometry and a layered structure was designed. The measured viscoelastic properties of the vocal-fold mucosa and the transverse isotropic elastic properties of the vocal fold muscle are applied to the model. The boundary conditions are assumed to be fixed on lateral, anterior and posterior surfaces based on anatomical structure analysis. This model is symmetrical about the right and left vocal <b>folds.</b> The <b>frequency</b> and dynamic characters are presented using the software ABAQUS. The FEA model is validated by both experimental modal analysis (EMA) model results and in-vivo experimental results from the literature.
