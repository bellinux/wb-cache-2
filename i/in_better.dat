Canakinumab may result <b>in</b> <b>better</b> outcomes than a low dose of a steroid but costs five thousand times more. A recombinant uricase enzyme (rasburicase) is available; its use, however, is limited, as it triggers an immune response. Less antigenic versions are in development.|$|E

Shetlands retain many of their primitive survival instincts, so they are easier to care for than many modern breeds.|$|E

5|$|A 2012 {{study on}} the effects of {{rainfall}} patterns and parasite infections on the body of the springbok in Etosha National Park observed that males and juveniles were <b>in</b> <b>better</b> health {{toward the end of the}} rainy season. Health of females was more affected by parasites than by rainfall; parasite count in females peaked prior to and immediately after parturition. Studies show that springbok host helminths (Haemonchus, Longistrongylus and Trichostrongylus), ixodid ticks (Rhipicephalus species), lice (Damalinia and Linognathus species). Eimeria species mainly affect juveniles.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1973, several {{spacecraft}} {{have performed}} planetary flyby maneuvers {{that brought them}} within observation range of Jupiter. The Pioneer missions obtained the first close-up images of Jupiter's atmosphere and several of its moons.

The trajectories of these spacecraft were used to refine the mass estimates of the Jovian system.

5|$|Grand Theft Auto clones offer {{players the}} ability to steal and drive a number of vehicles. Games have {{included}} all kinds of vehicles, such as cars, helicopters, boats, jet-skis, fixed-wing aircraft, and military vehicles.

Players can also use vehicles as weapons, either by driving into enemies, or by damaging the vehicle until it explodes. Some games allow vehicles to perform stunts. Games in the genre thus incorporate elements of driving simulation games. Some games even allow players to customize their vehicles.|$|E

On the whole hardwoods like mahogany, the material for most stateroom furnishings, is more resistant to decay. Lavatories and bathrooms within the passenger quarters survive because they were framed in steel.|$|E

5|$|Until the 1990s, {{there was}} little focus on {{expansion}} of the system because the system {{was in a state}} of disrepair, and funds were allocated to rebuilding and repairing the existing system. However, in the 1990s, with the system <b>in</b> <b>better</b> shape, the construction of the Second Avenue Subway was looked into again. Construction of the Second Avenue Subway started in 2007, and the first phase was completed in 2017. Since the 1990s, public officials and organizations such as the Regional Plan Association have pushed for the further expansion of the system. Projects such as the TriboroRx, a circumferential line connecting the outer boroughs, the reuse of the Rockaway Beach Branch, and the further expansion of the Second Avenue Subway have all been proposed, albeit unfunded.|$|E
5|$|By {{the start}} of 1943 Germany's armored forces had {{sustained}} heavy casualties. It was unusual for a Panzer Division to field more than 100 tanks, and most averaged only 70–80 serviceable tanks at any given time. After the fighting around Kharkov, Heinz Guderian embarked on a program to bring Germany's mechanized forces up to strength. Despite his efforts, a German panzer division could only count on an estimated 10,000–11,000 personnel, out of an authorized strength of 13,000–17,000. Only by June did a panzer division begin to field between 100–130 tanks each. SS divisions were normally <b>in</b> <b>better</b> shape, with an estimated 150 tanks, a battalion of self-propelled assault guns and enough half-tracks to motorize most of its infantry and reconnaissance soldiers—and these had an authorized strength of an estimated 19,000 personnel. At this time, the bulk of Germany's armor was still composed of Panzer IIIs and Panzer IVs, although the 2nd SS Panzer Division had been outfitted {{with a number of}} Tiger I tanks.|$|E

The last seconds of the round were evenly matched with both boxers finishing the round injured. Cotto was apparently <b>in</b> <b>better</b> condition when the third round began and was dominating the fight at that point. With two minutes remaining in the round one of Cotto's punches landed in Torres' beltline. Following this Torres was granted thirty seconds to recover by the referee. Cotto dominated the fourth round and Torres won the fifth. Cotto won and scored a knockdown in the sixth round. At 1:24 of the seventh round a left hook by Cotto knocked Torres out.|$|E

5|$|Despite this, and at Godley's urging, {{a further}} attack was planned for 12 October, this time using the New Zealand Division and the Australian 3rd Division. By now {{the ground was}} a sea of mud {{and a lack of}} {{preparation}} on the part of Godley's corps headquarters hampered the preliminary movements of the attacking divisions and supporting artillery. Godley's plans for the attack were overly ambitious and beyond the scale of previous operations that had been mounted earlier in the month <b>in</b> <b>better</b> weather and ground conditions and with more time to prepare. The operation on 12 October proved to be a failure with limited gains and heavy losses in the attacking divisions. After the battle, Godley downplayed the losses in the New Zealand Division (which amounted to around 2,900 casualties) and overstated the gains made in official correspondence to Allen, and a friend, Clive Wigram, who was the assistant private secretary to King George V.|$|E
5|$|During the day, the French {{strengthened}} {{the positions of}} both battered ships, soldiers from the surrounding area gathering on the beaches to deter any boat attacks on the grounded vessels. Among the soldiers were men taken from several of Muskein's landing barges that were sheltering in the Dives River. These troops were identified by Trial, which briefly closed with Confiante to determine her condition and was fired on by the remaining guns in operation on the frigate. With their evacuation covered from the shore, most of the crew were removed from Confiante, including all the wounded. The French eventually abandoned the wrecked corvette in the evening. Vésuve was <b>in</b> <b>better</b> condition and remained well protected. Her crew shored up their vessel at low tide to prevent her falling over and prepared to heave the ship off as the tide rose. Due to the strong French military presence, Laforey decided to delay any operation against the beached vessels until circumstances were more favourable.|$|E

They performed at the Free School for the following two weeks, before performing at the Psychodelphia Versus Ian Smith event at the Roundhouse in December, arranged by the Majority Rule for Rhodesia Campaign, and an Oxfam benefit at the Albert Hall (the band's biggest venue up to this point).|$|E
