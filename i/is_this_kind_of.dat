Comedy Central representatives told media outlets that the episode {{received}} overwhelmingly positive responses from viewers who {{identified themselves as}} gay. In 1998, Jonathan Van Meter of The New York Times Magazine called the episode [...] "one of their best shows", and praised the episode for mixing a moral message with the jokes, {{as well as a}} sentimental relationship between Stan and Sparky. Van Meter wrote, [...] "What often keeps the show from being offensive <b>is</b> <b>this</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> sweetness – and that it's funny". The same year, The Advertiser, a North Yorkshire-based publication, called the episode [...] "one of the all-time best". Also in the same year, Rick Marin of Newsweek described the episode as [...] "gleefully offensive and profoundly silly", but praised it as [...] "juxtaposing cute and crude, jaded and juvenile".|$|E

We have an obligation to prevent our territory from being used as a sanctuary for terrorism and proliferation and human trafficking and organized crime." [...] Anthony Cordesman, an analyst at the US Center for Strategic and International Studies, said about the raid that, [...] "When you are dealing with states that do not maintain their sovereignty and become a de facto sanctuary, the only way {{you have to deal with}} them <b>is</b> <b>this</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> operation." ...|$|E

60|$|If the {{mathematical}} theory is adequate, nothing {{happens when a}} body moves except {{that it is in}} different places at different times. But in this sense the hour-hand and the second-hand are equally in motion, yet in the second-hand there is something perceptible to our senses which is absent in the hour-hand. We can see, at each moment, that the second-hand is moving, which is different from seeing it first in one place and then in another. This seems to involve our seeing it simultaneously in a number of places, although it must also involve our seeing that it is in some of these places earlier than in others. If, for example, I move my hand quickly from left to right, you seem to see the whole movement at once, {{in spite of the fact}} that you know it begins at the left and ends at the right. It <b>is</b> <b>this</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> consideration, I think, which leads Bergson and many others to regard a movement as really one indivisible whole, not the series of separate states imagined by the mathematician.|$|E
60|$|And {{yet this}} study, immensely transcending all other in importance, is that which, {{in an age}} of boasted education, {{receives}} the least attention. While what we call civilisation could never have arisen {{had it not been for}} science, science forms scarcely an appreciable element in our so-called civilised training. Though to the progress of science we owe it, that millions find support where once there was food only for thousands; yet of these millions but a few thousands pay any respect to that which has made their existence possible. Though increasing knowledge of the properties and relations of things has not only enabled wandering tribes to grow into populous nations, but has given to the countless members of these populous nations, comforts and pleasures which their few naked ancestors never even conceived, or could have believed, yet <b>is</b> <b>this</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> knowledge only now receiving a grudging recognition in our highest educational institutions. To the slowly growing acquaintance with the uniform co-existences and sequences of phenomena--to the establishment of invariable laws, we owe our emancipation from the grossest superstitions. But for science we should be still worshipping fetishes; or, with hecatombs of victims, propitiating diabolical deities. And yet this science, which, in place of the most degrading conceptions of things, has given us some insight into the grandeurs of creation, is written against in our theologies and frowned upon from our pulpits.|$|E

That {{is a city}} to {{be proud}} of, indeed; and it <b>is</b> <b>this</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> {{architectural}} dignity which you should aim at, in what you add to Edinburgh or rebuild in it. For remember, you must either help your scenery or destroy it; whatever you do has an effect {{of one kind or}} the other; it is never indifferent. But, above all, remember that it is chiefly by private, not by public, effort that your city must be adorned. It does not matter how many beautiful public buildings you possess, if they are not supported by, and in harmony with, the private houses of the town. Neither the mind nor the eye will accept a new college, or a new hospital, or a new institution, for a city. It is the Canongate, and the Princes Street, and the High Street that are Edinburgh. It is in your own private houses that the real majesty of Edinburgh must consist; and, what is more, it must be by your own personal interest that the style of the architecture which rises around you must be principally guided. Do not think that you can have good architecture merely by paying for it. It is not by subscribing liberally for a large building once in forty years that you can call up architects and inspiration. It is only by active and sympathetic attention to the domestic and every-day work which is done for each of you, that you can educate either yourselves to the feeling, or your builders to the doing, of what is truly great.|$|E

60|$|A {{comparison}} of the collections proves that among all European lands the primitive 'versicles' {{of the people are}} identical in tone, form, and incident. It <b>is</b> <b>this</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> early expression of a people's life--careless, abrupt, brief, as was necessitated {{by the fact that they}} were sung to the accompaniment of the dance--that we call ballads. These are distinctly, and in every sense, popular poems, and nothing can cause greater confusion than to apply the same title, 'popular,' to early epic poetry. Ballads are short; a long ballad, as Mr. Matthew Arnold has said, creeps and halts. A true epic, on the other hand, is long, and its tone is grand, noble, and sustained. Ballads are not artistic; while the form of the epic, whether we take the hexameter or the rougher laisse of the French chansons de geste, is full of conscious and admirable art. Lastly, popular ballads deal with vague characters, acting and living in vague places; while the characters of an epic are heroes of definite station, whose descendants are still in the land, whose home is a recognisable place, Ithaca, or Argos. Now, though these two kinds of early poetry--the ballad, the song of the people; the epic, the song of the chiefs of the people, of the ruling race--are distinct in kind, it does not follow that they have no connection, that the nobler may not have been developed out of the materials of the lower form of expression. And the value of the 'Kalevala' is partly this, that it combines the continuity and unison of the epic with the simplicity and popularity of the ballad, and so forms a kind of link in the history of the development of poetry. This may become clearer as we proceed to explain the literary history of the Finnish national poem.|$|E
