5|$|Joseph W. Osborne {{may have}} made the first wine from Zinfandel in California. <b>He</b> <b>planted</b> Zinfandel from Macondray at his Oak Knoll {{vineyard}} just north of Napa, and his wine was much praised in 1857. Planting of Zinfandel boomed soon after, {{and by the end}} of the 19th century it was the most widespread variety in California.|$|E

His name is found on a rock in Lake Winnipesaukee, carved by surveyors sent to identify the Massachusetts colony's northern border in 1652. Places and institutions are named for him, and (like many early colonists) he has several notable descendants.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe Zn/Cd hyperaccumulating ecotype (HE) of Sedum alfredii Hance can {{accumulate}} 24 - and 28 -fold higher {{leaf and}} stem Zn concentrations {{when compared with}} the non-hyperaccumulating ecotype (NHE) of Sedum. Heterologous expression of a metal tolerance protein (MTP 1) encoding gene from <b>HE</b> <b>plants</b> (SaMTP 1) or the homologous gene from NHE plants (SnMTP 1) suppressed Zn 2 + hypersensitivity in the Δzrc 1 yeast mutant. In plants, SaMTP 1 localized to the tonoplast. Furthermore, MTP 1 transcript level in the shoot of <b>HE</b> <b>plants</b> was more than 80 -fold higher than that of NHE plants. The transcript level of SaMTP 1 in shoot was up-regulated 1 -fold by Zn 2 + while the expression of SnMTP 1 was slightly inhibited. These data suggest that SaMTP 1 can {{play an important role in}} Zn accumulation in <b>HE</b> <b>plants...</b>|$|R

Visiting Edinburgh on September 9, he toured Dreghorn Castle and the Royal Botanic Garden, where <b>he</b> <b>planted</b> two maple trees. Kalākaua appeared at Freemason Hall to loud cheers. The Grand Conclave of Scotland of the Order of the Red Cross of Constantine made him an honorary member.|$|E

5|$|The Croatian form Crljenak Kaštelanski was not bottled in Croatia as a varietal in its {{own right}} before the link to Zinfandel was revealed. UCD has since sent clones of both Zinfandel and Primitivo to Professor Maletić in Croatia, which <b>he</b> <b>planted</b> on the island of Hvar. He made his first ZPC wines in Croatia in 2005. There is high demand for red grapes in the country, and the {{government}} has been supportive of ongoing research. Figures from the department of viticulture and enology at the University of Zagreb claim that from only 22 vines of Crljenak Kaštelanski in Croatia in 2001, there were about 2,000 vines in 2008.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of the tulip to Europe is usually attributed to Ogier de Busbecq, the ambassador of FerdinandI, Holy Roman Emperor to the Sultan of Turkey, who sent the first tulip bulbs and seeds to Vienna in 1554 from the Ottoman Empire. Tulip bulbs were soon distributed from Vienna to Augsburg, Antwerp and Amsterdam. Its popularity and cultivation in the United Provinces (now the Netherlands) is generally thought to have started in earnest around 1593 after the Flemish botanist Carolus Clusius had taken up a post at the University of Leiden and established the hortus academicus. <b>He</b> <b>planted</b> his collection of tulip bulbs and found {{they were able to}} tolerate the harsher conditions of the Low Countries; shortly thereafter the tulip began to grow in popularity.|$|E
5|$|Fearing that Darvin may be {{attempting}} to assassinate Kirk, the crew dress in period uniforms and investigate the Enterprise. They attempt {{to interact with}} history {{as little as possible}} whilst investigating Darvin. The crew does not initially recognize the Klingons of the time period, and when Worf (Michael Dorn) is asked about the difference in appearance, he replies that the matter is not discussed with outsiders. Doctor Julian Bashir (Alexander Siddig) and Chief Miles O'Brien (Colm Meaney) get involved in a bar brawl between the Enterprise crew and a number of Klingons on shore leave. Captain Kirk disciplines them on the Enterprise alongside Chief Engineer Montgomery Scott (James Doohan) and Ensign Pavel Chekov (Walter Koenig). Bashir and O'Brien notice that the ship is covered with tribbles. Lieutenant Commander Worf (Michael Dorn) and Odo (René Auberjonois) detain Darvin and return him to the Defiant. There, Darvin admits that <b>he</b> <b>planted</b> a bomb in a tribble to kill Kirk.|$|E

5|$|Much of {{the estate}} had been managed as a coppiced woodland, giving Robinson the {{opportunity}} to plant drifts of scilla, cyclamen, and narcissus between the coppiced hazels and chestnuts. On the edges, and in the cleared spaces in the woods, Robinson established plantings of Japanese anemone, lily, acanthus, and pampas grass, along with shrubs such as fothergilla, stewartia, and nyssa. Closer to the house he had some flower beds; throughout <b>he</b> <b>planted</b> red valerian, which he allowed to spread naturally around paving and staircases. Robinson planted thousands of daffodils annually, including 100,000 narcissi planted along one of the lakes in 1897. Over the years he added hundreds of trees, some of them from American friends John Singer Sargent and Frederick Law Olmsted. Other features included an oval-shaped walled kitchen garden, a heather garden, and a water garden {{with one of the}} largest collections of water lilies in Europe.|$|E
5|$|In 1792 {{over the}} 25 {{days of the}} first {{landfall}} in Recherche Bay, Tasmania, Delahaye established a European vegetable garden. Its purpose was {{as a source of}} food and propagation material for the indigenous people, and also as a supply of provisions for future visiting European vessels. This was the first European garden on mainland Tasmania, planted just north of where the ships were anchored and, until recently, was last sighted by Lady Jane Franklin in the 1840s. Offshore, on Bruny Island, a small orchard had been planted a few months previously by Englishman William Bligh's expedition, presumably planted by Bligh's gardener David Nelson. Delahaye's journal reports that <b>he</b> <b>planted</b> celery, chervil, chicory, cabbages, grey romaine lettuce, different kinds of turnip, white onion, radishes, sorrel, peas, black salsify and potatoes; he also had large quantities sewn in the woods, thrown at random where they might grow. Returning on 21 January 1793 the garden had not been productive, the seed having been planted in dry and sandy soil. This time Delahaye tried explaining to the Aboriginal people, referred to today as the Lyluequonny, that the tubers, when cooked in fire embers, made fine eating. Calling in on the Adventure Bay side of Bruny Island Delahaye examined and tended the two pomegranate, one quince and three fig trees planted by Bligh’s expedition in 1792.|$|E
