40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{a study of}} the mechanisms for generating pressure increase within a ducted, supersonic hydrogen-air flame. The combustor consisted of a constant-area rectangular duct with a centrally located fuel injector strut that spanned the width of the duct. The <b>free</b> <b>stream</b> <b>flows,</b> with total enthalpies of 5. 6, 6. 5 and 8. 9 MJ/kg, were provided by a free-piston shock tunnel and the fuel was injected from a Ludwieg tube. The wall pressure increase generated within the duct was successfully estimated by first reducing the effective core area of the duct by the combined displacement thickness of the mixing layers and wall boundary layers and then calculating the properties of the inviscid core flow assuming an isentropic compression. It was found that heat addition decreased the density of the mixing layer and subsequently increased its displacement thickness without greatly altering the layer 2 ̆ 7 s velocity profile. If pressure gradients and shock waves have only a minor effect on turbulence production then the displacement thickness of the mixing and boundary layers on be assumed to be independent of the height of the duct. If the duct height is changed, the resulting pressure distribution within the new duct can be predicted using the displacement thickness distribution from the original duct. The paper thus presents a form of scaling for supersonic combustion experiments. (C) 1998 by The Combustion Institute...|$|R

40|$|The {{integration}} of UHBR (Ultra High Bypass Ratio) engines mounted under backward swept wings may lead {{at low speed}} to local flow separations on the wing suction side {{in the wake of}} the nacelle. These local flow separations can trigger the total wing stall which degrades the total aircraft performance. This paper presents a numerical study of AFC (active flow control) applied at the engine-wing junction of a generic full scale wind tunnel model to suppress the local flow separations. The AFC method is based on the principle of fluidic actuation and assembles a pulsed blowing with a 180 ° phase shift between the neighboring nozzles. Its working principle is the production of vortices that enhance the mixing of the boundary layer and the <b>free</b> <b>stream</b> <b>flow.</b> The <b>free</b> <b>stream</b> <b>flow</b> {{in the wake of the}} nacelle is compromised due to the wakes of local flow separations and longitudinal vortices such as the strake vortex. The computation results show that pulsed blowing is capable of suppressing the local separations. It is shown that a certain blowing velocity exists that is required for the suppression of the nacelle-wake separation. Additionally the influence of the pulse frequency was analyzed with a parameter study. It was shown that the local flow separations were suppressed by both low and high pulse frequencies...|$|E
