5|$|Michael Balcon, {{the head}} of Ealing Studios and the {{producer}} of Kind Hearts and Coronets, appointed Robert <b>Hamer</b> as director. <b>Hamer</b> {{was interested in the}} film, and thought it an interesting project with possibilities of using the English language in a unique way in the film. Filming took place from September 1948 at Leeds Castle and other locations in Kent, and at Ealing Studios. The themes of class and sexual repression run through the film, particularly love between classes.|$|E
5|$|O' Horten is a 2007 Norwegian {{language}} film {{directed by}} Bent <b>Hamer.</b> The film's title character Odd Horten is a habit-bound train driver, {{who is about}} to retire. On the day of his retirement he ends up in an unexpected situation, and is forced to reconsider his life. As in other films by <b>Hamer,</b> the themes are loneliness and old age, and the courage to take chances. O' Horten {{has been described as a}} film without a strong plot or a clear chronology.|$|E

5|$|Among {{the more}} {{original}} castings was Anette Sagen, the world's leading female ski jumper, {{in her first}} film role. Sagen, 22 at the time, played the part of 70-year-old Owe's ski jumping mother, although in a younger incarnation. <b>Hamer</b> had already considered Sagen for the role, when he ran into her by chance at the Holmenkollen Ski Museum. Without knowing to whom he was talking, <b>Hamer</b> mentioned that he was shooting a film in this location, and was planning to ask Anette Sagen to be in it. The reason the theme of ski jumping was chosen was that Hamer's own mother performed the sport, and the film {{has been described as}} a tribute to all female ski jumpers. Sagen herself had also earlier been involved in a controversy over women's access to professional venues and competitions. Incidentally, Sagen and Owe are also both from the Norwegian town of Mosjøen.|$|E
5|$|The jurist Richard Posner saw Tripp as {{reviving}} psychiatrist Richard von Krafft-Ebing's {{theory that}} masturbation helps to cause homosexuality by fixating a {{boy on the}} male genitals, based on evidence that homosexuals begin masturbating earlier than heterosexuals. Posner criticized the theory {{on the grounds that}} homosexuality and early masturbation could both be effects of whatever factor might be responsible for causing homosexuality. The geneticist Dean <b>Hamer</b> wrote that The Homosexual Matrix was influential and that Tripp provided the clearest articulation of the social learning theory of sexual orientation. However, <b>Hamer</b> found the theory itself implausible, and rejected it on numerous grounds, arguing that it is inconsistent with anthropological evidence and human evolutionary history, and fails to explain the existence of homosexuality.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} good {{critical}} reception, the film {{did not perform}} very well at the box office, with only about 35,000 tickets sold domestically. <b>Hamer</b> expressed some disappointment with this, while hoping that the DVD-release would fare better. Internationally, the film did somewhat better, and was sold to forty countries. By early August 2009, the film had in fact been seen by {{more people in the}} United States than in Norway.|$|E

5|$|After meeting Fannie Lou <b>Hamer</b> in {{the summer}} of 1964 and hearing her {{experiences}} in the civil rights movement, Blackwell decided to join the SNCC. As a project director for the SNCC, she organized voter registration drives across Mississippi. Later that year, she became a member on the executive committee of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP), which provided a party for voters that SNCC had been registering to vote. In late August she and 67 other activists left Mississippi to represent the MFDP at the 1964 Democratic National Convention in Atlantic City, New Jersey, in an attempt to get the MFDP seated as delegates. They were unsuccessful in getting seats, but the move brought the party and the Mississippi civil rights movement into the public eye.|$|E
5|$|James then flew to Algiers, {{where he}} was {{publicly}} paraded through the airport and driven to meet General Maitland Wilson, ostensibly for a meeting to discuss operations against the south of France. Instead, he was moved quietly to a remote villa by 'A' Force's Rex <b>Hamer.</b> Rumours suggest this was because James had been spotted smoking and staggering around Algiers, so the deceivers decided to cut his appearances short. Whatever the reason, the next day, out of character, James was flown to Cairo. He was to remain hidden there until the public disclosure of Montgomery's presence in France. Meanwhile, double agents in North Africa were used to extend the masquerade {{for a few more}} days, by hinting Montgomery was still in the region.|$|E

50|$|In Washington, D.C., President Johnson, {{fearful of}} the power of <b>Hamer's</b> {{testimony}} on live television, called an emergency press conference in an effort to divert press coverage. The television networks switched to the White House from their coverage of <b>Hamer's</b> address, believing that Johnson would announce his vice-presidential candidate for the forthcoming November election. Instead, to the bemusement of journalists, he arbitrarily announced the nine-month anniversary of the shooting of Texas governor, John Connally, during the assassination of John F. Kennedy. However, many television networks ran <b>Hamer's</b> speech unedited on their late news programs. The Credentials Committee received thousands of calls and letters in support of the Freedom Democrats.|$|R
