50|$|The Mahīśāsaka sect {{held that}} {{everything}} exists, {{but only in}} the present.

5|$|Warenne died in 1209 and {{was buried}} in St Mary Overy Priory (now Southward Cathedral) in Southwark, Surrey. Warenne also founded Wormegay Priory, Norfolk, a house of Augustinian monks.

5|$|Another embassy from Daqin is {{recorded}} as bringing tributary <b>gifts</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Chinese Jin Empire (265–420 AD). This occurred in 284 AD {{during the reign}} of Emperor Wu of Jin (r. 266–290 AD), and was recorded in the Book of Jin, as well as the later Wenxian Tongkao. This embassy was presumably sent by the Emperor Carus (r. 282–283 AD), whose brief reign was preoccupied by war with Sasanian Persia.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{difficulty}} and risk of meeting the Huaorani on the ground, the missionaries chose to drop <b>gifts</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Huaorani by fixed-wing aircraft. Their drop technique, developed by Nate Saint, involved flying around the drop location in tight circles while lowering the gift from the plane on a rope. This kept the bundle in roughly {{the same position as}} it approached the ground. On October 6, 1955, Saint made the first drop, releasing a small kettle containing buttons and rock salt. The gift-giving continued during the following weeks, with the missionaries dropping machetes, ribbons, clothing, pots, and various trinkets.|$|E

5|$|Donnchadh's most {{important}} long-term patronage {{was a series}} of <b>gifts</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Cluniac Abbey of Paisley that led to the foundation of a monastery at Crossraguel (Crois Riaghail). At some date before 1227 he granted Crossraguel and a place called Suthblan to Paisley, a grant confirmed by Pope Honorius III on 23 January 1227. A royal confirmation by King Alexander III of Scotland dated to 25 August 1236 shows that Donnchadh granted the monastery the churches of Kirkoswald (Turnberry), Straiton and Dalquharran (Old Dailly). He may also have given the churches of Girvan and Kirkcudbright-Innertig (Ballantrae).|$|E
5|$|Leofric {{replaced}} the monks with canons. The new community {{was given the}} Rule of Chrodegang by Leofric, which rule he had probably learned in Lotharingia before his return to England. Leofric moved {{the seat of his}} see because Crediton was too poor and rural, and Exeter was a city with protective walls and an abandoned church that could be used as the new cathedral. Leofric claimed that he found his diocese lacking in episcopal vestments and the other items required for church services, and his surviving list of <b>gifts</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> church noted that he gave vestments, crosses, chalices, censers, altar coverings, and other furnishings to the cathedral.|$|E
5|$|The first {{document}} to recognise {{the town was}} issued in 1075, when the King of Scots, Malcolm III (reigned 1058–93) granted the shire of Kirkcaladunt, among other <b>gifts,</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> church at Dunfermline. The residents were expected to pay dues and taxes for the church's general upkeep.

5|$|The myth's {{religious}} importance {{extended beyond}} the funerary sphere. Mortuary offerings, in which {{family members or}} hired priests presented food to the deceased, were logically linked with the mythological offering of the Eye of Horus to Osiris. By analogy, this episode of the myth was eventually equated with other interactions between a human and a being in the divine realm. In temple offering rituals, the officiating priest took {{on the role of}} Horus, the <b>gifts</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> deity became the Eye of Horus, and whichever deity received these gifts was momentarily equated with Osiris.|$|E
5|$|Wade is {{well known}} for his philanthropic {{involvement}} in various organizations. In 2003, he founded The Wade's World Foundation, which provides support to community-based organizations that promote education, health, and social skills for children in at-risk situations. He hosts a variety of community outreach programs in Chicago and South Florida. In 2008, he announced his partnership with former teammate Alonzo Mourning's charitable foundation and co-hosted ZO's Summer Groove, an annual summer event. On December 24, 2008, Wade purchased a new home for a South Florida woman whose nephew accidentally burned down the family home. In addition, Wade donated some furnishings, clothing, and <b>gifts</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> family for the holiday.|$|E
5|$|William left Normandy to Robert, and {{the custody}} of England was given to William's second {{surviving}} son, also called William, {{on the assumption that}} he would become king. The youngest son, Henry, received money. After entrusting England to his second son, the elder William sent the younger William back to England on 7 or 8 September, bearing a letter to Lanfranc ordering the archbishop to aid the new king. Other bequests included <b>gifts</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Church and money to be distributed to the poor. William also ordered that all of his prisoners be released, including his half-brother Odo.|$|E

5|$|Edward {{had managed}} this last {{category}} of personal treasure through an organisation called the Privy Wardrobe. The Keeper of the Privy Wardrobe {{was responsible for}} guarding and recording the king's belongings, and dispatching particular items around the kingdom, potentially giving them as <b>gifts</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> monarch's family and friends. The Privy Wardrobe was initially based in the Tower of London in Edward's reign and became focused on handling the supplies for his campaigns in France. This probably encouraged the King to decide {{to build a new}} tower in Westminster to host a separate branch of the Privy Wardrobe specifically to manage his personal jewels and plate. In practice, this branch also managed the clothes, vestments and similar goods belonging to the royal household– effectively, the non-military parts of the King's property.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, the IMA hosted The William S. Paley Collection, a {{traveling}} exhibition {{organized by the}} Museum of Modern Art that included Impressionist, Post-Impressionist, and modern pieces collected by the late CBS news chairman William S. Paley. The exhibit helped establish the IMA as a prominent museum venue in the Midwest and brought in a record-setting 60,837 visitors. In 2001, the IMA collaborated with the Armory Museum in Moscow to organize <b>Gifts</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Tsars, 1500–1700: Treasures from the Kremlin. The show helped the IMA form partnerships with local arts organizations, gain international exposure, and attracted a record 70,704 visitors. Another important exhibit {{to travel to the}} IMA was Roman Art from the Louvre, which attracted 106,002 visitors during its 2008 run. The exhibition featured 184 mosaics, frescoes, statues, marble reliefs, and vessels loaned from the permanent collection of the Louvre in Paris, France. It was the largest collection ever loaned from the Louvre to date, and only stopped in three U.S. cities before returning to France.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Byzantine Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos left Constantinople for Adrianople, {{situated}} {{close to}} the Byzantine–Bulgarian border, in order to monitor the events and to exploit the situation in Bulgaria in his favour. The demise of Constantine Tikh {{came as a shock}} for the Byzantines. Initially, Michael VIII considered marrying his daughter to Ivaylo, but eventually decided that it would be more favourable to install a protégé of his own. His candidate was Ivan, son of former Emperor Mitso Asen, who had sought asylum in Byzantium and possessed estates in Asia Minor. Ivan promptly married Michael VIII's daughter Irene, pledged allegiance to Michael VIII and was proclaimed Emperor of Bulgaria as Ivan Asen III. The Byzantines sent <b>gifts</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Bulgarian nobles to incite them to support Ivan Asen III and envoys were dispatched to Tarnovo to arrange for his recognition and the surrender of Empress Maria. In the meantime, Ivan Asen III marched north {{at the head of a}} Byzantine army while Ivaylo was besieging Tarnovo.|$|E
