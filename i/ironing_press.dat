There were hours when the little shop could hardly accommodate its crowd of customers. Mrs. Postwhistle, of a bulk not to be moved quickly, had, after mature consideration, conquering a natural disinclination to change, decided to seek assistance.|$|R

25|$|These are folded down, so {{that the}} paper lies {{on the surface of}} the inked type. The bed is rolled under the platen, using a {{windlass}} mechanism. A small rotating handle is used called the 'rounce' to do this, and the impression is made with a screw that transmits pressure through the platen. To turn the screw the long handle attached to it is turned. This is known as the bar or 'Devil's Tail.' In a well-set-up press, the springiness of the paper, frisket, and tympan caused the bar to spring back and raise the platen, the windlass turned again to move the bed back to its original position, the tympan and frisket raised and opened, and the printed sheet removed. Such presses were always worked by hand. After around 1800, <b>iron</b> <b>presses</b> were developed, some of which could be operated by steam power.|$|R
50|$|While {{the chefs}} were {{preparing}} their dishes, each side would reveal a special ingredient that they hoped would sway the guests {{to vote for}} their respective dishes. The special ingredients could be anything from {{the focus of the}} recipe, such as a meat or vegetable, to a sauce or flavoring component. Though most of the special ingredients were found in often remote areas of Japan, some came from outside Japan, such as Mongolia, Korea, and even Scotland. In very rare and unusual instances, the special ingredients were not food items, but rather tools for preparing or serving the dish, such as a granite bowl from Korea, used in the preparation of stone-cooked bibimbap, or a special cast <b>iron</b> <b>press</b> used to make taiyaki. Each kitchen's special assistant would go to where the special ingredient was grown/raised/manufactured/harvested, to both procure the special ingredient and observe how it was produced.|$|R
50|$|The Columbian {{press was}} invented by George Clymer, {{probably}} in 1813, inspired in some measure by the earlier Stanhope press. It was designed to allow a whole newspaper page to be printed in a single pull. The press worked by a lever system, {{similar to that of}} the Stanhope press and quite different from the toggle action of the slightler later English Albion <b>press.</b> Clymer's new <b>iron</b> <b>press</b> was first advertised in April 1814. It went on to be manufactured in great numbers for over a century, chiefly in the United Kingdom but also in other European countries (a few were manufactured in America, but no surviving examples are recorded). It is sometimes, incorrectly, referred to as the 'Eagle' press due to the characteristic bald eagle counterweight which usually sits on the top lever. Some Columbians have the counterweight in another form (a simple ornament, a lamp, urn, or orb).|$|R
