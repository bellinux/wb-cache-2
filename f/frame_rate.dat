5|$|On January 3, 2008, IGN {{reported}} that Valve employees {{had created a}} thread on Valve's website forums for players to list the problems they had encountered and to suggest fixes, which caused speculation that a patch was being planned to address the issues in the PlayStation 3 version, such as the <b>frame</b> <b>rate</b> issues, the connection problems in Team Fortress 2, and the slow loading times in Portal. A patch for the PlayStation 3 version was later released in North America on March 19, 2008 and in Europe a short while after that; however, it {{made no mention of}} fixing <b>frame</b> <b>rate</b> issues or slow loading times.|$|E
5|$|The {{game had}} some {{technical}} problems {{when it was}} released. Tyrrel noted an unstable <b>frame</b> <b>rate</b> and occasional texture pop-up, and Kollar identified audio problems.|$|E
5|$|General praise went to {{the variety}} of choice in its {{narrative}} and gameplay, despite the former being seen as lacking in places and the latter being held back by other {{factors such as the}} limitations of the Biomod upgrade system and its limited environment sizes. Poor AI behavior was also a recurring criticism. The Xbox version was praised for its performance and graphics despite several reviewers noting distracting drops in <b>frame</b> <b>rate</b> and other technical issues. The PC version was frequently criticized as having similar <b>frame</b> <b>rate</b> issues in addition to problems with the controls, the necessity for a powerful computer to run the game properly, {{and the fact that the}} game was scaled down to run on the Xbox.|$|E

5|$|Microsoft added {{backward}} compatibility for the base game and its expansion on the company's Xbox One, {{the successor to}} the Xbox 360, in July 2016. Red Dead Redemption {{had been one of}} the most requested titles for the feature. The game's sales position on Amazon.com spiked following the announcement. The release runs at a smoother <b>frame</b> <b>rate</b> on the Xbox One.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} on Criterion's proprietary game engine RenderWare. The graphics engine was improved to give between 50–100% faster rendering than in Burnout 2. The increased performance {{allowed them to}} add features like real-time radiosity lighting and better environment mapping effects on vehicles. Programmers at the studio were adamant about making the game run at a <b>frame</b> <b>rate</b> of sixty frames per seconds to offer instant response and feedback while driving fast. Since the crash sequences were slower, the higher <b>frame</b> <b>rate</b> was less considered less critical than the spectacle of the vehicle collisions. They opted to run the game at thirty frames per second during these instances and dramatically {{increased the number of}} particles and debris that were rendered. From an early stage in development, the team wanted to include support for online network play in Burnout 3. They had never explored online play before, so they used Burnout 2 as a test-bed for the feature before integrating it into Burnout 3.|$|E
5|$|Dishonored 2 {{received}} generally favorable reviews {{according to}} Metacritic. On its release, PC players reported issues with performance such as loss of <b>frame</b> <b>rate</b> and display resolution, and system crashes. Three patches for the PC version were released {{to remedy the}} problem. The levels Clockwork Mansion and A Crack in the Slab were singled out to considerable praise. The game has been the recipient of over one hundred Best of 2016 awards.|$|E
50|$|When working entirely {{within the}} digital {{non-linear}} domain, 24p material is more easily handled than material of higher <b>frame</b> <b>rates.</b> 24p material requires care {{when it is}} processed using equipment designed for standard video <b>frame</b> <b>rates.</b>|$|R
50|$|There are {{two common}} {{workflows}} for processing 24p material using video equipment, one using PAL <b>frame</b> <b>rates,</b> {{and the other}} using NTSC <b>frame</b> <b>rates.</b> Of these two, the PAL route is the simpler, but {{each has its own}} complications.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the trade-off between {{temporal and spatial}} resolution in ultrasound tongue images at fast <b>frame</b> <b>rates.</b> The fastest lingual speech movements are investigated {{using a variety of}} echo pulse densities. Benefits and drawbacks of using higher <b>frame</b> <b>rates</b> are considered. Faster <b>frame</b> <b>rates</b> reduce distortion of the shape of the tongue during highly dynamic segments but it becomes increasingly difficult to discern the detail of that shape. The best temporal and spatial resolution is achieved with shorter distances between the probe and the tongue surface...|$|R
5|$|Fall of Cybertron {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} critics. Critics generally {{felt that the}} game was true to the Transformers franchise and provided good fan service, but some thought that the story pace slowed at times. Gameplay was mostly praised, but some reviewers cited the removal of War for Cybertrons cooperative campaign as a low point. Graphics and audio also received broadly positive comments, though some reviewers noticed <b>frame</b> <b>rate</b> issues with the PlayStation 3 version. A tie-in titled , which is partially set between War for Cybertron and Fall of Cybertron was released June 24, 2014.|$|E
5|$|Halo 3 {{does not}} {{natively}} render at true HD resolution (at least 720 lines of vertical resolution). In a Bungie Weekly Update, it was {{confirmed that the}} game renders at 1152×640 resolution instead of the usual 1280×720 (HD) resolution that most Xbox 360 games use. This is because Halo 3 uses two frame buffers instead of the usual one, so the lower resolution allowed Bungie to preserve as much of the dynamic range as possible for the game's lighting without adversely affecting the <b>frame</b> <b>rate.</b> The image can be upscaled to 1080p by the Xbox 360.|$|E
5|$|Seeds of Evil {{received}} {{very positive}} reviews from critics and {{sold more than}} one million copies in the United States. Critics generally praised the game for its detailed graphics, deep and long levels, and advanced artificial intelligence of enemies. However, the game's inconsistent <b>frame</b> <b>rate</b> and intense distance fog were common subjects of criticism. A remastered version of the game developed by Night Dive Studios was released for Microsoft Windows in 2017. A sequel, , was released in 2000.|$|E

50|$|In digital {{television}} and video, which are replacing their analog predecessors, single standards that can accommodate {{a wider range}} of <b>frame</b> <b>rates</b> still show the limits of analog regional standards. The ATSC standard, for example, allows <b>frame</b> <b>rates</b> of 23.976, 24, 29.97, 30, 59.94, and 60 frames per second, but not 25 and 50.|$|R
5|$|The N-Gage {{version of}} X-Men Legends {{contains}} {{most of the}} features found on the console versions. However, {{the game is played}} from an isometric point of view. Characters are two-dimensional sprites based on their three-dimensional console counterparts, and levels are redesigned to meet the limitations of the isometric point of view. Cutscenes were reused from the console versions, but are rendered at a much lower <b>frame</b> <b>rate.</b> Players can link with other N-Gage systems for four-player cooperative gameplay using GSM cellular technology.|$|E
5|$|The World Is Not Enough {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics and was frequently compared to Rare's Nintendo 64 first-person shooters GoldenEye 007 and Perfect Dark. It was also considered {{superior to its}} PlayStation counterpart because of its level design and inclusion of a multiplayer mode. Critics generally praised the game's graphics and smooth <b>frame</b> <b>rate,</b> but criticized its weak and inconsistent enemy artificial intelligence. In the United States, the game sold {{more than one million}} copies.|$|E
5|$|The game {{is powered}} by an {{internal}} engine developed previously by Insomniac Games for its game Fuse. The engine of the game was reworked and optimized for the Xbox One. The game runs on 900p at 30 <b>frame</b> <b>rate</b> per second. The game originally ran at a higher definition of 1080p, but {{it was decided to}} fix it at 900p so that more actions and enemies can appear on-screen.|$|E

40|$|To produce {{movies of}} {{supersonic}} flows, from which meaningful {{information can be}} extracted, is a non-trivial task. In a supersonic wind tunnel, speeds are {{of the order of}} 1, 000 m/s and the scale of turbulent structures is typically of the order of millimeter. To capture the flow details, exposure times of less than 0. 1 µs, and <b>framing</b> <b>rates</b> from 1 to 100 µs are desirable. While high-speed movie cameras with <b>framing</b> <b>rates</b> up to 5 million per second are commercially available, they are expensive, require an extremely-powerful light source, and are inflexible as to adjusting the exposure and the <b>framing</b> <b>rate</b> independently...|$|R
5|$|The {{game was}} first {{announced}} at E3 2003, where IGN staff {{noted that the}} game's demo appeared to be early in development due to its choppy <b>frame</b> <b>rate.</b> Pokémon Channel was released on July 18, 2003, in Japan, December 1 in North America, and April 2, 2004, in Europe. The game was showcased on its Japanese release date at the Sapporo, Hokkaido, location of , a series of promotional events that extended across Japan and lasted about a month. Attendees could play the game at GameCube kiosks.|$|E
5|$|The series' {{first three}} titles, X-Men vs. Street Fighter, Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter, and Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes, {{received}} praise for their frantic gameplay style, visual flair, playable character rosters, {{and the quality}} of their sprite animations. The games' Dreamcast and Sega Saturn ports were also lauded for their technical performance, matching the capabilities of the arcade versions. Conversely, the PlayStation ports were criticized for their removal of tag team battles and noticeable decline in <b>frame</b> <b>rate</b> and animation quality – changes which stemmed from the console's RAM limitations.|$|E
5|$|Upon release, Perfect Dark {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} and commercial success, selling {{more than three}} million units worldwide. Critics widely praised its customisable multiplayer modes and replay value, but some criticised its low and inconsistent <b>frame</b> <b>rate.</b> The game received the BAFTA Interactive Entertainment Moving Images Award for 2000 and the Golden Satellite Award for Best Interactive Product in 2001. The game is frequently cited {{as one of the greatest}} video games of all time. A remaster, also titled Perfect Dark, with enhanced graphics and online multiplayer, was released for the Xbox 360 in 2010.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper studies {{a visual}} {{feedback}} 3 D pose regulation problem explicitly handling camera <b>frame</b> <b>rates.</b> Although numerous works have already tackled vision-based estima-tion/control problems {{by focusing on}} the limitation of measured output (2 D visual information), almost all of them have assumed that visual measurements of a camera are continuously available. However, camera <b>frame</b> <b>rates</b> and image processing time are often non-negligible compared with other computation time. In view of this fact, we newly propose a discrete visual feedback pose regulation law under the situation that visual measurements are sampled due to <b>frame</b> <b>rates.</b> We first give a sufficient condition of <b>frame</b> <b>rates</b> to achieve a desired relative pose to a static target object. Then, the tracking performance for a moving target is analyzed via the notion of ultimate boundedness. The present analysis provides a guideline for the design of estimation/control gains. We finally show the significance and validity of this work through 3 D simulation. 1...|$|R

5|$|Although the {{original}} PC version of Elite Force gained critical acclaim, the 2001 PlayStation 2 port received a more negative reception. Majesco's port {{of the game}} garnered mediocre reviews, holding scores of 54 percent and 52 percent on Game Rankings and Metacritic respectively. While the level design, story and atmosphere were praised, critics were negative towards what was seen to be a poorly performed port, with complaints focused on difficult controls, graphical problems and <b>frame</b> <b>rate</b> issues. In addition, the artificial intelligence was deemed to be significantly worse than the earlier PC incarnation of the game. Several reviews suggested that Majesco had simply not put effort into the port, resulting in a level of quality behind that which was expected of PlayStation 2 games at the time.|$|E
5|$|Blacklist {{graphics}} {{and lack of}} difficulty were criticized. McCaffrey found the visuals unimpressive and most character models to be ugly; he also noted technical problems, such as screen-tearing and <b>frame</b> <b>rate</b> issues. Bloodworth criticized the game's invisible wall and unresponsive controls in certain segments, although he thought those minor issues did not drag down its overall experience. McCaffrey noted that even when {{the game is played}} in perfectionist mode, it is less challenging than its predecessors. He thought Blacklist gave players too many rewards, making its universal-economy system a useless feature. Bloodworth was puzzled by the game's unlock system, which he said hindered its credibility.|$|E
