Fowler left Cryovac in 1991 to become Vice President of Sales at United Technical Products in Canton, Massachusetts and in 1992 became Vice President at Rapid-Fill USA, that produced a patented product that he helped invent, an inflatable dunnage package.

40|$|Electrostatic {{discharges}} (ESDs) are everywhere—in {{our homes}} and businesses. Even {{the manufacturers of}} the electronics experi-ence ESD failures in their factories. Electronic devices are sensitive to ESD. ESD results in failure of our computers, calculators, and car phones. There are ways to protect these sensitive components. This paper looks at ESD protection from a two-pronged approach: reducing the likelihood of having an ESD event and improving the robustness of the devices themselves. The first approach focuses on {{reducing the amount of}} charge that is developed and controlling the redistribution of any charges that are developed. The second ap-proach reviews ways to improve the circuit robustness by improving individual circuit elements and by adding additional elements for charge flow control and voltage clamping.

40|$|Verification of ESD {{safety on}} full chip level {{is a major}} {{challenge}} for IC design. Especially phenomena with their origin in the overall product setup are posing a hurdle {{on the way to}} <b>ESD</b> <b>safe</b> products. For stress according to the Charged Device Model (CDM), a stumbling stone for a simulation based analysis is the complex current distribution among a huge number of internal nodes leading to hardly predictable voltage drops inside the circuits. This paper describes an methodology for Human Body Model (HBM) simulations with an improved ESD-failure coverage and a novel methodology to replace capacitive nodes within a resistive network by current sources for CDM simulation. This enables a highly efficient DC simulation clearly marking CDM relevant design weaknesses allowing for application of this software both during product development and for product verification...|$|E

This would be underpinned by a full, valid and unambiguous physicochemical and toxicological assessment of the hazardous properties of a substance including limit values for these harmful effects. Relevant SVHCs would be replaced by less hazardous, alternative substances or processes.

40|$|In Tanzania {{maternal}} and perinatal mortalities and morbidities are problems {{of public health}} importance, and {{have been linked to}} the shortage of skilled staff. We quantified the available workforce and the required nursing staff for perinatal care in 16 health institutions in Dar <b>es</b> Salaam. WHO <b>safe</b> motherhood needs assessment instruments were used to assess the availability of human resources, WHO designed Workload Indicators for Staffing Need (WISN) and Tanzanian standard activities and components of the workload for labour ward nursing were used to calculate nurse staffing requirements and WISN ratios. There was a severe shortage of essential categories of health staff for perinatal care in all institutions. The ranges of WISN ratios for nursing staff working in the municipal hospitals’ labour wards were; nurse officers 0. 5 – 1, trained nurses/midwives 0. 2 - 0. 4 and nurse assistants 0. 1. These findings reflect extremely huge perinatal care workload pressure and suggest the urgent need for more staff in order to achieve the global millennium development goals set for {{maternal and}} infant surviva...|$|R
40|$|The loss in {{muscle mass}} {{coupled with a}} {{decrease}} in specific force and shift in fiber composition are all marks of aging. Training and regular exercise attenuate the signs of sarcopenia. However, pathologic conditions limit the ability to perform physical exercise. We addressed whether electrical stimulation (ES) is an alternative intervention to improve muscle recovery and defined the molecular mechanism associated with improvement in muscle structure and function. We analyzed, at functional, structural, and molecular level, the effects of ES training on healthy seniors with normal life style, without routine sport activity. ES was able to improve muscle torque and functional performances of seniors and increased the size of fast muscle fibers. At molecular level, ES induced up-regulation of IGF- 1 and modulation of MuRF 1, a muscle-specific atrophy-related gene. ES also induced up-regulation of relevant markers of differentiating satellite cells and of extracellular matrix remodeling, which might guarantee shape and mechanical forces of trained skeletal muscle as well as maintenance of satellite cell function, reducing fibrosis. Our data provide evidence that <b>ES</b> is a <b>safe</b> method to counteract muscle decline associated with aging...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} the feasibility {{and safety of}} monopolar electrocautery shovel (ES) in laparoscopic total mesorectal excision (TME) with anal sphincter preservation for rectal cancer {{in order to reduce}} the cost of the laparoscopic operation, and to compare ES with the ultrasonically activated scalpel (US). METHODS: Forty patients with rectal cancer, who underwent laparoscopic TME with anal sphincter preservation from June 2005 to June 2007, were randomly divided into ultrasonic scalpel group and monopolar ES group, prospectively. White blood cells (WBC) were measured before and after operation, operative time, blood loss, pelvic volume of drainage, time of anal exhaust, visual analogue scales (VAS) and surgery-related complications were recorded. RESULTS: All the operations were successful; no one was converted to open procedure. No significant differences were observed in terms of preoperative and postoperative d 1 and d 3 WBC counts (P = 0. 493, P = 0. 375, P = 0. 559), operation time (P = 0. 235), blood loss (P = 0. 296), anal exhaust time (P = 0. 431), pelvic drainage volume and VAS in postoperative d 1 (P = 0. 431, P = 0. 426) and d 3 (P = 0. 844, P = 0. 617) between ES group and US group. The occurrence of surgery-related complications such as anastomotic leakage and wound infection was the same in the two groups. CONCLUSION: <b>ES</b> is a <b>safe</b> and feasible tool as same as US used in laparoscopic TME with anal sphincter preservation for rectal cancer on the basis of the skillful laparoscopic technique and the complete understanding of laparoscopic pelvic anatomy. Application of ES can not only reduce the operation costs but also benefit the popularization of laparoscopic operation for rectal cancer patients...|$|R
