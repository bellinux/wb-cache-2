500|$|Most of Gould's {{empirical}} research pertained to land snails. He focused his early {{work on the}} Bermudian genus Poecilozonites, while his later work concentrated on the West Indian genus Cerion. According to Gould [...] "Cerion is the land snail of maximal diversity in form throughout the entire world. There are 600 described species of this single genus. In fact, they're not really species, they all interbreed, but the names exist to express a real phenomenon which is this incredible morphological diversity. Some are shaped like golf balls, some are shaped like pencils. ... Now my main subject is the evolution of form, {{and the problem of}} how <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can get this diversity amid so little genetic difference, so far as we can tell, is a very interesting one. And if we could solve this we'd learn something general about the evolution of form." ...|$|E

Club {{suggested}} that the influence of Endtroducing..... {{may have had a}} negative effect on the album itself, saying that it [...] "has been partially diluted by the symphonic beat-collage culture it helped spawn." [...] The album's acclaim set considerably high standards for future releases by DJ Shadow, and he has expressed his dissatisfaction with being expected to [...] "repeat Endtroducing..... over and over again". Despite this, DJ Shadow {{has made it clear that}} he views the album in a positive light and denies any pressure that may have come about as a result of the album's praise: [...] "...people always seem to suggest that there's this pressure, and that Endtroducing..... is some kind of albatross, and I've just honestly never felt that way. I think that I have a healthy enough respect for the lineage of the music and how rare <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can connect with an audience. If that will always be 'the record' then so be it, that's cool." [...] As of April 26, 2005, Endtroducing..... has sold upwards of 290,000 copies in the United States alone.|$|E

[...] In an interview for Next Magazine, Lewis further elucidated upon the songs meaning: [...] "It was like coming from a place where you’ve been through a hard situation that has really made you reflect or look deep inside to figure out what <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> want to do next," [...] said Lewis. [...] "I had that breakthrough where now I feel strong in what I’m doing and strong in my decisions. I’m back and I’m ready to go for it." ...|$|E

5000|$|Here is the argument, {{as found}} in Origen:If <b>it</b> <b>is</b> fated <b>that</b> <b>you</b> will recover from this illness, then, {{regardless}} of whether you consult a doctor or you do not consult doctor you will recover.
