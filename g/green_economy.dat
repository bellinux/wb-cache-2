5|$|The Republic of Ireland {{has shown}} a strong {{commitment}} to renewable energy, ranking {{as one of the top}} 10 markets for cleantech investment in the 2014 Global <b>Green</b> <b>Economy</b> Index. Research and development in Ireland in renewable energy such as wind power has increased since 2004. Large wind farms are being constructed in coastal counties such as Cork, Donegal, Mayo and Antrim. The construction of wind farms has in some cases been delayed by opposition from local communities, some of whom overall consider the wind turbines to be unsightly. The Republic of Ireland is also hindered by an ageing network that was not designed to handle the varying availability of power that comes from wind farms. The ESB's Turlough Hill facility is the only power-storage facility in the state.|$|E

500|$|A recent UNEP report {{proposes a}} <b>green</b> <b>economy</b> defined {{as one that}} [...] "improves human {{well-being}} and social equity, while significantly reducing environmental risks and ecological scarcities": it [...] "does not favor one political perspective over another but works to minimize excessive depletion of natural capital". The report makes three key findings: [...] "that greening not only generates increases in wealth, in particular a gain in ecological commons or natural capital, but also (over a period of six years) produces {{a higher rate of}} GDP growth"; that there is [...] "an inextricable link between poverty eradication and better maintenance and conservation of the ecological commons, arising from the benefit flows from natural capital that are received directly by the poor"; [...] "in the transition to a <b>green</b> <b>economy,</b> new jobs are created, which in time exceed the losses in [...] "brown economy" [...] jobs. However, there is a period of job losses in transition, which requires investment in re-skilling and re-educating the workforce".|$|E

40|$|The {{challenges}} {{for creating a}} <b>greener</b> <b>economy</b> and the institutional framework for sustainable development pass necessarily, or mostly, through cities, as they concentrate a large and growing part of the world’s economy and population, as well as decision-making power. With the processes of urbanization and rural-urban transformation, the economy in cities, especially in cities of developing countries, has been shifting from traditional artisanal crafts and markets to more modern industry and service sectors. The concentration of people, resources, knowledge, political power and economic activities in urban areas, if properly managed, can provide economies of scale and efficiency gains that lower the use of resources and energy, and thereby promote doing more with less, while offering fair outcomes to the most vulnerable people and the environment. In this sense, transitioning from the traditional “brown” <b>economy</b> to a <b>greener</b> <b>economy</b> could be achieved by reducing resource and energy consumption in cities through improving the key components of the urban economic process...|$|R
500|$|By this logic, market-based {{solutions}} to ecological crises (ecological economics, environmental economics, <b>green</b> <b>economy)</b> are rejected as technical tweaks {{that do not}} confront capitalism's structural failures. [...] "Low-risk" [...] technology/science-based solutions such as solar power, sustainable agriculture, and increases in energy efficiency are seen as necessary but insufficient. [...] "High-risk" [...] technological solutions such as nuclear power and climate engineering are entirely rejected. Attempts made by businesses to [...] "greenwash" [...] their practices are regarded as false advertising, and it is pointed out that implementation of renewable technology (such as Walmart's proposition to supply their electricity with solar power) has the effect opposite of reductions in resource consumption, viz. further economic growth. Sustainable business models and the triple bottom line are viewed as morally praiseworthy but ignorant to the tendency in capitalism for the distribution of wealth to become increasingly unequal and socially unstable/unsustainable. Ecosocialists claim that the general unwillingness of capitalists to tolerate—and capitalist governments to implement—constraints on maximum profit (such as ecotaxes or preservation and conservation measures) renders environmental reforms incapable of facilitating large-scale change: [...] "History teaches us that although capitalism has at times responded to environmental movements ... at a certain point, at which the system's underlying accumulation drive is affected, its resistance to environmental demands stiffens." [...] They also note that, up until the event of total ecological collapse, destruction caused by natural disasters generally causes an increase in economic growth and accumulation; thus, capitalists have no foreseeable motivation to reduce the probability of disasters (i.e. convert to sustainable/ecological production).|$|E
500|$|Labour Party {{president}} Moira Coatsworth {{stated that}} the leadership contest would be a [...] "robust contest of ideas", and suggested to the party's caucus that {{a series of meetings}} with party members be held around New Zealand. These were held from 6 to 11 December in six major cities—Hamilton, Palmerston North, Wellington, Christchurch, Dunedin and Auckland. The party membership was then encouraged to give feedback to the party caucus, who would vote in the election. On 30 November Cunliffe, Parker and Shearer were interviewed by Mark Sainsbury on the current affairs programme Close Up. The television show held a text message poll in which viewers voted for their preferred leader of the party. Over 7,500 people took part; Shearer received 50% of the support, Cunliffe 31% and Parker 19%. The following day, Parker pulled out of the leadership race and put his support behind Shearer. Shearer and Cunliffe were interviewed by Guyon Espiner on political talkshow Q+A on 4 December. During the interview, both candidates indicated their support for the introduction of a capital gains tax, which was a key part of Labour's tax policy during the 2011 general election campaign. Both also disagreed with the 2008 Employment Relations Amendment Act (90-day workplace trial), and wanted New Zealand to invest further in research and development; Shearer mentioned striving for a more <b>green</b> <b>economy.</b> On 9 December, Horizon Research released a demographically-weighted survey which found that 35.4% of adult New Zealanders supported Shearer's bid for the leadership, and 19.9% backed Cunliffe.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to outline {{alternative}} pathways of large-scale water resources develop- ment in agriculture aimed at achieving <b>greener</b> <b>economies.</b> The agricultural sector is a primary target for policies aimed at promoting a more sustainable path of water resource use, as it is the greatest water- consuming sector globally using between 70 and 90 % of the water needed by an individual or an economy. The competition over water is expected to grow more intense over the next few years, with population growth playing a major pressurising role in developing countries. These global developments make it an imperative to re-evaluate traditional water management solutions based on large-scale mobilisation of surface and groundwater, and put forward alternative solutions that optimise water resources use in pursuit of socially and economically efficient outcomes, while ensuring environmental sustainability. This paper argues that there is significant potential for improving water resources development in the agricul- tural sector and that the optimisation of water use at multiple levels is a fundamental pre-requisite for the transition to <b>greener</b> <b>economies...</b>|$|R
