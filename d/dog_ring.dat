The {{first is the}} Main Ring which hosts the Horse & Pony Show in the morning, {{followed}} by main attractions in the afternoon, which have included interactive demonstrations of dogs, birds of prey, duck herding, racing terriers, Roman military re-enactments by the LEGIO SECVNDA AVGVSTA and classic car displays. It has also entertained the crowds with tug of war competitions, children's races and its locally famous Bush Tucker Challenge.

[...] However, the term swing dingle is more often published as being a type of logging sled. These early types are also called a <b>ring</b> <b>dog</b> or <b>ring</b> <b>dog</b> cant hook. In 1858, Joseph Peavey, a blacksmith in Stillwater, Maine, made a rigid clasp to encircle the cant dog handle with the hook on one side. It moved up and down, but not sideways.

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to determine whether α 2 -adrenoceptors mediate endothelium-dependent relaxations in veins and arteries of the pulmonary and systemic vasculature of the <b>dog.</b> <b>Rings</b> of either pulmonary or femoral artery and vein with and without endothelium were suspended for isometric force measurements in a buffered salt solution (37 °C; gassed with 95 % O 2 and 5 % CO 2). Removal of the endothelium caused a shift {{to the left of the}} concentration-response curves to epinephrine, norepinephrine and the selective α 2 -adrenoceptor agonist UK 14, 304, but not of that to the selective α 1 -adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine. In the presence of α 1 - and β-adrenoceptor blockers, norepinephrine and UK 14, 304 initiated relaxations of previously contracted rings. These relaxations were inhibited by the α 2 -adrenoceptor antagonist, rauwolscine, and were absent in rings without endothelium. In the pulmonary artery and femoral vein, the endothelium-dependent responses to UK 14, 304 were masked in part by direct α 2 -adrenergic activation of the vascular smooth muscle. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Experiments were {{performed}} to examine the interaction(s) between α 1 -adrenergic and S 2 -serotonergic receptors of vascular smooth muscle of the <b>dog.</b> <b>Rings</b> of isolated coronary and femoral arteries (without endothelium) were suspended for isometric tension recording in organ chambers filled with modified Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate solution. 5 -Hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) augmented the responsiveness to norepinephrine in the coronary artery (log shift at ED 50 of the concentration-response curve: 2. 9 -fold). In the femoral artery, the contractions to either norepinephrine or the partial α 1 -adrenergic agonist St 587 were unchanged by serotonin. Ketanserin (10 - M) augmented {{the response to the}} full α 1 -adrenergic agonist phenylephrine, but not to that of St 587; at 5 x 10 - 9 M, it depressed the contractions to phenylephrine. Ketanserin did not affect the α 1 -adrenergic blocking properties of prazosin. By contrast, prazosin, in a concentration selective for α 1 -adrenergic receptors, potentiated the inhibitory effect of ketanserin on contractions evoked by serotonin. These experiments suggest different interactions between S 2 -serotonergic and α 1 -adrenergic receptors in the canine coronary and femoral artery. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
