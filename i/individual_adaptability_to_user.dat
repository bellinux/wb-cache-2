40|$|Abstract — Android mobile {{operating}} system {{which is based on}} Linux Kernel 2. 6, has open source license and <b>adaptability</b> <b>to</b> <b>user</b> driven applications. As all other {{operating system}}s it has all the basic features like process scheduling, memory management, process management etc associated with it. Any mobile platform works smoothly when the process scheduling is performed in a proper way. Ideal platform is that in which no resource conflict occurs. Thus scheduling in every manner is essential for the operating system to adapt itself with the requirement of a particular application. In this paper, priority based pre-emptive task scheduling is proposed for the SMS application. The idea is to define High priority to required contacts, for ex. Contact numbers of parents or teachers will be given High priority. If in case, any SMS from these High priority contacts is received, the application would flash the SMS on the active screen and redirect this High priority SMS to the Priority Inbox...|$|R

40|$|Darwin&# 39;s finches are {{a classic}} example of {{adaptive}} radiation. The ecological diversity of the Galapagos in part explains that radiation, but the fact that other founder species did not radiate suggests that other factors are also important. One hypothesis attempting to identify the extra factor is the flexible stem hypothesis, connecting <b>individual</b> <b>adaptability</b> <b>to</b> species richness. According to this hypothesis, the ancestral finches were flexible and therefore able to adapt to the new and harsh environment they encountered by exploiting new food types and developing new foraging techniques. Phenotypic variation was initially mediated by learning, but genetic accommodation entrenched differences and supplemented them with morphological adaptations. This process subsequently led to diversification and speciation of the Darwin&# 39;s finches. Their current behaviour is consistent with this hypothesis as these birds use unusual resources by extraordinary means. In this paper, we identify cognitive capacities on which flexibility and innovation depend. The flexible stem hypothesis predicts that we will find high levels of these capacities in all species of Darwin&# 39;s finches (not just those using innovative techniques). Here, we test that prediction, and find that while most of our data are in line with the flexible stem hypothesis, some are in tension with it...|$|R

40|$|Smartphones, tablets, {{and other}} mobile devices exhibit vastly {{different}} constraints compared to regular or classic computing environments like desktops, laptops, or servers. Mobile devices run dozens of so-called “apps” hosted by independent virtual machines (VM). All these VMs run concurrently and each VM deploys purely local heuristics to organize resources like memory, performance, and power. Such a design causes conflicts across all {{layers of the}} software stack, calling {{for the evaluation of}} VMs and the optimization techniques specific for mobile frameworks. ^ In this dissertation, we study the design of managed runtime systems for mobile platforms. More specifically, we deepen the understanding of interactions between garbage collection (GC) and system layers. We develop tools to monitor the memory behavior of Android-based apps and to characterize GC performance, leading to the development of new techniques for memory management that address energy constraints, time performance, and responsiveness. ^ We implement a GC-aware frequency scaling governor for Android devices. We also explore the tradeoffs of power and performance in vivo for a range of realistic GC variants, with established benchmarks and real applications running on Android virtual machines. We control for variation due to dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS), Just-in-time (JIT) compilation, and across established dimensions of heap memory size and concurrency. Finally, we provision GC as a global service that collects statistics from all running VMs and then makes an informed decision that optimizes across all them (and not just locally), and across all layers of the stack. ^ Our evaluation illustrates the power of such a central coordination service and garbage collection mechanism in improving memory utilization, throughput, and <b>adaptability</b> <b>to</b> <b>user</b> activities. In fact, our techniques aim at a sweet spot, where total on-chip energy is reduced (20 – 30 %) with minimal impact on throughput and responsiveness (5 – 10 %).

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} discursive construction of consensually non-monogamous (CNM) relationships. The focus {{is limited to}} non-monogamists involved in primary, committed dyadic relationships who also pursue secondary, more casual partners. Using the framework of 2 ̆ 2 casualization, 2 ̆ 2 the dissertation carries out a discourse analysis of 25 in-depth interviews with straight and LGBT individuals and couples involved in CNM relationships. The term casualization of intimacy makes an analogy between the evolving norms of private life and the casualization of labor. For scholars of work in a global economy, the casualization of labor refers to decreasing job security for workers, coupled with increasing productivity {{and the demand for}} new skills. The casualization of intimacy means that our personal lives, like our work lives, are characterized by precarity, the need for flexibility, the feminization of communication, and the valorization of individual 2 ̆ 2 hard work. 2 ̆ 2 Analysis of interviews with non-monogamists demonstrates a construction of CNM in line with casualization. Non-monogamists portray their lifestyle as protective of partners 2 ̆ 7 autonomy and uniquely accommodating of change; <b>individual</b> <b>adaptability</b> <b>to</b> changing expectations is construed as a necessary virtue. The feminization of communication norms is demonstrated in interview subjects 2 ̆ 7 construction of verbal communication, particularly self-disclosure, as central to and distinctive of CNM relationships. Frequent communication about emotionally-fraught topics – jealousy, desire, insecurity – is considered essential to the success of CNM partnerships; interview participants often argued communication was 2 ̆ 2 more important than sex 2 ̆ 2 in distinguishing CNM and monogamous partnerships. This emphasis on communication suggests one reason CNM appeals to some women; it also disrupts an understanding of non-monogamy as inevitably sexist. Additionally, by framing the self-disclosure required by CNM as 2 ̆ 2 hard work, 2 ̆ 2 interview subjects align their lifestyle with the ethos of casualization. In sum, non-monogamists contrast an image of traditional, rigid, hierarchal, and monologic relationships with their construction of non-monogamy as a modern ethic of intimacy, one that is flexible, egalitarian, and dialogic, while also deemphasizing the instability and insecurity inherent in CNM. In trading predictability for excitement and security for freedom, the discourse of consensual non-monogamy highlights the promise and peril offered by the casualization of intimate life. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Replication on {{multiple}} nodes {{is an effective}} way to improve the availability in the P 2 P or grid environment. It is difficult to determine how many replicas can fulfill the user request of availability QoS, because of the undependable peers, networks and uncertainty of user access mode. We emphasize the availability QoS in the way that replica number should adapt to both the system undependability and fluctuant user demands on service capability of the replicas. Aiming to supply availability QoS <b>to</b> <b>users</b> at a low replica cost, we introduce a minimum replica cost model to predict the number of replicas and dynamically control the number of replicas and their cost. To mask the undependability of our P 2 P system, we regard replication as a redundant mechanic at the same time. In our model, a simulation is analyzed to describe the prediction of optimal replica number and compare the replica cost and availability in our system to those in others, under different cost strategies which affect the decision-making to the number of replicas in our system. The result shows that our system supplies a better availability QoS at an optimal replica cost by its <b>adaptability</b> <b>to</b> both <b>user</b> access mode and system undependability.
