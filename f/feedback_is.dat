25|$|Electronic {{feedback}} loops {{are used}} to control the output of electronic devices, such as amplifiers. A feedback loop is created when all or some {{portion of the output}} is fed back to the input. A device is said to be operating open loop if no output <b>feedback</b> <b>is</b> being employed and closed loop if <b>feedback</b> <b>is</b> being used.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} a {{negative}} <b>feedback</b> <b>is</b> that radiation leaving the Earth increases {{in proportion to the}} fourth power of temperature, in accordance with the Stefan-Boltzmann law. This <b>feedback</b> <b>is</b> always operational; therefore, while it may be overridden by positive feedbacks for comparatively small temperature changes it will dominate for larger temperature changes. An {{example of a}} positive <b>feedback</b> <b>is</b> the ice-albedo feedback, in which increasing temperature causes ice to melt, which increases the amount of heat that Earth absorbs. This feedback only operates in a restricted range of temperatures (those for which ice exists, and does not cover the whole surface; once all the ice has melted, the feedback ceases to operate).|$|E

40|$|A {{negative}} deflection in the event‐related {{potential is}} enhanced following error‐ and loss‐related feedback in decision‐making and simple gambling tasks. Researchers {{have assumed that}} the perceptual properties of the <b>feedback</b> stimuli <b>are</b> unimportant in explaining these effects. This assumption was tested {{in the present study}} through a flanker gambling task, in which the perceptual properties of the <b>feedback</b> <b>were</b> manipulated. Consistent with previous studies, loss elicited a larger feedback‐related negativity (FRN) than gain feedback. However, this FRN reward effect was modulated by the perceptual properties of the feedback stimuli. When gain and loss <b>feedback</b> <b>were</b> perceptually similar to each other, the enhancement of the FRN following the loss <b>feedback</b> <b>was</b> smaller compared to when the gain and loss <b>feedback</b> <b>were</b> different from each other. In addition, incongruent feedback elicited a larger FRN than congruent feedback; this FRN congruency effect was larger following gain than loss feedback. These results suggested that perceptual properties of the feedback stimuli {{play a role in the}} elicitation of the FRN...|$|R

25|$|However, as {{the amount}} of {{negative}} <b>feedback</b> <b>is</b> increased further, harmonics are reduced overall but new harmonics are introduced. Increasing feedback will continue to reduce total distortion towards zero provided the system is strictly stable.|$|E
25|$|The use of <b>feedback</b> <b>is</b> {{widespread}} {{in the design of}} electronic amplifiers, oscillators, and stateful logic circuit elements such as flip-flops and counters.

30|$|There was a {{marginal}} difference between recall of the to-be-learned responses in red {{when the original}} answer had been correct (and thus, false <b>feedback</b> <b>was</b> to be recalled; M[*]=[*]. 58, SD[*]=[*]. 21), compared to when the original answer had been incorrect (and thus, true <b>feedback</b> <b>was</b> to be recalled; M[*]=[*]. 67, SD[*]=[*]. 15, t(27)[*]=[*]−[*] 1.84, p[*]=[*]. 078), such that the recollection of the true feedback following an error was higher than the recall of false feedback following an initially correct response.|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effect of}} four different types of feedback (outcome, task properties, cognitive, combined task properties/ cognitive) on the risk assessment judgments of auditors on two tasks, one requiring configural cue processing and the other not requiring configural cue processing. Task properties feedback and combined feedback improved performance on both tasks. Outcome <b>feedback</b> <b>was</b> more effective for the non-configural task, while cognitive <b>feedback</b> <b>was</b> more effective for the configural task. We also found that, on the configural task, the effect of cognitive <b>feedback</b> <b>was</b> heightened by lower levels of participant self-insight. Finally, combined <b>feedback</b> <b>was</b> particularly effective in transferring knowledge across tasks. These results have direct practical application {{for the use of}} feedback in audit practice. From a theoretical perspective they also help to reconcile earlier mixed results in accounting and psychology. School of Accounting and Financ...|$|R

25|$|All {{amplifiers}} are bilateral to some degree; {{however they}} may often be modeled as unilateral under operating conditions where <b>feedback</b> <b>is</b> {{small enough to}} neglect for most purposes, simplifying analysis (see the common base article for an example).|$|E
25|$|The <b>feedback</b> <b>is</b> {{compressible}} and {{depends on}} the speed of sound. This may be called far field or acoustic feedback. the feedback distance of a compressible wave can be an appreciable fraction of the wavelength of the sound. An example is the flute.|$|E
25|$|<b>Feedback</b> <b>is</b> used {{extensively}} in digital systems. For example, binary counters and similar devices employ feedback where {{the current state}} and inputs are used to calculate a new state which is then fed back and clocked back into the device to update it.|$|E

25|$|Since {{estrogen}} {{circulating in}} the blood can negatively feedback to reduce circulating levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), most oral contraceptives contain ethinylestradiol, along with a progestin (synthetic progestogen).

25|$|Non-linear {{input-output}} relationship: The {{output voltage}} {{may not be}} accurately proportional {{to the difference between}} the input voltages. It is commonly called distortion when the input signal is a waveform. This effect will be very small in a practical circuit where substantial negative <b>feedback</b> <b>is</b> used.|$|E

30|$|For {{the purpose}} of our study of social design feedback, a viable {{approach}} to the assessment of usability evaluation output may be that of Følstad and Knutsen[35]. They presented a study where an online survey tool was used to collect design feedback from more than 200 user participants across four student design cases. They assessed the design feedback using two approaches: (a) The <b>feedback</b> <b>was</b> rated on usefulness by the involved student designers, and (b) the <b>feedback</b> <b>was</b> categorised according to its qualitative characteristics – positive, negative, constructive; constructive feedback included suggestions on needed design changes. About one-third of the design <b>feedback</b> <b>was</b> rated as useful. The feedback categorised as constructive was judged by the student designers as more useful that the other <b>feedback.</b> Negative <b>feedback</b> <b>was</b> judged as slightly more useful than positive <b>feedback,</b> which <b>was</b> not judged as useful at all. In follow-up interviews, the student designers were concerned {{with the lack of}} detail in the design feedback and suggested online dialogue between the participants as a means to improve the level of detail in the feedback.|$|R

A method for linearization of nonlinear systems by nonlinear state <b>feedbacks</b> <b>is</b> presented.

In this study, the collection and utilization of online user <b>feedback</b> <b>was</b> investigated in four design cases: all master student projects for industry clients involving seven student designers. A total of 272 user participants provided quantitative feedback. Half of these also provided qualitative feedback. One third of the qualitative <b>feedback</b> <b>was</b> perceived as useful by the student designers. The main usefulness of the <b>feedback</b> <b>was</b> related to strategic concept decisions rather than the interaction design of the early prototype. Lessons learnt are provided...|$|R

25|$|The <b>feedback</b> <b>is</b> {{essentially}} incompressible; {{the speed}} of sound, although finite, is sufficiently large {{that it can be}} considered infinite. This action may be called near field or hydrodynamic feedback. There are a number Class I devices. The feedback that causes a stick in a water stream to vibrate, or a flag to wave, is due to hydrodynamic feedback.|$|E
25|$|There are {{feedback}} loops {{associated with}} many whistle operations {{and they are}} non-linear.
