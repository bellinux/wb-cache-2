50|$|Male swans {{have been}} known to display {{aggressive}} behavior in order to protect their families, but such behavior generally decreases as the cygnet grows older. Wildlife worker Maria Evans suggested several factors which may have contributed to Hannibal's aggression, including poor water quality, limited <b>food,</b> <b>pollution,</b> lead poisoning, or the possibility that Hannibal was in pain after swallowing a fish hook. The aggressive behavior was only expressed towards other swans; humans were able to feed and later catch the bird without incident. Hannibal's killings stopped only when he injured one of his wings during an attack. Evans, who had been waiting for permission to remove the swan for several months, brought Hannibal to the Tinker's Hill Bird of Prey and Swan Rescue Centre where she bandaged his wing and injected painkillers.|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe have {{recently}} proposed that lifestyle-related factors, screening and aging cannot fully {{account for the}} present overall growing incidence of cancer. In order to propose the concept {{that in addition to}} lifestyle related factors, exogenous environmental factors may play a more important role in carcinogenesis than it is expected, and may therefore account for the growing incidence of cancer, we overview herein environmental factors, rated as certainly or potentially carcinogenic by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). We thus analyze the carcinogenic effect of microorganisms (including viruses), radiations (including radioactivity, UV and pulsed electromagnetic fields) and xenochemicals. Chemicals related to environmental pollution appear to be of critical importance, since they can induce occupational cancers as well as other cancers. Of major concerns are: outdoor air pollution by carbon particles associated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; indoor air pollution by environmental tobacco smoke, formaldehyde and volatile organic compounds such as benzene and 1, 3 butadiene, which may particularly affect children, and <b>food</b> <b>pollution</b> by food additives and by carcinogenic contaminants such as nitrates, pesticides, dioxins and other organochlorines. In addition, carcinogenic metals and metalloids, pharmaceutical medicines and cosmetics may be involved. Although the risk fraction attributable to environmental factors is still unknown, this long list of carcinogenic and especially mutagenic factors supports our working hypothesis according to which numerous cancers may in fact be caused by the recent modification of our environment...|$|E
40|$|Mining in {{developing}} countries are located in rural areas where agriculture is {{the main source of}} livelihood. Mining communities in Ghana's mineral-rich regions engage in food crop production. These regions are actually leading the production of cash crops like cocoa, oil palm and citrus. They also produce in large quantities food staples like plantain, maize, cocoyam, legumes and an assortment of vegetables. The paradox, however, these areas have seen unprecedented boom in activities of ASM. This gives potential negative spillovers to individuals who are involved in farming through environmental pollution and competition for key inputs (like, land, water, and labor). To exam this situation, we employed the impact of gold mining on staple food crop production in Ghana. We estimated the yield of agricultural productivity for major crop in a selected areas where ASM is intensive using both quantitative data analysis and qualitative systemic literature reviewed. It suggests that a 1 % increase in ASM production might reduce agricultural production in Ghana. This may be as a result of pollution from mines and agricultural land used by mines. Gold price and mining price have a positive relationship with agricultural production, statistically significant at 0. 01 levels. Furthermore, we find that the mining activity is associated with food insecurity (<b>food</b> <b>pollution)</b> and poverty reduction. A simple cost-benefit analysis shows that, the actual fiscal contributions of mines in Ghana wouldn't have been enough to compensate the affected populations considering the hug negative effect mining from ASM...|$|E
40|$|Background: One of {{the most}} {{critical}} problems in the field of water and <b>food</b> <b>pollution</b> is the heavy metal pollution. Agricultural products are exposed to this type of contamination through wastewater; industrial activity and population pollutions are also in its area. Since the plant in the affected areas can directly enter heavy metals into the food chain, so, it is important to check their level of contamination. The {{purpose of this study was}} to monitor distribution of copper and nickel in the grape cultured in the farms around Marvast in Yazd province. Methods: All chemicals were of analytical grade. In order to determine the level of copper and nickel in grape extracts produced from the most important areas in grape production, 7 samples of grape were taken from these geographic regions. After grinding and homogenizing of samples, the concentration of nickel and copper, heavy metals were measured by atomic absorption spectrometer. The obtained results were analyzed through SPSS software based on statistical methods. Results: The mean value of copper and nickel were 26. 4 ± 3. 1 and 12. 3 ± 1. 5 μg/kg, respectively. According to the obtained results and their comparison with standards, different amounts of copper and nickel were observed in all samples, however, the highest amount of these metals was observed in one sample. Conclusions: Concentrations of heavy metals in samples from different regions were lower than the maximum allowable concentration of copper and nickel. Although, the amount of these metals in one sample, known as pollution indicator, suggested that this area can be exposed to both...|$|E

40|$|Environmental {{pollution}} and food safety {{are two of}} the most important issues of our time. Soil and water pollution, in particular, have historically impacted on food safety which represents an important threat to human health. Nowhere has that situation been more complex and challenging than in China, where a combination of {{pollution and}} an increasing food safety risk have affected {{a large part of the}} population. Water scarcity, pesticide over-application, and chemical pollutants are considered to be the most important factors impacting on food safety in China. Inadequate quantity and quality of surface water resources in China have led to the long-term use of waste-water irrigation to fulfill the water requirements for agricultural production. In some regions this has caused serious agricultural land and <b>food</b> <b>pollution,</b> especially for heavy metals. It is important, therefore, that issues threatening food safety such as combined pesticide residues and heavy metal pollution are addressed to reduce risks to human health. The increasing negative effects on food safety from water and soil pollution have put more people at risk of carcinogenic diseases, potentially contributing to &# 39;cancer villages&# 39; which appear to correlate strongly with the main food producing areas. Currently in China, food safety policies are not integrated with soil and water pollution management policies. Here, a comprehensive map of both soil and water pollution threats to food safety in China is presented and integrated policies addressing soil and water pollution for achieving food safety are suggested to provide a holistic approach.

40|$|Background Litchi stink-bug, Tessaratoma papillosa Drury (Hemiptera: Tessaratomidae), {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{widespread}} and destructive pest species on Litchi chinensis Sonn and Dimocarpus longan Lour in Southern China. Inappropriate use of chemical pesticides has resulted in serious environmental problems and <b>food</b> <b>pollution.</b> Generating an improved Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategy for litchi stink-bug in orchard farming requires development of an effective biological control agent. Entomopathogenic fungi are regarded as a vital ecological factor in the suppression of pest populations under field conditions. With few effective fungi and pathogenic strains available to control litchi stink-bug, exploration of natural resources for promising entomopathogenic fungi is warranted. Methods & Results In this study, two pathogenic fungi were isolated from cadavers of adult T. papillosa. They were identified as Paecilomyces lilacinus and Beauveria bassiana by morphological identification and rDNA-ITS homogeneous analysis. Infection of T. papillosa with B. bassiana and P. lilacinus occurred initially from the antennae, metameres, and inter-segmental membranes. Biological tests showed that the two entomopathogenic fungi induced high mortality in 2 nd and 5 th instar nymphs of T.  papillosa. B. bassiana was highly virulent on 2 nd instar nymphs of T. papillosa, with values for cadaver rate, LC 50 and LT 50 of 88. 89 %, 1. 92  ×  107  conidia/mL and 4. 34 days respectively. Discussion This study provides two valuable entomopathogenic fungi from T.  papillosa. This finding suggests that the highly virulent P. lilacinus and B. bassiana play an important role in the biocontrol of T. papillosa in China. These pathogenic fungi had no pollution or residue risk, and could provide an alternative option for IPM of litchi stink-bug...|$|E
40|$|ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY {{first became}} an {{important}} question for political decision-makers, public opinion polls have shown clear and consistent racial differences in attitudes toward this issue. White adults tend to express greater awareness, concern, and irritation about pollution than black adults do (Ostheimer and Ritt, 1976; Grenson, 1971 : 15; Van Arsdol, et al., 1965 : 152), even though blacks {{are more likely than}} whites to live in areas where factories, freeways, and other sources of pollution are heavily concentrated. As Gary Mayor Richard Hatcher states, "Sorne black leaders are telling those who listen to them that the issue of pollu-tion is 'a white thing. ' Facts show, however, that air, water, sewage and <b>food</b> <b>pollution</b> threaten Black people most because of where we live and under what conditions " (UAW, 1973). In a survey of over 2, 000 Florida children and teenagers in grades two through twelve, we can determine whether the racial difference in adults' Abstract Clear and consistent differences between blacks ' and whites ' attitudes toward en-vironmental issues were found in a stratified random sample survey of 2, 012 Florida pre-adults. Blacks were much less likely than whites to consider environmental quality a serious problem worthy of community concern, to favor environmental goals, and to define pollu-tion in complex terms; regression analysis showed that these differences persisted even when factors thought to explain racial differences in attitudes—SES, years of education, exposure to information, actual and perceived pollution levels, sense of efficacy—were taken into ac-count. Evidence suggests that even among children, racial differences in attitudes are not spurious, but indicate a divergence between the black and white subcultures in inter-pretations of public issues...|$|E
