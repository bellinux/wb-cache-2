5|$|The {{incident}} {{involved the}} accidental triggering {{of a fire}} extinguishing system which sealed two forward compartments and released Halon 2402 (<b>freon</b> R-114B2), dibromotetrafluoroethane gas into them. According to survivors, those affected by the gas release were caught off guard and {{may not have been}} alerted in time due to warning sirens sounding only after the gas had already begun pouring in. Some of the victims were reported to have been unable to turn on breathing kits before they suffocated.|$|E
5|$|All of the {{currently}} used volatile anesthetic agents are organofluorine compounds. Aside from {{the synthesis of}} <b>Freon</b> (Thomas Midgley, Jr. and Charles F. Kettering, 1928) and the discovery of Teflon (Roy J. Plunkett, 1938), the field of organofluorine chemistry had not attracted {{a great deal of}} attention up to 1940 because of the extreme reactivity of elemental fluorine, which had to be produced in situ for use in chemical reactions. The development of organofluorine chemistry was a spin-off from the Manhattan Project, during which elemental fluorine was produced on an industrial scale for the first time.|$|E
5|$|Although {{a primary}} {{concern of the}} Sprint missile was high speed, the design was not {{optimized}} for maximum energy, but instead relied on the first stage (booster) to provide as much thrust as possible. This left the second stage (sustainer) lighter than optimal, to improve its maneuverability. Staging was under ground control, with the booster cut away from the missile body by explosives. The sustainer was not necessarily ignited immediately, depending on the flight profile. For control, the first stage used a system that injected <b>Freon</b> into the exhaust to cause thrust vectoring to control the flight. The second stage used small air vanes for control.|$|E

40|$|A tunable {{infrared}} free-electron laser {{comprised of}} a train of picosecond pulses was utilized to destroy the <b>Freons</b> CFCl 3 and CF 2 Cl 2 by multiple-photon dissociation. The experiments explored the effects of laser frequency, laser fluence, spectral bandwidth, frequency chirping, reactant partial pressure, and oxygen (or air) partial pressure. We determined the optimum laser frequencies for dissociation of both of the <b>Freons</b> and also showed that a broader spectral bandwidth laser enhances reaction. A strong reduction of dissociation fraction with increasing pressure made infrared photodissociation of <b>Freons</b> at near atmospheric pressure difficult. Improvement of the high-pressure photolysis would require a laser macropulse much shorter than the 2 mu s used in these experiments...|$|R

5|$|The {{attitude}} was controlled with three hydrazine thrusters. The satellite transmitted data {{back to the}} ground with S-Band and Very High Frequency (VHF) transmitters, at a rate of 15 Mbit/s and 6 bit quantization. The satellite had three-axis fine attitude control with four wheels, which gave it +/- 0.7 degrees of control. The attitude control system also used horizon scanners, sun sensors, and a command antenna. A <b>freon</b> gas propulsion system allowed the satellite to make fine attitude adjustments. Landsat 2 could store 30 minutes worth of data on two wide-band video tape recorders.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to {{the work on the}} destruction of aryl chlorides {{it has been shown that}} aliphatic chlorine and bromine compounds such as perchloroethylene, <b>Freon</b> (1,1,2-trichloro-1,2,2-trifluoroethane) and halon-2402 (1,2-dibromo-1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethane) can be dehalogenated by the action of radiation on alkaline isopropanol solutions. Again a chain reaction has been reported.|$|E
40|$|The basic {{parameters}} (range, signal-to-noise ratio, and sensitivity) of a lidar using NH 3 and CO 2 lasers are calculated. The principle of lidar operation {{is based on}} the differential absorption recording. Absorption spectra of all known <b>Freons</b> are considered in the spectral range 9 - 13. 5 mu m and optimal wavelengths suitable for sensing them are determined. It is shown that the NH 3 -CO 2 lidar can sense <b>Freons</b> at distances up to 10 km at a signal-to-noise ratio exceeding 10. Sensitivities of the lidar for sensing Freon- 11 using various lines of the ammonia laser are calculated. It is shown that remote sensing of Freon- 11 at concentrations of the order of 5 x 10 (- 6) % is possible at distances up to 8. 5 km...|$|R
40|$|Formation {{of carbon}} black from <b>Freons</b> was studied in RF thermal plasma conditions. Equilibrium {{compositions}} {{of the products}} were calculated by computer code ASTRA 4. 0.

By comparing the calculated and experimental results a model was constructed on carbon black formation in RF thermal plasma reactor...|$|R
5000|$|Other compounds. Water has {{no effect}} on the catalyst, as well as various <b>Freons</b> and NH3. Here again, with NH3, there is {{conflicting}} evidence from some users, who have seen a degradation after several injections, but other researchers were not able to confirm it.

25|$|In the 20th century, DuPont {{developed}} many polymers such as Vespel, neoprene, nylon, Corian, Teflon, Mylar, Kapton, Kevlar, Zemdrain, M5 fiber, Nomex, Tyvek, Sorona, Corfam, and Lycra. DuPont developed <b>Freon</b> (chlorofluorocarbons) for the refrigerant industry, {{and later}} more environmentally friendly refrigerants. It also developed synthetic pigments and paints including ChromaFlair.|$|E
25|$|Uranium {{trioxide}} reacts at 400°C with freon-12 to form chlorine, phosgene, {{carbon dioxide}} and uranium tetrafluoride. The freon-12 can be replaced with freon-11 which forms carbon tetrachloride instead of carbon dioxide.

25|$|In 1998, Courage entered three C41-based {{cars in the}} 24 Hours of Le Mans; one C41, {{driven by}} Franck <b>Fréon,</b> Olivier Thévenin and Yojiro Terada, and two C51s, with Cottaz and Goossens partnering Jean-Philippe Belloc in one, and Fredrik Ekblom, Patrice Gay and Tetsuya Tsuchiya driving the other. The C41 {{finished}} in 15th, having completed 304 laps, whilst the Cottaz/Belloc/Goossens C51 retired due to an issue with its gear lever after 232 laps, and the other C51 succumbed to a water leak after 126 laps. Equipe Promotion Racing then ran a C41 in the International Sports Racing Series, entering Geoff Farmer and John Burton in the RAC Tourist Trophy; they took tenth overall, and seventh in the SR1 category. At the Coupes d'Automne, Equipe Promotion Racing selected Didier André and Franck <b>Fréon</b> to drive the C41, and they took fourth overall.|$|E

50|$|Typical {{polyimide}} {{parts are}} {{not affected by}} commonly used solvents and oils — including hydrocarbons, esters, ethers, alcohols and <b>freons.</b> They also resist weak acids but are not recommended for use in environments that contain alkalis or inorganic acids. Some polyimides, such as CP1 and CORIN XLS, are solvent-soluble and exhibit high optical clarity. The solubility properties lend them towards spray and low temperature cure applications.|$|R
2500|$|The {{main cause}} of ozone {{depletion}} and the ozone hole is man-made chemicals, especially man-made halocarbon refrigerants, solvents, propellants, and foam-blowing agents (chlorofluorocarbon (CFCs), HCFCs, <b>freons,</b> halons), [...] referred to as ozone-depleting substances (ODS). These compounds are transported into the stratosphere by winds after being emitted at the surface. Once in the stratosphere, they release halogen atoms through photodissociation, which catalyze the breakdown of ozone (O3) into oxygen (O2).|$|R
25|$|Until the 1990s, the {{refrigerants}} {{were often}} chlorofluorocarbons such as R-12 (dichlorodifluoromethane), {{one in a}} class of several refrigerants using the brand name <b>Freon,</b> a trademark of DuPont. Its manufacture is now banned or severely restricted by the Montreal Protocol of August 1987 because of the damage that CFCs cause to the ozone layer if released into the atmosphere.|$|E
25|$|During the 1930s and 1940s, the DuPont company commercialized organofluorine {{compounds}} {{at large}} scales. Following trials of chlorofluorcarbons as refrigerants {{by researchers at}} General Motors, DuPont developed large-scale production of Freon-12. DuPont and GM formed a joint venture in 1930 to market the new product; in 1949 DuPont took over the business. <b>Freon</b> {{proved to be a}} marketplace hit, rapidly replacing earlier, more toxic, refrigerants and growing the overall market for kitchen refrigerators.|$|E
25|$|A {{critical}} DuPont manufacturing {{patent for}} <b>Freon</b> {{was set to}} expire in 1979. The United States banned the use of CFCs in aerosol cans in 1978. The European Community rejected proposals to ban CFCs in aerosol sprays, and in the U.S., CFCs continued {{to be used as}} refrigerants and for cleaning circuit boards. Worldwide CFC production fell sharply after the U.S. aerosol ban, but by 1986 had returned nearly to its 1976 level. In 1993, DuPont shut down its CFC facility.|$|E

50|$|The {{main cause}} of ozone {{depletion}} and the ozone hole is man-made chemicals, in particular man-made halocarbon refrigerants, solvents, propellants, and foam-blowing agents (chlorofluorocarbon (CFCs), HCFCs, <b>freons,</b> halons), referred to as ozone-depleting substances (ODS). These compounds are transported into the stratosphere by winds after being emitted at the surface. Once in the stratosphere, they release halogen atoms through photodissociation, which catalyze the breakdown of ozone (O3) into oxygen (O2).Both types of ozone depletion were observed to increase as emissions of halocarbons increased.|$|R
25|$|Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) {{are fully}} {{halogenated}} paraffin hydrocarbons that contain only carbon, chlorine, and fluorine, produced as volatile derivative of methane, ethane, and propane. They are also commonly {{known by the}} DuPont brand name <b>Freon.</b> The most common representative is dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12 or Freon-12). Many CFCs {{have been widely used}} as refrigerants, propellants (in aerosol applications), and solvents. Because CFCs contribute to ozone depletion in the upper atmosphere, the manufacture of such compounds has been phased out under the Montreal Protocol, and they are being replaced with other products such as hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) (e.g., R-410A) and R-134a.|$|E
25|$|A few {{suspension}} refinements {{were made}} for 1964. The front coil springs were changed from constant-rate to progressive or variable-rate and were more tightly wound at the top, while leaf thickness of the rear transverse spring was also altered thus providing a more comfortable ride with no sacrifice in handling. Shock absorbers were reworked toward the same end. The 1964 Corvette arrived with a new standard shock containing within its fluid reservoir a small bag of <b>Freon</b> gas that absorbed heat. Chevy added more sound insulation and revised body and transmission mounts for the 1964 Corvette. It also fitted additional bushings to quiet the shift linkage and placed a new boot around the lever. The result was a more livable car for everyday transportation.|$|E
25|$|In late October 1967, Scorpion started {{refresher}} training and weapons system acceptance tests, {{and was given}} a new commanding officer, Francis Slattery. Following type training out of Norfolk, Virginia, she got underway on 15 February 1968 for a Mediterranean Sea deployment. She operated with the 6th Fleet into May and then headed west for home. Scorpion suffered several mechanical malfunctions, including a chronic problem with <b>Freon</b> leakage from refrigeration systems. An electrical fire occurred in an escape trunk when a water leak shorted out a shore power connection. (However, major steam and leakage problems are not uncommon on U.S. Navy or Royal Navy submarine deployments, even in the 21st Century.) There {{is no evidence that}} the Scorpions speed was restricted in May 1968, although it was conservatively observing a depth limitation of 500 feet, due to the incomplete implementation of planned post-Thresher safety checks and modifications.|$|E
40|$|The isochoric thermal {{conductivity}} of solid trifluoromethane was investigated for three samples of different densities in the interval from 75 K to {{the onset of}} melting.
