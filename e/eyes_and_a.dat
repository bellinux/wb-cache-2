5|$|Mantises have large, {{triangular}} {{heads with}} a beak-like snout and mandibles. They have two bulbous compound eyes, three small simple <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> pair of antennae. The {{articulation of the}} neck is also remarkably flexible; some species of mantis can rotate their heads nearly 180°.|$|E
5|$|In 1888 and 1889, Othniel Charles Marsh {{described}} the first well preserved horned dinosaurs, Ceratops and Triceratops. In 1890 Marsh classified {{them together in}} the family Ceratopsidae and the order Ceratopsia. This prompted Cope to reexamine his own specimens and to realized that Triceratops, Monoclonius, and Agathaumas all represented a single group of similar dinosaurs, which he named Agathaumidae in 1891. Cope redescribed Monoclonius as a horned dinosaur, with a large nasal horn and two smaller horns over the <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> large frill.|$|E
5|$|Later a {{portrait}} of Moreno was discovered {{that had been done}} from life, by the Peruvian silversmith Juan de Dios Rivera. This portrait was painted between 1808 or 1809, before Moreno's appointment as secretary of the Junta. It is now considered to be the closest representation of Moreno's real appearance. In this portrait, he is depicted with an elongated face, abundant hair, long sideburns, big <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> pointy nose.|$|E
50|$|The female is 12 cm {{long and}} weighs 8 g.

5|$|Although {{the black}} catbird is {{unlikely}} to be mistaken for any other mimid species, there are several other black birds — including the melodious blackbird, the bronzed cowbird and the giant cowbird — that occur within the same range and might conceivably cause confusion. All are birds of more open habitats. The melodious blackbird is larger and longer tailed; it has dark <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> stocky bill with an evenly curved culmen. The bronzed cowbird is thicker necked than is the catbird and has a bronzy, rather than purplish or greenish gloss to its plumage; its eye is bright red rather than dark red. The giant cowbird is considerably larger, and is relatively longer tailed and thicker necked than is the catbird.|$|E
5|$|Based on Z. tonsora, queens {{are similar}} in {{appearance}} to Gerontoformica based on the mandibular structure; these mandibles have two teeth, {{one of which is}} apical (situated closer to the apex) and the other is subapical (below the apex tooth). Other similar body structures include the large ocelli, short scapes, 12 antennomeres (antenna segments), small <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> clypeal margin that has a row of peg-like denticles (small bumps on a tooth). Queens can be distinguished from Gerontoformica by their flattened, broad heads. They have a broad, concave clypeal margin with a high number of denticles and two short vertical rows of denticles. They have mandibles which are half the length of Gerontoformica and have a dense brush of spicule-like setae. Furthermore, the vertex (the upper surface of the head) has a pair of oval-shaped rugose (wrinkled) patches.|$|E

5|$|Designed by {{visual effects}} artist Phil Tippett, Jabba the Hutt was {{inspired}} by the anatomy of several animal species. His body structure and reproductive processes were based on annelid worms, hairless animals that have no skeleton and are hermaphroditic. Jabba's head was modeled after that of a snake, complete with bulbous, slit-pupilled <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> mouth that opens wide enough to swallow large prey. His skin was given moist, amphibian qualities. Jabba's design would come to represent almost all members of the Hutt species in subsequent Star Wars fiction.|$|E
5|$|Nasodigitoacoustic {{syndrome}} is congenital and {{is characterized by}} a number of nasal, facial and cranial features. These include a broad and high, sometimes depressed nasal bridge (top of the nose, between the <b>eyes)</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> flattened nasal tip. This can give the nose a shortened, arch-like appearance. Hypertelorism (unusually wide-set eyes), prominent frontal bones and supraorbital ridge (the eyebrow ridge), bilateral epicanthic folds (an extra flap of skin over the eyelids), a broad forehead and an overall enlarged head circumference have also been observed. A bulging of the upper lip with an exaggerated cupid's bow shape, and maxillary hypoplasia (underdevelopment of the upper jaw) with retraction have also been reported.|$|E
5|$|The Sunda slow loris has dark rings {{around its}} large eyes, a white nose with a whitish strip that {{extends to the}} {{forehead}} and a dark stripe that stretches {{from the back of}} the head along the spine. Its soft, thick, woolly fur ranges from light brown to deep reddish brown, with a lighter underside. The species is distinct from the Bengal slow loris due to the dark inverse teardrop markings around the eyes which meet the dark dorsal stripe on the back of the head. It tends to have a much more distinct white stripe between the eyes, more distinct dark coloring around the <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> browner coat than the Bengal slow loris which is larger, grayer, and shows less contrast. The Sunda slow loris has less white facial coloring than the much smaller pygmy slow loris. Local color variations are known to occur.|$|E

5|$|The gray {{mouse lemur}} shares many traits with other mouse lemurs, {{including}} soft fur, a long tail, long hind limbs, a dorsal stripe {{down the back}} (not always distinct), a short snout, rounded skull, prominent eyes, and large, membranous, protruding ears. It has large <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> tapetum lucidum to enhance its vision at night. The dorsal coat is brownish-gray with various reddish tones, the flanks are light gray to beige, and the ventral fur has discrete dull beige or whitish-beige patches along portions of the belly. On the rounded face, there is a pale white patch above the nose and between the eyes; some individuals have dark orbital markings. The furred portions of the hands and feet are off-white.|$|E
5|$|The vulture is {{minimally}} sexually dimorphic, with {{no difference}} in plumage and little in size between males and females. The juvenile vulture has a dark bill and <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> downy, gray neck that soon begins to turn the orange of an adult. Younger vultures are a slate gray overall, and, while they look similar to the adult by the third year, they do not completely molt into adult plumage until they are around {{five or six years}} of age. Jack Eitniear of the Center for the Study of Tropical Birds in San Antonio, Texas reviewed the plumage of birds in captivity of various ages and found that ventral feathers were the first to begin turning white from two years of age onwards, followed by wing feathers, until the full adult plumage was achieved. The final immature stages being a scattered black feathers in the otherwise white lesser wing coverts.|$|E
5|$|A smallish crake, the African crake has brown-streaked blackish upperparts, bluish-grey underparts and {{black-and-white}} barring on {{the flanks}} and belly. It has a stubby red bill, red <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> white {{line from the}} bill to above the eye. It is smaller than its closest relative, the corn crake; that species is also lighter-plumaged, and has an eye stripe. The African crake has a range of calls, the most characteristic being a series of rapid grating krrr notes. It is active during the day, and is territorial on both the breeding and non-breeding grounds; the male has a threat display, and may fight at territory boundaries. The nest is a shallow cup of grass leaves built in a depression under a grass tussock or small bush. The 3–11 eggs start hatching after about 14 days, and the black, downy precocial chicks fledge after four to five weeks. The African crake feeds {{on a wide range}} of invertebrates, along with some small frogs and fish, and plant material, especially grass seeds. It may itself be eaten by large birds of prey; snakes; or mammals, including humans, and can host parasites. Although it may be displaced temporarily by the burning of grassland, or permanently by agriculture, wetland drainage or urbanisation, its large range and population mean that it is not considered to be threatened.|$|E

5|$|A {{text from}} Tikal {{mentions}} K'uk' Mo' {{and has been}} dated to AD406, 20 years before K'uk' Mo' Ajaw founded the new dynasty at Copán. Both names are likely {{to refer to the}} same individual originally from Tikal. Although none of the hieroglyphic texts that mention the founding of the new Copán dynasty describe how K'uk' Mo' arrived at the city, indirect evidence suggests that he conquered the city by military means. On AltarQ he is depicted as a Teotihuacano warrior with goggle <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> war serpent shield. When he arrived at Copán he initiated the construction of various structures, including one temple in the talud-tablero style typical of Teotihuacan and another with inset corners and apron moldings that are characteristic of Tikal. These strong links with both the Maya and Central Mexican cultures suggest that he was at least a Mexicanized Maya or possibly even from Teotihuacan. The dynasty founded by king K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' ruled the city for four centuries and included sixteen kings plus a probable pretender who would have been seventeenth in line. Several monuments have survived that were dedicated by K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' and by his heir.|$|E
5|$|The {{paintings}} depict isolated figures {{enclosed in}} spaces that are undefined, overwhelmingly claustrophobic, reductive and eerie. Coming early in Bacon's career, they are uneven in quality, but show a clear progression especially {{in how they}} utilise and present ideas he was still clearly developing and coming to terms with. Head I (actually begun {{in the winter of}} 1948) and Head II show formless pieces of flesh that broadly resemble human heads; they have half-open <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> pharynx, though it is positioned much higher than would be expected in a human. Heads III, IV and V show fully formed busts recognisable as men, and are characterised by a haunted atmosphere. These two broad ideas coalesce in Head VI, which is as physiologically tortured as the first two paintings, and as spectral as the middle three. In Head VI the figure has developed and is now shown wearing vestments, the first indication in Bacon's work of the influence of Velázquez, while the focus has become the open mouth and the study of the human scream.|$|E
5|$|The {{skull of}} Voalavo also {{resembles that of}} Eliurus, with a long facial skeleton, an hourglass-shaped interorbital region (between the <b>eyes),</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> smooth interorbital region and braincase, without ridges or shelves. Other shared {{characteristics}} include an essentially featureless bony palate, without many pits and ridges, and a broad mesopterygoid fossa (the opening behind the palate). In other characteristics, Voalavo resembles some but not all species of Eliurus. For example, {{the length of the}} incisive foramina matches the maximum seen in Eliurus species (in this case, in Major's tufted-tailed rat and White-tipped tufted-tailed rat). The back margin of the incisive foramen is rounded in eastern voalavo, but angular in northern voalavo. The two species also differ {{in the shape of the}} suture (dividing line) between the maxillary and palatine bones, which is straight in eastern voalavo, but more curved in northern voalavo. The capsular process, a projection at the back of the mandible (lower jaw) that houses the root of the lower incisor, is indistinct in Voalavo, a feature it shares with Grandidier's tufted-tailed rat, Major's tufted-tailed rat, and Petter's tufted-tailed rat, but not the other species of Eliurus.|$|E
