25|$|The sulfate {{minerals}} all {{contain the}} sulfate anion, 2−. They {{tend to be}} transparent to translucent, soft, and many are fragile. Sulfate minerals commonly form as evaporites, where they precipitate out of evaporating saline waters; alternative, sulfates {{can also be found}} in <b>hydrothermal</b> <b>vein</b> systems associated with sulfides, or as oxidation products of sulfides. Sulfates can be subdivided into anhydrous and hydrous minerals. The most common hydrous sulfate by far is gypsum, CaSO4⋅2H2O. It forms as an evaporite, and is associated with other evaporites such as calcite and halite; if it incorporates sand grains as it crystallizes, gypsum can form desert roses. Gypsum has very low thermal conductivity and maintains a low temperature when heated as it loses that heat by dehydrating; as such, gypsum is used as an insulator in materials such as plaster and drywall. The anhydrous equivalent of gypsum is anhydrite; it can form directly from seawater in highly arid conditions. The barite group has the general formula XSO4, where the X is a large 12-coordinated cation. Examples include barite (BaSO4), celestine (SrSO4), and anglesite (PbSO4); anhydrite {{is not part of the}} barite group, as the smaller Ca2+ is only in eight-fold coordination.|$|E

This deposit is found is the Tombstone Plutonic Suite, a series of gold bearing intrusions stretching across Alaska and the Yukon known as the Tombstone Gold Belt.. These deposits are characterized by sheeted mineralized veins within granitoid intrusions and fault-veins, breccias and replacement style mineralization in the country rocks. The Eagle Gold deposit in particular is a <b>hydrothermal</b> <b>vein</b> hosted gold deposit. The gold bearing veins cut through felsic intrusions and country rock, dipping south and striking NE.|$|E
50|$|There {{are basic}} {{intrusive}} rocks {{that have been}} identified as dolerites https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Di%C3%A1base and which occur in the form of veins 0.5 to 3m thick, with an orientation predominantly N-S and vertical inclination. They are dark grey, fine grain and micro-porphyritic, being altered in the contact with the mineralized veins. They present irregular fractures and polyhedral disjunction. Mineralogically they are essentially formed by labradorite, hornblenda, chlorite Chlorite group and amphibolitized pyroxene. They do not affect the mineralization and are intersected by the <b>hydrothermal</b> <b>vein</b> system. These dykes follow the two phases of deformation. In the eastern zone of Couto Mineiro, there are spotted schist with spots of biotite and chlorite, and less frequently of chiastolite Chiastolite and cordierite Cordierite corresponding to a contact metamorphism halo, which was considered as an indication of the presence of an intrusion of an in-depth magmatic body.|$|E
5000|$|The {{rocks in}} {{question}} {{are part of}} a metamorphosed supracrustal sequence located at the south-western tip of the island. The sequence has been dated as no younger than 3.85 billion years old - that is, in the Hadean eon - based on the age of an igneous band that cuts the rock. [...] The supracrustal sequence contains layers rich in iron and silica, which are variously interpreted as banded iron formation, chemical sediments from submarine hot springs, or <b>hydrothermal</b> <b>vein</b> deposits. Carbon in the rock, present as graphite, shows low levels of carbon-13, which may suggest an origin as isotopically light organic matter derived from living organisms. [...] However, this interpretation is complicated because of high-grade metamorphism that affected the Akilia rocks after their formation. The sedimentary origin, age and the carbon content of the rocks have been questioned.|$|E
50|$|It {{occurs in}} low to {{moderate}} temperature <b>hydrothermal</b> <b>veins</b> {{and in some}} contact metamorphic deposits. It is a minor ore of copper and associated metals. It was first described in 1845 for occurrences in Freiberg, Saxony, Germany.|$|R
