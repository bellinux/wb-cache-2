50|$|Geologically the {{district}} forms {{part of the}} vast Indo-Gangetic alluvial tract, of which the origin is attributed to a sag in the earth's crust, formed, in the upper eocene times, between the northwardly drifting Gondwanaland and the rising Himalayan belt, and gradually filled in by sediments so as to constitute a level plane with a very gentle seaward slope. The alluvium formation of {{the district}}, comprising sand, silt & clay with occasional gravel, is of the early quaternary to sub-recent age. The older alluvium called bhangar, forms slightly elevated terraces usually above the flood levels. It is rather dark in colour generally rich in concretions and nodules of impure calcium carbonate, locally known as <b>kankar.</b> The newer alluvium, called khandar, forming the lowlands between the Ganga and Bhangar, is light coloured, poor in calcarious contain and composed of lenticular beds of sand, gravel and clays. The economic minerals found in the district are <b>kankar,</b> reh and sand.|$|E

5000|$|Red {{and yellow}} soils {{are derived from}} the parent rocks of the Gondwana System {{including}} sedimentary rocks. They are formed in-situ from the erosion of such rocks caused by rain. This soil is found particularly in east Sitapur, south Ambikapur, central Surajpur and Pratappur blocks. The red color is due to wide diffusion of iron while hydration of ferric oxide results in a yellow color in the soil. This soil is of lighter texture and has a porous and friable structure. Soluble salt is found in small quantities. Lime, <b>kankar</b> and free <b>kankar</b> are totally absent. These soils are poor in potash, nitrogen, humus and carbonate and differ greatly in consistency, color, depth and fertility. On the uplands they are thin and gravelly, sandy, porous and light coloured alluvium, generally transported from elsewhere, are found along river banks in alternate layers of sand and silt in East Ramanujganj, North Ambikapur, and Surajpur, along the river banks of the Rihand, [...] Kanhar, and the Hasdeo rivers and their major tributaries. The colour of the soil is not uniform but varies from yellow to grey. Laterite soils are well developed on the summits of the plateau regions of Samri and Sitapur tehsil including Shankargargh, Kusmi, Sitapur, Batoli and Mainpat blocks of Mainpat, Jamirapat, Lahsunpat and Jonkpat.|$|E
50|$|Caliche (ka-lee'-chee, or {{sometimes}} klee'-chee) is a sedimentary rock, a hardened natural cement of calcium carbonate that binds other materials—such as gravel, sand, clay, and silt. It occurs worldwide, in aridisol and mollisol soil orders—generally in arid or semiarid regions, including {{in central and}} western Australia, in the Kalahari Desert, in the High Plains of the western USA, in the Sonoran Desert, and in Eastern Saudi Arabia Al-Hasa. Caliche {{is also known as}} hardpan, calcrete, <b>kankar</b> (in India), or duricrust. The term caliche is Spanish and is originally from the Latin calx, meaning lime.|$|E

5000|$|Concrete canal lining {{is often}} used due to its high {{structural}} strength and longevity. Concrete used for canal lining is typically non-reinforced, {{as a way to}} reduce cost. A common method for constructing concrete lining is the use of slip forms, which are drawn {{down the length of the}} canal as the concrete is poured. Hand laying of concrete or prefabricated sections are also used when only a short distance needs to be covered. [...] Certain additives, such as <b>kankar</b> lime and surkhi, are sometimes included in the concrete mixture to improve water retention.|$|E

5000|$|The lake's {{geological}} {{history was}} studied by French geologists who compared {{it with the}} geology of Danakil lakes. According to this study, the lake originally contained freshwater overlying the 15 m mantle of tufas, marls and calcretes. At an elevation of 100 m [...] "Melanoides tubeculatus (Melania tuberculata), Corbicula consobrina and Coelatura teretiuscula" [...] were reported [...] "resting on the basalts". At the present bed level, the formations of marls with Ervilius purpura and cerithium sp., are indicative of gradual transformation over the centuries to saline water lake; the reason could be on account of lagoon or marine intrusion. Diatomite with Navicula sp., <b>kankar</b> and nodules of gypsum are discerned above the saline band. These bands are converted into gypsiferous layers succeeded by rock salt layers; these layers are seen up to the lake level.|$|E
