5|$|On 24 January 1959, Churchill College, Cambridge, was {{formally}} recognised by the University. Two days later, the Trustees announced that Cockcroft would be its first Master. Although {{it would also}} teach the <b>humanities</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>sciences,</b> 70 per cent {{of the student body}} would study science and technology related subjects. Cockcroft nominated the first fellows, and he oversaw the initial construction. Controversy arose over the chapel. A 1961 plan to build it {{at the entrance to the}} college, as was traditional at Cambridge, led to the immediate resignation of Francis Crick, a staunch atheist, as a fellow. The first undergraduates arrived in 1961, and the college, still incomplete, {{was formally}} opened by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, on 5 June 1964.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Based on the {{analysis}} of ecological civilization under the horizon {{of the importance of}} cultivating the public quality of humanistic <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>science,</b> this paper discusses the construction of ecological civilization as a systematic project, <b>and</b> development of <b>humanities</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>science</b> literacy, as a focal point of ecological civilization in cultivating public <b>humanities</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>science</b> literacy, is the foundation of the systematic project. The goal of this cultivation should meet the requirements of the relevant education on ecological civilization. This paper proposes the scientific literacy of the public relations directly relating to the professional skills, and forming the public accomplishment, to which <b>humanities</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>science</b> <b>and</b> educational level are positively related, and aims at and analyzes the strategies in developing public <b>humanities</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>science.</b> Keywords—ecological civilization; the public; <b>humanities</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>science</b> literacy; cultivation I...|$|R

5|$|The {{university}} runs {{a number}} of academic institutions and programs apart from its undergraduate and postgraduate schools. It operates the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools (a private day school for K-12 students and day care), the Sonia Shankman Orthogenic School (a residential treatment program for those with behavioral and emotional problems), and a public charter school with four campuses on the South Side of Chicago administered by the university's Urban Education Institute. In addition, the Hyde Park Day School, a school {{for students with learning}} disabilities, maintains a location on the University of Chicago campus. Since 1983, the University of Chicago has maintained the University of Chicago School Mathematics Project, a mathematics program used in urban primary and secondary schools. The university runs a program called the Council on Advanced Studies in the <b>Humanities</b> <b>and</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Sciences,</b> which administers interdisciplinary workshops to provide a forum for graduate students, faculty, and visiting scholars to present scholarly work in progress.|$|E
5|$|Through the 1950s {{increased}} funding advanced {{the place of}} sciences within the institution. In 1950, the university had completed the construction of three academic buildings for the sciences, all designed by local architect William Russell Souter. Public funding was eventually necessary to ensure the <b>humanities</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> <b>sciences</b> were given an equal place. Thus, in 1957 the University reorganized once again under The McMaster University Act, 1957, dissolving the two colleges. Its property was vested to McMaster and the university became a nondenominational institution eligible for public funding. The historic Baptist connection was continued through McMaster Divinity College, a separately chartered affiliated college of the university. Also in 1957, PhD programs were consolidated in a new Faculty of Graduate Studies. Construction of the McMaster Nuclear Reactor also began in 1957, {{and was the first}} university-based research reactor in the Commonwealth when it began operating in 1959.|$|E
