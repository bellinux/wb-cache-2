By help of energy and material flow analysis, e. g., sources and sinks of harmful substances may be detected and eliminated. The aim of this EC Regulation is not only to obey the governmental restrictions, but much rather to realize a continuous improvement of environmental protection by regular participation in external audits.

Marketing audit is a comprehensive analysis of the company and its surroundings, which does not contain only simple analysis of the current situation of the company but also the draft measure. Marketing audit in this thesis is carried out based on the methodology described in the theoretical part and consists of the analyses of six interrelated parts. The first part of the audit (audit of marketing environment) analyzes the external environment of IMI Hydronic Engineering realized through PESTLE analysis and Porter's five forces analysis. The following five sections are focusing on <b>internal</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>audit</b> of this company. These parts of the audit are: audit of marketing strategy, audit of marketing, audit of marketing systems, audit of marketing productivity and audit of marketing functions.

40|$|Previous {{studies on}} {{companies}} {{listed on the}} Bucharest Stock Exchange (BSE) revealed {{that most of these}} entities do not meet the new corporate governance requirements about independent directors, Audit Committeemembers and the general recommendations of transparency. Companies that apply a lower level of corporate governance recommendations tend to have poorer performance, being less profitable and having a higher volatility. Correlation between corporate governance and internal audit is approached through the determinism relationship between turnover, assets investments and employees attraction, and positivity of this relation shows that it is beneficial of the performance of these companies. An effective internal audit function is supposed to assist management to fulfillits governance responsibilities. The environmental aspects incorporated in internal audit area will reduce the pressure from stakeholders on the environmental actions and impact of the company and their trust of the information disclosed on the overall performance will increase. The study is based on quantitative analysis using a multiple linear regression model to explain economic phenomena. The variables used are: turnover (CA), fixed assets (AI) and number of employees (SAL) reported for 2010 by thecompanies listed on BSE, BVB and RASDAQ sections. This paper evaluates the financial performance, measured by turnover, dependent variable relative to changes in factors that influence performance, expressed by the independent variables, fixed assets and number of employees and present behaviour of companies under financial and economic crisis, inviting them to know the causes that affect reaching the performance, to change their actions and set priorities.

40|$|This article investigates {{whether an}} <b>environmental</b> <b>audit</b> has been {{conducted}} at a Federal Institution of Education. The specific objectives are to: i) verify the environmental controls held at the institution, ii) investigate the <b>environmental</b> <b>audits</b> within the institution; and, iii) prepare a list containing the main environmental factors that could be monitored by the institution. The research has a descriptive purpose; the procedures we used are bibliographic, document review, and case study. The research instrument is documentary research or primary sources to approach {{the problem in the}} qualitative way. The study sample is a federal institution of professional and technological education, and temporal analysis includes the years 2011, 2012 and 2013. Based upon the annual plan for internal audit activities, and on the annual report of the internal audit activities, we found that the institution has not conducted any <b>environmental</b> <b>audits</b> in the investigated period. The result was that, in relation to internal control, there is the obligation for the adoption of a Plan of Sustainable Logistics (PSL) and its publicity on the institutional web page. We found the absence of the PSL at the institution, making it impossible to assert that the institution conducts <b>internal</b> <b>environmental</b> controls. We observed only a self-assessment in the institutional management report, in which one of its topics included information on sustainable procurement, awareness campaigns, and waste separation.

After an extensive introduction to the concept, this review focuses on the similarities and differences between an <b>environmental</b> <b>audit</b> and a financial statement <b>audit.</b> Except that <b>environmental</b> <b>audits</b> are largely unregulated, the general approach to both types of audits is similar. Both audits place an emphasis on the evaluation of control systems, which is an argument in favor of external auditors playing a role in <b>environmental</b> <b>audits.</b> Another argument for including external accountants, is their code of ethics. However, these professionals seem to be reluctant to enter the field of <b>environmental</b> <b>auditing.</b> It is argued that this reluctance is {{because of a lack of}} generally accepted principles for conducting <b>environmental</b> <b>audits.</b> If external accountants are engaged in <b>environmental</b> <b>auditing,</b> they should be part of multidisciplinary teams that also include scientists and engineers to avoid a too strong focus on procedures.

40|$|The Swedish {{government}} decided in 1996 that the governmental authorities are to implemement environmental management systems. Each year, the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency compiles the authorities’ reports on their environmental management systems. The compilation shows that {{not more than}} 20 % of the authorities perform environmental audits. This study aims to investigate the authorities’ view of internal environmental audits, the incentives of performing them. It also investigates if the environmental audits contribute to continuous improvements. The study is {{a case study of}} nine participating authorities that all reported to have performed environmental audits in 2005. The interviews were analysed based on the extent of the internal environmental audits. The result shows that three of the nine participating authorities did not perform any environmental audit at all. The results suggest that the incentives of the greatest importance for internal environmental audits in the other six authorities are external requirements, mainly requirements in ISO 14001, as well as commitment in environmental issues among the employees and the organisational management. The study also suggests that continuous improvement {{is a result of the}} <b>internal</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>audit.</b> This is mainly due to the increased environmental awareness within the administration and because of the continuous improvement of the environmental management system...|$|E
40|$|All organisations {{make some}} {{contribution}} to the {{degradation of the environment}} through their use of resources and production of waste. Environmental management systems (EMS) standards can provide a tool for companies to systematically reduce their environmental impacts. ISO 14001 was published in 1996. This fitted in with plans of the case study company to take proactive action in this area, even though there was no legislative requirement for them to do so. As EMS implementation was a new area at the time, appropriate methodologies were developed to address different aspects of the implementation, and ISO 14001 was successfully implemented in the company. The results of the primary research included: ♦ Drawing up a methodology for identifying and interpreting the environmental legislation that may {{have an impact on the}} organisation and compiling a register of such regulations. ♦ Developing a robust methodology for assessing significant environmental aspects and impacts and applying this to the software company. ♦ Establishing objectives and targets for those aspects identified as significant and implementing environmental management programmes to meet these. ♦ Developing an <b>internal</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>audit</b> procedure based on auditing against the significant aspects. ♦ Integrating areas of the EMS with the existing quality management system in order to avoid duplication of effort. ♦ Undergoing an external assessment process in order to achieve certification of the system. The thesis concludes that the systematic approach defined in ISO 14001 provided a mechanism that the organisation was able to adopt to bring about improvement in its environmental performance. The system was based on a thorough evaluation of the organisation's significant environmental aspects in order to bring about a reduction in its negative impacts. The ISO 14001 requirement for continual improvement is the key driver of the system, and this is what differentiates it from ISO 9000...|$|E

The General Motors (GM) campaign which is discussed in this article led towards major institutional changes for the implementation of corporate social responsibility (environmental) reporting originally referred to as social (<b>environmental)</b> <b>auditing.</b> The Securities and Exchange Commission&# 039;s (SEC) role and actions are analysed in detail in order to highlight the direction of this Federal Agency in relation to the implementation of social (<b>environmental)</b> <b>auditing.</b> Design/methodology/approach - A detailed analysis of literature from the early 1970 s is undertaken in order to identify the inception of <b>environmental</b> <b>auditing</b> and the types of <b>environmental</b> <b>auditing</b> as social auditing in its early stages. The case of the GM campaign is analysed in order to highlight the forms of historical institutionalism relevant to the critical stage of exogenous influences on companies to undertake social (<b>environmental)</b> <b>auditing.</b> Findings - It is found that in the early 1970 s companies resisted the incorporation of corporate social responsibility initiatives and actions as part of their agendas. <b>Environmental</b> <b>Auditing</b> as a type of social auditing at that time referred to corporate social responsibility disclosures that included environmental disclosures. Due to public pressure and civil society activism companies had to adopt and undertake social (<b>environmental)</b> <b>auditing.</b> The initial stages of environmental disclosures included reporting on environmental expenses and liabilities of the companies. The SEC imposed minimal disclosure requirements for <b>environmental</b> <b>auditing,</b> which were nevertheless adequate to undertake action against companies found to be providing misleading environmental information in their publicly available disclosures...|$|R
40|$|In {{an effort}} to assure and move beyond {{regulatory}} compliance, Rochester Institute of Technology has begun implementing an environmental management system (EMS) through the RIT Strategic Environmental Management Initiative. As part of this initiative, RIT is considering implementing a comprehensive auditing program to evaluate environmental compliance and management system performance. This thesis evaluates current <b>environmental</b> <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> program design and implementation practices at other colleges and universities, and compares those to standard <b>environmental</b> <b>audit</b> program implementation and design in the industrial regulated community. The thesis evaluates compliance auditing programs at seven colleges and universities of varying sizes, and <b>environmental</b> management system <b>auditing</b> programs at one ISO 14001 -registered university. From this evaluation and comparison, an audit program design strategy recommendation is offered for RIT. It {{was found that the}} elements being implemented in the university setting closely mirror those recommended by industrially focused literature sources for industrial entities. At this point, these elements are effectively helping colleges and universities manage their environmental issues and ensure compliance, however, it is still too early in the process to evaluate the long-term effectiveness of the industrially focused design and implementation elements being applied in the university setting. As these programs mature, colleges and universities may uncover better ways to organize and manage their audit programs than what is typically recommended for industry. RIT, as it undertakes the task of designing and implementing its internal auditing program, should find mechanisms to keep up with what practices other colleges and universities are implementing to make their internal auditing programs effective. As new design and implementation information becomes available, RIT may decide not to use the recommendations made in this thesis. In the meantime, however, RIT may use these recommendations {{as a starting point for}} its internal auditing program, and can later build upon them to reach its environmental performance goals...|$|R

40|$|New {{international}} standards for <b>environmental</b> <b>auditing</b> {{are now being}} actively promoted by public authorities and adopted by private firms. One important feature of these standards is their emphasis on managerial systems and incentives that support a wiser use of environmental resources. This paper studies such a system, in which incentive compensation may be {{based in part on}} the results of an <b>environmental</b> <b>audit.</b> It is found that optimal wages after an <b>environmental</b> <b>audit</b> is performed should have a greater range than wages paid when no audit has occurred. It is also shown that the decision to conduct an <b>environmental</b> <b>audit</b> {{and the size of the}} expected wage in this case depend crucially on whether the agent's prudence (or precautionary motives) dominates or not his aversion to risk. It is finally found that the insertion of <b>environmental</b> <b>audits</b> within current management systems would certainly induce a manager to care more about the environment; although this may come at the expense of less concern for other activities, we find plausible circumstances in which properly designed <b>environmental</b> <b>audits</b> overcome such a trade-off and increase the manager's attention to both environmental and traditional tasks. Some implications of the analysis for environmental public policy are also discussed briefly...|$|R
