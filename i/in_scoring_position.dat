5|$|The {{fourth quarter}} began with Smith fumbling the {{football}} with Oakland <b>in</b> <b>scoring</b> <b>position.</b> New York defensive end Gerry Philbin recovered the football at the Jets' 3-yard line {{setting up a}} 97-yard drive, consisting entirely of two Namath passes to Don Maynard, who was covered by Raiders' rookie cornerback George Atkinson. The 50-yard touchdown pass followed a 47-yard throw, and gave the Jets a 26–22 lead. Turner added another field goal to the Jets' total, giving them a 29–22 lead. The Raiders promptly responded with Lamonica orchestrating an 88-yard drive that ended with a 22-yard pass to receiver Fred Biletnikoff with less than four minutes remaining in the game, tying the contest.|$|E
5|$|Adams still {{uses the}} same 26-inch-wide bass drum he began with in 1973. He has stated that he bought {{it as part of}} a set for $25 at a garage sale. It has the same head {{on the side of the}} drum that Adams does not beat, but Adams has stated that he replaces the other side about twice a year and also goes through about three sets of mallets each year. During games, Adams tends to drum at {{particular}} moments: when the Indians take the field at the beginning of the game, if the Indians have runners <b>in</b> <b>scoring</b> <b>position,</b> if the Indians are tied or trailing near the end of the game, or if they are winning at the top of the ninth inning. Because of his drumming, Adams became a celebrity and his drum was soon nicknamed Big Chief Boom-Boom, by Indians radio announcer Herb Score. It has also helped him meet politicians, including U.S. senators and a Pakistani government official.|$|E
50|$|Points {{are awarded}} to the top eight {{on the scale of}} 10-8-6-5-4-3-2-1, with each car <b>in</b> a team <b>scoring</b> points even if {{multiple}} entries finish <b>in</b> <b>scoring</b> <b>positions.</b>|$|R

5|$|Following the post-touchdown kickoff {{and a short}} return, Nebraska's offense {{began work}} at its 21-yard line. Three rushes by as many {{different}} players—Joel Makovicka, Damon Benning, and Jay Sims—resulted in 11 yards and a first down. During Sims' run, Tech's Loren Johnson committed a 15-yard personal foul facemask penalty that pushed Nebraska to the Nebraska 47-yard line. From there, Frost threw an incomplete pass, then Sims ran twice for fifteen yards and a first down, crossing into the Virginia Tech half of {{the field in the}} process. Now at the Tech 38-yard line, Frost completed a 23-yard throw to Lance Brown, who picked up another first down at the Tech 15-yard line. With time running out in the quarter, the Cornhuskers executed a quick four-yard rush to the Tech 11-yard line. At {{the end of the first}} quarter, Virginia Tech led Nebraska, 70, but the Cornhuskers were <b>in</b> <b>scoring</b> <b>position.</b>|$|E
5|$|Next, the Dodgers came to Citizens Bank Park for {{a three-game}} series. After the Phillies lost game one (2–0) in a pitchers' duel between Hernandez and Clayton Kershaw, {{when they were}} zero-for-nine with runners <b>in</b> <b>scoring</b> <b>position,</b> David Buchanan made his major-league debut on May 24. The Phillies won 5–3, with Buchanan getting the win after a five-inning start and Papelbon earning his 13th save. The next day, Josh Beckett pitched a no-hitter for a 6–0 Dodger victory. The next day (Memorial Day), Kendrick had his first win since August 6, 2013; Howard's five RBIs gave the Phillies a 9–0 win over the Colorado Rockies. The team lost game two of the series, 6–2, despite Ben Revere's first major-league home run; Hamels allowed four runs in seven innings, and Jeff Manship gave up two more in the eighth.|$|E
5|$|Uribe {{began his}} {{professional}} career in 1997 {{when he was}} signed by the Colorado Rockies. After advancing through the minors, he made his MLB debut with the Rockies in 2001. He became their shortstop in 2001 and spent all of 2002 in that capacity. He missed part of 2003 with an injury and {{was traded to the}} Chicago White Sox following the season. After one season as a utility player, Uribe became the starting shortstop for the White Sox in 2005; he held that position for the next three years. While Uribe was with the White Sox, the team won the 2005 World Series against the Houston Astros. Uribe hit 21 home runs in 2006 but had a low on-base percentage. He hit 20 home runs in 2007 but had a low batting average with runners <b>in</b> <b>scoring</b> <b>position</b> (RISP). In 2008, Uribe lost his starting shortstop role to Orlando Cabrera and shifted to the starter at second, but then lost that job to rookie Alexei Ramírez. He eventually ended the season as the team's third baseman due to an injury to Joe Crede.|$|E
50|$|In , Trulli {{was hoping}} Toyota {{would make a}} big step forward. Timo Glock was {{confirmed}} as his teammate for the season. Trulli started the season quite well, with several points scoring finishes, the height {{of which was a}} fourth-place finish in Malaysia. Trulli's qualifying performances were also very good throughout the first few rounds of the Championship. His form then slumped a little, with disappointing performances in Turkey and Monaco, as he finished <b>in</b> non-points <b>scoring</b> <b>positions.</b>|$|R
50|$|Racing: Chris {{made his}} {{debut in the}} series at the Dutch round in the 2007-08 season. After missing round 2 in Brno, he raced the next 4 rounds, being <b>in</b> a points <b>scoring</b> <b>position</b> <b>in</b> New Zealand before being hit from behind, and was 2nd quickest in Rookie Qualifying at Eastern Creek.|$|R
5000|$|Denmark {{competed in}} the second half of the first semi-final on 22 May [...] and {{qualified}} to the final. In the final, Denmark performed <b>in</b> fifteenth <b>position,</b> <b>scoring</b> 21 points and placing 23rd out of 26 songs.|$|R
5|$|Virginia Tech's Tommy Edwards fielded {{the opening}} kickoff, which was {{returned}} to the Tech 29-yard line, where the Hokies' offense began the first play of the game, an incomplete pass by Virginia Tech quarterback Maurice DeShazo. On the second play of the game, DeShazo again attempted a forward pass. This time, however, the ball was intercepted by Tennessee linebacker Tyrone Hines. Hines returned {{the ball to the}} Tech 28-yard line, allowing the Volunteers' offense to begin the game already <b>in</b> <b>scoring</b> <b>position.</b> Tennessee's first play was a run up the middle by James Stewart, who gained three yards. On the second play, Tennessee quarterback Peyton Manning completed a nine-yard pass to wide receiver Nilo Silvan. During the play, Silvan suffered a broken ankle and did not return to the game. Now at the 16-yard line, Tennessee continued its drive with a rush by Stewart, who wasn't able to advance the ball. On the next play, the Volunteers were penalized 10 yards for a block {{in the back of a}} Virginia Tech player. Despite the penalty and an incomplete pass on a subsequent play, Tennessee was able to gain a first down to the five-yard line with a pass from Manning to Joey Kent. Two plays later, the Volunteers scored on a one-yard touchdown run by Stewart. The extra point kick was successful, and Tennessee took a 70 lead with 11:41 remaining in the first quarter.|$|E
25|$|However, Georgia's backs {{also ran}} well. Frank Dudley had a 55-yard {{run for a}} score shortly {{after the start of}} the second quarter, and Roy Estes placed the ball <b>in</b> <b>scoring</b> <b>position</b> in the third with a 52-yard run.|$|E
25|$|Notably, García faced though {{pitching}} {{in the early}} going with the likes of Babe Birrer, José Bracho, Dick Starr, Sandy Ullrich, Roy Welmaker and Lenny Yochim, for name a few. Nevertheless, he delivered rewarding results in the years to come, earning respect as a dangerous hitter with runners <b>in</b> <b>scoring</b> <b>position,</b> particularly during the late innings.|$|E
50|$|In 2015 Latorre {{joined the}} four {{consecutive}} league champion Barcelona after {{the departure of}} some of their key players and quickly established herself as one of their most important players <b>in</b> forward <b>position</b> <b>scoring</b> 9 goals throughout the 2015-2016 Championship mid-season.|$|R
50|$|With 11:43 {{remaining}} in the first half, MSU took over and drove the ball from their own 10-yard line to the Indiana 40. However, a bad shotgun snap ended in a fumble recovery for Indiana. Indiana quickly turned the ball {{back over to the}} Spartans as Vayante Copeland picked off Indiana QB Richard Lagow. MSU's offense could not take advantage and punted the ball back to Indiana. Indiana's offense moved the ball into MSU territory, but sputtered and settled for a 50-yard field goal attempt that was wide right. With 46 second remaining, the Spartan offense could not get <b>in</b> to <b>scoring</b> <b>position</b> and the half ended with MSU leading 7-0.|$|R
50|$|In two-minute matches, {{the three}} robots and human players score points {{by placing the}} inner tubes onto pegs on the goal, or {{around the top of}} the goal. The tubes are {{color-coded}} to identify team ownership. Human players are not allowed onto the field, but they may hand tubes to the robots or throw tubes directly onto the goal. At the end of the match, each tube on the goal is worth one point. Each tube {{on the top of the}} goal will double a team's <b>score.</b> <b>In</b> addition, each vertical row of three tubes on a corner of the goal will double a team's score. The winner of the match is the team with the highest <b>score.</b> <b>In</b> the event of a tie, the team with the highest tube <b>in</b> a <b>scoring</b> <b>position</b> wins.|$|R
25|$|The Husker offense had {{numerous}} opportunities to score in extra innings {{as they had}} base runners <b>in</b> <b>scoring</b> <b>position</b> in the 10th, 11th, 12th, 13th and 15th inning. They even had bases loaded twice during this streak but were unable to push across any runs against a tough Longhorn bullpen. In the 15th inning, the Husker's finally won after an RBI base hit by Austin Darby which scored Tanner Lubach from second base.|$|E
25|$|Having {{only one}} base runner since the third inning, the Red Sox mounted {{a rally in}} the top of the eighth. Bill Buckner led off with a single. Jim Rice {{followed}} with one, and Evans hit a double after that to drive Buckner and Rice in and cut the lead to one. Davey Johnson brought in Jesse Orosco to try and stop the rally with the tying run now <b>in</b> <b>scoring</b> <b>position.</b> Orosco retired Gedman on a lineout, struck Henderson out, and induced a groundout to pinch hitter Don Baylor to strand Evans <b>in</b> <b>scoring</b> <b>position.</b> McNamara brought in Al Nipper, who started and lost Game 4, to pitch the bottom half. Darryl Strawberry led off with a home run to make the score 7-5. Knight singled and advanced to second on a groundout by Dykstra. Santana was intentionally walked to get to the pitcher's spot, and Orosco helped his cause by singling to center to drive in Knight. Steve Crawford then came in to face Wilson and hit him, loading the bases. Backman then grounded into a force retiring Santana, and Hernandez grounded out and ended the inning.|$|E
25|$|Despite a {{ninth inning}} home run from Freeman and two players <b>in</b> <b>scoring</b> <b>position,</b> the Braves lost 3–2 {{in the first}} of three games against the Phillies. After being {{recalled}} from Triple-A Gwinnett, Williams Pérez surrendered one hit in eight innings pitched in a 5–1 victory over the Phillies. Despite a three-run double by Gordon Beckham in the seventh inning, the Braves were unable to capitalize with runners in walk off position in the ninth and fell 7–4 to the Phillies in the 10th.|$|E
5000|$|After the Chicago game, Gilbert {{ranked second}} <b>in</b> <b>scoring</b> <b>in</b> the Big Ten with eight touchdowns and 12 extra point conversions. [...] Interviewed in November 1927, Michigan's first-year head coach Elton Wieman told reporters he [...] "never knew {{two men in}} his life more unconcerned {{in the heat of}} battle than Gilbert and Benny Friedman, last year's Michigan all-American quarterback whom Gilbert succeeded as a forward-passing partner of Beanie Oosterbaan." [...] At the end of the 1927 season, and {{although}} he did not start any games at quarterback, he was selected by the Big Ten Conference coaches as the first-team quarterback for the International News Service (later merged with the United Press into UPI) All-Big Ten team. [...] He was also selected as a first-team All-Big Ten halfback by both Billy Evans and Walter Eckersall. [...] In selecting Gilbert, Eckersall wrote: [...] "Gilbert of Michigan is selected for left halfback. This player {{was one of the best}} punters in the country. His kicks were well placed and put Michigan <b>in</b> <b>scoring</b> <b>positions</b> many times. He was also an accurate place-kicker. He carried the ball well on end runs and off tackle slants, did his share of the blocking and played a strong defensive game." [...] He was also selected as a second-team All-American by the Central Press Association, billed as the [...] "Real" [...] All-American team with selections based on fan input with cooperation from [...] "hundreds of newspapers throughout the country." [...] The United Press and Billy Evans both selected Gilbert as a third-team All-American.|$|R
50|$|With 8 laps remaining, Alonso lapped fourth-placed Jenson Button {{leaving only}} the top three drivers on the lead lap. Alonso crossed the finish line to take his fifth and Renault's sixth win of the season.

Button came <b>in</b> 4th to <b>score</b> BAR's first points of the year, followed by Trulli, Fisichella, Ralf Schumacher and Villeneuve <b>in</b> the point <b>scoring</b> <b>positions.</b>|$|R
50|$|Stopyra {{was picked}} by manager Henri Michel for the squad that competed at the 1986 FIFA World Cup.

25|$|Schiraldi {{returned}} to the mound for the Red Sox {{trying to keep the}} score even and atone for his blown save. After Knight walked, Mookie Wilson laid down a sacrifice bunt that Gedman threw wide of second in an attempt to get Knight, putting the winning run <b>in</b> <b>scoring</b> <b>position</b> with nobody out. This time, the Mets could not get a run in off Schiraldi as Howard Johnson, pinch hitting for Elster, struck out. Mazzilli and Dykstra then flied out for the remaining two outs, sending the game into extra innings.|$|E
25|$|Boston got to Darling early, {{recording}} three {{second inning}} runs. Dwight Evans and Rich Gedman hit {{back to back}} home runs to lead the inning off and with two out, Wade Boggs drove in Dave Henderson with a single for a 3–0 Red Sox lead. Darling did not pitch {{as well as he}} had earlier in the series and was pulled in the fourth inning with two outs and a runner <b>in</b> <b>scoring</b> <b>position.</b> Sid Fernandez came in and after walking Boggs, he was able to retire Marty Barrett on a fly ball to right field. Fernandez then retired the side in order in the fifth and sixth.|$|E
25|$|Nationals closer Sean Doolittle set the Cubs down {{in order}} {{in the top of}} the ninth, and Davis – {{completing}} his longest outing since 2012 – returned to retire Turner, Werth, and Harper in the bottom of the ninth, throwing 44 pitches in his outing, 10 more than he had thrown in any single appearance during the regular season. The season endied on a Harper strikeout on a full count. Despite going 1-for-11 with runners <b>in</b> <b>scoring</b> <b>position</b> and walking nine Nationals hitters, the Cubs won the 4-hour 37-minute game 9-8 and the series 3-2 and advanced to face the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 2017 National League Championship Series.|$|E
25|$|For 2009, it was {{announced}} that Schumacher had extended his contract to drive for Mercedes-Benz, and would move to the HWA Team, and was partnered by Paul di Resta, Bruno Spengler and Gary Paffett.

5|$|The {{game was}} closely fought and was finally {{declared}} a scoreless tie by the referee {{about an hour}} after it began. Navy reportedly never gained possession of the ball. However, the Naval Academy managed to keep the Baltimore Athletic Club from ever being <b>in</b> a <b>scoring</b> <b>position.</b> On three separate occasions, Navy forced Baltimore back into its own end zone for a safety; these were not worth any points until 1882, however, so they offered Navy no benefit. The American and Chronicle reported that Maxwell, Craven, and Sample of Navy gave the strongest performances, but were also reckless in their play and were repeatedly penalized for jumping offside or kicking {{the ball out of}} play, a form of delay of game.|$|R
30|$|To {{complete}} {{our control}} model, {{we need to}} specify an appropriate cost function. While one can contemplate various attractive choices, due to computational issues, we constrain ourselves to the quadratic case. The cost function should capture two aspects. The first one {{is the amount of}} difference <b>in</b> the <b>score</b> <b>position.</b> Explicitly, we do not care too much if the tempo is off as long as the robot can reproduce the correct timing of the beats. Hence, in the cost function, we only take the position difference into account. The second aspect is the smoothness of velocity changes. If abrupt changes in velocity are allowed, the resulting performance would not sound realistic. Therefore, we also introduce a penalty on large control changes.|$|R
25|$|Yomiuri Giants' starter Tetsuya Utsumi and {{relievers}} Scott Mathieson, Tetsuya Yamaguchi and Kentaro Nishimura combined on a nine-hit shutout to {{beat the}} Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles and take one-game lead in the Series. Even though they failed to score in the game, the Eagles had several scoring opportunities. Their leadoff man reached base in six innings and they also ended six innings {{with at least one}} runner <b>in</b> <b>scoring</b> <b>position.</b> Eagles' rookie-starter Takahiro Norimoto performed well, holding the Giants to only four hits through eight and a third innings. The Giants' two runs came from a Hisayoshi Chono RBI-single in the fifth inning and Shuichi Murata's solo homerun {{in the top of the}} eighth. In the bottom half of the inning, Giants' outfielder Yoshiyuki Kamei stopped a potential game-tying play by making an impressive catch at the wall to retire Kazuo Matsui with runners on first and second with two outs.|$|E
25|$|Cardinals clinch NL Central on September 27. The Cardinals {{clinched}} the NL Central title {{at home on}} September 27. It was their first NL Central title since 2009. It was their seventh division title since 2000, thanks to 20 rookies, 12 of them had never before appeared in the majors before this year. They were second three consecutive years prior to 2013. The club has a 16-6 record since Allen Craig was lost {{for the remainder of}} the regular season on September 4, with a foot injury. The club previously lost their ace (Chris Carpenter), their shortstop (Rafael Furcal), and their closer (Jason Motte) before Opening Day, plus two more starting pitchers in May and then cleanup hitter Craig, who has the majors highest batting average (.454) with runners <b>in</b> <b>scoring</b> <b>position.</b> He has been ruled doubtful for the 2013 National League Division Series against the Pittsburgh Pirates, because of his Lisfranc injury to his left foot.|$|E
25|$|The Dodgers {{failed to}} score a run and left eight men on base through five innings.	Ethier, pinch hitting, scored Pederson on a single in the sixth inning for the Dodgers' only run. They only had one hit in 13 chances with runners <b>in</b> <b>scoring</b> <b>position</b> in the game. Kershaw pitched four {{scoreless}} innings of relief in the game, and in the process, he broke Orel Hershiser's Dodgers postseason record with his 33rd strikeout. Morton pitched four innings of relief to earn the win, as Corey Seager grounded out to José Altuve, who threw to Yuli Gurriel to end the game, series, baseball season, and their 55-year drought. The Astros became the third consecutive road team to win a World Series Game 7 {{as well as the}} fourth consecutive team to end a World Series on the road (after the 2014 Giants, 2015 Royals and 2016 Cubs). They also became just the second team to win a seven game League Championship Series and a seven game World Series in the same year, following the 1985 Kansas City Royals.

Replacing the red and white colours of the cigarette giant was the green and red of Italian clothes manufacturer Benetton. Also gone were drivers Andrea de Cesaris and Mauro Baldi, replaced by Riccardo Patrese and Eddie Cheever. The team {{continued to}} use the thirsty, and moderately powerful (...) 890T V8 turbocharged engine for the season. If not for the engine's appalling fuel economy, Patrese and Cheever might well have scored more points and/or podium finishes as both drivers often retired within laps of race finishes while <b>in</b> point <b>scoring</b> <b>positions</b> simply because {{they ran out of}} fuel.

The desired initial option in the offense is to pass to the strong-side post player on the block who is <b>in</b> good <b>scoring</b> <b>position.</b> From there the player has the options of looking to score or pass {{to one of the}} perimeter players who are exchanging from strong-side corner and wing, a dive cut down the lane, or the opposite wing flashing {{to the top of the}} key which initiates another common option known as the [...] "pinch post".|$|R
