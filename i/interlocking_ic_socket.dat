50|$|Zero {{insertion}} force (ZIF) {{is a type}} of <b>IC</b> <b>socket</b> or electrical connector that requires very little force for insertion. With a ZIF <b>socket,</b> before the <b>IC</b> is inserted, a lever or slider {{on the side of the}} socket is moved, pushing all the sprung contacts apart so that the IC can be inserted with very little force - generally the weight of the IC itself is sufficient and no external downward force is required. The lever is then moved back, allowing the contacts to close and grip the pins of the <b>IC.</b> ZIF <b>sockets</b> are much more expensive than standard <b>IC</b> <b>sockets</b> and also tend to take up a larger board area due to the space taken up by the lever mechanism. Therefore they are only used when there is a good reason to do so.|$|R

A methodology was developed for modeling and monitoring contact resistance of electrical interconnects. The technique combined a PoF model with the Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT). In the methodology the resistance behavior is characterized as a function of temperature. The effective a-spot radius was extracted from the characterization data and modeled with a power-law. A PoF model was developed to estimate the resistance of an elastomer contact, based on the effective a-spot radius and the ambient temperature. The methodology was experimentally demonstrated with a temperature cycle test of the elastomer socket. During the evaluation the difference between estimated and observed resistance values were tested with the SPRT. The technique was shown to be very accurate for modeling contact resistance and to be highly sensitive for the detection of resistance degradation. A qualitative reliability model was developed for the mean contact resistance of an elastomer socket, using fundamental material properties and user defined failure criteria. To derive the model, the resistance behavior of contacts under nominal mechanical load was studied as a function of time and temperature. The elastomer contact was shown to have a very complex resistance behavior, which was modeled by multiple statistical distributions. It was shown that elastomer sockets, in spite of experiencing stress relaxation at the macroscale (elastomer), can exhibit decreases in contact resistance, a result of stress redistribution at the microscale (Ag particles), which increases Ag-Ag particle stress and the effective contact area...|$|R

40|$|The {{quadrilateral}} (Quad) socket {{has been}} the socket of choice for the transfemoral since the 1950 s. It was developed {{as a result of}} extensive research work undertaken at the University of California, Berkely and San Francisco {{at the request of the}} veterans administration (VA) in USA following the 2 nd world war. However, these sockets were mainly designed for maimed but otherwise young and fit amputees, and there arose a doubt regarding whether they are also appropriate to be provided to the aged geriatric amputees which consists most of the today's amputee population. Since the 1970 s researchers started to point out the weaknesses of the Quad socket and advocated a newer type of socket which has a bone-locking system by containing the amputee's ischial ramas inside to socket when being worn. This type of socket is called Ischial-ramal containing (<b>IC)</b> <b>socket</b> and there have been many comments heard from researchers and amputees in favour of this newer type of socket This project was designed to provide back up to the possible explanation for these voices to introduce this new type of socket to be more widely available.

Subminiature tubes with long wire leads, introduced in the 1950s, were often soldered directly to printed circuit boards.

50|$|A normal {{integrated}} circuit (<b>IC)</b> <b>socket</b> requires the <b>IC</b> {{to be pushed}} into sprung contacts which then grip by friction. For an IC with hundreds of pins, the total insertion force can be very large (hundreds of newtons), leading to a danger of damage to the device or the circuit board. Also, even with relatively small pin counts, each pin extraction is fairly awkward and carries a significant risk of bending pins, particularly if the person performing the extraction hasn't had much practice or if the board is crowded. Low insertion force (LIF) sockets reduce the issues of insertion and extraction, but because of its lower insertion force than a conventional socket, are likely to produce less reliable connections.|$|R
50|$|The {{primary purpose}} of an {{expansion}} card is to provide or expand on features not offered by the motherboard. For example, the original IBM PC did not have on-board graphics or hard drive capability. In that case, a graphics card and an ST-506 hard disk controller card provided graphics capability and hard drive interface respectively. Some single-board computers made no provision for expansion cards, and may only have provided <b>IC</b> <b>sockets</b> on the board for limited changes or customization. Since reliable multi-pin connectors are relatively costly, some mass-market systems such as home computers had no expansion slots and instead used a card-edge connector {{at the edge of}} the main board, putting the costly matching socket into the cost of the peripheral device.|$|R
50|$|The {{design was}} also simple to modify {{for the sake}} of system {{expansion}} and enhancement. Many different modifications to increase the system clock speed were possible, including some that required nothing more than jumpers (e.g. the 3.5 MHz speed upgrade obtained by jumpering the clock divider, with no software modifications or changes to the ICs on the board.) There was also a minor industry in user-installable system upgrades such as real time clocks, 4 MHz upgrades, double density floppy upgrades, character enhancements for the display (reverse video, blinking, etc.), and the addition of hard disk interfaces such as SASI and SCSI. Most of these upgrades were accomplished through the use of daughter boards that plugged into existing <b>IC</b> <b>sockets</b> on the board, with the original IC either replaced by a more capable IC or placed into a socket on the daughter board.|$|R

The photoacoustic detector mainly consists of a commercially available microphone inside a hermetically sealed, carbon dioxide filled cell. To save space and minimize intensity losses, a novel waveguide is used to direct the LED radiation to the detector. The waveguide simultaneously forms the measuring chamber.

40|$|This study {{reports on}} a {{research}} project that has utilised, for the first time, a hydro-casting technique to create a trans-femoral prosthetic socket. Outcome measurements of the Hydro-Cast (HC) socket were compared with a prosthesis produced by conventional ischial containment (IC) technique. A trans-femoral amputee was provided with two interventions, one copy of the existing prosthesis and one with a Hydro-Cast socket. Outcome measures included: •Dynamic stump/socket interface pressure distribution. (Tekscan™) •Femur movement relative to the socket. (Ultrasound technology) •Full body motion capture and analysis. (Vicon™) Results indicate that sockets produced by both techniques, generated similar dynamic interface pressures. The average pressure of the HC system is more uniform during toe-off/ double support {{compared with that of}} the IC system. No marked differences were observed between the two conditions for any upper or lower body gait parameters or in the temporal and distance parameters. The range of movement of the femur within the HC prosthetic system was considerably less as compared with the IC system. Adherents of the most widely used design philosophies for trans-femoral sockets have described how their approaches influence or control the motion of the femur relative to the stump tissues and the socket. [1, 2] Although a proof of concept study, results indicate the possibility that the HC socket may offer improved medio-lateral stability compared to the <b>IC</b> <b>socket</b> as used by the test subject. This is also highlighted by Kahle [3] who removed different socket elements systematically in a case study examining trans-femoral socket design. The conclusions of this study were significant because it is feasible to produce an acceptable prosthesis with the HC technique.

Hence a 7 segment plus decimal point package will only require nine pins, though commercial products typically contain more pins, and/or spaces where pins would go, in order to match standard <b>IC</b> <b>sockets.</b> Integrated displays also exist, with single or multiple digits. Some of these integrated displays incorporate their own internal decoder, though most do not: each individual LED is brought out to a connecting pin as described.Multiple-digit LED displays as used in pocket calculators and similar devices used multiplexed displays {{to reduce the number of}} I/O pins required to control the display. For example, all the anodes of the A segments of each digit position would be connected together and to a driver circuit pin, while the cathodes of all segments for each digit would be connected. To operate any particular segment of any digit, the controlling integrated circuit would turn on the cathode driver for the selected digit, and the anode drivers for the desired segments; then after a short blanking interval the next digit would be selected and new segments lit, in a sequential fashion. In this manner an eight digit display with seven segments and a decimal point would require only 8 cathode drivers and 8 anode drivers, instead of sixty-four drivers and IC pins. Often in pocket calculators the digit drive lines would be used to scan the keyboard as well, providing further savings; however, pressing multiple keys at once would produce odd results on the multiplexed display.|$|R

There is always a resistance to change, as change creates confusion {{in the minds of}} people, makes them uncomfortable and requires compromises and adjustments in the way people are used to functioning. However, for the advancement of technology, organizations, society and life change is inevitable and will take place sooner or later. This thesis focuses on one such change - change in operational behavior in addressing a new market entry (<b>IC</b> programming <b>socket</b> market) by the semiconductor bum-in socket business unit of ACME Inc. The new market entry is done such that the solutions currently provided in the bum-in market are made to operate in a larger solution space with minimal changes to the product/solution to help maximize profitability of the same. This thesis discusses {{the differences between the two}} semiconductor test markets and the similarities between the solutions offered. Further, applying Paul Carlile's approach of using the Three Lenses approach in analyzing an organization - Strategic, Cultural and Political, the thesis brings out the salient issues in employing the new market entry strategy through an organizational perspective. (cont.) In addition, the thesis discusses some fundamental inventory management techniques and application of the same to the development of an inventory management program. The deployment of 'all customers are not equal, all products are not equal and all service levels are customer-product level dependant' strategy helps in addressing the issues identified by the Three Lenses. Besides the identification of the strategy, the thesis also shows the importance of the implementation phase to the success of the program. Sharing the inventory analysis with the implementation team; identifying the market opportunity and sharing its effect on the top and bottom line with the management team; political influences required to get the team (direct and indirect) on board are the steps that were taken, without which implementation of the new market entry strategy would have seen a different end. On brining the two overarching business principles of organizational behavior and supply chain management together, ACME Inc. now enjoys the benefits of entering a new market with minimal engineering resources. It provides the organization an increase in profitability through product reuse, avoiding high volume manufacturing disruptions, avoiding not on time delivery excursions and a successful entry into a new market. by Santosh Shanbhag.

40|$|Single-phase, utility interfaced, {{isolated}} AC-DC converters {{with power}} f actor correction cover {{a wide range}} of applications such as chargers for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and battery electric vehicles, inverte rs for multiple renewable energy sources (e. g. photovoltaic modules), as well as interfaces for residential DC distribution systems and energy s torage systems. Thereby, bidirectional conversion capability enables the development of smart interactive power networks in which the energy sys tems play an active role in providing different types of support to the grid. Examples are vehicle-to-grid concepts, smart home concepts, AC m icrogrids, and residential DC distribution systems (DC nanogrids). In the presented work, the main objective is to investigate the feasibility and suitability of a single-stage (1 -S) dual active bridge (DAB) AC-DC converter for the realization of the above mentioned bidirect ional energy conversions. Compared to the commonly used dual-stage (2 -S) systems, the 1 -S architecture has the potential to benefit the system p erformance with regard to efficiency, volume (power density), number of components (reliability), weight, and costs, due to the effective omissi on of a complete energy conversion stage. In order to validate the prese nted analyses, a second objective is to realize a state-of-the-art (i. e. regarding efficiency and power density) converter prototype system that is designed {{in order to meet the}} requirements for future, mode 1 compat ible, on-board electric vehicle battery chargers, interfacing a 400 V DC -bus with the single-phase 230 VAC / 50 Hz mains. Compliance with domest <b>ic</b> power <b>sockets</b> results in a nominal (active) AC charging current of 16 Arms and a nominal power of 3. 7 kW. The main challenge to achieve the above objectives lies in addressing the fundamental limitati ons of the existing analyses and circuit implementations of DAB converte rs. These limitations mainly relate to the soft-switching (i. e. by virtu e of zero voltage switching, ZVS) modulation schemes available in litera ture, being especially problematic for DAB converters with large input a nd/or output voltage variations and large power variations, such as is t he case for the 1 -S DAB AC-DC architecture at hand. By means of an intro ductory Chapter (i. e. Chapter 2), the shortcomings in the existing analy ses of DAB converters are highlighted, and the selection of the full bri dge - full bridge (FBFB) DAB implementation as the most suitable candida te for the considered AC-DC converter topology is motivated. The subsequ ent chapters discuss the 1 -S DAB AC-DC converter in detail: Chapter 3 outlines the operating principle of the DAB AC-DC converter. T he exact operating range of the DAB DC-DC converter, as the main buildin g block of the 1 -S AC-DC architecture, is derived, and a control equatio n for the DAB input current is obtained. Furthermore, the steady-state a nalysis of the DAB is presented and commutation inductance(s)  are intr oduced as an essential HF AC-link modification in order to achieve full- operating-range ZVS. Lastly, a novel current-dependent charge-based (C DCB) ZVS verification method is proposed in order to deal with the defic iencies of the existing current-based (CB) and energy-based (EB) ZVS ana lyses; Chapter 4 is devoted to the derivation of full-operating-range ZVS modul ation schemes for the DAB converter. Three different approaches are pres ented, being a numerical approach, an analytical approach, and a semi-an alytical approach, all relying on the CDCB ZVS verification method propo sed in Chapter 3 in order to assure that soft-switching operation with q uasi zero switching losses is obtained within the calculated ZVS regions; In Chapter 5, the main functional elements of the DAB AC-DC prototype co nverter are designed, employing the values for the circuit level variabl es and the ZVS modulation schemes derived in Chapter 4. State-of-the-art design methods/procedures, models for the component losses, and volume models are combined with custom developed (local) optimization algorithm s in order to obtain a high-efficiency and high-power-density converter design that is in compliance with the specified system requirements; In Chapter 6, first a DC-DC system characterization of the prototype sys tem is presented in order to validate the theoretical analyses, i. e. the steady-state converter model and the ZVS analysis outlined in Chapter 3, as well as the CDCB ZVS modulation schemes proposed in Chapter 4. Ther eafter, the results of an AC-DC system characterization are given, allow ing to evaluate the performance of the prototype converter with regard t o the reached efficiency and with regard to the quality of the AC input power. Conversion efficiencies higher than 95 % within the major pa rt of the output power range, with a very flat efficiency curve and thus a high partial-load efficiency, are reported. The peak efficiency is ar ound 96 % and the efficiency at nominal power approximately 95. 6 %. Moreover, a high power density of 2 kW/liter is obtained. From a b rief comparison with several (similar) dual-stage prototype systems foun d in literature, it is clear that the achieved performance is close to t he absolute state-of-the-art; Chapter 7 concludes the presented work and provides an outlook regarding future research in the field of DAB AC-DC converters. nrpages: 332 status: publishe...|$|R
