Similarly, {{his collection}} of millipedes was deposited in the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C., helping to make that museum the world's largest single collection of millipede type specimens—the individual specimens used to describe species.|$|E
5|$|The King Caesar House {{passed to}} Dr. Hermon Carey Bumpus, former {{director}} of the American Museum of Natural <b>History</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> York. Bumpus extensively restored the house which had fallen into some disrepair after the Knapps died. In 1945, Elizabeth Weber-Fulop, an accomplished Austrian painter, purchased the house. Finally, in 1965, the Duxbury Rural and Historical Society purchased the King Caesar House and converted it into a museum dedicated to Duxbury's maritime era. The King Caesar House museum is located at 120 King Caesar Road in Duxbury, Massachusetts.|$|E

5|$|Make Way for Ducklings, {{published}} in 1941, was McCloskey's second book {{and was the}} winner of the Caldecott Medal in 1942. In his acceptance speech, McCloskey explained his motivation for the story. While attending the Vesper George Art School in the early 1930s, he would spend time in the Public Garden feeding the ducks. After some time away, he returned to Boston to paint a mural and created a draft of the book after inspiration from May Massee. To better illustrate the story, McCloskey spent time at the American Museum of Natural <b>History</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> York, visited an ornithologist, and eventually brought home for models six ducklings to live in his studio at 280 West 12th Street, apartment 4C, in New York's West Village.|$|E

5|$|The holotype of Gorgosaurus libratus (NMC 2120) is {{a nearly}} {{complete}} skeleton {{associated with a}} skull, discovered in 1913 by Charles M. Sternberg. This specimen was the first tyrannosaurid found with a complete hand. It {{was found in the}} Dinosaur Park Formation of Alberta and is housed in the Canadian Museum of Nature in Ottawa. Prospectors from the American Museum of Natural <b>History</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> York City were active along the Red Deer River in Alberta at the same time, collecting hundreds of spectacular dinosaur specimens, including four complete G. libratus skulls, three of which were associated with skeletons. Matthew and Brown described four of these specimens in 1923.|$|E
5|$|Barnum Brown and crew, {{working for}} the American Museum of Natural <b>History</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> York, {{collected}} a nearly complete articulated skeleton with a partial skull in 1915. These fossils were {{also found in the}} Dinosaur Park Formation, near Steveville, Alberta. Brown and Erich Maren Schlaikjer compared the finds, and, though they allowed that both specimens were from the same general locality and geological formation, they considered the specimen sufficiently distinct from the holotype to warrant erecting a new species, and described the fossils as Styracosaurus parksi, named in honor of William Parks. Among the differences between the specimens cited by Brown and Schlaikjer were a cheekbone quite different from that of S. albertensis, and smaller tail vertebrae. S. parksi also had a more robust jaw, a shorter dentary, and the frill differed in shape from that of the type species. However, much of the skull consisted of plaster reconstruction, and the original 1937 paper did not illustrate the actual skull bones. It is now accepted as a specimen of S. albertensis.|$|E
5|$|Dinosaur mania was {{exemplified}} by the fierce rivalry between Edward Drinker Cope and Othniel Charles Marsh, both of whom raced {{to be the first}} to find new dinosaurs in what came to be known as the Bone Wars. The feud probably originated when Marsh publicly pointed out that Cope's reconstruction of an Elasmosaurus skeleton was flawed: Cope had inadvertently placed the plesiosaur's head at what should have been the animal's tail end. The fight between the two scientists lasted for over 30 years, ending in 1897 when Cope died after spending his entire fortune on the dinosaur hunt. Marsh 'won' the contest primarily because he was better funded through a relationship with the US Geological Survey. Unfortunately, many valuable dinosaur specimens were damaged or destroyed due to the pair's rough methods: for example, their diggers often used dynamite to unearth bones (a method modern paleontologists would find appalling). Despite their unrefined methods, the contributions of Cope and Marsh to paleontology were vast: Marsh unearthed 86 new species of dinosaur and Cope discovered 56, a total of 142 new species. Cope's collection is now at the American Museum of Natural <b>History</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> York, while Marsh's is on display at the Peabody Museum of Natural History at Yale University.|$|E

5|$|In 1832 he {{was hired}} to teach chemistry, mineralogy, and botany at Bartlett's High School in Utica, New York, and at Fairfield Medical School, {{replacing}} instructors {{who had died in}} mid-term. Agreeing to teach for one year, with a break from August to December 1832, Gray had to cancel his plans for an expedition to Mexico, which at the time included what is now the southwestern United States. Gray first met Torrey in person in September 1832, and they went on an expedition to New Jersey. After completing his teaching assignment in Utica on August1, 1833, Gray became an assistant to Torrey at the College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York City. By this time, Gray was corresponding and trading specimens with botanists not just in America, but also in Asia, Europe, and the Pacific Islands. Gray held a temporary teaching position in 1834 at Hamilton College. Due to funding shortages, in 1835 Gray was obliged to leave his job as Torrey's assistant, and in February or March 1836 became curator and librarian at the Lyceum of Natural <b>History</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> York, now called the New York Academy of Sciences. He had an apartment in their new building in Manhattan. Torrey's attempt to get Gray a job at Princeton University was unsuccessful, as were other attempts to find him a position in science. Despite Gray no longer being his assistant, Torrey and Gray became lifelong friends and colleagues. Torrey's wife, Eliza Torrey, had a profound impact upon Gray in his manners, tastes, habits, and religious life.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, famed dinosaur hunter and {{paleontologist}} Barnum Brown collected the holotype specimen of Sauropelta (AMNH 3032, a partial skeleton) from the Cloverly Formation in Big Horn County, Montana. The locality {{is inside the}} Crow Indian Reservation. Brown also discovered two other specimens (AMNH 3035 and 3036). The latter {{is one of the}} best-preserved nodosaurid skeletons known to science, includes a large amount of in situ armor, and is on display in the American Museum of Natural <b>History</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> York City. AMNH 3035 preserves the cervical armor and most of a skull, missing only the end of the snout. Expeditions in the 1960s led by the equally renowned John Ostrom of Yale University's Peabody Museum of Natural History recovered additional incomplete specimens from the Cloverly. In 1970, Ostrom coined the genus Sauropelta to include remains discovered by both expeditions. Derived from the Greek σαυρος/sauros ('lizard') and πελτε/pelte ('shield'), this name is a reference to its bony armor. Although Ostrom originally named the species S. edwardsi, nomenclaturist George Olshevsky corrected the spelling to S. edwardsorum in 1991 to conform to Latin grammar rules.|$|E
5|$|The Glen Rose Formation {{of central}} Texas {{preserves}} many dinosaur footprints, including large, three-toed theropod prints. The {{most famous of}} these trackways was discovered along the Paluxy River in Dinosaur Valley State Park, a section of which is now on exhibit in the American Museum of Natural <b>History</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> York City, although several other sites around the state have been described in the literature. It is impossible to say what animal made the prints, since no fossil bones {{have been associated with}} the trackways. However, scientists have long considered it likely that the footprints belong to Acrocanthosaurus. A 2001 study compared the Glen Rose footprints to the feet of various large theropods but could not confidently assign them to any particular genus. However, the study noted that the tracks were within the ranges of size and shape expected for Acrocanthosaurus. Because the Glen Rose Formation is close to the Antlers and Twin Mountains Formations in both geographical location and geological age, and the only large theropod known from those formations is Acrocanthosaurus, the study concluded that Acrocanthosaurus was most likely to have made the tracks.|$|E
