50|$|The band's debut <b>EP</b> <b>Vent</b> (2008) {{was very}} well {{received}} on the underground punk circuit, with many publications commending its alternative and progressive approach to punk. Reoccurring band comparisons include Fugazi, At The Drive-In, Hot Snakes and Propagandhi. The band's second EP Halcyon Days was released in conjunction with Manchester record label TNSrecords and generated even more positive reviews. Many commented highly on the EP's raw, retro production and songcraft. Their songs have been included on several international punk compilations.|$|E
50|$|The {{band was}} {{initially}} formed in 2006 {{as a side}} project by Keighley punk rock band Sounds of Swami. The four members wrote some new acoustic-based songs and performed acoustic cover versions of their own songs. They did this to fill lengthy Pub gig slot's whilst raising money to record their debut <b>EP</b> <b>Vent.</b> After sporadic writing and gigging, the band finally detached itself from the Sounds of Swami name and added additional instrumentation to build on its already burgeoning folk and country sound. The band named themselves Foxes Faux, wrote brand new songs and played their first performance at a charity gig in January 2009.|$|E
50|$|In 2008, {{the band}} {{launched}} their own record label Drawing Board Records to release their debut <b>Vent</b> <b>EP</b> (dbr001). They {{chose not to}} pursue a recording contract elsewhere {{in order to keep}} complete control over their early releases until they solidified their overall sound. Their second EP Halcyon Days was also released on the label (dbr002) in conjunction with Manchester record label TNSrecords. They later signed with TNSrecords to release their debut self titled album.|$|R
50|$|The Halcyon Days EP is {{the second}} {{official}} release by the English punk rock band Sounds of Swami. After {{the success of their}} <b>Vent</b> <b>EP,</b> the band began work on their first album. After a positive EP review in an issue of TNS Zine, the Manchester zine started a record label TNSrecords and offered the band a one-off split record deal with two of their roster bands. The band reluctantly declined in favour of saving new songs for the planned album.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Vent</b> <b>EP</b> was {{the first}} {{official}} release by English punk-rock band Sounds of Swami. After several years of recording demos, the band finally entered the studio with Tim Gray (aka TimG) in Manchester. Recorded in two sessions, [...] "Identity Crisis" [...] and [...] "BANK!" [...] were recorded {{in a single day}} in late 2007 after a period of unsuccessful recording at another studio. The unsuccessful recordings were intended to be the band's debut mini-album titled Real to Reel due to the studio's all-analogue setup. After recording the two tracks, the mini album was scrapped and three more tracks were recorded with TimG in early 2008 over two days. Two surviving recordings from the scrapped mini album were added as bonus demos {{on the end of the}} EP. The band decided not to pursue a recording contract and instead released the EP on their own record label Drawing Board Records. The EP gained a lot of positive reviews from the UK's underground punk - rock scene with Beep! Magazine awarding it 5/5, Punktastic.com awarding it 3/5 and various other reputable zines remarking on its alternative and experimental sound. [...] "Identity Crisis" [...] was released on an international punk compilation.|$|R
