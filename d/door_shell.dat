50|$|Fenner {{eventually}} helps Shell escape, {{along with}} Denny and her girlfriend Shaz, however they lose Shaz, who is subsequently caught and returned. Shell and Denny wear wigs to conceal their identities. They {{break into the}} Hollamby residence, and when Sylvia returns home they take her hostage and force her to dress as French maid and serve them cocaine on a tray. When her undertaker husband Bobby returns home, they take him hostage too. They also take the Hollambys' money and Shell wrecks Sylvia's priceless ornaments. Sylvia tries {{to explain to them}} that what she does is just a job and that she doesn't really enjoy tormenting the prisoners. Shell and Denny laugh hysterically at this, knowing that Sylvia loves her job. That night, they tie Bobby and Sylvia up. The next morning, when Shell discovers Bobby has tried to break free, she places him in a coffin in their garage, and forces Sylvia to nail the coffin shut and to pour petrol over it. After tying Sylvia to the garage <b>door,</b> <b>Shell</b> sets the coffin on fire. As the police arrive, Shell and Denny make a run for it in Bobby's hearse. They leave to go to Spain with false passports. After Sylvia eventually returns to works, she receives a phonecall from Shell, impersonating a mattress saleswoman. She asks Sylvia if her husband would prefer to sleep in a black coffin instead. Sylvia becomes terrified as she realises Shell is {{on the other end of}} the phone. The call is traced and Shell and Denny are arrested on a boat, however they make one last escape, and jump into the sea.|$|E

When her {{undertaker}} husband Bobby returns home, they take him hostage too. The pair also take the Hollambys' money and Shell wrecks Sylvia's priceless ornaments. That night, Shell and Denny tie Bobby and Sylvia up, before going to bed together. The next morning, when Shell discovers Bobby has tried to break free, she places him in a coffin in their garage, and forces Sylvia to nail the coffin shut. Shell then begins to pour petrol over the coffin. After tying Sylvia to the garage <b>door,</b> <b>Shell</b> sets the coffin on fire. As the police arrive, Shell and Denny make a run for it in Bobby's hearse. They hide out in former cellmate Crystal's place. Shell overhears Crystal trying to warn Denny about her, so the next morning Shell plants drugs in Crystal's bedroom and calls the police, impersonating a civilian telling them that Crystal helped hide them. They immediately leave and tell Crystal they are going to stay with Shell's auntie Nelly in Scotland - this is lies as they both go to leave for Spain with false passports. Crystal is subsequently arrested and returned to Larkhall. Shell and Denny are not seen again until the last episode of the series, where Shell makes a phone call to Sylvia, impersonating a mattress sales person. She asks Sylvia if her husband would prefer to sleep in a black coffin instead. Sylvia becomes terrified as she realises Shell is {{on the other end of}} the phone. The call is traced and Shell and Denny are arrested on a boat, however they make one last escape, and jump into the sea.|$|E

50|$|The 309 {{had been}} {{conceived}} as Projet C28 {{as a replacement}} for the Talbot Horizon, and as a result its development had been performed by the former Chrysler/Simca wing of PSA. Styling was the responsibility of the former Chrysler-Rootes design studios in Coventry, whilst much of the engineering was done at the Simca site at Poissy in France. The only stipulation from PSA management was that the new car had to use as much existing architecture as possible; hence the use of a stretched Peugeot 205 floorpan and <b>door</b> <b>shells,</b> whilst the Simca engines and transmissions from the Horizon were also carried over.|$|R
5000|$|The 309's {{slightly}} awkward styling (especially {{when compared}} with the 205 and 405 of the same era) was due to the decision to re-use the <b>door</b> <b>shells</b> from the 205. The 309 was also supposed to be differentiated from Peugeot as a Talbot, and was designed [...] "in-house". Other Peugeot cars were designed by the famed Italian design house Pininfarina, up until the introduction of the 206 in 1998. The notched-hatchback design bears an unintentional similarity to the Dodge Shadow and Plymouth Sundance, which were also developed, entirely separately and cut-down from a larger (Chrysler K-Car) platform rather than stretched from a smaller one, to replace the Horizon in North America.|$|R

50|$|Styling was {{up-to-date}} with sharply formed {{edges and}} large rectangular headlights. The front bumper covered only the corners, allowing the grill {{to be much}} more prominent than normal. The roof line terminated behind the large door on each side. Above the rear waistline were a pair of side hinged clam <b>shell</b> <b>doors</b> covering the entire rear section. An integrated roll bar terminated the body work and also formed a place for the clam <b>shell</b> <b>doors</b> to seal. The clam <b>shell</b> <b>doors</b> met each {{in the middle of the}} roof with no centre support. When the doors were raised you could stretch a tent between them. Two adults could sleep in the tent section and another two adults could sleep on the front seats, which could fold down flat. Finally, the rear section included a full width tail gate with a wind-down window nestled under the rear roll bar.|$|R
50|$|The Cadillac Commercial Chassis was {{basically}} a strengthened version of the long-wheelbase Cadillac Series 355 frame and the Series 75 was intended to carry the extra weight of the bodywork, rear deck and cargo area of funeral coaches and ambulances. Specifically designed for professional car use, it used the GM D platform, and {{the rear of the}} Cadillac Commercial Chassis was considerably lower than the passenger car frame, thereby lowering the rear deck height as well for ease of loading and unloading. As shipped from the factory to custom coachbuilders for final assembly, Cadillac's Commercial Chassis typically consisted of the front end sheetmetal with all lighting and trim, dashboard, air conditioning (if specified) and the main road controls. Rear quarter panels and sometimes the front <b>door</b> <b>shells</b> were shipped with the chassis for use in the finished Escalade.Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards in the United States and Canada calling for increased weight ratings as of the 1979 model year spelled the end of automobile-based ambulances {{and the beginning of the}} van and truck-based units seen today throughout North America.|$|R

5000|$|Cadillac {{produced}} what it {{termed a}} [...] "commercial chassis". This was a longer and strengthened {{version of the}} long-wheelbase Fleetwood limousine frame to carry the extra weight of bodywork, rear deck and cargo. Designed for professional car use, {{the rear of the}} Cadillac commercial chassis was considerably lower than the passenger car frame, thereby lowering the rear deck height as well for ease of loading and unloading. They were shipped as incomplete cars to coachbuilders for final assembly. A Cadillac commercial chassis typically consisted of the car's front end sheet metal with lighting and trim, dashboard and controls. Rear quarter panels and sometimes the front <b>door</b> <b>shells</b> were shipped with the chassis for use in the finished coachwork. Today, most hearses are made from converted sedans on stretched wheelbases. The fleet division of Ford Motor Company sells a Lincoln Town Car with a special [...] "hearse package" [...] strictly to coachbuilders. Shipped without rear seat, rear interior trim, rear window or decklid, the hearse package also features a heavy-duty suspension, brakes, charging system and tires and was once offered on a modified Ford Expedition SUV chassis with the Triton V10 truck engine.|$|R

25|$|A 9,378-car run of two-door XJ coupés with a pillarless hardtop body {{called the}} XJ-C was built between 1975 and 1978. The car was {{actually}} launched at the London Motor Show in October 1973, but it subsequently {{became clear that}} it was not ready for production, and the economic troubles unfolding in the western world at this time seem to have reduced further any sense of urgency about producing and selling the cars: it was reported that problems with window sealing delayed production. XJ coupés finally started to emerge from Jaguar show-rooms only some two years later. The coupé was based on the short-wheelbase version of the XJ. The coupé's elongated doors were made out of a lengthened standard XJ front door (the weld seams are clearly visible under the interior panels where two front <b>door</b> <b>shells</b> were grafted together with a single outer skin). A few XJ-Cs were modified by Lynx Cars and Avon into convertibles with a retractable canvas top, but this was not a factory product. Lynx conversions (16 in total) did benefit of powered tops. Both six and twelve-cylinder models were offered, 6,505 of the former and 1,873 of the latter. Even with the delay, these cars suffered from water leaks and wind noise. The delayed introduction, the labour-intensive work required by the modified saloon body, the higher price than the four-door car, and the early demise promulgated by the new XJ-S, all ensured a small production run.|$|R

50|$|Some writers {{believe that}} onycha was the fingernail-like operculum, or trap door, of certain sea snails, {{including}} Strombus lentiginosus, Murex anguliferus, Onyx marinus, and Unguis odoratus. This operculum is the trap <b>door</b> of a <b>shell,</b> {{called by the}} Latins Conchylium. These opercula may be of different sizes, but their overall shape {{is that of a}} claw, which is the origin of the name Unguis odoratus. The name Blatta Byzantina is occasioned by its having usually been imported from Constantinople, the ancient Byzantium. In antiquity the operculum was used as an ingredient in incense. The Baylonian Talmud recorded that onycha was rubbed with an alkali solution prepared from the bitter vetch to remove impurities, it was then soaked in the fermented berry juice of the Caper shrub, or a strong white wine, in order to enhance its fragrance. The operculum was also commonly used as an ingredient in many East Asian incense.|$|R
40|$|Ankara : The Department of Industrial Engineering and the Graduate School of Engineering and Science of Bilkent University, 2012. Thesis (Master's) [...] Bilkent University, 2012. Includes bibliographical references. A car {{passes through}} press, body shell, {{painting}} and assembly stages during its manufacturing process. Due {{to the increased}} competition among car manufacturers, they aim to continuously advance and improve their processes. In this study, we analyze planning operations {{for the production of}} front/back and left/right <b>doors</b> in body <b>shell</b> department of Bursa Oyak-Renault factory and propose heuristic algorithms to improve their planning processes. In this study, we present four different mathematical models and two heuristics approaches which decrease the current costs of the company particularly with respect to inventory carrying and setup perspectives. In the body shell department of the company, there are two parallel manufacturing cells which produces doors to be assembled on the consumption line. The effective planning and scheduling of the jobs on these lines requires solving the problem of integrated machine-scheduling and inventory planning subject to inclusive eligibility constraints and sequence independent setup times with job availability in flexible manufacturing cells of the body shell department. The novelty in the models lie in the integration of inventory planning and production scheduling decisions with the aim of streamlining operations of the door manufacturing cells with the consumption line. One of the proposed heuristic approaches is Rolling Horizon Algorithm (RHA) which divides the planning horizon into sub-intervals and solves the problem by rolling the solutions through sub-intervals. The other proposed algorithm is Two-Pass Algorithm which divides the planning horizon into sub-intervals and solves each sub-problem in each sub-interval to optimality for two times by maintaining the starting and ending inventory levels feasible. These approaches are implemented with Gurobi optimization software and Java programming language and applied within a decision support system that supports daily planning activities.

40|$|Abstract Climate and {{environmental}} issues are of paramount importance. Researchers agree that we must all contribute to a reduction of gases that contribute to climate change. Energy consumption must decrease within all sectors {{and the promotion of}} renewable sources of energy must be introduced. Each sector should aspire to decrease its energy consumption. Energy consumption is strongly linked to waste gases that contribute to climate change. Passive houses {{are a part of the}} construction industry's methods to attain energy conservation. Passive houses are derived from low energy houses and super insulated houses. A passive house is intended to obtain heat from the inhabitants and through their activities. The house is built so that heat losses through the climate <b>shell</b> (<b>doors,</b> windows, walls, floors and ceilings) and the ventilation system are decreased. In order to get a good indoor environment it is important that the ventilation and heat recycling system working together, hold the energy consumption down. This is how faculty people usually present a passive house to someone who has not considered the concept before. I would like to turn the focus from heating to cooling. Houses with large glass facades facing south and a closed climate shell risk too high an indoor temperature. How do we plan houses so that they don’t need a cooling system? Is protection from the sun enough? During the planning of a passive house, efforts are made in order to let the house be dependent on a small heat battery during the coldest parts of the year. My approach to passive houses became an effort to see how solar radiation influences closed and highly insulated units. The heating of houses in my calculations was not influenced to any extent by the rotation of the building. When heating buildings the sun’s radiation only plays a small part. When the sun’s radiation is most concentrated no active heating is required. It is important to note that solar radiation cannot be depended upon at all times especially in winter. Of course, with sun protection, energy needed for heating will increase but energy for cooling will decrease. Sun radiation influences active cooling as shown in my software program. Increased sun radiation requires increased active cooling for alternatives in my study without sun protection. The alternatives with sun protection are not influenced as much by solar radiation as those without. Alternatives with strong sun protections are not as sensetive how the house is placed among the point of the compass. Solar radiation does not become equally considerable and impact to be decreased therefore...|$|R
