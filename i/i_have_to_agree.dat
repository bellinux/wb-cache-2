5000|$|In 1930, {{this was}} perhaps too {{outrageous}} {{even for the}} Bolsheviks. Stalin, not yet dictator, probed his powerful ally Sergo Ordzhonikidze: [...] "Only Molotov, myself, and now {{you are in the}} know.... Is it possible? What a business! Discuss it with Molotov...". However, Sergo would not go that far. There would be no arrest and trial of Tukhachevsky in 1930: the commander [...] "turns out to be 100% clean," [...] Stalin wrote disingenuously to Molotov in October, [...] "That's very good." [...] It is interesting that seven years before the Great Terror, Stalin was testing the same accusations against the same victims--a dress rehearsal for 1937--but he could not get the support. The archives reveal a fascinating sequel: once he understood the ambitious modernity of Tukhachevsky's strategies, Stalin apologised to him: [...] "Now the question has become clearer to me, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> that my remark was too strong and my conclusions were not right at all." ...|$|E
40|$|Integral: {{the word}} means to integrate, to bring together, to join, to link, to embrace. Not {{in the sense}} of uniformity, and not {{in the sense of}} ironing out all the {{wonderful}} differences, colors, zigs and zags of a rainbow-hued humanity, but in the sense of unity indiversity, shared commonalities along with our wonderful differences: replacing rancor with mutual recognition, hostility with respect, inviting everybody into the tent of mutual understanding. Not that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> with everything you say, but I should attempt at least to understand it, for the opposite of mutual understanding is, quite simply, war.

As Paul Simon once sang, “Everything looks worse in black and white. ” Metaphorically speaking, at least, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>agree.</b> When we begin the process of working through a significant artistic change like the movement from grayscale to color in artists’ video works, there is an overambitious temptation to speak in terms of the relations among technology, art practice, institutional policies, and critical discourse for a period of more than a decade. There, in black and white, is the problem. There is simply too much data We also believe that the significant change was the move from analogue to digital video cameras and editing. But as Marshall McLuhan skips over the shift from volumen to codex in the rush to printing, so media-art historians risk missing an essential step in the race to computer generated imaging. The solution in black and white: monochrome, and the arrival of color. Open Acces...|$|E
