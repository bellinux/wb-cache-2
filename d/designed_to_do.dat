5|$|Other {{additions}} {{include the}} Rig and the Anti-Tank; the Rig is {{a modified version}} of an APC from the previous titles modified to be able to build temporary buildings, while the Anti-Tank is both a direct and long-range weapon specifically <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> damage to tanks. Two modifications include the Battleship, which can now move and attack in one round, and the Aircraft Carrier, which can produce low-fuel aircraft called Seaplanes. Another new unit is the Gunship, which can attack and carry units as well. In discussing the online play of the game, the developers felt that it was necessary to limit online battles to only two people per battle, explaining that they felt it would be too boring for a player to have to sit and stare at a screen while three other people made their moves.|$|E

25|$|In the Six-Day War, Sharon, {{in command}} of an armored {{division}} on the Sinai front, drew up his own complex offensive strategy that combined infantry troops, tanks and paratroopers from planes and helicopters to destroy the Egyptian forces Sharon's 38th Division faced when it broke through to the Kusseima-Abu-Ageila fortified area. Sharon's victories and offensive strategy in the Battle of Abu-Ageila led to international commendation by military strategists; he was judged to have inaugurated a new paradigm in operational command. Researchers at the United States Army Training and Doctrine Command studied Sharon's operational planning, concluding that it involved a number of unique innovations. It was a simultaneous attack by a multiplicity of small forces, each with a specific aim, attacking a particular unit in a synergistic Egyptian defense network. As a result, instead of supporting and covering {{each other as they}} were <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> each Egyptian unit was left fighting for its own life.|$|E

500|$|The starfighters {{available}} for use in both modes fall under several roles - space superiority, assault, recon, interceptor and bomber. Each type of craft {{available for}} use and faced in battle, varies in speed, shielding, manoeuvrability, along {{with the number of}} weapon banks available for primary and secondary weapons, with the carrying capacity for secondary weapons also differing. Primary weapons cover guns that varying in damage and firing rate, some specifically <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> damage to either shields, hull, or subsystems, and which drain the energy banks of a starfighter when continuously used. Secondary weapons cover missiles and bombs, with projectiles being of either [...] "dumb-fire", heat-seeking, or aspect-seeking variety. During battles, players can opt to change the primary weapons they are firing (depending on whether the ship has more than one gun mount), as well as switch between firing single or double rounds of the secondary weapons they are carrying. Furthermore, players can, apart from evading missiles locked onto them by skillful manoeuvring, use countermeasures to lose an incoming missile. In single-player, players can not only encounter other starfighters, but also capital ships - from cruiser to destroyers - civilian craft - medical ships, science vessels, transports, freighters and escape pods - stationery turrets, cargo containers, and large space-station installations.|$|E

500|$|John Harold Wilson {{argues that}} the famously virile stage {{presence}} of Hart as Horner {{must be taken into}} account when interpreting the play. As personified by Hart, Horner will have won women not so much through clever trickery as [...] "the old-fashioned way", by being [...] "dangerously attractive", and it is only fools like Sir Jaspar Fidget who really believe him harmless. Harcourt/Kynaston, although by 1675 a well-regarded and skilful actor of male roles, would clearly have been overshadowed by Horner/Hart. The actresses associated with each hero must also have tended to make the Horner plot more striking on the stage than the true-love plot. Horner's primary mistress Lady Fidget, spokeswoman for [...] "the virtuous gang" [...] of secretly sex-hungry town wives, was played by the dynamic Elizabeth Knepp, who Samuel Pepys declared [...] "the most excellent, mad-humoured thing, and sings the noblest I've ever heard", talents that the famous drinking scene in Horner's lodging seems <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> justice to. By contrast, the choice of the bit-part actress Elizabeth James as Alithea would have de-emphasised the Harcourt-Alithea plot. Such historical considerations have made modern critics sceptical of Norman Holland's classic 1959 [...] "right way/wrong way" [...] interpretation of the play, which positions the true-love plot as the most important one.|$|E
