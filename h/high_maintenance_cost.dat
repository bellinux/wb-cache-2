25|$|In 1982, FS retired the ETR 401 from service, due to <b>high</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>cost,</b> and FIAT {{transformed}} it in a train-laboratory, to {{test the}} parts for the successor of the ETR 401, ETR 450. After 1988, the trainset went around Europe to demonstrate the greatness of the tilting revolutionary technology and between 1994 and 2001 it was utilised as a charter train.

50|$|Some public {{transport}} companies have both low floor and high floor trams. They report that low floor trams have 15% <b>higher</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>costs</b> for the rolling stock, and 20% <b>higher</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>costs</b> for the infrastructure on average.

40|$|The <b>maintenance</b> <b>costs</b> of 137 {{residential}} rental {{properties in}} northwestern South Carolina are analyzed. The {{results show that}} <b>maintenance</b> <b>cost</b> per square foot increases with property age, tenant turnover, certain amenities, and for higher-rent properties. Compared to other property types, apartments exhibit <b>higher</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>costs</b> per square foot with larger complexes showing lower per square foot <b>maintenance</b> <b>costs</b> than smaller complexes. This cost economy suggests added value to rental housing for larger complexes. Owners of multiple properties are found to pay <b>higher</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>costs.</b> Finally, there is no observed relationship between absentee ownership {{and the level of}} property maintenance. ...|$|R
25|$|Taj Mahotsav is a {{cultural}} festival that was started in year 1992 and has grown since then. The year 2017 is the 26th year of this Mahotsav. This festival also figures in the calendar of events of the Department of Tourism, Government of India. A large number of Indian and foreign tourists coming to Agra join this festivity {{in the month of}} February(18 to 27). One of the objectives of this craft fair is to provide encouragement to the artisans. It also makes available works of art and craft at reasonable prices that are not inflated by <b>high</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>cost.</b>|$|E
25|$|After {{the advent}} of Islam and Muslim conquests of the 7th and 8th century, the old Mediterranean economy {{collapsed}} and the volume of trade went down drastically. The Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire, neglected to revive overland trade routes but was dependent on keeping the sea lanes open to keep the empire together. Bulk trade fell around 600-750 while the luxury trade increased. Galleys remained in service, but were profitable mainly in the luxury trade, which set off their <b>high</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>cost.</b> In the 10th century, there was {{a sharp increase in}} piracy which resulted in larger ships with more numerous crews. These were mostly built by the growing city-states of Italy which were emerging as the dominant sea powers, including Venice, Genoa and Pisa. Inheriting the Byzantine ship designs, the new merchant galleys were similar dromons, but without any heavy weapons and both faster and wider. They could be manned by crews of up to 1,000 men and were employed in both trade and warfare. A further boost {{to the development of the}} large merchant galleys was the upswing in Western European pilgrims traveling to the Holy Land.|$|E
25|$|Some small {{improvement}} in the financial situation of the company took place over the ensuing years, but the timber viaducts {{had always been a}} liability due to their very <b>high</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>cost,</b> at about £10,000 annually. Replacement of some of them on the grounds of urgent technical need had started in 1871 and was continuing progressively; they were being built of a width suitable for a double narrow gauge line, although for the time being the line was a single broad gauge line. The work was being ordered by the Joint Committee of Management, but in November 1883, the minority Cornwall Railway directors asserted themselves and pointed out that authorising such major works was a matter for the board of directors instead; and the original Cornwall Railway directors were a majority there. The impasse went to arbitration and the arbitrator ruled that {{under the terms of the}} lease, the railway was to be maintained as a broad gauge line. As the ultimate cessation of broad gauge operation was by now plain, this frustrated any practical progress on the reconstructions, and in fact no new viaduct reconstructions were started as long as the Cornwall company remained in existence.|$|E
