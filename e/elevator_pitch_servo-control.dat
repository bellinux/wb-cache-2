Therefore, this study seeks to fill this gap in research by offering entrepreneurs an actual method—or a blueprint—for creating and delivering a successful <b>elevator</b> <b>pitch.</b> ^ This study uses rhetorical-thematic analysis on observational data from 58 successful <b>elevator</b> <b>pitches,</b> chosen by extreme case sampling, from videotaped recordings of the 2008 - 2012 MIT Pitch competitions. The prominent rhetorical features and overarching themes identified are used to construct the blueprint—a method for entrepreneurs to craft and deliver a successful 60 -second <b>elevator</b> <b>pitch.</b> ...|$|R

Moreover, the two control channels interact one with the other meanwhile being submitted to strongly variable and stiff power demand and stochastic disturbance.
