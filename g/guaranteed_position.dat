40|$|In this study, the {{significance}} level of research assistants' professional problems {{was measured with}} the paired comparison method {{within the scope of}} "law of comparative judgment". In this context, research assistants' professional problems are investigated for gender, educational background and type of position. This study was carried out in the form of general survey model. The study group consisted of 555 research assistants working in public or foundation universities which are accredited by the Council of Higher Education in Turkey. The data collection tool is composed of two parts. The first parts asks for demographic information about gender, educational background and type of position while the second part inquires about the 8 professional problems (being directed to non-academic duties, lack of physical equipment, mobbing, foreign language proficiency, lack of <b>guaranteed</b> <b>positions,</b> financial problems, insufficient funds and heavy faculty works) given by the administration. The data was scaled via the third conditional equation on the full data matrix of Thurstone's law of comparative judgment. The results of the study indicated that the most significant problem research assistants face was economic problems. They were followed by mobbing, faculty workload, insufficientfunding, job security, non-academic duties, physical deficiencies and poor foreign language skills respectively. When the research assistants’ problems were analyzed in terms of gender variable, there was a meaningful difference in the scale values of mobbing. In fact, male research assistants puts mobbing in the sixth place while female research assistants regard it as the most important problem. Another variable is the educational background, it {{can be seen from the}} results that the most significant problem of those who have obtained their PhD degrees is lack of <b>guaranteed</b> <b>positions.</b> When research assistants’ problems were examined in terms of type of position, it was found that lack of <b>guaranteed</b> <b>positions</b> is the most important problem for research assistants of 50 /d position...|$|R

5000|$|In After Victory: Institutions, Strategic Restraint, and the Rebuilding of Order after Major Wars, Ikenberry explores how the United States {{utilized}} its hegemony after both World Wars {{to shape}} future world order. In both cases, the U.S. attempted to institutionalize its power {{through the creation}} of a constitutional order, by which political order was organized around agreed-upon legal and political institutions that operate to allocate rights and limit the exercise of power. In the process, the United States agreed to [...] "tame" [...] its power by placing it within institutions and the set of rules and rights with which this came. One of the advantages for the United States in doing so was locking itself into a <b>guaranteed</b> <b>position</b> for years to come. In the event that its power waned in the future, the institutional framework it created would nonetheless remain intact.|$|E
5000|$|Seniority {{does have}} several {{positive}} factors to its name. Individuals may be draws toward specific field or occupation {{with the knowledge}} that seniority is obtainable. If seniority were to be banished as a whole, many higher paid employees would be fired first just because they make more money than their peers. Seniority does an effective job in making sure that people work for the [...] "marathon". It's important to make sure employees are here to stay. Though the principle of seniority does an effective job of protecting long-term employees, it fails to address several critical factors. Firstly, spots secured by seniority casts aside some of the most appealing perspectives. Individuals will become less driven to enter a field that does not reinforce their efforts with employment. Secondly, the security of tenure often encourages mediocrity. Employees {{with the knowledge that}} their spot in the workplace is secured will naturally become less likely to improve their working ethics as they may no longer view improvement as a necessity. Lastly, a system rewarding individuals for their hiring date does not encourage professional growth. If individuals are aware they only have to reach a certain timespan of employment to have a <b>guaranteed</b> <b>position</b> in a company, they will not grow professionally once they have reached their mark.|$|E

40|$|It was a clean sweep this {{semester}} for The University of Notre Dame Australia, Fremantle School of Education with seven students receiving scholarships and awards. Four {{students were given}} $ 12, 000 Country Service Scholarships from the Catholic Education Office (CEO), designed to encourage graduates to teach in rural areas. Only four scholarships are offered to Western Australian tertiary students. Students Gemma Gordon, Amanda De Gooijer, Morgan Schorer and Christine Terrantory received one year’s tuition and living expenses and a <b>guaranteed</b> <b>position</b> in a rural school, provided they spend two years teaching in the country after they graduate. Gemma Gordon, who is planning to move to Kununurra, said she applied for the scholarship {{because she wanted to}} challenge herself and experience something different. “I really think teaching in the country for a few years will open up some great doors and give me better opportunities for when I eventually move back to the city. I am so happy and extremely grateful to the CEO for this chance,” said Ms Gordon. Three more students, Jayson Peacock, Rashini Horsfall and Teneeka Hill, each received a Primary Pre-service Award for Excellence in Science Education and $ 2, 000 from The Department of Education and Science Training (DEST). The Australian Government offers this award to exemplary students who complete in 2007 - as part of their primary, early childhood or middle years teacher education course - one or more science education units. This is done to encourage future primary school teachers to develop competence and confidence in teaching science. Jayson Peacock, who is finishing his Bachelor of Education (Primary) and Bachelor of Biomedical Science this year, said he felt privileged to receive the award. “I was thrilled to receive the award as I saw it as being recognition of the five years I have put into my degrees. I am passionate about science and love teaching it. It is great to see that the government is trying to increase the status of science teaching in primary schools and create more jobs for science specialists,” said Mr Peacock...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1992 A new {{decentralized}} nonlinear controller for Robot Manipulators {{is presented}} in this thesis.

The main contribution of this thesis is that it extends the results of a class of complex centralized control algorithms to the decentralized robust control of interconnected nonlinear subsystems like robot manipulators...|$|R
