25|$|The world’s first high-sensitivity <b>earth</b> <b>leakage</b> {{protection}} system (i.e. a system capable of protecting {{people from the}} hazards of direct contact between a live conductor and earth), was a second-harmonic magnetic amplifier core-balance system, known as the magamp, developed in South Africa by Henri Rubin. Electrical hazards were of great concern in South African gold mines, and Rubin, an engineer at the company C.J. Fuchs Electrical Industries of Alberton Johannesburg, initially developed a cold-cathode system in 1955 which operated at 525 V and had a tripping sensitivity of 250 mA. Prior to this, core balance <b>earth</b> <b>leakage</b> {{protection system}}s operated at sensitivities of about 10 A.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} that he worked on the magamp, Rubin also {{considered}} using transistors in this application, but concluded that the early transistors then available were too unreliable. However, with the advent of improved transistors, the company that he worked for and other companies later produced transistorized versions of <b>earth</b> <b>leakage</b> protection.|$|E
40|$|Electrocardiographic (ECG) {{artifacts}} {{may arise}} due to interference, faulty <b>earthing,</b> and current <b>leakages</b> in biomedical equipment which might create clinical dilemmas in the perioperative settings. Piezoelectric signals generated by ultrasonography probe are another uncommon source {{which might be}} sensed by the ECG electrodes and produce tracings similar to pathological arrhythmias triggering false alarms and avoidable therapies. Anesthesiologists should be familiar with these uncommon sources which might produce these artifacts {{and they should be}} identified swiftly...|$|R
40|$|A global magnetospheric {{model is}} {{described}} {{with a single}} subsolar merging line whose position is determined neither locally by the relative orientations and strengths of the merging fields nor globally by the orientation of a separator line (the governing parameters of most previous models) but by the condition of tangential contact between the external field and the magnetopause. Attention {{is given to the}} case of finite leakage and partial penetration, which distort the IMF into a draped pattern, thus changing the locus of tangency to the sphere. In the special case where the penetrating IMF flux is balanced by an equal amount of <b>earth</b> flux <b>leakage,</b> the tangent merging line bisects the angle between the IMF and earth's northward subsolar field. This result is identical to the local merging line model result for merging fields with equal magnitude. Here, a global flux balance condition replaces the local equal magnitude condition...|$|R
40|$|A {{thermometry}} {{system for}} use during ultrasound hyperthermia treatments {{was developed to}} provide fast and reliable temperature measurements such that transient temperatures from multi-sensor thermocouples could be measured. It was also intended to provide electrical isolation for patient safety when bare thermocouple sensors were used {{in order to reduce}} artifacts. The system hardware development involved fabrication of a high precision temperature measurement box which was electrically isolated from, by an opto-isolation unit, and interfaced with, an 386 - 20 MHz personal computer. The system software development involved a two point calibration program for each thermocouple probe to be used with the system, and a sensor locating program to rapidly identify the probe locations immediately prior to treatment. A single scan temperature reading speed of 0. 2 sec for all 112 thermocouple sensors with an average accuracy of ± 0. 05 °C under normal operating conditions (ambient temperature 22 °C to 28 °C) was achieved. A probe to <b>earth</b> ground <b>leakage</b> sink current of 75 μA and a leakage source current of less than 10 μA was attained...|$|R

To use mode 1, the electrical installation must comply with the safety regulations and must have an earthing system, a circuit breaker to protect against overload and an <b>earth</b> <b>leakage</b> protection. The sockets have blanking devices to prevent accidental contacts.|$|E

40|$|The {{benefits}} of energetic-particle measurements {{in the study}} of magnetospheric physics are reviewed, including the particles' relative ease of detection, their high rectilinear speed, their range of gyroradii, and their immunity to large-scale electric fields. With such particles, it is possible to observationally separate distinctive plasma regions, uniquely assess field-line topologies, examine connectivity from the magnetospheric equator to the ionosphere, and sense global changes in magnetospheric configuration. Multipoint measurements of energetic particles have contributed substantially {{to the understanding of the}} <b>earth</b> magnetopause, the <b>leakage</b> of particles into the upstream region, the effect of sudden storm compressions, the global nature of substorm dynamics, and the location and character of high-energy acceleration processes...|$|R
5000|$|In {{order to}} sample the radio {{signature}} of Earth from an external site and thus test whether TV broadcasting {{is in fact the}} principal component, Sullivan and S. H. Knowles used the Moon as a passive reflector of <b>Earth's</b> radio frequency <b>leakage.</b> Using the 305-m Arecibo radio telescope, a wide range of frequencies were scanned between 100 and 400 MHz. After local interference was eliminated (using an on-Moon, off-Moon technique), the frequencies of most observed signals could be identified with the television AM video carriers of various nationalities. This experiment demonstrated that the lunar surface is capable of reflecting terrestrial band III (175-230 MHz) television signals. https://history.nasa.gov/CP-2156/ch5.4.htm ...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects and}} {{prevention}} of possible mercury pollution from the failure of solar electric propulsion spacecraft using mercury propellant were studied from tankage loading of post launch trajector injection. During preflight operations and initial flight mode there is little danger of mercury pollution if proper safety precautions are taken. Any spillage on the loading, mating, transportation, or launch pad areas is obvious and can be removed by vacuum cleaning soil and chemical fixing. Mercury spilled on Cape Kennedy ground soil will be chemically complexed and retained by the sandstone subsoil. A cover layer of sand or gravel on spilled mercury which has settled {{to the bottom of}} a water body adjacent to the system operation will control and eliminate the formation of toxic organic mercurials. Mercury released into the <b>earth's</b> atmosphere through <b>leakage</b> of a fireball will be diffused to low concentration levels. However, gas phase reactions of mercury with ozone could cause a local ozone depletion and result in serious ecological hazards...|$|R

40|$|Today, the {{analysis}} of the Earth’s time-variable gravity field {{plays a key role in}} Earth system research. The GRACE observables provide an almost direct measurement of the mass that is redistributed at or near the surface of the planet. Yet, important questions such as closing the sea level budget from GRACE, altimetry and steric data still pose a challenge, even after 9 years of GRACE. Promising approaches have been developed that combine multisensor data and/or model output, e. g. to estimate ocean warming/cooling, calibrate hydrological models or to improve geo-centre motion estimates. However, in the view of the authors, the biggest challenge in climate applications such as sea level studies is the problem of signal separation. This problem involves separating signal and noise stemming from the measurement systems and/or background modelling, as well as separating mass flux patterns originating from different or the same compartments of the <b>Earth</b> system (the <b>leakage</b> problem in ice sheet mass balance from GRACE, sea level rise partitioning, teleconnections in the hydrological cycle, trends in continental hydrology vs. GIA). Here we will first review the state of the art in addressing the signal separation problem after 10 years of GRACE. Then, we will discuss the potential of a number of candidate schemes for future gravity missions that were investigated in the recent ESA-funded Next Generation Gravity Mission (NG 2) study...|$|R
40|$|In {{general the}} energy of the seismic coda becomes uniformlydistributed in space at some late lapse time, a fact thatis used for example in the coda {{normalization}} method. Somerecent observations at strato volcanoes, on the contrary,indicate an abnormal spatial concentration of coda energyin the summit regions of these volcanoes. This observedcoda localization {{can be explained by the}} leakage of energyfrom the strongly scattering volcanic edifice into the muchmore homogeneous underlying <b>earth</b> crust. The <b>leakage</b> resultsin an inhomogeneous distribution of energy in space, wherethe energy is low near the volcano-crust boundary and largeinside the strongly scattering volcano far from that boundary. We present two models for this observation: The first one isbased on an analytical solution of the diffusion equationfor a scattering cylinder (representing the volcano) embeddedin a homogeneous half-space (representing the surroundingcrust). The second model is based on a Monte-Carlo simulationof the acoustic equation of radiative transfer. In thissimulation we take into account multiple scattering insidethe volcanic edifice as well as leakage at the bottom of thevolcano into the less heterogeneous crust. Additionally, inthis model we also consider the true topography of the volcanoby simulating reflections at the free surface, where we use adigital elevation model of the volcano and the Kirchhofftangent plane method. Both models can explain the observedcoda localization. We compare theoretical seismogram envelopesof both models to data of shallow volcano-tectonic earthquakespreceding the 1998 eruption of Merapi volcano (Indonesia) ...|$|R

2500|$|A {{residual-current device}} (RCD), or {{residual-current circuit breaker}} (RCCB), is a device that {{instantly}} breaks an electric circuit to prevent serious harm from an ongoing electric shock. Injury may still occur in some cases, for example if a human falls after receiving a shock. In the United States and Canada, the device is more commonly known as a {{ground fault circuit interrupter}} (GFCI), ground fault interrupter (GFI) or an appliance leakage current interrupter (ALCI). In the United Kingdom, these are better known by their initials RCD, and a combined RCD+MCB (miniature circuit breaker) is known as a RCBO (residual-current circuit breaker with overcurrent protection). In Australia, they are sometimes known as safety switches or an RCD. An <b>earth</b> <b>leakage</b> circuit breaker (ELCB) may be a residual-current device, although an older type of voltage-operated <b>earth</b> <b>leakage</b> circuit breaker also exists.|$|E
2500|$|Following the {{accidental}} electrocution {{of a woman}} in a domestic accident at the Stilfontein gold mining village near Johannesburg, a few hundred F.W.J. 20 mA magamp <b>earth</b> <b>leakage</b> protection units were installed in the homes of the mining village during 1957 and 1958.

2500|$|The {{previous}} 16th Edition of the IEE Electrical Wiring Regulations required use of RCDs for {{socket outlets}} that were {{liable to be}} used by outdoor appliances. Normal practice in domestic installations [...] was to use a single RCD to cover all the circuits requiring RCD protection (typically sockets and showers) but to have some circuits (typically lighting) not RCD protected. This was to avoid a potentially dangerous loss of lighting should the RCD trip. Protection arrangements for other circuits varied. To implement this arrangement it was common to install a consumer unit incorporating an RCD in what is known as a split load configuration, where one group of circuit breakers is supplied direct from the main switch (or time delay RCD {{in the case of a}} TT earth) and a second group of circuits is supplied via the RCD. This arrangement had the recognised problems that cumulative <b>earth</b> <b>leakage</b> currents from the normal operation of many items of equipment could cause spurious tripping of the RCD, and that tripping of the RCD would disconnect power from all the protected circuits.|$|E

In the industrial applications, <b>Earth</b> <b>leakage</b> relays are used with separate CT(current transformer) called CBCT(core balanced current transformer) which sense leakage current(zero phase sequence current) of the system through the secondary of the CBCT and this operates the relay.
