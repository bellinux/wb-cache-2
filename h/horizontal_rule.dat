40|$|Analysis of {{handwritten}} document {{images is}} one of the key areas of research in image processing domain. The objective of the analysis is to recognize the text components in an image and extract the intended information. However, inscription of handwriting usually would be on documents with rule lines, since they act as guide lines to the writer to ensure the writing remains straight and is of uniform size. These lines make the task of recognition difficult and hence removing them automatically becomes a major issue in text image processing. To accomplish this objective, an attempt is being made in this paper to remove the <b>horizontal</b> <b>rule</b> lines and vertical margin line for efficient recognition and analysis of the foreground text. Using mathematical morphology, predominant horizontal and vertical lines are removed leaving out stray lines which hinder the further processing of text. The stray lines are identified and removed using entropy with sliding window based on dynamic thresholding...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} current WTO rules concerning telecommunications services. It {{includes an}} explanation {{of the structure of the}} GATS, its Annex on Telecommunications, and the Agreement on Basic Telecommunication Services. As discussed in the previous chapter, the latter reflects the commitments of sixty-nine countries that agreed to open their markets to foreign basic telecommunication services and to foreign suppliers of these services. It also contains additional rules which are linked to these commitments and are assembled under the so-called ‘Reference Paper’. The GATT is relevant in relation to equipment and terminals used to convey and receive telecommunications signals. This, however, constitutes a different line of trade, which is discussed in Chapter 9 of this book. he GATS, similarly to the GATT, aims at protecting equality of competitive opportunities for companies in domestic markets regardless of their origin and the origin of their services. It aims at facilitating progressive liberalisation of services while enabling WTO Members to regulate them “in order to meet national policy objectives”. The GATS thus constitutes the framework agreement relevant to all services and particularly those that, like telecommunication services, have been or are being liberalised. n contrast with the GATT, the GATS contains a mix of horizontal commitments applicable to all services and service suppliers and sectorbased commitments only applicable to those sectors which have been explicitly open to trade by WTO Members. <b>Horizontal</b> <b>rules</b> apply to all measures by Members affecting trade in services. There are no limits in the scope of services except those supplied on a non-commercial basis or outside any form of competition, such as national security or justice.

40|$|In {{developing}} an information system, software specification {{is one of}} the common activities to any system development methodologies. A software model is among the ways to specify software functionalities and constraints. It is constructed as a way to understand the software prior to actually building or modifying it, and it can help in reducing defect density in the software design. In an object oriented based development, Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a famous language used for visualising, capturing and documenting software requirements. Currently, UML has a set of fourteen (14) diagrams that permits modellers to describe different aspects of a system. Each diagram comprises of graphical notations that adhered to UML elements. These situations rendered UML model vulnerable to consistency problems where two or more overlapping elements of different diagrams are not jointly satisfiable. Even though the research in consistency between UML diagrams is rapidly increased, there is still lack of researches of consistency based on use case in use case diagram. UML consistency management is becoming a difficult task because UML itself lacks of formal syntax and semantics and current approaches using simplified version of UML make their approaches hard to implement in CASE (Computer-aided Software Engineering) tool environment. Due to those problems, this research introduces formal syntactical rules to UML elements of four (4) most popular UML diagrams used by UML practitioners: use case diagram, activity diagram, sequence diagram and class diagram. Referring to the formal syntactical rules for UML elements, formal <b>horizontal</b> consistency <b>rules</b> based on use case are also specified. The formal specifications introduced in this research are using logical approach. Based on the syntactical and <b>horizontal</b> consistency <b>rules,</b> UML Checker is implemented in the CASE tool environment. Then, the UML Checker is validated by using UML model of Lecture Assessment System (LAS) as a case study. It shows that the UML Checker can detect inconsistencies between four (4) UML diagrams in the UML model and guide software modeller to correct them...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, a {{statistical}} framework for semantic parsing is described. The statistical model uses two information sources to disambiguate between rules: rule weights that capture ver-tical {{relationships in the}} parse tree, and concept -grams that capture <b>horizontal</b> relationships. <b>Rule</b> design consists of sim-ple local mapping rules that non-experts can write, and the rules are implemented as weighted finite state transducers. A general parser for context free grammars is implemented using a finite state machine library. Semantic decoding is im-plemented by recursively composing the rule transducer with the word-graph automaton produced from the speech recog-nizer. Detailed metrics for evaluating semantic parse accuracy are proposed. The parser is evaluated on the ATIS travel task with resulting precision and recall rates of over 95 %. The proposed finite state transducer formulation allows the incor-poration of rules and probabilities in a unified framework and the straightforward combination of acoustic, language, and understanding models. 1...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{reviews the}} {{well-known}} formalisations for ice and sand piles, {{based on a}} finite sequence of non-negative integers and its recent extension to signed partitions, i. e. sequences of a non-negative and a non-positive part of integers, both non increasing. The ice pile model {{can be interpreted as}} a discrete time dynamical system under the action of a vertical and a <b>horizontal</b> evolution <b>rule,</b> whereas the sand pile model is characterized by the unique action of the vertical rule. The signed partition extension, besides these two dynamical evolution rules, also takes into account an annihilation rule at the boundary region between the non-negative and the non-positive regions. We provide an original physical interpretation of this model as a p-n junction of two semiconductors. Moreover, we show how the sand pile extension of the signed partition environment can be formalized by mean of a non-uniform cellular automaton (CA) since the vertical and the annihilation evolution rules have the formal description of two CA local rules. Finally, we provide a similar construction for the ice pile extension...|$|R

40|$|Traditional {{accounts}} {{of international law}} in domestic courts focus on the distinction between monist and dualist legal systems. In monist systems, courts apply international law directly. In dualist systems, direct application is not an option, so courts apply international law indirectly, or not at all. Although this account is formally correct, it tells us {{very little about the}} functional role of domestic courts in the international legal system. In this chapter, we present a functional account that focuses on the distinctions among horizontal, vertical, and transnational legal obligations. Modern international law regulates horizontal relationships between states, vertical relationships between states and private parties, and transnational relationships between private parties whose interactions cross state lines. The role of domestic courts in interpreting and applying international law varies greatly, depending on whether the international rule at issue is horizontal, vertical, or transnational. We demonstrate in this chapter that the willingness (or ability) of courts to apply international law—that is, the decision that a particular issue is “legal” as opposed to “political”—depends heavily {{on the nature of the}} international legal rule. Domestic courts rarely interpret or apply <b>horizontal</b> <b>rules.</b> Indeed, they often refer to treaties that regulate solely the horizontal relationship between states as “political” in nature. As a result, implementation of horizontal obligations typically involves executive, not judicial action. This is true for both monist and dualist states. In contrast, domestic courts routinely interpret and apply transnational rules, and executive branch officials play little or no role in implementing such rules. (Purely private law treaties such as the Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods provide a clear example.) Again, this is true for both monist and dualist states. It is more difficult to generalize about the role of domestic courts in interpreting and applying vertical rules, such as human rights treaties. However, the classic monist-dualist distinction does a poor job of explaining why domestic courts in some countries apply vertical rules aggressively, while domestic courts in other countries are reluctant to apply vertical (international) rules to regulate the conduct of government officers. It is in this dimension, therefore, that we seek to draw special insights into how particular political relationships may affect the willingness of domestic courts to implement international law in domestic law, and to effect legal change on their own initiative. This chapter draws on materials from approximately two dozen countries to present an account of the role of domestic courts in interpreting and applying horizontal, transnational, and vertical international legal rules...|$|R

30|$|In {{the next}} step, {{a set of}} {{elementary}} periodic patterns was passed through the procedures that apply first the vertical and <b>horizontal</b> extension <b>rules</b> to derive periodic patterns that expand over the longer period of time. Later on, a composition rule {{was applied to the}} results of extensions to reduce the total number of periodic patterns and to derive the periodic patterns with longer sequences of multisets T. At this stage, the application the vertical extension and composition rules created the non-elementary periodic patterns. The horizontal and vertical split rules were used to adjust the parameters of periodic patterns such that extension and composition rules could be applied. The new periodic patterns obtained from the application of the derivation rules were appended to a set of periodic patterns such that they could be used in the next applications of extensions and compositions. The periodic patterns created into a single periodic patterns were removed from a set of periodic patterns such that the set always represents the same workload trace. A negative side effect of split operation was the “left-overs” which consisted of single processing of syntax trees not covered by the present collection of periodic patterns and saved in a “trash” workload trace. A collection of periodic patterns obtained from the derivations and the contents of “trash” workload trace were equivalent to the original workload trace.|$|R

The association rule mining is a process of finding correlation among the items involved in different transactions. Traditionally association rule mining is implemented horizontally.

Recently we have a new method in association rule mining which generates vertical association <b>rules.</b> In <b>horizontal</b> association <b>rule</b> mining we read transaction items record by record basis and computes support of each frequent item or candidate item.
