They {{played a key}} role in {{collective}} political <b>defiance</b> <b>of</b> the Bourbon restoration monarchy in 1815–1830. People from different walks of life and areas of France, particularly Napoleonic veterans, drew on the Napoleonic legacy and its connections with the ideals of the 1789 revolution.|$|E
5|$|In 1903, the Russian {{government}} {{issued an}} edict to confiscate {{the properties of}} the Armenian Church, including the treasures of Etchmiadzin.

5|$|In 1956 Kim started Kim Ki-young Productions, {{and began}} making melodramas, {{the most popular}} film genre in South Korea at the time. His first {{independent}} production was Touch-Me-Not (1956). In 1957, Kim was living near the red-light district of Yongsan, and the atmosphere of this neighborhood influenced his films, A Woman's War and Twilight Train (both 1957). With First Snow (1958), Kim moved from melodrama to a more socially conscious realism. <b>Defiance</b> <b>of</b> a Teenager (1959) and Sad Pastorale (1960) followed in this style. <b>Defiance</b> <b>of</b> a Teenager was one of Kim's most successful and respected early works, and he attended the San Francisco International Film Festival in 1960 for a showing of this film.|$|E

5|$|The Tilhas Tizig Gesheften, a {{small group}} formed from the British Army's Jewish Brigade, {{obtained}} a supply of counterfeit pounds from Jaacov Levy, one of Schwend's money-laundering agents.

5|$|The {{government}} {{account of}} the incident indicated that police, using a megaphone, had ordered protesters to evacuate the area and that some had done so, whereas others remained in <b>defiance</b> <b>of</b> the law. It added that police only intervened after exhausting all opportunities for dialogue and that lethal shots were fired only at armed protesters who attacked police officers. Security forces reported finding pistols, bullets, large quantities of knives, daggers, swords and other sharp objects, as well as Hezbollah flags at the site.|$|E
5|$|Although the Junta of Seville was defeated, {{a new one}} {{was created}} afterwards, the Regency Council. The Primera Junta did not swear loyalty to it, but the Royal Audiencia did so in <b>defiance</b> <b>of</b> the local authority. The Junta summoned them, along with former viceroy Cisneros, and exiled them to Spain with the pretext {{that there was a}} threat to their lives. The Junta {{appointed}} new members for the Audiencia loyal to the revolution. Moreno wrote in the Gazeta that the Audiencia attacked the good faith of the government, and that the Junta left their usual moderation {{for the safety of the}} people.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the end of}} the year, Gaveston had {{returned}} to England, and civil war appeared imminent. In May 1312, Gaveston was taken captive by the Earl of Pembroke, but Warwick and Lancaster had him abducted and executed after a mock trial. This affront to Pembroke’s honour drove him irrevocably into the camp of the king, and thereby split the opposition. The brutality of the act initially drove Lancaster and his adherents away from the centre of power, but the Battle of Bannockburn, in June 1314, returned the initiative. Edward was humiliated by his disastrous defeat, while Lancaster and Warwick had not taken part in the campaign, claiming that it was carried out without the consent of the baronage, and as such in <b>defiance</b> <b>of</b> the Ordinances.|$|E
60|$|Marguerite having {{realized}} her mistake, ashamed of having betrayed her feelings {{even for a}} moment, threw back her proud head and gave her exultant foe a look <b>of</b> <b>defiance</b> and <b>of</b> scorn.

5|$|Between 1594 and 1603, Elizabeth {{faced her}} most severe test in Ireland during the Nine Years' War, a revolt {{that took place}} at the height of {{hostilities}} with Spain, who backed the rebel leader, Hugh O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone. In spring 1599, Elizabeth sent Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, to put the revolt down. To her frustration, he made little progress and returned to England in <b>defiance</b> <b>of</b> her orders. He was replaced by Charles Blount, Lord Mountjoy, who took three years to defeat the rebels. O'Neill finally surrendered in 1603, a few days after Elizabeth's death. Soon afterwards, a peace treaty was signed between England and Spain.|$|E
5|$|Both {{halves of}} the road trace their origins to {{the early days of}} Aspen's {{settlement}} in the 1880s during the Colorado Silver Boom. Prospectors who had missed out on the earlier mining boom that built Leadville began to head west, drawn by reports of vast untapped silver deposits in the Roaring Fork Valley just beyond the Continental Divide. They began crossing what was then known as Hunter Pass, in <b>defiance</b> <b>of</b> an order from Governor Frederick Walker Pitkin not to do so until the federal government had negotiated a peace treaty with the Ute people.|$|E
5|$|But the Parthian Empire, {{weakened}} by internal strife and wars with Rome, {{was soon to}} be followed by the Sassanid Empire. Indeed, shortly afterward, Ardashir I, the local Iranian ruler of Persis (modern Fars Province, Iran) from Estakhr began subjugating the surrounding territories in <b>defiance</b> <b>of</b> Arsacid rule. He confronted Artabanus V at the Battle of Hormozdgān on 28 April 224AD, perhaps at a site near Isfahan, defeating him and establishing the Sassanid Empire. There is evidence, however, that suggests Vologases VI continued to mint coins at Seleucia as late as 228AD.|$|E

The terrible affront must have taken her completely unawares, but now that it had come, she instantly guessed its cause. Nevertheless there was nothing daunted or bashful about her attitude. The colour blazed into her cheeks, and her fine dark eyes responded to Lydie's scornful glance with one <b>of</b> <b>defiance</b> and <b>of</b> hate.|$|R
5|$|Cleveland's <b>defiance</b> <b>of</b> {{political}} corruption won him popular acclaim, and the enmity of the influential Tammany Hall organization in New York City. Tammany, under its boss, John Kelly, had disapproved of Cleveland's nomination as governor, and their resistance intensified after Cleveland openly opposed and prevented the re-election of their point {{man in the}} State Senate, Thomas F. Grady. Cleveland also steadfastly opposed nominees of the Tammanyites, as well as bills passed {{as a result of}} their deal making. The loss of Tammany's support was offset by the support of Theodore Roosevelt and other reform-minded Republicans who helped Cleveland to pass several laws reforming municipal governments.|$|E
5|$|Four locals {{had been}} {{identified}} by the committee as witnessing Cornfoot being killed and being involved in her mistreatment although the three main perpetrators, who had by then left the area, were an Orcadian, a man from Burntisland and a Sea captain's son. A schoolboy, two Englishmen and another person were also implicated but had absconded. The committee determined that Bailie Cook, whose residence the mob had seized Cornfoot from, should carry {{a significant amount of}} the blame. Four males suspected of being present at the murder were held in custody but were released by Cowper in <b>defiance</b> <b>of</b> the Privy Council's instruction for them to be taken to Edinburgh for trial.|$|E
5|$|Heraclius offered {{peace to}} Khosrow, presumably in 624, {{threatening}} otherwise to invade Persia, but Khosrow rejected the offer. On March 25, 624, Heraclius left Constantinople {{to attack the}} Persian heartland. He willingly abandoned any attempt to secure his rear or his communications with the sea, marching through Armenia and modern Azerbaijan to assault the core Persian lands directly. According to Walter Kaegi, Heraclius led an army {{of no more than}} 40,000, and most likely between 20,00024,000. Before journeying to the Caucasus, he recovered Caesarea, in <b>defiance</b> <b>of</b> the earlier letter that Khosrow had sent him.|$|E
