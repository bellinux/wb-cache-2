5|$|For long-distance <b>holiday</b> <b>traffic</b> {{travelling}} {{through the}} county to and from Devon and Cornwall, Somerset is often regarded as a marker on the journey. North–south traffic moves through the county via the M5 Motorway. Traffic {{to and from the}} east travels either via the A303 road, or the M4 Motorway, which runs east–west, crossing the M5 just beyond the northern limits of the county.|$|E
5|$|Opened {{as part of}} {{an attempt}} to {{encourage}} <b>holiday</b> <b>traffic</b> on the line, the halt primarily served golfers at the nearby Royal Cromer Golf Club. The station facilities were very basic, consisting of no more than a single wooden platform, which cost £170 to build, two wooden benches and running in board together with the obligatory oil lamps. No shelter was provided for passengers and the platform was constructed of sleepers and supported by wooden trestles.|$|E
5|$|The 1920s {{also saw}} an upsurge in <b>holiday</b> <b>traffic,</b> as Britain {{recovered}} from the war and tourism gained in popularity. The Talyllyn saw summer passenger numbers grow significantly and regularly had to supplement its formal passenger stock with slate wagons fitted with planks as seats. An unusual tourist service offered by the railway was to hire a slate wagon, which would be left at Abergynolwyn. At {{the end of the}} day the tourists would return to Tywyn in the wagon, powered by gravity. This service was discontinued in the early 1930s. The additional income from the tourist trade defrayed some of the costs of operating the railway, but never enough for it to make a profit during Haydn Jones' ownership.|$|E

25|$|The A21 is a {{trunk road}} in Southern England, {{one of several}} which connect London and various {{commuter}} towns to the south coast. It provides a link to Hastings, East Sussex and parts of Kent. Half of the distance covered is over gently undulating terrain, with some hills and bends. Often traffic is slow-moving, particularly on weekdays on the single carriageway stretches; and in summer with <b>holiday</b> <b>traffic.</b>|$|E
50|$|Major new {{investment}} in infrastructure {{did not go}} ahead substantially until after 1955. The earliest projects included the rebuilding of stations at Banbury and Plymouth, both postponed since the 1940s; of less long-term relevance were new facilities at Paignton for summer <b>holiday</b> passenger <b>traffic</b> and a marshalling yard at Margam in South Wales. Bristol Parkway station opened in 1972.|$|R
50|$|This company ran three lines: Tuileries - Suresnes, Charenton - Auteuil and Austerlitz- - Auteuil. A fourth {{opened in}} 1895 between the Louvre and Ablon-sur-Seine. The Charenton - Auteuil line was the busiest, {{with a flat}} fare of 20 centimes, more on Sundays and <b>holidays.</b> <b>Traffic</b> was immense, with 25 million annual {{journeys}} (around 70 thousand a day) between 1886 and 1900, over a route totalling 39 km from Charenton-le-Pont to Suresnes totalling 47 stops. Service was provided by a fleet of 107 boats. River traffic reached its zenith during the Exposition Universelle of 1900 with 42 million passengers, but after 1900 the service quickly declined with {{the evolution of the}} electric tramways and the opening of the Paris Métro dealt a fatal blow. In 1913, there were 13 million passengers, but traffic collapsed during the First World War, and service finished in 1917 from a lack of passengers.|$|R
5000|$|The {{eastern end}} of Malkhei Yisrael, which {{is the heart of}} the Haredi {{commercial}} district for northern Jerusalem, has been called [...] "the ultra-Orthodox Oxford Street". Spanning approximately 300 m, and branching out into the side streets, this area is noteworthy for its huge volume of foot traffic and the high cost of commercial space [...] - [...] rent per square meter is equal to or greater than that of commercial space in Israel's major malls. Many stores are open from 10 a.m. to 11 p.m., and the street is especially crowded on Thursday nights, summer nights, and the eve of Jewish <b>holidays.</b> <b>Traffic</b> on the two-lane street often comes to a standstill throughout the day, as in addition to cars and delivery trucks, bus lines serving northern Haredi neighborhoods and Rachel's Tomb ply the street. The weekday hubbub only ceases on Friday afternoon before the advent of Shabbat, while on Friday nights, Malkhei Yisrael and neighboring streets are filled with Hasidic Jews and tourists walking on foot to the various Hasidic courts in and around Geula.|$|R
25|$|Travel by car in {{the city}} is often {{difficult}} with regular jams centred on the Exe Bridges area. Historically, the bridges were a significant bottleneck for <b>holiday</b> <b>traffic</b> heading to southwest England, leading {{to the construction of}} the first bypass in the mid-1930s over Countess Wear Bridge, followed by the M5 in 1977. To further address the problem of congestion in the city centre, Devon County Council has current park and ride services and is considering the introduction of congestion charges.|$|E
25|$|Pyewipe West {{was used}} for crew and {{locomotive}} changes and for watering at least until 1963 by Grimsby to Whitland express fish trains and at least until 1962 by Summer weekend <b>holiday</b> <b>traffic</b> to Cleethorpes, Mablethorpe, Skegness and Yarmouth Vauxhall. The trains used the LD route via Pyewipe Junction. The fish train {{and most of the}} Lincolnshire Coast trains turned south off the LD at Clipstone East Junction to travel via Mansfield Central. The Yarmouth train and a few Lincolnshire Coast trains turned north at Langwith Junction to travel via Clowne South and Killamarsh South Junction, then to Sheffield Victoria or on to Manchester Central. The Summer holiday specials lasted until September 1964, so {{it is likely that the}} facilities at Pyewipe were used until then at least.|$|E
25|$|Camden Park was {{originally}} built in 1903 {{at the western}} terminus of the trolley line (then owned by the Camden Interstate Railway Company) to encourage ridership. Camden Park is now owned by the Boylin Family. This is the second generation of Boylins owning and operating West Virginia's only amusement park. J. P. Boylin transformed Camden Park from a carousel to an amusement park in 1950. By the late 19th century almost every large town in America had streetcars and many had parks to boost weekend and <b>holiday</b> <b>traffic.</b> Originally developed as a picnic area by the Camden Interstate Railway in 1903 Camden Park has survived into the 21st century as a thriving traditional amusement park. Over the years Camden Park has been the setting for baseball games, {{tens of thousands of}} picnics, fairs, marathon dances, roller derbies, flagpole sitting, a swimming pool, a zoo, plus numerous attractions and rides.|$|E
5000|$|In March 1963 Dr Beeching's {{report on}} the future of British Railways {{proposed}} Verwood for total closure {{along with the rest of}} the Salisbury & Dorset Junction line and other lines north of Bournemouth.

Apart from in the <b>holiday</b> season, <b>traffic</b> on the line was always light and closure had been discussed prior to the Beeching Axe.|$|R
40|$|AbstractOne of {{the most}} {{important}} indications of development is that people can travel with safe, comfortable, fast and economical means of transportation. For this reason, there is a continuing transportation investment in our country. Transportation investment is projected and implemented based on requirements of the next 20 years. Hourly, daily, monthly and annual variations in expected traffic flow are important in the determination of road standards. There are some accepted changes in traffic flow; for example, traffic is more dense during daylight than it is at night; during <b>holidays</b> <b>traffic</b> is more dense out of cities than it is within cities; but on weekdays it is more crowded within city than it is out of cities; and there are more vehicles on roads in summer months than in winter months. In this study, 1573 traffic accidents that occurred in Eskisehir in 2009 are reviewed according to their time of occurrence, and the relationship between number of accidents and occurrence times is examined. Finally, in order to prevent accidents, possible precautions are stated considering that relationship. Additionally, it has been analyzed with chi-square test in SPSS program that whether the days {{have a significant effect on}} the accident hours...|$|R
5000|$|It was {{not until}} 9 July 1928 that a small station, {{initially}} known as just [...] "Goodrington", was opened on the [...] side of the level crossing. A second platform was added as the double line, which had reached Tanners Lane in 1928, was extended into the station on 4 July 1930. The area between [...] and Goodrington Sands was then redeveloped with carriage sidings and a new goods depot to allow the restricted site at Paignton {{to concentrate on the}} increasing <b>holiday</b> passenger <b>traffic.</b>|$|R
25|$|Objections {{were made}} against the closure, notably from the Kent County Council and Strood Rural District Council which {{challenged}} BR's method of calculating passenger numbers and losses. They {{argued that the}} figures (i) failed to consider cheaper methods of running the line such as using diesel traction units, closing minor halts, eliminating unnecessary journeys, the operation of direct summer excursions from London to Allhallows and the combination of passenger and goods services, (ii) took into account costs incurred for the line between Gravesend and Grain which would remain open for freight, (iii) included a figure of £5,000 which would be paid to Maidstone & District Motor Services for replacement bus services, (iv) failed {{to take into account}} <b>holiday</b> <b>traffic</b> - 2,812 passengers having used Allhallows on the Whitsun holiday of 3/6 June 1960, and (v) failed to record the 25% increase in passenger numbers or take into account the ongoing residential development in the area.|$|E
500|$|Since the 1950s, the A303 {{has been}} criticised for being {{inadequate}} for {{the level of}} traffic along it. In 1959, {{it was reported that}} a typical queue for <b>holiday</b> <b>traffic</b> along the road could be as much as [...] , over [...] of the road west of Amesbury remains single carriageway, interrupted by various sections of dual carriageway. The switches between the latter to the former act as bottlenecks and are major sources of congestion along the route. Upgrading the remaining sections of road is difficult due to environmental concerns; in 1986, an upgrade of the A303 in Hampshire caused public outcry after the work destroyed the remains of an Iron Age settlement, and consequently, £100,000 was spent on emergency rescue excavation work.|$|E
500|$|Taunton {{also has}} good road links, having the M5 {{motorway}} junctions 25 (Taunton) and 26 (Wellington) {{close to the}} town, {{as well as other}} major roads such as the A38 and A358. The Taunton bypass section of M5, from J25-26, opened in April 1974, relieving the town of heavy <b>holiday</b> <b>traffic</b> on the A38. Taunton Deane services are located between junctions 25 and 26 on the M5. However, with the flourishing local economy, traffic is a problem with Somerset County Council giving a prediction of a significant increase based on 2001 levels. Two major new road have been undertaken since 2010. The [...] "Third Way" [...] linking Bridge Street and castle Street opened in 2011 but the Northern Inner Distributor Road between Staplegrove Road and Priory Avenue, due to open March 2015, remains incomplete as of April 2017.|$|E

50|$|Serving only {{a string}} of {{medium-sized}} market towns between its extremities, the S&D generated a modest internal traffic, and had daunting operational costs, due {{to the difficulty of}} its main line. Its strategic significance was the formation of a through route between the Midlands and the South Coast, by connecting with the Midland Railway at Bath. The Midland Railway linked Bath to Bristol and via Gloucester to Birmingham and the North. Heavy summer <b>holiday</b> passenger <b>traffic</b> and healthy through freight business was the result, but the long and difficult main line was always very expensive to support the business.|$|R
50|$|The fishing {{activity}} at Padstow {{had long been}} declining, and the LSWR had hopes of reviving it. Their wishes were realised and a substantial increase of fish tonnage carried was experienced over the first years; a special connection to the fish quay had been provided. Tourist and <b>holiday</b> passenger <b>traffic</b> was also sought, as {{by the end of}} the nineteenth century this business was well established at comparable locations. There was a large slate quarry at Delabole, at the time said to be the largest man-made excavation in the world and considerable traffic was derived from that.|$|R
500|$|The {{financial}} success {{enjoyed by the}} Southern Railway during the 1930s {{was based on the}} completion of its London suburban electrification scheme in 1929 and the subsequent electrification of the main lines to Brighton and the Sussex Coast and to Guildford and Portsmouth. Despite electrification plans, the Southern Railway's less heavily used lines in the West Country beyond Salisbury did not merit the cost. Lines in Devon and Cornwall were meandering, heavily graded, and although with heavy summer <b>holiday</b> <b>traffic</b> were lightly used during the winter months. [...] The seasonality of railway traffic meant that the West Country branches were worked by the ageing T9class 4-4-0 and the versatile Nclass 2-6-0, which could be better utilised on mixed-traffic services elsewhere. [...] As a result, an order was placed with Brighton railway works in April 1941 for twenty passenger locomotives of a type to be determined.|$|E
2500|$|The Minehead Railway was amalgamated {{into the}} GWR in 1897 but the West Somerset Railway {{remained}} an independent {{company for the}} time being although all its assets continued to be leased to the bigger company. Under Great Western influence, there were steady improvements in the line as it carried an increasing level of <b>holiday</b> <b>traffic</b> to the Somerset coast and Exmoor. The platform at Stogumber was extended in 1900, a new passing loop was opened in 1904 at [...] and, the following year, a second platform was opened at Minehead. A third loop was installed in 1906, this time at [...] and the loop at Williton was lengthened in 1907.|$|E
2500|$|... 1967 was a {{bad year}} for the British travel industry. The brief Six-Day War between Israel and its Arab {{neighbours}} caused a temporary spike in oil prices while both the military coup in Greece and new Spanish access restrictions to Gibraltar resulted in fewer people visiting these places. In addition, the value of sterling dropped by 14.7%, {{as a result of}} many Arab countries switching their sterling balances in London to dollars and moving them to Zürich. These events were responsible for a sharp reduction in the IT business's annual rate of expansion—down to 12% to just over a million passengers after three years of spectacular growth. This in turn led to the implementation of a major cost-reduction programme at British Eagle following an estimated drop of 20% in projected summer <b>holiday</b> <b>traffic,</b> {{as a result of the}} challenging economic conditions. As a consequence, flightdeck personnel numbers were reduced by 48 (out of a total of 246).|$|E
50|$|This autoroute {{is fairly}} heavy {{throughout}} the year.

However, outpatient and emergency departments had fewer admissions during winter vacations and during summer vacations.

60|$|On the {{afternoon}} before Christmas I {{walked through the}} thronged Merceria to the Rialto Bridge, where the tumultuous mart which opens at Piazza San Marco culminates in a deafening uproar of bargains. At this time the Merceria, or street of the shops, presents the aspect of a fair, and is arranged with a tastefulness and a cunning ability {{to make the most}} of every thing, which are seldom applied to the abundance of our fairs at home. The shops in Venice are all very small, and the streets of lofty houses are so narrow and dark, that whatever goods are not exposed in the shop-windows are brought to the door to be clamored over by purchasers; so that the Merceria is roused by unusual effort to produce a more pronounced effect of traffic and noise than it always wears; but now the effort had been made and the effect produced. The street was choked with the throngs, through which all sorts of peddlers battled their way and cried their wares. In Campo San Bartolomeo, into which the Merceria expands, at the foot of Rialto Bridge, <b>holiday</b> <b>traffic</b> had built enormous barricades of stalls, and entrenched itself behind booths, whence purchasers were assailed with challenges to buy bargains. More than half the campo was paved with crockery from Rovigo and glass-ware from Murano; clothing of every sort, and all kinds of small household wares, were offered for sale; and among the other booths, in the proportion of two to one, were stalls of the inevitable Christmas mustard and mandorlato.|$|E
