500|$|Following [...] "The Puppy Episode", Ellen was renewed {{for another}} season. ABC prefaced each episode of season five with a parental {{advisory}} warning. DeGeneres strongly criticized ABC for including the warnings, saying {{in an interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, [...] "It was like this voice like you're entering some kind of radiation center. It was very offensive, and you don't think that's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>affect</b> ratings?" [...] DeGeneres further noted demonstrable hypocrisy on the part of ABC, citing episodes of ABC series The Drew Carey Show and Spin City which included two men kissing (the Carey episode was even promoted using the kiss). [...] "There's no disclaimer on [...] at all, because it's two heterosexual men, and they're making fun of heterosexuality... because neither (Michael J. Fox nor Michael Boatman) is really gay in real life." [...] Episodes after [...] "The Puppy Episode" [...] dealt with Ellen's coming out to her parents and boss, quitting her job at the bookstore and finding a series of new jobs. Other episodes dealt with her search for a romantic partner and learning more about the LGBT community. Even some gay people began criticizing the amount of gay content in the series, including Chaz Bono, formerly known as Chastity Bono, who was at the time working for GLAAD. Bono was quoted as saying, [...] " [...] is so gay it's excluding a large part of our society. A lot of the stuff on it is somewhat of an inside joke. It's one thing to have a gay lead character, but it's another when every episode deals with specific gay issues." [...] Bono would later say that the comments were taken out of context. Ellen was canceled after its fifth season.|$|E

Bjelland commented on the event, saying: “I don’t know how I’ve progressed musically as such but a major influence in my writing was dealing with my whole schizophrenia episode. I actually haven’t spoken to anyone much about this. Dealing with multiple personalities was extremely difficult because some days I didn't know who I was or where I was at.

2500|$|Changes in the (M-L) bond {{distances}} are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>affect</b> {{the symmetry}} and electronic states of metal complexes. [...] UV-vis spectroscopy {{is a very}} useful tool for {{the determination of the}} changes of electronic states due to the SCO. [...] For example, the HS and LS states of an FeII compound such as FeII(pic)3Cl2·EtOH, can be followed with UV-vis spectroscopy. [...] The absorption spectra of these FeII molecules at different temperatures clearly show the change in intensities of the spin allowed transitions, due to these symmetric changes. Similarly to FT-IR, the intensities of the absorption bands are proportional to the fraction of metal centers in the corresponding spin state; the more intense the band, the higher the fraction of metal centers in that spin state. [...] In Figure 9, the 5T2→5E absorption band, (left spectrum), corresponds to the HS transition and is centered at 830nm. [...] The optical density of the HS band is proportional to the γHS, and a γHS vs. temperature can be plotted as in Figure 10. The LS state is seen at a higher energy which is centered at 470nm (shown on the right in Figure 9). [...] However, the LS state absorption bands are indistinguishable due to the high intensity absorption bands caused by the Metal-to-Ligand Charge Transfer (MLCT) absorption bands.|$|E

2500|$|Music blogger Kevin Cogill {{streamed}} nine {{tracks of}} Chinese Democracy on his website Antiquiet for 'an hour or two' in June 2008. The website server crashed {{shortly after the}} leak {{because of the high}} user traffic, and the tracks were removed later. In August, the FBI, under the Family Entertainment and Copyright Act, arrested Cogill for pre-releasing copyrighted material. According to Techdirt, Cogill's arrest unintentionally resulted in a large boost in illegal downloads of the album. They also revealed that UMG showed Best Buy search engine traffic results shortly after the case to capitalize on the interest and help them with the distribution deal. In November he agreed to plead guilty to one federal count of copyright infringement, later brought down to a misdemeanor. Former Guns N' Roses guitarist Slash commented on the case, stating [...] "I hope he rots in jail. It's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>affect</b> the sales of the record, and it's not fair." [...] Prosecutors initially aimed for 6 months jail time, but the charges were brought down to a misdemeanor copyright infringement charge. Cogill was sentenced to two months house arrest and was required to produce an anti-piracy video with the RIAA. Cogill claimed he never did the video with the RIAA due to them not wanting to spend money on production costs.|$|E
2500|$|In 2001, Bob Costas {{claimed that}} despite still loving the game, he now felt a certain {{alienation}} from the institution. By {{the time that}} NBC lost Major League Baseball {{for the second time}} in twelve years, the sport endured a strike, realignment, the introduction of the wild card round, and NBC's complete loss of the regular season Game of the Week. Costas would add that since NBC only did a few games each year and he lacked the forum that he would eventually have (on HBO's On the Record with Bob Costas, Inside the NFL and Costas Now as well as Costas on the Radio) to express his views, he to some extent, started editorializing in games. When asked about whether or not the fact that NBC no longer had the baseball rights was disappointing, Bob Costas said [...] "I'm a little disappointed to lose baseball, but that's the way the business is. And it's not nearly as disappointing as it was when we lost it at the end of the '80s. Because then it was like baseball was the birthright for NBC. ... (Baseball is) not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>affect</b> any decision that I have in the future. It's nowhere near as devastating as a decade ago. Different circumstances, different time. I miss it a little bit but not a lot. I am very philosophical about this stuff. I have had wonderful opportunities in my career and no one wants to hear me complain about anything." [...] In 2009, Costas would become a contributor and occasional play-by-play announcer for MLB Network.|$|E
2500|$|Transitions from a HS to a LS state cause a {{decrease}} in the bond distances between the metal center and the ligand. The {{decrease in the number of}} antibonding electrons also strengthens the metal-ligand bond in transitions from a HS to LS state. Because the HS and LS states differ with regard to metal-to-ligand bond distances, the harmonic approximation can be assumed. [...] The LS state will have the smaller equilibrium distance - meaning that it has the larger bond force constant, ωLS>ωHS, and the transitions must fall within the thermal energy, kBT [...] In addition, spin transitions are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>affect</b> the vibrational modes of the ligands. A strong interaction between the metal and the ligand, as is the case of a LS state, is going to cause a shift of the electronic density to the metal causing a weakness of the interligand bonds, and therefore a red shift of their vibrational modes. [...] Figure 6 shows the FT-IR spectrum of an iron(II) cluster at different temperatures. [...] As the temperature decreases, the Fe-N bond distance decreases. Therefore, the CN stretching band shifts to higher frequencies and at higher temperatures, the CN stretching band increases in energy. In this figure, it is shown how the HS state CN stretching band at 2054cm−1 is predominant at higher temperatures and the LS state CN stretching band at 2099cm−1 is predominant at lower temperatures, in addition to the different mixed HS and LS state and the fading of this band as the temperatures change. The area under the curves of the absorption peaks for these two states are going to be proportional to the fraction of HS and LS states in the sample. Figure 7 shows a plot of the area under the curves of the absorption peaks as a function of temperature for the same iron cluster (vide supra), showing a large hysteresis loop.|$|E

An adjutant, sergeant, or devout Catholic considered that men would be improved, gain self-command, and respect for law and order, under prolonged discipline and daily sacrifice. A freethinker of the educated class, or a private of Socialistic tendencies, on the other hand, would insist that the strain must make men restless, irritable, more eager for their rights, less tolerant of control. Each imagined that the war would further the chances of the future as they dreamed of it. If I had talked with capitalists--there are none among French soldiers--they would doubtless have insisted that after-war conditions were going to be easier, just as the [...] "sans-sous" [...] maintained {{that they were going to}} be harder and provocative of revolution.
