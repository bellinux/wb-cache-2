All IACS member classifications have similar requirements since they need to comply with IACS guidelines. The allowable diminution thickness depends on the building rules of each classification. Also depending on type the societies request 1 or 2 operators. The UTM operators need to be Level II certified according with SNT-TC-1A or similar standard. Also the company that performs the ultrasonic thickness measurement survey {{must be approved by}} the classification that the vessel is registered with.

5000|$|One of {{the more}} {{difficult}} decisions in selecting a sound level meter is [...] "How {{do you know if}} it complies with its claimed standard?" [...] This is a difficult question and IEC 61672 part 2 tries to answer this by the concept of [...] "pattern approval". A manufacturer has to supply instruments to a national laboratory which tests one of them and if it meets its claims issue a formal Pattern <b>Approval</b> <b>certificate.</b> In Europe, the most common approval is often considered to be that from the PTB in Germany (Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt). If a manufacturer cannot show at least one model in his range that has such approval, it is reasonable to be wary, but the cost of this approval militates against any manufacturer having all his range approved. Inexpensive sound level meters (under $200) are unlikely to have a Pattern Approval and may produce incorrect measurement results.|$|R

Explosion protection is regulated with standards according to which equipment must be manufactured. In Russia and CIS countries explosion-proof equipment must be constructed in compliance with GOST standards. To confirm that equipment is manufactured according to standards’ requirements and is safe and reliable it must undergo the approval procedure.
