40|$|AIM: 125 I-iododeoxyuridine is a {{potential}} Auger radiation therapy agent. Its incorporation in DNA of proliferating cells is enhanced by <b>fluorodeoxyuridine.</b> Here, we evaluated therapeutic activities of 125 I-iododeoxyuridine in an optimized <b>fluorodeoxyuridine</b> pre-treatment inducing S-phase synchronization. METHODS: After S-phase synchronization by <b>fluorodeoxyuridine,</b> cells were treated with 125 I-iododeoxyuridine. Apoptosis analysis and S-phase synchronization were studied by flow cytometry. Cell survival was determined by colony-forming assay. Based on measured growth parameters, the number of decays per cell that induced killing was extrapolated. RESULTS: Treatment experiments showed that 72 to 91 % of synchronized cells were killed after 0. 8 and 8 kBq/ml 125 I-iododeoxyuridine incubation, respectively. In controls, only 8 to 38 % of cells were killed by corresponding 125 I-iododeoxyuridine activities alone and even increasing the activity to 80 kBq/ml gave only 42 % killing. Duplicated treatment cycles or repeated <b>fluorodeoxyuridine</b> pre-treatment allowed enhancing cell killing to > 95 % at 8 kBq/ml 125 I-iododeoxyuridine. About 50 and 160 decays per S-phase cells in controls and S-phase synchronization, respectively, {{were responsible for the}} observed cell killing at 0. 8 kBq/ml radio-iododeoxyuridine. CONCLUSION: These data show the successful application of <b>fluorodeoxyuridine</b> that provided increased 125 I-iododeoxyuridine Auger radiation cell killing efficacy through S-phase synchronization and high DNA incorporation of radio-iododeoxyuridine...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} three {{thymidylate}} synthetase inhibitors, <b>fluorodeoxyuridine,</b> fluorodeoxycytidine, and trifluorothymidine, to induce {{the expression of}} eight different folate-sensitive fragile sites has been investigated in 22 patients and compared with the efficacy of simple folate deprivation for inducing fragile site expression. <b>Fluorodeoxyuridine</b> and fluorodeoxycytidine were equal {{in their ability to}} elicit fragile site expression but fluorodeoxycytidine proved less cytotoxic under comparable culture conditions. Both <b>fluorodeoxyuridine</b> and fluorodeoxycytidine were found to be more efficient than trifluorothymidine at comparable concentrations but less efficient than simple folate deprivation in eliciting fragile site expression in lymphocytes. Since the three inhibitors induced expression of eight different folate-sensitive fragile sites, it is likely that all folate-sensitive fragile sites have a common underlying mechanism of expression. The practical application of thymidylate synthetase inhibitors in the routine detection of heritable fragile sites is discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{levels of}} histone mRNAs are reduced 90 to 95 % after {{treatment}} of mouse myeloma cells with inhibitors of DNA synthesis which disrupt deoxynucleotide metabolism. In contrast, novobiocin, which inhibits DNA synthesis {{but does not}} alter deoxynucleotide metabolism, did not alter histone mRNA levels. Upon reversing the inhibition by <b>fluorodeoxyuridine</b> by feeding with thymidine, histone mRNA levels are restored to control levels within 40 to 60 min. The rate of histone gene transcription is reduced 75 to 80 % within 10 min after treatment with <b>fluorodeoxyuridine</b> and increased to control levels within 10 min after refeeding with thymidine. Inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide or puromycin in cells which had been treated with <b>fluorodeoxyuridine</b> resulted in an increase of histone mRNA levels. This was partly due {{to an increase in}} the rate of transcription. The data indicate that both transcription and mRNA degradation are linked to deoxynucleotide metabolism. Continued protein synthesis is necessary for maintaining the inhibition of histone gene transcription...|$|E

40|$|Using pulse {{labeling}} techniques with [3 H]thymidine or [3 H]cytidine, combined with DNA fiber autoradiography, we {{have investigated the}} direction and rate of DNA chain growth in mammalian cells. In general, chain elongation proceeds bidirectionally from the common origin of pairs of adjacent replication sections. This type of replication is noted whether the DNA is labeled first with [3 H]thymidine of high specific activity, followed by [3 H]thymidine of low specific activity or the sequence is reversed. Approximately one-fifth of the growing points have unique origins and in these replication units, chain growth proceeds in one direction only. <b>Fluorodeoxyuridine</b> and hydroxyurea both inhibit DNA chain propagation. <b>Fluorodeoxyuridine</b> exerts its effect on chain growth within 15 - 23 min, while the effect of hydroxyurea is evident within 15 min under conditions where the endogenous thymidine pool has been depleted by prior treatment with <b>fluorodeoxyuridine.</b> Puromycin {{has no effect on}} chain growth until 60 min after addition of the compound, even though thymidine incorporation is more than 50 % reduced within 15 min. After 2 h of treatment with puromycin, the rate of chain growth is reduced by 50 %, whereas thymidine incorporation is reduced by 75 %. Cycloheximide reduces the rates of DNA chain growth and thymidine incorporation 50 % within 15 min, and, on prolonged treatment, the decrease in rate of chain growth generally parallels the reduction in thymidine incorporation...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} inhibitors of {{bacterial}} deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis upon logarithmically growing cultures of Saccharomyces cerevisiae were investigated. Cell division, ribonucleic acid (RNA) synthesis, and DNA synthesis were measured after addition of nalidixic acid, <b>fluorodeoxyuridine,</b> or phenethyl alcohol to cultures of yeast growing in defined and complex media. Both nalidixic acid and <b>fluorodeoxyuridine</b> had only temporary effects on nucleic acid synthesis in cultures growing in defined medium, and {{little or no}} observable effect on cultures growing in complex medium. Neither compound inhibited colony formation on complex solid medium, although growth was slow on defined solid medium. Phenethyl alcohol caused complete inhibition of DNA synthesis, RNA synthesis, and cell division in cultures growing in defined medium.

40|$|The {{nucleoside}} analogues fluorouridine and <b>fluorodeoxyuridine</b> (both at 100 muM) and 8 -azaguanine (at 500 muM) inhibit both rRNA transcription {{and processing}} in Ehrlich ascites cells. In BHK 21 cells <b>fluorodeoxyuridine</b> {{has no effect}} on either rRNA maturation or transcription, whereas toyocamycin (at 2 microM) inhibits both processes in BHK 21 cells and Ehrlich ascites cells. The drugs inhibit transcription in cells incubated in the complete medium, but have no effect on the decreased transcription in cells incubated in a medium without amino acids. This lack of effect cannot be explained by an altered uptake of the drugs in the amino acid-starved cells, since maturation of the rRNA precursor is affected in cells incubated in media with or without amino acids. The effect of the drugs on rRNA transcription is not the consequence of the inhibition of protein synthesis. The results lend support to the proposal that rRNA processing and transcription are co-ordinately controlled in cells with a high rate of rRNA synthesis...|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} various inhibitors of DNA {{precursor}} metabolism were studied on Dictyostelium discoideum growing in a defined axenic medium. <b>Fluorodeoxyuridine</b> was an effective inhibitor of growth at 20 micrograms/ml; this inhibition was not reversed by thymidine, suggesting {{that in this}} organism <b>fluorodeoxyuridine</b> is not acting on thymidylate synthetase alone. Removal of the required nutrient, folic acid, from the medium resulted in a lower maximum level of growth than in the control. The inclusion of adenine, guanine, serine, and thymidine in the minus-folic acid medium allowed the final growth level to approach that of the control. Methotrexate, a folic acid analog and dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor, blocked growth completely at 200 micrograms/ml; its effect was partly reversed {{by the addition of}} adenine, guanine, serine, and thymidine. Aminopterin, another folic acid analog, had only a temporary effect on cell multiplication, followed by a return to exponential growth. Trimethoprim was ineffective up to 200 micrograms/ml. Hydroxyurea blocked growth in the concentration range of 150 to 300 micrograms/ml. These results indicate that several of these inhibitors are effective for altering thymidine monophosphate synthesis in D. discoideum and hence may be useful for studies of DNA replication and repair and for the isolation and characterization of thymidine-requiring mutants...|$|E
40|$|Evidence is {{presented}} that poxvirus deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis required concurrent protein synthesis. The protein requirement in question {{can be distinguished}} from viral-induced thymidine kinase and DNA polymerase by virture of the instability of its messenger ribonucleic acid and its stoichiometric rather than catalytic relation to DNA synthesis. The protein(s) required did accumulate {{in the presence of}} <b>fluorodeoxyuridine,</b> an inhibitor of DNA synthesis, and, thus, appeared to be an “early” poxvirus function.

30|$|Thus, {{therapeutic}} {{administration of}} C 60 FAS, 5 -FU, and MI- 1 {{leads to a}} reduction {{of the number of}} DMH-induced tumors and colon lesion area in rats. MI- 1 and 5 -FU drugs (the latter is related to antimetabolites and pyrimidine antagonists, whose antitumor effect manifests itself as a result of 5 -fluorouracil converted to <b>fluorodeoxyuridine</b> monophosphate, <b>fluorodeoxyuridine</b> triphosphate, and fluorouridine triphosphate [46]) violate DNA synthesis and, as a consequence, inhibit cell division. The mechanism of C 60 fullerene action is different and can be related to its antioxidant effect [47, 48] that causes the epigenetic changes in tumor cells, which inhibit their further growth. As a result of the DMH metabolism in the liver, the formation of electrophilic diazonium ions occurs [32], which causes an oxidative stress. C 60 fullerene, being a powerful antioxidant, is able to prevent the progression of tumors at an early stage. Based on the fact that MI- 1 and C 60 fullerene have different mechanisms of action, the observed effectiveness of their combined action on the colorectal carcinogenesis model can therefore be explained, at least in part. Hence, the simultaneous administration of MI- 1 and C 60 fullerene can potentially increase the effectiveness of anticancer therapy and reduce side effects, reported recently for other C 60 fullerene-drug combinations [49, 50]. Let us further discuss the possible mechanism by which the antioxidant effect of C 60 FAS may operate in the system investigated in the present work.|$|E
