25|$|A key path is a {{specific}} file, registry key, or ODBC data source that the package author specifies as critical for a given component. Because a file {{is the most common}} type of key path, the term <b>key</b> <b>file</b> is commonly used. A component can contain at most one key path; if a component has no explicit key path, the component's destination folder is taken to be the key path. When an MSI-based program is launched, Windows Installer checks the existence of key paths. If there is a mismatch between the current system state and the value specified in the MSI package (e.g., a <b>key</b> <b>file</b> is missing), the related feature is re-installed. This process is known as self-healing or self-repair. No two components should use the same key path.|$|E
25|$|KeePass Password Safe is a {{free and}} {{open-source}} password manager primarily for Windows. It officially supports macOS and Linux operating systems {{through the use of}} Mono. Additionally, there are several unofficial ports for Windows Phone, Android, iOS, and BlackBerry devices. KeePass stores usernames, passwords, and other fields, including free-form notes and file attachments, in an encrypted file. This file can be protected by a master password, <b>key</b> <b>file,</b> and/or the current Windows account details. By default, the KeePass database is stored on a local file system (as opposed to cloud storage).|$|E
