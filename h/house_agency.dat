The proprietor of a prohibited publication can lodge an objection to {{a prohibition}} order within a month of the date when the order is published in the Government Gazette to the President, whose decision on the matter is [...] "final and shall not be called in question in any court". When exercising this discretion, the President is required to follow the advice of the Cabinet. It is a criminal offence to print, publish, sell, issue, circulate, reproduce or possess a prohibited publication or an extract from it; and to import, [...] the importation of, or have in one's possession any imported prohibited publication. There is a rebuttable presumption a person knows the contents of a publication and their nature immediately after the publication comes into his or her possession. However, it is a defence for a person to demonstrate that the publication was [...] "printed, published, sold, issued, circulated or reproduced, as the case may be, without his authority, consent and knowledge, and without any want of due care or caution on his part, and {{that he did not know}} and had no reason to suspect the nature of the document or publication".|$|E
2500|$|Scott McMahon is a United States {{citizen who}} was wrongfully imprisoned without {{charge in the}} Philippines from April, 2011 to August, 2016. McMahon {{was living in a}} {{subdivision}} with his longtime girlfriend and their two children when he struck up a friendship with a neighbor named Jan Marcel, who had a highly tumultuous relationship with his wife, Dolores San Pablo Vermeulen. One day, Vermeulen brought the police in to raid McMahon's home in search of Marcel. This event had an extremely traumatic effect on McMahon's son, and because of the damage to his son's mental health, McMahon brought a lawsuit against Vermeulen for child abuse. When all her attempts to get the lawsuit dropped failed, Vermeulen accused McMahon of having raped her six months previously. A medical examination showed no sign of rape, and McMahon could prove that he was on vacation hundreds of miles away with his family {{at the time of the}} alleged assault. Despite the fact that McMahon could not physically have perpetrated the alleged rape, and the lack of any evidence that a crime had even taken place, McMahon (who had no idea at the time that he had been subpoenaed) was arrested in a restaurant on April 7, 2011, in front of television news cameras. McMahon was held in prison conditions described by The David <b>House</b> <b>Agency,</b> which is handling his case, as [...] "subhuman." [...] Vermeulen sent a friend to both McMahon and his girlfriend, offering to drop the rape charge if he would drop the lawsuit against her and also pay her off: a clear attempt at blackmail. All such efforts were rebuffed by the couple. McMahon petitioned to be released on bail, but this request was not even considered until three-and-a-half years after his arrest, when it was denied, the court basing its decision on Vermeulen's accusations, despite the total lack of evidence. Finally, on August 2, 2016, a Filipino judge acquitted McMahon of all charges, writing that Vermeulen had accused McMahon as a way to get [...] "leverage" [...] in the 2009 child abuse case. However, McMahon could not leave the country, because the Filipino Bureau of Immigration demanded that he pay them $1000 for every year since his visa expired, despite the fact that it only expired because he had been imprisoned for a crime he didn't commit. Due to heavy U.S. government pressure, McMahon was allowed to return home to Seattle on September 4. The California Innocence Project represented Scott McMahon alongside a team of legal and political experts, coordinated by the David <b>House</b> <b>Agency.</b>|$|E
6000|$|It was in {{the last}} year of his {{apprenticeship}} that he had pursued his researches after that missing qualification into the Folkestone Young Men's Association, where Mr. Chester Coote prevailed. Mr. Chester Coote was a young man of semi-independent means who inherited a share in a <b>house</b> <b>agency,</b> read Mrs. Humphry Ward, and took an interest in social work. He was a whitish-faced young man with a prominent nose, pale blue eyes, and a quivering quality in his voice. He was very active upon committees; he was very prominent and useful on all social occasions, in evidence upon platforms and upon all those semi-public occasions when the Great descend. He lived with an only sister. To Kipps and his kind in the Young Men's Association he read a stimulating paper on [...] "Self-Help." [...] He said it was the noblest of all our distinctive English characteristics, and he was very much down upon the [...] "over-educated" [...] Germans. At the close a young German hairdresser made a few commendatory remarks which developed somehow into an oration on Hanoverian politics. As he became excited he became guttural and obscure; the meeting sniggered cheerfully at such ridiculous English, and Kipps was so much amused that he forgot a private project to ask this Chester Coote how he might set about a little self-help on his own private account in such narrow margins of time as the System of Mr. Shalford spared him. But afterwards in the night-time it came to him again.|$|E

40|$|Current {{policy and}} {{discourse}} concerning {{the governance of}} anti-social behaviour in the UK has emphasised the spatial concentration of disorder on particular social housing estates. Policy has sought to respond by devolving management of the processes of social control to local neighbourhoods. Local authorities, and social <b>housing</b> <b>agencies</b> in particular, are being given an increasing role within multi-agency partnerships aimed at governing local incidences of anti-social behaviour. This paper places this emerging role for social <b>housing</b> <b>agencies</b> within theories of governmentality and wider trends in urban governance and suggests that present developments may be understood through a paradigm of housing governance. Drawing on studies in Edinburgh and Glasgow, the paper examines the role of social <b>housing</b> <b>agencies</b> in the governance of anti-social behaviour. It argues that social <b>housing</b> <b>agencies</b> face a number of dilemmas in reacting to their emerging role and that such dilemmas reflect wider concerns about the new urban governance. </p...|$|R
