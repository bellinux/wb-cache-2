5|$|The Atlas booster {{had been}} {{modified}} since the previous flight, and now included baffled fuel injectors {{and a new}} hypergolic fuel <b>igniter</b> instead of the original pyrotechnic <b>igniter.</b> This would completely eliminate problems with combustion instability and allow the booster to be released immediately upon attaining full thrust instead of being held on the pad for a few moments. The factory testing and checkout process for MA-8's booster, while still a lengthy affair taking several months (partially due to the new propulsion system), was nonetheless easier and shorter {{than it had been}} for any previous Mercury-Atlas vehicle as engineers gained more experience with the hardware and coordination between contractors improved.|$|E
5|$|The {{oxidizer}} {{and fuel}} preburners are welded to the hot-gas manifold. The fuel and oxidizer enter the preburners and are mixed so that efficient combustion can occur. The augmented spark <b>igniter</b> {{is a small}} combination chamber located {{in the center of}} the injector of each preburner. The two dual-redundant spark igniters, which are activated by the engine controller, are used during the engine start sequence to initiate combustion in each preburner. They are turned off after approximately three seconds because the combustion process is then self-sustaining. The preburners produce the fuel-rich hot gases that pass through the turbines to generate the power needed to operate the high-pressure turbopumps. The oxidizer preburner's outflow drives a turbine that is connected to the HPOTP and to the oxidizer preburner pump. The fuel preburner's outflow drives a turbine that is connected to the HPFTP.|$|E
5|$|Each engine main {{combustion}} chamber (MCC) receives fuel-rich hot gas from a hot-gas manifold cooling circuit. The gaseous hydrogen and liquid oxygen enter the chamber at the injector, which mixes the propellants. A small augmented-spark igniter-chamber {{is located in}} the center of the injector, and this dual-redundant <b>igniter</b> is used during the engine start sequence to initiate combustion. The igniters are turned off after approximately three seconds because the combustion process is self-sustaining. The main injector and dome assembly are welded to the hot-gas manifold, and the MCC is also bolted to the hot-gas manifold. The MCC comprises a structural shell made of Inconel 718 which is lined with a copper-silver-zirconium alloy called NARloy-Z, developed specifically for the RS-25 in the 1970s. Around 390 channels are machined into the liner wall to carry liquid hydrogen through the liner to provide MCC cooling, as the temperature in the {{combustion chamber}} reaches 3300°C (6000°F) during flight – higher than the boiling point of iron.|$|E
50|$|During the {{production}} of the first batches, mechanical <b>igniters</b> were used (Hebelzünder 44); in later models, chemical <b>igniters</b> were preferred.|$|R
50|$|Original {{oil burner}} {{transformers}} were copper wire conductors wrapped around an iron core. A standard type of transformer to this day. In the mid 90s electronic <b>igniters</b> replaced the copper and iron transformer,solving many {{problems related to}} the old style transformer. This new technology in <b>igniters</b> would soon replace all old style transformers throughout the oil burner industry. The new <b>igniters</b> would run cooler so the output voltage could be increased from 10,000 to 20,000 VAC.|$|R
50|$|A red-hot surface {{can also}} be used to provide ignition. Such <b>igniters</b> are often made of silicon carbide, silicon nitride, or another {{material}} that is durable under prolonged exposure to extreme heat. Hot-surface <b>igniters</b> are commonly used in cooking ovens, boilers, and modern gas furnaces.|$|R
25|$|The Ares I <b>igniter</b> was an {{advanced}} {{version of the}} flight-proven <b>igniter</b> used on the Space Shuttle's solid rocket boosters. It was approximately 18inches (46cm) in diameter and 36inches (91cm) long, and took advantage of upgraded insulation materials that had improved thermal properties to protect the igniter's case from the burning solid propellant. NASA successfully completed test firing of the <b>igniter</b> for the Ares I engines on March 10, 2009 at ATK Launch Systems test facilities near Promontory, Utah. The <b>igniter</b> test generated a flame 200 feet (60 meters) in length, and preliminary data showed the <b>igniter</b> performed as planned.|$|E
25|$|Once a hwacha {{was set up}} for combat, the {{operators}} would use the gunpowder stored in a boot-like bag tied on each <b>igniter</b> {{to be used for}} each hole on the machine. After that, {{the operators}} were able to load the hwacha with arrows or iron spikes and be ready to shoot. To do so, they stepped back, covered their ears, and pulled the rope for each <b>igniter.</b>|$|E
25|$|Most {{igniters}} in {{gas turbine}} applications are electrical spark igniters, similar to automotive spark plugs. The <b>igniter</b> {{needs to be}} in the combustion zone where the fuel and air are already mixed, but it needs to be far enough upstream so that it is not damaged by the combustion itself. Once the combustion is initially started by the <b>igniter,</b> it is self-sustaining and the <b>igniter</b> is no longer used. In can-annular and annular combustors (see Types of combustors below), the flame can propagate from one combustion zone to another, so igniters are not needed at each one. In some systems ignition-assist techniques are used. One such method is oxygen injection, where oxygen is fed to the ignition area, helping the fuel easily combust. This is particularly useful in some aircraft applications where the engine may have to restart at high altitude.|$|E

25|$|Another {{danger was}} that the {{friction}} <b>igniter</b> was very sensitive, a powerful blow to the grenade with the detonator inserted could set it off. This made the No 6 almost as dangerous as the percussion cap grenades that {{it was designed to}} replace.|$|E
25|$|The {{boiler furnace}} {{auxiliary}} equipment includes coal feed nozzles and <b>igniter</b> guns, soot blowers, water lancing and observation ports (in the furnace walls) for {{observation of the}} furnace interior. Furnace explosions due to any accumulation of combustible gases after a trip-out are avoided by flushing out such gases from the combustion zone before igniting the coal.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the first}} {{launch of the}} Falcon 9 v1.1 in September 2013, which {{experienced}} a post-mission second-stage engine restart failure, the second-stage <b>igniter</b> propellant lines were insulated to better support in-space restart following long coast phases for orbital trajectory maneuvers. Falcon 9 Flight 6 was the first launch of the Falcon 9 configured with a jettisonable payload fairing.|$|E

50|$|Researchers from Japan's National Institutes of Natural Sciences are {{developing}} laser <b>igniters</b> that use YAG chips to ignite fuel in an engine, {{in place of}} a spark plug.The lasers use several 800 picosecond long pulses to ignite the fuel, producing faster and more uniform ignition. The researchers say that such <b>igniters</b> could yield better performance and fuel economy, with fewer harmful emissions.|$|R
25|$|Both the {{propellant}} charge {{appropriate for}} the required range and the bomb were loaded via the muzzle. Usually a Lee–Enfield rifle's bolt action mechanism was screwed into the breech. A special blank rifle cartridge was loaded and was triggered by pulling a lanyard, and fired into an <b>igniter</b> {{at the base of}} the mortar chamber, igniting the propellant charge and launching the bomb.|$|E
25|$|In contrast, Japanese {{manufacturers}} {{shared their}} information, quickly overcoming technical and manufacturing challenges and creating new markets. In Japan, a temperature stable crystal cut {{was developed by}} Issac Koga. Japanese efforts in materials research created piezoceramic materials competitive to the United States materials but free of expensive patent restrictions. Major Japanese piezoelectric developments included new designs of piezoceramic filters for radios and televisions, piezo buzzers and audio transducers that can connect directly to electronic circuits, and the piezoelectric <b>igniter,</b> which generates sparks for small engine ignition systems and gas-grill lighters, by compressing a ceramic disc. Ultrasonic transducers that transmit sound waves through air had existed {{for quite some time}} but first saw major commercial use in early television remote controls. These transducers now are mounted on several car models as an echolocation device, helping the driver determine the distance from the car to any objects that may be in its path.|$|E

2500|$|The British cordite {{charges were}} stored two silk bags to a metal {{cylindrical}} container, with a 16-oz gunpowder <b>igniter</b> charge, which {{was covered with}} a thick paper wad, four charges being used on each projectile. The gun crews were removing the charges from their containers and removing the paper covering over the gunpowder <b>igniter</b> charges. The effect of having eight loads at the ready was to have [...] of exposed explosive, with each charge leaking small amounts of gunpowder from the <b>igniter</b> bags. In effect, the gun crews had laid an explosive train from the turret to the magazines, and one shell hit to a battlecruiser turret was enough to end a ship.|$|E
2500|$|The {{problem in}} the <b>igniter</b> fuel lines was not {{detected}} during ground testing because a stainless steel mesh covering [...] the fuel line became saturated with liquid air due to the extreme cold of the liquid hydrogen flowing through it. The liquid air damped a vibration mode that became evident when tests were conducted in a vacuum after the Apollo 6 flight. This was also a simple fix, involving replacing the flexible bellows section where the break occurred with a loop of stainless steel pipe. The S-IVB used the same J-2 engine design as the S-II {{and so it was}} decided that an <b>igniter</b> line problem had also stopped the third stage from reigniting in Earth orbit. [...] Ground testing confirmed that the slight underperformance seen in the first S-IVB burn was consistent with damage to the <b>igniter</b> line.|$|E

50|$|Flame <b>igniters</b> use {{electric}} sparks {{to initiate}} combustion in some furnaces and gas stoves {{in place of}} a pilot flame. Auto reignition is a safety feature that is used in some flame <b>igniters</b> that senses the electrical conductivity of the flame and uses this information to determine whether a burner flame is lit. This information is used to stop an ignition device from sparking after the flame is lit or restart the flame if it goes out.|$|R

2500|$|The {{failure of}} the two engines in the second stage was traced to the rupturing of a fuel line that fed the engine igniters. The <b>igniter</b> was {{essentially}} a miniature rocket motor mounted in {{the wall of the}} J-2 engine's pressure chamber. It was fed by small-diameter flexible lines carrying liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen. [...] During the S-II second stage burn, the hydrogen line feeding the engine number two <b>igniter</b> broke due to vibration. As a result, the <b>igniter</b> fed pure liquid oxygen into the pressure chamber. Normally the J-2 engine burns a hydrogen-rich mixture to keep temperature down. The liquid oxygen flow caused a much higher temperature locally and eventually the pressure chamber failed. The sudden drop in pressure was detected and caused a shutdown command to be issued. Unfortunately, the command signals for engine three were partially cross-wired with engine two, so that the shutdown of engine two caused a liquid oxygen valve for engine three to close, resulting in a shutdown of that engine as well.|$|E
