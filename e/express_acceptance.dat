50|$|The {{first step}} in the {{analysis}} is to determine whether the UCC or the common law governs the transaction. If the UCC governs, courts will usually try to find which form constitutes the offer. Next, offeree's acceptance forms bearing the different terms is examined. One should note whether the acceptance is expressly conditional on its own terms. If it is expressly conditional, it is a counteroffer, not an acceptance. If performance is accepted after the counteroffer, even without <b>express</b> <b>acceptance,</b> under 2-207(3), a contract will exist under only those terms on which the parties agree, together with UCC gap-fillers.|$|E
50|$|In the {{objection}} filed on 9 December, Albania {{argued that a}} special agreement was the only valid way that the case could be brought. The objection stated that when at least one party was a state that was not otherwise bound {{to submit to the}} Court's jurisdiction, proceedings could only be instituted by special agreement. Albania cited Articles 26(1) and 40(1) of the ICJ Statute in its support, and stated that no such agreement had been reached. In contesting the claims of the UK, the Albanian objection stated that the Security Council resolution was not itself enough to compel Albania to accept the jurisdiction of the Court. It also said that Albania's acceptance of the obligations of a UN member state did not constitute <b>express</b> <b>acceptance</b> of jurisdiction under the ICJ Statute.

40|$|The {{starting}} point for software evolution is usually a change request, expressing the new or updated requirements on the delivered system. The requirements specied in a change re-quest document are often incomplete and inconsistent with the initial requirement document, {{as well as the}} implementa-tion. Programmers working on the evolution of the software are often in trouble interpreting an under-specied change request document, resulting in code that does not meet the users ' expectations and contains faults that can only be de-tected later through expensive testing activities. In this paper, we investigate the role of acceptance tests to clarify the requirements used in software evolution itera-tions. In particular we focus on Fit tables, a way to <b>express</b> <b>acceptance</b> tests which simplies their translation into ex-ecutable test cases. We designed and ran an experiment to assess whether availability of Fit tables aects the level of understanding and the productivity in understanding the requirements.

40|$|One of {{the main}} reasons for the failure of many {{software}} projects is the late discovery of a mismatch between the customers ’ expectations and the pieces of functionality implemented in the delivered system. At the root of such a mismatch is often a set of poorly defined, incomplete, under-specified, and inconsistent requirements. Test driven development has recently been proposed as a way to clarify requirements during the initial elicitation phase, by means of acceptance tests that specify the desired behavior of the system. The goal of the work reported in this paper is to empirically characterize the contribution of acceptance tests to the clarification of the requirements coming from the customer. We focused on Fit tables, a way to <b>express</b> <b>acceptance</b> tests, which can be automatically translated into executable test cases. We ran two experiments with students from University of Trento and Politecnico of Torino, {{to assess the impact of}} Fit tables on the clarity of requirements.

40|$|The first {{researches}} in the Ukrainian {{language are}} devoted to the studying of agreement / disagreement as a sentence, word-sentence, non-divided sentence. As for communicative orientation words-sentences are divided into affirmative, negative and others. Affirmative, in turn, depending on their function in connected speech are divided into four groups: a) proper affirmative; b) affirmative wordssentences represented by words okay, yeah, uh huh, right, etc.; c) word-sentences that the speaker uses not only to claim or agree about anything, {{but at the same}} time to conclude the information heard, seen, expressing the general attitude to it; e) words-sentences, which confirm the speculation, the views of the speaker. Negative word-sentences are actually divided into proper negative, negative word-sentences, which show disagreement and proposal or argument of the speaker and into negative word-sentences, which the speaker denies himself or herself. One-word agreement / disagreement has been seen as an affirmative / negative non-divided sentences that are nominated by word-sentences. Non-divided sentences can be expressed by particles, modal structures, interjections and idioms that express modal-logic meaning of agreement / disagreement. Further agreement / disagreement is analyzed as a speech act based on different languages. All scientists who are engaged in research of speech phenomena agree that: 1) the basic form of agreement and disagreement design is a dialogical unity; 2) category of agreement and disagreement serves to <b>express</b> <b>acceptance</b> or adoption of the views of the speaker; 3) in semantic terms in this category modal evaluation of the expression of interlocutor about the compliance or noncompliance reality is shown. Also agreement / disagreement expressions are studied as a speech genre, particularly as a part of non-confronted /confronted speech genres. Thus, the speech phenomenon of agreement / disagreement is studied by linguists as the sentence, expression, speech act and speech genre...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAs {{discussed}} by Spitz (1957), first negative constructions {{seem to take}} over from early gestures of rejection and avoidance (Clark 1978). For Kendon (2002), in many cultures, gestures of negation are the ritualization of spontaneous actions. Guidetti (2005) argues that gestures of agreement and refusal are the first symbolic gestures (aside from pointing) used by children. The study of the expression of negation in longitudinal data of adult-child conversations is therefore a privileged locus for a multimodal approach to language acquisition. However, tracing the transitions or complementarities between actions and gestures, and between gestures and verbalized expressions in very young children, and understanding the function of each modality can be quite complex. In the case of bilingual language acquisition, the necessity to enter two languages at once might have an influence on {{the management of the}} visual-gestural and the auditory modalities. The synchronization of gestures and verbal production, the amount of gestures used and the length of the “pre-linguistic” period might be different from monolingual children. In order to tackle these issues, we analyze the longitudinal data of Antoine, a bilingual French/Italian child living in France, and recorded once a month for an hour with his Italian mother and once a month with his French father between the ages of 1; 5 and 3; 5, in comparison to 4 monolingual children during the same age period. Negation in French and Italian is expressed by a similar adverb (non/no) at the beginning of acquisition but the syntax of negative utterances used a little later on is different in both languages. Our preliminary analyses show that there is a clear dominance of corporal-gestural negation {{at the beginning of the}} data. First forms of negation correspond to refusals expressed by avoidance, gestures of rejection, headshakes. The child’s gestures form a clear micro-system with a form-function pairing to <b>express</b> <b>acceptance,</b> requests and refusals. Later on, around 2; 0, negation is expressed by a simultaneous use of gestures and verbal productions first in French, then in Italian with very creative combinations of the two languages such as manon (ma in Italian meaning but and non in French meaning no) accompanied with gestures. Finally, around 2; 6, the verbal modality becomes clearly dominant. The comparison with the four monolingual children suggests that several features distinguish Antoine who seems to use the gestural modality for a longer period of time due to a combination of several factors:-In his bilingual environment, gestures of negation are culturally the same in French and in Italian and are used both by his mother and his father. They might be a stable element to seize in his input and put into use efficiently in all circumstances. -His 4 -year-old brother is a very talkative little boy and invades the whole sound environment. Antoine might resort to gesture in order to communicate without interference. Gesture might therefore have a compensatory function for that little boy. It is a wonderful resource to communicate efficiently in his specific environment during his multimodal, multilingual entry into language...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this casebook, like others in the Ius Commune Series, is to help uncover common roots, notwithstanding differences in approach, of the European legal systems, {{with a view to}} strengthening the common legal heritage of Europe. It covers the big legal families in the EU and contains judgments from the supreme courts and other courts of the Member States. In view of the importance of EC legislation (eg harmonisation directives and regulations) in this field, the consumer law casebook contains much material derived from Community law, such as extracts from directives (eg on unfair contract terms, distance selling, doorstep selling, product liability, unfair commercial pratices etc) and judgments of the ECJ and national court decisions. Furthermore, attention is paid to the way in which, when interpreting EC directives in the consumer field, the ECJ refers to concepts common to the legal systems of the Member States and how the courts of the Member States incorporate the concepts found in the directives (as interpreted by the ECJ) in their legal systems. The casebook also compares harmonised and pre-harmonised law, especially in the case law of the Member States. It concentrates on private law in the field of consumer protection but also addresses topics, in particular in the field of enforcement, that are primarily a matter of public law.

Using grounded theory, three themes emerged from the interviews: concerns, attitudes, and disparities. The residents expressed concerns about animal welfare, personal safety, money, and health. They held various attitudes toward domestic animals in the community, including viewing them as pets, pests, or useful commodities (products). Residents <b>expressed</b> <b>acceptance</b> {{as well as some}} anger and fear about the situation in their community.
