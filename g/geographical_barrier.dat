2500|$|The railway then {{crossed the}} Blue Mountains between 1867 and 1869. The Blue Mountains were a {{significant}} <b>geographical</b> <b>barrier</b> {{to the development}} of western New South Wales, and the crossing required significant feats of engineering for the railways, including two 'Zig Zags': one for the ascent at Lapstone, and another for the western descent. The first [...] "little" [...] zigzag line opened near Glenbrook in 1867 as part of the ascent of Lapstone Hill on a gradient of 1 in 30-33. It was built with comparatively light earthwork, although it included a substantial seven-span sandstone viaduct (the Knapsack Viaduct) built by engineer, John Whitton. By 1910, the line was replaced with a gentler alignment with 1 in 60 (1.67%) grades. The line reached Wentworth Falls in 1867 and Mount Victoria in 1868.|$|E

5000|$|Sometimes a {{distinction}} is made between a species' natural, endemic, or native range where it historically originated and lived, {{and the range}} where a species has more recently established itself.

50|$|The {{territory}} of former Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia {{is part of}} the Central European Pannonian Basin. The eastern border of the region was mostly the Danube river, while approximately one third of the western border was the Drava river. The Kopački rit natural preserve was located near the confluence of Drava and Danube, and it formed a major <b>geographical</b> <b>barrier</b> - there were no road or rail connections between Baranja and the southern parts of the territory, except through Serbia.|$|E
50|$|To {{face the}} threat from Silesia, the Russians withdrew men from East Prussia and from the front facing the Austro-Hungarians The <b>geographical</b> <b>barrier</b> that {{separated}} {{the bulk of the}} opposing armies was the Vistula River.

Eastern New Orleans's present southern boundary was realized in 1944 with the completion of a re-routing of the Intracoastal Waterway, involving the excavation of a new segment stretching east from the Industrial Canal to the Rigolets, cut through the raw swampland south of the Gentilly Ridge and north of Bayou Bienvenue.|$|E

50|$|The {{rivalry between}} the Vancouver Canucks and Calgary Flames {{has its roots}} in the stark geographic, political, and {{economic}} differences between Vancouver and Calgary, the two largest cities in Western Canada. The two cities are separated by the barrier of the Rocky Mountains, with Vancouver surrounded by the Pacific Ocean, the peaks of the Coast Mountains, and forests and Calgary sitting on the foothills bordering an expanse of flat prairie. The Rockies serve as not only a <b>geographical</b> <b>barrier</b> but a political one as well: Vancouver is a haven for the political left in Canada, strongly supportive of both the Liberal and New Democratic political parties, while Calgary has been a bastion of right-wing politics since the province of Alberta's creation and is a stronghold for the Conservative Party.|$|E
5000|$|Gryposuchines {{as a whole}} largely {{disappeared}} in the Pliocene, alongside several other gavialid taxa, due to poorly understood factors, though possibly linked to climate changes of the period. However, the Late Pleistocene or Holocene aged [...] "Gavialis" [...] papuensis from the Solomon Islands is a clear gryposuchine, separated from its closest relatives by a temporal barrier of at least 6 million years and a <b>geographical</b> <b>barrier</b> of at least 10,000 km, presumably having reached Melanesia {{in a similar fashion}} as Brachylophus and Lapitiguana iguanas, carried by Pacific oceanic currents. Found in association with dugongs and sea turtles, [...] "Gavialis" [...] papuensis was a marine animal like its ancestors, a 2-3 meter long coastoal piscivore so far known only from Murua. Like other Pleistocene gharials, it presumably was hunted to extinction by humanity.|$|E

50|$|Endorheic regions {{can occur}} in any climate but are most {{commonly}} found in desert locations. In areas where rainfall is higher, riparian erosion will generally carve drainage channels (particularly in times of flood), or cause the water level in the terminal lake to rise until it finds an outlet, breaking the enclosed endorheic hydrological system's <b>geographical</b> <b>barrier</b> and opening it to the surrounding terrain. The Black Sea was likely such a lake, having once been an independent hydrological system before the Mediterranean Sea broke through the terrain separating the two. Lake Bonneville was another such lake, overflowing its basin in the Bonneville flood. Malheur/Harney Lake in Oregon is normally cut off from drainage to the ocean, but has an outflow channel to the Malheur River that is normally dry, but flows in years of peak precipitation.|$|E
5000|$|The Poggio del Molino (or Mulino, [...] "the mill") {{north of}} Baratti must be {{associated}} with Fufluna because of a <b>geographical</b> <b>barrier,</b> not there now, once termed Lake Rimigliano. In Etruscan times it was a lagoon fringed by a barrier island (the current beach area) extending from San Vincenzo in the north southward {{to the foot of}} Poggio del Molino, where it was broken by an egress point (today the mouth of an irrigation channel). The lake went as far inland as the mines at Campiglia Marittima, an easy route for ore barges between there and the Bay of Baratti. The lagoon eventually became a swamp, disappearing in favor of agricultural land in 1832. The lagoon and its swamps would have created conditions conducive to malaria, meaning that free Etruscans who could afford it would have preferred to live on the heights.|$|E
50|$|Agriculture {{is inevitably}} {{tied up with}} climate, as Siberia's {{is not the most}} {{forgiving}} or lenient. Siberia does not get warmth from the Atlantic Ocean because of the barriers of Europe and the Ural Mountains, or from the warmer climes of Central Asia because of the mountains to its south and the mountains of the Russian Far East. Therefore, the only side of Siberia which is not blocked off by a <b>geographical</b> <b>barrier</b> is the north, opening up the area to the bitter cold of the Arctic Ocean. To add to these agricultural disadvantages, most of Siberia's soil is acidic podsol, which is not a good match for agriculture. However, there are rich, fertile black earth belts in the southwest (known as chernozem), as well as scattered pockets of rich land in other parts of southern Siberia. Despite the many drawbacks for cultivating Siberia lands, there exists a multitude of rivers and lakes that can be put to use for irrigation.|$|E
