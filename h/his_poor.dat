50|$|Massey's best accomplishments were on {{restrictor}} plate tracks where he finished {{an average of}} 10th place while <b>his</b> <b>poorest</b> races were held on tri-oval intermediate tracks; where 27th place would become his average.|$|R
5|$|Croyle {{lost all}} six games {{that he started}} for the Chiefs in the 2007 season. Despite <b>his</b> <b>poor</b> {{performance}} as a starter, Croyle's statistics {{were considered to be}} hard to evaluate. With a lack of pass protection and the absence of a stable starting running back in Larry Johnson, the Chiefs may not have seen Croyle at his best in 2007.|$|E

5|$|Reporters deemed Harding {{unlikely}} to be nominated due to <b>his</b> <b>poor</b> showing in the primaries, and relegated him to a place among the dark horses. Harding, who like the other candidates was in Chicago supervising his campaign, had finished sixth in the final public opinion poll, behind the three main candidates as well as former justice Hughes and Herbert Hoover, and only slightly ahead of Coolidge.|$|E
5|$|Sukumaran {{remained}} mostly silent {{throughout the}} proceedings and blamed amnesia for <b>his</b> <b>poor</b> recollections of events leading to his arrest.

5|$|The 2008–09 {{season was}} a {{frustrating}} one for Phaneuf, as he recorded a career-low 11 goals and 47 points, and <b>his</b> <b>poor</b> plus-minus rating of –11 led fans to question his defensive commitment. <b>His</b> <b>poor</b> season and high salary {{also led to}} speculation that Phaneuf might be traded. In spite of his struggles, Phaneuf averaged 26 minutes and 31 seconds of ice time per game, the fourth highest in the League. He missed {{the final game of}} the Flames' 2009 Stanley Cup playoff Western Quarter-final series against the Chicago Blackhawks with broken ribs, after battling a hip injury during the regular season. Flames management defended Phaneuf, claiming that the injuries he battled affected his play.|$|E

5|$|After the 2005–06 season, the Senators {{opted not}} to bring back Hašek, instead {{acquiring}} Martin Gerber to compete with Emery for the starter position. Gerber was the starter {{at the beginning of}} the season, but due to <b>his</b> <b>poor</b> play, Emery replaced him in mid-November. On February 10, 2007, Emery was suspended three games from the NHL for striking Montreal Canadiens forward Maxim Lapierre with his stick on his face after Lapierre crashed into Emery's net.|$|E
5|$|Allingham {{was awarded}} the freedom of his home town of Eastbourne by the mayor on 21 April 2006.

Aside from <b>his</b> <b>poor</b> eyesight, he was reportedly in good health, with visitors remarking on his memory and voice.|$|E
5|$|Although Constantine was {{reluctant}} to leave England, <b>his</b> <b>poor</b> health necessitated a return to Trinidad, {{but before he could}} do so he died of a heart attack, probably brought about by bronchitis, on 1 July 1971. His body was flown to Trinidad, where he received a state funeral before being buried in Arouca. He was posthumously awarded Trinidad's highest honour, the Trinity Cross.

5|$|As Austria {{was short}} of {{experienced}} military commanders, Maria Theresa released Marshall Neipperg, {{who had been}} imprisoned by her father for <b>his</b> <b>poor</b> performance in the Turkish War. Neipperg took command of the Austrian troops in March. The Austrians suffered a crushing defeat at the Battle of Mollwitz in April 1741. France drew up a plan to partition Austria between Prussia, Bavaria, Saxony and Spain. Marshall Belle-Isle joined Frederick at Olmütz. Vienna was in a panic, as none of Maria Theresa's advisors expected France to betray them. Francis Stephen urged Maria Theresa to reach a rapprochement with Prussia, as did Great Britain. Maria Theresa reluctantly agreed to negotiations.|$|E
5|$|Despite the uncomplimentary media {{coverage}} given him and <b>his</b> <b>poor</b> performance during the Independence Bowl, Bruce Smith was selected {{with the first}} overall pick in the 1985 NFL Draft. Smith was subsequently signed to a $2.6million contract by the Buffalo Bills. During the 1985 college football season, Virginia Tech struggled to rebuild from losing 20starters (10 on offense, 10 on defense) from the 1984 team, and finished with a 65 record. Air Force, meanwhile, performed extremely well, finishing with an 111 record, including a bowl-game win over the Texas Longhorns. Fisher DeBerry remained the coach of Air Force for another 22 years, eventually retiring after {{the conclusion of the}} 2006 season.|$|E
5|$|During World War I, in his {{capacity}} as chair of the New England Forestry Commission, Brown worked with the War Industries Board to send 10 sawmills abroad. The equipment went to Scotland to meet Britain's need for lumber. When the war effort in France subsequently required more than 73 million board feet of lumber per month, Brown was commissioned as a major to oversee sawmill operations there, but ultimately was not allowed to serve in France because of <b>his</b> <b>poor</b> vision, as he was partially blind in one eye.|$|E
50|$|The two front-running {{candidates}} Brown and Banks {{were estimated}} to have spent around $1 million each on their campaigns, most from bigger donors. It was commented {{that the fact that}} Banks' advertising concentrated too much on the old Auckland City area, missing out other parts of the new council areas, and especially the south, may {{have played a role in}} <b>his</b> <b>poorer</b> than expected showing.|$|R
50|$|Stanford {{defeated}} UCLA 35-17 and {{clinch the}} Pac-12 Conference North Division championship, {{setting up a}} rematch with UCLA the following week in the Pac-12 Championship Game.

He also lost his final day match to Baruto to finish on 12-3, <b>his</b> <b>poorest</b> result since January 2010. Nevertheless, it was still enough for runner-up honours, his twelfth.|$|R
5|$|His {{influence}} over Confederate strategy was lessened by <b>his</b> <b>poor</b> professional relationships with President Jefferson Davis and other senior generals and officials. In April 1865, Beauregard and his commander, General Joseph E. Johnston, convinced Davis {{and the remaining}} cabinet members that the war needed to end. Johnston surrendered {{most of the remaining}} armies of the Confederacy, including Beauregard and his men, to Major General William Tecumseh Sherman. Following his military career, Beauregard returned to Louisiana, where he served as a railroad executive, and became wealthy as a promoter of the Louisiana Lottery.|$|E
5|$|Homer, {{envious of}} Ned Flanders's new motor home, goes to Bob's RV Round-up {{to buy one}} of his own, but because of <b>his</b> <b>poor</b> credit rating, he is only {{qualified}} for a smaller dilapidated one, much to his family's disgust. Thrilled with the new RV, Homer takes his family on an excursion. Driving on remote back roads and ignoring Marge's suggestion to turn back on the main road, the Simpsons find themselves teetering over a precipice. The family escapes the RV before it plummets over the cliff, leaving themselves stranded in the wilderness.|$|E
5|$|In Bangladesh, {{scores in}} the nineties against both the President's XI and Bangladesh A were {{followed}} by a century in the first Test, and 60 in the second. He scored one half century in the three ODIs, although England only used five batsman in the comfortable victories. England played poorly against Sri Lanka, with Trescothick finding it hard to build a large innings. He attempted {{to take control of}} the match with 70 at Colombo, as England tried to get something from the series, but was also criticised for <b>his</b> <b>poor</b> catching.|$|E
