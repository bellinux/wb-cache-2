We review these algorithms and propose new secure algorithms named NewA 3, NewA 8, and NewA 5 algorithms {{with respect to the}} A 3, A 8, and A 5 algorithms. Our NewA 5 algorithm is based on block ciphers, but we also propose NewA 5 algorithm with Cipher <b>Feedback,</b> <b>Counter,</b> and Output Feedback modes to convert block cipher into stream cipher. However, stream cipher algorithms are slower than the block cipher algorithm. These new algorithms are proposed to use with a secure and efficient authentication and key agreement (AKA) protocol in the GSM network. The proposed architecture is secure against partition attack, narrow pipe attack, collision attack, interleaving attack, and man-in-the-middle attack. The security analysis of the proposed algorithms are discussed with respect to the cryptanalysis, brute force analysis, and operational analysis. We choose the NewA 3 and NewA 8 algorithms for challenge-response and key generation, respectively. Furthermore, the NewA 5 is suitable for encryption as it is efficient than the existing A 5 / 1 and A 5 / 2 algorithms. In case when stream cipher algorithms are required to use, our new algorithms, NewA 5 -CTR, NewA 5 -CFB, and NewA 5 -OFB can be used for specific applications. These algorithms are completely secure and better than the existing A 5 / 1 and A 5 / 2 in terms of resistant to attacks...|$|E
40|$|Q. What is a PLL Synthesizer? A. A {{frequency}} synthesizer allows the designer {{to generate a}} variety of output frequencies as multiples of a single reference frequency. The main application is in generating local oscillator (LO) signals for the up- and down-conversion of RF signals. The synthesizer works in a phase-locked loop (PLL), where a phase/frequency detector (PFD) compares a fed back frequency with a divided-down version of the reference frequency (Figure 1). The PFD’s output current pulses are filtered and integrated to generate a voltage. This voltage drives an external voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) to increase or decrease the output frequency so as to drive the PFD’s average output towards zero. Frequency is scaled {{by the use of}} counters. In the example shown, an ADF 4 xxx synthesizer is used with an external filter and VCO. An input reference (R) counter reduces the reference input frequency (13 MHz in this example) to PFD frequency (FPFD = FREF/R); and a feedback (N) counter reduces the output frequency for comparison with the scaled reference frequency at the PFD. At equilibrium, the two frequencies are equal, and the output frequency is N � FPFD. The <b>feedback</b> <b>counter</b> is a dual-modulus prescaler type, with A and B counters (N = BP + A, where P is the prescale value). Figure 2 shows a typical application in a superheterodyne receiver. Base station and handset LOs are the most common application, but synthesizers are also found in low frequency clock generators (ADF 4001), wireless LANs (5. 8 GHz), radar systems, and collision-avoidance systems (ADF 4106). Q. What are the key performance parameters to be considered in selecting a PLL synthesizer? A. The major ones are: phase noise, reference spurs, and lock time.

Moreover, anandamide release was increased eightfold over baseline after local administration of the D 2 -like (D 2, D 3, D 4) dopamine receptor agonist quinpirole, a response that was prevented by the D 2 -like receptor antagonist raclopride. Administration of the D 1 -like (D 1, D 5) receptor agonist SKF 38393 had no such effect. These results suggest that functional interactions between endocannabinoid and dopaminergic systems may contribute to striatal signaling. In agreement with this hypothesis, pretreatment with the cannabinoid antagonist SR 141716 A enhanced the stimulation of motor behavior elicited by systemic administration of quinpirole.

30|$|In some sense, this {{behavior}} is {{an artifact of}} the model used—perfect integration is only possible if the <b>feedback</b> perfectly <b>counters</b> the decay of the firing rate over a range of different rates, which is possible in this model because rate increases linearly with feedback and feedback increases linearly with rate. However, such a balance is also achievable with nonlinear rate/feedback relationships if they are locally linear over the relevant range of firing rates. In particular, if the firing rate is a sigmoidal function of input and the eigenvalue of firing rate dynamics near a fixed point is near zero, {{the upper and lower}} rate limits act to control runaway firing rates while the system acts as an integrator in the neighborhood of the fixed point. In [8], we show that a recurrent network of biophysically detailed neurons with sigmoidal activation curves can be robustly tuned by dual homeostasis to act as an integrator.|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2005 Symmetric key block ciphers, such as AES, {{are well}} known and {{frequently}} used. There are five confidentiality modes of operation that are currently recommended for use with a symmetric key block cipher algorithm: Electronic Codebook (ECB), Cipher Block Chaining (CBC), Cipher Feedback (CFB), Output <b>Feedback</b> (OFB), and <b>Counter</b> (CTR). This paper investigates extending the block cipher modes of operation using multiple symmetric keys. Unlike traditional multiple-key encryption techniques, each block of plaintext is encrypted using a single key. The key used to encrypt a block is selected by the corresponding entry of a sequence. Each sequence entry {{represents one of the}} independent keys in the set. This paper also explores a variety of applications of this technique.

40|$|The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a {{symmetric}} key block cipher {{approved by the}} National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). AES replaced the Data Encryption Standard (DES) as a standard encryption algorithm within the United States government. It is widely used in both software and hardware applications and transactions. Different confidentiality modes of operation allow a {{symmetric key}} block cipher to provide additional data confidentiality by altering the output in respect to previously processed input data. These modes include Cipher Block Chaining, Cipher Feedback, Output <b>Feedback</b> and <b>Counter</b> modes. Electronic Codebook (ECB) mode does not enhance the confidentiality of the original cipher. This thesis presents an implementation of AES on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA). The design improves upon similar implementations that only employ ECB mode by supporting all five confidentiality modes of operation. The unified design supports all applicable key sizes and offers competitive throughput and resource utilization compared to designs lacking additional confidentiality modes. The design occupies 7452 slices of a Xilinx Virtex-II Pro XC 2 VP 50 and features a maximum clock speed of 56. 3 MHz.

40|$|International audienceThe now commonplace {{multi-core}} chips have introduced, by design, a deep {{hierarchy of}} memory and cache banks within parallel computers as a tradeoff between the user friendliness of shared memory on the one side, and memory access scalability and efficiency on the other side. However, to get high performance out of such machines requires a dynamic mapping of application tasks and data onto the underlying architecture. Moreover, depending on the application behavior, this mapping should favor cache affinity, memory bandwidth, computation synchrony, {{or a combination of}} these. The great challenge is then to perform this hardware-dependent mapping in a portable, abstract way. To meet this need, we propose a new, hierarchical approach to the execution of OpenMP threads onto multicore machines.

40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} a {{recently}} proposed {{mode of operation}} for block ciphers which we refer to as statistical cipher feedback (SCFB) mode. SCFB mode configures the block cipher as a keystream generator {{for use in a}} stream cipher such that it has the property of statistical self-synchronization, thereby allowing the stream cipher to recover from slips in the communications channel. Statistical self-synchronization involves feeding back ciphertext to the input of the keystream generator similar to the conventional cipher feedback (CFB) mode of block ciphers, except that the feedback only occurs when a special pattern is recognized in the ciphertext. In the paper, we examine the efficiency, resynchronization, and error propagation characteristics of SCFB and compare these to the conventional modes of CFB, output <b>feedback</b> (OFB), and <b>counter</b> mode. In particular, we study these characteristics of SCFB {{as a function of the}} synchronization pattern size. We conclude that, although it can take significantly longer to resynchronize, SCFB mode can be used to provide self-synchronizing implementations for stream ciphers that are much more efficient than conventional CFB mode and that have error propagation characteristics similar to CFB mode.

We have previously shown that EKLF drives transcription of the gene for a second KLF, basic Kruppel-like factor, or KLF 3. We have now tested the in vivo role of KLF 3 in erythroid cells by examining Klf 3 knockout mice. KLF 3 -deficient adults exhibit a mild compensated anemia, including enlarged spleens, increased red pulp, and {{a higher percentage of}} erythroid progenitors, together with elevated reticulocytes and abnormal erythrocytes in the peripheral blood.

40|$|Reputation {{systems have}} the {{potential}} of {{improving the quality of}} on-line markets by identifying fraudulent users and subsequently dealing with these users can be prevented. The behaviour of participants involved in e-commerce can be recorded and then this information made available to potential transaction partners to make decisions to choose a suitable counterpart. Unfortunately current reputation systems suffer from various vulnerabilities. Solutions for many of these problems will be discussed. One of the major threats is that of unfair feedback. A large number of negative or positive feedbacks could be submitted to a particular user with the aim to either downgrade or upgrade the user's reputation. As a result the produced reputation does not reflect the user's true trustworthiness. To overcome this threat a variation of Bayesian Reputation system is proposed. The proposed scheme is based on the subjective logic framework proposed Josang et al. [65]. The impact of unfair <b>feedback</b> is <b>countered</b> through some systematic approaches proposed in the scheme. Lack of anonymity for participants leads to reluctance to provide negative feedback. A novel solution for anonymity of feedback providers is proposed to allow participants to provide negative feedback when appropriate without fear of retaliation. The solution is based on several primitive cryptographic mechanisms; e-cash, designated verifier proof and knowledge proof. In some settings it is desirable for the reputation owner to control the distribution of its own reputation and to disclose this at its discretion to the intended parties. To realize this, a solution based on a certificate mechanism is proposed. This solution allows the reputation owner to keep the certificate and to distribute its reputation while not being able to alter that information without detection. The proposed solutions cater for two modes of reputation systems: centralised and decentralised. The provision of an off-line reputation system is discussed by proposing a new solution using certificates. This is achieved through the delegation concept and a variant of digital signature schemes known as proxy signatures. The thesis presents a security architecture of reputation systems which consists of different elements to safeguard reputation systems from malicious activities. Elements incorporated into this architecture include privacy, verifiability and availability. The architecture also introduces Bayesian approach to counter security threat posed by reputation systems. This means the proposed security architecture in the thesis is a combination of two prominent approaches, namely, Bayesian and cryptographic, to provide security for reputation systems. The proposed security architecture {{can be used as a}} basic framework for further development in identifying and incorporating required elements so that a total security solution for reputation systems can be achieved...|$|R
40|$|University of Minnesota M. S. thesis. May 2016. Major: Civil Engineering. Advisor: Lauren Linderman. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); viii, 104 pages. Modern structural control systems use centralized, wired sensor <b>feedback</b> to impart <b>counter</b> forces based on {{measurement of the}} response. However, centralized systems can be sensitive to sensor failure, controller failure, and the reliability of sensor links. The recent study of wireless control systems has encouraged decentralized control approaches to overcome wireless structural control challenges, including limiting the wireless communication required and the associated slow sampling rate and time delays in the control system. Decentralized control offers the additional advantages of multiple independent controllers and small subsets of measurement feedback. Previous decentralized structural control algorithms, both Ad-Hoc and Heuristic, enforce a spatial sparsity pattern during the design, which is assumed a priori. Therefore, the optimal feedback structure is not considered in the design. This work explores a decentralized optimal LQR design algorithm (LQRSP) where the sparsity of the feedback gain is incorporated into the objective function. The control approach is compared to previous decentralized control techniques on 5 - and 20 -Story control benchmark structures fitted with active or semi-active systems. Additionally, the sparsity and control requirements are compared to centralized designs to gain insight on the overall performance of sparse feedback systems. The LQRSP program and its additional parameters are explored more fully to make informed control decisions, further enhancing the decentralized control design. The optimal sparse feedback design offers the best balance of performance, measurement feedback, and control effort, while clearly highlighting important feedback control measurements. Additionally, the feedback structure identified is not easily identifiable a priori in the reduced order model of the 20 -story structure, highlighting the significance of particular measurements in this feedback framework. To {{bridge the gap between}} simulation and reality, the LQRSP design is extended to a discrete time simulation system to incorporate wireless transmission time as well as sensor and estimation noise.

40|$|The {{continued}} {{advances in}} service-oriented computing and global communications {{have created a}} strong technology push for online information sharing and business transactions among enterprises, organizations and individuals. While these communities offer enormous opportunities, they also present potential threats {{due to a lack}} of trust. Reputation systems provide a way for building trust through social control by harnessing the community knowledge in the form of feedback. Although feedback-based reputation systems help community participants decide who to trust and encourage trustworthy behavior, they also introduce vulnerabilities due to potential manipulations by dishonest or malicious players. Therefore, building an effective and resilient reputation system remains a big challenge for the wide deployment of service-oriented computing. This dissertation proposes a decentralized reputation based trust supporting framework called PeerTrust, focusing on models and techniques for resilient reputation management against feedback aggregation related vulnerabilities, especially feedback sparsity with potential feedback manipulation, feedback oscillation, and loss of feedback privacy. This dissertation research has made three unique contributions for building a resilient decentralized reputation system. First, we develop a core reputation model with important trust parameters and a coherent trust metric for quantifying and comparing the trustworthiness of participants. We develop decentralized strategies for implementing the trust model in an efficient and secure manner. Second, we develop techniques countering potential vulnerabilities associated with feedback aggregation, including a similarity inference scheme to <b>counter</b> <b>feedback</b> sparsity with potential feedback manipulations, and a novel metric based on Proportional, Integral, and Derivative (PID) model to handle strategic oscillating behavior of participants. Third but not the least, we develop privacy-conscious trust management models and techniques to address the loss of feedback privacy. We develop a set of novel probabilistic decentralized privacy-preserving computation protocols for important primitive operations. We show how feedback aggregation can be divided into individual steps that utilize above primitive protocols through an example reputation algorithm based on kNN classification. We perform experimental evaluations for each of the schemes we proposed and show the feasibility, effectiveness, and cost of our approach. The PeerTrust framework presents an important step forward with respect to developing attack-resilient reputation trust systems. Ph. D.
