Our distributed directory service introduces tree-structured <b>file</b> <b>identifiers</b> that support dynamically partitioning metadata at arbitrary granularity, recursive path leases for scalably maintaining name-space consistency, and a protocol for consistently performing operations on files managed by separate machines. It also mitigates metadata hotspots via file-field leases and the new mechanism of disjunctive leases.

5000|$|When {{multiple}} MDTs are configured for a filesystem, {{the client}} determines on which MDT a given filename resides on by looking up the 128-bit Lustre <b>File</b> <b>Identifier</b> (FID, {{composed of the}} Sequence number and Object ID) of the parent directory in the FID Location Database (FLDB), which maps the Sequence to a specific MDT. Once the MDT of the parent directory is determined, further directory operations (for non-striped directories) take place exclusively on that MDT, avoiding contention between MDTs. For striped directories, the per-directory layout stored on the parent directory provides a hash function and list of MDT objects across which the directory is distributed. The filename is hashed and mapped to a specific MDT shard, which will handle further operations on that file in an identical manner to a non-striped directory. For readdir (...) operations, the entries from each directory shard are returned interleaved in hash order so that a single 64-bit cookie {{can be used to}} determine the current offset within the directory.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — P 2 P file-sharing {{systems have}} indexes, which users search to find {{locations}} of desired titles. In the index poisoning attack, the attacker inserts massive numbers of bogus records into the index {{for a set}} of targeted titles. As a result, when a user searches for a targeted title, the index returns bogus results, such as bogus <b>file</b> <b>identifiers,</b> bogus IP addresses, or bogus port numbers. In this paper we first show that both structured and unstructured P 2 P file-sharing systems are highly vulnerable to the index poisoning attack. We then develop a novel and efficient methodology for estimating index poisoning levels and pollution levels in file-sharing systems. The methodology is efficient in that involves neither the downloading nor the analysis of binary content files. We deploy data-harvesting platforms for FastTrack, an unstructured file-sharing system, and Overnet, a DHT-based file-sharing system. Applying our methodology to harvested data, we find that index poisoning is pervasive in both systems. We also outline a distributed blacklisting procedure for countering the index poisoning and pollution attacks. I...|$|R
50|$|The SF_EUIMID has {{the unique}} ability to {{override}} the phone’s own MEID in signaling. This is controlled by a flag inside the R-UIM stored in bit 2 of the UsgInd (Usage Indicator) <b>elementary</b> <b>file</b> (EF). This may {{make it easier to}} provision a R-UIM that is manufactured without other unique identifiers (such as MIN or IMSI). The tradeoff is that the phone hardware cannot be easily identified. This tradeoff was removed in 2008 by the ability to specify MEID or EUIMID in OTASP signaling and in 2009 by the addition of these options to the CDMA air interface StatusRequest message. The term MEID_ME is used to distinguish the hardware identity of the phone from the MEID protocol element that may be the EUIMID.|$|R

30|$|In this scenario, the {{following}} process happens: (1) The document: The data owner encrypts the plaintext medical data file using a symmetric encryption method {{to secure the}} privacy of the medical data before outsourcing the file, and sends the key to the authorized patient user via the secure channel. Without a key, it is difficult for the medical cloud server or attacker to decrypt the ciphertext document. (2) Index: In each index, the keyed hash function guarantees {{the privacy of the}} keyword; the medical data <b>file</b> <b>identifier</b> is the indicator of the associated ciphertext document and does not reveal related information. Therefore, the privacy of the index can be guaranteed. (3) Query: In trapdoors, each query keyword is encrypted by a keyed hash function, so its privacy security is guaranteed. (4) Related verification information: This scheme inserts encrypted keywords in the Bloom filter. The medical cloud server or attacker cannot know the relevant information of the hash function without a key and cannot analyze the Bloom filter. Therefore, the Bloom filter is privacy-safe. The message authentication code is obtained through the function MAC, and only the user with the key can use it to verify the result.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT This paper {{presents}} and evaluates the storage management and caching in PAST, a large-scale peer-to-peer persistent storage utility. PAST {{is based on}} a self-organizing, Internetbased overlay network of storage nodes that cooperatively route file queries, store multiple replicas of files, and cache additional copies of popular files. In the PAST system, storage nodes and files are each assigned uniformly distributed identifiers, and replicas of a file are stored at nodes whose identifier matches most closely the <b>file's</b> <b>identifier.</b> This statistical assignment of files to storage nodes approximately balances the number of files stored on each node. However, non-uniform storage node capacities and file sizes require more explicit storage load balancing to permit graceful behavior under high global storage utilization; likewise, non-uniform popularity of files requires caching to minimize fetch distance and to balance the query load. We present and evaluate PAST, with an emphasis on its storage management and caching system. Extensive tracedriven experiments show that the system minimizes fetch distance, that it balances the query load for popular files, and that it displays graceful degradation of performance as the global storage utilization increases beyond 95 %. 1...|$|R

The remaining chapters each focus on a specific theme. For each theme (e. g. ‘fonts’, ‘password-protection’, etc.), its relevance to digital preservation and accessibility is explained, and the important features that are associated with it are discussed. The risks that are associated with each theme and the implementation history of all discussed features are summarised in separate tables. This will hopefully facilitate getting an overview of the most important risks and understanding the ‘history of PDF’.

40|$|International audienceBitTorrent is a fast, popular, P 2 P filesharing {{application}} {{focused on}} fast propagation of content. Its trackerless approach uses a DHT based on Kademlia {{to search for}} sources when the hash of the metadata of the content to transfer is known. On the other hand, the eMule network use the old ED 2 K protocol for filesharing including a system of priorized queues, but indexation is done through a solid Kademlia based DHT, named Kad. The Kad DHT stands for a search engine, wich provides an extra level to map keywords to <b>file</b> <b>identifiers.</b> We propose an hybrid approach, compatible with both P 2 P file-sharing networks, which has the Kad advantages on indexation and the BitTorrent throughput for transfer while maintaining backward compatibility with both of these networks. To validate our proposal we developed a prototype which supports content indexation provided by the Kad network {{and is able to}} transfer files using the BitTorrent protocol without losing compatibility. Using this prototype, we measured the propagation of new content in clusters of aMule clients, BitTorrent clients, hybrid clients, and a mix of them. Comparing the propagation velocity of content propagation in each scenario, we conclude the development of a full implementation would significantly benefit the users.
