50|$|Grade-recovery curves {{are useful}} tools in {{weighing}} the trade-off {{of producing a}} high grade of concentrate while maintaining as low of a recovery rate as possible, two important aspects of froth flotation.

A disadvantage to these curves is that they can only compare the grade-recovery relations of a specific <b>feed</b> <b>grade</b> and feed rate. If a company has a variance of feed grades and rates used (an extremely common occurrence) in their froth flotation process, grade-recovery curves for every pairing of <b>feed</b> <b>grade</b> and recovery rate would have to be constructed in order to provide meaningful information to the plant.|$|E

Eight 24 -mo-old rumen-fistulated castrated Nellore steers (average body weight = 418. 0 ± 40. 0 kg) were used in a replicated 4 × 4 Latin square design. Animals were randomly distributed to receive one of the following diets: no urea inclusion; 1. 0 % inclusion of <b>feed</b> <b>grade</b> urea in the diet (dry matter [DM] basis); 1. 0 % inclusion of slow-release urea 1 in the diet (DM basis); and 1. 0 % inclusion of slow-release urea 2 in the diet (DM basis). Slow-release urea 2 had a similar composition to that of slow-release urea 1 and differed in that it contained 2. 95 % sulfur. A high-forage diet was provided (75 % of total DM) and corn silage was used as the forage source. Diets with urea had increased crude protein (CP) intake, and CP and total digestible nutrients total tract digestion. Urea sources increased ruminal concentrations of ammonia nitrogen and acetate, and decreased butyrate concentrations. The polymer coated urea did not alter ruminal fermentation when compared with <b>feed</b> <b>grade</b> urea. Diets did not affect the energy balance of steers. <b>Feed</b> <b>grade</b> urea presented greater microbial protein synthesis than polymer coated slow-release urea.

40|$|PUTF ProjectAfter {{studying}} the direction work in mineral liberation has taken {{for the past}} twenty years, {{and in particular the}} more recent five to ten years, it has become apparent to me that at least for the magnetic taconite process, the use of the Davis tube ideal magnetic separator on individual size fractions of process feed can provide useful data on liberation. A study made by the writer 1 of process feed samples to twelve magnetite concentrators indicated a reasonable conformity between Davis tube concentrate magnetite grade and size fraction mean particle size relationships and what was predicted using the idealized "random liberation model" formulation 2 with appropriate specific gravities for magnetite and waste minerals. This then suggests that the magnetic taconite liberation behavior can be characterized by three parameters (given the two specific gravities) : (1) magnetite ore feed grade; (2) an average mineral grain size; and (3) an average size fraction particle size. Of the twelve sample sets noted above, only two indicated significant deviations from the shape of the concentrate grade-particle size relationships displayed by the "random model. " A BASIC computer program (LIBFIT. BAS) has therefore been written to obtain the best fit of the two parameters: magnetite <b>feed</b> <b>grade</b> of the ore and average mineral grain size for the "random model," to Davis tube data on size fractions of ground taconite. The program is relatively simple in concept, in that it first seeks a value of average mineral grain size, which minimizes the sum of squares of differences in the measured and calculated Davis tube concentrate grades for an estimated magnetite <b>feed</b> <b>grade</b> of the ore. It then holds the optimum average mineral grain size constant and searches for the optimum magnetite <b>feed</b> <b>grade</b> for that mineral grain size. It continues to switch back and forth, looking at first mineral grain size and then magnetite ore <b>feed</b> <b>grade</b> for some 18 iterations, which then provides a best fit estimate of the two parameters.

40|$|M. Tech. Maize (Zea may) is {{the third}} most {{important}} cereal in the world serving various purpose of economic importance especially as staple diet to the Africans and as {{a major component of}} animal feed. Unfortunately, this commodity serves as a suitable substrate for pest and fungi development which may result in the production of mycotoxins. Mycotoxins are secondary metabolites of varying chemical structures produced by filamentous fungi, which may contaminate agricultural commodities either in the field or at storage. Mycotoxins have been implicated to cause several diseases in humans and animals ranging from acute to chronic. This study was designed to determine and quantify the occurrence and levels of mycotoxins in South African <b>feed</b> <b>grade</b> commercial maize. A total of 40 commercial <b>feed</b> <b>grade</b> maize samples were randomly sampled from two factory sites (Factory A and Factory B) of a commercial feed company source from known South African maize producers. The samples were screened for fungi using the conventional method while the mycotoxin screening and quantification was done by thin layer chromatography (TLC) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). In addition to TLC and HPLC, VICAM/HPLC, VICAM/fluorometer, enzyme linked immuno-sorbent assay (ELISA) and lateral flow method were used for determination and quantification of fumonisins. The mycological investigation revealed the occurrence of several fungal species of Fusarium, Aspergillus and Penicillium with Fusarium being the most prevalent (100 %). Among the Fusarium spp. were F. verticillioides, F. proliferatum, F. oxysporum and F. graminearum, F. subglutinans, F. chlamydosporum, F. solani, F. poae and F. dimerum. Fusarium verticillioides and F. proliferatum had the highest incidence rate of 89 % and 73 %, respectively, followed by F. oxysporum (65 %) and F. graminearum (48 %). The rate of occurrence of A. fumigatus, A. flavus and Penicillium spp. were 45 %, 43 % and 38 %, respectively. Further analysis on the isolated fungal strains proved that over 50 % of the fungal spp. were toxigenic. Mycotoxicological study on the samples revealed that the samples were contaminated with fumonisins (FB), aflatoxins B (AFB), ochratoxin A (OTA) and zearalenone (ZEA) on TLC. Mycotoxins levels in the samples were confirmed on HPLC, with the levels ranging from 0. 064 - 1. 035 ppm for FB, 0 - 0. 762 ppm for iii AFB, 0 - 0. 194 ppm for OTA and 0 - 0. 135 ppm for ZEA. There was no significance difference on mycotoxin concentration in the <b>feed</b> <b>grade</b> sample between the two factory sites. Results obtained from the VICAM methods, ELISA and lateral flow method for FB determination showed 100 % incidence rate of the <b>feed</b> <b>grade</b> maize samples similar to that observed on HPLC. Although ELISA (0. 190 - 2. 450 ppm) and lateral flow method (0. 350 - 2. 700 ppm) showed higher concentration of FB compared to HPLC (0. 064 - 1. 035 ppm), recovery analysis on sample using lateral flow gave high value (85 %) comparable to HPLC. Further analyses were performed to determine the cytotoxic potential of the <b>feed</b> <b>grade</b> maize samples using the fumonisin fraction (FFraction). The data obtained showed that the <b>feed</b> <b>grade</b> maize extracts were toxic on human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (HPBMC) and the degree of effect on the cells is dependent on the concentration of FB and the duration of exposure.

The {{control and the}} millet cultivar diets were fed to Fayoumi pure breed birds during the respective starter, grower and laying periods. The <b>feeding</b> of <b>graded</b> levels of these millet cultivars did not have significant effects on mean total feed intake or total liveweight gain of the experimental birds during the starter period, while these effects were significant (P< 0. 05) during the growing period. Some statistical differences in weekly feed intake (P< 0. 05) and weekly liveweight gain (P< 0. 05) were obtained during the last weeks of the growing period. There was a general pattern of increased feed consumption from the control sorghum-based diet and the diets containing graded levels of Baioda millet cultivars. The mean total liveweight gain during the starter period was highest on the Heriheri millet diets, followed by Baioda millet cultivar diet and was least on the control sorghum-based diet. This effect was reversed during the growing period, where the birds fed the control and Baioda millet cultivar diets attained higher liveweight gain than the birds fed on the Heriheri millet diets. The experiment revealed marked sex differences in liveweight gain, during the growing period in favour of the male birds, irrespective of the dietary treatments. Similarly the dietary treatments did not have significant effects on liveweight at point of lay (18 weeks of age). <b>Feeding</b> <b>graded</b> levels of both millet cultivars resulted in a significant (P < 0. 05) reduction in the thyroid gland weight, but without differences in relative thyroid weight, triiodothyronine (T 3) or thyroxin (T 4) serum concentrations, while a significant (P< 0. 05) increase in the thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) was observed for the birds fed the control sorghum-based diet. There were also no histological changes in the thyroid gland tissues. There was a significant (P< 0. 05) improvement in egg production rate, egg mass production and feed conversion efficiency of the birds fed the millet cultivars diets {{compared to that of}} the birds fed the sorghumbased diet. Feeding millet cultivars also resulted in improved egg weight, eggshell thickness, egg specific gravity and egg yolk colour score. The fertility and hatchability of the eggs laid by the birds fed both millet cultivars were significantly (P< 0. 01) improved compared to those of the eggs of the birds fed the sorghum-based diet. The diets containing Heriheri millet cultivar exhibited significant (P< 0. 01) improvement in all hatching parameters compared to those of the diets containing Baioda millet cultivar. A significant positive correlation between egg production rate and the hatchability of the egg set was observed. There {{were no significant differences in}} hatched chick weights, but a significant positive correlation between egg weight and hatched chick weight was observed. The mortality of the experimental birds was very low during the starter and growing periods, and there was no mortality during the laying period. It can be generally implied that, under the conditions of this study, the experimental millet cultivars can be utilized effectively in layers and breeders diets to support satisfactory egg production and hatchability...|$|R
30|$|In this study, <b>feeding</b> <b>graded</b> {{levels of}} DLP {{decreased}} DFI in broiler chickens. This lower feed intake {{might be due}} to the high pectin content of DLP. Similar results have been observed when chickens are given graded dietary levels of pectin (Langhout and Schutte 1996; Langhout et al. 1999). Pectin is a kind of soluble fiber that increases the intestinal viscosity and results in the enhanced retention time of the feed in gastrointestinal tract. Further, a negative correlation exists between the feed retention time and DFI in chickens of early ages (Almirall and Esteve-Garcia 1994). On the contrary, Chaudry et al. (2004) have shown that chickens receiving citrus peel had similar feed consumption to the birds in CON group. Otherwise, the increased DFI of broilers has been observed after dietary inclusion of citrus pulp or DLP (Mourão et al. 2008; Nobakht 2013). The lower DFI of chickens in our study might lead to reduced DWG and BW following supplementation with DLP. One more reason is possibly the decrease in nutrient digestibility, since soluble fiber alleviates diffusion rate of digestive enzymes into digesta and therefore decreases the nutrient utilization (Annison 1993). Different DFI and DWG of chickens consequently resulted in deteriorated FCR across various periods of production.|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 80 male Ross 308 broiler {{chickens}} {{were used in}} this study to quantify the response and interrelationship of bird growth performance, dietary nitrogen corrected apparent metabolisable energy (AMEn), and nutrient digestibility as a result of <b>feeding</b> <b>graded</b> levels of supplementary myo-inositol (MYO) with and without exogenous phytase (PHY). Supplementation of diet that was formulated to be insufficient in available Phosphorus (P) with graded levels of MYO improved daily weigh gain (WG) and AMEn intake (P< 0. 05; quadratic) and linearly reduced (P< 0. 05) the concentration and the secretion of sialic acid (SA) in excreta. Supplementation with PHY improved (P< 0. 05) dietary dry matter (DMD) and nitrogen (ND) digestibility coefficients. Dietary phosphorus digestibility (PD) increased with PHY addition as expected but the effect was much more pronounced in the low MYO group compared with high MYO diets as described by the interaction (P< 0. 05). The interaction showed that increasing MYO content had no effect in the absence of PHY but it depressed P digestibility in the diets containing PHY. It can be concluded that dietary MYO improves bird growth and possibly intestinal health of broiler chickens. Dietary supplementation with either MYO or PHY may improve growth of chickens although these effects may not always be additive...|$|R
