But in May 1696 Temple made proposals which induced Swift to return to Moor Park, where he was employed in preparing Temple's memoirs and correspondence for publication, and in supporting the side taken by Temple in the Letters of Phalaris controversy by writing The Battle of the Books, which was, however, not published until 1704.

40|$|Weather {{influences}} {{all living}} organisms, especially wild animals. In {{the case of}} birds, inclement weather conditions may affect them during migration and feeding that could cause mass mortality in the same species or many related species. This paper describes an incidence of mass deaths of the Common <b>House</b> <b>Swift</b> Apus affinis at Thengumarahada Village of Nilgiris, Tamil Nadu, southern India during February 2008. The samples of the dead birds were sent for toxicological and bacteriological examination at Southern Regional Disease Diagnostic Laboratory, Bangalore. Spot post mortems were also conducted by forest veterinarians. Results of the diagnostic analysis revealed that mass mortality {{might be due to}} extreme weather conditions leading to acute dehydration, shock and death. The postmortem reports say that the crop and the gastro intestinal tract (GI) were found empty in all the cases, suggesting starvation. We thus conclude that unseasonal heavy rains and non availability of food could have led to hypothermia and starvation of birds over a long period resulting in mass mortality...|$|E

40|$|The National Parks Board of Singapore {{has plans}} to link up all urban parks and native {{habitats}} through a park-connector network. Although this connector network has already been implemented, it will take about 30 years to complete. We surveyed birds in 10 linear areas in Singapore. Of these linear areas, two were already completed park connectors, six were parks, and two were located in rainforest edges. We assessed and compared bird communities among these 10 sites. We also determined how the characteristics of these linear areas affect bird diversity and abundance. One of the established park connectors, the Ulu Pandan Canal, attracted 67 bird species, and its bird community was similar to a linear park (Kent Ridge Park). The other recently completed connector, the Jurong Canal, had only 37 bird species. Based on characteristics (percentage of area covered by built environment, open space, vegetation and water) within and surrounding the sites, we found that with increases in built areas, higher abundance of human-associated bird species (e. g. <b>House</b> <b>Swift,</b> Apus nipalensis and Common Myna, Acridotheres javanicus) was found at the sites. Similarly, the increase in vegetation cover (both native and managed) increased the abundance of parkland and rainforest-associated bird species (e. g. Greater Green Leafbird, Chloropsis sonnerati and Short-tailed Babbler, Malacocincla malaccensis). For completed connectors, landscape and management planners should preserve the existing diversity of habitats surrounding the connectors. Similar steps should be taken {{for the design of}} future park connectors. © 1999 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
