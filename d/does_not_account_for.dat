5|$|A 1998 {{estimate}} {{suggests the}} total annual worldwide consumption of Boletus edulis and {{closely related species}} (B.aereus, B.pinophilus, and B.reticulatus) to be between 20,000 and 100,000 tons. Approximately 2,700tonnes (3,000tons) were sold in France, Italy and Germany in 1988, according to official figures. The true amount consumed far exceeds this, as it <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>account</b> <b>for</b> informal sales or consumption by collectors. They are widely exported and sold in dried form, reaching countries where they do not occur naturally, such as Australia and New Zealand. The autonomous community of Castile and León in Spain produces 7,700tonnes (8,500tons) annually. In autumn, the price of porcini in the Northern Hemisphere typically ranges between $20 and $80dollars per kilogram, although in New York in 1997, the scarcity of fruit bodies elevated the wholesale price to over $200 per kilogram.|$|E
5|$|After {{the home}} {{was placed on the}} National Register of Historic Places in 1974 (the result of an {{application}} by an Eldon farmer), the owner refurbished the house, installing an indoor bathroom and electricity and restoring the windows and wallpaper. Local politicians believed such work coupled with a new museum and education center could provide a major boost to local tourism—one state senator hoped for as many as 100,000 visitors per year. After the house's owner eventually turned over the property to the State Historical Society of Iowa in 1991, an effort was made to move the house to Living History Farms outside Des Moines, but Eldonians fought to keep it within their city limits. The house was renovated in 1992, with boosters hoping to see the house become a pop-culture tourism attraction, much like the Field of Dreams site in similarly rural Dyersville. Today the American Gothic House Center hosts approximately 15,000 visitors per year, which <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>account</b> <b>for</b> additional after-hours visitors.|$|E
5|$|The {{lifespan}} of the Columbian mammoth {{is thought}} to have been about 80 years. The lifespan of a mammal is related to its size; Columbian mammoths are larger than modern elephants, which have a lifespan of about 60 years. The age of a mammoth can be roughly determined by counting the growth rings of its tusks when viewed in cross section. However, ring-counting <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>account</b> <b>for</b> a mammoth's early years; early growth is represented in tusk tips, which are usually worn away. In the remainder of the tusk each major line represents a year, with weekly and daily lines found in between. Dark bands correspond to summer, making it possible to determine the season in which a mammoth died. Tusk growth slowed when foraging became more difficult, such as during illness or when a male mammoth was banished from the herd (male elephants live with their herds until about the age of ten).|$|E

25|$|Plant {{nutrition}} is {{the study}} of the chemical elements that are necessary for plant growth. There are several principles that apply to plant nutrition.

25|$|Approximately {{twice as}} many women as men are {{prescribed}} benzodiazepines. It is believed that this is largely because men typically turned to alcohol to cope with stress and women to prescription drugs.

25|$|Many {{nourishment}} {{projects are}} advocated via economic impact studies {{that rely on}} additional tourist expenditure. This approach is however unsatisfactory. First, nothing proves that these expenditures are incremental (they could shift expenditures from other nearby areas). Second, economic impact <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>account</b> <b>for</b> costs and benefits for all economic agents, as cost benefit analysis does. Techniques for incorporating nourishment projects into flood insurance costs and disaster assistance remain controversial.|$|E
25|$|Such {{statements}} of the first law for closed systems assert the existence of internal energy {{as a function of}} state defined in terms of adiabatic work. Thus heat is not defined calorimetrically or as due to temperature difference.

The Gallup polls further show that household firearm ownership currently exceeds 40% and that the long-term trend is {{a sharp decline in}} polling for stricter gun control laws. Lastly, Gallup polling has consistently been over 65% against, when asking whether there should be bans on possession of handguns.|$|E
25|$|The {{physical}} processes and protocols of DNA sequencing {{have continued to}} evolve, largely driven by advancements in bio-chemical methods, instrumentation, and automation techniques.

25|$|It {{has been}} demonstrated, however, that resultatives exist {{independently}} of the perfect in sentences like I turned this offer down, creating the need to reexamine the role of resultatives. To address this, it has been claimed that the resultative expresses both a state and the preceding action it has resulted from. This emphasizes that the resultative describes how a state was acted upon. Therefore, it must use the passive form. However, this analysis <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>account</b> <b>for</b> phrases such as I turned this offer down, which uses the active rather than the passive voice.|$|E

25|$|Hirsch {{intended}} the h-index {{to address the}} main disadvantages of other bibliometric indicators, such as total number of papers or total number of citations. Total number of papers <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>account</b> <b>for</b> the quality of scientific publications, while total number of citations can be disproportionately affected by participation in a single publication of major influence (for instance, methodological papers proposing successful new techniques, methods or approximations, which can generate {{a large number of}} citations), or having many publications with few citations each.

25|$|Event-driven SOA {{is a form}} of service-oriented {{architecture}} (SOA), combining the intelligence and proactiveness of event-driven architecture with the organizational capabilities found in service offerings. Before event-driven SOA, the typical SOA platform orchestrated services centrally, through pre-defined business processes, assuming that what should have already been triggered is defined in a business process. This older approach (sometimes called SOA 1.0) <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>account</b> <b>for</b> events that occur across, or outside of, specific business processes. Thus complex events, in which a pattern of activities—both non-scheduled and scheduled—should trigger a set of services is not accounted for in traditional SOA 1.0 architecture.|$|E
25|$|The Philippine Statistics Department <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>account</b> <b>for</b> {{the racial}} {{background}} or ancestry of an individual. The official population {{of all types}} of mestizos (Asian, American, etc.) that reside inside and outside of the Philippines remains unknown. Although a study provided by Stanford University found that European introgression into the Philippines was evident due to the period of colonization, it only genotyped 28 individuals from the Philippines. Results from such a small sample cannot be used with high confidence to characterize a population of 92 million persons. Old Spanish censuses state that as much as 33.5% or one third {{of the population of the}} main island of Luzon had full or partial Hispanic or Latino descent.|$|E
