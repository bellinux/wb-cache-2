500|$|At {{the tower}} a {{temporary}} <b>eyebolt</b> was screwed into the [...] capsule, and a chain hoist {{was used to}} lower the capsule into the gadget. As the capsule entered {{the hole in the}} uranium tamper, it stuck. Robert Bacher realized that the heat from the plutonium core had caused the capsule to expand, while the explosives assembly with the tamper had cooled during the night in the desert. By leaving the capsule in contact with the tamper, the temperatures equalized and in a few minutes the capsule had slipped completely into the tamper. The <b>eyebolt</b> was then removed from the capsule and replaced with a threaded uranium plug, a boron disk was placed on top of the capsule, an aluminum plug was screwed into the hole in the pusher, and the two remaining high explosive lenses were installed. Finally, the upper Dural polar cap was bolted into place. Assembly was completed at about 16:45 on July 13.|$|E

60|$|During {{the weight}} of the gust, no one had leisure, or indeed {{inclination}} to look to aught beyond its effect on the brig. Had one been otherwise disposed, the attempt would have been useless, for the wind had filled the air with spray, and near the islets even with sand. The lurid but fiery tinge, too, interposed a veil that no human eye could penetrate. As the tornado passed onward, however, and the winds lulled, the air again became clear, and in five minutes after the moment when the Swash lay nearly on her side, with her lower yard-arm actually within a few feet of the water, all was still and placid around her, as one is accustomed to see the ocean in a calm, of a summer's afternoon. Then it was that those who had been in such extreme jeopardy could breathe freely and look about them. On board the Swash all was well--not a rope-yarn had parted, or an <b>eyebolt</b> drawn. The timely precautions of Spike had saved his brig, and great was his joy thereat.|$|E

40|$|A new {{technique}} for reinforcing rubble stone masonry walls (double and triple-leaf walls), {{when it is}} required to keep the fair-face masonry. The reinforcement technique consists of a continuous mesh made of tiny steel cords embedded perfectly in the mortar joints after a first repointing, and anchored to the wall by means of galvanized steel <b>eyebolts</b> driven into the facing. A second repointing covers the cords and {{the heads of the}} <b>eyebolts</b> completely. This leads to genuine reinforced fair-face masonry in which, as already confirmed by the first experiments, the compression, shear and flexural strength are increased, effective transverse connection between the facings of the masonry due to the presence of the <b>eyebolts</b> and also the capacity to withstand tensile stresses. The reinforcement is non-invasive and reversible, and is aimed at integrating the masonry rather than transforming it. It is compatible with preservation of the material of which the artefact is made and is long-lasting in view of the materials used, which are very resistant to aggression. The analysis of this reinforcement/upgrading work has led to the formulation of practical criteria for sizing the reinforcement and to the assessment of the strength of the reinforced panel...|$|R

50|$|Short {{shackling}} is {{a technique}} that American interrogators {{have been reported to}} use in the War on Terror. According to a military report the suspect's hands are shackled to an <b>eyebolt</b> on the floor, so that the suspect is forced to lie in a fetal position or squatting position. It is believed that the suspect's feet are also bound to the <b>eyebolt,</b> similar to hogtying, but this has not been confirmed in any government reports. This interrogation technique can cause flesh wounds.|$|E

50|$|For many years, Padden {{lived in}} the {{vicinity}} of the Broad River, Gaston, South Carolina. On one occasion she ventured onto a dam, reaching its center just as the noon whistle blew near the power station. Frightened, she lost her balance and fell over, but she managed to cling to a steel <b>eyebolt.</b> Fortunately she was rescued by an African American servant of the power company superintendent. Afterwards Padden's parents hired the man and took him to New York City, where he died at age 108.|$|E

A fuze adapter is screwed into the body and brazed in place. An <b>eyebolt</b> lifting plug is screwed into the fuze well to assist in transportation. The plug is removed and replaced with a fuze for firing. The complete projectile weighs 43.2 kg, is 800 mm long and contains 15.8% explosive by weight. It is a separate-loading projectile—propellant bags or MAC charges are loaded separately.|$|E
50|$|When {{the handle}} for {{lowering}} {{the landing gear}} was activated, the indicator showed two green and one red light. The red light indicated that the right main gear was not locked in position. The landing was aborted. Attempts at lowering the gear manually were also unsuccessful. Investigation into {{the cause of the}} failure to deploy revealed that the right main gear hydraulics actuator <b>eyebolt</b> was separated from the actuator. A further analysis of the actuator showed corrosion on the inside leading to reduced mechanical strength of the actuator and eventual failure.|$|E

On July 27, 1964 this tower collapsed {{as a result of}} a fatigue failure of an <b>eyebolt</b> head in a compression cone insulator on a structural guy.

5000|$|It was {{a simple}} smooth bore muzzle-loading (SBML) mortar {{consisting}} of a 57 in one-piece steel tube barrel, with a [...] "striker stud" [...] inside {{the centre of the}} closed base of the tube.

50|$|The Cape Race LORAN-C {{transmitter}} {{was used}} as an antenna tower until February 2, 1993. It was a 411.48 m (1350 ft) tall guyed mast, built in 1965. This mast was the tallest structure in Canada until the construction of the CN Tower in Toronto, and remained the second-tallest structure until its collapse on February 2, 1993. The collapse {{was the result of a}} fatigue failure of the <b>eyebolt</b> head in a compression cone insulator on a structural guy-wire. This failure caused swing-in damage that resulted in the tower's collapse. The tower was replaced by a 260.3 meter (854 ft) tall guyed mast, insulated against the ground.|$|E

A guy wire insulator <b>eyebolt</b> failed sending the insulator crashing into the tower, knocking it out of plumb. It collapsed in 1964 on repair of the structural damage caused by the insulator. The collapsing tower killed four construction contract workers, three on the tower and one on the ground. The collapse also destroyed the transmitter building.|$|E
50|$|Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) {{has been}} accused of cutting corners for maintenance. As the Swedish Civil Aviation Authority began an {{investigation}} of the accident, it brought renewed focus on SAS maintenance procedures. Only two weeks previously, Swedish authorities had levelled a scathing critique at the airline after an aircraft of the same model nearly crashed because its engine accelerated unexpectedly during landing. The final outcome of the investigation was not a lack of maintenance but over cleaning of the landing gear with pressure washers which washed out the corrosion prevention coatings between the <b>eyebolt</b> and the actuator rod end. The airline reportedly made 2,300 flights in which safety equipment was not up to standard, although the airline has denied this.|$|E
