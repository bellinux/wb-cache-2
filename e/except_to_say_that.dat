5|$|According to cricket {{historian}} Bernard Whimpress, {{the early}} signs of a conspiracy against Marsh were raised by a journalist from The Age of Melbourne {{by the name of}} Old Boy. The journalist set a possible agenda by raising a question about Marsh to Crockett on the day before the bowler was called, possibly predisposing the umpire to take action. If Old Boy could be relied on, then observers suspected that Marsh's faster and slower ball were dubious. The reporter did not specify which ball he questioned, <b>except</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> one ball per over was doubtful. The events in Australia occurred against a backdrop of a throwing frenzy in England. A fortnight earlier, the captains of the English county teams had drawn up a list of prohibited bowlers. In Australia, Jim Phillips had set the tone by no-balling Australian Test bowler Ernie Jones. The events in England were seen as a catalyst for a clean-up campaign against dubious bowling actions. Historians regarded Marsh as a prime target due to his Indigenous heritage and his supple wrist action.|$|E

Instead of having legs and feet for walking, members of this order have limbs designed for swimming; these are more like fins or paddles than anything else and are called flippers. The Walrus is so big that I can give you no idea how big he is, <b>excepting</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> he will weight two thousand pounds. He is simply a great mass of living flesh covered with a rough, very thick skin without hair. From his upper jaw two immense ivory tusks hang straight down, and with these he digs up shellfish {{at the bottom of the}} sea. It is a terrible effort for him to move on shore, and so he is content to stay within a few feet of the water. He also lives in the cold waters of the Far North amidst floating ice. On this he often climbs out to lie for hours. His voice is a deep grunt or bellowing roar. The young are born on land close to the water.|$|R

The {{chairman of the}} Fort Sill Apache Tribe, the successor to Geronimo's tribe, {{wrote a letter to}} Obama asking him to [...] "right this wrong." [...] The president of the Navajo Nation requested that the U.S. government change the code name retroactively. Officials from the National Congress of American Indians said the focus should be on honoring the disproportionately high number of Native Americans who serve in the military, and they had been assured that [...] "Geronimo" [...] was not a code name for bin Laden. The U.S. Senate Committee on Indian Affairs heard testimony on the issue from tribal leaders, while the Defense Department had no comment <b>except</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> no disrespect was intended.|$|E

The boy's uncle was future Major General Paul Alfred Cullen. [...] Nigel was taken to England at an early age by his parents and {{attended}} Sherborne School in Dorset, before studying at the College of Aero Engineering, Chelsea. Fired by a love of adventure, he competed in motorbike racing at Brooklands in 1934, and later saw action {{as a member of the}} International Brigades during the Spanish Civil War, suffering a wound to the stomach that necessitated repatriation to England. When he caught up again with his friends from Brooklands, he was reluctant to talk about the conflict <b>except</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> [...] "the wars of the future would be fought in the air".|$|E

The book does not give {{a detailed account of}} her involvement in the BLA or the events on the New Jersey Turnpike, <b>except</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the jury [...] "onvicted a woman with her hands up!" [...] It gives an account of her life beginning with her youth in the South and New York. Shakur challenges traditional styles of literary autobiography and offers a perspective on her life that is not easily accessible to the public. The book was published by Lawrence Hill & Company in the United States and Canada but the copyright is held by Zed Books Ltd. of London due to [...] "Son of Sam" [...] laws, which restrict who can receive profits from a book. In the six months preceding the publications of the book, Evelyn Williams, Shakur's aunt and attorney, made several trips to Cuba and served as a go-between with Hill. Her autobiography was republished in Britain in 2014 and a dramatized version performed on BBC Radio 4 in July 2017.|$|E

I earnestly trust that in justice to gallant officers and soldiers, who have languished these weary months in Pretoria, there will be a strict inquiry into the circumstances under which they became prisoners of war. I have no doubt we shall be told that it is a foolish thing to wash dirty linen in public; but much better wash it in public than wear it foul.|$|R
500|$|In 1907, Sifton was {{one member}} of a three-member {{commission}} assigned to investigate labour unrest between coal miners and mine operators. [...] His colleagues were mining executive Lewis Stockett and miners' union executive William Haysom. [...] Miners' demands included increased wages, a reduction in working hours to eight per day (from ten), the posting of mine inspection reports, the isolated storage of explosives, the use of non-freezing explosives, and semi-monthly rather than monthly pay. [...] The mine operators objected to this last point {{on the basis that}} many miners did not report to work the day after payday, and it was thus desirable to keep paydays to a minimum. [...] The commission recommended that children under sixteen {{should not be allowed to}} work in mines, that inspectors should post their reports, that mine sites should have bath houses, and that ventilation inspection should be improved. It also recommended that Albertans keep a supply of coal on hand during the summer for winter use. The commission was silent on wages (<b>except</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> these should not be fixed by legislation), the operation of company stores (a sore point among the miners), and the incorporation of mine unions (which was recommended by mines but opposed by the unions). It made no recommendation about working hours, but Premier Alexander Rutherford's government legislated an eight-hour day anyway.|$|E
500|$|At {{the start}} of the 2009–10 season, Filatov made the Blue Jackets roster after {{training}} camp. Although healthy, he did not play in six of the team's first 18 games, a decision made by Columbus Head Coach Ken Hitchcock. Filatov was unhappy with his playing time and role on the team under Hitchcock and requested to be transferred back to his Russian club team. Hitchcock and the Blue Jackets coaching staff tried to improve Filatov's attention to defensive aspects of the game. [...] The Blue Jackets management agreed to Filatov's request to return to Russia {{for the remainder of the}} season. This arrangement resulted from direct dealings between the Blue Jackets and CSKA Moscow, where Filatov's salary was paid by the Russian club, and the Blue Jackets retained his rights. Shortly after his return to Russia, Filatov set a KHL record by scoring the game-winning goal in three consecutive games. He was named the League's best newcomer (defined by the KHL as [...] "a player born in 1987 or later, who has played no more than 20 top-level matches in previous national tournaments") for November, and the League's best rookie for the 11th week of the season. In his shortened season in Russia, Filatov played 26 games, scoring nine goals and adding 13 assists. Initial statements by both sides indicated the player would return to Columbus after the 2009–10 season, but since returning to Russia, Filatov has been less clear about his intentions for the 2010–11 season, stating, [...] "I hope I'll be back next year, but right now, it's really hard to say because it will again be a tough decision." [...] Howson did not comment on Filatov's stance, <b>except</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> he expects Filatov to be at the team's training camp prior to the 2010–11 season. Subsequently, Filatov stated after the 2009–10 season that he intended to return to Columbus for training camp.|$|E
500|$|During the 1890s, Walker became {{active in}} politics. [...] Walker's {{activism}} was heightened by {{an incident in}} June 1897 in which residents of Urbana, Ohio, formed a lynch mob, removed a black man named [...] "Click" [...] Mitchell from the town jail, and publicly killed him by hanging. [...] Believing that Ohio's Republican Governor Asa Bushnell had failed to conduct an appropriate investigation into the lynching, Walker and other African Americans in Ohio left the Republican Party and formed the Negro Protective Party. [...] As {{a member of the}} party's Executive Committee, Walker helped organize the party's convention at Columbus, Ohio in September 1897. [...] The party adopted a platform demanding [...] "an immediate recognition of our rights as citizens such as have been repeatedly pledged and as often violated," [...] and declaring an intention [...] "to take immediate political action that we may show to the world that we are no longer the plaything of politicians or chattels for sale to the highest bidder." [...] The party also began publishing [...] "The Negro Protector" [...] as its official organ. [...] When former slave and Republican Party official, Nelson T. Gant, attacked Walker and the Negro Protective Party, Walker responded with an open letter that was published in Ohio newspapers. [...] In the letter, Walker wrote:Notwithstanding N. T. Gant there are many [...] "intelligent Negroes" [...] who will support the Negro protective ticket and will hurl back at him with contempt his insults to their manhood that they are not free to leave the republican party without being branded as [...] "betrayers of their party" [...] and [...] "ungrateful to their Creator and their race." [...] Such fumings are manifestly the strongest evidence of an enslaved mind... Republicans... believe, or make pretense of believing, that the Negro owes eternal allegiance to the G. O. P. no matter what the issue... We shall not trespass further upon your valuable space, <b>except</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the Negro Protective party will live and its supporters hope never to regret the stand taken for free and independent manhood as a protest against every disregard, from whatever source, of the rights and privileges of the Negro as an American citizen.|$|E
5000|$|There is scant {{record of}} {{the conduct of the}} school from 1814 to 1820, but on March 24 of that year an act was passed in the Legislature of New York, {{incorporating}} Mount Pleasant Academy and from that time on have been preserved full and complete records of the school. The worthy aims of the school are quaintly set forth in an advertisement printed in the [...] "New York Commercial Advertiser" [...] for April 28, 1823, over the signature of General Aaron Ward, Secretary of the Board of Trustees and one of the original incorporators of the Academy. General Ward says in part: [...] "In this Seminary the academic year will commence the 1st of May next. The Trustees, therefore, respectfully beg leave to recommend it to the public, as an institution where youth are taught, by easy graduation, from the first rudiments of knowledge to the higher classics, sufficient to qualify them for admission into any of the American colleges, and more particularly for Columbia College, in the City of New York; or prepare them for the various stages of life. The Academy is pleasantly situated {{on the banks of the}} Hudson, within 33 miles of the City of New York, in a healthy village, possessing many local advantages, among others a daily communication with the city, either by land or water; good medical advice, and the use of several churches." [...] Even today we need add little to these quaint words <b>except</b> possibly <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> daily communication with the city has been replaced by an hourly train service.
