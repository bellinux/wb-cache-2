40|$|In {{order to}} {{estimate}} the partial pressure of dissolved carbon dioxide gas in natural watersof landslide areas, the <b>following</b> <b>approximate</b> <b>formula</b> is obtained: log Pco 2 ='log〔HCO 3 ￣〕 -pH+ 7. 8 at water temperature range, 0 - 30 °, by using hydration equilibrium of carbondioxide gas and the first dissociation equilibrium of carbonic acid, and assuming that individualion activity coefficients are unity. The authors have examined the relationships among thecalculated dissolved carbon dioxide gas, bicarbonate contents and pH in the ground watersampled from various landslide areas. The following have been obtained: (1) The modevalue of partial pressure distribution of carbon dioxide gas is found at 10 ~ atmosphere inlandslide areas, but at 10 - 3. I atmosphere in granitic areas, (2) A possibility of distinctionbetween stream and ground water from water quality is found by using a pH-HC 03 -Pco 2 diagram, and (3) The solubility of biotite, chlorite, Ca-feldsper and K-mica is oversaturatedwith respect to that of calcite in landslide areas...|$|E
40|$|The {{electric}} field applied perpendicularly to smectic layers breaks the rotational symmetry of the system. Consequently, the elastic energy associated with distortions induced by an edge dislocation diverges logarithmically {{with the size}} of the system. In freely suspended smectic films the dislocations {{in the absence of the}} {{electric field}} are located exactly in the middle of the film. The electric field, E, above a certain critical value, Ec, can shift them towards the surface. This critical field (in Gauss cgs units) is given by the <b>following</b> <b>approximate</b> <b>formula</b> E_ c=√(4 π B (aγ/√(KB) -b) /(ϵ_ a(N- 2))). Here, B and K are smectic elastic constants, γ is the surface tension, N is the number of smectic layers and ϵa is the dielectric anisotropy. The constant b= 0. 85 ± 0. 07 and a= 1. 45 ± 0. 01. Additionally, we assumed that √(K/B) =d, where d is the smectic period. This formula is valid for γ/√(KB) > 2 and N> 12. For smaller values of the surface tension and large N the linear relation between Ec 2 and γ/√(KB) breaks down, since eventually for γ/√(KB) → 1 and N→∞, Ec 2 (N- 2) approaches 0. The equilibrium location of a dislocation in the smectic film, heq, equals NdG(x), where x=E 2 /Ec 2 and G(x) is a function independent of the film thickness (for N> 12) and of the value of the surface tension...|$|E

40|$|The {{expected}} rate of allelism, E[I(x) ], of lethal genes {{between two}} colonies with distance x in a structured population is studied by using one- and two-dimensional stepping-stone models. It is shown that E[I(x) ] {{depends on the}} magnitude of selection in heterozygous condition (h), the rate of migration among adjacent colonies (m), the number of loci which produce lethal mutations (n) and the effective population size of each colony (N). ——E[I(x) ] always decreases with distance x. The rate of decrease is affected strongly by the magnitude of m. The rate of decrease is faster when m is small. E[I(x) ] also decreases with increasing N and n. The effect of h on E[I(x) ] is somewhat complicated. However, E[I(0) ] is always smaller when h is small than when it is large. ——For large x, the <b>following</b> <b>approximate</b> <b>formulae</b> may be obtained: (see PDF) where q and Var (q) are the mean and the variance of gene frequencies in each colony, t is approximated as t=h, (see PDF), -h for the partially recessive, completely recessive, and overdominant lethals, respectively, and C 0 {{is a function of}} m and t. It is clear that E[I(x) ] declines exponentially with x in a one-dimensional habitat. The decrease E[I(x) ] is faster in a two-dimensional habitat than in a one-dimensional habitat. The present result is applied to some of the existing data and the estimation of population parameters is also discussed...|$|R

40|$|AIM [...] To {{evaluate}} {{the accuracy of}} the <b>approximate</b> linear <b>formula</b> of International Normalised Ratio (INR) imprecision by formal mathematical analysis. METHODS [...] Using probability theory, an exact formula for the coefficient of variation (CV) of the INR was derived. The CV from the <b>approximate</b> <b>formula</b> was compared with the CV from the exact formula for INR determinations between 1. 0 and 10. 0 with International Sensitivity Indices (ISIs) between 1. 0 and 3. 0 and prothrombin time ratio CVs between 1. 0 and 10. 0 %. RESULTS [...] When the ISI equals 1. 0, the <b>approximate</b> <b>formula</b> and the exact formula are equal. When the ISI is more than 1. 0, the <b>approximate</b> <b>formula</b> overestimates the exact CV, but by less than one hundredth of the exact CV in the parameter ranges studied. The <b>approximate</b> <b>formula</b> is most accurate when laboratories achieve excellent prothrombin time measurement precision and use sensitive thromboplastins. CONCLUSIONS [...] The <b>approximate</b> <b>formula</b> provides a simple means for estimating the imprecision of the INR and is sufficiently accurate to warrant its use in clinical laboratories...|$|R
