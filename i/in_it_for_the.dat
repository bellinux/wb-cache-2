5|$|Zappa uniquely {{contributed to}} the avant-garde, anti-establishment music scene of the 1960s, {{sampling}} radio tape recordings and incorporating his own philosophical ideals to music and freedom of expression in his pieces. Bands such as AMM and Faust also {{contributed to the}} radio sampling techniques of the 1960s. Situated in New York, and only interrupted by the band's first European tour, the Mothers of Invention recorded the album widely regarded as the peak of the group's late 1960s work, We're Only <b>in</b> <b>It</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Money (released 1968). It was produced by Zappa, with Wilson credited as executive producer. From then on, Zappa produced all albums released by the Mothers of Invention and as a solo artist. We're Only <b>in</b> <b>It</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Money featured some of the most creative audio editing and production yet heard in pop music, and the songs ruthlessly satirized the hippie and flower power phenomena. He sampled plundered surf music in We're only <b>in</b> <b>It</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Money, as well as the Beatles' tape work from their song Tomorrow Never Knows. The cover photo parodied that of the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. The cover art was provided by Cal Schenkel whom Zappa met in New York. This initiated a lifelong collaboration in which Schenkel designed covers for numerous Zappa and Mothers albums.|$|E

25|$|Kelly's first {{professional}} race was the Étoile de Bessèges. It started on 7 February 1977 and lasted six days. Kelly came 10th {{on the first}} day. The Flandria team was in two parts: the strongest riders, {{such as the world}} champion Freddy Maertens, were in the main section, based in Belgium. Kelly rode with the second section, based more in France because Flandria wanted to sell more of its mopeds, scooters and bicycles there. The strongest riders in both camps came together for big races. Kelly was recruited as a domestique for Maertens in the main team for year's Paris–Nice– shortly afterwards he won his first race, the opening stage of the Tour of Romandy– and stayed <b>in</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Tour de France, in which he also won a stage.|$|E
500|$|In 2005, the U.S. National Recording Preservation Board {{included}} We're Only <b>in</b> <b>It</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Money in the National Recording Registry as [...] "Frank Zappa's inventive and iconoclastic album {{presents a}} unique political stance, both anti-conservative and anti-counterculture, and features a scathing satire on hippiedom and America's reactions to it".

500|$|However {{the album}} did develop a major cult {{following}} in the US by the time MGM/Verve had been merged into a division of PolyGram in 1972. [...] At that time many MGM/Verve releases including Freak Out! were prematurely deleted {{in an attempt to}} keep the struggling company financially solvent. Zappa had already moved on to his own companies Bizarre Records and Straight Records which were distributed by Warner Bros. Records. Freak Out! was initially more successful in Europe and quickly influenced many English rock musicians. According to David Fricke, the album was a major influence on The Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Paul McCartney regarded Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band as The Beatles' Freak Out!

Albert Goldman, writing in Life magazine, said that The Who play through [...] "all the kinky complications" [...] of the narrative in a hard rock style that is the antithesis of most contemporary [...] "serious" [...] rock.

Rowe reacted furiously to the publication, labeling the editorial staff [...] "bastards" [...] and complaining that they reported the story as if she and Jackson were freaks. J. Randy Taraborrelli later noted that the article, which had been put together from a secret tape recording between Rowe and a friend, had been fairly accurate. It detailed that Jackson was the father of the baby and that he would be raising the child alone. It also stated that Jackson impregnated Rowe artificially with his own sperm cells, a [...] "foolproof" [...] method of insemination. Further reports alleged that the relationship was an [...] "economic" [...] one; she was <b>in</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> money and he sought a baby.|$|E
