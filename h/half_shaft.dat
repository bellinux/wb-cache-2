25|$|For the 1968 Formula One season, {{after two}} years of driving the team's sole entry, Bruce McLaren was partnered by Denny Hulme. Hulme was world {{champion}} with the Brabham team in 1967 and had raced for McLaren that year in Can-Am, a North American sports car racing series. For {{the first round of the}} 1968 world championship – the South African Grand Prix, which was held in January, four months before the second round – only Hulme competed, using the M5A to finish fifth. The M7A's first race was the Race of Champions at Brands Hatch, run to Formula One rules but not part of the world championship. There, McLaren won from pole position while Hulme was third. Another victory came at the non-championship BRDC International Trophy at Silverstone, this time with Hulme finishing first and McLaren second. In the M7A's championship debut in Spain, Hulme was second and McLaren retired, then in Monaco McLaren crashed and Hulme was fifth and last. At the Belgian Grand Prix, they were fifth and sixth on the grid. Hulme took the lead and held it until a <b>half</b> <b>shaft</b> failed two thirds of the way in. McLaren was then second behind Jackie Stewart's Matra but Stewart had to make a pit stop for fuel on the final lap, giving McLaren the win, although he initially believed he had finished second. It was the McLaren team's first world championship victory and Bruce McLaren became the second driver, after Jack Brabham, to win in a car bearing their own name; it was also the last win of his career.|$|E
6000|$|The next Plate, VII., {{will show}} the {{principal}} characters of the Gothic jambs, and the total difference {{between them and the}} Byzantine ones. Two more Byzantine forms, 1 and 2, are given here for the sake of comparison; then 3, 4, and 5 are the common profiles of simple jambs of doors in the Gothic period; 6 is one of the jambs of the Frari windows, continuous into the archivolt, and meeting the traceries, where the line is set upon it at the extremity of its main slope; 7 and 8 are jambs of the Ducal Palace windows, in which the great semicircle is the <b>half</b> <b>shaft</b> which sustains the traceries, {{and the rest of the}} profile is continuous in the archivolt; 17, 18, and 19 are the principal piers of the Ducal Palace; and 20, from St. Fermo of Verona, is put with them in order to show the step of transition from the Byzantine form 2 to the Gothic chamfer, which is hardly represented at Venice. The other profiles on the plate are all late Gothic, given to show the gradual increase of complexity without any gain of power. The open lines in 12, 14, 16, etc., are the parts of the profile cut into flowers or cable mouldings; and so much incised as to show the constant outline of the cavetto or curve beneath them.

50|$|The year 2000 car {{marked the}} return to inboard suspension. However, the {{mounting}} posts for the bell cranks caused cracks in the main frame tubes. This car utilized the same engine, differential, and rear chassis subframe configurations as the 1998 and 1999 cars. However, a new rear upright and <b>half</b> <b>shaft</b> designs were implemented to eliminate cv joint failure and to reduce overall weight. The remainder of the chassis was fully redesigned from the engine forward.|$|E
50|$|A {{connection}} {{from the}} ring gear to each wheel's half-shaft is made by left and right side clutches. Each drive clutch consists of three elements: an electromagnetic coil, a ball-cam device, {{and a set of}} 19 wet clutch plates which are similar in design to clutches used in an automatic transmission.

50|$|In August 2013 Chrysler {{issued a}} recall to replace bolts that secure the Fiat 500e half drive shafts. The recall {{is not related}} to the 500e's {{electric}} powertrain and affected 291 model year 2013 Fiat 500e electric cars, including vehicles at dealer's lots. When an investigation was launched after a customer's 500e exhibited power loss, engineers discovered two assembly steps had not been properly completed, thereby creating a condition that could lead to <b>half</b> <b>shaft</b> separation. Fiat 500e owners affected by the recall will receive free rental vehicles while their electric cars are being repaired at no charge.|$|E
40|$|A {{vital part}} in the {{transmission}} for Scania lorries is the shaft in the rear axle. Since this shaft {{is divided into two}} identical parts, these are termed <b>half</b> <b>shafts.</b> Close control of the manufacturing process of these is required. Influence of flow rate, temperature and polymer concentration of the quenchant was investigated. An important controlling factor is the cooling rate used in the hardening process. This factor was selected for investigation in the present study. It was found that high flow rate, low temperature and low polymer concentration gives high cooling rates. Further investigation was performed how the residual stresses, surface hardness and the case depth of the <b>half</b> <b>shafts</b> were affected by the cooling rate. The results show that residual stresses are particularly affected by the cooling rate. Higher cooling rates results in higher residual stresses. Since residual stresses are important for fatigue lifer, a fatigue study was also undertaken. Five <b>half</b> <b>shafts</b> were quenched with a polymer concentration of 5 %, and another five with 15 %. All ten <b>half</b> <b>shafts</b> were fatigue tested in torsion, using a Scania standardized method. The shafts were loaded in torsion torque with company confidential amplitude, mean equal to zero number of cycles to failure was recorded. In normal production the <b>half</b> <b>shafts</b> are quenched with 10 % polymer concentration. No tests with a polymer concentration of 10 % were carried out in this investigation since results from this concentration are available from earlier studies. Residual stresses were measured using a relatively new method developed by Scania, called the core drilling method. A 20 cm long portion of the shaft was center drilled in steps, gradually increasing the drill diameter. After each step, the relaxation of surface strain was measured in the longitudinal and transversal directions. Having obtained these data, stresses can be calculated. Residual stresses were also measured by x-ray diffraction. Only surface stresses are obtained in this way, however. These measurements were made {{for each of the three}} polymer concentrations. An attempt was also made on trying to simulate the stress formation in the shafts during the heat treatment with FEM and also to calculate the residual stresses after the treatment. Results from the measurements were then compared with the FEM calculated results. Since the number of tested shafts is small, results are not statistically relevant. One may conclude, though, that fatigue life increases with increasing cooling rate, i. e. with decreasing polymer concentration. The fatigue life requirement for all tested shafts was fulfilled. The compressive residual stresses for 5 % and 10 % polymer concentration are of same magnitude and higher than for those quenched with 15 % polymer concentration. The result also shows that the cooling rate does not affect the surface hardness, nor the case depth...|$|R

50|$|Power {{steering}} became {{standard equipment}} {{with a new}} rack-and-pinion system, rather than recirculating ball. Changes {{were made to the}} rear suspension layout, which also meant the exhaust pipe now exited from the left, rather than right-hand side.

50|$|Rolt {{competed in}} three Formula One World Championship races, the British Grands Prix of 1950, 1953, & 1955, but all three outings ended in retirement. At the 1950 British Grand Prix, the first-ever {{round of the}} F1 World Championship, he started 10th on the grid in an ERA that had been {{qualified}} by Peter Walker, but the gearbox failed after four laps. In the 1953 race, once again he started from 10th, but a <b>half</b> <b>shaft</b> on his Connaught failed after 70 laps. In his final Grand Prix, he again shared a drive with Walker in 1955. In {{what was to be}} the last F1 outing for both drivers: their Connaught started 14th and retired with transmission trouble after 18 laps. Stirling Moss asserts that Rolt would have been among the top GP drivers, if he raced regularly.|$|E
50|$|The first {{generation}} CTS-V {{is based on}} the same rear-wheel-drive GM Sigma platform as is the base model CTS. The use of a V8 engine required a unique engine cradle distinct from the base CTS V6. Larger anti-roll bars and larger shocks were also added. The spring rate was significantly increased. The 2006-2007 update also included a stronger rear differential and <b>half</b> <b>shaft</b> design. Unique front and rear treatments also included mesh grilles over the front openings, a track-ready suspension, and 18×8.5 inch wheels inside of P245/45R18 Z-rated Goodyear Eagle F1 Supercar run-flat tires. Brakes were 13.97 in rotors in the front, with 14.37 in rotors in the rear - each with four-piston Brembo calipers on the front and rear wheels. In addition, GM badges were added on 2006 models. For performance enthusiasts, a high performance suspension package (RPO FG2) was available as a dealer installed option.|$|E
50|$|Transmission was 8 speed {{through a}} single clutch with {{the option of}} the Allis-Chalmers <b>half</b> <b>shaft</b> clutch to achieve 'live' power take-off. Converging three point linkage was powered by an engine mounted {{hydraulic}} pump giving hydraulic power whenever the engine was running regardless of transmission status. An hydraulic weight transfer system was built in to increase traction and a simple mechanical depth stop was provided on the earlier machines. Later machines, introduced mid-1963 and called 'Depthomatic' had a draught and position control system. Other modifications and options included improved gear ratios; a pick-up hitch; an increase in power through higher maximum revs and revised battery arrangement. An option on both models was the patent Allis-Chalmers PAVT rear wheels (Power Adjusted Variable Track),a system adopted by other manufacturers after patents expired. Production ended in 1968 and quite a few are still in use on farms in 2011. A few ED40s were exported to the USA. It's hard to say exactly how many {{made it to the}} US, but it seems most of them ended up in the Mid-Atlantic and South Eastern regions.|$|E

At the Valvoline 200 at Phoenix International Raceway, Lazier started in 17th place and finished in 14th place, thirty-three laps down. Lazier scored his first {{point of the}} season at the Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach, scoring a 12th-place finish despite running out of fuel after completing 80 of the race's 105 laps. At the Indianapolis 500, Lazier began to drive an unsponsored Lola T91/00-Buick. Lazier crashed during practice for the race, but {{he was able to}} make the field, in 24th place. Lazier retired due to an engine failure after completing 139 laps, and was scored in 14th place. At the following two races, the ITT Automotive Grand Prix of Detroit and the Budweiser G.I. Joe's 200 at Portland International Raceway, Lazier was scored in 24th place on both occasions, retiring due to a broken <b>half</b> <b>shaft</b> at Detroit and a clutch problem at Portland.|$|E
50|$|One year later, in an {{autobiography}} detailing his career {{up to that}} point, Foyt gave a somewhat more analytical account of what occurred than he had before, while still assigning Cogan {{nearly all of the}} responsibility. According to Foyt, the slow straightaway pace previously noted by Unser and Rutherford had been beneath the power-amplification threshold of the turbocharger, which provides a progressively higher energy boost to the engine the higher the engine's RPM. Due to the pace, competitors had to run in lower gears much later than they normally did when approaching the start. Foyt in turn maintained that Cogan had intended to jump both Foyt and Mears into the first turn through the 'stupid trick' of using lower gears, via the significantly faster acceleration they provided compared to higher gears. When Mears' insufficient pace precluded this strategy, Foyt accused Cogan of simply 'jumping on it' early, even before the green flag had fully come out, whereby the resulting explosive power increase caused the car to veer sideways and 'get away from him'. Any broken <b>half</b> <b>shaft,</b> Foyt finally stated, was merely due to the subsequently unavoidable collision with Andretti.|$|E
50|$|At the {{following}} race, the Miller Genuine Draft 200 at the Milwaukee Mile, Lazier started in 24th place and finished in 18th place, twelve laps down. Lazier started in 27th place at {{the following}} race, the ITT Automotive Grand Prix of Detroit, and finished in 17th place, two laps down. Lazier started in 29th place and finished in 24th place in the Budweiser/G. I. Joe's 200 at Portland International Raceway, after running out of fuel after completing 91 laps. Following Portland, Lazier started only two more races during the season. At the Budweiser Grand Prix of Cleveland at Cleveland Burke Lakefront Airport, Lazier was replaced by pay driver Giovanni Lavaggi. Lazier qualified but did not start either the Molson Indy Toronto at Exhibition Place and the Slick 50 200 at New Hampshire, and he failed to qualify at Mid-Ohio and Nazareth. Lazier did however compete in the Marlboro 500 at Michigan International Speedway and the Molson Indy Vancouver at Concord Pacific Place. Lazier started in 21st place at Michigan, but failed to finish due to an electrical issue, while a <b>half</b> <b>shaft</b> problem caused him to retire at Vancouver. Lazier finished in 36th place in the final championship standings.|$|E
40|$|Digital {{analysis}} of the free-free bending vibrations of a propeller shaft and a beam-type rear axle are compared, for different theoretical models, {{with the results of}} rig tests.

50|$|Clutch delay valves {{operate on}} the {{principle}} that engagement only needs to occur at a certain rate to be efficient and that engaging at a quicker rate can damage the drive train components of an automobile. Engaging the drive train to the engine too quickly can damage drive train parts, including the transmission, differential, <b>half</b> <b>shafts,</b> axles, and CV joints. Engaging the drive train too slowly can damage the clutch friction disc and cause clutch slippage.|$|R
50|$|The {{transmission}} is attached behind the engine, with a driveshaft that sends {{power to the}} front of the car to an asymmetrically installed limited-slip differential which then supplies power to the front wheels using half shafts; this allowed the powertrain to remain slightly behind the front wheels. This also gave the car a 60:40 front to rear weight distribution. The turning radius of the Inspire also was not as tight as its competitors due to the use of Constant-velocity joint installed on the front axle <b>half</b> <b>shafts,</b> but the Inspire did have an advantage in adverse traction conditions.|$|R
50|$|Among modern tractors, {{the high}} drive (elevated sprocket) design {{is unique to}} Caterpillar products. The concept {{originated}} in 1914 with Caterpillar predecessor C. L. Best Tractor's 30 Humpback; this tractor was discontinued a year later, and the only other tractor to use the concept until the D10's introduction was the Cletrac Model F, built between 1920 and 1922. The elevated sprocket eliminates the final drive system, inclined to frequent failure. This elevated drive sprocket undercarriage was built in modular form; breakdown of the tracks and removal of the drive sprockets was much easier. The transmission can {{be removed from the}} rear because of the modular design. As the engine and drivetrain are mounted high in a traditional bulldozer, the half shafts from the differential exit above the drive sprocket, requiring a small gear {{on the end of the}} <b>half</b> <b>shaft</b> and another, larger one attached to the drive sprocket. The high-drive system eliminates the traditional final drive in favor of the planetary final drive, which withstands engine torque better, since it distributes the forces over multiple gear teeth instead of a single tooth as in the traditional system. The disadvantage is that the track moves around one more sprocket, reducing track life. Caterpillar claims to have alleviated this with the SALT (Sealed and Lubricated Track), a permanently lubricated track system which was introduced on their track-type tractors in the early 1970s.|$|E
5000|$|Have both driveshafts of {{the equal}} length by using an {{intermediate}} shaft (or [...] "lay shaft") {{on one side of}} the transmission. This is already implemented on most modern cars. When the driveshafts have different length and excessive torque is applied, the longer <b>half</b> <b>shaft</b> flexes more than the shorter one. However, this is a short term transient effect. To avoid fatigue failure, the amount of drive shaft torsional deflection must necessarily be small. Effects due to one wheel spinning more slowly than the other are usually negligible. Equal lengths of the driveshafts, in the case of no asymmetric suspension deflection due to roll or bump, keep the drive shaft angles equal. The main component of torque steer occurs when the torques in the driveshaft and the hub are summed vectorially, giving a resultant torque vector around the steering pivot axis (kingpin). These torques can be substantial, and in the case of shafts making equal angles to the hub shafts, will oppose one another at the steering rack, and so will cancel. These torques are strongly influenced by the position of the driveshaft universal joint (CV joint) in relation to the steering axis, however due to other requirements such as achieving a small or negative scrub radius an optimum solution is not generally possible with simple suspension configurations such as MacPherson strut.|$|E
