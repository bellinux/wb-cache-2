25|$|These {{three key}} {{concepts}} – locality, realism, freedom– are highly technical and much debated. In particular, {{the concept of}} realism is now somewhat different <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> in discussions in the 1930s. It is more precisely called counterfactual definiteness; {{it means that we}} may think of outcomes of measurements that were not actually performed as being just as much part of reality as those that were made. Locality is short for local relativistic causality. (Currently accepted quantum field theories are local in the terminology of the Lagrangian formalism and axiomatic approach.) Freedom refers to the physical possibility of determining settings on measurement devices independently of the internal state of the physical system being measured.|$|E

Its canonical territory currently includes most of modern Turkey, northern Greece and Mount Athos, the Dodecanese and Crete. By its interpretation of Canon 28 of Chalcedon, Constantinople also claims jurisdiction over all areas outside the canonically defined territories of other Orthodox churches, which includes the entire Western hemisphere, Australia, the United Kingdom, Western Europe, Southeast Asia, and elsewhere. This claim is disputed by other autocephalous churches with diocese in those areas, {{as well as the}} Turkish government.|$|E
25|$|After the surrender, Varley, {{along with}} the {{majority}} of his fellow AIF captives were imprisoned at Selarang Barracks near Changi Prison. When the first major contingent of Australian prisoners, totaling around 3,000 men and designated A Force departed Changi, Varley was placed in command. A Force was shipped in cramped conditions to Burma where it was engaged in the construction of airfields. Initially, conditions were good and men were paid for their work (although the Japanese deducted expenses) which allowed them to buy rations. Consequently, the prisoner's general condition improved <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> in Changi. To capitalise on this, Varley endeavoured to keep as many men as possible working. Eventually, the airfield work was completed, and in September 1942, A Force was shipped to Thanbyuzayat to start work on the Burma-Thailand Railway.|$|E

25|$|However, since 2001 {{the civil}} society in the three {{southern}} Thai provinces has experienced a widespread imposition of legalistic Salafi norms and the reality {{on the ground is}} today very different <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> in former southern Thailand. Salafism has heavily eroded Patani cultural identity and current insurgent groups have extreme religious goals, such as an Islamic Caliphate, to the detriment of Patani nationalism. Although some of the present-day insurgents are very likely former PULO members, it is still unclear whether they fight for PULO's cause and it is likely that many may have become part of the more active and religious organisations that have overtaken PULO. In recent years PULO's leadership has largely lost control over its insurgents and has a very limited overall degree of influence over the insurgency in southern Thailand.|$|E

500|$|Whitehead {{pointed to}} the {{limitations}} of language {{as one of the}} main culprits in maintaining a materialistic way of thinking, and acknowledged that {{it may be difficult to}} ever wholly move past such ideas in everyday speech. [...] After all, each moment of each person's life can hardly be given a different proper name, and it is easy and convenient to think of people and objects as remaining fundamentally the same things, rather than constantly keeping in mind that each thing is a different thing <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a moment ago. [...] Yet the limitations of everyday living and everyday speech should not prevent people from realizing that [...] "material substances" [...] or [...] "essences" [...] are a convenient generalized description of a continuum of particular, concrete processes. [...] No one questions that a ten-year-old person is quite different by the time he or she turns thirty years old, and in many ways is not the same person at all; Whitehead points out that it is not philosophically or ontologically sound to think that a person is the same from one second to the next.|$|E

2500|$|Merle H. Weiner in the Fordham Law Review {{pointed out}} that there was {{widespread}} media attention in the US during the late 1970s and early 1980s about international child abduction where the typical abductor was a foreign non-custodial male who abducted children from their primary caregiver. According to Weiner, this stereotype dominated the U.S. Congressional proceeding for ratification and resulted in a presumption in the US that abduction is always harmful to children. The Hague Convention makes no mention of domestic violence as a defense. Due to the focus on promoting return of children to their habitual residence, [...] "the domestic violence victim's ability to defeat a Hague Convention application for the return of their child, if possible at all, often turns more on fortuity and the judge's sympathy than on any principled rule of law." [...] The Australian delegate to the Hague Convention commission stated that: There is concern that the Convention is now being used by abusive (usually male) parents to seek the return of children and primary carers back to the country of habitual residence and that the Convention is moving away <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> meant to deter. Recent statistics demonstrate that the majority of abducting parents are women, often those fleeing situation of abuse and domestic violence. There is also growing concerns regarding the correlation between incidents of child abduction and the presence of domestic violence and that the Convention does not give due consideration and sufficient weight to such mitigating circumstances {{in the context of a}} [...] "grave risk" [...] argument.|$|E
2500|$|A {{recurring}} {{element in}} Antonescu's doctrines is racism, {{and in particular}} antisemitism. This was linked to his sympathy for ethnocratic ideals, and complemented by his statements in favor of [...] "integral nationalism" [...] and [...] "Romanianism". Like other far right Romanians, he saw a Jewish presence behind liberal democracy, and believed {{in the existence of}} Judeo-Masonry. His earliest thoughts on Codreanu's ideology criticize the Legionary leader for advocating [...] "brutal measures" [...] in dealing with the [...] "invasion of Jews", and instead propose [...] "the organization of Romanian classes" [...] as a method for reaching the same objective. Politician Aureliu Weiss, who met General Antonescu during that interval, recalled that, although antisemitic [...] "to the core", he was capable of restraint in public. According to historian Mihail Ionescu, the Conducător was not averse to the Iron Guard's [...] "Legionary principles", but wanted antisemitism to be [...] "applied in an orderly fashion", as opposed to Horia Sima's revolutionary ways. Historian Ioan Scurtu believes that, during the Legionary Rebellion, Antonescu deliberately waited before stepping in, in order for the Guard to be [...] "profoundly discredited" [...] and for himself to be perceived as a [...] "savior". In April 1941, he let his ministers know that he was considering letting [...] "the mob" [...] deal with the Jews, [...] "and after the slaughter, I will restore order." [...] Lucian Boia notes that the Romanian leader was indeed motivated by antisemitic beliefs, but that these need to be contextualized in order to understand what separates Antonescu from Hitler in terms of radicalism. However, various other researchers assess that, by aligning himself with Hitler before and during Operation Barbarossa, Antonescu implicitly agreed with his thoughts on the [...] "Jewish Question", choosing racial over religious antisemitism. According to Harvey, the Iași pogrom made the Germans [...] "evidently willing to accept that organized Christianity in Romania was very different <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> in Germany".|$|E
