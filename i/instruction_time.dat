The issue was raised after {{five of the seven}} board members declared a personal belief in intelligent design. Opponents describing themselves as Pastafarians e-mailed members of the Polk County School Board demanding equal <b>instruction</b> <b>time</b> for the Flying Spaghetti Monster. Board member Margaret Lofton, who supported intelligent design, dismissed the e-mail as ridiculous and insulting, stating, [...] "they've made us the laughing stock of the world". Lofton later stated that she had no interest in engaging with the Pastafarians or anyone else seeking to discredit intelligent design. As the controversy developed, scientists expressed opposition to intelligent design. In response to hopes for a new [...] "applied science" [...] campus at the University of South Florida in Lakeland, university vice president Marshall Goodman expressed surprise, stating, [...] " [...] not science. You can't even call it pseudo-science." [...] While unhappy with the outcome, Lofton chose not to resign over the issue. She and the other board members expressed a desire to return to the day-to-day work of running the school district.|$|E

As a result, Preuss' annual <b>instruction</b> <b>time</b> is 74,669 minutes compared to SDUSD's average of 64,800 minutes.
