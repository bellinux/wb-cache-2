Due to budgetary restrictions, the government {{realized that it}} could not provide all the resources needed and decided to complement the public sector's efforts with Pidiregas, a deferred financing schedule. This mechanism, which only applied to investments carried out by PEMEX(Petróleos Mexicanos) and CFE aimed to create the conditions for the penetration of private initiatives in hydrocarbon exploration and electricity generation. Pidiregas have been extended and have also grown in amount (PEMEX uses them for as much as four times the amount of CFE), although the original motivation for their existence is gone.|$|E
40|$|This Information Sheet {{includes}} proposed Abstracts on {{the following}} topics: • Application of the transitional rules in FRS 15 • Start-up costs. Comments would be welcome on any aspect of the proposals. As it is proposed that the Abstract on {{the application of the}} transitional rules in FRS 15 should become effective {{at the same time as}} FRS 15 itself becomes mandatory (periods ending on or after 23 March 2000) comments on this draft should be despatched so as to be received no later than 10 April. Comments on the start-up costs draft should be despatched so as to be received no later than 2 May. All comments will be regarded as on the public record unless confidentiality is requested by the commentator. Application of the transitional rules in FRS 15 A question has been raised on the interaction between paragraph 106 (reassessment of asset lives/residual values) and paragraph 108 (adoption of component accounting) in the transitional rules applicable when FRS 15 ‘Tangible Fixed Assets ’ is first adopted. The UITF decided that the prior period adjustment required by paragraph 108 should be restricted to the effects of treating different components of an asset separately and should not embrace any changes to the useful economic lives or residual values of the other components of the asset. The proposed Abstract specifies the limit to any such prior year adjustment. Start-up costs The UITF has considered whether start-up costs that cannot be included in the cost of a fixed asset under the relevant standards (FRS 15 ‘Tangible Fixed Assets’, FRS 10 ‘Goodwill and Intangible Assets ’ and SSAP 13 ‘Accounting for research and development’) may nevertheless be carried forward, for example as a prepayment or as <b>deferred</b> <b>expenditure.</b> The UITF concluded that start-up costs that do not meet the criteria for recognition as fixed assets set out in the standards referred to above should be recognised as an expense when they are incurred. The UITF noted that this conclusion is consistent with both International and US Standards. The conclusions on both these topics, and the UITF’s reasons for them, are explained in the draft Abstracts...|$|E
30|$|In this field, {{considerable}} {{research and}} many experiments {{have already been}} undertaken by various countries, but there is, of course, a wide gap between theory and practice. In our opinion, the salvation of Africa is a gigantic task, requiring great tenacity for several generations, which can be achieved only if undertaken on an international scale. Without a common program, adapted {{to the requirements of}} individual countries but carried out simultaneously wherever possible, the governments responsible for Africa will always hesitate to act. Left to their own devices, they will prefer to <b>defer</b> <b>expenditures</b> and the adoption of regulations, and will refuse to advise on actions to be taken if their suggestions are not carried out at the same time by their neighbors, who for some reason might find such an effort too troublesome a burden.|$|R

We hypothesized that an outsourcing vendor's behaviour is {{strongly influenced by}} several concerns e. g. unrealistic client expectations; negotiating and updating contracts; and maintaining appropriate relationships with clients. We interviewed eight senior executives of organisations supplying a variety of outsourcing services and three senior client executives responsible for outsourced services.

40|$|Once established, {{invasive}} species can rapidly and irreversibly alter ecosystems and degrade {{the value of}} ecosystem services. Optimal control of an exotic pest solves for a trajectory of removals that minimizes {{the present value of}} removal costs and residual damages from the remaining pest population. The shrubby tree, Miconia calvescens, is used to illustrate dynamic policy options for a forest invader. Potential damages to Hawaii's forest ecosystems are related to decreased aquifer recharge, biodiversity, and other ecosystem values. We find that population reduction is the optimal management policy for the islands of Oahu, Maui, and Hawaii. On the island of Kauai, where tree density is lower and search costs higher, optimal policy calls for <b>deferring</b> removal <b>expenditures</b> until the steady state population is reached...|$|R
40|$|Airtrain is {{the private}} {{operator}} {{of the rail}} link from Brisbane Airport to the central business district (CBD) and Gold Coast. With over a million passenger trips each year, Airtrain offers a significant alternative to road transport. Brisbane’s Airtrain is a private business which operates two train stations at Brisbane Airport. Trains from the airport travel to five stations in Brisbane CBD {{and on to the}} Gold Coast. Connections can be made to all suburban rail stations on the QR suburban network. Trains depart every 15 minutes during the core peak hours and every 30 minutes {{for the remainder of the}} day. Airtrain operates 70 services each day between 6. 00 am and 7. 30 pm. This report summarises the findings of a study into the impact of Airtrain operations on the likely amount of car trips avoided and hence on likely avoided CO 2 emissions and road crashes in South East Queensland (SEQ). Potential benefits from a mode shift from road to rail for passenger trips: (a) For those trips which remain on the road network: Travel time savings; Vehicle operating costs savings; Vehicle crash savings (b) For those trips which are now on Airtrain and which would have been on the road network: Reductions in vehicle emissions – different levels of reduction for each pollutant type; Reductions in noise pollution; Reductions in road maintenance costs from reduced traffic flows (deferred expenditures); Reductions in road capital expenditure from reduced traffic flows (<b>deferred</b> <b>expenditures)</b> (c) Other Impacts ‘Options’ value – this refers to the value placed by individuals on Airtrain irrespective of whether they use the system or not. Even if the system is not used, there is a benefit derived from the fact that the option is available if needed. Such a benefit is associated with the unexpected use of a transit system and it has been measured through the willingness to pay to have the option of using the new system, TAG (2004 and 2004 a) ...|$|R

However, {{as a result of}} the global economic situation, the Group reported an operating loss. Given the current economic climate, and in line with the steps being taken by other major airlines around the world, the airline has undertaken a comprehensive review of all its routes and operations. This has resulted in frequencies being reduced to certain destinations, ad hoc cancellations on other routes, <b>deferred</b> capital <b>expenditure,</b> parked aircraft and introduced a Special Leave Scheme for staff to conserve money. According to CEO Tony Tyler, the yield from passengers was [...] "hugely down" [...] and the airline had lost [...] "a lot of premium traffic". He noted that it could take 20 passengers in economy to make up for the lost revenue of one fewer first class passenger flying to New York from Hong Kong.|$|R
40|$|The overall {{capacity}} of an airport {{is determined by}} the airfield, particularly the runway system. The demand for runway access at major airports is expected to eventually exceed the {{capacity of}} the existing runway systems. The lack of adequate runway capacity at an airport results in congestion and expensive delays. Airport authorities, in response, plan to make significant investments on new runways where possible. There is consensus amongst researchers that the lack of adequate runway capacity cannot only be addressed by building additional capacity. Innovative ways which aim for better utilisation of existing facilities should be considered. Therefore, the research question is posed: Can demand management be successfully applied to <b>defer</b> capital <b>expenditure.</b> A detailed literature review of international best practices and analysis of their suitability is undertaken using ORTIA as a case study. The literature review identified: collaborative decision making; air and rail integration; demand management and technological improvements as likely interventions. The most significant finding of this research report is that the capacity of a runway system can be improved by implementing these measures...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. The Aircraft Service Period Adjustment (ASPA) Program {{was designed to}} determine the need to induct an aircraft into Standard Depot Level Maintenance (SDLM) based on Period End Date (PED), material condition, flight time and other factors {{in order to determine}} if the SDLM could be deferred for one year before reinspection andlor induction. If the SDLM is <b>deferred,</b> the <b>expenditure</b> of depot funds for an aircraft is deferred in the current year. Initially, the program allowed for the extension and deferral of numerous aircraft and did produce a one time saving. However, it has been observed that deferring SDLM, results in the deterioration in aircraft material condition. More over, ASPA brings significant uncertainty in depot parts support and SDLM planning and scheduling. ASPA causes a redundancy of effort in duplicating the aircraft inspections for ASPA and for induction into SDLM. In this research we show that the termination of the ASPA Program will significantly reduce the uncertainty and variability inherent in the Navy depot induction process. With the variability reduced turnaround time, organizational and depot workload, man hours expended and total costs[URL] United States NavyLieutenant Commander, United States Nav...|$|R
40|$|The {{cable system}} monitor (CSM) has been {{designed}} to provide grid system managers with real-time computation of the load-carrying capacity of selected cable circuits on the system. Historically, the main interconnected grid system in England and Wales had a few very simple individual cable monitors mainly in the north of England. A more sophisticated model was more recently developed on the Bramley-Didcot 1 and 2 circuits in southern England as these circuits imposed a serious constraint on the system. The results from this model were encouraging as the ratings produced on-line consistently gave thermal ratings 20 % in excess of the necessarily pessimistic ratings derived from off-line calculations. Grid system management identified other cable circuits that were causing operational restrictions due to lack of thermal capacity. As a result it was decided to develop a national scheme capable of taking all the identified circuits, plus future requirements, make improvements to the model and take advantage of advancements in technology. It was recognised that the increased thermal ratings that could be derived from the use of the CSM would <b>defer</b> capital <b>expenditure,</b> reduce generation restrictions or the need for running security plant, allow greater access to the system for construction and maintenance, and postpone the need for renegotiating wayleave consents...|$|R
5000|$|Historically much {{interest}} has focussed on the incentives on the regulated firm to enhance efficiency - that is, incentives {{to reduce its}} expenditure while maintaining a given {{quantity and quality of}} output. In principle, the building block model can be designed so as to yield either very low-powered incentives to minimise expenditure (which is sometimes known as cost-of-service or rate-of-return regulation) or very high-powered incentives. The building block model can be implemented {{in such a way as}} to yield very high-powered incentives to reduce expenditure by (a) setting the operating and capital expenditure inputs in the building block model on the basis of forecasts which are independent of the regulated firm's own actions, and (b) not [...] "clawing back" [...] any over-spend or under-spend at the end of the regulatory period. However, very high-powered incentives create their own problems - they create strong incentives on the firm to cut <b>expenditure</b> or <b>defer</b> capital <b>expenditure</b> - even at the expense of reducing service quality. In addition, high powered incentives expose the regulated firm to higher levels of risk and give rise to strong incentives to lobby the regulator for a higher target level of revenue. Economic theory does not support the use of very high-powered incentives and, in practice, almost all practical regulatory regimes tend to involve medium-powered incentives.|$|R
30|$|Microgrid can {{be defined}} as a part of {{distribution}} network including one or more distributed energy sources and having the capability to operate either in grid connected or standalone mode deployed in a limited geographical area [6]. There are various available favourable sites for the implementation of microgrids like remote areas, rural areas etc. where plenty of renewable energy resources are available for clean and green power generation. In such locations, microgrids can be operated in an islanding mode to achieve reliable and stable power supply by combining loads with the distributed energy resources available on the respected site. Based on market segments, microgrids can be categorized into five types: i) remote “off-grid” Microgrids ii) Campus/Institutional microgrids iii) Military base microgrids iv) Community/Utility microgrids and v) Commercial and Industrial microgrids [7]. Other way to categorize microgrid is based on the output voltage supplied to the load, and according to it microgrids can be classified into two types i) AC microgrid and ii) DC microgrid. There are many factors which makes microgrids very important, some of them are as follows: During the conditions of blackout, natural disaster etc. microgrids can maintain the normal power supply in the system, cost of Transmission and Distribution (T&D) losses will be saved with the help of microgrid, Demand of electricity is increasing day by day which ultimately require expenditure in T&D expansion, microgrids can <b>defer</b> these <b>expenditures,</b> microgrids generally uses renewable energy sources for power generation and these sources are environmental friendly having almost zero emission, quality and reliability of power supply is also enhanced with the help of microgrid in remote locations by means of renewable energy sources and combined heat and power (CHP) generation, cost of energy can be greatly reduced and so on [8].|$|R
40|$|With the {{significant}} increase in the consumption of electricity over the past few years, it has been hard for electricity entities {{to keep up with the}} sudden increases in demand. The replacement and upgrade of substation transformers and associated equipment is very expensive and time consuming to obtain and install. Also the wanton use of electricity without understanding the consequences and its impact on the environment is negligent on the part of the individual. For the purpose of this project Demand-Side Management is any action taken to reduce the consumption of electricity supply to a customers premises, to assist an Electricity Entity in the stability of the electricity network. This leads to the principle that Demand-Side Management can be used to <b>defer</b> capital <b>expenditure</b> by attempting to average a feeder or substation load over a longer period and reduce the amount of peaks and troughs. As will be seen later in the report, air-conditioning load is one of the fastest growing domestic loads, with significant increases over the past 2 to 3 years. As a result the electricity networks are being overloaded due to the unexpected increase in electricity demand. There are many different methods of demand-side management mentioned in this report, most of these can be used to manage air-conditioner load, however the methods would not be acceptable to customers. After looking at various forms of demand-side management I believe that congestion pricing is the method that is most suitable and fair for managing customers airconditioning load. Congestion pricing operates similar to tariff control, however the difference is that electricity prices are increased during high demand periods. Voluntary Load Shedding should be encouraged amongst those industrial organisations that can defer their load times. As such congestion pricing and voluntary load shedding are two methods of demand-side management that need to be seriously considered by electricity entities. Irrespective of what type of demand-side management method employed, for demand-side management to be effective the customer must actively support it...|$|R
40|$|We {{assess the}} scope for serving ongoing growth in {{transport}} demand while <b>deferring</b> or eliminating <b>expenditure</b> for additional capacity by reclaiming the protection capacity and inefficiently used working capacity in existing rings. Reclamation is through re-design of the routing and restoration {{in the network}} using mesh principles within the pre-existing ring capacities. The installed working and protection capacity of existing rings {{is viewed as a}} sunk investment, an existing resource, to be "mined" and incorporated into a mesh-operated network that serves both existing and ongoing growth. Three ways of approaching the idea are given. The last is a detailed planning model for minimum cost evolution out to a given total growth multiplier that considers the costs of new mesh capacity additions, nodal costs for mesh access to existing ring capacity and selective ADM conversions and re-use decisions. Depending on the type of initial ring network design results show that in some cases a complete doubling or even tripling of demand could be supported with little or no additional capacity investment through the period of ring-to-mesh conversion by ring-mining. The strategy may mean that an operator that could handle the administrative process of conversion could access the opportunity to grow their business {{for a year or more}} without capital additions for transport capacity. This re-capture of existing installed protection capacity for conversion to service-bearing use would be a one time business strategy opportunity made possible by a ring mining conversion from ring to mesh...|$|R
40|$|This {{discussion}} paper has {{been prepared to}} assist public consultation on an update of the state 2 ̆ 7 s infrastructure plan, released in 2005. South Australia’s first infrastructure plan, released in 2005, has guided significant progress in tackling the challenges identified at that time. More than 80 per cent of the priority projects listed in the plan have been completed or are underway and the South Australian Government’s infrastructure spending is at record high levels. As the Australian economy recovers from the global financial crisis, we face new and emerging challenges and opportunities arising from strong population growth and ageing, technological change, industry growth and diversification, including {{the development of the}} mining and defence sectors, and the need for adaptation and mitigation measures to address climate change. The State Government has released the 30 -Year Plan for Greater Adelaide (a volume of the South Australian Planning Strategy) to tackle these challenges by guiding where people live and work and the management of land use, while conserving our environment. Recognising the importance of integrating land use and infrastructure planning, a review of state infrastructure priorities is now timely, guided by the new volumes of the South Australian Planning Strategy. This {{discussion paper}} has been prepared to assist public consultation on an update of the state’s infrastructure plan. It presents an overview of the achievements, challenges and opportunities in the 14 infrastructure sectors covered in the 2005 plan. It also provides an outline of the long term global and national economic, social and environmental trends which are expected to shape the way in which South Australia develops and the long term strategic priorities to guide infrastructure development over the next 10 to 15 years and beyond. The new edition of the plan will clearly identify priorities for private and public investment and policy effort by governments to address nationally significant policy issues. It will set out infrastructure priorities from a whole-of-state perspective and specific initiatives, with associated timeframes, to address infrastructure needs. These initiatives will include new investment opportunities, as well as options for <b>deferring</b> costly capital <b>expenditure</b> by better managing demand. Innovative ways to make better, more efficient use of existing infrastructure assets through the ‘smart’ application of communications technologies will also be explored...|$|R
