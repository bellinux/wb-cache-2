5|$|By {{the time}} of its cancellation, Thunderbirds had become widely popular in the UK and was being {{distributed}} extensively overseas. Grade, however, believed that without the financial boost of an American network sale, a full second series would fail to recover its production costs. He therefore asked Anderson to devise a new concept that he hoped would stand a <b>greater</b> <b>chance</b> of winning over the profitable US market. This became Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons.|$|E
5|$|Measurements of {{barometric}} {{pressure and the}} pressure tendency (the change of pressure over time) {{have been used in}} forecasting since the late 19th century. The larger the change in pressure, especially if more than , the larger the change in weather can be expected. If the pressure drop is rapid, a low pressure system is approaching, and there is a <b>greater</b> <b>chance</b> of rain. Rapid pressure rises are associated with improving weather conditions, such as clearing skies.|$|E

The official, Patrick F. Kennedy, said intelligence officials had told the State Department that letting Abdulmutallab keep his visa would allow for a <b>greater</b> <b>chance</b> of exposing the terrorist network.|$|E

5|$|Unlike Gregory, Braham was unperturbed by {{the events}} of 12 May 1944. Braham {{believed}} that while the war continued a trained combat pilot must engage the enemy at all costs. His experience allowed him a <b>greater</b> <b>chance</b> to survive the odds than a new pilot but he acknowledged his fortune could not last forever. Braham continued to fly operations deep into enemy airspace over Denmark, alone, and in daylight.|$|E
5|$|A {{large number}} of bombers only began {{receiving}} their warning and diversion orders at 00:45 hours. Halifaxes of No. 4 Group were finally alerted at this time. It {{was too late to}} prevent the Ju 88s from sighting, and then homing in on a mass of landing lights. Crews from NJG 2 and NJG 4 were able to deliver beam and Schräge Musik attacks against the unwary crews. Pilots that were alerted in time were able to carry out a corkscrew manoeuvre, and evade the attack. Some bombers were able to land but were then subjected to strafing attacks and destroyed though the crews were presented with a <b>greater</b> <b>chance</b> to escape.|$|E
5|$|Scottish Terriers have a <b>greater</b> <b>chance</b> of {{developing}} some cancers than other purebreds. According to {{research by the}} Veterinary Medical Data Program (1986), six cancers that Scotties appeared to be more at risk for (when compared to other breeds) are: (in descending order) bladder cancer and other transitional cell carcinomas of the lower urinary tract; malignant melanoma; gastric carcinoma; squamous cell carcinoma of the skin; lymphosarcoma and nasal carcinoma. Other cancers that are known to commonly affect Scotties include mast cell sarcoma and hemangiosarcoma.|$|E

5|$|The problem {{posed by}} the ratio is that the {{multiple}} specimens studied, died in the same place, but probably not in a sudden mass-death and so do not represent a single herd or contemporary population. The results may have been distorted by a <b>greater</b> <b>chance</b> for robust animals of getting fossilised or discovered. In an earlier study by Galton in 1982, {{it was suggested that}} individual difference in the sacral rib count of both Kentrosaurus and Dacentrurus might be an indication of dimorphism: females would have had an extra pair of sacral ribs, having also the first sacral vertebra connected to the ilium, in addition to the subsequent four sacrals.|$|E
5|$|Gilbertian mimicry {{occurs in}} the genus Passiflora. The leaves of this plant contain toxins that deter herbivorous animals. However, some Heliconius {{butterfly}} larvae have evolved enzymes that break down these toxins, allowing them to specialize on this genus. This has created further selection pressure on the host plants, which have evolved stipules that mimic mature Heliconius eggs near the point of hatching. These butterflies tend to avoid laying eggs near existing ones, which helps avoid exploitative intraspecific competition between caterpillars — those that lay on vacant leaves provide their offspring with a <b>greater</b> <b>chance</b> of survival. Most Heliconius larvae are cannibalistic, meaning that on leaves older eggs hatch first and eat the new arrivals. Thus, it seems that such plants have evolved egg dummies under selection pressure from these grazing herbivore enemies. In addition, the decoy eggs are also nectaries, attracting predators of the caterpillars such as ants and wasps as a further defence.|$|E
5|$|The Talara Tar Seeps in Peru {{represent}} a similar scenario, and have also produced fossils of Smilodon. Unlike in La Brea, {{many of the}} bones were broken or show signs of weathering. This may have been because the layers were shallower, so the thrashing of trapped animals damaged the bones of previously trapped animals. Many of the carnivores at Talara were juveniles, possibly indicating that inexperienced and less fit animals had a <b>greater</b> <b>chance</b> of being trapped. Though Lund thought accumulations of Smilodon and herbivore fossils in the Lagoa Santa Caves were due to the cats using the caves as dens, these {{are probably the result}} of animals dying on the surface, and water currents subsequently dragging their bones {{to the floor of the}} cave, but some individuals may also have died after becoming lost in the caves.|$|E

5|$|Throughout a {{great and}} open area, not only {{will there be a}} <b>greater</b> <b>chance</b> of {{favourable}} variations, arising from the large number of individuals of the same species there supported, but the conditions of life are much more complex from the large number of already existing species; and if some of these species become modified and improved, others will have to be improved in a corresponding degree, or they will be exterminated. Each new form, also, as soon as it has been improved, will be able to spread over the open and continuous area, and will thus come into competition with many other forms... the new forms produced on large areas, which have already been victorious over many competitors, will be those that will spread most widely, and will give rise to the greatest number of new varieties and species. They will thus play a more important role in the changing history of the organic world.|$|E
5|$|Arguably {{the most}} {{influential}} factor shaping this new class was the competitive nature of scholarly candidates entering civil service through the imperial examinations. Although not all scholar-officials came from the landholding class, sons of prominent landholders had better access to higher education, and thus greater ability to pass examinations for government service. Gaining a scholarly degree by passing prefectural, circuit-level, or palace exams in the Song period {{was the most important}} prerequisite in being considered for appointment, especially to higher posts; this was a departure from the Tang period, when the examination system was enacted on a much smaller scale. A higher degree attained through the three levels of examinations meant a <b>greater</b> <b>chance</b> of obtaining higher offices in government. Not only did this ensure a higher salary, but also greater social prestige, visibly distinguished by dress. This institutionalized distinction of scholar-officials by dress included the type and even color of traditional silken robes, hats, and girdles, demarcating that scholar-official's level of administrative authority. This rigid code of dress was especially enforced during the beginning of the dynasty, although the prestigious clothing color of purple slowly began to diffuse through the ranks of middle and low grade officials.|$|E
