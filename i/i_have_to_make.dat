Chemistry merely isolated the individual substances, it did not precisely identify them. It took Professor Hahn's method to do this. This is where his achievement lies.|$|E
500|$|During the song, the hyenas {{express their}} discontent with Scar for his {{inability}} {{to deal with a}} drought affecting the Pride Lands, begging for him to give them a [...] "fix of flesh" [...] to satisfy their [...] "needs". Through the course of the lyrics, Scar becomes increasingly paranoid about comparisons to his deceased brother Mufasa. After fixating on a plan to produce an heir for his kingdom, Scar makes sexual advances to Nala, who explicitly refuses him. Some of Scar's comments to Nala include: [...] "She's got those assets feminine, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> her mine!" [...] and [...] "Nala, my, my, how you have grown." ...|$|E

He {{said of his}} condition: [...] "I touch the tips of my fingers in a weird way; I don't step on cracks; if I'm going onto a new surface – be it carpet to concrete, or concrete to wood, or wood to concrete, any new surface – <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> sure all parts of my feet touch the ground equally before I touch that new thing.

500|$|In {{the days}} leading to the programme's broadcast, the IOC Ethics Commission {{launched}} an enquiry to investigate the accusations made in the documentary. Even though the Panorama reporters clearly stated that the London bid was nowhere associated with the investigation, the bid officials made further statements claiming the team had no knowledge and involvement, hoping {{to distance themselves from}} the scandal: [...] "What <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> clear is that London 2012 knew nothing about this—we have nothing to hide," [...] said Alan Pascoe, a London 2012 vice chairman, committing to [...] "do everything we can to co-operate [...] and take this story off the running order". Sebastian Coe, also a vice chairman at the time, reaffirmed Pascoe's words and assured [...] "London 2012 has acted properly and ethically throughout the bidding process." [...] After watching the documentary, IOC members and officials cleared London 2012 of any wrongdoing.|$|E
500|$|The {{music of}} the game was {{composed}} by Inon Zur, whose previous works included [...] and Fallout Tactics. Inon Zur worked with Jeremy Soule, the composer for Icewind Dale, to maintain {{the tone of the}} music. Inon Zur also worked closely with Interplay audio director Adam Levenson while composing the music; Zur and Levenson had worked together on several previous titles. Inon Zur said that while composing the theme for the game, [...] "I wrote and rewrote the main theme several times", and [...] "we tried to create a piece that would preserve the sound of the first Icewind Dalewe made great efforts to convey the new elements also. Capturing all of this in 30-45 seconds was not easy however I believe that we eventually found the right path for this game's soundtrack." [...] Zur described the composing process, [...] "After learning the storyboard and getting additional insight from the producers/music supervisor I'll start to compose. The thematic idea (main melody or rhythmical groove) comes first. Then comes the accompaniment followed by the orchestration," [...] and that, [...] "each piece should have its own unique flavour so every step is carefully examined. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> sure that the main idea of the piece is reflected in all these steps." [...] He called the composing experience [...] "very pleasant and rewarding." ...|$|E
