40|$|The {{problem of}} this study was to {{determine}} the need for more multiple-teacher <b>departments</b> of vocational agriculture in Nebraska. This problem was divided into two objectives: To determine the characteristics of single-teacher <b>departments</b> which differ from those of multiple-teacher <b>departments.</b> To study the <b>departments</b> of vocational agriculture in Nebraska and determine those which belong more closely to the population of multiple-teacher <b>departments</b> than to the population of single-teacher <b>departments.</b> To reach those objectives, a random sample of single-teacher <b>departments</b> and random sample of multiple teacher <b>departments</b> was drawn from six states. Data gathered were analyzed statistically to estimate population parameters for the population of single-teacher <b>departments</b> and the population of multiple-teacher <b>departments.</b> In order to fulfill the second objective and make the previously reported findings meaningful for Nebraska, it was necessary to compare the Nebraska situation to that of the six states reported in the study. From the data reported and analyzed, the conclusions may be drawn that there are differences between multiple-teacher <b>departments</b> of vocational agriculture and single-teacher <b>departments</b> of vocational agriculture, and that there are <b>departments</b> in Nebraska which in some ways fit into the population of multiple-teacher <b>departments</b> better than they do in the population of single-teacher <b>departments.</b> Advisor:Roy D.
