50|$|To {{produce the}} Roundup Ready canola, two genes were {{introduced}} into the canola genome. One is a gene derived from the common soil bacterium Agrobacterium strain CP4, that encodes for the EPSPS enzyme. The other is a gene from the Ochrobactrum anthropi strain LBAA, which encodes for the enzyme <b>glyphosate</b> <b>oxidase</b> (GOX). The CP4 EPSPS enzyme imparts high tolerance to glyphosate, so the plants can still create aromatic amino acids even after glyphosate is applied. GOX helps break down glyphosate within the plant.|$|E
40|$|The main {{objectives}} in sugar beet breeding, are to improve yield, quality {{and to develop}} disease resistance. The disease resistance may be developed either by conventional, or molecular breeding techniques. The molecular breeding techniques include, methods to genetically engineer plants for expression of introduced genes. A necessity {{for the production of}} transgenic plants, is the development of a screening system, to identify the transgenic shoots as effectively as possible. Multiplex PCR was therefore developed to efficiently screen putatively transgenic shoots. In a basic study, progenies of transgenic Nicotiana tabacum containing the nptII gene, expressed by the 35 S-, hsp 80 - or the hsp 80 promoter including the omega enhancer element were evaluated for expression of the transgene in a greenhouse trial. The expression varied depending on different factors such as copy number, positional effects, development and environment. Additionally, the 35 S promoter expressed the nptII gene to higher levels compared to the hsp 80 promoter even if the omega element was included. However, the omega element enhanced the expression of the nptII gene compared to hsp 80 without the omega element. Rhizomania is considered to be the most severe virus disease in sugar beet agriculture and difficult to control by conventional breeding. The disease causing agent is Beet Necrotic Yellow Vein Virus (BNYVV). The coat protein gene from BNYVV was introduced by Agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated transformation into sugar beet. Stable transgenic sugar beet plants showed resistance to BNYVV compared to the non transgenic plants in greenhouse and field trials. No coat protein was detected in the transgenic plants, but RNA-transcripts were found. Thus the resistance was most likely RNA - mediated and not dependent on protein accumulation. Transgenic sugar beet plants were produced containing a gene encoding the 5 -enolpyruvinylshikimate- 3 -phosphate synthase from Agrobacterium sp. CP 4, and a gene encoding the <b>glyphosate</b> <b>oxidase</b> from Achromobacter sp. LBAA, to obtain tolerance to the herbicide glyphosate (RoundupÂ®). More than 300 transgenic shoots were produced using several sugar beet genotypes for transformation. The plants were evaluated in greenhouse and field trials. Two candidates were identified that displayed agronomically useful tolerance to glyphosate. It was found that plants containing a single copy of the transferred genes tolerated higher levels of treatment with glyphosate compared to plants containing multiple copies...|$|E

The possibility of in waterhemp has been of concern to Midwest corn and soybean producers due to a heavy dependence on glyphosate as a weed control tool and the increased incidence and problematic nature of waterhemp in corn and soybean. Two populations of waterhemp in Platte and Holt County, Missouri were not controlled by glyphosate applications in glyphosate-resistant soybeans during the 2005 growing season. Progeny of the surviving waterhemp plants from Platte and Holt County were 19 - and 9 -fold resistant to glyphosate as compared to a susceptible population, respectively. Further investigations at the Platte County field revealed that 20 to 53 % of the population survived an 8 -fold application of glyphosate, and tank mixtures of <b>glyphosate</b> and protoporphyrinogen <b>oxidase</b> (PPO-) inhibiting herbicides provided inconsistent control across the location. Screenings of fourteen waterhemp accessions from the Platte county site indicated that glyphosate and acetolactate synthesis (ALS-) resistant waterhemp is present across a 503 -ha area and accessions resistant to glyphosate, ALS-, and PPO-inhibiting herbicides occur sporadically across a 87 -ha area. An array of conventional preemerge (PRE) and postemerge (POST) corn herbicides and glufosinate based herbicide programs demonstrated excellent control of the glyphosateresistant waterhemp population in corn. Management of glyphosate-resistant waterhemp in soybeans required the use of a PRE herbicide, with PRE fb POST programs providing the most consistent and adequate control of the population over a two year period...|$|R
