50|$|Canadian P.L. Robertson, {{though he}} was not the first person to patent the idea of socket-head screws, was the first to {{successfully}} commercialize them, starting in 1908. Socket screws rapidly grew in popularity, and are still a favorite of mechanics today for their resistance to wear and tear, compatibility with <b>hex</b> <b>keys,</b> and ability to stop a power tool when set. Though immensely popular, Robertson had trouble marketing his invention to the newly booming auto industry, for he was unwilling to relinquish his patents.|$|R

40|$|Objectives The aim of {{this work}} was to {{study the effects of}} P. major against the {{oxidative}} damage of isolated rat liver mitochondria. Methods The extracts were obtained using methanol (MeOH), ethyl acetate (EAc), dichloromethane (DCM), and hexane (<b>Hex)</b> as solvents. <b>Key</b> findings <b>Hex,</b> DCM, and EAc totally, and MeOH partially, inhibited ROS generation and lipid peroxidation of membranes induced by Fe 2 + or t-BOOH. However, only MeOH was able to prevent the t-BOOH-induced glutathione and NAD(P) H oxidation. All extracts chelated Fe 2 + and reduced DPP Hradicals. EPR analysis revealed that P. major exhibited potent scavenger activity for hydroxyl radicals. Conclusions The potent antioxidant activity exhibited by P. major was able to prevent oxidative mitochondrial damage, contributing to the understanding of its hepatoprotective action against ROS-mediated toxicity.

5000|$|Rick Swan {{reviewed}} the adventure in The Space Gamer No. 76. He {{commented on the}} adventure's format: [...] "Any solitaire module without a magic ink pen or a cellophane mystery views is already a step ahead in my book. Don't get me wrong - I like a good gimmick {{as much as the}} next guy, but a strong story is worth a hundred magic pens. This is no news to Matt Costello, who's put together a clever plot, a colorful cast of characters, and an engagingly tricky puzzle to come up with one of the best solitaire modules in a long time." [...] Swan stated: [...] "Even without a referee, the design of Final Challenge is remarkably rich, complete with a simple but effective combat system and a hex-grid wilderness map that randomly generates its own encounters. In fact, Final Challenge has more in common with the old Barbarian Prince boardgame than it does with most solitaire modules (and that's a compliment, because Barbarian Prince was one terrific game)." [...] He commented on the limitations of solo adventures: [...] "The most frequent problem with solitaire modules is their limited play value, and it's a problem shared by Final Challenge. I got through the whole thing in {{about an hour and a}} half, although I admit that I stumbled into the <b>key</b> <b>hexes</b> by sheer dumb luck. Replay value is non-existent - when the mystery is solved, that's it. A system of alternate plots would be nice, but that'll give something for Mr. Costello to work on next time." [...] Swan concluded by review by stating, [...] "Kids who gobble up those 'endless adventure' interactive paperbacks ought to shake an extra couple of dollars from their piggy banks and try a copy of Final Challenge. Solitaire fans could easily get spoiled by modules as good as this." ...|$|R
50|$|The Lasersaur {{is simple}} to build, using only basic tools (a hand drill, metric <b>hex</b> <b>key</b> set, screwdriver, wire cutter and {{soldering}} iron). Construction time varies between {{a few days}} to a few months. The unit will cut any dense organic material such as plywood and cloth as well as some plastics such as acrylic glass up to 0.5 in thick (depending on the power of the laser tube selected) with up to 100 µm of accuracy.|$|E
50|$|The Matrix also {{features}} a removable breech. The breech is able to be removed via a rod that runs {{the entire length of}} the body. The stock breech is threaded to accept Autococker threaded barrels and has a pair of rubber ball detents. The detents can easily be removed and cleaned or replaced using an o-ring pick to remove them and a <b>hex</b> <b>key</b> to push them back in. The completely removable breech leaves ways for aftermarket manufactures to develop new and improved breeches.|$|E
50|$|Less {{expensive}} {{options include}} replacing standard quick release skewers with skewers that need a standard <b>Hex</b> <b>key</b> to be opened. Despite hex keys not being very rare, this method still guards the bicycle from casual opportunists, needing the less common tool {{and more time}} to be removed. Pentagonal key skewers exist which bring some of {{the benefit of a}} locking skewer at a lower cost. Quicker and cheaper yet, and only effective against thieves unequipped with even a screwdriver, quick-release levers can be tied down by a common Hose clamp.|$|E
50|$|The Beretta Pico's {{magazine}} {{release is}} of the paddle variety, but much smaller than is ordinary for a weapon employing this feature. This is to aid concealment and a snag-free draw. The design of this release means that it is also ambidextrous in nature. The Iron sights can be removed and replaced {{with the use of}} a 1.5 mm <b>hex</b> <b>key,</b> as they are dovetailed into the slide of the pistol. The pistol also features a low profile slide stop and locks open on an empty magazine. Also, the internals of the pistol are removable to allow changing of grips, or to thoroughly clean the pistol, similar to the Beretta Nano.|$|E
50|$|Around 1979, the locking tremolo {{was invented}} by Floyd D. Rose. The locking trem became highly popular among 1980s heavy metal guitarists due to its {{extremely}} wide range of variation and tuning stability. The original Floyd Rose system {{was similar to the}} Fender synchronized tremolo, but with a number of extra mechanisms. The first to be added and most obvious is a locking plate on the head nut, tightened with a <b>hex</b> <b>key</b> to fix the strings at this point after tuning. This provides extra tuning stability, particularly during use of the vibrato arm, but as an unwanted side effect it also prevents further adjustment of the pitch using the machine heads.|$|E
5000|$|Freewheels are {{threaded}} onto an axle hub, using conventional right-hand threads. As {{the bicycle}} rider pedals, the freewheel is continuously kept tight, as chain torque {{is in the}} right-hand direction. This becomes a problem when the freewheel needs to be removed. Having undergone high torque from leg muscles, {{it is difficult to}} loosen and remove the freewheels. A freehub, on the other hand, has cogs that slide onto an axially-splined cylindrical outer shell. A lockring or the last cog(s) are threaded onto the freehub. It is fastened to the wheel hub itself with a hollow retaining screw (for example, using a <b>hex</b> <b>key</b> on some models) through which the axle is inserted during operation.|$|E
50|$|Klein Tools {{was founded}} in 1857 in Chicago, Illinois by German {{immigrant}} Mathias Klein. The first tool Klein made {{was a pair of}} side-cutting pliers for a telegraph lineman. The company grew as the telegraph and eventually telephone and electrical industries grew after the Civil War by adding 100 types of pliers in the 1910s. From the 1960s-1980s, the company expanded their product line to include leather and canvas products, occupational safety equipment, <b>hex</b> <b>key</b> wrenches, screwdrivers, nut drivers, as well as electrical terminals and connectors. Along the way, Klein acquired the R.H. Buhrke Company of Fort Smith, Arkansas in 1968 and the Vaco Products Company of Jonesville, Michigan in 1986. Also in the mid 1980s, the company started manufacturing adjustable wrenches in the US, which they had previously been purchasing from a Japanese supplier.|$|E
50|$|On {{almost all}} modern {{electric}} guitars, the bridge has saddles that are adjustable for each string so that intonation stays correct {{up and down}} the neck. If the open string is in tune, but sharp or flat when frets are pressed, the bridge saddle position can be adjusted with a screwdriver or <b>hex</b> <b>key</b> to remedy the problem. In general, flat notes are corrected by moving the saddle forward and sharp notes by moving it backwards. On an instrument correctly adjusted for intonation, the actual length of each string from the nut to the bridge saddle is slightly but measurably longer than the scale length of the instrument. This additional length is called compensation, which flattens all notes a bit to compensate for the sharping of all fretted notes caused by stretching the string during fretting.|$|E
50|$|Coffin lock is a slang {{term for}} a blind panel {{connector}} (also called a butt-joint fastener) often used in scenic construction to join together stage decks or scenery in a butt joint. These are two part connectors (male and female) that draw together and lock. The two most common types are the cam and acceptor and more traditional hook and pin version. These devices generally use an <b>hex</b> <b>key</b> to operate the locking mechanism via a small diameter hole either through the face or rear of the panel. When locked, the considerable mechanical advantage offered by the cam or hook holds the panels tightly together. Coffin locks can be installed directly into a mortise cut into each panel for total concealment except for the locking hole or mounted {{to the rear of}} the panels. Many small theatres use stock platforms with coffin locks built into the frames.|$|E
5000|$|The 10/22 was {{immediately}} popular upon its release. It {{was designed as}} a quality adult gun (with adult ergonomics) and not a cheap [...] "youth rifle". However, its easy handling characteristics, negligible recoil and inexpensive ammunition nonetheless make it ideal for young or inexperienced shooters. It is very popular for small-game hunters and those who want an inexpensive rifle firing inexpensive ammunition for target and plinking use. This popularity has led to many after-market modifications being available to improve performance, augment the rifle's looks, or increase its magazine capacity, leading the 10/22 {{to be one of the}} most customizable firearms made.Custom manufacturers also make [...] "clones" [...] of the 10/22, which are similar in design (most parts will interchange) but built to much higher specifications and costs. The 10/22 barrel uses a unique two-screw, V-block system to attach the barrel to the receiver, making removal and replacement of the barrel (which would require a gunsmith's work with most other rifles) very easy. This, when combined with the simple construction of the rest of the components, means that the average person can easily replace any part in the gun with nothing more than a screwdriver, a <b>hex</b> <b>key</b> and simple punches.|$|E
30|$|Throughout {{the testing}} a small {{constant}} vertical load of 10  N was applied, to counteract any vertical loosening, {{and to ensure}} engagement of the <b>hex</b> <b>key</b> in the implant hex hole. Before each test, the Instron crosshead was manually positioned in a neutral position, fully engaged with the implant but with no vertical or rotational force.|$|E
40|$|In {{determining}} the mechanical properties of biological tissues, accurate measurements of such geometrical attributes as cross-sectional area, volume and shape are needed. For soft tissues a non-contact technique is advantageous in {{determining the}}se. A low cost, image-based, non-contact solution has been developed, suitable {{for determining the}} cross-sectional profiles of soft tissues with quasi-prismatic shapes such as tendons and ligaments. Digital processing of images of the object, illuminated by a sheet of laser light, is used to obtain cross-sectional 'slices' through it. The method was validated by using it to measure several rigid reference objects: two circular cylinders, a <b>hex</b> <b>key</b> and torx key, whose shape and dimensions had also been obtained by independent metrology. The smooth circular cross-sectional shape of the cylinder, the flat parallel faces of the <b>hex</b> <b>key</b> and the concave faces of the torx key were all reproduced by the laser-slice method. Their linear dimensions were correctly resolved to within 0. 15 mm or less, and cross-sectional areas to within 0. 17 mm 2 or less. The method has been applied successfully to a selection of bovine digital extensor tendons. Some contained concavities on their surfaces, and their cross-sectional areas ranged from 14 mm 2 to 49 mm 2. The new method provides an accuracy and resolution better than or comparable to previous non-contact approaches, while avoiding some of their disadvantages. © 2008 IOP Publishing Ltd...|$|E
30|$|Mealy et al. (2013) {{designed}} a tool {{based on the}} previous work of Ngu (2004), which used a force gauge with an attached <b>hex</b> <b>key</b> probe (2  mm diameter). The Mealy, Wolfe and Gottuk study used the Ngu force gauge {{to ensure that the}} user performed their measurements with similar force (Mealy et al. 2013). They confirmed that 6.6 lbf (3  kgf) of force was best at matching the Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) chemical analysis of dehydration found in the Mann and Putaansuu study (2010). The Mealy study (2013) indicated that a variance on the depth measurements, regardless of the user, was negligible (~ 10  % variance) and that the method worked at reliably indicating fire travel, especially when no visible observations could be made. The Mealy, et al. study (2013) also demonstrated that when visual damage to the wall surfaces were unable to provide enough data for analysis that contour plots of the depth measurements “provided valuable insight into the areas within the enclosure that were subjected to the most severe thermal damage, the areas in which the initiating (primary first fuel) fire occurred”. This quote, however, is not to generalize that the area of origin is to be equated with the area of greatest thermal damage outside of this specific test series.|$|E
