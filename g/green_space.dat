However, few studies have explored the relationships between urban <b>green</b> <b>spaces</b> and LST across different seasons at different spatial scales. In this study, using Changchun, China as a case study, landscape ecology and comparative approaches were employed quantitatively to investigate the effects of the composition and configuration of urban <b>green</b> <b>spaces</b> on the urban thermal environments. LST maps were retrieved from Landsat 8 Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) data acquired on four dates that represented four different seasons, and detailed information of urban <b>green</b> <b>spaces</b> was extracted from high resolution imagery GF- 1. Normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI) and six landscape metrics at patch, class, and landscape level were used to characterize the spatial patterns of urban <b>green</b> <b>spaces.</b> The results showed that urban <b>green</b> <b>spaces</b> did have significant cooling effects in all seasons, except for winter, but the effects varied considerably across the different seasons and green types, and seemed to depend on the NDVI and size of urban <b>green</b> <b>spaces.</b> Compared to shape metrics, the negative relationships between the LST and the area and the NDVI of urban <b>green</b> <b>spaces</b> were more significant.
