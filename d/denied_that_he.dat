5|$|Controversy {{surrounding}} Levy's disappearance {{drew the}} attention of the American news media. Condit, a married man who represented the congressional district in which the Levy family resided, at first <b>denied</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had had an affair with her. Though police stated that Condit was not a suspect, Levy's family said they felt Condit was being evasive and possibly hiding information about the matter.|$|E
5|$|Gay {{made his}} track return in Beijing but his injury had reduced his 100m medal chances and Bolt and Powell were more {{favored to win}} the event. The much {{anticipated}} Gay, Bolt and Powell final never materialised, however, as Gay failed to qualify in the semi-finals. Finishing fifth after recording 10.05s, Gay <b>denied</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was still injured, but claimed the hamstring problem had upset his training schedule.|$|E
5|$|Nightclub hypnotist Ronald Pellar, {{also known}} as Ronald Dante or Dr. Dante (1969–1972). The couple met in 1969 in a Los Angeles discotheque and married that same year. After about six months of marriage, Pellar {{disappeared}} {{a few days after}} Turner had written a $35,000 check to him in order to help him in an investment; he used the money for other purposes. In addition, she later accused Dante of stealing $100,000 worth of jewelry from her. Dante <b>denied</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> stole from Turner and no charges were ever filed against him.|$|E

5|$|On 24 June Burke and McDougal {{departed}} for Falkirk {{to visit the}} latter's father. Burke knew that Hare was short of cash and had even pawned some of his clothes. When the couple returned, they found that Hare was wearing new clothes and had surplus money. After he was asked, Hare <b>denied</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had sold another body. Burke checked with Knox, who confirmed Hare had sold a woman's body for £8. It led to an argument {{between the two men}} and they came to blows. Burke and his wife moved into the home of his cousin, John Broggan (or Brogan), two streets away from Tanner's Close.|$|E
5|$|Ten {{days later}} Lord Kenmare (who {{had not been}} in Dublin at the time) <b>denied</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had given the least {{authority}} to any person to make any such statement in his name. However, his disavowal came too late: the anti-Catholic party in the convention had found time to organize themselves, and when the intended Reform Bill took shape it was known that the admission of Roman Catholics to the franchise was not to form part of the scheme.|$|E
5|$|When Theobald died in 1160, most {{observers}} believed that Foliot {{was the leading}} candidate to become archbishop of Canterbury. Traditionally, the see of Canterbury had been held by a monk, {{at least since the}} replacement of Stigand by Lanfranc in 1070. Although Foliot was a Cluniac monk, they were a subset of the Benedictine Order and thus the cathedral chapter at Canterbury, which was Benedictine but not Cluniac, would have had no objections to him on that score. Foliot <b>denied</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> ever lobbied for the office, but John of Salisbury and Thomas Becket apparently believed that Foliot desired it.|$|E

5|$|According to Oleg Gordievsky, {{the highest-ranking}} KGB officer ever to defect, and Pavel Sudoplatov, the former deputy {{director}} of Foreign Intelligence for the Soviet Union, Pontecorvo was a Soviet spy. However, Sudoplatov misidentified Pontecorvo as the spy codenamed Mlad, whom we now know was Ted Hall. While Pontecorvo always denied working on nuclear weapons, in Canada, Britain or the Soviet Union, he never confirmed or <b>denied</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was a spy. The actual evidence against him was flimsy. Frank Close noted that the blueprints of the Canadian NRX reactor had {{made their way to}} the Soviet Union, and Lona Cohen obtained a sample of uranium from the NRX after it started operation in 1947. Nunn May could not have been the culprit, so Pontecorvo is the prime suspect.|$|E
5|$|John Philip Kemble {{took over}} the producer's (director's) duties at Drury Lane later in 1788 when Sheridan was {{promoted}} to chief treasurer. Sheridan often employed Grimaldi in minor roles in Kemble's productions and continued {{to allow him to}} work concurrently at Sadler's Wells. Grimaldi took an interest in the design and construction of stage scenery and would often help to design sets. His stage performances {{over the next two years}} did not garner him the kind of success he had experienced under the management of his father, and the role of pre-eminent Clown in London productions soon fell to Jean-Baptiste Dubois, a versatile French acrobat, horseman, singer and strongman, with a formidable repertoire of comic tricks. Grimaldi worked as Dubois' assistant, although in later life he <b>denied</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had been the Frenchman's student.|$|E
5|$|Bradley {{raised the}} {{possibility}} of using nuclear weapons in Korea at a Joint Chiefs of Staff meeting on 9 July 1950 at Eisenhower's instigation, but there was no support for the idea. The Army staff sent a cable to Collins in Tokyo suggesting that he seek out MacArthur's opinion. In a teleconference on 13 July, Major General Charles L. Bolte proposed sending nuclear weapons. MacArthur had already turned down Air Force proposals to fire bomb North Korean cities, and suggested that atomic bombs could be used to isolate North Korea by taking out bridges and tunnels. The Army staff considered this impractical. However, on 28 July, the Joint Chiefs decided to send ten nuclear-capable B-29 bombers of the 9th Bombardment Wing to Guam as a deterrent to Chinese action against Taiwan. Truman publicly <b>denied</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was considering the use of nuclear weapons in Korea, but authorised the transfer to Guam of atomic bombs without their fissile cores. The deployment did not go well; one of the bombers crashed on takeoff from Fairfield-Suisun Air Force Base in California on 5 August, killing the mission commander, Brigadier General Robert F. Travis, and 18 others. The remaining nine bombers remained in Guam until 13 September, when they returned to the United States. The bomb assemblies stayed behind.|$|E

5|$|Brown {{opened his}} {{campaign}} with {{a speech at}} Bowling Green on August26, 1899. He answered many allegations {{that had been made}} about him, including claims that he had secretly been seeking the Democratic gubernatorial nomination all along, that he had ambitions of succeeding Senator William Joseph Deboe, and that following the nominating convention, he had agreed to speak on behalf of the Goebel ticket. Brown conceded that he desired Senator Deboe's senate seat and that he had agreed to accept the gubernatorial nomination if it had been offered to him, but he <b>denied</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had ever agreed to speak on Goebel's behalf. Outgoing Senator Blackburn also charged that Brown was bolting the party again, just as he had in supporting Stephen Douglas over John C. Breckinridge for president in 1860. Brown replied by quoting an article by William Jennings Bryan's Omaha World-Herald that asserted the right of an individual to vote against the nominee of his party if the individual deemed the nominee unfit.|$|E
5|$|Immediately after Warne and Waugh had met John in Colombo, Australia {{defeated}} Pakistan in {{a one-day}} match, scoring 7/179 and restricting Pakistan to 9/151 in reply. There were suspicions that the Pakistanis had thrown {{the game by}} batting slowly, although Warne said he had genuinely tried his best, pointing {{out that he was}} named man-of-the-match. Warne and May had alleged that Malik offered them money to bowl badly {{on the final day of}} the First Test in Karachi. Australia then reduced Pakistan from 3/157 to 9/258, and appeared set for victory, but a last-wicket partnership took them to the target of 314. The win was registered when wicket-keeper Ian Healy missed a stumping chance from Warne and the ball went for four byes. Warne <b>denied</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had thrown the match, again pointing out he was named man-of-the-match. Waugh had alleged that Malik offered him money to help Australia lose a one-day match during the same tour. He denied the allegation that he did so. Waugh scored an unbeaten 121, but it was not enough to prevent Australia from suffering a nine-wicket defeat.|$|E
5|$|In February 1943, {{during the}} second phase of Case White, Lukačević and his Chetniks jointly held the town of Konjic on the Neretva river {{alongside}} Italian troops. After being reinforced by German and NDH troops and some additional Chetniks, the combined force held the town against concerted attacks by the Partisans over a seven-day period. The first attack was launched by two battalions of the 1st Proletarian Division on 19 February and was followed by repeated attacks by the 3rd Assault Division between 22 and 26 February. Unable to capture the town and its critical bridge across the Neretva, the Partisans eventually crossed the river downstream at Jablanica. Ostojić was aware of Lukačević's collaboration with the Germans and NDH troops at Konjic but, at his trial, Mihailović <b>denied</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> himself was aware of it, claiming that Ostojić controlled the communications links and kept the information from him. During the fighting at Konjic, the Germans also supplied Lukačević's troops with ammunition. Both Ostojić and Lukačević were highly critical of what they described as Mihailović's bold but reckless tactics during Case White, indicating that Mihailović was largely responsible for the Chetnik failure to hold the Partisans at the Neretva.|$|E

5|$|Jabarona {{was filled}} with Dinka {{refugees}} who had fled the fighting {{in the south of}} Sudan and were forced to live together in sub-standard conditions. Bok settled among people who were from the Aweil area of North Bahr al Ghazal and began using his Christian name of Francis once again. Bok was quickly arrested by the Sudanese police for telling his friends and neighbors that he was a slave. Slavery in Sudan is a subject that was largely denied by the government in Khartoum and anybody that spoke of it could be arrested or even killed. Francis was interrogated numerous times while he was imprisoned and each time he <b>denied</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was a slave. He was finally released from prison after seven months. Once he was released Bok decided that he must leave Sudan. Through the help of some Dinka tribesman he was able to acquire a Sudanese passport on the black market and obtain a ticket for passage to Cairo.|$|E
5|$|Momolo {{returned}} to Bologna in late September 1858 after his two brothers-in-law wrote {{to him that}} if he stayed in Rome any longer the family might be ruined. He left Scazzocchio to represent the family's cause in Rome. Momolo shifted his priority to attempting to undermine Morisi's credibility, either by disproving aspects of her story or by showing her to be untrustworthy. He also resolved to confront Cesare Lepori, the grocer who Morisi said had both suggested the baptism and shown her how to perform it. Based on Morisi's story, Lepori had already been identified by many observers as being ultimately to blame for the affair. When Momolo visited his shop in early October, Lepori vehemently <b>denied</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had ever spoken to Morisi about Edgardo or any baptism, and said that he was prepared to testify to this effect before any legal authority. He claimed that he did not himself know how to administer baptism, so had such a conversation occurred it could hardly have gone as Morisi described.|$|E
5|$|On March31 {{the insurgents}} kept their {{part of the}} {{agreement}} by allowing the supply bill to be passed on second reading and the budget to be hoisted for ninety days. However, when the cabinet introduced its promised bill, the insurgents claimed {{that it was not}} as agreed and refused to support it. Instead, they demanded Aberhart's resignation and announced that they were prepared to take over the government within 24hours. A delegation put this demand to Aberhart in the evening of March31; according to them, he agreed to resign if they allowed the supply bill to pass a third reading. They did so, but Aberhart <b>denied</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had agreed to resign and refused to do so unless he was defeated in a general election. The insurgents, leery of Aberhart's oratorical powers and the reach of his weekly radio show, wanted to avoid an election. Even so, they rejected a motion by Low to raise their pay for the session by $200, seeing it as a crass bribe.|$|E

5|$|After the Second Test, McCabe was {{involved}} in an infamous incident that has caused speculation ever since. His captain Bradman {{was known for his}} reserved personality, did not drink and often eschewed social activities with teammates, preferring to privately listen to music or read. Combined with his success, Bradman gained a reputation for cockiness. In the 1930s, Australia had been divided along sectarian lines, with a sizeable Irish Catholic minority that included McCabe often pitted against Anglicans and/or Protestants such as Bradman (of Anglo-Irish descent), particularly practitioners of Freemasonry, leading to speculation that the tension was fuelled by religion. Four of the five Catholics in the team, McCabe, leading bowler Bill O'Reilly, along with Leo O'Brien and Chuck Fleetwood-Smith were summoned by the Board of Control to respond to allegations that they were undermining Bradman. Bradman denied having prior knowledge of the meeting, although the alleged infighting was reported in the press. Opening batsman Jack Fingleton was not invited, speculated to be due to his journalistic background, but Bradman later alleged that he was the ringleader. After that, Bradman's relationship with O'Reilly and Fingleton never recovered. During the meeting, players were variously accused of undermining Bradman's authority, laziness, lack of attention to fitness, but the board refused to specifically accuse those summoned. The details were leaked to the media, but the board denied that the meeting had taken place. Bradman <b>denied</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was anti-Catholic, saying that O'Reilly and Fingleton wanted to depose him from the captaincy and install McCabe in his place.|$|E
5|$|In June 2016, Ariel Sabar {{published}} an article in The Atlantic which identified the previous owner of the papyrus as Walter Fritz, rather than Laukamp, and provided further evidence for supposing that the papyrus was a forgery. Fritz initially denied being the papyrus' owner, but later admitted to it. Fritz was a former Egyptology student who left his job at a German museum after items from the museum went missing. For several years, he ran pornography websites featuring his wife, who believes that she can channel God and Michael the Archangel; she had even published a book of sayings that she believes God transmitted through her. The Atlantic speculated that Fritz may have been motivated to forge the text by financial issues - Fritz had recently been unable to sell his house - or a desire to make The Da Vinci Code a reality; he denies having any financial problems, but had seen The Da Vinci Codes film adaptation. Sabar had found that Fritz once ran an art website where he sold artworks which resembled ancient manuscripts. Fritz <b>denied</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> or anyone else forged the Gospel of Jesus' Wife, but admitted {{that he may have}} been able to do so had he tried. Fritz also stressed to Sabar that he never once claimed that the Gospel of Jesus' Wife was a genuinely ancient text.|$|E
