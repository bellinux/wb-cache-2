500|$|As {{the release}} of the new album approached, the band and its {{management}} found {{that they would have to}} navigate changes in the music industry, which Hurley described as [...] "a completely different place." [...] Facing declining record sales, the lack of a proper outlet for exhibition of music videos, and the economic crisis, Hurley commented that [...] "people are buying things they need to survive rather than records and concert tickets." [...] The group's 2007 album Infinity on High sold one million copies, which was considered a disappointment compared to From Under the Cork Trees sales of three million. Trohman attributed this to [...] "the same reason that nobody's records are selling that well: there's so much turmoil in the music industry, so much downsizing, and people are finding different ways to get their music more and more all the time. There's very little we can <b>do</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> as a band. All we can do is try to make great music and hope it connects with people." ...|$|E
2500|$|With {{about four}} minutes {{to play in}} the first half, McCoy {{connected}} with Limas Sweed for an apparent five-yard (5m) touchdown pass. [...] However, Sweed was flagged for offensive pass interference which the Austin American-Statesman later suggested was [...] "questionable". [...] According to the Austin American-Statesman, the refs [...] "blew the call" [...] stating that replays showed that Sweed was involved in some [...] "spirited hand checking while the ball was in the air, but neither player appeared to push or be guilty of interference". [...] All three broadcasters working the game for ABC also initially spoke out against the penalty call, although later acknowledging that enough interference had occurred to justify the call. [...] In an ABC half-time interview, Mack Brown said [...] "I thought it was a bad call," [...] but added [...] "There's nothing we can <b>do</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> We shouldâ€™ve done a better job on third down." ...|$|E

Old Whittlestaff just brought her into his house, and made her his own daughter. It isn't every one who will do that, you know." ...|$|R

60|$|That his wife's {{feelings}} were hurt he cared not a jot, {{but it would}} be an awkward thing to have it repeated in the town. Then there was this threatening letter; what was he to <b>do</b> <b>about</b> <b>that?</b> Other men had had similar warnings. Some had defied Captain Lud, and fortified their mills and held them. Many had had their property burned to the ground; some had been murdered. It wouldn't be a pleasant thing to drive about in the country knowing that at any moment he might be shot dead. His mill was some little distance out of the town; the road was dark and lonely. He dared not risk it.|$|E

60|$|Then {{she thought}} {{over the years}} he had been befriending her, and {{wondered}} what she should <b>do</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> Finally, being a sensible woman, she decided to do nothing. Had she known it before, or learned the truth by other means, she would have refused absolutely to touch Herbert Penfold's money; but it would be indeed a poor return for his kindness were she now, when he was ill and feeble, and was about to bestow still further benefits upon her, to refuse to permit him any longer to aid her. She wished, as she read the letter over again, that he had expressed some desire to see her. She should have liked to have thanked him in person, to have told him how grateful she felt for his care and kindness, to have taken his hand again if but for a minute.|$|E
6000|$|In the evening, {{when the}} ladies {{had gone to}} bed, Lord Chiltern took his friend off to the smoking-room. At Harrington Hall {{it was not unusual}} for the ladies and gentlemen to descend {{together}} into the very comfortable Pandemonium which was so called, when,--as was the case at present,--the terms of intimacy between them were sufficient to warrant such a proceeding. But on this occasion Lady Chiltern went very discreetly upstairs, and Adelaide, with equal discretion, followed her. It had been arranged beforehand that Lord Chiltern should say a salutary word or two to the young man. Maule began about the hunting, asking questions about this and that, but his host stopped him at once. Lord Chiltern, when he had a task on hand, was always inclined to get through it at once,--perhaps with an energy that was too sudden in its effects. [...] "Maule," [...] he said, [...] "you ought to make up your mind what you mean to <b>do</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> girl." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I say, Berkeley,' Lancaster droned out in {{the lobby}} of their club one {{afternoon}} shortly afterwards, 'what on earth am I ever to <b>do</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> socialistic friend of yours, Le Breton? I can't ever give him any political work again, you know. Just fancy! first, you remember, I set him upon the Schurz imprisonment business, and he nearly went mad then because I didn't back up Schurz for wanting to murder the Emperor of Russia. After that, just now the other day, I tried him on the Bodahl business, and hang me if he didn't have qualms of conscience about it afterwards, and trudge back through all the snow that awful Tuesday, to see if he couldn't induce Wilks to stop the press, and let him cut it all out at the last moment! He's as mad as a March hare, you know, and if it weren't that I'm really sorry for him I wouldn't go on taking socials from him any longer. But I will; I'll give him work as long as he'll do it for me on any terms; though, of course, it's obviously impossible under the circumstances to let him have another go at politics, isn't it?' ...|$|E
