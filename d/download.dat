5|$|Before {{the advent}} of music <b>downloads,</b> only sales of {{physical}} formats—such as CD, vinyl and cassette tape—contributed towards positions on the UK music charts. The first chart to record sales of <b>downloads</b> was the UK Singles <b>Downloads</b> Chart, which was launched in September 2004 to list weekly sales of single <b>downloads.</b> <b>Downloaded</b> singles were growing considerably at this time, rising ten-fold {{in the first half}} of 2005 compared to the same period in 2004. As single <b>downloads</b> grew in popularity, so did album <b>downloads</b> – 1.8million albums were <b>downloaded</b> in 2005; a further 825,000 were <b>downloaded</b> during the first three months of 2006.|$|R
40|$|Session 07 : Wireless and opticalInternational audienceThis paper {{proposes a}} replica {{selection}} scheme for parallel and multi-wavelength <b>downloading</b> in optical grid networks. In optical grid networks, files replicated at multiple sites are <b>downloaded</b> in parallel to reduce <b>downloading</b> time. Furthermore, each replica is <b>downloaded</b> with multiple wavelengths. Although parallel and multi-wavelength <b>downloading</b> can reduce <b>downloading</b> time, they raise blocking probability of file <b>downloading.</b> To resolve this problem, the proposed scheme selects replicas and establishes lightpaths based on wavelength availability. Through simulation experiments, {{we show that}} the proposed scheme efficiently improves blocking probability without increasing average <b>downloading</b> time...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} three-layer {{framework}} and a Globus-based architecture of grid-enabled multi-node <b>downloading</b> mechanism {{to facilitate a}} flexible and scalable <b>downloading</b> large scale distributed virtual environments. In our proposed architecture, each grid node {{is regarded as a}} potential <b>downloading</b> service provider when available. The performance of <b>downloading</b> DVE is proportional to the number of grid nodes participated in the <b>downloading</b> task. A specific component, multi-node <b>downloading</b> (MND) is devised for supporting remote multi-thread <b>downloading</b> DVE based on Globus platform. MND consists in a multi-node <b>downloading</b> protocol and an adaptive multi-node <b>downloading</b> balancing (AMDB) algorithm. MND is deploying onto our developing "Virtual Zhuhai Campus of Jilin University". Initial experimental results show the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach...|$|R
