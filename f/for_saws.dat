40|$|The Expanded Public Works Programme (EPWP) was {{announced}} by the former president, Mr Thabo Mbeki, in 2002. The EPWP is one {{part of an overall}} government strategy to reduce poverty through the alleviation and reduction of unemployment. It is a deliberate approach to ensure that participants gain the necessary skills, increase their capacity to earn an income and increase their chances of securing employment, and embarking on sustainable intervention in the second economy to address social and economic inequities. The EPWP aims to create employment in four sectors: infrastructure, the environment, the social sector and the economic sector. This study focused on the social sector, specifically the programme for social auxiliary workers. The goal {{of the study was to}} determine the impact of the EPWP on Social Auxiliary Work (SAWs) in the Ekurhuleni Metropolitan area. In order to achieve this goal, a quantitative research approach was adopted to determine whether the EPWP for social auxiliary workers is successful in poverty alleviation and skills development. A questionnaire was designed as a data collection instrument which was divided into the broad categories of biographic information, poverty alleviation and skills development. Quantitative data were collected through a process of group administration. Quantitative findings indicated that the EPWP <b>for</b> <b>SAWs</b> was successful in terms of poverty alleviation. The findings indicated that the majority of respondents who had no income before the EPWP <b>for</b> <b>SAWs</b> earned an income after enrolling into the EPWP. Those who had an income before EPWP indicated that their financial position improved after enrolling into the EPWP <b>for</b> <b>SAWs.</b> Through the findings respondents also indicated that after qualifying as SAWs, securing employment was easy. SAWs reported that they were able to afford groceries, technology (airtime), toiletries, non-consumables, accommodation and clothing after enrolling into the EPWP <b>for</b> <b>SAWs.</b> The study also found that the majority of the respondents indicated that their salary was making a big difference in their lives. Through the EPWP <b>for</b> <b>SAWs,</b> people who were unemployed received training and full time employment as SAWs. However, to confirm whether the EPWP was successful in poverty alleviation, the researcher inquired from the respondents if they agreed with the statement that the EPWP was successful in poverty alleviation. The majority of the respondents agreed that the EPWP <b>for</b> <b>SAWs</b> was successful in poverty alleviation and addressing unemployment. Therefore, it was concluded that the EPWP <b>for</b> <b>SAWs</b> was successful in poverty alleviation. In terms of skills development the researcher focused on the skills development before the respondents enrolled into the EPWP <b>for</b> <b>SAWs</b> and skills development after enrolling. It was concluded that the majority of respondents did not have financial skills; namely budgeting, saving and counting money, spending money wisely, investing money, depositing and transferring money. However, the findings of this study pointed to the conclusion that the respondents obtained those skills after enrolling into the programme. The study also focused on other forms of skills that the respondents obtained through the EPWP <b>for</b> <b>SAWs</b> training. Those skills included access to social services, communications and networking and bonding in the community. These forms of skills development were also explored in this research as it correlated with the Exit Level Outcomes (ELOs) of the SAW programme as registered with the South African Qualifications Authority (SAQA). It thus appeared that the respondents obtained all the skills requirements in line with the ELOs for the SAW qualification. The study concluded that the EPWP for SAW is successful in skills development. Dissertation (MSW) [...] University of Pretoria, 2015. tm 2015 Social Work and CriminologyMSWUnrestricte...|$|E

30|$|A {{shift to}} rail {{transport}} {{does not seem}} to be an option <b>for</b> <b>sawn</b> timber. The latest figures show that only 0.3  % of the Swedish forest industry exports sawn timber by rail [41]. The reason for this, according to Johan at Holmen Timber, is that transport costs account for a larger share of the value of goods <b>for</b> <b>sawn</b> timber than <b>for</b> pulp and paper. Railway transport implies huge costs associated with handling, making door-to-door transport by truck a more cost effective alternative. Long shipping distances are required to compensate for the extra handling costs. As <b>for</b> <b>sawn</b> timber, a modal shift to road transport is more likely than to rail when the sulphur limits of 2015 are implemented.|$|R

40|$|Counting {{the number}} of N-step self-avoiding walks (SAWs) on a lattice {{is one of the}} most {{difficult}} problems of enumerative combinatorics. Once we give up calculating the exact number of them, however, we have a chance to apply powerful computational methods of statistical mechanics to this problem. In this paper, we develop a statistical enumeration method <b>for</b> <b>SAWs</b> using the multicanonical Monte Carlo method. A key part of this method is to expand the configuration space of SAWs to random walks, the exact number of which is known. Using this method, we estimate a number of N-step SAWs on a square lattice, c_N, up to N= 256. The value of c_ 256 is 5. 6 (1) * 10 ^ 108 (the number in the parentheses is the statistical error of the last digit) and this is larger than one googol (10 ^ 100).

40|$|This article {{presents}} SAWdoubler, a package for counting {{the total number}} Z(N) of self-avoiding walks (SAWs) on a regular lattice by the length-doubling method, of which the basic concept has been published previously by us. We discuss an algorithm {{for the creation of}} all SAWs of length N, efficient storage of these SAWs in a tree data structure, and an algorithm for the computation of correction terms to the count Z(2 N) <b>for</b> <b>SAWs</b> of double length, removing all combinations of two intersecting single-length SAWs. We present an efficient numbering of the lattice sites that enables exploitation of symmetry and leads to a smaller tree data structure; this numbering is by increasing Euclidean distance from the origin of the lattice. Furthermore, we show how the computation can be parallelised by distributing the iterations of the main loop of the algorithm over the cores of a multicore architecture. Experimental results on the 3 D cubic lattice demonstrate that Z(28) can be computed on a dual-core PC in only 1 hour and 40 minutes, with a speedup of 1. 56 compared to the single-core computation and with a gain by using symmetry of a factor of 26. We present results for memory use and show how the computation is made to fit in 4 Gbyte RAM. It is easy to extend the SAWdoubler software to other lattices; it is publicly available under the GNU LGPL license. Comment: 29 pages, 3 figure...|$|E

40|$|A self-avoiding walk (SAW) is a path on a graph that visits each vertex at most once. The {{mean square}} {{displacement}} of an n-step SAW is the expected {{value of the}} square of the distance between the ending point and the starting point of an n-step SAW, where the expectation is taken with respect to the uniform measure on n-step SAWs starting from a fixed vertex. It is conjectured that the mean square displacement of an n-step SAW is asymptotically n^ 2 ν, where ν is a constant. Computing the exact values of the exponent ν on various graphs has been a challenging problem in mathematical and scientific research for long. In this paper we show that on any locally finite Cayley graph of an infinite, finitely-generated group with more than two ends, the number of SAWs whose end-to-end distances are linear in lengths has the same exponential growth rate as the number of all the SAWs. We also prove that for any infinite, finitely-generated group with more than one end, there exists a locally finite Cayley graph on which SAWs have positive speed - this implies that the mean square displacement exponent ν= 1 on such graphs. These results are obtained by proving more general theorems <b>for</b> <b>SAWs</b> on quasi-transitive graphs with more than one end, which make use of a variation of Kesten's pattern theorem in a surprising way, as well as the Stalling's splitting theorem. Applications include proving that SAWs have positive speed on the square grid in an infinite cylinder, and on the infinite free product graph of two connected, quasi-transitive graphs...|$|E
40|$|Beginning with a {{transfer}} matrix method used by R. C. Read to find the number of all polyominoes with at most a given number of rows, this method will be reinterpreted in several different ways. First, this {{transfer matrix method}} is redefined for convex polyominoes to find a few generating functions for convex polyominoes with some small number of rows. These transfer matrices are then reinterpreted {{in the form of}} an algebraic language which simplifies the computations. Finally for the convex polyomino problem, connections are found between the row sizes and a generating function is found for the number of all convex polyominoes enumerated according to area, width, height, and perimeter. ^ In an examination of general polyominoes, Read 2 ̆ 7 s transfer matrices are interpreted using an algebraic languages and by this interpretation, exact generating functions are found for polyominoes having 2, 3 and 4 rows. Also in the discussion of general polyominoes, programs are given to find large transfer matrices of numbers where the largest eigenvalue is the growth constant for the generating function. Approximations of these eigenvalues are found for 5, 6, 7 and 8 rows. ^ Finally the same algebraic language interpretation is given for a similar self-avoiding walk problem. The number of SAWs with a restriction on the maximum difference in the first position of the lattice points is found. By using the same technique as was used for general polyominoes, generating functions are given <b>for</b> <b>SAWs</b> with height at most 2 and 3 and the growth constants are given for a height of 4, 5 and 6. ...|$|E
40|$|Long linear {{polymers}} in strongly disordered {{media are}} well described by self-avoiding walks (SAWs) on percolation clusters. The length-distribution of these SAWs encompasses to distinct averages, viz. the averages over cluster- and SAW-conformations. For the latter average, {{there are two}} basic options, one being static and one being kinetic. It is well known for static averaging that if the disorder of the underlying medium is weak, differences to the ordered case appear merely in non-universal quantities. Using dynamical field theory, we show that {{the same holds true for}} kinetic averaging. For strong disorder, i. e., the medium being close to the percolation point, we employ a field theory for the nonlinear random resistor network in conjunction with a real-world interpretation of Feynman diagrams, and we calculate the scaling exponents for the shortest, the longest and the mean or average SAW to 2 -loop order. In addition, we calculate to 2 -loop order the entire family of multifractal exponents that governs the moments of the the statistical weights of the elementary constituents (bonds or sites of the underlying fractal cluster) contributing to the SAWs. Our RG analysis reveals that kinetic averaging leads to renormalizability whereas static averaging does not, and hence, we argue that the latter does not lead to a well-defined scaling limit. We discuss the possible implications of this finding for experiments and numerical simulations which have produced wide-spread results for the exponent of the average SAW. To corroborate our results, we also study the well-known Meir-Harris model <b>for</b> <b>SAWs</b> on percolation clusters. We demonstrate that this model leads back to 2 -loop order to the renormalizable real world formulation with kinetic averaging if the replica limit is consistently performed at the first possible instant of the calculation.
