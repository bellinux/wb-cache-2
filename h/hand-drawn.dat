5|$|The {{book has}} 14 {{monochrome}} photographs taken mainly by Newby, and two <b>hand-drawn</b> maps. The novelist Evelyn Waugh wrote a preface that mentions the book's whimsy and its Englishness.|$|E
5|$|A <b>hand-drawn</b> {{sketch of}} the gunfight was made by John Flood with Wyatt Earp's {{assistance}} on September 15, 1921; it was sold at auction in October 2010 for $380,000. The map describes {{the position of a}} number of witnesses and all of the participants with the exception of Ike Clanton, who fled from the gunfight.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, Lasseter renamed Walt Disney Feature Animation to Walt Disney Animation Studios, and re-positioned {{the studio}} as an {{animation}} house that produced {{both traditional and}} computer-animated projects. In order {{to keep costs down}} on <b>hand-drawn</b> productions, animation, design, and layout were done in-house at Disney while clean-up animation and digital ink-and-paint were farmed out to vendors and freelancers.|$|E
5|$|In the {{tradition}} of the show's animation style, Stan is composed of simple geometrical shapes and primary colors. He is not offered the same free range of motion associated with <b>hand-drawn</b> characters; his character is mostly shown from only one angle, and his movements are animated in an intentionally jerky fashion.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, <b>hand-drawn</b> feature {{animation}} production {{continued at}} the Feature Animation Florida studio, where the films could be produced at lower costs. Lilo & Stitch, an offbeat comedy {{written and directed}} by Chris Sanders and Dean DeBlois, became the studio's first bonafide hit since Tarzan upon its summer 2002 release, earning $273 million worldwide against a $80 million production budget.|$|E
5|$|Similar to Tangled, Frozen {{employed}} a unique artistic style by blending together features of both computer-generated imagery (CGI) and traditional <b>hand-drawn</b> animation. From the beginning, Buck knew Giaimo {{was the best}} candidate to develop the style he had in mind– which would draw from the best Disney <b>hand-drawn</b> classics of the 1950s, the Disney Little Golden Books, and mid-century modern design– and persuaded {{him to come back}} to Disney to serve as the art director for Frozen. Buck, Lasseter, and Giaimo were all old friends who had first met at the California Institute of the Arts, and Giaimo had previously served as the art director for Disney's Pocahontas (1995), which Buck had worked on as a supervising animator.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} art {{featured on}} the game's box art and instruction manual is {{in the style of}} a comic book, and the characters are portrayed as toy dolls that come to life to fight. This presentational style has since been omitted in the sequels, which feature trophies instead of dolls and in-game models rather than <b>hand-drawn</b> art.|$|E
5|$|It uses <b>hand-drawn</b> stick figure {{graphics}} and writing characterized by surreal humor, word play, parody and references to popular culture. In KoL, a player's character fights monsters for experience, and acquiring meat (the game's currency), and/or items, through a turn-based system. Players may also {{interact with each}} other through player versus player competition, participate in the in-game economy by trading goods and services, organize their characters into clans, work together to complete clan dungeons, and speak to each other in many different chat channels.|$|E
5|$|On December 22, 2011, {{following}} {{the success of}} Tangled, Disney announced a new title for the film, Frozen, and a release date of November 27, 2013. A month later, {{it was confirmed that}} the film would be a computer-animated feature in stereoscopic 3D, instead of the originally intended <b>hand-drawn</b> animation. Anderson-Lopez and Lopez joined the project and started writing songs for Frozen in January 2012. On March 5, 2012, it was announced that Buck would be directing, with Lasseter and Peter Del Vecho producing.|$|E
5|$|The entire {{movie was}} sketched out via <b>hand-drawn</b> storyboards and then re-created as computer-generated 3D {{animatics}} {{with all of}} the 2D background photographs digitally painted to resemble the 1939 setting. With the animatics as a guide, grids were created to map camera and actor movements with digital characters standing in for the real actors. The grids were made into actual maps on the blue screen stage floor to help the actors move around invisible scenery.|$|E
5|$|The {{graphics}} for the game's {{characters are}} cel-shaded, and an implemented technique helps flatten the character models from any angle {{that the camera}} views them from, in order to recreate the 2D, <b>hand-drawn</b> look seen in the show. The development team found it particularly difficult to render Lisa's spiky hair as 2D in the game's 3D environment. The Wii version has lower-quality graphics than the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions due to the console's inferior hardware. There is a different cover for the game on each console.|$|E
5|$|To promote Street Fighter IV and {{the character}}, artwork of Rufus {{including}} <b>hand-drawn</b> sprites {{of the character}} is included in Xbox Live themes. Worldwide restaurants Wan Zhu Ji and Benitora Gyoza Bo offered four Street Fighter IV themed meals, which included a nimono meat dish named after the character. At organized events, Capcom distributed a limited series of Street Fighter IV cards to promote the arcade title, one of which features Rufus in a fighting stance.|$|E
5|$|Yoshi's Island led to {{a strong}} year for Yoshi as a character. IGN's Thomas added that the <b>hand-drawn</b> style of Yoshi's Island made the computer-generated Donkey Kong Country appear outdated, though both games sold well, and Rareware {{included}} a Yoshi cameo in their sequel, , released that same year. Yoshi's Island graphics and characters were also incorporated into the 1996 Super NES tile puzzle game Tetris Attack.|$|E
5|$|An {{inventory}} {{drawn up}} at the Hôtel de la Reine after Catherine's death shows her {{to have been a}} keen collector. Listed works of art included tapestries, <b>hand-drawn</b> maps, sculptures, rich fabrics, ebony furniture inlaid with ivory, sets of china, and Limoges pottery. There were also hundreds of portraits, for which a vogue had developed during Catherine's lifetime. Many portraits in her collection were by Jean Clouet (1480–1541) and his son François Clouet (1572). François Clouet drew and painted portraits of all Catherine's family and of many members of the court. After Catherine's death, a decline in the quality of French portraiture set in. By 1610, the school patronised by the late Valois court and brought to its pinnacle by François Clouet had all but died out.|$|E
5|$|Antonucci, an {{advocate}} of <b>hand-drawn</b> animation, wanted to ensure Ed, Edd n Eddy was produced in a way similar to cartoons from the 1940s to 1970s. As a result, the series {{was the last to}} use cel animation; the cels were shipped to Korea for creating the initial animation, and then later edited back at Antonucci's a.k.a. Cartoon studio. The first four seasons were produced traditionally, though the series was forced to switch to digital ink and paint in 2004, starting with Ed, Edd n Eddy's Jingle Jingle Jangle.|$|E
5|$|Homeworld is a {{real-time}} strategy game set in space. Gameplay, {{as in most}} real-time strategy titles, {{is focused}} on gathering resources, building military forces, and using them to destroy enemy forces and accomplish an objective. The game includes both single-player and multiplayer modes; the single-player mode consists of one story-driven campaign, broken up into levels. In each level, the player has an objective to accomplish before they can end the level, though the ultimate objective of the mission can change as the level's story unfolds. Between each of the 16 levels is a <b>hand-drawn,</b> black-and-white cutscene with narrative voiceovers.|$|E
5|$|Like other Japanese anime, The Garden of Words {{was created}} using a {{combination}} of <b>hand-drawn</b> animation, rotoscoping and computer animation (CGI), with the latter facilitating the realistic appearance of the film's rain sequences. Shinkai made half of the film's backgrounds by using his photographs as a base and then drawing over the top with Adobe Photoshop, while the other half were fictional settings created with traditional animation and computer graphics. As with his other films, the backgrounds are vivid and meticulously drawn scenery while the characters are drawn with less detail, though they are still convincing and realistic.|$|E
5|$|On {{arrival at}} North or South station coffins would usually be {{unloaded}} onto a <b>hand-drawn</b> bier and pulled by LNC {{staff to the}} appropriate chapel. While this was taking place the mourners were escorted to the waiting rooms at the station. On arrival at the chapels first and second class funerals would generally have a brief service (third class funerals had a single service in the appropriate chapel for all those being buried). For those burials where the funeral service had already been held at either a parish church or the LNC's London terminus the coffins would be taken directly from the train to the grave.|$|E
5|$|Series {{creator and}} {{executive}} producer Butch Hartman wrote Wishology, along with head writer {{and executive producer}} Scott Fellows and writer Kevin Sullivan, who joined the series beginning its fifth season. Gary Conrad, who has directed several episodes of the series since its second season, served as the director for Wishology. Composer Guy Moon, {{who has worked on}} the music for The Fairly OddParents since its inception, composed the music. Like the entire series, Wishology was produced in <b>hand-drawn</b> animation mixed with computer animation by Frederator and Billionfold Studios for Nickelodeon. The production of the trilogy required 18 months to complete, according to Toon Zone's interview with Hartman.|$|E
5|$|Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island is a 1995 {{platform}} {{video game}} developed {{and published by}} Nintendo for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. A prequel to the Mario franchise, the game casts players as Yoshi as he escorts Baby Mario through nearly 50 levels in order to reunite him with his brother Luigi, who had been kidnapped by Baby Bowser's minions. Yoshi runs and jumps to {{reach the end of}} the level while solving puzzles and collecting items. In a style new to the series, the game has a <b>hand-drawn</b> aesthetic and is the first to have Yoshi as its main character. The game introduces his signature abilities to flutter jump, produce eggs from swallowed enemies, and transform into vehicles.|$|E
5|$|The Burbank studio's {{remaining}} <b>hand-drawn</b> productions, Treasure Planet and Home on the Range, continued production. Treasure Planet, {{an outer}} space retelling of Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island, was a pet project of writer-directors Ron Clements and John Musker. It received an IMAX release and generally positive reviews but was financially unsuccessful upon its November 2002 release, {{resulting in a}} $74 million write-down for The Walt Disney Company in fiscal year 2003. The Burbank studio's 2D departments closed {{at the end of}} 2002 following completion of Home on the Range, a long-in-production feature that had been known as Sweating Bullets.|$|E
5|$|The {{basis for}} Family Guy was MacFarlane's thesis film The Life of Larry, created in 1995 {{while he was}} a student at the Rhode Island School of Design. A sequel was {{conceived}} in 1996 called Larry & Steve, which aired in 1997 as a segment of Cartoon Network's World Premiere Toons. Both shorts caught the attention of Fox, who contacted MacFarlane in 1998 to develop a series called Family Guy based on the films. A <b>hand-drawn</b> pilot was created by MacFarlane with a budget of $50,000, which led to the series being accepted for production. It was rated TV-PG-L (TV-14-L on Adult Swim).|$|E
5|$|The {{game had}} high sales, selling 400,000 copies {{in its first}} week of release and 700,000 {{by the end of}} 1999. Reviews were less {{positive}} than for prior games in the series. Critics gave considerable acclaim to its vibrant and colorful <b>hand-drawn</b> graphics and soundtrack by Yoko Shimomura, but were critical of the lack of a clear main storyline, stating that it left the game feeling disjointed. The game was re-released as a part of both the PlayStation's and Square Enix's best-sellers lines. It was released as a PSOne Classic in Japan and North America.|$|E
5|$|The game's <b>hand-drawn</b> aesthetic—a style {{new to the}} series—descends from {{producer}} and Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto's distaste for the computer pre-rendered graphics of the game's contemporary Donkey Kong Country. Yoshi's Island was released in Japan in August 5, 1995, and worldwide two months later. Some of its special effects were powered by a new Super FX2 microchip. The game was rereleased for the Game Boy Advance with few changes in 2002 under the title Yoshi's Island: Super Mario Advance 3. Nintendo later released this version via the Nintendo 3DS and Wii U Virtual Console.|$|E
5|$|Briarcliff Manor's fire company {{existed for}} more than a year before Briarcliff Manor's incorporation. Frederick C. Messinger (a fireman in Kingston for ten years) and {{thirteen}} local men founded the private fire company in 1901. Thirty-six men became the company's charter members on March 4, 1902, and dues were set at 25cents per month. On April 15 of that year, the company took the name Briarcliff Steamer Company No. 1. The company's first equipment was a 1901 <b>hand-drawn</b> chemical apparatus, with a tank containing a mixture of water and sodium bicarbonate. Sulfuric acid would be added to the tank, creating carbon dioxide, which would propel the solution through the hose and help extinguish the fire. That first apparatus was white, which Messinger thought more visible than the conventional red in a village without street lights, and the village's engines remain white.|$|E
5|$|By 2001, {{the notable}} successes of computer-animated films from Pixar and DreamWorks such as Monsters, Inc. and, Shrek, respectively, against Disney's lesser returns for The Emperor's New Groove and Atlantis: The Lost Empire {{led to a}} growing {{perception}} that <b>hand-drawn</b> animation was becoming outdated and falling out of fashion. In March 2002, just after the successful release of Blue Sky Studios' computer-animated feature Ice Age, Disney laid off most of the employees at the Feature Animation studio in Burbank, downsizing it to one unit and beginning plans to move into fully computer animated films. A handful of employees were offered positions doing computer animation. Morale plunged to a low {{not seen since the}} start of the studio's ten-year exile to Glendale in 1985. The Paris studio was also closed in 2003.|$|E
5|$|Development of {{the film}} began after {{production}} had finished on The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996). Instead of another musical, the production team decided to do an action-adventure film inspired by the works of Jules Verne. Atlantis was notable for adopting the distinctive visual style of comic book creator Mike Mignola. At {{the time of its}} release, the film had made greater use of computer-generated imagery (CGI) than any of Disney's previous traditionally animated features; it remains one of the few to have been shot in anamorphic format. Linguist Marc Okrand created a language specifically for use in Atlantis, with James Newton Howard providing the film's score. The film was released at a time when audience interest in animated films was shifting away from <b>hand-drawn</b> animation toward films with full CGI.|$|E
5|$|LucasArts {{released}} a remake with updated audiovisuals titled The Secret of Monkey Island: Special Edition in July 2009 for iPhone, Microsoft Windows, and Xbox 360 exclusively via digital distribution. PlayStation 3, macOS and iPad versions followed early in 2010 for download on their respective services. LucasArts confirmed the game's development on June 1, 2009; rumors appeared several days earlier when the Xbox 360 {{version of the}} game received an USK rating. The game was first displayed {{to the public at}} the 2009 E3 in June. The remake features <b>hand-drawn</b> visuals with more detail, a remastered musical score, voice work for characters, and a hint system. The developers included the function to switch between 2009 and original audiovisuals at will. The voice actors included Dominic Armato as Guybrush Threepwood and Earl Boen as LeChuck; most had provided voice work in sequels to The Secret of Monkey Island.|$|E
5|$|Ni no Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch was {{developed}} for the PlayStation 3. The team planned to bring the game to the console {{from the beginning of}} development, but opted to work on the DS version of the game beforehand due to the larger number of DS users in Japan at the time. The team found the PlayStation 3 allowed them to render the game world with great detail, using the hardware to its full potential to present the animation, world and music. Hino felt that the PlayStation 3 version allowed the game's music to accompany the imagery, which was not possible on the DS version. The team found particular technical difficulty in animating Oliver's cape, which was overcome by a combination of mathematical calculations and <b>hand-drawn</b> motions by the programmers and graphic artists, respectively.|$|E
5|$|The {{characters}} and objects {{are composed of}} simple geometrical shapes and primary colors. Most child characters are {{the same size and}} shape, and are distinguished by their clothing, hair and skin colors, and headwear. Characters are mostly presented two-dimensionally and from only one angle. Their movements are animated in an intentionally jerky fashion, as they are purposely not offered the same free range of motion associated with <b>hand-drawn</b> characters. Occasionally, some non-fictional characters are depicted with photographic cutouts of their actual head and face in lieu of a face reminiscent of the show's traditional style. Canadians on the show are often portrayed in an even more minimalist fashion; they have simple beady eyes, and the top halves of their heads simply flap up and down when the characters speak.|$|E
5|$|The {{first team}} of writers {{assembled}} {{for the show}} consisted of Chris Sheridan, Danny Smith, Gary Janetti, Ricky Blitt, Neil Goldman, Garrett Donovan, Matt Weitzman, and Mike Barker. The writing process of Family Guy generally starts with 14 writers that take turns writing the scripts; when a script is finished it {{is given to the}} rest of the writers to read. These scripts generally include cutaway gags. Various gags are pitched to MacFarlane and the rest of the staff, and those deemed funniest are included in the episode. MacFarlane has explained that normally it takes 10 months to produce an episode because the show uses <b>hand-drawn</b> animation. The show rarely comments on current events for this reason. The show's initial writers had never written for an animated show; and most came from live-action sitcoms.|$|E
5|$|Composer Yoshihiro Ike infused {{the music}} with the sorrow {{borne by the}} karas, and the {{atmosphere}} conveyed by the background. Ike obliged the team's request for Japanese flavored music, and studied kabuki tunes accompanying actors as they strike their , a picturesque pose to establish their character. He planned to use taikos (Japanese drums) to further enhance the music, but felt the show had taken on an international outlook and discarded the notion. He wanted his music to match {{the quality of the}} show, and refrained from composing them until he had watched the pre-dubbed version of the first episode. He composed most of his music as he watched the pre-dubbed episodes to synchronize their tempo and dynamics with the action in the show. He chose Prague Symphony Orchestra to perform the main theme because he felt the background of their city and its people suited the character of Karas. Other departments also took extraordinary measures in producing the show. The sound crew procured a Nissan Skyline GT-R and recorded its engine noise for several runs. These were used for the tunnel chase scenes which involved a <b>hand-drawn</b> 1972–77 Skyline. The editing team took the additional step of editing cels post-voice recording to ensure lip movements were in synch with the voices. These extra work and the hybrid 2D-3D approach inflated the budget of the production to three times the usual amount spent on an original video animation.|$|E
5|$|Federal agents {{obtained}} a warrant {{to search the}} house of McVeigh's father, Bill, after which they broke down the door and wired the house and telephone with listening devices. FBI investigators used the resulting information gained, along with the fake address McVeigh had been using, to begin their search for the Nichols brothers, Terry and James. On April 21, 1995, Terry Nichols learned {{that he was being}} hunted, and turned himself in. Investigators discovered incriminating evidence at his home: ammonium nitrate and blasting caps, the electric drill used to drill out the locks at the quarry, books on bomb-making, a copy of Hunter (a 1989 novel by William Luther Pierce, the founder and chairman of the National Alliance, a white nationalist group) and a <b>hand-drawn</b> map of downtown Oklahoma City, on which the Murrah Building and the spot where McVeigh's getaway car was hidden were marked. After a nine-hour interrogation, Terry Nichols was formally held in federal custody until his trial. On April 25, 1995, James Nichols was also arrested, but he was released after 32days due to lack of evidence. McVeigh's sister Jennifer was accused of illegally mailing bullets to McVeigh, but she was granted immunity in exchange for testifying against him.|$|E
5|$|The {{transition}} from 2D graphics to 3D environments overlaid on pre-rendered backgrounds {{was accompanied by}} a focus on a more realistic presentation. In previous entries, the sizes for characters and environments were fixed, and the player saw things from a scrolling perspective. This changed with Final Fantasy VII; environments shifted with camera angles, and character model sizes shifted depending on both their place in the environment and their distance from the camera, giving a sense of scale. The choice of this highly cinematic style of storytelling, contrasting directly with Square's previous games, was attributed to Kitase, who was a fan of films and had an interest in the parallels between film and video game narrative. Character movement during in-game events was done by the character designers in the planning group. While designers normally cooperate with a motion specialist for such animations, the designers taught themselves motion work, resulting in each character's movements differing depending on their creators—some designers liked exaggerated movements, while others went for subtlety. Much of the time was spent on each character's day-to-day, routine animations. Motion specialists were brought in for the game's battle animations. The first characters the team worked with were Cloud and Barret. Some of the real-time effects, such as an explosion near the opening, were <b>hand-drawn</b> rather than computer animated.|$|E
5|$|To {{create the}} {{character}} animations for the game, actors {{were placed in}} front of a gray background and performed the motions, which were recorded on videotape (using a broadcast-quality, $20,000 Sony camera instead of the standard Hi8 camera used for the original Mortal Kombat). The video capture footage was then processed into a computer, and the background was removed from selected frames to create sprites. Towards the end of the game's development, they opted to instead use a blue screen technique and processed the footage directly into the computer for a similar, simpler process. The actors were lightly sprayed with water to give them a sweaty, glistening appearance, while post-editing was done on the sprites afterward to highlight flesh tones and improve the visibility of muscles, which Tobias felt set the series apart from similar games using digitized graphics. Animations of Shang Tsung morphing into other characters were created by Midway's John Vogel using a computer, while <b>hand-drawn</b> animations were used for other parts of the game, such as the Fatalities. For animating Goro and Kintaro, clay sculptures were created by Tobias' friend Curt Chiarelli and then turned into 12-inch latex miniatures that were used for stop motion filming. Because of technical restrictions, the actors' costumes had to be simple and no acrobatic moves such as backflips could have been recorded; the hardest moves to perform were some of the jumping kicks.|$|E
5|$|Hatoful Boyfriend is {{the first}} game {{developed}} by manga artist and writer Hato Moa—author of the series Vairocana and a former Dengeki Comic Grand Prix honoree—under her dōjin circle PigeoNation Inc. As she had no experience with game development prior to Hatoful, Hato initially wanted {{to start with a}} visual novel, as she believed it was an easier game type for amateur developers to make; the format also allowed visuals to easily accompany her stories, something that she, as a manga artist, was accustomed to and viewed as being necessary in her work. She first came up with the concept for Hatoful as a 2011 April Fools' Day joke: despite her lack of familiarity with the genre, she initially intended to create a parody of otome game stereotypes. Birds in particular were used as a theme due to Hato's fondness for pigeons; however, this was also partially due to Hato's prioritization of writing over illustrating, as the use of bird photographs instead of <b>hand-drawn</b> sprites allowed her more freedom to focus on the script. The first incarnation of the game was created over the course of half a day and posted as a browser game made with Adobe Flash; but due to strong word of mouth from social media it was taken down after immense traffic caused the web server it was hosted on to crash on two separate occasions. Following the unexpected popularity of the Flash game, development began on a longer visual novel using the FamousWriter game engine.|$|E
