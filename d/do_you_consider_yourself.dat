60|$|The {{tickets for}} Lady Carbury and Hetta had of course been sent before the elopement;--and also, {{as a matter}} of course, no {{reference}} had been made to them by the Melmotte family after the elopement. Lady Carbury herself was anxious that that affair should not be considered as having given cause for any personal quarrel between herself and Mr Melmotte, and in her difficulty had consulted Mr Broune. Mr Broune was the staff on which she leant at present in all her difficulties. Mr Broune was going to the dinner. All this of course took place while Melmotte's name was as yet unsullied as snow. Mr Broune saw no reason why Lady Carbury should not take advantage of her tickets. These invitations were simply tickets to see the Emperor surrounded by the Princes. The young lady's elopement is 'no affair of yours,' Mr Broune had said. 'I should go, if it were only for the sake of showing that <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not <b>consider</b> <b>yourself</b> to be implicated in the matter.' Lady Carbury did as she was advised, and took her daughter with her. 'Nonsense,' said the mother, when Hetta objected; 'Mr Broune sees it quite in the right light. This is a grand demonstration in honour of the Emperor, rather than a private party;--and we have done nothing to offend the Melmottes. You know you wish to see the Emperor.' A few minutes before they started from Welbeck Street a note came from Mr Broune, written in pencil and sent from Melmotte's house by a Commissioner. 'Don't mind what you hear; but come. I am here and as far as I can see it is all right. The E. is beautiful, and P.'s are as thick as blackberries.' Lady Carbury, who had not been in the way of hearing the reports, understood nothing of this; but of course she went. And Hetta went with her.|$|R

5000|$|The {{creation}} of a national Mexican identity, especially after the Mexican Revolution, emphasized Mexico’s indigenous and European past; it passively eliminated the African ancestors and contributions. Though Mexico had {{a significant number of}} African slaves during colonial times, most of the African-descended population were absorbed into the surrounding Mestizo (mixed European/indigenous) and indigenous populations through unions among the groups. Evidence of this long history of intermarriage with Mestizo and indigenous Mexicans is also expressed in {{the fact that in the}} 2015 census, 64.9% (896,829) of Afro-Mexicans also identified as indigenous. It was also reported that 9.3% of Afro-Mexicans speak an indigenous language. About 1.2% of Mexico's population has significant African ancestry, with 1.38 million recognized during the 2015 Intercensus Estimate. Numerous Afro-Mexicans in the 21st century are naturalized black immigrants from Africa and the Caribbean. The 2015 Intercensus Estimate was the first time in which Afro-Mexicans could identify themselves as such and was a preliminary effort to include the identity before the 2020 census. The question asked on the survey was [...] "Based on your culture, history and traditions, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>consider</b> <b>yourself</b> black, meaning Afro-Mexican or Afro-descendant?"

40|$|Background: Weight loss {{is known}} to {{decrease}} the health risks associated with being overweight and obese. Awareness of overweight status is an important determinant of weight loss attempts and may have more of an impact on one 2 ̆ 7 s decision to lose weight than objective weight status. We therefore investigated the perception of weight among adults attending primary care clinics in Karachi, Pakistan, and compared it to their weight categories based on BMI (Body Mass Index), focusing on the underestimation of weight in overweight and obese individuals. We also explored the factors associated with underestimation of weight in these individuals. Methods: This was a cross sectional study conducted on 493 adults presenting to the three primary care clinics affiliated with a tertiary care hospital in Karachi, Pakistan. We conducted face to face interviews to gather data on a pre-coded questionnaire. The questionnaire included detail on demographics, presence of comorbid conditions, and questions regarding weight assessment. We measured height and weight of the participants and calculated the BMI. The BMI was categorized into normal weight, overweight and obese based on the revised definitions for Asian populations.

40|$|SUMMARY: OBJECTIVE: To compare {{self-reported}} {{perception of}} weight with biomedically measured {{body mass index}} in different socioeconomic and cultural groups. METHOD: Of the original North West Adelaide Health (Cohort) Study (n = 4060) 68. 5 % (n = 2780) underwent a computer assisted telephone interview (CATI) answering additional questions related to their social and health status. The participants were asked "In terms of your weight, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>consider</b> <b>yourself</b> to be… too thin, a little thin, normal weight, a little overweight or very overweight". The self-perception of weight was compared to biomedically measured BMI (body mass index). Binary logistic regression {{was used to compare}} those participants who were obese (BMI ≥ 30) with the self-perceived weight status of 'a little overweight'. The outcome measures included the Socioeconomic Indexes for Areas Index of Relative Socioeconomic Disadvantage (SEIFA IRSD), country of birth and household income. RESULTS: Of those that were underestimating their obese weight status, 41. 5 % were male and 32. 2 % female. The highest misclassification was for those who considered their weight to be 'a little overweight', with 59. 6 % biomedically measured with a BMI of over 30. The odds of being biomedically measured obese (BMI ≥ 30) were compared to those who considered themselves to be 'a little overweight'. Those that misreported their weight status and were biomedically obese, {{were more likely to be}} living in the lowest quintile of disadvantage, have a household income of less then $ 20, 000 or be born in Eastern or Western Europe. CONCLUSION: There are psychosocial, sociocultural and social environmental influences related to the perception of weight status. Future research will need to understand the processes whereby people are not aware they have a weight problem. Natasha J. Howard, Graeme J. Hugo, Anne W. Taylor, David H. Wilso...|$|E

We compared the responses with the categorized BMI. To identify factors associated with underestimation of weight, we used simple and multiple logistic regression to calculate crude odds Ratios (OR) and adjusted Odds Ratios (AOR) with 95 % Confidence Intervals. Results Overall 45. 8 % (n = 226) of the study participants were obese and 18 % (n = 89) were overweight. There was poor agreement between self perception and actual BMI (Kappa = 0. 24, SE = 0. 027, p Conclusion In this cross sectional survey, we observed marked discordance between the actual and perceived weight. Underestimation of individual weight was more common in older participants (≥ 40 years), men, participants happy with their weight and participants not aware of their ideal weight. Accurate perception of one's actual weight is critical for individuals to be receptive to public health messages about weight maintenance or weight loss goals. Therefore educating people about their correct weight, healthy weights and prevention of weight gain are important steps towards addressing the issue of obesity in Pakistan. </p...|$|E
