The inner wall is uneven with diagonal grooves and heaps where the material has slumped. The interior floor is also somewhat uneven, especially in the eastern half.

40|$|Aim: The {{purpose of}} this article is to review {{modification}} and outcome of secondary rhinoplasty along with Abbι flap for correction of secondary bilateral cleft lip deformity. Materials and Methods: A total of thirteen patients of secondary bilateral cleft lip-nose deformity having tight upper lip, lack of acceptable philtral column, Cupid′s bow definition, <b>irregular</b> <b>lip</b> scars, and associated nasal deformity were selected. All the patients received Abbι flap and simultaneous nasal correction. All cases were treated during a period of three years. Mean patient age at the time of the operation was 21 years, and ranged from 16 to 27 years. The average follow-up period was three years. Results: Assessment of results was based on comparing preoperative and postoperative clinical photographs done by surgeon and patient relatives and patient satisfaction questionnaires. The columellar lengthening and upper lip vermillion correction achieved was satisfactory. There were no perioperative complications such as airway obstruction, bleeding, infection, wound disruption, or flap necrosis...|$|E

40|$|In this work, a novel airframe/propulsion {{integration}} design method of the wing-body configuration for hypersonic cruise aircraft is proposed, where the configuration is integrated with inward-turning inlets. With {{the help of}} this method, the major design concern of balancing the aerodynamic performance against the requirements for efficient propulsion can be well addressed. A novel geometric parametrically modelling method based {{on a combination of}} patched class and shape transition (CST) and COONs surface is proposed to represent the configuration, especially a complex configuration with an <b>irregular</b> inlet <b>lip</b> shape. The modelling method enlarges the design space of components on the premise of guaranteeing the configuration integrity via special constraints imposed on the interface across adjacent surfaces. A basic flow inside a cone shaped by a dual-inflection-point generatrix is optimized to generate the inward-turning inlet with improvements of both compression efficiency and flow uniformity. The performance improvement mechanism of this basic flow is the compression velocity variation induced by the variation of the generatrix slope along the flow path. At the design point, numerical simulation results show that the lift-to-drag ratio of the configuration is as high as 5. 2 and the inlet works well {{with a high level of}} compression efficiency and flow uniformity. The design result also has a good performance on off-design conditions. The achievement of all the design targets turns out that the {{integration design}} method proposed in this paper is efficient and practical...|$|R
6000|$|It is {{for this}} rare, {{precious}} quality of truthfulness that I delight in many Dutch paintings, which lofty-minded people despise. I find a source of delicious sympathy in these faithful pictures of a monotonous homely existence, {{which has been the}} fate of so many more among my fellow-mortals than a life of pomp or of absolute indigence, of tragic suffering or of world-stirring actions. I turn, without shrinking, from cloud-borne angels, from prophets, sibyls, and heroic warriors, to an old woman bending over her flower-pot, or eating her solitary dinner, while the noonday light, softened perhaps by a screen of leaves, falls on her mob-cap, and just touches the rim of her spinning-wheel, and her stone jug, and all those cheap common things which are the precious necessaries of life to her--or I turn to that village wedding, kept between four brown walls, where an awkward bridegroom opens the dance with a high-shouldered, broad-faced bride, while elderly and middle-aged friends look on, with very <b>irregular</b> noses and <b>lips,</b> and probably with quart-pots in their hands, but with an expression of unmistakable contentment and goodwill. [...] "Foh!" [...] says my idealistic friend, [...] "what vulgar details! What good is there in taking all these pains to give an exact likeness of old women and clowns? What a low phase of life! What clumsy, ugly people!" ...|$|R

The Badawi of the Hijaz, {{and indeed}} the race generally, has a small eye, round, restless, deep-set, and fiery, {{denoting}} keen inspection with an ardent temperament and an impassioned character. Its colour is dark brown or green-brown, and the pupil is often speckled. The habit of pursing up the skin below the orbits, and half closing the lids to exclude glare, plants the outer angles with premature crows’-feet. Another peculiarity is the sudden {{way in which the}} eye opens, especially under excitement. This, combined with its fixity of glance, forms an expression now of lively fierceness, then of exceeding sternness; whilst the narrow space between the orbits impresses the countenance in repose with an intelligence not destitute of cunning. As a general rule, however, the expression of the Badawi face is rather dignity than that cunning for which the Semitic race is celebrated, and there are lines about the mouth in variance with the stern or the fierce look of the brow. The ears are like those of Arab horses, small, well-cut, “castey,” and elaborate, with many elevations and depressions. The nose is pronounced, generally aquiline, but sometimes straight like those Greek statues which have been treated as prodigious exaggerations of the facial angle. For the most part, it is a well-made feature with delicate nostrils, below which the septum appears: in anger they swell and open like a blood mare’s. I have, however, seen, in not a few instances, pert and offensive “pugs.” Deep furrows descend from the wings of the nose, showing an uncertain temper, now too grave, then too gay. The mouth is <b>irregular.</b> The <b>lips</b> are either bordes, denoting rudeness and want of taste, or they form a mere line. In the latter case there is an appearance of undue development in the upper portion of the countenance, especially when the jaws are ascetically thin, and the chin weakly retreats. The latter [p.83] feature, however, is generally well and strongly made. The teeth, as usual among Orientals, are white, even, short and broad—indications of strength. Some tribes trim their mustaches according to the “Sunnat”; the Shafe’i often shave them, and many allow them to hang Persian-like over the lips. The beard is represented by two tangled tufts upon the chin; where whisker should be, the place is either bare or is thinly covered with straggling pile.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Objective: To {{establish}} {{the frequency of}} 82 morphological features {{in a sample of}} Brazilian children (between 3 and 13 years old), to understand the influence of age, gender, and ethnicity. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study that evaluated 239 children with typical development (between 3 and 13 years old) regarding the presence of 82 morphological characteristics. A previously described protocol, based on the London Dysmorphology Database, was applied to evaluate the sample. This protocol was culturally adapted to Brazilian Portuguese. Results: The frequency of 82 morphological characteristics was established in the sample; of 82 characteristics, 50 % were considered morphological anomalies (frequency less than 4 %). At least 25 % of the sample presented more than one minor morphological anomaly. Age was shown to influence the frequency of the following morphological characteristics: widow's peak, prominent antihelix, prominent upper <b>lip,</b> <b>irregular</b> or crowded teeth, and clinodactyly, but had no influence on the frequency of minor morphological anomalies. Gender influenced dysplastic ears and attached earlobe, but had no influence on the frequency of minor morphological anomalies; ethnicity showed influence on camptodactyly and prominent antihelix. A statistically significant divergence was observed regarding 43 of the 73 morphological characteristics that could be compared with literature data (58. 9 %). Conclusions: The study determined the frequency of 82 morphological characteristics in 239 children with typical development. Age was the variable that showed more influence on the frequency of morphological characteristics, and comparison with literature data showed that the frequency depends on variables such as age and ethnicity...|$|R
