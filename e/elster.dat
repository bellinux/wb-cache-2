This was rejected because buses were not able to give the comfort and reliability of a train. The idea was proposed again in 1922 by the director of the Norwegian Public Roads Administration. Among the strongest opponents to the bus alternative was Ingolf <b>Elster</b> Christensen, County Governor of Sogn og Fjordane and later parliamentarian, who stated that the Nordre Bergenhus County (today Sogn og Fjordane County Municipality) had paid part of the regional financing of the Bergen Line on condition that they receive a branch line to the Sognefjord.|$|E
5|$|Peyton {{has noted}} that the {{distinct}} personalities of the series' characters meant that he considered some of them {{much more difficult to}} convincingly write for than others. He found Cooper to be particularly tricky to write for, as the character had an idiosyncratic view of the world which needed to be maintained; but found Audrey Horne to be his favourite to work on as he considered the character—and actress Sherilyn Fenn—to be both sexy and smart, and to have developed substantially as the series progressed. The character of Madeline Ferguson was named for characters in Alfred Hitchcock's 1958 film Vertigo—Kim Novak's Madeleine <b>Elster</b> and James Stewart's Scottie Ferguson. Ferguson's cousin, the murdered schoolgirl Laura Palmer, was similarly named after the titular character in Otto Preminger's 1944 film Laura; while other characters in the series would also be named for film noir characters.|$|E

40|$|In {{recent years}} the {{technological}} industry has undergone massive growth. Electrical and electronic equipment reaches obsolescence faster than ever before. If internationally accepted rules of safe processing are adhered to, recycling is not profitable. It is often exported and recycled primitively, a profitable and attractive occupation for the poor. However, primitive recycling is extremely harmful to the environment {{as well as the}} personal health of the recycler. Focusing on Nigeria, this project investigates why people engage in the industry in spite of the hazardous risks involved. The matter is analyzed with Zygmunt Bauman’s theory of ambivalence and ethical legislation to understand external influences, Jon <b>Elster’s</b> theory of rational choice to understand the internal process of rationalization, and Jon <b>Elster’s</b> theory of social choice to put actions into a societal perspective. The analysis shows that the government’s indecisiveness on the issue has very little influence on the individual’s choice, and through rationalization of the possible means of subsistence, the e-waste industry becomes an attractive choice because it offers a stable income...|$|R

40|$|This paper aims {{to present}} a Baudrillardian reading of Don Delillo’s Point Omega in the {{framework}} of Baudrillard’s definition of the contemporary world as ‘hyperreal’ and also his twin concepts of ‘ecstasy and inertia’. According to Baudrillard, the contemporary time is the hyperreal era in which subjects {{do not have access to}} ‘real’ primarily because they are supplied with the ‘simulations’ first and then with the ‘real’ entity and probably never confronted with the ‘real’ itself through media, advertisements, and virtual world. Thus, the perception they have from incidents, objects, places and even other people is ‘hyperreal’; edited, censored, beautified and exaggerated versions of reality; more real than real. In this study Point Omega will be examined as Delillo’s ‘hyperreal’ version of Alfred Hitchcock’s Psycho since the movie is screened in the course of the novel and despite the similarities between the novel and the movie they end contrastingly. Symbolically ‘real’ is not found in the novel due to ‘Mobius spiraling negativity’ which is one of the features of Baudrillard’s definition of ‘hyperreal’ age. Baudrillard believes in the triumph of objects over subjects. While the object’s world is perpetually cultivating frenziedly, objects and technologies begin to dominate the stupefied subjects consequently he states when the objects are moving toward their ‘ecstasy’, the subjects are stricken in ‘inertia’. This supremacy of objects and technologies will be displayed in Point Omega regarding Richard <b>Elster’s</b> inert behavior and reaching the ‘omega point’ that Teilhard de Chardin envisions for human race is rendered impossible due to <b>Elster’s</b> destiny {{in the framework of}} Baudrillard’s concept of evolution...|$|R

He instructed the detachment at Merseburg, which had been reinforced to two and a half battalions, to pull back to Halle. The Leipzig force was also recalled, while he sent back a detachment to hold Dessau on the Elbe River. He deployed his main force on high ground on Halle's south side, with his battle line facing northwest toward the city and his left bent back. The two and a half battalions from Merseburg were left to defend the bridges {{on the east side of}} Halle, together with a dragoon regiment.

25|$|In the {{following}} year, Prince Józef Poniatowski {{was appointed to}} command the VIII Corps, which was rebuilt as an all-Polish unit. At the Battle of Leipzig on 1619 October 1813 the corps consisted of the 26th Infantry Division under General of Division Kaminiecki, the 27th Infantry Division led by General of Division Jean Henri Dombrowski (Jan Henryk Dąbrowski), the 27th Light Cavalry Brigade of Brigadier General Jan Nepomucen Umiński, and the 44 guns of the corps artillery under Colonel Redel. Marshal Joachim Murat assumed command of a wing that included the II, V, and VIII Corps plus cavalry. His orders were to delay the advance of the Army of Bohemia from the south. On 16 October, the 26th Division fought near the villages of Markkleeberg and Dölitz {{in the southern part}} of the battlefield. Meanwhile, Dombrowski's division became involved in the fighting to the north. During the rear guard fighting on the 19th, a panicky sapper prematurely blew up the bridge over the Weisse <b>Elster</b> River, trapping the VII, VIII, and XI Corps in Leipzig. The wounded Poniatowski drowned trying to escape and the encircled troops surrendered.|$|E
25|$|The {{discovery}} by Hertz in 1887 {{that the}} incidence of ultra-violet light on a spark gap facilitated the passage of the spark, led immediately to a series of investigations by Hallwachs, Hoor, Righi and Stoletow on the effect of light, and especially of ultra-violet light, on charged bodies. It was proved by these investigations that a newly cleaned surface of zinc, if charged with negative electricity, rapidly loses this charge however small it may be when ultra-violet light falls upon the surface; while if the surface is uncharged to begin with, it acquires a positive charge when exposed to the light, the negative electrification going out into the gas by which the metal is surrounded; this positive electrification can be much increased by directing a strong airblast against the surface. If however the zinc surface is positively electrified it suffers no loss of charge when exposed to the light: this result has been questioned, but a very careful examination of the phenomenon by <b>Elster</b> and Geitel has shown that the loss observed under certain circumstances is due to the discharge by the light reflected from the zinc surface of negative electrification on neighbouring conductors induced by the positive charge, the negative electricity {{under the influence of the}} electric field moving up to the positively electrified surface.|$|E
5000|$|U.S. {{presidents who}} have used this {{pronunciation}} include Dwight D. Eisenhower, Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush as well as U.S. Vice President Walter Mondale. [...] In his 2005 book, Going Nucular, linguist Geoffrey Nunberg suggests that the reasons underlying the differing pronunciations of this word may be different from president to president. Whereas Eisenhower's pronunciation most likely arose from his lack of familiarity with the word (having first learned it in mid-life), Bush's usage may represent a calculated effort to appeal to populist sentiment, though this theory is rejected by linguist Steven Pinker.

40|$|Philosophers {{and social}} {{scientists}} have offered a variety of arguments for making certain types of decisions by lot. This paper examines three such arguments. These arguments identify indeterminacy, fairness and incentive effects as the major reasons for using lotteries to make decisions. These arguments are central to Jon <b>Elster?s</b> study of lottery use, Solomonic judgments (1989), and so the paper focuses upon their treatment in this work. Upon closer examination, all three arguments have the same basic structure, in that they appeal to a single effect lotteries can have ? a sanitizing effect. Lotteries have this effect because they make possible decision-making that makes no use of reasons, whether good or bad. All arguments for or against decision-making by lot must ultimately appeal to this effect...|$|R
40|$|This article {{combines}} {{theory and}} narrative to shed {{new light on}} the politics surrounding the making of central bank independence in contemporary Britain.

The government removed a contentious issue from party politics in order to signal competence and enforce internal discipline. Building on <b>Elster's</b> constraint theory, the paper argues that Brown adopted a pre-commitment strategy aimed at binding others.
