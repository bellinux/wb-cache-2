5|$|Amy is a 12-year-old, pink-furred {{anthropomorphic}} hedgehog girl {{created by}} Kenji Terada for the Sonic the Hedgehog manga series. She debuted in 1992, wearing a <b>dress</b> <b>and</b> with her then-orange hair pulled into 2 ponytails. The character was redesigned {{the next year}} for the Sega CD game, Sonic CD. Like the Sonic CD introduction Metal Sonic, an early grayscale concept sketch shows her very similar to her appearance in the game (except her shoes, which became larger and flatter). Her coloring was red at first (including her skirt), except for a green shirt. The character had two other names in game previews: Rosy the Rascal and Princess Sally (a character in the Sonic the Hedgehog TV series). Amy received her present design, with a red <b>dress</b> <b>and</b> boots, in Sonic Adventure.|$|E

30|$|A 45 -itemized Chinese Stress <b>Dressing</b> <b>and</b> Eating Survey (CSDES) was {{developed}} by the researchers. The researchers adopted a survey that assessed stress, <b>dressing,</b> <b>and</b> eating among females in the United States (Kandiah and Saiki 2010). The CSDES consisted of four sections: (i) effort to control <b>dressing</b> <b>and</b> making healthy eating choices, (ii) <b>dress</b> items selected <b>and</b> foods eaten during perceived stressful conditions (PSC), (iii) <b>dress</b> items selected <b>and</b> foods eaten during perceived non-stressful conditions (PNSC), and (iv) demographics. Prior {{to the start of the}} research the CSDES which included multiple choice, yes/no, and four point Likert scale questions was tested for reliability and validity. The Likert scale questions had response options ranging from “great” to “little or no” or “definitely disagree” to “definitely agree.” Likert scale questions were also used to assess participants’ effort put forth to control <b>dressing</b> <b>and</b> making healthy eating choices.|$|R

This version is {{almost exactly the same}} as the original, with the only difference being that some early shots were Spears dances in front of the multicolored background are replaced by shots of Spears with a short blonde bob wig wearing a purple <b>dress</b> <b>and</b> in front of a black background with flashing lights.|$|E
5|$|During this time, Alexander adopted some {{elements}} of Persian <b>dress</b> <b>and</b> customs at his court, notably the custom of proskynesis, either a symbolic kissing of the hand, or prostration on the ground, that Persians showed to their social superiors. The Greeks regarded the gesture as the province of deities and believed that Alexander meant to deify himself by requiring it. This cost him the sympathies {{of many of his}} countrymen, and he eventually abandoned it.|$|E
5|$|Hiram Berry (Jeff Goldblum) and Burt Hummel (Mike O'Malley) {{attempt to}} devise a last-minute scheme to derail the wedding. Rachel is {{reluctant}} to start without Quinn, who has driven home {{to pick up her}} bridesmaid's <b>dress,</b> <b>and</b> texts Quinn to find out where she is. Quinn is responding to Rachel's text when a truck crashes into the driver's side of her car.|$|E

5|$|Individuals with {{schizophrenia}} {{may experience}} hallucinations (most reported are hearing voices), delusions (often bizarre or persecutory in nature), and disorganized thinking and speech. The last may range from loss of train of thought, to sentences only loosely connected in meaning, to speech {{that is not}} understandable known as word salad. Social withdrawal, sloppiness of <b>dress</b> <b>and</b> hygiene, and loss of motivation and judgment are all common in schizophrenia.|$|E
5|$|Morocco had {{a similar}} effect on Rix as it did on many artists who visited. Paintings were created in high-keyed colours that {{captured}} the intense north African light, and most works focussed on the figures, <b>dress</b> <b>and</b> activity of the people, or the local architecture.|$|E

5|$|The {{culture of}} Persia {{influenced}} Palmyrene military tactics, <b>dress</b> <b>and</b> court ceremonies. Palmyra had no large libraries or publishing facilities, and it lacked an intellectual movement characteristic of other Eastern {{cities such as}} Edessa or Antioch. Although Zenobia opened her court to academics, the only notable scholar documented was Cassius Longinus.|$|E

Hedren passes her screen test and is groomed for the starring role in Hitchcock's latest film, The Birds; the director instructs her about her <b>dress</b> <b>and</b> appearance.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} {{immigrants}} were from China. Several hundred Chinese arrived in California in 1849 and 1850, and in 1852 more than 20,000 landed in San Francisco. Their distinctive <b>dress</b> <b>and</b> appearance was highly recognizable in the goldfields. Chinese miners suffered enormously, enduring violent racism from white miners who aimed their frustrations at foreigners. To this day, {{there has been}} no justice for known victims. Further animosity toward the Chinese led to legislation such as the Chinese Exclusion Act and Foreign Miners Tax.|$|E

5|$|Although Hall's author's note disclaims any {{real-world}} {{basis for}} the ambulance unit that Stephen joins, she drew heavily on the wartime experiences of her friend Toupie Lowther, co-commander of the only women's unit {{to serve on the}} front in France. Lowther, like Stephen, came from an aristocratic family, adopted a masculine style of <b>dress,</b> <b>and</b> was an accomplished fencer, tennis player, motorist and jujitsu enthusiast. In later years she said the character of Stephen was based on her, which may have been partly true.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{had little}} {{interest}} in formal education and rarely attended classes, Sylvester was enrolled at Jordan High School. He graduated in 1969 at the age of 21; in his graduation photograph, he appeared in drag wearing a blue chiffon prom <b>dress</b> <b>and</b> beehive hairstyle. By the end of the decade, the Disquotays had begun to drift apart, with a number of them abandoning cross-dressing and others recognizing that they were trans women and undergoing sex reassignment surgery. Sylvester always considered himself male and began to tone down the feminine nature of his clothing, aiming for a more androgynous look which combined male and female styles and which was influenced by the fashions of the hippie movement.|$|E
5|$|Although van der Weyden did not title the work, and the sitter's {{name is not}} {{recorded}} {{in any of the}} early inventories, the style of her dress has been used to place the picture very late in van der Weyden's career. The c.1460 dating is based on the high-fashion <b>dress</b> <b>and</b> the work's apparent chronological position in the evolution of van der Weyden's style. However, it is possible that it was executed even later (van der Weyden died in 1464).|$|E
