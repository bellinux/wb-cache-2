25|$|The Brussels Loom was {{introduced}} into England towards {{the middle of}} the eighteenth century marked {{the beginning of a new}} era in carpet-weaving. It was the first loom on which a pile carpet could be woven mechanically, the pile consisting of rows of loops, formed over wires inserted weftwise during weaving and subsequently withdrawn. Brussels was the first type of carpet to be woven in a loom incorporating the <b>jacquard</b> <b>pattern</b> selecting mechanism and in 1849 power was applied to the loom by Biglow in the U.S.A.|$|E
5000|$|Bellangé was {{designated}} several times as arbitrator or expert in trials {{brought before the}} tribunal of commerce. At the end of 1811, he became the [...] "Imperial Furniture Warehouse." [...] Suites of furniture by Bellangé were provided for many European courts including the Netherlands, Sweden, and Denmark. Bellange's work is often classified as Empire Style {{a reference to the}} First French Empire under Napoleon I. Motifs included swans favored by Napoleon's first wife Joséphine de Beauharnais, honeybees (a symbol for Napoleon), laurel branches, laurel wreaths, and Roman eagles. Bellangé's furniture often showcases the dense grain of mahogony, combined with gilded bronze or carved and gilded relief decoration. His highest style court furniture was built of gilded beech and upholstered in silk lampas fabrics in saturated colors, often with a gold <b>jacquard</b> <b>pattern</b> of medallions, eagles, or the arms of the court or family the piece was manufactured for.|$|E
30|$|Genetic {{algorithm}} {{in designing}} carpet plan and woven fabrics was used (Peivandi et al. 2007 a). Also interactive genetic algorithm {{was used for}} optimizing the designation of woven fabrics and similar to former research databases containing preliminary supplies were used for initializing optimization process. In this method two databases were utilized; one is connected to primary patterns and another is related to colors (Peivandi et al. 2007 b). In this paper a software has been constructed to optimize <b>jacquard</b> <b>pattern</b> in weft knitted fabrics based on interactive genetic algorithm.|$|E
50|$|Brocade fabrics {{are mostly}} for {{upholstery}} and draperies. They {{are also used}} for evening and formal clothing, for vestments, {{as well as for}} costumes. The use of precious and semiprecious stones in the adornment of brocades is not common but has been replaced with the use of sequins and beading as decoration. Brocade fabrics are now largely woven on a Jacquard loom that is able to create many complex tapestry-like designs using the jacquard technique. Although many brocade fabrics look like tapestries and are advertised by some fashion promotions as such, they are {{not to be confused with}} true tapestries. Patterns such as brocade, brocatelle, damask and tapestry-like fabrics are known as <b>jacquard</b> <b>patterns.</b>|$|R
50|$|In about 1821, the Jacquard {{mechanism}} {{began to}} br attached to looms. By means of punched cards, the <b>Jacquard</b> head allowed <b>patterns</b> of great complexity to be woven. In the twentieth century, Macclesfield Silk Pictures became famous, these were woven on these looms by {{firms such as}} the BWA (Brocklehurst Whiston Amalgamated). Today they are collectables.|$|R
30|$|Developing fabrics {{with the}} desired texture by {{the means of}} {{knitting}} machines is limited due to the limitation of number of feeders and increase of colors which causes a reduce in production. Since {{it is probable that}} all the patterns in the database are not capable of being produced by <b>jacquard</b> knitting machine, <b>patterns</b> database is modified by a user based on imposing limitations on the number of machine colors and patterns with more colors than machine restriction will be eliminated.|$|R
30|$|A genetic {{algorithm}} {{is a method}} to respond to troubles that are indissoluble by common methods and must be utilized to try and fault method. It is difficult to appraise all of responses if there are many answers. Algorithm genetic can contain a large vast of responses and find {{the best of them}} by receiving feedbacks from problems. Several designs with different colors can be done in weft knitted Jacquard designing system. However, many patterns might not have enough attractiveness and beauty. The choice of interesting and stylish patterns of the huge set of designs according to customer judgment is difficult. An interactive {{genetic algorithm}} that received necessary feedbacks from the user, can be used in design optimization and choosing ideal patterns. In this paper a software has been constructed to optimize <b>jacquard</b> <b>pattern</b> in weft knitted fabrics based on interactive genetic algorithm.|$|E
5000|$|Invented by John Livesey in Nottingham in 1846, lace {{curtain machine}} was {{initially}} {{seen as a}} form of a Leavers machine- a modification of the Circular. The Leavers mesh tends to be hexagonal while the Curtain machine gives a straight mesh. The use of <b>Jacquards</b> for producing <b>patterned</b> lace was well established. At the 1851 Great Exhibition curtains 5 yard cm long by 2 yard cm wide were displayed. The spacious designs required over 12000 Jacquard cards. The curtain Lace industry prospered now the fashion was for large rising sash windows.|$|R

40|$|The wavelet {{transform}} (WT) {{has been developed}} over 20 years and successfully applied in defect detection on plain (unpatterned) fabric. This paper is {{on the use of}} the {{wavelet transform}} to develop an automated visual inspection method for defect detection on patterned fabric. A method called direct thresholding (DT) based on WT detailed subimages has been developed. The golden image subtraction method (GIS) is also introduced. GIS is an efficient and fast method, which can segment out the defective regions on patterned fabric effectively. In this paper, the method of wavelet preprocessed golden image subtraction (WGIS) has been developed for defect detection on patterned fabric or repetitive patterned texture. This paper also presents a comparison of the three methods. It can be concluded that the WGIS method provides the best detection result. The overall detection success rate is 96. 7 % with 30 defect-free images and 30 defective patterned images for one common kind of <b>patterned</b> <b>Jacquard</b> fabric. © 2004 Pattern Recognition Society.
