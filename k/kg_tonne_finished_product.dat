40|$|This {{reference}} document on {{best available techniques}} in the tannery industry reflects an information exchange carried out according to Article 16 (2) of Council Directive 96 / 61 /EC. The document has {{to be seen in}} the light of the preface, which describes the objectives of the document and its use. Scope The scope of the BREF for the tanning industry is based on Section 6. 3 of Annex I of the IPPC Directive 96 / 61 /EC as ‘Plants for tanning hides and skins where the treatment capacity exceeds 12 <b>tonnes</b> of <b>finished</b> <b>products</b> per day’. The types of hides and skins are restricted to those of ovine and bovine origin, because the production capacities for any other type of raw material for the production of leather and furs are far below the threshold value in the Directive. Structure of the industry (Chapter 1) The tannery operation consists of converting the raw hide or skin, a highly putrescible material, into leather, a stable material, which can be used in the manufacture of a wide range of products. The whole process involves a sequence of complex chemical reactions and mechanical processes. Amongst these, tanning is the fundamental stage, which gives leather its stability an...|$|R
40|$|Reducing the {{greenhouse}} gas emissions is essential for sustainable development particularly the carbon dioxide (CO 2). The manufacturing of Portland cement is a highly energy-intensive process requiring about four Giga Joules (4 GJ) of energy per <b>tonne</b> of <b>finished</b> <b>product.</b> The less energy intensive materials being sought are industrial by-products that are easily available, require little or no pyro-processing and have inherent or latent cementitious properties. Reducing the cement content in concrete by 40 %- 60 % contributes to reduce CO 2 emissions. A part of the cement content can be replaced by fly ash and other supplementary materials and high range water reducing admixtures. Use of additive minerals improves pozzolanic reaction, micro-aggregate filling and concrete durability. Long term investigations have confirmed that cements containing slag and condensed silica fume impart better resistance to formation of large pores of cement clay or cement–silica fume paste systems, consequently to {{a decrease in the}} permeability. The present paper brings the past, present and expected future in the field of concrete with additive minerals using less cement. Studies have been performed on the durability of these concretes under different environmental conditions. Parameters like compressive strength, shrinkage, effects of carbonation and acid attacks have been measured...|$|R

The cement industry has been reported (Flower & Sanjayan 2007) responsible for 5 % of global carbondioxide emissions while the construction, operation and maintenance of buildings are estimated to account for 50 % of all energy usage and more than 50 % of all anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions globally (Smith 2005 & Wood 2007). The environmental impacts of building construction may be effectively reduced by application of increased efficiency in structural design, by reducing the required mass of materials to provide comparable structural performance. By establishing a comprehensive understanding of {{the current state of}} the knowledge, the areas can be identified through which improvements are possible. The outcomes of the investigations conducted showed that at present there is no single comprehensive method or approach through which appropriate consideration of sustainability occurs for structural system design.

40|$|In Australia, {{approximately}} 30 million <b>tonnes</b> of <b>finished</b> building <b>products</b> {{are produced}} each year, with over 56 % of this quantity, by mass, being attributed to concrete and a further 6 %, steel, highlighting {{the importance of}} maximising design efficiencies. The cement industry has been reported responsible for 5 % of global carbon dioxide emissions while the construction, operation and maintenance of buildings are estimated to account for 50 % of all energy usage and more than 50 % of all anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions globally. This research determines some environmental advantages achievable through application of alternate concrete slab construction methods for a typical 10 -storey office structure. Structural analysis results indicate a 36. 9 % reduction in concrete volume and 43. 4 % reduction in steel mass in a post tensioned slab structure in comparison with a conventional reinforced slab system. Similar results were observed when comparing reductions in embodied energy and global warming potential. These results highlight the improvements possible by the incorporation of improved sustainable design methods. Griffith Sciences, Griffith School of EngineeringFull Tex...|$|R

Australia produces approximately 30 million <b>tonnes</b> of <b>finished</b> building <b>products</b> each year, with over 56 % of this quantity, by mass, being attributed to concrete and a further 6 %, steel. Globally, 23 trillion kilograms of concrete alone is consumed annually, with growing population driving increasing demands. This study assesses the environmental performance of various concrete slab systems. Historically, the focus of environmental performance in buildings has been Operation Energy (OE) requirements, however Zero Energy Buildings (ZEB) are changing this. Specifically the study investigates the environmental performance of concrete structures varying design parameters and construction techniques to optimise its embodied energy (EE). These structures are designed in accordance with all relevant Australian codes and standards. The various slab systems investigated include: beam & slab, flat slab and flat plates while concurrently considering the use of conventionally reinforced and post-tensioned construction methods. Designs were compared in terms of EE outcomes given fixed design criteria, with results indicating reductions between 23. 7 % and 49. 1 % when utilising post-tensioned construction methods.

This document is published by the European Commission pursuant to Article 13 (6) of the Directive. This BREF for the tanning of hides and skins industry covers the following activities specified in Annex I to Directive 2010 / 75 /EU, namely: -	activities specified in Section 6. 3 : tanning of hides and skins where the treatment capacity exceeds 12 <b>tonnes</b> of <b>finished</b> <b>products</b> per day -	activities specified in Section 6. 11 : independently operated treatment of waste water not covered by Directive 91 / 271 /EEC and discharged by an installation undertaking activities covered under Section 6. 3 above. In particular, this document covers the core processes in the tanning of hides and skins and the associated activities; this includes all or any part of the process starting from a raw hide or skin and ending with leather. Important issues for the implementation of Directive 2010 / 75 /EU in the tanning of hides and skins industry are the reduction of emissions to water; efficient usage of energy and water; minimisation, recovery and recycling of process residues; as well as an effective implementation of environmental and energy management systems. The BREF document contains seven chapters. Chapters 1 and 2 provide general information on the tanning of hides and skins industry and on the industrial processes and techniques used within this sector. Chapter 3 provides data and information concerning the environmental performance of installations in terms of current emissions, consumptions of raw materials, water and energy, generation of waste. Chapter 4 describes the techniques to prevent or reduce the environmental impact of installations in the sector. In Chapter 5 the BAT conclusions, as defined in Article 3 (12) of the Directive, are presented for the tanning of hides and skins industry. Chapter 6 and 7 are dedicated to emerging techniques and concluding remarks and recommendations for future work in the sector, respectively. JRC. J. 5 -Sustainable Production and Consumptio...|$|R
