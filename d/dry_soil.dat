5|$|The puffins are {{energetic}} burrow-engineers and repairers and {{the grassy}} slopes may be undermined by {{a network of}} tunnels. This causes the turf to dry out in summer, vegetation to die and <b>dry</b> <b>soil</b> be whirled away by the wind. Burrows sometimes collapse, and humans may cause this to happen by walking incautiously across nesting slopes. A colony on Grassholm was lost through erosion when there was so little soil left that burrows could not be made. New colonies are very unlikely to start up spontaneously because this gregarious bird will only nest where others are already present. Nevertheless, the Audubon Society had success on Eastern Egg Rock Island in Maine, where, after a gap of ninety years, puffins were reintroduced and started breeding again. By 2011 there were over 120 pairs nesting on the small islet. On the Isle of May {{on the other side}} of the Atlantic, only five pairs of puffins were breeding in 1958 while twenty years later there were 10,000 pairs.|$|E

25|$|The {{configuration}} of root systems serves to structurally support the plant, {{compete with other}} plants and for uptake of nutrients from the soil. Roots grow to specific conditions, which, if changed, can impede a plant's growth.

40|$|The loss of {{infectivity}} of poliovirus in {{moist and}} <b>dried</b> <b>soils</b> {{was a result}} of irreversible damage to the virus particles. The damage included (i) dissociation of viral genomes and capsids and (ii) degradation of viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) in the <b>soil</b> environment. Under <b>drying</b> conditions, capsid components could not be recovered from the soils. Further studies in sterile soils indicated that, under moist conditions, the viral RNA was probably damaged before dissociation from the capsid. However, in sterile, <b>dried</b> <b>soil,</b> RNA genomes were recovered largely intact from the soil. These results suggest that polioviruses are inactivated by different mechanisms in moist and <b>drying</b> <b>soils...</b>|$|R

25|$|Due {{to weather}} conditions, peanuts are usually planted in Spring. The peanut {{comes from a}} yellow flower which bends over and infiltrates the soil after {{blooming}} and wilting, and the peanut starts {{to grow in the}} soil. Peanuts are harvested from late August to October, while the weather is clear. This weather allows for <b>dry</b> <b>soil</b> so that when picked, the soil does not stick to the stems and pods. The peanuts are then removed from vines and transported to a peanut shelling machine for mechanical drying. After cropping, the peanuts are delivered to warehouses for cleaning, where they are stored unshelled in silos.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{shifting}} patterns of temperature and changing oceanic conditions, precipitation patterns {{are expected to}} change in location, frequency and intensity. Larger and more frequent storms are expected when oceans can transfer more energy to the forming storm systems. This may have {{the greatest impact on}} xeric, or arid, ecosystems. It has been shown that soil respiration in arid ecosystems shows dynamic changes within a raining cycle. The rate of respiration in <b>dry</b> <b>soil</b> usually bursts to a very high level after rainfall and then gradually decreases as the soil dries. With an increase in rainfall frequency and intensity over area without previous extensive rainfall, a dramatic increase in soil respiration can be inferred.|$|E
25|$|Yaks mate in the summer, {{typically}} between July and September, {{depending on}} the local environment. For {{the remainder of the}} year, many bulls wander in small bachelor groups away from the large herds, but, as the rut approaches, they become aggressive and regularly fight among each other to establish dominance. In addition to non-violent threat displays, bellowing, and scraping the ground with their horns, bull yaks also compete more directly, repeatedly charging at each other with heads lowered or sparring with their horns. Like bison, but unlike cattle, males wallow in <b>dry</b> <b>soil</b> during the rut, often while scent-marking with urine or dung. Females enter oestrus up to four times a year, and females are receptive only for a few hours in each cycle.|$|E
40|$|A {{determination}} of the sign and magnitude of the soil moisture-precipitation feedback relies either on observations, where synoptic variability is difficult to isolate, or on model simulations, which suffer from biases mainly related to poorly resolved convection. In this study, a large-eddy simulation model with a resolution of 250 m is coupled to a land surface model and several idealized experiments mimicking the full diurnal cycle of convection are performed, starting from different spatially homogeneous soil moisture conditions. The goal is to determine under which conditions <b>drier</b> <b>soils</b> may produce more precipitation than wetter ones. The methodology of previous conceptual studies that have quantified the likelihood of convection to be triggered over wet or <b>dry</b> <b>soils</b> is followed but includes the production of precipitation. Although convection can be triggered earlier over <b>dry</b> <b>soils</b> than over wet soils under certain atmospheric conditions, total precipitation is found to always decrease over <b>dry</b> <b>soils.</b> By splitting the total precipitation into its magnitude and duration component, {{it is found that}} the magnitude strongly correlates with surface latent heat flux, hence implying a wet soil advantage. Because of this strong scaling, changes in precipitation duration caused by differences in convection triggering are not able to overcompensate for the lack of evaporation over <b>dry</b> <b>soils.</b> These results are further validated using two additional atmospheric soundings and a series of perturbed experiments that consider cloud radiative effects, as well as the effect of large-scale forcing, winds, and plants on the soil moisture-precipitation coupling...|$|R

40|$|The {{direction}} and feature of slot opener can produce different amount of <b>dried</b> <b>soil</b> cover on the slot. Four different slot openers, namely of a bubble coulter, a V-shaped slot opener, a VRA-slot opener and a VRB-slot opener {{were tested in}} the rice field which was covered with chopped arable weed. The direction of these four slot openers was set following the direction of travel. Several field trials of all slot openers were carried out to validate their drill performance on sandy loam soil with four different levels of residual density (0, 2, 4, 6 t/ha) and three levels of soil moisture content (31. 67, 46. 34, 49. 07 %). Significant interactions among the major factors were discussed for each slot opener. High amounts of <b>dried</b> <b>soil</b> cover on the slot were discerned {{in the case of}} a VRA-slot opener, especially under lower levels of soil moisture content. Some amount of <b>dried</b> <b>soil</b> cover on the slots was observed for the VRB-slot opener. Generally, <b>dried</b> <b>soil</b> cover on the slot tended to decrease with the increase of residual density after the operation of the bubble coulter and the V-shaped slot opener, due partly to hairpinned residue in their slots...|$|R
25|$|The {{sugarbeet}} root aphid {{is found}} throughout the major sugarbeet growing areas of North America, (in the Nearctic area) and has infested areas in Texas, California, Michigan, and Alberta, Canada; {{it has also been}} introduced in Europe. The aphid has been recorded at only a few sites in Europe, but the data on other species of aphids suggest that they can increase their range of occurrence, often quickly and in an invasive manner. Infestations are usually more severe under <b>dry</b> <b>soil</b> conditions, either due to dry years in dry land conditions in the upper Midwest of the United States, or to using less water in the irrigated areas of the West and Southwest United States. Infestations are usually the most severe during July and late August.|$|E
25|$|Notable {{trees in}} the {{preserve}} include valley oak and blue oak. The valley oak was once common in central California, forming large groves along rivers and streams. In grasslands, they form open savannas along with blue oaks. The valley oak is {{the largest of the}} native California oak trees and can live to be 600 years old. With a vertical root system as deep as 80 feet, it can reach groundwater levels. The blue oak tolerates <b>dry</b> <b>soil</b> and can have a root system 30 feet deep. It has a distinctive blue tint in the green leaf color that can best be seen when compared to another nearby oak of a different type. The blue oak can live to be 400 years old and provides critical winter range for deer and other wildlife.|$|E
25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1644, thirty to forty {{families}} left Stamford, Connecticut, crossed Long Island Sound, landed in Hempstead Harbor and eventually {{made their way to}} the present site of the village of Hempstead where they began their English settlement within Dutch-controlled New Netherland. The settling of Hempstead marked the beginnings of the oldest English settlement in what is now Nassau County. Subsequent trips across the Sound brought more settlers who prepared a fort here for their mutual protection. These original Hempstead settlers were Puritans in search of a place where they could more freely express their particular brand of Protestantism. They established a Presbyterian church that is the oldest continually active Presbyterian congregation in the nation. In 1843, Benjamin F. Thompson wrote and published a history of the village, and an account of contemporary Hempstead Village. Thompson reported that there were 200 dwellings, and 1,400 residents; that the village was connected to New York City by a Turnpike and a railroad; that it had <b>dry</b> <b>soil,</b> excellent water, and pure air; and that it was the principal place of mercantile, and mechanical business, in the county. The village of Hempstead was incorporated on May 6, 1853, becoming the first community in Queens County (Nassau County did not exist as a separate county until 1899) to do so.|$|E

25|$|The {{share is}} {{the cutting edge}} of the {{moldboard}} plow. The share makes the horizontal cut that separates the furrow slice from the soil below and when it is worn it is important to fit a new one. Conventional shares have points that are shaped. This shape, which was developed through years of field experience, penetrates ordinary soil efficiently and stands rough use. The share is shaped so that it pulls itself into the ground. As the share wears away, it becomes blunt and the plough will require more power to pull it through the soil. A plough body with a worn share will not have enough 'suck' to ensure that it penetrates the ground to its full working depth. The tip of the share is pointed downward, causing the plow to run into the ground. This is called “suction or down suck”; it literally sucks the plow into the ground, to a regulated depth. The clearance, also usually referred to as “suction or down suck”, varies with different makes and types of plows (the related clearance at the side is called “land suck”). Its configuration is related to soil type, particularly in the down suction, or concavity, of its lower surface. Generally, three degrees of clearance or down suction are recognized: regular for light soil, deep for ordinary <b>dry</b> <b>soil,</b> and double-deep for clay and gravelly soils. In addition, the share has horizontal suction, which is related to the amount its point is bent out of line with the landside. Down suction causes the plow to penetrate to proper depth when pulled forward, while horizontal suction causes the plow to create the desired width of furrow. The share is a plane part with trapezoidal shape. It cuts the soil horizontally and lifts it. Common types are regular, winged-plane, bar-point, and share with mounted or welded point. The regular share conserves a good cut but is recommended on stone-free soils. The winged-plane share is used on heavy soil with a moderate amount of stones. The bar-point share can be used in extreme conditions (hard and stony soils). The use of the share with mounted point is somewhere between the last two types. Manufacturers have designed shares of various shapes (trapezium, diamond, etc.) with bolted point and wings, often separately renewable. Sometimes the share cutting edge is placed well in advance of the moldboard to reduce the pulverizing action of the soil.|$|E
