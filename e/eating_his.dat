Hay, still in his early 20s, spent time both in barrooms and at cultured get-togethers {{in the homes of}} Washington's elite. The two {{secretaries}} often clashed with Mary Lincoln, who resorted to various stratagems to get the dilapidated White House restored without depleting Lincoln's salary, which had to cover entertainment and other expenses. Despite the secretaries' objections, Mrs. Lincoln was generally the victor and managed to spend almost 70% of her husband's salary in his four years in office.|$|E
5|$|In 1788, Tarrare {{moved to}} Paris {{to work as}} a street performer. He appears to have been {{successful}} in general, but on one occasion the act went wrong and he suffered severe intestinal obstruction. Members of the crowd carried him to the Hôtel-Dieu hospital, where he was treated with powerful laxatives. He made a full recovery and offered to demonstrate his act by <b>eating</b> <b>his</b> surgeon's watch and chain; M.Giraud, the surgeon, was unimpressed by the offer and warned him that if he did so, he would cut Tarrare open to recover the items.|$|E

Before deletion, as seen in example 2.ii), {{the sentence}} would in fact be read as “John will <b>eat</b> <b>his</b> apple, and Sam will <b>eat</b> <b>his</b> apple too.” The clauses will <b>eat</b> <b>his</b> apple and will <b>eat</b> <b>his</b> apple share an identical VP in the sense {{they have the same}} constituent structure, so the second clause can be deleted because it is identical to its antecedent VP.|$|R
50|$|In 1957, an {{illustrated}} children's book, Come To Eat (בואו לאכול), written by Avigdor Hameiri {{and illustrated by}} Mariam Bartov, was published in Hebrew in Israel. It tells the story about Mother Mambo and Father Sambo {{trying to get their}} little boy Bambo to <b>eat</b> <b>his</b> supper. Only after Bambo watches a series of animals only too happy to <b>eat</b> <b>his</b> food does he learn his lesson and come home to <b>eat</b> <b>his</b> supper. The story contains no racist overtones and reads as any number of stories of mildly rambunctious children.|$|R
5|$|Angel {{returns to}} his hotel and finds Epiphany on his doorstep. He invites her into his room, where they have {{aggressive}} sexual intercourse, during which Angel has visions of blood dripping from the ceiling and splashing around the room. He later confronts Krusemark in a gumbo hut, where the latter reveals that he and Margaret {{were the ones who}} helped Favorite leave the hospital. He also explains that Favorite was actually a powerful magician who sold his soul to Satan in exchange for stardom, but then sought to renege on the bargain. In 1943, Favorite kidnapped a young soldier and performed a Satanic ritual on the boy, murdering him and <b>eating</b> <b>his</b> still-beating heart in order to assume his identity and hide from the Devil. Favorite was supposed to drop out and resurface as the soldier he murdered, but was unexpectedly drafted into the war, injured, then sent home with amnesia. Hoping to jar his memory, the Krusemarks took Favorite from the hospital and released him into Times Square, never to be seen again. Angel has a panic attack and runs into the bathroom. He returns to find Krusemark drowned in a cauldron of boiling gumbo.|$|E

Oliver's efforts to bring radical change to the school meals system, chronicled in the series Jamie's School Dinners, challenged the junk-food culture by showing schools they could serve healthy, cost-efficient meals that kids enjoyed <b>eating.</b> <b>His</b> efforts brought the subject of school dinners to the political forefront and changed the types of food served in schools.|$|E
25|$|Once in {{his home}} land, Odysseus {{traveled}} disguised as an old beggar. He was recognised by his dog, Argos, who died in his lap. He then discovered that his wife, Penelope, had been faithful to him during the 20 years he was absent, despite the countless suitors that were <b>eating</b> <b>his</b> food and spending his property. With {{the help of his}} son Telemachus, Athena, and Eumaeus, the swineherd, he killed all of them except Medon, who had been polite to Penelope, and Phemius, a local singer who had only been forced to help the suitors against Penelope. Penelope tested Odysseus and made sure it was him, and he forgave her. The next day the suitors' relatives tried to take revenge on him but they were stopped by Athena.|$|E

25|$|During {{his stay}} in Vienna, Kočić joined the Serbian {{academic}} society Zora (Dawn). It {{was here that}} he met Pavle Lagarić, another aspiring writer. Lagarić recognized Kočić’s literary talents and introduced him to realism, moving {{him away from the}} romanticism of Veselinović. Petar adapted to the new style with ease, publishing his first collection of short stories, S planine i ispod planine (From the Mountain and Below the Mountain) in 1902. Kočić first read the drafts of his stories to members of Zora, took note of their comments and concerns, and made changes accordingly. Between 1902 and 1905, Kočić published three volumes of short stories, all under the same title, S planine i ispod planine. Notable among these was Jazavac pred sudom (The Badger on Trial), in which a farmer attempts to sue a badger for <b>eating</b> <b>his</b> crops.|$|E
25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1753, Paul Marin de la Malgue was given command of a 2,000-man force of Troupes de la Marine and Indians. His orders were to protect the King's land in the Ohio Valley from the British. Marin {{followed}} the route that Céloron had mapped out four years earlier. Céloron, however, had limited the record of French claims to the burial of lead plates, whereas Marin constructed and garrisoned forts. He first constructed Fort Presque Isle on Lake Erie's south shore near Erie, Pennsylvania, {{and he had a}} road built to the headwaters of LeBoeuf Creek. He then constructed a second fort at Fort Le Boeuf in Waterford, Pennsylvania), designed to guard the headwaters of LeBoeuf Creek. As he moved south, he drove off or captured British traders, alarming both the British and the Iroquois. Tanaghrisson was a chief of the Mingo Indians, who were remnants of Iroquois and other tribes who had been driven west by colonial expansion. He intensely disliked the French whom he accused of killing and <b>eating</b> <b>his</b> father. He traveled to Fort Le Boeuf and threatened the French with military action, which Marin contemptuously dismissed.|$|E
500|$|Chaplin felt The Gold Rush was {{the best}} film he had made to that point. It opened in August 1925 {{and became one of}} the highest-grossing films of the silent era with a profit of $5 million. The comedy {{contains}} some of Chaplin's most famous sequences, such as the Tramp <b>eating</b> <b>his</b> shoe and the [...] "Dance of the Rolls". Macnab has called it [...] "the quintessential Chaplin film". Chaplin stated, [...] "This is the picture that I want to be remembered by" [...] {{at the time of the}} film's release.|$|E

When his headquarters came under shell fire for the first time, Berryman sat calmly <b>eating</b> <b>his</b> breakfast [...] "among the flying brick dust and bursting shells", simply telling the men to shut the door, [...] "so they can eat breakfast without being covered in dust".|$|E

Meanwhile, Cartman is taken to the Ginger lair to meet Scott Tenorman, the Head Ginger. Depicted as a melodramatic madman, Scott has decorated his lair to represent the Chili Con-Carnival in which Cartman gained his revenge on Scott by tricking him into <b>eating</b> <b>his</b> own parents. He reveals to Cartman that they shared the same father, former Denver Broncos player Jack Tenorman, meaning that by his act of revenge against Scott, Cartman had killed his own father and fed him to his half-brother.|$|E
500|$|As a man, Richardson {{was on the}} {{one hand}} deeply private and on the other flamboyantly unconventional. Frank Muir said of him, [...] "It's the Ralphdom of Ralph that one has to cling to; he wasn't really quite like other people." [...] In Coveney's phrase, [...] "His oddness was ever startling and never {{hardened}} into mere eccentricity." [...] Richardson would introduce colleagues to his ferrets by name, ride at high speed on his powerful motor-bike in his seventies, have a parrot flying round his study <b>eating</b> <b>his</b> pencils, or take a pet mouse out for a stroll, but behind such unorthodox behaviour there was a closely guarded self who remained an enigma to even his closest colleagues. Tynan wrote in The New Yorker that Richardson [...] "made me feel that I have known this man all my life and that I have never met anyone who more adroitly buttonholed me while keeping me firmly at arm's length." ...|$|E

500|$|Suggestions of cannibalism—that Mawson {{may have}} eaten Mertz after his death—surfaced during Mawson's lecture {{tour of the}} United States {{following}} the expedition. Several reports in American newspapers quoted Mawson as saying he considered eating Mertz, but these claims were denied by Mawson, who labelled them [...] "outrageous" [...] and an [...] "invention". Mawson's biographers believe the suggestion of cannibalism is probably wrong; Beau Riffenburgh notes that Mawson nursed Mertz for days, even at the possible risk to his own life. Moreover, he notes, Mawson {{had no way of}} knowing why Mertz died; <b>eating</b> <b>his</b> flesh could possibly have been very dangerous. These sentiments are echoed by Philip Ayres, who also notes that with Mertz's death Mawson had sufficient rations without having to resort to cannibalism. Law, who knew Mawson well, believed [...] "He was a man of very solid, conservative morals. It would have been impossible for him to have considered it." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1955, limited {{integration}} came to heavily segregated Las Vegas {{when the}} Sands first allowed Nat King Cole {{to stay at}} the hotel and perform. Sinatra noticed that he never saw Cole in the dining room, always <b>eating</b> <b>his</b> meals in solitude in his dressing room. When he asked his valet George to find out why, he learned that [...] "Coloreds aren't allowed in the dining room at the Sands". Sinatra subsequently saw to it that if blacks were not permitted to eat their meals in the dining room with everybody else he would see to it that all of the waiters and waitresses were fired, and invited Cole to dine with him the following evening. Cole was allowed permission into the casino, as was another black performer, Harry Belafonte, who took a more aggressive approach by walking into the casino on his own accord and sitting at a blackjack table, which was not challenged by the bosses. Belafonte became the [...] "first black man to play cards on the Las Vegas Strip".|$|E
500|$|Early {{the next}} morning, Nick fills a jar with 50 dew-heavy {{grasshoppers}} found under a log he names a [...] "grasshopper lodging-house", eats breakfast, drinks sweetened coffee {{and makes a}} sliced onion sandwich. After checking and assembling his fly fishing rod and tying on damp leader line, {{he walks to the}} river with a net hanging from his belt, a sack over his shoulder and the jar of grasshoppers dangling around his neck. Wading in the water, he fishes the shallows; he lands a trout that [...] "was mottled with clear, water-over-gravel color" [...] that he releases. Moving into a pool of deeper water, he hooks a large trout, [...] "as broad as a salmon", which he loses. After a rest, he moves away from the pool to the more shallow center of the river and catches two trout that he stows in his sack. Sitting on a log, smoking a cigarette and <b>eating</b> <b>his</b> onion sandwich, he thinks about fishing the deep water of the swamp, but decides to wait for another day. At the log in the river, he kills, guts and cleans the two trout before returning to camp.|$|E

500|$|... "We {{believe that}} Christ is truly {{present in the}} Lord’s Supper; yea, {{we believe that there}} is no communion without the {{presence}} of Christ. This is the proof: 'Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them' (Matt. 18:20). How much more is he present where the whole congregation is assembled to his honor! But that his body is literally eaten is far from the truth and the nature of faith. It is contrary to the truth, because he himself says: 'I am no more in the world' (John 17:11), and 'The flesh profiteth nothing' (John 6:63), that is to eat, as the Jews then believed and the Papists still believe. It is contrary to the nature of faith (I mean the holy and true faith), because faith embraces love, fear of God, and reverence, which abhor such carnal and gross eating, as much as any one would shrink from <b>eating</b> <b>his</b> beloved son.… We believe that the true body of Christ is eaten in the communion in a sacramental and spiritual manner by the religious, believing, and pious heart (as also St. Chrysostom taught). And this is in brief the substance of what we maintain in this controversy, and what not we, but the truth itself teaches." ...|$|E

[...] Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad thought that [...] " [...] Schwimmer was good as Greenzo" [...] and that [...] "the subplots were some of the most bizarre this season." [...] Robert Canning of IGN thought that the [...] "cameo from Al Gore {{at the end of the}} show added little to the episode. It was a fine bit, but it wasn't helped by the fact that nearly the entire scene had already aired in the promos leading up to the episode" [...] and that [...] "seeing [...] desperately take on the role of Greenzo and then get carried away with the whole concept could have been hysterically self-referential [...] Instead we got Jerrod as Greenzo and the whole thing just felt flat and forced." [...] Canning rated the episode [...] "8 out of 10" [...] Pittsburgh Post-Gazettes Rob Owen also felt that Al Gore's appearance had been [...] "already given away in [...] promos". He praised the episode's dialogue, saying that Baldwin's line, [...] "you could put on a silly hat and tell the kids how outsourcing means cheaper toys for Christmas" [...] was the sort of dialogue that [...] "makes 30 Rock rock. Hard." [...] Jeff Labrecque of Entertainment Weekly wrote that this episode [...] "was one of the best of season 2" [...] and that [...] "Schwimmer's performance reminded [...] of his most bizarre episodes as Friends Ross Geller, like 'The One With Ross's Sandwich'."
