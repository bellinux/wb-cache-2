5|$|Another {{difference}} is {{the manner in which}} random battles are encountered. Like other Final Fantasy games, random battles occur on the world map. However, in Final Fantasy Tactics, random battles only occur in pre-set locations, marked in green on the world map. Passing over one of these spots may result in a random encounter. Another major aspect of battles is magical attacks. Certain magical attacks cause area of effect damage, and many of the more powerful magical attacks require several turns of charging. Hit Points of enemy units are also visible to the player (except in the case of certain bosses), allowing the player to know exactly <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>damage</b> they still have to inflict on a particular unit.|$|E
5|$|Perfect Dark Zero is a first-person shooter where players {{control the}} player {{character}} mostly from a first-person perspective. The combat features mechanics {{such as an}} evasive dodge roll and a cover {{system in which the}} gameplay switches to a third-person perspective, allowing the player to strategically aim without taking damage and be more aware of the surroundings. Players cannot jump but have the ability to automatically climb obstacles {{as long as they can}} reasonably reach them. It is also possible to climb ladders. By doing so, the camera shifts into a third-person perspective. The player has a certain amount of health which decreases when attacked by enemies. The health can recharge a bit if the player steps out of the line of fire for a few seconds, but it may not necessarily refill completely depending on <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>damage</b> the player took.|$|E

5000|$|Opponents of caps on damages {{argue that}} caps {{on the amount}} of damages jurors can award violate the right to a trial by jury. [...] Because tort law has {{historically}} been a question of state law, states have the power to establish a constitutional right to a trial by jury in civil cases. Historically, juries have decided both the question of liability and the question of <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>damages</b> to award in tort cases, subject to instructions on the law by a judge. Several state appellate courts that have considered the issue have struck down damages caps as a violation of state constitutions.|$|R

25|$|At the {{completion}} of each round, players gain in-game currency based on how long they survived, how many other players they had killed, and <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>damage</b> they dealt to other players. The currency is used to purchase crates which contain cosmetic items for character customization.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} {{to the idea that}} humans may face extinction due to environmental degradation, paleontologist David Jablonsky counters by arguing that humans are a weed species.

40|$|There is {{considerable}} {{debate about the}} role private litigation should play in the enforcement of antitrust law. This article focuses {{on one of the}} most controversial private enforcement mechanisms – damages actions – and assesses whether and <b>how</b> <b>much</b> such actions have contributed to deterring antitrust violations in Japan. It does so by answering two questions: (1) <b>how</b> <b>much</b> have <b>damages</b> actions contributed to the detection of antitrust violations?, and (2) <b>how</b> <b>much</b> have <b>damages</b> actions contributed to an increase in the sanctions for antitrust violations? Based on original data concerning damages actions between 1990 and 2010, the article argues that damages actions have somewhat contributed to deterring certain antitrust violations, bid-rigging in particular, but that an almost equivalent measure of deterrence could have been generated more efficiently by imposing higher penalties through public enforcement. ...|$|R
50|$|The player's car, and the opponents' cars, can {{be damaged}} to zero car {{condition}} points. When that happens, retirement is forced.

25|$|There {{is also a}} {{trade off}} in <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>damage</b> from climate change should be avoided. The {{assumption}} that it is always possible to trade off different outcomes is viewed as problematic by many people (Halsnæs et al., 2007). For example, a trade off might exist between economic growth and damages faced by indigenous cultures.|$|E
25|$|The hazards {{posed by}} a {{capacitor}} are usually determined, foremost, {{by the amount}} of energy stored, which is the cause of things like electrical burns or heart fibrillation. Factors such as voltage and chassis material are of secondary consideration, which are more related to how easily a shock can be initiated rather than <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>damage</b> can occur.|$|E
25|$|Character {{statistics}} {{alter the}} combat system {{by the individual}} qualities of a character. Statistics are split into five categories: Strength, Intelligence, Dexterity, Will, and Luck. Strength, Intelligence, and Dexterity all determine the base attack power of melee, magic, and ranged, respectively. Dexterity also determines damage balance during melee combat. Will affects how your character absorbs strong blows and <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>damage</b> is done to enemies. A character's luck rating may improve the chance of high hits, gathering, and increases the chance of lucky drops.|$|E
50|$|On {{the left}} side of the screen are the Sidebar Powers. These powers {{recharge}} over time, and the amount of time until they are usable again is shown over their picture/button. In the campaign, depending on the his political rating (judged by <b>how</b> <b>much</b> Collateral <b>Damage</b> (see below) he inflicts), the player will get more powers of varying type.|$|R
50|$|Plasmapheresis {{involves}} separating {{blood into}} two parts - blood cells and plasma. The blood plasma components, such as the antibodies, are treated outside of the body. After removal of the disease-associated antibodies, the blood cells and plasma are transfused back into the body. Response to this treatment depends on <b>how</b> <b>much</b> retinal <b>damage</b> has been done. Patients who respond positively show significant visual gains.|$|R
50|$|Strain is a derived {{attribute}} {{based on}} a Racial minimum plus the character's Will that determines <b>how</b> <b>much</b> physical, mental or emotional stress a character can take before collapsing. Wound Points are a derived attribute {{based on a}} Racial minimum plus the character's Brawn that determines <b>how</b> <b>much</b> physical <b>damage</b> a character can take before passing out or slipping into a coma. Soak is the protection granted by the clothing or armor a character is wearing and/or the character's natural toughness.|$|R
25|$|The damage {{model is}} another difference. In the {{standard}} scrolling shooter, touching almost any object {{results in the}} immediate destruction of the player's craft. In Star Fox, the Arwing has {{a certain amount of}} shield energy that represents <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>damage</b> can be absorbed before the destruction of the craft. The game also has a small degree of locational damage detection: if the ship's wings clip against obstacles or the ground too much, they will break off, adversely affecting the craft's handling and removing the ability to upgrade weapons.|$|E
500|$|... 'No-Touch' System - Typically seen {{in games}} such as Dungeons and Dragons and Pathfinder, {{but there are}} also LARPs which utilitze this system, {{statistics}} and damage dealt are determined through the use of cards or dice. The dice are first rolled to see if the attack was successful and is then followed by a second dice role to see <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>damage</b> is dealt.|$|E
500|$|At random {{intervals}} on {{the world}} map and in field mode, and at specific moments in the story, the game will enter the battle screen. This screen places the player characters on one side, the enemies on the other, and employs an [...] "Active Time Battle" [...] (ATB) {{system in which the}} characters exchange moves until one side is defeated. The damage (or healing) dealt by either side is quantified on screen. Characters have many statistics that determine their effectiveness in battle; for example, hit points determine <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>damage</b> they can take from enemies, and magic determines <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>damage</b> they can inflict with spells. Each character on the screen has a time gauge; when a character's gauge is full, the player can input a command for that character. The commands available change as the game progresses, and are dependent on the characters in the player's party and their equipment. Commands may include attacking, casting magic, using items, summoning monsters, and other actions that either damage the enemy or aid the player characters. Final Fantasy VII also features powerful, character-specific commands called Limit Breaks, which can be used only after a special gauge is charged by enemy attacks. After being attacked, characters may be afflicted by one or more abnormal [...] "statuses", such as poison or paralysis. These statuses and their adverse effects can be removed by special items or abilities. When all the enemies are defeated, the battle ends and the player may be rewarded with money, items, and experience points. If the player is defeated, it is game over and the game must be loaded back to the last save point.|$|E
40|$|To {{understand}} the many potential causes and resulting consequences of DNA damage, scientists first need methods to detect it. Canadian scientists X. Chris Le and Michael Weinfeld, {{with help from}} U. S. molecular biologist Steven Leadon, developed a selective, sensitive technique for measuring DNA damage. The scientists combined a thymine glycol antibody with thymine glycol to selectively tag {{a specific type of}} DNA damage. They then added a second antibody with fluorescing properties, and used laser-induced fluorescence to identify the damaged portion of the tagged DNA. The fluorescence can be quantified, with higher levels of fluorescence indicating higher DNA damage. The technique was shown to find 1 damaged base in 1 billion normal bases. This level of sensitivity could allow the measurement of DNA damage resulting from clinical levels of radiation, and may allow scientists to establish a day-to-day baseline for DNA damage. From this baseline, {{it would be possible to}} ascertain the levels of damage that a cell can tolerate, as well as <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>damaged</b> it is capable of repairing on a daily basis...|$|R
40|$|We {{incorporate}} Bayesian learning into a consumption-based asset {{pricing model}} with rare disasters. Agents are uncertain if a negative shock signals {{the onset of}} a disaster or <b>how</b> <b>much</b> long-term <b>damage</b> the disaster will cause and update their beliefs over time. The learning mechanism endogenously generates time-varying uncertainty about future consumption and, in turn, time-varying equity returns. Our model thus accounts for the level and volatility of U. S. equity returns without relying on exogenous variation in disaster risk. Moreover, for our model, we show that anticipated utility pricing implies significantly more volatile equity returns than Bayesian pricing...|$|R

500|$|Historians {{are at odds}} as to <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>damage</b> {{the attempt}} to spread {{smallpox}} at Fort Pitt caused. Historian Francis Jennings concluded that the attempt was [...] "unquestionably successful and effective" [...] and inflicted great damage to the Native Americans. Historian Michael McConnell writes that, [...] "Ironically, British efforts to use pestilence as a weapon {{may not have been}} either necessary or particularly effective", noting that smallpox was already entering the territory by several means, and Native Americans were familiar with the disease and adept at isolating the infected. Historians widely agree that smallpox devastated the Native American population.

500|$|Damage to {{buildings}} and other infrastructure was significant. The most severely affected provinces were Pinar del Río and La Habana. A total of 48,000homes were damaged, 16,000 of them lost their roofs. The province Sancti Spiritus was not affected as severely, as only 945homes were damaged, with 500 losing their roofs. The provinces in Eastern Cuba, including Guantanamo, suffered similar damage. Electricity outages for whole towns lasted weeks {{in parts of}} the western provinces. This led to loss of running water due to unpowered pumps, and deliveries of fresh water had to be made to remote villages.

500|$|Once {{put into}} play from the player's hand, a card {{can be used}} to provide a benefit to the player or to attack the opponent. [...] Types of cards include {{character}}s, such as Onslaught and Namor; each character has an attack and defense rating that represents <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>damage</b> they can inflict and sustain. [...] Other cards include locations and equipment, which {{can be used to}} boost the statistics and abilities of characters, and [...] "plot twists" [...] which encompass a wide range of effects, such as forcing an opponent to forfeit some of the cards in their hand. [...] Each player has a life bar that is depleted with each successful attack by an opponent, and a player loses the match when their life bar is empty.|$|E
50|$|In battle, if {{the player}} clicks {{on one of}} his own units, a bar will appear in the lower right corner. This bar shows all the {{immediate}} stats for the unit, including EI, EV, and EA stats, their armor rating (<b>how</b> <b>much</b> attack power a unit can shrug off before it takes damage), their health rating (<b>how</b> <b>much</b> more <b>damage</b> the unit can take until it dies) and their gas level. Gas is required for vehicle and helicopter units to move- moving one hex drains one point of gas. If a unit runs out of fuel, it can still attack within its range, but it cannot move for a turn or so until it is resupplied. Infantry, obviously, do not require fuel.|$|R
40|$|The author studied <b>how</b> <b>much</b> road <b>damage</b> {{contributes}} to road use costs in Ghana {{and how the}} marginal social costs should be recovered. This required understanding the road deterioration process better and analyzing the implications for vehicle operating costs and road user charges. The most important thing learned is that studies of road-user costs are feasible in reputedly data-poor countries. The author found that {{to bridge the gap}} between road-user costs and charges, the annual fee for heavy trucks should be raised tenfold. Fuel taxes alone are not adequate to distinguish fully the large difference in road damage costs incurred by heavy trucks and private cars. The taxing instrument most deficient in Ghana is the annual licensing fee. Not only should licensing fees for heavy trucks be ten times higher than they are now, but exemptions from the licensing fee should be canceled and registration rules strictly enforced. Even then, charges on heavy vehicles will not cover costs unless current legal limits of axle loading are obeyed. A more efficient means of reducing the damaging effects of heavy vehicles lies in structuring the annual fees to reflect <b>how</b> <b>much</b> more <b>damaging</b> two-axle heavy vehicles are than multiaxle vehicles. The issue of redistribution of costs and fees is of secondary importance in Ghana because of low fuel consumption, low level of fuel taxes, and the fact that expenditures on fuels are proportionately the same for the poor and the nonpoor.
