40|$|Genes are {{regulated}} because their expression involves a fitness {{cost to the}} organism. The production of proteins by transcription and translation is a well-known cost factor, but the enzymatic activity of the proteins produced can also reduce fitness, depending on the internal state and {{the environment of the}} cell. Here, we map the fitness costs of a key metabolic network, the lactose utilization pathway in Escherichia coli. We measure the growth of several regulatory lac operon mutants in different environments inducing expression of the lac genes. We find a strikingly nonlinear fitness landscape, which depends on the production rate and on the activity rate of the lac proteins. A simple fitness model of the lac pathway, based on elementary biophysical processes, predicts the growth rate of all observed strains. The nonlinearity of fitness is explained by a feedback loop: production and activity of the lac proteins reduce growth, but growth also affects the density of these molecules. This nonlinearity has important consequences for molecular function and evolution. It generates a cliff in the fitness landscape, beyond which populations cannot maintain growth. In viable populations, there is an <b>expression</b> <b>barrier</b> of the lac genes, which cannot be exceeded in any stationary growth process. Furthermore, the nonlinearity determines how the fitness of operon mutants depends on the inducer environment. We argue that fitness nonlinearities, expression barriers, and gene-environment interactions are generic features of fitness landscapes for metabolic pathways, and we discuss their implications for the evolution of regulation...|$|E
40|$|The {{molecular}} basis for airway epithelial fragility in asthma has remained unclear. We investigated whether {{the loss of}} caveolin- 1, the major component of caveolae and a known stabilizer of adherens junctions, contributes to epithelial barrier dysfunction in asthma. We studied the expression of caveolin- 1 and adhesion molecules E-cadherin and beta-catenin in airway sections, and we cultured bronchial epithelial cells from patients with asthma and from healthy control subjects. To determine the functional role of caveolin- 1, we investigated the effects of caveolin- 1 up-regulation and down-regulation on E-cadherin <b>expression,</b> <b>barrier</b> function, and proallergic activity in the human bronchial epithelial cell lines 16 HBE and BEAS- 2 B. The membrane expression of caveolin- 1 was significantly lower in airway epithelia from patients with asthma than from subjects without asthma, and this lower expression was maintained in vitro upon air-liquid interface and submerged culturing. Importantly, reduced caveolin- 1 expression {{was accompanied by a}} loss of junctional E-cadherin and beta-catenin expression, disrupted epithelial barrier function, and increased levels of the proallergic cytokine thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP). Furthermore, E-cadherin redistribution upon exposure to epidermal growth factor or house dust mite was paralleled by the internalization of caveolin- 1 in 16 HBE cells. These effects appear to be causally related, because the short, interfering RNA down-regulation of caveolin- 1 resulted in the delocalization of E-cadherin and barrier dysfunction in 16 HBE cells. Moreover, caveolin- 1 overexpression improved barrier function and reduced TSLP expression in BEAS- 2 B cells. Together, our data demonstrate a crucial role for caveolin- 1 in epithelial cell-cell adhesion, with important consequences for epithelial barrier function and the promotion of Th 2 responses in asthma. ...|$|E
40|$|Tanzania’s natural {{resources}} are rich and diverse. Yet, the extractive industries, that work to remove these resources, are riddled with corruption, non-transparency, and limited accountability and governance. This thesis works to examine restrictions {{of the freedom}} of expression on civil society organizations and the media in Tanzania, and its impact on their organizational and individual capabilities to act as ‘watch-dogs’ in the mining, oil, and gas industries. In order to accomplish this, this thesis seeks to present both legal as well as structural <b>expression</b> <b>barriers</b> that exist within Tanzania for civil society organizations and the media based on international and regional freedom of expression laws and standards. The impact and implications of these barriers on governance in the extractive industries have been presented through a comparison of these restrictions to Goran Hyden’s good governance indicators. This thesis finds that the influence and strength of civil society organizations and the media are severely limited in Tanzania, in general, as well as within the state’s extractive industries. The status quo for civil society organizations and media capabilities prevents them from having enough ‘bite’ to adequately hold the government and non-state bodies accountable within the country. This has led, in part, to the ranking of Tanzania’s governance in the extractive industries to be considered weak internationally. In order to improve {{the current state of the}} mining, oil, and gas industries in Tanzania, policy recommendations have been provided to increase the level of good governance in the extractive industries, the capabilities of civil society organization and media, and the protection {{of the freedom of}} expression...|$|R
40|$|UV {{damage to}} the skin leads {{to the release of}} noncoding RNA (ncRNA) from {{necrotic}} keratinocytes that activates Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR 3). This release of ncRNA triggers inflammation in the skin following UV damage. Recently, TLR 3 activation was also shown to aid wound repair and increase the expression of genes associated with permeability barrier repair. Here, we sought to test whether skin barrier repair after UVB damage is dependent on the activation of TLR 3. We observed that multiple ncRNAs induced <b>expression</b> of skin <b>barrier</b> repair genes, that the TLR 3 ligand Poly (I:C) also induced expression and function of tight junctions, and that the ncRNA U 1 acts in a TLR 3 -dependent manner to induce <b>expression</b> of skin <b>barrier</b> repair genes.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The role of {{epidermal}} barrier {{genes in}} the pathogenesis of atopic skin inflammation has recently been highlighted. Cytokines that are abundant in the skin during inflammation {{have been shown to}} exert various effects on the <b>expression</b> of <b>barrier</b> genes, although the role of histamine in this area of skin biology is not yet fully understood. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of stimulation with histamine on keratinocytes by analysis of the pathways involved in epidermal barrier integrity. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed a gene expression analysis of histamine-stimulated keratinocytes. Functional changes were tested using the dye penetration assay. Differential changes in filaggrin and the filaggrin-processing enzyme bleomycin hydrolase (BLMH) were validated at the protein level, and expression was also assessed in filaggrin knock-down keratinocytes. RESULTS: Histamine altered <b>expression</b> of multiple <b>barrier</b> genes. <b>Expression</b> of filaggrin was downregulated, as was that of other markers, thus suggesting the presence of delayed/aberrant keratinocyte differentiation. Expression of genes involved in cellular adhesiveness and genes of protease expression was dysregulated, but expression of protease inhibitors was increased. BLMH was upregulated in keratinocytes subjected to histamine and filaggrin knockdown. CONCLUSIONS: Histamine exerts a dual effect on epidermal barrier genes; it suppresses keratinocyte differentiation and dysregulates genes of cellular adhesiveness, although it induces genes contributing to stratum corneum function. Upregulation of BLMH and protease inhibitors could support maintenance of the permeability barrier by enhanced generation of moisturizing compounds and suppressed desquamation. In contrast, in the case of stratum corneum damage, histamine could enhance transcutaneous sensitization...|$|R

Thirty freshly weaned male piglets were assigned randomly to five dietary treatment groups with six piglets per group. Accordingly, five synthetic diets including a basal control diet without fiber components (CON), wheat bran diet (10 % wheat bran, WB), arabinoxylan diet (AX), cellulose diet (CEL) and combined diet of arabinoxylan and cellulose (CB) were studied. The piglets were fed ad libitum for 30  d. Lower Escherichia coli (E. coli) populations in WB group and higher probiotic (Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium) populations in groups fed diets containing arabinoxylan (WB, AX and CB) were observed and compared with CON group. Compared with CON group, the gene expressions of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), calcium-activated chloride channel regulator 1 (CLCA 1) and voltage-gated chloride channel 2 (CIC 2) were suppressed in the WB group. And wheat bran down-regulated gene expression of pro-inflammation (TNF-α, IL- 1 β, IL- 6) and TLRs/MyD 88 /NF-κB pathway compared with CON group. In conclusion, wheat bran and its main polysaccharides could change intestinal microflora and down-regulate the gene <b>expression</b> of intestinal <b>barrier</b> function relevant proteins in the distal small intestinal mucosa. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Malaria {{remains one}} of the {{greatest}} public health challenges worldwide, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. The clinical outcome of individuals infected with Plasmodium falciparum parasites depends on many factors including host systemic inflammatory responses, parasite sequestration in tissues and vascular dysfunction. Production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines promotes endothelial activation as well as recruitment and infiltration of inflammatory cells, which in turn triggers further endothelial cell activation and parasite sequestration. Inflammatory responses are triggered in part by bioactive parasite products such as hemozoin and infected red blood cell-derived extracellular vesicles (iRBC-derived EVs). Here we demonstrate that such EVs contain functional miRNA-Argonaute 2 complexes that are derived from the host RBC. Moreover, we show that EVs are efficiently internalized by endothelial cells, where the miRNA-Argonaute 2 complexes modulate target gene <b>expression</b> and <b>barrier</b> properties. Altogether, these findings provide a mechanistic link between EVs and vascular dysfunction during malaria infection...|$|R

Platelet-derived growth factor-A (PDGF-A) is normally produced by retinal ganglion cells and is involved in astrocyte recruitment and proliferation. We used gain-of-function transgenic mice that express PDGF-A in photoreceptors to explore the roles of PDGF-A and astrocytes in the retina. Transgene-positive mice developed glial infiltration of the inner retina and had significantly less oxygen-induced retinal vascular closure and no neovascularization compared with littermate controls, which had prominent vascular closure and neovascularization. The increased survival of endothelial cells in transgenic mice in the face of oxygen-induced down-regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor was accompanied by an increase in astrocyte-derived fibroblast growth factor- 2. Therefore, PDGF-A increases retinal astrocytes, which promote the survival of endothelial cells as well as their <b>expression</b> of <b>barrier</b> characteristics...|$|R

VLDL receptor is expressed at high levels on the endothelial surface, however its biological effect on endothelial cells has not yet been completely elucidated. Here, we investigated molecular effects of SalA on endothelial VLDL <b>expression</b> and <b>barrier</b> dysfunction under conditions of ischemia/reperfusion (IS/RP). Methods: Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) treated with SalA were subjected to IS/RP stimulation. Endothelial permeability, ZO- 1 distribution, actin cytoskeleton reorganization, and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation were examined. The mRNA levels were tested by real-time RT-PCR and the protein levels were determined by immunoblot analysis. Results: Pretreatment of HUVECs with SalA markedly attenuated IS/RP-induced endothelial hyperpermeability, discontinuous ZO- 1 staining, actin stress fiber formation, and intracellular ROS generation. IS/RP activated p 38 MAPK signaling and enhanced VLDL receptor expression, and inactivation of p 38 MAPK abolished increase of VLDL receptor expression. Furthermore, siRNA experiments showed that VLDL receptor was a crucial mediator of endothelial barrier dysfunction and intracellular ROS generation induced by IS/RP. Importantly, SalA effectively suppressed IS/RP-induced activation of p 38 MAPK signaling and increase of VLDL receptor expression. Conclusion: These results for the first time demonstrated that SalA protected against IS/RP-induced endothelial barrier dysfunction through suppression of VLDL receptor expression...|$|R

In the resulting nine-dimensional energy function, six free energy potentials representing the six distinct types of tetragonal variants of perovskite lattice structures are given as quadratic functions of polarization vector and strain tensor.

We asked whether the expression of murine β-defensins (mBDs) - 1, - 3, and - 14 —orthologs of human β-defensins hBD- 1, - 2, and - 3, respectively—is stimulated by mechanically/physicochemically (tape stripping or acetone treatment) or metabolically (essential fatty acid–deficient (EFAD) diet) induced skin barrier dysfunction. Both methods led to a moderate induction of mBD- 1 and mBD- 14 and a pronounced induction of mBD- 3 mRNA. Protein expression of the mBDs was increased as shown by immunohistology and by western blotting. Artificial barrier repair by occlusion significantly reduced the increased expression of mBD- 14 after mechanical injury and of all three mBDs in EFAD mice, supporting an interrelationship between permeability and the antimicrobial <b>barrier.</b> mBD- 3 <b>expression</b> was stimulated in vitro by tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and a neutralizing anti-TNF-α antibody significantly reduced increased mBD- 3 <b>expression</b> after <b>barrier</b> injury in mouse skin, indicating that induction of mBD- 3 expression is mediated by cytokines.

Previously, {{we found that the}} presence of plasmalemma vesicle-associated protein (PLVAP) in retinal capillaries associates with loss of BRB properties and correlates with increased vascular permeability in diabetic macular edema. In this study, we investigated whether absence of PLVAP protects the BRB from VEGF-induced permeability. We used lentiviral-delivered shRNA or siRNA to inhibit PLVAP <b>expression.</b> The <b>barrier</b> properties of in vitro BRB models were assessed by measuring transendothelial electrical resistance, permeability of differently sized tracers, and the presence of endothelial junction complexes. The effect of VEGF on caveolae formation was studied in human retinal explants. BRB loss in vivo was studied in the mouse oxygen-induced retinopathy model. The inhibition of PLVAP expression resulted in decreased VEGF-induced BRB permeability of fluorescent tracers, both in vivo and in vitro. PLVAP inhibition attenuated transendothelial electrical resistance reduction induced by VEGF in BRB models in vitro and significantly increased transendothelial electrical resistance of the nonbarrier human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Furthermore, PLVAP knockdown prevented VEGF-induced caveolae formation in retinal explants but did not rescue VEGF-induced alterations in endothelial junction complexes.

Because attenuated caveolin- 1 levels {{have also been}} correlated with heightened permeability of other endothelia, {{the objective of this}} study was to test the hypothesis that reduced caveolin- 1 expression is causally linked to the action of CCL 2 on BMEC junctional protein <b>expression</b> and <b>barrier</b> integrity. This was achieved using adenovirus to nondestructively deliver caveolin- 1 siRNA (Ad-siCav- 1) to BMEC monolayers, which model the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Treatment with siRNA reduced the caveolin- 1 protein level as well as occludin and ZO- 1. Additionally, occludin exhibited dissociation from the cytoskeletal framework. These changes were attended by comparable alterations in adherens junction (AJ) –associated proteins, VE-cadherin and β-catenin, increased BMEC paracellular permeability, and facilitated the ability of CCL 2 to stimulate monocytic transendothelial migration. Furthermore, treating BMECs with cavtratin, a synthetic cell-permeable peptide encoding the caveolin- 1 scaffolding domain, antagonized effects of both Ad-siCav- 1 and CCL 2.

Understanding the factors that regulate gut barrier maturation may yield insight into strategies to prevent these intestinal diseases. The claudin family of tight junction proteins {{plays an important role}} in regulating epithelial paracellular permeability. Previous reports demonstrate that rodent intestinal barrier function matures during the first 3 weeks of life. We show that murine paracellular permeability markedly decreases during postnatal maturation, with the most significant change occurring between 2 and 3 weeks. Here we report for the first time that commensal bacterial colonization induces intestinal barrier function maturation by promoting claudin 3 expression. Neonatal mice raised on antibiotics or lacking the toll-like receptor adaptor protein MyD 88 exhibit impaired barrier function and decreased claudin 3 expression. Furthermore, enteral administration of either live or heat-killed preparations of the probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG accelerates intestinal barrier maturation and induces claudin 3 expression. However, live Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG increases mortality. Taken together, these results support a vital role for intestinal flora in the maturation of intestinal barrier function.

Here, we show that expression of FHL 2 is induced in mouse bone marrow derived macrophages (BMMs) following stimulation with M 2 cytokines such as IL- 4 and IL- 10. FHL 2 -knockout (FHL 2 -KO) BMMs exhibit a proinflammatory M 1 phenotype after LPS treatment and display a reduced anti-inflammatory M 2 phenotype following IL- 4 treatment. Furthermore, thioglycollate-induced migration of macrophages and B cells is enhanced in FHL 2 -KO mice. To evaluate the importance of FHL 2 in the development of pulmonary granuloma formation, FHL 2 -KO mice were challenged with Schistosoma mansoni eggs.

This study explored the specific roles of NADPH oxidase and associated downstream effectors by using human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) and human astrocytes (HAs), the key components of BBB, alone or in co-cultures to mimic human BBB. Exposure to TNF-α (6 h) impaired BBB integrity as evidenced by marked decreases in transendothelial electrical resistance and concurrent increases in paracellular flux which appeared to subside with time (24 h). Increased barrier dysfunction concurred with increases in endothelial NADPH oxidase activity, O 2 radical dot− production, actin stress fibre formation, MMP- 2 / 9 activities and concomitant decreases in antioxidant (CuZn-SOD and catalase) and tight junction (claudin- 5 and occludin) protein expressions. Conversely, TNF-α did not affect astrocytic MMP activities and antioxidant enzyme expressions. Unlike BBB damage, rates of HBMEC and HA apoptosis increased by time. Suppression of NADPH oxidase by apocynin or diphenyleneiodonium prevented TNF-α-evoked morphological changes and apoptosis, attenuated endothelial MMP activity and helped retain usual tight junction protein <b>expression</b> and <b>barrier</b> function. In conclusion, HBMECs constitute the main source of oxidative stress and basement-membrane degrading endopeptidases in inflammatory conditions associated with excessive release of TNF-α where targeting NADPH oxidase may prove extremely beneficial in maintaining proper barrier activity through prevention of cytoskeletal and tight junction reorganisations...|$|R

In addition, conflicting results between clinical and experimental experience using animal models has arisen, so that the results of molecular studies in animal models need to be revisited in an appropriate in vitro model of the human BBB for more effective treatment strategies. Using the human brain microvascular endothelial cell line hCMEC/D 3, the influence of glucocorticoids on the <b>expression</b> of <b>barrier</b> constituting adherens junction and tight junction transmembrane proteins (VE-cadherin, occludin, claudins) was investigated and compared to other established BBB models.

Our analyses further provide direct evidence that the GC hydrocortisone prevents endothelial barrier breakdown in response to pro-inflammatory stimuli (TNFalpha administration), which could be demonstrated to be partly based on maintenance of occludin levels. Our studies strongly suggest stabilization of BBB function as a mode of GC action on a molecular level in the human brain vasculature...|$|R
40|$|Homothallic {{strains of}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{are able to}} switch from one mating-type to the other as {{frequently}} as every cell division. We have identified a cis-dominant mutation of the MATa locus, designated MATa-inc, that {{can be converted to}} MATα at only about 5 % of the normal efficiency. In homothallic MATa-inc/mata* diploids, the MATa-inc locus switched to MATα in only one of 30 cases, while the mata* locus switched to MATα in all 30 cases. The MATa-inc mutation can be "healed" by a series of switches, first to MATα and then to a normal allele of MATa. These data are consistent with the "cassette" model of Hicks, Strathern and Herskowitz (1977), in which mating conversions involve the transposition of wild-type copies of a or α information from silent genes elsewhere in the genome. The MATa-inc mutation appears to alter a DNA sequence necessary for the replacement of MATa by MATα. The MATa-inc mutation has no other effect on MATa functions. In beterothallic backgrounds, the mutation has no effect on the sensitivity to α-factor, synthesis of a-factor, <b>expression</b> of <b>barrier</b> phenotype or ability to mate or sporulate. ——The MATa-inc allele does, however, exhibit one pleiotropic effect. About 1 % of homothallic MATa-inc cells become completely unable to switch mating type because of mutations at HMa, the locus proposed to carry the silent copy of α information. ——In addition, we have isolated a less efficient allele of the HO gene...|$|R
40|$|The chick Early B-cell Factor- 2 and 3 (cEbf 2 and cEbf 3) {{genes are}} members of EBF family of helix loop helix {{transcription}} factors. The expression, regulation and importance of these genes have been extensively studied in lymphatic, nervous and muscular tissues. Recently, a new role for some members of EBF in bone development has been investigated. However, the expression profile and regulation in the axial skeleton precursor, the somite, {{have yet to be}} elucidated. Therefore, this study was aimed to investigate the expression and regulation of cEbf 2 and cEbf 3 genes in the developing chick embryo somite from HH 4 to HH 28. The spatiotemporal expression study revealed predominant localization of cEbf 2 and cEbf 3 in the lateral sclerotomal domains and later around vertebral cartilage anlagen of the arch and the proximal rib. Subsequently, microsurgeries, ectopic gene expression experiments were performed to analyze which tissues and factors regulate cEbf 2 and cEbf 3 <b>expression.</b> Lateral <b>barriers</b> experiments indicated the necessity for lateral signal(s) in the regulation of cEbf 2 and cEbf 3 genes. Results from tissue manipulations and ectopic gene expression experiments indicate that lateral plate-derived Bmp 4 signals are necessary for the initiation and maintenance of cEbf 2 and cEbf 3 genes in somites. In conclusion, cEbf 2 and cEbf 3 genes are considered as lateral sclerotome markers which their expression is regulated by Bmp 4 signals from the lateral plate mesoderm...|$|R
40|$|Scope: Dietary fibers {{capable of}} modifying gut barrier and {{microbiota}} homeostasis affect {{the progression of}} type 1 diabetes (T 1 D). Here, we aim to compare modulatory effects of inulin-type fructans (ITFs), natural soluble dietary fibers with different degrees of fermentability from chicory root, on T 1 D development in nonobese diabetic mice. Methods and results: Female nonobese diabetic mice were weaned to long-and short-chain ITFs [ITF(l) and ITF(s), 5 %] supplemented diet up to 24 weeks. T 1 D incidence, pancreatic-gut immune responses, gut barrier function, and microbiota composition were analyzed. ITF(l) but not ITF(s) supplementation dampened the incidence of T 1 D. ITF(l) promoted modulatory T-cell responses, as evidenced by increased CD 25 (+) Foxp 3 (+) CD 4 (+) regulatory T cells, decreased IL 17 A(+) CD 4 (+) Th 17 cells, and modulated cytokine production profile in the pancreas, spleen, and colon. Furthermore, ITF(l) suppressed NOD like receptor protein 3 caspase- 1 -p 20 -IL- 1 beta inflammasome in the colon. <b>Expression</b> of <b>barrier</b> reinforcing tight junction proteins occludin and claudin- 2, antimicrobial peptides beta-defensin- 1, and cathelicidin-related antimicrobial peptide as well as short-chain fatty acid production were enhanced by ITF(l). Next-generation sequencing analysis revealed that ITF(l) enhanced Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio to an antidiabetogenic balance and enriched modulatory Ruminococcaceae and Lactobacilli. Conclusion: Our data demonstrate that ITF(l) but not ITF(s) delays the development of T 1 D via modulation of gut-pancreatic immunity, barrier function, and microbiota homeostasis...|$|R

Adeno associated viruses (AAV) have recently been demonstrated as a very promising gene delivery vehicle. But the limited packaging capacity of AAV vectors (4 ̃. 7 kb) hinders their application for diseases involving large genes such as those responsible for Duchenne muscular dystrophy and cystic fibrosis. To overcome this hurdle, the trans-splicing and overlapping dual vector methods were developed to expand the packaging capacity of AAV. It has been demonstrated that certain <b>expression</b> limiting <b>barriers</b> affect transduction from these dual vectors. The trans-splicing method requires an optimal gene splitting site and the overlapping method requires a highly recombinogenic domain {{in the middle of the}} gene for high levels of transduction. To overcome these limitations of dual vectors, we developed a novel transsplicing/ overlapping hybrid vector system that can efficiently reconstitute any large gene. The experimental data demonstrate that the hybrid vector system improves gene expression compared to the traditional dual vectors. The study also demonstrates that the rationally designed transsplicing AAV vectors can be successfully used for body-wide gene delivery. Taken together, this study outlines the considerations to be taken into account for rational design of split gene vectors that would be capable of efficient transgene expression...|$|R
40|$|Publications {{based on}} data from {{perinatal}} health registries reported worse perinatal health outcomes among women of Turkish origin. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the perinatal outcomes of women of German and Turkish origin in Berlin in two time periods and to analyze if the situation among the women of Turkish origin has improved over time. Datasets of all singleton deliveries from Berlin hospitals for the time periods 1993 - 1997 (n = 144, 600) and 2003 - 2007 (n = 147, 559) were used. Incidence rates resp. prevalences of perinatal health outcomes were computed for women of German and a group of immigrant women mostly of Turkish origin stratified for 'parity' and 'having a partner'. Logistic regression models were computed to test for a change in the odds for adverse perinatal outcomes over time. The chances for adverse perinatal outcomes were decreasing in the later time period for most measures. For stillbirth, preterm birth and congenital malformations, no differences between women of Turkish and German origin could be found. Differences exist in the utilization of perinatal health care and in the risk for anemia. Among women of Turkish origin, the chance for being anemic is even higher in 2003 - 2007 compared to 1993 - 1997. The perinatal health measures of women of Turkish origin have improved over time. The lower utilization rates of antenatal health care could be the <b>expression</b> of <b>barriers</b> to access the health care for pregnant women with migration background as offered in Germany. A risk group which needs a special focus by health care providers are women without a partner, irrespective of their origin. ...|$|R

Lett. 30, 3269 (1995) ], we {{reported}} that a macroscopic chaotic determinism emerges in a multistable system: the unidirectional motion of a dissipative particle subject to an apparently symmetric chaotic noise occurs even if the particle is in a spatially symmetric potential. In this paper, we study the global dynamics of a dissipative particle by investigating the barrier crossing probability of the particle between two basins of the multistable potential. We derive analytically an <b>expression</b> of the <b>barrier</b> crossing probability of the particle subject to a chaotic noise generated by a general piecewise linear map. We also show that the obtained analytical barrier crossing probability is applicable to a chaotic noise generated not only by a piecewise linear map with a uniform invariant density but also by a nonpiecewise linear map with non-uniform invariant density. We claim, {{from the viewpoint of}} the noise induced motion in a multistable system, that chaotic noise is a first realization of the effect of dynamical asymmetry of general noise which induces the symmetry breaking dynamics...|$|R
