5|$|On December 17, 2008 Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko {{announced}} a reshuffle {{of the cabinet}} after the forming of a BYuT, OU-PSD and Bloc of Lytvyn coalition following the 2008 Ukrainian political crisis. On March 3, 2010 the Ukrainian Parliament passed a {{motion of no confidence}} in the second Tymoshenko Government. A day before that the coalition <b>had</b> <b>already</b> <b>lost</b> the parliamentary majority. On March 11, 2010 the First Azarov Government was elected.|$|E
5|$|Vijender participated at the 2009 World Amateur Boxing Championships. He {{was beaten}} by Abbos Atoev of Uzbekistan in the semi-final of the 75kg Middleweight category, by 7 points to 3 and was thus awarded the bronze medal. Vijender {{won the first}} round of the bout 1–0, only for Atoev to run rampant in the second, landing five {{unanswered}} blows. The third round was evenly contested with both fighters scoring on a couple of occasions, but Vijender <b>had</b> <b>already</b> <b>lost</b> the match.|$|E

5|$|In October 1940, Marcinkus reached Liverpool, {{and from}} there {{travelled}} on to London. On 24 December of the same year, Marcinkus became a pilot in the Royal Air Force (RAF). To achieve that, he changed some of his personal data; he stated that he was three years younger, otherwise {{he would have been}} too old for service in the RAF. At that time, his homeland Lithuania <b>had</b> <b>already</b> <b>lost</b> its independence, and the Lithuanian air force was rapidly liquidated by its occupiers. Throughout the years, Maricinkus maintained close contacts with the Lithuanian attaché in Britain in order to receive news about Lithuania and his family.|$|E
5|$|In spring 333 BC, Alexander {{crossed the}} Taurus into Cilicia. After {{a long pause}} due to illness, he marched on towards Syria. Though outmanoeuvered by Darius' {{significantly}} larger army, he marched back to Cilicia, where he defeated Darius at Issus. Darius fled the battle, causing his army to collapse, and left behind his wife, his two daughters, his mother Sisygambis, and a fabulous treasure. He offered a peace treaty that included the lands he <b>had</b> <b>already</b> <b>lost,</b> and a ransom of 10,000 talents for his family. Alexander replied that since he was now king of Asia, it was he alone who decided territorial divisions.|$|E
5|$|Montagu {{was created}} Earl of Salisbury on 16 March 1337. This {{was one of}} six comital {{promotions}} Edward III made that day, in preparation for {{what was to become}} the Hundred Years' War. To allow Montagu to support his new status, the king granted him land and rent of a value of 1000 marks a year. The money was provided from the royal stannaries of Cornwall. A contemporary poem tells of a vow made by the earl {{on the eve of the}} warshe would not open one of his eyes while fighting in France. The story is probably a satire; the truth was that Montagu <b>had</b> <b>already</b> <b>lost</b> the use of one of his eyes in a tournament.|$|E

5|$|Odoacer {{advanced}} on Ravenna, {{capturing the}} city and the young emperor. Romulus was compelled to abdicate the throne on 4 September 476. This act has been cited {{as the end of the}} Western Roman Empire, although Romulus' deposition did not cause any significant disruption at the time. Rome <b>had</b> <b>already</b> <b>lost</b> its hegemony over the provinces, Germans dominated the Roman army and Germanic generals like Odoacer had long been the real powers behind the throne. Italy would suffer far greater devastation in the next century when Emperor Justinian I reconquered it.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the Livonian War broke out, the Hanseatic League <b>had</b> <b>already</b> <b>lost</b> its {{monopoly}} on the profitable and prosperous Baltic Sea trade. While still involved and with increasing sales, it now shared the market with European mercenary fleets, most notably from the Dutch Seventeen Provinces and France. The Hanseatic vessels were no match for contemporary warships, and since the league was unable to maintain a large navy because of a declining share of trade, its Livonian members Riga, Reval and trading partner Narva were left without suitable protection. The Danish navy, the most powerful in the Baltic Sea, controlled {{the entrance to the}} Baltic Sea, collected requisite tolls, and held the strategically important Baltic Sea islands of Bornholm and Gotland.|$|E
5|$|Seeing all this, Captain Pierre-Jean Daniel André, {{the head}} of the Marash detachment, {{requested}} additional reinforcements but, due to the indecisiveness of his superior, Lt. Colonel Jean Flye-Sainte-Marie, he was ordered to go to Adana to apprise the division commander, Brigadier General Julien Dufieux, of the situation. Dufieux agreed to send extra men under the command of General Quérette to Marash but by 17 January, when the reinforcements arrived, the French <b>had</b> <b>already</b> <b>lost</b> the initiative: supply convoys in Bel Punar and El-Oghlu had come under attack and a relief column led by battalion commander Major Corneloup had been ambushed. On 21 January, General Quérette summoned the Muslim notables of Marash to his headquarters located at a barracks in the north of the city and presented them with evidence pointing to their complicity in the attacks and demanded that they {{put an end to the}} hostilities. As the leaders departed, Turkish police chief Arslan Toğuz drew out his pistol and fired five rounds into the air, signaling the beginning of the uprising.|$|E

25|$|Taurus sales had slumped {{significantly}} in the years prior to its demise, losing significant market share to counterparts from Japan.

25|$|In the {{big picture}} the fight would not mean much - Denmark <b>had</b> <b>already</b> <b>lost</b> the war, and a {{possible}} victory would hardly have altered this.

But yet different causes come from analysing supplementary causes of the Danish defeat.|$|E
25|$|The {{mountain}} batteries <b>had</b> <b>already</b> <b>lost</b> {{their numbers}} two years earlier. Under the 1903 reforms they were renumbered with twenty added {{to their original}} numbers. The army had very little artillery (only 12 batteries of mountain artillery), and Royal Indian Artillery batteries were attached to the divisions. The Indian Army Corps of Engineers was formed by the Group of Madras, Bengal and Bombay Sappers in their respective presidencies.|$|E
25|$|Although Newcastle won {{the game}} and could still become League champions {{depending}} {{on the outcome of}} their next two games and Manchester United's last game, Keegan's rant was interpreted the day after as signalling that Keegan <b>had</b> <b>already</b> <b>lost</b> the psychological 'mind games' with Ferguson.

25|$|The elder Dempster {{continued}} to make decisions that were the ruin of the family. Clan feuding was an expensive activity from which every clan suffered.

He decided now to sell the estate at Muiresk to the Earl of Erroll to prevent his eldest son from ever inheriting it.

25|$|By this point, small {{improvements}} in the B6N's performance were amongst the least of the Japanese Navy's problems.

The vast majority of B6N2 operations therefore took place from land bases and failed to achieve any major successes. The planes were extensively used in the Battle of Okinawa where they were also used for kamikaze missions for the first time.|$|E
