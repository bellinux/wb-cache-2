50|$|With {{the arrival}} of World War I, psychologists praised {{self-confidence}} as greatly decreasing nervous tension, allaying fear, and ridding the battlefield of terror; they argued that soldiers who cultivated a strong and healthy body would also acquire greater self-confidence while fighting. At {{the height of the}} Temperance social reform movement of the 1920s, psychologists associated self-confidence in men with remaining at home and taking care of the family when they were not working. During the Great Depression, Philip Eisenberg and Paul Lazerfeld noted how a sudden negative change in one’s circumstances, especially a loss of a job, could lead to decreased self-confidence, but more commonly if the <b>jobless</b> <b>person</b> believes the fault of his unemployment is his. They also noted how if individuals do not have a job long enough, they became apathetic and lost all self-confidence.|$|E
50|$|A {{practical}} example illustrates the case. When a <b>jobless</b> <b>person</b> obtains {{a job in}} market production we may assume it is a low productivity job. As a result, average productivity decreases but the real income per capita increases. Furthermore, {{the well-being of the}} society also grows. This example reveals the difficulty to interpret the total productivity change correctly. The combination of volume increase and total productivity decrease leads in this case to the improved performance because we are on the “diminishing returns” area of the production function. If we are on the part of “increasing returns” on the production function, the combination of production volume increase and total productivity increase leads to improved production performance. Unfortunately we do not know in practice on which part of the production function we are. Therefore, a correct interpretation of a performance change is obtained only by measuring the real income change.|$|E

50|$|When full {{employment}} is achieved, if a worker is sacked, she automatically finds her next job soon. In the circumstances, {{she does not}} need to exert her effort in her job, and thus {{full employment}} necessarily motivates a worker to shirk provided that she is happy with loafing on the job. Since shirking makes a firm's productivity decline, the firm needs to offer its workers higher wages to eliminate shirking. Then all firms try to eliminate shirking, which pushes up average wages and decreases employment. Hence nominal wages tend to display downward rigidity. In equilibrium, all firms pay the same wage above market clearing, and unemployment makes job loss costly, and so unemployment serves as a worker-discipline device. A <b>jobless</b> <b>person</b> cannot convince an employer that she works at a wage lower than the equilibrium wage, because the owner worries that shirking occurs after she is hired. As a result, her unemployment becomes involuntary.|$|E

40|$|The article {{analyzes}} {{the effectiveness of}} employment agencies system operating in the Lodz Administrative Province in the years 1990 - 1993. We interpret this system {{as a set of}} activities and measures used by local employment agencies to find jobs for persons seeking them and appropriate employees for enterprises. The system in question is perceived very broadly by us, as it includes activities allowing the unemployed to use directly the offer of available jobs, as well as indirect measures creating an opportunity of finding temporary jobs (intervention and public works, additional places of work) or create a chance for finding a job through training and financial assistance (loans). Our survey was focussed on he effectiveness of indirect measures. It shows that the most effective measures were intervention works and training programmes, as they offered the best opportunities for the unemployed and, moreover, their cost was lower than costs of the remaining forms of assistance. They also created the biggest oportunities for the so-called permanent reactivation of <b>jobless</b> <b>persons.</b> During the analyzed period, we observed a growing activeness of employment agencies on local labour markets. This process means that more and more <b>jobless</b> <b>persons</b> could get jobs owing to the activity of employment agencies. It is our opinion, however, that the effectiveness of employment agencies in the Lodz Province was low, which was due to poor performance of local economic units, financial, personnel and technical problems of employment agencies. Without trying to undermine, to any extent, the importance of above mentioned forms of counteracting unemployment, it should be said that they can play only an auxiliary and supplementary role in eliminating this phenomenon, while the main role will be played by the economic growth strategy for the whole country and for this administrative province.

40|$|The paper {{considers}} covert {{incentives and}} qualifying factors of falling into poverty in two Polish big industrial cities, Łódź and Katowice. The researches on poverty (understood in comparative terms) reached the households {{eligible for the}} welfare temporary subsidies. Analysis of figures covers the ‘officially poor’ ones, viz. households with annual earnings per capita not exceeding the minimum retirement wage, where emerge such disabling factors as single-parenthood, homelessness, {{the need to protect}} maternity, unemployment, etc. Among the causes of growing impoverishment of Polish society in recent years, authors suggest the worldwide processes: restructuring the economies, deindustrialization, privatization, along with particular Polish conditions. Further analysis applies, as its theoretical framework, the model of individual’s provisions that include three systems: the state coverage, the market forces and the family. That model suggests variety of settings that could cause falling into poverty. The figures show, that qualifying factors of becoming poor merges into a whole with three systems mentioned and that poverty in the investigated cities correlates with: - family life crumbling and overburdening by the number of children, - the situation in the labor market that restrains the households incomes, - inappropriate provision of social benefits for the families outwards the labor market. The impoverished families in Łódź and Katowice seemed comprehended similarly, yet not alike. In Łódź the poverty almost thoroughly concerned the fraction of so called ‘new poor’ (single mothers, <b>jobless</b> <b>persons,</b> low-paid families with children), while in Katowice, besides the ‘new poor’ emerges the category of ‘traditionally poor’ ones, as disabled persons, chronically diseased, etc. Zadanie pt. „Digitalizacja i udostępnienie w Cyfrowym Repozytorium Uniwersytetu Łódzkiego kolekcji czasopism naukowych wydawanych przez Uniwersytet Łódzki” nr 885 /P-DUN/ 2014 dofinansowane zostało ze środków MNiSW w ramach działalności upowszechniającej naukę...|$|R
40|$|Numerous {{institutions}} {{dealing with}} providing assistance for job seekers could be distinguished in practice. They differ {{with regard to}} goals being accomplished by them and ways of their organization. Some {{of them have a}} character of voluntary associations, others are organs of the state administration, and still others are typical commercial institutions. The analysis in this article is focused on distict employment agencies. This does not mean that only they should act as middlemen between an employer and an employee, and this solve the main problems of the labour market. At the time of growing disproportions between labour demand and supply there is also a demand for other institutions, which could satisfy needs of employers and <b>jobless</b> <b>persons</b> by means of different methods and measures, and which simultaneously could assist general employment agencies. In our opinion, district employment agencies are today the main institution able to provide assistance for the unemployed. That ensues directly from the goal of their activity which is ensuring appropriate jobs for people and employees for work establishments and from functions realized by them, i. e. informative, advisory, correctional, interventional, and welfare functions. The last of them predominantes in all employment agencies and, consequently, it does not allow them to conduct active forms ol job placements. Through accomplishing the welfare function an employment agency becomes an institutions of protective type. The article discusses also solutions adopted in the Western countries in the field of job placement. The Polish employment agencies could benefit from adopting some solutions of these countries. However, adopting such solutions there should be remembered different organizational, technical and personnel conditions of Polish employment agencies, which pose a barrier to the remodelling of such institutions in Poland.

40|$|This paper reviews {{research}} in rural sociology, sociology of regions and communities, and Thai studies which study the transition and reformation of rural-urban relations in Thailand, and then illustrates {{the agenda of}} modern Thai society {{from the perspective of}} social exclusion and inclusion. This concept has been widely used in Europe to integrate socially excluded people such as ethnic minorities, <b>jobless</b> <b>persons,</b> and disabled people into civil society through workfare rather than welfare. Even developing countries have recently begun to use this idea which has displaced the concept of poverty and underdevelopment and focused on inequality and unbalanced industrialization. As a society attains more developed country status with the maturation of democracy and communications media, people tend to feel relative deprivation rather than absolute deprivation and then demand social equity and social inclusion policy from the government through social and political movements. When we apply this social system methodology to Thai society, the relations between rural and urban areas could be considered not as a dichotomy but as a continuum. Migration from rural to urban areas strengthens their politico-economic relations and standardizes the consumerism of the urban lifestyle in rural areas. Moreover, progress in regional development by governments as well as NGOs/NPOs and the influx of foreign labor into the bottom layer of Thai society undermines rural communal and reciprocal human relations where class differentiation in rural areas and lack of social support occurs. Theories of social exclusion and inclusion policy are analytical and normative so that the scope of agenda and degree of responsiveness varies as a function of civil society and citizenship. How can we weigh the agenda of rural-urban relations in social science in Thailand? We should consider geographical space, the multicultural dimension, and mode value of socially excluded people from family and community who are human-trafficked laborers from neighboring countries, abandoned street children from dysfunctional families and child exploitation rings, and distressed people in society’s ultra bottom layer...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} considers {{changes in}} the jobless population between 1964 and 2000, the importance of including them in labor force discussions, and how these persons differ from labor market participants. The jobless are here defined as persons who are not working and not looking for work and include the retired, disabled students, and homemakers. ^ The results of the decomposition and multinomial regression analyses are consistent with other studies that look at {{changes in the}} labor force and report fewer homemakers, more retired persons, and more persons with disabilities. It also shows a convergence in labor force participation, particularly in employment, between males and females. For both males and females, the largest component contribution to changes in the growth rate of the jobless population is participation in non-labor force activities (schooling and exclusive engagement in housework) or existence in particular non-labor force states (retirement and disability) rather than changes in age composition over the period. Declining rates of involvement in these activities reduced overall joblessness for women, while increasing the rate of joblessness for males. ^ Logistic regression analyses reveal differences between the <b>jobless</b> and <b>persons</b> {{in the labor force}} by gender and year. For both males and females, labor force members are significantly more likely to be older and more educated than the jobless with the exception of students. Labor force members also have a greater likelihood of being married and having a child in the household. The one obvious exception is female homemakers who are both more likely to be married and to have at least one child than labor force participants. ^ The retired, disabled, and homemakers report lower household incomes than labor force members. Students, however, report essentially equivalent household incomes to participants, which reflect parental incomes. Labor force participants are less likely than the jobless to receive income from public assistance, but they have higher odds of income receipt from additional sources such as investments. The jobless are no more or less likely to rely on spousal income except for homemakers. Finally, the jobless rely more on public assistance, disability, and retirement benefits than labor force members. ...|$|R
