Since the wind speed is not constant, {{it is important to}} maximize the efficiency of the wind turbine generator over a range of wind speeds to convert as much kinetic energy into electricity as possible. In order to quantify performance, software was used for modeling and simulating of the wind turbine generator system. ^ In this thesis, a dual Direct Current (DC) generator system was compared to a larger single DC generator system to determine which system would provide the maximum efficiency. Both systems were modeled using Simulink. The DC generator models were first verified in the laboratory environment with electric machines from which all of the electrical and mechanical characteristics were known. Having a working electric machine model, two PM (Permanent Magnet) DC electric machines were chosen from the same manufacturer. The first electric machine chosen was used for the <b>dual</b> <b>generator</b> system; it had a power output rating of 430 watts.

40|$|We {{propose a}} Lie-algebraic duality {{approach}} to analyze non-equilibrium evolution of closed dynamical systems and thermodynamics of interacting quantum lattice models (formulated {{in terms of}} Hubbard-Stratonovich dynamical systems). The {{first part of the}} paper utilizes a geometric Hilbert-space-invariant formulation of unitary time-evolution, where a quantum Hamiltonian is viewed as a trajectory in an abstract Lie algebra, while the sought-after evolution operator is a trajectory in a dynamic group, generated by the algebra via exponentiation. The evolution operator is uniquely determined by the time-dependent <b>dual</b> <b>generators</b> that satisfy a system of differential equations, dubbed here dual Schrodinger-Bloch equations, which represent a viable alternative to the conventional Schrodinger formulation. These dual Schrodinger-Bloch equations are derived and analyzed on a number of specific examples. It is shown that deterministic dynamics of a closed classical dynamical system occurs as action of a symmetry group on a classical manifold and is driven by the same <b>dual</b> <b>generators</b> as in the corresponding quantum problem. This represents quantum-to-classical correspondence. In {{the second part of the}} paper, we further extend the Lie algebraic approach to a wide class of interacting many-particle lattice models. A generalized Hubbard-Stratonovich transform is proposed and it is used to show that the thermodynamic partition function of a generic many-body quantum lattice model can be expressed in terms of traces of single-particle evolution operators governed by the dynamic Hubbard-Stratonovich fields. Finally, we derive Hubbard-Stratonovich dynamical systems for the Bose-Hubbard model and a quantum spin model and use the Lie-algebraic approach to obtain new non-perturbative dual descriptions of these theories.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the existence of}} dualMarkov processes and presents the full characterization of Markov processes in Euclidean space equipped with the natural order (the Pareto order). Considering the theory of Siegmund’s duality for real-valued Markov Processes,we have presented an alternative proof to Siegmund [72] using Lebesgue–Stieltjes integration by parts to show {{the existence of a}} Markov dual process in several one dimensional cases, including the real space and closed intervals. Assuming that a dual process exists, we also provided a straightforward method, using duality relation, to compute explicitly the <b>dual</b> <b>generator</b> to a Feller process of the usual Lévy-Khintchine type. We extended Siegmund’s duality to finite dimensional space equipped with the Pareto order. The existence of a dual Markov process on an arbitrary Euclidean space is shown using Fubini's theorem applied to Siegmund's approach. Given a pre-generator of the general Lévy-Khintchine type, we were able to construct a Feller process with an invariant core under some conditions assumed on the pre-generator. Furthermore, we also showed the criterion for the Feller process to have a dual Markov process. We then studied the relationship between intertwining and duality for two processes in the sense of Ef(Xxt,y) = Ef(x,Yyt) for a certain function f. Of most interest are shift-invariant functions (functions which depend on the difference of their arguments). To explore this, we developed a systematic approach to duality using the analysis of the generators of dual Markov processes, then illustrated this approach using various examples. In particular, we gave a full characterization of duality arising from Pareto order in Rd in terms of generators for basic classes of Feller processes. Lastly, we initiate the application of intertwining to the study of duality of Markov processes in domains with a boundary. To circumvent specific difficulties arising from the boundary, we introduce an additional tool of a regularized dual...|$|E

We also define, for each choice of a Coxeter element c in W, a baric structure on K. We use these baric structures to define metrics on the braid group, and we identify these metrics with the word-length metrics in the Birman-Ko-Lee/Bessis <b>dual</b> <b>generators</b> of the associated dual positive monoid B_W. c^∨.
