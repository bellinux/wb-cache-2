5|$|The Regency period saw a {{shift in}} fashion that was largely {{determined}} by George. After political opponents put a tax on wig powder, he abandoned wearing a powdered wig in favour of natural hair. He wore darker colours than had been previously fashionable as they helped to disguise his size, favoured pantaloons and trousers over <b>knee</b> <b>breeches</b> because they were looser, and popularised a high collar with neck cloth because it hid his double chin. His visit to Scotland in 1822 led to the revival, if not the creation, of Scottish tartan dress {{as it is known}} today.|$|E
5|$|Formerly, men {{not wearing}} {{military}} uniform wore <b>knee</b> <b>breeches</b> of an 18th-century design. Women's evening dress included trains and tiaras or feathers {{in their hair}} (or both). The dress code governing formal court uniform and dress has progressively relaxed. After World WarI, when Queen Mary wished to follow fashion by raising her skirts {{a few inches from}} the ground, she requested a lady-in-waiting to shorten her own skirt first to gauge the king's reaction. King GeorgeV was horrified, so the queen kept her hemline unfashionably low. Following their accession in 1936, King GeorgeVI and his consort, Queen Elizabeth, allowed the hemline of daytime skirts to rise. Today, there is no official dress code. Most men invited to Buckingham Palace in the daytime choose to wear service uniform or lounge suits; a minority wear morning coats, and in the evening, depending on the formality of the occasion, black tie or white tie.|$|E
25|$|After Dawes had {{finished}} his term as vice president, {{he served as}} the U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom (i.e., to the Court of St. James's) from 1929 to 1932. Overall, Dawes {{was considered to be}} a very effective U.S. ambassador, as George V's son, the future Edward VIII, would later confirm in his memoirs. Dawes was rather rough-hewn for some of his duties, disliking having to present American débutantes to the King. On his first visit to the royal court, in deference to American public opinion, he refused to wear the customary Court dress, which then included <b>knee</b> <b>breeches.</b> This episode was said to upset the King, who had been prevented by illness from attending the event.|$|E

60|$|Something of {{his dignity}} of {{attitude}} seemed to fall {{away from him}} as he vainly tried to solve this portentous problem. His mouth felt dry and his head hot, {{and he did not}} know on which foot he could stand with the least possible discomfort, and how he could contrive to hide from Madame la Duchesse's piercing eyes that very obvious patch in the right <b>knee</b> of his <b>breeches.</b>|$|R
500|$|Officers in the Armed Forces and the Civil, Foreign, and Colonial Services who did {{not take}} part in the Procession wore uniform, and male civilians: [...] "one of the forms of court dress as laid down in the Lord Chamberlain's Regulations for Dress at Court, or evening dress with <b>knee</b> <b>breeches</b> or trousers, or morning dress, or dark lounge suits".|$|E
500|$|The pre-war Australian Army uniform {{formed the}} basis of that worn by the AIF, which adopted the broad-brimmed slouch hat and rising sun badge. Peak caps were {{initially}} also worn by the infantry, while light horsemen often wore a distinctive emu plume in their slouch hats. A standard khaki [...] was worn by all arms. From 1916 steel helmets and gas masks were issued for use by infantry on the Western Front. A loose-fitting four-pocket service dress jacket was worn, along with baggy <b>knee</b> <b>breeches,</b> puttees, and tan ankle-boots. A heavy woollen greatcoat was worn during cold weather. The uniform was a drab [...] "pea soup" [...] or khaki colour, while all buttons and badges were oxidised to prevent shine. All personnel wore a shoulder title bearing the word [...] "Australia". Rank insignia followed the British Army pattern and were worn on the upper arms (or shoulders for officers). Identical hat and collar badges were worn by all units, which were initially only distinguished by small metal numerals and letters on the shoulder straps (or collars for officers). However, in 1915 a system of Unit Colour Patches was adopted, worn on the upper arm of a soldier's jacket. Wound stripes of gold braid were also authorised to be worn to denote each wound received. Other distinguishing badges included a brass letter [...] "A" [...] which was worn on the colour patch by men and nurses who had served at Gallipoli, blue chevrons representing each year of overseas service, and a red chevron to represent enlistment {{during the first year of}} the war. Uniforms worn by the AFC were similar to those of the rest of the AIF, although some officers wore the double-breasted [...] "maternity jacket" [...] which had been worn at the pre-war Central Flying School. AFC [...] "wings" [...] were worn on the left breast, while an AFC colour patch and standard rising sun badges were also worn.|$|E
2500|$|A Baraita {{taught that}} the priests' {{breeches}} of [...] {{were like the}} <b>knee</b> <b>breeches</b> of horsemen, reaching upwards to the hips and downwards to the thighs. They had laces but had no padding in either back or front (and thus fit loosely).|$|E
25|$|With {{the rising}} {{popularity}} of the longer coat and waistcoat, the large collected rhinegraves and overskirt were abandoned {{in favor of more}} close fitting breeches. By the late 1670s, close fitted breeches were worn with the stockings worn over them and on or above the knee, often being gartered with a garter below the knee. With the long waistcoat and stockings worn over the knee, very little of the breeches could be seen. A possible reason that the stockings were worn over the knee, was to give the impression of longer legs since the waist coat fell very low, just above the <b>knee.</b> The <b>breeches</b> tended to be of the same material as the coat. The stockings varied in color.|$|R

2500|$|George Bryan [...] "Beau" [...] Brummell (7 June 1778 – 30 March 1840) was {{an iconic}} figure in Regency England, the arbiter of men's fashion, {{and a friend}} of the Prince Regent, the future King George IV. He {{established}} the mode of dress for men that rejected overly ornate fashions for one of understated, but perfectly fitted and tailored bespoke garments. [...] This look was based on dark coats, full-length trousers rather than <b>knee</b> <b>breeches</b> and stockings, and above all immaculate shirt linen and an elaborately knotted cravat.|$|E
2500|$|U.S. Representative William G. Whiteley remembered Bennett {{near the}} end of his life as [...] "a tall spare old man wearing <b>knee</b> <b>breeches.</b> He lived in Wilmington in a house...and could be seen any summer {{afternoon}} sitting upon his front pavement engaged in what we boys did not think a very manly employment, knitting yarn stockings." [...] Others noted, [...] "Notwithstanding his Jacksonian Democracy, and being a Quaker to boot, to the end of his life he wore ruffled shirts, white kid breeches, and a velvet coat with brass buttons. He also powdered his hair and wore a queue." ...|$|E
25|$|As an {{alternative}} to trousers, breeches (or knickers in variations of English where this does not refer to underwear) may be worn with informal suits, such as tweed. These are shorter, descending to just below the knees, fastened closely {{at the top of}} the calf by a tab or button cuff. While once common, they are now typically only worn when engaged in traditional outdoor sports, such as shooting or golf. The length and design is closely related to the plus-fours (and plus-sixes etc.) worn for sport, but differ in having no bagginess. They are usually designed to be worn with long socks meeting just below the <b>knee,</b> but riding <b>breeches,</b> worn with long boots such as top boots, are long enough to meet the boot and display no sock.|$|R

In 1866, General Tom Thumb, with his equally short wife Lavinia Warren (Mercy Lavinia Warren Bump), her sister Minnie Warren (Huldah Pierce Warren Bump) and Barnum's other celebrated dwarf Commodore Nutt (George Washington Morrison Nutt) visited Stamford.

5000|$|Until the Regency period, Anglican clergy {{regularly}} {{wore the}} cassock in public, after enjoying {{something of a}} revival in the mid-20th century, this custom is again less common. The traditional Anglican headwear with the cassock was the Canterbury cap, which is now seldom used. Some Anglo-Catholic clergy still wear the biretta. From the mid-eighteenth century, Bishops and archdeacons traditionally wore a shortened version of the cassock, called an apron (which hung just above the <b>knee),</b> along with <b>breeches</b> and gaiters. The gaiters, buttoned up the side, would cover the trouser leg to a point just below the knee. This form of everyday vesture, common up until the 1960s, is now almost extinct. (This was appropriate {{for them in the}} time when some of their travelling would be on horseback but continued {{into the middle of the}} 20th century.) ...|$|R
2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of The Fellowship of the Ring, Merry was dressed in typical Hobbit attire: <b>knee</b> <b>breeches,</b> jacket, waistcoat and cloak. After being waylaid by the barrow-wights, he lost his lighter, summer-weight clothes and was left in a burial shift. He was forced to wear heavier woolen clothing packed on his pony {{the rest of the}} way to Rivendell. Later, he was presented an Elven [...] cloak in Lothlórien, which gave him an ability to blend into natural surroundings. Merry offered his services to Théoden, King of Rohan, and was equipped with mail, a light leather helmet and a small green shield with a white horse emblem. He also received the horn of Rohan from Éowyn.|$|E

In 1774 he came to Henry County, established himself at Belle Monte on Leatherwood Creek, for nine years sat for his district in the general assembly, and in 1793 was made a brigadier general of state militia. [...] He was a brawny, picturesque man, more than six feet tall and the father of 18 children; wore buckled <b>knee</b> <b>breeches</b> and a great beard, braided and thrust inside his shirt." ...|$|E
2500|$|Guitry {{developed}} a charming, witty stage persona, often appearing in period-dress light comedies, for instance his 1925 pastiche Mozart, {{about the young}} Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart {{on a visit to}} Paris. To compose the score he approached André Messager, with whom he had successfully collaborated in 1923 on a show for Printemps, L'amour masqué. Messager was unavailable and recommended the composer Reynaldo Hahn, who accepted the commission. The resulting production took some liberties with historical accuracy, but it proved highly popular. Printemps, in a breeches role, played and sang the young Mozart, with Guitry as the composer's patron, Baron Grimm. Gielgud recalled, [...] "she seemed ravishingly youthful and touching in her powdered wig, black <b>knee</b> <b>breeches</b> and buckled shoes, while Sacha hovered over her with avuncular authority, not attempting to try to sing himself, but contributing a kind of flowing, rhythmic accompaniment with his speeches, delivered in a deep caressing voice." [...] After playing successfully at the Théâtre Edouard VII, the company presented the piece for a three-week season in London in June and July 1926. [...] After the London production, Guitry and Printemps took the piece to Broadway, Boston and Montreal in late 1926 and early 1927. They returned to the US and Canada in 1929.|$|E

2500|$|With {{the end of}} the Thirty Years' War, the fashions of the 1650s {{and early}} 1660s imitated the new {{peaceful}} and more relaxed feeling in Europe. The military boots gave way to shoes, and a mania for baggy breeches, short coats, and hundreds of yards of ribbon set the style. The breeches (see Petticoat breeches) became so baggy that Samuel Pepys wrote in his diary: [...] "And among other things, met with Mr. Townsend, who told of his mistake the other day to put both his legs through one of his <b>Knees</b> of his <b>breeches,</b> and so went all day." [...] (April 1661) The wide breeches that made such an error possible were soon being gathered at the knee: Pepys noted, 19 April 1663 [...] "this day put on my close-kneed coloured suit, which, with new stockings of the colour, with belt, and new gilt-handled sword, is very handsome." [...] This era was also one of great variation and transition.|$|R
60|$|In {{the angle}} against the rock, and {{opposite}} {{to the fire}} which was burning in the other corner, was an open cupboard, that held a plate or two, a mug, {{and the remains of}} some broken meat. Before the fire was a table, with one of its legs fractured, and made of rough boards; these, with a single stool, composed the furniture, if we except a few articles of cooking. A book, that by its size and shape, appeared to be a Bible, was lying on the table, unopened. But it was the occupant of the hut in whom Frances was chiefly interested. This was a man, sitting on the stool, with his head leaning on his hand, in such a manner as to conceal his features, and deeply occupied in examining some open papers. On the table lay a pair of curiously and richly mounted horseman's pistols, and the handle of a sheathed rapier, of exquisite workmanship, protruded from between the legs of the gentleman, one of whose hands carelessly rested on its guard. The tall stature of this unexpected tenant of the hut, and his form, much more athletic than that of either Harvey or her brother, told Frances, without the aid of his dress, that it was neither of those she sought. A close surtout was buttoned high in the throat of the stranger, and parting at his <b>knees,</b> showed <b>breeches</b> of buff, with military boots and spurs. His hair was dressed so as to expose the whole face; and, after the fashion of that day, it was profusely powdered. A round hat was laid on the stones that formed a paved floor to the hut, as if to make room for a large map, which, among the other papers, occupied the table.|$|R

60|$|But as I {{opened the}} door, {{the very first}} thing that my eye rested upon was a long pair of sky-blue legs with hussar boots, and a short pair of black ones with <b>knee</b> <b>breeches</b> and buckles. They both sprang up {{together}} to greet me.|$|E
60|$|All {{three were}} dressed in a curious manner. They wore short jackets of red velvet braided with gold, and <b>knee</b> <b>breeches</b> of sky-blue satin with silver buttons.

6000|$|Over {{the doorway}} were {{the arms of}} Bethune and Baliol, with various other devices, carved in stone. The door itself was studded with iron nails, and formed of black oak; an iron rasp, as it was called, was placed on it, instead of a knocker, {{for the purpose of}} {{summoning}} the attendants. [See Note 3.--Iron Rasp.] He who usually appeared at the summons was a smart lad, in a handsome livery, the son of Mrs. Martha's gardener at Mount Baliol. Now and then a servant girl, nicely but plainly dressed, and fully accoutred with stockings and shoes, would perform this duty; and twice or thrice I remember being admitted by Beauffet himself, whose exterior looked as much like that of a clergyman of rank as the butler of a gentleman's family. He had been valet-de-chambre to the last Sir Richard Bethune Baliol, and was, a person highly trusted by the present lady. A full stand, as it is called in Scotland, of garments of a dark colour, gold buckles in his shoes and at the <b>knees</b> of his <b>breeches,</b> with his hair regularly dressed and powdered, announced him to be a domestic of trust and importance. His mistress used to say of him,-- ...|$|R
60|$|So {{within a}} minute of his {{entering}} our door he had got himself upon terms with all of us, and with so easy and graceful a manner that {{it seemed as if}} he had known us all for years. I had a good look at him now as he stood upon the hearthrug with my mother upon one side and my father on the other. He was a very large man, with noble shoulders, small waist, broad hips, well-turned legs, and the smallest of hands and feet. His face was pale and handsome, with a prominent chin, a jutting nose, and large blue staring eyes, in which a sort of dancing, mischievous light was for ever playing. He wore a deep brown coat with a collar as high as his ears and tails as low as his <b>knees.</b> His black <b>breeches</b> and silk stockings ended in very small pointed shoes, so highly polished that they twinkled with every movement. His vest was of black velvet, open at the top to show an embroidered shirt-front, with a high, smooth, white cravat above it, which kept his neck for ever on the stretch. He stood easily, with one thumb in the arm-pit, and two fingers of the other hand in his vest pocket. It made me proud as I watched him to think that so magnificent a man, with such easy, masterful ways, should be my own blood relation, and I could see from my mother's eyes as they turned towards him that the same thought was in her mind.|$|R
6000|$|Mac-Morlan, in {{conformity}} with Miss Bertram's advice, procured a skilful artist, who, on looking at the Dominie attentively, undertook to make for him two suits of clothes, one black and one raven-grey, and even engaged that they should fit him--as well at least (so the tailor qualified his enterprise) {{as a man of}} such an out-of-the-way build could be fitted by merely human needles and shears. When this fashioner had accomplished his task, and the dresses were brought home, Mac-Morlan, judiciously resolving to accomplish his purpose by degrees, withdrew that evening an important part of his dress, and substituted the new article of raiment in its stead. Perceiving that this passed totally without notice, he next ventured on the waistcoat, and lastly on the coat. When fully metamorphosed, and arrayed {{for the first time in}} his life in a decent dress, they did observe that the Dominie seemed to have some indistinct and embarrassing consciousness that a change had taken place on his outward man. Whenever they observed this dubious expression gather upon his countenance, accompanied with a glance that fixed now upon the sleeve of his coat, now upon the <b>knees</b> of his <b>breeches,</b> where he probably missed some antique patching and darning, which, being executed with blue thread upon a black ground, had somewhat the effect of embroidery, they always took care to turn his attention into some other channel, until his garments, 'by the aid of use, cleaved to their mould.' The only remark he was ever known to make on the subject was, that 'the air of a town like Kippletringan seemed favourable unto wearing apparel, for he thought his coat looked almost as new as the first day he put it on, which was when he went to stand trial for his license as a preacher.' ...|$|R

"If I {{wanted to}} do it," [...] she thought, [...] "I could {{have one of those}} {{carriages}} with prancing horses and a driver in <b>knee</b> <b>breeches,</b> or I could buy that house opposite, with its great front steps, its balconies, and everything in it, but there is nobody on this earth who could tempt me to live there." ...|$|E
60|$|Rupert's <b>knee</b> <b>breeches</b> were {{of white}} satin, and his {{waistcoat}} of thick brocaded silk of a delicate drab ground.

60|$|This {{family lived}} in great style, and their coachman and footman in <b>knee</b> <b>breeches,</b> their {{handsome}} horses with docked tails, the beautiful grounds about their house, a feebly shooting fountain on the front lawn, were a source of anxious disquietude {{in the mind of}} Mrs. Cliff. They were like the skeletons which were brought in at the feasts of the ancients.|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{the cities}} I saw people {{drinking}} a delicious beverage made of chalk and water, but never once saw goats driven through their Broadway or their Pennsylvania Avenue or their Montgomery street and milked {{at the doors}} of the houses. I saw real glass windows in the houses of even the commonest people. Some of the houses are not of stone, nor yet of bricks; I solemnly swear they are made of wood. Houses there will take fire and burn, sometimes--actually burn entirely down, and not leave a single vestige behind. I could state that for a truth, upon my death-bed. And as a proof that the circumstance is not rare, I aver that they have a thing which they call a fire-engine, which vomits forth great streams of water, and is kept always in readiness, by night and by day, to rush to houses that are burning. You would think one engine would be sufficient, but some great cities have a hundred; they keep men hired, and pay them by the month to do nothing but put out fires. For a certain sum of money other men will insure that your house shall not burn down; and if it burns they will pay you for it. There are hundreds and thousands of schools, and any body may go and learn to be wise, like a priest. In that singular country if a rich man dies a sinner, he is damned; he can not buy salvation with money for masses. There is really not much use in being rich, there. Not much use as far as the other world is concerned, but much, very much use, as concerns this; because there, if a man be rich, he is very greatly honored, and can become a legislator, a governor, a general, a senator, no matter how ignorant an ass he is--just as in our beloved Italy the nobles hold all the great places, even though sometimes they are born noble idiots. There, if a man be rich, they give him costly presents, they ask him to feasts, they invite him to drink complicated beverages; but if he be poor and in debt, they require him to do that which they term to 'settle.' The women put on a different dress almost every day; the dress is usually fine, but absurd in shape; the very shape and fashion of it changes twice in a hundred years; and did I but covet to be called an extravagant falsifier, I would say it changed even oftener. Hair does not grow upon the American women's heads; it is made for them by cunning workmen in the shops, and is curled and frizzled into scandalous and ungodly forms. Some persons wear eyes of glass which they see through with facility perhaps, else they would not use them; and in the mouths of some are teeth made by the sacrilegious hand of man. The dress of the men is laughably grotesque. They carry no musket in ordinary life, nor no long-pointed pole; they wear no wide green-lined cloak; they wear no peaked black felt hat, no leathern gaiters reaching to the <b>knee,</b> no goat-skin <b>breeches</b> with the hair side out, no hob-nailed shoes, no prodigious spurs. They wear a conical hat termed a 'nail-keg;' a coat of saddest black; a shirt which shows dirt so easily {{that it has to be}} changed every month, and is very troublesome; things called pantaloons, which are held up by shoulder straps, and on their feet they wear boots which are ridiculous in pattern and can stand no wear. Yet dressed in this fantastic garb, these people laughed at my costume. In that country, books are so common that it is really no curiosity to see one. Newspapers also. They have a great machine which prints such things by thousands every hour.|$|R
60|$|His figure {{interested}} her--the {{figure of}} a boy, almost a street arab. He {{made no attempt to}} conceal it. He always wore a simple loden suit, with <b>knee</b> <b>breeches.</b> His legs were thin, and he made no attempt to disguise the fact: which was of itself remarkable, in a German. And he never ingratiated himself anywhere, not in the slightest, but kept to himself, for all his apparent playfulness.|$|E
