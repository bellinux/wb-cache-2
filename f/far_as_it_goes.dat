25|$|Quaestiones ("") – short verse-by-verse exposition: {{four books}} on the Book of Genesis and two on the Book of Exodus. All six books are {{preserved}} through an Armenian translation, which was published by Jean-Baptiste Aucher in 1826. Comparison with surviving Greek and Latin fragments recommends the translation as literal and accurate so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes,</b> but suggests {{that some of the}} original content is missing. There are thought to be twelve original books, six on Genesis and six on Exodus.|$|E
500|$|Reviewing the {{compilation}} for AllMusic in 2001, Bruce Eder {{described it}} as [...] "a good but routine collection", while three years later Mac Randall wrote in The Rolling Stone Album Guide: [...] "The Best of George Harrison takes half its contents from Beatles albums, {{which is a little}} insulting." [...] In his April 2004 article on Harrison's solo releases, for Blender magazine, Paul Du Noyer said of the compilation: [...] "Hard to fault so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> and a good place to get the fine 1971 single 'Bangla Desh'." ...|$|E
2500|$|Quoting William Placher, Domestication of Transcendence, Louisville, 1996, (p.66) : [...] "In {{the famous}} extra-Calvinisticum, Calvin insisted, against Luther, that {{something}} of God's infinity remained uncaptureable in God's finite self-revelation in Jesus Christ...this does not imply, I think, {{that what we}} know of God is false, but only that, while true as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes,</b> it is necessarily limited to our finite capacities. Calvin's real concern here {{seems to have been}} to preserve the reality of the Incarnation, which appeared to him threatened by a view in which even Christ's humanity took on divine infinity and thereby ceased to be really human."

5000|$|Reacting to {{the confessions}} Armstrong made in an {{interview}} with Oprah Winfrey, broadcast on 17 and 18 January 2013, Walsh said that [...] "the interview was fine in <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>went,</b> but <b>it</b> did not <b>go</b> nearly far enough, and even in <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>went</b> I was particularly disappointed that he didn't admit {{what might be called the}} hospital room admission from 1996". Walsh was also disappointed that Armstrong failed to “name names".|$|R
6000|$|Mirabel gravely {{registered}} the proposal, <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>went.</b> [...] "What {{are we to}} do {{when we get to}} the keeper's lodge?" [...] he inquired.|$|R
60|$|The second line, so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>went,</b> {{overlooked}} the Laramie Trail, which fact was {{proof that the}} old trail-finders had as keen eyes as engineers.|$|R
2500|$|After the {{screening}} of the film at the Cannes Film Festival, Redford received a standing ovation. Writing for The Independent, Geoffrey Macnab said the film was [...] "utterly compelling viewing". Andrew Pulver, writing for The Guardian, said that [...] "Redford delivers {{a tour de force}} performance: holding the screen effortlessly with no acting support whatsoever." [...] Justin Chang of Variety said of Redford's performance that he [...] "holds the viewer’s attention merely by wincing, scowling, troubleshooting and yelling the occasional expletive". Robbie Collin of The Telegraph said, [...] "The film's scope is limited, but as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes,</b> All Is Lost is very good indeed: a neat idea, very nimbly executed." ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{is ironic}} that an {{acclaimed}} biblical novel, one that would rival the Bible in popularity during the Gilded Age, {{was inspired by a}} discussion with a noted agnostic and written by an author who was never a member of any church. Its publication prompted speculation about Wallace’s faith. Wallace claimed that when he began writing Ben-Hur, he was not [...] "in the least influenced by religious sentiment" [...] and [...] "had no convictions about God or Christ", but he was fascinated by the biblical story of the three Magi's journey to find Jesus, king of the Jews. After extensive studies of the Bible and the Holy Land, and well before he had completed the novel, Wallace became a believer in God and Christ. In his autobiography Wallace acknowledged:In the very beginning, before distractions overtake me, I wish to say that I believe absolutely in the Christian conception of God. As <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes,</b> this confession is broad and unqualified, and it ought and would be sufficient were it not that books of mine—Ben-Hur and The Prince of India—have led many persons to speculate concerning my creed ... I am not a member of any church or denomination, nor have I ever been. Not that churches are objectionable to me, but simply because my freedom is enjoyable, and I do not think myself good enough to be a communicant.|$|E

"Mr. Mason," [...] said Round, {{turning to}} that gentleman, and {{altogether}} ignoring Dockwrath and his question; [...] "I {{have to tell}} you that her statement, as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes,</b> fully corroborates your view of the case. As <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes,</b> mind you." ...|$|E
60|$|This {{was good}} news, so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>went,</b> and I asked again if Thomas Halstead {{had also been}} spared, since he, too, was an Englishman.|$|R
6000|$|The merest {{shadow of}} the power to reason--if such a shadow had been left--might have {{convinced}} him {{that that was not}} soldiering; that, <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>went,</b> <b>it</b> was not even sailoring! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This is {{too much}} of a good thing, sir," [...] I whispered angrily. [...] "The brooch was all right enough, so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>went,</b> and he {{deserved}} a lesson; but these other things----" ...|$|R
60|$|It is thus {{better to}} follow Mr. Bruce’s own account, as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 'Indeed,' said Mr Dombey, in his lofty patronage, 'anyone {{might say}} so. As <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes,</b> it {{is a very}} commodious and well-arranged place--quite elegant.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, and as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes,</b> {{it enables}} you to judge of the frame in which the words, even if {{correctly}} reported, were spoken,' added Colonel Mohun.|$|E
6000|$|Greythorpe nodded. [...] "The {{other was}} accurate, so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>went.</b> The fellow played a bold stroke, making the usual excuse; the {{necessity}} for {{putting an end to}} the depredations and barbarities of a native headman." ...|$|R
50|$|The season after, {{the club}} came {{second in the}} league once more, this time to SC Charlottenburg, and earned another shot at the amateur {{championship}} but this time, the FC Bayern Munich II {{in the first round}} was <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>went.</b>|$|R
6000|$|The Indian nodded approvingly. This accorded, <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>went,</b> {{with what}} he had learned from the missionaries of Red River, but his mind was evidently perplexed. He smoked, meditated a {{considerable}} time, and glared at Tony in silence; then said suddenly-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is sound}} reasoning, my dear, as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes.</b> But you must {{remember}} {{that there are many}} poor people in the country and many unhappy people." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is {{all very}} well so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes,</b> but we simply go to these dinners because you are the family lawyer and I am your wife." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's good as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes,</b> Henry, but it isn't quite strong enough," [...] {{returned}} Slugger. [...] "We {{ought to}} do something that will make Colonel Colby hopping mad." ...|$|E
60|$|This {{was rather}} too pointed a {{question}} for Nasmyth to answer, but, so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>went,</b> he could readily have agreed with the skipper. As {{a matter of fact}} it suggested the query why he should object to Miss Hamilton throwing herself away.|$|R
60|$|This was correct, <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>went,</b> but Edmonds {{was quite}} {{aware that the}} gentlemen {{referred}} to usually played a very deep and obscure game. He had also reasons for believing {{that they were doing}} it now. It was, however, evident that Hawtrey's hesitation was vanishing.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, little Son of George," [...] puffed Dingaan, [...] "you {{have lost}} your bet, for you did but kill two {{vultures}} {{out of five}} with your magic, which was good <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>went,</b> but not good enough. Now you must pay, as I would have paid had you won." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You were splendid," [...] Strether returned--"but 'all' isn't a {{good deal}} to say: it's only a little. Yet it's charming so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes.</b> She wants a man to herself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This is curious," [...] {{he remarked}} quietly. [...] "I {{remember}} the queer name--Zebedee. Yes, sir; I did the engraving, as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes.</b> I wonder what prevented me from finishing it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Camp {{seemed to}} have lost his bitter mood, and he answered, pleasantly: [...] "The Declaration is all right, as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes,</b> but it don't help us {{to compete with the}} Western farm operations." ...|$|E
60|$|This was {{satisfactory}} <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>went.</b> The only {{trouble was}} that Austin was very uncertain {{whether he would}} live to spend what he had so hardly earned. His arm had become exceedingly painful during the voyage, and after a consultation with the ship broker he telephoned an eminent specialist.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{did not say}} so. What he told me of you, <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>went,</b> {{is exactly}} {{confirmed}} by what you have said yourself. But I happened {{to ask him to}} what class men of your calling usually belonged; and he said that they were laborers, butchers, and so forth. Do you resent that?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I have," [...] I answered. [...] "And it's {{excellent}} as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes.</b> But, like Mrs. Glasse's jugged hare, it {{all depends}} upon the initial step. 'First catch your criminal.' Now, we have never caught Colonel Clay--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly it is a threat,--as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes.</b> There {{is another}} threat which I {{may have to}} make {{for the sake of}} coercing you; but I do not wish to use it if I can do without it." ...|$|E
60|$|He twisted my face <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> would <b>go</b> {{and then}} {{stood looking at}} it.|$|R
60|$|The prim man {{arrived at}} this point just as the glasses came back, when Mr. Bob Sawyer, who had been absorbed in {{attention}} during the whole time, said he should {{very much like to}} hear the end of <b>it,</b> for, so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>went,</b> <b>it</b> was, without exception, the very best story he had ever heard. The sight of the tumblers restored Bob Sawyer to a degree of equanimity which he had not possessed since his interview with his landlady. His face brightened up, and he began to feel quite convivial.|$|R
