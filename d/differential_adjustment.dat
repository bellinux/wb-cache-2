The author evaluates self-rated welfare and power changes in Timor-Leste covering the period prior to the 1999 referendum on independence from Indonesia to the eve of independence in end 2001. Drawing on the first nationally representative household survey and village census, he shows how subjective, objective, and recall information can be combined to provide a rich profile of trends in well-being from the pre- to post-conflict stage. The author’s analysis shows that changes in self-rated welfare and power broadly corresponded to changes recorded by objective indicators. While economic well-being improved little, empowerment increased dramatically. The changes were not uniform across the population but some groups benefited more than others. The evidence for Timor-Leste is consistent with these hypotheses: a) Economic resources increase welfare, and more than power; b) Social resources increase power, and more than welfare; c) Welfare winners have low initial economic resources; d) Power winners have high social resources; and e) Economic shocks reduce welfare and power, but welfare more than power.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a new {{empirical}} approach to testing the dynamic trade-off theory, allowing for costly and asymmetric capital structure adjustments. We develop a dynamic threshold model of leverage that {{enables us to}} estimate the speed of adjustment in two separate regimes, {{each of which is}} associated with a <b>differential</b> <b>adjustment</b> cost. We examine several variables that proxy for adjustment costs, financial flexibility and financial constraints that affect capital structure adjustments. The results suggest that that firms deviating considerably far away from the target leverage undertake slower adjustment. Low-growth firms adjust leverage significantly more quickly than high-growth firms. Financial constraints, as measured by dividend ratios and investment, have a significantly negative effect on the speed of adjustment.

40|$|We {{investigated}} the cross-over effect of muscle fatigue and its time {{course on the}} non-exercising contralateral limb (NEL) after unilateral fatiguing contractions of the ipsilateral exercising limb (EL). For this purpose, 15 males performed two bouts of 100 -second maximal isometric knee extensions with the exercising limb, and neuromuscular function of both the EL and NEL was assessed before (PRE), after a first fatiguing exercise (MID) and after a second fatiguing exercise (POST). Maximal voluntary isometric torque production declined in the EL after the first bout of exercise (− 9. 6 %; p< 0. 001) while in the NEL, the decrease occurred after the second bout of exercise (− 10. 6 %; p< 0. 001). At MID, torque decline of the EL was strictly associated to an alteration of the mechanical twitch properties evoked by neurostimulation of the femoral nerve (i. e., peak twitch torque, maximal rate of twitch development). According to these markers, we suggest that peripheral fatigue occurred. At POST, after the second bout of exercise, the voluntary activation level of the knee extensor muscles was altered from PRE (− 9. 1 %; p< 0. 001), indicating an overall central failure in both the EL and NEL. These findings indicate that two bouts of unilateral fatiguing exercise were needed to induce a cross-over effect of muscle fatigue on the non-exercising contralateral limb. <b>Differential</b> <b>adjustments</b> of the motor pathway (peripheral fatigue vs. central fatigue) might contribute to the respective torque decline in the EL and the NEL. Given that our unilateral fatiguing exercise induced immediate maximal torque reduction in the EL and postponed the loss of torque production in the NEL, it is also concluded that {{the time course of}} muscle fatigue differed between limbs. © 2013 Doix et al.

In addition to demographic variables, relationship to ex-wife and child, and reasons for becoming single and obtaining custody, several personality variables were included along with measures of adjustment. One year follow-up measures of adjustment were collected to evaluate implications of typologies in adjustment. Two nearly equal groups were established in a Q type factor analysis of continuous data. Factor loadings of individual cases suggest a continuum of {{the two types of}} single fathers, rather than two distinct groups. Group differences were evaluated in a series of MANOVA and Chisquare analyses. Analysis included six factor scores from a supplemental R factor analysis of selected variables. Type I fathers are characterized as older, more passive, selfreflective, and aloof in interpersonal relationships. They are somewhat less oriented toward a relationship with their children and had felt satisfied with their wives* care of them. Alternatively, Type II fathers are younger, active, assured (not self-reflective), and person-oriented. They are more oriented toward relationship with their children and had felt dissatisfied with how their wives had cared for their children.

40|$|The Problem: Recent {{increases}} {{in the number of}} senescents in the general population and concomitant {{increases in}} the number of medical and social problems among this age group (Greenleigh, 1952), have produced an urgent need for empirical study of the correlates of "successful” and "unsuccessful" aging. One explanation that has been offered for the difficulties encountered by older people in modern civilization is that the shift from an agricultural to an urban economy has eliminated the useful roles served by the older people as grandparents in the home while not offering any substitute useful roles (Poliak, 1948). Another explanation that has been offered for many of the difficulties in old age has been that of physical decline. However, recent studies by Rothschild (1945) and by Busse et al. (1954) have indicated that there is far from a one-to-one relationship between physical status, especially with regard to the central nervous system, and level of adjustment. Individuals were seen with gross pathology of the central nervous system who {{did not seem to be}} having any difficulties in leading satisfactory lives. The results of these studies suggested that social and attitudinal variables might have more direct relationships to adjustment level than any but the most marked physical disorders. Unfortunately, psychological studies of old age have been mostly concerned with the developmental aspects of aging and have not devoted much attention to the correlates of <b>differential</b> <b>adjustment</b> among the aged them- selves. Most investigations were restricted to study of the intellectual and psychomotor aspects of aging (Miles, 1942; Jones and Kaplan, 1945; Granick, 1950). Little attention was paid to personality factors until quite recently. However, the need for information regarding the personality characteristics associated with the aging process and especially of those associated with differentially “satisfactory” aging has been recognized and has resulted in an increasing number of broad range studies devoted to investigation of the relationships of specific personality variables to adjustment level in senescence, e. g., interests, self-concept. Many of these studies have involved the use of the Rorschach and de- spite the marked differences in some of the social characteristics of the populations sampled in the Rorschach studies (Klopfer, 1946; Prados and Fried, 1947; Davidson and Kruglov, 1952; Caldwell, 1954), the findings have been very consistent. The conclusions in each study are generally that older people evidence reduced emotional responsiveness, and an increase in stereotyped thinking, and in intellectual inefficiency. A comparison of com- munity and institutionalized aged by Klopfer (1946) revealed little difference in Rorschach characteristics. However, the institutional population in this study came from a home for the aged where individuals with gross physical or mental difficulties were not accepted so that one may wonder whether any differences were to he expected. A major defect of these studies has been that the results have been interpreted generally in terms of comparison with young adult norms and little attempt has been made to explore the relation- ships between specific Rorschach characteristics and behavioral attributes of the aged. The published empirical studies of specific personality characteristics associated with <b>differential</b> <b>adjustment</b> level, using institutionalization or lack of it as the criterion of adjustment, have been devoted almost exclusively to investigation of the affective quality of the self-concept, i. e., positive or negative self-concept. Tuckman, Lorge, Steinhardt and Zeman (1953) found institutionalized aged subjects to report fewer physical and mental symptoms on a health questionnaire than a group of aged subjects living in the community despite the fact that, objectively, the institutional group actually had more symptoms of poor health. The authors explained these findings in terms of the more negative self-concept of the institutionalized aged which allowed them to consider illness in old age as normal and therefore not worthy of mention. … It was in light of these considerations that the current study was undertaken in an attempt to establish a more suitable approach to the measurement of adjustment level, in terms of specific behaviors, rather than as indicated by institutionalization, or the lack of it. The self-concept, as previously noted, has long been regarded as a central psychological variable determining behavior. If certain "adjusted" behaviors can be identified, then we would expect the self-concept to predict these behaviors in a consistent manner in the aged as well as in any other group. In the following pages, we will outline the considerations which determined the specific variables that were selected for study and we will state our problem formally.

It finds that the regional system eventually eliminates disequilibrium unemployment differentials and adjusts to an equilibrium where a region's relative wage compensates for its unemployment differential at the rate 3 : 1 (i. e., 3 percent higher wage for a percentage point higher unemployment). Adjustment is very slow, so regional policy might save several person-years of unemployment by offering incentives for the faster movement of people and jobs.

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Postal Reorganization Act of 1970 requires the Postal Service to pay wages {{comparable to those of}} the private sector. It also requires the Service to provide adequate and reasonable pay differences between clerks and carriers and their supervisors, such as postmasters, although the act does not specify what constitutes adequate and reasonable differences. Furthermore, the act requires the Service to consult with supervisor and postmaster organizations when planning and developing pay policies and other programs affecting their members. Since the mid- 1970 s, two postmaster organizations have voiced concerns that adequate and reasonable pay differences do not exist between postmasters and the clerks and carriers they supervise. Recently, the organizations took their concerns to Congress. The resulting Postmasters' Fairness and Rights Act would make substantive changes in the way postmasters' pay is determined. Most postmasters are now paid under the Service's Executive and Administrative Schedule (EAS), which is the salary schedule that applies to nearly all supervisory and management employees. Generally, postmaster pay consists of basic pay; pay-for-performance; lump-sum merit awards; and supplemental pay, such as overtime. In 1996, the Service lowered the minimum basic pay of the 26 EAS grades. This resulted in the minimum basic pay of EAS- 15 and EAS- 16 supervisors being less than the maximum basic pay of a grade 5 clerk, which was the most populated grade and pay level of the largest bargaining unit. Because of this and the 1970 Act's requirement that an adequate and reasonable pay difference be maintained, the Service established a Supervisory <b>Differential</b> <b>Adjustment</b> (SDA) policy for EAS- 15 and above supervisors who are not eligible to receive overtime pay. This policy provides that these supervisors will be paid no less than five percent more than the maximum basic pay of a grade 5 clerk. GAO's analyses showed that two craft employees earned more in basic pay than did their local postmasters in 1999, and about one-half of one percent of craft employees earned more in gross pay than did their local postmasters. The five organizations that GAO selected to discuss pay practices had pay policies to minimize instances of craft employees earning more than their supervisors. These organizations indicated that craft employees only occasionally earned more than their supervisors. ...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1990 The {{success of}} the U. S. {{government}} in persuading Japan to liberalize the beef market {{is viewed as a}} relief to the U. S. beef industry. The economic benefit (to the U. S. beef producers!) of the trade liberalization however is yet to be seen. The size of this benefit is determined, among others, by (a) the net change in Japan's retail price due to the liberalization, (b) the price elasticity of demand for the U. S. beef in Japan, (c) the degree of price rise in the world market, and (d) the export capacity of the domestic sector. Availability of alternative beef sources and the degree of substitutability between the U. S. beef and those alternatives affect factor (b) and factor (d) depends {{on the extent to which}} beef and other meat products substitute each other in the domestic market both in production and consumption. Evaluation of the U. S. - Japan Beef Market Access Agreement (BMAA) therefore has become a high policy profile. In the interest of assessing possible policy effects of BMAA, several researchers have attempted to parameterize and quantify the Japanese demand for beef. The fact that this market is (a) semi-isolated from the rest of the world by restrictive import quota, (b) managed domestically by government parastatal, and (c) characterized by multi- and intensely differentiated beef with no parallel historical data has made the choice of economic theory and methodology difficult. While most researchers (Group 1) relied on conventional method [e. g. 55; 125], others (Group 2) [2] contend that managed import market may better be explained by a model of political nature. By assuming the usual competitive market behavior, Group 1 underestimates possible implications of existing market structure for building and estimating conventional econometric models. Group 2, on the other hand, limits itself to normative analysis. Due to the absence of consensus among researchers regarding implications of policy-relevant parameters, the desirability of the BMAA is still an unsettled policy issue. The general purpose of this study has been to generate some further information on Japan's beef market. In pursuant of this objective, an attempt is made to (a) show how significant the beef quality issue is in evaluating that market, (b) test the market equilibrium hypothesis, and (c) upon the acceptance of the alternative (disequilibrium) hypothesis, estimate the structural parameters from a model specified in the light of imperfections in the market. This fills the void in previous studies. Drawing on existing literature, the beef quality categories are shown to have been narrowing and, in fact, converging to the two middle categories, medium and common grades. It is suggested that future market studies may benefit from concentrating on these two grades in assessing competitiveness and substitutability with domestic beef. Understanding the nature of this convergence (i. e whether the shift is attributable to changes in cost or preference structure) may contribute to sound policy making. Based on (a) increased concentration in production and distribution sectors, (b) government intervention in beef and related markets, (c) high degree heterogeneity in beef, and (d) short-run supply inflexibility due to long fattening period and restrictive import policy, the Japanese beef market was hypothesized to have been in disequilibria due to incomplete market information. In testing this hypothesis, two data sets were used -Statistical Yearbook and the Family Income and Expenditure Survey. For reference purposes, they are referred to as Market I and Market II respectively. The equilibrium hypothesis was tested for uniform and upward and downward <b>differential</b> <b>adjustment</b> speeds. The uniform adjustment rate estimated from the reduced form price equation supports the hypothesis in both markets. The structural equations were then adjusted in the light of the imperfections in the market and structural parameters estimated using non-linear three stage least squares. Both upward and downward adjustment speeds in Market I suggest perfect flexibility in prices on annual basis. In Market II, prices are found to have been flexible downward but rigid otherwise. The upward rigidity in prices suggest excess demand. Perfect flexibility in prices on annual basis however may not suggest market equilibrium in a period less than a year. Consumers are found to be more price responsive than in previous studies implying a greater response of the demand for beef imports to changes in prices due to the liberalization than envisaged by previous studies. The demand for beef however is income inelastic suggesting a partial offsetting in the incremental demand for imports. Finally, consumers respond to changes in beef retail prices by consuming less fish and poultry...|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} {{dynamics}} of price indices for major U. S. cities using panel econometric methods and find that relative price levels among cities mean revert at an exceptionally slow rate. In a panel of 19 cities from 1918 to 1995, we estimate the half-life of convergence to be approximately nine years. The surprisingly slow rate of convergence {{can be explained by}} a combination of the presence of transportation costs, <b>differential</b> speeds of <b>adjustment</b> to small and large shocks, and the inclusion of nontraded goods prices in the overall price index.

40|$|A new sea-level record {{derived from}} coastal {{deposits}} of the South Vietnam shelf covers the deglacial sea-level history between 13. 0 and 9. 0 ?ka BP. This record reveals a relatively constant rate of sea-level rise and matches well with model results {{based on the}} RSES-ANU global ice-sheet model. However, the sea-level observations reveal a significant discrepancy with model results based on the ICE- 5 G global ice-sheet model, which further questions the existence of Meltwater Pulse 1 B The incised-valley deposits of the South Vietnam shelf also complete the deglacial coastal evolution of southern Vietnam. The regional sea-level records of the South Vietnam shelf, the Mekong Delta and the Cambodian lowlands reveal an offset of about 18 ?m between 9. 0 and 8. 2 ?ka BP. The shoreline retreat of more than 200 ?km related to this offset was mainly caused by the <b>differential</b> hydro-isostatic <b>adjustment</b> between the South Vietnam shelf and the Cambodian lowlands. However, the GIA-model results cannot fully explain this fast relative sea-level rise due to the topographic changes and, possibly, alternative melt-water sources not accounted for in the current models...|$|R
40|$|Implicit in {{standard}} macroeconomics of adjustment {{is the assumption}} of well-integrated labor markets that are responsive to relative prices. But segmentation {{of the labor market}} is usually said to be an important source of labor market rigidities. In particular, if segmentation involves different degrees of real wage rigidity among different groups in the labor force, nominal devaluation may be ineffective and inequitable in its impact. This paper uses a model of labor market segmentation in which regulations are necessary to distinguish between the formal and informal sectors. Using standard econometric techniques to estimate four simultaneous equations, the authors examine the effect of devaluation on relative wages in four countries. They found that formal wages are more responsive than informal wages to inflation and that devaluation of the exchange rate, by increasing the wage gap, is a source of sluggish labor mobility. In addition, they found that expanding wage <b>differentials</b> during <b>adjustment</b> imposes a greater burden on the poorest workers, making adjustment policies less politically sustainable. Finally, they found evidence to support the hypothesis that nominal devaluation would probably be ineffective with a segmented labor market.

40|$|This paper {{integrates}} dynamics on {{the demand}} {{and on the}} supply side, which are characteristic for many goods, in particular fuels, due to costly adjustments. Furthermore, firms often pursue a quantity strategy and decide on output adjustments, additional capacities, etc. instead of fixing prices, e. g., OPEC moved from posting prices to adjusting output in 1986. This paper provides a corresponding framework (surprisingly ignored in the literature) and derives intertemporal market equilibria: cooperative, and noncooperative in open loop and in Markov strategies. The equilibrium in Markov strategies is different, mostly opposite to the much discussed sticky price models, the qualitative properties are non-trivial {{and some of them}} are even surprising, e. g., increased demand sluggishness can raise supply.
