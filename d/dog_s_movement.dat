40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this {{dissertation}} is {{to explain why the}} United States and Canada, two very similar countries, have taken different approaches to family leave policies. These nations are both established democracies with comparable levels of economic development and federal systems of government. As liberal welfare regimes, they typically look to the market for resource distribution, rather than to the government. However, despite these similarities, the two countries have adopted very different family leave policies. Drawing upon the literature of women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movements,</b> the study examines the impact that women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movements</b> had on the family leave policymaking process in the United States and Canada. Because both countries have strong women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movements,</b> the research finds that the strength of movements is a necessary but not sufficient explanation for policy divergence. Instead, it is the cohesiveness and issue prioritization of the women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movement</b> within each nation that help determine family leave policies. Using process tracing, the study finds that women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movement</b> actors {{play a key role in}} the enactment of family leave policies. The data are varied, including interviews with movement leaders, movement literature, archival documents, and secondary literature. The research demonstrates that in situations where women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movements</b> are cohesive and prioritize family leave, the legislature is more likely to adopt paid leave policies. Alternatively, paid leave is unlikely to pass when the women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movement</b> is divided on the issue and does not make it a priority on its agenda. But women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movements</b> do not act alone; thus, no one variable can fully explain the policy variation within the United States and Canada. There are a number of other factors that may influence the passage of family leave policies, such as the strength of unions, the presence of critical actors in the legislature, the power of women 2 ̆ 7 s policy agencies, and the ideological orientation of the executive and legislative branches. The study demonstrates that there is an interactive effect between women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movements</b> and these other factors...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{exploration}} of the reasons why men join the men 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movement.</b> The study combines a literature review of the men 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movement</b> with ethnographic empirical research using in-depth interviews and focus group discussions. It also draws on participant observation of various men 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movement</b> events such as men 2 ̆ 7 s groups meetings, weekend gatherings and festivals. Themes and issues explored in the thesis include men 2 ̆ 7 s gender role disorientation, the impact of relationship break-ups, fathering and boys 2 ̆ 7 issues, men 2 ̆ 7 s health, problems with emotional expressiveness and issues of social isolation. Collectively, these and other issues have given rise to the notion of a crisis in masculine identity, or 2 ̆ 7 the masculinity crisis 2 ̆ 7. While there is no consensus about the existence of such a 2 ̆ 7 crisis 2 ̆ 7, men 2 ̆ 7 s endeavours to deal with these issues have lead to the emergence of the men 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movement.</b> This study identifies four major theoretical positions and men 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movement</b> groupings to examine men 2 ̆ 7 s issues. They include: the Profeminist strand, Fathers 2 ̆ 7 Rights, the Mythopoetic, and the Inclusives 2 ̆ 7 men 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movement.</b> The review of the literature revealed that the 2 ̆ 7 grassroots 2 ̆ 7 element of the men 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movement</b> is an under-researched social terrain. It also highlights existing discrepancy between the men 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movement</b> activities and academic analysis of them. Hence this study is a pioneering work using grounded theory to give representation to the voices {{of the participants in the}} men 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movement</b> on a range of issues confronting men today. Its scope goes beyond the previously dominant feminist perspective to interrogate the different issues experienced by men from each of the four theoretical men 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movement</b> perspectives. The findings of the study help to elucidate the nature of the men 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movement</b> and its likely trajectory. It traces the evolution of the men 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movement</b> in Australia and maps the ideological positions of the different men 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movement</b> strands on a range of social issues affecting men. The study concludes that the main reasons why men join the men 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movement</b> are both ideological and personal. The personal aspect relates to the experience of chronic or acute personal crises and the seeking of support and healing to deal with predicaments. The ideological causes relate to men 2 ̆ 7 s support of the feminist cause or reactions against feminism and the perceived gender inequity in service provision. The empirical findings also illustrated a dialectical interplay of ideological worldviews with regard to gender relationships and personal reasons, including pain associated with the impact of contemporary industrial reforms, gender relationships and masculinity changes which inform their beliefs and understanding, and motivate their continuing involvement. Overwhelmingly, the study found the feminist movement to be the main catalyst for men joining the men 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movement</b> either in support of or as a reaction to its impact on the lives of men. In particular, some men who have joined the men 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movement</b> in support of feminism have also discovered that their participation has addressed previously unacknowledged personal issues. Similarly, men who initially participate because of personal crises experience an evolution in their ideological beliefs which motivates their continuing involvement. The findings of the study indicate that men are changing, perhaps not at a rate and intensity women may want, or in a direction that some masculinity observers may wish for, but men are changing. Signs of change include men spending more time with their children, doing more domestic work, engaging in more democratic relationships with women, paying more attention to their physical and emotional health, and developing greater intimacy with other men. The findings of the study emphasise that there is no room for complacency or attributions of blame in the gender relationship discourse. They indicate that there is a need for both women and men to engage in open public gender debate out of which new gender relationship paradigms will emerge...|$|R

40|$|When elite men 2 ̆ 7 s colleges {{began to}} open their doors to women in the late 1960 s, elite women 2 ̆ 7 s colleges were faced with a dilemma that {{threatened}} their institutions 2 ̆ 7 continued existence. These colleges needed to redefine their purpose and communicate a new image {{in order to remain}} successful in a challenging environment. To investigate this process, I studied how three elite women 2 ̆ 7 s colleges responded to the challenging landscape of the 1970 s, particularly the specific challenge of responding to elite men 2 ̆ 7 s colleges 2 ̆ 7 conversion to coeducation. These elite women 2 ̆ 7 s colleges were successfully able to promote a new image of their institutions that argued for their validity, and the women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movement</b> was an important influence on that process. Mount Holyoke, Smith, and Wellesley decided to remain single-sex colleges for women after the elite men 2 ̆ 7 s colleges moved to coeducation, and I argue {{that they were able to}} do so because student opinion drastically changed in the early 1970 s due to the influence of the women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movement.</b> Despite similar goals, the elite women 2 ̆ 7 s colleges and the women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movement</b> have not always supported each other. Although their relationship was strained, women 2 ̆ 7 s colleges benefited from the women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movement,</b> not only because it changed students 2 ̆ 7 opinions, but also because the women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movement</b> opened up career opportunities and encouraged women to pursue them. This made it possible for women 2 ̆ 7 s colleges to successfully create and disseminate a new image based on the assertion that they best prepared young women for professional careers. This new image, grounded in an attack on coeducation that also borrowed from the women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movement,</b> made it possible for women 2 ̆ 7 s college to justify their continued existence. ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{analyses}} {{the evolution}} of the contemporary women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movement</b> in the Republic of Ireland, from the foundation of the State to the present day. Drawing on a social movement 2 ̆ 7 s perspective, the emergence, consolidation and transformation of the Women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Movement</b> in that period is explored. To date, there has been no systematic attempt at understanding the central processes and dynamics underlying the Irish Women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Movement.</b> This study seeks to address that deficit by illuminating the processes through which the Women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Movement,</b> and, in particular its constituent organisations, came to fruition as agencies of social change. The central argument advanced is that fundamentally the women’s movement in Ireland is characterised by its interconnectedness: the central tensions, themes and organising strategies of the movement interpenetrate not only across different social movement organisations, but across time and space. The movement 2 ̆ 7 s development is conceptualised in terms of four stages: A period of A b eyance which lasted from the Civil War {{until the end of the}} 1960 s; a period of rapid Advancement which occurred during the 1970 s; the Re-appraisal of the women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movement</b> from within, which occurred during the 1980 s; and the New Directions which manifested themselves particularly in the community sector in the late 1980 s and 1990 s. The study demonstrates the continuities which link the movement and its constituent organisations across these four stages of development. A key theme is the continual process of formalisation, which has had the effect of incorporating radical organisations on the margins of the Women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Movement</b> into the mainstream. Parallels can be drawn between the period of advancement in the 1970 s, and the new kinds of consolidation and formalisation occurring in the 1990 s. While the key analytical framework drawn on is resource mobilisation, considerable modifications are made to the model in its application to the Irish Women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Movement.</b> The movement 2 ̆ 7 s trajectory cannot adequately be documented without paying attention to the political opportunity structure, the potential for the development of external alliances, the existence of sympathetic elites and the role of ideology both as a source of conflict and as a valuable resource. The study makes an important contribution to our understanding of Irish social movements. There has been no previous attempt to explain the evolution, form and processes of the women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movement</b> from a sociological perspective. The method of analysis allows for tracing the continuities underlying the movement from the inception of the State to the present day, and challenges the received view that the women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movement</b> 2 ̆ 7 happened 2 ̆ 7 in Ireland as part of a generalised modernisation trend in the post- 1960 era.

The first section deals with the origin of the socialist women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movement</b> in the late nineteenth century, which originated from German-American socialism. The second section discusses how the American socialist women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movement</b> was born from the women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> reform <b>movements,</b> such as Women 2 ̆ 7 s Club, Women 2 ̆ 7 s Christian Temperance Union, Grange, Bellamy 2 ̆ 7 s Nationalism, Populism and so forth. However, under the strong leadership of the American Socialist Party, women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movement</b> was forced to change its course. The third section {{discusses the}} relationship between socialism and the labor movement. Even though socialist women and women in labor unions had similar ideals, women in labor unions refused to join the Socialist Party until the emergence of the World War I. In the fourth chapter, I will deal with the issue of women suffrage and socialism, which is the major topic of this paper. Woman suffrage was contradictory for socialists, since the demand for suffrage meant the acceptance of the present political system. However, socialist women supported suffrage as women 2 ̆ 7 s issue rather than class issue and worked with the mainstream suffragists. The Socialist Party finally endorsed woman suffrage in 1907. Nevertheless, in 1917, in face of the war, the party prohibited the cooperation between socialist suffragists and the mainstream suffragists. The war divided women 2 ̆ 7 s long- standing cooperation across class line. Feminism could not overcome the govenment pressure and women 2 ̆ 7 s voices for peace could not reach the male-dominated world at that time...|$|R

Following the Civil War, the women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movement</b> took on the semblance of a single-issue movement, as the effort to achieve woman suffrage consumed feminists 2 ̆ 7 resources and energies. The acquisition of suffrage was intended to be the vehicle for women to gain the spectrum of rights initially defined in 1848. Extravagant predictions about the power of suffrage led many women to view the vote as a panacea for the ills of society and women 2 ̆ 7 s place in society. When the vote failed to bring about major changes in the lives of most women, the women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movement</b> fragmented and stagnated.

The goal of my dissertation is {{to understand how the}} transnational women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movement</b> creates coalitions while remaining attentive to differences among movement actors. Coalition building in the transnational women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movement</b> means creating alliances across divisions of race, class, nationality, ethnicity, religion, age, and sexuality. The movement is constantly faced with a tradeoff between its ability to generate collective action by emphasizing commonalities and a desire to remain sensitive to differences among women. My research asks how the transnational women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movement</b> negotiates the seeming contradictions of building solidarity to create an inclusive movement. I conduct case studies of international conferences held by two transnational women 2 ̆ 7 s organizations, the Asia-Pacific Women 2 ̆ 7 s Watch (APWW) and Association of Women 2 ̆ 7 s Rights in Development (AWID) as way to understand how the transnational women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movement</b> builds coalition.

Safe spaces where dissent can be expressed without negative consequences are important to create inclusion. Second, I find in examining the nature of participation, that in order for members of marginalized groups to feel included not only must they be present but also acknowledged, given the opportunity to engage in discussions and be heard with respect. Third, I find that conference participants use two main strategies to build solidarity: they emphasize a common vision and common threats. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{sample of}} 201 women in feminist therapy and 207 women in {{traditional}} therapy {{was drawn from}} {{a national survey of}} women in consciousness-raising groups. Comparisons were made on political views at the time of entering therapy and on demographic characteristics and evaluations of therapy. There were no differences between clients of feminist and traditional therapy on demographic characteristics, symptom levels (Hopkins Sympton Checklist), and overall levels of life stress (Life-Events Stress Index). Clients of feminist therapists were more likely to describe their political views as radical and to identify themselves as members of the women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movement</b> than were clients of traditional therapists. Clients of feminist therapists rated therapy as more helpful than clients of traditional therapy did. Clients who identified themselves as members of the women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movement</b> evaluated feminist therapy as more helpful than traditional therapy; nonmembers evaluated feminist and traditional therapies as equally helpful.

40|$|Throughout {{the history}} of Indonesia, the {{concepts}} of gender and power-relations {{between men and women}} have been linked to a shifting and fluctuating idea of what constitutes good women, good men, and good gender relationships within the context of Indonesia and Islam. To analyse these changing attitudes to women 2 ̆ 7 s issues in Indonesia, we need to pay attention to several points: the character of the women 2 ̆ 7 s organizations, whether fully independent, semi autonomous, or subsidiaries of existing male organizations; the important issues rising within the movements, as well as the strategies to deal with them; and lastly the influential factor of government intervention in the women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movement.</b> This paper tries to explore the Muslim women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movement</b> and its strategy to accommodate or resist from the domination of Islam in terms of the nation state, the constitution and the dominant cultural norms in Indonesia...|$|R

Even for near future prediction, most techniques assume the trajectory of an object 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movements</b> can be represented by some mathematical formulas of motion functions based on its recent movements. However, an object 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movements</b> are more complicated than what the mathematical formulas can represent. Prediction based on an object 2 ̆ 7 s trajectory patterns is a powerful way and has been investigated by several work. But their main interest is how to discover the patterns. In this paper, we present a novel prediction approach, namely The Hybrid Prediction Model, which estimates an object 2 ̆ 7 s future locations based on its pattern information as well as existing motion functions using the object 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> recent <b>movements.</b> Specifically, an object 2 ̆ 7 s trajectory patterns which have ad-hoc forms for prediction are discovered and then indexed by a novel access method for efficient query processing. In addition, two query processing techniques that can provide accurate results for both near and distant time predictive queries are presented. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that proposed techniques are more accurate and efficient than existing forecasting schemes...|$|R
40|$|In {{spite of}} the devastating effects of civil wars on women 2 ̆ 7 s human rights, an {{emerging}} body of literature links civil wars to improved outcomes in a few specific areas of women 2 ̆ 7 s empowerment, such as political representation and employment. But why do some post-conflict states show improvements in women 2 ̆ 7 s empowerment while others do not? Using a quantitative analysis and a qualitative analysis, this study shows that the interaction between international actors and domestic women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movements</b> accounts for variation in women 2 ̆ 7 s empowerment in post-conflict states. Using an original dataset of 45 low-income and middle-low-income countries, this study shows states that experience civil war are distinctive in their changes in women 2 ̆ 7 s empowerment compared to countries that have not experienced internal armed conflict. The quantitative analysis also finds that the interaction between foreign direct assistance {{and the presence of}} a domestic women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movement,</b> and factors such as social and cultural institutions have a significant and positive impact on women 2 ̆ 7 s empowerment. The qualitative analysis, based on four post-conflict cases—Rwanda, Sri Lanka, Guatemala, and Afghanistan—also shows that the interaction between international actors and strong and autonomous women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>movements</b> accounts for variation in women 2 ̆ 7 s empowerment. This study suggests that efforts to advance women 2 ̆ 7 s empowerment need to be cognizant of the effects of these international and domestic factors. ...|$|R
