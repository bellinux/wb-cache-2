40|$|AbstractPerceptual fading of texture targets on {{similarly}} textured backgrounds was {{studied in}} relation to stimulus salience using texture patterns defined by orientation contrast, shape contrast, and order contrast. In two independent experiments, perceptual salience of the targets was determined. In the first, the textural contrast of the stimuli was varied and their salience quantified using magnitude estimation; in the second, reaction time was measured for the same stimulus patterns. In a third experiment, stimulus <b>fading</b> <b>time</b> was determined. Whereas magnitude estimates and <b>fading</b> <b>time</b> increased, reaction time decreased with increasing textural contrast strength, {{the shape of the}} curves depending on the kind of texture pattern used. When <b>fading</b> <b>time</b> was plotted against target salience, the slopes of the regression lines for shape and order contrast were similar, while the slope for orientation contrast was steeper, indicating longer fading times at equal stimulus salience. A control experiment using short oriented bars instead of gratings revealed that this difference may be attributed to the abutting contour between the target and its surround. With this contour removed, the <b>fading</b> <b>time</b> was largely the same for all three kinds of texture patterns. In the absence of a border (no cancellation), the unconnected target areas appeared to change gradually in orientation, shape, and spatial arrangement, thereby assuming the properties of the background (substitution) ...|$|E

40|$|In mobile {{communication}} systems, channel coding and equalisation {{are required to}} achieve high-quality signals. The channel degradation owing to multipath <b>fading,</b> <b>time</b> spread and Doppler spread can be further reduced by using diversity techniques, where the receiver is provided with multiple independently faded replicas of the same information signal. The information coming from the diversity channels can be properly combined to improve the system performance. In the paper a new diversity receiver which performs demodulation and decoding of mobile-radio signals is described. The proposed demodulation scheme uses a new distance-combination technique based on the classical MLSE Viterbi algorithm. A new soft-decoding algorithm combining the signals coming from the diversity channels is proposed.

40|$|AbstractThis study {{measured}} the <b>fading</b> <b>times</b> of peripheral targets {{as a function}} of whether viewing was monocular or binocular, and of brightness contrast. Data from a binocularly normal group showed Troxler fading to be significantly faster with monocular (i. e., patched) than with binocular viewing. In contrast, one-eyed observers showed significantly longer <b>fading</b> <b>times</b> than the two-eyed observers viewing monocularly and equivalent times to their binocular viewing. A control experiment showed that these findings were not due to worse fixation stability, larger pupil sizes, or an unusually large blinking rate in the enucleated group. The enucleated group actually exhibited a slight miosis, equivalent fixation stability, and a normal blinking rate. In both experiments, the <b>times</b> to <b>fading</b> of all observers were a function of brightness contrast. We conclude that in binocularly normal observers patching or closing one eye does not produce monocular vision but rather a condition of weak binocular rivalry, and that the absence of inhibitory binocular interactions in the enucleated group may explain, in part, their resistance to fading and their superior performance in other contrast-defined tasks...|$|R

While iso-orientation produces strong inhibition, cross-orientation enhances the response [Knierim, J. J., & Van Essen, D. C. (1992). Neuronal {{responses to}} static texture patterns in area V 1 of the alert macaque monkey. Journal of Neurophysiology, 67, 961 – 980]. We looked for a perceptual correlate of neuronal texture modulation using perceived salience as well as fading and filling-in as response criteria. Two patterns by Vicario (1998) [Vicario, G. B. (1998). On Wertheimer’s principles of organization. In G. Stemberger, (Ed.), Gestalt theory, (Vol. 20, pp. 256 – 270). Vienna: Verlag Krammer] served as targets. One consisted of randomly oriented bars {{in the center and}} uniformly oriented bars in the surround, while the other had bars of uniform orientation in the center and bars of random orientation in the surround. In spite of identical texture contrast at the boundary, the first pattern was judged more salient than the second and its center took more time to fade. When the surround was decreased in width, <b>fading</b> <b>time</b> followed no systematic trend and filling-in was increasingly replaced by filling-out. A higher salience and longer <b>fading</b> <b>time</b> for stimuli with a uniformly as opposed to randomly oriented surround was also obtained when the bars in the center were replaced by dotted arrays. However, no asymmetry was found for the converse patterns when dots were in the surround and bars in the center. Findings are interpreted in terms of stronger surround suppression exerted by randomly oriented bars as compared to uniformly oriented bars. Modeling suggests that this suppression may mediate a statistical computation by the visual system, aimed at detecting a texture boundary between the center and surround when the center texture was likely generated by a different random process than that which generated the surround...|$|E
