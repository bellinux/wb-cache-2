5|$|American {{vehicles}} used <b>Drum</b> <b>brakes</b> {{until the}} 1962 Studebaker Avanti - the first American production model with front wheel Disc brakes as standard equipment. These are {{less prone to}} fade and are the current standard of design.|$|E
5|$|The {{braking system}} is {{conventional}} hydraulic (Power assisted) with disk brakes {{at the front}} and <b>drum</b> <b>brakes</b> at the rear. Anti-lock Braking System and Traction Control System is fitted. The hand/parking brake is cable operated, acting on the rear wheels. The hydraulic fluid reservoir is under the front bonnet/hood. As there is no manifold vacuum, there is an electric vacuum pump located under the rear loading platform. There are interlocks on the braking system so that the starting up process can only be initiated when the brake pedal is pressed.|$|E
25|$|Mk1 Introduced March 1984, the SA Swift was {{front wheel}} drive, {{with a solid}} axle and <b>drum</b> <b>brakes</b> on the rear, with front disc brakes.|$|E
5000|$|The single-leading-shoe <b>drum</b> <b>brake</b> (SLS), a.k.a. [...] "leading/trailing drum brake", is a {{basic type}} of <b>drum</b> <b>brake</b> design.|$|R
5000|$|As introduced, the Servi-Car had a <b>drum</b> <b>brake</b> on {{the front}} wheel and another <b>drum</b> <b>brake</b> inside the rear axle housing, {{decelerating}} both rear wheels. [...] In 1937, the braking system was upgraded to have a <b>drum</b> <b>brake</b> on each wheel. [...] A hydraulic rear brake system was introduced in 1951. The very last Servi-Cars, built late in their last model year, would have disc brakes on all three wheels.|$|R
50|$|<b>Drum</b> <b>brake</b> {{components}} {{include the}} backing plate, <b>brake</b> <b>drum,</b> shoe, wheel cylinder, and various springs and pins.|$|R
25|$|New {{options for}} 1967 {{included}} front disc brakes and a stereo 8-track tape player. The standard <b>drum</b> <b>brakes</b> were upgraded with more cooling fins and a dual-master cylinder system was introduced.|$|E
25|$|<b>Drum</b> <b>brakes</b> provide {{consistent}} braking in wet or dirty conditions {{since the}} mechanism is fully enclosed. They are usually heavier, more complicated, and often weaker than rim brakes, but they require less maintenance. <b>Drum</b> <b>brakes</b> do not adapt well to quick release axle fastening, and removing a drum brake wheel requires the operator to disconnect the brake cable {{as well as}} the axle. They also require a torque arm which must be anchored to the frame or fork of the bicycle, and not all bicycles are constructed to accommodate such fastenings or tolerate their applied forces.|$|E
25|$|The <b>drum</b> <b>brakes</b> {{with which}} the early 24s were {{delivered}} drew criticism for inadequate stopping power and excessive vibration: after 1965 the 24BT and 24CT received front disc brakes which addressed the problem.|$|E

25|$|Tires were 9.00x20 with dual rear tires. Brakes {{were full}} air with <b>drum</b> <b>brakes</b> on all wheels. Trailer air {{connections}} applied trailer-brakes with the truck brakes and a hand lever could apply the trailer brakes alone.|$|E
25|$|<b>Drum</b> <b>brakes</b> {{are most}} common on utility {{bicycles}} in some countries, especially the Netherlands, {{and are also}} often found on freight bicycles and velomobiles. Older tandem bicycles often employed a rear drum brake as a drag brake.|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of the model year, variable-ratio power {{steering}} and power <b>drum</b> <b>brakes</b> were optional equipment. Those items were made standard equipment on all LeSabres (and Wildcats) effective January 1, 1970. Power front disc brakes remained an extra-cost option.|$|E

25|$|A bicycle brake {{reduces the}} speed of a bicycle or {{prevents}} it from moving. The three main types are: rim brakes, disc brakes, and <b>drum</b> <b>brakes.</b> There have been various types of brakes used throughout history, and several are still in use today.|$|E
25|$|Prime {{movers and}} tankers had 10.00x22 size tires, while bridge, crane, and semi-tractor trucks had 14.00x20s {{with a larger}} cross-section. All had dual rear tires. Brakes were full air with <b>drum</b> <b>brakes</b> on all wheels. Prime movers had {{adjustable}} electrical brake connections for trailer brakes.|$|E
25|$|The 2CV design predates the {{invention}} of disc brake, so 1948–1981 cars have <b>drum</b> <b>brakes</b> on all four wheels. In October 1981, front disc brakes were fitted. Disc brake cars use green LHM fluid – a mineral oil – which is not compatible with standard glycol brake fluid.|$|E

25|$|The car had <b>drum</b> <b>brakes</b> all round. Wheels were steel, {{dressed up}} with full-diameter chrome hubcaps and 4-ply 6.40×15-inch whitewall tires. The {{interior}} featured luxurious leather upholstery, foam rubber cushions, adjustable steering wheel, and a cigarette lighter. Completed vehicles were {{shipped to the}} United States for sale through the Nash dealership network.|$|E
25|$|Major {{criticisms of}} the GTO {{continued}} to center on its slow steering (ratio of 17.5:1, four turns lock-to-lock) and subpar brakes. Car Life was satisfied with the metallic brakes on its GTO, but Motor Trend and Road Test found the four-wheel <b>drum</b> <b>brakes</b> with organic linings to be alarmingly inadequate in high-speed driving.|$|E
25|$|Toyota {{states that}} it filed 1000 patents during the {{development}} of the XW30 Prius. The concept of the powertrain largely carried over from the previous XW20 model, although the engine displacement was increased to 1.8 litres and the transaxle was changed to the THS III. Disc brakes replaced the North American model's rear <b>drum</b> <b>brakes.</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{accurately}} calculate the braking efficiency factor of <b>drum</b> <b>brake</b> shoe of heavy truck, virtual prototyping {{of a heavy}} truck's brake is demonstrated. The requirements for brakes include not only its performance but also its comfort, serviceability and working lifetime, which must be high. The finite element analysis software ANSYS and the multi-body system simulation software MSC. ADAMS were used to establish the <b>drum</b> <b>brake</b> nonlinear 3 D simulation model. The model was built by developing joint program module between the rigid shoe and the flexible lining and nonlinear contact force program module between the lining and the rigid drum. Using this model, the simulation was executed for the <b>drum</b> <b>brake</b> of 32 t heavy duty truck. The {{results show that the}} simulated braking efficiency factor coincides with experimental results of the braking efficiency factor of the heavy truck <b>drum</b> <b>brake...</b>|$|R

25|$|From 1982 through 2003, {{with the}} {{exception}} of several years, Honda produced a CB750 known as the Nighthawk 750. Early models were designated the CB750SC Nighthawk while later models were simply known as the Nighthawk 750. The Nighthawk 750SC had a 4-stroke engine with a 5-speed manual transmission, chain drive and has front disc and rear <b>drum</b> <b>brakes.</b>|$|E
25|$|Early {{versions}} used four speed manual transmission, whilst {{the current}} car is available with either six speed manual or five speed automatic transmission. The suspension system on all models uses a fully independent MacPherson strut front suspension, and a Twist-beam rear suspension. Most models use disc brakes {{at the front}} and rear <b>drum</b> <b>brakes,</b> although some recent models have all round disc brakes.|$|E
25|$|The {{braking system}} {{includes}} four-channel ABS, electronic brake distribution, and a creep aid system {{to prevent the}} car from rolling on a hill. A brake booster pressure monitoring system monitors vacuum when the engine is shut off during Idle Stop mode. Traction control and vehicle stability assist are also included. The front brakes are single-piston sliding caliper with a one-piece ventilated rotor. <b>Drum</b> <b>brakes</b> {{are used in the}} rear.|$|E
