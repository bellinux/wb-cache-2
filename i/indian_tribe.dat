5|$|Alexander F. Reichert was {{appointed}} by the Supreme Court to argue the case for Lara. Reichert argued that an <b>Indian</b> <b>tribe</b> had no inherent sovereignty in regards to non-member Indians, but only the power that Congress decided to give the tribe, citing Duro, Wheeler, and Oliphant v. Suquamish <b>Indian</b> <b>Tribe</b> to support his argument. He stated {{that it was the}} place of the Supreme Court, not Congress, to determine the inherent sovereignty of the tribe. Lara argued that since the tribe had no such inherent sovereignty, it could only prosecute a non-member Indian based upon federal sovereignty, which would make a subsequent Federal prosecution a violation of the prohibition of double jeopardy. It was noted that members of Indian tribes were at the same time United States citizens, and protected under the constitution {{in the same manner as}} any other citizen. Reichert stated that Duro was decided as a constitutional issue, not as a matter of common law, and it was the Court's place to determine the issue, not the place of Congress. To subject Lara to a prosecution by a tribal court, which was not subject to the Bill of Rights, would deprive Lara of his rights as a United States citizen. Lara's position was supported by amicus curiae briefs filed by the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, Lewis County, Idaho, (along with several other counties), the Citizen's Equal Rights Foundation, and T. Morris, E. Morris, and R. Morris (individual Indians).|$|E

After the war, he declined President James Monroe's offer to become Secretary of War. In his last act of public service, Shelby and Andrew Jackson acted as commissioners to negotiate the Jackson Purchase from the Chickasaw <b>Indian</b> <b>tribe.</b> Isaac Shelby died, at his estate in Lincoln County, Kentucky, on July 18, 1826.|$|E

5|$|The Menominee <b>Indian</b> <b>Tribe</b> {{had entered}} {{into a series of}} {{treaties}} with the United States that did not specifically state that they had hunting and fishing rights. In 1961, Congress terminated the tribe's federal recognition, ending its right to govern itself, federal support of health care and education programs, police and fire protection, and tribal rights to land. In 1963, three members of the tribe were charged with violating Wisconsin's hunting and fishing laws on land which had been a reservation for over 100 years. The tribe members were acquitted, but when the state appealed, the Wisconsin Supreme Court held that the Menominee tribe no longer had hunting and fishing rights because of the termination action by Congress.|$|E

5|$|In late 2006, the Jamul <b>Indian</b> <b>tribe</b> {{prepared}} {{to construct a}} casino, but many expressed concerns {{about the amount of}} traffic that would now travel on SR 94. In 2007, Caltrans declared that the construction required a permit to connect to SR94 and to construct on the state right-of-way. At the end of the year, the tribe had started construction on the driveway to the casino, while Caltrans stated that it lacked the information needed to determine if the proposed traffic signal should be approved. In late 2009, the tribe filed a lawsuit against Caltrans over the inability to get approval to connect the driveway with the highway. The tribe made the claim that they were a sovereign nation and did not need the approval, but this was rejected by the court. Caltrans and the tribe came to an agreement in 2009, where the tribe would provide its own studies and pay for environmental mitigation.|$|E

40|$|This Article will {{demonstrate}} {{that virtually all}} elements of Indian affairs {{can be traced to}} the decision of the United States to recognize <b>Indian</b> <b>tribes</b> as political entities and to make Indian law and policy based on the political status of <b>Indian</b> <b>tribes.</b> <b>Indian</b> law is often assumed to be race law. As a result, observers tend to try to force Indian law into the constitutional race law paradigm. Justice Blackmun’s footnote 24 in Morton v. Mancari – describing federal legislation and rules relating to <b>Indian</b> <b>tribes</b> as a political classification – hit upon the proper understanding of Indian law.

5|$|Lara then {{requested}} a rehearing en banc {{by the full}} court. The request was granted, and the full court reversed {{the decision of the}} three-judge panel, ordering that the federal indictment be dismissed on the grounds of double jeopardy. While the court noted that the Fifth Amendment allowed prosecution by two separate sovereigns, such as the federal government and a state government, it found that an <b>Indian</b> <b>tribe</b> derived its authority to prosecute offenders from the ICRA, which was federal law. The court noted that in previous Supreme Court rulings, the determination of tribal jurisdiction was based on the tribal membership of the individual, not on his race as an Indian. This meant that double jeopardy attached. The United States then appealed to the Supreme Court, which granted certiorari to hear the case.|$|E
5|$|Several legal {{developments}} {{occurred on}} the eve of the settlement. First, the First Circuit held in Bottomly v. Passamaquoddy Tribe (1979) that the Passamaquoddy were entitled to tribal sovereign immunity (see supra). Second, the Maine Supreme Judicial Court held in State v. Dana (1979) that the state had no jurisdiction to punish on-reservation arson because of the federal Major Crimes Act. Third, in Wilson v. Omaha <b>Indian</b> <b>Tribe</b> (1979), the U.S. Supreme Court held that the provision of the Nonintercourse Act placing the burden of proof in land claims on non-Indians did not apply to U.S. state defendants (but did apply to corporate defendants); further, language in Wilson threatened to confine the applicability of the Act to Indian country. The tribes persuaded the U.S. Solicitor General to file a motion asking the Court to delete that language from its opinion. The Court denied the motion. Maine unsuccessfully sought certiorari in Dana on the basis of Wilson.|$|E
5|$|The case arose when a Minnesota county taxed an Indian's {{mobile home}} {{located on the}} reservation. The Court ruled that the state {{did not have the}} {{authority}} to impose such a tax or, more generally, to regulate behavior on the reservation. Bryan has become a landmark case that has led to Indian gaming on reservations and altered the economic status of almost every <b>Indian</b> <b>tribe.</b> Later decisions, citing Bryan, ruled that Public Law 280 allows states to enact prohibitions, or crimes, that would apply on reservations, but could not impose regulations on conduct that was otherwise allowed. The case has also called into question the ability of the states to impose any sort of regulations on tribal reservations, such as labor standards and certain traffic regulations.|$|E
