5|$|An <b>inverse</b> agonist {{can have}} effects {{similar to those}} of an antagonist, but causes a {{distinct}} set of downstream biological responses. Constitutively active receptors that exhibit intrinsic or basal activity can have <b>inverse</b> agonists, which not only block the effects of binding agonists like a classical antagonist but also inhibit the basal activity of the receptor. Many drugs previously classified as antagonists are now beginning to be reclassified as <b>inverse</b> agonists because of the discovery of constitutive active receptors. Antihistamines, originally classified as antagonists of histamine H1 receptors have been reclassified as <b>inverse</b> agonists.|$|E

5|$|Exponentiation {{occurs in}} many areas of {{mathematics}} and its <b>inverse</b> function {{is often referred to as}} the logarithm. For example, the logarithm of a matrix is the (multi-valued) <b>inverse</b> function of the matrix exponential. Another example is the p-adic logarithm, the <b>inverse</b> function of the p-adic exponential. Both are defined via Taylor series analogous to the real case. In the context of differential geometry, the exponential map maps the tangent space at a point of a manifold to a neighborhood of that point. Its <b>inverse</b> is also called the logarithmic (or log) map.|$|E

40|$|Incomplete LU {{factorization}} is {{a valuable}} preconditioning approach for sparse iterative solvers. An "ideal" preconditioner for the iterative solution of Ax = b is A Γ 1 itself. This paper describes a preconditioner based on sparse approximations to the <b>inverses</b> and partitioned <b>inverses</b> of the L and U factors of A. These <b>inverses</b> and partitioned <b>inverses</b> are normally somewhat sparse. Their sparsity can be enhanced with suitable ordering and partitioning algorithms. Sparse approximations to these partitioned <b>inverses</b> {{can be obtained by}} discarding selected nonzero entries of these <b>inverses.</b> Experimental results indicate that the use of these approximate partitioned <b>inverses</b> as preconditioners results in excellent highly parallel preconditioners. The reasons for this performance are: first, perturbations to certain entries in these partitioned <b>inverses</b> do not propagate to the entire solution vector; second, the numerical values of many of these partitioned nonzero entries are quite [...] ...|$|R

In the first part, we develop a general method for expressing ranks of matrix {{expressions}} that involve Moore-Penrose <b>inverses,</b> group <b>inverses,</b> Drazin <b>inverses,</b> as well as weighted Moore-Penrose <b>inverses</b> of matrices. Through this method we establish a variety of valuable rank equalities related to generalized <b>inverses</b> of matrices mentioned above.
