The understory contains plants such as Pacific yew, Pacific madrone, chinquapin, and vine maple. Several invasive species {{have been reported in the}} Big Butte Creek watershed, such as <b>Kentucky</b> <b>bluegrass,</b> common bent, drooping brome, and redtop. The spread of these species is most likely due to overgrazing. Sensitive species that grow in the watershed include Howell's yampah, Egg Lake monkeyflower, clustered lady's slipper, green-flowered ginger, Mount Mazama collomia, and Detling's microseris. Mallow and popcorn flower have also been discovered in riparian zones. The Poverty Flats Area of Critical Environmental Concern (ACEC) is home to several rare species of plants, including Bellinger's meadowfoam, Howell's yampah, and Rocky Mountain woodsia.|$|E

The previous {{meeting between the}} two teams occurred in 2012, with the Saints winning 30–13. As a result, offensively, the two teams were similar conceptually. For the Bears' offense, a challenge exists in the Saints' 3–4 defense, which ranked sixth in yards allowed at 304.5 per game and fifth in points with 13.8. Additionally, Cameron Jordan and Junior Galette had four and three sacks, respectively, while seven other Saints had a combined total of 12 sacks. Also, Saints tight end Jimmy Graham, the defending NFC Player of the Month, had six touchdowns on the season, and was one touchdown away from tying Mike Ditka and Antonio Gates for the most touchdowns {{in the first five}} games by a tight end. Jeff Joniak writes that Soldier Field's <b>Kentucky</b> <b>bluegrass</b> could also serve as an advantage for the Bears, as Drew Brees was 0–4 in Chicago, but those losses occurred in December and January, when the climate was much colder. In the last three meetings in Chicago, the Saints committed a total of nine turnovers (4 in the 2006 NFC Championship game, 3 in 2007, and 2 in 2008), which Joniak considered [...] "may be the only thing slowing down the Saints." ...|$|E
