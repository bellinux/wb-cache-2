40|$|The bronchodilating effect, circulatory effects, and {{subjective}} {{side effects of}} <b>ibuterol</b> hydrochloride, the di-isobutyric acid ester of terbutaline, at two dose levels (2 and 4 mg) were {{compared with those of}} 5 mg terbutaline sulphate in a double-blind cross-over study on 12 patients with asthma. Both drugs were given by mouth. The 2 -mg dose of <b>ibuterol</b> had the same bronchodilating effect during the first three hours as 5 mg terbutaline. The 4 -mg dose, however, produced a significantly greater increase in the peak expiratory flow rate between the 30 th and 120 th minutes than terbutaline. No significant changes in heart rate or pulse amplitude were noted, and {{there was no difference in}} the incidence of subjective side effects between <b>ibuterol</b> at either dose level and terbutaline...|$|E
