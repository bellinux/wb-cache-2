5|$|In 2004, {{along with}} the law authorizing the change of the flag ratio, a state <b>flag</b> <b>was</b> adopted. This flag {{displays}} the national emblem in a banner form. The ratio of the flag {{is the same as}} that of the national flag, i.e. 3:5. The state flag, called the historical national (armorial) flag in law, was proposed by Česlovas Juršėnas, the vice-speaker of the Seimas, and by Edmundas Rimša, the chairman of the Commission of Heraldry. This <b>flag</b> <b>was</b> also proposed at the same time as the grand coat of arms; both were meant to honor the 750th anniversary of the coronation of Mindaugas in 1253. The designer of the State (historic) flag and coat of arms was Arvydas Každailis. Historically, this <b>flag</b> <b>was</b> used during the Battle of Grunwald, and has served as the government flag for Central Lithuania from 1922 until 1939. This was one of the few flags considered to become the national flag during the drive for national independence. Several other countries, including Finland, Spain, Venezuela, Germany and Thailand, have an official national flag for civilian use and a state flag for government use.|$|E

This <b>flag</b> <b>was</b> used exclusively as the kingdom's banner since Manuel I possessed a personal standard which included the armillary sphere for the first time.|$|E
