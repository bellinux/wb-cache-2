Deeply hurt by this comment, Bart then began the process of developing his path into the mischievous way of life.|$|E

At Whittier High, Nixon suffered his first electoral defeat, for student body president. He often rose at 4a.m., to drive the family truck into Los Angeles and purchase vegetables at the market. He then drove to the store to wash and display them, before <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>school.</b> Harold had been diagnosed with tuberculosis the previous year; when their mother took him to Arizona in the hopes of improving his health, the demands on Richard increased, causing him to give up football.

25|$|Lack of {{meaningful}} alternatives, such as affordable schools and quality education, according to ILO, is another major factor driving children to harmful labour. Children work {{because they have}} nothing better to do. Many communities, particularly rural areas where between 60–70% of child labour is prevalent, do not possess adequate school facilities. Even when schools are sometimes available, they are too far away, difficult to reach, unaffordable or {{the quality of education}} is so poor that parents wonder if <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>school</b> is really worth it.|$|E

25|$|Desirable actions such as enrolling {{children}} in school or receiving vaccinations can be encouraged by a form of aid known as conditional cash transfers. In Mexico, for example, dropout rates of 16- to 19-year-olds in rural area dropped by 20% and children gained half an inch in height. Initial fears that the program would encourage families {{to stay at home}} rather than work to collect benefits have proven to be unfounded. Instead, there is less excuse for neglectful behavior as, for example, children stopped begging on the streets instead of <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>school</b> because it could result in suspension from the program.|$|E
25|$|The street {{children}} and children {{running away from}} home are connected. A child running away from home ends {{on the street in}} most situations. There is lot of data available on why children run away, revealing many reasons for doing so. Some reasons are simple, some complex. Some time the reasons are because of the child's behavior, and some times the causes are because of parents. A child not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>school</b> or not doing home work and thus fearing beatings, is a very common cause. A child stealing money, fighting with siblings are reasons too.|$|E
25|$|Hayek {{displayed}} {{an intellectual}} and academic bent {{from a very}} young age. He read fluently and frequently before <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>school.</b> At his father's suggestion, Hayek, as a teenager, read the genetic and evolutionary works of Hugo de Vries and the philosophical works of Ludwig Feuerbach. In school Hayek was much taken by one instructor's lectures on Aristotle's ethics. In his unpublished autobiographical notes, Hayek recalled a division {{between him and his}} younger brothers who were only few years younger than he, but he believed that they were somehow of a different generation. He preferred to associate with adults.|$|E

25|$|A Japanese school {{opened in}} Hawaii in 1893 and other Japanese schools for {{temporary}} settlers in North America followed. In the {{years prior to}} World War II, many second generation Japanese American attended the American school by day and the Japanese school in the evening to keep up their Japanese skill as well as English. Other first generation Japanese American parents were worried that their child might {{go through the same}} discrimination when <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>school</b> so they gave them the choice to either go back to Japan to be educated, or to stay in America with their parents and study both languages. Anti-Japanese sentiment during World War I resulted in public efforts to close Japanese-language schools. The 1927 Supreme Court case Farrington v. Tokushige protected the Japanese American community's right to have Japanese language private institutions. During the internment of Japanese Americans in World War II many Japanese schools were closed. After the war many Japanese schools reopened.|$|E
25|$|NY214 {{became the}} subject of {{controversy}} for the conditions of the road through Lanesville and Greene County.

The committee noted that the conditions of NY214 were dangerous, with the road's pavement not being maintained for use of the school bus and guard rails were not installed to keep cars from going into waterways. The parents remained committed and held about 55 students out of school starting January 2, stating that nothing still had been done to maintain NY214. Burton Belknap, part of the State Education Department, stated that they intended to make sure they would work with the local parents {{in order to get the}} students back in school. The student strike was lifted on January 13 on conditions that the town of Hunter made for repairing the road.|$|E
