30|$|The Unemployment Insurance (UI) Bonus Experiments were {{implemented}} {{to test whether}} offering claimants a bonus for returning to work within a reasonable period would reduce costs to the UI system. The original bonus experiment was conducted in Illinois in 1984 and provided a bonus of $ 500 to claimants who found a job within 11 weeks of filing a claim. The experiment was very successful, with UI duration reduced by 1.15 weeks and payments reduced by $ 194. Given {{the success of the}} original experiment, replications were conducted in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Washington, with disappointing results. The reduction in weeks claimed was 0.5  weeks in New Jersey, and the impacts in Pennsylvania and Washington were generally smaller and not statistically significant. The lack of strong results in the replication states reduced interest in the <b>employment</b> <b>bonus</b> strategy.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} some long-run macroeconomic {{effects of}} European financial integration. In particular {{we focus on}} the further reduction and abolition of cross-border barriers impeding the entry into the markets of banking and insurance products. We follow a theoretical as well as an empirical approach to make predictions about how deeper integration will affect growth and unemployment rates. In our growth model we show that enhanced foreign financial market penetration should increase the overall growth rate unambiguously. The empirical analysis includes a wide set of indicators, each of them capturing different aspects of financial development and financial market integration. On the basis of the estimations a weak growth impact of foreign market penetration can be identified. Hence, deeper financial integration generates a growth bonus. But the long-run growth effect is conditional on differences in institutional characteristics captured by country-specific effects. The analysis is supplemented by an analysis of the potential employment benefits of deeper financial integration. We show that the growth bonus can be transformed into an <b>employment</b> <b>bonus,</b> but also not without considering substantial country-specific differences. ...|$|E

40|$|Moral hazard {{means that}} people with {{insurance}} may take greater risks {{because they know they}} do not bear the full consequences of their actions. This can occur with both private insurance and social insurance. Deductibles can be used to alleviate the problem. An interesting way to bring deductibles into social insurance is to establish individual social accounts. Mandatory payments into individual social accounts that finance social insurance payments replace taxes that are currently financing social-insurance benefits. At retirement, the remaining balances in the accounts are paid to account holders or added to their retirement benefits. If the account balance is negative at that time, the account is set to zero. The report considers individual unemployment accounts, including severance payments accounts and <b>employment</b> <b>bonuses,</b> and health and long-term care accounts. social insurance, moral hazard, individual social accounts...|$|R
30|$|Generally, Fig.  4 {{suggests}} that increasing course-taking alone {{did not lead}} to increases in earnings during the follow-up period. But neither did the acquisition of new qualifications, such as training certificates, obtained by completing those courses. This is partly evident from the experiences of members of the NDLP subgroup who entered the programme with A-level qualifications. As discussed elsewhere, earnings impacts for this subgroup were more than 15  per cent above those of the control group, which is the largest increase among the subgroups shown in Fig.  4. However, those with A-levels did not experience increases in any of the education and training measures shown in the figure. A closer examination of the course-taking impacts for this subgroup reveals very few effects of ERA on any course-taking outcomes. Therefore, {{it seems likely that the}} impacts for this subgroup reflect the effectiveness of other ERA components, such as the <b>employment</b> retention <b>bonus</b> or adviser advancement support. This subgroup had relatively high take-up of the <b>employment</b> retention <b>bonus,</b> suggesting that the retention bonus was more important than the training support and training incentives, at least for this subgroup.|$|R
30|$|Both ERA’s in-work {{support from}} {{advisers}} and its <b>employment</b> retention <b>bonus</b> {{may have contributed}} to the programme’s positive labour market effects. All of the elements of ERA were offered as a package, and this makes it very difficult to determine whether some components of the intervention were more effective than others. For example, by design, participants were expected to speak with staff about advancement issues each time they received a retention bonus. However, the intensity with which local Jobcentre Plus offices implemented each of these components varied, and the local offices did not necessarily implement each component equally well.|$|R
50|$|Robertson v British Gas Corp 1983 ICR 351 is a UK {{labour law}} case {{concerning}} the contract of employment.

5000|$|The {{basis of}} any individual's bonus may vary from {{complete}} {{discretion of the}} bank's board or managers to a firm contractual entitlement; specific awards will depend on their <b>employment</b> contract, <b>bonus</b> scheme, and negotiations, {{as well as the}} bank's performance and the individual's. As well as individual contractual bonus arrangements, banks often have one or more discretionary bonus schemes to provide motivational structures to more junior staff without giving any entitlements. Of course, bonus policy is only one part of a bank's total remuneration and motivation structure which may include pay scales, promotions and reviews, share and option schemes, pensions, expenses, and benefits in kind.|$|R
40|$|The {{existing}} principal-agent models either {{assume that}} the agent is risk-averse or risk-neutral. However, in reality people appear to value insurance in some situations while enjoy risk in others. This paper revisits the standard principal-agent problem {{under the assumption that}} the agent’s preferences can be described by a utility function proposed by Friedman and Savage (1948) to capture the above con‡icting attitudes towards risk. Unlike in the standard framework with a risk-averse agent, the second best contract in the present model can achieve full e¢ciency under a range of parameter values. Moreover, the optimal contract frequently resembles simple contracts used in practice – a bonus scheme, a promotion tournament, or a stock option grant.

30|$|ERA {{produced}} short-term earnings {{gains for}} the two lone parent target groups: the NDLP and WTC groups, which were made up mostly of women. The early gains resulted from increases {{in the proportion of}} participants who worked full time (at least 30 h per week). This pattern aligns with the programme’s requirement that participants work full time in order to qualify for the <b>employment</b> retention <b>bonus.</b> These effects generally faded in the later years, after the programme ended. However, an earnings gain appears to have lasted longer among NDLP participants who were better educated, though initially unemployed. Compared with other unemployed lone parents, this group may have had more unrealised potential to succeed in work, which ERA may have tapped into. From a cost-benefit perspective, ERA did not produce encouraging results for the lone parent groups, {{with the exception of the}} NDLP better-educated subgroup.|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 47 - 48) Shift differentials are {{a form of}} bonus typically paid {{to employees}} who work "premium" shifts such as evenings (3 PM- 11 PM) and nights (11 PM- 7 AM). This practice was introduced in hospitals when individual organizations began to {{find it difficult to}} recruit and place prospective employees for night and evening coverage, and now payment of shift differential is commonplace in hospitals in the San Fernando Valley. An inflationary economy, rapid changes in technology, spiraling costs, and shortages in many allied health resources, have forced many hospitals to compete for declining employee resources by providing more attractive benefits, <b>employment</b> <b>bonuses,</b> and even larger shift differentials for employees working night and evening shifts in an attempt to attract and retain qualified personnel. Consequently, increased demand for allied health professionals has led to a gradual escalation of salary and incentive programs directed at employee recruitment and placement. Concern over the increasing use of shift differentials and bonuses inspired one local hospital to more closely review the uses and effects of shift differentials in an attempt to gain greater insight into the need for shift differentials and the effectiveness of dollar oriented bonuses in the placement and retention of night duty personnel. A study was implemented to survey prevailing administrative attitudes in area hospitals relative to the need for shift differentials, and a second survey of registered nurses in a local hospital was conducted to identify the effect shift differentials have on the recruitment, placement and longevity of night nursing personnel. Study results, although not conclusive, seem to indicate that payment of shift differential is necessary due to the reduced supply of and increasing demand for qualified personnel in the labor market, as well as increased inter-institutional competition for available resources. This was observed even though night nurses ranked dollar oriented incentives secondary to job oriented motivators in the selection of night duty. Based on preliminary study, it was concluded that hospitals should not discontinue use of shift differentials, but should explore alternative incentives that will improve the quality of the job...|$|R
30|$|Combining {{temporary}} in-work {{support with}} a post-employment component {{has turned out}} to be successful with respect to sustainable employment of previous welfare recipients and the long-term unemployed. The Canadian Self Sufficiency Program Plus, a programme for single-parent welfare recipients, found sustained effects with an increased employment rate averaging nearly 7 percentage points 36 – 52 months after randomisation in comparison with a programme that provided financial in-work benefits alone (see Robins et al. 2008 and Dorsett 2014). The UK Employment Retention and Advancement (ERA) programme used a randomized controlled trial—one of largest ever undertaken in Britain—to identify the causal effect. The treatment was a package of financial incentives such as earnings supplements for taking-up a full-time job, an <b>employment</b> retention <b>bonus,</b> tuition assistance for training courses as well as adviser support. The treated long-term unemployed had a 2.2 percentage point higher probability of working five years after randomization than the controls. Furthermore, ERA proved cost-effective for the long-term unemployed from the perspectives of the participants themselves, the Government budget, and society as a whole (see Hendra et al. 2011 and Dorsett 2014). These results give guidance based on hard evidence for the further development of German active labour market policy.|$|R
40|$|Japan has a {{relatively}} unique system of labor compensation. Most Japanese workers are paid large bonuses twice a year. This paper examines the cyclical movement of bonuses compared with wages and {{the relation of}} <b>bonuses</b> to <b>employment</b> {{in the context of}} the Weitzman "share economy. " The paper makes three basic points:(1) The Japanese bonus is much more pro-cyclical than Japanese base wages,but not as cyclically variable as profits. Bonuses can be interpreted as containing a quantitatively significant revenue or profit-sharing component. (2) Bonuses have quite different employment consequences than do base wages. Even after controlling for other economic factors, bonuses are positively related to employment, whereas base wages are negatively related to <b>employment.</b> (3) The <b>bonus</b> system of paying workers, while far from explaining the whole macroeconomic story in Japan, seems to play a role in helping to stabilize Japanese unemployment at comparatively low levels. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{an estimate of}} the costs of reducing employee turnover and {{an estimate of the}} costs of employee turnover in Slovenian companies. The study included all economic ctivities, and in this respect {{it is one of the}} few studies that focus on the complete economy of an individual country. The study estimated two groups of costs; namely, the costs of employee-preferred measures for reducing employee turnover rates in organisations and the average costs of replacing an employee in an organisation. When evaluating the costs of employee-preferred measures we mainly wanted to evaluate the costs of subsidising informal meetings, bonuses for the continuity of <b>employment</b> and <b>bonuses</b> for workplace attendance. Most other measures preferred by employees are of a non-financial nature, except for promotion, which we did not evaluate specifically as it is primarily part of the company‘s employment and job diversity policy. In estimating the costs of employee turnover we focused only on the costs of hiring a new employee: the cost of replacing an employee and the cost of introducing the new employee. Using several assumptions the estimated total cost of employee turnover in Slovenia ranges from € 2. 2 million to € 3. 4 million per year in year 2011. In addition to the estimations of both groups of costs, this paper also provides a comparison of evaluations of selected measures for reducing employee turnover as perceived by employees and employers. We arrived at mportant conclusions, as it turned out that employers give higher ratings to financial measures, while employees give higher ratings to non-financial measures...|$|R
40|$|Knowledge is {{presented}} as the new driving force of competitiveness. It is usually defined as including formal innovation such as R&D and all forms of learning opportunities occurring during economic activities like work and relations with suppliers and customers. Our communication will focus on knowledge, labour markets {{and work in the}} context of Thailand. Thailand is an interesting case because it is representative of second-tier high-growth Asian economies, and most of all, because it is a full-employment economy. This means that if workers are not satisfied with their job, they can easily change their employer. If the company wants to retain them, they have to offer something in exchange: higher wages, bonus, and welfare allowances. This has consequences for the diffusion of knowledge. When workers' mobility is high and employment tenure low, workers are the conduits through which knowledge is transferred across firms, leading to possible increases in productivity. When firms prefer to create an internal labour market in order to retain their workers and accumulate knowledge internally, the diffusion of knowledge relies on linkages between firms and their customers. Our objective is to assess the viability of these scenarios in Thailand. We start with a short analysis of the state of science, technology and education in Thailand (section 1). The conclusion is that formal knowledge is lagging behind and that improvements will take time. The diffusion of knowledge through workers' mobility does not seem viable at this stage and the accumulation of knowledge in internal labour market is a better option. Because internal labour markets involve high employment tenure, we then turn to the analysis of mobility and employment tenure (section 2). The objective is {{to see if there is}} any tendency towards the strengthening of internal labour markets. We use an in-depth field survey realised by the Centre for Education and Labour Studies (Chiang Mai University, Thailand). This is the first nation-wide survey on these topics. A questionnaire has been applied to interview 1543 industrial workers, staff employees and engineers in 85 private and state companies and to 1567 self-employed and 454 employees of the informal sector. Data on education, workers mobility, <b>employment</b> tenure, wages, <b>bonuses</b> and welfare have been collected and are analysed in the paper. The results show that several elements characteristics of internal labour markets are present in big companies with higher than average technological intensity. International comparisons show that average employment tenure in Thailand is intermediate, inferior to the European and Japanese levels but close to the US level, and much higher than in Latin American countries. We conclude that Thailand has the potential to improve its competitiveness by upgrading the level and the quality of education and by strengthening internal labour markets. Competitiveness could be based on the accumulation of knowledge with a positive impact on productivity rather than cheap labour.
