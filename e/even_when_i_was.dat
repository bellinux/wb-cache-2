500|$|After his {{victories}} at the Olympic Games in Sweden, on September 2, 1912, {{he returned}} to Celtic Park, {{the home of the}} Irish American Athletic Club, in Queens, New York (where he had qualified four months earlier for the Olympic Games), to compete in the Amateur Athletic Union's All-Around Championship. Competing against Bruno Brodd of the Irish American Athletic Club and J. Bredemus of Princeton University, he won seven of the ten events contested and came in second in the remaining three. With a total point score of 7,476points, Thorpe broke the previous record of 7,385points set in 1909, (also set at Celtic Park), by Martin Sheridan, the champion athlete of the Irish American Athletic Club. Sheridan, a five-time Olympic gold medalist, was present to watch his record broken, approached Thorpe after the event and shook his hand saying, [...] "Jim, my boy, you're a great man. I never expect to look upon a finer athlete." [...] He told a reporter from New York World, [...] "Thorpe is the greatest athlete that ever lived. He has me beaten fifty ways. <b>Even</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in my prime, I could not do what he did today." ...|$|E
500|$|On 25 June 2007, in an {{unexpected}} turn of events, Henry {{was transferred to}} Barcelona for €24million. He signed a four-year deal for a reported €6.8 (£4.6) million per season. It was revealed that the contract included a release clause of €125 (£84.9) million. Henry cited the departure of Dein and continued uncertainty over Wenger's future as reasons for leaving, and maintained that [...] "I always said that if I ever left Arsenal {{it would be to}} play for Barcelona." [...] Despite their captain's departure, Arsenal got off to an impressive start for the 2007–08 campaign, and Henry admitted that his presence in the team might have been more of a hindrance than a help. He stated, [...] "Because of my seniority, the fact that I was captain and my habit of screaming for the ball, they would sometimes give it to me <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> not in the best position. So in that sense it was good for the team that I moved on." [...] Henry left Arsenal as the club's leading all-time league goalscorer with 174 goals and leading all-time goalscorer in European competitions with 42 goals; in July 2008, Arsenal fans voted him as Arsenal's greatest player ever in Arsenal.com's Gunners' Greatest 50 Players poll.|$|E
2500|$|Wallace {{admitted}} {{she was nervous}} about reprising the role of Kat. Speaking to TVTimes, Wallace said she'd feared she forgot how to play Kat. She commented: [...] "I missed playing Kat," [...] she said. [...] "Now it feels like I've come home. I was nervous at first because I thought I might have forgotten how to play her, {{but as soon as}} I stepped back onto the Square she came back to me. <b>Even</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> out of the show, people called me Kat every day in the street. I was flattered and now I'm having a great time. The recent scripts have been brilliant." ...|$|E

30|$|The {{manager of}} our {{publishing}} house uses his mobile phone to micromanage the book editing process. I frequently receive work-related text messages from him, sometimes <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{having dinner with}} my family. I feel extremely depressed because I no longer enjoy the independence and autonomy that I once had. The manager can reach me, whenever he chooses. What <b>is</b> worse, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> expected to keep my mobile phone on <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> off-duty or on vacation, {{so that he can}} assign me new jobs at any time.|$|R
60|$|I {{did not see}} him {{for several}} days after that, but one <b>evening,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> sitting in the cafe, reading a paper, he came up and sat beside me.|$|R
2500|$|In a January 2014 {{interview}} with New York radio station Hot 97, Schoolboy Q {{talked about the}} album's delay and how Kendrick Lamar's rise has affected him: [...] "It's finally done. He's [...] the reason why I took so long on my album. If {{it was up to}} Interscope, mine would've been out last summer; 2013... But I wanted to perfect my stuff, because I didn't think it was wrapped. I always felt like it was missing three records. <b>Even</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> done with the album, like a lot of these songs that I have on this album was made in 2012. I spent the whole 2013 trying to find four to three records that fit the album, that took my album to that level." [...] During the same interview, Schoolboy Q compared the album to Snoop Dogg's debut album Doggystyle; he also admitted he analyzed Kendrick Lamar's Good Kid, M.A.A.D City album as he crafted his own work: [...] "Yes, I studied Kendrick, because {{he is one of the}} heavy hitters in the game." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "If {{you wish}} it and think me worthy of you, Leonard, {{you know that}} I wish it also. I have always loved you, dear, yes, <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{behaving}} worst to you; but there is--Jane Beach!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There's {{everything}} there but that little silver brooch you gave me, Joseph," [...] she ses, [...] "and I lost {{that the other}} <b>evening</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> out with--with--for a walk." ...|$|R
60|$|That <b>evening</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{lying on}} my bed outside the cave, I heard the tale of Anscombe and Heda. Up {{to a certain point}} he told it, then she went on with the story.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thanks for that. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{sometimes}} troubled {{with the}} thought that I made a mistake in going into the Church, and the doubt troubled me this <b>evening</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in the pulpit--more than it has ever done before." ...|$|R
60|$|I was {{no longer}} happy in Switzerland, not <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> eating great {{blackberries}} and {{looking down at the}} Lago Maggiore, at Locarno, lying by the lake; the terror of the callous, disintegrating process was too strong in me.|$|E
6000|$|... "You know, dearest Wilhelmina," [...] {{the captain}} finally commenced, [...] "that there {{have never been}} any concealments between us, on the score of danger, <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a professed soldier, and might be said to carry my life in my hand." ...|$|E
60|$|But {{there was}} no place in Carleton for me; the only thing to do was to go back east, and I knew that all the time, <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> desperately praying that I might find a way to remain. There's not much comfort, or help either, praying one way and believing another.|$|E
60|$|But one <b>evening</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{passing along}} the Avenue de Clichy {{in front of}} the cafe which Strickland frequented and which I now avoided, I ran {{straight}} into him. He was accompanied by Blanche Stroeve, and they were just going to Strickland's favourite corner.|$|R
6000|$|... "O, I {{shall not}} watch you any, <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> here. <b>I</b> shall pay no {{attention}} to you at all. I can judge to-morrow morning, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> come to look at your work and give you new instructions, whether you have been industrious or not.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is so delightful--especially {{in regard}} to Mr. Meredith and Rosemary," [...] said Anne. [...] "I'm as happy in the thought of it, as <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> getting married myself. I felt exactly like a bride again last <b>evening</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{up on the hill}} seeing Rosemary's trousseau." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And I love you. I had an odd {{content in}} {{being with you}} <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a little, troublesome, disobedient girl; it was charming to me then to lavish on you my naughtiness and whims. Now you are {{acceptable}} to me, and I like to talk with and trust you. So listen, Lucy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{had great}} hopes, <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in prison, and things looked almost {{as bad as}} they could be," [...] Francois said, [...] "that Philip would do {{something}} to help us. I had much faith in his long headedness; and so has the countess, my mother. She said to me, when we started: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Simplicity becomes you," [...] Mrs. Grace acknowledged. [...] "You {{really look}} well without the {{slightest}} effort. I have always been improved by good clothes; <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a girl I shone in the latest styles. I do love up-to-date gowns." [...] She ran a comb through her fluffy pompadour, which should have been silver but was counterfeit gold.|$|E
5000|$|He observes fasting {{during the}} Islamic month of Ramadan. He {{has stated that}} “I can keep fasting in Ramadan <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> playing...it is {{sometimes}} harder to keep the fast because here {{in the south of}} Spain it is very hot, but I can do it, thank God.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Peggotty,' I {{said in a}} {{thoughtful}} whisper, one <b>evening,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> warming my hands at the kitchen fire, 'Mr. Murdstone likes me less than he used to. He never liked me much, Peggotty; but he would rather not even see me now, if he can help it.' ...|$|R
60|$|Hundreds {{of times}} have I seen hanging about {{and above the}} Vale of Rydal, clouds that might have given birth to this Sonnet; which was thrown off, on the impulse of the moment, one <b>evening</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{returning}} home from the favourite walk of ours along the Rotha, under Loughrigg.|$|R
60|$|THE STATUE. Whoever it {{happened}} to be at the time, my dear. I had certain things I always said. One of them was that <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> eighty, one white hair of the woman I loved would make me tremble more than the thickest gold tress from the most beautiful young head. Another was that I could not bear the thought of anyone else being the mother of my children.|$|E
6000|$|... 'No! No drugs; no magic! He {{must love}} me really, {{or not at}} all! He must love me for myself, because I am worth loving, because he honours, worships me, or let me die. I, whose boast was, <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> basest, that I never needed such mean tricks, but conquered like Aphrodite, a queen in my own right! I have been my own love-charm: when I cease to be that, let me die!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you think}} so, uncle? Why, {{it seems to}} me that I know all about you, just the same as if we had always been together, and I am sure I always told you all about myself, <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> bad at school and got into scrapes, because you said {{particularly}} that you liked me to tell you everything, and did not want to know only the good side of me." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I didn't mean to defy you, Béla," [...] she said, striving {{with all}} her might to keep back the rebellious words which surged out of her {{overburdened}} heart to her quivering lips. [...] "I couldn't be unkind to Jenö and Károly, and all my old friends, just this last <b>evening,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> still a girl amongst them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is a shameful, cruel time," [...] {{she cried}} passionately. [...] "My {{mother used to}} tell me of it, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a little girl, and her voice would shake with anger and pity. Francesca, too, would talk to me about you. I prayed for you every <b>evening</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> little, that they might soon set you free again. Oh, it was cruel!" ...|$|R
60|$|We {{have had}} noble good times {{everywhere}} and every day, from Cleveland, July 15, to Pretoria, May 24, and never a dull day either on sea or land, notwithstanding the carbuncles and things. <b>Even</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> laid up 10 days at Jeypore in India {{we had the}} charmingest times with English friends. All over India the English well, you will never know how good and fine they are till you see them.|$|E
6000|$|... "What! {{do you not}} guess why it is generous? Then look at {{yourself}} in the glass, and you will see. I used to have some pretension to good looks, but I could never have stood beside you {{at the best of}} times, and now---- Your mother, <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> at my best, always killed me if I was {{in the same room with}} her, and you are even handsomer than your mother." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You correct me," [...] said Dorothea. [...] "I {{expressed}} myself ill. I {{should have}} said {{that those who have}} great thoughts get too much worn in working them out. I used to feel about that, <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a little girl; and it always seemed to me that the use I should like to make of my life would be to help some one who did great works, so that his burthen might be lighter." ...|$|E
5000|$|Healey started bowling on a fluke. [...] "My {{mother and}} father got me started. Apparently, they went out to bowl one <b>evening</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> about seven years old, and they couldn't get a babysitter. So they just dragged me along. It turned out I {{liked it so much}} that they {{enrolled}} me in a youth league the next year" ...|$|R
60|$|One <b>evening,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> fishing at the inlet, {{the racket}} was {{different}} from any I had heard before. There would be an interval of perfect silence, broken suddenly by wild yelling; then the ordinary loon talk for a few minutes, and another silence, broken by a shriller outcry. That meant that something unusual was going on, so I left the trout, {{to find out about}} it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Surely Captain Montague {{does not}} hold me {{responsible}} for the doings of my men in my absence," [...] said he, calmly. [...] "I have already said {{that they are a}} wild set--not easily restrained <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> present; and fond of getting into scrapes when they can. You see, we have not a choice of men in these out-of-the-way parts of the world." ...|$|R
