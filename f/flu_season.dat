40|$|Timely and {{accurate}} forecasts of seasonal influenza would assist public health decision-makers in planning intervention strategies, efficiently allocating resources, and possibly saving lives. For these reasons, influenza forecasts are consequential. Producing timely {{and accurate}} influenza forecasts, however, have proven challenging due to noisy and limited data, an incomplete {{understanding of the}} disease transmission process, and the mismatch between the disease transmission process and the data-generating process. In this paper, we introduce a dynamic Bayesian (DB) flu forecasting model that exploits model discrepancy through a hierarchical model. The DB model allows forecasts of partially observed <b>flu</b> <b>seasons</b> to borrow discrepancy information from previously observed <b>flu</b> <b>seasons.</b> We compare the DB model to all models that competed in the CDC's 2015 [...] 2016 flu forecasting challenge.

40|$|Background: Seasonal {{influenza}} epidemics place considerable {{strain on}} health services. Robust systems of surveillance are therefore required to ensure preparedness. Sentinel surveillance does not accurately capture the community burden of epidemics as it misses cases {{that do not}} present to health services. In this study, Flusurvey (an internet-based community surveillance tool) {{was used to examine}} how severity of disease influences health-seeking behaviour in the UK. Methods: Logistic regression with random effects was used to investigate the association between health-seeking and symptom severity, duration of illness and reduction in self-reported health-score over four <b>flu</b> <b>seasons</b> between 2011 and 2015. Results: The majority of individuals did not seek care. In general, there was very strong evidence for an association between all severity indicators and visiting a health service (p < 0. 0001). Being female (OR 1. 62, 95 % CI 1. 23 – 2. 14, p = 0. 0003) and a self-diagnosis of the flu (OR 3. 39, 95 % CI 2. 38 – 4. 83, p < 0. 0001) were also associated with increased likelihood of visiting a health service. During the 2012 – 13 and 2014 – 15 <b>flu</b> <b>seasons,</b> there was a significantly larger proportion of individuals with more severe sets of symptoms and a longer duration of illness. Despite this, the proportion of individuals with particular sets of symptoms visiting a health service showed only very slight variation across years. Conclusions: Traditional surveillance systems capture only the more severe episodes of illness. However, in spite of variation in flu activity, the proportion of individuals visiting a health service remains relatively stable within specific sets of symptoms across years. These data could be used in combination with data on consultation rates to provide better estimates of community burden...|$|R
25|$|The 2009 Swine Flu {{epidemic}} struck Mexico and {{was labeled}} a pandemic by the World Health Organization. The administration {{declared a state}} of emergency and acted firmly in giving open information to the world about the swine flu epidemic, and it acted with tough measures to contain its spread by shutting down many public services including schools. President Calderón appeared on television explaining the situation and demonstrating basic precautionary measures to take during the epidemic such as coughing into one's elbow rather than into the air. Tamiflu and vaccines were used in 2009 and in 2010 during <b>flu</b> <b>season,</b> and some deaths were undoubtedly prevented by the strong measures that were taken as well as due to a reduction in the spread and severity of the disease. Policies keeping people home and awareness of effective strategies may have helped prevent virulent forms of the virus from spreading as easily as minor forms that were harder to detect and identify. Criticism of Calderón's handling varied from early claims that his administration was not doing enough to later claims that the administration had exaggerated the measures that it had taken.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Intensive care {{support of}} {{patients}} with severe respiratory failure has improved over recent years and with improved methods of ventilation fewer of these patients now die. However despite these improvements, {{a significant number of}} patients still die with acute respiratory failure. The outbreak of pandemic (H 1 N 1) 2009 influenza presented NSW intensive care units with many critically ill patients with severe acute respiratory failure. Three case studies and summary data illustrate the impact of these patients on intensive care units services in Australia and New Zealand. The day-to-day of a busy intensive care unit (ICU) is complex and challenging; new admissions, long-stay patients and bureaucratic considerations all demand attention. The mind is focused, however, when faced with something new. Pandemic (H 1 N 1) 2009 influenza was something new. Almost over one weekend in June 2009, 1 ICUs in New South Wales (NSW) were faced with a set of patients suffering a form of acute severe hypoxemic respiratory failure that appeared significantly worse than in previous <b>flu</b> <b>seasons.</b> In addition unlike other <b>flu</b> <b>seasons,</b> ‘a third of our patients were young or middle-aged adults who neither were pregnant nor had a known coexisting condition’. 1 The severity of the respiratory failure resulted in the author’s hospital (Royal Prince Alfred Hospital [RPAH]), a tertiary referral hospital in NSW, receiving referrals for extra corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). ECMO is a method of providing oxygen and removing carbon dioxide in patients whose lungs are so damaged that standard mechanical ventilation is insufficient. It requires the insertion of large intravenous catheters, and the circulation of the patient’s blood through a pump to an artificial lung. With the development of new equipment, ECMO (which was previously only offered by large tertiary hospitals) can now be initiated by specialist teams in smaller facilities prior to transferring the patient to a tertiary centre for ongoing management. With this improved method of ventilation, fewer of these patients now die. 2 In NSW, RPAH...|$|R

50|$|As {{influenza}} {{is caused}} by a variety of species and strains of viruses, in any given year some strains can die out while others create epidemics, while yet another strain can cause a pandemic. Typically, in a year's normal two <b>flu</b> <b>seasons</b> (one per hemisphere), there are between three and five million cases of severe illness and around 500,000 deaths worldwide, which by some definitions is a yearly influenza epidemic. Although the incidence of influenza can vary widely between years, approximately 36,000 deaths and more than 200,000 hospitalizations are directly associated with influenza every year in the United States. One method of calculating influenza mortality produced an estimate of 41,400 average deaths per year in the United States between 1979 and 2001. Different methods in 2010 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported a range from a low of about 3,300 deaths to a high of 49,000 per year.|$|R
40|$|The M 2 protein {{from the}} {{influenza}} A virus, an acid-activated proton-selective channel, {{has been the}} subject of numerous conductance, structural, and computational studies. However, little is known at the atomic level about the heart of the functional mechanism for this tetrameric protein, a His 37 -Trp 41 cluster. We report the structure of the M 2 conductance domain (residues 22 to 62) in a lipid bilayer, which displays the defining features of the native protein that have not been attainable from structures solubilized by detergents. We propose that the tetrameric His 37 -Trp 41 cluster guides protons through the channel by forming and breaking hydrogen bonds between adjacent pairs of histidines and through specific interactions of the histidines with the tryptophan gate. This mechanism explains the main observations on M 2 proton conductance. Proton conductance by theM 2 protein (with 97 residues permonomer) in influenzaA isessential for viral replication (1). An M 2 mutation, Ser 31 →Asn, in recent <b>flu</b> <b>seasons</b> and in the recent H 1 N 1 swine flu pandemic renders the viruses resistant to antiviral drugs, amanta-dine and rimantadine (2).

40|$|Kingman's coalescent process {{opens the}} door for {{estimation}} of population genetics model parameters from molecular sequences. One paramount parameter of interest is the effective population size. Temporal variation of this quantity characterizes the demographic history of a population. Because researchers are rarely able to choose a priori a deterministic model describing effective population size dynamics for data at hand, nonparametric curve-fitting methods based on multiple change-point (MCP) models have been developed. We propose an alternative to change-point modeling that exploits Gaussian Markov random fields to achieve temporal smoothing of the effective population size in a Bayesian framework. The main advantage of our approach is that, in contrast to MCP models, the explicit temporal smoothing does not require strong prior decisions. To approximate the posterior distribution of the population dynamics, we use efficient, fast mixing Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms designed for highly structured Gaussian models. In a simulation study, we demonstrate that the proposed temporal smoothing method, named Bayesian skyride, successfully recovers “true” population size trajectories in all simulation scenarios and competes well with the MCP approaches without evoking strong prior assumptions. We apply our Bayesian skyride method to 2 real data sets.
