5|$|In 1972, paleontologists Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould {{published}} a landmark paper developing their theory {{and called it}} punctuated equilibria. Their paper built upon Ernst Mayr's model of geographic speciation, I. Michael Lerner's theories of developmental and genetic homeostasis, and their own empirical research. Eldredge and Gould proposed {{that the degree of}} gradualism commonly attributed to Charles Darwin <b>is</b> <b>virtually</b> nonexistent in the fossil record, and that stasis dominates the history of most fossil species.|$|E

5|$|The {{etymology}} of Buffalo Creek's name is unknown. In the 1700s, {{it was one}} {{of eight}} streams named Buffalo Creek in Pennsylvania, despite the almost total absence of buffalo in the state in that century. Except for legends, there <b>is</b> <b>virtually</b> no evidence that any buffalo ever lived in the Buffalo Creek area. However, some residents of the nearby village of Cowan claim that depressions on the northern bank of Buffalo Creek are buffalo wallows.|$|E

5|$|Ammianus {{is silent}} about archers on the Alamanni side. The Germans almost {{certainly}} did not have mounted archers, as this was an arm that evolved in the East and in any case, their longbows are unsuitable for use on horseback. As for the infantry, the archery capability of the Rhine Germans has traditionally been seen as negligible, due to the 6th-century writer Agathias's comment that the Franks {{did not know how}} to use bows. But this is contradicted by the archaeological record and by Ammianus himself in other parts of his account. It <b>is</b> <b>virtually</b> certain that there were a significant number of Alamanni foot archers at Strasbourg.|$|E
5|$|Carbon-14 (C) is a {{naturally}} occurring radioisotope, {{created in the}} upper atmosphere (lower stratosphere and upper troposphere) by interaction of nitrogen with cosmic rays. It is found in trace amounts on Earth of up to 1 part per trillion (0.0000000001%), mostly confined to the atmosphere and superficial deposits, particularly of peat and other organic materials. This isotope decays by 0.158MeV β emission. Because of its relatively short half-life of 5730years, C <b>is</b> <b>virtually</b> absent in ancient rocks. The amount of C in the atmosphere and in living organisms is almost constant, but decreases predictably in their bodies after death. This principle is used in radiocarbon dating, invented in 1949, which has been used extensively to determine the age of carbonaceous materials with ages up to about 40,000years.|$|E

5|$|In 1974, DARPA {{secretly}} requested {{answers from}} five aircraft manufacturers regarding two considerations. The first {{was about the}} signature thresholds at which an aircraft <b>is</b> <b>virtually</b> undetectable. The second point was whether these companies {{had the capacity to}} design and manufacture such an aircraft. Fairchild and Grumman declined to participate, while General Dynamics insisted on the use of electronic countermeasures. As a result, General Dynamics left the discussion. The remaining two companies, McDonnell Douglas and Northrop, were each awarded $100,000 for further research.|$|E
5|$|Niobium is {{slightly}} less electropositive and more compact {{than its predecessor}} in the periodic table, zirconium, whereas it <b>is</b> <b>virtually</b> identical in size to the heavier tantalum atoms, {{as a result of}} the lanthanide contraction. As a result, niobium's chemical properties are very similar to those for tantalum, which appears directly below niobium in the periodic table. Although its corrosion resistance is not as outstanding as that of tantalum, the lower price and greater availability make niobium attractive for less demanding applications, such as vat linings in chemical plants.|$|E

A key element in making ransomware work for the attacker is a convenient payment system that is hard to trace. A range of such payment methods have been used, including wire transfers, premium-rate text messages, pre-paid voucher services such as Paysafecard, and the digital currency Bitcoin. A 2016 survey commissioned by Citrix claimed that larger businesses are holding bitcoin as contingency plans.|$|E
