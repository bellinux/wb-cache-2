500|$|Immediately {{after the}} reports were released, several writers {{said that the}} NBA's {{popularity}} would be hurt by the news. Chris Sheridan of ESPN said that [...] "the general American public has been turning away {{since the end of}} the Bulls' dynasty, and this fiasco isn't going to help bring it back", and J. A. Adande said that [...] "the integrity of the games <b>just</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> major hit".|$|E
500|$|During the quarterfinal {{match against}} Brazil, Rapinoe came on as a {{substitute}} and served the precise cross to Abby Wambach's equalizer goal in the 122nd minute of the game: a goal that holds the record for latest goal ever scored in a World Cup match. Rapinoe would later convert her shot during the penalty shootout to help send the United States to the semifinals. Rapinoe described her last minute cross against Brazil: [...] "I <b>just</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> touch and friggin' smacked it with my left foot. I don't think I've hit a ball like that with my left foot. I got it to the back post and that beast in the air just got a hold of it." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Glamour in 2008, Goldstein said that while he had been sober for nine years, he had to remind himself every day {{that he was still}} a drug addict, saying: [...] "At any given moment, I'm five seconds away from walking up to someone, grabbing their drink out of their hand and downing it. And if I do that, within a week, tops, I'll be smoking crack." [...] Following the plane crash, Goldstein was prescribed painkillers and anti-anxiety medication. Celebrity doctor Drew Pinsky said it was those prescriptions which opened the [...] "floodgates" [...] to Goldstein's relapse. A friend of his reached the same conclusion, saying: [...] "I think the plane crash killed him, it <b>just</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> year for it to do it." [...] As a result of the plane crash, Goldstein developed a fear of flying, and continued consuming anxiety medication to help deal with the regular flights his lifestyle required.|$|E

2500|$|The {{cause was}} {{diagnosed}} as a ruptured blood vessel in his throat, which was successfully sealed off using a laser by Dr. Steven M. Zeitels, director of the Massachusetts General Hospital Center for Laryngeal Surgery and Voice Rehabilitation. In the words of Tyler: [...] "He <b>just</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> laser and zapped the blood vessel." [...] After {{a few weeks of}} rest, Tyler and the rest of Aerosmith entered the studio on May 20, 2006, to begin work on their new album.|$|E
2500|$|In a 1995 {{interview}} with Rolling Stone, Jagger said, [...] "I {{think that was}} taken from an old idea of Baudelaire's, I think, but I could be wrong. Sometimes when I look at my Baudelaire books, I can't see it in there. But it was an idea I got from French writing. And I <b>just</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> couple of lines and expanded on it. I wrote it as {{sort of like a}} Bob Dylan song." [...] It was Richards who suggested changing the tempo and using additional [...] percussion, turning the folk song into a samba.|$|E
2500|$|In Davidson's first {{autobiography}} The Full Monty (1993), {{he talked}} about his violent and abusive behaviour towards his wife in a light-hearted manner: [...] "We’re like a couple of boxers. On the first occasion, I poked her in the eye by accident. I actually went for the mouth. Thank heaven I missed, I’d have fallen in. I <b>just</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> playful punch. Unfortunately I caught her completely wrong. The second time I gave her a shiner. I threw a bunch of keys which whacked her in the eye. Just for a giggle she kept blackening it up to make it look worse." ...|$|E

2500|$|Sea Change {{is based}} around a musical suite of reflective, acoustic-based songs that {{showcase}} Beck's singer-songwriter side. The term sea change {{is defined as}} a broad transformation, which reflects the departure in style from both Beck's previous effort Midnite Vultures and previous, sample-based recordings, as well as Beck's desire to give each album an identity. Origins for the album's unique, passionate sound had been building up for years, according to Beck in a 2002 interview: [...] "There are threads of what I've done before. If you listen to my earlier B- sides, you'll hear this record. I have been wanting to make this record for years," [...] he explained. [...] "I've been edging towards the idea, and so it <b>just</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> while." [...] Despite initial difficulty upon deciding on the name, the title originates from [...] "Little One", the eleventh track on the album: [...] "Drown, drown / Sailors run aground / In a sea change nothing is safe".|$|E
2500|$|Dettori {{sent the}} colt into the lead {{soon after the}} start and set the pace from Highland Reel, Pleascach, Free Eagle and Found. Two furlongs from the finish Free Eagle made a forward move but as he {{challenged}} the favourite, Golden Horn veered to the right, hampering his challenger. Golden Horn kept on well in the closing stages to win by a length from Found, who stayed on to deprive Free Eagle of second. Following an inquiry by the racecourse stewards the result was allowed to stand. Dettori said [...] "It was a stellar field and he was showing what a good horse he is. Pat [...] came to me then I gave {{him a couple of}} cracks and I got the measure of him and I thought, right, come on, let’s go home. All of a sudden, he <b>just</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> right turn. He must have seen something". Gosden offered the view that the horse had swerved because of the shadow cast across the course by the grandstand.|$|E
2500|$|... "For the record, {{we never}} broke up, we <b>just</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> 14-year vacation," [...] {{announced}} Henley {{at their first}} live performance in April 1994. The ensuing tour spawned a live album titled Hell Freezes Over (named for Henley's recurring statement that the group would get back together [...] "when hell freezes over"), which debuted at number 1 on the Billboard album chart. It included four new studio songs, with [...] "Get Over It" [...] and [...] "Love Will Keep Us Alive" [...] both becoming Top 40 hits. The album proved as successful as the tour, selling six million copies in the U.S. The tour was interrupted in September 1994 because of Frey's serious recurrence of diverticulitis, but it resumed in 1995 and continued into 1996. In 1998, the Eagles were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. For the induction ceremony, all seven Eagles members (Frey, Henley, Felder, Walsh, Schmit, Leadon, and Meisner) played together for two songs, [...] "Take It Easy" [...] and [...] "Hotel California." [...] Several subsequent reunion tours followed (without Leadon or Meisner), notable for their record-setting ticket prices.|$|E

2500|$|On April 1, 2007, Morissette {{released}} a tongue-in-cheek cover of The Black Eyed Peas's selection [...] "My Humps", which she recorded in a slow, mournful voice, accompanied {{only by a}} piano. The accompanying YouTube-hosted video, in which she dances provocatively {{with a group of}} men and hits the ones who attempt to touch her [...] "lady lumps", had received 16,465,653 views on February 15, 2009. Morissette did not take any interviews for a time to explain the song, and it was theorized that she did it as an April Fools' Day joke. Black Eyed Peas vocalist Stacy [...] "Fergie" [...] Ferguson responded by sending Morissette a buttocks-shaped cake with an approving note. On the verge of the release of her latest album, she finally elaborated on how the video came to be, citing that she became very much emotionally loaded while recording her new songs one after the other and one day she wished she could do a simple song like [...] "My Humps" [...] in a conversation with Guy Sigsworth and the joke <b>just</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> life of its own when they started working on it.|$|E
