5|$|At the Sahar International Airport in Mumbai, India, an obese American {{businessman}} dismissively {{makes his}} way past a paraplegic beggar. Later, while using the airport's toilet, the businessman <b>is</b> <b>pulled</b> out of the stall violently by the beggar that he passed earlier. Later, the businessman checks into a Washington, D.C. hotel and sits down on his bed. Soon, blood streams out of his bodily orifices.|$|E
5|$|At the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, Homer sneaks out of {{work early}} and accompanies Barney {{on a tour of}} the Duff brewery. After the tour, Homer refuses to let the {{extremely}} drunk Barney drive home and forces him to hand over his keys. On their way out of the parking lot, their car <b>is</b> <b>pulled</b> over by police Chief Wiggum, along with Eddie and Lou. They administer a breathalyser test to Homer, which he fails. He is arrested, his license is revoked, and he must attend traffic school and Alcoholics Anonymous meetings.|$|E
5|$|In Lansdale, Pennsylvania, {{a highway}} {{construction}} worker hears an odd noise in a cornfield, and <b>is</b> <b>pulled</b> down into an underground tunnel by a mysterious, unidentified creature. Using a lighter for sight, {{he sees the}} remains of other creatures, and is then eaten by the creature off screen. Meanwhile, Walter (John Noble) investigates Olivia's (Anna Torv) car crash from the previous episode. He believes she traveled to a parallel universe {{that is similar to}} theirs, but she still cannot remember with whom she met with, or why.|$|E

50|$|For {{most of the}} museum's history, {{nearly all}} trains <b>were</b> <b>pulled</b> by steam {{locomotives}} although since February 2000, all trains have <b>been</b> <b>pulled</b> by diesel-electric locomotives pending the restoration or repair of the museum's steam locomotives.|$|R
50|$|Another {{noteworthy}} event {{occurred in}} November 1965, when, {{for the last}} time, the North train <b>was</b> <b>pulled</b> by a steam engine. It was the last passenger train in the North Island to <b>be</b> <b>pulled</b> by a steam locomotive.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to normal flight controls, the Harrier has a lever for controlling {{the direction of}} the four vectoring nozzles. It is viewed by senior RAF officers as a significant design success, that to enable and control the aircraft's vertical flight required only a single lever added in the cockpit. For horizontal flight, the nozzles are directed rearwards by shifting the lever to the forward position; for short or vertical takeoffs and landings, the lever <b>is</b> <b>pulled</b> back to point the nozzles downwards.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to carbon fiber, glass can undergo more elongation before it breaks. Thinner filaments can bend further before they break. The viscosity of the molten glass {{is very important}} for manufacturing success. During drawing, the process where the hot glass <b>is</b> <b>pulled</b> to reduce the diameter of the fiber, the viscosity must be relatively low. If it is too high, the fiber will break during drawing. However, if it is too low, the glass will form droplets instead of being drawn out into a fiber.|$|E
5|$|Reptilian lungs {{typically}} receive air via {{expansion and}} contraction of the ribs driven by axial muscles and buccal pumping. Crocodilians also {{rely on the}} hepatic piston method, in which the liver <b>is</b> <b>pulled</b> back by a muscle anchored to the pubic bone (part of the pelvis) called the diaphragmaticus, which in turn creates negative pressure in the crocodile's thoracic cavity, allowing air to be moved into the lungs by Boyle's law. Turtles, which are unable to move their ribs, instead use their forelimbs and pectoral girdle to force air {{in and out of}} the lungs.|$|E
25|$|Iver Johnson made {{an unusual}} model from 1940 to 1947, called the Trigger Cocking Double Action. If the hammer <b>was</b> down, <b>pulling</b> the trigger would cock the hammer. If the trigger <b>was</b> <b>pulled</b> with the hammer cocked, it would then fire. This meant that {{to fire the}} {{revolver}} from a hammer down state, the trigger must <b>be</b> <b>pulled</b> twice.|$|R
50|$|In 1974, Hurricanes Kirsten and Ione interacted in a Fujiwara interaction, as Ione <b>was</b> <b>pulled</b> north east, while Kirsten <b>was</b> <b>pulled</b> to {{the north}} west. In the same year,Francesca and Gretchen interacted with each other, until they merged on July 19.|$|R
50|$|Tom Savage {{started at}} {{quarterback for the}} Texans, but <b>was</b> <b>pulled</b> from {{the game in the}} 1st quarter due to a {{possible}} concussion. After Savage <b>was</b> <b>pulled,</b> Brock Osweiler, who had been benched 2 weeks prior, came in as quarterback.|$|R
5|$|The FBI {{task force}} rush {{to locate the}} bomb, tracing the phonecall to a small {{section of the city}} that might house it. Scanning the area, Black notices another parking garage {{opposite}} an office block, and attempts to have the building evacuated. However, Dees has planted a second bomb which detonates fifteen minutes early, while Black is inside the building. However, he <b>is</b> <b>pulled</b> to safety by a stranger, who is interviewed on the news following the explosion—Raymond Dees.|$|E
5|$|The {{cohesive}} forces among liquid molecules {{are responsible}} for the phenomenon of surface tension. In the bulk of the liquid, each molecule <b>is</b> <b>pulled</b> equally in every direction by neighboring liquid molecules, resulting in a net force of zero. The molecules at the surface {{do not have the same}} molecules on all sides of them and therefore are pulled inwards. This creates some internal pressure and forces liquid surfaces to contract to the minimal area.|$|E
5|$|The {{flashback}} ends, and Desmond <b>is</b> <b>pulled</b> off Charlie by Hurley. They help Desmond to his tent. Charlie {{tries to}} get an answer from him one last time. Desmond reveals that both times he rescued Claire, he was really saving Charlie; Charlie would have been electrocuted, and Charlie would have drowned attempting to save Claire from the ocean. Desmond tells Charlie that although he has prevented his death twice, Charlie is destined to die.|$|E
5000|$|Event 4 - Hang Tough:Mandy was {{up against}} Jet and <b>was</b> <b>pulled</b> down14.7 seconds in scoring herself no points while Janet {{was up against}} Lightning and was cut down 20.7 seconds in scoring herself no points. Regan was up against Wolf and <b>was</b> <b>pulled</b> off {{eighteen}} seconds in scoring himself no points while Mark was up against Cobra and almost made it across but <b>was</b> <b>pulled</b> down with 23.4 seconds to go scoring himself no points.|$|R
50|$|The {{contraction}} of these adductor/extensor muscles can indirectly depress and downwardly rotate the scapulae; {{this is only}} required when they <b>are</b> <b>pulled</b> into elevation and upward rotation by the {{contraction of}} muscles that attach to the scapulae. If the weight <b>were</b> being <b>pulled</b> solely by the lats, for example, the scapulae would simply <b>be</b> <b>pulled</b> down by gravity, along for the ride.|$|R

5|$|The {{simplest}} case {{of static}} equilibrium occurs when two forces are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. For example, an object {{on a level}} surface <b>is</b> <b>pulled</b> (attracted) downward {{toward the center of}} the Earth by the force of gravity. At the same time, a force is applied by the surface that resists the downward force with equal upward force (called a normal force). The situation produces zero net force and hence no acceleration.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the episode}} itself was penned by Jeremy Carver, the writing staff contributed their {{ideas to the}} storyline. Within five minutes of brainstorming, they envisioned three scenes they had to do: the teaser, where a {{grandfather}} pretending to be Santa <b>is</b> <b>pulled</b> up the chimney and slaughtered; a boy witnessing the Santa-dressed villain brutally killing his father and then eating one of the cookies for Santa; and the Winchesters killing someone with a Christmas tree.|$|E
5|$|A seventeen-year-old girl, Lisa Donovan (Alice Kremelberg), is {{declared}} brain dead at {{a hospital}} and <b>is</b> <b>pulled</b> off life support. While the doctors remove her organs for donation, she suddenly comes {{back from the dead}} and yells highly classified naval missile codes. Fringe Division arrives to investigate, along with a naval officer; he tells them the codes are tied to a missing sailor called Andrew Rusk (Chazz Menendez). Lisa is unaware of the numbers or Rusk, but suddenly starts speaking Russian while Olivia (Anna Torv), Peter (Joshua Jackson), and Walter (John Noble) question her. The naval officer informs them that Rusk is fluent in the language.|$|E

5000|$|Event 5 - Hang Tough:Mel was {{up against}} Zodiac and <b>was</b> <b>pulled</b> down with twelve seconds to go scoring herself no points while Mandy {{was up against}} Jet and <b>was</b> <b>pulled</b> down with fifteen seconds to go scoring herself no points. John was up against Hunter and <b>was</b> <b>pulled</b> down with forty seconds to go scoring himself no points while Mark was up against Wolf and got across the other podium with over forty seconds to go scoring himself ten points.|$|R
5|$|After {{they started}} to break apart, further orders were placed for {{additional}} suits and all the suits used eventually fell apart during the four days they were used on set. In order to film one scene, McChesney wore the suit open-backed due to the damage. No optical effects were used in creating Armus. For the scene where Riker <b>is</b> <b>pulled</b> into the oil, a stuntman {{was used as a}} stand in for Jonathan Frakes. Where Riker's face emerges from the oil, it was actually a plaster cast of Frakes' face painted black. It was placed on the same grate used to lift McChesney, and filmed lifting out of the liquid. The twitching effect in Yar's death was due to a wire tied around Crosby's waist being pulled on.|$|E
5|$|Brody visits Kristin and Stacie as they {{pack the}} last of her {{belongings}} before leaving for the airport. After giving their final goodbyes, Brody sees Kristin's limousine off while it drives off her street. As Kristin looks out of the window, a montage of archived footage from the series' earlier seasons is shown. In the final scene of the series, with the camera on Brody, the Hollywood Hills backdrop <b>is</b> <b>pulled</b> away, while the camera pans back to reveal that the entire scene was filmed on a backlot. In reality, the vehicle had not driven off and Kristin stepped out of the vehicle to hug Jenner.|$|E
5|$|Chip Diller {{gets into}} a fight with the other Pi Sigs, and Veronica gets involved. However, Veronica <b>is</b> <b>pulled</b> away by a {{security}} guard hired by Logan. Veronica is angry with Logan about this, but they eventually reconcile and say “I love you” to each other. Sheriff Lamb arrests Mr. Rose when Selma {{is found in the}} guesthouse, and Selma forces Mr. Rose to give her a favorable settlement. Selma decides to dissolve the Greek system. Veronica discusses the girl who fell off the roof, and she attempted suicide when the Pi Sigs mistreated her. Veronica states her belief that the Lilith House girls faked more than one rape, and Logan becomes distraught when he sees Veronica decline his phone call.|$|E
50|$|In 2008, Tropical Cyclone Fame began {{orbiting}} Tropical Cyclone Gula {{with the}} stronger storm, Gula, absorbing Fame.
