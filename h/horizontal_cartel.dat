50|$|A <b>horizontal</b> <b>cartel</b> among {{competing}} manufacturers or competing retailers that decreases output or reduces {{competition in}} order to increase price is, and ought to be, per se unlawful. To the extent a vertical agreement setting minimum resale prices is entered upon to facilitate either type of cartel, it, too, would need to be held unlawful under the rule of reason. This type of agreement may also be useful evidence for a plaintiff attempting to prove the existence of a <b>horizontal</b> <b>cartel.</b>|$|E
50|$|Furthermore, when field-of-use {{licensing}} is used {{to create}} a <b>horizontal</b> <b>cartel</b> by which product markets are allocated among what would otherwise be competitive licensees, the General Talking Pictures doctrine does not shield the arrangement from the antitrust laws. In Hartford-Empire Co. v. United States, such a cartel based on patents was condemned as an antitrust violation. In United States v. Ciba Geigy Corp., the court found an antitrust violation as to patent licenses that restricted use of purchased drug chemicals but no violation as to licenses that limited the use of the same chemicals by licensees manufacturing them.|$|E

Telser, {{an economist at the}} University of Chicago, argued that manufacturers could employ minimum resale price maintenance as a tool to ensure that dealers engaged in the desired promotion of a manufacturer's product through local advertising, product demonstrations, and the like. Without such contractual restraints, Telser said, no frills distributors might [...] "free ride" [...] on the promotional efforts of full service distributors, thereby undermining the incentives of full service dealers to expend resources on promotion.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. We use {{data from}} Norwegian <b>horizontal</b> <b>cartels</b> to {{estimate}} the probability of starting a cartel and the average duration of the cartels. We relate this probability {{to the number of}} firms in the cartel, in order to investigate the hypothesis that fewer firms make cartel creation more likely and cartel duration longer. We find that that the number of firms have a great impact on probability of cartel formation and the duration of cartels. This suggests that market characteristics are important when predicting the probability of an illegal cartel occurring...|$|R
40|$|Cartels {{were legal}} {{to a large}} extent in Austria until the country's EU {{accession}} in 1995. We examine archival material on registered <b>horizontal</b> <b>cartels</b> to learn about their inner working. Applying content analysis to legally binding cartel contracts, we comprehensively document different collusion methods along the lines described by Stigler (1964). Quota cartels employ regular reporting schemes and use compensation mechanisms for departures from set quotas. Specialisation cartels divide markets and rely the least on information exchange and punishment. Price and payment condition cartels primarily aim to prevent secret price cuts, requiring information provision upon request, allow for discretionary decision-taking and (sometimes immediate) punishment. These stylised facts on the contractual arrangements suggest that the possibility to write legally binding agreements was employed to address the usual obstacles to sustaining collusion...|$|R
5000|$|In Business Electronics Corp. v.

[...] The Court explained that some economic effect must be shown to depart from a rule-of-reason analysis: [...] "There is a presumption {{in favor of a}} rule-of-reason standard; and departure from that standard must be justified by demonstrable economic effect, such as the facilitation of cartelizing[...] [...] [...]" [...] A large part of the rationale of the holding of a Sherman Act violation in Parke Davis is that Parke Davis organized a <b>horizontal</b> <b>cartel</b> agreement among its direct customers to fix prices.|$|E
40|$|The {{anti-competitive}} {{agreements are}} collusions concerning certain cooperation among undertakings. However, despite European Commission´s long-standing efforts, the prohibited ones are nowadays still present on markets in a large extent as well. This thesis characterizes both {{vertical and horizontal}} agreements, including their positive and negative effects. Since the negative impacts usually prevail in the <b>horizontal</b> (<b>cartel)</b> agreements, the related legislation {{under the terms of}} EU competition law is described including the conditions, under which these agreements can be approved (particularly the article 101 (3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, block exemptions and de minimis notice). In order to get access to the otherwise unobtainable evidence about their existence, the leniency program exists since 1996. Its European adaptation is compared to the version adopted in the Czech Republic and in the USA. The legal and economic effectiveness of this tool is analysed. Settlement procedure and prioritization are characterized as well, since they allow both the undertakings and the competition authorities to reduce their costs connected with the proceeding...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Although the 1996 ‘Notice on the non-imposition or {{reduction}} of fines in cartel cases ’ has been criticised by academics as lacking clarity and certainty, {{it has been}} described in European Commission literature as an ‘indisputable success ’ and as having played an ‘instrumental role ’ in uncovering and punishing secret cartels. This paper makes an empirical assessment of <b>horizontal</b> <b>cartel</b> cases in the EC opened {{as a result of}} leniency applications under the 1996 notice. Nearly three quarters of the cartels apparently uncovered by this notice were subject to equivalent prior or simultaneous investigations in the U. S. In addition, most of the cartels that were revealed operated in the Chemical industry, were all connected to each other by virtue of the same firms ’ involvement in more than one cartel, and all failed or ceased to operate before being revealed to the Commission by a cartel member. These two findings would suggest that the 1996 leniency notice was only of limited success in inducing firms to reveal cartels and that most applications for immunity were as a natural consequence of cartels failing and firms looking once more to their own interests rather than those of the cartel. The leniency notice largely succeeded in uncovering failed cartels, not active ones...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper offers}} a new and broad insight into the {{landscape}} of German cartels, utilizing a unique dataset of all illegal <b>horizontal</b> <b>cartels</b> detected by the German Federal Cartel Office (FCO) between 1958 and 2004 and all legal cartels authorized {{during the same time}} period. We also provide the first comparison of legal and illegal cartels in Germany. Legal cartels tend to last longer and to have more members than illegal cartels, while there are little differences with respect to the industries involved. The construction industries are the most cartelized sectors in Germany (29. 8 % of all legal cartels, 43. 2 % of all illegal cartels) followed by manufacture of metals and machinery (21. 9 % of all legal cartels, 30. 6 % of all illegal cartels). How the number of cartel members affects the duration of cartels is ambiguous. Cartels with no more than 12 members tend to last longer than cartels with more than 12 members. However, cartels with 5 to 12 members also tend to last longer than cartels with less than 5 members. [...] ...|$|R

40|$|This essay {{focuses on}} the {{jurisdictional}} problems related to global <b>horizontal</b> <b>cartels,</b> comparing the jurisdictional treatment of antitrust actions for damages brought by vitamins purchasers in U. S. A. and in Europe. While the U. S. Supreme Court has recently narrowed the scope for “foreign-to-foreign” claims in the antitrust field, a prime opportunity of forum shopping seems to be still open in Europe – specially when transnational groups of undertakings are involved – relying on Art. 6. 1 of EC Regulation N. 44 / 2001. An interesting decisions of the U. K. High Court allows a German firm that has purchased goods in Germany from an indirect subsidiary of the parent company fined by the EC Commission to sue that subsidiary in the U. K., relying on the link between this claim and the claim for damages brought – by the same plaintiff – against another subsidiary domiciled in the U. K., notwithstanding {{the absence of any}} purchase from the U. K. defendant. The Author argues that the enforcement of Art. 6. 1 in the situation sketched above could lead to inappropriate multiplication of forums and should therefore not be granted de plano. In order to avoid the risk of abuse of process it is suggested that consolidation of claims should be possible only in the State of the domicile of the main responsible of the infringement or of the firm from which the goods were purchased at inflated prices. The Author then critically addresses the latest developments in the E. C. J. case law on Art. 6. 1, remarking the importance of a scrutiny of the strength of the primary claim, in order to prevent the use of the proviso with the sole object of removing a defendant from his proper forum...|$|R
40|$|The {{main goal}} of this {{manuscript}} is to explore the retailer conduct in the milk market in a U. S. Midwestern city, based upon a structural estimation of consumer milk demand and retailer optimality conditions. To model milk demand we rely upon the Almost Ideal Demand System, while allowing the retailer optimality conditions to cover a range of competitive scenarios from perfect competition to <b>horizontal</b> <b>cartel.</b> We employ a conjectural variation approach {{in the spirit of}} Newly Empirical Industrial Organization to study the competitive environment on the retail landscape. We find that the retail market in question is far from being competitive, with the two major retailers being engaged in an oligopolistic competition. Furthermore, the private label milk seems an important tool for some big players to extract rents from their competitors. The current study offers an idea of the competitive atmosphere in the retail sector of food marketing system.

40|$|Inspired by some newly emerged topics {{from the}} real world, this thesis {{comprises}} of four essays that study firms’ strategic incentives, {{as well as the}} vertical and horizontal agreements between firms. The first essay assesses theoretically firms’ incentives to engage in quality proliferation. We show that it is possible for vertical proliferation to be completely undesirable in the absence of entry threats, therefore proliferation of any level might be anticompetitive. Nevertheless, when proliferation is optimally conducted, it always benefits consumers. The second and third essays focus on vertical contracts between successive stages of production. The second essay places the controversial agency model involved in the e-book case in the context of antitrust treatment to vertical restraints, and examines its effects on competition and welfare relative to the wholesale model. The third essay goes beyond and develops a framework allowing us to clarify the ceteris paribus effects of changing each of the two key elements written in a vertical contract: decision roles and forms of the transfer payment. Based on this framework, we show that it is meaningful to distinguish between classic RRM, by which a manufacturer sets the transfer payment as well as the retail price, and agency RPM, by which a retailer is able to set the transfer payment before a manufacturer set the retail price. The final essay focuses on <b>horizontal</b> <b>cartel</b> agreements and experimentally investigates the effects of endogenous enforcement on cartel prices. We highlight the strategic uncertainty in cartel coordination as a channel of composition deterrence, as well as the potential trade-off between frequency and composition deterrence...|$|E
40|$|In Leegin Creative Leather Products, Inc. v. PSKS, Inc., 551 U. S. 877 (2007), the Supreme Court {{reversed}} Dr. Miles Medical Co. v. John D. Park 2 ̆ 6 Sons Co., 220 U. S. 373 (1911), {{which had}} banned minimum {{resale price maintenance}} (“minimum RPM”) as unlawful per se. For many, Leegin was a straightforward exercise of the Court’s long-recognized authority, implied by the Sherman Act’s rule of reason, to adjust antitrust doctrine in light of new economic learning. In particular, Leegin invoked the teachings of transaction cost economics (“TCE”), which holds that many non-standard agreements, including minimum RPM, are voluntary mechanisms that reduce the transaction costs that manufacturers incur when they rely upon independent dealers to distribute their goods. For instance, proponents of TCE, including Nobel Laureate Oliver Williamson, have asserted that minimum RPM can prevent free riding and ensure that dealers engage in an optimal amount and type of promotion. Invoking these and other possible benefits, the Leegin Court ruled that minimum RPM could produce “redeeming virtues” and thus did not satisfy the normal test for per se condemnation. In so doing, the Court adhered {{to the rule of}} reason’s requirement, articulated in Standard Oil Co. v. United States, 221 U. S. 1 (1911), that courts adjust antitrust doctrine when “more accurate economic conceptions” undermine previous decisions. However, some have chosen to resist Leegin to the utmost. In particular, scholars, enforcement officials, and forty-one state attorneys general have sought to convince Congress and/or state legislatures to reinstate the per se rule by statute, for instance, and have contended that minimum RPM is unlawful per se under existing state antitrust laws. Many have also argued that, pending Leegin’s reversal, courts should subject minimum RPM to a “quick look” rule of reason, whereby the practice is presumed unlawful, immediately casting upon the defendant a burden of justification. Perhaps because of these efforts, legislation that would have reversed Leegin and codified Dr. Miles was proposed by Congress in 2011. There is, of course, a long history of Congress overriding straightforward applications of the Sherman Act, sometimes at the behest of special interest groups that benefit from such exemptions. However, those who resist Leegin and seek to reinstate the per se rule against minimum RPM do not rely upon the power of legislatures to pass wealth-reducing legislation. Instead they argue that Leegin “got it wrong” when applying basic antitrust principles animating the rule of reason. For these advocates, then, a new per se ban on minimum RPM would merely undo Leegin’s mistake. This article refutes the various arguments that Leegin’s detractors have made for reinstating Dr. Miles and/or “quick look” treatment. TCE, it is shown, undermined the central premise of the per se rule, namely, that minimum RPM is economically indistinguishable from a naked <b>horizontal</b> <b>cartel</b> between dealers. This realization casts upon those who resist Leegin a burden of articulating and supporting an alternative rationale for per se condemnation. As the Article shows, Leegin’s detractors have not met this burden. Instead, their various arguments contradict TCE, basic antitrust principles, or both. Taken to their logical conclusion, these arguments would require the Court to abandon decades of jurisprudence based upon TCE and/or the long-standing test for per se illegality. However, Leegin’s detractors have offered no argument in favor of such radical changes. Thus, far from correcting Leegin’s purported antitrust error, reimposition of the ban on minimum RPM would constitute a rejection of the “more accurate economic conceptions” that should drive antitrust doctrine and thus be akin to a welfare-reducing special interest exemption from the Sherman Act. Such exemptions are read narrowly, to minimize the impact of special interest influence in the legislative process. Indeed, even if Congress or the states do codify a per se ban on minimum RPM, state and federal courts will have various doctrinal strategies at their disposal to minimize the wealth-reducing impact of such legislation by, for instance, reading any amendment narrowly and restricting the class of plaintiffs who can challenge such agreements. As a result, resistance to Leegin may be more than merely misguided; it may also be futil...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{challenging}} problems to applied industrial economists is the detection of colluding behavior in oligopolistic markets. In this paper we postulate how low market share variability may be used as a primary indicator of cartel success to maintain the agreed upon levels of production, after controlling from exogenous fluctuations in the economic environment and the market structure. To test this hypothesis we use a unique data set consisting of government-sanctioned cartels in Sweden from 1976 to 1990. The use of a measure of share stability is shown to be an interesting and potentially informative statistic for making comparisons when the cartel agreement is in effect and when it is absent. The conclusion supports our hypothesis that <b>horizontal</b> price fixing <b>cartels</b> are significantly associated with a lower instability than in its absence. The normative implication of the paper is that a measure of market share variability may provide a basic framework for antitrust authorities to call for attention on the possible existence of tacit collusion in industries with similar market structure but significant differences in market share stability.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} aims to {{shed some}} light on a variety of topics regarding information and competition. The first three papers focus on the impact of "networks" (in a broad sense) as an information acquisition tool. Recent ICT-developments are causing consumers to become increasingly connected. The first two papers, therefore, considered the impact of (actual) social networks. By creating and accessing such networks, individuals can pool their information and as such become better informed. The first paper investigated how such networks may affect market outcomes when consumers search sequentially. The second paper considered the informativeness of networks in a more general setting. The network framework used in these two papers may also be interpreted more broadly. In a third paper, we expanded the framework and reinterpreted it as a model of passive information acquisition. The last paper focused on a topic that has intrigued economist for a long time (see Stigler, 1964) : How can firms overcome the difficulties associated with the implementation of "collusive" agreements? In particular, we investigated the role a common supplier could play in disciplining a (<b>horizontal)</b> <b>cartel</b> by refusing to supply a defector. The main insights provided by this dissertation are summarized below. The first paper studied the implications of an information network in the presence of sequentially searching consumers. Previous work (see Galeotti, 2010) finds that networks can decrease consumers' search efforts, reducing the overall level of consumer informedness. Firms respond to this uninformedness by competing less aggressively and increasing prices. We showed that this "anti-competitive" effect of networks depends crucially on the mode of search and the timing of network activities. With respect to the mode of search, we showed that when consumers search sequentially and the market is duopolistic, larger networks always decrease the price paid by all consumers. When there are more than two firms in the market, larger networks may increase prices. With respect to timing, we showed that consumers can only become less informed if search takes place prior to using the information network. The second paper examined the informativeness of consumer information networks in a more general setting. We characterized the informativeness by deriving a simple formula describing how many different pieces of information a network is likely to contain. Given this characterization, we showed how the informativeness varies in the network size and the number of objects. We found that as the network grows larger, or the number of objects increases, consumers will become better informed. The informativeness of the network has important consequences for the degree of competition between firms. We showed that larger networks imply better information transmission, which intensifies competition and decreases prices. We also showed that in the presence of consumer information networks, {{an increase in the number}} of firms always decreases prices. As an extension, we also considered the impact of endogenous networks, star-shaped networks, costly sequential search, and network segregation. For many products, consumers acquire purchase-relevant information in a "passive" way. They go about their everyday life, and in the meantime they encounter information that is potentially relevant for a later purchase. When they eventually need to buy the product, they will recall part of this information and do not have to search "actively" for it. The third paper developed and estimated an empirical model of passive information acquisition. Passive information acquisition was modelled as a stochastic process in which consumers have opportunities of becoming informed about firm prices. We estimated our model using data on the Belgian market for diesel fuel. Our results indicated that most automobile drivers have few information opportunities and compare prices of a very small number of filling stations. A small fraction of drivers is, however, extremely price-comparing and has a large number of opportunities. We used our estimates to assess the effects of market structure on competition. We found that an increase in the number of filling stations decreases the expected price for all drivers by inducing them to become better informed. The fourth paper investigated the role a common upstream supplier (the "hub") can play in facilitating collusion between his downstream buyers (the "spokes"). We investigated a strategy in which the hub no longer supplies a defector in the downstream cartel. We showed that this strategy facilitates collusion by supporting collusion for lower discount factors. However, the cost of refusing to supply is borne by both the defector and the supplier. For the latter to participate, a number of conditions need to be fulfilled. We showed that only in a very limited number of cases, the supplier will participate in the punishment scheme. Only when the buyers are involved in strong price competition among themselves, and they have sufficient bargaining power vis-à-vis the seller, is the seller willing to impose an embargo to stabilize the downstream cartel. nrpages: 173 status: publishe...|$|E
