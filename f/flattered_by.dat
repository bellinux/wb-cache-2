5|$|In the 2005–06 WNCL season, Ebsary {{struggled}} {{to make an impact}} with the ball, taking four wickets at 43.00 at the relatively high economy rate of 4.91. Her figures were <b>flattered</b> <b>by</b> a haul of 3/32 in the final match of the season against Western Australia, in which she also made 26 to help seal a three-wicket win. Her batting continued to progress; she scored 149 runs at 29.80, including a best of 43 against Victoria. South Australia won five of their eight matches, again missing the finals.|$|E
5|$|A paper {{airplane}} {{contest is}} being hosted at Dunder Mifflin {{by a new}} paper supplier. All of the office workers compete against {{each other for a}} $2,000 prize. Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) in particular is fiercely competitive, and even as she realizes that she is showing an ugly side of herself to her boyfriend Pete Miller (Jake Lacy), she cannot hold back from smashing a box of packing peanuts when she loses in the semi-finals. After several intense rounds, it comes down to Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) and Angela Lipton (Angela Kinsey). Dwight, who is dating Esther (Nora Kirkpatrick), tries to throw the contest. Angela is <b>flattered</b> <b>by</b> the gesture. However, when Esther expresses her condolences to Angela about her financial situation since her husband separated from her, she realizes that Dwight is letting her win out of pity, not love. Angered, she rebuffs Dwight's pity and lets him win the contest.|$|E
5|$|Rhys tries {{unsuccessfully to}} get Robbie O'Brien (Shaun Goss) {{to quit the}} {{surgical}} program. He then turns his attention to Erin Salisbury (Elise Jansen) and plots to take her spot on the program instead. He pursues Erin romantically and tries to distract her away from her work, so she will be kicked off the program and he can take her place. Barber said the scheme sees Rhys at his manipulative best, he realises Erin is vulnerable and he strikes. Jansen told a writer for TV Week that Erin is a bit reluctant to accept when Rhys asks her out. She thinks that someone like Rhys would not normally be interested in her, but she is <b>flattered</b> <b>by</b> the attention. Jansen added Erin is unaware it is all an act. Kate realises what Rhys is doing and interferes with his plan. Barber explained that Kate's feelings about the matter means nothing to Rhys as his sole objective is {{to get into the}} program. He does not mind that Kate is appalled at Erin becoming a casualty of his scheme.|$|E

5|$|Blaine had briefly {{joined the}} Cheerios {{when it looked}} like New Directions would be {{disbanding}} after their Sectionals loss, and cheerleading coach Sue (Jane Lynch) blackmails Blaine into rejoining; Blaine and Sam hatch up a plan to bring Sue down from the inside. Blaine eventually confesses to Sam that he has feelings for him, to which Sam assures him that he is somewhat <b>flattered</b> <b>by</b> Blaine's honesty and attraction, and that it would not change the fact that Blaine is still Sam's best friend. Blaine still loves Kurt and asks Burt for his permission to propose to Kurt, but Burt tells him they're too young to marry, and advises him to wait. Blaine remains determined, however, and while shopping for a ring, he meets Jan (Patty Duke), a lesbian jeweler who has been with her partner Liz (Meredith Baxter) for over thirty years. Jan offers to be a mentor to him, and Blaine and Kurt later have dinner with Jan and Liz, where Jan and Liz explain how their relationship evolved over the years and their experience with the growing mainstream acceptance of gay people. New Directions wins at Regionals, and Will and Emma get married immediately afterward, with the glee club, plus some graduates including Kurt, in attendance. Blaine is shown, after the ceremony is over, holding a jewelry box behind his back.|$|E
25|$|Kojima's {{choice of}} {{composer}} for Metal Gear Solid 2 was highly publicized {{in the run-up}} to the game's release, with him deciding upon Harry Gregson-Williams, a film composer from Hans Zimmer's studio, after watching The Replacement Killers with sound director Kazuki Muraoka. A mix CD containing 18 tracks of Gregson-Williams' work was sent to his office. <b>Flattered</b> <b>by</b> the research put into creating the CD (as some of the tracks were unreleased, and that what tracks he'd worked on for some films were undocumented), he joined the project soon after.|$|E
25|$|Belcher was keen {{to network}} with {{industrialists}} and was <b>flattered</b> <b>by</b> Stanley's apparent solicitude. The two rapidly became friends and Stanley offered Belcher {{use of a}} house that he had rented at Margate {{for the duration of}} the 1947 Labour Party conference. Belcher took the opportunity to invite his wife, children and mother for a two-week vacation, and it soon became apparent to Stanley that the party was too large for his rented house. Stanley booked the party into a hotel in Cliftonville and, though Belcher at this point became nervous, Stanley insisted and prevailed. In the end, Belcher indulged himself thoroughly and the friendship between the pair became increasingly intimate.|$|E
50|$|In Pythagorean tuning, {{there are}} eleven justly tuned fifths sharper than 700 cents by about 1.955 cents (or exactly one twelfth of a Pythagorean comma), and hence one fifth will be <b>flatter</b> <b>by</b> twelve times that, which is 23.460 cents (one Pythagorean comma) flatter than a just fifth. A fifth this flat {{can also be}} {{regarded}} as howling like a wolf. There are also now eight sharp and four flat major thirds.|$|R

While septimal meantone temperament tempers out the septimal kleisma, some other temperaments, for example miracle temperament, do so also, and {{in all of these}} temperaments the augmented triad may be identified with a circle of two major and one septimal major thirds, making up an octave.|$|R

Europeans usually called them Burmese, but beyond the fact that they come from the Burmese Shán states the term is not {{applicable}} to more than an extremely small percentage, and the application of the name to his face would be not considered <b>flattering</b> <b>by</b> the average Shán." ...|$|R
25|$|The rest of {{the squad}} were disappointing though. Of the other batsmen, only Smith {{averaged}} over 30, and that was <b>flattered</b> <b>by</b> his big century at Antigua. He was in terrible form {{for the vast majority}} of the tour. Ramprakash averaged just over 10 in four Tests – a poor return for a man of his talents. None of the other bowlers impressed at all – Salisbury picked up seven wickets, but they were expensive, and Igglesden and Malcolm showed little to earn continued selection in the Tests in their brief appearances. Steve Watkin didn't even get that chance in the Test series, despite his fine end to the 1993 Ashes, after an early injury gave the impetus to others.|$|E
25|$|Ignacio Serricchio as Dr. Rodolfo Fuentes (seasons 9–12): Rodolfo is a Cuban {{forensic}} anthropologist seeking {{asylum in}} the U.S. While {{he was already}} a qualified forensic anthropologist back in Cuba, he is working towards the same qualifications in America. He's also a shameless flirt, and has openly flirted with Angela and with Dr. Brennan, {{both of whom are}} married. Though Angela was <b>flattered</b> <b>by</b> his actions, both women turned down his advances. Despite his flirting habits, Hodgins takes him under his wing and becomes a good friend to him. He carries his father's prayer beads with him, despite not believing in God, because he believes that you need to experience {{a little bit of everything}} to make good life decisions.|$|E
25|$|Fred first {{encountered}} Rosemary Letts in early 1969 (shortly after her 15th birthday). The pair first met at Cheltenham bus station. Initially, Rose was repulsed by Fred's unkempt appearance, and deduced {{he was a}} tramp, although she quickly became <b>flattered</b> <b>by</b> the attention Fred continued to lavish upon her over the following days as he invariably sat alongside her at the same bus stop. Reportedly, Rose twice refused to accompany Fred upon a date, although she agreed {{to allow him to}} accompany her home. In their initial conversations, Fred quickly discovered that although Rose had never had a boyfriend, she was overtly promiscuous. He also extracted a degree of sympathy from her by claiming he and his two daughters had been abandoned by his wife, and that he wished for more children.|$|E

25|$|In 1819-1820, Droste spent a {{year with}} the Haxthausens at Bökerhof, {{interrupted}} only by a stay at the nearby spa town of Bad Driburg, where she hoped {{to find a cure}} for her health problems. Here she became romantically involved with Heinrich Straube (1794–1847), a law student with literary interests, who was a friend of her step-uncle August. What happened next is unclear, but it appears that some members of the Haxthausen family, led by Annette's step-aunt Anna (who was in fact four years her junior), disapproved of the relationship because Straube was a middle-class Protestant, and they devised a scheme {{to put an end to}} it. While Straube was away pursuing his legal studies at the University of Göttingen, they persuaded another young man with literary ambitions, August von Arnswaldt, who came from an upper-class Protestant family, to pretend to pay court to Annette. At first <b>flattered</b> <b>by</b> Arnswaldt's attentions, she gave some indications she was in love with him, before telling him she really loved Straube. By this time it was too late, however, as Arnswaldt had all the evidence he needed. He travelled to Göttingen and told Straube of Annette's behaviour. The two men wrote a joint letter (which has not been preserved), breaking off all contact with her. She never saw either man again. A few years later, Arnswaldt married Anna von Haxthausen, the ringleader of the intrigue. Straube became a lawyer in Kassel and married in 1824. When he died in 1847, a lock of Droste's hair was found among his possessions. The affair was a catastrophe for Droste and damaged her future marriage prospects. Shocked by the role the Haxthausens had played in the intrigue, she refused to visit Bökerhof for the next 18 years.|$|E

Murasaki wrote in her diary, [...] "How utterly ridiculous! Would I, who hesitate to reveal my learning to my women at home, ever think of doing so at court?"

It is said that {{on one of his}} visits home, Predić went to the local pub and encountered the patrons examining a calendar with a reproduction of his painting inside it. A number of patrons—some of whom were included in the composition—tapped him on the shoulder in drunken stupor and commended him on how accurately he had captured them.
