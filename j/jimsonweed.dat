50|$|Hyoscyamine (also {{known as}} daturine) is a tropane alkaloid.

50|$|Datura is a genus of nine {{species of}} {{poisonous}} vespertine flowering plants {{belonging to the}} family Solanaceae.

Its precise and natural distribution is uncertain, owing to its extensive cultivation and naturalization throughout the temperate and tropical regions of the globe.

5000|$|In Homer's Odyssey the god Hermes gives Odysseus an herb with [...] "a black root, but milklike flower" [...] called [...] "moly", which Hermes claims {{will make}} Odysseus {{immune to the}} sorceress Cerce's drugs.

The descriptions of moly given by Greek physician and herbalist Dioscorides support moly's identity as Galanthus nivalis. It has been proposed that the drugs Cerce used were an extract from Datura stramonium (also known as <b>jimsonweed),</b> which causes memory loss and delirium. This would give a basis for the snowdrop's use as an antidote, as Datura stramonium is anticholinergic, while galantamine is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor.|$|E

Störck was particularly interested in the medical possibilities of plants such as hemlock, henbane, <b>jimsonweed</b> and autumn crocus.

Li Shizhen personally experimented with <b>jimsonweed</b> and recorded his experience as follows: [...] "According to traditions, it is alleged that when the flowers are picked for use with wine while one is laughing, the wine will cause one to produce laughing movements; and when the flowers are picked while one is dancing, the wine will cause one to produce dancing movements. have found out that such movements will be produced when one becomes half-drunk with the wine and someone else laughs or dances to induce these actions."

5000|$|Chumash {{traditional}} narratives in {{oral history}} say that religious specialists, known as alchuklash created the rock art.

According to David Whitley, shamanism is [...] "a form of worship based on direct, personal interaction between a shaman (or medicine man) {{and the supernatural}} (or sacred realm and its spirits)." [...] In Chumash territory, the sites for the vision quests were usually located near the shamans village. The Chumash considered caves, rocks, and water sources quite powerful, and the shamans saw them as a [...] "portal to the sacred realm...where they could enter the supernatural." [...] The way a shaman interacted with the supernatural was by entering a hallucinogenic trance, or altered state of consciousness. In this altered state, brought on either by surprisingly potent native tobacco or <b>jimsonweed,</b> shamans received visions and supernatural power from spirit helpers often in the forms of dangerous and powerful animals like rattlesnakes and grizzly bears.

50|$|Atropa {{belladonna}} {{and related}} plants, such as Datura stramonium (commonly known as jimson weed or <b>jimsonweed),</b> have occasionally {{been used as}} recreational drugs because of the vivid hallucinations and delirium they produce. However, these hallucinations are most commonly described as very unpleasant, and recreational use is considered extremely dangerous {{because of the high}} risk of unintentional fatal overdose. In addition, the central nervous system effects of atropine include memory disruption, which may lead to severe confusion. The major effects of belladonna consumption last for three to four hours, visual hallucinations can last for three to four days, and some negative aftereffects are preserved for several days. The use of belladonna as a recreational drug is reported to bring about predominantly bad trips that the users want never to repeat {{for as long as they}} live. Trips induced by belladonna are threatening, dark, demonic, hellish, frightening, and terrifying. Occasionally, belladonna can induce out-of-body experiences, a heightened sense of awareness, and enhance sexual, mystical and lucid dreaming experiences often in combination with other psychoactive plants. Positive experiences induced by belladonna consumption are rare.Historically, the plant was an important, active ingredient in witches' flying ointments : complex, transdermally-absorbed hallucinogens with a fatty or oily base, which caused a deathlike trance in which vivid hallucinations of flight and bacchanalian carousal were experiencedbelow.|$|E

Foram testados dois compostos imidazolinonas (imazaquin e imazethapyr) e duas sulfoniluréias (chlorimuron e metsulfuron), e avaliadas as áreas foliar e cotiledonar, estatura e matéria seca das plântulas da geração seguinte. Em quinquilho, as áreas foliar e cotiledonar das plântulas aspergidas não diferiram da testemunha. Já as estaturas de balãozinho e quinquilho foram afetadas pelos herbicidas: em quinquilho, especialmente por clorimuron; em balãozinho, além de clorimuron, também por metsulfuron. Diversos tratamentos afetaram a matéria seca total ou de segmentos de plântulas de quinquilho. Em corriola não se constataram efeitos dos tratamentos herbicidas nas variáveis avaliadas.

Emergence was surveyed from two burial depths (5 and 10 cm) and with simulation of reduced tillage (i. e. by soil disturbance) and no-till conditions. Barnyardgrass emergence was significantly affected by burial depth, having greater emergence from 5 cm depth (96 %) although even 78 % of seedlings emerged from 10 cm depth after the two years of study. Emergence of barnyardgrass was stable across years from the different depths and tillage regimes. <b>Jimsonweed</b> seeds showed lower germination than barnyardgrass during the study period, whereas its emergence was significantly affected by soil disturbance having 41 % compared to 28 % without disturbance. A burial depth x soil disturbance interaction was also determined, which showed higher emergence from 10 cm depth with soil disturbance. <b>Jimsonweed</b> was found to have significantly higher emergence from 10 cm depth with soil disturbance in Year 2. Seasonal emergence timing of barnyardgrass did not vary between the different burial depth and soil disturbance regimes, as it started in April and lasted until end of May in both years. <b>Jimsonweed</b> showed a bimodal pattern, with first emergence starting end of April until mid-May and the second ranging from mid-June to mid-August from 10 cm burial depth and from mid-July to mid-August from 5 cm depth, irrespective of soil disturbance in both cases...|$|E
