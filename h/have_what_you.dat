500|$|Kelly's first post-Messengers solo {{release was}} the live double CD Live, May 1992, {{released}} in November 1992. AllMusic's Brett Hartenbach noted that Kelly's band had fleshed out his {{songs in the}} studio, {{but he was still}} able to show [...] "his vignettes of life, love, and the underbelly of both have plenty of power on their own". Kelly had relocated to Los Angeles and signed with Vanguard Records to tour the US as a solo artist. While in Los Angeles he produced fellow Australian Renée Geyer's album Difficult Woman (1994). Kelly returned to Australia in 1993 and wrote a collection of lyrics, aptly titled Lyrics, which opens with a quote from Anton Chekhov: [...] "I don't <b>have</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> would call a philosophy or coherent world view so I shall have to limit myself to describing how my heroes love, marry, give birth, die and speak." ...|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{its first}} release in September 2008 Chromium {{was criticized for}} storing saved {{passwords}} in a manner so that any casual user of a computer can easily read them from the GUI. Chromium Users have filed many bug reports and feature requests asking for a master password option to access stored passwords, but Chromium developers have consistently insisted that this provides no real security against knowledgeable hackers. Users have argued that it would protect against co-workers or family members borrowing a computer and seeing the stored passwords in clear text. In December 2009, Chromium developer P. Kasting stated: [...] "A master password was issue 1397. That issue is closed. We will not implement a master password. Not now, not ever. Arguing for it won't make it happen. 'A bunch of people would like it' won't make it happen. Our design decisions are not democratic. You cannot always <b>have</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> want." ...|$|E
