I don't think an editor would have read 50 pages of it. It was very overdone and shaggy, but two young editors saw something that seemed worth pursuing and eventually we all did some work on the book and it was published. I don't think publishers {{have that kind of}} tolerance these days, and I guess possibly as a result, more writers go to writing class now than then. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>first,</b> fiction, and second, novels, are much more refined in terms of language, but they may tend to be too well behaved, almost in response to the narrower market.|$|E

60|$|The Kings of Egypt who {{expelled}} the Shepherds and Succeeded them, Reigned <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>first</b> at Coptos, {{and then}} at Thebes, {{and then at}} Memphis. At Coptos I place Misphragmuthosis and Amosis or Thomosis who expelled the Shepherds, and abolished their custom of sacrificing men, and extended the Coptic language, {{and the name of}} Αια Κοπτου, Aegyptus, to the conquest. Then Thebes became the Royal City of Ammon, and from him was called No-Ammon, and his conquest on the west of Egypt was called Ammonia. After him, in the same city of Thebes, Reigned Osiris, Orus, Menes or Amenophis, and Ramesses: but Memphis and her miracles were not yet celebrated in Greece; for Homer celebrates Thebes as in its glory in his days, and makes no mention of Memphis. After Menes had built Memphis, Mœris the successor of Ramesses adorned it, and made it the seat of the Kingdom, and this was almost two Generations after the Trojan war. Cinyras, the Vulcan who married Venus, and under the Kings of Egypt Reigned over Cyprus and part of Phœnicia, and made armour for those Kings, lived 'till the times of the Trojan war: and upon his death Menes or Memnon might Deify him, and found the famous Temple of Vulcan in that city for his worship, but not live to finish it. In a plain [330] not far from Memphis are many small Pyramids, said to be built by Venephes or Enephes; and I suspect that Venephes and Enephes have been corruptly written for Menephes or Amenophis, the letters AM being almost worn out in some old manuscript: for after the example of these Pyramids, the following Kings, Mœris and his successors, built others much larger. The plain in which they were built was the burying-place of that city, as appears by the Mummies there found; and therefore the Pyramids were the sepulchral monuments of the Kings and Princes of that city: and by these and such like works the city grew famous soon after the days of Homer; who therefore flourished in the Reign of Ramesses.|$|E

50|$|What do {{you think}} of the 'Anxiety' idea?

You mentioned it being good ballet material, yes, but <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>first,</b> it should be composed as music by itself and therefore protect it from being too obvious program music, and then if some clever choreographer can put the musical composition to work, with what added quality good music may give to the themes and material, well and good. I would rather have 'it' in the concert hall, where it can be less 'handled' than in the ballet school where many different talents brush it up. It's too good a thing for many hands.|$|E

50|$|I {{was in the}} 2nd Bull Run defeat under Pope and in {{many small}} engagements under {{different}} commands, was made Sergeant Major of our Regiment after serving 2 or more years; then after another year or more our Colonel surprised my by handing me a commission from Gov. Boreman of W.

5000|$|Lindegaard {{is one of}} the few footballers to {{have spoken}} out against the {{intolerance}} of homosexuality in football and the absence of openly gay players from the professional game. In a 2012 blog entry, he wrote, [...] As a footballer <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>first</b> and foremost that a homosexual colleague is afraid of the reception he could get from the fans. My impression is that the players would not have a problem accepting a homosexual. Homosexuality in football is a taboo subject. The atmosphere on the pitch and in the stands is tough. The mechanisms are primitive, and it is often expressed through a classic stereotype that a real man should be brave, strong and aggressive. And it is not the image that a football fan associates with a gay person. The problem for me is that a lot of football fans are stuck in a time of intolerance that does not deserve to be compared with modern society's development in the last decades. While the rest of the world has been more liberal, civilised and less prejudiced, the world of football remains stuck in the past when it comes to tolerance. Homosexuals are in need of a hero. They are in need of someone who dares to stand up for their sexuality.|$|E
5000|$|In a January 29, 2010, {{interview}} with the Wall Street Journal, DeLillo discussed at great length Point Omega, his views of writing, and {{his plans for the}} future. When asked about why his recent novels had been shorter, DeLillo replied, [...] "Each book tells me what it wants or what it is, and I'd be perfectly content to write another long novel. It just has to happen." [...] While DeLillo is open to the idea of returning to the form of the long novel, the interview also revealed that he currently has no interest in doing as many of his literary contemporaries have done and writing a memoir. DeLillo also made some observations on the state of literature and the challenges facing young writers:It's tougher to be a young writer today than when I was a young writer. I don't think my first novel would have been published today as I submitted it. I don't think an editor would have read 50 pages of it.

40|$|Heisenberg. At the {{occasion}} of the hundredth anniversary of his birthday the aim is to recall the impact of Heisenberg’s work not only on physics and related fields but also on philosophy and on our present understanding of science. Werner Heisenberg discovered and formulated the laws of quantum physics, the concepts and the tools we use every day. These discoveries resulted from his ambitious goal to reveal the fundamental laws of physics and to understand these laws within the logical and structural aspects they imply for the understanding of nature and of thinking. In this way he was aware of the potential of this fundamental new approach and applied the concept of quantum phenomena to physics, chemistry, biology, and to logical-philosophical questions. Being invited here as first speaker of this Symposium it is appropriate, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>first</b> to recall a few dates out of his vita and essentials of his work, and then to address to a timely subject, which is, as I hope to show, related to the work of Werner Heisenberg. 1. ABOUT THE VITA OF WERNER HEISENBERG Werner Heisenberg was born in Würzburg, 1. 12. 1901, his father was professor for Greek language. He studied in München in 1920, attending Sommerfeld’s seminar.
