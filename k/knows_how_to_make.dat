Peter Carlsson of Allehanda called it a strong debut but stated that it did not help Lo to stand out from other pop artists.

Rebecca uses Sam's former office as her own and, {{although it has been}} completely renovated, Sam is able to use Carla's tricks to overhear Rebecca talking to her boss Evan Drake, on whom she has a crush. Evan knows Sam as a baseball player and wants to hire him to be a bartender. Sam is then hired, but one of the two current bartenders must be sacked to make room for him.

Sam then promises nothing of the sort will occur again and is provisionally re-hired on the understanding that this is his last chance as Rebecca uses a seductive baseball metaphor-pun about having two outs, two strikes and [...] "no balls".|$|E
500|$|While {{comparing}} {{the film to}} Dil To Pagal Hai of 1997, Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India gave Kuch Kuch Hota Hai 3.5 out of 5 stars. She especially liked the performance of Kajol, and thought that the film would appeal to young and romantic viewers primarily for its [...] "MTV ambiance" [...] and [...] "Valentine Day flavours". On the negative side, she said [...] "The second half however gets drowned {{in a sea of}} emotions. Too many people begin to cry a bit too much." [...] Anish Khanna of Planet Bollywood rated the film 9.5 out of 10 stars, calling it [...] "pure escapist cinema at its best." [...] He praised the cinematography, choreography, set decoration, and also raved over Kajol's performance, along with her onscreen chemistry with Shah Rukh Khan. Overall, he said [...] "Karan Johar makes an impressive directorial debut, has a good script sense, and <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a film with S-T-Y-L-E." [...] In contrast to these views, the reaction of Sujata C J, writing for Rediff.com, was that the film was very disappointing, with many cliches and a bad story line, though Santosh Thundiyil and Sharmishta Roy were praised for their camerawork and art direction, respectively. Nandita Chowdhury in a review for India Today, said that Karan Johar was almost able to rekindle the Khan-Kajol magic of Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, and that overall the film was [...] "a good distraction".|$|E

But as she tries to regain her audience, her greatest weapon may be her versatility: Ms. Carey also <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a hip-hop hit by holding back and letting the beat shine."
