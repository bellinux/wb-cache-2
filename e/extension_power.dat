The current study showed improvement in knee extension in stance, but no difference between groups was seen at either post-op interval (Tables  3 and 4) by 3 D kinematic analysis. However, hip <b>extension</b> <b>power</b> was improved in the HST group at the 1 -year post-op assessment, while there was a decrease in the HSL group, but both groups showed greater power between the first post-op and the final follow-up gait analyses (Tables  3 and 4). Many surgeons are concerned that hamstring lengthening may cause loss of hip <b>extension</b> <b>power,</b> since they contribute 25 – 30  % of the overall hip <b>extension</b> <b>power</b> [9]. However, we found that the assumption that hip <b>extension</b> <b>power</b> is lost in the long term following hamstring lengthening is invalid. Thus, the “surgical dose” that we used was sufficient to yield improvements in objective gait parameters without having any adverse effects.|$|E

No significant difference was found between leg <b>extension</b> <b>power</b> after static stretching (1788. 5 ± 85. 7 W) and that after nonstretching (1784. 8 ± 108. 4 W). On the other hand, leg <b>extension</b> <b>power</b> after dynamic stretching (2022. 3 ± 121. 0 W) was significantly (p < 0. 01) greater than that after nonstretching.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} whether elderly people with low physical fitness who had participated in training program for improvement of walking performance showed an improvement in their leg <b>extension</b> <b>power</b> and walking motion. A total of one elderly women and three elderly men (from 71 to 88 years old) who had needed nursing participated in the training program held for approximately 10 minutes a time and twice a week for 6 weeks. The subject executed 20 times by three sets of each leg extension and leg flexion a day by using the simply and handy leg extension and flexion machine. Walking motions were filmed from a lateral angle using digital video camera and analyzed before and after training. After training, the leg <b>extension</b> <b>power</b> was significantly increased and its relative increase rate was approximately 17 %. Moreover, three elderly people improved their walking speed by extending the stride length and increasing the height of tiptoe in one cycle. The movement of hip, knee and ankle joints during the walking had remarkably increased compared with before training. Therefore, it is thought that the leg extension and flexion training using the simply and handy leg extension and flexion machine is effective to the improvement of leg <b>extension</b> <b>power</b> and walking performance for elderly people with low physical strength who had needed nursing...|$|E

40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were to clarify the effect of leg <b>extension</b> <b>power</b> on running long jump on school children, and to examine the effectivenesses of jump from shorter approach run. The experiment was composed of filming take-off movement and measuring leg <b>extension</b> <b>power.</b> In the filming, two kinds of jump were done; longer approach run defined as Trial I (over 20 meters) and shorter approach run defined as Trial II (within 15 meters). Subjects were thirty-four males and thirty-two females in the fifth grade of elementary school. Then, they were divided into three groups judging from relative leg <b>extension</b> <b>power</b> (leg extension power/body weight); Excellent group, Medium group and Poor group. Obtained variables from film analysis such as displacement, time, velocity and angle were compared among three groups. In the same way, those variables were compared between both trials. Results were as follows : 1) In the male 2 ̆ 7 s Trial I, Excellent group recorded longer jumping distance than the other two groups as a result of higher approach running velocity. Moreover, Excellent group seemed to perform more rational take-off movement than Poor group judging from shorter contact time. 2) In male 2 ̆ 7 s Trial II, Excellent group moved into take-off with higher approach running velocity, and showed higher initial velocity at take-off. Consequently Excellent group recorded longer jumping distance. 3) In both trials of females, there were no variables to be recognized as significant differences among groups. Therefore, running long jump of the fifth grade of females seemed not to be affected by leg <b>extension</b> <b>power</b> remarkably. 4) In the Trial II, males recorded shorter jumping distance as a result of lower initial velocity, and showed no rational take-off movements. Therefore, there were few merits by utilizing shorter approach run. 5) It was concluded that jumping from shorter approach run was effective for female 2 ̆ 7 s Poor group because of leading better landing to sandpit without reducing velocity at take-off...|$|E

Although pre-disaster risk factors are important for early detection and proactive support, the examination of such has been limited to sociodemographic factors, which were largely unaffected by the disasters. We examined the association between pre-disaster physical functioning and lifestyle and PTSD symptoms {{five months after the}} earthquake in the Great East Japan Earthquake survivors who were participating in a pre-existing cohort study. Methods: We designed a retrospective cohort study of a cooperative association in Sendai from August 2010 to August 2011. In 2010, lifestyle, physical condition, and sociodemographic factors were examined by self-reported questionnaires completed by 522 employees of this organization. We also measured the leg <b>extension</b> <b>power</b> of all the participants. PTSD symptoms were evaluated by the Japanese version of the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R-J) following the earthquake of 2011.

In {{attempt to}} prediet 2000 m rowing {{ergometer}} performance time, we studied anthropometric and physilogical l limiting factors among 78 collegiate male rowers. Among variables that we measured, 2000 m rowing performance time was significantly and {{inversely related to}} lean body mass (r= - 0. 68), maximal oxygen uptake (- 0. 64), and leg exension power (- 0, 54) (p< 0. 001). resoectively.

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} the present study was to examine the effects of {{external}} work rate on joint specific power and the relationship between knee <b>extension</b> <b>power</b> and vastus lateralis muscle oxygen consumption (mVO 2). We measured kinematics and pedal forces and used inverse dynamics to calculate joint power for the hip, knee and ankle joints during an incremental cycling protocol performed by 21 recreational cyclists. Vastus lateralis mVO 2 was estimated using near-infrared spectroscopy with an arterial occlusion. The main finding was a non-linear relationship between vastus lateralis mVO 2 and external work rate that was characterised by an increase followed by a tendency for a levelling off (R 2 = 0. 99 and 0. 94 for the quadratic and linear models respectively, p< 0. 05). When comparing 100 W and 225 W, there was a ∼ 43 W increase in knee extension but still a ∼ 9 % decrease in relative contribution of knee extension to external work rate resulting from a ∼ 47 W increase in hip extension. When vastus lateralis mVO 2 was related to knee <b>extension</b> <b>power,</b> the relationship was still non-linear (R 2 = 0. 99 and 0. 97 for the quadratic and linear models respectively, p< 0. 05).

Relating vastus lateralis mVO 2 to knee <b>extension</b> <b>power</b> showed a better fit to a linear equation compared to external work rate, but it is not a straight line...|$|E

40|$|Background. Maximal {{voluntary}} muscle strength (MVMS) and leg power are important measures of physical function in older adults. We hypothesized that performing these measures twice within 7 – 10 days would demonstrate a. 5 % increase due to learning and familiarization {{of the testing}} procedures. Methods. Data were collected from three studies in older adult men (60 – 87 years) and {{were divided into two}} cohorts defined by study site and type of exercise equipment. MVMS was assessed in 116 participants using the one-repetition maximum method at two separate study visits for the chest press, latissimus pull-down, leg press, leg flexion, and leg extension exercises along with unilateral leg <b>extension</b> <b>power.</b> Results. Test–retest scores were not different and did not exceed 0. 8 6 9. 0 % in Cohort 1 or 2. 3 6 9. 8 % in Cohort 2, except for leg extension, which improved by 6. 6 6 14. 4 % (p,. 009) and 3. 4 6 6. 8 % (p,. 016), respectively. Repeat tests were closely correlated with initial tests (all p,. 001). Pearson correlation coefficients ranged from 0. 74 for leg <b>extension</b> <b>power</b> to 0. 96 for leg press. Coefficients of variation were, 10 % (4. 2 %– 9. 0 %) for all exercises except for leg <b>extension</b> <b>power,</b> which was 15. 5 %. Conclusions. Our findings demonstrated that test–retest measures of MVMS and power in older adult men do not differ by more than 2. 3 % except for leg extension, and have relatively low coefficients of variation using data collected from three studies.

The incidence of falls and the prevalence {{of those who have}} en-countered a fall in the community-dwelling elderly in Hong Kong was 270 per 1000 person-years and 19. 3 %, respectively. Serious injuries and fractures occur in 7. 2 and 5. 9 % of fallers, respectively. 2. Independent predictors for falls are advancing age, Parkinson’s disease, previous history of falls, left knee <b>extension</b> <b>power</b> and gait speed. Independent predictors for recurrent falls are previous history of falls, self-perceived mobility problems, left knee <b>extension</b> <b>power,</b> total mobility score in the Tinetti Balance and Gait Test. 3. ‘Fear of falling ’ is a common post-fall complication. 4. Fallers commonly experience de-cline in physical functions and the activity of daily living. 5. Fallers, particularly recurrent fallers, consume more health care services than non-fallers. The excess annual health care costs of fallers versus non-fallers amount to HK$ 552 million for all community-living elderly in Hong Kong. 6.
