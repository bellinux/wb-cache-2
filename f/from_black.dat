The two ends were not connected until the middle portion of the freeway was completed in 2004. The delay was largely due to funding issues and environmental concerns.|$|E
5|$|Samarium forms {{trivalent}} sulfide, selenide and telluride. Divalent chalcogenides SmS, SmSe and SmTe with cubic rock-salt {{crystal structure}} are also known. They are remarkable by converting from semiconducting to metallic state {{at room temperature}} upon application of pressure. Whereas the transition is continuous and occurs at about 20–30kbar in SmSe and SmTe, it is abrupt in SmS and requires only 6.5kbar. This effect results in spectacular color change in SmS <b>from</b> <b>black</b> to golden yellow when its crystals of films are scratched or polished. The transition does not change lattice symmetry, {{but there is a}} sharp decrease (~15%) in the crystal volume. It shows hysteresis, that is when the pressure is released, SmS returns to the semiconducting state at much lower pressure of about 0.4 kbar.|$|E

40|$|Background—The {{prevalence}} of the endothelium-impaired function disorders, such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus, and {{the severity of}} their complications are considerably greater in blacks than whites. Evidence has accumulated that superoxide (O 2) production and its interaction with nitric oxide (NO), yielding the strong oxidant peroxynitrite (ONOO), play central roles in vascular pathophysiology. We hypothesized that the differences in endothelial NO/O 2 /ONOO metabolism may highlight the potential predisposition to endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular complications prevalent in blacks. Methods and Results—Highly sensitive tandem electrochemical NO/O 2 /ONOO nanosensors were positioned in single human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) isolated <b>from</b> <b>blacks</b> and whites, and the kinetics of NO/O 2 /ONOO release were recorded in vitro. HUVECs were also analyzed by Western immunoblotting and enzyme activity assays for NAD(P) H-oxidase and endothelial NO synthase (eNOS). Compared with whites, HUVECs <b>from</b> <b>blacks</b> elicited reduced release of bioactive NO with an accompanying increase in the release of both O 2 and ONOO. The greater potency of NO production because of eNOS upregulation in HUVECs <b>from</b> <b>blacks</b> {{is associated with a}} decrease in the NO bioavailability. This is due to increased NO degradation by excess O 2 produced primarily by 2 enzymatic sources: NAD(P) H-oxidase and uncoupled eNOS. Conclusions—Compared with whites, the steady-state NO/O 2 /ONOO balance in endothelial cells <b>from</b> <b>blacks</b> is kep...|$|R

5|$|Viking metal emerged <b>from</b> <b>black</b> metal {{during the}} late 1980s and early 1990s, sharing with black metal an {{opposition}} to Christianity, but rejecting Satanism and occult themes {{in favor of the}} Vikings and paganism. It is similar, in lyrics, sound, and thematic imagery, to pagan metal, but pagan metal has a broader mythological focus and uses folk instrumentation more extensively. Most Viking metal bands originate from the Nordic countries, and nearly all bands claim that their members descend, directly or indirectly, from Vikings. Many scholars view Viking metal and the related black, pagan, and folk metal genres as part of broader modern Pagan and neo-völkisch movements as well as part of a global movement of renewed interest in, and celebration of, local and regional ethnicities.|$|E
5|$|Beyond Loch Snizort to {{the west}} of Trotternish is the Waternish peninsula, which ends in Ardmore Point's double rock arch. Duirinish is {{separated}} from Waternish by Loch Dunvegan, which contains the island of Isay. The loch is ringed by sea cliffs that reach 295metres (967ft) at Waterstein Head. Oolitic loam provides good arable land in the main valley. Lochs Bracadale and Harport and the island of Wiay lie between Duirinish and Minginish, which includes the narrower defiles of Talisker and Glen Brittle and whose beaches are formed <b>from</b> <b>black</b> basaltic sands. Strathaird is a relatively small peninsula close to the Cuillin hills with only a few crofting communities, the island of Soay lies offshore. The bedrock of Sleat in the south is Torridonian sandstone, which produces poor soils and boggy ground, although its lower elevations and relatively sheltered eastern shores enable a lush growth of hedgerows and crops. The islands of Raasay, Rona, Scalpay and Pabay all lie to the north and east between Skye and the mainland.|$|E
