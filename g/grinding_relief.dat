40|$|Abstract. Corner radius end mill, whose cutting {{capability}} is mostly {{affected by the}} relief surface, {{is a kind of}} highly effective end mill [1]. So a novel mathematical model of relief surface curve about corner radius end mill, which is verified with a five-axis computer numerical control (CNC) grinding machine and simulated based on a system CAM, is derived and presented in the paper. According to the proposed tool coordinates system and the mechanical coordinate of the machine, the relative motion between the cup wheel and the tool is determined. In order to obtain an accurate relief curve when machining, the model of a cup wheel edge is also introduced. The coordinates of grinding point when <b>grinding</b> <b>relief</b> surface are calculated. With the input data of the corner radius end geometry, wheels geometry, wheel setting and machine setting, the NC code is generated automatically from the program. Then the code is used to simulate in 3 Dimension before actual machining. Finally, the NC code will be used for machining in the CNC grinding machine. The roundness of the round corner in the final product is very well, means this model is effective...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Grinding wheel {{diameter}} {{is one of}} the most important parameter during the entire process of hob <b>relief</b> <b>grinding</b> and it must be analyzed and tested to avoid interference during the <b>relief</b> <b>grinding.</b> Graphical analytical and calculation method is proposed in this paper. <b>Relief</b> <b>grinding</b> interference issues are graphically analyzed and the formulas of <b>relief</b> <b>grinding</b> interference are derived. The interface is designed to calculate the maximum grinding {{wheel diameter}} of different parameters hob [1]. This method provides the basis for selecting grinding wheel rationally...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the results of}} {{investigations}} into the grinding to super-hard polycrystalline materials using a diamond-grinding wheel are presented. The main properties of the grinding process are clarified with special emphasis on the thermodynamic and structural changes of its parameters. The possibility of monitoring the static parameters of the <b>grinding</b> wheel <b>relief</b> during the <b>grinding</b> of materials {{of high and low}} hardness is indicated.

40|$|Abstract: a new 4 -axis machine tool, {{which is}} used to <b>relief</b> <b>grind</b> sphere gear hob {{including}} spherical hob, elliptic hob and arc surface hob, is developed. The principle of machining of spherical hob is introduced first. Transmitting system, numerical system and some key techniques are then introduced. The machine tool can be reconfigured when machining of arc worms and spatial cams beside of machining spherical hob. Four forms of the machine tool for machining different workpiece are also introduced...|$|R
