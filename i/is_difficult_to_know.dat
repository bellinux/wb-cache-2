5|$|Roman Academic Cotta ridicules both {{literal and}} allegorical {{acceptance}} of myth, declaring roundly that myths {{have no place}} in philosophy. Cicero is also generally disdainful of myth, but, like Varro, he is emphatic in his support for the state religion and its institutions. It <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> how far down the social scale this rationalism extended. Cicero asserts that no one (not even old women and boys) is so foolish as to believe in the terrors of Hades or the existence of Scyllas, centaurs or other composite creatures, but, on the other hand, the orator elsewhere complains of the superstitious and credulous character of the people. De Natura Deorum is the most comprehensive summary of Cicero's line of thought.|$|E
5|$|In July 1095, Urban {{turned to}} his {{homeland}} of France to recruit men for the expedition. His travels there culminated in the Council of Clermont in November, where, according to the various speeches attributed to him, he gave an impassioned sermon to a large audience of French nobles and clergy, graphically detailing the fantastical atrocities being committed against pilgrims and eastern Christians. There are five versions of the speech recorded by {{people who may have}} been at the council (Baldric of Dol, Guibert of Nogent, Robert the Monk, and Fulcher of Chartres) or who went on crusade (Fulcher and the anonymous author of the Gesta Francorum), as well as other versions found in later historians (such as William of Malmesbury and William of Tyre). All of these versions were written after Jerusalem had been captured. Thus it <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> what was actually said and what was recreated {{in the aftermath of the}} successful crusade. The only contemporary records are a few letters written by Urban in 1095.|$|E

However, sources indicate that Canute's cathedral is not the present Lund Cathedral. The Cathedral School was established in 1085, making it Scandinavia's oldest school.|$|E

The estimated 3 million girls who are subjected to FGM each year potentially suffer both immediate and lifelong negative effects. Immediately following FGM, girls commonly experience excessive bleeding and urine retention. Long-term consequences include urinary tract infections, bacterial vaginosis, pain during intercourse, and difficulties in childbirth that include prolonged labor, vaginal tears, and excessive bleeding. Women who have undergone FGM also have higher rates of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV2) than women who have not.|$|E

However, surviving financial documents and letters written by the king while he resided elsewhere offer some hints. During {{his work on the}} castle in Stockholm, Boy had to supervise hundreds of employees and ensure materials were delivered in proper order, while keeping his demanding king happy. In 1577, repairs on the royal suite were completed. Two years later, stairs were built south of the castle while the northern gate was furnished with a tower adorned with a spire and a stone tablet carrying the royal coat of arms. Over subsequent years, he was involved in various undertakings at the palace, both decorative work and engineering.|$|E
25|$|The {{predominant}} {{view is that}} Revelation {{alludes to}} the Old Testament although it is difficult among scholars {{to agree on the}} exact number of allusions or the allusions themselves. Revelation rarely quotes directly from the Old Testament, almost every verse alludes to or echoes older scriptures. Over half of the references stem from Daniel, Ezekiel, Psalms, and Isaiah, with Daniel providing the largest number in proportion to length and Ezekiel standing out as the most influential. Because these references appear as allusions rather than as quotes, it <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> whether the author used the Hebrew or the Greek version of the Hebrew scriptures, but he was clearly often influenced by the Greek. He very frequently combines multiple references, and again the allusional style makes it impossible to be certain to what extent he did so consciously.|$|E

Many human skulls are inscribed with the single 'fish' glyph 700 , which may stand for îka [...] "war casualty".

On a larger scale, it <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> whether Sherwood Anderson takes seriously the nostalgic notion of Civil War soldiers marching together as an inspiration for the McGregor's [...] "aesthetic of power" [...] or whether the exaggerated traits of McGregor are, in fact, ironic representations {{of the benefits of}} order.

[...] Sherman's aide, Jacob C. Donaldson, later wrote, [...] "the situation was bad, almost desperate". [...] Hanna had made significant campaign contributions to legislative candidates, and was outraged when legislators believed to favor Sherman instead announced that they would vote for Foraker; according to his biographer, Herbert Croly, [...] "The situation looked desperate; but it was saved, so Mr. Sherman himself stated to his friends, by Mr. Hanna's energy, enthusiasm and ability to bend other men to his will. Three of the Cleveland representatives, who had gone into hiding, were unearthed and forced into line." [...] Donaldson noted, [...] "Several of them were ruined by their perfidy." [...] Foraker was defeated narrowly in the Republican caucus, first on a vote to hold a secret ballot (which would have benefited him), and then on the endorsement vote, which supported Sherman, who was subsequently elected by the legislature.

500|$|From 1868 {{until his}} death in 1895 Paley worked in partnerships. [...] He was joined by Hubert Austin in 1868, when the {{practice}} became known as Paley and Austin.

[...] From 1868 it <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> what part any one partner contributed to any particular project. [...] Almost all the works were attributed to the partnership as a whole, and not to an individual partner. [...] What is certain is that the firm enjoyed its most successful period and designed most of its most admired buildings during these years. [...] New features appeared, including what Brandwood et al. describe as [...] "a new-found muscularity which tended to be uncharacteristic of Paley's work". [...] Although Paley had occasionally used Perpendicular features in his churches, these were used much more frequently, {{so much so that the}} practice is credited with playing a part in what Brandwood et al. term the [...] "Perpendicular revival in the North", and even with playing a [...] "nationally pioneering role" [...] in the [...] "rehabilitation of the Perpendicular style as an acceptable stylistic choice". [...] In addition, later in this period, the use of features derived from the Aesthetic Movement was introduced. [...] It is not known what part Edward Paley played in these developments, but Brandwood et al. argue that they are [...] "undoubtedly attributable to the influence of Austin". [...] This is not to down-play the work done by Paley during this period. [...] Brandwood et al. point out that of the two, Paley had the more outgoing personality, and because of this, and because of his senior position, the writers suggest that he, rather than Austin, would [...] "tend to 'front' many of the dealings of the firm". [...] They also suggest that Paley would be more at ease in dealing with patrons, such as the Duke of Devonshire, in discussing the rebuilding of Holker Hall after the fire of 1871, and that he would have played a greater part in training the pupils in the practice.|$|E
