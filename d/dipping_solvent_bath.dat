We study the dipping duration, one of {{the parameters of the}} dipping deposition related to the characterization of AA-PSP. The dipping duration was varied from 1 to 100, 000 s.

Among the characteristics, the dipping duration most influences the signal level. The change in the signal level is a factor of 8. 4.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Cross-linked polymer networks, {{irrespective}} of the method of cross-linking, contain a fraction of unattached polymer (sol macromolecules). During swelling in a solvent of low molecular weight, the sol macromolecules participate in the swelling process as an athermal solvent. Also, sol macromolecules begin to diffuse out of the swollen polymer into the surrounding <b>solvent</b> <b>bath</b> until equilibrium is reached between the sol macromolecules within the polymer specimen and the molecules in the surrounding bath. Thus, a partially cross-linked polymer during swelling {{should be treated as}} a ternary system consisting of polymer network, a high molecular weight solvent, and a low molecular weight solvent. On the basis of the Flory-Rehner theory, a first model has been developed to predict the swelling behavior of such ternary system. Transient states are considered as quasi-steady state, and the final condition of equilibrium is evaluated. The effect of polymer molecules in the surrounding <b>solvent</b> <b>bath</b> on the swelling behavior was also studied. Swelling experiments of partially cross-linked high-density polyethylene in p-xylene were performed to evaluate the model predictions.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study is to {{investigate}} the usage of high viscosity polymeric hydrogels in varnish removal on paper objects, for conservation purposes. Varnishing paper artefacts was a common practice between the 18 th and 20 th century. However, the procedure has resulted in degradation and discoloration of paper artefacts, which usually results in the removal of the varnish by conservators. The study aims to investigate the solvent-based poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and borate gel as an alternative for removing shellac varnish on paper artefacts. Different solvent-based gels are frequently used in fine arts conservation but are not commonly used in paper conservation. Traditional conservation methods with <b>solvent</b> <b>baths</b> may have negative consequences in terms on the effect on the paper substrate. The hydrogel PVA-borax will be compared to traditional <b>solvent</b> <b>baths</b> commonly used in paper conservation. The study includes a disciplinary literature study of PVA-borax usage for cleaning works of art and the historical usage of varnish on paper objects. Artificial aging of shellac samples are carried out in order to provide sufficient materials and samples for analysis. The chosen analysis methods are Fourier-transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and Ultraviolet (UV) Fluorescence imaging, which both can be used to indicate the presence of shellac residues left after removal. The FTIR analysis shows that PVA-borax is an insufficient substrate for removal of varnish on paper samples due to the low percentage of solvents of the total moisture content carried out in the gel. However, a case study on a varnished wall map shows that PVA-borax gel sufficiently removes aged varnish from the paper substrate. Further studies are needed to analyse the gels sufficiency as a varnish removal agent on paper substrates.

At distances exceeding 3 molecular diameters, the calculated pair diffusion coefficients are in excellent agreement with predictions from exact macroscopic hydrodynamic theory for large Brownian particles suspended in a <b>solvent</b> <b>bath,</b> as well as the Oseen approximation.

Out of four attempted fabrication techniques, drop-casted multilayer structure demonstrated that increasing the amount of fCNTs reduced creep rate, but also decreased active strain, stiffness, and conductivity.

The data and analysis presented here demonstrate the rapid nonexponential vibrational relaxation of I 2 I 2 in the interacting solvent mesitylene. The peak of the population distribution has dropped below n = 10 n= 10 by 11 ps and n = 7 n= 7 by 15. 5 ps.

The initial 4. 4 ps decay in mesitylene is significantly faster than the time scales for relaxation in noninteracting hydrocarbon solvents. The difference in the relaxation rate cannot be attributed to a change in vibrational frequency as the vibrational frequency of I 2 I 2 has only a small dependence on the solvent.

40|$|A coarse-graining (CG) {{approach}} is developed to infer mesoscale interaction potentials in aggregating systems, resulting in an improved potential of mean force for Langevin dynamics (LD) and Brownian dynamics (BD) simulations. Starting from the evolution equation for the solute pair correlation function, this semi-analytical CG approach identifies accurate modeling of the relative acceleration between solute particles in a <b>solvent</b> <b>bath</b> as a reliable route to predicting the time-evolving structural properties of nonequilibrium aggregating systems. Noting that the solute–solvent pair correlation function attains a steady state rapidly as compared to characteristic aggregation time scales, this CG approach derives the effective relative acceleration between a pair of solute particles {{in the presence of}} this steady solute–solvent pair correlation by formally integrating the solvent force on each solute particle. This results in an improved potential of mean force that explicitly depends on the solute–solute and solute–solvent pair potentials, with the capability of representing both solvophilic and solvophobic interactions that give rise to solvation forces. This approach overcomes the difficulty in specifying the LD/BD potential of mean force in aggregating systems where the solute pair correlation function evolves in time, and the Kirkwood formulaU(r) = −kBT ln g(r) that is applicable in equilibrium diffusion problems cannot be used. LD simulations are compared to molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for a model colloidal system interacting with Lennard-Jones pair potentials to develop and validate the improved potential of mean force. LD simulations using the improved potential of mean force predict a solute pair correlation function that is in excellent match with MD in all aggregation regimes, whereas using the unmodified MD solute–solute pair potential in LD results in a poor match in the reaction-limited aggregation regime. The improved potential also dramatically improves the predicted extent of aggregation and evolution of cluster size distributions that exhibit the same self-similar scaling found in MD. This technique of coarse-graining MD potentials to obtain an improved potential of mean force can be applied in a general multiscale framework for nonequilibrium systems where the evolution of aggregate structure is important...|$|R

It regards preparation of copper-tin alloys from green solvents for decorative purposes. Actual industrial process involves cyanide based complex bath {{in order to produce}} white bronze layers and they often contain lead as brightener and whitener. The aim of the thesis is to develop a more environmental friendly process for white bronze electrodeposition. Two different electrolytes were considered as eligible candidates: one involves a simple organic acid aqueous solution as bulk electrolyte, and the other one is a new deep eutectic <b>solvent</b> <b>bath.</b> The investigation of electrodeposition using methanesulfonic acid as complexing agent considered a commercial bath and its optimization in order {{to be used in the}} decorative industry. The focus of the study was on the optimization of deposition parameters and verification of bath and deposit stability which was very important from industrial point of view. Obvious improvements on deposits quality and bath stability can be realized by replacement on anode material and utilization of pulse current. Contrary to that, research on electrodeposition from deep eutectic system was quite new and few relevant studies can be referred especially in the field of alloys. As a result, this work started from deposition of single metal for better understanding of behaviors of mixtures between choline chloride and ethylene glycol or urea. Successful deposition of copper-tin alloys can be carried out under warmed conditions and variation on film composition can be controlled by changing concentrations of metallic salts in the bath. Pulse current acted as an effective tool to refine microstructure of deposits in a similar way as in aqueous solvents. Since no brightener was added, reduced luster was observed here and working mechanism of additives was found to be rather different from that in conventional baths. In summary, operation parameters including temperature, salt concentration, anode material and supporting electrolytes influence the resultant properties of deposits in great extent. Deposit quality from both solvents can be improved by using pulse current with proper frequency. ...|$|R
40|$|In this work, multifilament, {{continuous}} polyacrylonitrile (PAN) {{fiber tow}} was solution spun mimicking industrial processing {{at the small}} pilot scale (0. 5 k tow), while carefully altering {{the composition of the}} coagulation bath, {{in order to determine the}} effect on the resulting fiber shape, density, orientation, and tensile properties at varying points in the spinning process. Novel here are the abnormally high coagulation <b>bath</b> <b>solvent</b> compositions investigated, which surpass those often reported in the literature. In addition, the coagulation bath was maintained at a slightly chilled temperature, contrary to reported methods to produce round fibers. Further, by altering the composition of the bath in a step-wise fashion during a single spinning run, variations in all other process parameters were minimized. We found that with increasing solvent composition in the coagulation bath, the fibers not only became round in cross section, but also became smaller in diameter, which persisted down the spin line. With this decrease in diameter, all else equal, came an accompanying increase in apparent fiber density via a reduction in microvoid content. In addition, molecular orientation and tensile properties also increased. Therefore, it was found that inadequate understanding of the coagulation bath effects, and spinning at low coagulation <b>bath</b> <b>solvent</b> compositions, can hinder the ability of the fiber to reach optimum properties...|$|R
5000|$|Work on {{capillary}} analysis continued, {{but without}} much technical development, {{well into the}} 20th century. The first significant advances over Goppelsroeder's methods came {{with the work of}} Raphael E. Liesegang: in 1927, he placed filter strips in closed containers with atmospheres saturated by solvents, and in 1943 he began using discrete spots of sample adsorbed to filter paper, <b>dipped</b> in pure <b>solvent</b> to achieve separation. [...] This method, essentially identical to modern paper chromatography, was published just before the independent - and far more influential - work of Archer Martin and his collaborators that inaugurated the widespread use of paper chromatography.|$|R
