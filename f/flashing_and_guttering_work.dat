5|$|Lead {{has many}} uses in the {{construction}} industry; lead sheets are used as architectural metals in roofing material, cladding, <b>flashing,</b> <b>gutters</b> <b>and</b> <b>gutter</b> joints, <b>and</b> on roof parapets. Detailed lead moldings are used as decorative motifs to fix lead sheet. Lead is still used in statues and sculptures, including for armatures. In the past it was often used to balance the wheels of cars; for environmental reasons this use is being phased {{out in favor of}} other materials.|$|R
50|$|The Mossman Shire Hall, {{with its}} drop screen, stage and {{orchestra}} pit and dressing rooms, was subsequently {{used for a}} range of community events and functions. In 1938, alterations and additions were made by Hill & Taylor. These included: extending the awning to the pavement from the hall, a new area for storing chairs on the northern side of the building, new kitchen facilities in the commercial premises, <b>and</b> renewing <b>flashing</b> <b>and</b> box <b>guttering</b> on the southern side of building. During World War II, the hall was used by troops as a dance hall.|$|R

50|$|In 1893, {{the local}} {{newspaper}} published a request for donations to help with additional renovations needed at the church.

5000|$|There are {{a number}} of types of curb, {{categorized}} by shape, material, height, and whether the curb is combined with a gutter.

5000|$|A roof must be {{designed}} with a suitable fall {{to allow the}} rainwater to discharge. The water drains into a gutter that is fed into a downpipe. A flat roof will have a watertight surface with a fall of 1 in 60, or 1 {{in the case of}} lead. They can drain internally or to an eaves gutter, which has a minimum 1 in 360 fall towards the downpipe. [...] The pitch of a pitched roof is determined by the construction material of the covering. For slate this will be at 25%, for machine made tiles it will be 35%. Water falls towards a parapet gutter, a valley gutter or an eaves gutter. [...] When two pitched roofs meet at an angle, they also form a pitched valley gutter: the join is sealed with valley <b>flashing.</b> Parapet <b>gutters</b> <b>and</b> valley <b>gutters</b> discharge into internal rainwater pipes or directly into external down pipes {{at the end of the}} run. The capacity of the gutter is a significant design consideration. The area of the roof is calculated (metres) and this is multiplied by rainfall (litres/sec/metres²) which is assumed to be 0.0208. This gives a required discharge outfall capacity. (litres/sec) [...] Rainfall intensity, the amount of water likely to generated in a two-minute rainstorm is more important that average rainfall, the British Standards Institute notes that an indicative storm in Essex, (annual rainfall 500mm per annum) delivers 0.022 l/s/m²- while one in Cumbria (annual rainfall 1800mm per annum) delivers 0.014 l/s/m².|$|R

40|$|Pot casts <b>and</b> <b>gutter</b> casts are {{described}} for the ®rst {{time in the}} lower part of the Majanillos Formation, a Middle Triassic carbonate unit located in the External Zones of the Betic Cordillera (southern Spain). Their identi®cation, as well as their relation to tempestites, enables the better interpretation of the depositional environments and the shoreline-to-offshore facies transition on the Anisian muddy carbonate ramp of the southern Iberian Massif. The Majanillos Formation contains three members, which become progressively more marly towards the top. Well-preserved pot <b>and</b> <b>gutter</b> casts <b>and</b> thin intercalations of calcarenite, which are interpreted as tempestites, are abundant in the lowest member. Above the pot <b>and</b> <b>gutter</b> casts, thicker calcarenite beds, which locally contain hummocky cross-strati®cation, predominate. Bioturbated nodular limestones are prevalent at the top of the member. The remaining succession, which records a long-term Triassic transgressive cycle, consists mostly of ®ne-grained limestones deposited in very shallow-marine environments. Calcarenitic sediments only accumulated within potholes <b>and</b> <b>gutters</b> in the nearshore. They developed during storms when strong currents transported sediment to the outer shelf, where it was deposited as tempestite beds. Pot <b>and</b> <b>gutter</b> casts characterize sedimentation in the bypass zone. It is concluded that storm deposits provide important constraints for the interpretation of palaeobathymetry; it is proposed that gutter casts display a trend of increasing width/thickness ratios towards the outer shelf. The identi®cation of these structures in marine successions elsewhere should prove useful in the interpretation of depositional environments...|$|R
