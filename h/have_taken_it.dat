5|$|Since the 1990s, {{extensions}} to the Mitchell Freeway <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>it</b> to Burns Beach Road at {{the northern}} edge of Joondalup. During 2013, two sections of the northbound carriageway will be widened with an additional lane. In August 2017, an extension was completed to Hester Avenue, after construction starting in 2014. Further works are planned, which will take the freeway past Yanchep and Two Rocks to the boundary of the Perth Metropolitan Region.|$|E
5|$|Edith Chaykoski {{died from}} her wounds at Windsor Metropolitan Hospital at about 05:30 on 26 June. Police searched the {{neighbourhood}} {{during the morning}} and found the shotgun where Lamb had thrown it. They identified it as Hesketh's {{and concluded that the}} 18-year-old must <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>it</b> and gone on a shooting spree the previous day. Lamb was arrested at 15:30 on 26 June and charged with the capital murder of Edith Chaykoski. Under the terms of Canadian law at that time, he faced a mandatory death penalty if convicted. When Woloch's injuries also proved fatal at 14:45 on 11 July 1966, his murder was added to Lamb's charge.|$|E
5|$|The {{catalyst}} for this Norwegian intervention {{may have been}} the extension of Muirchertach's influence into the Irish Sea region following the death of Gofraid Crobán, King of the Isles (died 1095). The region itself appears to have degenerated into chaos following Gofraid's demise, and Magnús seems to <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>it</b> upon himself to reassert Norwegian authority. Magnús made two expeditions into the Irish Sea region. One arrived in 1098; the other in 1102. The focus of the second overseas operation appears to have been Ireland itself. Following an apparent Norwegian conquest of Dublin, Magnús and Muirchertach negotiated a peace agreement, sealed through the marriage of Magnús' son, Sigurðr (died 1130), and Bjaðmunjo herself.|$|E

5|$|In {{the present}} day, Tintin, his dog Snowy, {{and his friends}} Captain Haddock and Professor Calculus follow {{coordinates}} that Sir Francis had left his three sons in a strange riddle hidden in three model ships of the Unicorn. Reaching the coordinates, they discover the island and, upon diving, they find {{the wreck of the}} Unicorn. Although they recover various artefacts from it, they do not find the treasure. Back in Belgium, Tintin realises that Sir Francis' message referred, not to the location of the Unicorn, but to a globe mounted on a statue in Sir Francis' former country home. Understanding now that Francis would never have left the treasure but would <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>it</b> with him to his home, Tintin locates the coordinates to the treasure on the globe, presses a secret button he finds there, and discovers Red Rackham's treasure hidden inside.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after his}} {{election}} as president in 1960, Kennedy chose Cooper {{to conduct a}} then-secret mission to Moscow and New Delhi to assess {{the attitudes of the}} Soviet government for the new administration. Kennedy and Cooper had served together on the Senate Labor Committee and maintained a social friendship. On the mission, Cooper discovered that the Soviets disliked Kennedy and Nixon equally. Cooper concluded in his report to Kennedy that there was little potential for harmonious relations with the Soviets. After meeting with Secretary Khruschev, Kennedy confirmed to Cooper that his report had been correct and confessed that he should <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>it</b> even more seriously. Cooper supported Kennedy's decision to resume nuclear weapons testing after the Soviets resumed their testing in March 1962, but he urged Kennedy to negotiate an agreement with the Soviets if possible.|$|E

25|$|Unable to {{find any}} trace of her any other way, Dyson and the classmate became {{concerned}} that Alexander might have fallen victim to a crime at some point since then. In August 2014, Hernando County sheriff's office told them no missing persons report had been filed. (Dyson, a child at the time, disputes this, saying her parents did indeed make a report, but speculates that given Tammy's history of running away and returning, police may not <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>it</b> seriously). They filed a new report.|$|E

25|$|The {{splitting}} of Army Group South {{enabled the}} launching of Operation Edelweiss and Operation Fischreiher, the two main thrusts of the Army Groups. Both groups had to achieve their objectives simultaneously, instead of consecutively. The success of the initial advance was such that Hitler ordered the Fourth Panzer Army south to assist the First Panzer Army to cross the lower Don river. This assistance was not needed and Kleist later complained that Fourth Panzer Army clogged the roads and {{that if they had}} carried on toward Stalingrad, they could <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>it</b> in July. When it turned north again two weeks later, the Soviets had gathered enough forces together at Stalingrad to check its advance.|$|E
25|$|He crushed one Umayyad army at Arles, as {{that force}} sallied {{out of the}} city, and then took the city itself by a direct and brutal frontal attack, and burned {{it to the ground}} to prevent its use again as a stronghold for Umayyad expansion. He then moved swiftly and {{defeated}} a mighty host outside of Narbonne at the River Berre, but failed to take the city. Military historians believe he could <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>it,</b> had he chosen to tie up all his resources to do so—but he believed his life was coming to a close, and he had much work to do to prepare for his sons {{to take control of the}} Frankish realm.|$|E
25|$|This is what McDonald thinks, {{but other}} historians such as Seán Duffy <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>it</b> {{to refer to}} Domhnall mac Raghnaill, the {{progenitor}} of Clan Donald. Alex Woolf argued that Donnchadh was probably too old at this stage to have been fighting in Ireland, and suggests that the probable identity of this man was Ruaídhrí mac Raghnaill. Sellar also believes that Donnchadh {{would have been too}} old, and also suggests identifying this man with Ruaidhrí mac Raghnaill. Donnchadh appeared in Scottish sources in 1237, and again, for the last time, in 1244, as one of the magnates whose names were attached to a letter from Alexander II to the Pope. His son Eóghan appears to have been fully in charge of the lordship by 1249, probably indicating that Donnchadh was dead by this point.|$|E

25|$|On October 15, 2014, five Uber {{drivers have}} been {{involved}} in a crackdown by the Road Transport Department (JPJ), under the Ops Teksi Uber 2014 operation – which began on October 1. The four other vehicles were returned to their respective owners – with their documents confiscated pending further investigation by the Land Public Transport Commission (SPAD). Due {{to a wide range of}} circumstances, the four vehicles could be returned to owners should proper documents and other factors correlate. On October 17, 2014, JPJ will continue its crackdown on drivers and cars affiliated to the personal driver app, which has been growing in popularity with urbanites. Despite the hiccup, the department suspects that Uber services are still available for loyal customers. Since October 2014, the Land Public Transport Commission has impounded 44 Uber vehicles, using many methods such as tracking the vehicles using Uber's app. It was also reported that some taxi drivers <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>it</b> upon themselves to nab Uber drivers and turn them over to the police.|$|E

500|$|In [...] "The Mythical World of Anthropology", Arens {{looks at}} {{the manner in which}} anthropologists have {{approached}} the idea of cultural cannibalism. Noting the widespread western idea that cannibals exist [...] "beyond the pale of civilization", in the land of savagery and primitivism, he argues that anthropologists <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>it</b> upon themselves to explain and rationalize the cannibalism of such [...] "primitives" [...] without first proving that they were cannibalistic to start with. He connects this to the attitude held by many westerners both past and present that they are the bearers of civilization who have helped {{to put a stop to}} cannibalism. Challenging and criticizing the anthropological community's long-term advocacy of what he considers the [...] "Man-Eating Myth", he draws comparisons with the belief in demonic witchcraft and cannibalism in Europe that led to the witch trials of the Early Modern period, ending his work on a quote from the historian Norman Cohn's book Europe's Inner Demons.|$|E
