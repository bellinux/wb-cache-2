During Ashmole's campaign his cousin, Thomas Smalridge, who was acting as a kind of campaign manager, fell ill and died. Ashmole did not visit the constituency, and, as Ashmole's own horoscope had predicted, he lost the election. He also put himself forward {{as a candidate}} in the general election of 1685. Surviving documents indicate that he was the most popular candidate, but after King James II requested he stand down (<b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>age</b> <b>when</b> monarchs were likely to interfere with parliamentary elections), Ashmole did so. On election day, all the votes cast for Ashmole, instead of being declared invalid, were declared as votes for the King's candidate, and only {{as a result of this}} ruse was the candidate favoured by the Court (Richard Leveson) elected.|$|E

25|$|Pinchot {{sought to}} turn public land policy from one that {{dispersed}} resources among private holdings, {{to one that}} maintained federal ownership and management of public land. As a progressive, Pinchot strongly believed in the efficiency movement. Waste was his great enemy, and he well knew {{the tragedy of the}} commons, the destruction of resources for short-term gains. His successes, in part, were grounded in the personal networks that he started developing as a student at Yale and continued developing throughout his career. His personal involvement in the recruitment process led to high morale in the Forest Service and allowed him to avoid partisan political patronage. Pinchot capitalized on his professional expertise to gain adherents <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>age</b> <b>when</b> professionalism and science were greatly valued.|$|E
25|$|He {{spent most}} of his career at the newly founded Dominican priory at Hereford. The Dominicans had been {{fighting}} for a foothold here for eighty years against the resistance of the Dean and Chapter, before they were finally established under the patronage of Edward II in 1322. Bromyard must therefore have been among the first friars to join the fledgeling priory. <b>In</b> <b>an</b> <b>age</b> <b>when</b> manuscript books were prohibitively expensive, it is likely that he embarked on the task of compiling preaching aids as a means of providing the priory with a library to support its preaching mission. The sheer volume of his work suggests that it may well have been produced by a collaborative process involving the other friars at the Hereford priory, with Bromyard acting as editor in chief.|$|E

25|$|The Rumford {{fireplace}} {{created a}} sensation in 1796 when Benjamin Thompson Rumford introduced {{the idea of}} restricting the chimney opening to increase the updraught. Rumford fireplaces were common from 1796, when Benjamin Rumford first wrote about them, until about 1850. Thomas Jefferson had them built at Monticello, and Henry David Thoreau listed them among the modern conveniences that everyone took for granted. Rumford and his workers changed fireplaces by inserting bricks into the hearth to make the side walls angled and added a choke to the chimney {{to increase the speed}} of air going up the flue. It produced a streamlined air flow, reducing turbulence so the smoke would go up into the chimney rather than choking the residents. Rumford fireplaces are appreciated for their tall classic elegance and heating efficiency. This simple alteration in the design of fireplaces were copied everywhere <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>age</b> <b>when</b> fires were the principal source of heat. The Rumford fireplace is still used in the 21st century.|$|E
25|$|In 382, the Emperor Gratian, a Christian, {{ordered the}} Altar of Victory {{removed from the}} Curia, the Roman Senate house in the Forum, and curtailed the sums {{annually}} allowed {{for the maintenance of}} the Vestal Virgins, and for the public celebration of sacred rites. Symmachus was chosen by the Senate on account of his eloquence to lead a delegation of protest, which the emperor refused to receive. Two years later, Gratian was assassinated in Lugdunum, and Symmachus, now urban prefect of Rome, addressed an elaborate epistle to Gratian's successor, Valentinian II, in a famous dispatch that was rebutted by Ambrose, the bishop of Milan. <b>In</b> <b>an</b> <b>age</b> <b>when</b> all religious communities credited the divine power with direct involvement in human affairs, Symmachus argues that the removal of the altar had caused a famine and its restoration would be beneficial in other ways.

500|$|The Red Rose of Lancaster {{derives from}} the gold rose badge of Edward I of England.

500|$|In {{the opinion}} of the jury of the Académie du Disque Français, [...] "Sir Thomas Beecham has done more for French music abroad than any French conductor". Berlioz {{featured}} prominently in Beecham's repertoire throughout his career, and <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>age</b> <b>when</b> the composer's works received little exposure, Beecham presented most of them and recorded many. Along with Sir Colin Davis, Beecham has been described as one of the two [...] "foremost modern interpreters" [...] of Berlioz's music. [...] Both in concert and the recording studio, Beecham's choices of French music were characteristically eclectic. He avoided Ravel but regularly programmed Debussy. Fauré did not feature often, although his orchestral Pavane was an exception; Beecham's final recording sessions in 1959 included the Pavane and the Dolly Suite. Bizet was among Beecham's favourites, and other French composers favoured by him included Gustave Charpentier, Delibes, Duparc, Grétry, Lalo, Lully, Offenbach, Saint-Saëns and Ambroise Thomas. [...] Many of Beecham's later recordings of French music were made in Paris with the Orchestre National de la Radiodiffusion Française.

500|$|One {{possibility}} is that, whilst Somairle {{may well have}} begun the planning of a Cistercian house at Saddell, it was actually Ragnall who provided it with its first endowments. Somairle's attempt to relocate Colum Cille's familia to Iona, however, was undertaken during an era when Cistercians were already established in Ireland and the Isles, which may be evidence that Somairle was something of an [...] "ecclesiastical traditionalist" [...] who found newer reformed orders of continental Christianity unpalatable. Whatever the case, the ecclesiastical activities of his immediate descendants, especially the foundations and endowments of Ragnall himself, reveal that the meic Somairle were not averse to such continental orders. During his career, Somairle waged war upon the Scots and perished in an invasion of Scotland proper, which could suggest that Ragnall's ecclesiastical activities were partly undertaken to improve relations with the King of Scots. Additionally, <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>age</b> <b>when</b> monasteries were often built by rulers as status symbols of their wealth and power, the foundations and endowments of Ragnall may have been undertaken {{as a means to}} portray himself as an up-to-date ruler.|$|E

500|$|The first Boden professor, Horace Hayman Wilson, {{was elected}} in 1832 and died on 8 May 1860. The {{election}} for his successor {{came at a time}} of public debate about the nature of British missionary work in India, particularly after the Indian Rebellion of 1857. The East India Company, which controlled the British territories until they were absorbed into the British Empire in 1858, had had a general policy until 1813 of non-interference with Indian customs, including religion. Christian missionaries required a licence to proselytize. In practice, most could operate without a licence, except for Evangelicals, who were regarded as too radical <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>age</b> <b>when</b> Christians from other backgrounds were more prepared to be tolerant of other faiths. As the Evangelical movement grew in strength, it pressed for greater efforts to bring Christianity to India, and so the company relaxed its approach to missionaries in 1813. After 1858, the British government was reluctant to provoke further unrest by interference with local traditions and religion, but many of those charged with running India were themselves Evangelicals sympathetic to efforts to convert the country. As Beckerlegge has commented, [...] "the furtherance of Christian mission had become inextricably bound up with attempts to define Britain's role in India and indeed to justify Britain's presence in India." [...] The issue was whether Britain was there simply to govern India or to [...] "civilise" [...] it, and if the latter, whether to draw up or destroy India's existing culture and religion. Many of those who supported increased missionary work in India, says Beckerlegge, regarded the events of 1857 as [...] "nothing less than a divine judgment" [...] on Britain's failure to bring Christianity to the country.|$|E

His feud with Archbishop Swayne weakened the authority of the Church; and his quarrel with Ormonde, which seems to have been largely personal, is generally agreed to have been <b>a</b> major factor <b>in</b> weakening English rule in Ireland. Even <b>in</b> <b>a</b> turbulent <b>age</b> <b>when</b> cases of assault and even murder were common enough it was notable that Talbot, despite his clerical office, was prepared to use violence: in 1442 he was accused of personally beating up two senior members of the Irish Council, Hugh Banent and Robert Dyke.|$|R
