5|$|In April 1766 {{parts of}} the town were {{destroyed}} by a fire and the Linnean private collection was subsequently moved to a barn outside the town, and shortly afterwards to a single-room stone building close to his country house at Hammarby near Uppsala. This resulted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>physical</b> separation between the two collections, the museum collection remained in the botanical garden of the university. Some material which needed special care (alcohol specimens) or ample storage space was moved from the private collection to the museum.|$|E

5|$|Physical {{examination}} {{of a patient}} with ankle OCD often returns symptoms of joint effusion, crepitus, and diffuse or localized tenderness. Examination often reveals symptoms of generalized joint pain, swelling, and times with limited range of motion. Some with loose body lesions may report catching, locking, or both. The possibility of microtrauma emphasizes a need for evaluation of biomechanical forces at the knee <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>physical</b> examination. As a result, the alignment and rotation of all major joints in the affected extremity is common, as are extrinsic and intrinsic abnormalities concerning the affected joint, including laxity.|$|E

5|$|Baron Hector Hulot is {{a living}} manifestation of male sexual desire, {{unrestrained}} and unconcerned with its consequences for the man or his family. As the novel progresses, he becomes consumed by his libido, even <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>physical</b> sense. When Valérie tells him to stop dyeing his hair, he does so to please her. His financial woes and public disgrace lead him to flee his own home; {{by the end of}} the book he is an elderly, decrepit shell of a man. Baron Hulot is so overcome by his taste for female flesh that he even asks his wife– without irony– if he can bring home his fifteen-year-old mistress.|$|E
5|$|Each round {{began with}} a toss-up {{physical}} challenge in which both teams competed, with the winning team receiving both initial control of the round, and money for their score. After the toss-up, the host began asking trivia questions of the team in control. Each correct answer earned a monetary award, and allowed the team to maintain control, while an incorrect answer, or failure to respond within approximately ten seconds turned control over to the opponents. However, the team could dare their opponents to answer the question, doubling its value; in response, the opponents could double dare for quadruple the original value. When the team in control was challenged to a double dare, they had to either answer or compete <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>physical</b> challenge. An incorrect answer, or not responding within approximately five seconds on a dare or double dare, awarded both control and the appropriate {{amount of money to}} the team that issued it. The second round played the same as the first, with question values doubled. On Double Dare and Super Sloppy Double Dare, a question was initially worth $10. On Family Double Dare and Double Dare 2000, a question was initially worth $25.|$|E

5|$|Neorealism ("The {{world is}} made of {{ordinary}} objects.") Constructed by David Bohm and also associated with Louis de Broglie, this interpretation holds that quantum objects possess definite attributes, but that these attributes can change value instantly in response to events anywhere in the universe, with this information encoded <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>physical</b> pilot wave which {{must be able to}} travel faster than light. Other physicists attempted to construct object-based models which did away with this superluminal communication, but Bell's theorem later proved this to be impossible. For this reason, according to Herbert, neorealism is rejected by most of the physics establishment.|$|E
5|$|On June 29, 2009, Swagger {{was traded}} to the Raw brand, making his debut as part of a three-on-one {{gauntlet}} match against WWE Champion Randy Orton, in which he got himself purposely counted out in order to make an impression on Orton. On the July 13 episode of Raw, he won his first match on the brand by defeating Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP). He then feuded with MVP for several weeks, culminating at SummerSlam, in a match that MVP won. After his short feud with MVP ended, Swagger began pursuing the United States Championship. He had a title match on September 21 against Kofi Kingston but lost the match by countout after stealing the championship belt and leaving the arena with it but Kingston later took it back while Swagger was <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>physical</b> confrontation with The Miz. Swagger made another unsuccessful attempt at the title at Hell in a Cell in a triple threat match against Kingston and The Miz. At the Royal Rumble, Swagger entered at number 26 in the Royal Rumble match, but was later eliminated by Kofi Kingston.|$|E
5|$|After their 2010 separation, Berry and Aubry became {{involved}} in a highly publicized custody battle, centered primarily on Berry's desire to move with their daughter from Los Angeles, where Berry and Aubry resided, to France, the home of French actor Olivier Martinez, whom Berry had started dating in 2010 after they met while filming Dark Tide in South Africa. Aubry objected to the move {{on the grounds that}} it would interfere with their joint custody arrangement. In November 2012, a judge denied Berry's request to move the couple's daughter to France in light of Aubry's objections. Less than two weeks later, on November 22, 2012, Aubry and Martinez were both treated at a hospital for injuries after engaging <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>physical</b> altercation at Berry's residence. Martinez performed a citizen's arrest on Aubry, and because it was considered a domestic violence incident, was granted a temporary emergency protective order preventing Aubry from coming within 100 yards of Berry, Martinez, the child with whom he shares custody with Berry, until November 29, 2012. In turn, Aubry obtained a temporary restraining order against Martinez on November 26, 2012, asserting that the fight began when Martinez threatened to kill Aubry if he did not allow the couple to move to France. Leaked court documents included photos showing significant injuries to Aubry's face, which were widely displayed in the media.|$|E

5|$|Following the Olympics, Brooks was {{expelled}} from the Australian Institute of Sport by Don Talbot for disciplinary reasons. He accepted a swimming scholarship at the University of Arkansas, where he enjoyed the more liberal disciplinary standards. He returned to Australia for the 1982 Commonwealth Games in Brisbane and again raised the ire of officials during a preparatory training camp. After lobbying for improved accommodation conditions, Brooks was involved <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>physical</b> altercation with the team manager. As a result, {{he was given a}} suspension that was to take effect after the Commonwealth Games. However, his teammates protested and threatened to walk out, resulting in the ban being rescinded. Despite the turbulent preparation, Brooks had a successful meet, winning the 100m freestyle and anchoring the 4100m freestyle and medley relays to gold medals. Brooks competed at his second Olympics in Los Angeles in 1984 Games, where he won silver in the 4100m freestyle relay and bronze for swimming the heats of the medley relay. Brooks' international career ended at the 1986 Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh with silver in the 100m freestyle and gold in the freestyle relay. Brooks retired after being suspended for his drinking binge during the return trip. He later became a swimming commentator but was sacked in 1998 after a disciplinary incident.|$|E
