6000|$|... 28. Now for {{comparison}} with this old art, {{here is a}} modern engraving, in which color is entirely ignored; and light and shade alone are used to produce what {{is supposed to be}} a piece of impressive religious instruction. But it is not a piece of religious instruction at all;--only a piece of religious sensation, prepared for the sentimental pleasure of young ladies; whom (since <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>honored</b> to-day by the presence of many) I will take the opportunity of warning against such forms of false theological satisfaction. This engraving represents a young lady in a very long and, though plain, very becoming white dress, tossed upon the waves of a terrifically stormy sea, by which neither her hair nor her becoming dress is in the least wetted; and saved from despair in that situation by closely embracing a very thick and solid stone Cross. By which far-sought and original metaphor young ladies are expected, after some effort, to understand the recourse they may have, for support, to the Cross of Christ, in the midst of the troubles of this world.|$|E
