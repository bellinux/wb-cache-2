40|$|International audienceInteractions between biomolecules and {{inorganic}} surfaces play {{an important}} role in natural environments and in industry, including a wide variety of conditions: marine environment, ship hulls (fouling), water treatment, heat exchange, membrane separation, soils, mineral particles at the earth's surface, <b>hospitals</b> (<b>hygiene),</b> art and buildings (degradation and biocorrosion), paper industry (fouling) and more. To better control the first steps leading to adsorption of a biomolecule on an inorganic surface, it is mandatory to understand the adsorption mechanisms of biomolecules of several sizes at the atomic scale, that is, the nature of the chemical interaction between the biomolecule and the surface and the resulting biomolecule conformations once adsorbed at the surface. This remains a challenging and unsolved problem. Here, we review the state of art in experimental and theoretical approaches. We focus on metallic biomaterial surfaces such as TiO(2) and stainless steel, mentioning some remarkable results on hydroxyapatite. Experimental techniques include atomic force microscopy, surface plasmon resonance, quartz crystal microbalance, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, fluorescence microscopy, polarization modulation infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy, sum frequency generation and time of flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy.

40|$|Abstract Background Many Highly Resistant Gram Negative Rod (HR-GNR) {{positive}} {{patients are}} found unexpectedly in clinical cultures, besides {{patients who are}} screened and isolated based on risk factors. As unexpected HR-GNR positive patients are isolated after detection, transmission to contact patients possibly occurred. The added value of routine contact tracing in such situations within <b>hospitals</b> with standard <b>hygiene</b> precautions is unknown. Methods In 2014, this study was performed as a prospective cohort study. Index patients were defined as those tested unexpectedly HR-GNR positive in clinical cultures to diagnose a possible infection and were nursed under standard hygiene precautions before tested positive. After detection they were nursed in contact isolation. Contact patients were still hospitalized and shared {{the same room with}} the index patient for at least 12  h. HR-GNR screening was performed by culturing a rectal and throat swab. Clonal relatedness of HR-GNR isolates was determined using whole genome sequencing (WGS). Results Out of 152 unexpected HR-GNR positive patients, 35 patients (23. 0 %) met our inclusion criteria for index patient. ESBL E. coli was found most frequently (n =  20, 57. 1 %), followed by Q&A E. coli (n =  10, 28. 6 %), ESBL K. pneumoniae (n =  3, 8. 5 %), ESBL R. ornithinolytica (n =  1, 2. 9 %) and multi resistant P. aeruginosa (n =  1, 2. 9 %). After contact tracing, 69 patients were identified as contact patient of an index patient, with a median time between start of contact and sampling of 3 days. None were found HR-GNR positive by nosocomial transmission. Conclusions In a local setting within <b>hospitals</b> with standard <b>hygiene</b> precautions, routine contact tracing among unexpected HR-GNR positive patients may be replaced by appropriate surveillance as we found no nosocomial transmission in short term contacts...|$|R

40|$|In {{view of the}} Walkerton calamity,the anthrax scare in the United States and {{the threat}} of {{chemical}} and biological warfare, I think we should look again at the education of physi-cians in the specialty of community (public) health. When I joined the Toronto School of Hygiene in 1956 the program cov-ered 10 subjects: chemistry in relation to hygiene and sanitation, epidemiology and biometrics, <b>hospital</b> administration, <b>hygiene</b> and preventive medicine, viral infections, experimental cytology, para-sitology, physiological hygiene, public health administration and public health nutrition. At the time, the Diploma in Public Health program in microbiology was the best in the country. When the Master of Health Sciences degree was established at the University of Toronto in 1979, training in micro-biology disappeared. I submit that this was a mistake. Physicians who specialize in public health should be well ac-quainted with all agents of disease, be they biological, chemical, social or envi-ronmental. They should know about the effects of war, famine and natural disasters. Public health is not merely an exercise in statistics and administration. The skeleton of a school of public health exists at the University of Toronto.
