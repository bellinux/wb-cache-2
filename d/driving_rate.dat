40|$|We {{study the}} {{influence}} of the <b>driving</b> <b>rate</b> in the two-dimensional Oslo rice pile model. We find that the usual power-law behavior of the avalanche size distribution still holds for small avalanches, independent of the <b>driving</b> <b>rate.</b> The signature of fast driving is, however, the increase of the incidence rate of large avalanches. For larger driving rates, this increase is more prominent and spreads to smaller avalanche sizes. As a result, the mass flow due to large avalanches is increased much more than would be expected from an increase in <b>driving</b> <b>rate</b> alone. Fast driving leads to a dramatic increase in devastating avalanches, just before the continuous flow regime is reached. © 2008 The American Physical Society...|$|E

40|$|The {{paradigm}} of self-organized criticality (SOC) has found application in understanding scaling and bursty transport in driven, dissipative plasmas. SOC is, however, a limiting process that occurs as {{the ratio of}} <b>driving</b> <b>rate</b> to dissipation rate is taken to zero. We consider the more realistic scenario of finite <b>driving</b> <b>rate.</b> Similarity analysis reveals {{that there is a}} control parameter R-A which is analogous to the Reynolds number R-E of turbulence in that it relates to the number of excited degrees of freedom, that is, the range of spatio-temporal scales over which one finds scaling behaviour. However for avalanching systems the number of excited degrees of freedom is maximal at the zero <b>driving</b> <b>rate,</b> SOC limit, in the opposite sense to fluid turbulence. Practically, at finite R-E or R-A one observes scaling over a finite range which for turbulence, increases with R-E and for SOC, decreases with increasing R-A, suggesting an observable trend to distinguish them. We use the BTW sandpile model to explore this idea and find that whilst avalanche distributions can, depending on the details of the driving, reflect this behaviour, power spectra do not and thus are not clear discriminators of an SOC state...|$|E

40|$|The field-driven {{magnetisation}} reversal {{processes in}} disordered systems exhibit a collective behaviour that is {{manifested in the}} scale-invariance of avalanches, closely related to underlying dynamical mechanisms. Using the multifractal time series analysis, we study the structure of fluctuations at different scales in the accompanying Barkhausen noise. The stochastic signal represents the magnetisation discontinuities along the hysteresis loop of a 3 -dimensional random field Ising model simulated for varied disorder strength and <b>driving</b> <b>rates.</b> The analysis of the spectrum of the generalised Hurst exponents reveals that the segments of the signal with large fluctuations represent two distinct classes of stochastic processes in weak and strong pinning regimes. Furthermore, increased <b>driving</b> <b>rates</b> {{have a profound effect}} on the small fluctuation segments and broadening of the spectrum. The study of the temporal correlations, sequences of avalanches, and their scaling features complements the quantitative measures of the collective dynamics at the hysteresis loop. The multifractal properties of Barkhausen noise describe the dynamical state of domains and precisely discriminate the weak pinning, permitting the motion of individual walls, from the mechanisms occurring in strongly disordered systems. The multifractal nature of the reversal processes is particularly relevant for currently investigated memory devices that utilize a controlled motion of individual domain walls.

Recognizing the probability P_ 1 as a distribution of service time of jobs arriving at a server with frequency r, the model represents a new example of the server queue in the queue theory.

40|$|Quantum {{adiabatic}} {{evolution is}} a dynamical {{evolution of a}} quantum system under slow external driving. According to the quantum adiabatic theorem, no transitions occur between non-degenerate instantaneous eigen-energy levels in such a dynamical evolution. However, this is true only when the <b>driving</b> <b>rate</b> is infinitesimally small. For a small nonzero <b>driving</b> <b>rate,</b> there are generally small transition probabilities between the energy levels. We develop a classical mechanics framework to address the small deviations from the quantum adiabatic theorem order by order. A hierarchy of Hamiltonians are constructed iteratively with the zeroth-order Hamiltonian being determined by the original system Hamiltonian. The $k$th-order deviations are governed by a $k$th-order Hamiltonian, which depends on the time derivatives of the adiabatic parameters up to the $k$th-order. Two simple examples, the Landau-Zener model and a spin- 1 / 2 particle in a rotating magnetic field, are used to illustrate our hierarchical theory. Our analysis also exposes a deep, previously unknown connection between classical adiabatic theory and quantum adiabatic theory. Comment: 10 pages, 6 figures, 29 reference...|$|E
