5|$|In 1961, an {{overwhelming}} majority of voters in the TID and MID service areas and San Francisco approved bond issues to finance {{the construction of a new}} dam. The irrigation districts hoped to complete the dam by 1966, but concerns that the dam would further impact decreasing populations of king salmon in the Tuolumne put a temporary stop to the project. In fact, it was not until that year that the Federal Power Commission (now <b>Federal</b> <b>Energy</b> <b>Regulatory</b> Commission) licensed the irrigation districts to go ahead on New Don Pedro.|$|E

When the reservoir's elevation exceeds , control of the dam's discharges are transferred to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) who manage flood control in the larger basin. By federal regulation, the GRDA and the Corps of Engineers often coordinate discharges and reservoir levels.|$|E

25|$|According to the {{subsequent}} <b>Federal</b> <b>Energy</b> <b>Regulatory</b> Commission's investigation and report, numerous energy trading companies, many based in Texas, such as Enron Corporation, illegally restricted their {{supply to the}} point where the spikes in power usage would cause blackouts. Rolling blackouts affecting 97,000 customers hit the San Francisco Bay area on June 14, 2000 and San Diego Gas & Electric Company filed a complaint alleging market manipulation by some energy producers in August 2000. On December 7, 2000, suffering from low supply and idled power plants, the California Independent System Operator (CAISO), which manages the California power grid, declared the first statewide Stage 3 power alert, meaning power reserves were below 3 percent. Rolling blackouts were avoided when the state halted two large state and federal water pumps to conserve electricity.|$|E
