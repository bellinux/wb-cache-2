25|$|In 1986, Nintendo {{released}} the Famicom Disk System (FDS) in Japan, {{a type of}} floppy drive that uses a single-sided, proprietary 5cm (2") disk and plugs into the cartridge port. It contains RAM for the game to load into and an extra single-cycle wavetable-lookup sound chip. The disks were originally obtained from kiosks in malls and other public places where buyers could select a title and have it written to the disk. This process would cost less than cartridges and users could take the <b>disk</b> <b>back</b> to a vending booth and have it rewritten with a new game.

5000|$|Two {{types of}} attack {{scenarios}} exist {{in which it}} is possible to maliciously take advantage of this bootkit: in the first one, the user is required to launch the bootkit with administrative privileges once the PC has already booted into Windows; in the second one, analogously to hardware keyloggers, a malicious person needs physical access to the user's TrueCrypt-encrypted hard disk: in this context this is needed to modify the user's TrueCrypt MBR with that of the Stoned bootkit and then place the hard <b>disk</b> <b>back</b> on the unknowing user's PC, so that when the user boots the PC and types his/her TrueCrypt password on boot, the [...] "Stoned" [...] bootkit intercepts it thereafter because, from that moment on, the Stoned bootkit is loaded before TrueCrypt's MBR in the boot sequence. The first type of attack can be prevented as usual by good security practices, e.g. avoid running non-trusted executables with administrative privileges. The second one can be successfully neutralized by the user if he/she suspects that the encrypted hard disk might have been physically available to someone he/she does not trust, by booting the encrypted operating system with TrueCrypt's Rescue Disk instead of booting it directly from the hard disk. With the rescue disk, the user can restore TrueCrypt's MBR to the hard disk.|$|E
5000|$|Pete is {{featured}} in the Wii game, Epic Mickey. Once again with his titular peg-leg, he first appears in the Gremlin Village as Small Pete (based on It's a Small World ride at Disneyland), he appears dressed {{as one of the}} Dutch girl dolls of the ride. He later appears as his usual self in Mean Street (based on Main Street USA), where he informs Mickey that there are many other Petes throughout the world, each themed differently depending on the zone in the game, like appearing in a Sark outfit in Tomorrow City as Petetronic and in Ventureland as Pete Pan. Pete himself (referred to as [...] "Big Bad Pete"), acts as a self-appointed enforcer of sorts at Mean Street and is often a source of quests for the player. In Tomorrow City, which is inspired by Tomorrowland, the Sark-esque Petetronic is the boss of the level, attacking with thrown buckets of thinner, shaking the ground, and throwing his ID disk. The only way to attack Petetronic is to deflect his <b>disk</b> <b>back</b> at him which will stun him and expose his back side. Mickey can then squirt him with paint, which turns him blue and friendly, or thinner, which short-circuits him and reduces him to a MCP-like entity. In Ventureland, Pete appears as a jolly, bubbly version of himself known as [...] "Pete Pan", named after Peter Pan, who is trapped on Skull Island until Mickey can manage to save the sprite so Pete Pan can fight off the robot version of Captain Hook like he used to. The Petes return in the sequel, Epic Mickey 2: The Power of Two, initially appearing as allies to the protagonists (except Pete Pan, who has allied with the Mad Doctor after Hook disappeared), Mickey and Oswald. However, {{by the end of the}} game, they leave with Prescott, presumably having plans for him. In the 3DS title Epic Mickey: Power of Illusion, three types of Pete enemies appear. The first type are Thwomp-like enemies with Pete's face emblazoned on it. Mickey can use this enemy to his advantage by using a sketch of it. The second type resembles his appearance in the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse. This time, Pete uses brute strength in order to fight Mickey. The third and final type uses a spiked shell to attack Mickey. Mickey can only defeat him by using a spin attack and then a jump attack.|$|E

40|$|Case StudyA 2500 HP {{integral}} gear compressor in an {{air separation}} plant experienced an impeller failure {{in the first stage}} of compression. The failure was extensive and took the dry air compressor off-line. Plant production was curtailed for several weeks. Initial investigation focused on the 1 st stage centrifugal compressor impeller and upstream dust filter. Most of the aluminum impeller was missing and portions of the air filter element had melted. With the sequence and cause unclear, a formal root cause analysis (RCA) was undertaken. The RCA process ultimately revealed that an unexpected thermite reaction occurred and consumed most of the aluminum impeller. During compressor shutdown, products of the intensely exothermic thermite reaction backflowed into the upstream dust filter causing the element to partially melt. The thermite reaction initiated in the impeller <b>back</b> <b>disk</b> seal area where metal oxides and fuel (debris) had collected. Viscous heating and temperatures greater than expected allowed the rotating labyrinth seal to creep. Contact with the babbitted stationary seal generated additional heat and further accelerated the creep process. Frictional heating in the impeller <b>back</b> <b>disk</b> seal initiated the reaction. Corrective actions to prevent reoccurrence included a creep resistant impeller <b>back</b> <b>disk</b> seal and a passive debris removal system to prevent debris particles from collecting in the impeller <b>back</b> <b>disk</b> seal area. This compressor and a twin have operating reliably since 2003. Recent inspection revealed neither <b>back</b> <b>disk</b> seal creep no the collection of debris particles.

40|$|Abstract — The {{peer to peer}} {{architecture}} {{model is}} widely used today for distributed systems deployment, which is increasingly becoming used {{as a model for}} <b>disk</b> <b>back</b> up systems. Currently, popular peer to peer back up systems use replication to ensure data redundancy, imposing a significant burden on system resources such as storage. Could the technique of erasure coding constitute a more suitable data redundancy scheme for such systems? In this paper we explore the prospect of deploying erasure coding in a peer to peer back up system and analyze how it performs against replication. Erasure coding and replication are compared in terms of CPU and network utilization, storage overhead, fault tolerance, end to end delay, and scalability. In addition to the performance analysis we also determine the turning point between erasure coding and replication with regard to peer availability. We provide suggestions for erasure coding parameters with respect to peer availability and file size based on this analysis. I...|$|E

40|$|We {{show that}} the period {{clustering}} of anomalous X-ray pulsars (AXPs) and soft gamma-ray repeaters (SGRs), their X-ray luminosities, ages, and statistics can be explained with fall <b>back</b> <b>disks</b> with large initial specific angular momentum. The disk evolution models are developed by comparison to self-similar analytical models. The initial disk mass and angular momentum set the viscous timescale. An efficient torque, with (1 - omega(2) (*)) dependence on the fastness parameter omega(*), leads to period clustering in the observed AXP - SGR period range under {{a wide range of}} initial conditions. The timescale t(0) for the early evolution of the fall <b>back</b> <b>disk,</b> and the final stages of fall <b>back</b> <b>disk</b> evolution, when the disk becomes passive, are the crucial determinants of the evolution. The disk becomes passive at temperatures around 100 K, which provides a natural cutoff for the X-ray luminosity and defines the end of evolution in the observable AXP and SGR phase. This low value for the minimum temperature for active disk turbulence indicates that the fall <b>back</b> <b>disks</b> are active up to a large radius, greater than or similar to 10 (12) cm. We find that transient AXPs and SGRs are likely to be older than their persistent cousins. A fall <b>back</b> <b>disk</b> with mass transfer rates corresponding to the low quiescent X-ray luminosities of the transient sources in early evolutionary phases would have a relatively lower initial mass, such that the mass-flow rate in the disk is not sufficient for the inner disk to penetrate into the light cylinder of the young neutron star, making mass accretion onto the neutron star impossible. The transient AXP phase therefore must start later. The model results imply that the transient AXP/SGRs, although older, are likely to be similar in number to persistent sources. This is because the X-ray luminosities of AXPs and SGRs are found to decrease faster {{at the end of their}} evolution, and the X-ray luminosities of transient AXP and SGRs in quiescence lie in the luminosity range of X-ray cutoff phase. Taking the range of quiescent X-ray luminosities of transient AXPs and SGRs similar to 10 (33) - 10 (34) erg s(- 1), our simulations imply that the duration of the cutoff phase is comparable to the lifetime in the persistent phase for a large range of initial conditions...|$|R
