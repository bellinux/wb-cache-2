5|$|This is an escapist anthem {{about leaving}} {{wherever}} you're stuck, <b>getting</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> car, whacking some amazing {{music on the}} stereo and putting your foot down. In other words, it's still only when she's dancing that she feels this free, and it's still music making the people come together. It captures a brilliantly teenage sensation ("only music can save me from my shit life") but makes sense {{of it in a}} song that doesn't sound like she's trying too hard to be down with the kids... Real life is sometimes a bit more complicated than that, and sometimes freedom is about being able to leave the cunts behind to get on with their useless lives. And that's what this song is about.|$|E

It is {{achieved}} by scoring a goal, getting an assist, and <b>getting</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> fight, {{all in the same}} game. Namesake Gordie Howe himself only recorded two in his NHL career, as opposed to league leader Rick Tocchet, who accrued 18 Gordie Howe hat tricks.|$|E

He violently rapes her in a mini-suite room and takes photos after withdrawing.|$|E

After mistakenly getting into a fight with Rictor and Multiple Man and <b>getting</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> cheap shot on Rictor, he stole a car. With fellow X-Cell member Fatale, he attempted to flee, eventually hitting an open manhole (left open earlier in the day by Strong Guy and Wolfsbane) and causing the car to crash leaving Blob hanging from the car. When both of them ran afoul of Marrow, Blob was thrown from the car.|$|E

500|$|Perry {{was an avid}} and {{accomplished}} golfer; there was always time to try <b>getting</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> game of golf. [...] "Perry Como Putters" [...] were sold by MacGregor, each stamped with a Como facsimile autograph. His colleagues held an annual Perry Como Golf Tournament to honor him and his love for the game. Como's guests on the October 3, 1962, broadcast were Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer, and Gary Player. The four golfers played 18 holes for the cameras at Sands Point, New York, where the Comos made their home in the television years. Como also enjoyed fishing and he could be found out on his boat almost daily after {{the family moved to}} Florida. Perry's catches would usually {{turn out to be the}} Como family's dinners. Como also used his boat as a rehearsal hall with pre-recorded instrumental tapes sent to him by RCA Victor. Perry would work on material while he was waiting for the fish to bite. Having enjoyed golfing and fishing in the North Carolina mountains for several years, Como built a vacation home in Saluda, North Carolina, in 1980. He discouraged photos of his home, as it was his private place to get away from the celebrity life.|$|E
500|$|Since its airing, [...] "The Injury" [...] has {{received}} critical acclaim from television critics. The scene featuring Dwight crashing his car received specific attention. IGN ranked {{the scene with}} Dwight <b>getting</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> car accident as its seventh-best moment {{in the first two}} seasons, noting that [...] "he fact that this show can get such inspired and unusual comedy from what is essentially a puke joke is a testament to how clever The Office is." [...] Rolling Stone named the same scene as the twentieth-funniest in The Offices first three seasons. TV Squad's Michael Sciannamea said that [...] "The Injury" [...] was [...] "another solid episode" [...] and that the [...] "show gets better with each and every week." [...] M. Giant of Television Without Pity graded the episode with an [...] "A–". Francis Rizzo III from DVD Talk wrote positively of the episode and praised the performance of Rainn Wilson as Dwight and wrote that [...] "nothing he does compares" [...] to his performance in [...] "The Injury". He called Wilson's performance as Dwight [...] "flat-out strange" [...] and noted that the episode, along with several others, [...] "wouldn't be nearly as entertaining" [...] without his character. Mindy Kaling later stated in an interview that it was her favorite episode of the show that she had written. She later expanded that the entry's [...] "full-on loopy" [...] quality made it humorous. She noted that the episode was [...] "so funny to me, because what happened to [...] is so stupid." ...|$|E

The final sketch depicted Tony, Ed and Richard <b>getting</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> bus, replete with Vengaboys' song [...] "We Like to Party" [...] playing, before fading the broadcast out. Excluding this sketch, and the musical montage that preceded it, the final live sentence {{said on the}} show was, [...] "and here endeth the sizzle" [...] by Tony Martin. The final words heard were by John Howard: [...] "Oh no, that's not funny at all".|$|E
2500|$|The third single [...] "Stronger" [...] was {{released}} on November 13, 2000 and became the album's second highest-charting single in the United States, peaking at number eleven on the Billboard Hot 100 and {{number one on the}} Hot Single Sales. It reached number seven on the UK Singles Chart. Its music video sees Spears catching her boyfriend cheating on her at a futuristic turntable nightclub, driving off, <b>getting</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> wreck and singing in the rain, while the chair sequence in the video was inspired by Janet Jackson's video for [...] "The Pleasure Principle".|$|E
2500|$|Some {{varieties}} of penalties {{do not always}} require the offending team to play a man short. Concurrent five-minute major penalties in the NHL usually result from fighting. In the case of two players being assessed five-minute fighting majors, both the players serve five minutes without their team incurring a loss of player (both teams still have {{a full complement of}} players on the ice). This differs with two players from opposing sides getting minor penalties, at the same time or at any intersecting moment, resulting from more common infractions. In this case, both teams will have only four skating players (not counting the goaltender) until one or both penalties expire (if one penalty expires before the other, the opposing team gets a power play {{for the remainder of the}} time); this applies regardless of current pending penalties. However, in the NHL, a team always has at least three skaters on the ice. Thus, ten-minute misconduct penalties are served in full by the penalized player, but his team may immediately substitute another player on the ice unless a minor or major penalty is assessed in conjunction with the misconduct (a two-and-ten or five-and-ten). In this case, the team designates another player to serve the minor or major; both players go to the penalty box, but only the designee may not be replaced, and he is released upon the expiration of the two or five minutes, at which point the ten-minute misconduct begins. In addition, game misconducts are assessed for deliberate intent to inflict severe injury on an opponent (at the officials' discretion), or for a major penalty for a stick infraction or repeated major penalties. The offending player is ejected from the game and must immediately leave the playing surface (he does not sit in the penalty box); meanwhile, if an additional minor or major penalty is assessed, a designated player must serve out of that segment of the penalty in the box (similar to the above-mentioned [...] "two-and-ten"). In some rare cases, a player may receive up to nineteen minutes in penalties for one string of plays. This could involve receiving a four-minute double minor penalty, <b>getting</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> fight with an opposing player who retaliates, and then receiving a game misconduct after the fight. In this case, the player is ejected and two teammates must serve the double-minor and major penalties.|$|E
