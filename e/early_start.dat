5|$|Concerts and boxing matches {{eventually}} {{took their}} toll on the pitch. In 2008, late post-concert pitch renovation, combined with an <b>early</b> <b>start</b> to the football season, led to the pitch not being ready for the first home fixture, causing the club to play its UEFA Cup first round qualifying match at Barnsley's Oakwell Stadium and a moratorium to be imposed on the staging of non-football events at Eastlands. In May 2010, the club invested in a new pitch and summer concerts resumed in 2011 when Take That played eight nights, with ticket sales totalling approximately 400,000.|$|E
5|$|Despite Lee's {{hope for}} an <b>early</b> <b>start,</b> {{it took all}} morning to arrange the {{infantry}} assault force. Neither Lee's nor Longstreet's headquarters sent orders to Pickett to have his division on the battlefield by daylight. Historian Jeffrey D. Wert blames this oversight on Longstreet, describing it either as a misunderstanding of Lee's verbal order or a mistake. Some of the many criticisms of Longstreet's Gettysburg performance by the postbellum Lost Cause authors cite this failure as evidence that Longstreet deliberately undermined Lee's plan for the battle.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of Catherine's ukase of 1788, just as other nations were {{entering}} the maritime fur trade, the Russians had spent over 40 years establishing and expanding their maritime operations in North America. A number of colonies were being established over a large region stretching from the Aleutian Islands to Cook Inlet and Prince William Sound. Many ships sailed from Kamchatka to Alaska each year. The Russians not only had an <b>early</b> <b>start,</b> but they also controlled the habitats {{of the most valuable}} sea otters. The Kurilian, Kamchatkan, and Aleutian sea otters' fur was thicker, glossier, and blacker than those on the Northwest Coast and California. The four grades of fur were based on color, texture, and thickness. The most prized furs were those of Kurilian and Kamchatkan sea otters, Aleutian furs were second grade, those of the Northwest Coast third, and the poorest grade was those of Californian sea otters. Russia also controlled the sources of sable furs, the most valuable fur-bearing land mammal.|$|E

Hans Gatt won the 2010 race with the fastest finish in Yukon Quest history: 9days and 26minutes. That race was marked by good weather, and few mushers dropped out. In 2011, conditions returned to normal, as violent storms blasted the trail and mushers {{during the second half}} of the race. Only 13 of the 25 competitors completed the race, tying the record for fewest finishers. In 2013, poor trail conditions over American Summit forced the Dawson to Eagle section of the course to be rerouted over the Yukon River.|$|E
5|$|The 1996–97 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone {{season was}} the longest on record, with both an unusually <b>early</b> <b>start</b> and unusually late ending. Most {{activity}} was from November through February. According to the Météo-France office (MFR) at Réunion, there were 21 tropical disturbances, 14 of which intensified into tropical depressions. There were 12named storms, beginning with Antoinette and proceeding sequentially until Lisette. In addition, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center also warned on storms in the region, which identified five other tropical storms. Five of the storms attained tropical cyclone status, or with 10minute maximum sustained winds of at least 120km/h (75mph); of these, three strengthened further into intense tropical cyclones, with Daniella and Helinda tied for strongest storm of the season.|$|E
5|$|The flight muscles {{need to be}} kept at a {{suitable}} temperature for the dragonfly {{to be able to}} fly. Being cold-blooded, they can raise their temperature by basking in the sun. Early in the morning, they may choose to perch in a vertical position with the wings outstretched, while {{in the middle of the}} day, a horizontal stance may be chosen. Another method of warming up used by some larger dragonflies is wing-whirring, a rapid vibration of the wings that causes heat to be generated in the flight muscles. The green darner (Anax junius) is known for its long-distance migrations, and often resorts to wing-whirring before dawn to enable it to make an <b>early</b> <b>start.</b>|$|E

Michael Schumacher started to trade fastest laps with Coulthard on lap four as Villeneuve maintained third position but was holding up the drivers {{in the next four}} positions who were behind him. Button's engine began to develop problems as Fisichella was passed by Verstappen for tenth on the same lap. As Michael Schumacher and Coulthard continued their battle up front, the stewards informed the McLaren team on lap ten that Coulthard would serve a ten-second stop-go penalty as his mechanics worked on his car 15 seconds before the formation lap begun. On the 13th lap, Ralf Schumacher overtook Herbert to take 12th position. Coulthard took his penalty on lap 14 and rejoined in tenth place. Herbert made a pit stop with an gearbox issue on the same lap and became the first retirement of the race. Häkkinen attempted to pass Barrichello on lap 16 although he overshot the manoeuvre.|$|E
5|$|In 2008 Manchester City {{once again}} {{qualified}} for the UEFA Cup through the Fair Play rankings. As City had to play the qualifying rounds, it meant a very <b>early</b> <b>start</b> to the season, in mid-July. Their first match was {{a trip to the}} remote Faroe Islands to play EB/Streymur. As Streymur's ground had a capacity of only 1,000, the match was moved to Tórsvøllur, the Faroese national stadium. Two early goals gave City a 2–0 win. The home leg was unusual in that it was played outside Manchester. The pitch at the City of Manchester Stadium had been relaid following a Bon Jovi concert, and was not ready in time. Instead, the match was played at Barnsley's Oakwell ground. Another 2–0 win resulted in a 4–0 aggregate scoreline. In the second qualifying round City played FC Midtjylland. The first leg ended in a 1–0 defeat, only City's second ever home defeat in European competition. In the second leg City looked to be heading out of the competition until an 89th minute cross was diverted into his own net by Midtjylland's Danny Califf. The tie then went to extra time, and City progressed on penalties. In the first round proper Cypriots AC Omonia took the lead, but City overcame the deficit and won 2–1, and also won the second leg by the same scoreline.|$|E
5|$|The loss of {{surprise}} {{due to the}} <b>early</b> <b>start</b> of the First Phase Campaign greatly disappointed Mao. Nevertheless, Mao still urged Peng to destroy the South Koreans by baiting them with trapped ROK units. At the same time, Major General Yu Jai Hung, commander of the ROK II Corps, sent the ROK 19th Infantry Regiment of the ROK 6th Infantry Division (under Colonel Park Kwang Hyuk) and the ROK 10th Infantry Regiment of the ROK 8th Infantry Division (under Colonel Go Geun Hong) to recapture Onjong and to salvage the lost equipment from the battle. The ROK 7th Infantry Regiment, {{under the command of}} Colonel Im Pu Taek, was also ordered to retreat south with the ROK 6th Infantry Division. Hoping to draw the rest of the ROK II Corps into the open, Peng ordered the PVA 118th Division to swing north and to trap the retreating ROK 7th Infantry Regiment, while the PVA 119th and the 120th Division of the 40th Corps would wait to ambush any rescue forces passing through Onjong. On October 27, the PVA 118th Division isolated the ROK 7th Infantry Regiment by cutting the road between Kojang and Onjong, but the ROK 7th Infantry Regiment did not reach the roadblock {{due to the lack of}} fuel. Upon realizing that the ROK II Corps had not fallen for the deception, Peng ordered the 119th and the 120th Divisions to destroy the ROK 10th and 19th Infantry Regiment. On the night of October 28, the ambush by the two Chinese divisions quickly decimated the advancing ROK regiments at the east of Onjong, and the Chinese roadblocks in the rear areas forced the South Korean soldiers to abandon all vehicles and artillery in order to escape.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to {{elucidate}} the impact of <b>earlier</b> school <b>start</b> times on elementary school children. Research demonstrates that adolescents are chronically sleep deprived due to shifting biological rhythms and <b>early</b> school <b>start</b> times. As a result, some schools have restructured their schedules to allow for later start times for {{middle and high school}} students. This change has inadvertently resulted in <b>earlier</b> <b>start</b> times for the elementary school students. Although studies demonstrate a positive impact of later start times for adolescents, no studies have examined younger children. This project, therefore, examined the effect of an <b>earlier</b> <b>start</b> time on the sleep patterns of elementary school students, as well as assessed correlations between sleep and cognitive functioning. Two groups of second graders (an experimental and control group) were followed for one-year; one experienced an <b>earlier</b> school <b>start</b> time in third grade, and the other did not. Measures of actigraphy and survey data were obtained. Results demonstrated that changing to an <b>earlier</b> school <b>start</b> time may cause school-aged children to obtain less quality of sleep, and experience a higher rate of daytime sleepiness. Because of the limited sample size included in this study, results are dependent on a larger scale experiment which will be completed within the next year...|$|R

40|$|Global {{temperature}} is increasing, {{and this is}} affecting the vegetation phenology {{in many parts of}} the world. In Fennoscandia, as well as Northern Europe, the advances of phenological events in spring have been recorded in recent decades. In this study, we analyzed the start of the growing season within five different vegetation regions in Fennoscandia using the 30 -year Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS) NDVI 3 g dataset. We applied a previously developed pixel-specific Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) threshold method, adjusted it to the NDVI 3 g data and analyzed trends within the different regions. Results show a warming trend with an <b>earlier</b> <b>start</b> of the growing season of 11. 8 ± 2. 0 days (p < 0. 01) for the whole area. However, there are large regional differences, and the warming/trend towards an <b>earlier</b> <b>start</b> of the growing season is most significant in the southern regions (19. 3 ± 4. 7 days, p < 0. 01 in the southern oceanic region), while the start was stable or modest earlier (two to four days; not significant) in the northern regions. To look for temporal variations in the trends, we divided the 30 -year period into three separate decadal time periods. Results show significantly more change/trend towards an <b>earlier</b> <b>start</b> of the growing season in the first period compared to the two last. In the second and third period, the trend towards an <b>earlier</b> <b>start</b> of the growing season slowed down, and in two of the regions, the trend towards an <b>earlier</b> <b>start</b> of the growing season was even reversed during the last decade. phenology; start of the growing season; NDVI time series; NDVI 3 g; Fennoscandia; vegetation regions; temporal trend...|$|R
