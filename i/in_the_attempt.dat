5|$|Against this {{background}} the negotiations for the Treaty of Amiens started in October 1801. The minor {{participants in the}} negotiations between Great Britain and France (the Batavian Republic and Spain) were immediately presented with faits accomplis: the preliminary agreement ceded Ceylon, and guaranteed free English shipping to the Cape of Good Hope, without the Dutch even being consulted. The Dutch ambassador in France, Schimmelpenninck, who acted as the Dutch plenipotentiary, vainly protested that the Treaty of The Hague had guaranteed the Dutch colonies, and that France had promised {{not to make a}} separate peace. After this separate peace had been concluded, the British were left to negotiate with the minor French allies separately. This did not mean that the Dutch were completely left to their own devices: whenever French interests seemed to be in danger, France decisively intervened on its own behalf, as <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>attempt</b> to deduct the value of the Dutch fleet, surrendered in 1799, that the British had purchased from the Stadtholder, from the indemnification of the Prince of Orange.|$|E
5|$|Blood Knights {{takes place}} in a fictional version of Earth in which humans and vampires are at war. The main character, Jeremy, is the captain of a holy order that fights vampires. At the {{beginning}} of the game, the order travels to a set of ruins to protect the Blood Seal, a powerful artifact, from being captured by the vampires. The order suffers heavy losses <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>attempt,</b> and in desperation the priest Bartholomew uses a ritual to bind Jeremy to the vampire Alysa. During the course of Jeremy's attempt to retrieve the seal, he is turned into a vampire, and the vampires seize the seal themselves. With the seal removed from its resting place, the moon begins to crack apart, causing unpredictable and violent tides. Because Jeremy {{has been turned into a}} vampire himself, Bartholomew and another member of the holy order, Castello, kick Jeremy and Alysa into an abyss inside the ruins, abandoning them for dead. Castello assumes Jeremy's place as the captain of the order.|$|E
5|$|Canopus {{was sent}} in August 1803 {{to join the}} Mediterranean Fleet, based off Toulon under Nelson. Conn was succeeded in February 1805 by Captain Francis Austen, and Canopus became the {{flagship}} of Rear-Admiral Thomas Louis. Canopus narrowly missed being present at the Battle of Trafalgar, having been sent to Gibraltar with Louis's squadron to resupply. She returned to Britain in mid-1806, where she was taken in hand at Plymouth for repairs, which were completed in August {{at a cost of}} £31,804. In January 1806 she joined Vice-Admiral Sir John Thomas Duckworth's squadron in the pursuit of Corentin Urbain Leissègues, and took part in the Battle of San Domingo on 6 February, engaging the 74-gun Diomède among other ships. Canopus sustained casualties of eight dead and 22 wounded. Thomas Shortland became captain of Canopus in July 1806, and sailed to the Mediterranean with Duckworth's squadron, still flying Louis's flag. She took part <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>attempt</b> to force the Dardanelles on 19 January, and in subsequent operations in support of the Alexandria expedition, during which nine Turkish vessels were captured or destroyed.|$|E

5|$|Captain Thomas Thompson on Leander {{initially}} {{tried to}} escape the much larger French ship, but it rapidly became clear that Généreux was faster than his vessel. At 09:00 the ships exchanged broadsides, the engagement continuing until 10:30, when Captain Louis-Jean-Nicolas Lejoille made an unsuccessful attempt to board Leander, suffering heavy casualties <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>attempt.</b> For another five hours the battle continued, Thompson successfully raking Généreux at one stage but ultimately being outfought and outmanoeuvered by the larger warship. Eventually the wounded Thompson surrendered his dismasted ship by ordering his men to wave a French tricolour on a pike. As French sailors took possession of the British ship, Lejoille encouraged systematic looting of the sailors' personal possessions, even confiscating the surgeon's tools {{in the middle of}} an operation. Against the established conventions of warfare, he forced the captured crew to assist in bringing Leander safely into Corfu, and denied them food and medical treatment unless they co-operated with their captors.|$|E
5|$|Dartnell {{offered his}} {{services}} to the British Army on {{the outbreak of the}} First World War, and was commissioned into the 25th (Frontiersmen) Battalion, Royal Fusiliers in February 1915. He fought in the East African Campaign and was mentioned in despatches for the Battle of Bukoba, where he had stormed the German-held town hall, pulled down the German flag and replaced it with the Union Jack. On 3 September 1915, after his company had been ambushed and despite being wounded, Dartnell voluntarily stayed behind in an attempt to save the lives of wounded men as the remainder of the British force retired from the scene. Dartnell was killed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>attempt,</b> but in recognition of his determination and sacrifice he was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross.|$|E
5|$|Despite the setbacks, {{the units}} {{assembled}} with only slight casualties but the changing circumstances at Arnhem meant that their roles were quickly changed.

Hicks' decision to send the 11th Parachute Battalion to Arnhem (thus weakening the 4th Parachute Brigade) dismayed Hackett, who remonstrated with Hicks to no avail. However, he was given command of the King's Own Scottish Borderers who were moving toward LZ 'L' to secure it for Tuesday's landing. The 10th and 156th Parachute Battalions moved north of the railway line to take up their planned defensive positions north west of Arnhem but the leading elements of 156th Parachute Battalion made contact with the main 9th SS blocking line after dark and withdrew for the night.|$|E

5|$|Discus {{is one of}} {{the events}} where the athlete has to throw a heavy disc <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>attempt</b> to mark a farther {{distance}} than their competitors. As one of the events within the ancient pentathlon, the history of the discus throw dates back to 708 BC. In ancient times a heavy circular disc was thrown from a set standing position on a small pedestal, and it was this style that was revived for the 1896 Olympics. This continued until the 1906 Intercalated Games in Athens, which featured both the ancient style and the increasingly popular modern style of turning and throwing. By the 1912 Olympics, the ancient standing throw style had fallen into disuse and contests starting within a 2.5m squared throwing area became the standard. The discus implement was standardised to 2kg (4.4pounds) in weight and 22cm (8inches) in diameter in 1907. The women's discus was among the first women's events on the Olympic programme, being introduced in 1928., although they had been competing at some national and regional levels previously.The first modern athlete to throw the discus while rotating the whole body was Czech athlete Frantisek Janda-Suk. He invented the technique when studying the position of the famous statue of Discobolus.|$|E

His action led to a reprimand from his employer, and may have hastened his conscription into the army in August 1917. In the army he was trained in the Zuffenhausen-garrisoned Infantry Regiment 126 and deployed to the Western Front as member of a machine gun company. In September 1918 a shell splinter penetrated his lungs. In the following weeks, he was treated in military hospitals in Weimar and in Stuttgart's neighbouring town Ludwigsburg. While in Ludwigsburg, Rau managed to get leave at short notice on 8November 1918 and joined the in those days developing revolution in Stuttgart.|$|E
5|$|Modern writers {{all agree}} that Andrée's North Pole scheme was unrealistic. He relied on the winds blowing {{more or less in}} the {{direction}} he wanted to go, on being able to fine-tune his direction with the drag ropes, on the balloon being sealed tight enough to stay airborne for 30 days, and on no ice or snow sticking to the balloon to weigh it down. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>attempt</b> of 1896, the wind immediately refuted his optimism by blowing steadily from the north, straight at the balloon hangar at Danes Island, until the expedition had to pack up, let the hydrogen out of the balloon, and go home. It is now known that northerly winds are to be expected at Danes Island; but in the late 19th century, information on Arctic airflow and precipitation existed only as contested academic hypotheses. Even Ekholm, an Arctic climate researcher, had no objection to Andrée's theory of where the wind was likely to take them. The observational data simply did not exist.|$|E
