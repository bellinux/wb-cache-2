But to {{wish you}} a good morning, in the pretty blue and white room where I had the {{pleasure}} to sit and read with you The Hermit, a poem which is such a favourite with me that I have read it twice this summer.

25|$|This case tho' {{depending}} upon a practice not common {{in this country}} {{is by no means a}} difficult one. I have no doubt but that the error complained of might have been corrected by the same court upon motion, at a subsequent term; but <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> for that reason reverse the judgment, since the party having preferred a writ of error coram vobis had a right to proceed in that way, tho' a shorter, and much less expensive mode might have been pursued.|$|E
25|$|According to Tacitus, {{the region}} was {{originally}} populated by the Celtic tribe of the Helvetii, but soon Germanic and Gaulish settlers arrived. Tacitus writes that: <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> reckon among the German tribes the cultivators of the tithe-lands , although they are settled on the further side of the Rhine and Danube. Reckless adventurers from Gaul, emboldened by want, occupied this land of questionable ownership. After a while, our frontier having been advanced, and our military positions pushed forward, it {{was regarded as a}} remote nook of our empire and a part of a Roman province.|$|E

Perhaps we may be fortunate. We have this consolation, that our cause is just, and that our country will be grateful and not condemn our conduct in case we fall through. If we fail, the Illinois as well as Kentucky, I believe, is lost.|$|E

During the winter of 1883, whilst her husband was in Ceylon, she worked on a series of memoirs of her childhood home, with a view to publishing them under the title An Emigrant's Notebook, but this plan was abandoned. She wrote a series of pamphlets in 1887 called Over the River, in which she appealed for funds for the parish of St. Stephens in Southwark, south London. She also wrote a number of short stories in the years 1890 and 1891, although these also never appeared in print. A number of unpublished poems from this period have also survived. When Sir William Gregory died in March 1892, Lady Gregory went into mourning and returned to Coole Park; there she edited her husband's autobiography, which she published in 1894. She was to write later, [...] "If I had not married <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> have learned the quick enrichment of sentences that one gets in conversation; had I not been widowed <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> have found the detachment of mind, the leisure for observation necessary to give insight into character, to express and interpret it. Loneliness made me rich—'full', as Bacon says." ...|$|E

Stats after the fight showed that McGee outstruck Ring 32-25 in the second round and 53-16 in the final round. After the fight, McGee said [...] "I felt like I had cage control, was more aggressive, out-struck him and attempted a submission in the third round. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> have left it {{in the hands of the}} judges and finished the fight." ...|$|E

When Sarah forwarded an unrelated letter from her husband to Anne, with a covering note continuing the argument, Anne wrote back pointedly, [...] "After the commands you gave me on the thanksgiving day of not answering you, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> have troubled you with these lines, but to return the Duke of Marlborough's letter safe into your hands, and {{for the same reason}} do not say anything to that, nor to yours which enclosed it." ...|$|E
500|$|In April 1890, {{during the}} run of The Gondoliers, however, Gilbert {{challenged}} Carte over the expenses of the production. Among other items to which Gilbert objected, Carte had charged {{the cost of a}} new carpet for the Savoy Theatre lobby to the partnership. Gilbert believed that this was a maintenance expense that should be charged to Carte alone. Gilbert confronted Carte, who refused to reconsider the accounts. Gilbert stormed out and wrote to Sullivan that [...] "I left him with the remark that {{it was a mistake to}} kick down the ladder by which he had risen".

500|$|Territorial {{representative}} David Levy {{proposed a}} resolution that was passed in Congress in 1842: [...] "that the Secretary of War be directed to place before this House such information as can be obtained {{in relation to the}} practicability and probable expense of draining the everglades of Florida." [...] From this directive Secretary of the Treasury Robert J. Walker requested Thomas Buckingham Smith from St. Augustine to consult those with experience in the Everglades on the feasibility of draining them, saying that he had been told two or three canals to the Gulf of Mexico would be sufficient. Smith asked officers who had served in the Seminole Wars to respond, and many favored the idea, promoting the land as a future agricultural asset to the South. A few disagreed, such as Captain John Sprague, who wrote he [...] "never supposed the country would excite an inquiry, other than as a hiding place for Indians, and had {{it occurred to me that}} so great an undertaking, one so utterly impracticable, as draining the Ever Glades was to be discussed, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> have destroyed the scratch of pen upon a subject so fruitful, and which cannot be understood but by those who have waded the water belly deep and examined carefully the western coast by land and by water." ...|$|E

500|$|Stanley Green, in his Encyclopedia of the Musical Theatre, {{viewed the}} central theme of The King and I as [...] "the {{importance}} of mutual understanding between people of differing ethnic and cultural backgrounds", but Renshaw felt that the musical suffered from 1950s attitudes when [...] "Orientalism {{was used as an}} exoticism rather than a real understanding of the particular culture." [...] He stated that his production was informed by authentic Thai cultural, aesthetic and religious ideas that he learned from visiting Thailand. A feature in Playbill commented that the production focused on the [...] "clash of ideologies and cultures, of East versus West". Theatre arts professor Eileen Blumenthal, however, called the production [...] "a King and I for the age of political correctness". While she acknowledged that the musical's treatment of Asian cultures had come to be understood as insensitive in the nearly half century since its premiere, she argued that Rodgers and Hammerstein's script was more sensitive than most orientalist literature of its day, in that [...] "West learns from East {{as well as the other}} way around", and that, moreover, the musical's treatment of its Asian subject is fantastical, not intended to be realistic. She concluded that the show is a documentary of [...] "who we've been" [...] in the West, and that a work like The King and <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> be suppressed, because it is [...] "too good".|$|E
500|$|In Haygarth's Cricket Scores and Biographies, Roe is {{described}} as a [...] "fine, free hitter with excellent defence", who could also [...] "bowl a very useful medium-paced ball". He got more of a go at Cambridge during his third year, playing five matches for the university side in 1882. Roe, who was known for his cricket tales, related a tale from one match that season in which the weather was so cold that catches were difficult to take. George Nash, the Lancashire professional, was missed off every ball of an over from Robert Ramsay. [...] "C. T. Studd bowled the next ball, and a catch came to me at mid-off, the crowd began to boo, and I felt certain <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> make the catch, but by great good fortune the ball stuck!" [...] Roe did not excel with bat or ball in any of his five university matches, and was not selected for the match against Oxford University {{at the end of the}} season. In his final year at Cambridge, Roe played seven times for the university, and achieved his Blue—the awarding of the Cambridge [...] "colours" [...] to sportsmen—by appearing in the University match against Oxford. He was out without scoring any runs in his only innings of the match, which Cambridge won by seven wickets. In all, during his time at Cambridge, Roe played 13 first-class matches for the university, scoring 246 runs at an average of 11.18, with just one score greater than 50. He also took ten wickets at 15.60.|$|E
500|$|On 15 March 1899 Bruce {{wrote to}} Sir Clements Markham at the RGS, {{offering}} {{himself for the}} scientific staff of the National Antarctic Expedition, then in its early planning stages. Markham's reply was a non-committal one-line acknowledgement, after which Bruce heard nothing for a year. He was then told, indirectly, {{to apply for a}} scientific assistant's post. On 21 March 1900 Bruce reminded Markham that he had applied a year earlier, and went on to reveal that he [...] "was not without hopes of being able to raise sufficient capital whereby I could take out a second British ship". He followed this up a few days later, and reported that the funding for a second ship was now assured, making his first explicit references to a [...] "Scottish Expedition". This alarmed Markham, who replied with some anger: [...] "Such a course will be most prejudicial to the Expedition A second ship is not in the least required I do not know why this mischievous rivalry should have been started". Bruce replied by return, denying rivalry, and asserting: [...] "If my friends are prepared to give me money to carry out my plans I do not see why <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> accept it [...] there are several who maintain that a second ship is highly desirable". Unappeased, Markham wrote back: [...] "As I was doing my best to get you appointed (to the National Antarctic Expedition) I had a right to think you would not take such a step without at least consulting me". He continued: [...] "You will cripple the National Expedition [...] in order to get up a scheme for yourself".|$|E
