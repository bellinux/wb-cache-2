The Vivitar 283 (guide number 120, ASA 100/feet; 37, DIN 21/meters), favoured by many photographers {{for the same}} reasons as the K1000, has an even longer life span of 1974-2004. The K1000 is also old enough to use flash bulbs, with a maximum synchronization speed of 1/30th second.|$|E
50|$|The Nikon SB-M {{dedicated}} flash {{is designed}} specifically for the FM10, {{but it will also}} accept any other nondedicated hot shoe mounted flash for guide number manual or <b>flash</b> <b>mounted</b> sensor automatic exposure control - the venerable Vivitar 283 (guide number 120, ASA 100/feet; 37, DIN 21/meters) was still available new a quarter century after its introduction in 1975. The FM10 does not accept a motor drive; film is only advanced manually via a thumb lever.|$|E

Note that the F2 {{did not use}} a standard ISO hot shoe to mount flash units. Instead, the SB-2, -6 and -7E mounted in a unique-to-Nikon-F-and-F2 hot shoe surrounding the film rewind crank. Manually rewinding film could not be done with a <b>flash</b> <b>mounted</b> in this shoe because the flash blocked the crank.

5000|$|Initially, the F3 {{model with}} the DE-2 {{eye-level}} finder was introduced, soon {{followed by the}} popular F3HP, or High Point camera, with the DE-3 High Eyepoint prism/finder. The major advantage of this finder was that the entire viewfinder image could be seen {{from a distance of}} 2.5 cm from the viewfinder. This made the F3 more usable by those who wear glasses when shooting, or were forced to shoot in high-glare situations while wearing sunglasses. The only down-side to this was a smaller image through the viewfinder compared to the standard prism. With the exception of the [...] "P" [...] spec camera, all viewfinders are completely interchangeable. The F3 and F3HP unfortunately retained the somewhat awkward flash mount on the rewind dial, which (with <b>flash</b> <b>mounted)</b> obstructed that area of the camera.|$|E

40|$|Despite of low {{circumferential}} Mach-numbers cen-trifugal fans {{may show}} distinctive tonal components in their sound spectra. Objective {{of the present}} investigation is the application of experimental methods which allow identifying possible flow disturbances seen by the rotating impeller as azimuthal modes rotating relative to the impel-ler. The forces due to the interaction of such modes with the blades may act as acoustic dipole sources. Two experimental techniques are employed: (i) According to Mongeau et al., Bent and Tetu (Pennsylvania State University, 1993) two stationary hot wire probes with a specified angular distance apart are placed either close to the intake or the discharge of the impeller. The local unsteady flow velocities from both sensors are measured synchronously. (ii) The rotor blades are instrumented with <b>flash</b> <b>mounted</b> miniature pressure sensors (microphones) distributed on the surfaces of all blades. Local unsteady pressure fluctuations from various sets of up to six pressure sensors are measured synchronously.

40|$|Thermal {{control of}} {{electronic}} components is a continuously emerging problem as power loads keep increasing.

Copper blocks represent heat dissipating electronic components. Inlet flow velocities to the channel were measured by using a Laser Doppler Anemometer (LDA) system. Flow field observations were performed using a Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and thermocouples were used for temperature measurements. Experiments and simulations were conducted for Re = 4000 – 8000 at fixed value of H = 10 × Dh. Flow field results were presented and heat transfer results were interpreted using the flow measurement observations. Numerical results were validated with experimental data and {{it was observed that}} the results are in agreement with the experiments...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Surface {{roughness}} at the centimetre and millimetre {{scale is}} an important factor governing radar backscatter, {{especially in the case of}} warm (>- 5 T) o r highly saline sea ice types. Quantitative measurements of surface roughness are required as input to backscatter models. Several field techniques have been used to quantitatively measure the surface roughness of sea ice. These techniques usually possess at least one of the following obstacles: difficult field operation, expense, poor accuracies or arduous data processing. A prototype portable field instrument called the Surface Roughness Meter has been designed to measure micro-scale surface roughness. The instrument provides measurements of two surface roughness parameters, root mean square height and correlation length. The instrument consists of a 35 mm camera and a <b>flash</b> <b>mounted</b> on a platform. The system illuminates and photographs a rectangle of known size on the surface from a fixed height. The negatives are digitized and the root mean square height and correlation length are calculated and recorded using a PC-based image analysis system in the laboratory. The first sea ice application for the instrument was the Labrador Ice Margin Experiment (LIMEX) 1989. The instrument was used to measure surface roughness of first-year deformed pack ice. The resulting data from LIMEX ’ 89 were digitized and surface roughness statistics were computed using a PC image analysis system. LIMEX ’ 89 Surface Roughness Meter data compared favourably to roughness statistics obtained from LIMEX ’ 87.

This was in the years around 1730. His teachers Verdrieß and Johann Jakob Scheuchzer had given him a hint, to make observations [...] "coelo tristi" [...] (in a sad sky).

5000|$|... 1964: Kodak Retina Reflex IV (USA/West Germany): first SLR with {{standard}} ISO hot shoe atop the pentaprism housing for direct <b>flash</b> <b>mounting</b> and synchronization. Was a 35 mm, leaf shutter design. A flash {{is a necessary}} accessory for auxiliary or fill light in dim or high contrast conditions. The first camera {{with any kind of}} hot shoe connector was the Univex Mercury (USA) non-SLR half frame 35 mm in 1938 and many post World War 2 non-SLRs (such as the Bell & Howell Foton USA 35 mm rangefinder) had a Leica-type accessory shoe with added electrical contact (the present day ISO hot shoe). Although the Nikon F (see above) had a non-ISO hot shoe surrounding the film rewind crank in 1959, most 1960s 35 mm SLRs used screw-on accessory shoes attached to the eyepiece to <b>mount</b> <b>flashes</b> but a PC cable socket to sync them. The ISO hot shoe became a standard SLR feature in the early 1970s. However, in 1971, SLRs using [...] "dedicated" [...] electronic flashes with automatic flash exposure control began appearing with the Canon FTb (Japan). They used ISO-style shoes with extra electrical contacts. Each SLR brand used incompatible contact configurations and the time of use-any-flash-with-any-SLR passed by the late 1970s. Note, although the hot shoe had been de facto standardized in the 1950s, the International Organization for Standardization did not promulgate its ISO 518 hot shoe specification until 1977.|$|R
40|$|Flash memory based {{embedded}} computing {{systems are}} becoming increasingly prevalent. These systems typically have to provide an instant start-up time. However, we observe that mounting a file system for flash memory takes 1 to 25 seconds mainly depending on the flash capacity. Since the flash chip capacity is doubled in every year, this mounting time will soon become the most dominant reason of the delay of system start-up time. Therefore, in this paper, we present instant <b>mounting</b> techniques for <b>flash</b> file systems by storing the in-memory file system metadata to flash memory when unmounting the file system and reloading the stored metadata quickly when mounting the file system. These metadata snapshot techniques are specifically developed for NOR- and NAND-type flash memories, {{while at the same}} time, overcoming their physical constraints. The proposed techniques check the validity of the stored snapshot and use the proposed fast crash recovery techniques when the snapshot is invalid. Based on the experimental results, the proposed techniques can reduce the <b>flash</b> <b>mounting</b> time by about two orders of magnitude over the existing de facto standard flash file system. ...|$|R
