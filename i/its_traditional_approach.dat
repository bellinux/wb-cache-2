25|$|The German fleet had {{expected}} that Britain would adopt <b>its</b> <b>traditional</b> <b>approach,</b> and had prepared {{by investing in}} submarines and coastal defences. The {{main body of the}} German navy—the High Seas Fleet—was smaller than the British Grand Fleet stationed around home waters and could not expect victory in a head to head fight. It therefore adopted a strategy of waiting in defended home ports for opportunities to attack the larger British force when the anticipated attack came. The British, appreciating this situation chose to adopt a strategy of patrolling the North Sea rather than waters close to Germany. Any German ships seeking to leave their home ports on the German coast must either pass the -wide Straits of Dover, defended by British submarines and mines, or the North Sea, where the British fleet was stationed around its main wartime base at Scapa Flow in Scotland, defending the -wide narrowest point between Britain and Norway. This led to a stand-off, neither fleet doing more than hold the other endlessly waiting. The German ships were contained in an area where they could not attack merchant shipping arriving on the west of Britain, which was vital for British survival. To encourage the German fleet to stay at home, the British would make occasional forays with the Grand Fleet and patrol with smaller cruiser and battlecruiser squadrons.|$|E

30|$|This {{raises the}} {{question}} of how a radiology department should audit <b>its</b> performance. A <b>traditional</b> <b>approach</b> to this has been through performance parameters—similar to those used in financial management [2 – 4]. Overall, when assessing the performance of a radiology department six indicators are most commonly used: productivity, reporting time, ease of access, finance and satisfaction (of both clinicians and patients) [5]. In this respect a department’s performance can be partly gauged by these ‘dashboard’ indicators [6]. ‘Dashboard indicators’ are intended to give a quick view of organisational performance. The name is derived from the example of the dashboard of a vehicle, which can at a glance provide an idea of overall function and act as a means of identifying areas for further assessment.|$|R
40|$|The wide {{adoption}} of Web Services {{has led to}} the development of languages to compose them, like the WS-BPEL standard. In order to check whether the composition works as expected, one common approach is to analyze it and infer functional properties describing <b>its</b> behavior. <b>Traditional</b> <b>approaches</b> for inferring properties in WS-BPEL have been static: compositions are transformed into specialized analysis models based on some formalization. However, this formalization could be inexact due to theoretical limitations or differing interpretations of the standard by implementers. Dynamic invariant generation solves these problems by extracting the properties from actual executions and has been successfully used in popular languages, but not to WS-BPEL yet. In this work, we apply dynamic invariant generation to WS-BPEL, providing innovative solutions for several features that require special consideration, like highly multidimensional values in variables, an advanced type system or unstructured code. We have implemented these solutions in Takuan and evaluated its performance with several compositions of varying complexity. We present the results obtained and a comparative analysis of the efficiency and effectiveness of our solutions. Results show that the solutions are successful in reducing the cost of applying dynamic invariant generation and the number of uninteresting invariants generated...|$|R

40|$|Elastic {{resource}} provisioning is a {{key feature}} of cloud computing, allowing users to scale up or down resource allocation for their applications at run-time. To date, most practical approaches to managing elasticity are based on allocation/de-allocation of the virtual machine (VM) instances to the application. This VM-level elasticity typically incurs both considerable overhead and extra costs, especially for applications with rapidly fluctuating demands. In this paper, we propose a lightweight approach to enable cost-effective elasticity for cloud applications. Our approach operates fine-grained scaling at the resource level itself (CPUs, memory, I/O, etc) in addition to VM-level scaling. We also present the design and implementation of an intelligent platform for light-weight resource management of cloud applications. We describe our algorithms for light-weight scaling and VM-level scaling and show their interaction.

In such a system, a new member should not be able to decrypt the multicast data sent before its joining and a former member should not be able to decrypt the mulitcast data sent after <b>its</b> leaving. <b>Traditional</b> <b>approaches</b> generally focus on reducing the re-key messages for a single server. However, these approaches still lead to large exchange overhead when the group is large. In this paper, we consider a distributed server network in which the user pool is split into multiple groups and served by multiple servers. Given the user traffic, there is a trade-off between the amount of re-key messaging and the total data bandwidth needed. We present a simple model for the system and study how the total bandwidth (including the re-key messaging and data traffic) can be minimized by optimizing the number of servers in the network. As the underlying user traffic is dynamic, a server should be able to split and merge user groups to minimize its total bandwidth. We propose a scheme for such a purpose.
