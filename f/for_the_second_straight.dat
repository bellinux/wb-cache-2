50|$|Over the Brave’s {{first three}} {{seasons in the}} AIHL the club has built a healthy rivalry with the Newcastle North Stars. This rivalry {{intensified}} {{at the end of}} the 2015 AIHL season when the North Stars came from behind to beat the CBR Brave in the Goodall Cup semi-finals. The Brave scored two shorthanded goals on the way to securing a 3-0 lead deep into <b>the</b> <b>second</b> period of <b>the</b> match before League MVP and AIHL record breaker, Geordie Wudrick, came to life and scored a third period hat trick that set up the North Stars comeback win as they scored a fourth and final goal to win the match 4-3. The Brave were devastated at missing out on the chance to contest the Goodall Cup final <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> year <b>straight</b> and just before the start of the 2016 AIHL season the club announced the signing of the very player that knocked them out the year before, naming Geordie Wudrick as one of the Brave’s six import signings for 2016. It is very rare in the AIHL to see players switch teams so the move of Wudrick from Newcastle to Canberra made headlines. Newcastle North Stars head coach, Andrew Petrie, slammed the move by the Brave board to ‘poach’ Wudrick weeks out from the new season, insisting the North Stars and Wudrick had a verbal agreement that he would return to the Hunter Valley. In the interview he labelled Canberra a city “in the middle of nowhere” and made reference to CBR standing for “Can Buy Resources but Can’t Buy Respect” which drew the ire of the CBR Brave fans and the club itself.|$|R
50|$|From 31 October 2016 to 2 November 2016, {{during the}} 21st Samsung Cup, Ke played against rival Lee Sedol once more during the semifinals. In {{the first game}} of the best of three series, Ke was {{reported}} to have won a very complete game in which Lee had very few chances due to the endgame being non-existing for him; however, with no breaks between games, Ke slipped up with his advantage with the white stones and Lee produced one of his many trademark comeback victories. The game began very evenly until Ke acquired a huge lead in territory and a positional advantage, but a few slip-ups when fighting Lee's dragon in the centre of the board caused Ke to lose his bearings in terms of maintaining his advantage. A few more accurate moves by Lee turned the tides, and with the safety of his dragon and gaining the territorial advantage, he closed out <b>the</b> <b>second</b> game to produce a stunning comeback win. With both games won by resignation with black, the third game had both players do coin-toss <b>for</b> <b>the</b> picking of the stones. Ke had the white stones in the deciding game and acquired all four corners and a marked territorial lead straight from the beginning. The remainder of the game displayed his ability to invade and scrape away Lee's territorial potential. As Lee began to find it difficult to gain any territory advantage, he pressed on the weaknesses of white's territory hoping to gain some advantage, but Ke made no mistakes and did not allow <b>for</b> <b>the</b> comeback to occur. With Lee's resignation in the deciding game, Ke reached the 21th Samsung Cup finals <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> year <b>straight.</b> From 6 December 2016 to 8 December 2016, Ke played the finals against compatriot Tuo Jiaxi. After losing the first game with black, Ke won <b>the</b> <b>second</b> game with white to even the series and then won the decider with black to successfully defend his Samsung Cup title.|$|R
