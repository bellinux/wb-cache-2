40|$|A unique textile-based device, the {{intelligent}} knee sleeve (IKS), uses conducting polymer technology to provide feedback on knee flexion angle for injury prevention programs. After identifying {{the most appropriate}} base fabric for the sensor, 12 athletes (age = 26. 1 ± 3. 2 years) performed four landing movements while wearing the sleeve, which was set to provide audible feedback at 25 ° and 45 ° knee <b>flexion.</b> <b>Sensor</b> and audible output (1000 Hz), knee kinematics (200 Hz) and ground reaction forces (1000 Hz) were recorded during the landing movements using an OPTOTRAK® motion analysis system. Paired t-tests and intraclass correlation coefficients {{were used to determine}} validity and reliability of the feedback. The results revealed that the audible feedback tone was able to significantly differentiate between different goniometer-programmed knee angles (25 ° and 45 °). Knee angles computed using the kinematic data from each trial for each movement were also highly reliable (intraclass correlation coefficients, R 1 = 0. 903 – 0. 988). It was concluded that although the IKS provides valid and reliable feedback on knee flexion angle, consistent feedback is dependent upon use of a sensor unaffected by environmental conditions. Such wearable biofeedback systems have application in a broad spectrum of activities, including performance enhancement, injury prevention and rehabilitation...|$|E
40|$|Pressure and {{position}} sensors are usual components of many electronic devices. They equip cars and planes for security and presence sensing, industrial automated systems {{and many other}} Human-Interface Devices for medicine and kinesiology robotics, video games, etc. We present alternative ways to develop our selves these sensors using a low cost material: conductive paper loaded with carbon black pigments. We show that such a paper can be easily used to develop position, pressure and <b>flexion</b> <b>sensors</b> {{and that it is}} a good basis to develop more refined sensors such as accelerometers or tilt sensors for shock sensing with smart packaging. We last compare a few trials to produce oneself this paper using conventional fibers such as TMP, chemical or recycled pulp using classic laboratory handsheet formers and mixing those with industrial carbon black loaded papers...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{a system to}} recognize the Arabic sign language using an instrumented glove and a machine learning method. Interfaces in sign language systems can be categorized as direct-device or vision-based. The direct-device approach uses measurement devices that are {{in direct contact with}} the hand such as instrumented gloves, <b>flexion</b> <b>sensors,</b> styli and position-tracking devices. On the other hand, the vision-based approach captures the movement of the singer's hand using a camera that is sometimes aided by making the signer wear a glove that has painted areas indicating the positions of the fingers or knuckles. The proposed system basically consists of a PowerGlove that is connected through the serial port to a workstation running the support vector machine algorithm. Obtained results are promising even though a simple and cheap glove with limited sensors was utilized...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of techniques for monitoring finger movement {{is becoming increasingly}} important in areas, such as robotics, virtual reality, and rehabilitation. To date, various techniques have been proposed for tracking hand movements, but the majority suffer from poor accuracy and repeatability. Inspired by the articulated structure of finger joints, we propose a novel 3 -D printed optical sensor with a compact hinged configuration for tracking finger <b>flexion.</b> This <b>sensor</b> exploits Malus' law using the attenuation of light transmitted through crossed polarizers. The sensor consists of a single LED, two pieces of linear polarizing film, and a photodetector that detects the changes in polarized light intensity proportional to the angle of finger flexion. This paper presents the characterization of the proposed optical sensor and compares it with a commonly used commercial bend sensor. Results show that the bend sensor exhibits hysteresis error, low sensitivity at small angles, and significant temporal drift. In contrast, the optical sensor is more accurate (± 0. 5 °) in the measuring range from 0 ° to 90 °, and exhibits high repeatability and stability, {{as well as a}} fast dynamic response. Overall, the optical sensor outperforms the commercial bend sensor, and shows excellent potential for monitoring hand movements in real time...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAnalysis {{of muscle}} {{exertion}} while exercising gives insight into an individual's balance, technique and activity performance. Smart Compression Garments (SCG) {{function as a}} low-cost material pressure mapping system integrated within consumer compression apparel capable of assessing both muscle use, and limb positioning. The SCG used for testing contained 5 sensors capable of measuring pressure between fabric and skin above key muscle groups of the lower limbs with marker-based video analysis to determine Knee Flexion Angle. The SCG was calibrated through voluntary contractions of target muscles, where surface pressure range and EMG data allowed for the quantification of exertion levels whilst the participant performed leg extension and <b>flexion</b> activities. Each <b>sensor</b> measured a viable range of pressure relative to the exertion level for each muscle group with a strong repeatable nature and correlation to muscle activation load. Additionally, analysis of the muscle loading variation of the quadriceps and hamstrings whilst walking on a treadmill at low speed was shown to match pre-established gait activation behaviour. Results support that a SCG with low-cost integration of piezoresistive materials has considerable promise in determination of muscle loads and potential injury conditions {{for the purpose of}} athlete training support...|$|R
