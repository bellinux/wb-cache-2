2500|$|I {{went there}} for the trial and I'd go into {{restaurants}} with Park and people would get up and leave. I called the defense lawyer, {{who happened to be}} a pretty good friend of mine, and said, [...] "What do you think a Monroe, Louisiana, jury is going to think of Tongsun Park?" [...] He said, I don't know. I was taken aback. What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> <b>you</b> don't know? You've tried a million cases here. [...] "I don't think they've ever seen a Korean before," [...] he said.|$|E
60|$|Mor. What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean?</b> <b>you</b> {{will not}} {{throttle}} him? consider he's my father.|$|E
6000|$|... "Your client? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> <b>you</b> {{have taken}} her case? You, the counsel for the Ditch Company?" [...] asked Mr. Hotchkiss, in {{trembling}} indignation.|$|E
6000|$|... "Your {{terms are}} rather vague," [...] Dr. Hammerfield interrupted. [...] "Just {{precisely}} what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> when <b>you</b> call us metaphysicians?" ...|$|R
60|$|What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean,</b> Arthur? <b>You</b> wouldn't {{prevent him}} from going when I've done {{everything}} in the world to get him away.|$|R
6000|$|... "SAPRISTI!" [...] screamed the infuriated Rokoff. [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean?</b> Are <b>you</b> a fool {{that you}} thus again insult Nikolas Rokoff?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Off!" [...] Charles exclaimed, turning pale. [...] "Off! What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean?</b> <b>You</b> don't surely {{mean to say}} you're {{going to}} leave us here?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How for me, dear Miss Tita? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> <b>you</b> {{would have}} given them to me if you had found them?" [...] I asked, almost trembling.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>you</b> cynical Scot!" [...] demanded John Skyd. [...] "Our {{shoulders}} are broad enough, are they not? nearly as broad as your own." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You might! <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> that <b>you</b> {{forget how}} fractious and nasty and abominable I was, {{and how many}} {{headaches}} I gave you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no, my darling, don't be startled. But <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> that <b>you</b> {{really thought}} Jock's {{disregard}} of your entreaties came from indifference?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Colville turned very red. [...] "What in {{the world}} <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean?</b> <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> imagine that I have been {{offering}} myself to Mrs. Bowen?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he answered, [...] "that {{depends upon}} the girl. What sort of a living <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean?</b> <b>You</b> are earning a living now, of a kind." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Truth? My dear child, what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean?</b> <b>You</b> don't suppose I'm {{the man to}} rob {{the widow}} and the orphan? Of course, there's no truth in it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>you</b> can't?" [...] I exclaimed, whilst {{a horrible}} fear like an icy claw {{suddenly}} gripped at my heart. [...] "You haven't lost it, have you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Miss Townshead did {{not appear}} contented, but she changed the topic. [...] "Then what <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> when <b>you</b> spoke about the dress packet?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> when <b>you</b> said I {{could have}} given you no worse news than that of his coming alone?" [...] she {{questioned}} suddenly.|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear Miss Gregory," [...] said Syme gently, [...] "there {{are many}} kinds of sincerity and insincerity. When you say 'thank you' for the salt, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> what <b>you</b> say? No. When you say 'the world is round,' <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> what <b>you</b> say? No. It is true, but <b>you</b> don't <b>mean</b> it. Now, {{sometimes}} a man like your brother really finds a thing he does mean. It may be only a half-truth, quarter-truth, tenth-truth; but then he says more than he means--from sheer force of meaning it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear young lady," [...] he said, [...] "my dear Lois, what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean?</b> <b>You</b> don't suppose--you can't--that it {{was through}} me in any way that--that thing happened?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Mervyn, what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean?</b> <b>You</b> {{have all}} the power and {{consequence}} here, and are fully master of all; but why should not poor mamma live in her own house?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>you</b> villain!" [...] roared Deleglise's {{caretaker}} at me {{one evening}} on entering the kitchen. [...] "How dare you {{waste your time}} writing this sort of stuff?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{never quite}} {{know when you}} are in earnest, Cuthbert; but if it is true it is very good news. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> that <b>you</b> are really studying?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Syme," [...] she said, [...] "do {{the people}} who talk like you and my brother often <b>mean</b> what they say? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> what <b>you</b> say now?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean?</b> Jim, <b>you</b> don't {{intend to}} come back!" [...] She took his arm. [...] "What's the matter? Now tell me! What {{are you going}} away for?" ...|$|R
6000|$|THE SHERIFF. Well, fetch her in. [Strapper goes out. The Sheriff continues, to Feemy] And what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>you</b> lying jade, {{by putting}} up this story on us about Blanco? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, don't you know? It is a--Look here, you fellows! Didn't I {{tell you}} that breakfast was to be all ready when I came down? What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>you</b> lazy rascals? Skip, now, and have {{everything}} ready this minute." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{were always}} a buffoon," [...] he cried. [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>you</b> numskull, by {{saying that they are}} Prussians? How could Prussians be coming from the {{direction}} of France? You have lost any wits that you ever possessed." ...|$|E
6000|$|RAINA (coming {{a little}} towards him, {{as if she}} could not believe her senses). <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> what <b>you</b> said just now? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> know what you said just now? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good heavens, sir! and <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> that <b>you,</b> a {{clerk in}} the West Diddlesex Insurance Office, applied to by a respectable lady as to {{the manner in which}} she should invest property, never spoke to her about the Company which you have the honour to serve? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean,</b> sir, that <b>you,</b> knowing there was a bonus of five per cent. for {{yourself}} upon shares taken, did not press Mrs. Hoggarty to join us?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{is to be}} my husband," [...] said Lucy, {{springing}} up. [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean?</b> <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> anything?" [...] Lady Fawn, who {{was not at all}} wise, {{protested that}} she meant nothing.|$|R
6000|$|... "Damn you, what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>you</b> little minx?" [...] he asked. [...] "Why {{do you say}} I killed her, because I {{did what}} I thought the best for all of us? No woman had a better husband, as I am sure she {{acknowledges}} in heaven to-day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>you</b> incorrigible rogue," [...] her Grace {{was saying}} with playful {{severity}} to her cavalier, [...] "by coming so {{late to the}} ball? Another two minutes {{and you would have}} arrived after His Royal Highness himself: and how would you have justified such solecism, I would like to know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And {{you shall}} have it, right or wrong, my {{handsome}} fellow. By Heaven, you are much too good-looking {{to be made}} a monk of! What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>you</b> villains, by attempting to kidnap free men? Is it not {{enough for you to}} lock up every mad girl whom you can dupe, but you must--' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good heavens! what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean!</b> would <b>you</b> {{tell the}} girl what you're going to do? Why she'll tell your father, and Thady, {{and raise the}} whole country on me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, Anne, what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean?</b> Were <b>you</b> never {{taught to}} say your prayers? God always wants little girls to say their prayers. Don't {{you know who}} God is, Anne?" ...|$|R
60|$|GILBEY. Radical! What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean?</b> Dont <b>you</b> {{begin to}} take liberties, Juggins, {{now that you know}} we're loth to part with you. Your brother isnt a duke, you know.|$|R
