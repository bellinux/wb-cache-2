5|$|The South Wales Coalfield {{produced}} the sought-after anthracite, bituminous and steam coals—the latter a grade {{between the two}} comprising a hard coal without the coking elements. Some of the region's coal seams contained high quantities of <b>firedamp,</b> a highly explosive gas consisting of methane and hydrogen, and were therefore prone to explosions; <b>firedamp</b> rises into the higher points of workings, including cavities or, as at Senghenydd, when the seams were being mined in an upward gradient. An additional danger of <b>firedamp</b> is afterdamp, a poisonous mixture of gases left after an explosion, primarily constituted of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and nitrogen. They combine with haemoglobin in the bloodstream to stop cells carrying oxygen, which can result in suffocation by lack of oxygen or anoxia. If survivors from an explosion are not rescued quickly, they face {{the possibility of being}} killed by the gas. The presence of <b>firedamp</b> contributed to a higher-than-average proportion of accidents: between 1880 and 1900 South Wales accounted for 18% of Britain's miners, but 48 per cent of all UK mining deaths occurred in the region. As coal output from British collieries reached its peak in 1913 there was a correspondingly large number of accidents around this time.|$|E
5|$|Before 1840, {{women and}} {{children}} were employed in coal mines and there were frequent accidents. The worst disaster occurred in 1825 at the Gosforth Pit, named after the Brandling's Durham estate, where an explosion of <b>firedamp</b> caused 24 deaths; the oldest a collier aged 48 and the youngest a child of seven.|$|E
5|$|The worst mining {{disaster}} in the town occurred at Yew Tree Colliery on 11 December 1858 when an explosion of <b>firedamp</b> caused by a safety lamp cost 25 lives, the youngest victim was 11, and the oldest, 35 years of age. Some of the victims are buried in the churchyard at St George's Church. Another explosion on 6 March 1877 at Great Boys Colliery cost eight lives and on 2 October 1883, six men died when the cage rope broke at Nelson Colliery in Shakerley. On 1 October 1895 five men including the colliery manager and undermanager died at Shakerley Colliery after an explosion of <b>firedamp.</b>|$|E

5000|$|In the {{preamble}} of the constitution, Daniel Weaver aggressively {{lays out the}} problems that miners faced on a daily basis. These included dangers from explosions and insecure roofs, <b>firedamp’s</b> and noxious gases, poor ventilation, and other accidents that were caused by the poor management of their employers, whose only object was to increase their capital with no remorse {{to the loss of}} life, limbs, or health of their employees. The constitution also laid out the formation of the union, in which practicing miners were formed into Lodges, who were formed into Districts, and supervised by the General Board who also represented the association in the corporate capacity. [...] The General Board consisted of one President, one Vice-President, one Treasurer, and one Delegate who were elected from each Lodge in the Association. The officers of the General Board were elected by delegates and held their positions for two years. They were required to meet once a year, unless a special meeting was called. Information from the meetings were reported and printed through the Weekly Miner, a publication that was directed and edited by John Hinchcliffe, the second president of the American Miners’ Association. The Weekly Miner was essential in keeping the union up to date in current events. [...] The constitution also provided the duties of each Executive Officer. The President was responsible for presiding over all the meetings in the Board and appointed all necessary committees. He was subjected to the approval of the delegates in session and received applications for admission of new Lodges into the association. [...] The Vice-President was responsible in performing the duties of the President if absent. The Financial Secretary was responsible for receiving the money and drafts that were paid to the General Board and record all financial affairs. He is then responsible to turn in all the money to the Treasurer {{at the end of each}} General Board meeting or before the expiration of every three months. The Corresponding Secretary was responsible for recording everything in meetings, communicating with the press and distant members of officers in the association, and received post office orders, communications, parcels, papers or periodicals. [...] Finally, the Treasurer was responsible for receiving all money and credit that belong or pertained to the General Board.|$|R
5|$|Mining {{disasters}} in Leigh included {{the explosion of}} <b>firedamp</b> which caused the deaths of 38miners at Bedford Colliery on 13 August 1886. There were several accidents at Bickershaw Colliery, but the most serious was in 1932, when 19men were drowned in the sump {{at the bottom of}} the shaft after an overwind of the cage.|$|E
5|$|The {{inquiry report}} failed to {{identify}} a definite cause, although it was considered that the most likely cause was a spark from the signalling gear. It would have ignited the <b>firedamp,</b> exacerbated and fuelled by coal dust in the air. The report was critical of {{many aspects of the}} management's practices, and considered it had breached the mining regulations in respect of measuring and maintaining the air quality in the workings, and in the removal of coal dust from the tracks and walkways. The report pointed out that because the management had not implemented the changes needed to the ventilation fans as demanded by the Coal Mines Act 1911, the fans were unable to reverse the direction of the airflow, which would have blown the smoke out through the Lancaster shaft, although Redmayne and his colleagues held differing opinions on the advisability of reversing or stopping the airflow. The historian John H Brown, in his examination of the disaster, states that had the airflow been reversed, <b>firedamp</b> or afterdamp could have been extracted from some sectors into the blaze, causing another explosion.|$|E
5|$|In 1906 a major {{explosion}} at a colliery in Courrières, northern France, caused {{the deaths of}} more than 1,000 miners. The subsequent report blamed the accidental ignition of <b>firedamp,</b> exacerbated by coal dust in the air. Concerned that a similar disaster might happen in British collieries, the Royal Commission was formed, reporting back in 1907, 1909 and 1911. The reports led to the Coal Mines Act 1911, which came into force December that year. Among other changes {{to the health and}} safety culture, the act required that ventilation fans in all collieries be capable of reversing the air current underground; this measure was to be implemented by 1 January 1913.|$|E
5|$|In {{an earlier}} {{disaster}} in May 1901, three underground explosions at the colliery killed 81 miners. The inquest {{established that the}} colliery had high levels of airborne coal dust, which would have exacerbated the explosion and carried it further into the mine workings. The cause of the 1913 explosion is unknown, but the subsequent inquiry thought the most likely cause was a spark from underground signalling equipment that could have ignited any <b>firedamp</b> present. The miners in {{the east side of}} the workings were evacuated, but the men in the western section bore the brunt of the explosion, fire and afterdamp—a poisonous mixture of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and nitrogen left after an explosion.|$|E
5|$|The Mines Inspectorate {{began an}} enquiry, chaired by the mining {{engineer}} William Galloway. The report was published on 15 July. It {{stated that the}} mine was hot {{with high levels of}} coal dust present. The method used to load coal onto underground trucks created quantities of dust, which had aggravated a small explosion and created a chain reaction of related explosions throughout the workings. An inquest held in October concluded that various safety precautions had not been followed, and had the mine been sufficiently watered it would have reduced the coal dust held in the air. The colliery had further problems in October 1910 when a heavy roof fall in the Mafeking return released trapped <b>firedamp,</b> which caused the mine to be temporarily evacuated.|$|E
5|$|The firefighters built bashings, {{walls of}} sandbags, turf and sand, {{approximately}} 18feet (5.5metres) deep and 17feet (5.2metres) {{up to the}} tunnel's roof to prevent smoke filling {{the rest of the}} workings and allow men to explore areas previously cut off. Within two days the temperatures dropped and the volume of smoke was reduced. Although the fire was contained, miners still faced several obstacles, including roof collapses and large pockets of trapped <b>firedamp.</b> The first collapse consisted of more than 100 tons of debris, while another fall was more than 300feet (91.5metres) long and 30 to 40feet (10–12metres) high. Clearing the falls and finding bodies was slow, and it took until 8 November for the first of the 4 working districts to be explored and cleared of bodies. Many victims were unidentifiable—either the explosion, fire or subsequent decomposition had taken its toll—and many had to be identified by their personal effects, although some bodies remained unidentified.|$|E
5|$|Work {{continued}} {{throughout the}} night of 15 October and into the following day. It focused on finding survivors and fighting the fire that blocked the entry into some workings of the western returns. The fire caused the roof supports to become unstable, and falls triggered outbursts of methane. Several rescuers were injured by the falls, one fatally. Before descending the mine many of the firefighters wrote what they thought might be their last letters home, and some made their wills. As the water pipe in the shaft was out of operation, fire-fighting continued with hand extinguishers and work was only possible in 20-minute shifts. Despite wearing respirators, several rescuers were overcome by the effects of <b>firedamp.</b> During {{the course of the}} day, 56 bodies were raised to the surface and, that evening, a new water supply, connected by three-quarters of a mile (1.2km) of pipes to a nearby reservoir, was installed in the Lancaster shaft.|$|E
25|$|Coal mining {{was very}} {{dangerous}} {{owing to the}} presence of <b>firedamp</b> in many coal seams. Some degree of safety was provided by the safety lamp which was invented in 1816 by Sir Humphry Davy and independently by George Stephenson. However, the lamps proved a false dawn because they became unsafe very quickly and provided a weak light. <b>Firedamp</b> explosions continued, often setting off coal dust explosions, so casualties grew during the entire 19th century. Conditions of work were very poor, with a high casualty rate from rock falls.|$|E
25|$|Warren Vale Colliery: A <b>firedamp</b> {{explosion}} {{caused by}} naked flame in 1851 {{resulted in the}} death of 52 miners. At the inquest the coroner insisted on there being {{an increase in the number}} of mines inspectors in the district.|$|E
25|$|<b>Firedamp</b> explosions {{can trigger}} the much-more-dangerous coal dust explosions, which can engulf an entire pit. Most of these risks can be greatly reduced in modern mines, and {{multiple}} fatality incidents are now rare {{in some parts}} of the developed world. Modern mining in the US results in approximately 30 deaths per year due to mine accidents.|$|E
25|$|Lowther also {{supported}} experimental work on <b>firedamp</b> by William Brownrigg, a local doctor (and {{a son of}} the local gentry; in due course he married a Spedding daughter) and presented papers by Brownrigg at the Royal Society. Brownrigg was elected an FRS, but his papers on the subject were held back by him from publication (he {{is said to have}} intended a 'History of Coal Mining'), and have now been lost.|$|E
25|$|Fletcher hired C. A. Russell, Solicitor and Henn Collins QC (later Baron Collins) {{to appeal}} this {{decision}} to the Divisional Court at Wigan. The reasoning behind the appeal was twofold, first; that the umpire {{was limited to}} deeming whether an open light was dangerous and not determining that mines need to be worked with a particular remedy as this went beyond his powers and second; that instead of using safety lamps, the owners could {{get rid of the}} <b>firedamp,</b> thus not requiring safety lamps as laid down in the notice.|$|E
25|$|The {{family of}} William Hulton of Hulton Park owned many small collieries from the 16th century. After 1828 the pits at Chequerbent were {{served by the}} Bolton and Leigh Railway. The Hulton Colliery Company sank Chequerbent Colliery in 1892 and Bank Pit Nos 1–4 between 1897 and 1901. The company mined the Trencherbone, Plodder and Arley seams. Bank Pit No 3, known as the Pretoria Pit, {{was the site of}} one Britain's worst coal-mining {{disasters}} when on 21 December 1910, 344 men and boys died in an explosion of <b>firedamp.</b> The Pretoria Pit Disaster was the third worst in British mining history, after the 1866 Barnsley Oaks Disaster in Yorkshire, and the 1913 Senghenydd Colliery Disaster in Glamorgan. A memorial erected in 1910 is grade II listed.|$|E
25|$|Wegner {{suggests}} {{that a combination of}} naval ship design, and a change in the type of coal used to fuel naval ships, might have facilitated the explosion postulated by the Rickover study. Up to the time of Maines building, he explains, common bulkheads separated coal bunkers from ammunition lockers and American naval ships burned primarily smokeless anthracite coal. With {{an increase in the number}} of steel ships, the U.S. Navy switched to bituminous coal, which burned at a hotter temperature than anthracite coal, and allowed ships to steam faster. However, Wegner explains, while anthracite coal is not subject to spontaneous combustion, bituminous coal is considerably more volatile. In fact, bituminous coal is known for releasing the largest amounts of <b>firedamp,</b> a dangerous and explosive mixture of gases (chiefly methane). <b>Firedamp</b> is explosive at concentrations between 4% and 16%, with most violence at around 10%. In addition, there was another potential contributing factor in the bituminous coal – this was iron sulfide, also known as pyrite, that was likely present. The presence of pyrites presents two additional risk factors. The first involves oxidation. Pyrite oxidation is sufficiently exothermic that underground coal mines in high-sulfur coal seams have occasionally had serious problems with spontaneous combustion in the mined-out areas of the mine. This process can result from the disruption caused by mining from the seams, or other processing, which then exposes the sulfides in the ore to air and water. The presence of pyrites in coal has been recognized to be self-heating. The second risk factor involves an additional capability of pyrites to provide fire ignition under certain conditions. Pyrites, which derive their name from the Greek root word pyr, which means fire, can cause sparks when struck by steel or other sufficiently hard surfaces. Before the use of flintlock guns, for example, pyrites were used to strike sparks to ignite gunpowder in an earlier model type gun, known as a wheellock. In the presence of combustible gasses issuing from the bituminous coal, the pyrites could therefore have provided the ignition capability needed to create an explosion. A number of bunker fires of this type had, in fact, been reported aboard U.S. warships before Maines explosion, in several cases nearly sinking the ships. Wegner also cites a 1997 heat transfer study which concluded that a coal bunker fire, of the type suggested by Rickover, could have taken place and ignited the ship's ammunition.|$|E
500|$|The Senghenydd {{colliery}} disaster, {{also known}} as the Senghenydd explosion (...) , occurred at the Universal Colliery in Senghenydd, near Caerphilly, Glamorgan, Wales, on 14 October 1913. The explosion, which killed 439 miners and a rescuer, is still the worst mining accident in the United Kingdom. Universal Colliery, located on the South Wales Coalfield, produced steam coal which was much in demand. Some of the region's coal seams contained high quantities of <b>firedamp,</b> a highly explosive gas consisting of methane and hydrogen, and were prone to explosions.|$|E
500|$|Just after 8:00am an {{explosion}} {{occurred in the}} west side of the underground workings. It is possible there were two explosions as survivors stated a smaller explosion preceded the main one, although the official report referred only to one. [...] The cause was probably a build-up of <b>firedamp</b> that was ignited by an electric spark from equipment such as electric bell signalling gear. The initial explosion ignited airborne coal dust, and a shock wave ahead of the explosion raised yet more coal dust, which also combusted. Many victims who were not killed immediately by the explosion and fire died from the effects of afterdamp. The explosive wave travelled up the Lancaster shaft to the surface, destroying the headframe; it killed the winder—the man in charge—and badly wounded his deputy.|$|E
500|$|On 19 January 1811, the {{original}} High Main seam at Felling Colliery was closed, {{but by that}} time the colliery had grown enormously. [...] The colliery was deepened to reach the Low Main seam. [...] Two shafts were provided: John Pit and William Pit. [...] The Low Main and began operation in October 1810. Disaster struck Felling Colliery on 25 May 1812 when, despite the colliery containing the most up-to-date safety measures, <b>firedamp</b> ignited and at around 11.30am, [...] "one of the most tremendous explosions in the history of coal mining took place". Two explosions rocked the colliery, the blast appearing in both pits. [...] A cloud of coal dust and debris over a radius of {{a mile and a half}} was ejected from the colliery. One account recalled: ...|$|E
500|$|On 7 May 1908 the Pilkington Colliery Company started sinking No 1 Shaft of Astley Green Colliery {{near the}} Bridgewater Canal. A {{colliery}} railway moved coal from the screens to the Liverpool and Manchester Railway but some coal was transported to power stations at Trafford Park and Stretford using the Bridgewater Canal. Pit head baths, a canteen and medical centre {{designed for the}} Miners' Welfare Committee by architect C. Kemp, were built in 1935–36 {{at a cost of}} over £24,000 (£ as of [...] ). There was a mining accident at Astley Green on 7 June 1939 when five men including the manager died in an explosion of <b>firedamp.</b> Women, [...] "pit brow lasses", worked on the screens sorting coal from rock until 1955. The last coal was wound on 3 April 1970.|$|E
500|$|Francis Taylor is {{the first}} {{recorded}} fatality at the colliery, killed by a roof fall at [...] "Bradford coal pitt" [...] in 1622. Although the mines were relatively gas-free, there were nevertheless some gas-related incidents. One collier, working {{by the light of}} a candle in 1874, died from burns received in an explosion of <b>firedamp.</b> In 1907 a miner died in a shotfiring incident, when gas exploded as a fuse was lit. In 1924 a number of tubs transporting miners being hauled to the surface derailed and dislodged a pit prop, causing a roof collapse, known locally as a crump; three men were killed and nine injured. The heat from a fire in the main winding engine house in 1953 caused the winding cables to snap, sending two coal-carrying cages crashing {{to the bottom of the}} main shaft and trapping 350men underground. All managed to reach a smaller shaft [...] away and were subsequently brought safely to the surface.|$|E
500|$|Before the {{development}} of the safety lamp for use in coal mines, dried fish skins were used in Britain and Europe as a weak source of light. This experimental form of illumination avoided the necessity of using candles which risked sparking explosions of <b>firedamp.</b> Another safe source of illumination in mines was bottles containing fireflies. In 1920, the American zoologist E. Newton Harvey published a monograph, The Nature of Animal Light, summarizing early work on bioluminescence. Harvey notes that Aristotle mentions light produced by dead fish and flesh, and that both Aristotle and Pliny the Elder (in his Natural History) mention light from damp wood. He also records that Robert Boyle experimented on these light sources, and showed that both they and the glow-worm require air for light to be produced. Harvey notes that in 1753, J. Baker identified the flagellate Noctiluca [...] "as a luminous animal" [...] "just visible to the naked eye", and in 1854 Johann Florian Heller (1813–1871) identified strands (hyphae) of fungi as the source of light in dead wood.|$|E
500|$|Coal {{had been}} mined {{for several hundred}} years in {{numerous}} shallow shafts and adits, but took on greater importance when in 1776 Robert Vernon Atherton leased the coal rights to Thomas Guest from Leigh and John Fletcher from Bolton. In 1845 the era of deep mining arrived with the sinking of Fletcher's Lover's Lane pit at Howe Bridge. The Crombouke Day-Eye, a drift mine accessing the shallow Brassy and Crombouke mines, opened in 1870 and closed in 1907. (A coal seam {{was referred to as}} a [...] "mine" [...] in this part of Lancashire.) By the early 1870s Fletcher, Burrows and Company's Howe Bridge Colliery, the biggest of the three Howe Bridge pits, was sunk to the Black & White, or Seven Foot mine. It pit closed in 1959. Gibfield Colliery, situated alongside the Bolton and Leigh Railway, was working in 1829, coal was mined from the Trencherbone mine. Forty years later a [...] shaft was sunk to Arley Mine. The pit closed in 1963. In September 1913 the first pit head baths in the country were opened at Gibfield. Chanters Colliery was in Hindsford, where [...] shafts were sunk to the Trencherbone mine in 1854. In the late 1890s shafts were deepened to [...] to reach the Arley mine. Atherton had its share of mining disasters, on 11 February 1850 five men died in a gas explosion caused by a lighted candle at Gibfield and 27 men died at Lovers Lane Colliery after a <b>firedamp</b> explosion caused by blown-out shot on 28 March 1872. On 6 March 1957 eight men died at Chanters Colliery after an explosion of gas.|$|E
2500|$|The {{subsequent}} report {{blamed the}} accidental ignition of <b>firedamp,</b> exacerbated by coal {{dust in the}} air.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{most likely}} that the {{explosion}} was caused by <b>firedamp,</b> a common hazard in coal mines when a pocket of methane gas is accidentally ignited and explodes. <b>Firedamp</b> {{is all the more}} hazardous because of the after effects of the explosion. Gases known as [...] "afterdamp" [...] – carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide produced by the explosion – often prove to be just as deadly and can kill miners unhurt by the explosion itself.|$|E
2500|$|Lower Elsecar Colliery: [...] A <b>firedamp</b> {{explosion}} in 1852 {{resulted in the}} death of 12 miners. [...] In response to this explosion, Benjamin Biram the collieries mining engineer fitted the first underground fan to improve ventilation.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] Udston mining {{disaster}} {{occurred in}} Hamilton, Scotland on Saturday, 28 May 1887 when 73 miners {{died in a}} <b>firedamp</b> explosion at Udston Colliery.

2500|$|The Oaks explosion: A {{series of}} <b>firedamp</b> and coal dust explosions that {{resulted}} in the death of 361 men and boys. [...] This was the worst colliery disaster in the United Kingdom until the Senghenydd Colliery Disaster in 1913 and is to date the worst in England.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Firedamp</b> explosions {{can trigger}} {{the much more}} {{dangerous}} coal dust explosions, which can engulf an entire pit. Most of these risks can be greatly reduced in modern mines, and multiple fatality incidents are now rare {{in some parts of}} the developed world. [...] Modern mining in the US results in approximately 30 deaths per year due to mine accidents.|$|E
2500|$|With falling air {{pressure}}, gases trapped {{within the}} coal in deep mines can escape more freely. Thus low pressure {{increases the risk}} of <b>firedamp</b> accumulating. Collieries therefore keep track of the pressure. In the case of the Trimdon Grange colliery disaster of 1882 the mines inspector drew attention to the records and in the report stated [...] "the conditions of atmosphere and temperature may be taken to have reached a dangerous point".|$|E
2500|$|Spedding {{invented a}} [...] "steel mill", {{in which a}} flint was held against a rapidly rotated steel disc, {{producing}} a stream of sparks giving some illumination. A second worker was needed to operate the mill, since the disc was rotated by a hand crank, and its operation was tiring. The use of the mill as a safer alternative to naked flame spread to other coalfields; prior {{to the introduction of}} the Davy lamp, up to a hundred steel mills were in daily use at one Tyneside colliery despite a fatal <b>firedamp</b> explosion at Wallsend colliery in 1785 ignited by a steel mill[...]|$|E
2500|$|The {{people of}} the Tyneside area, called [...] "Geordies", have a {{reputation}} for their distinctive dialect and accent.

An alternative explanation relates that during the Jacobite risings of 1715 and 1745 the Tynesiders declared their allegiance to the Hanoverian kings of Great Britain George I and George II; whereas the rest of the county of Northumberland, to the north, stood loyal to James Francis Edward Stuart.|$|E
