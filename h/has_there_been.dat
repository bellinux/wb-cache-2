5|$|In tennis, {{the term}} Big Four {{refers to the}} quartet of men's singles players {{comprising}} Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic, and Andy Murray. These players are considered dominant in terms of ranking and tournament victories, including Grand Slam tournaments and ATP Masters 1000 events, {{as well as the}} ATP World Tour Finals and Olympic Games, having dominated the sport amongst them from 2004 onwards. Never before in the history of tennis <b>has</b> <b>there</b> <b>been</b> a group of players as dominant as these four.|$|E

Shipp was succeeded by Lou Holtz for the 1976 season. Holtz resigned as Jets head coach with one game left in the 1976 season; Mike Holovak was named interim coach for the season finale against the Cincinnati Bengals.|$|E

[...] He described the Oxford crew as [...] "exceptionally strong and mechanically quite efficient" [...] yet [...] "lacks polish and uniformity" [...] and while Cambridge were demonstrated uniformity, they rowed {{in a way which}} [...] "does look like hard work". [...] In the build-up to the race, Oxford's time in their second full course row was 45 seconds quicker than that rowed by Cambridge the previous day.|$|E
500|$|Although anti-Catholicism {{had been}} a {{consistent}} platform of the Klan, before leaving the organization, Evans renounced his anti-Catholicism and pronounced a [...] "new era of religious tolerance". In 1939, he said that [...] "in no other time in history <b>has</b> <b>there</b> <b>been</b> more need for all {{people who believe in}} the same Father and same Son to stand together." [...] That year, Evans also publicly expressed an interest in learning aspects of Judaism to better understand the Old Testament. Chester L. Quarles, a professor of criminal justice at the University of Mississippi, argues that Evans repudiated anti-Catholicism owing to his desire to fight unions and communism and his fear of having too many enemies at one time.|$|E
500|$|These {{considerations}} {{should lead}} us to look upon all the works of nature, animate or inanimate, as invested with a certain sanctity, {{to be used by}} us but not abused, and never to be recklessly destroyed or defaced. To pollute a spring or a river, to exterminate a bird or beast, should be treated as moral offences and as social crimes;... Yet during the past century, which has seen those great advances in the knowledge of Nature of which we are so proud, there has been no corresponding development of a love or reverence for her works; so that never before <b>has</b> <b>there</b> <b>been</b> such widespread ravage of the earth's surface by destruction of native vegetation and with it of much animal life, and such wholesale defacement of the earth by mineral workings and by pouring into our streams and rivers the refuse of manufactories and of cities; and this has been done by all the greatest nations claiming the first place for civilisation and religion! ...|$|E
30|$|The GBI is {{a measure}} of chronic-intermittent forms of affective {{disorders}} and identifies the full range of severity of unipolar and BD—from sub-syndromal to syndromal (Depue et al. 1981, 1989). It consists of three clusters of items: depressive, hypomanic and biphasic (defined as the tendency to vacillate between depression and hypomania in the same item). The GBI has 73 items that are scored on a 0 – 4 Likert scale related to the chronicity of the symptom described. It is possible to use the scoring system of the GBI as a Likert scale yielding continuous scores of affective disturbance or dysregulation in the domains of depressive, hypomanic and biphasic symptoms. We used a selection of ten items from the depression domain of which the majority selected being consistent with a recent factor analysis informing the development of a shorter version of the GBI (Youngstrom et al. 2013). The items were: (1) Have you had periods of sadness and depression when almost everything gets on your nerves and makes you irritable or angry (other than related to the menstrual cycle)?; (2) <b>Have</b> <b>there</b> <b>been</b> times of several days or more when you were so sad that it was quite painful or you felt that you couldn’t stand it?; (3) <b>Have</b> <b>there</b> <b>been</b> times when you looked back over your life and could see only failures or hardships?; (4) <b>Have</b> <b>there</b> <b>been</b> times when you were feeling low and depressed, and you also had to struggle very hard to control inner feelings of rage or an urge to smash or destroy things?; (5) <b>Have</b> <b>there</b> <b>been</b> times when you exploded at others and afterwards felt bad about yourself?; (6) <b>Have</b> <b>there</b> <b>been</b> times when you hated yourself or felt that you were stupid, ugly, unlovable, or useless? (7) <b>Have</b> <b>there</b> <b>been</b> times of several days or more when you really got down on yourself and felt worthless?; (8) Have you had periods when it seemed that the future was hopeless and things could not improve?; (9) <b>Have</b> <b>there</b> <b>been</b> periods lasting several days or more when you were so down in the dumps that you thought you might never snap out of it?; and (10) <b>Have</b> <b>there</b> <b>been</b> times when you have felt that you would be better off dead? All 27 items for the hypomanic and biphasic domains were administered. The GBI has been extensively validated and possesses good psychometric properties (Depue et al. 1981, 1989).|$|R
