40|$|Introduction. We {{searched for}} a pathophysiologically based feature of major water electrolytes, which may define water quality better than the water hardness, {{respecting}} urinary calculus formation. Materials and Methods. Utilizing a multistage stratified sampling, 2310 patients were diagnosed in the imaging centers of the provincial capitals in Iran between 2007 and 2008. These were composed of 1755 patients who were settled residents of 24 provincial capitals. Data on the regional drinking water composition, obtained from an accredited registry, and their relationships with the region’s incidence of urinary calculi were evaluated by metaregression models. The stone risk index (defined as the ratio of calcium to magnesium-bicarbonate product in drinking water) {{was used to assess}} the risk of calculus formation. Results. No correlation was found between the urinary <b>calculus</b> <b>incidence</b> and the amount of calcium, bicarbonate, or the total hardness of the drinking water. In contrast, water magnesium had a marginally significant nonlinear inverse relationship with the incidence of the disease in the capitals (R 2 = 26 %, P =. 05 for a power model). The stone risk index was associated nonlinearly with the <b>calculus</b> <b>incidence</b> (R 2 = 28. 4 %, P =. 04). Conclusions. Urinary <b>calculus</b> <b>incidence</b> was inversely related with drinking water magnesium content. We introduced a new index constructed on the foundation of a pathophysiologically based formula; the stone risk index had a strong positive association with <b>calculus</b> <b>incidence.</b> This index can have therapeutic and preventive applications, yet to be confirmed by clinical trials. </p...|$|R

Methods: A total of 80 female guinea pigs were divided into normal control group, untreated group, ursodeoxycholic acid group (UDCA group) and SQC group. The cholesterol gallstone was induced by feeding the guinea pigs with high-fat lithogenic diet. SQC and UDCA were separately administered to the guinea pigs in the SQC group and UDCA group.

These individuals tend to suffer particularly from dental problems, such as gingival enlargement, gingivitis, poor oral hygiene, dental hypoplasia, and caries. Saliva composition influences oral hygiene and disease states. We investigated saliva composition and its association with the oral health of young recipients of liver transplants. Methods: In 70 patients, 36 liver transplant recipients (ages 2 - 23 years) and 34 healthy controls (ages 4 - 21 years), we measured the following variables: (a) oral hygiene, (b) gingival inflammation, (c) caries status, (d) dental calculus formation, (e) oral mucosal pH, and (f) salivary protein composition. Results: Lower mean decayed, missing, and filled teeth index (P= 0. 0038), higher mean gingival index (P= 0. 0001), and higher mean calculus score (P= 0. 003) were found in the transplanted study group compared with the control. The mean mucosal pH for seven intraoral sites was higher in the transplant group (P= 0. 0006). The median salivary albumin concentration was significantly lower in the transplant group (P= 0. 01), as was the median salivary albumin/total protein ratio (P= 0. 0002). Conclusions: In post-liver transplant pediatric recipients, low incidence of caries, together with high <b>incidence</b> of dental <b>calculus,</b> could be attributed to elevated oral mucosal pH.

The 104 individuals were divided into 31 male, 25 female and 48 individuals of undefinable sex, mainly children (n= 41). Out of 354 missing teeth 74. 6 % were lost post-mortem because of the bad state of preservation. The remaining 25. 4 % were lost presumably due to carious or parodontal reasons. The caries frequency was 37. 5 % of all individuals or 5. 84 % of all available teeth. Only 14. 6 % of carious individuals were children. The caries frequency continuously increased from the age category maturus. Accumulations concerned male molars. The average caries degree was 2. 9 ± 0. 9. Tendentiously, caries was more pronounced in maxilla, in molars and in men. Calculus was found in 77. 8 % of the individuals with permanent dentition, frequently in mandibular molars. The mean calculus severity grade was 1. 4 ± 0, 5 with differences referring to gender, upper/lower jaw, single tooth or age. Sturdy plaque of grade III-IV was only seen in 3 % of individuals, but because of post-mortem damage calculus might {{have been much more}} frequent in vivo. Tooth wear was detected in 88. 9 % of individuals, more often and heavier in mandibular teeth, esp. molars. The extent of abrasion increased with age. The mean abrasion of all individuals was 1. 9 ± 0. 9 on a five stage scale. Especially molars of men were often affected by heavy tooth wear. Bony resorption as a sign of untreated chronic periodontopathies was present in 85. 7 % of all individuals with permanent dentition. The mean bone loss was 4. 1 ± 2. 2 mm. Here, too, male sex, molars, mandible and a higher age were predisposing factors. As notable features we found a total absence of fourth molars, two retinated and two impacted teeth and three individuals with one cyst each. The results of our paleoodontologic investigations of the grave site Wüstung Göritz are characteristic for an abrasive nutrition.
