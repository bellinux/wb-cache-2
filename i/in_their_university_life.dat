Results {{from this study}} support the empirical findings of prior literature on the FB as a social networking and social capital tool (Ellison et al. [...] 2007; Kosik 2007; Neibling 2010). In particular, our study contributed to the strand of literature that explored the FB as a method for developing ‘maintained social capital,’ i.e., the ability {{to stay in touch}} with members of a community of which the individual is member (Ellison et al. 2007), since the students pointed out that the FB contributed to build relationship which could be fruitful for the future of their university life. In fact, students who joined this study declared that they are keen to link to university groups on the FB in order to pursue other than learning objectives and improve their experience at university. At a general level of analysis of the students’ experience <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>university</b> <b>life,</b> some researchers found that there is a gap between students’ expectations and their perception of the reality they experience at university (Cheong Cheng and Ming Tam 1997; McInnis et al. 2000; Sander et al. 2000). The student-environment fit has been addressed as a relevant issue in terms of student retention (McInnis et al. 2000). Whenever students feel they are part of the community <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>university</b> <b>life,</b> they are more likely to successfully complete the programme. On the other hand, when they perceive a distance from the group, they are more dissatisfied and decide to leave university (Tinto and Love 1995). In our study, students declared they used the FB group to link with new students, attending the same class, whom they did not meet before, and this improved their university experience, since they perceived that this social network would have been useful to solve future problems that could arise <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>university</b> <b>life.</b> These results are in line with the study by Ryan et al. (2011) who analyzed how relational ties on the FB helped PhD students to get involved in a PhD program abroad. This is also the case for the student–lecturer relationship, since students stated they positively valued the availability of a FB group for the class they attended; in fact they viewed the lecturer involved in a FB group as more open toward their students, compared to other lecturers. Prior studies identified being approachable as one of the key characteristics students addressed for a good lecturer, together with teaching skills, teaching methods, communication skills, enthusiasm, expertise, humor, and friendliness (Voss et al. 2007).|$|E

40|$|Introduction Most {{experts agree}} that in the general {{population}} old teenagers and young adults tend to be the most sexually active and therefore at higher risk than some other groups Curtin 1996. Making continuous assessment on the degree of awareness and behavioral change on prevention of HIVAIDS is uninterrupted work. Since this age group is found in high schools colleges and University. This research work is interested to assess the sexual behaviors related to the prevention of HIVAIDS in these education institutions. This study may contribute in initiating concerned policy makers health workers teachers administrators and parents NGOs to assess their strategies and strengthen their efforts in order to create better awareness behavioral change and accessibilities for prevention of HIVAIDS. It may also strengthen the global efforts on prevention of HIVAIDS. Objectives-To assess the status of safe sexual behavior in the educational institutions and promote prevention of HIVAIDS Methodology-Institutions based cross sectional study design was employed. This research work has been carried out by dispatching self administered questionnaires randomly among the students of secondary preparatory TVET CTE University educational institutions found in central zone of Tigray region Ethiopia. Two sections departments were selected randomly from each institution. The collected data was analyzed quantitatively entering in to a computer using SPSS Version 16 using Chi-square Annova Sign test. Result More students found abstinence females 82. 8 males 72. 4. Sexually active students not found in first primary level. But in both sexes sexually active students found in junior primary level 7 thamp 8 th grade in which males are significantly more than females. In both sexes majority students have started sexual activity in their secondary level 9 th amp 10 th. The very interesting thing here is all female students who have arrived with abstinence to university level continue likewise. But among the male students who have arrived with abstinence only 4. 4 of them break their abstinence <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>university</b> <b>life.</b> In both sexes majority of those who have started sexual activity continue likewise females 85. 5 males 67. 4. Unlike to this half of the male students who have arrived sexually active to university level stopped their sexual activity after their arrival. Majority students in both sexes used to mate only with their friends females 73. 6 males 71. 2. Unlike to this majority of the sexually active preparatory male students 80 found to used promiscuous sexual behavior. Similarly about half the female 58. 3 and male 53. 8 university students found to use promiscuous sexual behavior. The other unlike behavior is majority female students 69. 6 as well as male students 66 were not on using condom regularity. The main reasons given by female students not to use condom regularly was because of trusting their boyfriends 37. 1 they dislike it 31. 4 their boyfriends dislike it 25. 7. Likewise the reasons given by male students were because they trust their girlfriends 44. 3 they dislike it 24. 3 their girlfriends dislike it 22. 9. In both sexes as well as in all level of education majority students had made HIVAIDS checkup. And among these 1. 6 females and 2 males found HIVAIDS positive in which the secondary level students account highest females 8. 6 and males 9. However 15. 5 female and 14. 6 male students have been found unchecked for HIVAIDS. The given reason by female students was lack of available chance 40. 7 confidence 35. 6 and frighten the news might be bad 22. Likewise the reason by male students was confidence 43. 3 lack of available chance 31. 7 and frighten the news might be e bad 18. 3. Conclusion and recommendation Although majority students found sexual abstinence. considerable number of them had been sexually active. About half of the female and male sexually active university students were found to make promiscuous sexual behavior. In addition to this condition 69. 6 the sexually active female students as well as 66 of the sexually active male students were found not on regular use of condom.

This paper {{is an attempt to}} apply a broadly discursive approach {{to the study of the}} {{transition from}} school or college to the first year of university teaching. The aims of the project were twofold: to generate a clearer perspective of the specific needs of first year students, identifying implications for induction, student support and teaching methods and to contribute to the growing number of studies theorising student learning. The paper is based on a small-scale ethnographic research project carried out at the University of the West of England between February and April, 2006. The research process made use of use of focus groups, which are thought to be by far the most effective method for eliciting ‘ordinary conversation’, as opposed to the more official-seeming and less ‘rich’ questionnaire method.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is to present a case study of an {{integrated}} course approach to student transition in an undergraduate agricultural business management program. This wholistic approach is particularly relevant to courses with small student intake (defined here as less or equal to 20 full time students). These small intakes represent approximately 38 % of all intakes in Australian universities. Most universities have an orientation week with generic and course specific activities to assist students <b>in</b> <b>their</b> transition to <b>university</b> <b>life</b> but very few have a ‘total package’ of sustained transitional support with an overnight tour, mentoring program, curriculum mapping and course design for all of the first stage subjects as just some of their strategies. The transition was planned to take place over the entire first stage of the course. A course team working collaboratively and cohesively was paramount to the success of this project. The approach was first implemented in 2010 and three years of data are presented here. These data clearly demonstrate that although student grades did not significantly improve, student satisfaction and perception of the “worth” of the various fundamental subjects taught in the first year of their course increased. This is associated with a recent decrease in first year student attrition. Finally and perhaps more importantly, academics reported that students seemed to display a higher standard of academic literacy and deeper critical thinking <b>in</b> <b>their</b> various assessment tasks...|$|R

Seventy percent of the students were subjected to one of 17 types of violent or discriminatory acts investigated during <b>their</b> <b>university</b> <b>life</b> <b>in</b> the <b>university</b> facilities or in practice sites. The most frequent events reported by students were: abuse of authority (43 %), taunts, gestures and obscene compliments (32 %), psychological aggression (27 %); verbal aggression (19 %); and discrimination due to physical appearance (12 %). Conclusion. A high proportion of nursing students participating in the study were subjected to acts of violence and discrimination. It is necessary for the university to generate welfare strategies to change attitudes related to these actions...|$|R
50|$|A common {{misconception}} is {{that the}} IGETC is an admission requirement into a university. The IGETC is a recommended certification that students receive from community college. Students that complete the IGETC are waived from general breadth courses <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>university.</b> By waiving these classes students can save money by fulfilling general education requirements in a cheaper institution.|$|R

In 2012 they measured thrust from <b>their</b> prototype, however <b>in</b> 2014 they found this had been an experimental error. A second, improved prototype did not produce any measured thrust.|$|R
