5|$|Other vocalisations {{of wolves}} are usually {{divided into three}} categories: growls, barks and whines. Barking has a <b>fundamental</b> <b>frequency</b> between 320–904Hz, and is usually emitted by startled wolves. Wolves do not bark as loudly or {{continuously}} as dogs do, but bark {{a few times and}} retreat from perceived danger. Growling has a <b>fundamental</b> <b>frequency</b> of 380–450Hz, and is usually emitted during food challenges. Pups commonly growl when playing. One variation of the howl is accompanied by a high pitched whine, which precedes a lunging attack. Whining is associated with situations of anxiety, curiosity, inquiry and intimacy such as greeting, feeding pups and playing.|$|E
5|$|The {{speed of}} sound in helium is nearly three times the {{speed of sound}} in air. Because the <b>fundamental</b> <b>frequency</b> of a {{gas-filled}} cavity is proportional to {{the speed of sound}} in the gas, when helium is inhaled there is a corresponding increase in the resonant frequencies of the vocal tract. The <b>fundamental</b> <b>frequency</b> (sometimes called pitch) does not change, since this is produced by direct vibration of the vocal folds, which is unchanged. However, the higher resonant frequencies cause a change in timbre, resulting in a reedy, duck-like vocal quality. The opposite effect, lowering resonant frequencies, can be obtained by inhaling a dense gas such as sulfur hexafluoride or xenon.|$|E
5|$|For {{the most}} part Cage avoids using lower {{registers}} of the piano, {{and much of the}} music's melodic foreground lies in the soprano range. Of the forty-five prepared notes, only three belong to the three lowest octaves below F#3: D3, D2 and D1. Furthermore, D2 is prepared {{in such a way that}} the resulting sound has the frequency of a D4 (resulting in two variants of D4 available, one more prepared than the other). The portion of the keyboard above F#3 is divided into roughly three registers: low, middle, and high. The low register has the heaviest preparation, and the high register the lightest. Different methods are used: certain notes produce sounds that retain the original frequency and a pianistic character; others become drum-like sounds, detuned versions of the original notes, or metallic, rattling sounds that have no sense of the <b>fundamental</b> <b>frequency</b> at all. The use of the soft pedal, which makes the hammers strike only two of the three strings of each note (or one, for notes with only two strings), complicates the matter further. For example, the note C5 is a metallic sound with no fundamental discernible when the soft pedal is depressed, but it sounds fairly normal if the pedal is released. It appears that Cage was fully aware of the implications of this: certain sonatas feature interplay between two versions of one note, others place special emphasis on particular notes, and still others are very dependent on particular note combinations.|$|E

30|$|We {{present an}} {{algorithm}} for {{the estimation of}} <b>fundamental</b> <b>frequencies</b> in voiced audio signals. The method {{is based on an}} autocorrelation of a signal with a segment of the same signal.

The fast estimation of <b>fundamental</b> <b>frequencies</b> with low error rate and simple implementation is interesting for real-time speech signal processing.|$|R
25|$|Perceived pitch {{typically}} {{depends on}} the <b>fundamental</b> <b>frequency,</b> though the dependence could be mediated solely {{by the presence of}} harmonics corresponding to that <b>fundamental</b> <b>frequency.</b> The perception of a pitch without the corresponding <b>fundamental</b> <b>frequency</b> in the physical stimulus is called the pitch of the missing fundamental. Neurons lateral to A1 in marmoset monkeys were found to be sensitive specifically to the <b>fundamental</b> <b>frequency</b> of a complex tone, suggesting that pitch constancy may be enabled by such a neural mechanism.|$|E

The sawtooths alternate between bandlimited (non-aliased) sawtooths and aliased sawtooths and the sampling rate is 22.05kHz. The bandlimited sawtooths are synthesized from the sawtooth waveform's Fourier series such that no harmonics above the Nyquist frequency are present.|$|E

Of the ten speakers whose voices were analyzed {{over a long period of}} time, all underwent a drop in <b>fundamental</b> <b>frequency</b> in the early stages of HRT; however, testosterone could not account for all the changes in the voice and mannerisms. The dissertation concludes that social factors also affect changes in transmasculine voices.|$|E
25|$|In 1714, Brook Taylor derived the <b>fundamental</b> <b>frequency</b> of a {{stretched}} vibrating string {{in terms}} of its tension and mass per unit length by solving a differential equation. The Swiss mathematician Daniel Bernoulli (1700–1782) made important mathematical studies of the behavior of gases, anticipating the kinetic theory of gases developed more than a century later, and has been referred to as the first mathematical physicist. In 1733, Daniel Bernoulli derived the <b>fundamental</b> <b>frequency</b> and harmonics of a hanging chain by solving a differential equation. In 1734, Bernoulli solved the differential equation for the vibrations of an elastic bar clamped at one end. Bernoulli's treatment of fluid dynamics and his examination of fluid flow was introduced in his 1738 work Hydrodynamica.|$|E

Non-linear loads create harmonic currents in addition to the original (<b>fundamental</b> <b>frequency)</b> AC current. This is of importance in practical power systems that contain non-linear loads such as rectifiers, some forms of electric lighting, electric arc furnaces, welding equipment, switched-mode power supplies, variable speed drives and other devices. Filters consisting of linear capacitors and inductors can prevent harmonic currents from entering the supplying system.|$|E

It is concluded that the antisymmetric stretch exhibits a significant matrix shift in the matrix isolation experiments and that the matrix environment is not representative of the gas-phase environment for ozonide anion.

25|$|A termite-bored didgeridoo has an {{irregular}} shape that, overall, usually increases in diameter towards the lower end. This shape means that its resonances occur at frequencies {{that are not}} harmonically spaced in frequency. This contrasts with the harmonic spacing of the resonances in a cylindrical plastic pipe, whose resonant frequencies fall in the ratio 1:3:5 etc. The second resonance of a didgeridoo (the note sounded by overblowing) is usually around an 11th higher than the <b>fundamental</b> <b>frequency</b> (a frequency ratio somewhat less than 3:1).|$|E
25|$|When {{confronted by}} a {{periodically}} varying function, the standard approach is to employ Fourier series, a form of analysis that uses sinusoidal functions as a basis set, having frequencies that are zero, one, two, three, etc. times the frequency of a particular fundamental cycle. These multiples are called harmonics of the <b>fundamental</b> <b>frequency,</b> and the process is termed harmonic analysis. If the basis set of sinusoidal functions suit the behaviour being modelled, relatively few harmonic terms need to be added. Orbital paths are very nearly circular, so sinusoidal variations are suitable for tides.|$|E
25|$|In music theory, {{the just}} {{intonation}} of the diatonic scale involves regular numbers: the pitches {{in a single}} octave of this scale have frequencies proportional to the numbers in the sequence 24, 27, 30, 32, 36, 40, 45, 48 of nearly consecutive regular numbers. Thus, for an instrument with this tuning, all pitches are regular-number harmonics of a single <b>fundamental</b> <b>frequency.</b> This scale is called a 5-limit tuning, meaning that the interval between any two pitches {{can be described as}} a product 2i3j5k of powers of the prime numbers up to 5, or equivalently as a ratio of regular numbers.|$|E
