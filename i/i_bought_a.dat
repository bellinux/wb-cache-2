25|$|In 2009, Buffett {{divested}} his failed {{investment in}} ConocoPhillips, saying to his Berkshire investors, <b>I</b> <b>bought</b> <b>a</b> {{large amount of}} ConocoPhillips stock when oil and gas prices were near their peak. I in no way anticipated the dramatic fall in energy prices {{that occurred in the}} last half of the year. I still believe the odds are good that oil sells far higher in the future than the current $40–$50 price. But so far I have been dead wrong. Even if prices should rise, moreover, the terrible timing of my purchase has cost Berkshire several billion dollars.|$|E

In 1978, {{in an effort}} to produce Monty Python's Life of Brian, they formed the film production and distribution company HandMade Films. Harrison explained: [...] "The name of the company came about as a bit of a joke. I'd been to Wooky Hole in Somerset... an old paper mill where they show you how to make old underpants into paper. So <b>I</b> <b>bought</b> <b>a</b> few rolls, and they had this watermark 'British Handmade Paper'... So we said... we'll call it Handmade Films." ...|$|E

People were shooting speed. I mean, it was real Night of the Living Dead. So <b>I</b> <b>bought</b> <b>a</b> truck and headed out west. I traveled all around the country for a couple of years, looking for musicians who had heart, instead of playing 20-minute guitar solos, which is pure ego." ...|$|E
