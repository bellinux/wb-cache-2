5|$|In 1753 the French began <b>expanding</b> <b>their</b> {{military}} control {{into the}} Ohio Country, a territory already {{claimed by the}} British colonies of Virginia and Pennsylvania. These competing claims led to {{a war in the}} colonies called the French and Indian War (1754–62) and contributed {{to the start of the}} global Seven Years' War (1756–63). By chance, Washington became involved in its beginning.|$|E

5|$|The canal became disused after 1898 and officially {{closed in}} 1902, being sold {{off to the}} various railway {{companies}} who were <b>expanding</b> <b>their</b> networks.

In October 2006 a grant was obtained from the Heritage Lottery Fund to carry out a technical study on one of the locks and its associated structures at Combe Hay.|$|E
5|$|The {{reintroduction}} effort off the Oregon coast was not successful.

5|$|While the {{controversy}} raged, American Presbyterians were also concerned with <b>expanding</b> <b>their</b> influence. In 1740, a New York Board of the Society in Scotland for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge was established. Four years later, David Brainerd was assigned as a missionary to the Native Americans. New Side Presbyterians {{were responsible for}} founding Princeton University (originally the College of New Jersey) primarily to train ministers in 1746.|$|E
5|$|By the 19th century, European {{colonialism}} in Africa {{had reached}} its height. Having {{lost control of}} the vast territory of Brazil in South America, the Portuguese began to focus on <b>expanding</b> <b>their</b> African outposts. This brought them into direct conflict with the British. Since David Livingstone had returned to the area in 1858 in an attempt to foster trade routes, British interest in Mozambique had risen, alarming the Portuguese government. During the 19th century, much of Eastern Africa was still being brought under British control, and in order to facilitate this, Britain required several concessions from the Portuguese colony.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, the FCC {{modified}} its media ownership {{rules to}} count LMAs formed after November 5, 1996 that cover more than 15% {{of the broadcast}} day toward the ownership limits for the brokering station's owner. Even still, the related joint sales and shared services agreement structures became increasingly common during the 2000s; these outsourcing agreements proliferated between 2011 and 2013, when station owners such as Sinclair and the Nexstar Broadcasting Group began <b>expanding</b> <b>their</b> portfolios by acquiring additional stations {{in an effort to}} drive scale as well as to gain leverage in retransmission consent negotiations with cable and satellite television providers.|$|E

5|$|The Edwardian castles {{and town}} walls in Gwynedd were {{built as a}} {{consequence}} of the wars fought for the control of Wales in the late 13th century. The kings of England and the Welsh princes had vied for control of the region since the 1070s, with Norman and English nobles and settlers slowly <b>expanding</b> <b>their</b> territories over several centuries. In the 1260s, however, the Welsh leader Llywelyn ap Gruffudd exploited a civil war between Henry III and rebel barons in England to become the dominant power, and was formally recognised as the prince of Wales under the Treaty of Montgomery.|$|E
5|$|The {{intricacies of}} Laotian affairs, and U.S. and North Vietnamese {{interference}} in them, {{led to a}} mutual policy of each ignoring the other, {{at least in the}} public eye. However, this didn't prevent the North Vietnamese from violating Laos's neutrality by protecting and <b>expanding</b> <b>their</b> supply conduit, and by supporting their Pathet Lao allies in their war against the central government. U.S. intervention {{came in the form of}} building and supporting a CIA-backed clandestine army in its fight with the Communists and constantly bombing the trail. They also provided heavy support for the Laotian government.|$|E
5|$|While {{the global}} {{financial}} system is edging toward greater stability, governments must deal with differing regional or national needs. Some nations are trying to orderly discontinue unconventional monetary policies installed to cultivate recovery, while others are <b>expanding</b> <b>their</b> scope and scale. Emerging market policymakers face a challenge of precision as they must carefully institute sustainable macroeconomic policies during extraordinary market sensitivity without provoking investors to retreat their capital to stronger markets. Nations' inability to align interests and achieve international consensus on matters such as banking regulation has perpetuated the risk of future global financial catastrophes.|$|E

5|$|After Georgia Tech's post-score kickoff, Wake Forest {{continued}} to struggle on offense. Quarterback Riley Skinner was sacked, threw an 18-yard completion, then three incomplete passes. Wake {{was forced to}} punt the ball away again, allowing the Yellow Jackets the possibility of <b>expanding</b> <b>their</b> lead. On Tech's first play after the punt, however, Reggie Ball's pass was intercepted, allowing Wake Forest another chance on offense. The play turned {{the momentum of the}} game in favor of Wake Forest, who proceeded to move the ball with slightly more effectiveness. During the Wake Forest drive, Skinner completed a 39-yard pass to John Tereshinski, who drove the Deacons inside Georgia Tech territory, where the drive continued. Though Wake Forest was forced to settle for a 33-yard field goal from kicker Sam Swank, the score tied the game at 66 with 7:59 remaining in the game.|$|E
5|$|Both the 1930s episode and the {{outbreak}} of competitive devaluation that began in 2009 occurred during global economic downturns. An important difference with the 2010s period is that international traders are much better able to hedge their exposures to exchange rate volatility due to more sophisticated financial markets. A second difference is that during the later period devaluations have invariably been effected by nations <b>expanding</b> <b>their</b> money supplies—either by creating money to buy foreign currency, {{in the case of}} direct interventions, or by creating money to inject into their domestic economies, with quantitative easing. If all nations try to devalue at once, the net effect on exchange rates could cancel out leaving them largely unchanged, but the expansionary effect of the interventions would remain. So while there has been no collaborative intent, some economists such as Berkeley's Barry Eichengreen and Goldman Sachs's Dominic Wilson have suggested the net effect will be similar to semi-coordinated monetary expansion which will help the global economy.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of Catherine's ukase of 1788, just as other nations were {{entering}} the maritime fur trade, the Russians had spent over 40 years establishing and <b>expanding</b> <b>their</b> maritime operations in North America. A number of colonies were being established over a large region stretching from the Aleutian Islands to Cook Inlet and Prince William Sound. Many ships sailed from Kamchatka to Alaska each year. The Russians not only had an early start, but they also controlled the habitats {{of the most valuable}} sea otters. The Kurilian, Kamchatkan, and Aleutian sea otters' fur was thicker, glossier, and blacker than those on the Northwest Coast and California. The four grades of fur were based on color, texture, and thickness. The most prized furs were those of Kurilian and Kamchatkan sea otters, Aleutian furs were second grade, those of the Northwest Coast third, and the poorest grade was those of Californian sea otters. Russia also controlled the sources of sable furs, the most valuable fur-bearing land mammal.|$|E

5|$|Myrmecophilous (ant-loving) {{caterpillars}} of {{the butterfly}} family Lycaenidae (e.g., blues, coppers, or hairstreaks) are herded by the ants, led to feeding {{areas in the}} daytime, and brought inside the ants' nest at night. The caterpillars have a gland which secretes honeydew when the ants massage them. Some caterpillars produce vibrations and sounds that are perceived by the ants. A similar adaptation {{can be seen in}} Grizzled skipper butterflies that emit vibrations by <b>expanding</b> <b>their</b> wings in order to communicate with ants, which are natural predators of these butterflies. Other caterpillars have evolved from ant-loving to ant-eating: these myrmecophagous caterpillars secrete a pheromone that makes the ants act as if the caterpillar is one of their own larvae. The caterpillar is then taken into the ant nest where it feeds on the ant larvae.|$|E
5|$|Nixon {{had been}} a firm {{supporter}} of Kennedy in the 1961 Bay of Pigs Invasion and 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis; on taking office he stepped up covert operations against Cuba and its president, Fidel Castro. He maintained close relations with the Cuban-American exile community through his friend, Bebe Rebozo, who often suggested ways of irritating Castro. These activities concerned the Soviets and Cubans, who feared Nixon might attack Cuba and break the understanding between Kennedy and Khrushchev which had ended the missile crisis. In August 1970, the Soviets asked Nixon to reaffirm the understanding; despite his hard line against Castro, Nixon agreed. The process {{had not yet been}} completed when the Soviets began <b>expanding</b> <b>their</b> base at the Cuban port of Cienfuegos in October 1970. A minor confrontation ensued, which was concluded with an understanding that the Soviets would not use Cienfuegos for submarines bearing ballistic missiles. The final round of diplomatic notes, reaffirming the 1962 accord, were exchanged in November.|$|E
5|$|The {{process was}} not without obstacles, however. The Neapolitan nobles distrusted Skanderbeg since the Kastrioti family had {{previously}} been allied with Venice. Alfonso himself had been offended when he asked Skanderbeg to attack Venice along with Đurađ Branković and the Albanian refused. Alfonso was also a devout Christian and found it uneasy to ally with Skanderbeg who had previously practiced Islam in the Ottoman court. On the other hand, Skanderbeg had been disillusioned when Alfonso failed to send any troops to Krujë when they were most needed. But things changed once Skanderbeg had thwarted the Ottoman Army. Both Venice and Alfonso grew an interest in <b>expanding</b> <b>their</b> powers in the Adriatic and the Ionian. On 26 March 1451, the Treaty of Gaeta was signed, creating an Albanian-Aragonese alliance.|$|E
