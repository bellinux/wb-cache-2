40|$|Telecommunication {{has been}} a {{necessity}} in all countries this century. Communication {{has always been an}} essential part of our lives, education, family relations, business, government and other organizational activities. As telecommunication technology has advanced, so has the need for the <b>interception</b> <b>of</b> <b>telecommunications</b> and access by law enforcement authorities.

Telecommunications interception and access law should also place a great deal of importance on the privacy of the individual as well as the needs of national security, crime investigation, counter terrorism efforts and economic growth. This paper looks at the applicability of regulations aimed at controlling telecommunications interception and access law in Arab countries. The Australian telecommunications interception and access law is taken as a relevant template that can be examined in light of Arab countries needs and requirements.

40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} the issue of {{wiretapping}} and <b>interception</b> <b>of</b> <b>telecommunications</b> pursuant to Section 88 of the Czech Criminal Procedure Act. It deals also with the question of the so called metering which is governed by a separate Section within the Czech Criminal Procedure Act, Section 88 a. The main purpose of this thesis is to provide thorough analysis of these two legal issues, taking into consideration domestic, international and partially also foreign legal provisions. This thesis is systematically divided into three main chapters which offer sequential elaboration on domestic, "European" and Slovak legislation. Each of these chapters is split into several separate parts. In Chapter One, I outline concept, major principles and procedure applying to wiretapping and interception of telecommunication on one hand, and concept, major principles and procedure applying to metering on the other hand. Issue of application of wiretap and interception of telecommunication obtained from foreign authority, as well as question of usage of acquired e-mail content are dealt with in two separate parts of this chapter. Moreover, I focus on utilization of the intercepted wiretap, in case it has been procured by a private individual. Second Chapter is dedicated to help the reader understand the [...] ...|$|E

40|$|This Working Paper {{is based}} on two {{research}} reports that were {{the outcome of the}} research carried out by the team of the Université Libre de Bruxelles within the FP 7 project SURVEILLE. 1 Such research focused on the use of surveillance technologies for the prevention, investigation, and prosecution of serious crime. Taken together, the two reports developed a comparative analysis of a number of surveillance technologies and techniques used at different stages of the criminal procedure within selected national jurisdictions. The first project deliverable, finalised in October 2012 and entitled “The use of surveillance technologies for the prevention and investigation of serious crime” (D 4. 1) 2, addressed the use of the <b>interception</b> <b>of</b> <b>telecommunications</b> and video-surveillance in three countries, namely France, Italy and the United Kingdom. The second deliverable, finalised in April 2013 and entitled “Comparative law paper on data retention regulation on a sample of EU Member States” (D 4. 3), examined the rules governing the retention of data by telecommunications companies and internet service providers for criminal justice purposes in nine countries (i. e. Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Spain and the United Kingdom). The two reports test the existence of what the authors call a double shift: the means at the disposal of competent national authorities (intelligence services and law enforcement agencies) in the fight against serious crime are evolving {{in such a way that}} the share of tasks and competences is now increasingly blurred. The fundamental rights dimension was the normative background of the legal dimensions of the SURVEILLE project as a whole, and thus also of the present work. The impact of evolving trends in the use of surveillance upon the right to privacy and the right to the protection of personal data are at the core of this research undertaking. The authors wish to highlight that legislation is changing very quickly in this domain both at the national level and at the EU level. In particular, the January 2015 attacks in Paris against Charlie Hebdo, the February 2015 attacks in Copenhagen and the increasing threat resulting from the foreign fighters phenomenon are significantly challenging the effectiveness of means used by States to prevent, investigate, detect and prosecute terrorist offences. Recent legislative developments deepen the blur between the tasks and functions of intelligence services and law enforcement agencies as well as the blur between administrative and criminal law measures. Furthermore, with the ruling by the Court of Justice of the European Union on 8 April 2014 in the Digital Rights Ireland case 3 - partially reaffirmed in Schrems 4, EU Member States together with EU institutions have to rethink the legal framework concerning the use of surveillance technologies and techniques in order to ensure a coherent relationship between on the one hand safeguarding the right to privacy and the protection of personal data, and on the other hand developing effective means to prevent, investigate, detect and prosecute serious crime. Despite the fact that the two papers were written at least two years ago, the information remains largely up to date. These papers analyse a trend that has been occurring for some years and that is not over yet: a massive use of surveillance technologies and techniques by an increasing number of competent authorities leading to an exponential gathering of information by EU Member States aiming to fight more effectively against serious crime - often at the expense of fundamental rights...|$|E
