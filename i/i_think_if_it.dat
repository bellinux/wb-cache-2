500|$|Despite the {{favorable}} reviews and good chart {{position of the}} lead single, 1000 Fires did not achieve mainstream success. Lords later commented: [...] "The problem with that album {{was that it was}} ahead of its time. Electronica was just starting to happen. Moby was just starting to be huge. I opened for Thrill Kill Kult and Moby as a DJ back then. The masses didn't know who Moby was. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> had been slightly delayed it would have done better. Madonna had it right to wait for Ray of Light. She has been a lot better with her timing than me. I am proud of that album because I hear it now and it still feels current. It doesn't feel dated." ...|$|E
2500|$|In February 2008, Weitz told The Daily Yomiuri, a Japanese newspaper, that {{he still}} hoped for the sequels' production: [...] "at first it looked like we were down for the count because in the U.S. [...] under{{performed}}, but then internationally it performed [...] than expectations. So, {{a lot depends on}} Japan, frankly... <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> does well enough here we'll be in good shape for that." [...] Although producer Deborah Forte had, in March 2008, expressed optimism that the sequels would be made, by October 2008, the two planned sequels were officially placed on hold, according to New Line Cinema, because of financial concerns during the global recession. Sam Elliott, however, stated, [...] "The Catholic Church ... lambasted them, and I think it scared New Line off." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Faith No More {{was brought}} up in a 1999 {{interview}} with The A.V. Club, Patton (then fronting Mr. Bungle) stated [...] "I'm definitely glad it's over: It was a great thing while it lasted, but it really had to end. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> had continued it would have gotten really ugly. No fistfights or bloody noses or anything like that, but the music would have been substandard. So the line must be drawn there." [...] In another interview from 2001, he similarly stated that the band had broken up [...] "because we were starting to make bad music." [...] However, Gould did not share the same sentiment as Patton {{on the quality of the}} band's late material, stating in 1998 [...] "However many records we sold or didn't, we maintained over a long [...] period of time a high standard of music that we're proud of, and we never sucked. Whatever shit that happened to us on the way, thank God it didn't get in the way of the music." ...|$|E
5000|$|During the campaign, Kennedy was {{frequently}} met by large crowds. Keating accused Kennedy {{of being a}} carpetbagger. Kennedy responded to these charges in a televised town meeting by saying, [...] "If the senator {{of the state of}} New York is going be selected on who's lived here the longest, then <b>I</b> <b>think</b> people are going vote for my opponent. <b>If</b> <b>it's</b> going be selected on who's got the best New York accent, then <b>I</b> <b>think</b> I'm probably out too. But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>it's</b> going be {{selected on the basis of}} who can make the best United States senator, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> I'm still in the contest." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{is for you}} to find out, Betty," [...] I said. [...] "By {{the time}} you come back you will have {{discovered}} <b>it,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think.</b> <b>If</b> not, <b>it</b> will not have proved itself a good reason and shall be forgotten." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] she said, [...] "you {{will sit}} still while I see {{what can be}} found. It will be my part to cook and bake and wait on you. <b>I</b> almost <b>think,</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> were necessary, <b>I</b> could drive a team, too." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, {{judging by}} the recent brides, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> had been me, I should have gone in search of Mrs. Ulick O'More's younger sister.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed, my dear, I {{hope it will}} be {{something}} well managed. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> were not for those middle-men, lace-making would not be so bad. But you must not keep poor Miss Williams waiting." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Softly--softly," [...] {{said the}} Syndic, [...] "I have told it you too soon, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> puts you {{into such a}} hasty fluster. Now I have some more matter for your ear, if I saw you had some {{patience}} to listen to me." ...|$|E
60|$|Never! <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> even <b>if</b> <b>it</b> weren't necessary, I {{should make}} him stay now. You and I are not people {{to run away}} from danger. After all, we're not obliged to yield to our passions--we can control them if we want to. For your own sake you must stay, Violet.|$|R
6000|$|... "But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> is. <b>If</b> <b>it</b> be {{good for}} a young man to marry it must {{be good for}} a young woman also. The one makes the other necessary." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{little lady}} smiled at him. [...] "Oh, I understand. That {{is what made}} me almost afraid. It cannot be nice to borrow from a woman. Still, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> you could, <b>if</b> <b>it</b> was necessary, do even harder things." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] he {{said after}} a moment, [...] "it strikes you. Of course it strikes me. Of course what's in store for me may be no more than that. The only thing is," [...] he went on, [...] "that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> had been that I should by this time know." ...|$|E
6000|$|He bids her refrain {{herself from}} tears, by this promise, that her {{children}} should come {{again from the}} land of the enemy, from death. And again, said he, Thy children shall come again to their own border; which <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> be meant in a gospel sense, must be to the heavenly inheritance. Compare Jeremiah 31:15-17 with Matthew 2:18.28 ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's a bad smash--very bad," [...] he {{explained}} to Morris; [...] "something must have fallen on him, <b>I</b> <b>think.</b> <b>If</b> <b>it</b> had been {{an inch or two}} higher, he'd have lost his leg, or his life, or both, as perhaps he will now. At the best it means a couple of months or so on his back. No, I think the cut on his head isn't serious, although it has knocked him silly for a while." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do {{not think}} you {{would be likely to}} be ill so long as you might have been had you {{encountered}} a gale directly {{we got out of the}} river, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>if</b> <b>it</b> comes on rough all those addicted to sea-sickness are likely to suffer more or less. Some people are ill every time rough weather comes along, however long the voyage. I suppose you don't know yet whether you are a good sailor or not?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, but, Emma, <b>I</b> should <b>think,</b> even <b>if</b> <b>it</b> {{be wrong}} to hold it, that cannot be your fault yet. You mean to restore it; and surely it must be better to keep it as yet, than to act {{directly}} against your mother's wishes.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Philanthropy is a generous, good, and {{beautiful}} profession, and I've chosen it for mine because I {{have much to}} give. I'm only the steward of the fortune Papa left me, and <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> use <b>it</b> wisely for the happiness of others, {{it will be more}} blest than <b>if</b> I keep <b>it</b> all for myself." ...|$|R
60|$|We {{pulled down}} {{a lot of these}} banyan ropes, some of them more than twenty feet long, to take away as curiosities. Corny thought it would be splendid to have a jumping-rope made of a banyan root, or rather trunklet. The banyans here are called wild fig-trees, which they really are, {{wherever}} they grow. There is a big one, not far from the town, which stands by itself, and has a lot of trunks coming down from the branches. It would take the conceit out of a hurricane, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> tried to blow down a banyan-tree.|$|E
60|$|In {{a chapel}} {{of the cathedral}} is an altar with facings of solid silver--at least they call it so, and I think myself it would go {{a couple of hundred}} to the ton (to speak after the fashion of the silver miners)--and before it is kept forever burning a small lamp. A devout lady who died, left money and {{contracted}} for unlimited masses for the repose of her soul, and also stipulated that this lamp should be kept lighted always, day and night. She did all this before she died, you understand. It is a very small lamp and a very dim one, and it could not work her much damage, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> went out altogether.|$|E
6000|$|... "When {{a man is}} at that point, he {{sees things}} more clearly, perhaps, than he did before. I know that I have wronged you, and, when the admiral said that you had done all in your power to shield me, I felt more humiliated than I did when that fatal letter was produced. I {{know what you have}} come for--to tell me that you bear me no malice. You are a fine fellow, Walsham, and deserve all your good fortune, just as I deserve what has befallen me. <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> had not been for the squire taking me up, I should never have come to this, but might have grown up a decent fellow. But my head was turned. I thought I {{was going to be a}} great man, and this is what has come of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] she said, [...] "I {{did speak}} of it, {{and she is}} very anxious that nothing shall be done in that direction. Even if the Italian should be caught, {{she would not have}} the affair again {{publicly}} discussed and dissected. She believes the man's story, and she never wants to hear of him again. Indeed, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>if</b> <b>it</b> should be proved that the Italian killed Mr. Chester on purpose, it would be the greatest blow that could be inflicted upon her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By the way," [...] I said, [...] "while <b>I</b> <b>think</b> of <b>it,</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> {{leave any}} books or papers here behind me, send them on at once. I have a knack {{of doing that}} sort of thing. I suppose," [...] I added, [...] "your lodgers often do leave some of their {{belongings}} behind them." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "It's {{the battle}} of life – the {{turbulence}} of the sea... I have been fond of the sea all my life, how wonderful it is, yet how terrible it is. But <b>I</b> often <b>think...</b> what <b>if</b> <b>it</b> suddenly changed its mind and didn't turn the tide? And came straight on? <b>If</b> <b>it</b> didn't stay and came {{on and on and}} on and on... That would be the end of it all." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{opened and}} closed a thin hand savagely while his voice rose to a harsher note. [...] "For one man killed by the bullet if war breaks out a hundred perish yearly under the driver's lash on the great roads and, I think, among the coffee plants. They are dumb cattle, here and in the Congo. They can not tell their troubles, {{and they have no}} friends. How could they when the white man grows rich by their toil and anguish? Still, this earth is the Lord's, and there are men in it who will listen when once what is being done in this land of {{darkness}} is clearly told them. One must believe it or throw away all faith in humanity. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> rested with me I would let these bushmen come down and crush their oppressors, since it seems {{there is no other way}} of making their sorrows known." ...|$|E
60|$|This is one {{phase of}} his character, {{and the most}} disagreeable one. It is only through my close {{association}} with him, thrown together as we are day after day, that I have observed it. Otherwise he is an agreeable companion, well-read and entertaining, and as gallant a seaman as ever trod a deck. I shall not easily forget {{the way in which}} he handled the ship when we were caught by a gale among the loose ice at the beginning of April. I have never seen him so cheerful, and even hilarious, as he was that night, as he paced backwards and forwards upon the bridge amid the flashing of the lightning and the howling of the wind. He has told me several times that the thought of death was a pleasant one to him, which is a sad thing for a young man to say; he cannot be much more than thirty, though his hair and moustache are already slightly grizzled. Some great sorrow must have overtaken him and blighted his whole life. Perhaps I should be the same if I lost my Flora--God knows! <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> were not for her that I should care very little whether the wind blew from the north or the south to-morrow.|$|E

There, I hear him come down the companion, and he has locked himself up in his room, which shows that he is still in an unamiable mood. And so to bed, as old Pepys would say, for the candle is burning down (we have to use them now since the nights are closing in), and the steward has turned in, so there are no hopes of another one.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am glad to}} {{hear you}} say that, brother," [...] Mysa said. [...] "I spoke to her last night about it, for she would insist on {{treating}} me as if she were still my servant; which is absurd, and not nice of her, when she is going out with us to share our dangers only because she loves me. It is I rather who should look up to her, for I am very helpless, and know nothing of work or real life, while she can do all sorts of things; besides, when we were captives it was she who was always brave and hopeful, and kept up my spirits when, <b>I</b> do <b>think,</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> had not been for her I should have died of grief and terror." ...|$|R
5000|$|Oh, <b>I</b> don’t <b>think</b> so. <b>If</b> <b>it</b> {{is right}} that the astrologers saw in fact two conjunctions of Venus and Jupiter, one in 3 BC and one in 2 BC, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> perhaps it would make us feel {{that there was a}} little bit more reason for what is stated in the scriptures than we might {{otherwise}} think.

5000|$|Fabian {{was one of}} the few {{to benefit}} from the program, which have a new respect for his acting. [...] "This whole town looks at me {{differently}} now - I can feel it," [...] he said.

40|$|I {{wanted to}} explore the process of using place - specifically, small towns in California that I visited - as {{inspiration}} for the writing of a book of poetry. This {{has been done in}} the past, most notably by poets such as Kenneth Rexroth and Gary Snyder. I was inspired by these poets and several others and my own experience in these often overlooked small towns to create a collection of syllabic blank verse poems that touch on their economies, practical reasons for isolation, and unique micro-cultures. While on the whole, I am pleased with the way the collection turned out, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>if</b> <b>it</b> were to be formally published, readers would benefit from seeing photographs I took during my trips in order to fully appreciate the content...|$|R
