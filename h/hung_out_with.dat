25|$|Born in Indianapolis, Gordon {{began playing}} sports at the JCC at four, playing soccer, {{and then moved}} quickly on to basketball. He also played {{football}} but his true love was basketball. At the age of 7 he began playing competitive basketball at the historical Municipal Gardens. He {{spent much of his}} time across the street from his home at the Jewish Community Center of Indianapolis, where he played basketball, swam and <b>hung</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> friends. It was at the JCC that Gordon announced his departure from college to enter his name into the NBA Draft.|$|E
25|$|During his {{frequent}} trips to Pakistan, Gilani <b>hung</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> heroin users and started using the drug himself. He {{became involved in}} Pakistani drug trafficking. When he was twenty-four, Gilani smuggled half a kilogram of heroin out of Pakistani tribal areas and used Tahawwur Hussain Rana, a Pakistani army doctor who Gilani knew from military school, as an unwitting shield. Several days later, police in Lahore arrested Gilani for drug possession, but he somehow managed to beat the charges. Rana continued {{to be used by}} Gilani {{over the course of his}} career as a drug trafficker; in the late 1990s, after Rana had emigrated to the U.S., Gilani used Rana's legitimate immigration consulting company in Chicago to smuggle drugs.|$|E

50|$|Before Mumford & Sons became established, Marshall ran a jam {{night at}} Bosun's Locker, a tiny music club beneath a pasty {{shop on the}} King's Road in Fulham, where a number of musicians who had an {{affinity}} for earthy acoustic music <b>hung</b> <b>out</b> and played <b>with</b> each other in fluid lineups.|$|R

25|$|On Friday, April 12, Martin {{drove to}} Texarkana, from Kilgore. That night, he stayed with his friend, Tom Albritton, at Martin's Texarkana {{residence}} at 1222 Locust (now 1224). The {{next day he}} <b>hung</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> Booker at her house during the afternoon.

He was buried two days later at his church, Beech Street Baptist, on April 16, at 10 a.m. during heavy rainfall. His mother stated that she had objected to his trip to Texarkana, not due to danger in the town, but because she feared he might wreck his car while driving alone.|$|E
25|$|In 1968 Baldessin {{opened an}} art {{studio in the}} Winfield building, Melbourne; {{over the next few}} years, the place evolved into a vibrant atelier and meeting place for young artists and students. In 1970 he was awarded the Geelong Print Prize, and in 1971 he won the Comalco Invitation Award for Sculpture for having invented silver {{aluminium}} foil print. Some of the other awards he received include the Maitland Print Prize (1967 and 1970), the Shepparton Print Prize (1970, shared with Jan Senbergs), and a Drawing Prize at the Second International Biennale for Drawing in Yugoslavia (1970). In 1974, following his retrospective exhibit at the Mornington Peninsula Arts Centre, the National Gallery of Australia acquired 279 of Baldessin's etching plates and prints: this set was the first nucleus of the National Gallery's collection of his works. Together with Imants Tillers, Baldessin represented Australia at the XIII São Paulo Art Biennial in 1975, exhibiting the set of etchings Occasional Images from a City Chamber, and the sculptural work Occasional Screens with Seating Arrangement. From 1975 to 1977 Baldessin lived in Paris; during his French sojourn he attended the Lacourière-Frélaut engraving workshop and <b>hung</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> Imants Tillers, soon becoming close friends with him.|$|E
500|$|Paley {{later said}} of the cover shoot, [...] "I never liked a band more. I was one of them. It was like being a rock star. I <b>hung</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> a lot of rock stars {{but no one ever}} did that to the same extent. There was just an ease to the whole thing. They really were the kindest, most fun band I ever worked with." ...|$|E

She responded badly to formal education, preferring a freethinking outlook, and was drawn to art, a pursuit often regarded as peripheral at the time. One unconventional teacher did manage to make an impact on her, stimulating her to write poetry, and her first album includes a dedication to him. In twelfth grade, she flunked out (though she later picked up her studies) and <b>hung</b> <b>out</b> downtown <b>with</b> a rowdy set until deciding that she was getting too close to the criminal world.|$|R
50|$|Jon was {{particularly}} unsuccessful with women, suffered from amazingly low self-esteem {{and had little}} in the way of spine, job or coolness. He had a huge crush on a somewhat sadistic bartender at the Peculier known as Lori. Phillip was tall, Swedish and drunk.

50|$|In {{the summer}} of 1973, Gram Parsons' Topanga Canyon home burned to the ground, {{the result of a}} stray cigarette. Nearly all of his {{possessions}} were destroyed with the fire. Following the incident, Parsons left his wife and moved into a spare room in Phil Kaufman's house. While not recording, he frequently <b>hung</b> <b>out</b> and jammed <b>with</b> country rockers Quacky Duck and His Barnyard Friends. At the time, Parsons took the role of producer and recorded new songs with his road band.|$|R
500|$|In 1982 Vainio {{collaborated with}} {{bodybuilder}} Kike Elomaa [...] when they sang {{together on the}} single Kunto nousee sullakin ("You'll Get in Shape Too"), with lyrics by Vainio. The B-side of the single was Pokkana ja paikallaan ("Serious and Still"), sung by Elomaa alone. A compilation album called Sellaista elämä on ("That's How Life Is") followed in 1983, consisting {{of the most popular}} songs Vainio had himself recorded. 1985's Elämää ja erotiikkaa ("Life and Erotica") was Vainio's last finished studio album. Popular pieces from the album included Aleks ja Jaan ("Aleks and Jaan"), Heiskasen kanssa kun heiluttiin ("When We <b>Hung</b> <b>Out</b> <b>with</b> Heiskanen") and Yksinäinen saarnipuu ("Lonely Ash Tree").|$|E
500|$|Usher {{wanted to}} work with Swedish {{electronic}} dance music trio Swedish House Mafia since their joint performance at the American Music Awards in 2011. The group later agreed to work with the singer, where they intended to travel to Atlanta to work on track production, writing, and to [...] "move the ball forward." [...] Steve Angello, a member of Swedish House Mafia, told MTV News that the group <b>hung</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> Usher in Ibiza after the awards ceremony; they worked with him in Atlanta for five days. They produced the final tracks [...] "Numb", [...] "Euphoria" [...] and [...] "Way to Count", with the latter not making the final cut.|$|E
500|$|M. Shadows of Avenged Sevenfold {{states that}} Iron Maiden [...] "are {{by far the}} best live band in the world and their music is timeless", while Trivium singer Matt Heafy {{comments}} that [...] "without Iron Maiden, Trivium surely wouldn't exist". Slipknot frontman Corey Taylor says that [...] "Steve Harris does more with four fingers than I've ever seen anybody do. And Bruce Dickinson? Dude! To me, he was the quintessential old-school heavy metal singer. He could hit notes that were just sick, and he was a great showman. Everything made me a fan. And there wasn't a dude that I <b>hung</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> that wasn't trying to draw Eddie on their schoolbooks", while their music also helped Jesper Strömblad of In Flames to pioneer the melodic death metal genre, stating that he had wanted to combine death metal with Iron Maiden's melodic guitar sounds.|$|E
50|$|After graduating college, Lauderdale {{lived in}} Nashville {{for five months}} {{in the summer of}} 1979 while he tried to get a {{recording}} or publishing deal. He <b>hung</b> <b>out</b> a lot <b>with</b> Roland White, an accomplished mandolin player, with whom he cut a record. But things never took off, so he decided to move to New York, where he played in Floyd Domino's band and performed as a solo artist. In 1980 he met singer-songwriter Buddy Miller. He played in Miller's band in the active twang music scene that was evolving at the time.|$|R
50|$|In {{the summer}} of 1973, Parsons' Topanga Canyon home burned to the ground, {{the result of a}} stray cigarette. Nearly all of his {{possessions}} were destroyed {{with the exception of a}} guitar and a prized Jaguar automobile.

25|$|At age nine, Mitchell {{contracted}} polio in an epidemic, and was hospitalised for weeks. No longer athletic, {{she turned}} her thoughts to her creative talent, and considered a singing or dancing career for the first time. By nine, she was a smoker; she denies claims that smoking has affected her voice. At 11, she moved with her family {{to the city of}} Saskatoon, which she considers her hometown. She responded badly to formal education, preferring a freethinking outlook, and was drawn to art, a pursuit often regarded as peripheral at the time. One unconventional teacher did manage to make an impact on her, stimulating her to write poetry, and her first album includes a dedication to him.

500|$|A Day to Remember {{formed when}} guitarist Tom Denney asked Jeremy McKinnon {{if he would}} like to join the band as a vocalist. The pair <b>hung</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> drummer Bobby Scruggs, who later joined the band. During this period, both Denney and Scruggs were already in a band; Denney was in 2 Days 2 Late, while McKinnon played in All for Nothing. The trio wrote a song which McKinnon said [...] "was better than {{everything}} our other bands had come up with". Shortly afterwards the trio decided to form a band which was called End of An Era in its first week of existence. The name was inspired by a movie listing in a TV guide found in Denney's home. One day at rehearsal, a friend of Scruggs showed up with his girlfriend, {{who came up with the}} band's name A Day to Remember.|$|E
500|$|Rado {{described}} {{the inspiration for}} Hair as [...] "a combination of some characters we met in the streets, people we knew and our own imaginations. [...] We knew this group of kids in the East Village who were dropping out and dodging the draft, and there were also lots of articles in the press about how kids were being kicked {{out of school for}} growing their hair long". [...] He recalled, [...] "There was so much excitement in the streets and the parks and the hippie areas, and we thought if we could transmit this excitement to the stage it would be wonderful.... We <b>hung</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> them and went to their Be-Ins [...] let our hair grow." [...] Many cast members (Shelley Plimpton in particular) were recruited right off the street. [...] Rado said, [...] "It was very important historically, and if we hadn't written it, there'd not be any examples. [...] You could read about it and see film clips, but you'd never experience it. [...] We thought, 'This is happening in the streets,' and we wanted to bring it to the stage." ...|$|E
500|$|Lundgren {{was awarded}} a Fulbright Scholarship to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1983. However, while {{preparing}} for the move to Boston, he was spotted in the nightclub he worked at in Sydney and was hired by Grace Jones as a bodyguard, and the two became lovers. Their relationship developed dramatically, and he moved with her to New York City. While living with Jones in her New York City apartment, Lundgren dabbled in modeling at the Zoli Agency but was described as [...] "a bit too tall and muscular for a model's size 40". He earned {{a living as a}} bouncer at the Manhattan nightclub The Limelight; housed in the former Episcopal Church of the Holy Communion, working with Chazz Palminteri. In the daytime, he studied drama at the Warren Robertson Theatre Workshop and has said that [...] "my time in New York City opened up my adolescent Swedish eyes to a multitude of different people and lifestyles, mostly in the arts. I <b>hung</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> Andy Warhol, Keith Haring, Iman and Steve Rubell, danced at Studio 54, and studied acting with Andie MacDowell and Tom Hulce." [...] Friends told him he should be in movies. He would later quit studying at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology after two weeks to pursue acting.|$|E
6000|$|All {{eyes now}} {{centered}} on Dorn and Glidden. Lenore, seeing clearly {{for the first}} time, suffered a strange, hot paroxysm of emotion never before experienced by her. It left her weak. It seemed to stultify the cry that {{had been trying to}} escape her. She wanted to scream that Dorn must not kill the man. Yet there was a ferocity in her that froze the cry. Glidden's coat and blouse were half torn off; blood covered him; he strained and flung himself weakly in that iron clutch. He was beaten and bent back. His tongue <b>hung</b> <b>out,</b> bloody, fluttering <b>with</b> strangled cries. A ghastly face, appalling in its fear of death! ...|$|R
5|$|The {{memorial}} {{was unveiled}} on Whit Monday, 16 May 1921, by Edward, Prince of Wales (later King Edward VIII), with Lutyens in attendance. At the unveiling ceremony, Lord Fortescue {{gave a speech}} in which he estimated that 11,600 {{men and women from}} Devon had been killed while serving in the war. He later stated that some 63,700 (8,000 regulars, 36,700 volunteers, and 19,000 conscripts) had served in the armed forces. The names of the fallen were recorded on a roll of honour, of which three copies were made: one for Exeter Cathedral, one to be held by the county council, and one which the Prince of Wales placed in a hollow in the base of the war memorial. The prince's visit generated considerable excitement in the area. Thousands of people lined the street to greet his motorcade and shops on the High Street <b>hung</b> <b>out</b> banners <b>with</b> welcoming messages. After the unveiling, Edward spent ten days touring the local area.|$|R
50|$|Young and feasible, Spiro <b>hung</b> <b>out</b> mostly <b>with</b> his peers, {{among whom}} were also those from {{prominent}} families. As Vranje {{had recently been}} liberated, {{as soon as the}} first recruits had entered the cadre, Spiro trained his new friends and comrades handling the modern weapon and the knife; they often went to Ćošak and Balinovce where he trained them on attacks and defense in the guerrilla way, without aspiring them to become his rebel comrades. Target practice was also trained by him at private gardens in the town. For a long time, almost every day, they trained in the garden of Jovan Hadži-Vasiljević's father and uncles; Hadži-Vasiljević, who at that time went in the fourth grade, and his friends followed Spiro to other gardens and listened to his stories. Spiro not only trained people, but told them of events from his home region. The Vranjans received most information about that time's harsh situation in Old Serbia and Macedonia from Spiro. Hadži-Vasiljević's cousins and relatives were in the nearest circle of Crne; his uncle Hadži Toma and cousin Mihajlo were planning to, but did not enter his band.|$|R
500|$|In 2002, Eminem {{mentioned}} the singer twice on The Eminem Show, his fourth studio album, {{on the tracks}} [...] "Superman" [...] and [...] "When the Music Stops", {{both of which were}} revealed to have been inspired by their relationship in Eminem's 2008 autobiography, The Way I Am. The former track contained the lyrics [...] "What you trying be? My new wife? / What, you Mariah? Fly through twice," [...] while the latter suggested that he begged to be taken back by Carey. Later that year, Eminem confirmed that they had been in a relationship in an interview for Rolling Stone, but claimed to have not been fully committed to it and that he disliked her as a person, while Carey told Maxim that it was never a [...] "sexual relationship" [...] and interviewer Larry King [...] "I <b>hung</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> him, I spoke to him on the phone. I think I was probably with him a total of four times. And I don't consider that dating somebody." [...] Carey recorded a song called [...] "Clown" [...] for Charmbracelet which [...] "ambiguously addressed the relationship" [...] with the lyrics [...] "Should've left it at I like your music too" [...] and [...] "You should've never intimated we were lovers/ When you know very well we never even touched each other." ...|$|E
500|$|Favreau {{planned to}} cast a {{newcomer}} in the title role, as [...] "those movies don't require an expensive star; Iron Man's the star, the superhero is the star. The success of X-Men and Spider-Man without being star-driven pieces reassures [...] that the film does have an upside commercially." [...] However, in September 2006, Robert Downey, Jr. was cast in the role. Favreau chose Downey, {{a fan of the}} comic, because he felt the actor's past made him an appropriate choice for the part, explaining [...] "The best and worst moments of Robert's life have been in the public eye. He had to find an inner balance to overcome obstacles that went far beyond his career. That's Tony Stark." [...] Favreau faced opposition from Marvel in casting Downey, but would not take no for an answer, saying, [...] "It was my job as a director to show that it was the best choice creatively ... everybody knew he was talented [...] certainly by studying the Iron Man role and developing that script I realized that the character seemed to line-up with Robert in all the good and bad ways. While preparing for filming, Favreau and Downey were given a tour of SpaceX by Elon Musk. Downey said, [...] "Elon was someone Tony probably <b>hung</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> and partied with, or more likely they went on some weird jungle trek together to drink concoctions with the shamans." ...|$|E
500|$|Jay-Z {{opened his}} set at Glastonbury 2008 {{with a cover}} of Oasis' song [...] "Wonderwall". When Gallagher {{was asked about the}} {{incident}} he replied, [...] "The way it's played itself out is that I said Jay-Z had no right to play Glastonbury, which is a crock of horseshit. I got off a plane and someone asked me about the fact that Glastonbury hadn't sold {{out for the first time}} in years, and if it was because of Jay-Z. From there it grew into this crap that I was standing on an orange crate at Speakers' Corner saying, 'Gather round, brothers and sisters. Have you heard what's happening at Glastonbury this year?' I have a certain turn of phrase. So if I say, [...] "Chicken sandwiches in McDonald's are just plain fucking wrong," [...] it doesn't mean I'm attacking all chickens or all sandwiches. I've <b>hung</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> Jay-Z in Tokyo. I've seen his show. It's not my bag, but it's all right. We have a mutual friend in Chris Martin. So I am a guy who doesn't like hip-hop—shock, horror. I don't dislike rappers or hip-hop or people who like it. I went to the Def Jam tour in Manchester in the '80s when rap was inspirational. Public Enemy were awesome. But it's all about status and bling now, and it doesn't say anything to me." [...] When Jay-Z was asked about Gallagher's comments he said [...] "I haven't spoken to him , I heard he was reaching out. I don't bear any grudge, it's all good. I just believe in good music and bad music, I've always said that. You look at any interview from the beginning of time, I've always stated that I don't believe in the lines and classifications that people put music in so they can easily define it". When asked who he would be interested in collaborating with in the future, the rapper said, [...] "Anyone. Oasis as well – it doesn't matter to me." ...|$|E

After a week of recording drums and bass guitar, Bauermeister and Pfahler were largely absent {{from the rest of}} the sessions while Schwarzenbach continued to work on the album with Cavallo. [...] "I didn't even go", recalled Bauermeister in 2010, [...] "I just <b>hung</b> <b>out</b> at home <b>with</b> my wife.

[...] With a large recording budget at their disposal, Schwarzenbach and Cavallo spent much of their time polishing the record's production value, making the vocals and guitar clear and bringing them to the forefront of the mix. According to Cavallo, [...] "Blake really wanted to be heard. I think he wanted his voice to be heard for the first time. He also decided to sing differently.
