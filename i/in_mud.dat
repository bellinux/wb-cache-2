This Receiving Station {{took over the}} site near Jericho, occupied by the main dressing station during the two Transjordan attacks, which could accommodate 200 patients <b>in</b> <b>mud</b> huts, 400 patients in tents, and 700 patients in the abandoned Desert Mounted Corps headquarters.|$|E

5|$|In this episode, Homer {{decides to}} {{purchase}} an RV and the Simpsons set off for a vacation in the wilderness. After accidentally driving it {{off the edge of}} a cliff, the family find themselves trapped in the woods. As Homer and Bart {{try to find a way}} back to civilization, Homer gets himself covered <b>in</b> <b>mud</b> and is mistaken for Bigfoot by a naturalist. The news about the encounter spreads quickly and Bigfoot hunters converge on the woods to capture Homer. Meanwhile, Maggie finds herself separated from the family and raised by bears.|$|E
5|$|Moving {{troops to}} the front ahead of the attack was {{nonetheless}} extremely difficult, as {{the only means of}} approaching the front line were narrow boardwalks made of wood planking, which wound between the shell-holes. Slipping off the duckboards could often be deadly with unfortunate soldiers frequently drowning <b>in</b> <b>mud</b> under the weight of their own equipment. On account of the exhausting nature of the trip, the leading assault units entered the support line four days before the battle, to ensure soldiers would be as fresh as possible for the attack.|$|E

5|$|The Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission {{operates}} {{the visitor center}} {{as part of the}} nearby Drake Well Museum, adjacent to Oil Creek State Park, outside of Titusville. The visitor center contains several exhibits, including a scale model of the city at its peak, an oil-transport wagon that is stuck <b>in</b> <b>mud,</b> and a small, informational theater. The visitor center is usually open, annually, from the Memorial Day weekend, at end of May, through Labor Day in September. The season is kicked off with the annual Wildcatter Day celebration featuring music, tours, demonstrations and other activities.|$|E
5|$|The {{environment}} of the Shishugou Formation hosted a diverse assemblage of animals. Contemporaries of Limusaurus in the Wucaiwan locality include the theropods Haplocheirus, Zuolong, and Guanlong, the latter of which is, like Limusaurus, frequently found <b>in</b> <b>mud</b> deposits; the sauropod Mamenchisaurus; the ornithischians Gongbusaurus and Yinlong; the tritylodontid Yuanotherium; the mammal Acuodulodon; the crocodyliforms Sunosuchus, Junggarsuchus, and Nominosuchus; and the turtles Xinjiangchelys and Annemys.|$|E
5|$|The known fossil {{material}} of Limusaurus consists of large assemblages of individuals mired <b>in</b> <b>mud</b> pits. These pits range in depth from , and were likely created by soil liquefaction from {{the footsteps of}} sauropods or other large dinosaurs. The size of these assemblages {{can be attributed to}} the tendency of smaller animals to become trapped in the mud (other animals that were trapped by these deposits include individuals of Guanlong, along with small ornithischians, crocodyliforms, turtles, mammals, and tritylodontid cynodonts), and may also hint at the possible gregarious (group-living) tendencies of Limusaurus.|$|E

5|$|Though quite agile on land (capable {{of running}} {{as fast as}} a horse), capybaras are equally at home in the water. They are {{excellent}} swimmers, and can remain completely submerged for up to five minutes, an ability they use to evade predators. Capybaras can sleep in water, keeping only their noses out of the water. As temperatures increase during the day, they wallow in water and then graze during the late afternoon and early evening. They also spend time wallowing <b>in</b> <b>mud.</b> They rest around midnight and then continue to graze before dawn.|$|E
5|$|A United States Geological Survey {{report in}} the 1960s {{measured}} the concentration of bicarbonate <b>in</b> <b>Mud</b> Creek to range from 41 to 109 milligrams per liter, {{but there were no}} carbonates in the water. The creek's nitrate concentration ranged from 3.3 to 6.3 milligrams per liter for filtered water and the concentration of sulfates ranged from 23 to 29 milligrams per liter, again for filtered water. The concentration of chlorides in the creek's filtered waters ranged from 7 to 23 milligrams per liter. The calcium and magnesium concentrations in filtered water were 20 to 44 and 4.4 to 6 milligrams per liter, respectively.|$|E

5|$|Fossilized teeth {{belonging}} to the silky shark {{have been found in}} North Carolina: from the vicinity of two baleen whales, one <b>in</b> <b>mud</b> dating to the Pleistocene-Holocene (circa 12,000 years ago) and the other in Goose Creek Limestone dating to the Late Pliocene (circa 3.5 million years ago – Mya), {{as well as from the}} Pungo River, dating to the Miocene (23–5.3Mya). Fossil teeth have also been found in Pliocene strata at the Cava Serredi quarry in Tuscany, Italy. Carcharhinus elongatus, an earlier representative of its lineage with smooth-edged teeth, is known from Oligocene (34–23Mya) deposits in the Old Church formation of Virginia, and the Ashley formation of South Carolina. A set of poorly described, Eocene (56–34Mya) teeth resembling those of this species are known from Egypt.|$|E
5|$|Gategood {{could not}} get through on the radio because the petrol {{generator}} that supplied power to the radios at Mud Bay had broken down, thereby cutting Arnold's link with Mud Bay, Milne Force and Taleba Bay. Arnold launched an attack on Kilia at 09:10, supported by two 3-inch mortars and 100rounds that had been brought up from Mud Bay. A promised air strike failed to arrive. Instead, Japanese aircraft strafed the Australian positions, {{as well as the}} ketch Maclaren King <b>in</b> <b>Mud</b> Bay with wounded men on board, resulting in further casualties. Arnold attempted a flanking movement with A Company, but it became lost in the jungle. The attack then became a frontal one against the main Japanese defences, which Arnold chose not to press.|$|E

5|$|Guinea pigs {{are used}} in the cuisine of Cuzco, Peru, in dishes such as cuy al horno, baked guinea pig. The {{traditional}} Andean stove, known as a qoncha or a fogón, is made from mud and clay reinforced with straw and hair from animals such as guinea pigs. In Peru, there are at any time 20 million domestic guinea pigs, which annually produce 64 million edible carcasses. This animal is an excellent food source since the flesh is 19% protein. In the United States, mostly squirrels, but also muskrats, porcupines, and ground hogs are eaten by humans. The Navajo people ate prairie dog baked <b>in</b> <b>mud,</b> while the Paiute ate gophers, squirrels, and rats.|$|E

He used another piece of string for a belt, and from it hung a pot for boiling water, a tea strainer, a canteen, and other useful things.
