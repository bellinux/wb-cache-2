25|$|On 23 April 2008, a Royal Air Force Typhoon FGR4 from 17 Squadron at RAF Coningsby, tail number ZJ943, made a wheels–up {{landing at}} the US Navy's NAWS China Lake, in the United States. The {{aircraft}} was severely damaged and {{was returned to}} the UK on 27 October 2008. The pilot from 17 Squadron did not sustain any significant injury. It is thought the pilot may have forgotten to deploy the undercarriage or that <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>reason</b> <b>he</b> was not alerted {{to the fact that}} the undercarriage was not deployed.|$|E
25|$|Further {{competition}} ensued in 1665, {{when both}} companies produced different comedies {{with the same}} title, La Mère coquette: Molière's text was by Donneau de Visé and the Bourgogne's, by Philippe Quinault. Neither play was very successful. Molière staged Jean Racine's Alexandre le grand et Porus at the Palais-Royal in December and the Bourgogne responded with {{a revival of the}} abbé Claude Boyer's Porus, ou la générosité d'Alexandre. Although Racine's was clearly the better play and was doing well, <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>reason</b> <b>he</b> decided to approve a performance at the Bourgogne by the Comédiens du Roi. This caused a serious rift between Racine and Molière, and all of Racine's subsequent plays were premiered by the Comédiens du Roi. The last of the duels between the two companies came in 1670, when the Bourgogne produced Racine's Bérénice on 21 November and Molière, at the Palais-Royal, Pierre Corneille's Tite et Bérénice on 28 November. Both plays were initially very successful, although Racine's has been the more popular with time.|$|E
500|$|Leng views [...] "Who Can See It" [...] as a [...] "new type of ballad" [...] from Harrison, {{one that}} {{combines}} a [...] "dramatic edge" [...] with rhythmic sophistication. The time signature shifts throughout the composition, from 4/4 to 6/4 and 5/8, with brief portions in 5/4 and 3/4. In Leng's description, the melody features [...] "sweepingly large chromatic intervals", {{beginning with the}} verse's third line – a four-semitone swoop that recalls the ascending melismas commonly used in Indian music. Harrison later remarked, {{with reference to the}} boldness of the tune: [...] " [...] reminds me of Roy Orbison <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>reason.</b> <b>He</b> could do this good." ...|$|E

God's name is not mentioned, but it presents. It is given overtones. Tanirbergen often directs {{his gaze to the}} sky.

5000|$|Suh-Rin [...] "Fabian" [...] Kim: Freshman {{in middle}} school, [...] "Matthew" [...] Class. He's {{the younger brother}} of Seung-Hae, and he's two years younger than most middle school students, being a child prodigy. This makes him more {{immature}} than most other students at Saint Marie. <b>For</b> <b>some</b> <b>reason,</b> <b>he's</b> in love with Shi-Young. Liking old-fashioned clothes, he almost always has a hat to compliment his outfit. He extremely dislikes glamorous girls (like Hyun-Jin). His hobby is assembling plastic models and his talent is fixing electronics. He has great fighting skills, and his after school club is the Geology club. White chess piece.|$|R
500|$|Moondance was {{recorded}} from August to September 1969 at the Studio A penthouse of A & R Studios in New York City. It {{was the first}} album for which Morrison was credited as the producer; he later said [...] "no one knew what I was looking for except me, so I just did it." [...] Around this time, the singer made it known to Warner Bros. {{that he would be}} lead production duties for all his future recordings, which forced producers recruited by the label into assisting roles. It also led to frequent enlisting and dismissal of musicians to meet Morrison's creative vision. Lewis Merenstein—Moondances executive producer—had brought in Astral Weeks session musicians Richard Davis, Jay Berliner, and Warren Smith, Jr. for the first recording session at A & R Studios, but Morrison—according to Platania—"sort of manipulated the situation" [...] and [...] "got rid of them all. <b>For</b> <b>some</b> <b>reason</b> <b>he</b> didn't want those musicians." [...] While not an overbearing presence among the record's personnel, the singer later conceded to creating an atmosphere of artistic autonomy during the sessions: [...] "When I go into the studio, I'm a magician. I make things happen. Whatever is working in that particular space at that particular time, I use, I take advantage of." ...|$|E
500|$|Frazier {{made his}} sophomore debut on November 7, 2010, in an {{exhibition}} game against East Stroudsburg. He added 10 points, 6 assists, and two steals. Frazier also recorded a team-high 4 turnovers. DeChellis commented, [...] "Offensively we were poor tonight and we had too many turnovers... something we've struggled with in practice." [...] On November 12, 2010, Frazier made his second appearance as a sophomore with 6 points, 7 rebounds, 6 assists, and 1 steal. He shot 1-of-5 on field goals, while going a perfect 4-of-4 from the free-throw line. Frazier was named the game's starting shooting guard and was allowed 30 minutes of playing time. He made his first-ever appearance as Penn State's starting point guard on November 19 vs. Fairfield, and contributed 3 points, 4 rebounds, 7 assists, and 1 steal. The team's coach commented on Frazier's powerful defensive performance, [...] "thought Tim Frazier did a very nice job defensively on the point guard for Fairfield who {{is a really good}} player. He bothered him all night." [...] Frazier made his first impression above the 10-points barrier on January 15, 2011 vs. Ohio State, with 11 points, 6 rebounds, and 5 assists. He shot 4-of-4 from the field and made three of four free throws. On March 12, 2011, Frazier scored 22 points against Michigan State, his season-high as a sophomore, helping the team pull off the upset victory in the semifinals of the 2011 Big Ten Conference Men's Basketball Tournament. He played in his first NCAA Tournament game against Temple, contributing 15 points, 7 assists, 5 rebounds, and 2 steals. He made a late miscue guarding Juan Fernández, allowing the opposing guard to close out the game with under one second remaining in regulation. Frazier recalled the moment, [...] "I closed out high end so he wouldn't be able to shoot over me. (He) made a great move, pivoted {{a couple of times and}} then stepped through." [...] Fernández said, [...] "I was thinking about shooting a jump shot but I killed my dribble and (Tim) Frazier was right there. <b>For</b> <b>some</b> <b>reason</b> <b>he</b> jumped over to my right and that gave me the space to go left." [...] By the end of the season, Frazier averaged 6.3 points, 5.1 assists, 3.9 rebounds, 1.0 steals, and 0.1 blocks per game. He was named to the Academic All-Big Ten following 2010–11.|$|E

At the fall of the ninth wicket Ramdin was joined by Tino Best and the pair built a 143-run partnership, the highest stand for the tenth wicket by the West Indies and the third highest in Test history. On reaching his century, Ramdin produced a piece of paper from his pocket on which he had written a message for Richards the night before. The message read [...] "Yeah Viv Talk Nah". The ICC fined Ramdin 20% of his match fee for [...] "conduct contrary to the spirit of the game".|$|E
2500|$|Alcibiades, {{needing to}} force a battle with Lysander, brought his fleet to Notium, where he could closely watch the Spartan fleet across the water. Merely sitting at Notium, however, failed to bring Lysander out to fight. Accordingly, Alcibiades sailed north with a few troopships to assist Thrasybulus in the siege of Phocaea. The bulk of the fleet, which {{remained}} behind him, was placed {{under the command of}} Alcibiades' kybernetes, or helmsman. A fleet of this size (80 ships remained at Notium after Alcibiades' departure) would traditionally have been commanded by several generals, or at the least by a trierarch; Alcibiades' unconventional decision has been widely criticized by both ancient and modern authors. Antiochus was given one simple order to govern his actions; [...] "Do not attack Lysander's ships." [...] <b>For</b> <b>some</b> <b>reason,</b> <b>he</b> chose not to obey this order, and attempted to implement a stratagem that he thought would give the Athenians a victory.|$|E
