40|$|Abstract]: Little {{is known}} about <b>final</b> <b>account</b> disputes. In this {{exposure}} study, 20 cases {{out of a total}} of 57 have been studied in order to seek a first time understanding of the nature of <b>final</b> <b>account</b> payments, causes that hinder settlement, and to unearth possible improvement strategies. It is found that the number of court cases on <b>final</b> <b>accounts</b> have increased significantly since the introduction of the Construction Contracts Act (CCA) in 2003. These cases have been mainly with private clients with most judgements in favour of contractors and subcontractors. Whilst the monetary values of most disputes are not exceedingly high, the time delays are, suggesting the need to examine alternative dispute resolution methods currently not available through standard form contracts such as conciliation. Workmanship issues and cross claims feature more frequently as the main reasons for disputes. Issues connected with a lack of understanding of CCA also featured prominently. In an attempt to understand the root causes, initial investigations revealed the presence of generic causes such as ‘contractual incompetence’ and ‘opportunistic behaviour’ which seems to substantially hinder the resolution of these disputes not least ‘technical incompetence’ and ‘managerial incompetence’. It is expected that understanding the relevance of such generic categories coupled with broad trends on court decisions including reasons hindering early settlement would help ease problems connected with <b>final</b> <b>accounts.</b> Industry initiatives through client and contractors’ federations may be useful too. Further studies are necessary to gain a greater understanding of the issues impacting on <b>final</b> <b>accounts</b> in order to minimise the incidence of <b>final</b> <b>account</b> problems in courts. ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose– The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{identify}} and then evaluate perceived risk factors influencing variability between contract sum and final count, and to develop a fuzzy risk assessment model for evaluating the overall impact of established critical risk factors impacting on variability between contract sum and <b>final</b> <b>account</b> in government-funded construction projects. Construction projects are characterised by risk factors that significantly impact on variability between the contract sum and <b>final</b> <b>account.</b> Design/methodology/approach– A research approach integrating questionnaire survey, mean scoring ranking and principal component factor analysis (PCFA) methods was adopted to evaluate and classify the critical risk factors. A fuzzy synthetic evaluation method was sequentially applied to compute the overall risk impact (ORI) of eight critical risk factors’ impact on variability between contract sum and <b>final</b> <b>account.</b> Findings– Initial results showed that eight critical risk factors have high impact on variations between contract sum and <b>final</b> <b>account,</b> namely (in order) : project funding problems, underestimation of quantities, variations by client, change in scope of works, inadequate specification, change in design by client, defects in design and unexpected site (ground) conditions. PCFA produced two factor solutions: “professional-related factors” and “client factors”. The fuzzy model further showed that the ORI is 5. 48, indicating that these risk factors have a high impact on variability between contract sum and <b>final</b> <b>account</b> in public construction projects. The client factors have a very high impact (5. 59), while the professional-related factors indicated a high impact (5. 41) on project cost variability. Originality/value– A practical model is proposed to evaluate the key risks associated with cost overruns in public projects. By giving effective and sustained attention to these factors, variability between contract sum and <b>final</b> <b>account,</b> a common situation in Ghana, can be controlled to achieve cost savings in public infrastructure projects.
