5|$|<b>Fighting</b> <b>has</b> {{been a part}} of {{ice hockey}} since the sport's rise in {{popularity}} in 19th century Canada. There are a number of theories behind the integration of fighting into the game; the most common is that the relative lack of rules in the early history of hockey encouraged physical intimidation and control. Other theories include the poverty and high crime rates of local Canada in the 19th century. The implementation of some features, such as the blue lines in 1918, actually encouraged fighting due to the increased level of physical play. Creation of the blue lines allowed forward passing, but only in the neutral zone. Therefore, puck handlers played at close quarters and were subject to a great deal of physical play. The emergence of enforcers, who protected the puck handlers and fought when necessary, followed shortly thereafter.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the battle, the fighting around Isurava has come to form {{a key part of}} the Australian narrative of the campaign. The Japanese were victorious in capturing Isurava, but Australian accounts in the early years after the war characterised the battle as a successful delaying action by a heavily outnumbered force that inflicted more casualties than it sustained, highlighting the bravery of Australian troops in an epic and desperate action of national survival. In this regard, the Battle of Isurava has come to form {{a key part of the}} Anzac legend, although recent accounts have re-examined the battle. As the size of the Japanese force committed to the <b>fighting</b> <b>has</b> been re-evaluated, the magnitude of the Australian defensive feat has also been reinterpreted. Recent analysis, while acknowledging the individual bravery of both Australian and Japanese soldiers, highlights tactical deficiencies on both sides, and now characterises the battle as one in which Australian forces were able to withdraw largely due to tactical errors from the Japanese commanders.|$|E

25|$|Krabi Krabong or Combat with Short and Long Sticks {{and with}} Swords These dances are {{inspired}} by types of combat that were typical of Thailand, in which either sticks or swords are used. The skillful use of the short stick depends on the agility of the fighter, who must attack and always remain close to his opponent, while the combatant who takes up the long stick must maintain a critical distance from his rival to use his weapon effectively. The art of sword <b>fighting</b> <b>has</b> been practiced in Thailand {{since the beginning of}} time, and, traditionally, a ceremonial dance is performed prior to combat.|$|E

Large-scale <b>fighting</b> <b>has</b> been replaced by guerrilla warfare and bombings targeting federal troops and forces of the regional government, with the violence often spilling over into adjacent regions. Since 2005, the insurgency has largely shifted out of Chechnya proper and into the nearby Russian territories, such as Ingushetia and Dagestan; the Russian government, for its part, has focused on the stabilization of the North Caucasus.|$|E

25|$|In early 2003 a new {{rebellion}} of Sudan Liberation Movement/Army (SLM/A) and Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) {{groups in}} the western region of Darfur began. The rebels accused the central government of neglecting the Darfur region, although there is uncertainty regarding {{the objectives of the}} rebels and whether they merely seek an improved position for Darfur within Sudan or outright secession. Both the government and the rebels have been accused of atrocities in this war, although most of the blame has fallen on Arab militias (Janjaweed) allied with the government. The rebels have alleged that these militias have been engaging in ethnic cleansing in Darfur, and the <b>fighting</b> <b>has</b> displaced hundreds of thousands of people, many of them seeking refuge in neighboring Chad. There are various estimates on the number of human casualties, ranging from under twenty thousand to several hundred thousand dead, from either direct combat or starvation and disease inflicted by the conflict.|$|E
