The study attempts to identify the uses and importance of some NWFPs and to highlight constraints and measures of risks confronting investment in some NWFPs. Two types of data were used to collect the necessary information, namely, primary and secondary data. The primary data collected through interviewing with local people; and group discussion with Forests National Corporation (FNC) staff in the study area. The main findings of the research are; {{the majority of the}} respondents (70 %) rely on agriculture as the main source of income besides collection of NWFPS. <b>Handicraft</b> <b>activity</b> based on NWFPs represents the second important activity for income generation. Some respondents (4. 7 %) rely solely on NWFPs for income generation.

There are some other NWFPs with limited uses. In the study area NWFPs are collected either for household consumption or for marketing (income generation). For household consumption, NWFPs are collected from distances varying between 1 – 2. 5 km, while for trading collectors may cross devastating areas for the sake of collecting considerable amount of NWFPs. Hand picking, tree climbing, sticks and stretched mats are used in the process of NWFPs collection. In the study area NWFPs do not contribute significantly to the budget of the (FNC). There are different channels through which the local people dispose their collected NWFPs. NWFPs are liable to damage by birds and insects, therefore their prices are determined by these iv factors. The FNC has not exerted any effort to inventor the resource or to assess the natural regeneration of the NWFPs producing trees. The main conclusions drawn from this study are; It seems that all the family members are indulging with NWFPS directly or indirectly, but still women remain the main collector of the NWFPS as asserted by 73. 1 % of the respondents indicating that NWFPS is a women profession in the study area. The collection of NWFPS last for five months (September to January) in the study area. The time calendar of collection of NWFPS differs from one product to another. The period between Octobers - December, showed high collection of Tabaldi, Heglig and Sidir fruits. Local people in the study area have limited channels for the disposal of their collected NWFPS. The study recommended some recommendations; The FNC should attempt to give special consideration for the NWFPs producing trees in terms of their regeneration, protection and inventory Extension services provided by the FNC should guarantee the sustainability of the resource for the coming generations...|$|E

The material presented here comes from authentic statements made to the author by many Zlarinlans during her visit to the island and from her own observations. The chapter on housing discusses the prevailing building practices and describes typical forms of family housing. In addition to the architectural characteristics, the interior arrangement and furnishing are also described in considerable detail. The description includes not only the living quarters and domestic farm buildings, but also other farm buildings and structures in the village and outside. The characteristics of the two villages, Borovica and Zlarin, are dealt with {{only to the extent that}} they throw light on the patterns of life of the farmers. The dominant agricultural branches in Zlarin were olive and wine growing. Oil and wine were produced not only for the farmers 2 ̆ 7 own needs but also for the market. Vegetables from family gardens and home-grown frnits were the staple food, while wheat and barley were grown only in small quantities. Livestock breeding was mainly confined to sheep raising. For each of these activities, the annual sequence of jobs is described, together with the tools and processing utensils. The first part of the chapter on eating patterns lists the main foodstuffs and describes how meals were prepared. The foodstuffs included cereals and their products, vegetables, fruits, wild-growing edible plants, fish, meat and related products, milk and dairy products, and eggs. The second part describes the meals eaten on weekdays (with seasonal variations), then on Sundays, on the occasion of important work in the field, In connection with folk customs and village feasts, on special occasions in life, and at the time of food shortage and famine. The chapter on <b>handicraft</b> <b>activities</b> deals only with those whose traces can still be followed. The most important such activity was the making of textile articles from domestically grown and processed wool.

The term Sloyd means skilful or handy and refers to the making of crafts (Chessin, 2007). Historically however, Sloyd also refers to discussions amongst educationalist at the end of 19 th century about the value of craft for general education (Borg, 2008). The aim of Sloyd was to use handicraft as a platform in general education to build the character of the child, encouraging moral behaviour, greater intelligence and industriousness (Thorarinsson, 1891). Otto Salomon in Sweden and Aksel Mikkelsen in Denmark were the major leaders in the development of a systematic Sloyd education. Their models for Sloyd underlined the pedagogical value of <b>handicraft</b> <b>activities</b> as a part of compulsory education (Kantola, et al., 1999). However, there were differences between Salomon’s and Mikkelsen’s models of Sloyd. The Swedish system was based on individual learning, but the Danish system was centred on class instruction. Later, the two Sloyd models were disseminated and used by many teachers from all over the world. Most of these attended Salomon’s courses in Naas, but some went to Mikkelsen’s courses in Copenhagen.

The use of fire as a {{management}} tool and {{the harvest of}} plant parts, known as non-timber forest products, are traditional human activities that impact plant individuals, populations, plant communities and ecosystems. This dissertation focuses on the ecological consequences of harvest and management of goldengrass (Syngonanthus nitens, Eriocaulaceae). Golden-grass flower stalks are harvested to produce handicrafts which represent the most important source of income to hundreds of families in the Cerrado, in central Brazil. I applied an ethnoecological framework to: (i) characterize the local ecological knowledge related to golden-grass harvest and management in Jalapão region, Tocantins state, {{as well as in}} regions in Tocantins state to which the <b>handicraft</b> <b>activities</b> have expanded recently; (ii) experimentally test the effects of 'late' harvest, i. e., according to the traditional management practices, and 'early' harvest on goldengrass long-term population growth rates; (iii) experimentally test the effects of fire frequency and fire season on golden-grass populations, since fire is commonly applied in golden-grass management; and (iv) characterize fire behavior and intensity in the wet grasslands where golden-grass occurs. Ecological knowledge, specifically in relation to the timing of harvest is a determining factor for sustainability: harvesting 'late' has no negative effect on golden-grass populations, whereas 'early' harvest leads to accentuated population declines. As stated by experienced harvesters, golden-grass flower production is stimulated one year after fire. Biennial fire regimes, as preferred by experienced harvesters, yields higher long-term population growth rates (λ) compared to more frequent and sparser fire return intervals. Golden-grass populations were highly affected by variations in rainfall. Survival rates were significantly lower during dry years compared to rainy years, and this caused λ to decline significantly during dry years. Fires in wet grasslands are less intense and achieve relatively mild temperatures compared to fires in dry physiognomies, both within the Cerrado and in other tropical savannas. This dissertation has direct application to the management of golden-grass and fire in the Cerrado and also contributes to the NTFP and fire literature. Golden-grass harvesting has high potential for supporting conservation of biodiversity and local livelihoods.

Verificouse que as atividades desenvolvidas no âmbito acadêmico contribuíram para construção gradual da prática inter e/ou transdisciplinar, na medida em que as ações do Projeto necessitaram reunir diferentes áreas do saber para resolver dificuldades técnicas encontradas para a consolidação da atividade. Observou-se ainda que há graus de comprometimento variados, entre os diferentes profissionais, de campos disciplinares distintos. Contudo, a abertura por parte do corpo discente vem sendo um veículo importante para a interlocução de saberes, que tem estimulado o exercício da prática inter e/ou transdisciplinar. Constatou-se que a Universidade, enquanto produtora e disseminadora de conhecimentos requer mudanças, no sentido de promover a aproximação dos campos disciplinares, tendo em vista a construção de um conhecimento integrado. Já no âmbito comunitário foi possível constatar que, as ações do Projeto contribuíram para aproximar os saberes técnico-científicos das experiências e das práticas do Grupo de Artesanato, visando a resolução de problemas de ordem técnica, de comercialização e de gestão que inviabilizam a consolidação da atividade artesanal naquela comunidade. Conclui-se, portanto, que a interlocução entre diferentes campos do conhecimento, bem como o diálogo entre o conhecimento científico e outros saberes pode contribuir para o debate epistemológico e, por conseguinte para construção de um conhecimento integrador. The aim of {{this research}} work was to register the dialogues between the different knowledge fields, which served to direct {{the actions of the}} research and extension project, Technical, Economic, Social and Environmental evaluation of the <b>Handicraft</b> <b>activities</b> inside the Ivaporunduva Quilombo, Vale do Ribeira (SP), as well as to signed the possible contributions of this project to close the dialogue between scientific knowledge and knowledge came from the experience {{of the members of the}} Ivaporunduva community, located in El Dorado, Vale do Ribeira, São Paulo State, Brazil. The documents elaborated by the project were analyzed; as well as were made interviews with technicians, professors and/or researchers and students involved in the project, and with the members of the Handicraft Group. Besides, observations of the project actions inside the academy and the community were made. This analysis checked out the activities developed in the academic sphere that contributed to the grade construction of an inter-disciplinary and/or trans-disciplinary practice, since the project actions needed to bring together different knowledge areas to solve technical difficulties to allow the consolidation of the activity. Hence, this research work, noticed the varied grades of commitment existing among the different professionals from different subject fields. However, the open attitudes of the university students have been an important vehicle to the knowledges dialogue, what have been stimulating the inter-disciplinary and/or trans-disciplinary practice. There were realized that the university, as producer and spreader of knowledge, needs changes, to promote the approximation between subject fields, having in view the construction of an including knowledge. Inside the communitarian sphere was possible to realize that the project actions contributed to approximate the technical-scientific knowledge and the <b>Handicraft</b> Group <b>activities,</b> looking to solve technical, sale and management problems that produced difficulties to establish the craftwork activity with in the community. Therefore, this conclude that the dialogue between different knowledge fields as well as the dialogue between the scientific knowledge and other kinds of knowledge could contribute to the epistemic debate and, therefore, to the construction of an including knowledge...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{examine the}} effects of {{cognitive}} stimulation (mahjong) and physical exercise (tai chi [TC]) on cognitive performance in persons with dementia. Design: Cluster-randomized open-label controlled design. Setting: Nursing homes. Participants: One hundred ten residents, most of whom were cholinesterase-inhibitor naive. Inclusion criteria were Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) = 10 - 24 and suffering from at least very mild dementia (Clinical Dementia Rating 3 ̆e= 0. 5). Exclusion criteria were being bedbound, audio/visual impairment, regular activity participation before study, or contraindications for physical or group activities. Interventions: Homes were randomized into three conditions (mahjong, TC, and simple <b>handicrafts</b> [control]). <b>Activities</b> were conducted three times weekly for 12 weeks. Measurements: Primary outcome was MMSE. Secondary outcomes were immediate/delayed recall, categorical fluency, and digit span. Various biological risk factors, including apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 allele, were included as covariates. Measures were collected at 0 (baseline), 3 (posttreatment), 6, and 9 months. Results: Intent-to-treat analyses were performed using mixed-effects regression. Mahjong 2 ̆ 7 s effect varied by time for MMSE, delayed recall, and forward digit span. TC had similar effects but not for delayed recall. The typical pattern was that control participants deteriorated while mahjong and TC participants maintained their abilities over time, leading to enlarged treatment effects as time progressed. By 9 months, mahjong and TC differed from control by 4. 5 points (95...|$|R
