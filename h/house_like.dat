25|$|Minor {{characters}} from the second-generation O'Keefe family include Polly's other siblings. From eldest to youngest, these are: Alexander (initially called Sandy, later nicknamed Xan), Dennys (Den), Peggy (presumably short for Margaret), Johnny and Mary (nicknamed Rosy). Of these, only Xan receives significant character {{development in the}} books, becoming a minor antagonist for Polly in A <b>House</b> <b>Like</b> a Lotus.|$|E
25|$|A {{substantial}} stone-built Romanesque <b>house,</b> <b>like</b> the Romanesque castle keep, {{usually had}} the main living {{space on the}} first floor, elevated above an undercroft. This undercroft might take two forms, either an enclosed cellar-like basement, or an open loggia. It might serve for storage, as a stable or for commercial purposes, depending on the location and owners of the house. This arrangement is apparent at the Manor House at Boothby Pagnell, and St Mary's Guild, both in Lincolnshire, England.|$|E
5000|$|The term prodigy house {{ceases to}} be used for houses built after about 1620. Despite some {{features}} of more strictly classical <b>houses</b> <b>like</b> Wilton <b>House</b> (rebuilding begun 1630) continuing those of the prodigy house, the term is not used of them. Much later <b>houses</b> <b>like</b> Houghton Hall and Blenheim Palace show a lingering fondness for elements of the 16th-century prodigy style.|$|R

25|$|Often, when {{depicting}} {{the same subject}} as her sisters, Anne presents it in completely different light. Wildfell Hall, an old superannuated mansion, she pictures not as a ‘haunted’ <b>house</b> <b>like</b> Thornfield Hall or Wuthering Heights in her sisters' works, but as a decayed relic of an outworn patrician class, whose pretensions are mocked by the recrudescence of building into moor. Stevie Davies has argued that Anne’s ancient hall demystifies Gothic. Wildfell Hall is not haunted, it is simply dilapidated, damp and un-welcoming.|$|E
25|$|Polly O'Keefe is {{the protagonist}} of An Acceptable Time, the fifth book in the Time Quintet. The eldest child of Meg and Calvin, she is born shortly after the events of A Swiftly Tilting Planet. Intelligent and widely traveled, Polly speaks {{numerous}} languages. In her first three appearances (The Arm of the Starfish, Dragons in the Waters and A <b>House</b> <b>Like</b> a Lotus), she has not yet settled on a specific career path, but may have found her calling as {{of the end of}} An Acceptable Time.|$|E
25|$|Four further novels {{have been}} {{published}} that feature Meg and Calvin's children, especially Polly O'Keefe. The most recent of these, An Acceptable Time, features Meg's parents, and is marketed with the four Murry books {{as part of the}} Time Quintet; Sandy Murry appears prominently in A <b>House</b> <b>Like</b> a Lotus, which features Polly O'Keefe. Nearly every novel by Madeleine L'Engle connects to the Murry-O'Keefe series either directly or indirectly with appearances by recurring characters.

25|$|The {{difference}} between professional and amateur novelists often is the author's ability to publish. Many people take up novel {{writing as a}} hobby, but the difficulties of completing large scale fictional works of quality prevent the completion of novels. Once authors have completed a novel, they often {{will try to get}} it published. The publishing industry requires novels to have accessible profitable markets, thus many novelists will self-publish to circumvent the editorial control of publishers. Self-publishing has long been an option for writers, with vanity presses printing bound books for a fee paid by the writer. In these settings, unlike the more traditional publishing industry, activities usually reserved for a publishing <b>house,</b> <b>like</b> the distribution and promotion of the book, become the author's responsibility. The rise of the Internet and electronic books has made self publishing far less expensive and a realistic way for authors to realize income.|$|E
25|$|The deed for the {{suppression}} of Sandwell was written by William Burbank and is dated 4 February 1525. It was signed by Prior John Baylye, who was transferred to another Benedictine <b>house,</b> <b>like</b> the other monk. The king conveyed the sites and properties of Sandwell and the other suppressed monasteries to Wolsey on 20 January 1526. On 10 February Wolsey transferred them to John Hygdon, the dean of Cardinal College. A full survey of all the monastic properties was carried out and handed over to Hygdon in June 1527. The founders, or rather their heirs, were listed for each house: Sandwell's were given as Edward Sutton, 2nd Baron Dudley and Thomas Stanley of Stafford. Sandwell Priory and its properties were valued at less than £40 a year – the spiritualities (income from tithes and religious functions) at £12 and the temporalities (rents and dues) at £26 8s. 7d. Higdon set about exploiting the estates more thoroughly: William Brabazon wrote to Cromwell mentioning how Higdon had visited Sandwell as he toured his lands, aiming to raise rents where possible. It seems that Wolsey retained some control of the church at West Bromwich and in 1528 Cromwell {{tried to get the}} curate ejected and replaced by William, the former monk of the priory. For a time the rival priests competed to say Mass in the church and litigation followed.|$|E

25|$|The house/museum {{is located}} in Colonia del Carmen area of the Coyoacán borough of Mexico City. Coyoacán, {{especially}} the Colonia del Carmen area, has had an intellectual and vanguard reputation since the 1920s, when it was the home of Salvador Novo, Octavio Paz, Mario Moreno and Dolores del Río. Today, the area is home {{of a number of}} the borough’s museums. The house itself is located on the corner of Londres and Allende Streets, and it stands out for its cobalt-blue walls, giving it the name La Casa Azul (The Blue <b>House).</b> <b>Like</b> most of the other structures in the area, the house is built around a central courtyard with garden space, a tradition since colonial times. Originally, the house enclosed only three sides of this courtyard, but later the fourth side was added to enclose it entirely. The house covers 800m2 and the central courtyard is another 400m2. As it was built in 1904, it originally had French-style decorative features but later it was changed to the plainer facade seen today. The building has two floors with various bedrooms, studio space, a large kitchen and dining room. The entrance hall was decorated by a mosaic in natural stone by Mardonio Magaña of the Escuela de Pintura al Aire Libre in Coyoacán, inspired by the murals done by Juan O’Gorman at the Ciudad Universitaria.|$|E

500|$|Although [...] "castle" [...] has {{not become}} a generic term for a manor <b>house</b> (<b>like</b> château in French and Schloss in German), many manor houses contain [...] "castle" [...] in their name while having few {{if any of the}} {{architectural}} characteristics, usually as their owners liked to maintain a link to the past and felt the term [...] "castle" [...] was a masculine expression of their power. In scholarship the castle, as defined above, is generally accepted as a coherent concept, originating in Europe and later spreading to parts of the Middle East, where they were introduced by European Crusaders. This coherent group shared a common origin, dealt with a particular mode of warfare, and exchanged influences.|$|E

500|$|Inside the dorm, {{common area}} {{furnishings}} are Jacobean {{in style and}} architectural features include plaster ceilings, windows with tracery, and wood paneling. Within rooms, closets and windows are also notably large and soft light is present throughout the hall. The building was designed to house 130 students split between two double rooms and 126 singles, but now fits up to 202 students, demonymously referred to as [...] "Cushlings". The house presently includes single dorms, one-room doubles, and two-room doubles and triples. Upon opening in 1927 (prior to Vassar's 1969 transition from being an all-female to co-ed college), the dormitory was limited to housing freshmen. It is now co-ed and acts as home to students from all grades including, as of 1999, the highest proportion of upperclassmen of any dorm at the school. Bathrooms are shared by all members of a hall. A minor renovation in summer 1995 and funded by the Estée Lauder Companies included more efficient lighting, rewiring, and new furniture for the <b>house.</b> <b>Like</b> all other Vassar dorms, Cushing houses a game room, a laundry room, and a Steinway grand piano.|$|E
500|$|... "Breathe" [...] {{received}} mostly positive commentary {{from music}} critics. Michael R. Smith from Daily Vault said [...] "Breathe" [...] and [...] "Did It Again" [...] are [...] "most notable for the videos that {{went along with}} them and are fair representations of the album at large (which should be the purpose of singles), though {{there are many more}} undiscovered gems here." [...] Nick Levine from Digital Spy selected the song as the album's best track by writing [...] "Truth be told, this album lacks an absolute classic to match 'Confide in Me', but 'Breathe' – subtle but sneakily catchy with it – could be one of 's most underrated singles." [...] While reviewing Minogue's 2004 compilation, Ultimate Kylie, Jaime Gill from Yahoo! Music gave it a mixed review by writing [...] "Beginning in 1994 with the gorgeously glacial, slinkily synthetic 'Confide In Me', Kylie enjoyed brief success before fans fled in droves from awkward faux-rock like 'Some Kind of Bliss' (not included) and flimsy <b>house</b> <b>like</b> 'Breathe'." [...] Reviewing her 2002 compilation, Hits+, Mackenzie Wilson from AllMusic commended Minogue's [...] "seductive vocals" [...] on [...] "Breathe", [...] "Automatic Love" [...] and [...] "Confide in Me".|$|E
500|$|Champion {{held out}} for several hours, {{wounding}} three of the vigilantes, and {{was said to have}} killed four others. Another settler by the name of Jack Flagg passed by Champion's ranch on his wagon together with his stepson and witnessed the siege. The Invaders recognized Jack Flagg as one of the men on the list and they started shooting at him. Flagg then rode away and as the Invaders gave chase, he grabbed his rifle and beat them back. During the siege, Champion kept a poignant journal which contained a number of notes he wrote to friends while taking cover inside the cabin. [...] "Boys, I feel pretty lonesome just now. I wish there was someone here with me so we could watch all sides at once," [...] he wrote. The last journal entry read: [...] "Well, they have just got through shelling the <b>house</b> <b>like</b> hail. I heard them splitting wood. I guess they are going to fire the house tonight. I think I will make a break when night comes, if alive. Shooting again. It's not night yet. The house is all fired. Goodbye, boys, if I never see you again." ...|$|E

500|$|With Lee's higher rank {{in society}} and wealth, he decided he needed to build a mansion to secure his {{position}} {{as one of the}} Virginia gentry. he chose the [...] "Clifts," [...] which he had owned since the mid-1710s. Lee decided on this site because it was located in Westmoreland County, where he was born, and because it was located on the Potomac River. The land was sufficient for having many construction laborers live there. Hannah had an influential say in the design and planning of the interior of the house. Philip, the couple's eldest son, had said, [...] "See {{what it is to be}} ruled by a woman. I should have been now living in a <b>house</b> <b>like</b> this ... had not my father been persuaded by his wife to put up this very inferior dwelling, now over my head." [...] The exact construction date of the house is unknown but it is estimated that construction began around 1725-30, as all of Lee's sons were born at Stratford. Workers on the plantation were from all the working class: free people and indentured servants mostly from the British Isles, and African slaves.|$|E
500|$|Dragon Quest {{has become}} a {{cultural}} phenomenon in Japan. According to Ryutaro Ichimura and Yuji Horii, Dragon Quest has become popular enough that it {{is used as a}} common topic for conversation in Japan, and is considered by the Japanese gaming industry as Japan's national game. William Cassidy of GameSpy claims that [...] "the common wisdom is that if you ask someone from Japan to draw 'Slime,' he'll draw the onion-like shape of the weak enemies from the game." [...] With the Japanese release of Dragon Quest IX in January 2009, a new eatery inspired by the series called Luida's Bar was opened in Roppongi, a well-known nightlife hotspot in Minato, Tokyo. This was notable due to the usual center of Tokyo's gaming culture being Akihabara rather than Roppongi. The venue provides a meeting location for fans of the series: styled in the fashion of a Medieval public <b>house</b> <b>like</b> its virtual counterpart, its food is directly inspired by both items and monsters found in the games. It was described by a Western journalist as a cross between a Disneyland resort and a maid café Dragon Quest also served as the inspiration for a live-action television drama. Yūsha Yoshihiko initially aired in July 2011, with a sequel series being produced and released the following year. For its 2012 April Fool's Hoax, Google announced a [...] "NES version" [...] of its Google Maps service, which uses graphics and music licensed from Dragon Quest.|$|E
