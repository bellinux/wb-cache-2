60|$|In {{all human}} affairs, {{conflicting}} influences {{are required to}} keep one another alive and efficient even for their own proper uses; and the exclusive pursuit of one good object, apart from some other which should accompany it, ends not in excess of one and defect of the other, but in the decay and loss even of that which has been exclusively cared for. Government by trained officials can not do for a country the things which {{can be done by}} a free government, but it might be supposed capable of doing some things which free government of itself can not do. We find, however, that an outside element of freedom is necessary to enable it to do effectually or permanently even its own business. And so, also, freedom can not produce its best effects, and often breaks down altogether, unless means can be found of combining it with trained and skilled administration. There could not be a moment's hesitation between representative government, among a people in any degree ripe for it, and the most perfect imaginable bureaucracy. But it is, at the same time, {{one of the most important}} ends of political institutions, to attain as many of the qualities of the one as are consistent with the other; to secure, as far as they can be made compatible, the great advantage of the conduct of affairs by skilled persons, bred to it as an <b>intellectual</b> <b>profession,</b> along with that of a general control vested in, and seriously exercised by, bodies representative of the entire people. Much would be done towards this end by recognizing the line of separation, discussed in the preceding chapter, between the work of government properly so called, which can only be well performed after special cultivation, and that of selecting, watching, and, when needful, controlling the governors, which in this case, as in all others, properly devolves, not on those who do the work, but on those for whose benefit it ought to be done. No progress at all can be made towards obtaining a skilled democracy, unless the democracy are willing that the work which requires skill should be done by those who possess it. A democracy has enough to do in providing itself with an amount of mental competency sufficient for its own proper work, that of superintendence and check.|$|E

40|$|Will {{there ever}} {{be an end}} to the plight of the accountants? On 26. 07. 2012, a Law for {{performing}} accounting was introduced in order to bring order in the accounting profession both in terms of professionalism, knowledge, continuing education, and in terms of real valorization of labor and responsibility of the accountants. It was expected that it will put {{an end to the}} chaos that reigned in this particular <b>intellectual</b> <b>profession</b> and the accountants’ efforts would finally be more recognized and valued. The level at which the accounting in Macedonia was degraded, with the entry into force of this law, will finally be raised, and activities of accountants would be immensely valued and evaluated. The institutional framework for the profession provides licenses, several levels of accounting, continuous learning and education, vocational hierarchical scale at which the acquisition of experience can thrive, taking exams for the future purpose of acquiring licenses and many other changes. The legal solution is a compromise, which would allow the existing accountants with inadequate education (nurse, mechanical technician, a high school student, electrical engineer, primary education, etc.) and the oneswho have work experience, to gain certificates in accountingor gain the title ofchartered accountant. What is very important in this Law is the recognition of the Economic Faculty Degree (as for many other professions is also right, pharmacy, technical studies, etc.) with which the title accountant can be obtained, and one can become a certified accountant. One can only become a lawyer by graduating law school, and a graduated pharmacist only by graduating in Pharmacy, as well as an Auditor with a degree from the Economic Faculty, an authorized accountant title can and should be obtained by graduating at the Faculty of Economics. Although only three years have passed since the adoption of this law, there were three amendments that further regulate the basic version of the law. The Institute of Accountants and Chartered Accountants has not functioned as a professional association which needs to advocate the improvement of quality and the dignity of the profession.

40|$|In France as in United States or Canada, women entered {{museums in}} the {{beginning}} of the twentieth century as museum educator, a profession precisely shaped for women by the curators – all male a the time – to prevent the feminisation of their own profession. In France, museum education has since then always been a part-time job for women, working only when museums need them and earning low wage. The family portrait of museum educators has changed along the century, reflecting the transformation of women’s status and rights. The graduates in history of art’s are no longer young “bourgeoises” learning arts and philosophy to stand out in their bride’s social life; modern women wish to have children, but they also want an incentive and fulfilling profession. Another thing has changed: these flexible employment conditions also attract a few men, mainly artists because being museum educators allow them to spare time to create. Whatever their sex, museum educator’s couples are typically “feminine” ones – but if the family income and stability relies on their spouses, today’s breadwinner may be a woman. The profession has nevertheless kept much of its original features, as if this work has always been shaped to fit the social requirements on women’s family life, even scholarly ones. Museum education has indeed never been considered as a real job or a skilled occupation. That’s why this case is so peculiar: once speaking from a labour market point of view, this <b>intellectual</b> <b>profession</b> practiced by scholarly women is a part-time job for temporary workers. Thus, museum educators enable to bring together two sociological fields: the issue of employment on the one hand, focused on flexible and part-time jobs for low skilled educated women; the issue of sex discrimination focused on higher professions and education. The results are part of a survey which combines institutional archives with qualitative and quantitative empirical data. The quantitative side of the survey is a questionnaire addressed by the French ministry of Culture to 1400 public museums, inquiring people and means dedicated to education. The author was in charge of the data analysis for the museum educator’s part in 2004. Besides, biographical interviews with 70 museum educators in 20 museums across France were made by the author between 2002 and 2004. These interviews focused on the path through the current job, and the work itself: employment, salary and career. Consacrée au groupe professionnel des médiateurs dans les musées relevant de la fonction publique territoriale et de la fonction publique d’Etat, cette recherche montre que la question des statuts d’emploi et de la division du travail dans les musées est un élément prépondérant dans la construction d’une identité professionnelle. Si elle s’inscrit dans un contexte défini par les politiques culturelles, la problématique relève de la sociologie des groupes professionnels, et le cadre d’analyse de la sociologie du travail et de l’emploi, avec une attention particulière aux questions de formation, de travail et de trajectoires professionnelles. La démonstration s’appuie sur une centaine d’entretiens accompagnés d’observations, réalisés dans une vingtaine de musées français. Ces matériaux qualitatifs sont confrontés à l’analyse statistique de données issues d’une enquête administrative de la Direction des musées de France du ministère de la Culture et de la communication.

Comparison between the sociodemographic characteristics and motivational factors between lapsed and regular donors is then required. The objectives {{of this analysis}} were: (1) to compare the sociodemographic characteristics of lapsed donors and current donors; (2) to compare the motivations to donate blood expressed by lapsed and current donors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data from a 2008 survey, representative of the population by crossed quotas method, of 1400 individuals questioned by phone were used to reach these objectives. Chi(2) tests and binary logistic regressions were used. RESULTS: Results show that socio-occupational categories and motivational factors are different between lapsed and regular donors. Workers, senior management and higher <b>intellectual</b> <b>professions</b> are more often lapsed than regular donors. Concerning motivations, results show that lapsed donors more frequently mention the first experience with blood donation (with colleagues, friends, and parents) than regular donors, for whom altruistic and community motivations are more frequently cited. CONCLUSION: Workers, senior management and higher <b>intellectual</b> <b>professions</b> should be targeted uppermost, in order to convert them in regular donors. Finally, concerning motivations, the social pressure applied to lapsed donors for their first blood donation appears crucial, whereas regular donors have internalized their motives, more often altruistic and community motivations...|$|R

40|$|Effects {{of early}} {{bilingualism}} on metalinguistic awareness {{have been studied}} mainly during childhood, in most cases showing more elaborated capabilities in bilinguals than in monolinguals. Since this influence seems to affect the very processing of language (Bialystok 2001, 2005), one may wonder if this metalinguistic advantage persists at the adult age, when education provides explicit metalinguistic knowledge in L 1 and other experiences may also promote a reflective attitude toward language.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2011 In {{the wake}} of the {{industrial}} revolution, and in the information age that has followed, the fundamental notion of man as maker has been stifled in favor of convenience and profitability. Just as industrialization gave birth to consumerism, consumerism has marked the death of the tradition of making. Sand boxes and shop classes have been replaced by video games and standardized testing. It was not long ago when products came with part manuals and could be repaired when broken, or when the most popular toys were kits of parts which allowed imagination and creation to be explored and exercised in unison. What has been diminished in this transition is not simply the ubiquitous ability to make and repair, it is the desire and means to deeply engage the world through motive and action. By the compartmentalization and systemic devaluing of process within both manual and <b>intellectual</b> <b>professions,</b> the validation of work has been besieged by the monotony of labor. The objective of this thesis is therefore to identify the inherent values of the maker, and examine how they might be defined and articulated to a contemporary society. Through these observations, the adaptive re-use of the sunken ship parking garage in Pioneer Square into an urban craft and cultural center is proposed. The intent of this center is to enlist the pedagogy of architecture -in addition to its program- as a means to engage culture on the professional, social, and individual levels. It will serve as an outlet for explorations in the tangible, as to illustrate the process of working with all three facets that make us most human: the head, the heart, and the hands...|$|R

40|$|Obstructive {{sleep apnea}} {{syndrome}} (OSAS) {{is a major}} public health problem which affects between 5 to 10 % of the general population. OSAS {{is known to be}} associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality mainly due to cardiovascular diseases and traffic accidents. The burden of illness is high for the individual and society. There are 2 treatment options for OSAS, Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) and Mandibular Advancement Device therapy (MAD). CPAP is known to be an effective but very constraining treatment. Patients are usually poorly adherent. MAD is a more recent treatment easier to use and consequently better tolerated, but MAD can only be prescribed to patients with satisfactory oral hygiene. Oral health constitutes a real issue particularly among underprivileged groups in France. Through this link, the question of whether low socio-economic status constitutes a barrier to access to care for patients with OSAS is raised. In a multicenter prospective cohort of 2822 consecutive OSAS patients in whom MAD has been proposed as an alternative to CPAP between May 15, 2007 and December 1 st, 2014, we identified the factors that lead to a patient diagnosed with OSAS to be treated by MAD instead of CPAP. A logistic regression was performed using a stepwise forward procedure. The main outcome of the study was that treatment by MAD was significantly associated with both educational attainment, as determined by the age at which the patient left full-time education, ≥ 18 years compared with < 18 (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) : 1. 64, 95 % CI 1. 23 to 2. 20), and the patient's occupational category.
