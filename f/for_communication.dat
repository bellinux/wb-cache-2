5|$|In {{addition}} {{to the use of}} sound <b>for</b> <b>communication,</b> a wide range of insects have evolved chemical means <b>for</b> <b>communication.</b> These chemicals, termed semiochemicals, are often derived from plant metabolites include those meant to attract, repel and provide other kinds of information. Pheromones, a type of semiochemical, are used for attracting mates of the opposite sex, for aggregating conspecific individuals of both sexes, for deterring other individuals from approaching, to mark a trail, and to trigger aggression in nearby individuals. Allomonea benefit their producer by the effect they have upon the receiver. Kairomones benefit their receiver instead of their producer. Synomones benefit the producer and the receiver. While some chemicals are targeted at individuals of the same species, others are used <b>for</b> <b>communication</b> across species. The use of scents is especially well known to have developed in social insects.|$|E

5|$|Bottlenose {{dolphins}} live {{in groups}} typically of 10–30 members, called pods, but group size varies from single {{individuals up to}} more than 1,000. Their diets consist mainly of forage fish. Dolphins often work as a team to harvest fish schools, but they also hunt individually. Dolphins search for prey primarily using echolocation, which is similar to sonar. They emit clicking sounds and listen for the return echos to determine the location and shape of nearby items, including potential prey. Bottlenose dolphins also use sound <b>for</b> <b>communication,</b> including squeaks and whistles, as well as sounds emitted through body movements, such as leaping from the water and slapping their tails on the water surface.|$|E

5|$|In 1960, {{physicists}} Philip Morrison and Giuseppe Cocconi {{proposed that}} extraterrestrial civilisations might be using radio signals <b>for</b> <b>communication.</b> Project Ozma, led by astronomer Frank Drake, used the Tatel Telescope {{to search for}} such signals from the nearby Sun-like stars Epsilon Eridani and Tau Ceti. The systems were observed at the emission frequency of neutral hydrogen, 1,420MHz (21cm). No signals of intelligent extraterrestrial origin were detected. Drake repeated the experiment in 2010, with the same negative result. Despite this lack of success, Epsilon Eridani made its way into science fiction literature and television shows for many years following news of Drake's initial experiment.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to their use as weapons, both sexes of the Rodrigues solitaire also used their wings <b>for</b> <b>communication.</b> The wings could create low-frequency sounds for communicating with mates, or to warn rivals, but it is unknown exactly how this sound was created. The sound could be heard 200 yards (182 m) away, and this may therefore be {{the size of the}} territory of an individual. Other species of birds are also known to use their wings to create sounds that attract mates or mark their territory.|$|E

The Sumatran and Javan rhinos, while defecating in piles, do not engage in the scraping. This adaptation in behavior is thought to be ecological; in the wet forests of Java and Sumatra, the method may not be useful for spreading odors.|$|E

During the 1960s and 1970s, spurred by an increasing commitment in the West towards the inclusion of disabled individuals in mainstream society and developing the skills required for independence, the use of manual sign language and then graphic symbol communication grew greatly. It was not until the 1980s that AAC began to emerge as a field in its own right.

In the SETILive project, which began in 2012, human volunteers analyze data from the Allen Telescope Array to search for possible alien signals that computers might miss because of terrestrial radio interference. The data for the study is obtained by observing Kepler target stars with the radio telescope.|$|E
5|$|One twin-turreted T-26 {{was given}} to the Research Institute of Communication in March 1932 to develop special tank {{communication}} devices.

A special terminal block was mounted on the rear of the tank so that communication wires could be connected. The work remained experimental.|$|E
