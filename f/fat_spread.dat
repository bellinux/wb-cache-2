40|$|AbstractThe {{present study}} aims to {{evaluate}} the suitability of flaxseed oil (rich plant source of long chain omega- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acid) as healthy oil in formulation of therapeutic <b>fat</b> <b>spread.</b> Eight <b>fat</b> <b>spread</b> samples containing 20 %, 40 %, 60 %, 80 % total blend fat were prepared. Total blend fat used in preparing different <b>fat</b> <b>spread</b> samples were prepared by blending flaxseed oil at various ratios with palm oil. However, other four <b>fat</b> <b>spread</b> samples were prepared as control sample using palm oil and soybean oil at different ratios. Each <b>fat</b> <b>spread</b> sample was analyzed for its moisture, fat, protein, ash and carbohydrate content {{as well as its}} sensory properties and microbiological characteristics. Total blend fat extracted from each <b>fat</b> <b>spread</b> sample was also analyzed for its physical and chemical properties, oxidative stability and fatty acid profile. The obtained results showed that all formulated <b>fat</b> <b>spread</b> samples were found to be in good microbiologically characteristics as they were free from contamination by different microorganism groups. The eight formulated fat spreads contained zero-trans fatty acids. The fatty acid C 16 : 0 was the predominant saturated fatty acid, in all prepared formulated <b>fat</b> <b>spread</b> samples, while, C 18 : 3 was the highest unsaturated one (the only omega- 3 fatty acid in vegetable oils) followed by C 18 : 1, the highest C 18 : 3 level of different fat spreads formulated from flaxseed oil is due to the highest percent of C 18 : 3 in such oil. Incorporation of flaxseed oil into <b>fat</b> <b>spread</b> samples had marked effect on their contents of such fatty acid. Inversely, all <b>fat</b> <b>spread</b> samples prepared from flaxseed oil showed less oxidative stability compared to control samples, another decreasing effect on resistance against the oxidative rancidity occurred as flaxseed oil% increased in the formulation. No significant differences were observed for sensory properties resulted from using flaxseed oil in <b>fat</b> <b>spread</b> formulations...|$|E

However, studies analyzing {{the effect of a}} combination of both in individuals at increased cardiometabolic risk are lacking. Therefore, this randomized, controlled, double-blind study investigated the effect of a <b>fat</b> <b>spread</b> enriched with two different doses of MCT {{and a special}} long-chain fatty acid-micronutrient combination on cardiometabolic risk factors in overweight diabetic patients. Methods: Fifty-four patients received either a <b>fat</b> <b>spread</b> with 6 g/d MCT (MCT 30 %) or 1. 2 g/d (MCT 6 %). Forty-three completed the study.

Clinical, anthropometric, blood, 24 h-urine parameters and dietary intake were assessed at baseline and after 12 weeks. Results: Total MCT intake> 7 g/d (MCT> 7 group) significantly reduced waist circumference (WC) by 1. 81 ± 2. 69 cm, whereas ≤ 7 g/d MCT (MCT ≤ 7 group) increased WC by 0. 32 ± 3. 03 cm (p = 0. 027), which was supported by a change in waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) (p = 0. 018). Fasting serum triglycerides (TG) increased in both groups over time due to dietary habits. In contrast, diabetic metabolic situation and urinary albumin excretion did not alter.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the effect of a <b>fat</b> <b>spread</b> enriched with vegetable oil sterols on plasma lipid, lipoprotein and apolipoprotein concentrations. A randomised double blind placebo-controlled crossover trial with two consecutive periods of 8 weeks was conducted. 30 patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia treated concurrently with an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin) and 32 patients with type IIa primary hypercholesterolaemia with a total cholesterol concentration > 6. 5 mmol/l not taking lipid-lowering drug therapy were recruited from a hospital lipid clinic. The active treatment was a fortified <b>fat</b> <b>spread</b> (25 g/day) providing 2. 5 g of plant sterols. The control spread was indistinguishable in taste and appearance. Comparison at the end of the two 8 -week trial periods showed a statistically significant reduction in total and LDL-cholesterol with use of the fortified spread but the results were confounded by a carry-over effect, which was partly explained by changes in the background diet. Because a carry-over effect was present, further analyses were restricted to the parallel arms of the first treatment period and were conducted on an intention to treat basis. After 4 weeks, LDL-cholesterol had decreased by 0. 04 mmol/l ([0. 8 %] 95 % confidence interval - 0. 44 - 0. 37 NS) in the placebo group and decreased by - 0. 76 mmol/l ([15. 0 %] 95 % CI - 1. 03 [...] 0. 48, P< 0. 0001) in the active treatment group. After 8 weeks, the corresponding results were 0. 0 mmol/l ([0. 0 %] 95 % CI - 0. 26 - 0. 24 NS) and - 0. 51 mmol/l ([10. 0 %] 95 % CI - 0. 73 [...] 0. 29 P< 0. 0001). There were no significant changes in apolipoprotein AI or B concentrations in the placebo group, but there was a small but statistically significant increase in apolipoprotein AI and a decrease in apolipoprotein B in the active treatment group. HDL cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations were unchanged. There was no difference in response between patients with statin-treated familial hypercholesterolaemia and patients with type IIa hyperlipoproteinaemia.

Such effect was biologically evaluated through assessment of four biochemical parameters that reflect the blood serum lipid profile, namely total cholesterol, low- and high-density lipoproteins and triglyceride levels during a feeding experiment for 8 successive weeks using male albino rats. Eight <b>fat</b> <b>spreads</b> containing 20 %, 40 %, 60 % and 80 % total fat were used; of these, four spreads were formulated using palm and flaxseed oils while the other four treatments were prepared by palm and soybean oils at the same concentrations. Results showed that <b>fat</b> <b>spreads</b> containing flaxseed oil exerted reducing effect on total cholesterol, LDL levels, TC/HDL and LDL/HDL ratios at higher rates compared with those containing soybean oil or pharmaceutical product especially after 8 weeks of feeding experiment. Levels of HDL in animals administered the studied <b>fat</b> <b>spreads</b> were lowered at significant to insignificant different rates. Flaxseed oil exerted its beneficial effect when it was incorporated into formulation at high amounts since G 6 (FPB 3, containing 29. 5 % flaxseed oil) and G 8 (FPB 4, containing 39 % flaxseed oil) animal groups exerted higher/comparative levels of HDL after 8 weeks of feeding compared to the initial concentration. Concerning triglycerides levels, all studied groups (except G 8, FPB 4) and controls showed significant higher levels at the end of feeding experiment compared to initial concentration. On the other hand, animals received the highest% of flaxseed oil (G 8, FPB 4) exerted its healthy effect as triglycerides levels were decreased from 104. 3 mg/dL at zero time to 92. 7 mg/dL after 4 weeks of feeding with decreasing rate of 11. 1 %, another reducing effect was noted after 8 weeks as triglycerides levels were significantly decreased to 79. 7 mg/dL (decreasing rate of 23. 6 %) ...|$|R

40|$|In {{a context}} of the {{reduction}} of fat consumption, {{the objective of the}} food industry is to develop low-fat. food products while maintaining their sensory properties. However, these sensory properties depend on. both subject’s physiology and product characteristics but, to date, their respective importance is not well. known. In this context, in-mouth phenomena during <b>fat</b> <b>spread</b> consumption appear to be an essential. phase to investigate in order to identify some of the mechanisms driving fat perception. Among the different studies published on dairy product consumption, fat spreads were poorly considered. while they represent an important industrial market. Moreover spread products are interesting by their. particular structure and composition (water-in-oil emulsions, solid fat content and different sources of fat. (vegetal and animal)) supposing the involvement of specific in-mouth mechanisms. In this context, our. objective was to understand better the respective impact of inter- individual and inter-product variability. on the oral processing events during consumption of fat spreads. In the current study, 15 subjects highly contrasted regarding their oral physiological characteristics were. selected. According to the literature, the oral physiological parameters (oral volume, saliva flow and. viscosity, saliva composition) chosen were considered as important in in-mouth <b>fat</b> <b>spread</b> breakdown and. then perception. In parallel, 4 experimental fat spreads were designed with two levels (53 % and 20 %) and. 2 qualities (mix of animal and vegetable, and only vegetable) of fat. The matrices were aromatized with a. specific dairy flavouring ingredient to improve in-mouth aroma release. Curcumin, a food grade. fluorescent probe, was added to the matrices and was used to measure the thickness of the lipid on the. tongue after swallowing (1). The release of aroma during product consumption was measured by APCIMS. (Atmospheric pressure chemical ionization-mass spectrometry) (2) on 6 aroma compounds (2, 3 -. butanedione, 2, 3 -pentanedione, 3 -hydroxy- 2 -butanone, γ-hexalactone, benzaldehyde, 2 -nonanone). differing by their structure and polarity. Results show that product_'s effect is more important than subject’s effect. In particular, product physicochemical. parameters (solid content, granulometry, texture) and predict better food bolus properties and. tongue coating than oral physiological characteristics. Concerning aroma release, results obtained were. different depending on the molecule considered and there was mainly a polarity effect. Interestingly, the. releases of 2 -nonanone were affected more by inter-individual variability than by inter-product. variability.

Objective: This study aimed to compare the effects of increased dietary intakes of ALA and EPA+DHA on a range of atherogenic risk factors. Design: This was a placebo-controlled, parallel study involving 150 moderately hyperlipidemic subjects randomly assigned to 1 of 5 interventions: 0. 8 or 1. 7 g EPA+DHA/d, 4. 5 or 9. 5 g ALA/d, or an n- 6 PUFA control for 6 mo.

Results: Study 1 &frac 34;median LDL cholesterol was reduced by the sterol esters (- 13. 6 %; P< 0. 001 by ANOVA on ranks; P< 0. 05 by pairwise comparison) and by stanols (- 8. 3 %; P= 0. 003, ANOVA and < 0. 05 pairwise comparison). With sterol esters plasma plant sterol levels rose (35 % for sitosterol, 51 % for campesterol; P< 0. 001); plasma lathosterol rose 20 % (P= 0. 03), indicating compensatory increased cholesterol synthesis. With stanols, plasma sitosterol fell 22 % (P= 0. 004), indicating less cholesterol absorption. None of the four carotenoids measured in plasma changed significantly. In study 2, median LDL cholesterol rose 6. 5 % with dairy spread and fell 12. 2 % with the sitosterol ester fortified spread (P= 0. 03 ANOVA and < 5 % pairwise comparison). Conclusion: 1.

This definition excludes specifically the trans fats (vaccenic acid and conjugated linoleic acid) that are present especially in human milk, dairy products, and beef.|$|R
40|$|International audiencePlant sterols are {{naturally}} occurring compounds {{that interfere with}} cholesterol absorption and thus reduce blood cholesterol levels. The objective of this review is to present recent advances in knowledge of the cholesterol-lowering action of plant sterols, focusing on the efficacy of plant sterol-enriched products, including full-fat, low-fat and non-fat food products. Although the cholesterol-lowering efficacy of plant sterols is well acknowledged, additional {{studies are needed to}} determine whether dietary cholesterol levels affect the cholesterol-lowering action of plant sterols, to establish the best time of day to consume plant sterol-enriched products, and to assess the optimal dose frequency of plant sterol intake. <b>Fat</b> <b>spreads</b> enriched with plant sterols/stanols {{have been shown to be}} effective in reducing circulating cholesterol levels in healthy adults with both normal and high cholesterol levels, as well as in children with hypercholesterolaemia. Such spreads can be used in combination with other approaches including a healthy diet, statin therapy and exercise for controlling blood cholesterol levels. Originally, plant sterols/stanols have been incorporated into <b>fat</b> <b>spreads</b> and, more recently, into low- or non-fat food products. However, the efficacy of plant sterols as cholesterol-lowering agents depends on their proper solubilization, while the majority of studies to date have incorporated plant sterols into vegetable oil-based spreads. Therefore, until more information is available, data from older studies using full-fat spreads cannot be used as a platform to promote novel and, as of yet, inadequately tested low-fat and non-fat plant sterol-enriched products...|$|R
40|$|Lipid {{oxidation}} {{can lower}} the nutritional value {{and quality of}} foods, and form toxic compounds, off-flavours and off-odours; its control in food systems rich in unstable omega- 3 oils is essential. Sunflower oil, camelina oil and a camelina:fish oil blend (72 : 28) emulsified using sodium caseinate (NaCas) had lower lipid hydroperoxides and p-Anisidine values (p- Avs) than their corresponding bulk oils (P< 0. 05). Oxidation also decreased as NaCas concentration and microfluidisation pressure increased (P< 0. 05). Increasing storage temperature of emulsions (5 - 60 °C) resulted in an apparent decrease in detectable lipid oxidation products on storage. Omega- 3 rich O/W emulsions (50 % oil), were incorporated into an outer oil phase of table spreads, to produce multiple emulsion systems (O/W/O), {{with the aim of}} further improving oxidative stability. Lipid hydroperoxides of the spreads increased over storage at 5 ºC, whereas p-Avs remained low (P< 0. 05). The continuous phase of the spreads appeared to be the phase most affecting primary oxidation product formation, irrespective of whether an omega- 3 rich inner phase was present, indicating a protective effect by the double emulsion. Oxidative stability of omega- 3 enriched <b>fat</b> <b>spreads</b> (O/W/O emulsions) using conventional lipid oxidation methods (lipid hydroperoxide and p-Anisidine values), was compared to volatile analysis using SPME-GC/MS and sensory evaluation. Results from sensory evaluation, lipid hydroperoxide analysis and volatile analysis were comparable, whereas p-Anisidine values were less consistent. The effectiveness of fat soluble (α-Tocopherol) and water soluble (green tea extract) antioxidants on the oxidation rate of sensitive ω- 3 rich oils, O/W emulsions and O/W/O emulsions (<b>fat</b> <b>spreads)</b> were examined. Emulsions containing α-Tocopherol had the highest lipid hydroperoxides, while emulsions containing green tea extract had the lowest (P 0. 05). O/W emulsions (camelina/sunflower) were spray-dried to yield powders containing 71. 7 - 85. 6 % oil. Emulsification and microencapsulation significantly improved oxidative stability (particularly in camelina oil) ...|$|R

40|$|Because many common {{foods are}} {{emulsions}} (mayonnaise, coffee creamers, salad dressing, etc.), {{a better understanding}} of lipid oxidation mechanisms in these systems is crucial for the formulation, production, and storage of the relevant consumer products. A research body has focused on the microstructural and oxidative stability of protein-stabilized oil-in-water emulsions that are structurally similar to innovative products that have been recently developed by the food industry (e. g., non-dairy creams, vegetable <b>fat</b> <b>spreads,</b> etc.) This review presents recent findings about the factors that determine the development of lipid oxidation in emulsions where proteins constitute the stabilizing interface. Emphasis is given to “endogenous” factors, such as those of compositional (e. g., protein/lipid phases, pH, presence of transition metals) or processing (e. g., temperature, droplet size) nature. Improved knowledge of the conditions that favor the oxidative protection of protein in emulsions can lead to their optimized use as food ingredients and thereby improve the organoleptic and nutritional value of the related products...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to survey the fatty acid profiles of <b>fat</b> <b>spreads,</b> margarines, shortenings, vegetable fat ice creams, vegetable fat milk-based cream substitutes, vegetable fat cheese substitutes, and reduced-fat cheeses on the Finnish market. The evaluation of the nutritional quality of fat in these products is of significance to dieticians and to the development of fat products with enhanced nutritional value. Remarkable differences between fatty acid profiles of vegetable fat products were found. Vegetable fat ice creams may have a lot of saturated fat and, in addition, the proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids may be very low. Vegetable fat half creams had, in general, less saturated fat and more polyunsaturated fatty acids than cream. The spreads and shortenings studied contained less than 2 % trans fatty acids of total fatty acids. Consumption of reduced-fat cheese in place of full-fat cheese does not negatively affect the nutritional quality of the consumed fat...|$|R
