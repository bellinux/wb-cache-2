The next day, the British heard that Lafayette had made camp nearby and sent 5,000men to trap and capture him. On 20 May, General Howe led a further 6,000soldiers and ordered an attack on his left flank. The flank scattered, and Lafayette organized a retreat while the British remained indecisive. To feign numerical superiority, Lafayette ordered men to appear from the woods on an outcropping (now Lafayette Hill) and to fire upon the British periodically.

5|$|The English were {{involved}} politically and militarily in Ireland since receiving the Lordship of Ireland from the pope in 1171. The campaign of English republican Protector Oliver Cromwell involved uncompromising {{treatment of the}} Irish towns (most notably Drogheda and Wexford) which supported the Royalists during the English Civil War. The English Army (and the subsequent British Army) remained in Ireland primarily to suppress Irish revolts and campaigns for independence. In addition to its conflict with Irish nationalists, it was <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>prospect</b> of battling Anglo-Irish and Ulster Scots in Ireland who were angered by unfavourable taxation of Irish produce imported into Britain. With other Irish groups, they raised a volunteer army and threatened to emulate the American colonists if their conditions were not met.

The British Army fought Irish rebels—Protestant and Catholic—primarily in Ulster and Leinster (Wolfe Tone's United Irishmen) in the 1798 rebellion.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the various constraints which OECD Member countries must now deal <b>with,</b> <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>prospects</b> of {{rapid growth in}} the number of frail elderly persons. It pays particular attention to recent trends in disability. Most of the available cross-country evidence shows trends towards better functional health in older populations, although the magnitude of the gains and their significance need further assessment. In this context, this paper advocates an “active ageing” approach to long-term care policies. It provides some rough estimates of the macroeconomic costs of long-term care. It also presents some indicators of public/private financing and institutionalisation rates. The public costs of providing long-term care are estimated to be relatively modest as a proportion of GDP (of the order of 1 or 2 per cent or less). However, much care for the frail elderly is provided through informal care-giving arrangements which are not reflected in official figures. ...|$|R
5|$|Helmichis' coup {{ultimately}} {{failed because}} it met strong {{opposition from the}} many Lombards who wanted to continue {{the war against the}} Byzantines and to confront the regicides. <b>Faced</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>prospect</b> of going to war at overwhelming odds, Helmichis asked for help from the Byzantines. The praetorian prefect Longinus enabled him to avoid a land route possibly held by hostile forces, by shipping him instead down the Po to Byzantine-held Ravenna, together with his wife, his Lombard and Gepid troops, the royal treasure and Albsuinda. Bognetti believes that Longinus may have planned to make the Lombards weaker by depriving them of any legitimate heir. In addition, because of the ongoing war, it was hard to assemble all the warriors to elect a new king formally. This plan was brought to nothing by the troops stationed in Ticinum, who elected their duke Cleph king, having it in mind to continue Alboin's aggressive policy. In contrast, Wolfram argues that Cleph was elected in Ticinum while Helmichis was still making his bid for the crown in Verona.|$|E

5|$|One {{reason for}} the change of {{strategy}} towards Scotland was {{a growing concern for}} the relationship between England and France. As long as Scotland and France were in an alliance, the English were <b>faced</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>prospect</b> of fighting a war on two fronts. The French carried out raids on English coastal towns, leading to rumours in England of a full-scale French invasion. In 1337, Philip VI confiscated the English king's Duchy of Aquitaine and the county of Ponthieu. Instead of seeking a peaceful resolution to the conflict by paying homage to the French king, as his father had done, Edward responded by laying claim to the French crown as the grandson of Philip IV. The French rejected this based on the precedents for agnatic succession set in 1316 and 1322. Instead, they upheld the rights of PhilipIV's nephew, King Philip VI (an agnatic descendant of the House of France), thereby setting the stage for the Hundred Years' War (see family tree below). In {{the early stages of the}} war, Edward's strategy was to build alliances with other Continental princes. In 1338, LouisIV named Edward vicar-general of the Holy Roman Empire and promised his support. As late as 1373, the Anglo-Portuguese Treaty of 1373 established an Anglo-Portuguese Alliance. These measures produced few results; the only major military victory in this phase of the war was the English naval victory at Sluys on 24 June 1340, which secured English control of the Channel.|$|E

40|$|<b>Faced</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>prospects</b> of a {{changing}} climate, {{a small but}} increasing number of countries are developing legal and regulatory frameworks that explicitly address climate change.

The present paper surveys three countries from different regions in the Global South that have developed or are developing such laws and policies: the Philippines (Asia-Paciﬁc), Mexico and more speciﬁcally its State of Chiapas (Latin America), and South Africa (Africa). It examines those experiences through two different lenses. The paper ﬁrst reviews the steps by which those laws or policies were developed. For this review, criteria for effective consultative processes are proposed. The study then examines the three climate change laws or policies per se. To this end, a framework including four modes of multi-level urban climate governance (governing by regulation, governing through enabling, governing by provision, governing with representation and consultation) is utilised. <b>The</b> paper ends <b>with</b> synthetic conclusions as to which experiences represent promising practices, and what other lessons are relevant for countries embarking on such processes...|$|R
50|$|It is {{not known}} when Yang Shili was born or where he was from. It is known {{that he was a}} general of the eunuch-commanded Left Shence Army as of 880.

5|$|While {{the victors}} were not {{limited by the}} Treaty of Versailles, many of the major naval powers were {{crippled}} after the war. <b>Faced</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>prospect</b> of a naval arms race against the United Kingdom and Japan, which would in turn {{have led to a}} possible Pacific war, the United States was keen to conclude the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922. This treaty limited the number and size of battleships that each major nation could possess, and required Britain to accept parity with the U.S. and to abandon the British alliance with Japan. The Washington treaty was followed by a series of other naval treaties, including the First Geneva Naval Conference (1927), the First London Naval Treaty (1930), the Second Geneva Naval Conference (1932), and finally the Second London Naval Treaty (1936), which all set limits on major warships. These treaties became effectively obsolete on September 1, 1939 at the beginning of World War II, but the ship classifications that had been agreed upon still apply. The treaty limitations meant that fewer new battleships were launched in 1919–39 than in 1905–14. The treaties also inhibited development by putting maximum limits on the weights of ships. Designs like the projected British , the first American , and the Japanese —all of which continued the trend to larger ships with bigger guns and thicker armor—never got off the drawing board. Those designs which were commissioned during this period were referred to as treaty battleships.|$|E

40|$|Fully-converged Grids and Web Services (WSs) {{can lead}} to the {{development}} of a new infrastructure that would offer a more powerful set of networking capabilities and features. On one hand, this convergence was favourably looked at, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> expectation of providing better technical solutions to highly complex business problems while, on the other hand, it was seen as an impossible task, bearing considerable risk and presenting many challenges along the way, resulting in a permanent rift between the two paradigms, Grids and WSs. This paper presents an overview of the past and ongoing efforts towards realizing this convergence, its potential benefits and the risks involved and measures to avoid them. Furthermore, we argue that if this convergence is unsuccessful, with future WSs moving away from Grid-oriented principles and implementations, the concept of Grids might fade gradually away, giving way to the competing technologies. The Grid paradigm however offers certain advantages and is in this sense irreplaceable. <b>Faced</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>prospects</b> of non-convergence and consequent demise, in order to achieve a viable Grid infrastructure, Grids need to maintain their identity by providing application-oriented, real-world enterprise solutions to business applications. Grid technology would need more and more to be applied in a practical and efficient way to real use cases, to demonstrate its comparative advantage over other competing technologies. In order to fully exploit the potential of WSs, Grid technology needs to come out from its internal tussle of definitions, standards, etc. which has been a major set-back for the future of Grids, not only in the past but also at present, and move forward faster in terms of its implementation in real-world enterprise use cases and applications.
