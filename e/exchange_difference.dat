It especially focuses on determination of exchange rate for conversion of transaction to the domestic currency and for solving the <b>exchange</b> <b>difference.</b> In the next part there are described issues with the <b>exchange</b> <b>difference</b> from the view of IAS/IFRS. There are explained terms like functional currency and presentation currency. Also there are described the methods for transfer of financial reports from foreign currency to the functional currency and from the functional currency to the presentation currency.

Under the economic crisis of the thirties and the implementation of mechanisms to cope with it, the government assumed the control over the foreign exchange market and thus the possibility of establishing by his discretion the values of foreign currency, especially the price that was to rule in any transaction of purchase or sale of it. The study of this Fund offers the possibility of an approximation –at a micro level- of the sources that have financed public spending, its destination and the redistributive impact of government’s fiscal policy. public spending, redistributive impact, control over foreign exchange market...|$|E
40|$|This {{article is}} based on a {{substantial}} change in the tax treatment of exchange differences of liabilities associated with the purchase of inventory and fixed assets. It aims to determine whether these changes {{have a significant impact on}} the interpretation of the main financial indicators of the companies that operate in Peru and whose accounting is based on the guidelines of the tax legislation. To determine if this impact really exist both accounting and tax standards were analyzed and a financial evaluation model was developed. This model allowed examine the variations of selected ratios for the research in response to changing regulations and according to different proposed scenarios. Result of the model concluded that there is a light to medium tendency to distortion of the main financial indicators produced by the change in the tax treatment of the <b>exchange</b> <b>difference.</b> Finally, it is advisable to conduct a meticulous analysis when evaluating entities whose accounting analysis is based on the tax legislation, since with the most recent treatment of exchange differences, the financial position of the company might be misinterpreted if interpreted only the ratios as it could show signs of improvement or deterioration when in fact remains constant.  </p...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{effects of}} temperature, initial heating {{conditions}} or self heating during the process, {{are very important}} during the injection stretch blow moulding (ISBM) process of PET bottles. They control the preform temperature distribution and strongly affect the blowing kinematics via the important influence of temperature on mechanical behaviour. The temperature affects the orientation induced by biaxial stretching, which in turn, affects mechanical properties of PET. Therefore, thermal proprieties {{are one of the}} most important variables in the ISBM. In order to achieve accurate simulation of the ISBM process, it is necessary to: (i) measure the initial temperature distribution of the preform when the blowing operation begins; (ii) follow the history of the temperature field and consequently to identify the thermal proprieties of the PET; (iii) to model the behaviour law of PET coupled to the thermal laws. In this work, we modelled the PET behaviour in ISBM strian rate and temperature conditions by a thermo-viscohyperelastic model which has been inspired from Figiel and Buckley 2009 [1] and already presented by Luo et al. 2011 [2]. A procedure is proposed for the identification of the thermal parameters from experimental results of a test where PET sheets are heated using infrared (IR) lamps. The Monte Carlo method is used to provide the parameters best fit from the temperature evolution measured on the face in front of the lamps and from the rear face. The beginning of the temperature evolution gives information on the IR flux and the final stage of the heating gives information on the convection <b>exchange.</b> <b>Difference</b> between the front and the rear faces gives information on the PET conductivity. Using a finite element approach implemented in Matlab, the coupled thermo-visco-hyperelastic model has been used to simulate the ISBM process. The results from the computer simulation can be compared with the temperature profiles measured by thermal imaging...|$|E
40|$|The {{goal of the}} {{research}} {{was to investigate the}} secondary structure and orientation of the channel forming transmembrane segments in the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) and their change in orientation upon desensitization. The long term objective is to further characterize the desensitized state of the nAChR as a basis of better understanding how the modulation of synaptic transmission is involved in brain function. FTIR spectroscopy was first used to probe the secondary structure of the nAChR and the changes in structure induced upon channel inactivation. Both qualitative and quantitative analysis of the secondary structure-sensitive amide I band of FTIR spectra of the nAChR support a mixed alpha/beta type protein with a predominance of alpha-helices. Stabilization of the nAChR in channel inactive conformations by either prolonged exposure to the agonist carbamylcholine, to the non-competitive antagonist tetracaine or upon reconstitution into membranes lacking anionic phospholipids and cholesterol revealed no changes in the amide I band, hydrogen/deuterium exchange kinetics or <b>exchange</b> <b>difference</b> spectra attributed to a change in protein conformation. Several approaches were directed toward the elucidation of the secondary structure of the transmembrane segments in the nAChR. Hydrogen/deuterium exchange experiments revealed the presence of an exchange resistant core of hydrogen peptides, corresponding to roughly 25 % of the protein, mainly alpha-helical, and likely located in the solvent inaccessible transmembrane domain. 1 H/ 2 H exchange experiments at alkaline pH and upon reconstitution of the nAChR in egg phosphatidylcholine membranes to increase the rate and extent of exchange were performed and support a high proportion of alpha-helical peptides in the exchange resistant core of the nAChR. The amide I band of FTIR spectra of the transmembrane domain of the nAChR isolated by pronase under membrane disruption conditions (less than 3. 7 kDa in size) revealed a very high content of alpha-helices. Similarly, we analyzed the secondary structure of individual transmembrane segments from the nAChR isolated by Dr. Michael Blanton at Texas Tech University and observed a high alpha-helical content. Taken together, these results support an alpha-helical transmembrane domain in the nAChR. Polarized FTIR spectroscopy revealed, for the first time, an average calculated tilt angle of roughly 41 ° of the transmembrane segments in proteolyzed nAChR and no detectable net change in orientation was observed upon carbamylcholine induced desensitization...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine {{volatility}} transmissions between portfolios of cross-listed equities and <b>exchange</b> rate <b>differences</b> and also the volatility persistence for home, foreign equities, and <b>exchange</b> rate <b>differences</b> in the UK and German markets. Design/methodology/approach – A primary focus of this paper is to see if there is an impact first on the volatility persistence for foreign equities that are listed in the UK and German markets, second on the respective home portfolios of cross-listed equities, and third on the <b>exchange</b> rate <b>differences.</b> In addition, whether there are any bilateral spillovers between the following equity portfolios: foreign cross-listed equities, home cross-listed equities, and also local or global <b>exchange</b> rate <b>differences</b> are investigated. Findings – The paper finds that the volatility persistence is more prominent than error persistence from cross-listed equities, foreign or home, and the <b>exchange</b> rate <b>differences.</b> Furthermore, the transmission mechanism indicates a bilateral integration process in some of the cases that were examined. Based on these results, it is concluded that in the UK market the foreign cross-listings affect less the domestic equities compared to the German market.
