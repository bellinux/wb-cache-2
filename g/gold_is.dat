5|$|A green tinge in {{the skin}} is {{sometimes}} associated with nausea and sickness. The expression 'green at the gills' means appearing sick. The color, when combined with <b>gold,</b> <b>is</b> sometimes seen as representing the fading of youth. In some Far East cultures the color green {{is used as a}} symbol of sickness or nausea.|$|E
5|$|Each civilization can {{purchase}} upgrades {{that increase the}} rate of gathering these resources. Players can construct a marketplace for trade; players can trade wood, stone, and food for gold, and use gold to buy other resources. Market prices fluctuate with every transaction. Furthermore, markets and docks can also generate gold by using trading carts or cogs which are used to visit foreign markets and ports; once they return to the player's market/dock, <b>gold</b> <b>is</b> added to the stockpile. The amount of gold a trade unit earns on each trip {{is related to the}} distance it had to travel to a foreign market; more <b>gold</b> <b>is</b> earned on longer trips. It is possible to trade with enemies' markets or docks, but the player's trading units may be attacked or destroyed by enemy units in the process. Players do not need to keep trading manually, as once they select the port or market the trading units infinitely continue to trade.|$|E
50|$|After grinding, the ore was fed to the leach circuit {{where the}} <b>gold</b> <b>was</b> dissolved. Dissolved <b>gold</b> <b>was</b> {{recovered}} in the carbon-in-pulp circuit. Once or twice per week the carbon was {{treated in a}} 15-tonne pressure Zadra strip process. <b>Gold</b> <b>was</b> recovered from the pregnant solution on stainless steel wool cathodes in the refinery.|$|R
50|$|<b>Gold</b> <b>was</b> first {{discovered}} on Bear Gulch in 1910. Over 53,000 ounces of worn but not well-rounded <b>gold</b> <b>were</b> {{recovered from the}} creek, including a 100-ounce nugget.|$|R
50|$|<b>Gold</b> <b>was</b> {{found in}} Pyrenees Ranges near Clunes {{and in the}} Plenty Ranges near Melbourne in 1841 and the <b>gold</b> <b>was</b> sent to Hobart where it was sold.|$|R
5|$|Generally, {{the player}} starts {{out with a}} Dungeon Heart and some Imps. The Dungeon Heart has the same purpose as the {{original}} game: it serves as the dungeon's life force. If destroyed, the player loses. In Dungeon Keeper 2, the heart has additional functions: regenerating mana (used to cast spells), doubling as a gold-storage area, producing Imps, and sending certain creatures to investigate threats it detects. <b>Gold</b> <b>is</b> the currency used to construct rooms, traps, and doors, and pay minions. <b>Gold</b> <b>is</b> obtained primarily by digging gold and gem seams, the latter providing an unlimited supply. This is performed by the Imps, the main workforce of the dungeon, who dig and claim tiles for the player to control. Another main task Imps perform is the fortification of walls adjacent to tiles owned by the player, although this no longer makes them impenetrable to enemies, but merely makes digging take longer.|$|E
5|$|The element's major use (approximately 80% {{of world}} rhodium production) is {{as one of}} the {{catalysts}} in the three-way catalytic converters in automobiles. Because rhodium metal is inert against corrosion and most aggressive chemicals, and because of its rarity, rhodium is usually alloyed with platinum or palladium and applied in high-temperature and corrosion-resistive coatings. White <b>gold</b> <b>is</b> often plated with a thin rhodium layer to improve its appearance while sterling silver is often rhodium-plated for tarnish resistance.|$|E
5|$|The series {{follows the}} adventures of Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada), a human boy, and his best friend and adopted brother Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio), a dog with magical powers to change shape and grow and shrink at will. In this episode, BMO (voiced by Niki Yang)—concerned that Finn and Jake's hoard of <b>gold</b> <b>is</b> {{threatening}} the structural integrity of their treehouse—talks Finn into spending the money in Wildberry Kingdom.|$|E
5000|$|In the 2005 {{action movie}} Sahara, Confederate <b>gold</b> <b>was</b> placed {{on board the}} CSS Texas which ended up in Africa. The <b>gold</b> <b>was</b> later found by Dirk Pitt.|$|R
5000|$|In the Italian {{comic book}} Tex, Confederate <b>gold</b> <b>was</b> placed {{on board a}} Confederate river ironclad which {{ended up in the}} swamps around the Arkansas River. The <b>gold</b> <b>was</b> later found by members of the Ku Klux Klan who {{intended}} to use it to finance a new rebellion in the Southern United States. The ironclad, along with the <b>gold,</b> <b>was</b> destroyed in an explosion by Tex Willer.|$|R
50|$|In Tromsø, the <b>gold</b> <b>was</b> {{loaded onto}} the British cruiser HMS Enterprise. The cruiser sailed south to Harstad, before departing on 25 May. Enterprise survived two German air attacks {{en route to}} Scapa Flow. From there, she sailed to Greenock, where the <b>gold</b> <b>was</b> brought ashore. The <b>gold</b> <b>was</b> taken by train to Bank of England's vault in London. Finally, the <b>gold</b> <b>was</b> shipped in {{instalments}} across the Atlantic Ocean to America and to Canada. Of the 50 tons from Oslo, the only losses <b>were</b> 297 <b>gold</b> coins from a barrel damaged during transit aboard a British vessel.|$|R
5|$|Warcraft {{requires}} {{players to}} collect resources, and to produce buildings and units {{in order to}} defeat an opponent in combat. Non-combatant builders deliver the resources to the Town Center from mines, from which <b>gold</b> <b>is</b> dug, and forests, where wood is chopped. As both are limited resources which become exhausted during the game, players must collect them efficiently, and also retain forests as defensive walls in the early game when combat forces are small.|$|E
5|$|Artemis {{is finally}} granted the ransom. The <b>gold</b> <b>is</b> sent in, and Artemis asks Holly for a wish: to cure his mother's insanity— {{she has been}} living in her bedroom, driven mad by the loss of her husband. Holly grants the wish at the cost of half the gold. The LEP decides to send in a 'blue rinse' – a {{biological}} bomb that kills all organic life— to eliminate Artemis and allow for the retrieval of the gold, but this fails when Artemis escapes the time-stop by drugging himself and his comrades with sleeping pills.|$|E
5|$|At the farm, the leprechaun lures J. D. {{into a trap}} by imitating a cat, biting and {{injuring}} his hand. Tory and the others rush him to the hospital, and the leprechaun follows on a tricycle. Alex and Ozzie visit a pawn shop {{to see if the}} <b>gold</b> <b>is</b> pure, and the leprechaun kills several townspeople. The leprechaun returns to the farmhouse, where he searches for his gold and shines every shoe. After leaving J. D. at the hospital, the group drives back to the farmhouse. Finding it ransacked, Nathan checks outside, where he is injured by a bear trap set by the leprechaun.|$|E
50|$|Nubia was a {{major source}} of gold in the ancient world. <b>Gold</b> <b>was</b> {{a major source of}} Kushitic wealth and power. <b>Gold</b> <b>was</b> mined East of the Nile in Wadi Allaqi and Wadi Cabgaba.|$|R
50|$|Their {{third album}} Mended with <b>Gold</b> <b>was</b> {{released}} on September 30, 2014. In {{the fall of}} 2014, Mended with <b>Gold</b> <b>was</b> featured on NPR's All Songs Considered list for the top albums of September.|$|R
50|$|<b>Gold</b> <b>was</b> {{chairman}} of Hibernian until he resigned after {{the club was}} relegated in 1998. In 1998, {{he was invited to}} deliver the Marlow (Scotland) Lecture to the Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders in Scotland. <b>Gold</b> <b>was</b> also on the boards of NHS Lanarkshire, Scottish Enterprise, the Scottish Chamber of Commerce and the Confederation of British Industry in Scotland. Until June 2009 <b>Gold</b> <b>was</b> the executive {{chairman of}} the SPL.|$|R
5|$|Body {{piercing}} jewellery should be hypoallergenic. A number of materials are used, with varying strengths and weaknesses. Surgical stainless steel, niobium and titanium {{are commonly used}} metals, with titanium {{the least likely to}} cause allergic reaction of the three. Platinum and palladium are also safe alternatives, even in fresh piercings. Initial piercings should never be done with gold of any grade, as <b>gold</b> <b>is</b> mixed with other metals, and sterling silver is not a good alternative in a piercing, as it may cause allergies in initial piercings and will tarnish in piercings of any age. An additional risk for allergic reaction may arise when the stud or clasp of jewellery is made from a different metal than the primary piece.|$|E
5|$|During {{the last}} decade of the 19th century, {{minerals}} such as gold were mined with limited success. The last mine was abandoned in 1907, but panning for <b>gold</b> <b>is</b> still allowed in many areas of the forest, and in most circumstances no permit is required. After the end of the mining era, numerous camps were established by the Civilian Conservation Corps to help combat unemployment during the Great Depression of the 1930s. The camps housed groups of unemployed men who were paid by the federal government to build roads, hiking trails, and campgrounds for future travelers to the Yellowstone region. Visitation to national forests like Shoshone increased dramatically after World War II with the advent of better roads and accessibility to the region.|$|E
5|$|Garden City High School (known {{locally as}} GCHS) is a fully {{accredited}} high school, serving {{students in grades}} 9–12, located in Garden City, Kansas, USA. Garden City High School (GCHS), a part of Garden City Public Schools, is the only high school within the city limits of Garden City, KS. The school colors are brown and white, although <b>gold</b> <b>is</b> no longer considered an official color. Approximately 2,111 students are enrolled for the 2016-2017 school year. The current principal is Steve Nordby.|$|E
25|$|At the time, the <b>gold</b> spike <b>was</b> {{actually}} a regular iron spike. A <b>gold</b> spike <b>was</b> on hand, but the <b>gold</b> <b>was</b> too soft {{and instead of}} being driven, was just hammered out of shape.|$|R
50|$|<b>Gold</b> <b>was</b> officially first {{discovered}} at Flagstaff in January 1855 and gained much media attention. <b>Gold</b> <b>was</b> again discovered at Flagstaff in June 1855 and brought many prospectors into the area, including seven local pubs.|$|R

5|$|In {{nineteenth century}} China, Jungle Village {{is home to}} several warring clans. The village {{blacksmith}} creates deadly weapons for the clans, intending to use his payments to purchase the freedom of his lover Lady Silk, and leave the village. The region's governor tasks the Lion Clan's leader, Gold Lion, with protecting a large shipment of gold that must pass through the village. <b>Gold</b> <b>is</b> betrayed by his lieutenants Silver Lion and Bronze Lion, who plan to steal the gold. They use the chaos ensuing from a fight with the Hyena Clan to allow their co-conspirator Poison Dagger—the governor's aide—to assassinate Gold, after which Silver becomes the Lions' leader. Gold's son Zen-Yi learns of his father's murder and sets off to the village to seek revenge.|$|E
5|$|Iridium {{is one of}} {{the nine}} least {{abundant}} stable elements in Earth's crust, having an average mass fraction of 0.001ppm in crustal rock; <b>gold</b> <b>is</b> 40 times more abundant, platinum is 10 times more abundant, and silver and mercury are 80 times more abundant. Tellurium is about as abundant as iridium. In contrast to its low abundance in crustal rock, iridium is relatively common in meteorites, with concentrations of 0.5ppm or more. The overall concentration of iridium on Earth is thought to be much higher than what is observed in crustal rocks, but because of the density and siderophilic ("iron-loving") character of iridium, it descended below the crust and into Earth's core when the planet was still molten.|$|E
5|$|Ironstone {{outcrops}} {{along the}} northern edge of the South Wales Coalfield were extensively worked for the production of iron and were important in the initiation of the Industrial Revolution in South Wales. Lead was mined at Pentre Halkyn in Flintshire during the Roman occupation of Britain and there were ore-bearing sites in Clwyd where lead, silver and sometimes zinc were mined. These metals were also mined in the upland areas of the Rivers Ystwyth and Rheidol. Manganese, titanium and numerous other minerals occur in various parts of Wales. <b>Gold</b> <b>is</b> found in southern Snowdonia and at Dolaucothi, and Snowdonia had a flourishing copper industry from the early 1800s. Although exploited in the past, none of these minerals is mined on a commercial scale today.|$|E
50|$|In the {{following}} list, the first titles listed in <b>gold</b> <b>are</b> the winners; those not in <b>gold</b> <b>are</b> nominees, which {{are listed in}} alphabetical order. The years given are those in which the ceremonies took place.|$|R
50|$|Bellville {{was also}} {{well known for}} {{being a part of}} the gold rush. The first <b>gold</b> <b>was</b> panned on Dead Man’s Run, which caused people from all over to come pan for <b>gold.</b> The <b>gold</b> <b>was</b> {{discovered}} by James C. Lee. Even though the <b>gold</b> that <b>was</b> found was almost pure, little more was discovered.|$|R
50|$|About 37000 ozt kg of <b>gold</b> <b>was</b> {{produced}} from the Cornwall iron mine five {{miles south of}} Lebanon, Lebanon County, Pennsylvania. Although the deposit produced iron since 1742, no <b>gold</b> <b>was</b> reported from the mine until 1878.|$|R
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, <b>gold</b> <b>is</b> a siderophile, or iron-loving element. It does not readily form {{compounds}} with either oxygen or sulfur. At {{the time of}} the Earth's formation, and as the most noble (inert) of metals, gold sank into the core due to its tendency to form high-density metallic alloys. Consequently, it is a relatively rare metal. Some other (less) noble heavy metals—molybdenum, rhenium, the platinum group metals (ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, osmium, iridium, and platinum), germanium, and tin—can be counted as siderophiles but only in terms of their primary occurrence in the Earth (core, mantle and crust), rather the crust. These metals otherwise occur in the crust, in small quantities, chiefly as chalcophiles (less so in their native form).|$|E
5|$|One {{suitable}} {{method for}} purification for the raw platinum, which contains platinum, gold, {{and the other}} platinum-group metals, is to process it with aqua regia, in which palladium, gold and platinum are dissolved, whereas osmium, iridium, ruthenium and rhodium stay unreacted. The <b>gold</b> <b>is</b> precipitated {{by the addition of}} iron(II) chloride and after filtering off the gold, the platinum is precipitated as ammonium chloroplatinate by the addition of ammonium chloride. Ammonium chloroplatinate can be converted to platinum by heating. Unprecipitated hexachloroplatinate(IV) may be reduced with elemental zinc, and a similar method is suitable for small scale recovery of platinum from laboratory residues. Mining and refining platinum has environmental impacts.|$|E
5|$|The Rookie of the Year Award {{is given}} to the highest-finishing first-time competitor. The Dawson Award, {{consisting}} of four ounces of <b>gold,</b> <b>is</b> given to the first musher to reach Dawson City (the midpoint) who also finishes the competition. The final award is the Red Lantern, given to the last official finisher of the year's race. Two awards have been discontinued: the Kiwanis Award, given to the first musher to cross the Alaska–Yukon border, and the Mayor's Award, given to the Yukon Quest champion by the Mayor of Fairbanks.|$|E
50|$|In January 1897 {{alluvial}} <b>gold</b> <b>was</b> {{discovered at}} Red Hill, {{on the northern}} edge of the lake by the prospector Percy Larkin. His first parcel of 106 oz of <b>gold</b> <b>was</b> found near where Kambalda stands today.|$|R
50|$|The gold payment, {{along with}} weapons (M16) {{to guard the}} <b>gold</b> <b>were</b> {{delivered}} to the Captain by the local boss. The <b>gold</b> <b>was</b> never found on-board because it was transferred to another freighter during a rendezvous in mid-sea.|$|R
50|$|In 1992, Slew o' <b>Gold</b> <b>was</b> {{inducted}} into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame. In The Blood-Horse magazine ranking of the top 100 U.S. thoroughbred champions of the 20th Century, Slew o' <b>Gold</b> <b>was</b> ranked #58.|$|R
