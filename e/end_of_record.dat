Each record was terminated by an Ortho word for error checking followed by an <b>End</b> <b>of</b> <b>Record</b> word.

40|$|A high-resolution, 8000 year-long ice core {{record from}} the Mt. Logan summit plateau (5300 m asl) reveals the {{initiation}} of trans-Pacific lead (Pb) pollution by ca. 1730, and a > 10 -fold increase in Pb concentration (1981 - 1998 mean = 68. 9 ng/l) above natural background (5. 6 ng/l) attributed to rising anthropogenic Pb emissions from Asia. The largest rise in North Pacific Pb pollution from 1970 - 1998 (<b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>record)</b> is contemporaneous with a decrease in Eurasian and North American Pb pollution as documented in ice core records from Greenland, Devon Island, and the European Alps. The distinct Pb pollution history in the North Pacific is interpreted to result from the later industrialization and less stringent abatement measures in Asia compared to North America and Eurasia. The Mt. Logan record shows evidence for both a rising Pb emissions signal from Asia and a trans-Pacific transport efficiency signal related {{to the strength of}} the Aleutian Low...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA {{sediment}} core {{has been}} retrieved from Vanevan peat (south-eastern shore of Lake Sevan, Armenia), which is today disconnected from Lake Sevan {{thanks to an}} artificial shallowing of the lake. Based on 5 radiocarbon dates, Vanevan record covers the Mid Holocene (from ca. 7800 to ca. 5100  cal.  BP). The Late Holocene is today absent in the peat stratigraphy due to modern peat exploitation by surface mining. This study focuses on a multi-proxy approach including pollen, charcoals, and pollen-inferred climate reconstruction. An open-land, steppic vegetation is recorded up to ca. 7700  cal.  BP, followed by a more forested landscape during the Mid Holocene (up to ca. 5700  cal.  BP), and ending again with an open-land vegetation (to the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>record,</b> 5100  cal.  BP). This vegetation dynamics responds to general climate changes documented in the Near East. Whether human activities are documented since ca. 7500  cal.  BP (Late Neolithic) in Vanevan, they remain marginal and probably {{did not affect the}} area. Early Holocene dry climate, which caused the steppic environment to be widespread through the Near East, is strongly related to low late spring precipitation (PMay–Jun =  180  mm). Mid Holocene forested landscape and increasing lake-level seem related to late spring precipitation (+ 28 %), which is the main change in estimated climate parameters. This has to be linked with reinforcement of the Westerlies and less active Siberian High, which are inversely involved in the following, dry phase starting at ca. 5700  cal.  B...|$|E
