60|$|<b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> {{were not}} deluding herself with some {{impossible}} hope. It was not that, however.|$|E
60|$|It {{sounded to}} myself a clumsy ruse. <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> would suspect what was behind it.|$|E
60|$|I {{looked at}} her, and I winced also. She shrank in such simple pain {{from the fact}} of her defect. <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> were bullied because of it, or only afraid lest {{visitors}} would dislike it.|$|E
5000|$|I told Kate she's {{running for}} the hills; <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> knew <b>I</b> was joking.|$|R
5000|$|Will She Mon Wait For Me (episode 21) (<b>I</b> <b>Wonder</b> <b>If</b> <b>She</b> Will Wait For Me) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wish," [...] {{continued}} the good lady, [...] "you would ask her {{a question or}} two about her parents: <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> remembers them?" ...|$|R
60|$|She {{looked at}} me with those {{pleasant}} eyes of hers, which had remained as candid and as sympathetic as they had been more than twenty years before. <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> was making a fool of me.|$|E
60|$|After tea Peggy and I {{went over}} to see Aunt Olivia, who had asked our advice about a wrapper. She was sewing as for dear life, {{and her face was}} primmer and colder than ever. <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> knew of Mr. Malcolm MacPherson's departure. Delicacy forbade me to mention it but Peggy had no such scruples.|$|E
60|$|After the {{incident}} {{of the discussion}} of barbarians I thought that Victory's manner toward me changed perceptibly. She held aloof from me, and when Snider took his turn at the wheel, sat beside him, upon the pretext that she wished {{to learn how to}} steer the launch. <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> had guessed the man's antipathy for me, and was seeking his company solely for the purpose of piquing me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not at all. The latter {{practice}} {{is the only}} way to be agreeable! By-the-bye, Alick, <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> will deign to come to the ball?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lady Blakeney is very {{beautiful}} too, Fanchon," [...] rejoined the actress naively, [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> will wear anything {{as fine as}} the Marny necklace?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'd {{like to try}} {{gooseberry}} tarts. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> {{made them}} as I do my raspberry ones," [...] said Daisy, whose interest in cooking had lately revived.|$|R
60|$|I suggested, {{a little}} warmly, {{that if she}} allowed her father to leave her alone at night with {{delicate}} children, she {{had no right to}} choose WHO should assist her in an emergency. It struck me afterwards that this was not very complimentary to him, and I added hastily that <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> expected some young lady to be passing along the trail at midnight! But this reminded me of Johnson's style of argument, and I stopped.|$|E
6000|$|Giving her {{a strict}} charge {{to be careful}} of her manner, and only to carry in my card and say I waited, I sat down in the drawing-room (which we had now reached) until she should come back. Its former {{pleasant}} air of occupation was gone, and the shutters were half closed. The harp had not been used for many and many a day. His picture, as a boy, was there. The cabinet in which his mother had kept his letters was there. <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> ever read them now; if she would ever read them more! ...|$|E
60|$|I {{went home}} {{thinking}} {{of all these}} things and of Donna Giulia. I was rather amused at my unintentional kiss; <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> was thinking of me.... She really was a charming creature, and I was glad {{at the idea of}} seeing her again on the morrow. I liked her simple, fervent piety. She was in the habit of going regularly to mass, and happening to see her one day, I was struck with her devout air, full of faith; she also went to confessional frequently. It was rather absurd to think she was the perverse being people pretended....|$|E
6000|$|... "By-the-bye, Lady Ferringhall," [...] he said, [...] "do {{you know}} that I am a very great admirer of your sister's? <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> has ever spoken to you of me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps Dr. Rodd is of {{the same}} way of thinking. Great shame that such a girl should be handed over to a medical scoundrel like Dr. Rodd. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> cares for him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{replied the}} other, looking {{up with a}} smile. [...] "Professor Maxon says that in another day or two I may come and live in his own house, and again meet his {{beautiful}} daughter. It seems almost {{too good to be}} true that I shall actually live under the same roof with her and see her every day--sit at the same table with her--and walk with her among the beautiful trees and flowers that witnessed our first meeting. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> will remember me. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> will be as glad to see me again as I shall be to see her." ...|$|R
60|$|But {{this was}} not to be all. I recollected the {{handcuffs}} in his state-room, which he preferred to use on sailors instead of the ancient and clumsy ship irons. So, when we left him, he lay handcuffed hand and foot. For {{the first time in many}} days I breathed freely. I felt strangely light as I came on deck, as though a weight had been lifted off my shoulders. I felt, also, that Maud and I had drawn more closely together. And <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>she,</b> too, felt it, as we walked along the deck side by side to where the stalled foremast hung in the shears.|$|E
60|$|The theatre was full--crammed to its roof: royal {{and noble}} were there: palace and hotel had emptied their inmates into those tiers so thronged and so hushed. Deeply did I feel myself privileged {{in having a}} place before that stage; I longed to see a being of whose powers I had heard reports which made me {{conceive}} peculiar anticipations. <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> would justify her renown: with strange curiosity, with feelings severe and austere, yet of riveted interest, I waited. She was a study of such nature as had not encountered my eyes yet: a great and new planet she was: but in what shape? I waited her rising.|$|E
60|$|But {{in spite}} of my discomforts and violent exertions I found myself under the {{influence}} of some very pleasurable emotions, occasioned by the incident of the slender girl. Her childlike frankness was charming to me. There was not another girl in a thousand who would have told me that story of the peas. I felt glad that she had known who I was when she was talking to me, and that her simple confidences had been given to me personally, and not to an entire stranger who had happened along. <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> resembled her father or her mother, and I had no doubt that to possess such a daughter they must both be excellent people.|$|E
6000|$|... "Little Psyche {{is looking}} for her Cupid everywhere, as I have looked for mine. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> ever found and lost him, as I did? <b>If</b> <b>she</b> does find him again, I'll accept it as a good omen." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In England. She {{seemed to}} know he was at the Dayspring, and managed, I fancy, intentionally, to leave me with the {{impression}} that they were especial friends in the Old Country. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> knows he will be on board to-day?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I remember," [...] she said, [...] "Mrs. Curtis kept great order. In fact, between ourselves, she {{was rather}} a dragon; and Lady Temple, {{though she had}} one child then, seemed like my {{companion}} and playfellow. Dear little Lady Temple, <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> is altered!" ...|$|R
60|$|I'd {{thought she}} looked kind of glum, and <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> and Micky had had a falling out. I rather {{suspected}} it, for at the Senior Prom, three nights before, she had hardly looked at Micky, but had sat {{in a corner and}} talked to the Old Fellow. He didn't do much talking; he was too shy, and he looked mighty uncomfortable. I thought it kind of mean of Sylvia to torment him so, when she knew he hated to have to talk to girls, but when I saw Micky scowling at the corner, I knew she was doing it to make him jealous. Girls won't stick at anything when they want to provoke a chap; I know it to my cost, for Jennie Price--but {{that has nothing to do}} with this story.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not that I know of," [...] I said angrily. <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> {{knew how}} deeply she had hurt me. The others laughed. The colour rose in Nancy's cheeks, {{and she gave}} me an appealing, almost tearful look, but my heart had hardened. As soon as supper was over I left the table to wander, nursing my wrongs, in a far corner of the garden, gay shouts and {{laughter}} still echoing in my ears. I was negligible, even my pathetic subterfuge had been detected and cruelly ridiculed by these friends whom I had always loved and sought out, and who now were so absorbed in their own prospects and happiness that they cared nothing for mine. And Nancy! I had been betrayed by Nancy!... Twilight was coming on. I remember glancing down miserably at the new blue suit I had put on so hopefully {{for the first time that}} afternoon.|$|E
6000|$|... “It {{must have}} been the conditions,” she said; but I knew she was wrong, and <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> {{likewise}} knew. Then the wind came, fair and fresh, and the boat was soon labouring through a heavy sea toward the island. At half-past three in the afternoon we passed the south-western promontory. Not only were we hungry, but we were now suffering from thirst. Our lips were dry and cracked, nor could we longer moisten them with our tongues. Then the wind slowly died down. By night it was dead calm and I was toiling once more at the oars—but weakly, most weakly. At two in the morning the boat’s bow touched the beach of our own inner cove and I staggered out to make the painter fast. Maud could not stand, nor had I strength to carry her. I fell in the sand with her, and, when I had recovered, contented myself with putting my hands under her shoulders and dragging her up the beach to the hut.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sarah, {{come and}} {{sleep with me}} in the nursery; I daren't for my life be alone with that poor child to-night: she might die; it's such a strange thing she should have that fit: <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> saw anything. Missis was rather too hard." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'She seemed mighty {{careful about}} how she slipped out of those bushes,' thought Mr. Bob-cat. 'She acted as <b>if</b> <b>she</b> didn't want to be seen. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> why. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> has a secret hidden in those bushes. I suppose the {{way to find out}} is to look.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Those {{two sisters}} are {{specimens}} of fast and slow growth. Laura {{has always seemed}} to be so much more than one year older than Amy, especially of late. She is more like five-and-twenty than twenty. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> overworks herself. But how we have lingered over our dinner!' ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Van Busche Taylor was a {{very thin}} man with a large, bald head, bony and shining; and under the great dome of his skull his face, yellow, with deep lines in it, looked very small. He was quiet and {{exceedingly}} polite. He spoke with the accent of New England, and there was about his demeanour a bloodless frigidity which made me ask myself why on earth he was busying himself with Charles Strickland. I had been slightly tickled at the gentleness which Mrs. Strickland put into her mention of her husband's name, and while the pair conversed I took stock of the room in which we sat. Mrs. Strickland had moved with the times. Gone were the Morris papers and gone the severe cretonnes, gone were the Arundel prints that had adorned the walls of her drawing-room in Ashley Gardens; the room blazed with fantastic colour, and <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> knew that those varied hues, which fashion had imposed upon her, were due to the dreams of a poor painter in a South Sea island. She gave me the answer herself.|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, no, at a restaurant. Where has Jemima put my boots? <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> has cleaned them. I {{can never}} tell by looking. Here they are. And my coat? Anything I {{can get you}} in town? Well, good-bye, dear, good-bye!' Maude {{had never seen him}} make so hurried an exit.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> Mrs. Rennie {{is really}} as {{handsome}} as Mrs. Burnett says. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> how old <b>she</b> is. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> ever cared for Sidney ... no, she didn't. No woman who cared for Sidney {{could ever have}} thrown him over for an old moneybag. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> shall like her. No, I won't. I'm sure I shan't like her.|$|R
6000|$|Carol assured herself, [...] "Whatever faults I may have, I {{certainly}} couldn't ever be jealous. I do like Maud; she's {{always so}} pleasant. But <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> isn't {{just a bit}} fond of fishing for men's sympathy? Playing with Erik, and her married----Well----But {{she looks at him}} in that languishing, swooning, mid-Victorian way. Disgusting!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But Charlotte," [...] {{continued}} Coggan--"not {{a word of}} {{the sort}} would Charlotte allow, nor the smallest item of taking in vain.... Ay, poor Charlotte, <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> {{had the good fortune}} to get into Heaven when 'a died! But 'a was never much in luck's way, and perhaps 'a went downwards after all, poor soul." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Immortal powers!" [...] cried Roderick, [...] "what a vision! In {{the name}} of transcendent perfection, who is she?" [...] He sprang up and stood looking after her until she rounded a turn in the avenue. [...] "What a movement, what a manner, what a poise of the head! <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> would sit to me." ...|$|R
