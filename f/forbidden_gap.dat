40|$|We {{report on}} the {{proposal}} and experimental realization of a spoof surface plasmon Fabry-Perot (FP) open resonator in a surface-wave photonic crystal. This surface-wave FP open resonator is formed by introducing a finite line defect in a surface-wave photonic crystal. The resonance frequencies of the surface-wave FP open resonator lie exactly within the <b>forbidden</b> band <b>gap</b> of the surface-wave photonic crystal and the FP open resonator uses this complete <b>forbidden</b> band <b>gap</b> to concentrate surface waves within a subwavelength cavity. Due to the complete <b>forbidden</b> band <b>gap</b> of the surface-wave photonic crystal, a new FP plasmonic resonance mode that exhibits monopolar features which is missing in traditional FP resonators and plasmonic resonators is demonstrated. Near-field response spectra and mode profiles are presented in the microwave regime to characterize properties of the proposed FP open resonator for spoof surface plasmons...|$|R

40|$|In {{developing}} {{strategies of}} manipulating surface electromagnetic waves, {{it has been}} recently recognized that a complete <b>forbidden</b> band <b>gap</b> can exist in a periodic surface-wave photonic crystal, which has subsequently produced various surface-wave photonic devices. However, it is not obvious whether such a concept can be extended to a non-periodic surface-wave system that lacks translational symmetry. Here we experimentally demonstrate that a surface-wave photonic quasicrystal that lacks periodicity can also exhibit a <b>forbidden</b> band <b>gap</b> for surface electromagnetic waves. The lower cutoff of this <b>forbidden</b> band <b>gap</b> is mainly determined by the maximum separation between nearest neighboring pillars. Point defects within this band gap show distinct properties compared to a periodic photonic crystal {{for the absence of}} translational symmetry. A line-defect waveguide, which is crafted out of this surface-wave photonic quasicrystal by shortening a random row of metallic rods, is also demonstrated to guide and bend surface waves around sharp corners along an irregular waveguiding path...|$|R

It becomes {{an essential part of}} the band structure of their energy spectrum.

50|$|Electrons in bulk {{dielectric}} material (larger than 10 nm) {{can be described}} by energy bands or electron energy levels. Electrons exist at different energy levels or bands. In bulk materials these energy levels are described as continuous because the difference in energy is negligible. As electrons stabilise at various energy levels, most vibrate in valence bands below a forbidden energy level, named the band gap. This region is an energy range in where no electron states exist. A smaller amount have energy levels above the <b>forbidden</b> <b>gap,</b> {{and this is the}} conduction band.|$|E
50|$|The {{scintillation}} {{process in}} inorganic materials {{is due to}} the electronic band structure found in crystals and is not molecular in nature {{as is the case with}} organic scintillators. An incoming particle can excite an electron from the valence band to either the conduction band or the exciton band (located just below the conduction band and separated from the valence band by an energy gap; see picture). This leaves an associated hole behind, in the valence band. Impurities create electronic levels in the <b>forbidden</b> <b>gap.</b> The excitons are loosely bound electron-hole pairs which wander through the crystal lattice until they are captured as a whole by impurity centers. The latter then rapidly de-excite by emitting scintillation light (fast component). The activator impurities are typically chosen so that the emitted light is in the visible range or near-UV where photomultipliers are effective. The holes associated with electrons in the conduction band are independent from the latter. Those holes and electrons are captured successively by impurity centers exciting certain metastable states not accessible to the excitons. The delayed de-excitation of those metastable impurity states again results in scintillation light (slow component).|$|E

40|$|We have {{theoretically}} {{investigated the}} electronic resonant tunneling effect in graphene superlattice heterostructures, where a tunable graphene layer is inserted between two different superlattices. It is {{found that a}} complete tunneling state appears inside the enlarged <b>forbidden</b> <b>gap</b> of the heterostructure by changing {{the thickness of the}} inserted graphene layer and the transmittance of the tunneling state depends on the thickness of the inserted layer. Furthermore, the frequency of the tunneling state changes with the thickness of the inserted graphene layer but it always located in the little overlapped <b>forbidden</b> <b>gap</b> of two graphene superlattices. Therefore, both a perfect tunneling state and an ultrawide <b>forbidden</b> <b>gap</b> are realized in such heterostrutures. Since maximum probability densities of the perfect tunneling state are highly localized near the interface between the inserted graphene layer and one graphene superlattice, it can be named as an interface-like state.
