5|$|Because of the {{popularity}} of the novel, Gatiss felt a greater responsibility to include familiar <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> story than he did when adapting the lesser-known stories. The script was intended to follow <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> horror genre and make the episode scary. As opposed to traditional ghost stories, Gatiss's plot focused on more contemporary horrors, conspiracy theories and genetic modification. Filming was done throughout May 2011, with additional shots taking place as late as August. Location shooting took place mostly across South Wales, though parts were shot in Dartmoor. The hound was created using visual effects.|$|E
