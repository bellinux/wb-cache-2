40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the changes in}} the legal framework regarding succession issue. These changes have been examined in light of three hypotheses arising from the former Civil Code. The distinction between judiciary debarring and lawful debarring introduced by the New Civil Code from 2009 is also presented. The conditions for cancelling the effects of <b>debarring</b> <b>from</b> <b>succession</b> stipulated by the New Civil Code are explained. Finally, several legal circumstances for declaring a person unworthy of succession are comparatively presented...|$|R
50|$|Prince Michael's {{marriage}} to a Roman Catholic <b>debarred</b> him <b>from</b> <b>succession</b> to the British throne under {{the provisions of the}} Act of Settlement 1701. This was reversed by the Succession to the Crown Act 2013, which removed the disqualification of those who marry Roman Catholics. Gabriella (like her brother Frederick) was brought up in the Church of England and consequently retains her place in the line of succession.|$|R
50|$|Prince Michael's {{marriage}} to a Roman Catholic <b>debarred</b> him <b>from</b> <b>succession</b> to the thrones of the Commonwealth realms under {{the provisions of the}} Act of Settlement 1701, until he was reinstated with the coming into force of the Succession to the Crown Act 2013 which removed the disqualification of those who marry Roman Catholics. Lord Frederick and Lady Gabriella were brought up in the Church of England, thus both keeping their places in the line of succession.|$|R
50|$|Although four of Ethelred’s {{brothers}} (both {{older and}} younger) were kings of Scotland, Etheldred was <b>debarred</b> <b>from</b> the <b>succession</b> for reasons unknown. His older half-brother was King Duncan II of Scotland (the son of Malcolm III's first wife, Ingibiorg Finnsdottir). He reigned from May 1094 to 12 November 1094. Of his full brothers (the sons of Margaret), Edgar reigned from 1097 to 1107; Alexander I, from 1107 to 1124; and David I, from 1124 to 1153. Another brother, Edward, died alongside {{his father at}} the Battle of Alnwick in Northumberland in 1093. His brother Edmund became a monk.|$|R
25|$|By {{the end of}} 1811, King George III was mad and, {{although}} still King in name, his heir-apparent and eldest son George was Prince Regent. On 6 November 1817 the Prince Regent's only daughter, Princess Charlotte, wife of Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld (later King Leopold I of the Belgians), died in childbirth. Princess Charlotte was second in line to the throne: had she outlived her father and grandfather, she would have become Queen. With her death, the King was left with twelve children and no legitimate grandchildren. The Prince Regent was estranged from his wife, who was forty-nine years-old, thus there was little likelihood {{that he would have}} any further legitimate children. To secure the line of succession, Prince William, Duke of Clarence, and the other sons of George III sought quick marriages with the intent of producing offspring who could inherit the throne. William already had ten children by the popular actress Dorothea Jordan, but, being illegitimate, they were <b>debarred</b> <b>from</b> the <b>succession.</b>|$|R
5|$|Lancastrian cognatic {{descent from}} John of Gaunt and Blanche's {{daughter}} Phillipa {{continued in the}} royal houses of Spain and Portugal. The remnants of the Lancastrian court party coalesced support around Henry Tudora relatively unknown scion of the Beauforts. They had been amongst the most ardent supporters of the House of Lancaster and were descended illegitimately from John of Gaunt by his mistress Katherine Swynford. However John of Gaunt and Katherine subsequently married and their children were legitimated by the Pope and by Parliament {{during the reign of}} Richard II. Henry IV had tried to <b>debar</b> them <b>from</b> the <b>succession</b> by use of his royal prerogative to avoid competition with the House of Lancaster’s claims to the throne but this was of limited effect. By some calculations of primogeniture, there were as many as 18 peopleincluding both his mother and future wifewith what some might claim a better right to the throne. By 1510, this figure had increased with the birth of an additional 16 possible Yorkist claimants.|$|R
