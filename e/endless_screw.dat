50|$|Samuel Rhee {{developed}} his own <b>endless</b> <b>screw</b> cutting machine {{and was able}} to sell machines to others. His screws were considered the finest available at the time.|$|E
5000|$|The Ictineo II was 14 m long, 2 m wide, and 3 m high. Her {{displacement}} was 46 tonnes and her interior {{volume was}} [...] She was built of olive wood with oak reinforcements, and a 2 mm {{thick layer of}} copper. Her upper side had a deck 1.3 m wide and a hatch with three glazed portholes 200 mm in diameter and 100 mm thick glass blocks. The submarine could be steered from the conning tower {{by means of an}} <b>endless</b> <b>screw</b> gear.|$|E
5000|$|A {{discussion}} of equatorial instruments published in 1793 said that Sisson was {{the inventor of}} the modern version of that instrument, which had been incorrectly attributed to Mr Short. Sisson made his first equatorial instrument of this design for Archibald, Lord Ilay, and it was now held by the college at Aberdeen. The instrument was [...] "very elegantly constructed", with an azimuth circle about 2 ft across. Mr Short ordered Sisson's son Jeremiah to add reflecting telescopes to the instruments and to use <b>endless</b> <b>screws</b> to move the circles,but this design proved inferior to Jonathon Sisson's original.|$|R
50|$|The {{slewing drive}} is a modernized {{take on the}} worm drive {{mechanism}} that dates back many centuries and was widely used during the Renaissance Era. Pappus of Alexandria (3rd century AD), a Greek mathematician is credited for {{an early version of}} the <b>endless</b> <b>screw,</b> which would later evolve into the worm drive. This mechanism was also used by Leonardo da Vinci as a component in many of his designs for machines. It can also be found in the notebooks of Francesco di Giorgio of Siena. Many slewing drive concepts found prominence with the emergence of larger scale construction and engineering in the height of the Greek and Roman Empires.|$|E
5000|$|The {{strip of}} land between the {{hospital}} and the creek is occupied by the former Haslar Gunboat Yard, opened in 1856 to house the Royal Navy's coastal gunboats. A single patent slip was used to launch the boats into Haslar Creek, and to haul them out again on a cradle which ran on railway tracks; a locomotive-driven traverser then delivered the boat (still in its cradle) to {{its place in the}} row of cast iron boat sheds (ten of which still stand, parallel to the creek - at one time there were fifty in total). A small stationary steam engine mounted on the traverser platform drove an <b>endless</b> <b>screw,</b> which was then used to slide the boat back into its shed.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is the {{comparison}} of three different power plants employing renewable energy sources available in the Piedmont Region (North-West of Italy), {{by means of the}} following technologies: a mini-hydro with Archimedes' screw, a wind-turbines and a photovoltaic system with solar cells. According to the project requirements, for each of three solutions, the most suitable site was found in the Piedmont region of Italy. The mini-hydro, <b>endless</b> <b>screw</b> with asynchronous reversible generator, has been installed in a small irrigation channel near the city of Novara, where the cultivation of rice needs considerable quantities of water throughout the year. With the nominal power of the mini-hydro of 150 kW the total electric energy produced in an year results from the calculation of about 750, 000 kWh. As far as the wind turbines are concerned, thanks the anemometric investigation performed by ARPA (Environmental Protection Agency in Piedmont), the most useful place resulted the Colle S. Bernardo, located between Piedmont and Ligurian Riviera at 980 m of altitude. Using the PGIS (Photovoltaic Geographical Information System), for solar cells, the best site in Piedmont, resulted instead a place in south-west of Piedmont, near the city of Cuneo. As previously said, because the total amount of electric energy has been assumed for the comparison of about 750, 000 kWh, as consequence these two last solutions present different nominal power. In particular: power of 100 kW for three wind wheels and of 60 kW for one wind wheel (total power 360 kW); power of 550 kW (of peak) for solar cells. After estimating the investment costs, the operating costs and the renewable energy production incentives of the three power plants, the payback has been also evaluated for each solution. From the economical assessment that was carried out through the Net Present Value, the hydroelectric plant resulted the most profitable solutio...|$|E
