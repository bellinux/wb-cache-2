5|$|Belle Vue was {{the first}} privately financed zoo in England, and grew to become the third-largest in the UK. Jennison's {{original}} idea was that the gardens should be primarily a botanical excursion, but <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> public {{was interested in the}} animals as an attraction in their own right. The initial collection had consisted of domestic birds and a few exotic parrots, but Jennison probably also acquired those animals that could not be sold after the Manchester Zoological Gardens closed in 1842. By 1856, the Jennisons had added kangaroos, rhinos, lions, bears and gazelles.|$|E
5|$|Concorde's Air Intake Control Units (AICUs) {{made use}} of a digital {{processor}} to provide the necessary accuracy for intake control. It was the world's first use of a digital processor to be given full authority control of an essential system in a passenger aircraft.

5|$|In {{the months}} that followed, {{scientists}} and doctors studied the smog's impact. <b>It</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> smog had been a major environmental disaster with severe public health effects. One study estimated that 10 percent of the city's population suffered adverse health effects, such as stinging eyes, coughing, and respiratory distress. City health officials initially maintained that the smog had not caused any deaths. Later, a statistical analysis found that 168 people had likely died because of the smog. Another {{study found that the}} smog had shortened the lifespans of 366 people.|$|E

5|$|The LPF formed {{part of a}} {{coalition}} government with the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) and the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD), but internal conflicts in the LPF led to the coalition's break-up and fresh elections after a few months. Following the 2003 election, the party was left in opposition. <b>It</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> party was not viable without its original leader, and it went into decline until it was finally dissolved in 2008.|$|E
5|$|The N1s {{compared}} favourably {{with the}} Nclass, although the type showed little improvement in performance. More {{of the class}} were built when <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> type's smaller cylinders provided greater route availability. A total of six engines were built. The N1class was primarily used on the Eastern section of the Southern Railway network, and used by the Southern Region of British Railways (BR) from 1948. The N1s gave valuable service until they were withdrawn in 1962. None were preserved.|$|E
5|$|The first {{parliamentary}} elections after independence were held on 27 February and 8 March 1958. The {{result was a}} victory for Abd al-Rahman's Umma Party, which won 63 of the 173 seats. The Southern Sudan Federal Party competed in the election, and won 40 of the 46 seats allocated to the southern provinces. The Federal party platform represented a serious challenge to the authorities. However, when <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> party's demands for a federal structure would be ignored by the Constituent Assembly, on 16 June 1958 the southern MPs left parliament.|$|E

5|$|A {{series of}} air raids were mounted against Bardia in December, {{in the hope}} of persuading the {{garrison}} to withdraw. Once <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Italians intended to stand and fight, bombing priorities shifted to the Italian airbases around Tobruk, Derna and Benina. Air raids on Bardia resumed in the lead-up to the ground assault, with 100 bombing sorties flown against Bardia between 31 December 1940 and 2 January 1941, climaxing with a particularly heavy raid by Vickers Wellington bombers of No. 70 Squadron RAF and Bristol Bombay bombers of No. 216 Squadron RAF on the night of 2/3 January 1941. Lysanders of No. 208 Squadron RAF directed the artillery fire. Fighters from No. 33 Squadron RAF, No. 73 Squadron RAF and No. 274 Squadron RAF patrolled between Bardia and Tobruk.|$|E
5|$|Among those {{determined}} that London {{should have a}} permanent orchestra of similar excellence were Sir John Reith, director-general of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), and the conductor Sir Thomas Beecham. In 1928 they opened discussions about jointly setting up such an ensemble, but after 18 months of negotiations <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> corporation and the conductor had irreconcilable priorities. Beecham demanded more personal control of the orchestra and repertoire than the BBC was willing to concede, and his priorities were the opera house and the concert hall rather than the broadcasting studio. The BBC went ahead without him, and under its director of music, Adrian Boult, launched the BBC Symphony Orchestra in October 1930, to immense acclaim.|$|E

5|$|Financing of {{the arena}} project was difficult. Terrace had four {{financing}} deals fail. As <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Senators could not finance a needed highway interchange without government backing, the Government of Ontario was persuaded successfully to provide a $27 million loan for the highway interchange construction. In the end, the firm of Ogden Entertainment, a New York City facilities management firm, backed the project with a $20 million loan {{in exchange for a}} 30-year contract to manage the facility. In addition, American banks loaned $110 million, the federal government gave the Senators $6 million, $10 million from Terrace and $15 million from a Canadian pension fund.|$|E
5|$|Grenville and the G class {{spent the}} bulk of their time before the start of World War II {{assigned}} to the 1st Destroyer Flotilla (DF) in the Mediterranean Fleet, where they made a number of neutrality patrols during the Spanish Civil War of 1936–39. With the exception of Garland which was under repair at Malta after a premature explosion of her depth charges, they returned home in October–November after <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Italians would not enter the war. Hardy and the H-class ships were assigned to the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla and joined the Gs in the Mediterranean after commissioning for similar duties.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{inclement weather}} also {{hampered}} the Americans' advance, and until May 15 the recapturing forces were unsure {{of whether the}} Japanese had held their position or retreated. When the fog lifted on that day, <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Japanese had retreated further west. However, when the American forces gave chase, they were immediately slowed by an accidental air strike upon them by an American aircraft. By May 29, the Japanese forces numbered only 700–1,000, and these troops attempted to run through the advancing American forces as a last show of defiance against the recapturing forces. By May 30, the Americans had recaptured Attu, and although a few small pockets of Japanese troops remained on the island, the Battle of Attu had essentially concluded.|$|E

5|$|Huggins {{continued}} {{to tinker with}} his roster during the offseason. He traded Dugan, Mike Gazella, Rosy Ryan and Pat Collins, and acquired Lyn Lary from the Pacific Coast League. He tried Lary at third base and Leo Durocher at shortstop, while he attempted to acquire George Uhle and Ed Morris, but was unsuccessful in both cases. The Yankees fell behind the Philadelphia Athletics in the standings during the 1929 season and as <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Yankees would not win the AL pennant in 1929, Huggins began consulting with coaches Art Fletcher and Bob Shawkey {{about the future of}} the team, including how to replace Bob Meusel in left field. However, by August 1929 Huggins began losing weight and complained of feeling ill.|$|E
5|$|Imperator Aleksandr III and {{the other}} ships of the {{division}} briefly followed Knyaz Suvorov until <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> latter ship {{was out of control}} and then turned north {{in an effort to get}} behind Tōgō's ships. Knyaz Suvorov never regained her position in the battle line and became the primary target of the Japanese for a time. Around 16:00 the captain of Imperator Alexandr III, Nikolai Bukhvostov, decided to duplicate 's maneuver at the Battle of the Yellow Sea by charging straight for the Japanese battleline in an attempt to focus their attention on his ship rather than Knyaz Suvorov. He was successful, but Imperator Aleksandr III was badly damaged in the process. Borodino now assumed the lead position and turned the fleet to the south where they temporarily managed to disengage in the mist and fog.|$|E
5|$|In 1970, the Nassau–Suffolk Regional Planning Board {{brought up}} plans to convert CR78 into a six-lane {{expressway}} with new service roads. A similar project was {{planned for the}} nearby four-lane NY347 through Islip. To aid this, ownership and maintenance of CR78 {{was transferred to the}} New York State Department of Transportation on March29, 1972, receiving the designation of NY454. The state immediately expanded NY454 to six lanes, with three in each direction from Holbrook to the terminus of NY347. In 1977, the state designated the portion of the highway in Hauppague as both NY454 and NY347 after <b>it</b> <b>became</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Hauppauge Spur of the Long Island Expressway would not be constructed. The plans to expand NY454 and NY347 into full-blown freeways were discarded by the 1980s.|$|E
