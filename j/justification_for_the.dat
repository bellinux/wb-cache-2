5|$|According to {{historian}} Thomas Paul, Tipu {{shifted his}} hatred for the British to the Mangalorean Catholics and other South Indian Christian communities.

5|$|A common <b>justification</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{need for}} {{astronomy}} {{is the need}} to develop an accurate calendar for agricultural reasons. Ancient texts like Hesiod's Works and Days, an ancient farming manual, would appear to contradict this. Instead astronomical observations are used in combination with ecological signs, such as bird migrations to determine the seasons. Ethnoastronomical work with the Mursi of Ethiopia shows that haphazard astronomy continued until recent times {{in some parts of the}} world. All the same, calendars appear to be an almost universal phenomenon in societies as they provide tools for the regulation of communal activities.|$|E
5|$|As of 2016, the {{black-necked grebe}} is {{classified}} as least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The trend {{of the population is}} uncertain, as some populations are decreasing, whereas others are stable, have an uncertain trend, or are increasing. The <b>justification</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> current classification of this species is its very large population (estimated around 3.9–4.2 million individuals) combined with a large estimated extent of occurrence (about 155 million km2 (60 million sq mi)). This grebe is probably the most numerous grebe in the world.|$|E
5|$|What {{is today}} Route31 was {{defined in the}} 1927 New Jersey state highway {{renumbering}} as Route30, a highway that began in Trenton and ended in Buttzville. In the 1953 renumbering, Route30 was renumbered as Route69, as the number conflicted with US30 in southern New Jersey. The bypass of Ringoes, shared with US202, opened in the1960s. Due to the sexual meaning of the number and resulting sign theft, Route69 was changed in1967 to Route31 once all the signs were removed. The <b>justification</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> removal was that people were stealing signs as a trophy for dorm rooms because of their interest in the number69.|$|E

5|$|For {{its part}} the government, not {{consulting}} Solidarity, adopted {{a plan of}} economic measures {{that could only be}} implemented by force and asked parliament for extraordinary authority. In early December, Jaruzelski was pressured by his generals and colonels for an immediate forceful action and their demands were repeated at the Politburo meeting on 10 December. On 11 and 12 December Solidarity's National Commission declared 17 December the day of countrywide protest. Neither the exhausted but radicalized Solidarity nor the ruling establishment was willing or able to back down and, in the era of Brezhnev, there could be no peaceful resolution to the situation that developed. The Soviets now expressed a preference for the conflict to be resolved by the Polish authorities, but Poland, according to Karol Modzelewski, was lucky to avoid a carnage of foreign intervention. Others, including the historian Antoni Dudek, feel that there was no sufficient <b>justification</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> imposition of martial law that followed.|$|E
5|$|The {{expedition}} quickly {{descended into}} a debacle. Aristagoras fell out with Megabates {{on the journey}} towards Naxos, and Herodotus says that Megabates then sent messengers to Naxos, warning the Naxians of the force's intention. It is also possible, however, that this story was spread by Aristagoras after the event, {{by way of a}} <b>justification</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> subsequent failure of the campaign. At any rate, the Naxians were able to prepare properly for a siege, and the Persians arrived to a well-defended expedition. The Persians laid siege to the Naxians for four months, but eventually they and Aristagoras both ran out of money. The force sailed back to the mainland without a victory.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> {{original}} <b>justifications</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{oppression of}} both African–Americans in the United States and Dalits in India {{were drawn from}} the religious systems of thought of both societies.

5|$|The <b>justification</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{closure of}} Loring {{was that the}} Air Force had six more {{strategic}} bases than were needed to support the number of bomber and tanker aircraft in the Defense Department's Structure Plan. The base was evaluated against eight selection criteria {{and a large number}} of subelements specific to Air Force bases and missions. Even though Loring was in good condition and had strong community support, it ranked low in the criteria when compared to twenty other bases in the strategic category. One of the things that hurt Loring was its limited peacetime value as a tanker base, as well as its distance from bombing ranges. The commission did note that the facilities at Loring were above average, and the cost to close Loring would be low, the latter of which contributed to its closure.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} <b>justification</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> GRC {{scheme is}} to entrench minority representation in Parliament. However, opposition parties {{have questioned the}} usefulness of GRCs in fulfilling this purpose, especially since Singapore has not faced the issue of minorities being under-represented in Parliament. In fact, statistics show that all PAP minority candidates have won regularly {{and that the only}} two MPs to lose their seats in 1984 were Chinese. One of them was beaten by a minority candidate. In addition, Joshua Benjamin Jeyaratnam of the Workers' Party of Singapore won a by-election in 1981 at Anson, a largely Chinese constituency, and the first elected Chief Minister of Singapore was David Marshall who was Jewish. Technically, as the size of GRCs has increased, the minority has had less representation overall as the proportion of minority MPs per GRC has been reduced. Since minority MPs are a numerical minority in Parliament, their political clout has also been reduced.|$|E
5|$|For example, Avicenna gives a {{philosophical}} <b>justification</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Islamic doctrine of tawhid (oneness of God) by showing the uniqueness and {{simplicity of the}} necessary existent. He argues that the necessary existent must be unique, using a proof by contradiction, or reductio, showing that a contradiction would follow if one supposes {{that there were more}} than one necessary existent. If one postulates two necessary existents, A and B, a simplified version of the argument considers two possibilities: if A is distinct from B as a result of something implied from necessity of existence, then B would share it, too (being a necessary existent itself), and the two are not distinct after all. If, on the other hand, the distinction resulted from something not implied by necessity of existence, then this individuating factor will be a cause for A, and this means that A has a cause and is not a necessary existent after all. Either way, the opposite proposition resulted in contradiction, which to Avicenna proves the correctness of the argument. Avicenna argued that the necessary existent must be simple (not a composite) by a similar reductio strategy. If it were a composite, its internal parts would need a feature that distinguishes each from the others. The distinguishing feature cannot be solely derived from the parts' necessity of existence, because then they would both have the same feature and not be distinct: a contradiction. But it also cannot be accidental, or requiring an outside cause, because this would contradict its necessity of existence.|$|E

5|$|The first {{recorded}} works of Shakespeare are Richard III {{and the three}} parts of Henry VI, written in the early 1590s during a vogue for historical drama. Shakespeare's plays are difficult to date precisely, however, and studies of the texts suggest that Titus Andronicus, The Comedy of Errors, The Taming of the Shrew, and The Two Gentlemen of Verona may also belong to Shakespeare's earliest period. His first histories, which draw heavily on the 1587 edition of Raphael Holinshed's Chronicles of England, Scotland, and Ireland, dramatise the destructive results of weak or corrupt rule and have been interpreted as a <b>justification</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> origins of the Tudor dynasty. The early plays were influenced by the works of other Elizabethan dramatists, especially Thomas Kyd and Christopher Marlowe, by the traditions of medieval drama, and by the plays of Seneca. The Comedy of Errors was also based on classical models, but no source for The Taming of the Shrew has been found, though it is related to a separate play {{of the same name}} and may have derived from a folk story. Like The Two Gentlemen of Verona, in which two friends appear to approve of rape, the Shrew's story of the taming of a woman's independent spirit by a man sometimes troubles modern critics and directors.|$|E
