A fishing port is the only port that depends on an ocean product, and depletion of fish may cause a fishing port to be uneconomical.

50|$|This {{species of}} pelican has {{declined}} greatly throughout its range, {{more so than}} the white pelican. It is possible that up to 10,000-20,000 pelicans exist at the species level. Reportedly, there were once millions of Dalmatian pelicans in Romania alone. During the 20th century, the species' numbers underwent a dramatic decline for reasons that are not entirely understood. The most likely reason was habitat loss due to human activities such as the drainage of wetlands and land development. Colonies are regularly disturbed by human activity, and, like all pelicans, the parents may temporarily leave their nest if threatened, which then exposes the chicks to the risk of predation. Occasionally, Dalmatian pelicans may be shot by fishermen who believe the birds are dangerously depleting the fish population and hence threatening their livelihood. While such killings are generally on a small scale, the worry that these pelicans over-exploit the <b>fishing</b> <b>stock</b> persists in many locales. Another probable reason for the decline in the species' population is poaching. In Mongolia, the local people clandestinely kill these pelicans to use or sell their bills as pouches. On a typical day in a commercial Mongolian marketplace, as many as fifty pelican bills may be on offer for sale, and they are considered such a rare prize that ten horses and thirty sheep are considered a fair price to trade for a single pelican. Due to exploitation at all stages of the life cycle, the species is critically endangered in its Mongolian range, with a total population of fewer than 130 individual birds. Dalmatian pelicans also regularly fly into power-lines and are killed by electrocution. In Greece, pelicans are often so disturbed by power boats, usually ones bearing tourists—that they become unable to feed and die of malnourishment. In 1994 in Europe there were over a thousand breeding pairs, most of them in Greece, but also in Ukraine, Macedonia, Romania, Bulgaria (Srebarna Nature Reserve) and Albania (Karavasta Lagoon). They have been considered extinct in Croatia since the 1950s, although a single Dalmatian pelican was observed there in 2011. The largest single remaining colony is at Small Prespa Lake (shared between Albania and Greece), with around 1,400 pairs, with approximately 450 pairs left in the Danube Delta. The country with the largest breeding population today, including about 70% of pairs or possibly over 3,000 pairs, is Russia. Worldwide, there are an estimated 3,000-5,000 breeding pairs.

Judicious management and exploitation of the renewable fish resources is important for sustained production over years. Over fishing leads to disappearance of the renewable <b>fish</b> <b>stocks.</b> Assessment of <b>fish</b> <b>stocks</b> is the first step to determine the level of exploitation necessary for arriving at maximum sustainable yields from the fish resources. Assessment of stocks and study of impact of present level of exploitation on exploited stocks are necessary for maintenance of stocks at maximum sustainable level.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this research article is to identify and examine the economic dimension of producing and consuming fish in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The period 1980 - 97 was denoted to be the study period of this paper. Some of the study results could be summarized as follows: (1) 98. 2 % of the fishing boats in the Red Sea and Arabian Gulf areas {{is found to be}} of the traditional type. Whereas, only 1. 85 % represents the percentage of advanced and automated boats, for the period 1988 - 97. (2) 73. 66 % of the average total number of fishing boats is concentrated in the Red Sea fisheries. The rest is found to work within the Arabian Gulf fisheries, for the same above study period 1988 - 97. (3) Traditional boats in the Red Sea and Arabian Gulf areas represent the major means of production in the Kingdom. Its corresponding average production is estimated at nearly 76. 41 % of the average total fish production, which is estimated at 48. 84 thousand tons. Advanced automated boats, on the other hand, occupy second place, where its average production is estimated at 17. 42 % of the average total fish production, for the same above study period 1988 - 97. (4) Average productivity of fishermen and boats in the Red Sea area and the Arabian Gulf area is found to be slightly deteriorating. This could be due to overfishing, in addition to some imbalances in the <b>fishing</b> <b>stock</b> of these fisheries. (5) The number of fishing boats and technological advancements are found {{to be the most important}} factors affecting fish production. On the other hand, the estimated fish production, the average fish retail prices, and national income are the most prominent factors determining fish consumption for the period 1980 - 97. (6) It is anticipated that fish production would decline from 50. 55 thousand tons in 1999 to 48. 65 thousand tons by the year 2005. Consumption, on the other hand, is anticipated to decline from 96. 29 thousand tons in 1999 to 90. 50 thousand ton by the year 2005. This implies that the self-sufficiency ratio of fish will barely increase from 52. 49 % in 1999 to 53. 76 % in 2005. Accordingly, the study recommends that there is a great need for developing the fishing boats for the purpose of overcoming the problems of overfishing and the depletion of the <b>fishing</b> <b>stock</b> in the areas of the Red Sea and the Arabian Gulf...|$|E

In order to assess and predict the availability of the fish stock under different fishing efforts, the simulator allows the user to specify fishing mortality rates (F) on a monthly basis. We simulated the following scenarios for a period of 10 years (120 months). : - Virgin Stock (F= 0) : the stock of common sole is not affected by fishing activities. This represents a sort of null model that indicates the ideal population dynamics; - moderate fishing effort F= 0. 2; overfishing F= 1. 2); - Optimal period of fishery closure: we simulated different periods of fishing ban for investigating the optimal policies that has the minimum impact on fish stock; - Recovery after overfishing: with this scenario we calculated the time that the fish stock takes to reach sustainable levels, after simulating a period of strong fishing effort; In addition the simulator has been integrated with SURBA (SURvey-Based Assessments) [2], a well- established model in the context of marine biology, in order to validate our model.

40|$|AbstractMost of the <b>fish</b> <b>stocks</b> in the world, {{including}} European <b>fish</b> <b>stocks,</b> {{are threatened}} by overfishing and/or degraded environmental conditions. Although the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) is the main policy instrument managing <b>fish</b> <b>stocks</b> in Europe, there is continued concern as to whether commercial <b>fish</b> <b>stocks</b> will achieve Good Environmental Status (GEnS) in 2020 {{in accordance with the}} Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD). In this context, the evaluation of the status of <b>fish</b> <b>stocks</b> in the subareas of FAO fishing area 27 was carried out using mean trophic levels (MTL) in fish landings and spawning stock biomass (SSB). Comparisons were made before and after 2008 to establish whether the trend is positive or negative. The main data sources for landings and SSB were the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) advisory reports. MTLs in landing and SSB were determined for each subarea and the subareas were categorized into four groups, according to MTLs after 2008. The first group (subareas I + II, V) had higher MTL in landings and higher MTL in SSB after 2008. Therefore, fisheries in these subareas appear sustainable. The second group was subareas VIII + IX, for which the <b>fish</b> <b>stocks</b> have higher MTL in landings but low MTL in SSB, indicating that SSB was being overfished. The third was subarea (VI), where <b>fish</b> <b>stocks</b> have lower MTL in landings than those in SSB after 2008, which may indicate that <b>fish</b> <b>stocks</b> are recovering. <b>Fish</b> <b>stocks</b> in the fourth group (subareas III, IV and VII) had low MTL in landings and the MTL in SSB was lower than that of landings before 2008. This may be due to heavy fishing. In addition, we estimated the harvest rate (HR) of the <b>fish</b> <b>stocks</b> before and after 2008. The results showed that most of the <b>fish</b> <b>stocks</b> have lower HR after 2008, indicating that the status has improved, perhaps due to improvements in the implementation of CFP. However, some <b>fish</b> <b>stocks</b> showed high HR even after 2008, so that new management options are still needed.

The model is also extended with 3 D spatial information, giving rise to two different spatial scales: a micro-scale describing in an individual-based approach the behavior of fish in a square kilometer of sea, according to the above-mentioned features; and a macro-scale that considers the Adriatic Sea as a discrete grid where each single cell represents a model at the micro-scale. This multiscale model can help to understand (at the micro-scale) the spatial dynamics of fish stocks over large areas, considering the migration through the fish life-cycle.

40|$|Once proud fishing {{villages in}} the North of Scotland used to be lively and industrious {{gateways}} to the ocean {{for much of the}} country’s population. Modernisation and industrialisation of the fishing industry has seen a depletion of not only <b>fishing</b> <b>stock</b> but also a sense of identity that accompanied these historic coastal settlements (Scottish Government “Socio-Economic Briefing on Rural Scotland”). Balintore is a powerful example of this issue, where an ageing population has a disconnection from their distinct cultural identity (Brookfield 6). The settlement now has {{less than one percent of}} its population employed in the fishing industry (Streetcheck). This thesis will explore how identity can be revitalised with reference to the fishing industry and grounded with the unique characteristics of Balintore, such as landscape types, cultural tradition, climate conditions and architecture. An aquaculural insertion to the site will act as a driver to feasibly revitalise the struggling economy and allow explorations into how an experience with the product can create place identity, alluding to fishing industry history. The experience of place aims to portray unique characteristics of the site, cultural traditions and an engagement with the product which associates a contextual relationship between the two. The landscape of Scotland is intrinsically tied to the cultural identity and therefore the sense of place which people possess (Robertson 154). The fact that the identity in question is fundamentally based on a spatial relation, despite having cultural, social and economic factors, allows landscape architecture to act as a useful framework in exploring possible scenarios. This thesis will seek to once again provide an integral bond between the people and their environment which can foster a revitalised place attachment, one which will transcend generations and provide a sustainable sense of place in Scotland’s future...|$|E
