5|$|In 1992, {{the problem}} of ammonia levels in the final {{effluent}} was addressed by {{the construction of a}} system using anoxic zones and diffuse air activated sludge treatment. This dramatically reduced ammonia levels, and was the most significant factor in the re-establishment of fish stocks in the lower River Don. In 1990, the outdated filter presshouse and incineration plant were replaced by a new sludge-dewatering plant and a <b>fluidized-bed</b> <b>incinerator.</b> The new plant made the old sludge beds, situated to the east of the River Don and on the island formed by the Don and the Holmes Cut, redundant, and these have now become a nature reserve. Further improvements to the process were completed by 2005. These included an upgrade to the wet scrubbing system, in order to remove heavy metals and acid gases such as sulphur dioxide, hydrogen chloride and hydrogen fluoride from the flue gases produced by the incinerator, and the addition of a tertiary adsorption filter, which removes mercury and dioxins. The improvements were designed to ensure that the plant met the standards set out in the Waste Incineration Directive.|$|E
40|$|Cold model {{studies are}} widely {{carried out to}} predict, analyse and improve {{performance}} details and operating conditions of the actual unit and to train operators. Cold model experiments carried out to visualize and investigate the operation of recirculating <b>fluidized-bed</b> <b>incinerator</b> are reported. Some {{of the details of}} operation which are difficult to measure on an actual unit, such as solid circulation rate, particle velocity, residence time, voidage etc., are measured on the cold model. Effects of various parameters such as jet diameter, clearance between perforated plate and draft tube bottom, draft tube superficial air velocity and solid inventory on these details are discussed. The combinations of various parameters which give higher kinetic energy transfer from gas to solids per unit pressure drop across the draft tube are identified...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} {{an investigation of}} the mineralogy and pore water chemistry of a boiler ash sampled from a municipal solid waste <b>fluidized-bed</b> <b>incinerator,</b> subject to 18 months of dynamic leaching in a large percolation column experiment. A particular focus is on the redox behaviour of Cr(VI) in relation to metal aluminium Al 0, as chromium may represent an environmental or health hazard. The leaching behaviour and interaction between Cr(VI) and Al 0 are interpreted on the basis of mineralogical evolutions observed over the 18 -month period and of saturation indices calculated with the geochemical code PhreeqC and reviewed thermodynamic data. Results of mineralogical analyses show in particular the alteration of mineral phases during leaching (e. g. quartz and metal aluminium grains), while geochemical calculations suggest equilibria of percolating fluids with respect to specific mineral phases (e. g. monohydrocalcite and aluminium hydroxide). The combination of leaching data on a large scale and mineralogical analyses document the coupled leaching behaviour of aluminium and chromium, with chromium appearing in the pore fluids in its hexavalent and mobile state once metal aluminium is no longer available for chromium reduction...|$|E
40|$|This report {{investigates the}} {{technical}} and economic feasibility of co-combusting municipal sewage sludge produced by the Saratoga County Sewer District No. 1 with paper mill sludge produced by the Cottrell Paper Company, Encore Paper Company, International Paper Company, Mohawk Paper Mills, and TAGSONS Papers at the Saratoga County Sewer District No. 1 `s secondary wastewater treatment plant and recovering any available energy products. The co-combustion facility would consist of sludge and wood chip storage and conveying systems, belt filter presses, screw presses, <b>fluidized-bed</b> <b>incinerators,</b> venturi scrubbers and tray cooling systems, ash dewatering facilities, heat recovery steam generators, gas-fired steam superheaters, and a back-pressure steam turbine system. Clean waste wood chips would {{be used as an}} auxiliary fuel in the <b>fluidized-bed</b> <b>incinerators.</b> It is recommended that the ash produced by the proposed facility be beneficially used, potentially as a raw material in the manufacture of cement and/or as an interim barrier layer in landfills...|$|R
40|$|The {{formation}} of Cr, Pb, and Cd species under various operating conditions in a pilot-scale <b>fluidized-bed</b> <b>incinerator</b> was investigated. Examined were {{the effects of}} (1) an organic chloride (PVC) additive, (2) an inorganic chloride (NaCl) additive, and (3) NaNO 3 and PVC additives, under various operating temperatures. Two-stage modeling was performed to match the actual incineration conditions of the current study. Thermodynamic equilibrium analysis indicated that Cr 2 O 3, PbCl 2, and CdCl 2 were the dominant species of Cr, Pb, and Cd when an organic chloride (PVC) was present, whereas PbO and CdO were the dominant species under the other operating conditions. The XRD analysis identified Cr 2 O 3, PbCl 2, and CdCl 2. H 2 O as the dominant species of Cr, Ph, and Cd when an organic chloride (PVC) was present, whereas Cr 2 O 3, PbO, Pb 2 O 3, CdO, and CdCO 3 were identified under the other operating conditions. The sodium contained in the feedstock was shown to react with chlorine to form sodium chloride both in modeling results and by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. The temperature of the operating conditions {{had little effect on}} the {{formation of}} heavy metal species...|$|E
40|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the 2011 accident at Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant (F 1 hereafter), municipal solid waste (MSW) contaminated with radioactive cesium (rad-Cs hereafter) has been generated in 12 prefectures in Japan. The Japanese Minister of Environment classified MSW that contained rad-Cs in the concentration more than 8, 000 Bq/kg as “designated (solid) waste (DSW hereafter), and prescribed the collection, storage and transportation procedures. When MSW containing rad-Cs was incinerated, rad-Cs was concentrated in fly ash, and the ash often fell into the category of DSW. We have investigated a technique that can reduce the volume of the rad-Cs-contaminated fly-ash by extracting rad-Cs with aqueous solvents such as water and oxalic acid and concentrating rad-Cs in a small amount of hexacyanoferrate (or ferrocyanide, designated as Fer hereafter) precipitate. Since DSW could not be transported to the outside laboratory, we have conducted on-site tests at places where DSW were generated to investigate the applicability of the extraction – precipitation technique. The present report is a summary of our most recent on-site test conducted in 2014. Also presented is the re-evaluation of the results of our past on-site test from the viewpoint of leaching of rad-Cs and heavy metals in the fly ash. An apparent decrease in leaching of rad-Cs from fly ash was observed by incinerating sewage sludge with soil. Fly ash from a melting furnace contained more water-soluble rad-Cs than that from a <b>fluidized-bed</b> <b>incinerator.</b> Some incinerator fly ash appeared to produce rad-Cs in colloidal form when extracted with oxalic acid, resulting in the lower removal of rad-Cs from the extract by Fer method. © The Editor(s) if applicable and the Author(s) 2016...|$|E
