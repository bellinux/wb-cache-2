It was prepared with examiners from Ireland and Portugal for the Peer Review on 4 December 2008. Australia has made substantial, positive changes to its <b>aid</b> <b>programme</b> since 2004, reinforcing its focus on reducing poverty, on promoting the MDGs, and completely untying its <b>aid</b> <b>programme.</b> While increasing its aid, Australia should stay focused and pursue effective approaches, including working with and through other donors. Australia successfully integrated gender equality into its <b>aid</b> <b>programme</b> and could now use the same approach to integrate environmental concerns. ...|$|R

40|$|With sharp {{economic}} growth, {{the international}} focus on <b>aid</b> <b>programmes</b> of emerging economies, including India, {{has gone up}} considerably. The timing of Indian announcement, of setting up {{of a new and}} specialised agency for international cooperation, has further fuelled global speculations about an ambitious Indian commercial agenda. As most of the traditional donors are trying to achieve harmonisation and transparency under Paris Declaration, OECD has called for global discipline in the <b>aid</b> <b>programmes.</b> China has proposed supporting a UN-led initiative instead of joining OECD. While India has major challenge of putting its house in order, it can no longer overlook international placing of its <b>aid</b> <b>programmes,</b> which so far have been projected as a part of South-South cooperation.

40|$|The European Union {{has emerged}} as one of the world's largest aid donors. However, its {{multilateral}} <b>aid</b> <b>programme,</b> while well-placed to set a new standard in development assistance, suffers from problems of democratic accountability confronting all transnational actors in an increasingly global community. Examination of the rules governing the European Commission's <b>aid</b> <b>programme</b> to Asian and Latin American countries reveals a pattern of perverse incentives facing private consultants and a lack of access to information that makes the programme virtually unaccountable to both European taxpayers and citizens in recipient countries. Case material from the Philippines illustrates the problems in the Commission's <b>aid</b> <b>programme.</b> Proposals for reform are presented that are both politically feasible and capable of making the programme significantly more transparent and accountable. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} an {{examination}} of recent changes in the organisation and activity of Canada's foreign <b>aid</b> <b>programme.</b> Three conceptually distinct categories form the theoretical framework of the study: (a) contending approaches {{to the study of}} international relations; (b) contending conceptions of economic growth and development; and (c) contending approaches to the aid policy-making process. The study examines the multiple objectives underlying Canada's <b>aid</b> <b>programme,</b> develops and interprets a series of "aid quality" indices, and undertakes a detailed examination of the aid policy process. Emphasis is placed on tracing the specific combination of domestic "push" and international "pull" factors which have pressured Ottawa into initiatives promoting a closer linkage of the aid and trade facets of government activity. Attention is also drawn to the impact of these initiatives on the developmental objectives of the programme. The principal finding of the study is that while Canada's <b>aid</b> <b>programme</b> has until recently been able to maintain a precarious balance between the opposing forces of philanthropy and self-interest, there are now unmistakable signs of a deliberate effort to tilt the programme in a more commercial direction. In this trend, the single case of Canada mirrors a more general pattern towards an increasingly commercial orientation in most donor <b>aid</b> <b>programmes...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this essay is twofold: first, to explore the {{potential}} for landmine programmes to have {{both positive and negative}} effects on peacebuilding and, second, to provide operating questions and practical suggestions for mine action practitioners trying to incorporate peacebuilding into mines action. The essay will begin by examining the concept of peacebuilding and describing the work of practitioners who have attempted to incorporate peacebuilding into humanitarian <b>aid</b> <b>programmes.</b> The writings of these practitioners provide guidelines for <b>aid</b> <b>programmes</b> that can be transferred to landmine programmes. These authors also caution that <b>aid</b> <b>programmes</b> can reinforce the structures that support war. I think that this danger can extend to landmine programmes as well. This possibility, and its prevention, will be further explored. The final part of this section will explore of the dynamics of peacebuilding and how it can be incorporated into landmine work...|$|R
