5|$|A {{hurricane}} watch {{was issued}} for Kauai early on September 11 and was upgraded to a hurricane warning later that day. Prior to Iniki's arrival in Kauai, 8,000people were housed <b>in</b> <b>shelters,</b> {{many of whom}} remembered Hurricane Iwa 10years prior. Because schools were canceled, traffic was light during the evacuation, and streets were clear by mid-morning. Rather than sending tourists to public shelters, two major hotels kept their occupants in the buildings during the storm's passage.|$|E

The Guam Office of Civil Defense filed the paperwork for the Federal Emergency Management Agency to declare the island a disaster area. Governor Carl T.C. Gutierrez took similar measures to declare a state of emergency for the area. Following experience from previous typhoons, Guam newspaper Pacific Daily News underwent preparations to provide internet updates for the storm, including reinforcing the building, maintaining sufficient food supplies for the staff, and stationing two reporters elsewhere on the island; the paper was the only immediate source of information about the typhoon outside of Guam.|$|E
5|$|On {{the same}} day that Typhoon Pongsona struck Guam, President George W. Bush {{declared}} the island a major disaster area. Around the time of the cyclone passing over the island, 2,271residents were <b>in</b> <b>shelters,</b> and by the next day it increased to 3,467 after people discovered their homes were uninhabitable. With thirteen Red Cross shelters across Guam, most remained <b>in</b> <b>shelters</b> for about three weeks before disaster tents were distributed. The American Red Cross worked with the United States Department of Agriculture to provide meals for shelter attendees for a two-week period following the typhoon. Through the collaboration of federal and other agencies, disaster assistance on Guam totaled over $300million (2003USD, $335million 2007USD) by 100days after the typhoon struck, including $60million (2002USD, $ USD) in initial disaster response. Nearly 29,000individuals registered for disaster assistance, with the first assistance check arrived ten days after the disaster declaration. By three months after the storm, the United States Small Business Administration approved $130million (2003USD, $ USD) in low-interest loans.|$|E

40|$|The {{relationships}} between shelterbelt (tree windbreak) -induced microclimate and muskmelon (Cucumis melo L.) {{growth and development}} were investigated at the Univ. of Nebraska-Lincoln Agricultural Research and Development Center near Mead, Nebr., during the 1992 and 1993 growing seasons. Wind speed, wind direction, air and soil temperatures, relative humidity, and soil moisture were monitored <b>in</b> both <b>sheltered</b> and nonsheltered areas. Plant growth parameters (plant height, vine length, plant dry weight, and leaf area) were measured at various stages of development. Shelterbelts provided improved growing conditions for muskmelon transplants. Direct wind damage and duration of higher wind speeds were reduced 47 % to 56 % <b>in</b> <b>sheltered</b> areas. Air temperatures <b>in</b> <b>sheltered</b> areas were slightly higher during daytime and slightly lower at night, and significantly {{so early in the}} growing season. Relative humidity was increased significantly <b>in</b> <b>sheltered</b> areas <b>in</b> 1992 and, while higher in 1993, the difference was nonsignificant. Soil moisture content was not affected significantly by wind protection. Sheltered plants exhibited earlier development and faster growth. The first female flower appeared 2 days earlier <b>in</b> <b>sheltered</b> areas <b>in</b> both years. The first fruit set, as indicated by fruit swelling and retention on the vine, occurred 6 days earlier and matured 5 and 6 days earlier <b>in</b> <b>sheltered</b> areas <b>in</b> 1992 and 1993, respectively. Leaf areas and dry-matter accumulation of sheltered plants were greater than those of exposed plants. The shoot relative growth rate of sheltered plants increased earlier in the growing season, but decreased slightly later in the growing season. The earlier development and faster growth of sheltered plants were related mainly to the reduction of wind speed, higher total accumulated air temperatures during the daylight hours (sum of daily average daytime air temperatures based on hourly averages), and higher soil temperature <b>in</b> <b>sheltered</b> areas. Total yields were not affected significantly in either year; however, early yields were significantly greater <b>in</b> <b>sheltered</b> areas <b>in</b> 1993. If earlier maturity and increased yield are possible <b>in</b> large <b>sheltered</b> fields, this practice would provide an economic benefit to producers...|$|R

Merchants taped their store windows to protect them from strong winds while residents stocked up on water. In Cabo San Lucas on the southern tip of Baja California, authorities began evacuating low-lying areas as residents and tourists flooded supermarkets. Gas stations were filled with lines up to 0.5mi (0.8km) long. All traffic was closed to the ports of Cabo San Lucas and San José del Cabo. The Red Cross opened shelters at several local schools. Municipal authorities issued a red alert. Army and Navy representatives met to discuss rescue operations. About 1,000 people sought refuge <b>in</b> <b>shelters</b> across Cabo San Lucas and nearby San Jose del Cabo as the storm arrived. Most airline flights were canceled, frustrating tourists.|$|E

The agency later issued a tropical storm warning for the Atlantic coast from Cape Canaveral to Little River Inlet in South Carolina. Officials ordered evacuations for barrier islands in nine Florida counties along the gulf coast, and about 3,000people stayed <b>in</b> <b>shelters.</b> Government offices closed along the storm's projected path in the state.

In addition, the movement dispatched 3,000 workers and three disaster response teams to affected areas for search and rescue missions, damage assessments, and assistance to people affected by the typhoon. The Philippine Red Cross provided canned goods, rice, clothing, and personal hygiene items to over 6,300 families, and local volunteers provided assistance to people <b>in</b> <b>shelters.</b> The Spanish Red Cross, present since 1998 as a backup to the Philippine Red Cross, also sent officials, logistics equipment, and water purification systems to the more heavily areas to aid in disaster relief and damage assessments.|$|E
