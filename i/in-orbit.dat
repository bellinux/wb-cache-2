25|$|The {{first two}} Galileo <b>In-Orbit</b> Validation {{satellites}} were launched by Soyuz ST-B flown from Guiana Space Centre on 21 October 2011, {{and the remaining}} two on 12 October 2012.|$|E
25|$|The {{launch of}} the first four <b>in-orbit</b> {{validation}} (IOV) satellites was planned {{for the second half}} of 2011, and the launch of full operational capability (FOC) satellites was planned to start in late 2012.|$|E
25|$|A third satellite, GIOVE-A2, was {{originally}} {{planned to be}} built by SSTL for launch {{in the second half}} of 2008. Construction of GIOVE-A2 was terminated due to the successful launch and <b>in-orbit</b> operation of GIOVE-B.|$|E
25|$|During <b>in-orbit</b> {{testing of}} the satellite, it was {{discovered}} that the New Zealand spot beam had been configured with horizontal polarisation instead of the expected vertical polarisation - as had been used on its predecessor Optus B1.|$|E
25|$|HTV-1 carried {{four and}} a half tonnes of payload, lower than the six tonne maximum payload of the HTV in order to allow the {{spacecraft}} to carry additional propellant and batteries for the <b>in-orbit</b> verification phase of the flight.|$|E
25|$|Cenker {{worked for}} 18 years at RCA Astro-Electronics and its {{successor}} company GE Astro Space. Cenker worked on hardware design and systems design concerning satellite attitude control. He also worked on <b>in-orbit</b> operations, {{as well as}} spacecraft assembly, test, and pre-launch operations. He spent two years on the Navy navigation satellite program, but {{spent most of his}} career working on commercial communications satellites.|$|E
25|$|The first {{experimental}} satellite, GIOVE-A, {{was launched}} in December 2005 and {{was followed by a}} second test satellite, GIOVE-B, launched in April 2008. After successful completion of the <b>In-Orbit</b> Validation (IOV) phase, additional satellites were launched. On 30 November 2007 the 27 EU transport ministers involved reached an agreement that Galileo should be operational by 2013, but later press releases suggest it was delayed to 2014.|$|E
25|$|GIOVE-A is {{the first}} GIOVE (Galileo <b>In-Orbit</b> Validation Element) test satellite. It was built by Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd (SSTL), and {{successfully}} launched on 28 December 2005 by the European Space Agency and the Galileo Joint. Operation of GIOVE-A ensured that Galileo meets the frequency-filing allocation and reservation requirements for the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), a process that was required to be complete by June 2006.|$|E
25|$|The Enzmann starship, as {{detailed}} by G. Harry Stine in the October 1973 issue of Analog, was a {{design for a}} future starship, based on the ideas of Robert Duncan-Enzmann. The spacecraft itself as proposed used a 12,000,000 ton ball of frozen deuterium to power 12–24 thermonuclear pulse propulsion units. Twice {{as long as the}} Empire State Building and assembled <b>in-orbit,</b> the spacecraft {{was part of a larger}} project preceded by interstellar probes and telescopic observation of target star systems.|$|E
25|$|After <b>in-orbit</b> {{activation}} of the ATV's propulsion system about two hours after launch, {{the second of the}} four Propulsion Drive Electronics (PDE) units, which controlled a quarter of the ATV's maneuvering thrusters, reported an unexpected difference in the mixing pressure between the fuel and the oxidiser. Engine burns were briefly postponed while the fault was investigated. A restart of the entire propulsion system by the ATV Control Centre in Toulouse, France, resolved the problem. The ESA reported that the mission could have gone ahead even if one quarter of the maneuvering thrusters had been unavailable.|$|E
500|$|On 24 March 2009, the Nigerian Federal Ministry of Science and Technology, NigComSat Ltd. and CGWIC signed another {{contract}} for the <b>in-orbit</b> delivery of the NigComSat-1R satellite. NigComSat-1R was also a DFH-4 satellite, and the replacement for the failed NigComSat-1 was successfully launched [...] into orbit by China in Xichang on 19 December 2011. The satellite according to then-Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan which was {{paid for by the}} insurance policy on NigComSat-1 which de-orbited in 2009, would {{have a positive impact on}} national development in various sectors such as communications, internet services, health, agriculture, environmental protection and national security.|$|E
2500|$|The game {{tells the}} story of Kurt Hectic, a janitor who reluctantly must attempt to save Earth from an alien {{invasion}} of gigantic strip mining city-sized vehicles named [...] "Minecrawlers". These Minecrawlers are removing all of earth's natural resources, and crushing any people and cities that get in their way. Aided by his boss, the possibly insane inventor and scientist Dr. Fluke Hawkins, and a robotic two-legged/four-armed dog named Bones, Kurt must infiltrate each Minecrawler, and fight his way to the pilot, whom he must then kill before returning to Hawkins' <b>in-orbit</b> space station, the Jim Dandy.|$|E
2500|$|In both games, the {{objective}} is to save Earth from alien invaders known as [...] "Streamriders." [...] In the first game, the player controls Kurt Hectic, a janitor, who must infiltrate and destroy a series of gigantic strip mining city-size vehicles named [...] "Minecrawlers," [...] which are removing all of earth's natural resources. In the second game, the player can control three characters; Kurt, his employer Dr. Hawkins, and a genetically engineered robotic two-legged/four-armed dog named Max. In this game, a second wave of Streamriders attack Earth, and the player must battle them on the last remaining Minecrawler, Hawkins' <b>in-orbit</b> space station (the Jim Dandy), an alien attack ship, and, eventually, the alien home world itself.|$|E
2500|$|These testbed {{satellites}} {{were followed}} by four IOV Galileo satellites that are {{much closer to the}} final Galileo satellite design. The Search & Rescue feature is also installed. The first two satellites were launched on 21 October 2011 from Guiana Space Centre using a Soyuz launcher, the other two on 12 October 2012. This enables key validation tests, since earth-based receivers such as those in cars and phones need to [...] "see" [...] a minimum of four satellites in order to calculate their position in three dimensions. Those 4 IOV Galileo satellites were constructed by Astrium GmbH and Thales Alenia Space. On 12 March 2013, a first fix was performed using those four IOV satellites. Once this <b>In-Orbit</b> Validation (IOV) phase has been completed, the remaining satellites will be installed to reach the Full Operational Capability.|$|E
2500|$|Current satellite-based sensors are not {{designed}} to meet the accuracy requirements needed for climate change detection. Many sensors used for climate measurements were designed to meet operational weather needs and are not optimized for climate sampling. [...] These sensors, along with older instruments designed for climate, lack the on-board ability to test for systematic errors on orbit. The CLARREO mission will meet these goals through careful consideration of the instrument design, calibration traceability at all stages of development and operation, with spectral, spatial and temporal sampling focused specifically on the creation of climate records. Then after development of new cross-calibration methodologies far more accurate than those achieved today, CLARREO may serve as an <b>in-orbit</b> standard to provide reference intercalibration for missions like the broadband Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES), operational sounders including the Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) and Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI), and imagers such as the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) and Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR).|$|E
2500|$|By 2013 {{there was}} a {{national}} goal, that [...] "the state has decided that power coming from outside of the earth, such as solar power and development of other space energy resources, is to be China's future direction" [...] and the following roadmap was identified: [...] "In 2010, CAST will finish the concept design; in 2020, we will finish the industrial level testing of <b>in-orbit</b> construction and wireless transmissions. In 2025, we will complete the first 100kW SPS demonstration at LEO; and in 2035, the 100MW SPS will have electric generating capacity. Finally in 2050, the first commercial level SPS system will be in operation at GEO." [...] The article went on to state that [...] "Since SPS development {{will be a huge}} project, it will be considered the equivalent of an Apollo program for energy. In the last century, America's leading position in science and technology worldwide was inextricably linked with technological advances associated with implementation of the Apollo program. Likewise, as China's current achievements in aerospace technology are built upon with its successive generations of satellite projects in space, China will use its capabilities in space science to assure sustainable development of energy from space." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} satellites, XM-1 ("Rock") and XM-2 ("Roll") {{suffered from}} a generic design fault on the Boeing 702 series of satellites (fogging of the solar panels), which means that their lifetimes were shortened to approximately six years instead of the design goal of 15 years. To compensate for this flaw, XM-3 ("Rhythm") was launched ahead of its planned schedule on February 28, 2005 and moved into XM-1's previous location of 85° WL. XM-1 was then moved to be co-located with XM-2 at 115° WL, where each satellite operated only one transponder (thus broadcasting half the bandwidth each) to conserve energy and cut the power consumption in half while XM-4 ("Blues") was readied for launch. Subsequently, XM launched ground-spare XM-4 ("Blues") ahead of schedule on October 30, 2006 into the 115° WL location to complete the satellite replacement program. On December 15, 2006 XM-1 was then powered down and drifted back to its original location at 85° WL, where it will remain as a backup to XM-3. XM-2 as well was powered down and remains as a backup to XM-4. This makes the current active satellites as XM-3 [...] "Rhythm" [...] and XM-4 [...] "Blues" [...] with two <b>in-orbit</b> spares.|$|E
2500|$|The Iridium system {{requires}} 66 active satellites {{in orbit}} to complete its constellation and spare satellites are kept <b>in-orbit</b> {{to serve in}} case of failure. The satellites are in six polar low Earth orbital planes at a height of approximately [...] Satellites communicate with neighboring satellites via Ka band intersatellite links to relay communications to and from ground stations. Most of these satellites were launched in the late 1990s before the company went through bankruptcy. Since the bankruptcy, until January 2017, only seven additional satellites were launched but an updated constellation of 66 satellites called Iridium NEXT is being rolled out, planned for launch between 2015 and 2017 on SpaceX Falcon 9 launch vehicles from Vandenberg AFB Space Launch Complex 4 in California. On January 14th 2017, SpaceX successfully launched 10 of the new Iridium satellites into orbit. The second launch of Iridium NEXT satellites took place on June 25th, 2017 on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket out of Vandenberg Air Force Base. [...] This was the second of eight scheduled launches. The third launch of NEXT satellites took place on October 9, 2017. A total of ten satellites were deployed after a successful launch on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket.|$|E
2500|$|Moreover, it {{has since}} emerged that {{detailed}} study on a Soviet space-based LASER system began no later than 1976 as the Skif, a 1 MW Carbon dioxide laser along with the anti-satellite Kaskad, an <b>in-orbit</b> missile platform. With both devices reportedly designed to pre-emptively destroy any US satellites that might be launched in the future which could otherwise aid US missile defense. In 1987 a disguised Mir space station module was lifted on the inaugural flight of the Energia booster as the Polyus and {{it has since}} been revealed that this craft housed a number of systems of the Skif laser and it was intended that they clandestinely be tested in orbit, {{if it had not}} been for the spacecraft's attitude control system malfunctioning upon separation from the booster and it failing to reach orbit. More tentatively, it is also suggested that the Zarya module of the International Space Station, capable of station keeping and providing sizable battery power, was initially developed to power the Skif laser system. Soviet motivations behind attempting to launch components of the Skif laser were, according to interviews conducted years later, more for propaganda purposes in the prevailing climate of focus on US SDI, than as an effective defense technology, as the phrase [...] "Space based laser" [...] has a certain political capital.|$|E
