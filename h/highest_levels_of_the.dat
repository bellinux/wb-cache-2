5|$|After {{spending}} {{his childhood in}} his birth town of Ponce, Paoli moved to Spain where, {{with the assistance of}} his well-connected sister Amalia, he obtained a Royal scholarship to take singing lessons in Italy.

Before the end of the 19th century and while Paoli was still in his twenties, he went on a tour of Europe that earned him both popular acclaim, and imperial honors from princes, kings, and emperors.|$|E
5|$|In other areas, {{such as the}} Mediterranean, some {{individuals}} have adverse reactions to apples because of their similarity to peaches. This form of apple allergy also includes OAS, but often has more severe symptoms, such as vomiting, abdominal pain and urticaria, and can be life-threatening. Individuals with this form of allergy can also develop reactions to other fruits and nuts. Cooking does not break down the protein causing this particular reaction, so affected individuals can eat neither raw nor cooked apples. Freshly harvested, over-ripe fruits tend to have the <b>highest</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> protein that causes this reaction.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the reasons}} for the move from Zeus to Nike-X was concern that the Zeus radars would not be able to tell the {{difference}} between the warhead and a decoy until it was too late to launch. One solution to this problem was the Sprint missile, which had the performance required to wait until decluttering was complete. Another potential solution was to look for some sort of signature of the reentry through the <b>highest</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> atmosphere that might differ between a warhead and decoy; specifically, it appeared that the ablation of the heat shield might produce a clear signature pointing out the warhead.|$|E
5|$|Under the {{guidance}} of General Hermann Balck, the cities of Zhytomyr and Korosten were retaken in mid-November, but after receiving reinforcements Vatutin resumed the offensive on 24 December 1943, and the Red Army continued its successful advance. Manstein's repeated requests to Hitler for more reinforcements were turned down. On 4 January 1944 Manstein met with Hitler {{to tell him that}} the Dnieper line was untenable and that he needed to retreat in order to save his forces. Hitler refused, and Manstein again requested changes in the <b>highest</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> military leadership, but was turned down, as Hitler believed that he alone was capable of managing the wider strategy.|$|E
5|$|Communication with Wallace in the far-off Malay Archipelago was {{impossible}} without months of delay, {{so he was}} not part of this rapid publication. Fortunately, Wallace accepted the arrangement after the fact, happy that he had been included at all, and never expressed public or private bitterness. Darwin's social and scientific status was far greater than Wallace's, and it was unlikely that, without Darwin, Wallace's views on evolution would have been taken seriously. Lyell and Hooker's arrangement relegated Wallace to the position of co-discoverer, and he was not the social equal of Darwin or the other prominent British natural scientists. However, the joint reading of their papers on natural selection associated Wallace with the more famous Darwin. This, combined with Darwin's (as well as Hooker's and Lyell's) advocacy on his behalf, would give Wallace greater access to the <b>highest</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> scientific community. The reaction to the reading was muted, {{with the president of the}} Linnean Society remarking in May 1859 that the year had not been marked by any striking discoveries; but, with Darwin's publication of On the Origin of Species later in 1859, its significance became apparent. When Wallace returned to the UK, he met Darwin. Although some of Wallace's iconoclastic opinions in the ensuing years would test Darwin's patience, they remained on friendly terms for the rest of Darwin's life.|$|E

5|$|On 6 August 1307, {{less than}} a month after succeeding, Edward II made Piers Gaveston Earl of Cornwall. According to {{contemporary}} narrative sources, this was a controversial decision. Gaveston came from relatively humble origins, and his rise to the highest level of the peerage was considered improper by the established nobility. Furthermore, the earldom of Cornwall had traditionally been reserved for members of the royal family, and Edward I had intended it for one of his two younger sons from his second marriage. The discontent reported by the chronicles may have been the result of hindsight, however; there is no sign that the established nobility objected to the ennoblement of Gaveston at the time. The earldom gave Gaveston substantial landholdings over great parts of England, to the value of Â£4,000 a year. These possessions consisted of most of Cornwall, as well as parts of Devonshire in the south-west, land in Berkshire and Oxfordshire centred on the honour of Wallingford, most of the eastern part of Lincolnshire, and the honour of Knaresborough in Yorkshire, with the territories that belonged to it. In addition to this, Edward also secured a prestigious marriage between Gaveston and Margaret de Clare, sister of the powerful Earl of Gloucester. The possessions and family connection secured Gaveston a place among the <b>highest</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> English nobility.|$|E

25|$|Penthouse {{magazine}} began {{publication in}} 1965, in the UK and in North America in 1969, {{an attempt to}} compete with Hugh Hefner's Playboy. Guccione offered editorial content that was more sensational than that of Playboy, and the magazine's writing was far more investigative than Hefner's upscale emphasis, with stories about government cover-ups and scandals. Writers such as Craig S.

The President ordered to have the investigation under federal jurisdiction. Investigators discovered that two weeks before he was killed, BermÃºdez ZacarÃ­as suspected that two men were following him. He called the police one day on his way home, but did not request to have security measures in place for his daily activities.|$|E
25|$|The {{creation}} of the Lake Superior basin reflects the erosive power of continental glaciers that advanced and retreated over Minnesota {{several times in the}} past 2 million years. Lake Superior was shaped by the geology of the Midcontinent Rift. The mile-thick ice sheets easily eroded the loosely cemented sandstone that filled the axis of the rift valley, but encountered more resistance from the igneous rocks forming the flanks of the rift, now the margins of the lake basin. In the final retreat of the ice from the Lake Superior basin about 11,000 years ago, meltwaters filled the rift's scoured-out sandy core. As the last glacier retreated, meltwaters filled the lake to as high as 500 feet above the current level; the Skyline Parkway roughly follows one of the <b>highest</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ancient Lake Superior, Glacial Lake Duluth.|$|E
25|$|John Komnenos Vatatzes {{was the son}} of the sebastohypertatos Theodore Vatatzes, and the porphyrogenita princess Eudokia Komnene, {{daughter}} of the emperor John II Komnenos and his empress Eirene of Hungary. Theodore Vatatzes was one of the 'new men' raised to prominence by John II; the Vatatzes family were not previously counted amongst the <b>highest</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Byzantine aristocracy, though they had long been prominent in the region around the city of Adrianople in Thrace. John's parents married in 1131, and he was born soon thereafter, probably ca. 1132. John had a brother, Andronikos, who was also a prominent general - he led an army against the city of Amaseia in 1176 and was killed by the Seljuq Turks; they displayed his severed head during the Battle of Myriokephalon shortly afterwards. He had another brother, named Alexios. John's wife was named Maria Doukaina and they had two sons, Alexios and Manuel. The latter was named for John's uncle, the Emperor Manuel, to whom John was very devotedâto the extent of tolerating a love affair between the emperor and his own sister Theodora.|$|E
