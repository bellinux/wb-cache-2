40|$|By {{varying the}} mean {{granulometry}} and {{the packing density}} of the arc quenching material (silica sand), we show {{the influence of the}} silica sand morphometric properties on the pressure evolution during the HBC fuse working. Pressure measurements are made using piezoelectric transducers inserted at various lengths taken from the <b>fuse</b> <b>strip</b> plane. The measurements are compared with the results get from the simulation of the energy withdraw within a granular material. Both types of results show that the pressure evolution is strongly correlated with the electric power evolution and the morphometric properties...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis work {{deals with}} the {{calculation}} of pre-arcing time {{in the case of}} High Breaking Capacity fuses submitted to high fault currents. The fuse elements studied consist of silver <b>fuse</b> <b>strips</b> with reduced sections in their centre. During the fuse working the fuse element is fused partly and hence vaporized. The time necessary to obtain an electric arc is called the pre-arcing time. This latter is defined by the duration from the appearance of the fault current to the splitting of the fuse element due to the vaporization of the reduced sections. The mathematic model is based on the solution of the heat transfer equation, using an enthalpy formulation {{to take into account the}} phase transitions, supplemented by an energy source due to the heat produced by ohmic losses. In order to determine the current density evolution in the fuse element, the Laplace equation governing the electric potential and the Ohm's law are used. Two typical fuse elements close to industrial ones are chosen for the simulations. The calculated pre-arcing times are given together with the main electrical properties, and compared with the experimental values. The resistive case with cos phi ~ 0. 9 is discussed for a 2. 5 mm and 7. 5 mm-width elements respectively with one and three reduced sections...|$|R
50|$|Limiter fuses {{consist of}} a metal strip from a lock plate, for {{currents}} over 40 amperes. Frequently, these are used {{in close proximity to}} starter battery fuse boxes. They are used also in electric vehicles, e.g., in forklift trucks. Because <b>strip</b> <b>fuses</b> require the use of tools for replacement they are therefore legally considered non-serviceable components for end-users.|$|R
50|$|The {{company was}} rebuilt in the 1950s. In 1954, a new factory was {{completed}} in Inselstrasse in Stuttgart-Untert√ºrkheim. Founded in Malters, Switzerland, in 1957, SEFAG was the first branch outside Germany. The company began using plastics on an industrial scale in 1962 with the new plant in Winterbach. In 1968, Pfisterer invented the compact screw terminal, which became the technical standard used to connect all new builds in Germany to underground power networks {{from the end of}} the 1960s. The following year, Pfisterer received the patent for compact <b>fuse</b> disconnector <b>strips</b> for low-voltage distributors and used them in plastic distributing cabinets, a new development at the time.|$|R
5000|$|Bangles are {{circular}} in shape, and, unlike bracelets, are not flexible. The word {{is derived}} from Hindi bungri (glass). They are made of numerous precious as well as non-precious materials such as gold, silver, platinum, glass, wood, ferrous metals, plastic, etc. Bangles made from sea shell, which are white colour, are worn by married Bengali and Oriya Hindu women. A special type of bangle is worn by women and girls, especially in the Bengal area, commonly known as a [...] "Bengali bangle", which {{is used as a}} substitute for a costly gold bangle, and is produced by fixing a thin gold strip (weighing between 1-3 g) is thermo-mechanically fused onto a bronze bangle, followed by manual crafting on that <b>fused</b> gold <b>strip.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this report is to describe combined orthodontic and endodontic treatment of a fused mandibular premolar with supernumerary tooth. The patient was a 15 year old girl seeking orthodontic treatment for the correction of maxillary and mandibular crowding. Cephalometric examination revealed skeletally Class I relationship. The panoramic radiograph showed a fused tooth with two separate pulp chambers and two separate root canals connecting in apical third. After the endodontic treatment of the <b>fused</b> teeth, the <b>stripping</b> of the supernumerary tooth was performed to establish a Class I canine relationship and to correct midline deviation. At {{the end of the}} treatment, the crowding was resolved and positive overjet and overbite was achieved...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{morphological}} diversity {{associated with}} the strip substructure of the euglenid pellicle was examined, and after identifying characters and states, we outlined hypotheses about their evolution. We have attempted to standardize terms necessary for analytical comparisons of strips by providing a glossary and comparing published synonyms. Most of the substructural diversity found in euglenids is demonstrated with 13 representative taxa. Strips are generally composed of two subcomponents: frames and projections. Frames support the basic shape of strips and many {{can be described as}} either S-shaped, plateau-shaped, M-shaped, or A-shaped. Projections branch laterally from the frames, are usually periodic, and can be described as thread-like structures, an indented plate, tooth-like structures, and plate-like structures. The ancestral state included strips that were few in number, flat, and <b>fused.</b> The <b>strips</b> became S-shaped and disjoined in the lineage leading to most euglenid taxa. These strips became secondarily flattened and fused in one lineage. In some lineages of phototrophs, the strips became increasingly robust. Two strips of different morphology formed the repeating pellicular unit or doublet in four taxa. These doublets evolved convergently at least three times and may provide insights into developmental patterns of the cytoskeleton...|$|R
