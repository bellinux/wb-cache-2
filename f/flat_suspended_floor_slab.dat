40|$|The {{analysed}} {{the relationship}} between working height and productivity of masonry worker on construction site by investigating two project sites. Data were also gathered by observing work activity on site. Time study form was design to record the various elements of the task performed and the time taken to complete each element {{over a period of}} observation at both floor levels for a period of six working days. A total of thirty structured questionnaires were administered on the factors affecting workers productivity on construction site. T-test was used to determine the difference between productivity at different level. The research concluded that the factors affecting productivity are: Availability of materials, Weather, Gang size, Enabling environment, Height of work have strongly significant effect on the productivity of workers output on construction sites. A none statistically significant difference existed between the output of block laying at both floor levels but a statistically significant difference existed between the output of concrete work at first <b>suspended</b> <b>floor</b> <b>slab</b> and second <b>suspended</b> <b>floor</b> <b>slab.</b> It was also concluded that the output determined for Block laying was 12 m 2 /day...|$|R

40|$|The {{vibration}} serviceability {{limit state}} {{is an important}} design consideration for two-way, <b>suspended</b> concrete <b>floors</b> that is not always well understood by many practicing structural engineers. Although the field of floor vibration has been extensively developed, at present there are no convenient design tools that deal with this problem. Results from this research have enabled {{the development of a}} much-needed, new method for assessing the vibration serviceability of <b>flat,</b> <b>suspended</b> concrete <b>floors</b> in buildings. This new method has been named, the Response Coefficient-Root Function (RCRF) method. Full-scale, laboratory tests have been conducted on a post-tensioned floor specimen at Queensland University of Technology’s structural laboratory. Special support brackets were fabricated to perform as frictionless, pinned connections at the corners of the specimen. A series of static and dynamic tests were performed in the laboratory to obtain basic material and dynamic properties of the specimen. Finite-element-models have been calibrated against data collected from laboratory experiments. Computational finite-element-analysis has been extended to investigate a variety of floor configurations. Field measurements of floors in existing buildings are in good agreement with computational studies. Results from this parametric investigation have {{led to the development of}} new approach for predicting the design frequencies and accelerations of flat, concrete floor structures. The RCRF method is convenient tool to assist structural engineers in the design for the vibration serviceability limit-state of in-situ concrete floor systems...|$|R

In {{this paper}} is {{considered}} the modeling of a monolithic reinforced concrete buildings structures by the spatial plate-core scheme and study of the <b>floor</b> <b>slabs</b> punching problem. When creating the finite element model of the building structure the <b>floor</b> <b>slabs</b> were created by four-node quadrilateral finite elements with 24 degrees of freedom, the columns and beams were created by spatial rods with 12 degrees of freedom. The calculation of the frame {{has been done by}} the software complex «SCAD», are got the efforts in the framework elements and are determined the concentration of stresses in the connections of slabs and columns. The program «Calculation of <b>floor</b> <b>slab</b> on punching» has been developed by the high-level language Object Pascal in Delphi environment, in accordance with the design standard which allows to research different locations of columns and stiffening diaphragms on the <b>floor</b> <b>slab.</b> The ratio of bearing capacity of the slab was calculated by means of the software «Calculation of <b>floor</b> <b>slab</b> on punching». Results are well correlated with the program «Arbat» of the software complex «SCAD». Difference of the developed program is in the possibility of considering of the columns and stiffness diaphragm location options on the <b>floor</b> <b>slab</b> (central, edge, corner).

40|$|AbstractMonolithic {{reinforced}} concrete building frame becomes prevailing structural design {{choice in the}} last ten years in Mongolia. But it is observed from the study that slabs in those buildings experience cracking problems. Commonly think that these cracks are due to shrinking effects of concrete and seriousness of them is underestimated mainly from structural point of view. Even that they are serious durability issues of the structure and further of the building. In this paper the study of cracks developed in the cast-in-place {{reinforced concrete}} slabs, their possible sources and negative impacts like structural failure is provided. Two kinds of cracks for monolithic <b>floor</b> <b>slab</b> are occurred for several buildings. One begins from the upper part of <b>floor</b> <b>slab</b> which is connected to beam along floor beam. Others form in lower part of the floor beam and in the middle. These cracks are caused by reinforcement position changed for <b>floor</b> <b>slab</b> during construction. When reinforcement position for <b>floor</b> <b>slab</b> is changed by few millimeters, load carrying capacity of the <b>floor</b> <b>slab</b> is decreased, as shown in LIRA- 9. 4 program structural analysis...|$|R

40|$|This article {{considers}} {{the technology of}} early loading monolithic slabs using beam and rack timbering. The main principle is the next: after the concrete is cured to the required strength, the forms are removed and the support shores are installed for load transfer to the underlying <b>floor</b> <b>slab.</b> Such technique allows to form stripping at 60 % concrete strength with shoring the upper <b>floor</b> <b>slab</b> on the two underlying ones. The suggested technique results in reduced concrete cure time. The calculation of frame under erection to justify the technique in this question showed that <b>floor</b> <b>slabs</b> endure the load during erection with the concrete strength being 60 % of the design value. The same principle was applied during erection of a cast-in-place building. The cast-in-place concrete was cured to 60 % strength and supported by shores, which were installed on the two underlying decks. In this case <b>floor</b> <b>slab</b> camber did not exceed the standard camber allowed...|$|R

Earthquake {{is one of}} {{the major}} threats towards {{building}} and non-building structure and various seismic isolation technologies have gained a good development all-round the world. Based on such a condition, a new form of seismic isolation technology is raised, which combine rolling bases and dampers to isolate <b>floor</b> <b>slabs</b> from quake wave. Analysis towards scaled model dynamic test shows that this seismic isolation technology for <b>floor</b> <b>slabs</b> can effectively reduce response acceleration of <b>floor</b> <b>slabs,</b> especially when frequency of input acceleration is high.
