A user’s location will be another piece of information—as common as the date is today—getting input from the GPS when outdoors and from other location-providing devices when indoors. The availability of location information will have a broad effect on both application-level and network-level software. Possible new services and functions include geographic messaging, advertising, and resource discovery. Geographic messaging is the ability to send a message selectively to specific geographic subareas defined by latitude and longitude—for example, sending an emergency message to everyone in a specific area, such as a building, train station, or highway.

To monitor and prevent childhood exposures, the CDC recommends that states create their own targeted screening programs. Here we use data from STELLAR, a statewide childhood blood lead tracking program {{for the state of}} Kansas, to analyze spatial and temporal relationships in the distribution of child blood lead tests for the 6 year study period of 2006 to 2011. Nonspatial demographic data from STELLAR is also analyzed to identify potential demographic target zones such as race, ethnicity, or sex. Data from the database was analyzed in ArcGIS software by county or census tract along with the most recent available census data to understand both the spatial and nonspatial trends within the demographic data. Geographic mean blood lead levels were also calculated for Kansas counties and displayed spatially. A large quantity of missing or errant <b>geographic</b> (<b>address)</b> and demographic data within the STELLAR database, however, created a lack of confidence in observed trends and made it impossible to conclusively identify potential targeted screening regions. Higher quality data and consistent data entry at physician locations is necessary for spatial analyses such as these to provide conclusive evidence for future interventions and screening programs to prevent childhood lead poisoning and exposures...|$|E
40|$|This memo {{outlines}} the policy to get nutrient reduction credits in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed Model for {{the installation of}} verifiable homeowner BMPs. At its September meeting, the USWG agreed to seek approval from the CBP partnership for the homeowner BMP policy. This policy does not require an urban BMP review expert panel process, since the computational protocols {{for each of the}} core homeowner practices have been developed by previous expert panels, which were approved by the CBP partnership. The key policy changes for which the USWG is seeking CBP approval involves streamlining two areas involved in the reporting and verification of homeowner BMPs, given their small size and potentially great numbers. The first change would allow localities to report aggregate implementation of acreage served by home-owner BMPs to the state rather than individual practices with a specific <b>geographic</b> <b>address</b> (localities would still have to maintain records on individual practices in order to verify the practice). The second change is to allow localities to utilize alternative verification methods for homeowner BMPs, such as sub-sampling of on-site inspections, homeowner self-inspection, electronic filing of digital photos to confirm homeowner BMPs. These alternative methods, some of which are still under development, would help to reduce the local staff burden that would be required under the proposed urban verification protocols for larger BMPs. The remainder of this memo highlights the tools and resources that have been recently developed to assist states and localities to design, install, report, track and verify homeowner BMPs...|$|E

In Ghana, the major nature of travel routing is through the ‘trotro’ system.

The trotro system is significant because Ghana's road network and street addressing are imperfectly mapped.

The basic tools available or under development are discussed. BACKGROUND der FASTBUS is study since a standard data 1976, and under bus which has been una development program supported by the U. S. Department of Energy since 1977. The principal goal of the original program {{was to develop a}} data bus, optimized for high speed data acquisition, which would accommodate the anticipated needs of the 1980 's and beyond. The principal requirements perceived at the inception of FASTBUS were threefold: (1) To accommodate system data throughputs of about an order of magnitude greater than systems in current use; (2) To accommodate distributed intelligence, particularly in the form of multiple microprocessors and special purpose microcomputers, and (3) To provide system interconnection devices and standard software for system initialization and diagnostics. The status of development has been reported upon at each prior Nuclear Science Symposium since 1977. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to briefly review the characteristics of FASTBUS, recent progress toward finalization of the specification, and anticipated future directions. The paper will mention primarily developments in the U. S., since a separate paper at this Conference will cover European developments. CHARACTERISTICS OF FASTBUS The FASTBUS data bus can perhaps be most easily summarized by reference to a list of signal lines (Table 1). This table shows the various lines by name and classification. A more detailed picture is given by reference to the pin-outs of a typical module station (Table 2).

The network delivers the message to all devices in that region. A representative application is to distribute Common Operating Picture updates to interested devices. This paper extends previous research on GA to handle challenging problems arising in real-world implementations: large scale, network heterogeneity and multiple security domains.

30|$|To {{accommodate}} such location aware forwarding, we {{introduce a}} hierarchical <b>geographic</b> <b>addressing</b> scheme with support for aggregation, named COST. InPs in PolyViNE must associate COST addresses {{with all the}} substrate nodes and SPs must express location requirements in terms of COST. Controllers in different InPs publish/disseminate information about the geographic locations of their nodes along with the unit price of their resources. They can then aggregate and disseminate data collected from all neighboring Controllers {{to build their own}} knowledge bases of location to InP mappings, each accompanied by path vectors of InPs in the controller network and corresponding prices. We propose Location Awareness Protocol (LAP) to perform this task. Careful readers will notice in the following that COST and LAP are significantly influenced by BGP.|$|R

However, unlike these works, PolyViNE does not use the information for addressing or routing purposes; rather it uses the location information to find candidate InPs that will be able to embed part or whole of the remaining unmapped VN request. Moreover, such location information is disseminated between and stored in Controllers instead of border routers as in BGP or GIRO [14]. The concepts of Controllers in InPs and controller network connecting multiple InPs’ Controllers are discussed in the iMark framework [10].|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Next {{generation}} {{vehicles are}} expected to exchange information with other non-LOS vehicles, the road infrastructure and databases in the Internet {{in order to increase}} road safety and traffic efficiency, or simply to entertain passengers. In this context, the mutual knowledge of positions and trajectories is necessary and is only meaningful to vehicles in a particular geographic area- potentially far away from the information source. It requires reliable and scalable communication capabilities which we refer to as <b>geographic</b> <b>addressing</b> and routing (geonetworking). The TCP/IP protocol suite provides a unification layer between various physical communication technologies and various types of applications. A wide deployment of invehicle/onboard Internet access and services to millions of vehicles will only be possible with IPv 6, the latest version of the Internet Protocol. However, geonetworking and IPv 6 need still to be combined efficiently, which corresponds to GeoNet project target, i. e. to have a single communication architecture, referred as "IPv 6 geonetworking". It will allow for both IPv 6 and non-IPv 6 communications and will effectively provide a path to new and outstanding applications requiring data transmission to explicit geographical areas.
