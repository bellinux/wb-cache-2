25|$|The {{first state}} owned Iranian bank, Bank Melli Iran was {{established}} in 1927 {{by the government of}} Iran. The bank's primary objective was to facilitate government's financial transactions and to print and distribute the Iranian currency (rial and toman). For more than 33 years, Bank Melli Iran was acting as the central bank of Iran with the responsibility to maintain the value of <b>Iranian</b> <b>rial.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Central Bank of the Islamic Republic of Iran is {{responsible}} for developing and maintaining the <b>Iranian</b> <b>rial,</b> which serves as the country's currency. The government doesn't recognize trade unions other than the Islamic labour councils, which {{are subject to the}} approval of employers and the security services. The minimum wage in June 2013 was 487 million rials a month ($134). Unemployment has remained above 10% since 1997, and the unemployment rate for women is almost double that of the men.|$|E

2500|$|... 2012: TSE’s {{overall index}} hit {{a new record}} high in October 2012 surpassing 31,000 points. Export-oriented {{companies}} have been favoured because of the imposition of an oil embargo {{by the international community}} and the consequent sharp decline {{in the value of the}} <b>Iranian</b> <b>rial</b> over 2012.|$|E
2500|$|The {{value of}} the <b>Iranian</b> <b>rial</b> has plunged since autumn 2011, it is {{reported}} to have devalued up to 80%, falling 10% immediately after the imposition of the EU oil embargo since early October 2012, causing widespread panic among the Iranian public. [...] In January 2012, the country raised the interest rate on bank deposits by up to 6 percentage points in order to curtail the rial's depreciation. The rate increase was a setback for Ahmadinejad, who had been using below-inflation rates to provide cheap loans to the poor, though naturally Iranian bankers were delighted by the increase. Not long after, and just a few days after Iran's economic minister declared that [...] "there was no economic justification" [...] for devaluing the currency because Iran's foreign exchange reserves were [...] "not only good, but the extra oil revenues are unprecedented," [...] the country announced its intention to devalue by about 8.5 percent against the U.S. dollar, set a new exchange rate and vowed to reduce the black market's influence (booming, of course, {{because of the lack of}} confidence in the rial). The Iranian Central Bank desperately tried to keep the {{value of the}} rial afloat in the midst of the late 2012 decline by pumping petrodollars into the system to allow the rial to compete against the US dollar. Efforts to control inflation rates were set forth by the government through a three-tiered-multiple-exchange-rate; this effect has failed to prevent the rise in cost of basic goods, simultaneously adding to the public's reliance on the Iranian black-market exchange rate network. Government officials attempted to stifle the black-market by offering rates 2% below the alleged black-market rates, but demand seems to be outweighing their efforts.|$|E
2500|$|Everything {{came to a}} {{standstill}} after the Islamic Revolution leading in a prohibition against interest-based activities and nationalization of major banks and industrial giants. [...] Mobilization of all resources towards the war effort during the 8-year Iran-Iraq war did not help matters. Following {{the end of the}} war, the 1988 Budget Act re-established activity on the TSE, and within eight years the exchange saw its numbers rise to 249 companies listed. The Government fully embraced economic reforms and a privatization initiative in 1989 with a surge of activity in share activity of many state-owned companies through the defined targets in the first [...] "Five-Year Economic Reform" [...] where the Government together with the Parliament defined the economic prospects of the country for the coming five years. Attention to promotion of the private sector and new interest in the TSE brought life back to the market. However, lack of regulation and out-of-date legal framework led to crisis in the market leading to certain [...] "meltdowns". Over the 1996 to 2000 period an automated trading system was introduced, and a number of important regulatory mechanisms were strengthened. The market has experienced its share of highs and lows in the past years including topping the World Federation of Exchanges' list in terms of performance in 2004. [...] As of May 2014, TSE has had three bear market in its history: August 1996-July 1998 (-32%); December 2004-July 2006 (-34%); and during the financial crisis of 2007–08 (-38%). In 2014, after reaching historic highs, TSE lost a quarter [...] of its total market capitalization because of the collapse of the <b>Iranian</b> <b>rial</b> and the slump in oil prices. It was also decided in 2014 that some banks and financial institutions attached to the government inject money into the stock market through a fund called the Market Development Fund which is aimed at market making and decreasing the fluctuations in the stock market.|$|E
