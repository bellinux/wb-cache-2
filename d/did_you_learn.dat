2500|$|Paxton's songs can be emotionally {{effective}} and cover {{a wide range}} of topics, from the serious and profound to the lighthearted and comical. [...] "What <b>Did</b> <b>You</b> <b>Learn</b> in School Today?" [...] mocks the way children are often taught nationalism and a subservience to authority. [...] "Jimmy Newman" [...] {{is the story of a}} dying soldier and [...] "My Son John" [...] is a song about a soldier who comes back home and cannot even begin to describe what he has been through. [...] "Beau John" [...] is a song derived from the Civil Rights Movement about taking a stand against racial injustice. [...] "A Thousand Years" [...] tells the tale of Neo-Nazi uprising, and [...] "Train for Auschwitz" [...] is about the Holocaust. [...] "On the Road from Srebrenica" [...] is about Bosnian Muslims who were killed in a 1995 massacre in Bosnia and Herzegovina. [...] "The Bravest" [...] is a song about the firefighters who died while trying to save others on September 11, 2001. Then there are Paxton's [...] "short shelf life songs", which are topical songs about current events and things in the news. They include: [...] "In Florida", about the 2000 election; [...] "Without DeLay", a song about the former congressman; [...] "Bobbitt", about John and Lorena Bobbitt; [...] "Little Bitty Gun", which lampoons Nancy Reagan; [...] "I'm Changing My Name to Chrysler", about the federal loan guarantee to Chrysler in 1979 (which was rewritten in 2008 as [...] "I Am Changing My Name to Fannie Mae" [...] about the 700 billion dollar [...] "bailout of the U.S. financial system"); [...] "The Ballad of Spiro Agnew" [...] (mocking the short career and the former-Vice President's resignation), and [...] "Lyndon Johnson Told the Nation" [...] (about the Vietnam War, which became [...] "George W. Told the Nation" [...] in 2007 to lampoon the 2003 invasion of Iraq).|$|E
