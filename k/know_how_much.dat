5|$|Never before have I {{written to}} {{a player to}} express my regret at his {{omission}} from the Australian XI. In your case I am making an exception because I want you to <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> my colleagues and I disliked having to make this move. Captain one match {{and out of the}} side the next looks like ingratitude, but you understand the circumstances and {{will be the first to}} admit that your form has not been good.|$|E
5|$|Romney {{opposed the}} use of {{mandatory}} limits on greenhouse gas emissions to deal with global warming. He stated that he believed climate change is occurring, but {{that he did not}} <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> of it could be linked to human activity. He was a proponent of increased domestic oil drilling, hydraulic fracturing ("fracking"), building more nuclear power plants, and reducing the regulatory authority of the Environmental Protection Agency. He believed North American energy independence could be achieved by 2020.|$|E
5|$|The {{manager and}} {{investigator}} summoned Collins {{for an interview}} and questioned her. Collins asked {{for the presence of}} a union representative several times but was refused by the manager each time. Upon questioning, Collins explained that she had put four pieces of chicken (which cost $1 total) into a larger box (one which could hold $2.98 of chicken) because the store had run out of the four-piece sized boxes. To check Collins's story, the investigator left to ask the coworker who had reported her. The coworker confirmed that the store had run out of $1 size boxes and admitted she did not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> chicken Collins had placed in the larger box. The investigator returned to the interview, apologized to Collins, and prepared to let her go.|$|E

25|$|Here's {{the deal}} these days: They {{know exactly who}} we are. They know exactly where we live. We've got a few secrets left, and we're gonna use them. But just know that the end is coming. And we don't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> longer we can do this. How much longer can we fight.|$|E
25|$|Lastly, {{there have}} been {{problems}} with droughts and pest infestations. These include the roundheaded pine beetle, European mistletoe and caterpillars. Some residents see the event as divine will but others place global warming. It is not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> of the oaks, junipers and pines that make {{up most of the}} forested areas have been compromised but there are visible yellow patches seen in the otherwise green forest. The pests have been able to infest more because trees are weak due to drought conditions.|$|E
25|$|To {{know whether}} it is ethical {{to turn off the}} {{respirator}} for a quadriplegic patient requires conceptions of personal identity, a worthy human life, murder and suicide; to <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> information a doctor must provide a cancer patient to obtain proper informed consent for an experimental therapy requires conceptions of autonomy, coercion and the public good and how to balance these values; to know whether to break the AIDS patient’s confidentiality and inform his wife requires a framework for weighing the relative importance of competing individual rights as well as the public good.|$|E
60|$|When Mrs. Cliff {{heard what}} had been said upon this subject,--and Willy Croup was {{generally}} very well able to keep her informed in regard to what {{the people of the}} town said about her,--she thought that the gossips would have been a good deal astonished if they had <b>known</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> she had really given to the church, and that they would have been absolutely amazed if they <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> Mr. Perley had received for general charities. And then she thought, with a tinge of sadness, <b>how</b> very <b>much</b> surprised Mr. Perley would have been if he had <b>known</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> more she was able to give away without feeling its loss.|$|R

25|$|The defense {{tried to}} get {{surviving}} members of the crew to admit they were in Kentucky only to photograph poor people, asking if they intended to photograph more prosperous parts of the state. The defense also wanted to <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> money they had been paid from the filming. Ison's lawyer used his closing statement to speak more about the intrusiveness of reporters than his client's actions. Nevertheless, the only legal issue was Ison's sanity. A psychiatrist testifying for the defense identified Ison as a paranoid schizophrenic, but a prosecution psychiatrist contradicted this.|$|E
25|$|In April 2016, the DC Trust, a {{government-funded}} {{entity that}} disburses grants throughout {{the district to}} non-profits providing youth services, declared bankruptcy and announced plans to fold. Bowser had recently provided $700,000 in taxpayer funding and appointed four members {{to the board of}} the organization, also known as the City Youth Investment Trust Corp. Bowser's representatives did not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> of the funding remained or how youth services could be continued. Earlier, former councilmember Harry Thomas, Jr. was found guilty on felony charges for embezzling $350,000 of the trust's funds.|$|E
25|$|On 19 April 2015 Helen Glover and Stanning won the women's pair at the British rowing trials at Caversham, {{they took}} seven minutes 36.09 seconds and {{finished}} ten seconds ahead of Jessica Eddie and Louisa Reeve, followed by Katie Greves & Zoe Lee. Glover said: We {{not only have}} great respect for each other as athletes but we are great friends on and off the water. I can genuinely say I want to win these races as much for Heather as for myself. We <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> we put into every session – it isn’t just our day job, it’s our passion.|$|E

500|$|Before Major Charles Sweeney {{took off}} on the mission, Purnell took him aside {{and asked him if}} he <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> the bomb cost. Sweeney did not know; Purnell told him it was about $2 billion. He then asked if Sweeney <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> his {{aircraft}} was worth. This Sweeney did know; over half a million dollars. Purnell then told him: [...] "I'd suggest you keep those relative values in mind for this mission." ...|$|R
25|$|There {{are a few}} {{different}} ways to properly muffle a marching bass drum. If the tuner uses generic weather-stripping type foam, start with medium density. If inexperienced or do not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> foam to apply, the person should apply it {{to the outside of}} the head after he/she has put the head onto the drum. Once drum is tuned to the right pitch, make a note of how much foam was applied for future head changes. At that time, apply the foam {{to the inside of the}} head before its placed on the drum. This provides a cleaner look to the drumhead and will protect the foam from falling from the player's beating and the environment.|$|E
25|$|It is {{frequently}} important to <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> {{of a particular}} resource (such as time or storage) is theoretically required for a given algorithm. Methods {{have been developed for}} the analysis of algorithms to obtain such quantitative answers (estimates); for example, the sorting algorithm above has a time requirement of O(n), using the big O notation with n as the length of the list. At all times the algorithm only needs to remember two values: the largest number found so far, and its current position in the input list. Therefore, it is said to have a space requirement of O(1), if the space required to store the input numbers is not counted, or O(n) if it is counted.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the high}} {{concentrations}} of non-opiate substances relative to the diamorphine content of the drug, abuse and overdose of cheese are more dangerous than pure-form opiate overdoses. Emergency personnel must address the overdose effects of each component of the drug, since the contents and concentrations of each component vary widely among batches they must wait for either {{the completion of the}} toxicology report to begin treatment or wait for the effects of each drugs overdose to manifest. The acetaminophen content of the drug induces severe, irreversible damage to the liver when taken in high doses for long periods of time. Very high doses of acetaminophen are capable of producing acute liver failure and death within hours, patients who survive this acute phase of the toxicity generally require dialysis and eventually a liver transplant. Due to the many methods of preparation a user can not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> acetaminophen is in any given batch and therefore can not reliably determine a safe dose. A dose of the last batch which produced no toxic effects may produce lethal effects in the next batch.|$|E

25|$|During these rallies, Erdoğan mainly {{went about}} {{calling for a}} presidential system and criticising the opposition, with many thus {{claiming}} that he had broken the terms of his office. Implicitly calling on voters to elect 400 AKP MPs, he criticised the opposition parties for their promises to {{raise the minimum wage}} on May Day, though it also became evident that he didn't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> it was himself. He also criticised the main opposition leader Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu for questioning his faith in the Quran and also criticised MHP leader Devlet Bahçeli for his calls for the resignation of Mehmet Görmez, the head of the Presidency of Religious Affairs. On 28 May, he made a statement criticising HDP's party lists, claiming 'we don't put forward transgender candidates!' His perceived reference to the AKP as 'we' was seen as an open disregard for neutrality. The CHP, MHP and HDP submitted formal complaints against Erdoğan's involvement in the political process on numerous occasions, but the Supreme Electoral Council refused to call off Erdoğan's rallies or issue him a warning.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{problems}} associated with water-logged and wet soils, it is important for viticulturist to <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> water is currently in the soil before deciding if and how much to irrigate. There are several methods of evaluating soil moisture. The most basic is simple observation and feeling of the soil, however this has its limitations since the subsoil may be moist while the surface soil appears dry. More specific measurements can be attained by using tensiometers which evaluates surface tension of water extracted from the soil. The presence of water in the soil can be measured by neutron moisture meters that utilize an aluminium tube with an internal neutron source that detect the subtle change between the water in the soil. Similarly, gypsum block placed throughout the vineyard contain an electrode {{that can be used to}} detect the electrical resistance that occurs as the soil dries and water is released by evaporation. Since the 1990s there has been greater research into tools utilizing time-domain reflectometry and capacitance probes. In addition to monitoring for excessive moisture, viticulturists also keep an eye for signs of water stress (discussed below) due to severe lack of water.|$|E
25|$|In 1968, Lopez-De La Cruz ran {{the first}} UFW hiring hall {{which was built}} next to the De La Cruz home. She {{collected}} membership dues, printed announcements for rallies, and distributed groceries that were donated by churches, social agencies, and private citizens. Lopez-De La Cruz also assisted farmworkers by translating for them, taking them to the doctors, writing letters, and filling out paperwork for {{those who could not}} write. In addition to her work protesting, organizing, and running the hiring hall; Lopez-De La Cruz acted as an interpreter for farm workers and often testified at hearings on farm labor, pushed for food stamps for farm workers in Fresno, pushed for bilingual education, and was eventually appointed to community and state organizations like the Fresno County Economic Opportunity Commission, the Central California Action Associates (Community education project where she taught English to Farm workers), and California’s Commission on the Status of Women. In 1966 Lopez-De La Cruz volunteered to teach farm workers practical English at the CCAA in an old building on Olive Avenue in Fresno, CA. When the CCAA got a local TV show on Fresno’s Channel 53, Lopez-De La Cruz enthusiastically taught English on the show for a short period that ended when Arnold’s truck broke down. Lopez-De La Cruz also assisted the UFW by consulting as an expert farmworker. In 1971, Delores Huerta reached out to Lopez-De La Cruz to help her negotiate a contract with Christian Brothers Wine Company. Since she was a farm worker and Huerta was not, Lopez-De La Cruz could accurately <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> work was acceptable and for what pay. In 1972 she represented the Christian Brothers Workers at the first convention of the United Farm Workers of America in Fresno.|$|E

25|$|Raising {{the price}} of carbon will achieve four goals. First, it will provide signals to {{consumers}} about what goods and services are high-carbon ones and should therefore be used more sparingly. Second, it will provide signals to producers about which inputs use more carbon (such as coal and oil) and which use less or none (such as natural gas or nuclear power), thereby inducing firms to substitute low-carbon inputs. Third, it will give market incentives for inventors and innovators to develop and introduce low-carbon products and processes that can replace {{the current generation of}} technologies. Fourth, and most important, a high carbon price will economize on the information that is required to do all three of these tasks. Through the market mechanism, a high carbon price will raise {{the price of}} products according to their carbon content. Ethical consumers today, hoping to minimize their “carbon footprint,” have little chance of making an accurate calculation of the relative carbon use in, say, driving 250 miles as compared with flying 250 miles. A harmonized carbon tax would raise the price of a good proportionately to exactly the amount of CO2 that is emitted in all the stages of production that are involved in producing that good. If 0.01 of a ton of carbon emissions results from the wheat growing and the milling and the trucking and the baking of a loaf of bread, then a tax of $30 per ton carbon will raise the price of bread by $0.30. The “carbon footprint” is automatically calculated by the price system. Consumers would still not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> of the price is due to carbon emissions, but they could make their decisions confident that they are paying for the social cost of their carbon footprint.|$|E
500|$|After {{finishing}} Lady Susan, Austen {{began her}} first full-length novel Elinor and Marianne.

[...] "We <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> these games mean to the viewing audience, our affiliated stations, and the nation's advertisers," [...] Aubrey told The New York Times.
