40|$|In {{the theory}} of measurement, there are two {{competing}} measurement frameworks, classical test theory <b>and</b> <b>item</b> response theory. The present study empirically examined, using large scale norm-referenced data, how the <b>item</b> <b>and</b> person statistics behaved under the two competing measurement frameworks. The study focused on two central themes: (1) How comparable are the <b>item</b> <b>and</b> person statistics derived from the <b>item</b> response <b>and</b> classical test framework? (2) How invariant are the item statistics from each measurement framework across examinee samples? The findings indicate that, {{in a variety of}} conditions, the two measurement frameworks produce similar <b>item</b> <b>and</b> person statistics. Furthermore, although proponents of item response theory have centered their arguments for its use on the property of invariance, classical test theory statistics, for this sample, are just as invariant...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAlthough verbal {{recall of}} <b>item</b> <b>and</b> order {{information}} is well-researched in short-term memory paradigms, there is relatively little research concerning <b>item</b> <b>and</b> order recall from working memory. The following study examined whether manipulating {{the opportunity for}} attentional refreshing and articulatory rehearsal in a complex span task differently affected the recall of item- and order-specific information of the memoranda. Five experiments varied the opportunity for articulatory rehearsal and attentional refreshing in a complex span task, but the type of recall was manipulated between experiments (<b>item</b> <b>and</b> order, order only, <b>and</b> <b>item</b> only recall). The results showed that impairing attentional refreshing and articulatory rehearsal similarly affected recall {{regardless of whether the}} scoring procedure (Experiments 1 and 4) or recall requirements (Experiments 2, 3, and 5) reflected item- or order-specific recall. This implies that both mechanisms sustain the maintenance of <b>item</b> <b>and</b> order information, and suggests that the common cumulative functioning of these two mechanisms to maintain items could be at the root of order maintenance...|$|R

5|$|If the player's {{character}} {{falls in}} battle, {{they are forced}} to restart from the beginning, with all their <b>items</b> <b>and</b> experience points gone; to avoid this, the player can store items in warehouses found in towns they travel through. Because of this, the player makes long-term progress by upgrading powerful items at village blacksmiths and storing them in warehouses, while upgrading their character is more of a temporary improvement. In the Nintendo DS version of the game, the player can avoid having to start over by getting rescued by another player: this is done by giving the other player a rescue quest, either through a password or the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. When a player embarks on a rescue mission, they start from level 1 and have to reach the fallen character without stopping at towns on their way. If they succeed, the rescued player can proceed from where they left off, and keep their <b>items</b> <b>and</b> experience points.|$|E
