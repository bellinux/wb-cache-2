2500|$|The Butterworth Squadron was a British {{commercial}} {{group of}} three vessels, Butterworth, Jackal, and Prince Lee Boo, [...] that sailed for the Pacific Ocean from London via Cape Horn in late 1791. The principals financing the expedition were Alderman William Curtis, London ship-owner Theophilus Pritzler, and probably John Perry, a Blackwall shipbuilder. The leader of the expedition was Captain William Brown, an established whaling captain from the <b>Greenland</b> <b>whale</b> fishery. Sigismund Bacstrom, a naturalist who had previously sailed as a secretary to Sir Joseph Banks, was the surgeon for the expedition. Bacstrom produced a number of drawings during {{the first part of}} the voyage, some of which are still in existence.|$|E
2500|$|The {{traditional}} {{folk music}} of Jersey was common in country areas until the mid-20th century. It cannot {{be separated from}} the musical traditions of continental Europe, and the majority of songs and tunes that have been documented have close parallels or variants, particularly in France. Most of the surviving traditional songs are in French, with a minority in Jèrriais. The majority of [...] Jèrriais-language songs are composed pieces dating from the 19th and 20th centuries, and not of folk origin. Research conducted in the 20th century also revealed the existence of folk songs in English (e.g. [...] "The <b>Greenland</b> <b>Whale</b> Fishery", [...] "Died for Love".) Only one folk song is believed to be of specifically Jersey provenance with no variants collected elsewhere: [...] "La Chanson de Peirson".|$|E
60|$|There is a {{particular}} spot in those wild regions which lie somewhere near the northern parts of Baffin's Bay, where Nature seems to have set up her workshop for the manufacture of icebergs, where Polar bears, in company with seals and <b>Greenland</b> <b>whales,</b> are wont to gambol, and where the family of Jack Frost {{may be said to}} have taken permanent possession of the land.|$|R

2500|$|Butterworth was {{launched}} in 1778 in France as the highly successful 32-gun privateer Américaine, of Granville. The British Royal Navy captured her early in 1781. She first appeared in a commercial role in 1784 as America, and was renamed in 1785 as Butterworth. She served primarily as a whaler in the <b>Greenland</b> <b>whale</b> fisheries. New owners purchased her in 1789. She underwent a great repair in 1791 that increased her size by almost 20%. She is most famous {{for her role in}} the [...] "Butterworth Squadron", which took her and two ship's tenders on an exploration, sealing, otter fur, and whaling voyage to Alaska and the Pacific Coast of North America. She and her consorts are widely credited with being the first European vessels to enter, in 1794, what is now Honolulu harbour. After her return to England in 1795, Butterworth went on three more whaling voyages to the South Pacific, then Africa, and then the South Pacific again. In 1802 she was outward bound on her fourth of these voyage, this to the South Pacific, when she was lost.|$|E
2500|$|Music {{performers}} with {{no strong}} links to maritime music have interpreted traditional shanty and sea song compositions, of which widely scattered instances abound. For example, the bawdy sea song [...] "Frigging in the Rigging" [...] was {{recorded by the}} punk band Sex Pistols. Perhaps {{under the influence of}} Irish Folk Revival groups like The Clancy Brothers and The Dubliners, who included some shanties in their repertoires, some association has also been formed between shanties and Irish music. And so, looking back to these performers, later Irish-oriented rock groups like The Pogues interpreted traditional shanties and sea songs like [...] "South Australia" [...] and [...] "The <b>Greenland</b> <b>Whale</b> Fisheries." [...] A notable instance where many non-maritime music performers tackled the traditional maritime repertoire stems from the actor Johnny Depp's reported interest in shanties that developed while filming Pirates of the Caribbean. As a result, in 2006 Depp helped facilitate [...] A medley of sea songs performed by concert orchestra, Sir Henry Wood's Fantasia on British Sea Songs, is a popular component of the Last Night of the Proms in Britain.|$|E
6000|$|Of {{the names}} in {{this list of}} whale authors only those {{following}} Owen ever saw living whales; and {{but one of them}} was a real professional harpooneer and whaleman. I mean Captain Scoresby. On the separate subject of the Greenland or right-whale, he is the best existing authority. But Scoresby knew nothing and says nothing of the great sperm whale, compared with which the <b>Greenland</b> <b>whale</b> is almost unworthy mentioning. And here be it said, that the <b>Greenland</b> <b>whale</b> is an usurper upon the throne of the seas. He is not even by any means the largest of the whales. Yet, owing to the long priority of his claims, and the profound ignorance which till some seventy years back, invested the then fabulous and utterly unknown sperm-whale, and which ignorance to this present day still reigns in all but some few scientific retreats and whale-ports; this usurpation has been every way complete. Reference to nearly all the leviathanic allusions in the great poets of past days, will satisfy you that the <b>Greenland</b> <b>whale,</b> without one rival, was to them the monarch of the seas. But the time has at last come for a new proclamation. This is Charing Cross; hear ye! good people all,--the <b>Greenland</b> <b>whale</b> is deposed,-- the great sperm whale now reigneth! ...|$|E
40|$|After a {{relatively}} late {{discovery of the}} island, Dutch whalers used Jan Mayen {{as a base for}} their whaling industry. They built stations on the west coast of the island where they rendered whale oil from the blubber of the <b>Greenland</b> right <b>whales.</b> Altogether the whalers stayed for twenty-two years on Jan Mayen. In this period, approximately 1000 <b>Greenland</b> right <b>whales</b> (Balaena mysticetus) were killed and processed on the island leaving much uneaten plankton behind in the sea. Plankton-eating birds must have taken advantage of the situation and {{it is likely that the}} number of seabird rookeries on Jan Mayen increased. The combination of written sources and field data makes Jan Mayen a very challenging island for research...|$|R
50|$|There {{are also}} a number of more {{unconventional}} applications. These include using a modified pneumatic line thrower as an air gun to tag or attach transmitters to whales. This technique {{has been used in}} several studies: bowhead <b>whales</b> off West <b>Greenland,</b> minke <b>whales</b> off northern Norway, and a collision study of humpback whales off Panama.|$|R
5000|$|Historically, Fram Strait {{was home}} to a large {{population}} of Bowhead whales, then called the <b>Greenland</b> right <b>whale.</b> By mid-17th century, the Svalbard population of Bowhead whales was reduced to near extinction by excessive whaling (See also: Whaling in Spitsbergen; Smeerenburg). [...] Western Fram Strait may be a wintering ground for this Critically Endangered population.|$|R

60|$|Then, again, in 1825, Bernard Germain, Count de Lacepede, a great naturalist, {{published}} a scientific systemized whale book, wherein are several {{pictures of the}} different species of the Leviathan. All these are not only incorrect, but {{the picture of the}} Mysticetus or <b>Greenland</b> <b>whale</b> (that is to say the Right whale), even Scoresby, a long experienced man as touching that species, declares not to have its counterpart in nature.|$|E
40|$|During the 17 th and 18 th centuries, tens of {{thousands}} of <b>Greenland</b> right <b>whales</b> were killed as a result of extensive European whaling in the coastal waters of the Svalbard archipelago. The author reconstructed these whaling activities, examined how the changing climate affected whaling productivity, and considered the consequences of climate and whaling on the species and on the North Atlantic ecosystem. Annual catch records made it possible to calculate the original size of the whale population; its natural migration pattern in the Greenland Sea could be reconstructed using shipping logs and itineraries. Other written sources revealed that besides human hunting activities, climate change {{played an important role in}} the elimination of the <b>Greenland</b> right <b>whale</b> from the Arctic marine ecosystem. This elimination made millions of plankton available for other marine mammals, polar cod and plankton-feeding birds. This has caused a major shift in the food web, changing the marine ecosystem in Svalbard...|$|R
50|$|Sea mammals provide {{important}} staples to Greenlandic diets. A traditional Inuit specialty is mattak, a Greenlandic {{term for the}} raw hide of narwhal or white whale. Mattak can be prepared with blubber, and occasionally dried reindeer meat. When eaten raw, mattak is {{an important source of}} vitamin C. Hunting hooded seals were traditionally an important annual social event as well as subsistence activity, which included men, women, and children. Also popular is arfivik, or bowhead whale, smoked whale meat served with onions and potato. Dried cod and whale with whale blubber is a popular lunch and snack food. Bearded and ringed seals are hunted year round, especially by Polar Inuit, while narwhals and white whales are hunting during the summer. Subsistence whale hunting by indigenous peoples is legal, but some animal rights organizations are concerned about commercial <b>whale</b> hunting in <b>Greenland,</b> with one company, Arctic Green Food freezing and distributing a quarter of <b>Greenland's</b> <b>whale</b> meat.|$|R
40|$|The {{framework}} {{developed during}} the 2015 Annual Meeting of the Scientific Committee to evaluate an ‘interim allowance’ strategy is applied to West <b>Greenland</b> humpback <b>whales</b> based on the agreed Strike Limit Algorithm for these whales. The values for the ‘mandatory’ performance statistics for the ‘phase-out’ and ‘interim allowance’ strategy suggest that adopting the ‘interim allowance’ strategy has no substantial impact on risk, but leads to a better ability satisfy need and to lower interannual variation in strike limits...|$|R
60|$|The <b>Greenland</b> <b>whale</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{wonderful}} animals in the world, and the baleen, or whalebone, one of its greatest peculiarities. The baleen consists of a row, on each side of the upper jaw, of about 300 plates or laminae, which stand close together transversely to the longer axis of the mouth. Within the main row there are some subsidiary rows. The extremities and inner margins of all the plates are frayed into stiff bristles, which clothe the whole gigantic palate, and serve to strain or sift the water, and thus to secure the minute prey on which these great animals subsist. The middle and longest lamina in the <b>Greenland</b> <b>whale</b> is ten, twelve, or even fifteen feet in length; but in the different species of Cetaceans there are gradations in length; the middle lamina being in one species, according to Scoresby, four feet, in another three, in another eighteen inches, and in the Balaenoptera rostrata only about nine inches in length. The quality of the whalebone also differs in the different species.|$|E
60|$|Some {{pretend to}} see a {{difference}} between the <b>Greenland</b> <b>whale</b> of the English and the right whale of the Americans. But they precisely agree in all their grand features; nor has there yet been presented a single determinate fact upon which to ground a radical distinction. It is by endless subdivisions based upon the most inconclusive differences, that some departments of natural history become so repellingly intricate. The right whale will be elsewhere treated of at some length, with reference to elucidating the sperm whale.|$|E
60|$|Of {{course the}} noise of their cries and {{evolutions}} would have been great had not distance lent enchantment to sound as well as view. To Leo there seemed even a sort of restfulness in {{the voices of the}} innumerable wild-fowl. They were so far off, most of them, that the sounds fell on his ear like a gentle plaint, and even the thunderous plash of the great <b>Greenland</b> <b>whale</b> was reduced by distance to a ripple like that which fell on the shore at his feet.|$|E
6000|$|So {{much for}} theory. Now for facts {{that have been}} observed, and that tend, more or less, to corroborate this {{proposition}} of an open polar sea. The habits of the whale have gone far to prove it. The log-books of whalers have for many years been carefully examined and compared by scientific men. These investigations {{have led to the}} discovery [...] "that the tropical regions of the ocean are to the `right' whale as a sea of fire, through which he cannot pass, and into which he never enters." [...] It has also been ascertained that the same kind of whale which is found off the shores of Greenland, in Baffin's Bay, etcetera, is found in the North Pacific, and about Behring's Straits; and that the `right' whale of the southern hemisphere is a different animal from that of the northern. How, then, came the <b>Greenland</b> <b>whales</b> to pass from the Greenland seas to the Pacific? Not by the Capes Horn or Good Hope; the [...] "sea of fire" [...] precluded that. Clearly there was ground here for concluding that they did so through the (supposed) open sea lying beyond, or rather within, the frozen ocean.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} two SLAs for West <b>Greenland</b> fin <b>whales</b> {{which are}} variants of SLAs {{that have been}} previously reported. Candidate SLAs are presented ranging from providing complete satisfaction of the conservation performance criterion for all evaluation trials with MSYR 1 + of 1 %, to an alternative that sacrifices performance on this count to increasing extents for improved need satisfaction. Need is satisfied over the first 20 years, but not over 100 years for the two SLAs in these trials...|$|R
2500|$|Ringed seal are an {{important}} food item in particular for polar bears.

60|$|According to {{a careful}} {{calculation}} I have made, and which I partly base upon Captain Scoresby's estimate, of seventy tons {{for the largest}} sized <b>Greenland</b> <b>whale</b> of sixty feet in length; according to my careful calculation, I say, a Sperm Whale of the largest magnitude, between eighty-five and ninety feet in length, and something less than forty feet in its fullest circumference, such a whale will weigh at least ninety tons; so that, reckoning thirteen men to a ton, he would considerably outweigh the combined population of a whole village of one thousand one hundred inhabitants.|$|E
60|$|But it may {{possibly}} be conceived that, {{in the internal}} parts of the whale, in his anatomy--there, at least, we shall be able to hit the right classification. Nay; what thing, for example, is there in the Greenland whale's anatomy more striking than his baleen? Yet {{we have seen that}} by his baleen it is impossible correctly to classify the <b>Greenland</b> <b>whale.</b> And if you descend into the bowels of the various leviathans, why there you will not find distinctions a fiftieth part as available to the systematizer as those external ones already enumerated. What then remains? nothing but to take hold of the whales bodily, in their entire liberal volume, and boldly sort them that way. And this is the Bibliographical system here adopted; and it {{is the only one that}} can possibly succeed, for it alone is practicable. To proceed.|$|E
6000|$|When {{within range}} this weapon {{commenced}} firing. It was absolutely horrible. One man turned a handle at the breech, another kept supplying the self-acting cartridge-box. As the handle was turned the cartridges dropped into their places and exploded. Six or nine tubes, I forget which, were thus made to rain bullets without intermission. They {{fell on the}} screen of the advancing torpedo-boat like hail, but quite harmlessly. Then I heard a voice within the fore-turret give a command which sounded like [...] "Extreme depression." [...] It was quickly followed by [...] "Fire!" [...] and the Thunderer quivered from keel to truck under the mighty explosion. The great 38-ton gun had been splendidly served, for the monster ball hit the boat amidships and crushed the bow under water, {{at the same instant}} the stern leaped into the air, and she went down with a dive like a <b>Greenland</b> <b>whale.</b>|$|E
50|$|A stocky dark-colored whale {{without a}} dorsal fin, it can grow 14 to 18 m in length. This thick-bodied species can weigh from 75 to 100 t.

60|$|Gurry, so called, {{is a term}} {{properly}} {{belonging to}} right whalemen, but sometimes incidentally used by the sperm fishermen.

6000|$|BOOK I. (Folio), CHAPTER II. (Right Whale).--In {{one respect}} {{this is the}} most venerable of the leviathans, being the one first {{regularly}} hunted by man. It yields the article commonly known as whalebone or baleen; and the oil specially known as [...] "whale oil," [...] an inferior article in commerce. Among the fishermen, he is indiscriminately designated by all the following titles: The Whale; the Greenland Whale; the Black Whale; the Great Whale; the True Whale; the Right Whale. There is a deal of obscurity concerning the Identity of the species thus multitudinously baptized. What then is the whale, which I include in the second species of my Folios? It is the Great Mysticetus of the English naturalists; the <b>Greenland</b> <b>Whale</b> of the English Whalemen; the Baliene Ordinaire of the French whalemen; the Growlands Walfish of the Swedes. It is the whale which for more than two centuries past has been hunted by the Dutch and English in the Arctic seas; it is the whale which the American fishermen have long pursued in the Indian ocean, on the Brazil Banks, on the Nor' West Coast, and various other parts of the world, designated by them Right Whale Cruising Grounds.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course there}} is. It {{has long been}} known that the Greenland Eskimos have a {{tradition}} of an island in an iceless sea, lying away in the far north, where there are many musk-oxen, and, from what I have been told by our friend Chingatok, I am disposed to think that he and his kindred inhabit this island, or group of islands, in the Polar basin--not far, perhaps, from the Pole itself. He says there are musk-oxen there. But there is another creature, and a much bigger one than any Eskimo, bigger even than Chingatok, who bears his testimony to an open Polar sea, namely, the <b>Greenland</b> <b>whale.</b> It has been ascertained that the `right' whale does not, and cannot, enter the tropical regions of the Ocean. They are to him as a sea of fire, a wall of adamant, so that it is impossible for him to swim south, double Cape Horn, and proceed to the North Pacific; yet the very same kind of whale found in Baffin's Bay is found at Behring Straits. Now, the question is, how did he get there?" ...|$|E
6000|$|In {{connexion}} {{with this}} appellative of [...] "Whalebone whales," [...] {{it is of}} great importance to mention, that however such a nomenclature may be convenient in facilitating allusions {{to some kind of}} whales, yet it is in vain to attempt a clear classification of the Leviathan, founded upon either his baleen, or hump, or fin, or teeth; notwithstanding that those marked parts or features very obviously seem better adapted to afford the basis for a regular system of Cetology than any other detached bodily distinctions, which the whale, in his kinds, presents. How then? The baleen, hump, back-fin, and teeth; these are things whose peculiarities are indiscriminately dispersed among all sorts of whales, without any regard to what may be the nature of their structure in other and more essential particulars. Thus, the sperm whale and the humpbacked whale, each has a hump; but there the similitude ceases. Then this same humpbacked whale and the <b>Greenland</b> <b>whale,</b> each of these has baleen; but there again the similitude ceases. And it is just the same with the other parts above mentioned. In various sorts of whales, they form such irregular combinations; or, in the case of any one of them detached, such an irregular isolation; as utterly to defy all general methodization formed upon such a basis. On this rock every one of the whale-naturalists has split.|$|E
5000|$|Balaenidae [...] is {{a family}} of whales of the parvorder Mysticeti that {{contains}} two living genera. Historically, it {{is known as the}} right whale family, as it was thought to contain only species of right whales. Through most of the 20th Century, however, that became a much-debated (and unresolved) topic amongst the scientific community. Finally, in the early 2000s, science reached a definitive conclusion: the bowhead whale, once commonly known as the <b>Greenland</b> right <b>whale,</b> was not in fact a right whale. [...] The family of Balaenids, therefore, comprises the right whales (genus Eubalaena), and in a genus all to its own, the very closely related bowhead whale (genus Balaena).|$|R
5|$|Whaling {{decreased}} substantially after 1946 when, {{in response}} to the steep decline in whale populations, the International Whaling Commission placed a moratorium which set a catch limit for each country; this excluded aboriginal groups up until 2004. As of 2015, aboriginal communities are allowed to take 280 bowhead whales off Alaska and two from the western coast of <b>Greenland,</b> 620 grey <b>whales</b> off Washington state, three common minke whales off the eastern coast of Greenland and 178 on their western coast, 10 fin whales from the west coast of <b>Greenland,</b> nine humpback <b>whales</b> from the west coast of Greenland and 20 off St. Vincent and the Grenadines each year. Several species that were commercially exploited have rebounded in numbers; for example, grey whales may be as numerous as they were prior to harvesting, but the North Atlantic population is functionally extinct. Conversely, the North Atlantic right whale was extirpated from much of its former range, which stretched across the North Atlantic, and only remains in small fragments along the coast of Canada, Greenland, and is considered functionally extinct along the European coastline.|$|R

However, a simulation test of the method suggests that it provides positively biased estimates of this lower 5 percentile, with the true value for the specific case investigated being some 17 000 rather than 27 000...|$|R
