We show that some popular methods, for instance, Carr-Madan's FFT method could blow up for certain values of the model parameters even for an European vanilla option. Alternative methods - one originally proposed by Lewis, and Black-Scholes-wise method are considered that seem to work fine for any value of the VG parameters. Test examples are given to demonstrate efficiency of these methods. Convergency of all methods is also discussed. }...|$|E

However, unlike their continuous counterparts, discrete barrier and lookback options essentially have no analytical solution. For a broad class of models, including the classical Brownian model and jump-diffusion models, {{we show that}} the Laplace transforms of discrete barrier and lookback options can be obtained via a recursion involving only analytical formulae of stand-ard European call and put options, thanks to Spitzer’s formula. The Laplace transforms can be numerically inverted to <b>get</b> <b>option</b> prices fast and accurately. Furthermore, the same method {{can be used to}} compute the hedging parameters (the greeks) of these products. ...|$|E

40|$|Given {{the quote}} {{price of a}} call or put option, the Black-Scholes implied {{volatility}} is the unique volatility parameter {{to be put into}} Black-Scholes formula to give the same price as the option quote price. This dissertation is concerned with the link between the implied volatility and the actual volatility of the underlying stock. Such a link is of particular practical interest since it relates the fundamental quantity for pricing financial derivatives (the actual volatility of the underlying stock), which is not observable, to directly observable quantities such as implied volatilities. The link that we derive in chapter 2 is a link between the dynamics of the two quantities. So far these quantities were mostly studied at a given time whereas we work at the level of processes. This is the main result of the dissertation. In chapter 1, we shall first review current practical problems in option pricing. Our aim there is twofold. First, we want to show that from a practical point of view, studying dynamics is very natural. Second, we shall identify two practical issues to which we shall propose answers in chapter 3. Although the main motivation of this dissertation comes from contemporary issues in the study of financial markets, chapter 2 also gives a solution to an inverse problem in the mathematical sense. One wishes to recover the structure of a stochastic process from a family of conditional expectations over its distribution. Besides the main result, this dissertation makes the following contributions. It brings new insights about implied volatility dynamics. In particular, it was observed that its motion was extremely ‘rigid ’ {{in the sense that the}} motion of a specific point determines the entire surface dynamics. This statement will be made more precise. Second, it provides with simple closed form approximations for implied volatilities. These approximations avoid having to compute expectations to <b>get</b> <b>option</b> prices. Third, this dissertation gives qualitative and quantitative understanding of common models used in practice. ii...|$|E
