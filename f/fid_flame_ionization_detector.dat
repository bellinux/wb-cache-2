The RGD- 2 {{is found to be}} capable of subpicomole detection for these carbonyls and is more sensitive than an <b>FID</b> (<b>Flame</b> <b>Ionization</b> <b>Detector)</b> by an order of magnitude. Operating parameters can be further optimized to make the RGD- 2 some 20 - 40 times more sensitive than an FID.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, a {{comparison}} of the biofuels barrier properties of PolyAmide 6 (PA 6) and High Density PolyEthylene (HDPE) is presented. Model fuels were prepared as mixtures of toluene, isooctane and ethanol, the ethanol volume fraction varying between 0 % and 100 %. Barrier properties were determined at 40 C by gravimetric techniques or gas chromatography measurements, and it was shown that polyamide 6 permeability is lower than that of polyethylene {{on a wide range of}} ethanol contents up to 85 % of ethanol (E 85) in the biofuel, permeability of PA 6 being 100 times lower than that of HDPE for low ethanol content fuels (E 5, E 0). The time-lags were also compared, and on the whole range of ethanol contents, HDPE permeation kinetics appears to be much faster than that of PA 6, the time lag for a 1 mm thick specimens in presence of E 10 being 50 days for PA 6 and 0. 5 days for HDPE. The compositions of the solvent fluxes were analyzed by <b>FID</b> (<b>Flame</b> <b>Ionization</b> <b>Detector)</b> gas chromatography, and it turned out that the solvent flux was mainly made up of ethanol (minimum 95 %) in the case of PA 6, whereas in the case of HDPE, sol-vent flux was mainly made up of hydrocarbons. The implication of this difference in the solvent flux composition is discussed in the present article, and a side effect called the “fuel exhaustion process ” is presented. The influence of the sample thickness was then studied, and for the different biofuels com...|$|E
