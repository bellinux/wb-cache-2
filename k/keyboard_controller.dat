5|$|The Nord Stage is multitimbral – {{each of the}} Piano, Organ, and Synth {{sections}} {{can sound}} independently. There are two Panels – A and B – each of which provides a separate configuration of the three sections within a single Program. Panels can be played independently, {{with one of the}} panels being controlled via an external MIDI <b>keyboard</b> <b>controller,</b> or they can be layered together, allowing for a maximum of 6 part multitimbral. Most of the buttons and knobs on the Stage, such as volume, instrument selection, drawbar levels (for organ) or filter controls (for synthesizer) can also be adjusted by the external keyboard.|$|E
25|$|Rock Band 3 {{introduced}} keyboard {{parts for}} songs {{for the first}} time in a rhythm game. MadCatz produced the new <b>keyboard</b> <b>controller</b> for the official release which resembles a keytar with a handle to one side; this allows it to be either worn using a guitar strap or placed on a horizontal surface. The keyboard features 25 full-sized velocity-sensitive keys, and is MIDI compatible, allowing it to be used outside the game. For instance, Freezepop, a band which has close ties to members of Harmonix, has used the <b>keyboard</b> <b>controller</b> as a keytar for their stage shows.|$|E

The cartridge {{was not a}} game, but rather a diagnostic tool that Dodgson hoped to persuade Atari Corp to market to customers interested in programming their own Atari 7800 games. As Atari no longer manufactured the <b>keyboard</b> <b>controller</b> required by the cartridge, they declined, so Dodgson decided to manufacture and market the cartridge on his own.|$|E
25|$|All {{existing}} Rock Band {{and other}} compatible controllers {{continue to work}} for Basic mode. Basic guitar controllers {{can also be used}} to play Basic keyboard parts after unlocking the ability to do so in-game, while the <b>keyboard</b> <b>controller</b> can also in turn be used to play Basic guitar and bass parts without requiring the feature to be unlocked. A special MIDI adapter, also made by MadCatz and sold separately, allows players with existing MIDI-compatible keyboards, or drums to use them within the game; the unit will not work for most existing MIDI guitars due to the additional data that Harmonix registers over the MIDI data. In April 2010, Harmonix and game controller manufacturer Mad Catz entered a multi-year deal to allow Mad Catz to produce and sell its controllers alongside the Rock Band games.|$|E

Eurogamer's Johnny Minkley called it [...] "strong and varied", and noted the {{contrast}} {{between it and the}} heavier style of [...] Will Tuttle of GameSpy praised it as being [...] "the most diverse track list in the franchise's history." [...] G4 TV's Stephen Johnson noted that the addition of the <b>keyboard</b> <b>controller</b> led to the setlist having a more pop-oriented style than the previous games in the series, and he said that Harmonix chose [...] "substance ... over flashy, current bands." [...] Reviewer Ben Kuchera, of Ars Technica, also praised the setlist's variety, stating that it is [...] "one of the best you'll see in rhythm games, spanning decades and genres and bringing a wide variety of songs to suit any taste." [...] In his review of the game in The Atlantic, Sam Machkovech summed up the setlist by saying that [...] "with keyboards are in [...] the mix, the songs are just plain better." ...|$|E
500|$|ZX Spectrum {{magazine}} Crash considered Underwurlde to be [...] "excellent" [...] and Ultimate's best game.

Another reviewer compared Sabreman's jump {{to that of}} Bugaboo (The Flea) and added that the game's single difficulty level was adequately balanced. All three Crash critics noted that the QWERT <b>keyboard</b> <b>controller</b> mapping worked well in this game, though it was awkward in others. They also praised Underwurlde detailed graphics and sound. One reviewer additionally noticed that the game lacked a score leaderboard, but surmised {{that this was a}} trade-off for the game's expansive world. Unlike Crash, Computer and Video Games did not like the controls, which was the reviewer's main criticism of the game. Another ZX Spectrum reviewer, Chris Bourne (Sinclair User), said that the game was fast, colourful, and akin to a [...] "vertical Atic Atac".|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to the standalone game and controllers, Harmonix and MadCatz released a Rock Band 3 bundle package which includes the Basic/Pro RB3 <b>keyboard</b> <b>controller</b> and the game. Licensing prevented this bundle from being sold to PlayStation 3 users in the United States, but Harmonix worked with vendors to offer a [...] "soft bundle" [...] of the standalone game and keyboard at the same cost as the bundle, and to honor existing pre-orders for the bundle.|$|E
2500|$|Diodes {{are also}} used in {{electronic}} musical keyboards. To {{reduce the amount of}} wiring needed in electronic musical keyboards, these instruments often use keyboard matrix circuits. The <b>keyboard</b> <b>controller</b> scans the rows and columns to determine which note the player has pressed. The problem with matrix circuits is that, when several notes are pressed at once, the current can flow backwards through the circuit and trigger [...] "phantom keys" [...] that cause [...] "ghost" [...] notes to play. To avoid triggering unwanted notes, most keyboard matrix circuits have diodes soldered with the switch under each key of the musical keyboard. The same principle is also used for the switch matrix in solid-state pinball machines.|$|E
2500|$|Harmonix {{included}} the <b>keyboard</b> <b>controller</b> to help address these goals. The keyboard functionality was [...] "designed basically {{to answer that}} staleness factor" [...] that has been seen in music games, as said by Sussman. The gameplay for Basic keys was designed {{so that it was}} party-accessible, simple, and easy for existing Rock Band players to learn. Pro keys, on the other hand, was designed so that it would be fun playing the accurate actual notes of the song. The team also included Pro mode to help invigorate existing players to give them new challenges, aimed at those that [...] "had any aspirations of connecting with the music in a deeper way", according to senior designer Sylvain Dubrofsky. Sussman commented that the combination of existing and new gameplay modes provides [...] "an experience that is both accessible to players who are just getting into this thing, and builds something for the hard-core player who is maybe a little bored with where music games are". Sussman noted that there still remains a large gap between mastering the Pro modes and playing real instruments: [...] "We see Pro as a different experience from the five-button simulation, but not necessarily a track to expertise." [...] Sussman further commented that inclusion of Pro mode, particularly at higher difficulty levels, was [...] "because it shows the potential ceiling of where this can take you". However, Harmonix was still dedicated to helping to [...] "open doors" [...] for players interested in learning real musical instruments, such as by including appropriate music fundamentals that can be used outside of the game. Harmonix created the Pro Guitar charts for songs through careful audio interpretation of master tracks and through watching live performances of the songs to ensure they were using the correct chords.|$|E
