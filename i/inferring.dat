5|$|Instead, he practised a {{different}} style of science: systematically gathering data, discovering patterns common to whole groups of animals, and <b>inferring</b> possible causal explanations from these. This style is common in modern biology when large amounts of data become available in a new field, such as genomics. It does not result in the same certainty as experimental science, but it sets out testable hypotheses and constructs a narrative explanation of what is observed. In this sense, Aristotle's biology is scientific.|$|E
5|$|Specialised {{terms are}} used in taxonomic research. Primary {{homology}} is the initial hypothesis made by a researcher based on similar structure or anatomical connections, <b>inferring</b> that two characters share an ancestry. Secondary homology is implied by parsimony analysis, where a character that only occurs once on a tree is taken to be homologous. As implied in this definition, many cladists consider homology to be synonymous with synapomorphy, a shared derived character or trait state that distinguishes a clade from other organisms.|$|E

40|$|To solve tasks {{concerning}} distances along a route, between locations which {{cannot be}} perceived {{from a single}} vantage point, people and other cognitive agents must generate <b>inferred</b> route distances. <b>Inferred</b> route distances, and <b>inferred</b> distances in general, are {{a special kind of}} subjective distances: <b>Inferred</b> distances cannot be retrieved from memory, but have to be <b>inferred</b> from several pieces of knowledge about distances whicheachhave been perceived from a single vantage point. What is the information content of <b>inferred</b> route distances, and how are they <b>inferred?</b> In this context, an important question is in what sense they, like other central concepts of spatial cognition, are qualitative, and in what sense they are quantitative. To answer these questions, the present study relates dierent theories of subjective distances to one another, anditdevelops a computational model of <b>inferred</b> route distances. It thereby aims to integrate research from arti cial intelligence, in particular Qualitative Spatial Reasoning, and cognitive psychology...|$|R

The <b>inferred</b> specific evidential is a recent innovation and has been ascribed to the influence of Tucano.

Functional imaging can measure cerebral blood flow or metabolism, <b>inferring</b> neuronal activity in specific regions and potentially helping to predict outcome.

40|$|People rely {{extensively}} on inference {{as a source}} of information, and sometimes they confuse inference with observation. Specifically, <b>inferred</b> information is sometimes mistaken for observed information. Such confusion of inference with observation can be problematic, especially if the <b>inferred</b> information is erroneous. One factor that might affect the probability of mistaking inference for observation is the degree of consistency between <b>inferred</b> information and subsequently encountered information. The present research was designed to test this possibility. In three experiments subjects made inferences on the basis of presented information, and then were given additional information that was varied in consistency with the information they had <b>inferred.</b> Finally, subjects were tested for accuracy in discriminating the source (inference vs. observation) of the <b>inferred</b> information. As expected, accuracy was lower when subsequently presented information was relatively consistent with <b>inferred</b> information than when it was relatively inconsistent with <b>inferred</b> information. This effect did not vary with delay between making an inference and attempting to discriminate information source. It is concluded that consistency of <b>inferred</b> information with subsequently encountered information can affect the probability of mistaking inference for observation, with the probability of error increasing as consistency increases...|$|R

40|$|The use of {{multicast}} traffic as measurement probes {{is effective}} to <b>infer</b> network-internal characteristics. In this paper, we propose novel approaches to <b>infer</b> multicast network topology and link loss performance from end-to-end measurements. First, {{we present a}} new algorithm, binary hamming distance classification algorithm (BHC), that identifies multicast network topology based on the hamming distance of the sequences on receipt/loss of probe packets maintained at each pair of nodes. It is proved by analysis and simulation that BHC can <b>infer</b> the topology at a higher accuracy and efficiency than the previous algorithms with {{a finite number of}} probe packets. We also propose a new statistical approach to <b>infer</b> network-internal link loss performance based on the <b>inferred</b> topology. The <b>inferred</b> link loss rate is proved to be consistent with the real loss rate as the number of probe packets tends to infinity. Our new approach makes it possible to <b>infer</b> multicast network topology and loss performance simultaneously. We extend our algorithms for both multicast topology and loss performance inference in binary trees to general trees, and present a new method of loss rate-based scheme for general tree topology inference so that the <b>inferred</b> topology can correctly converge to the true topology which was difficult to achieve previously.
