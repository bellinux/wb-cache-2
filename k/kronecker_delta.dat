40|$|We {{present an}} {{improved}} {{form of the}} integration technique known as NDIM (Negative Dimensional Integration Method), which is a powerful tool in the analytical evaluation of Feynman diagrams. Using this technique we study a φ 3 ⊕ φ 4 theory in D = 4 − 2 ǫ dimensions, considering generic topologies of L loops and E independent external momenta, and where the propagator powers are arbitrary. The method transforms the Schwinger parametric integral associated to the diagram into a multiple series expansion, whose main characteristic is that the argument contains several <b>Kronecker</b> <b>deltas</b> which appear naturally {{in the application of}} the method, and which we call diagram presolution. The optimization we present here consists in a procedure that minimizes the series multiplicity, through appropriate factorizations in the multinomials that appear in the parametric integral, and which maximizes the number of <b>Kronecker</b> <b>deltas</b> that are generated in the process. The solutions are presented in terms of generalized hypergeometric functions, obtained once the <b>Kronecker</b> <b>deltas</b> have been used in the series. Although the technique is general, we apply it to cases in which there are 2 or 3 different energy scales (masses or kinematic variables associated to the external momenta), obtaining solutions in terms of a finite sum of generalized hypergeometric series de 1 and 2 variables respectively, each of them expressible as ratios between the different energy scales that characterize the topology. The main result is a method capable of solving Feynman integrals, expressing the solutions as hypergeometric series of multiplicity (n − 1), where n is the number of energy scales present in the diagram...|$|R
500|$|In {{science and}} mathematics, the Dirac delta function, or [...] function, is a {{generalized}} function, or distribution that was historically {{introduced by the}} physicist Paul Dirac for modelling the density of an idealized point mass or point charge, as a function that is equal to zero everywhere except for zero and whose integral over the entire real line is equal to one. As there is no function that has these properties, the computations that were done by the theoretical physicists appeared to mathematicians as nonsense, until the introduction of distributions by Laurent Schwartz, for formalizing and validating mathematically these computations. This amounts, in particular, to define Dirac delta function as a linear functional, which maps every function to its value at zero. The <b>Kronecker</b> <b>delta</b> function, which is usually defined on a discrete domain and takes values 0 and 1, is a discrete analog of Dirac delta function.|$|E

In the element-free Galerkin method, the implementation of the Moving Least Squares (MLS) approximation is used to obtain the approximation function and the transformation method is proposed to impose the essential boundary conditions because the MLS shape functions, in general, didn’t satisfy the <b>Kronecker’s</b> <b>delta</b> property.

40|$|By {{applying}} projection {{operators to}} state vectors of coordinates we obtain subspaces {{in which these}} states are no longer normalized according to Dirac’s delta function but normalized according to what we call ”incomplete delta functions”. We show that this class of functions satisfy identities similar to those satisfied by the Dirac delta function. The incomplete delta functions may be employed advantageously in projected subspaces and in the link between functions defined on the whole space and the projected subspace. We apply a similar procedure to finite dimensional vector spaces for which we define incomplete <b>Kronecker</b> <b>deltas.</b> Dispersion relations for the momenta are obtained and ”sums over poles” are defined and obtained {{with the aid of}} differences of incomplete delta functions.

40|$|We {{illustrate}} a rigorous approach {{to express the}} totally symmetric isotropic tensors of arbitrary rank in the n-dimensional Euclidean space as a linear combination of products of <b>Kronecker</b> <b>deltas.</b> By {{making full use of}} the symmetries, one can greatly reduce the efforts to compute cumbersome angular integrals into straightforward combinatoric counts. This method is generalized into the cases in which such symmetries are present in subspaces. We further demonstrate the mechanism of the tensor-integral reduction that is widely used in various physics problems such as perturbative calculations of the gauge-field theory in which divergent integrals are regularized in d= 4 - 2 ϵ space-time dimensions. The main derivation is given in the n-dimensional Euclidean space. The generalization of the result to the Minkowski space is also discussed in order to provide graduate students and researchers with techniques of tensor-integral reduction for particle physics problems.

Especially at low local SNR-levels the global MMSE-estimate might not be optimal and its uncertainty is large. Therefore, it is first shown how a constrained quadratic optimisation problem can improve the linear combination weights in the MMSE-formula. Alternatively, these weights are then approximated by K <b>Kronecker</b> <b>deltas.</b> Both approaches are compared by recognition experiments on the Aurora 2 task. Also, Multiple Stream MBFE is validated on the large vocabulary Aurora 4 benchmark task.

40|$|The author advocates two {{specific}} mathematical notations {{from his}} popular course and joint textbook, "Concrete Mathematics". The first of these, extending {{an idea of}} Iverson, is the notation "[P]" for the function which is 1 when the Boolean condition P is true and 0 otherwise. This notation can encourage and clarify the use of characteristic functions and <b>Kronecker</b> <b>deltas</b> in sums and integrals. The second notation puts Stirling numbers on the same footing as binomial coefficients. Since binomial coefficients are written on two lines in parentheses and read "n choose k", Stirling numbers of the first kind should be written on two lines in brackets and read "n cycle k", while Stirling numbers of the second kind should be written in braces and read "n subset k". (I might say "n partition k".) The written form was first suggested by Imanuel Marx. The virtues of this notation are that Stirling partition numbers frequently appear in combinatorics, and that it more clearly presents functional relations similar to those satisfied by binomial coefficients.
