5|$|Krypton {{is mixed}} with argon in energy {{efficient}} fluorescent lamps, reducing the power consumption, but also reducing the light output and raising the cost. Krypton costs about 100 {{times as much as}} argon. Krypton (along with xenon) is also used to fill <b>incandescent</b> <b>lamps</b> to reduce filament evaporation and allow higher operating temperatures. A brighter light results with more blue color than conventional <b>incandescent</b> <b>lamps.</b>|$|E

5|$|In the sub-basement {{were the}} Sprague screw {{machines}} for the electric elevators, the fire pumps, the house pumps, the ice plant, {{and the six}} Babcock & Wilcox waler tube boilers. The elevator system, which served the house from subbasement to roof, was electric, taking its power from the generating plant within the building. There were 18 elevators. The machinery was located in the sub-basement. The boilers aggregated about 3,000 horse power, the electric generators taking 2,200 horse-power of the total energy. The elevators were run by it, as were the 15,000 <b>incandescent</b> <b>lamps,</b> branching from 7,500 outlets. The system of heating and ventilating the public rooms was that of forced draught by means of powerful blowers situated in the sub-basement that forced the fresh air between steam-coils, where it became moderately heated before entering the ducts that lead it to the various rooms. This heat was further augmented by direct radiators placed behind screens in the recesses of the windows and elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|In their ROs, Gibson used <b>incandescent</b> <b>lamps,</b> which {{required}} relatively large currents.

25|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, Gibson and Fender started using ROs to {{modulate}} the tremolo effect in guitar amplifiers.

25|$|<b>Incandescent</b> <b>lamps</b> {{have been}} phased {{out over the}} years. They are {{wasteful}} of energy, producing between 15 and 30 lumens per watt of power (out of a possible 683 lumens per watt for an ideal light source). They can be found many times in older aquarium light hoods. They burn out frequently, put {{off a lot of}} heat, and normally do not have an appropriate spectrum associated with them. Most <b>incandescent</b> <b>lamps</b> can be replaced with commonly available and efficient screw in power compact bulbs.|$|E
25|$|Albon Man, a New York lawyer, started Electro-Dynamic Light Company in 1878 {{to exploit}} his patents {{and those of}} William Sawyer.

25|$|Development of {{fluorescent}} lamps that could {{fit in the}} same volume as comparable <b>incandescent</b> <b>lamps</b> required the development of new, high-efficacy phosphors that could withstand more power per unit area than the phosphors used in older, larger fluorescent tubes.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the first}} {{activities}} defined under PRONUREE is the national program to phase out incandescent bulbs by 2011 in Argentina. The program, financed by the government, aims to replace incandescent bulbs with energy efficient compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) in all households connected to the electricity grid and selected public buildings. The program, which has initially undergone a pilot phase and expects to replace 5 million <b>incandescent</b> <b>lamps</b> {{in the next six}} months, foresees the distribution of 25 million lamps overall.

25|$|If a building's indoor <b>incandescent</b> <b>lamps</b> are {{replaced}} by CFLs, the heat produced due to lighting is significantly reduced. In warm climates or in office or industrial buildings where air conditioning is often required, CFLs reduce the load on the cooling system {{when compared to the}} use of <b>incandescent</b> <b>lamps,</b> resulting in savings in electricity in addition to the energy efficiency savings of the lamps themselves. However, in cooler climates in which buildings require heating, the heating system needs to replace the reduced heat from lighting fixtures. In Winnipeg, Canada, it was estimated that CFLs would only generate 17% savings in energy compared to incandescent bulbs, as opposed to the 75% savings that could have been expected without space heating considerations.|$|E
