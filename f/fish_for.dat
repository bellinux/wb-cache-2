5|$|A few lemurs {{have been}} noted to have {{relatively}} large brains. The extinct Hadropithecus was {{as large as a}} large male baboon and had a comparably sized brain, giving it the largest brain size relative to body size among all prosimians. The aye-aye also has a large brain-to-body ratio, which may indicate a higher level of intelligence. However, despite having a built-in tool in the form of its thin, elongated middle finger, which it uses to <b>fish</b> <b>for</b> insect grubs, the aye-aye has tested poorly in the use of extraneous tools.|$|E
50|$|Recreational <b>fishing</b> is <b>fishing</b> <b>for</b> {{pleasure}} or competition. It can be {{contrasted with}} commercial fishing, which is <b>fishing</b> <b>for</b> economic profit, or subsistence fishing, which is <b>fishing</b> <b>for</b> survival.|$|R

5|$|Members of this {{community}} also herd zebu and catch fish in Lake Alaotra. The work of fishing was traditionally subdivided by gender: men were only allowed to <b>fish</b> <b>for</b> eels, while women were tasked to use nets to catch small fish, and children {{were the only ones}} allowed to fish using poles. Men and children would traditionally leave their catch on the shore for women to pick up and take back to the village.|$|E
5|$|The {{trade with}} the North German towns lasted until the 1707 Act of Union, when high salt duties {{prevented}} the German merchants from trading with Shetland. Shetland then went into an economic depression, as the local traders were not as skilled in trading salted fish. However, some local merchant-lairds took up where the German merchants had left off, and fitted out their own ships to export fish from Shetland to the Continent. For the independent farmers of Shetland this had negative consequences, as they now had to <b>fish</b> <b>for</b> these merchant-lairds.|$|E

To refresh his memory {{he brought the}} paper {{closer and closer to}} his eyes. When it was only an inch or so away he still couldn't read it, and had to <b>fish</b> <b>for</b> a magnifying glass in his pocket to make the typing visible to him. It was an agonizing moment.|$|E

50|$|The bay's largest {{industries}} are sport and charter <b>fishing</b> <b>for</b> trophy <b>fish</b> such as bass, northern pike, and salmon; commercial <b>fishing</b> <b>for</b> <b>fish</b> such as lake trout and walleye; and pleasure boating. The innumerable {{islands of the}} bay create opportunities for amateur exploring and sightseeing, and a sheltered coastline is rarely far away.|$|R
50|$|Lake Creek {{supports}} {{populations of}} steelhead, Chinook salmon, and cutthroat trout {{that can be}} legally caught under certain conditions. <b>Fishing</b> <b>for</b> wild steelhead is catch and release, but some finclipped hatchery steelhead can be kept. <b>Fishing</b> <b>for</b> Chinook is allowed below Deadwood Creek. Cutthroat fishing is legal along the main stem but not the tributaries. <b>Fishing</b> <b>for</b> coho salmon, which also frequent the creek, is prohibited. Other regulations may apply depending on species, season, and location.|$|R
5|$|Unlike most bony fish, {{sharks are}} K-selected reproducers, {{meaning that they}} produce {{a small number of}} {{well-developed}} young as opposed to a large number of poorly developed young. Fecundity in sharks ranges from 2 to over 100 young per reproductive cycle. Sharks mature slowly relative to many other <b>fish.</b> <b>For</b> example, lemon sharks reach sexual maturity at around age 13–15.|$|E
5|$|Fish {{hatcheries}} provide larval {{and juvenile}} fish, crustaceans and shellfish, {{for use in}} aquaculture systems. When large enough these are transferred to growing-on tanks and sold to fish farms to reach harvest size. Some species that are commonly raised in hatcheries include shrimps, prawns, salmon, tilapia, oysters and scallops. Similar facilities {{can be used to}} raise species with conservation needs to be released into the wild, or game <b>fish</b> <b>for</b> restocking waterways. Important aspects of husbandry at these early stages include selection of breeding stock, control of water quality and nutrition. In the wild, there is a massive amount of mortality at the nursery stage; farmers seek to minimise this {{while at the same time}} maximising growth rates.|$|E
5|$|Forest {{and river}} {{habitats}} in the watershed have been heavily affected by human activities ever since Gold Rush mining {{began in the}} 1800s. Commercial logging has caused mountain slopes to become more prone to erosion; even {{in areas that are}} no longer logged and have seen secondary forest growth, abandoned logging roads pose a serious erosive threat. Grazing of livestock has also degraded grasslands and exposed soils to runoff. This has resulted in river channels becoming clogged and confined by sediment, harming salmon and steelhead populations by burying gravel bars used by these <b>fish</b> <b>for</b> spawning. Along the South Fork, this problem has been exacerbated by the inherently unstable rocks and soils of the Franciscan formation, causing mass wasting events that dump sediment into streams.|$|E
50|$|Fishing, boating, {{hiking and}} camping are {{permitted}} at the lake. Swimming is not allowed. A variety of fish have been stocked in the lake. <b>Fishing</b> <b>for</b> channel catfish is rated as excellent and <b>fishing</b> <b>for</b> largemouth bass and bluegill are rated as good.|$|R

5|$|From {{the early}} 15th century on the Shetlanders had sold their goods through the Hanseatic League of German merchantmen. This {{trade with the}} North German towns lasted until the 1707 Act of Union when high salt duties {{prohibited}} the German merchants from trading with Shetland. Shetland then went into an economic depression as the Scottish and local traders were not as skilled in trading with salted fish. However, some local merchant-lairds took up where the German merchants had left off, and fitted out their own ships to export fish from Shetland to the Continent. For the independent farmer/fishermen of Shetland this had negative consequences, as they now had to <b>fish</b> <b>for</b> these merchant-lairds.|$|E
5|$|Goldfish, {{domestication}} of: In ancient China, {{various species}} of carp (collectively known as Asian carps) were domesticated {{and have been}} reared as food <b>fish</b> <b>for</b> thousands of years. Some of these normally gray or silver species {{have a tendency to}} produce red, orange or yellow color mutations; this was first recorded in the Jin Dynasty (265–420). During the Tang Dynasty (618–907), it was popular to raise carp in ornamental ponds and watergardens. A natural genetic mutation produced gold (actually yellowish orange) rather than silver coloration. People began to breed the gold variety instead of the silver variety, keeping them in ponds or other bodies of water. Goldfish were introduced into Europe during the 17th century, and into North America in the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|Like other animals, fish {{suffer from}} {{diseases}} and parasites. To prevent disease {{they have a}} variety of defenses. Non-specific defenses include the skin and scales, as well as the mucus layer secreted by the epidermis that traps and inhibits the growth of microorganisms. If pathogens breach these defenses, fish can develop an inflammatory response that increases blood flow to the infected region and delivers white blood cells that attempt to destroy pathogens. Specific defenses respond to particular pathogens recognised by the fish's body, i.e., an immune response. In recent years, vaccines have become widely used in aquaculture and also with ornamental <b>fish,</b> <b>for</b> example furunculosis vaccines in farmed salmon and koi herpes virus in koi.|$|E

5|$|The Secret River is a children's fantasy book by Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings, {{author of}} The Yearling. Published in 1955, The Secret River {{received}} a Newbery Honor Award. The first edition, illustrated by Caldecott Medal winner Leonard Weisgard, was issued after Rawlings' death. The book was revised and reissued in 2009 with illustrations by Caldecott Medalists Leo and Diane Dillon. The new edition received an international children's book design award in 2012. The Secret River {{is the only}} book Rawlings wrote specifically for children. The story of young Calpurnia, who goes on a quest to find a magical river and catch <b>fish</b> <b>for</b> her starving family and friends, it has two themes common in Rawlings' writing, the magic of childhood and the struggle of people {{to survive in a}} harsh environment.|$|E
5|$|The churchyard covers {{some two}} acres. Most of the headstones in the churchyard are modern – {{many of them}} are from the nineteenth century – but the churchyard, which is now closed to new interments, {{contains}} some old monuments. The whole churchyard and church is surrounded by what was once a typical sign of an early Celtic church; an oval formation of trees. There are also indications which suggest the remains of an early pond, probably for keeping <b>fish</b> <b>for</b> the priests and monks who once lived there. There is no visible trace of any conventual buildings (which would probably have been mostly relatively slight wooden structures, and never extensive). In the early nineteenth century Meyrick does however record the survival of what appeared to be stone monastic or church buildings.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} known {{record of}} {{improvements to the}} river is recorded in a document of 1325 from the Dean and Chapter of Wells Cathedral, where it was proposed to widen the river between Ham Mill and a new mill {{which was to be}} built at Knapp. The Dean and Chapter owned the river as far as Athelney weir, which was presumably a fish weir, as the river was an important source of <b>fish</b> <b>for</b> the local population. Records from 1494 record the intent to build a new mill at North Curry, which was operational in 1504, and caused flooding in 1505, resulting in the Bishop of Winchester having to complain to the Dean and Chapter of Wells. There is also mention of boats using the river at this time, as their use was restricted by the construction of the new mill at Ham.|$|E

50|$|Crab traps {{are used}} to bait, lure, and catch crabs for {{commercial}} or recreational use. Crabbing or crab fishing is the recreational hobby and commercial occupation of <b>fishing</b> <b>for</b> crabs.

5|$|The {{fact that}} it is a seaside city has shaped Póvoa de Varzim's economy: the fishing {{industry}}, from the fishing vessels that put in each day to the canning industry and to the city's fish market, beach agriculture, and seaweed-gathering for fertilizing fields are the result of its geography. Tourism and the related industries are more relevant in Póvoa's economy these days, as fisheries have lost importance. Nevertheless, the mean value of fish landed in 2004, in its seaport, was almost three times that of Matosinhos seaport and significantly higher in the average vessels' capacity. Its fishing productivity is also comparatively higher than the national average. A Poveira is a traditional Povoan canning factory and most of its production, 80 to 85%, is exported and deals with high-end brands in canned <b>fish,</b> <b>for</b> MDC markets. Export market brands include: Poveira, D'Henry IV, Ala-Arriba, Minerva, and Alva.|$|E
5|$|The oceans {{are home}} to a diverse {{collection}} of life forms that {{use it as a}} habitat. Since sunlight illuminates only the upper layers, the major part of the ocean exists in permanent darkness. As the different depth and temperature zones each provide habitat for a unique set of species, the marine environment as a whole encompasses an immense diversity of life. Marine habitats range from surface water to the deepest oceanic trenches, including coral reefs, kelp forests, seagrass meadows, tidepools, muddy, sandy and rocky seabeds, and the open pelagic zone. The organisms living in the sea range from whales 30 meters (100ft) long to microscopic phytoplankton and zooplankton, fungi, bacteria and viruses, including recently discovered marine bacteriophages which live parasitically inside bacteria. Marine life plays an important part in the carbon cycle as photosynthetic organisms convert dissolved carbon dioxide into organic carbon and it is economically important to humans for providing <b>fish</b> <b>for</b> use as food.|$|E
5|$|Arbroath {{today is}} mostly {{known for its}} {{connection}} with the Scottish fishing industry. After the original harbours, dating from the 14th and 18th centuries, were replaced in 1839 with a larger harbour, the local council tried to find fishermen who {{would be interested in}} migrating to Arbroath in order {{to take advantage of the}} new facilities offered. The town council contacted fishermen in nearby Auchmithie and further afield, including Shetland. The fishing industry grew and at its peak years between 1900 and 1980, around 40 whitefish and pelagic vessels worked from Arbroath, with hundreds of men employed directly as fishermen, hundreds more employed ashore to service the fishing vessels and to process the fish. Quota cuts and decommissioning took its toll on the fishing industry throughout Scotland from the 1980s to present. Today, Arbroath remains a designated whitefish landing port, and although no fish auction takes place, the fishmarket remains open and is used for landing shellfish. There is now only one large fishing vessel operating regularly from Arbroath, and a further three Arbroath owned vessels operating from Aberdeen and ports further north. The fish processing sector remains one of the largest employers in the town however, but <b>fish</b> <b>for</b> processing now comes from Aberdeen, Peterhead and occasionally from Iceland, Norway and Ireland.|$|E
