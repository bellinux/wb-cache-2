To ameliorate this problem, there are four approaches commonly taken: (1) enlarge the heat exchanger area and structure, (2) fabricate the heat exchanger using materials with higher thermal conductivity, (3) increase the working fluid flow rate to the heat exchanger, and (4) improve the heat transfer performance of the <b>heat</b> <b>exchange</b> working <b>fluid.</b> Of these methods, enlargement of the heat exchanger area has reached a physical limit.

50|$|In {{areas where}} {{freezing}} is a possibility, freeze-tolerance (the capability to freeze repeatedly without cracking) {{can be achieved}} by the use of flexible polymers. Silicone rubber pipes have been used for this purpose in UK since 1999. Conventional metal collectors are vulnerable to damage from freezing, so if they are water filled they must be carefully plumbed so they completely drain using gravity before freezing is expected, so that they do not crack. Many metal collectors are installed as part of a sealed heat exchanger system. Rather than having potable water flow directly through the collectors, a mixture of water and antifreeze such as propylene glycol is used. A <b>heat</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>fluid</b> protects against freeze damage down to a locally determined risk temperature that depends on the proportion of propylene glycol in the mixture.

Basically all of these systems are based on the Active Magnetic Regenerator (AMR) concept, where a heat transfer fluid is actively pumped through a bed of magnetocaloric material in order to transfer thermal energy to hot and cold side heat exchangers. Hereby several powerful systems were built, generating large temperature spans of more than 50 K while others provided large cooling capacities of several kW.

As part of the future path toward realizing net zero energy buildings, innovative energy-efficient technologies must be developed. In this study, the potential of phase-change material (PCM) -enhanced constructions to lower heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) energy consumption in a commercial restaurant building was investigated. A commercially available fatty acid based PCM product was selected due to their promising thermal and chemical properties. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used in isothermal step mode to accurately measure the latent heat energy storage of the PCM. A U. S.

The rate of R 141 b hydrate formation {{in the presence of a}} <b>heat</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>fluid</b> depended on the degree of supercooling according to the same rate equation as pure R 141 b with secondary dependence on salinity. Experiments demonstrated that a perfluorocarbon <b>heat</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>fluid</b> assisted separation of R 141 b hydrates from brine. Preliminary experiments using the guest species, difluoromethane, showed that hydrate formation rates were substantial at temperatures up to at least 12 C and demonstrated partial separation of water from brine. We present a detailed molecular picture of the structure and dynamics of R 141 b guest molecules within water cages, obtained from ab initio calculations, molecular dynamics simulations, and Raman spectroscopy. Density functional theory calculations were used to provide an energetic and molecular orbital description of R 141 b stability in both large and small cages in a structure II hydrate. Additionally, the hydrate of an isomer, 1, 2 -dichloro- 1 -fluoroethane, does not form at ambient conditions because of extensive overlap of electron density between guest and host. Classical molecular dynamics simulations and laboratory trials support the results for the isomer hydrate. Molecular dynamics simulations show that R 141 b hydrate is stable at temperatures up to 265 K, while the isomer hydrate is only stable up to 150 K. Despite hydrogen bonding between guest and host, R 141 b molecules rotated freely within the water cage. The Raman spectrum of R 141 b in both the pure and hydrate phases was also compared with vibrational analysis from both computational methods. In particular, the frequency of the C-Cl stretch mode (585 cm{sup - 1 }) undergoes a shift to higher frequency in the hydrate phase.
