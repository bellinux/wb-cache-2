Extended control arms can be employed on MacPherson strut vehicles like the Nissan S-Chassis, as to allow for more clearance for higher steering angles. Companies like Wisefab, IRP (Individual Racing Parts), Voodoo13, and Parts Shop MAX have developed <b>full</b> <b>lock</b> kits including modification of the vehicle's original scrub radius, kingpin axis, Ackermann angle, amount of bump steer, caster angle, and kinematics as to maximize front grip and eliminate mechanical bind at steering angles in excess of 60°.

40|$|With recent {{technological}} advances, {{shared memory}} parallel machines {{have become more}} scalable, and offer large main memories and high bus bandwidths. They are emerging as good platforms for data warehousing and data mining. In this paper, we focus on shared memory parallelization of data mining algorithms.

Unlike previous work on shared memory parallelization of specific data mining algorithms, all of our techniques apply to {{a large number of}} popular data mining algorithms. In addition, we propose a reduction-object-based interface for specifying a data mining algorithm. We show how our runtime system can apply any of the techniques we have developed starting from a common specification of the algorithm. We have carried out a detailed evaluation of the parallelization techniques and the programming interface. We have experimented with apriori and fp-tree-based association mining, k-means clustering, k-nearest neighbor classifier, and decision tree construction. The main results from our experiments are as follows. 1) Among full replication, optimized <b>full</b> <b>locking,</b> and cachesensitive locking, there is no clear winner. Each of these three techniques can outperform others depending upon machine and dataset parameters. These three techniques perform significantly better than the other two techniques. 2) Good parallel efficiency is achieved {{for each of the four}} algorithms we experimented with, using our techniques and runtime system. 3) The overhead of the interface is within 10 percent in almost all cases. 4) In the case of decision tree construction, combining diffe [...] ...|$|R
