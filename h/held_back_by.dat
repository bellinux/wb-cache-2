5|$|According to Taum, {{the title}} Belenggu {{reflects}} the inner conflicts {{the main characters}} face that limit their actions. Taum points to {{the climax of the}} novel– in which Rohayah refuses to marry Sukartono because if she were to marry him he would lose face because of her past– as a prime example of these limitations. Siregar notes that such a reading is supported by dialogue between Hartono and Sukartono, in which they note that humans are inherently <b>held</b> <b>back</b> <b>by</b> their reminiscences of the past.|$|E
5|$|Jack Bros. {{was well}} {{received}} in retrospective reviews, with multiple critics calling {{it one of}} the best Virtual Boy games; some thought it was <b>held</b> <b>back</b> <b>by</b> the platform, and that it should be made available on other platforms, such as the Nintendo 3DS. In 2003, the staff at Tips & Tricks stated it to be the most uncommon North American Virtual Boy release, giving it a rarity rating of 6/10 based on a consultation with Digital Press.|$|E
5|$|The Argentine territories, <b>held</b> <b>back</b> <b>by</b> their closed economies, {{the lack}} of any {{activity}} closely linked to foreign trade, and the scant amounts of labour and capital they consequently received, fell far behind those of other areas of the colonial world that participated in foreign trade. Only activities associated with a dynamic exporting centre enjoyed some degree of prosperity, as occurred in Tucuman, where cloth was manufactured, and in Córdoba and the Litoral, where livestock was raised to supply the mines of Upper Peru.|$|E

5|$|General praise went to {{the variety}} of choice in its {{narrative}} and gameplay, despite the former being seen as lacking in places and the latter being <b>held</b> <b>back</b> <b>by</b> other {{factors such as the}} limitations of the Biomod upgrade system and its limited environment sizes. Poor AI behavior was also a recurring criticism. The Xbox version was praised for its performance and graphics despite several reviewers noting distracting drops in frame rate and other technical issues. The PC version was frequently criticized as having similar frame rate issues in addition to problems with the controls, the necessity for a powerful computer to run the game properly, {{and the fact that the}} game was scaled down to run on the Xbox.|$|E

Lord Commander Mormont recognizes them as Benjen Stark's fellow rangers and orders their bodies examined.

Later, Mormont informs Jon about events in the south and warns him to keep his commitment to the Night's Watch. Jon loses his temper after Ser Alliser Thorne mocks Eddard Stark's treason. Enraged, Jon charges at Thorne with a knife but is <b>held</b> <b>back</b> <b>by</b> his companions and confined to his quarters by Mormont.|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} a {{critical}} and commercial success, particularly in Europe, unusually so for a hip hop album at that time. Bumrush the Show had been recorded {{on the heels of}} Run-D.M.C.'s Raising Hell, but was <b>held</b> <b>back</b> <b>by</b> Def Jam {{in order for them to}} concentrate on releasing and promoting the Beastie Boys' License to Ill. Chuck D of Public Enemy felt that by the time their first record was released, BDP and Rakim had already changed the landscape for how an MC could rap. Public Enemy were already recording their second album It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (Def Jam, 1988) when Bumrush hit stores.|$|E

Bullen embellished the scripts with events from his own personal life.

The series was filmed in Greater Manchester {{in the first half of}} 1998, using Granada Television's studios, and exterior locations.|$|E
5|$|Casting English-speaking lead {{actors in}} Spaghetti Westerns was a growing {{practice}} {{because it was}} believed to allow international marketability. Marcello Mastroianni had conceived {{the idea of a}} mute gunfighter when he told Corbucci that he had always wanted to appear in a Western, but would have been <b>held</b> <b>back</b> <b>by</b> his inability to speak English. When Corbucci first met Jean-Louis Trintignant, who was hired for the leading role of the film by Les Films Corona after it was turned down by Franco Nero (who had previously played the title character of Django), he learned that Trintignant did not speak English either. To bypass the need for an English-speaking lead, Corbucci decided to turn Trintignant's character into a mute. At the time, Trintignant was known {{for his role in the}} critically acclaimed romantic drama A Man and a Woman, and is believed to have accepted the role in support of co-producer Robert Dorfmann, who was a friend of his. Silence was his only role in a Spaghetti Western.|$|E
5|$|In 1804, Clarkson {{resumed his}} work and the Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade began meeting again, {{strengthened}} with prominent new members such as Zachary Macaulay, Henry Brougham and James Stephen. In June 1804, Wilberforce's bill to abolish the slave trade successfully passed all its stages through the House of Commons. However, {{it was too late}} in the parliamentary session for it to complete its passage through the House of Lords. On its reintroduction during the 1805 session, it was defeated, with even the usually sympathetic Pitt failing to support it. On this occasion and throughout the campaign, abolition was <b>held</b> <b>back</b> <b>by</b> Wilberforce's trusting, even credulous nature, and his deferential attitude towards those in power. He found it difficult to believe that men of rank would not do what he perceived to be the right thing, and was reluctant to confront them when they did not.|$|E

5|$|In 1929-30 Morenz {{finished}} {{seventh in}} the league for scoring with 50 points, including scoring 40 goals for the first time; this included {{a game against the}} New York Americans on March 18, 1930, in which he scored five goals. In the playoffs, he added another three goals, including his second Stanley Cup-winning goal, as the Canadiens beat the Boston Bruins for their third Stanley Cup. In the 1930–31 season, Morenz scored 28 goals and matched his career high with 51 points, winning his second NHL scoring title, and being awarded the Hart Trophy for the second time. He was also named to the newly created NHL All-Star Team, being selected as the first-team centre, as the top player in that position. In the playoffs, the Canadiens reached the Stanley Cup Final for the second consecutive year, playing the Chicago Black Hawks. Playing with an injured shoulder and being <b>held</b> <b>back</b> <b>by</b> the Black Hawks, Morenz only scored one goal throughout ten playoff games, the final goal of the playoffs, as he won his third Stanley Cup with the Canadiens.|$|E
5|$|Most {{animals are}} euthanized after {{being used in}} an experiment. Sources of {{laboratory}} animals vary between countries and species; most animals are purpose-bred, while a minority {{are caught in the}} wild or supplied by dealers who obtain them from auctions and pounds. Supporters of the use of animals in experiments, such as the British Royal Society, argue that virtually every medical achievement in the 20th century relied on the use of animals in some way. The Institute for Laboratory Animal Research of the United States National Academy of Sciences has argued that animal research cannot be replaced by even sophisticated computer models, which are unable to deal with the extremely complex interactions between molecules, cells, tissues, organs, organisms and the environment. Animal rights and some animal welfare organizations—such as PETA and BUAV—question the need for and legitimacy of animal testing, arguing that it is cruel and poorly regulated, that medical progress is actually <b>held</b> <b>back</b> <b>by</b> misleading animal models that cannot reliably predict effects in humans, that some of the tests are outdated, that the costs outweigh the benefits, or that animals have the intrinsic right not to be used or harmed in experimentation.|$|E
5|$|On November 20, 2012, a melee {{occurred}} at a Newark City Council meeting attended by Booker. The nine-seat council was {{to vote on the}} successor to the seat vacated by newly elected U.S. Representative Donald M. Payne,Jr. Booker's opponents on the council, including Ras Baraka, sought to appoint John Sharpe James, son of the former mayor, while Booker and his supporters favored Shanique Speight. Booker attended the meeting to deal with the eventuality of the lack of a quorum or a tie vote, in which state law would allow him to cast a deciding vote. After Baraka was refused an opportunity to address the council by acting Council President Anibal Ramos,Jr., Baraka and two other council members walked away in protest. Booker cast the deciding vote for Speight. Supporters of James stormed the stage and were <b>held</b> <b>back</b> <b>by</b> riot police, who eventually used pepper spray on some members of the crowd. Baraka later blamed Booker for inciting the disturbance, while Booker refused comment to the media after the vote.|$|E

5|$|Point 343 {{was held}} through the 18th, however, though {{with the loss}} of 63 men; by the evening, a force of tanks had managed to come up and {{stabilise}} the position with the aid of artillery support. The 4th/11th Sikh Regiment moved around the Gurkhas to the north, covering the northern flank of the San Marino heights, and the division's 11th Brigade passed through them to help encircle the city. On the evening of the 19th, the 2nd Battalion, Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders of 11th Indian Infantry Brigade began to push into {{the outskirts of the city}} from the north, but early on the morning of the 20th were <b>held</b> <b>back</b> <b>by</b> defensive positions in the north-west of the city, where the road to the upper part of the city, situated higher on the mountain, began. Tanks moved into the suburbs, whilst a company of the Camerons moved uphill toward the summit in heavy rain. The city was secured by the early afternoon, with only 24 casualties among the attackers, and 54 prisoners taken.|$|E
5|$|In August 1939, Wavell {{ordered a}} plan covertly to {{encourage}} a rebellion in the western Ethiopian province of Gojjam, which the Italians {{had never been able}} entirely to repress {{after the end of the}} Second Italo-Ethiopian War in May 1936. In September, Colonel D. A. Sandford arrived to run the project but until the Italian declaration of war, the conspiracy was <b>held</b> <b>back</b> <b>by</b> the British policy of appeasement, intended to avoid a simultaneous war with Germany and Italy. Mission 101 was formed to co-ordinate the activities of the Ethiopian resistance, known as the Arbegnoch. In June 1940, Haile Selassie arrived in Egypt and in July, went to Sudan to meet Platt and discuss plans to re-capture Ethiopia, despite Platt's reservations. In July, the British recognised Selassie as emperor of Ethiopia and in August, Mission 101 entered Gojjam province to reconnoitre. Sandford requested that supply routes to the area north of Lake Tana be established before the rains ended and that Selassie should return in October as a catalyst for the uprising. Gaining control of Gojjam required the Italian garrisons to be isolated along the main road from Bahrdar Giorgis south of Lake Tana, to Dangila, Debra Markos and Addis Ababa, to prevent them concentrating against the Arbegnoch. Italian reinforcements arrived in October and patrolled more frequently, just as dissension between local potentates were being reconciled by Sandford's diplomacy.|$|E
5|$|Ninety {{seconds after}} Wallace shoved Artest, most of both teams' {{players and coaches}} were huddled at midcourt, {{attempting}} to calm down Wallace (Tayshaun Prince was the only player on either team to not leave the bench during the entire incident; others became automatically eligible for one-game suspensions). While Artest {{was lying on the}} table, Wallace threw a towel at him, causing Artest to briefly stand up before being <b>held</b> <b>back</b> <b>by</b> coaches. A spectator, John Green, then threw a plastic cup of Diet Coke at Artest, hitting him in the chest. Artest jumped off the table, ran into the stands, and grabbed a man, Michael Ryan, who he mistakenly believed was responsible. Boyle stood up to try and hold back Artest and was trampled in the effort, suffering five fractured vertebrae and a gouge on his head. Jackson followed Artest into the stands and punched a fan, William Paulson, in the face in retaliation for the man throwing another drink in Artest's face while he was being restrained by other spectators. Pacers players Eddie Gill, David Harrison, Reggie Miller (who was not dressed for the game due to injury), Fred Jones, and Jamaal Tinsley, the Pistons' Rasheed Wallace, and numerous personnel (including Pistons radio analyst and former player Rick Mahorn) also quickly entered the stands to retrieve Artest and Jackson, and to break up the fighting. Green punched Artest twice in the head from behind, as did Ben Wallace's brother, David, to Jones. More fans then began throwing drinks and other objects, while a number of fans spilled out onto the court.|$|E
