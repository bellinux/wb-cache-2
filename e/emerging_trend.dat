The Italian police conducted a raid on the Austrian cross-country ski team's residence during the Games where they seized blood-doping specimens and equipment. This event followed the pre-Olympics suspension of 12 cross-country skiers who tested positive for unusually high levels of haemoglobin, which is evidence of blood doping.|$|E

25|$|Several new {{products}} were developed internally at Frito-Lay and {{launched in the}} 1990s, the most successful of which was Sun Chips, a multi-grain chip first sold in 1991. Sun Chips, along with new Baked (instead of fried) variants of Tostitos and Lay's, represented Frito-Lay's intent to capitalize on an <b>emerging</b> <b>trend</b> among adults in the U.S., who were displaying a growing preference for healthier snack alternatives. In 1994, Frito-Lay recorded annual retail sales of nearly $5 billion, selling 8 billion bags of chips, popcorn, and pretzels during that year—outpacing competitors Eagle (owned by Anheuser-Busch) and Wise (owned by Borden).|$|E
25|$|In November 1961, Knudsen {{had moved}} to Chevrolet. Pete Estes now became general manager of Pontiac and Delorean was {{promoted}} to Pontiac Chief engineer. Both continued Knudsen's work of making Pontiac a performance-car brand. Pontiac capitalized on the <b>emerging</b> <b>trend</b> toward sportier bucket-seat coupes in 1962 by introducing the Grand Prix, taking {{the place of the}} Ventura which now became a trim option on the Catalina. Although GM officially ended factory support for all racing activities across all of its brands in January 1963, Pontiac continued to cater to performance car enthusiasts by making larger engines with more power available across all model lines. For 1963, the Grand Prix received the same styling changes as other full-sized Pontiacs such as vertical headlights and crisper body lines, but also received its own squared-off roof-line with a concave rear window, along with less chrome. This concave rear window would be duplicated on all Tempest/LeMans four-door intermediates in 1964-1965.|$|E

500|$|The men's {{magazine}} Playboy ignited her career, and she {{was featured}} in numerous issues. It has been conjectured that Playboy was a pioneer in starting an American [...] "breast fetish" [...] which has exaggerated the importance of large breasts, in which both Jayne Mansfield and Marilyn Monroe, featured in the early issues of the magazine, played significant roles. Playboy pictorials of Mansfield and Monroe {{were part of the}} <b>emerging</b> <b>trend</b> that gave birth to the large-breasted feminine ideal and men's magazines including Rogue, Nugget and Dude. Numerous other magazines featured her on the cover. These include: Hollywood Studio Magazine: Then And Now (May 1987, Volume 20, No. 5.), Life Magazine (April 23, 1956), Modern Man: The Adult Picture Magazine (March 1966), Photo-Rama Magazine (Volume 6, No. 16) and Playboy (June 1963).|$|E
500|$|Thomas Cripps {{reasons that}} the film in some respects {{undercuts}} racial stereotypes; in particular, the film created greater engagement between Hollywood and black audiences, with dozens of movies making small gestures {{in recognition of the}} <b>emerging</b> <b>trend.</b> Only a few weeks after its initial run, a story editor at Warner wrote a memorandum to Walter Wanger about Mississippi Belle, a script that contained the worst excesses of plantation films, suggesting that Gone with the Wind had made the film [...] "unproducible". More than any film since The Birth of a Nation, it unleashed a variety of social forces that foreshadowed an alliance of white liberals and blacks who encouraged the expectation that blacks would one day achieve equality. According to Cripps, the film eventually became a template for measuring social change.|$|E
500|$|Concorde had {{considerable}} difficulties {{that led to}} its dismal sales performance. Costs had spiralled during development to more than six times the original projections, arriving at a unit cost of £23million in 1977 (equivalent to £ million in [...] ). Its sonic boom made travelling supersonic over land impossible without causing complaints from citizens. World events had also dampened Concorde sales prospects, the 1973-74 stock market crash and the 1973 oil crisis had made many airlines cautious about aircraft with high fuel consumption rates; and new wide-body aircraft, such as the Boeing 747, had recently made subsonic aircraft significantly more efficient and presented a low-risk option for airlines. While carrying a full load, Concorde achieved 15.8 passenger miles per gallon of fuel, while the Boeing 707 reached 33.3pm/g, the Boeing 747 46.4pm/g, and the McDonnell Douglas DC-10 53.6pm/g. An <b>emerging</b> <b>trend</b> in the industry in favour of cheaper airline tickets had also caused airlines such as Qantas to question Concorde's market suitability.|$|E

500|$|Among CCAFs {{cases are}} those {{challenging}} an <b>emerging</b> <b>trend</b> known as cy-près. [...] Created by American {{courts in the}} 1970s as a mechanism to distribute funds to stand-in organizations and causes in cases in which it would be impractical to distribute class action settlement funds directly to the entire class of plaintiffs, the practice has been criticized {{from time to time}} for redirecting funds that would otherwise go to the parties to the case. [...] In one case, CCAF challenged a settlement that would have directed $2.5 million out of a total $16.5 million settlement Apple Inc. was to pay to shareholders for backdating employee stock option grants, to unrelated law school programs on corporate governance. According to Frank, in March 2010, two attorneys from the Kabateck Brown Kellner firm published an op ed in the Los Angeles Daily Journal attacking the litigation against impermissible cy pres awards as part of a [...] "corporate" [...] campaign.

2500|$|One <b>emerging</b> <b>trend</b> {{since at}} least the 1990s is the [...] "floating population" [...] or [...] "black (e.g. black market) people", rural {{migrants}} (民工 min gong) entering urban areas in search of work. Until recent developments, rural residents lacked the legal permission to resettle in urban areas without approval, yet between tens and hundred of millions did resettle in search of jobs. Many have found work, in the form of construction and other sectors with relatively low wages and benefits, and high workplace hazards. Numerous social issues have developed as a result, namely discrimination of ruralites in cities, psychological isolation of rural migrants, some of which has led to crime. In this sense, then, rural life has [...] "entered" [...] the cities.|$|E
2500|$|Arcos, a British-Soviet {{trading company}} that {{temporarily}} served as liaison between two countries without diplomatic ties, declared a public competition for its Moscow headquarters in 1924. The Vesnin brothers easily won the contest with a Brutalist, simple design emphasizing the structural grid of reinforced concrete and wraparound glazing. Moisei Ginzburg criticized the ‘’Arcos’’ draft as lacking any true novelty, which {{was expected of}} constructivist architecture: it {{was little more than}} a traditional office block wrapped in modern materials. Vesnins proposal became a model for numerous practical adaptations as the path of least resistance between novel concrete structure and traditional expectations of a [...] "solid" [...] facade. Critics like Ginzburg dubbed the <b>emerging</b> <b>trend</b> [...] "constructive style", opposed to true [...] "constructivism"; according to them, simple following the function was sufficient and needed no external stylistic cues, no aesthetics whether original or borrowed. According to Khan-Magomedov, by 1927 the Vesnins, fed up with indiscriminate copies of their own work, also subscribed to Ginzburg's opinion. Their Arcos did not materialize; actual Arcos building in Kitai-gorod was designed and built by former neoclassicist Vladimir Mayat in moderate [...] "constructive style".|$|E

2500|$|The {{relatively}} {{small amount of}} network color programming, combined with {{the high cost of}} color television sets, meant that as late as 1964 only 3.1 percent of television households in the U.S. had a color set. But by the mid-1960s, the subject of color programming turned into a ratings war. A 1965 ARB study that proposed an <b>emerging</b> <b>trend</b> in color television set sales convinced NBC that a full shift to color would gain a ratings advantage over its two competitors. As a result, NBC provided the catalyst for rapid color expansion by announcing that its prime time schedule for fall 1965 would be almost entirely in color. ABC and CBS followed suit and over half of their combined prime-time programming also was in color that season, but they were still reluctant to telecast all their programming in color due to production costs. All three broadcast networks were airing full color prime time schedules by the 1966–67 broadcast season, and ABC aired its last new black-and-white daytime programming in December 1967. Public broadcasting networks like NET, however, did not use color for a majority of their programming until 1968. [...] The number of color television sets sold in the U.S. did not exceed black-and-white sales until 1972, which was also the first year that more than fifty percent of television households in the U.S. had a color set. This was also the year that [...] "in color" [...] notices before color television programs ended, due to the rise in color television set sales, and color programming having become the norm.|$|E
