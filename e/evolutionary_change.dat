5|$|Punctuated {{equilibrium}} (also called punctuated equilibria) is {{a theory}} in evolutionary biology which proposes that once species appear in the fossil record they will become stable, showing little <b>evolutionary</b> <b>change</b> {{for most of their}} geological history. This state is called stasis. When significant <b>evolutionary</b> <b>change</b> occurs, the theory proposes that it is generally restricted to rare and geologically rapid events of branching speciation called cladogenesis. Cladogenesis is the process by which a species splits into two distinct species, rather than one species gradually transforming into another.|$|E

5|$|Earlier {{methods for}} {{measuring}} convergence incorporate ratios of phenotypic and phylogenetic distance by simulating evolution with a Brownian motion model of trait evolution along a phylogeny. More recent methods also quantify {{the strength of}} convergence. One drawback {{to keep in mind}} is that these methods can confuse long-term stasis with convergence due to phenotypic similarities.

40|$|Recent {{studies suggest}} that <b>evolutionary</b> <b>changes</b> can occur on a {{contemporary}} time scale. Hence, evolution can influence ecology and vice-versa. To {{understand the importance of}} eco-evolutionary dynamics in population dynamics, we must quantify the relative contribution of ecological and <b>evolutionary</b> <b>changes</b> to population growth and other ecological processes. To date, however, most eco-evolutionary dynamics studies have not partitioned the relative contribution of plastic and <b>evolutionary</b> <b>changes</b> in traits on population, community, and ecosystem processes. Here, we quantify the effects of heritable and non-heritable changes in body mass distribution on survival, recruitment, and population growth in wild bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) and compare their importance to the effects of changes in age structure, population density, and weather. We applied a combination of a pedigree-based quantitative genetics model, statistical analyses of demography, and a new statistical decomposition technique, the Geber method, to a long-term data set of bighorn sheep on Ram Mountain (Canada), monitored individually from 1975 to 2012. We show three main results: (1) The relative importance of heritable change in mass, non-heritable change in mass, age structure, density, and climate on population growth rate changed substantially over time. (2) An increase in body mass was accompanied by an increase in population growth through higher survival and recruitment rate. (3) Over the entire study period, changes in the body mass distribution of ewes, mostly through non-heritable changes, affected population growth to a similar extent as changes in age structure or in density. The importance of <b>evolutionary</b> <b>changes</b> was small compared to that of other drivers of changes in population growth but increased with time as <b>evolutionary</b> <b>changes</b> accumulated. <b>Evolutionary</b> <b>changes</b> became increasingly important for population growth as the length of the study period considered increased. Our results highlight the complex ways in which ecological and <b>evolutionary</b> <b>changes</b> can affect population dynamics and illustrate the large potential effect of trait changes on population processes...|$|R
5|$|In {{response}} to such examples, creationists specify that they are objecting only to macroevolution, not microevolution: most creationist organizations do not dispute the occurrence of short-term, relatively minor <b>evolutionary</b> <b>changes,</b> such as that observed even in dog breeding. Rather, they dispute the occurrence of major <b>evolutionary</b> <b>changes</b> {{over long periods of}} time, which by definition cannot be directly observed, only inferred from microevolutionary processes and the traces of macroevolutionary ones.|$|R
5|$|Gould's most {{significant}} contribution to evolutionary biology was the theory of punctuated equilibrium, which he developed with Niles Eldredge in 1972. The theory proposes that most evolution is characterized by long periods of evolutionary stability, which is infrequently punctuated by swift periods of branching evolution. The theory was contrasted against phyletic gradualism, the popular idea that <b>evolutionary</b> <b>change</b> {{is marked by a}} pattern of smooth and continuous change in the fossil record.|$|E
5|$|Homology was {{noticed by}} Aristotle (c. 350 BC), and was {{explicitly}} analysed by Pierre Belon in his 1555 Book of Birds, where he systematically compared the skeletons {{of birds and}} humans.

5|$|Ticks satisfy all {{of their}} {{nutritional}} requirements as ectoparasites, feeding on a diet of blood. They are obligate hematophages, needing blood to survive and move from one stage of life to another. Ticks can fast for long periods but eventually die if {{unable to find a}} host. This behavior evolved approximately 120 million years ago through adaptation to blood-feeding. The behavior evolved independently in the separate tick families, with differing host-tick interactions driving the <b>evolutionary</b> <b>change.</b>|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe cell-biological {{events that}} guide early-embryonic {{development}} occur with great precision within species {{but can be}} quite diverse across species. How these cellular processes evolve and which molecular components underlie <b>evolutionary</b> <b>changes</b> is poorly understood. To begin to address these questions, we systematically investigated early embryogenesis, from the one- to the four-cell embryo, in 34 nematode species related to C. elegans. We found 40 cell-biological characters that captured the phenotypic differences between these species. By tracing the <b>evolutionary</b> <b>changes</b> on a molecular phylogeny, we found that these characters evolved multiple times and independently of one another. Strikingly, all these phenotypes are mimicked by single-gene RNAi experiments in C. elegans. We use these comparisons to hypothesize the molecular mechanisms underlying the <b>evolutionary</b> <b>changes.</b> For example, we predict that a cell polarity module was altered during {{the evolution of the}} Protorhabditis group and show that PAR- 1, a kinase localized asymmetrically in C. elegans early embryos, is symmetrically localized in the one-cell stage of Protorhabditis group species. Our genome-wide approach identifies candidate molecules—and thereby modules—associated with <b>evolutionary</b> <b>changes</b> in cell-biological phenotypes...|$|R

5|$|By the 1850s, {{whether or}} not species evolved was a subject of intense debate, with {{prominent}} scientists arguing {{both sides of the}} issue. The publication of Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species fundamentally transformed the discussion over biological origins. Darwin argued that his branching version of evolution explained a wealth of facts in biogeography, anatomy, embryology, and other fields of biology. He also provided the first cogent mechanism by which <b>evolutionary</b> <b>change</b> could persist: his theory of natural selection.|$|E
5|$|This {{meets the}} birds' high energy requirements, the most {{important}} determinants of flower choice. In Mimulus, an increase in red pigment in petals and flower nectar volume noticeably reduces the proportion of pollination by bees as opposed to hummingbirds; while greater flower surface area increases bee pollination. Therefore, red pigments in the flowers of Mimulus cardinalis may function primarily to discourage bee visitation. In Penstemon, flower traits that discourage bee pollination may be more influential on the flowers' <b>evolutionary</b> <b>change</b> than 'pro-bird' adaptations, but adaptation 'towards' birds and 'away' from bees can happen simultaneously. However, some flowers such as Heliconia angusta appear not to be as specifically ornithophilous as had been supposed: the species is occasionally (151 visits in 120 hours of observation) visited by Trigona stingless bees. These bees are largely pollen robbers in this case, but may also serve as pollinators.|$|E
5|$|The law {{of large}} numbers predicts that when the {{absolute}} number of copies of the allele is small (e.g., in small populations), the magnitude of drift on allele frequencies per generation is larger. The magnitude of drift {{is large enough to}} overwhelm selection at any allele frequency when the selection coefficient is less than 1 divided by the effective population size. Non-adaptive evolution resulting from the product of mutation and genetic drift is therefore considered to be a consequential mechanism of <b>evolutionary</b> <b>change</b> primarily within small, isolated populations. The mathematics of genetic drift depend on the effective population size, {{but it is not clear}} how this is related to the actual number of individuals in a population. Genetic linkage to other genes that are under selection can reduce the effective population size experienced by a neutral allele. With a higher recombination rate, linkage decreases and with it this local effect on effective population size. This effect is visible in molecular data as a correlation between local recombination rate and genetic diversity, and negative correlation between gene density and diversity at noncoding DNA regions. Stochasticity associated with linkage to other genes that are under selection is not the same as sampling error, and is sometimes known as genetic draft in order to distinguish it from genetic drift.|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackground: Changes in {{developmental}} gene expression {{are central to}} phenotypic evolution, but the genetic mechanisms underlying these changes are not well understood. Interspecific differences in gene expression can arise from <b>evolutionary</b> <b>changes</b> in cis-regulatory DNA and/or in the expression of trans-acting regulatory proteins, but few case studies have distinguished between these mechanisms. Here, we compare the regulation of the yellow gene, which is required for melanization, among distantly related Drosophila species with different pigment patterns and determine the phenotypic effects of divergent Yellow expression. Results: Yellow expression has diverged among D. melanogaster, D. subobscura, and D. virilis and, in all cases, correlates with the distribution of black melanin. Species-specific Yellow expression patterns were retained in D. melanogaster transformants carrying the D. subobscura and D. virilis yellow genes, indicating that sequence evolution within the yellow gene underlies the divergence of Yellow expression. <b>Evolutionary</b> <b>changes</b> in the activity of orthologous cis-regulatory elements are responsible for differences in abdominal Yellow expression; however, cis-regulatory element evolution is not the sole cause of divergent Yellow expression patterns. Transformation of the D. melanogaster yellow gene into D. virilis altered its expression pattern, indicating that trans-acting factors that regulate the D. melanogaster yellow gene have also diverged between these two species. Finally, {{we found that the}} phenotypic effects of <b>evolutionary</b> <b>changes</b> in Yellow expression depend on epistatic interactions with other genes. Conclusions: <b>Evolutionary</b> <b>changes</b> in Yellow expression correlate with divergent melanin patterns and are a result of evolution in both cis- and trans-regulation. These changes were likely necessary for the divergence of pigmentation, but <b>evolutionary</b> <b>changes</b> in other genes were also required...|$|R

25|$|Uracil {{is rarely}} found in DNA, {{and this may}} have been an <b>evolutionary</b> <b>change</b> to {{increase}} genetic stability. This is because cytosine can deaminate spontaneously to produce uracil through hydrolytic deamination.

25|$|While {{environmental}} factors are significantly responsible for <b>evolutionary</b> <b>change,</b> they act merely as agents for natural selection.
