40|$|Most MT systems rely on n-gram {{model to}} ensure the fluency, thus lacking syntax informa-tion on the target side. One {{solution}} is to use advanced translation models, like string-to-tree and tree-to-tree models, which unfortunately en-tail high complexity and difficult integration. A more promising way is to use structured language model, but it’s hard in two aspects: 1. significant growth of search space 2. incomparable hypothesis in original beams CONTRIBUTIONS We integrate a structured language model (SLM), a shift-reduce parser [1] in paticular, into an incremental tree-to-string system [2] to capture target-side syntax with low computational cost. Our main contributions are: 1. effective SLM integration into MT decoding 2. introduce an efficient grouping and pruning method to handle the growing search space 3. gain an average improvement of 0. 7 points in terms of (Ter-Bleu) / 2 over the baseline INTEGRATION SCHEMES We introduce three integration schemes: 1. Naïve: adding parsing signatures into translation signatures 2. Best-parse [3]: keeping the best dependency structure for each translation 3. Grouping: regrouping hypothesis by reduce steps in each bin The right figure shows our Grouping scheme: we group the hypothesis according to their reduce steps (N(S)), thus making them comparable in terms of dependency structure in each group. Then a two-phase pruning is performed: first keep the g-best hypothesis in each group, then se-lect the top-k groups. This could enhance parsing accuracy by avoiding the risk of greedy search.
