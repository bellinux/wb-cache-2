40|$|Abstract in Undetermined Over {{the last}} few years the {{interest}} in distributed generationand island operation of small production units hasincreased. Many of the existing such units are hydro power stations with induction generators. These are not initiallyconstructed for island operation, but with some extraequipment this kind of operation is feasible. In this paper the behaviour of two parallel-operated induction generatorsdriven by <b>hydro</b> <b>turbines</b> are studied during load steps.

50|$|A hydraucone {{is a form}} {{of draft}} tube used with a <b>hydro</b> <b>turbine.</b> It has a {{bell-mouth}} shape and its salient feature is a flat plate deflector near the mouth. The term hydraucone was introduced by William M. White, who obtained a U.S. patent for it in 1917.|$|E

50|$|A {{penstock}} (fr. conduite forcée) is a sluice or gate or {{intake structure}} that controls water flow, or an enclosed pipe that delivers water to <b>hydro</b> <b>turbines</b> and sewerage systems. The term is {{inherited from the}} earlier technology of mill ponds and watermills.|$|R
50|$|The Wave Dragon {{consists}} of two wave reflectors that direct the waves towards a ramp. Behind the ramp, a large reservoir collects the directed water, and temporarily stores the water. The reservoir is held above sea level. The water leaves the reservoir through <b>hydro</b> <b>turbines.</b>|$|R

Asian countries, notably China, India, and Japan, are playing an active role in power projects across the African continent. The majority of these power projects are hydro-based because of China's vast experience in the construction of hydro-power projects and part of the Energy & Power Growth Partnership Services programme.|$|E

Hydrokinetic turbines are suitable to tap this potential and the technology is recent which produces electricity from flowing water. Hydrokinetic turbines are more suitable to convert kinetic energy in the river and marine current. An extensive literature review has been carried out and presented in this paper. This paper basically summarizes existing hydrokinetic turbines and projects implemented so far.

The equipment selected was Bowing Francis turbines (based on a Swedish design), with English Electric Company generators. The generators, originally excited by separate <b>hydro</b> <b>turbine</b> driven exciters, were two 0.85 power factor examples rated at two megawatts each. The plant was later increased to three generating systems.|$|E

5000|$|By contrast, the Clyde {{hydro power}} station has {{controllable}} generation. It has four turbines and {{the steps in}} the duration curve show that one, two, three or four turbines (but not which individual turbines) were operating at their nominal output for various portions of the year. Thus, the Clyde power station was not generating at all for about a twentieth of the year (zero power up to about 0.05 of a year) and ran one turbine only for about {{a tenth of a}} year, the flat between 0.1 and 0.2. A <b>hydro</b> <b>turbine</b> is at its most efficient only near its design capacity and the flow of water is controlled accordingly. However, the power output can be varied a little (and the water pressure varies with lake level), nor need the operational level be changed only on half-hour boundaries, so the [...] "flats" [...] of the staircase are not completely flat nor the risers vertical. For new Plymouth, for two thirds of the year's half-hours it was not running at all.|$|E

40|$|Since <b>hydro</b> <b>turbines</b> are {{designed}} individually {{according to the}} local situation, this requires a huge engineering effort. In order to reduce this effort, automatic optimisation tools are necessary. In this paper the shape optimisation of a turbine draft tube is shown.

5000|$|During {{the drought}} year 2015, the inflows into the {{reservoir}} were very meagre due to failure of rains in the catchment area. However nearly 36 tmcft dead storage water {{available in the}} reservoir {{could not be used}} for the dire needs. With minor external modifications to the exiting reversible <b>hydro</b> <b>turbine</b> unit, all the dead storage water can be put to use during the drought years by using the hydro power plant for pumping water into the nearby left canal. Water would be released downstream into the tail pond over the spillway (if needed by siphon pipes). The pen stock of the hydro power unit is extended (less than 100 m long) to connect to the nearby left canal. The hydro power unit is operated in pumping mode to pump water from the tail pond to the left canal when the reservoir level is below the canal's minimum draw down level (MDDL). The pen stock extension piping is detached when water pumping to the canal is not required to restore its normal power generation when the reservoir level is above the left canal's MDDL ...|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "foil" [...] {{is used to}} {{describe}} the shape of the blade cross-section at a given point, with no distinction for the type of fluid, (thus referring to either an [...] "airfoil" [...] or [...] "hydrofoil"). In the helical design, the blades curve around the axis, which has the effect of evenly distributing the foil sections throughout the rotation cycle, so there is always a foil section at every possible angle of attack. In this way, the sum of the lift and drag forces on each blade do not change abruptly with rotation angle. The turbine generates a smoother torque curve, so there is much less vibration and noise than in the Darrieus design. It also minimizes peak stresses in the structure and materials, and facilitates self-starting of the turbine. In testing environments the GHT has been observed to have up to 35% efficiency in energy capture reported by several groups. [...] "Among the other vertical-axis turbine systems, the Davis <b>Hydro</b> <b>turbine,</b> the EnCurrent turbine, and the Gorlov Helical turbine have all undergone scale testing at laboratory or sea. Overall, these technologies represent the current norm of tidal current development." ...|$|E
50|$|During {{the drought}} year 2015, the inflows into the {{reservoir}} were very meagre due to failure of rains in the catchment area. However nearly 18 tmcft dead storage water {{available in the}} reservoir {{could not be used}} for the dire needs. With minor external modifications to the exiting reversible <b>hydro</b> <b>turbine</b> unit, most of the dead storage water can be put to use during the drought years by using the hydro power plant for pumping water into the nearby right canal. Water would be released downstream into the tail pond over the spillway (if needed by siphon pipes). Nearly five km long contour canal at MDDL of the right canal in the reservoir area is constructed to connect the power house area with the right canal intake point. The pen stock of the hydro power unit is extended (less than 100 m long) to connect to the contour canal. The hydro power unit is operated in pumping mode to pump water from the tail pond to the right canal when the reservoir level is below the canal's minimum draw down level (MDDL). The pen stock extension piping is detached when water pumping to the canal is not required to restore its normal power generation when the reservoir level is above the right canal's MDDL When the reservoir level is above the right canal MDDL level, the contour canal located in the reservoir area gets submerged with out suffering any damage as it is not obstructing the flood flow to the dam spillway.|$|E
