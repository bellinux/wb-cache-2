5|$|During World War II, Kistiakowsky was {{the head}} of the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC) section {{responsible}} for the development of explosives, and the technical director of the Explosives Research Laboratory (ERL), where he oversaw the development of new explosives, including RDX and HMX. He was involved in research into the hydrodynamic theory of explosions, and the development of shaped charges. In October 1943, he was brought into the Manhattan Project as a consultant. He was soon placed in charge of X Division, which was responsible for the development of the explosive lenses necessary for an implosion-type nuclear weapon. In July 1945, <b>he</b> <b>watched</b> <b>as</b> the first one was detonated in the Trinity test. A few weeks later another Fat Man implosion-type weapon was dropped on Nagasaki.|$|E
5|$|A {{soldier on}} {{vacation}} here said he witnessed a terrible atrocity {{in the occupied}} parts of Poland. <b>He</b> <b>watched</b> <b>as</b> naked Jewish {{men and women were}} placed in front of a long deep ditch and upon the order of the SS were shot by Ukrainians {{in the back of their}} heads and they fell into the ditch. Then the ditch was filled with dirt even as he could still hear screams coming from people still alive in the ditch. These inhuman atrocities were so terrible that some of the Ukrainians, who were used as tools, suffered nervous breakdowns. All the soldiers who had knowledge of these bestial actions of these Nazi sub-humans were of the opinion that the German people should be shaking in their shoes because of the coming retribution. There is no punishment that would be hard enough to be applied to these Nazi beasts. Of course, when the retribution comes, the innocent will have to suffer along with them. But because ninety-nine percent of the German population is guilty, directly or indirectly, for the present situation, we can only say that those who travel together will hang together. , Friedrich Kellner exhibit.

25|$|When he {{was still}} in college, Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane created a cartoon short called The Life of Larry. The short {{centered}} around a middle-aged man named Larry and his anthropomorphic dog Steve. He made a sequel called Larry & Steve, which Cartoon Network broadcast in 1997. In 1999, MacFarlane was working for Hanna-Barbara Studios, writing for shows such as Johnny Bravo, Dexter's Laboratory, and Cow and Chicken. The short caught the eye of 20th Century Fox representatives, who asked him to create a TV series revolving around the characters. MacFarlane received a US$50,000 budget to develop a pilot for the show, which was about one twentieth of what most pilots cost. MacFarlane claims to have drawn inspiration from several sitcoms, namely The Simpsons and All in the Family. Several premises were also carried over from several 1980s Saturday morning cartoons <b>he</b> <b>watched</b> <b>as</b> a child, namely The Fonz and the Happy Days Gang, and Rubik, the Amazing Cube.|$|E

500|$|Executives at Fox saw the Larry {{shorts and}} {{contracted}} MacFarlane {{to create a}} series, entitled Family Guy, based on the characters. Fox proposed MacFarlane complete a 15-minute short, {{and gave him a}} budget of $50,000. Several aspects of Family Guy were inspired by the Larry shorts. While working on the series, the characters of Larry and his dog Steve slowly evolved into Peter and Brian. MacFarlane stated that the difference between The Life of Larry and Family Guy was that [...] "Life of Larry was shown primarily in my dorm room and Family Guy was shown after the Super Bowl." [...] After the pilot aired, the series was given the green light. MacFarlane drew inspiration from several sitcoms such as The Simpsons and All in the Family.

500|$|Shostakovich {{fell from}} {{official}} favour in 1936. The year {{began with a}} series of attacks on him in Pravda, in particular an article entitled, [...] "Muddle Instead of Music". Shostakovich was away on a concert tour in Arkhangelsk when he heard news of the first Pravda article. Two days before the article was published on the evening of 28 January, a friend had advised Shostakovich to attend the Bolshoi Theatre production of Lady Macbeth. When he arrived, he saw that Joseph Stalin and the Politburo were there. In letters written to his friend Ivan Sollertinsky, Shostakovich recounted the horror with which <b>he</b> <b>watched</b> <b>as</b> Stalin shuddered every time the brass and percussion played too loudly. Equally horrifying was the way Stalin and his companions laughed at the love-making scene between Sergei and Katerina.

500|$|The {{knee injury}} {{hampered}} Suter {{throughout much of}} the 1986–87 season; he attempted to play through it, but ultimately missed 12 games. [...] Nonetheless, he still scored 49 points in 68 games played. Healthy for 1987–88, Suter had the finest season of his career. His 70 assists and 91 points were the highest single season totals he would record in his career. He played in his second All-Star Game, was named a Second Team All-Star and was a finalist for the James Norris Memorial Trophy as the NHL's top defenseman. Suter appeared in his third All-Star Game in 1988–89, but missed 16 games after undergoing an emergency appendectomy. He had 62 points in 63 games. As had happened in 1986, Suter was injured {{in the early stages of}} a deep post-season run by the Flames.

Hayes's victory in the election left Hay [...] an outsider as he sought a return to politics, and he was initially offered {{no place in the}} new administration. Nevertheless, Hay attempted to ingratiate himself with the new President by sending him a gold ring with a strand of George Washington's hair, a gesture that Hayes deeply appreciated. Hay spent time working with Nicolay on their Lincoln biography, and traveling in Europe. [...] When Reid, who had succeeded Greeley as editor of the Tribune, was offered the post of Minister to Germany in December 1878, he turned it down and recommended Hay. [...] Secretary of State William M.

500|$|Jack Wall, born in Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, {{earned a}} degree in civil {{engineering}} from Drexel University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and began a career [...] "planning out sub-divisions and shopping malls". At the same time he was in a rock band, as he was also interested in music. After recording a demo tape with the band, he was inspired to change career paths and quit his job to work in the music industry. He initially worked as a bartender and later started working in recording studios in Philadelphia and later Boston and New York City, where he worked for Skyline Studios. In 1991 Wall left Skyline, and until 1994 worked as an independent music producer and sound engineer in New York City, working with musicians such as John Cale, David Byrne, and Patti Smith, as well as local bands. Over those three years, Wall consistently worked with Cale, eventually handling arrangement and orchestration of Cale's compositions as well as producing and working as a sound engineer.

500|$|During November 1776, General George Washington {{passed through}} Teaneck in the {{aftermath}} of the Battle of Fort Lee, as part of the hasty retreat of ragtag Colonial forces from Fort Lee on the Hudson River in the wake of the successful British invasion and defeat of Continental Army forces in Manhattan on the opposite side of the river during the Battle of Fort Washington. Early on the morning of November 20, 1776, Washington rode by horseback from his headquarters in Hackensack through Teaneck and across Overpeck Creek to Fort Lee. There <b>he</b> <b>watched</b> <b>as</b> 6,000 British troops travel up the river by boat. He had his troops abandon their position on the Palisades in a poorly organized retreat in which most of their supplies were abandoned, with Washington's troops moving inland across Overpeck Creek and through Teaneck to New Bridge Landing (in what is now Brett Park) and crossing the bridge, one of the few available at the time. The soldiers, many poorly dressed, ill-equipped and without shoes, faced the cold rain, leading Thomas Paine to compose the pamphlet, The American Crisis, in which he captured the depth of the defeat by describing those days with the words [...] "These are the times that try men's souls". Throughout the war, both British and American forces occupied local homesteads at various times, and Teaneck citizens played key roles on both sides of the conflict.|$|E
500|$|The {{fruit of}} the Philadelphia {{recording}} sessions was Young Americans (1975). Biographer Christopher Sandford writes, [...] "Over the years, most British rockers had tried, one way or another, to become black-by-extension. Few had succeeded as Bowie did now." [...] The album's sound, which the singer identified as [...] "plastic soul", constituted a radical shift in style that initially alienated many of his UK devotees. Young Americans yielded Bowie's first US number one, [...] "Fame", co-written with John Lennon, who contributed backing vocals, and Carlos Alomar. Lennon called Bowie's work [...] "great, but it's just rock'n'roll with lipstick on". Earning {{the distinction of being}} one of the first white artists to appear on the US variety show Soul Train, Bowie mimed [...] "Fame", as well as [...] "Golden Years", his November single, which was originally offered to Elvis Presley, who declined it. Young Americans was a commercial success in both the US and the UK, and a re-issue of the 1969 single [...] "Space Oddity" [...] became Bowie's first number-one hit in the UK a few months after [...] "Fame" [...] achieved the same in the US. Despite his by now well established superstardom, Bowie, in the words of Sandford, [...] "for all his record sales (over a million copies of Ziggy Stardust alone), existed essentially on loose change." [...] In 1975, in a move echoing Ken Pitt's acrimonious dismissal five years earlier, Bowie fired his manager. At the culmination of the ensuing months-long legal dispute, <b>he</b> <b>watched,</b> <b>as</b> described by Sandford, [...] "millions of dollars of his future earnings being surrendered" [...] in what were [...] "uniquely generous terms for Defries", then [...] "shut himself up in West 20th Street, where for a week his howls could be heard through the locked attic door." [...] Michael Lippman, Bowie's lawyer during the negotiations, became his new manager; Lippman in turn was awarded substantial compensation when Bowie fired him the following year.|$|E
