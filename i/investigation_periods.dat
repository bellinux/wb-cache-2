Unknown and steep topography of the slope, covered by unstable debris material, imposed the usage of a Remotely Piloted Aircraft System (RPAS) to provide the data about the present slope topography. The landslide 3 D point cloud was derived using Structure-from-Motion (SfM) photogrammetry, and to verify the cloud of georeferenced sliding points delivered from images, it was compared with the existing models acquired from terrestrial photogrammetry and laser scanning in the Valley from 2012.In general, it can be noticed that drones are closing the gaps in small scale remote sensing, as they allow the acquisition of topographic data at low cost and possibly repeated survey in short period. The comparison of the digital elevation model recorded with LiDAR imaginary, RAPS and SfM application, shows good accordance what evidences that RPAS and photogrammetry as low-cost and high-resolution are efficient tools, which can be employed effectively to record changes of landslide topography through time.|$|E

Interrelationships of subjective assessments—thermal sensation, perceptions and preferences for individual climate parameters—were analyzed, {{as well as their}} connections with the prevailing thermal conditions [air temperature, relative humidity, wind velocity, mean radiant temperature and physiologically equivalent temperature (PET) ]. Thermal sensation showed strong positive relationships with air temperature and solar radiation perception, while wind velocity and air humidity perception had a negative (and weaker) impact. If a parameter was perceived to be low or weak, then it was usually desired to be higher or stronger. This negative correlation was weakest in the case of humidity. Of the basic meteorological parameters, Hungarians are most sensitive to variations in wind. Above PET 029 °C, people usually prefer lower air temperature and less solar radiation. The temperature values perceived by the interviewees correlated stronger with PET, but their means were more similar to air temperature. It was also found that the mean thermal sensation of Hungarians in transient seasons depends on PET according to a quadratic function (R 200. 912) and, consequently, the thermal comfort ranges of the locals differ from that usually adopted...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Everyday {{stressors}} elicit adaptive {{changes in}} the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the autonomic nervous system. Data {{on the relationship between}} these two systems under real-life conditions are sparse. We, therefore, sought to examine the association between HRV and salivary cortisol, which were recorded simultaneously in a stress-exposed, prospective, occupational cohort. METHODS: The study population comprised 88 nurses. We recorded heart rate (HR) and HRV during 301 working shifts. Participants provided salivary cortisol samples {{at the beginning of their}} work shift and every 2 hours thereafter. Samples were collected during three <b>investigation</b> <b>periods</b> spread over 9 months. Change scores for cortisol were calculated as deviations from the expected circadian baseline. Change scores from the grand diurnal mean in the time domain-based root mean square of successive differences served to index alterations in HRV. To account for the temporal delay between changes in HR/HRV and changes in salivary cortisol, the latter were compared with the changes in HR/HRV observed 15 minutes to 45 minutes before the cortisol sampling. RESULTS: During periods of high stress as indexed by high cortisol levels, we found significant associations between cortisol levels and HR (r =. 48, p <. 001) and HRV (r = -. 28, p =. 05). However, during low stress periods, these associations were attenuated and became nonsignificant. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest a relative independence in the regulation of the HPA axis and the autonomic nervous system in response to everyday stressors but synchrony of both systems in highly stressful situations...|$|E

Although there was a reduction in nutrient load, cyanobacteria blooms were observed from 1994 onwards. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare physical and chemical parameters and the zooplankton community between two <b>investigation</b> <b>periods</b> (February-December 2002 and January 2003 -February 2004) that were separated by an extreme flood event in November 2001 affecting the total plankton community. From the analysis of the data sampled in 2002 - 2003, an increase in transparency (from 3. 5 m to 5. 7 m) and a decrease in chlorophyll α concentration (from 6 μg 1 - 1 to 1. 5 μg 1 - 1), both measured during the circulation period (December-February), were recorded. Within the phytoplankton, a shift from cyanobacteria to chlorophytes was detected. The zooplankton community changed in the composition of species, that is a higher number of species known to be less tolerant to toxic cyanobacteria were observed. The results emphasise that the flood event at the end of 2002 accelerated the process of reoligotrophication in the lake and contributed to an increased diversification of the zooplankton community. The generally increasing frequency of occurrence of flooding events following heavy rainfalls might be considered a major factor in regulating plankton community composition in the future...|$|E

The negative effect of ozone is cumulative during the growing season; hence crops are the most sensitive plants. Visible symptoms and biomass losses can cause economic losses. Tobacco plants have been recognized as one of the best bioindicators, but data on the cumulative effect of ozone on this species are limited. Results of an experiment with ozone-sensitive tobacco plants grown on sites varying in ozone concentration are presented in this paper. Two indices were used for data presentation of visible leaf injury degree. Higher solar radiation was the main cause of higher ozone concentration at the rural site. Higher tropospheric ozone concentrations were noted in 2010 in comparison to 2011, which was reflected in visible leaf injury. Canonical variate analysis did not reveal highly significant differences between sites, however, differences were observed in certain <b>investigation</b> <b>periods.</b> Moreover, higher leaf injury was noted at the rural site at the end of the experiment in both experimental years.

30|$|In many businesses, {{predicting}} {{the next set}} of customer actions is of central importance as this capability enables companies to forestall undesirable decisions of the customers. Among those, churn prediction has attracted increasing attention from a variety of domains such as telecommunication and banking industries as well as researchers in academia, as retaining customers is far less costly than acquiring new ones [4]. The cost of making a new customer as profitable as a current customer could be up to 16 times higher than the cost of retaining efforts [5], and decreasing the churn rate by only 5 % can increase the profitability by 25 – 125 % [6]. According to a survey carried out with over 24 thousand customers in 33 countries [7], 68 % of the churning customers expressed that they would not do business again with the companies that they left. The cost of such provider switches of customers is estimated to be $ 1.6 trillion for the United States. However, predicting whether the customer will quit his or her contract seems to be a rather daunting task, due to the unpredictable nature of active decisions of customers, such as quitting contract due to unsatisfactory service [8], and incidental or non-voluntary events, such as change of home/work locations or financial troubles [9]. Complexity becomes even worse for the financial churn prediction due to the relative sparsity of the transactions compared to other domains such as telecommunication. Furthermore, the financial decisions might require longer <b>investigation</b> <b>periods</b> (e.g., loan) leading to the development of heuristics for the churn prevention efforts rather than prediction models based on transactional data.|$|E
40|$|Rapid urban {{expansion}} {{in cities across}} the globe is forcing the development of appropriate methods to monitor the status {{as well as the}} historical evolution of urban areas to support applications like urban planning and management. Here, remote sensing data have proven to be an effective tool to delineate urban areas, since they provide satellite imagery for large areas at a relatively high temporal frequency with the additional advantage of free access to data archives comprising data back to 1972. This study proposes a novel fully automated classification system based on Support Vector Machines (SVM) to derive urban extent maps. For this purpose, multi-temporal Landsat time-series namely temporal statistics consisting of selected spectral and temporal indices, have been employed for the 8 sites included in the urban supersites initiative of the Group on Earth Observation (GEO) and the <b>investigation</b> <b>periods</b> 2002 – 2003 and 2013 – 2015.

The derived results report the automated SVM based classification system to be quite promising and in addition it proved to be very robust since it resulted in high accuracies throughout all study areas.

The main problems of the Danube River basin are associated with nutrients, organic pollution and hazardous pollutants. The aim {{of the study is}} to assess the surface water of the Danube in Budapest for sustainability of human and environment health. Approach: The monitoring assessment of comparative studies was carried out in June of 1998, 2005 and 2010 using the Hungarian standard methods. The samples were collected in sterile dark bottles from three different zones in Budapest. Results: The results demonstrated that dissolved organic carbon content, nutrient pollution (total N and P), bacteriological parameters and chlorophyll-a content were higher in 2005 than in 1998 and 2010. The results indicated that the bacteriological assessments and bacterial populations were low in 1998 in comparison with the results of 2010. In 2005, investigations illustrate the high fecal pollution. The data showed no significant differences between temperature, pH and Electrical conductivity in 1998, 2005 and 2010. Conclusion/Recommendations: Monitoring of the water by physicochemical and bacteriological is essential to identify the aquatic ecosystem hazards. The relation between O 2 and Chl-a content of the samples, clearly shows that the cause of high dissolved O 2 content in the water lies in accelerated primary production. Enumerations of both total and fecal Coliforms are continuously growing during the <b>investigation</b> <b>periods.</b> These results suggested that bacteriological properties can be a specific indicator of fecal contamination and organic pollution.

40|$|For {{the purpose}} of {{mangrove}} restoration in China, Sonneratia caseolaris has been introduced and planted in Guangdong Province outside and north of its native habitat, Hainan Province. We monitored the litter fall and forest structure of this S. caseolaris forest in Shenzhen City, Guangdong Province, China. from 1996 to 2005. The annual fluctuation in litter fall increased with increases in air temperature from spring to early summer, and reached a maximum in autumn when the fruits matured. The total litter fall was significantly affected by air temperature, day length, and evaporation, rainfall in the previous month and by typhoons. In 1998, the sixth year after cultivation, the total litter production of the mature S. caseolaris forest significantly increased. The mean annual total litter production during 1998 - 2005 was 15. 1 t ha(- 1) yr(- 1), among which, leaves and reproductive materials contributed more than 80 % of the total. During the ten years of study, the DBH (diameter at 1. 30 m from ground level) and tree height of S. caseolaris increased from 5. 2 cm to 18. 3 cm, and from 4. 5 m to 13. 4 m, respectively.

To study their potential origin we compared drift from historically known strobilation areas derived from a circulation model with spatial distributions observed during 19 cruises in the BB during 2002 and 2003. The model results are in good accordance with the field observations. According to the model results inter-annual differences in the timing of first appearance and life stage at appearance of A. aurita were clearly related to differences in the hydrodynamic regime during the <b>investigation</b> <b>periods.</b> During the stagnation regime in 2002 young medusae occurred first in June in the BB. In contrast, in 2003 fast transport due to several inflow events advected ephyrae released between January and March in the western Baltic already in April to the BB. Although the Gullmar Fjord (western Sweden) is the nearest known strobilation area for C. capillata, the model did not support advection from there in numbers explaining the occurrence of this species in the BB in 2002 and 2003. If the model works adequately in this regions we have to assume that the Gullmar Fjord is not a main source region of C. capillata in the BB, but other strobilation areas in the Kattegat or the North Sea appear more important. Our results imply that advection and inflow events are critical for the occurrence and distribution of early stages of jellyfish in the central Baltic Sea.

Dense and long time series of remote sensing data enable detailed studies of the rapid glaciological changes in this area. We present results of a study on Fleming Glacier, which was the former major tributary glacier of former Wordie Ice Shelf, located at the south-western side of the Antarctic Peninsula. Since the ice shelf disintegrated in a series of events starting in the 1970 s, only disconnected tidewater glaciers have remained today. As a reaction to the loss of the buttressing force of the ice shelf, Fleming Glacier accelerated and dynamically thinned. However, all previous studies conducted at Wordie Bay covered only relatively short <b>investigation</b> <b>periods</b> and ended in 2008 the latest. Hence it was not well known how long the process of adaption to the changing boundary conditions exactly lasts and how it is characterized in detail. We provide long time series (1994 – 2016) of glaciological parameters (i. e. ice extent, velocity, grounding line position, ice elevation) for Fleming Glacier obtained from multi-mission remote sensing data. For this purpose large datasets of previously active (e. g. ERS, Envisat, ALOS PALSAR, Radarsat- 1) as well as currently recording SAR sensors (e. g. Sentinel- 1, TerraSAR-X, TanDEM-X) were processed and combined with data from other sources (e. g. optical images, laser altimeter and ice thickness data). The high temporal resolution of our dataset enables us to present a detailed history of 22 years of glacial dynamics at Fleming Glacier after the disintegration of Wordie Ice Shelf. We found strong evidence for a rapid grounding line retreat of up to 13 km between 2008 and 2011, which led to a further amplification of dynamic ice thinning. Today Fleming Glacier seems to be far away from approaching a new equilibrium. Our data show that the current glacier dynamics of Fleming Glacier are not primarily controlled by the loss of the ice shelf anymore, but by other sources of external forcing, such as oceanic warming...|$|E

Experiments were carried out on a laboratory scale in order to imitate the uptake of Vibrio spp. in mussels under controlled environmental conditions, monitoring the concentration changes of Vibrio during the various studies. The aim of mussel contamination tests was to evaluate the behavior of Vibrio spp. in mussels after artificial contamination. Various studies highlighted high loads of Vibrio spp. in mussels, other seafood and mussel farming areas. Thus, three research strategies were performed investigating contamination, clearance and storage. Contamination assays showed that Vibrio accumulates within 1. 5 hours in digestive glands, up to concentrations of approx. 107 CFU/g to 108 CFU/g. Clearing experiments {{over a period of}} seven days showed a slow continuous reduction of Vibrio concentrations, however Vibrio were detected during the whole <b>investigation</b> <b>periods.</b> A decrease rate of 0. 02 log CFU/g per hour was found by tracing of Vibrio spp. Concentrations in the digestive glands of Mytilus edulis. Storage experiments were performed over a period of ten days after 24 -hours of contamination. Mussels were packed according to retail conditions (in jute bags and vacuum bags including 200 ml of ASW). The persistence of Vibrio spp. were achieved at 3 °C in melting ice and at 15 °C in a refrigerator. It was shown that under storage V. cholerae and V. parahaemolyticus counts were stable. Only fluctuations in the range of 2 log stages were detected. However, V. vulnificus concentrations declined slowly but steadily. Mytilus edulis accumulates Vibrio rapidly to high numbers, clearance kinetics are slow and eradication of Vibrio seems slow whereas storage conditions keep Vibrio alive with stable counts. The present study confirms that within mussels Vibrio concentrations can be achieved, which are dangerous to human health, if mussels were consumed raw or only partially cooked. Especially the maintenance of the cold chain from catch to counter is crucial to avoid a possible multiplication of Vibrio in seafood...|$|E
40|$|The Antarctic Peninsula {{is one of}} the world`s most {{affected}} regions by Climate Change. Dense and long time series of multi-mission SAR data enable detailed studies of the rapid glaciological changes in this area. We present first results of a case study at the former Wordie Ice Shelf, located at the south-western side of the Antarctic Peninsula. Since the ice shelf disintegrated in a series of events during the 1980 s, only disconnected and retreating tidewater glaciers have remained. Due to the loss of the buttressing force of the ice shelf, the former tributary glaciers reacted with an acceleration of their flow speeds in order to adapt to the new boundary conditions. While the loss of the ice shelf itself does not affect sea level, the increased outflow of the glaciers and the associated mass loss contribute to global sea level rise. Most of the studies conducted at Wordie Bay so far covered only relatively short <b>investigation</b> <b>periods</b> and compared their results on a bi-temporal basis. Hence it is yet neither well known how long this process of adaption to the new boundary conditions exactly lasts nor how much ice mass loss and sea level rise is caused by this process in total. We provide completest possible time series of glaciological parameters (e. g. glacier extends, grounding line positions, flow speeds, glacier mass flow, glacier elevation/volume changes and contributions to global sea level rise) for the glaciers in Wordie Bay, ranging from the early 1990 s to today. The glaciological parameters are determined by applying differential interferometric synthetic radar (DInSAR) methods as well as intensity tracking and differential range offset tracking. For this purpose large datasets of previously active (e. g. ERS, ALOS PALSAR) as well as currently recording SAR sensors (e. g. Sentinel- 1, TerraSAR-X, TanDEM-X) are processed together with data from photogrammetry, laser/radar altimetry and ground penetrating radar. The usage of long-term series of SAR data allows us to obtain more precise series of glacier monitoring measurements, which is assumed to contribute {{to a better understanding of}} the climate-triggered glaciological processes on the Antarctic Peninsula and the Wordie Bay respectively...|$|E
