5|$|In 1815 the Congress of Vienna fully re-established Swiss {{independence}} and the European powers agreed to permanently recognise Swiss neutrality. Swiss troops still served foreign governments until 1860 when they fought in the Siege of Gaeta. The treaty also allowed Switzerland to increase its territory, with the admission of the cantons of Valais, Neuchâtel and Geneva. Switzerland's borders <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>changed</b> since, except for some minor adjustments.|$|E
5|$|The {{cannibalism}} of {{the frog}} {{has been speculated}} to cause its decline in some areas, because the smaller tadpoles can be toxic. Other postulated causes of the decline include increased ultraviolet radiation due to {{the hole in the}} ozone layer, global warming, and increased drought. The first theory was tested and the results were inconclusive. Global warming is not thought to be a credible cause, as the extremities of the frog's range <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>changed,</b> while declines in population have occurred in both dry and wetter areas.|$|E

25|$|The {{feeder lines}} for the Brooklyn {{side of the}} tracks <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>changed</b> since subway service began on the bridge. It has always been fed by tracks from the BMT Fourth Avenue Line and the BMT Brighton Line; however, the {{junction}} between the lines was reconstructed in 1956, and Myrtle Avenue subway station, just near the foot of the bridge, was closed. On the Manhattan side, however, the two north tracks originally connected to the BMT Broadway Line (where the south tracks now connect) while the two south tracks curved south to join the BMT Nassau Street Line towards Chambers Street. This connection has been severed and the tracks are now used for storage.|$|E
25|$|Majolica pottery {{has been}} made in the state since colonial times after being {{introduced}} by the Spanish. Since then, areas have developed specialties in form and decoration, but techniques <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>changed</b> much for over 400 years. Most clay is extracted from the Dolores Hidalgo region and most is produced in Dolores Hidalgo, San Miguel de Allende and the city of Guanajuato. Another area noted for its work is Tarandacuaro, which makes high-fire ceramics. The two best-known workshops are Fabrica Javier Servin and Taller Checuan. The ceramics of this area have distinctive, very intricate, mostly geometric designs, which are painted on by hand. The municipality promotes the work through its Centro Turistico de Desarrollo de Tarandacuao.|$|E

25|$|By far {{the biggest}} problem with the {{conventional}} approach is cost; solar cells require a relatively thick layer of doped silicon in order to have reasonable photon capture rates, and silicon processing is expensive. There {{have been a number of}} different approaches to reduce this cost over the last decade, notably the thin-film approaches, but to date they have seen limited application due to a variety of practical problems. Another line of research has been to dramatically improve efficiency through the multi-junction approach, although these cells are very high cost and suitable only for large commercial deployments. In general terms the types of cells suitable for rooftop deployment <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>changed</b> significantly in efficiency, although costs have dropped somewhat due to increased supply.|$|E
25|$|In Thailand, {{two types}} of edible insects (cricket and palm weevil larvae) are {{commonly}} farmed {{in the north and}} south respectively. Cricket-farming approaches throughout the northeast are similar and breeding techniques <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>changed</b> much since the technology was introduced 15 years ago. Small-scale cricket farming, involving a small number of breeding tanks, is rarely found today and most of the farms are medium- or large-scale enterprises. Community cooperatives of cricket farmers have been established to disseminate information on technical farming, marketing and business issues, particularly in northeastern and northern Thailand. Cricket farming has developed into a significant animal husbandry sector and is the main source of income for a number of farmers. In 2013, there are approximately 20 000 farms operating 217 529 rearing pens. Total production over the last six years (1996-2011) has averaged around 7 500 tonnes per year.|$|E
25|$|The rate {{of human}} {{trafficking}} has directly increased in correlation with globalization. Globalization has increased cross-border {{trade and the}} demand for cheap labor; however, migration policies of the U.S. and other countries <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>changed</b> with the level of demand for cheap labor, thus forcing people illegally to immigrate. Illegal immigration then creates ideal conditions for organized criminal operations to form trafficking circles. With increased trade of foreign goods to rural areas, import competition in the rural markets has also forced people in poor areas to migrate to industrialized economies for better livelihoods. Their desperate positions often make them subject to exploitation and trafficking into different forms of forced labor to support that economy. Lastly, the technological advances that go hand in hand with globalization have facilitated the ease with which organized crime circles may conduct trafficking operations.|$|E

25|$|The {{immediate}} ancestry of the cultivated olive is unknown. O. europaea {{may have}} arisen from O. chrysophylla in northern tropical Africa and was {{introduced into the}} countries of the Mediterranean Basin via Egypt and then Crete or the Levant, Tunisia, and Asia Minor. Fossil Olea pollen has been found in Macedonia and other places around the Mediterranean, indicating that this genus is an original element of the Mediterranean flora. Fossilized leaves of Olea were found in the palaeosols of the volcanic Greek island of Santorini (Thera) and were dated about 37,000 BP. Imprints of larvae of olive whitefly Aleurolobus (Aleurodes) olivinus were found on the leaves. The same insect is commonly found today on olive leaves, showing that the plant-animal co-evolutionary relations <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>changed</b> since that time. Other leaves found on the same island are dated back to 60,000 BP, making them the oldest known olives from the Mediterranean.|$|E
25|$|On 2 May 2014, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) {{confirmed}} the first diagnosis of MERS in the United States at Community Hospital in Munster Indiana. The man diagnosed was {{a health care}} worker {{who had been in}} Saudi Arabia a week earlier, and was reported to be in good condition. A second patient who also traveled from Saudi Arabia was reported in Orlando, Florida on 12 May 2014. On 14 May 2014, officials in the Netherlands reported the first case has appeared. On Saturday, 17 May 2014, a man from Illinois who was a business associate of the first U.S. case (he had met and shook hands with the Indiana health care worker) tested positive for the MERS coronavirus, but has not, as of yet, displayed symptoms (others are probably also, at least temporarily if not permanently, non-symptomatic carriers). The CDC's Dr. David Swerdlow, who is leading the agency's response, said the man, who feels well and has not yet sought and does not yet need medical care, has not been deemed an official case yet and prevention guidelines <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>changed.</b> Laboratory tests showed evidence of past infection in his blood.|$|E
25|$|Impressed by the children's singing, Max proposes he enter {{them in the}} {{upcoming}} Salzburg Festival but the suggestion is immediately rejected by the Captain as he does not allow his children to sing in public. He does agree, however, to organize a grand party at the villa. The night of the party, while guests in formal attire waltz in the ballroom, Maria and the children look on from the garden terrace. When the Captain notices Maria teaching Kurt the traditional Ländler folk dance, he cuts in and partners with Maria in a graceful performance, culminating in a close embrace. Confused about her feelings, Maria blushes and breaks away. Later, the Baroness, who noticed the Captain's attraction to Maria, hides her jealousy while convincing Maria that she must return to the abbey. Back at the abbey, when Mother Abbess learns that Maria has stayed in seclusion to avoid her feelings for the Captain, she encourages her {{to return to the}} villa to look for her life. After Maria returns to the villa, she learns about the Captain's engagement to the Baroness and agrees to stay until they find a replacement governess. The Captain's feelings for Maria, however, <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>changed,</b> and after breaking off his engagement the Captain marries Maria.|$|E
