500|$|The {{reception}} of BuzzSaw has been generally positive. Melinda Siegmeier of the Gold Coast Bulletin stated [...] "the scream machine {{is certainly a}} fitting way to describe Dreamworld's newest thrill ride the BuzzSaw". Siegmeier also commented on the vertical lift hill: [...] "by this stage I was certainly wishing <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>back</b> on the ground". Ardent Leisure, the owners of Dreamworld, have claimed {{the launch of the}} ride to be a success. In the first year of operation, over 435,000 people rode the attraction. However, in the worldwide Best Roller Coaster Poll in 2012, BuzzSaw (along with other identical SkyLoop rides) ranked 221 out of 365.|$|E
500|$|When Goebel's son, Paul G. Goebel, Jr., ran for Ford's Congressional seat in 1974, then President Ford {{returned}} to Grand Rapids {{to campaign for}} Goebel's son. Ford delivered a speech at Calvin College in Grand Rapids {{the week before the}} election in which he said: [...] "Paul Goebel I have known since he was just a lad. His dad knew me when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>back</b> at South High—an inspired if not very competent football player. But I have known the Goebel family a long time, and they are strong and they are tall, and they are {{the kind of people who}} are dedicated to public service. Paul, Jr.'s, father was; Paul, Jr., himself is. And I have seen nothing but the finest in that family, and young Paul, he epitomizes all the great characteristics of that family." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Mom and Pop Art" [...] {{was written}} by current showrunner Al Jean and {{directed}} by Steven Dean Moore. It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on April11,1999. It was the first episode Jean wrote after returning to The Simpsons writing staff. For three years, Jean had worked with Mike Reiss on the fantasy sitcom Teen Angel, a job which he despised. [...] "Every other day [...] I said 'I wish <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>back</b> at The Simpsons," [...] Jean said in the DVD commentary for the episode. The idea for the episode came from {{a segment of the}} television news magazine 60 Minutes. The segment was about found artists, who, Jean said, [...] "take basically garbage and assemble it and turn it into artwork that would sell {{for tens of thousands of}} dollars." [...] Jean thought that this profession would fit Homer. In the episode, [...] "Start here tomorrow 7/17/95" [...] is written in blue paint on the Simpsons' garage door. The date refers to Scully and Julie Thacker's anniversary, which was on July17,1995. In the episode's setpiece, the Simpsons visit a hardware store. The segment was inspired by Jean's father, who owned a hardware store that Al Jean used to work in as a child. Later in the setpiece, Homer tries to construct a barbecue that he bought from the hardware store. The scene was also conceived by Jean, and is executive producer and former showrunner Mike Scully's favorite setpiece.|$|E

2500|$|While hosting The Late Late Show, Tubridy {{has often}} clashed {{with his own}} guests, {{including}} Gordon Ramsay ("a bit, em, British for my liking"), Louis Walsh (giving Jedward a [...] "hard time" [...] on The Late Late Toy Show), Sinéad O'Connor (the [...] "crazy performing monkey" [...] incident), former MEP Paul Murphy (whose guest appearance contrasted glaringly with Miriam O'Callaghan's Prime Time interview of Enda Kenny the previous night) and Mia Farrow ("What's {{the matter with you}} anyway? Jesus!"). In May 2011, a former director of television at RTÉ, Helen O'Rahilly, said of The Late Late Show: “If <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>back</b> in charge of RTÉ, you wouldn't see this utter shite on Friday night”.|$|E
2500|$|In November 1981, Adam & the Ants {{released}} another {{highly successful}} album, Prince Charming. The album featured two United Kingdom No.1 singles – [...] "Stand and Deliver" [...] {{and the title}} track [...] "Prince Charming" [...] – {{as well as the}} No.3 UK hit [...] "Ant Rap". This trio of singles was promoted by some of the most lavish music videos of the period and paved the way for Adam Ant's later acting career. The work schedule Adam Ant imposed upon himself was punishing. [...] "I took no holidays – and I mean no holidays. When Kings of the Wild Frontier took off, I was halfway through making Prince Charming, and so on, because we had to bring out an album and four singles a year. But the price you pay... I split my cartilage in Cleveland doing [...] "Goody Two Shoes", it was my body saying, 'Look, no!' Then <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>back</b> onstage doing the Motown 25 [...] show 10 days later, having had the operation. Nobody could have stopped me, or make me do it. I did it. I was very, very bad at pacing," [...] he later remembered.|$|E

2500|$|... "Had it {{not been}} for the Tartars I would not be alive today. They were the nomads of the Crimea, in what was then no man's land between the Russian and German fronts, and favoured neither side. I had already struck up a good {{relationship}} with them, and often wandered off to sit with them. ‘Du nix njemcky’ they would say, ‘du Tartar,’ and try to persuade me to join their clan. Their nomadic ways attracted me of course, although by that time their movements had been restricted. Yet, it was they who discovered me in the snow after the crash, when the German search parties had given up. I was still unconscious then and only came round completely after twelve days or so, and by then <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>back</b> in a German field hospital. So the memories I have of that time are images that penetrated my consciousness. The last thing I remember was that it was too late to jump, too late for the parachutes to open. That must have been a couple of seconds before hitting the ground. Luckily I was not strapped in – I always preferred free movement to safety belts… My friend was strapped in and he was atomized on impact – there was almost nothing to be found of him afterwards. But I must have shot through the windscreen as it flew back at the same speed as the plane hit the ground and that saved me, though I had bad skull and jaw injuries. Then the tail flipped over and I was completely buried in the snow. That's how the Tartars found me days later. I remember voices saying ‘Voda’ (Water), then the felt of their tents, and the dense pungent smell of cheese, fat and milk. They covered my body in fat to help it regenerate warmth, and wrapped it in felt as an insulator to keep warmth in." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{idea behind}} [...] "Rhythm of Love" [...] is, {{according}} to Rabin, [...] "just sex". By {{the time of}} the recording, he felt Yes had pushed away from the cosmic-inspired lyrics that the group were known for in the 1970s with [...] "Owner of a Lonely Heart", and thought a sex lyric would be a [...] "nice little tease". Anderson claimed the group were strong for its chorus, but he felt unsure and needed the lyrics [...] "fashioned" [...] and changed some words. [...] "Big Generator" [...] is one of the album's three tracks credited to the whole group. It developed from a riff by Squire and Rabin, originating from a specific tuning Squire had on his 5-string bass which helped to create the song, which involved contributions from White on the drums. In its early development, White felt the song needed some [...] "Yes stamps" [...] incorporated into the arrangement, and instructed the group to play a section and not listen to his playing. [...] "I just stopped and started ... like the drummer fell off his stool and then got back on trying to catch up the beat. Playing very slowly and then faster ... and then <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>back</b> in time". Once he was, [...] "I reversed the beat around backwards so I came in with the bass drum on two and four instead of one and three". [...] "Shoot High Aim Low", the second group track, was one of the songs recorded in Carimate, and features reverb that was captured naturally around the castle's acoustics, rather than reverb added electronically in the studio. White came up with the chords while he was playing in the studio with the drum box. When Rabin arrived at the studio, he told White to continue playing the beat while he started singing a melody that was used in the song. It features Anderson as [...] "the guy in the helicopter going in at ninety miles an hour and I'm going to blow everybody up", yet has Rabin's backing vocals sing a love lyric that involves a couple enjoying their company in a car. He summarised the song's message as [...] "To live beyond war". Rabin later called the song his favourite on Big Generator. Rabin called [...] "Almost Like Love" [...] a track that did not quite work in the end and wished it was not included on the album. He disagreed {{with the addition of a}} horn section, comparing it to soul music and [...] "Sussudio" [...] by Phil Collins. Squire was particularly into the song's riff, yet Rabin felt the song around it was substandard, like [...] "polishing a vase while the building was falling down".|$|E
