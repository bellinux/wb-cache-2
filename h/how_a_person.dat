5|$|In {{keeping with}} their history, the Churches of Christ claim the New Testament as their sole rule {{of faith and}} {{practice}} in deciding matters of doctrine and ecclesiastical structure. They view the Old Testament as divinely inspired and historically accurate, {{but they do not}} consider its laws to be binding under the New Covenant in Christ (unless they are repeated in the New Testament) (Hebrews 8: 7-13). They believe that the New Testament demonstrates <b>how</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> may become a Christian (and thus a part of the universal Church of Christ) and how a church should be collectively organized and carry out its scriptural purposes.|$|E
5|$|It {{was founded}} in Athens by Zeno of Citium in the early 3rd century BC. The Stoics taught that {{emotions}} resulted in errors of judgment which were destructive, due to the active relationship between cosmic determinism and human freedom, {{and the belief that}} it is virtuous to maintain a will (called prohairesis) that is in accord with nature. Because of this, the Stoics presented their philosophy {{as a way of life}} (lex divina), and they thought that the best indication of an individual's philosophy was not what a person said but <b>how</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> behaved. To live a good life, one had to understand the rules of the natural order since they taught that everything was rooted in nature.|$|E

25|$|The {{ascendant}} {{is generally}} considered {{the most important and}} personalized angle in the horoscope by the vast majority of astrologers. It signifies a person's awakening consciousness, {{in the same way that}} the Sun's appearance on the eastern horizon signifies the dawn of a new day. Due to the fact that the ascendant is specific to a particular time and place, it signifies the individual environment and conditioning that a person receives during their upbringing, and also the circumstances of their childhood. For this reason, the ascendant is also concerned with <b>how</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> has learned to present him or herself to the world, especially in public and in impersonal situations.|$|E
25|$|Posttraumatic stress {{disorder}} (PTSD) is a mental disorder that can develop after {{a person is}} exposed to a traumatic event, such as sexual assault, warfare, traffic collisions, or other threats on a person's life. Symptoms may include disturbing thoughts, feelings, or dreams related to the events, mental or physical distress to trauma-related cues, attempts to avoid trauma-related cues, alterations in <b>how</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> thinks and feels, {{and an increase in}} the fight-or-flight response. These symptoms last {{for more than a month}} after the event. Young children are less likely to show distress but instead may express their memories through play. A person with PTSD is at a higher risk for suicide and intentional self-harm.|$|E

25|$|In I and Thou, Buber {{introduced}} his thesis on human existence. Inspired by Feuerbach's The Essence of Christianity and Kierkegaard's Single One, Buber worked upon {{the premise of}} existence as encounter. He explained this philosophy using the word pairs of Ich-Du and Ich-Es to categorize the modes of consciousness, interaction, and being through which an individual engages with other individuals, inanimate objects, and all reality in general. Theologically, he associated the first with the Jewish Jesus and the second with the apostle Paul (formerly Saul of Tarsus, a Jew). Philosophically, these word pairs express complex ideas about modes of being—particularly <b>how</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> exists and actualizes that existence. As Buber argues in I and Thou, a person is at all times engaged with the world {{in one of these}} modes.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the Analects, Confucius' {{students}} frequently {{request that}} Confucius define ren and give examples {{of people who}} embody it, but Confucius generally responds indirectly to his students' questions, instead offering illustrations and examples of behaviours {{that are associated with}} ren and explaining <b>how</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> could achieve it. According to Confucius, a person with a well-cultivated sense of ren would speak carefully and modestly (Analects 12.3); be resolute and firm (Analects 12.20), courageous (Analects 14.4), free from worry, unhappiness, and insecurity (Analects 9.28; 6.21); moderate their desires and return to propriety (Analects 12.1); be respectful, tolerant, diligent, trustworthy and kind (Analects 17.6); and love others (Analects 12.22). Confucius recognized his followers' disappointment that he would not give them a more comprehensive definition of ren, but assured them that he was sharing all that he could (Analects 7.23).|$|E
25|$|Song Ci (sometimes {{referred}} to as Sung Tzu) was a judicial intendant who lived in China 1188-1251 AD. In 1247 AD Song Ci wrote a book entitled Washing Away of Wrongs as a handbook for coroners. In this book Song Ci depicts several cases in which he took notes on <b>how</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> died and elaborates on probable causes. He explains in detail on how to examine a corpse {{both before and after}} burial. He also explains the process of how to determine a probable cause of death. The main purpose of this book was {{to be used as a}} guide for other investigators so they could assess the scene of the crime effectively. His level of detail in explaining what he observed in all his cases laid down the fundamentals for modern forensic entomologists and is the first recorded account in history of someone using forensic entomology for judicial means.|$|E
40|$|Often {{compared}} to Lena Dunham’s critically acclaimed HBO series Girls, Sheila Heti’s novel <b>How</b> Should <b>A</b> <b>Person</b> Be? explores the question the title poses. The main characters in both works, Sheila in <b>How</b> Should <b>A</b> <b>Person</b> Be? and Hannah in Girls, struggle with authentically {{developing their own}} identities while being influenced by popular culture and their relationships with men, leading to an unhealthy self-obsession. I will explore the ways that women’s heterosexual relationships in both the novel and the show are portrayed as negatively affecting this search for identity. Additionally, I argue that the same sex friendships the characters develop are what provide {{the opportunity for a}} sincere connection, which can lead to a possible solution to their problems with narcissism. Through examining these different types of relationships, I will discuss the ways that <b>How</b> Should <b>A</b> <b>Person</b> Be? and Girls can {{have a positive impact on}} the current feminist movement...|$|R

The TAM model defines main constructs [40]: (i) perceived utility, which measures <b>how</b> much <b>a</b> <b>person</b> believes that using a given technology increases his/her productivity and (ii) perceived ease of use, which measures <b>how</b> much <b>a</b> <b>person</b> believes that the usage of a given technology is easy.|$|R
