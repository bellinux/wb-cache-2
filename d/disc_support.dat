His Turner Entertainment Group had risen to success in part through its ownership of the pre-May 1986 MGM library. After {{a short period of}} negotiation with MGM, Time Warner was unsuccessful. The leading bidder proved to be Sony Corporation of America, backed by Comcast and private equity firms Texas Pacific Group (now TPG Capital, L.P.), DLJ and Providence Equity Partners. Sony's primary goal was to ensure Blu-ray <b>Disc</b> <b>support</b> at MGM; cost synergies with Sony Pictures Entertainment were secondary. Time Warner made a counter-bid (which Ted Turner reportedly tried to block), but on September 13, 2004, Sony increased its bid of US$11.25/share (roughly $4.7 billion) to $12/share ($5 billion), and Time Warner subsequently withdrew its bid of $11/share ($4.5 billion). MGM and Sony agreed on a purchase price of nearly $5 billion, of which about $2 billion was to pay off MGM debt.

The homogeneity of the films, and also their reversibility to humidity, increased when the molar ratio of Nafion to Crystal Violet was increased. The homogeneity was even further improved when these films were treated with a 5. 0 μL drop of methanol, leading to films of higher durability. The durability of films decreased with decrease in the film thickness.

40|$|Abstract – Spondylolithesis {{is defined}} as forward {{slipping}} of a vertebral body on distal vertebra, and this slipping causes a spectrum of symptoms from mild back pain to overt spinal stenosis. The various treatment modality for spondylolisthesis is introduced. In general, the slip of lesser than 50 per cent can be successfully treated with in situ fusion in children and early adolescent without neurologic deficit. Operative reduction of spondylolisthesis may be indicated in cauda equina syndrome, progressive slip surpassing 40 to 50 per cent, major deformity causing decompensation or distress, major pain or deficit plus two or more risk factor. Risk factors for in situ fusion include the following: slip angle greater than 25 degrees, trapezoidal L 5, rounded sacral end plate, hyperlordosis exceeding 50 degrees L 2 -S 1, L 5 radiculopathy requiring decompression, female adolescents, excess lumbosacral mobility, sign of sacral root stretch. Stabilization after decompression of high grade isthmic spondylolisthesis is difficult due to insufficiency of fusion base, gap between the bases and incompetent anterior <b>disc</b> <b>support.</b> So posterior lumbar interbody fusion(PLIF) offered anterior support, reduction of the deformity and a broad fusion base may be applied.

40|$|Study Design. Intervertebral disc {{degeneration}} {{was evaluated}} by morphologic appearance, magnetic resonance imaging, and by biochemical matrix composition. Caliber {{and distribution of}} openings of the adjacent vertebral osseous endplates were measured. Objectives. Correlation between occlusion of vertebral endplate openings and intervertebral disc degeneration was quantified. Summary of Background Data. Calcifications of vertebral endplates with disease and age have suggested insufficient nutrition as a mechanism for intervertebral disc degeneration. It has been proposed that occlusion of endplate openings, which contain vascular sources for the disc, may limit the transport of nutrients, leading to disc degeneration. Methods. Fresh magnetic resonance images from 39 human lumbar discs were scored. Sectioned discs with endplates were morphologically graded. Samples of nuclear and anular regions were evaluated for proteoglycan and collagen contents. Backlight microscopic images of 4 endplate regions were obtained, and caliber and distribution of endplate openings for each disc were measured. Analysis of variance regression models {{were used to assess}} correlation between endplate openings and disc degeneration. Results. The decrease in opening density significantly correlated to morphologic degeneration grade, best for openings with 20 to 50 ìm equivalent diameter and in the nuclear region. Although the density of 20 to 50 ìm openings also significantly indirectly correlated to age, it was not as strong as the correlation to degeneration grade. Opening density was also significantly correlated to proteoglycan content in all regions. However, all other biochemical parameters as well as the T 2 intensity score showed only weak or no correlation to opening density. Conclusions. A high indirect correlation between the density of openings in the osseous endplate (particularly {{of the size of the}} capillary buds) and the morphologicdegeneration grade of the <b>disc</b> <b>support</b> the hypothesis that occlusion of these openings may deprive the cells of nutrients, leading to insufficient maintenance of the extracellular matrix and disc degeneration...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY Fracture of {{the short}} strut of the latest series of Bjork-Shiley mitral valve {{prostheses}} occurred 12 months after implantation. The patient died despite emergency surgery to excise and replace the prosthesis. Bjork-Shiley 29 - 33 mm valves with a 600 opening angle manufactured between February 1981 and March 1982 have a predicted strut fracture rate of 0. 3 % (three times {{greater than that of}} valves produced outside these dates). Unimplanted valves from this batch have now been recalled by the manufacturers. One of the most dramatic and tragic events associated with prosthetic heart valve replacement is sudden mechanical failure due to blockage or detachment from the surrounding tissues. The resulting heart failure is almost always fatal unless urgent replace-ment of the heart valve is undertaken. Equally drama-tic, but less well recognised, is fracture or dislocation of the prosthetic valve disc. We report a fatal case of sudden mechanical failure of a current series Bjork-Shiley mitral valve prosthesis due to fracture of the minor <b>disc</b> <b>support</b> strut one year after the valve was inserted. Case report A 52 year old woman with rheumatic heart disease underwent replacement of the mitral valve with a Bjork-Shiley MBRC 29 mm prosthesis and of the aor-tic valve with an Omniscience 23 mm prosthesis in July 1982. She was well during the next 12 months and was taking warfarin, dipyridamole, and digoxin. In July 1983 she suddently became short of breath, which was associated with faintness and tightness in the chest. On physical examination she was agitated, restless, cyanosed, clammy, and severely dyspnoeic and was coughing up white frothy sputum. The pulse rate was irregular at 120 beats/min and the blood pres-sure unrecordable. Her jugular veins were distended up to the ear lobes.

40|$|Graduation date: 1984 An {{automated}} instrument {{based on}} a single-board microcomputer was developed for use in voltammetric analyses. Operator input of numerous experiment parameters allows any type of voltammetric analysis to be implemented and multiple scans to be run unattended. A three operational amplifier potentiostat is used to control the cell voltage and convert the cell current to a voltage signal. A 16 -bit digital-to-analog converter allows the computer to determine the cell voltage. A 12 -bit analog-to-digital converter converts the signal to digital form for the computer to manipulate, store and display. The potentiostat is isolated electrically from the computer {{through the use of}} opto-isolators. The computer is interfaced to solid state switches, 3 -way valves and pumps for control of electrode rotation, outgassing of 0 ₂. filling of the cell with a buffer solution, and evacuation of cell solution. Injection of spike solutions and rapid washing of the cell is also under computer control. Data manipulation handled by the microcomputer includes waveform generation, data acquisition, automatic background acquisition and subtraction, polynomial fitting of the baseline, and peak potential and peak current calculations. Instrument parameters were optimized in the differential pulse anodic stripping voltammetry mode with a rotating thin mercury film electrode on a glassy carbon <b>disc</b> <b>support.</b> With this system the heavy metals, Zn, Cd, Pb and Cu, were quantitated at 1 μg/L levels with five minute deposition periods and at 0. 1 μg / L levels with thirty minute deposition. Metal speciation studies were carried out to evaluate the automation abilities of the instrument and to observe and demonstrate important problems in metal speciation studies with ASV. Pseudopol arography was used to confirm that EDTA formed a quasi-labile complex with Cu. Humic acid was adsorbed by the mercury electrode and reduced the response to metals. The ASV determinable Zn, Cd, Pb and Cu concentrations in a river water sample were found to be 4. 0, 0. 32, 0. 15 and 0. 40 μg/L, respectively.
