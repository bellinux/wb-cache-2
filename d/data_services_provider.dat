40|$|The Data Service Provider Cost Estimation Tool (CET) and Comparables Database (CDB) package {{provides}} to NASA s Earth Science Enterprise (ESE) {{the ability}} to estimate {{the full range of}} year-by-year lifecycle cost estimates for the implementation and operation of data service providers required by ESE to support its science and applications programs. The CET can make estimates dealing with staffing costs, supplies, facility costs, network services, hardware and maintenance, commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software licenses, software development and sustaining engineering, and the changes in costs that result from changes in workload. Data Service Providers may be stand-alone or embedded in flight projects, field campaigns, research or applications projects, or other activities. The CET and CDB package employs a cost-estimation-by-analogy approach. It is based on a new, general data service provider reference model that provides a framework for construction of a database by describing existing data service providers that are analogs (or comparables) to planned, new ESE data service providers. The CET implements the staff effort and cost estimation algorithms that access the CDB and generates the lifecycle cost estimate for a new <b>data</b> <b>services</b> <b>provider.</b> This data creates a common basis for an ESE proposal evaluator for considering projected data service provider costs...|$|E

30|$|In {{traditional}} {{data integrity}} verification model, {{it is based}} on the agreement between the two sides of the <b>data</b> storage <b>service</b> to verify the integrity of the stored data. As either side of user or <b>data</b> <b>service</b> <b>provider</b> may provide biased verification results to cheat the other side, our verification model introduces the third party verifier like in [12] for the fairness of data verification. Thus, there are three participants in our data verification model, namely, user, <b>data</b> <b>service</b> <b>provider</b> (DSP), and third party verifier (TPV). Assume that the TPV can be fully trusted while the TPV is composed of a public verifier group rather than an individual to execute the verification, i.e., the number of group’s members exceeds a certain value. Therefore, we can consider that the verification result provided by the TPV is fair and credible. The details about the number of the public verifier group members are not discussed in this paper due to the limitation of space.|$|R

40|$|We are in {{the middle}} of an {{insurgency}} in cloud computing. In short, cloud computing is “a model for enabling convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or <b>services</b> <b>provider</b> interaction. ” Current cloud computing systems pose serious limitation to protecting users' data confidentiality. Since users' sensitive data is presented in unencrypted forms to remote machines owned and operated by third party <b>service</b> <b>providers,</b> the risks of unauthorized disclosure of the users' sensitive <b>data</b> by <b>service</b> <b>providers</b> may be high. Many techniques for protecting users' data from outside attackers are available, but currently there exists no effective way for protecting users' sensitive <b>data</b> from <b>service</b> <b>providers</b> in cloud computing. Our approach is protecting the confidentiality of users' <b>data</b> from <b>service</b> <b>providers,</b> and ensures that <b>service</b> <b>providers</b> cannot access or disclose users' confidential data being processed and stored in cloud computing systems. Our approach has three major aspects: 1) Separating software <b>service</b> <b>providers</b> and infrastructure <b>service</b> <b>providers</b> in cloud computing, 2) Hiding information of the owners of data, and 3) Data obfuscation. An example to show how our approach can protect the confidentiality of users' <b>data</b> from <b>service</b> <b>providers</b> in cloud computing is given and various types of attacks in cloud computing. <b>Service</b> <b>providers</b> neither can see user’s confidential data, nor can modify it.

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to present an integrated two-stage concept for level of service estimation at traffic signals in an urban road network based on innovative traffic <b>data</b> <b>services</b> and collection techniques. The paper starts with a brief summary of the background of performance measures and levels of service for traffic signals and of innovative data collection techniques (Automatic Number Plate Recognition, Bluetooth- and GPS-tracking) and traffic data providers. The first stage of the concept employs the data provided by most traffic <b>data</b> <b>service</b> <b>providers,</b> i. e. the average travel speed on all Traffic Message Channel locations or links of the network. Firstly, every speed is assigned to its associated level of service. Secondly, a digital map is augmented with this information which allows for a quick and demonstrative visual analysis. Traffic Message Channel locations or links with low level of service are selected for further investigations in the next stage. The second stage employs Automatic Number Plate Recognition and GPS-tracking for detailed LOS estimation. The former yields empiric average travel speeds, which are used to validate the average travel speeds obtained from the traffic <b>data</b> <b>service</b> <b>provider.</b> The latter yields approach delays, which, again, can be assigned to their associated level of service. The developed concept was applied successfully in a real-world case study on the urban road network of Hannover, Germany. It can be stated that all data sources lead to notably similar results, especially in the second stage, where both data sources (traffic <b>data</b> <b>service</b> <b>provider</b> and GPS-tracking) lead to identical level of service at six out of seven approaches...|$|R
