By two years post-injury, 80% of men recover at least partial erectile function, though many experience problems with the reliability and duration of their erections if they do not use interventions to enhance them. Studies have found that half or up to 65% of men with SCI have orgasms, although the experience may <b>feel</b> <b>different</b> than it did before the injury. Most men say it feels weaker, and takes longer and more stimulation to achieve.|$|E

25|$|The {{placebo effect}} {{is related to}} the {{perceptions}} and expectations of the patient; if the substance is viewed as helpful, it can heal, but, if it is viewed as harmful, it can cause negative effects, which is known as the nocebo effect. In 1985, Irving Kirsch hypothesized that placebo effects are produced by the self-fulfilling effects of response expectancies, in which the belief that one will <b>feel</b> <b>different</b> leads a person to actually <b>feel</b> <b>different.</b> According to this theory, the belief that one has received an active treatment can produce the subjective changes thought to be produced by the real treatment. Placebos can act similarly through classical conditioning, wherein a placebo and an actual stimulus are used simultaneously until the placebo is associated with the effect from the actual stimulus. Both conditioning and expectations play a role in placebo effect, and make different kinds of contribution. Conditioning has a longer-lasting effect, and can affect earlier stages of information processing. Those that think that a treatment will work display a stronger placebo effect than those that do not, as evidenced by a study of acupuncture.|$|E

Their first licensed title is The Legend of Korra (2014), based on Nickelodeon's animated series of the same name.

500|$|The later Saturn version also {{received}} generally positive reviews, though most critics {{agreed that it}} was not as good as the PlayStation version. In Sega Saturn Magazine, Rad Automatic praised the large number of tracks and the distinctive flavour of each one, and remarked that the gameplay is very easy to get into but provides more than enough challenge. He criticised it as not being as good as the PlayStation version, though he noted that none of the shortcomings impact the gameplay. The four reviewers from Electronic Gaming Monthly similarly praised the number and variety of tracks along with the strong challenge the game presented, and were much more approving of the graphics than Sega Saturn Magazine, describing them as [...] "vibrant" [...] and [...] "gorgeous". A Next Generation critic said that while the graphics are slightly less sharp and the controls <b>feel</b> <b>different,</b> the Saturn version is essentially the same game as the PlayStation version. Both Air Hendrix of GamePro and a reviewer for Maximum argued that the Saturn version is noticeably not as polished as the PlayStation version but still excellent in absolute terms, making it a pointless purchase for PlayStation owners but recommended for Saturn-only players.|$|E
500|$|Burcombe {{wanted to}} improve on the original's ship {{handling}} and introduce a new weapon, which led to new power-up ideas. Westcott {{said that it was}} a collaboration between the areas because of the strict deadline. The gameplay change that had most interest was what happened to ships that hit track edges. That ships stopped immediately in the original game was considered too harsh. It was desired that ships scraped the edges instead, and this took longer than expected to develop. Ghost vehicles were only featured in the European version because Atari had a patent on them from Hard Drivin' in the United States. The team wanted to make it possible to win races in any ship, and a challenge was to make them all <b>feel</b> <b>different</b> and to still have their worth. Months of work rebalancing the artificial intelligence was undertaken to ensure all vehicle and track settings were a challenge. Sony wanted a link-up feature, which proved difficult due to syncing issues and the frame rate differences between PAL and NTSC. Much extra content, such as harder tracks and a prototype ship, was added because, according to Westcott, the team were both enthusiastic and stressed, and described their development as [...] "a period of great energy and immense exhaustion at the same time".|$|E

40|$|An {{alligator}} named Johannes Jensen {{works as}} an executive officer at the Oslo tax office. He <b>feels</b> <b>different,</b> but doesn't know why. Maybe it is because he wears a bow tie while his colleagues wear ties? Johannes Jensen tries {{to go to work}} dressed with a tie, but he still <b>feels</b> <b>different.</b> In the verbal text he wonders about why he <b>feels</b> <b>different.</b> It is the Oscar-winning illustrator Torill Kove's humorous pictures which suggest an answer to the reader. The pictures show that the bow tie is not the main reason that makes Johannes Jensen stand out, but {{the fact that he is}} an alligator, while all the others are human beings. In this way the different modalities of the text are interdependent on one another for the creation of meaning. The interplay between picture and verbal text in the picture book, or what Hallberg (1982) calls the "ikonotekst," creates a tension between Johannes Jensen's experience of reality and reality seen through the eyes of the reader. Johannes Jensen føler seg annerledes [Johannes Jensen feels different] (2003) is a complementary picture book, where words and pictures fill in each other's gaps (Nikolajeva and Scott 2001, 12). An example that demonstrates this is seen when Johannes Jensen is having his breakfast. Even when Johannes Jensen sits alone, eating his breakfast, he <b>feels</b> <b>different,</b> the verbal [End Page 31] text tells us. Not strange, really, as we can see pictures of humans both on the cereal box and in the newspaper. Johannes Jensen føler seg annerledes focuses on the theme of being and feeling different and representing a minority, in this case an alligator in a society dominated by human beings. The problem at hand, Johannes Jensen's existential search for identity and interdependence, is common to all mankind. Both children and adults can easily identify with Johannes Jensen. The book is written just as much for adult readers as for child readers, marketed as all-ages-literature 1, and published in two different formats: a big edition for children and a mini edition for adult...|$|R

500|$|The social {{psychologist}} Daryl Bem {{wrote in}} Psychological Review that Bell et al. {{provide the most}} important data concerning [...] "experience-based theories" [...] {{of the development of}} sexual orientation, including [...] "the classical psychoanalytic account", as well as views that attribute the origins of sexual orientation to learning, conditioning, seduction, or labeling. According to Bem, their finding that [...] "no family variables" [...] are [...] "strongly implicated in the development of sexual orientation for either men or women" [...] is [...] "consistent with accumulating evidence that family variables account for much less of the environmental variance in personality than previously thought". Bem proposed a hypothesis that he refers to as [...] "Exotic becomes erotic": children <b>feel</b> <b>different</b> from either their same-sex peers or opposite-sex peers and therefore eroticize them, leading to homosexuality and heterosexuality respectively. Bem referred to Bell et al.′s finding that gay men and lesbians {{were significantly more likely to}} recall having felt different from same-sex children during the grade-school years, and to other studies that drew similar conclusions. Bem maintained that Bell′s view that people become erotically attracted to those who are different from them out of a [...] "quest for androgyny" [...] does not accurately characterize or explain the data, and rejected Bell et al.′s conclusion that sexual orientation is innate.|$|E
500|$|The writers {{felt this}} {{approach}} was similar to how Stan Lee reinvented Captain America in the 1960s and 1970s, with [...] "the Captain dealing {{with all sorts of}} the same things that the country [...] dealing with–Vietnam, Watergate and all that stuff–so he gets to have opinions on that", thus making the [...] "guy who is ostensibly from the more black and white 1940s react to this ultimately grey world that we live in." [...] Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige described the film as a political thriller, and as the duo struggled to figure out a third act, Feige suggested that S.H.I.E.L.D. be brought down and have Captain America fight the agency. The writers thought this was a great story point, for implementing [...] "the physical manifestation of Cap changing the world." [...] Markus even noted how the 1970s comics had similar conspiracies. The Hydra reveal made sure to include returning characters among the undercover villains, as well as references to the comics such as Arnim Zola being kept alive as a machine. Feige later elaborated on the political thriller nature of the film saying, In our attempt to make all of our films feel unique and <b>feel</b> <b>different</b> we found ourselves going back to things like [...] Also the other political thrillers of the '70s: The Parallax View, All the President's Men. This was a time that Cap existed in the comics. He found himself in the swinging '60s followed by the Watergate Era followed by the Reagan Era followed by where we are today. In the comics it {{was a hell of a}} journey for Steve. And we couldn't take him through those years because in our cinematic universe he was asleep. But we wanted to force him to confront that kind of moral conundrum, something with that '70s flavor. And in our film that takes the form of S.H.I.E.L.D.|$|E

In his 1973 work Separation: Anxiety and Anger, he revealed that he regarded it as a terrible time for him. He later said, [...] "I wouldn't send a dog away to boarding school at age seven". However, earlier Bowlby had considered boarding schools appropriate for children aged eight and older. In 1951, he wrote: If the child is maladjusted, it may be useful for him to be away for part of the year from the tensions which produced his difficulties, and if the home is bad in other ways the same is true. The boarding school has the advantage of preserving the child's all-important home ties, even if in slightly attenuated form, and, since it forms part of the ordinary social pattern of most Western communities today , the child who goes to boarding-school will not <b>feel</b> <b>different</b> from other children.
