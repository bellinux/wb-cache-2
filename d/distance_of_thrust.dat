50|$|When one engine becomes inoperative, a {{yawing moment}} develops, the {{magnitude}} of which {{is equal to the}} lateral <b>distance</b> <b>of</b> the <b>thrust</b> vector <b>of</b> the operative engine to the center of gravity (C.G.), also called moment arm, multiplied by the <b>thrust</b> <b>of</b> the engine. In addition, a rolling moment might develop due to asymmetrical propulsive lift generated by the wing section behind the operative propeller. These moments yaw and/ or roll the aircraft towards the inoperative engine, a tendency which must be counteracted by the pilot's use of the flight controls: rudder and ailerons. Due to P-factor, a clockwise rotating right-hand propeller on the right wing typically develops its resultant thrust vector at a greater lateral distance from the aircraft's C.G. than the clockwise rotating left-hand propeller (Figure 1). The failure of the left-hand engine will result in a larger remaining yawing moment by the operating right-hand engine, rather than vice versa. Since the operating right-hand engine produces a larger yawing moment, the pilot will need to use larger control deflections in order to maintain aircraft control, or a higher speed. Thus, the failure of the left-hand engine is less desirable than failure of the right-hand engine, and the left-hand engine is called critical.|$|R
40|$|Swimming {{speed is}} {{determined}} by many factors, including weight preparation of the swimmer {{which is one of}} the most important ones. This power is directly related to the speed a swimmer can reach in water, that is the value <b>of</b> <b>thrust.</b> The aim <b>of</b> the study was to establish the level <b>of</b> <b>thrust</b> and swimming speed of the 2 nd year students (n= 20) of the University School of Physical Education (USPE) in Poznań and to compare them with the results of study from 1983 in which the 4 th year students (n= 20) of the USPE in Poznań were studied. The current study was carried out in the context of the long-term changes in swimming technique. Research methods: measurement <b>of</b> <b>thrust</b> in real conditions was performed using a prototype device for the measurement <b>of</b> <b>thrust</b> <b>of</b> a swimmer which makes it possible to register the force in the water environment; swimming speed was established on the basis of the time needed to cover the <b>distance</b> <b>of</b> 25 metres, according to the regulations of the Polish Swimming Association. Conclusions: the students taking part in the 1983 study had higher values <b>of</b> <b>thrust,</b> but a lower speed than the students taking part in the 2006 study, which suggests that apart from the <b>thrust</b> the technique <b>of</b> swimming has a important influence of the swimming speed...|$|R

40|$|The {{variations}} of the supporting condition, which change the stiffness <b>of</b> tilting pad <b>thrust</b> bearing, may alter the dynamic behavior of the rotor system. The effects of supporting condition <b>of</b> <b>thrust</b> pad on the lateral vibration of a hydroelectric generating set are investigated in this paper. The action <b>of</b> a <b>thrust</b> bearing is described as moments acting on the thrust collar, and the tilting stiffness coefficients <b>of</b> <b>thrust</b> bearing are calculated. A model based on typical beam finite element method is established to calculate the dynamic response, {{and the effects of}} supporting conditions such as elastic oil tank support, different heights <b>of</b> the <b>thrust</b> pads with rigid support are discussed. The results reveal that the influence <b>of</b> <b>thrust</b> bearing is small when the elastic oil tanks work normally. When the supporting conditions turn to be rigid due to the oil leakage, the differences <b>of</b> <b>thrust</b> pad heights have evident influence on the load distribution <b>of</b> the <b>thrust</b> pads; while the effects on the tilting stiffness <b>of</b> the <b>thrust</b> bearing and the amplitude of the lateral shaft vibration is small when the maximum load on thrust pads is smaller than the allowable value...|$|R

40|$|The effect <b>of</b> <b>thrust</b> on the {{flutter of}} a high-aspect-ratio wing is investigated. The wing is {{represented}} by a beam using a nonlinear mixed finite element method. Aerodynamic forces are calculated using a finite-state, two-dimensional unsteady aerodynamic model. The effect <b>of</b> <b>thrust</b> is modeled as a follower force of prescribed magnitude. Without the thrust force, the wing is shown to become unstable for freestream airspeeds greater than the flutter speed. On the other hand, {{in the absence of}} aerodynamic forces, the wing becomes unstable for values <b>of</b> the <b>thrust</b> in excess <b>of</b> a critical magnitude of the force. When both effects are present, the airspeed at which the instability occurs depends on the thrust magnitude. For validation, an analytical solution for the en vacuo case (accounting only for the effect <b>of</b> <b>thrust)</b> was developed and shown to closely match results from the numerical method. Parametric studies show that the predicted stability boundaries are very sensitive to the ratio of bending stiffness to torsional stiffness. Indeed, the effect <b>of</b> <b>thrust</b> can be either stabilizing or destabilizing, depending on the value of this parameter. An assessment whether or not the magnitude <b>of</b> <b>thrust</b> needed to influence the flutter speed is practical is made for one configuration...|$|R
