25|$|Deciduous {{trees are}} dominant, with the beech, linden, <b>European</b> <b>ash,</b> and {{sycamore}} maple being most widespread. The Little Carpathians PLA {{is the only}} place in Slovakia where some plants grow, for example, Ruscus hypoglossum and Rhamnus saxatilis. Insects include 700 species of butterflies and 20 species of ants. Notable species of birds are represented by the rock thrush, northern wheatear, black stork, European honey buzzard, short-toed eagle, Eurasian eagle-owl, long-eared owl, and European nightjar. The Landscape Area is home to the largest population of the saker falcon in Slovakia.|$|E
25|$|The {{vegetation}} is deciduous oak forest: both sessile oaks (Quercus petraea) and pedunculate oaks (Quercus robur), with <b>European</b> <b>ash</b> (Fraxinus excelsior) and hazels in {{the coolest}} and deepest soil {{at the bottom}} of the valley. The mountain layer is characterised by the presence of beeches and at times, in the Pyrenees, by silver firs (Abies alba); these beeches and silver firs occupy the cool slopes with shallow soil. The Mediterranean influence is felt in the presence of Holm oaks (Quercus ilex) with bay laurel, which are situated on the warmest crests and slopes, especially above chalky soil, where the dryness becomes more pronounced.|$|E

500|$|Except {{for a few}} {{possible}} glyphs cut {{in stone}} (see petroglyphs), all surviving texts are inscribed in wood. According to tradition, the tablets were made of toromiro wood. However, Orliac (2005) examined seven objects (tablets B, C, G, H, K, Q, and reimiro L) with stereo optical and scanning electron microscopes and determined that all were instead made from Pacific rosewood (Thespesia populnea); the same identification had been made for tablet M in 1934. This 15-meter tree, known as [...] "Pacific rosewood" [...] for its color and called makoâ€˜i in Rapanui, is used for sacred groves and carvings throughout eastern Polynesia and was evidently brought to Easter Island by the first settlers. However, not all the wood was native: Orliac (2007) established that tablets N, P, and S were made of South African Yellowwood (Podocarpus latifolius) and therefore that the wood had arrived with Western contact. Fischer describes P as [...] "a damaged and reshapen European or American oar", as are A (which is <b>European</b> <b>ash,</b> Fraxinus excelsior) and V; notes that wood from the wreck of a Western boat {{was said to have}} been used for many tablets; and that both P and S had been recycled as planking for a Rapanui driftwood canoe, suggesting that by that time the tablets had little value to the islanders as texts. Several texts, including O, are carved on gnarled driftwood. The fact that the islanders were reduced to inscribing driftwood, and were regardless extremely economical in their use of wood, may have had consequences for the structure of the script, such as the abundance of ligatures and potentially a telegraphic style of writing that would complicate textual analysis.|$|E

40|$|Ringspot {{symptoms}} in <b>European</b> mountain <b>ash</b> (Sorbus aucuparia L.), fig mosaic, rose rosette, raspberry leaf blotch, pigeonpea sterility mosaic (Cajanus cajan) and High Plains disease of maize and wheat {{were found to}} be associated with viruses that share several characteristics. They all have single-stranded multipartite RNA genomes of negative orientation. In some cases, double membrane-bound virus-like particles of 80 to 200 nm in diameter were found in infected tissue. Furthermore, at least five of these viruses were shown to be vectored by eriophyid mites. Sequences of <b>European</b> mountain <b>ash</b> ringspot-associated virus (EMARaV), Fig mosaic virus (FMV), rose rosette virus (RRV), raspberry leaf blotch virus (RLBV), pigeonpea sterility mosaic virus and High Plains virus strongly support their potential phylogenetic relationship. Therefore, after characterization of EMARaV, the novel genus Emaravirus was established, and FMV was the second virus species assigned to this genus. The recently sequenced RRV and RLBV are supposed to be additional members of this new group of plant RNA viruses...|$|R

50|$|So far {{the fungus}} has mainly {{affected}} the <b>European</b> <b>ash</b> (Fraxinus excelsior) and its cultivars, {{but it is}} also known to attack the Narrow-leafed ash (Fraxinus angustifolia). The Manna ash (Fraxinus ornus) is also a known host, although it is less susceptible than the other <b>European</b> <b>ash</b> species. Experiments in Estonia have shown that several North American ash species are susceptible, especially the Black ash (Fraxinus nigra), {{and to a lesser extent}} the Green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica). The White ash (Fraxinus americana) and the Asian species known as Manchurian ash (Fraxinus mandschurica) showed only minor symptoms in the study.|$|E
5000|$|The conifer zone is {{dominated}} by the Norway spruce, silver fir, and European black pine with the admixture of the European beech.

50|$|FMV {{has been}} placed in the genus Emaravirus, which is fairly {{recently}} formed and contains other single-stranded, negative-sense, segmented RNA plant viruses. Emaraviruses all contain four to six genome segments. They are also common in their mode of transmission, which is via various species of eriophyid mites by unknown mechanism as well as mechanical modes of transmission. Besides FMV, the genus Emaravirus also includes <b>European</b> mountain <b>ash</b> ringspot-associated virus (EMARaV), rose rosette virus (RRV) and raspberry leaf blotch virus (RLBV).|$|R

40|$|The work {{deals with}} the issue of {{regenerating}} clearings due to salvage felling at mountain altitudes. Development was monitored on research plots Sokol in the HrubÃ½ JesenÃ­k Mts. (15 plots) and Jizerka in the JizerskÃ© Mts. (15 plots). The aim was to assess the developing young plantations of Norway spruce, European beech, European larch and Carpathian pubescent birch in particular, as well as of sycamore maple, <b>European</b> mountain <b>ash</b> and Silesian willow aged 9 [...] 14 years after planting. The assessment was focused primarily on the mensurational variables of the tree species (height, root collar diameter, crown diameter, and their increments). Part of the work was to evaluate the condition of soil environment, nutrition, root system architecture and health of Norway spruce. The best growth was shown by European larch. By contrast, the use of sycamore maple, <b>European</b> mountain <b>ash</b> and Silesian willow did not prove well. The mixing of Norway spruce and European beech was demonstrated to have a significantly favourable influence on the growth of the two species. The root system was confined to humus horizons only and all individuals exhibited deformation into a tangle. Analyses of soil conditions revealed that the effect of liming had persisted even after 20 years and the nutritional condition of the trees pointed to the luxurious supply namely of calcium and magnesium...|$|R
30|$|In some cases, {{just the}} genus can be determined, not the species itself (Acer spp., Quercus spp., Tilia spp., Populus spp., Salix spp., and Ulmus spp.). In two cases {{not even the}} {{differentiation}} of the genera is completely sure, this is for pear (Pyrus communis) and apple (Malus domestica) [8]. To handle these problems, the different species of one genus were not separately analyzed and the genera Pyrus and Malus were grouped together. For the genus Sorbus spp. the differentiation of the wood species (<b>European</b> mountain <b>ash</b> (Sorbus aucuparia), Wild service tree (Sorbus torminalis), Common whitebeam (Sorbus aria) and True service tree (Sorbus domestica) is difficult, but it was tried to distinguish the species using the description of Greguss [7].|$|R

Today {{it seems as}} if their fruits are more popular and more utilized than their wood. They were in some application used like apple and pear according to their properties such as resistance against abrasion, good in food contact (anti-bacterial), good sliding friction and high strength and hardness. They were used for planes, for spindles or beams of presses or for wood in water contact such as printing plates or wash boards. Furthermore the wood was appreciated in food contact such as outlets of vessels or bakers cutlery and in textile industry for weavers shuttle or looms. In literature it is also highly appreciated, even in modern publications [27]. The literature mentions in addition musical instruments [28], measuring instruments [29] and rolls of machines [14].|$|R
