The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit in the United States of 5mg/m3 (time-weighted average). In 1989, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) set a legal permissible exposure limit for aspirin of 5mg/m3, but this was vacated by the AFL-CIO v. OSHA decision in 1993.|$|E

25|$|Little-used {{floppy disk}} drives sitting unused {{for years in}} {{computers}} can actually damage disks, due to computer case air cooling that sucks air through the drive openings. This pulls dust into the mechanism, which coats all surfaces including the exposed read/write head. Upon loading a disk on the rare occasion the drive is needed, the dust is stirred up when the disk is inserted into the mechanism, and the dust on the head is ground into the medium while the stirred-up dust is deposited onto the disk through the open shutters, leading to nearly instant fouling of the media. The dust also <b>gets</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> drive mechanism lubricant, {{turning it into a}} sticky slime, which may jam the mechanism and prevent head movement. This causes the computer user to see read errors on every disk they try to use, and it may also lead to data corruption through writing in incorrect locations. Some users incorrectly assume that this means all their disks have gone bad, when it is in fact the drive that is the problem. The solution is for a technician to clean the drive before it is used after a long idle period.|$|E

500|$|Thom Jurek from AllMusic {{described}} [...] "Sing" [...] as a [...] "huge feminist anthem" [...] {{and described}} it as consisting of a [...] "killer hook, a big bad soul/gospel refrain, and a beat that, once it <b>gets</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> spine, will not be easily dismissed". Boston Globes Sarah Rodman compared it to the Eurythmics' 1985 single [...] "Sisters Are Doin' It for Themselves" [...] adding that it carried Lennox's characteristic messages of [...] "optimism and empowerment". Liz Hoggard of The Guardian called the song a [...] "showstopper" [...] and the collaboration as [...] "incandescent". Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine also noted the anthemic nature of the track and its [...] "smartly plays more like a broad-spectrum sisters-are-doin’-it-for-themselves" [...] nature, while believing {{that it would have}} been better suited as the album's title song than Songs of Mass Destruction. Similar thoughts were echoed by Chris Jones of BBC News who felt that [...] "Sing" [...] was able to [...] "overcome its weighty agenda to take life as a great song in its own right".|$|E
500|$|Duncan and Meg (Alona Tal) {{approach}} Veronica, and {{she tells}} Meg the general overview of a case where someone has been evading capture and all the tactics {{they used to do}} so before Duncan suddenly leaves.

Ben <b>gets</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> car and orders her to drive to the Camelot motel. There, Logan appears and beats him up before it is revealed that the [...] "suspect" [...] is actually an ATF agent. Ben says that he is investigating Norris, but needs her help: Norris has a crush on Veronica, and Ben asks her to get close to him. As she leaves the motel, Veronica and Logan kiss unexpectedly.|$|E
500|$|The episode's {{final moments}} linger on Dean [...] "meat-hooked {{in the center}} of what looks like a {{thousand}} mile spiderweb of rusty chains", a scene Kripke described as [...] "M. C. Escher meets Hellraiser". The original vision for the final scene would have placed Dean in a [...] "really nasty, bloody slaughterhouse, hanging from meat hooks". Here, Dean would start screaming as shadows fall over him. Discussions between Kripke, Manners, and Hayden led to the decision to present [...] "one epic glimpse" [...] of Hell, though they avoided aspects such as fire and brimstone to focus on more affordable visuals. Much debate went into the appearance of Hell because of its many variations. Though the scene matched with the many versions of [...] "chains and people being ripped apart", art director John Marcynuk felt they should have made it [...] "a little more mysterious and dark". He commented, [...] "My opinion is, the vaguer the better, because you let the imagination take over. People have different fears, and Hell's such a personal torment." [...] In series writer Sera Gamble's opinion, Dean's location is more of the [...] "waiting room"—the place [...] "they stick you before they hand you the sign-in sheet"—a far cry from what he will experience [...] "once he <b>gets</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> first chamber of Hell".|$|E
