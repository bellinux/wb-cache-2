To defeat them, Crash has to jack a smaller Titan to fight them. On defeating the larger Titan, he can dismount the Titan he previously jacked and directly jack the larger Titan. The dismounted Titan will then be destroyed.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} species of shrimp and fish take refuge among the {{branches}} of Millepora alcicornis, seemingly <b>immune</b> <b>to</b> the venom. Hawkfish in particular often perch {{on top of the}} fire coral, perhaps protected by their skinless pectoral fins. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Millepora alcicornis has few predators. The fireworm (Hermodice carunculata) sometimes grazes on it, but prefers other corals. Certain nudibranchs in the genus Phyllidia eat it as do filefish in the family Monacanthidae.|$|E
5|$|A popular myth is that {{sharks are}} <b>immune</b> <b>to</b> disease and cancer, {{but this is}} not scientifically supported. Sharks have been known to get cancer. Both {{diseases}} and parasites affect sharks. The evidence that sharks are at least resistant to cancer and disease is mostly anecdotal and there have been few, if any, scientific or statistical studies that show sharks to have heightened immunity to disease.|$|E

5|$|At these speeds, it was {{expected}} that the B-70 would be almost <b>immune</b> <b>to</b> interceptor aircraft, the only effective weapon against bomber aircraft at the time. The bomber would spend only a few minutes over a particular radar station, flying out of its range before the controllers could position their fighters in a suitable location for an interception. High speed also made the aircraft difficult to see on radar displays and its high-altitude flight could not be matched by any contemporary Soviet fighter.|$|E
5|$|BackupHDDVD {{represented}} {{the first known}} successful attack against AACS. The utility circumvents content protection by decrypting video files directly with AES, the underling cryptographic cipher used by AACS. Using this technique, BackupHDDVD is able to completely bypass the AACS chain of trust, rendering it <b>immune</b> <b>to</b> revocation. The cost of this immunity is that users are forced to rely on keys leaking from commercial player software to use BackupHDDVD with new discs.|$|E

40|$|A {{mouse model}} of Vibrio cholerae {{infection}} was successfully developed with germfree mice.

Stool culture, measurement of serum vibriocidal antibody titers, and determination of <b>immune</b> responses <b>to</b> the cholera toxin B subunit demonstrated that germfree mice are readily colonized by V cholerae and develop systemic and mucosal <b>immune</b> responses <b>to</b> antigens expressed by these organisms. <b>Immune</b> responses <b>to</b> the B subunit of Shiga toxin 1, which was expressed from a V. cholerae vaccine vector, were less pronounced.

40|$|Stress or {{heat shock}} {{proteins}} are constitutively expressed in normal CNS tissues {{in a variety}} of cell types (oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and neurons). Their presence may protect cells from various stresses, such as hypoxia, anoxia, and excessive excitatory stimulation. Increased amounts of hsp are expressed in various cells of the CNS during acute toxic-metabolic states and in chronic degenerative and inflammatory diseases. Increased expression of hsp may lead <b>to</b> <b>immune</b> responses <b>to</b> these proteins. Antibodies to mycobacterial hsp bind to normal human myelin and to oligodendrocytes in regions of MS demyelination. Cellular <b>immune</b> responses <b>to</b> hsp occur with increased frequency and magnitude in persons with MS, especially those with recent onset of disease. In addition, there are populations of T cells expressing gamma/delta T cells in the brains and spinal fluids of persons with MS, suggesting an in situ <b>immune</b> response <b>to</b> hsps. Humoral <b>immune</b> responses <b>to</b> hsp are found in CSF, but no disease specificity has been documented. Some myelin proteins have sequence homology with particular hsps. One instance is the homology between a peptide of mycobacterial Hsp 65 and the myelin protein CNP. Our data on EAE suggest that <b>immune</b> responses <b>to</b> either cross-reactive hsp epitopes or whole hsp can modify the course of both acute and chronic relapsing EAE. In addition, the severity and frequency of environmental exposure to infectious agents can modify the course of EAE, possibly by altering the patterns of <b>immune</b> response <b>to</b> hsp. Finally, tolerance to the small hsp, alpha B-crystallin, a putative autoantigen in persons with MS, alters the course of relapsing EAE, supporting its role in chronic, autoimmune CNS disease. Modifying <b>immune</b> responses <b>to</b> hsp may be a potential new treatment option for persons with MS...|$|R

Drilling accounts for over half the costs, and exploration of deep resources entails significant risks.

However, he discovers Jerktonium, a dangerous chemical element {{which serves as a}} trap for the citizens of Bikini Bottom and is capable of turning anyone into a jerk. He cooks it into fruitcakes that he intends to feed to all the Bikini Bottomites and turn them into jerks. In order to test it, Plankton gives SpongeBob a slice, but nothing seems to work on SpongeBob, who is <b>immune</b> <b>to</b> Jerktonium because of the combination of his small brain and his very big heart. Increasingly infuriated that his plan has seemingly failed completely to suffice, Plankton gives his fruitcake dispenser to SpongeBob, who promptly distributes the fruitcakes to all of Bikini Bottom and transforms all the residents into jerks. After realizing that the element works only on other people in Bikini Bottom instead and that SpongeBob is so full of Christmas spirit that he is <b>immune</b> <b>to</b> jerktonium, Plankton is forced to send out an evil wind-up robot version of SpongeBob to commit troublesome deeds to frame the real SpongeBob.|$|E

5|$|Not many predators {{challenge}} {{an adult}} black mamba {{although it does}} face a few threats such as birds of prey, particularly snake eagles. Although all species of snake eagle commonly prey on snakes, there are two species in particular that do so with high frequency, including preying on black mambas. These are the black-chested snake eagle (Circaetus pectoralis) and the brown snake eagle (Circaetus cinereus). The Cape file snake (Mehelya capensis), which is apparently <b>immune</b> <b>to</b> all African snake venoms and preys on other snakes including venomous ones, is a common predator of black mambas (limited only by the size it can swallow). Mongooses, which also are partially <b>immune</b> <b>to</b> venom, and are often quick enough to evade a bite, will sometimes tackle a black mamba for prey.

5|$|The games {{introduce}} Raikou, Entei, and Suicune, {{some new}} types of legendary PokÃ©mon that wander around Johto, changing locations frequently. They can be tracked by the PokÃ©dex once encountered, and will always attempt to flee, but will retain HP loss. In addition {{there is the possibility}} of encountering a shiny PokÃ©mon, which have a different coloration than normal PokÃ©mon of their species, and appear very rarely. Two new PokÃ©mon types were added, the Steel-type and the Dark-type. Steel-type PokÃ©mon are <b>immune</b> <b>to</b> Poison-type moves, and they have very high defense and resistance to other types, while Dark-type PokÃ©mon are <b>immune</b> <b>to</b> Psychic-type moves and are strong against Psychic-type PokÃ©mon, as well as having few weaknesses. In Gold and Silver, new moves were added, but PokÃ©mon knowing these moves are not allowed to be traded to the first generation games. To solve this, a move deleter was introduced, capable of erasing moves known by the PokÃ©mon. Another major change was the splitting of the Special stat into Special Attack and Special Defense, which increased aspects of strategy.|$|E
