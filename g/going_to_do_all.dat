500|$|Despite the {{resistance}} to the character, Bungie staff defended the character's introduction. [...] "I'd much rather experiment and do something surprising, and not have everybody appreciate it, than just turn the crank and do another alien war movie with a space marine," [...] said Halo 2 design lead Jaime Griesemer. Community lead Brian Jarrard attributed some of the fan backlash to a discord between the game's marketing and the actual gameplay. [...] "I think, {{even more so than}} playing as the Arbiter, the thing that people were disappointed with and angry about is that they were promised this experience, through the marketing, of being really backs against the wall, Earth's under siege, we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>all</b> we can to save our home planet... In reality, the game only had two missions that actually did that." [...] Referring to Halo 2s cliffhanger ending, Griesemer said, [...] "I think if we'd been able to finish that last couple of missions and get you properly back on Earth, a lot of the reaction would have been placated." ...|$|E

60|$|She, as teacher, {{must bring}} them all as scholars, into subjection. And this she was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> <b>All</b> else she would forsake. She had become hard and impersonal, almost avengeful on herself {{as well as}} on them, since the stone throwing. She {{did not want to be}} a person, to be herself any more, after such humiliation. She would assert herself for mastery, be only teacher. She was set now. She was going to fight and subdue.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nonsense! I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>all</b> I can for them. What do {{you think}} we can do? They haven't the first idea how to amuse {{themselves}} here. It's a miracle they ever got that dress the girl is wearing. They just made a bold dash because they saw it in a dressmaker's window the first day, and she had to have something. It's killingly becoming to her; but I don't believe they know it, and they don't begin to know how cheap it was: it was simply THROWN away. I'm going shopping with them in the morning." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That afternoon, when I saw the {{well-known}} chef Isadore--for some years head cook to the Duke of Oxminster, {{and willing to}} accept a {{second place in the}} culinary department of my town house only on account of extraordinary privileges and emoluments--when I saw this man of genius coming down the hill carrying a heavy basket which probably contained meats packed in ice, I began to wonder about two things: in the first place, I wondered what exceptional remuneration in addition to his regular salary Baxter had offered Monsieur Isadore in return for his exceptional services in our cot; and in the second place, I wondered if it were exactly fair to practise such a variety of deceptions upon Anita. But I quieted my conscience by assuring it that I was doing everything for her benefit and happiness, particularly in regard to this man of all work, who was probably saving us from chronic dyspepsia. Besides, it was perfectly fair play, for if she had told me she was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>all</b> my cooking I never would have come to this cot.|$|E

60|$|Some {{critical}} spirit {{within him}} asked him urgently {{why he was}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> the station, what {{he thought he was}} doing, what he thought he had done, and what he thought he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> <b>To</b> <b>all</b> of which questions Mr. Brumley perceived he had no adequate reply.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear Blyth,--I {{have given}} in--at {{least for the}} present. I told my father about my wanting to be an artist, and about your saying that I had a good notion of drawing, and an eye for a likeness; but I {{might just as well}} have talked to one of your easels. He means to make a man of {{business}} of me. And here I have been, for the last three weeks, at a Tea Broker's office in the city, in consequence. They all say it's a good opening for me, and talk about the respectability of commercial pursuits. I don't want to be respectable, and I hate commercial pursuits. What is the good of forcing me into a merchant's office, when I can't say my Multiplication table? Ask my mother about that: she'll tell you! Only fancy me going round tea warehouses in filthy Jewish places like St. Mary-Axe, to take samples, with a blue bag to carry them about in; and a dirty junior clerk, who cleans his pen in his hair, to teach me how to fold up parcels! Isn't it enough to make my blood boil to think of it? I can't go on, and I won't go on in this way! Mind you're at home to-morrow; I'm coming to speak to you about how I'm to begin learning to be an artist. The junior clerk is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>all</b> my sampling work for me in the morning; and we are to meet in the afternoon, after I have come away from you, at a chop-house; and then go back to the office as if we had been together all day, just as usual. Ever yours, Z. THORPE, JUN.--P. S. My mind's made up: if the worst comes to the worst, I shall leave home." ...|$|E

50|$|Another {{thing that}} is often being criticized is the afk system, which allows players to fight animals and gain {{experience}} points without actually playing the game.

60|$|Many a town {{south and}} west of San Antonio owed its peace and {{prosperity}} to Rangers, and only to them. They had killed or driven out the criminals.

They're brothers and they argued like hell, sometimes to the point where you thought they were going to hit each other. But I guess it was brotherly love laughs. But when Phil said he was going to leave, we were all like stumped, 'Oh! What are we <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do?</b> <b>All</b> right we'll buy a Moog synthesizer!' That's kind of trite; I don't mean it quite like that. We had to do something." ...|$|E
5000|$|During {{the violent}} {{days of the}} Civil Rights Movement, Reverend Rice armed himself and kept guard over the house while Condoleezza practiced the piano inside. According to J. L.

[...] Also, Reverend Rice instilled in his daughter and students that black people would have to prove themselves worthy of advancement, and would simply have to be [...] "twice as good" [...] to overcome injustices built into the system. Rice said [...] "My parents were very strategic, I {{was going to be}} so well prepared, and I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>all</b> of these things that were revered in white society so well, that I would be armored somehow from racism.
