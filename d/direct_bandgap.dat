2500|$|The main use of {{metallic}} arsenic is in alloying with lead. Lead {{components in}} car batteries are {{strengthened by the}} presence of {{a very small percentage of}} arsenic.

[...] "Phosphorus Deoxidized Arsenical Copper" [...] with an arsenic content of 0.3% has an increased corrosion stability in certain environments. Gallium arsenide is an important semiconductor material, used in integrated circuits. Circuits made from GaAs are much faster (but also much more expensive) than those made from silicon. Unlike silicon, GaAs has a <b>direct</b> <b>bandgap,</b> and can be used in laser diodes and LEDs to convert electrical energy directly into light.|$|E
50|$|Traditional (crystalline) silicon {{preparation}} methods do not {{lend themselves to}} this approach {{due to lack of}} bandgap tunability. Thin-films of amorphous silicon, which due to a relaxed requirement in crystal momentum preservation can achieve <b>direct</b> <b>bandgaps</b> and intermixing of carbon, can tune the bandgap, but other issues have prevented these from matching the performance of traditional cells. Most tandem-cell structures are based on higher performance semiconductors, notably indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs).

50|$|CNT {{may be used}} as a {{photovoltaic}} device {{not only}} as an add-in material to increase carrier transport, but also as the photoactive layer itself. The semiconducting single walled CNT (SWCNT) is a potentially attractive material for photovoltaic applications for the unique structural and electrical properties. SWCNT has high electric conductivity (100 times that of copper) and shows ballistic carrier transport, greatly decreasing carrier recombination. The bandgap of the SWCNT is inversely proportional to the tube diameter, which means that SWCNT may show multiple <b>direct</b> <b>bandgaps</b> matching the solar spectrum.|$|R
50|$|Single wall carbon {{nanotubes}} {{possess a}} wide range of <b>direct</b> <b>bandgaps</b> matching the solar spectrum, strong photoabsorption, from infrared to ultraviolet, and high carrier mobility and reduced carrier transport scattering, which make themselves ideal photovoltaic material. Photovoltaic effect can be achieved in ideal single wall carbon nanotube (SWNT) diodes. Individual SWNTs can form ideal p-n junction diodes. An ideal behavior is the theoretical limit of performance for any diode, a highly sought after goal in all electronic materials development. Under illumination, SWNT diodes show significant power conversion efficiencies owing to enhanced properties of an ideal diode.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the absence}} of stimulated {{emission}} (e.g., lasing) conditions, electrons and holes may coexist in proximity to one another, without recombining, for a certain time, termed the [...] "upper-state lifetime" [...] or [...] "recombination time" [...] (about a nanosecond for typical diode laser materials), before they recombine. A nearby photon with energy equal to the recombination energy can cause recombination by stimulated emission. This generates another photon of the same frequency, polarization, and phase, travelling {{in the same direction}} as the first photon. This means that stimulated emission will cause gain in an optical wave (of the correct wavelength) in the injection region, and the gain increases as the number of electrons and holes injected across the junction increases. The spontaneous and stimulated emission processes are vastly more efficient in <b>direct</b> <b>bandgap</b> semiconductors than in indirect bandgap semiconductors; therefore silicon is not a common material for laser diodes.|$|E
