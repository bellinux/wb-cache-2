Directly after the dam was closed and the river dried up, fish trapped on the dry riverbed would then be gathered and eaten. Before winter storms caused floods, the dam would be breached, allowing the river to flow naturally again, while fish would be collected in the dried-up river channel. By then, there would be enough food stored to last the winter in which the cropland would lie fallow.|$|E

At harvest (145 days after planting), {{the incidence of}} the Aspergillus flavus group and the aflatoxin concentration were greatest in damaged kernels. Extensive colonization of sound mature kernels (SMK) by the A. flavus group occurred with the drought stress treatment (56 % kernels colonized); colonization was less in the <b>irrigated</b> <b>plot</b> (7 %) and the drought stress plot with cooled soil (11 %) and was intermediate in the <b>irrigated</b> <b>plot</b> with heated soil (26 %).

Colonization of SMK by the A. flavus group and aflatoxin production were greater with hot dry conditions. Neither elevated temperature alone nor drought stress alone caused aflatoxin contamination in SMK. When the ratio of SMK colonized by A. flavus compared with A. niger was greater than 19 : 1, there was aflatoxin contamination, but there was none if this ratio was less than 9 : 1.

Solar pump {{may be an}} alternative to the electric motor operated pumps for irrigated crop production in the country, especially for the off-grid rural areas. This paper presents the technical and economic suitability of solar pump irrigations of rice and non-rice (upland) crop productions in Bangladesh. Four solar pumps (submersible type, 1, 050 Wp) were installed in different locations for irrigating rice, wheat and vegetables. The solar pumps were used for drip irrigation and furrow irrigation for cultivation of brinjal and tomato during the winter seasons of 2010 - 2011, 2011 - 2012 and 2012 - 2013. There were no significant differences of yields of brinjal between drip and furrow irrigations in the year 2010 - 2011 in Gazipur and during 2011 - 2012 in Jamalpur. But in 2012 - 2013, significantly higher yield of brinjal was obtained from drip irrigated plots (43. 9 t/ha) compared to the furrow irrigated plots (38. 6 t/ha). There {{was no significant difference between}} drip and furrow irrigation methods in Jamalpur in terms of tomato yield. Significantly higher yields of tomato were recorded in Gazipur from drip irrigated plots than those of furrow irrigated plots in both the year 2011 - 2012 and 2012 - 2013. Water savings by drip irrigation over furrow irrigation for brinjal and tomato were 53. 3 % and 56. 2 %, respectively.

An irrigation experiment {{was conducted in}} Taiga forest in eastern Siberia to evaluate the effect of heavy precipitation on greenhouse gas (GHG; CO 2, CH 4, and N 2 O) fluxes in the soil. The GHG fluxes on the soil surface were measured using a closed-chamber method and GHG production rates in the mineral soil were estimated using the concentration-gradient method based on Fick's law. Irrigation water (20 mm day^[- 1]) was applied continuously for six days (120 mm in total; {{the same amount of}} summer precipitation in this region). Greenhouse gas production rates in the organic layer (O-layer) were defined as the difference between the GHG fluxes and the GHG production rates in the mineral soil. Carbon dioxide flux was measured both in root-intact (Rs) and trenched plots (Rmw). The root respiration rate (Rr) was calculated as the difference between Rs and Rmw. Considering root distribution in the soil, we regarded CO 2 production rate in the mineral soil as microbial respiration rate in the mineral soil (Rmm) and microbial respiration rate in the O-layer (Rmo) as the difference between Rmw and Rmm. Irrigation increased both soil temperature and moisture in the <b>irrigated</b> <b>plot.</b> The Rs, CH 4 flux and N 2 O flux during the irrigation period were higher in the <b>irrigated</b> <b>plot</b> than that in the non-irrigated plot (P < 0. 05; mean Rs ± S.

Four plots of Midland grain sorghum were irrigated with portable sprinkler lines and four with gated pipe and furrows. Cultural practices {{were the same}} for all plots with the exception that the sprinkler plots did not receive any cultivation at the time of furrowing the plots to be furrow irrigated. The results obtained were: Runoff losses on the sprinkler plots averaged 0. 5 per cent of the water applied. On the furrow plots 6. 67 per cent of applied water ran off. Evaporation and deep percolation were assumed to be the difference between runoff loss and total water loss. These combined losses were 16. 8 per cent of the water applied on sprinkler plots and 19. 1 per cent of the applied water on furrow plots. The water application efficiency on sprinkler plots averaged 82. 7 per cent as compared to an average of 74. 2 per cent on furrow <b>irrigated</b> <b>plots.</b> The water storage efficiency on furrow <b>irrigated</b> <b>plots</b> averaged 93. 0 per cent as compared to an average of 88. 5 per cent on sprinkler plots.

While studies often emphasize biotic resistance, it is less widely appreciated how the physical environment affects community vulnerability to invasion. In this study we performed field experiments to test how abiotic variation directly and indirectly influences {{the extent to which}} Linepithema humile Mayr (Argentine ants) invade seasonally dry environments in southern California. In controlled and replicated experiments involving drip irrigation, we demonstrate (i) that elevated levels of soil moisture increased both the abundance of Argentine ants and their ability to invade native ant communities and (ii) that cessation of irrigation caused declines in the abundance of Argentine ants and led to their withdrawal from previously occupied areas. Because drip irrigation stimulated plant growth, in an additional experiment we manipulated both soil moisture and plant cover to assess the direct vs. indirect effects of added water on the abundance of L. humile. Local abundance of Argentine ants increased in <b>irrigated</b> <b>plots</b> but was 38 % higher in <b>irrigated</b> <b>plots</b> with plants compared to <b>irrigated</b> <b>plots</b> where plant growth was suppressed.

In bed-planted alfalfa, subsurface drip lateral spacings of 1. 02 m (40 inch) and 2. 04 m (80 inch) installed at an average depth of 40 cm below bed centers were investigated beginning in 1991. During the first one and one-half year operation, approximately 20 percent higher yields were achieved in the drip plots with 94 percent of the water application amounts used in the furrow <b>irrigated</b> <b>plots.</b> Problems with surface soil wetting were noted in all drip treatments during the 1991 - 1992 phase (Phase I) of the experiment. These problems resulted {{in the decision to}} reduce water applications during a "dry-down " period during each harvest cycle to allow for harvest equipment traffic while limiting potential for soil compaction and plant damage from equipment. To provide an alternative method to deal with the surface soil wetting, the alfalfa crop was terminated in late 1992, the drip system replaced at 63 to 70 cm (25 to 28 inch) depth, alfalfa replanted in 1993, and the system operated in subsequent years.

According to the climatic and pedological conditions of the experimental site, trees grafted on FD could, depending on cultivar, be planted in densities from 519 to 1111 trees/ha.

The fiber from the winter growth was significantly finer than that of the summer growth, but only a little finer as compared to those of the autunm and spring growths. Tensile strenght differences were highly significant for fibers from the lip and base sections of the stalks, while for growing seasons they were barely significant. Fibers of the tips sections were significantly stronger than those of the base section, but a little stronger when compared with those of the middle section. No difference was found between the fibers of the base and middle sections of the stalk regarding tensile strength. Concerning the season of growth {{it was found that the}} fibers from the summer growth were significantly weaker for tensile strength than those of the other growing seasons, mainly as compared to those of the winter growth. Irrigation and fertilizing treatments had no effect on fiber tensile strength. To conclude, it may be stated that if fine and strong fibers were in demand by any ramie mill, it might be practical before degumming to divide at middle the bundles of crude fiber, and to handle the superior half separately, or besides this, to work only with crude fiber ribbons from plant winter growth. These facts must be considered by breeders and fiber technologists in any ramie breeding and selection program or technological studies concerning tiic sampling for comparing fiber characteristics between ramie varieties or fibers coming from distinet producing countries...|$|E
40|$|Two {{projects}} were initiated to develop techniques {{to facilitate the}} disposal of dairy farm wastewater while valorizing their nutrient and water content for crop production. Both techniques {{are based on the}} con-cept that dairy farm wastewaters, as well as any other agricultural wastewater, are of low nutrient content and can be disposed off on relatively small cropped surfaces (0. 5 to 1. 0 ha). The first project consisted in developing and testing surface irrigation for the disposal of wastewaters on cropped land. A gated pipe is used to distribute wastewater over a length of 45 m and allowing this wastewater to run down the natural slope. This technique reduces the cost of wastewater disposal from $ 3 to $ 5 /m 3, to $ 1. 25 to $ 1. 50 /m 3. This technique requires a ground water control valve at the outlet of the subsurface drainage system, to elimi-nate the environmental impact of the direct loss of about 0. 25 % of the wastewater volume, during the irri-gation operation. Also, the <b>irrigated</b> <b>plot</b> must be rotated on a two year sequence to prevent soil K overlo-ading. The second project consisted in developing and testing a modified septic tank system for the treat-ment of milk house wastewaters. A grease trap was added before the septic tank and the seepage field was designed to cover 0. 45 ha of cropped land. This system distributes the milk house wastewater and nutrients over a cropped area, to prevent the accumulation of nutrients in the soil, provide water for the crop and decreases risks of system clogging...|$|E
40|$|A {{position}} {{paper on the}} major challenges of a smallholder irrigation farmer in Zimbabwe. Researchers on irrigated agriculture in Zimbabwe have often lamented the low productivity in smallholder irrigation schemes, citing inadequate resources {{on the part of}} farmers. According to Rukuni (1984 c) farmers often lack sufficient money and labour to deal with irrigated agriculture. Many irrigators have dryland plots which they continue to cultivate during the rainy season. At the same time these farmers have to be seen to be doing work in their <b>irrigated</b> <b>plots.</b> Many farmers’ children are in school most of the year and are {{not in a position to}} assist on the plot. Furthermore, irrigation means double cropping in any given year and this places heavy demands on a farmer’s resources. These factors, according to Rukuni (1984 c) seem to obliterate the possibility of irrigation schemes realizing their full potential as projected by planners and scheme designers. Projected production levels are often set with little consideration for the local situation, that is, without taking into account the local pressures and realities with which people have to contend. These projections are therefore unrealistic. Rukuni (1984 c) sees the unavailability of money for buying inputs and hiring labour as the main impediment in production, overlooking the possibilities which social relations bring into the production process. The social arrangements available to farmers offer alternatives, especially through exchange and other transactions which allow people to produce even when they lack cash. For instance, farmers with labour or draught power may not have <b>irrigated</b> <b>plots</b> but can exchange these resources for the use of <b>irrigated</b> <b>plots</b> for a specified time. This means that irrigation farmers can produce even when there is no money. Such arrangements are often not visible. Neither do they easily lend themselves to quantification...|$|R
40|$|Although {{the crucial}} role of deep rooting on the {{hydraulic}} functioning of tropical trees has been pointed out, studies dealing with root development below 2 m are still scarce. Our study aimed to gain insight into the fine root traits of rainfed and irrigated orange trees down to the root front in deep tropical soils. Irrigation was applied during dry periods, only 3 – 15 % more than the annual amounts of water supplied by rain. Fine roots were sampled down {{to a depth of}} 8 m on four dates in a randomized block design. The effects of soil depth and irrigation on major fine root traits, total fine root length and the relationship between leaf area index (LAI) and root area index (RAI) were studied. The total fine root mass was 728 g m− 2 in rainfed plots and 536 g m− 2 in <b>irrigated</b> <b>plots</b> during the driest period (Sept/Oct 2012). Across the four sampling dates, the mean depth of the root front was 6. 1 m in rainfed plots and 5. 5 m in <b>irrigated</b> <b>plots</b> close to the trees, and approximately 4. 5 m in the inter-row covered by Brachiaria decumbens plants. LAI was little influenced by irrigation (about 4. 5 m 2 m− 2), but mean RAI was 19. 1 m 2 m− 2 in rainfed plots and 13. 7 m 2 m− 2 in <b>irrigated</b> <b>plots.</b> Small irrigation rates reduced root development in very deep soil layers, and increased fruit production by 9 % during the dry year. Deep rooting provides access to water stored in deep soil layers during the rainy season, and thus might have an important functional role during dry periods in tropical orange orchards.

40|$|The {{benchmarking}} {{method is}} focused on definition and comparison of irrigation systems according to performance indicators. First, to compare irrigation systems {{from the point of}} view of their performances is a very complex task, cause the different skills are very linked to technical, economical and social context of the farmers. Second, the result analysis depends on the irrigation system objectives, for example food security, social equity, etc. Otherwise, the decisional level for the farmer is the irrigation system first including the <b>irrigated</b> <b>plot</b> seen as a production unit among others. To analyze performance indicators cannot be done without taking into account the typology of the irrigation system dealing both with the two levels (the plot and the irrigation system). Irrigation systems typology is until now an important key question taking into consideration its great complexity and its high range for the proposal of irrigation systems management models. According to different actors, there are in sub-Saharan Africa several proposals for typologies of irrigation systems. Face to the diversity of the typologies it is very doubtful to compare the performance indicators results. The challenge is to build an innovating typological method witch can help to better analyze irrigation systems performances. Of course, according to the region irrigation system typology is based on the mixing of many criteria and real or sham cases can be generated. The aim of this paper is to discuss the link between irrigation systems typology and performance indicators usage through a conceptual approach and examples. Key words: irrigation systems- indicator – performance –typolog...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION Breeders and physiologists {{continue}} to seek phenotypic and genetic markers {{that are easy to}} measure and help predict yield. METHODS In 2015, 49 dry bean genotypes from varying market classes were sown on 19 June 2015 on a Haverson and McCook loam at Lingle (WY). Experimental design was a split-plot with irrigation level the main plot and genotypes (one row only, 6 m, 76 -cm spacing) assigned to subplots. Irrigation levels were “unstressed” (for the season) vs. “partial drought. ” Partial drought consisted of full irrigation pre-bloom but was followed by approximately irrigation at 50 % potential evapotranspiration post-bloom. There were two replicates per genotype per water regime. The fully <b>irrigated</b> <b>plot</b> received 6. 09 inches of supplemental water while the limited plot received 2. 38 inches of supplemental water (irrigation was performed weekly). Other details of the methods are provided in Heitholt and Baumgartner (2016). Canopy temperatures were recorded on 9 August with a Spectrum Technologies IR Temp Meter. A second and similar study was sown on 27 May 2016 at Lingle (WY) with 23 genotypes on a Haverson, McCook loam and a Heldt silty clay. Plots (four rows) were 5 m long with 76 -cm rows. Differential watering (0. 75 inches vs. 0. 50 inches) was employed at each irrigation post-bloom with a split-plot arrangement (three replicates per genotype per irrigation regime). Canopy temperature was recorded mid-morning and mid-afternoon on 23 July with an Apogee MI- 2 H 0 infrared thermometer several days after a differential watering. Other methodological details for this second study are provided in Heitholt et al. (2017). A hail storm on 27 July terminated the crop and no yield data was collected...|$|E
40|$|Water {{transfers}} within {{mixed crops}} systems are complicated to understand {{due to the}} large number of complex interactions between the various components. Standard techniques fail to provide the proper assessment of the components of the water balance. Experiments and modeling developments are used to understand the dynamics of water transfers within the association of olive trees with annual crops under irrigation in Central Tunisia. The whole system is represented by a unit area made up of three components: a plot with the annual crop, a plot with the olive tree and a plot of bare soil. The modeling approach is based on the concept of reservoir. The model works on a daily time step and accounts for the lateral transfers of water occurring between the components of the system: (i) the water uptake by the roots of olive trees; (ii) the physical flow of water between the <b>irrigated</b> <b>plot</b> and the non-irrigated ones. A field experiment was carried out during 2 years (2002, 2003) and three crop cycles (spring potato, spring pea and autumn potato) in order to calibrate the model and test its validity. Olive tree transpiration was estimated from sap flow measurements and soil moisture in the different compartments was measured by neutron probe technique. The experimental data compare fairly well with the model outputs. The first purpose of the model is to understand the functioning of the olive tree-annual crop association from a water standpoint, but it can be easily extended to other intercropping systems mixing perennial vegetation with annual crops or used as a management tool. The estimates of the water extracted by the olive trees in each reservoir appear to be much more significant than those of the water physically transferred between reservoirs. ...|$|E

40|$|Grass and wildflower {{mixtures}} can be aesthetically appealing, water-conserving, low-maintenance {{alternatives to}} conventional turfgrass. One problem with these mixtures is {{loss of species}} diversity over time. We {{examined the effects of}} irrigation and mowing on the species diversity of 3 grass and wild-flower mixtures. The nonirrigated and non-mowed treatment combination maintained diversity most effectively whereas the irrigated and mowed treatment combination was least effective. Generally, when the irrigation treatment was significant (P 3 ̆c 0. 05), <b>irrigated</b> <b>plots</b> contained more wildflowers. When the mowing treatment was significant (P 3 ̆c 0. 05), mowed plots contained more common yarrow (Achillea millefolium L. [Asteraceae]) and strawberry clover (Trifolium fragiferum L. [Fabaceae]) and fewer Pacific aster (Symphyotrichum chilense (Nees) Nesom [Asteraceae]). Height measurements on non-mowed <b>plots</b> showed that <b>irrigated</b> <b>plots</b> had taller canopies than nonirrigated plots. Common yarrow was the most competitive wildflower, followed by strawberry clover and Pacific aster. Mixture 3 containing crested wheatgrass (Agropyron cristatum (L.) Gaertn.
