40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The project investigated changes in the human and natural environments of the marshlands bordering the tidal river Thames and the Thames Estuary between 1250 and 1550. At {{the beginning of this}} period the marshlands had largely been drained and protected by banks or walls, so that they could be used for arable and pastoral farming. During the three centuries studied, however, many of these reclaimed marshes were flooded by the sea or by freshwater inundation. The causes were partly natural and partly human. Major flooding events may have become more common, and clusters of North Sea storm surges occurred, in which winds and tides combined to thrust large quantities of sea-water into the Thames Estuary, overwhelming flood defences. At the same time, declining population after c. 1300, and associated agricultural recession, meant that it was no longer so profitable to defend the marshes against the sea. As a result, especially after the 1370 s, many marshes flooded, and attempts to recover them were given up. Among the areas most affected were parts of the Barking, East Ham and Dagenham marshes, the Isle of Dogs, Erith and Lesnes marshes and the marshes around the mouth of the river Medway. In these and other locations fishing, fowling and the cutting of reeds and rushes replaced farming as the main sources of employment and income. Londoners complained about some of the effects of flooding, but may have benefited from the 'retreat' from the down-river marshes, which reduced the flood risk to Southwark, Bermondsey and other vulnerable suburbs. Main Topics : Quantitative data was collected from manuscript sources, principally manorial accounts, bearing on the maintenance of coastal and river-side defences, and <b>expenditure</b> <b>on</b> <b>repairs</b> following storm surges. These take the form of time-series of annual expenditure for various locations around the Thames...|$|E

Best Management Practices (BMPs), including stone-lined ditches, turn outs, check dams, revetments, culverts and vegetative controls, are recommended by the Vermont Department of Transportation as low cost means of reducing the sediment and phosphorous run-off from backroads. However, their effectiveness, longevity and cost benefit are unknown. To address this gap, I assessed 100 BMPs at 43 erosion control projects constructed between 2005 and 2012 with funding from the Vermont Better Backroads program. BMP condition was compared to environmental factors that foreseeably affected how long they would remain intact. Increased road grade and exposure to flood events were the most significant predictors of project deterioration, although increased age affected specific BMPs. Only ten percent of assessed BMPs had failed, indicating that when properly maintained, BMPs may remain operable for over eight years. To understand the availability and distribution of town funds spent on backroad maintenance, I interviewed road foremen in five small, mountainous towns in Vermont. Town <b>expenditures</b> <b>on</b> <b>repairing</b> repeated road washouts were comparable to annual funds needed for “permanent fixes” of roads preliminarily identified to pose the highest risk to water quality.

40|$|The Agroforestry Tree Seeds Association of Lantapan (ATSAL) in Bukidnon province, {{southern}} Philippines {{was organized}} in 1998, {{facilitated by the}} World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF). Farmers were trained on germplasm collection, processing and marketing of agroforestry tree seeds and seedlings. ATSAL has been marketing various tree seeds and seedlings with apparent success, and has provided training on seed collection and nursery management to farmers, government technicians, and workers from non-government organizations (NGOs). This paper reports on the initial results of an on-going study to assess the effectiveness of ATSAL's marketing strategy, including group dynamics, and the issues and challenges the group faces. It was found that {{during the first two}} years, ATSAL's market share of greatly demanded timber tree species increased significantly, thus helping to disseminate widely these important species among farmers. ICRAF's technical back-up was an advantage, increasing the Association's market credibility. Subsequently, ATSAL extended its market to the central Philippines, but failed to meet the demand for seeds due to organizational limitations. Market competition exists, where a nonmember was able to take a larger market share than was the group. Nonetheless, ATSAL has established its name as a viable community-based seed and seedling producer, maintaining a stronghold in local and regional markets. Collective action is important for smallholders to break in, and gain market access, but is unlikely to sustain without effective leadership and some facilitation (in some cases even ongoing), thus requiring <b>expenditures</b> <b>on</b> <b>repairs</b> and maintenance through continuous technical and leadership training for the collective, and technical back-up and facilitation by an intermediary.

World-wide changes {{in the proportion of}} construction <b>expenditure</b> <b>on</b> new construction and repair and refurbishing of existing structures has occurred only the last two decades.

The following pages attempt to present the basic background of modern concrete repair approaches with regard to the intended use of building structures.

PISA score was selected as an indicator representing the educational competitiveness of 22 OECD countries, and this included some independent variables, such as per capita GDP, total public <b>expenditure</b> <b>on</b> education as a percentage of GDP, and total per capita public <b>expenditure</b> <b>on</b> education (US dollars), affecting educational competitiveness. We employed the fuzzy set analysis method (FS/QCA) to analyze the complex causal relationships among the factors affecting educational competitiveness. The research results show that there are three significant combinations of variables affecting educational competitiveness (PISA score). Model 1 is a configuration of four variables (high total <b>expenditure</b> <b>on</b> education as a percentage of GDP, high total per capita <b>expenditure</b> <b>on</b> education, high ratio of private-source <b>expenditure</b> <b>on</b> education to GDP, and high GDP), and includes Netherlands, Finland, Australia, and Ireland.
