500|$|As {{with the}} ISKCON-inspired [...] "Awaiting on You All", Allison views the {{conditions}} that Harrison imposes in the song's choruses as a rare exception within the singer's work. Elsewhere, Allison continues, Harrison's songwriting reveals [...] "a strong belief in the efficacy of unmerited divine grace". In a 1982 interview, Harrison described his statement on God rewarding those who first look to God as a [...] "flexible" [...] one, adding: [...] "In one way, I'm {{never going to get}} out of here [...] unless it's by His grace, but then again … he amount of grace <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>expect</b> from God should be equal to the amount of grace I can gather or earn." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Wichita Linebacker" [...] {{received}} mixed {{to negative}} reviews. Eric Goldman of IGN gave the episode a 7.0 out of 10, indicating {{that it was}} [...] "good". Despite this, he wrote a mixed review, opining that [...] "as far as mysteries go, this was a so-so one," [...] that [...] "the Hearst campus rapist story just doesn't {{seem to be getting}} the proper weight it requires," [...] and that [...] "there's also some strange tonal issues currently." [...] However, he praised the return of Weevil. Rowan Kaiser, writing for The A.V. Club, was also relatively critical, while focusing praise on Weevil's storyline. He referred to [...] "Wichita Linebacker" [...] as [...] "what <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>expect</b> were the show not so ambitious. Here, Veronica isn't going to Hearst College, she's going to Television College, where things that are college-y happen." [...] Television Without Pity gave the episode a [...] "C+". [...] "I don't think it's being overly harsh to say that this was not one of this show's stronger or more exciting episodes. The writing was oddly flat, in the first place, and the attention to detail was subpar as well." [...] In addition, the reviewer criticized the show's treatment of its relationships. [...] "That's one of the things that's made this show great in the past -- layering in complex and important relationships while not actually being a relationship-centered show. I only hope they go somewhere with the gambling thing, because otherwise, in my opinion, this episode will have been a total waste of time." ...|$|E

2500|$|Former {{president}} and former army chief Pervez Musharraf criticised the police commandos inability to kill {{any of the}} gunmen, saying [...] "If this was the elite force <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>expect</b> them to have shot down those people who attacked them, the reaction, their training should be on a level that if anyone shoots toward the company they are guarding, {{in less than three}} seconds they should shoot the man down."

2500|$|The Prime Minister {{agreed to}} an inquiry but limited its scope to only one issue – the {{allegations}} that Collins undermined the Director of the Serious Fraud Office, Adam Feeley in 2011. He appointed former High Court judge Lester Chisholm to conduct the inquiry. David Cunliffe felt this was an inadequate response and said Labour should be consulted on the terms of reference for the inquiry: [...] "There is a well embedded constitutional convention that requires the Prime Minister to consult with {{the leader of the}} opposition this close to an election on a matter this serious. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>expect</b> to be consulted on the terms of reference." [...] Key refused to consult Labour over the terms saying [...] "We're not going on a witch hunt." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Gary Posner's 1999 interview, Klass {{explained}} {{his views on}} UFOs: [...] "As I turn 80, my fondest hope is that a genuine ET craft will land on our back patio and that I will be abducted. Hopefully, with the ETs' advanced technology and knowledge, {{they will be able}} to cure my spinal and walking problems and the damage to my vocal cord. Of course, I would have to pay Stanton Friedman $10,000 — based on my long-standing wager that UFOs will never be proven real — but <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>expect</b> to become wealthy from the royalties of a new book titled Why Me, ET?.

2500|$|Brett Elston of GamesRadar {{felt that}} the game seemed to be [...] "a scaled-back version" [...] of the {{original}} Rearmed. He felt the levels were [...] "watered down" [...] levels and cited poor framerate issues. [...] Reviewer Jobert Atienza of 1UP.com stated that [...] "In many respects, it's exactly what <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>expect</b> from a follow-up: {{more of the same}} with minor enhancements. At the same time, it is just more of the same with some enhancements, but Fatshark seemed to be aiming to make the best damn sequel they could...just without rocking the boat too much." [...] GameSpot's Tom Mc Shea gave the game a poor review, criticizing unresponsive controls and cheap deaths. Bryan Vore of Game Informer praised the game's varied environments and the new jump mechanics, but noted that some of the boss battles did not make creative use of the bionic arm's abilities like the original Rearmed.|$|E
2500|$|The Virginia {{chapter of}} the American Civil Liberties Union {{wrote a letter to}} Marshall stating that [...] "any attempt to exclude service members from the National Guard would be unconstitutional and ill-advised, and would {{certainly}} face a federal court challenge," [...] and urging him to withdraw the bill.

2500|$|In February 2005, ADL National Director Abraham Foxman {{called it}} hypocritical for hip-hop {{producer}} Russell Simmons to lead an ad campaign against anti-Semitism while also, according to Foxman's view, defending or excusing Louis Farrakhan's anti-Semitic statements. Later that year the ADL urged prominent black leaders including Simmons to reconsider {{their support for}} Farrakhan and Malik Zulu Shabazz organizing the Millions More Movement and to [...] "stand up" [...] against black anti-Semitism. Simmons, responding to ADL Director Abraham Foxman, said, [...] "simply put, you are misguided, arrogant, and very disrespectful of African Americans, and most importantly, your statements will unintentionally or intentionally lead to a negative impression of Jews {{in the minds of}} millions of African Americans". [...] Foxman replied, [...] "If there were a Jewish event which was led by an out-and-out racist, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>expect</b> Black leaders to say to me that ADL should {{have nothing to do with}} it. And I would agree with them, rather than condemn them for their action." ...|$|E

2500|$|When the Edinburgh and Northern Railway (E) and the Dundee and Perth Railway (D) {{were seeking}} Parliamentary {{approval}} in 1845, it was {{proposed by their}} engineers that from Perth both should share a line running along the south bank of the Tay as far as Newburgh, where the D would cross to the north bank, and the E leave the Tay and head south to a ferry crossing of the Forth. [...] Matthew {{had been in a}} very small minority supporting this, and the D as built crossed the Tay at Perth. In 1864, when a bridge crossing the Tay at Dundee was proposed, Matthew urged that a bridge at Newburgh was preferable to a bridge at Dundee, a Newburgh bridge giving much the same reduction in the rail distance between Dundee and the Forth ferry-ports from which passengers could cross to Edinburgh as a bridge at Dundee but doing so by a shorter (and therefore cheaper) crossing of the Tay. [...] He argued the costs of a Dundee bridge were being grossly under-estimated To erect a substantial bridge, not a flimsy spectral thing, which might or not vanish as a phantom the first storm, or break down under the vibration caused by a heavy, rapid, moving train, [...] would, in my opinion cost nearly double, and probably much more than double, the sum the Engineer states; upon this I stake my judgement against that of the Engineer, noting in passing [...] from the geological indices, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>expect</b> the foundation to be more regular at Newburgh than at Dundee, consequently better.|$|E
2500|$|Early in the {{recording}} process, Kerrang! reported that the band's new album would be released sometime in 2010. Towards the end of {{the recording}} process, Gaskarth said the album would be released in January 2011. On August 17, a demo was posted online of the track [...] "Actors". Gaskarth said he posted it because he [...] "thought people should hear it." [...] He said that the song wouldn't fit on Dirty Work since it [...] "didn't represent the theme of the new album closely enough." [...] After appearing at Reading and Leeds Festivals in August, the band returned to the studio to finalise the album's track listing in September. In October and November, the band went on a headlining club tour in the US with support from A Rocket to the Moon and City (Comma) State. The band held a contest where five fans could hear the new album at each stop on the tour. On October 18, the album's title as revealed: Dirty Work. In November, Barakat revealed that the album's release date had been pushed back to early spring and {{that the majority of the}} album's songs were mixed. In December, [...] "Merry Christmas, Kiss My Ass" [...] was made available for streaming. In January 2011, Gaskarth said the group were sorting out the track order and working on the album's artwork. He also said that the album was originally going to be released in the same month, [...] "but now it looks like we’re going to have to push it back" [...] and were aiming for its release between January and March. During an interview in early February, Gaskarth stated that the band were currently approving artwork.
