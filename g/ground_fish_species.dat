40|$|Fishing has {{affected}} North Sea <b>ground</b> <b>fish</b> <b>species</b> diversity. De. ning Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) {{to address this}} will rely on ground fish surveys. Species-specific catch efficiencies vary between trawl gears, and apparent species diversity distributions {{are influenced by the}} type of gear used in each survey. It may be that no single survey depicts actual diversity distributions. Two MPA scenarios designed to protect <b>ground</b> <b>fish</b> <b>species</b> diversity are described, the first based on unadjusted International Bottom Trawl Survey data and the second based on the same data adjusted to take account of catchability. Spatial overlap between these scenarios is low. Assuming that the adjusted data best describe the actual species diversity distribution, the level of diversity safeguarded by MPAs, based on unadjusted data, is determined. A fishing effort redistribution model is used to estimate the increase in fishing activity that is likely to occur in MPAs that take catchability into account, if closed areas based solely on the unadjusted ground fish data were implemented. Our results highlight the need to take survey-gear catchability into account when designating MPAs to address fish-species diversity issue...|$|E
40|$|Ecological {{impacts of}} {{military}} bombing activities in Puerto Rico {{have often been}} described as minimal, with recurrent allegations of confounding effects by hurricanes, coral diseases and local anthropogenic stressors. Reef craters, though isolated, are associated with major colony fragmentation and framework pulverization, with a net permanent loss of reef bio-construction. In contrast, adjacent non-bombarded reef sections have significantly higher benthic spatial relief and biodiversity. We compared benthic communities on 35 - 50 year-old bomb-cratered coral reefs at Culebra and Vieques Islands, with adjacent non-impacted sites; 2) coral recruit density and fish community structure within and outside craters; and 3) early effects of a rehabilitation effort using low-tech Staghorn coral Acropora cervicornis farming. Reef craters ranged in size from approximately 50 to 400 m² and were largely dominated by heavily fragmented, flattened benthos, with coral cover usually below 2 % and dominance by non-reef building taxa (i. e., filamentous algal turfs, macroalgae). Benthic spatial heterogeneity was lower within craters which also resulted in a lowered functional value as fish nursery <b>ground.</b> <b>Fish</b> <b>species</b> richness, abundance and biomass, and coral recruit density were lower within craters.

The {{relationship}} between the fish stock on the continental shelf and the Bane d'Arguin {{is important for the}} management of the Mauritanian marine living resources. The shallow waters act hereby as a nursery. Nine crustacean, three molluscs and seventeen <b>fish</b> <b>species</b> were found on the tidal flats.

Percentage data of the epibenthic organisms' coverage and samples of the fish community with gillnet and visual census showed that biofouling in artificial reefs might have more than one functional role, acting as a facilitator in the recruitment of <b>fish</b> <b>species</b> and as a link in the trophic marine chain. Through the increase of localized structural complexity provided by the reef itself and by the fouling organisms which act as "engineering species", additional protection options are offered to the ichthyic community, especially recruits.

40|$|Populations {{of one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} predatory <b>fish</b> <b>species</b> within Baltic Sea coastal ecosystems, the Eurasian Perch (Perca fluviatilis), have declined in some coastal areas during recent decades. This has caused negative effects on an ecological, commercial, and cultural scale, and protection and restoration of recruitment areas (perch spawning grounds) are believed to be an important player in supporting future stocks. Freshwater systems close to coastal areas have previously been noted as important spawning <b>grounds</b> for other <b>fish</b> <b>species</b> resident in coastal areas, but relatively little is known of this for perch. In this study, the main aim was to assess the importance of freshwater systems for the recruitment of coastal perch along the Swedish Baltic Sea coast, using otolith micro-chemistry. Otoliths were removed from perch specimens and analysed for strontium (Sr) and calcium (Ca) ratios via particle induced x-ray emissions techniques (μPIXE). In order to determine birth origin of the coastal perch in the study areas, a freshwater baseline was established using other freshwater recruited coastal perch, as well as lake perch specimens. The results showed that the majority of perch juveniles in coastal areas were recruited in brackish water, albeit with variation across areas. In one area however, freshwater systems appeared to be extremely important for perch recruitment in the coastal area.

Gut content analysis revealed that within <b>fish</b> <b>species</b> almost the same food items were consumed regardless of the different habitats in which they were caught. Crustaceans (mainly copepods, crabs and shrimps) were the preferred food for most zoobenthivores and omnivores, while fishes and algae were the preferred food for piscivores and herbivores, respectively. The mean d 13 C values of fishes and food items from the mangrove habitats were significantly depleted to those from the seagrass habitats by 6 _ 9 and 9 _ 7 % for fishes and food items, respectively, and to those from the mud and sand flats by 3 _ 5 and 5 _ 8 %, respectively. Fishes and food items from the mud and sand flats were significantly depleted as compared to those of the seagrass habitats by 3 _ 4 and 3 _ 9 %, for fishes and food, respectively. Similar to other studies done in different geographical locations, the importance of mangrove and seagrass themselves as a primary source of carbon to higher trophic levels is limited.

40|$|The {{construction}} of marinas {{along the shoreline}} has caused substantial habitat destruction within the sheltered coastal areas previously used as nursery <b>grounds</b> by many <b>fish</b> <b>species.</b> However, although the negative ecological impacts of these constructions have been reported extensively, their potential roles in {{the functioning of the}} coastal zone remain largely unknown. Here, we surveyed the juveniles of 4 Diplodus species in 5 marinas located along the French Mediterranean coast to assess whether rocky fishes can successfully settle inside these artificialized coastal areas. Inter-specific differences in the spatiotemporal use of the various artificial habitats provided by marinas were investigated between April and August over 2 consecutive years. We also tested the potential benefit of pegging additional artificial habitats (Biohuts) on docks and pontoons to increase their value as <b>fish</b> nursery <b>grounds.</b> Our results suggest that although variations in marina and artificial habitat preferences exist between species, Diplodus juveniles repeatedly colonize marinas. Their average abundances on added Biohut habitats were twice as high as on nearby bare surfaces. This suggests that increasing the complexity of the vertical structures of marinas can considerably enhance their suitability for juvenile rocky fishes, especially at the youngest stages, when mortality is highest. Therefore, as long as marina water quality is well controlled, ecological engineering within these man-made habitats might reduce the ecological consequences of urban development by providing suitable alternative artificial nursery <b>grounds</b> for rocky <b>fishes...</b>|$|R
