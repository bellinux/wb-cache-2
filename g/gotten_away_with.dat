Sputnikmusic's Tyler Fisher stated that [...] "The Neptunes turn {{in their best}} beat in years on [...] "Gotta Have It", sampling James Brown in a realm completely removed from funk and soul." [...] Slant Magazine's Matthew Cole stated that [...] "the duo volleys ball lines at each other on [...] "Otis" [...] and do call-and-response riffing on [...] "Gotta Have It," [...] sounding {{like a pair of}} hustlers who can't believe how much they've <b>gotten</b> <b>away</b> <b>with.</b> The chemistry between the two friends and self-described sibling rivals is conveyed perfectly on those two tracks." [...] David Amidon of PopMatters commented that several songs on the album are a [...] "hirlwind of excitement, particularly [...] "Gotta Have It", which finds Kanye and Jay spitting such decadent, pro-Black-laden material as [...] "Maybachs on bachs on bachs on bachs on bachs / Who in that? / Oh, shit, it's just blacks on blacks on blacks". Popdust's Emily Exton reported that that [...] "he two trade lines instead of verses in what results in a surefire example of what can happen when two pros team up." [...] The song peaked at number 69 on the US Billboard Hot 100, and at numbers 14 and 13 on the Billboard Hot Rap Songs and Hot R/Hip-Hop Songs charts respectively.|$|E

500|$|Chief Wiggum's order {{during the}} suspect line-up to [...] "send in the clowns" [...] is {{an allusion to}} the Stephen Sondheim song [...] "Send in the Clowns" [...] from the 1973 musical A Little Night Music. The Sondheim musical took its name from Mozart's Serenade No. 13 for strings in G major, Eine kleine Nachtmusik, which is the theme tune to Sideshow Bob's show. The close up shot of Krusty's face behind bars in the {{beginning}} of act two is a reference of the closing credit motif of the British television series The Prisoner from the 1960s. The background music in that scene resembles the theme of the television series [...] at one point. The line [...] "The Day the Laughter Died", shown during the newscast, is a reference to the Andrew Dice Clay album released the previous month. Sideshow Bob is reading [...] by Alexander Dumas to the studio audience. [...] The song [...] "Ev'ry Time We Say Goodbye" [...] by Cole Porter is featured in the episode. Following Sideshow Bob's arrest, he mutters: [...] "I would've <b>gotten</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> it too, if it weren't for these meddling kids.", which is a reference to a catchphrase from Hanna-Barbera's animated television show Scooby-Doo which was airing on ABC as A Pup Named Scooby-Doo when this episode aired.|$|E
500|$|Nikki and Paulo {{were killed}} off due to being disliked by much of Losts fan base. Show runner Damon Lindelof {{admitted}} that the couple were [...] "universally despised" [...] by fans. Lindelof explained that [...] "back when we (the producers) had more good faith with the audience, we could have <b>gotten</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> these shenanigans. Given the backlash against them, we had {{to clean up the}} mess." [...] The decision to kill them off in one flashback episode was decided by the producers in December 2006. It was also stated by Lindelof and fellow show runners Carlton Cuse that despite Nikki and Paulo's bad reception, they felt the episode was necessary to explain their original plan of introducing former background characters to the main cast. Lindelof suggested having the characters be buried alive. Although actress Kiele Sanchez said that she wasn't bothered by the general dislike of her character, she was very nervous during the burial scene, because she has claustrophobia. Speculation about the duo's deaths began months before the actual episode aired. Santoro {{said in an interview with}} Brazilian Rolling Stone that his character was going to die in the middle of the third season. Another clue about the deaths came when it was announced that Sanchez was signed on to film a fall 2007 pilot for the ABC show, Football Wives.|$|E

Case likened Sharon to a younger Jill Foster Abbott (Jess Walton), telling Soap Opera Weekly that Jill [...] "was kind of like Sharon. She was nice...no one thought she was a gold digger—at first." [...] According to the actress, Sharon does [...] "weird things" [...] and panics when stressed, and her mistakes [...] "eat away at her", as [...] "She doesn't do well with secrets". Case also described the character as feeling insecure and unworthy of being in a happy relationship, telling the Star-Banner that [...] "Sharon goes through many emotions in a week". MSN characterized Sharon as a [...] "bitch" [...] after a storyline in which she took over Newman Enterprises in 2012. Of the writing for her character, Case said it is indispensable: [...] "They both have to be there. I couldn't have <b>gotten</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> this without those lines". However, the actress has expressed displeasure with Sharon being paired with [...] "too many men" [...] because it [...] "waters her down", wanting to incorporate different aspects of Sharon into her performance. Case stated that Sharon, who sees visions of her deceased daughter Cassie (Camryn Grimes), believes that [...] "she is connected to the spiritual world".|$|E

Encountering a ghost, monster, or other supernatural creature who is terrorizing the local populace, they decide to investigate. The kids split up to look for clues and suspects while being chased at turns by the monster. Eventually, the kids come to realize the ghost and other paranormal activity is actually an elaborate hoax, and—often {{with the help of}} a Rube Goldberg-like trap designed by Fred—they capture the villain and unmask him.

[...] USA Today gave the film {{three and a half}} stars out of four, saying of the screenplay, [...] "It appears as if screenwriters Brian Helgeland and Curtis Hanson have pulled off a miracle in keeping multiple stories straight. Have they ever. Ellroy's novel has four extra layers of plot and three times as many characters ... the writers have trimmed unwieldy muscle, not just fat, and <b>gotten</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> it." [...] In his review for Newsweek, David Ansen wrote, [...] "L.A. Confidential asks the audience to raise its level a bit, too—you actually {{have to pay attention to}} follow the double-crossing intricacies of the plot. The reward for your work is dark and dirty fun." [...] Richard Schickel, in his review for Time, wrote, [...] "It's a movie of shadows and half lights, the best approximation of the old black-and-white noir look anyone has yet managed on color stock. But it's no idle exercise in style. The film's look suggests how deep the tradition of police corruption runs." ...|$|E
