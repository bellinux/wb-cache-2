5|$|John Sadler has {{described}} this expedition as 'like {{so many of}} its predecessors, fail to yield any significant results,' neither forcing the Scots onto a battlefield nor making any major territorial gains. Brown too <b>has</b> <b>described</b> <b>the</b> campaign as 'utterly futile.' Sadler has ascribed the Scottish success in part to their reliance on a Fabian strategy to wear out the English whilst avoiding direct confrontation. Henry's lacklustre campaign was condemned by contemporary observers, with Welsh chronicler Adam of Usk saying that the Scots did more damage to the English than {{had been done to}} them. Likewise, the Scotichronicon suggested that 'nothing worthy of remembrance was done' by their enemies.|$|E
5|$|While the Lithuanian side {{considered}} {{the agreement to}} be an enforceable political treaty, the Polish side considered {{it to be a}} minor military agreement, later superseded by a ceasefire agreement between Lithuania and Żeligowski reached on November 29. American historian Alfred Erich Senn has argued {{that it was not a}} regular political treaty, as it did not require ratification, but the presence of political representatives of both sides indicated that it was not a mere military agreement. Poland and Lithuania also disagreed about the agreement's relation to the Vilnius question, which was not explicitly addressed in the treaty. The Lithuanian side considered that the agreement assigned Vilnius to Lithuania, while the Polish side argued that it did not concern Vilnius or other territorial claims. Senn <b>has</b> <b>described</b> <b>the</b> agreement as tacitly leaving Vilnius to Lithuania.|$|E
5|$|Many {{important}} events occur off-camera {{and there is}} no artificial exposition in the form of voice-over or flashbacks, with the exceptions of two flashbacks – one {{at the end of the}} pilot episode that replays a moment from earlier in the same episode and one at the end of the fourth season finale that shows a short clip of a character tutoring his younger brother earlier in the season. Thus, the viewer needs to follow every conversation closely to understand the ongoing story arc and the relevance of each character to it. Salon.com <b>has</b> <b>described</b> <b>the</b> show as novelistic in structure, with a greater depth of writing and plotting than other crime shows. Each season of The Wire consists of between ten and thirteen episodes which form several multi-layered narratives. Simon chose this structure with an eye towards long story arcs that draw a viewer in, which then results in a more satisfying payoff. He uses the metaphor of a visual novel in several interviews, describing each episode as a chapter, and has also commented that this allows a fuller exploration of the show's themes in time not spent on plot development.|$|E

5|$|While {{the book}} was {{readable}} enough to sell, its dryness ensured that it was seen as aimed at specialist scientists {{and could not be}} dismissed as mere journalism or imaginative fiction. Unlike the still-popular Vestiges, it avoided the narrative style of the historical novel and cosmological speculation, though the closing sentence clearly hinted at cosmic progression. Darwin had long been immersed in the literary forms and practices of specialist science, and made effective use of his skills in structuring arguments. David Quammen <b>has</b> <b>described</b> <b>the</b> book as written in everyday language for a wide audience, but noted that Darwin's literary style was uneven: in some places he used convoluted sentences that are difficult to read, while in other places his writing was beautiful. Quammen advised that later editions were weakened by Darwin making concessions and adding details to address his critics, and recommended the first edition. James T. Costa said that because {{the book was}} an abstract produced in haste in response to Wallace's essay, it was more approachable than the big book on natural selection Darwin had been working on, which would have been encumbered by scholarly footnotes and much more technical detail. He added that some parts of Origin are dense, but other parts are almost lyrical, and the case studies and observations are presented in a narrative style unusual in serious scientific books, which broadened its audience.|$|E

In 2002, Dragoljub Milanović, {{the general manager}} of RTS, was sentenced to 10 years in prison because he had failed to order the workers in the building to evacuate, despite knowing that the building would be bombed. Amnesty International <b>has</b> <b>described</b> <b>the</b> NATO attack as a war crime.|$|E

A covered stent-graft could protect the carotid artery from direct tumor infiltration. As a consequence, CBS and formation of a pseudoaneurysm can be prevented.|$|R

25|$|The Sudanese {{government}} {{has been accused of}} suppressing information by jailing and killing witnesses since 2004, and tampering with evidence, such as covering up mass graves. The Sudanese {{government has}} also arrested and harassed journalists, thus limiting the extent of press coverage of the situation in Darfur. While the United States government <b>has</b> <b>described</b> <b>the</b> conflict as genocide, the UN has not recognized the conflict as such. (see List of declarations of genocide in Darfur).|$|E

25|$|Knygnešiai (Lithuanian book smugglers) smuggled illegal {{books and}} {{periodicals}} across the border. The {{number of such}} publications kept increasing despite strict sanctions and persecution of the activists. The ban created a well-defined and organized opposition to Russian rule and culture—the opposite of its original intent. The Lithuanian historian Edvardas Gudavičius <b>has</b> <b>described</b> <b>the</b> ban {{as a test of}} the concept of Lithuania: had there been no resistance, the language would have become a historical footnote, and the modern nation would never have been created.|$|E
25|$|Angelos is a vocal {{advocate}} for introducing parity mechanisms in Major League Baseball to develop competitive {{balance in the}} league. In various speaking engagements, interviews and in a cover story with SportsPro Magazine, Angelos <b>has</b> <b>described</b> <b>the</b> many disadvantages for small and mid-market teams within Major League Baseball’s decentralized model. Angelos argues that introducing a salary cap and floor would reduce payroll inequality and allow small market teams {{to keep pace with}} baseball’s wealthiest, big market teams. Historically, he argues, successful small market teams like Oakland and Tampa Bay have overcome extraordinary economic disadvantages to compete successfully with the league’s biggest spenders.|$|E
25|$|Like most sans-serifs Akzidenz-Grotesk is 'monoline' in structure, {{with all}} strokes {{of the letter}} of quite similar width. This gives a sense of {{simplicity}} and an absence of the adornment and flourishes seen in many more decorative sans-serifs {{of the late nineteenth}} century influenced by the Art Nouveau style. Modern type designer Martin Majoor <b>has</b> <b>described</b> <b>the</b> general design of Akzidenz-Grotesk and its ancestors as similar in letterforms to the Didone serif fonts that were standard types in the nineteenth century, such as Didot and Walbaum. This is most visible in the quite folded-up apertures of letters such as ‘a’ and ‘c’.|$|E
