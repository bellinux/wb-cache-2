40|$|An {{exchange}} economy with fixed prices is considered. In this setting a Walrasian equilibrium generically does not exist. In a so-called Dreze equilibrium rationing on excess demand and on excess {{supply of the}} non-numeraire commodities is present. In this paper {{a new type of}} <b>adjustment</b> <b>process</b> is introduced, namely an <b>adjustment</b> <b>process</b> in quantities or, equivalently, rationing schemes. The total excess demand {{as a function of the}} rationing schemes does not satisfy the assumptions under which any of the existing price <b>adjustment</b> <b>processes</b> converges to aWalrasian equilibrium. From the main theorem it follows that the quantity <b>adjustment</b> <b>process</b> converges generically to a Dreze equilibrium. The assumptions made with respect to consumptions sets, preferences and initial endowments are standard. No restrictions are made with respect to the initial state of the economy, which determines the starting point of the <b>adjustment</b> <b>process.</b> Moreover, it follows from the main theorem that the number of Dreze equilibria is generically odd. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a stability {{analysis for the}} dynamic model of a travel route choice <b>adjustment</b> <b>process</b> proposed by Dupuis and Nagurney (1993). In particular, we investigate both local and global stability issues for this <b>adjustment</b> <b>process</b> that may be of concern to transportation planners and analysts. Two distinct approaches for stability analysis are proposed based on the general stability analysis results obtained recently by Zhang and Nagurney (1995) for projected dynamical systems. The global stability results are established using a "monotonicity" approach, under monotonicity assumptions on the link cost and travel disutility functions. A distinct approach, termed a "regularity" approach, is then provided to verify the local stability of the <b>adjustment</b> <b>process</b> at a regular equilibrium flow pattern. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{continuous}} time price and quantity <b>adjustment</b> <b>process</b> is considered for an economy facing price rigidities. In {{the short run}} prices {{are assumed to be}} completely fixed and the markets are cleared by quantity adjustments until a fixed price equilibrium is reached where every market is typically characterized by either supply rationing or demand rationing. Next prices are assumed to move upwards in case of demand rationing on a market and downwards when supply rationing occurs. Markets are kept in equilibrium by infinitesimal quantity adjustments such that at every moment in time a fixed price equilibrium results. Using only standard assumptions on the primitive concepts of the economy it is shown that the price and quantity <b>adjustment</b> <b>process</b> indeed converges to a fixed price equilibrium for the initially given prices. Moreover, in the long run, when prices are allowed to change, the process is shown to reach a Walrasian equilibrium. A simplicial algorithm is developed to approximate the price and quantity <b>adjustment</b> <b>process</b> arbitrarily close. It is shown that the path of price systems and rationing schemes generated by the algorithm converges to the path of the <b>adjustment</b> <b>process.</b> <b>Adjustment</b> processes; price rigidities; simplicial algorithms...|$|R

Using monthly observations from January 1979 to June 2003 (post-Bretton Woods period), covering the managed- and free-floating regimes in Indonesia, the real exchange rates were tested for their mean-reverting properties. A large number of studies found the real exchange series to be mean-averting and persistent, creating PPP puzzles. Using the linear framework many attempted to resolve these puzzles unsuccessfully. Motivated by the success of recent studies on PPP, applying a non-linear ESTAR to model the <b>adjustment</b> <b>process,</b> we tested for mean-reverting properties of all three real exchange rates for small and large deviations from the long-run equilibrium.

In this paper I analyze Nash-equilibrium tariffs in a two-country model taking account of <b>adjustment</b> <b>processes</b> with special emphasis on the effects of nominal price rigidity and monetary policy. I show that nominal price rigidity induces policy makers with a short planning horizon to set lower tariffs because it enhances the short run boom following a cut in tariffs.

40|$|Thesis (M. A., Education (Higher Education Leadership)) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2010. The {{review of}} {{literature}} for this study explores {{the differences in the}} <b>adjustment</b> <b>process</b> of freshmen who commute to college in contrast to freshmen who live in on campus housing while attending college. The literature that was reviewed for this study consists of how living environments impact a college freshman???s <b>adjustment</b> <b>process</b> as well as other factors that impact a freshman???s <b>adjustment</b> <b>process.</b> In the review of the literature several key themes were addressed such as transition, involvement, sense of belonging, and social adjustment. Statement of Problem This thesis is a quantitative study exploring the differences in the <b>adjustment</b> <b>process</b> of freshmen college students who commute in contrast to the <b>adjustment</b> <b>process</b> of college freshmen who live in the residence halls at a small, private university. This study explores the effects of adjustment and living environments on retention. This study was completed at Jones University located in the Sacramento Valley of California. The study consisted of two surveys which were distributed at Jones University to freshmen. Sources of Data The literature which was reviewed for this study looks at major factors affecting the <b>adjustment</b> <b>process</b> for college freshmen. Those factors consist of transition, involvement, social adjustment, sense of belonging, and living environments. The literature review also explores how these factors mentioned above affect not only college freshmen as a whole, but also college freshmen who commute to campus and college freshmen who live in the residence halls. Conclusions Reached This study concluded that the factors that affect the freshman <b>adjustment</b> <b>process</b> which were researched in the literature such as transition, involvement, social adjustment, sense of belonging and living environments all play a large role in the adjustment of both commuter students and residential students. Differences were seen in their overall involvement in campus activities as well as how often commuter students and residential students interacted with faculty. The conclusion was also drawn that there was not {{a significant difference in the}} overall adjustment of the freshmen who commuted to campus at Jones University and the freshman who lived in on- campus housing.
