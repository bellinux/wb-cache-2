2500|$|The main {{themes of}} One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich are totalitarian oppression and camp [...] [...] Specifically {{discussed}} are the prison officials' cruelty and spite towards their fellow man. Solzhenitsyn explains through Ivan Denisovich {{that everything is}} managed by the camp commandant {{to the point that}} time feels unnoticed; the prisoners always <b>have</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> and never have any free time to discuss important issues.|$|E
2500|$|Following the {{aftermath}} of the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, Councilwoman Helen Gym posted on Twitter, [...] "All around the country, we're fighting to remove the monuments to slavery & racism. Philly, we <b>have</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> Take the Rizzo statue down". Gym's comments started a public debate {{about the future of the}} Rizzo statue and mural. Mayor Jim Kenney was open to the possibility, stating that [...] "it is time to discuss the future" [...] of the monument. The Philadelphia Green Party also made a similar call for the removal of his statue. On Nov. 4, 2017, Mayor Kenney announced that the statue will be relocated.|$|E

6000|$|I {{thought it}} was now time to end the scene, which was {{becoming}} too comically grave, so I went towards the door, simply saying, [...] "Come, my friends, we <b>have</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> Goodnight." ...|$|E

60|$|While {{they were}} talking they {{had gone out of}} the tent, and Ben started at once towards the crowd around the wagon, for he knew there was no reason why so many men should be there when they <b>had</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> elsewhere.|$|R

And yet----" [...] he added musingly.|$|R
6000|$|... "You give me {{credit for}} greater powers of divination than I possess," [...] I {{answered}} calmly. [...] "Your father {{was always very}} kind to me, and I {{can assure you that}} I have not forgotten it. But I <b>have</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> now, and I have scarcely an hour to spare. Mr. Moyat would understand it, I am sure." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mine {{is not a}} purposeless exile--nor {{altogether}} {{an unhappy}} one--now," [...] I said. [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> Lady Angela, and I am going to it with a good heart. When we meet again I hope {{that it may be}} differently.

60|$|A little {{rain had}} fallen during the night, as I {{discovered}} upon waking; still {{it was not}} enough to cause me any discomfort.

6000|$|... "We <b>have</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> señor. In {{the first}} place we must find a spot where large trees stand {{on the bank of}} the torrent.

60|$|The {{next day}} Abner {{seemed to be}} a changed man. He <b>had</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> but he {{neglected}} it. Never had such a thing happened before! For hours he sat in front of the house, looking up into the sky, counting one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. Then he would twist himself around on the little bench, and count seven more.|$|R
6000|$|The {{officers}} laughed heartily at my companion's views, {{and rose}} from their chairs, for the bottle {{was empty and}} the evening beginning to draw in. 'We <b>have</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> here,' said the one addressed as Ogilvy. 'Besides, we must find this foolish boy of ours, {{and tell him that}} it is no disgrace to be disarmed by so expert a swordsman.

60|$|The {{camp was}} now {{thoroughly}} roused, and the trappers set about making preparations for a start; but little was said. It is generally {{the case at}} early morning--at least among healthy men who <b>have</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> before breakfast in the wilderness--that tongues are disinclined to move. After the first somewhat outrageous and rather unusual burst, no one spoke again, while they carried their goods down to the water's edge, except in a short grumpy way when an order or a remark was needful. In about ten minutes after the utterance of Big Waller's roar, {{they were in their}} places in the little red canoe, paddling blithely up the river.|$|E

60|$|But he was {{too much}} of an artist to overdo the thing. Tony's next over passed off without interference. Possibly, however, this was because it was a very bad one.
