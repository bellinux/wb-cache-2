5|$|As {{investigation}} and planning work continued, the Corps of Engineers {{reached an agreement}} with the Department of the <b>Interior,</b> the parent agency of the Bureau of Reclamation, in March 1962. The agreement stated the Corps would have responsibility for design and construction of the project, while the <b>Interior</b> Department would be responsible for running and maintaining the dam after completion. In the planning stages, the <b>Interior</b> Department also would be responsible for examining the economic feasibility of the project and its effect upon natural resources. This agreement negated much of the work of the REAB to that point, as the <b>Interior</b> Department promptly began its own three-year study of the dam's economic feasibility and environmental impact. The DRC report, though trumped by the <b>Interior</b> Department's new precedence in such matters, nevertheless released a report in April 1962, stating that the project was economically feasible and would attract new industries to Alaska. Meanwhile, the Corps of Engineers continued engineering studies.|$|E

40|$|Historic <b>interiors</b> are an {{integral}} component to the historic fabric of our communities, yet the protection of <b>interiors</b> is fodder for debate among preservationists as to whether <b>interiors</b> are afforded equal protection as exteriors. This debate arises because <b>interiors</b> present unique challenges, namely, issues of public access, designation of publicly versus privately owned interiors,and infringement on Fifth Amendment rights. This thesis will examine federal, state, and local government policies, organizations, and laws, and discuss {{their impact on the}} protection of historic <b>interiors.</b> Five seminal court cases that examine legal precedents for designating <b>interiors</b> will also be addressed. Finally, case studies provide examples of how two communities have used local preservation laws to preserve and protect significant <b>interiors</b> in their cities.

5|$|The church {{featured}} ample {{exterior and}} <b>interior</b> decoration.
