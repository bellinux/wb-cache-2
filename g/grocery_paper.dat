40|$|Food {{played an}} {{important}} part in the material culture of English elites, not least through the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, when an ever wider range of novel and exotic foods became available. Goods such as sugar and tea brought with them new social practices and new material goods through which these practices were articulated. Whilst we know a lot about the spread of these goods and material cultures through the middling sorts, less attempt has been made to assess how the elite purchased and consumed these imported <b>groceries.</b> This <b>paper</b> will explore the consumption patterns of such foods amongst a small sample of elite families. I will draw upon account books, recipe books, diaries and inventories to examine what was bought, how it was consumed and in what contexts. I argue that these novel consumables were linked to a changing material culture, but that this was interpreted by the elite in ways which allowed them to maintain their social distinction, for example through the quality of the material goods and the production of elaborate meals...|$|R

For women, in warm, cool and neutral colour environment the dominant influence on repurchase intentions is exploring the store environment. For men, in both warm and cool colour environment communication with sales personnel influences their repurchase intentions. The research contributes to the existing body of knowledge on the influence of colours on repurchase intentions in the context of South-East European culture.

Gorrell and Foulois worked together on preparation of a budget proposal to Congress for expansion of the Aviation Section. Using ordinary <b>grocery</b> wrapping <b>paper,</b> Gorrell prepared large charts breaking down the appropriations needed to fund expansion as a briefing aid for the Chief Signal Officer, Brig. Gen.

40|$|Developing an {{open process}} for the {{purchase}} of a software system is a challenging and time-consuming task. Software is a rather unique procurement; the foodservice department is not seeking a relatively inexpensive item or a commonly purchased consumable supply, such as milk, <b>groceries</b> or <b>paper</b> goods. Rather, this is a “big ticket ” purchase that should effectively enable the district to run a more efficient foodservice operation for a number of years. The district needs to select a vendor and the system that meets and/or exceeds its current and future needs at a price it can afford. Individuals responsible for “public purchases ” are more visible and subject to scrutiny than those in private firms. Federal, state and most local laws can be summarized as follows: • Maintain open and free competition. • Maintain comparability of products and price comparisons. • Document the decision-making process. • Develop a procurement plan that is approved by the governing authority, such as the board of education. Often, the easiest way for a district to create a software RFP or bid is to use specifications from a specific vendor. The district should avoid this practice for the following reasons...|$|R

During these workshops, the students have conceptualized ideas and designs for different solutions. Based on their results, I have created a prototype design that I call the SmartCart.

This screen then delivers easily apprehensible information about different grocery products environmental impact in real time. The design has not been tested in a live environment, but initial testing indicates that a live application could give satisfying results in lowering the sales of grocery products with a high environmental impact, while the design also could simultaneously improve the shopping experience for the customers in the grocery store...|$|R

40|$|Research {{on welfare}} {{participation}} has traditionally grouped {{the costs associated}} with participation together, labeling these costs welfare stigma. Recent work has focused on decomposing this aggregated utility cost into time and psychological costs {{in a way that is}} meaningful to policymakers. This paper contributes to this recent literature by further decomposing the psychological cost of welfare participation into “external” and “internal ” components. Identification of the “external ” component comes from the recent adoption of the electronic benefit transfer (EBT) system which changed how food stamp benefits are used in the transaction for food, making the use of food stamps unobservable to others at the <b>grocery</b> store. This <b>paper</b> uses a sample of female-headed households in the SIPP to estimate these two components of psychological costs as well as time costs in a simple structural model using a simulated maximum likelihood method.

40|$|Food wastage is a {{major problem}} in the world today. Previous {{research}} on the subject has however paid little attention to how the creation of a novel waste prevention product can contribute to addressing the environmental challenges of food waste. This paper mitigates these shortcomings by illustrating how a novel waste prevention product is created and becomes a sustainability object that supports a more sustainable way of living. Based on a field study from Swedish <b>grocery</b> stores, this <b>paper</b> demonstrates how the novel waste prevention product gains momentum from being linked to different contexts, how its development depends on physical artifacts, and requires the reconstruction of the existing action net. The paper further illustrates that there is a relationship between sustainability objects, action nets, and standards, since the novel waste prevention product acts as a sustainability object that creates contradictions and paradoxes that question institutions and standards. Trough that, the creation of a novel waste prevention product leads to the construction of more sustainable action nets and categories. MSc in Managemen...|$|R

40|$|This thesis applies a {{relatively}} new technique, laboratory experimental auctions, to examine consumer preferences for food products which have not yet reached the market. The auction used is a second-price (Vickrey) auction in which the highest bidder pays an amount equal to the second-highest bid. This auction {{has been shown to}} accurately reveal preferences because it eliminates the incentive to underbid true value which is present in a first-price auction;The experimental auction is used to examine preferences for two products; milk from cows treated with bovine somatotropin, and pork treated with irradiation. The applications feature real products, real money, and an explicit obligation to consume a food product. These features provide for elicitation of preferences in a non-hypothetical setting; the idea is to replicate the consumers decision environment when first faced with these new products in the <b>grocery</b> store;The three <b>papers</b> use experimental auctions to examine: (1) the relationship between preferences for irradiated pork as revealed in a hypothetical survey and those revealed in the non-hypothetical experimental auction, (2) the impact of favorable and unfavorable descriptions of food irradiation on preferences for irradiated pork, and (3) regional differences in preferences for milk produced with or without bovine somatotropin, and the impact of a detailed description of bovine somatotropin on preferences...|$|R
40|$|Declining populations {{over the}} past several decades have created issues for {{residents}} in many rural areas. A serious concern is the emergence of “food deserts,” areas where people do not have sufficient access to nutritious foods. The Sandhills region in west-central Nebraska is a prime example of an area that is subject to the food desert phenomenon. It features a low-density rural population that creates a difficult economic environment for <b>grocery</b> retailers. This <b>paper</b> looks at multiple aspects of the food desert issue in the region. It begins by reviewing literature to determine the definition of the term “food desert” and the health outcomes for residents with limited access. The origins of the Sandhills food desert are analyzed by connecting the historical and modern economic factors that have contributed to its existence. A strategy for visually analyzing the Sandhills food desert is developed, and a field survey of grocery stores is completed to measure nutritious food availability in Sandhills grocery stores. Historical and current data are then analyzed to develop a series of “warning signs” that an area is at risk for becoming a food desert. These warning signs are applied to the Sandhills region to identify at-risk areas. An inventory of federal, state, and local programs that attempt to address the food desert issue is then completed, and a comprehensive Nebraska food desert program is proposed...|$|R
