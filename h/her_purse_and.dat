5|$|At {{approximately}} 8:00pm on 19 December 2010, Reardon {{returned home}} from a weekend visit to Sheffield to find Yeates absent from their flat on Canynge Road, Clifton. Reardon {{had been trying to}} contact her by phone and text, but without success. While awaiting Yeates' return, Reardon called her again, but her mobile phone rang from a pocket of her coat, which was still in the flat. He found that <b>her</b> <b>purse</b> <b>and</b> keys were also at the flat, and that their cat appeared to have been neglected. Shortly after half past midnight, Reardon contacted the police and Yeates' parents to report her missing.|$|E
5|$|Though Green was {{caring for}} Farrar {{in the family}} home while he {{recovered}} from his repeated bouts of illness, she was also continuing to drink heavily and, increasingly often, claiming to be contemplating suicide or to want Margaret Hacker dead. In late September, Farrar searched the house and her belongings. In her purse, he discovered seed packets labeled as castor beans, {{a copy of a}} supposedly-anonymous letter that had been sent to Farrar urging him to not divorce Green, and empty vials of potassium chloride. He removed all three items from <b>her</b> <b>purse</b> <b>and</b> hid them.|$|E
5|$|Facing {{accumulated}} debts (including {{payments for}} her property in Auburn), Tubman fell prey in 1873 to a swindle involving gold transfer. Two men, one named Stevenson {{and the other}} John Thomas, claimed to have in their possession a cache of gold smuggled out of South Carolina. They offered this treasure – worth about US$5,000, they claimed – for US$2,000 in cash. They insisted that they knew a relative of Tubman's, and she took them into her home, where they stayed for several days. She knew that white people in the South had buried valuables when Union forces threatened the region, and also that black men were frequently assigned to digging duties. Thus the situation seemed plausible, and a combination of her financial woes and her good nature led her {{to go along with}} the plan. She borrowed the money from a wealthy friend named Anthony Shimer, and arranged to receive the gold late one night. Once the men had lured her into the woods, however, they attacked her and knocked her out with chloroform, then stole <b>her</b> <b>purse</b> <b>and</b> bound and gagged her. When she was found by her family, she was dazed and injured, and the money was gone.|$|E

5|$|Whitney {{decides to}} give Lee another chance on the {{condition}} that he will never assault her again, therefore he should seek anger management therapy. Lee gratefully accepts for the sake of their marriage. However, on Valentine's Day, Lee leaves Whitney, leaving a handwritten note on their bed saying he no longer loves her. He returns the following day, apologising to Whitney for his actions and tells her of his plans to move to Dover. An upset Whitney, realising that Lee plans to leave on his own to figure himself out, tells him to leave and she watches him from the window as he drives off. Whitney becomes closer to Mick in Linda's absence and is warned by Shirley to stay away from him. When Mick leaves to look after Nancy when she is hit by a car Whitney is left in charge of running the pub. She later steals Vincent Hubbard's (Richard Blackwood) credit card to pay for a dog pen for Lady Di (Hot Lips), as the Carters cannot afford it due to their debts. Whitney later grows close to new bar manager Woody Woodward (Lee Ryan). Lee attempts to call Whitney but Woody tells Lee that she does not want to speak to him, so Lee sends his friend Moose (Sam Gittins) to see her, who says that Lee wants a divorce. Whitney receives a letter from Lee's solicitor, citing her unreasonable behaviour as grounds for the divorce, but Woody tells her it is not a big deal. Whitney declares that she is going to move on with her life and goes out shopping, but Woody sees she has not taken <b>her</b> <b>purse</b> <b>and</b> goes to give it to her. Whitney is caught shoplifting by a security guard, who offers her sex in exchange for not calling the police. Woody arrives and punches the guard, and takes Whitney home. Whitney and Woody kiss and have sex, and then a returning Mick finds them in bed together. Mick finds more items that Whitney has shoplifted, and she says she should never have married Lee as she is damaged and only good for sex but he tells her she is wrong and promises not to leave again. Mick lashes out at Whitney after learning that Linda and Shirley sold the freehold of the Vic without his knowledge to pay for an operation for Lady Di. A few days later, Whitney is depressed and vulnerable and, when Mick kisses her, she responds. When Shirley finds out about the kiss, she orders Whitney to get out, telling her that Mick would never choose her over Linda. Devastated, Whitney leaves Walford.|$|E
25|$|The {{night before}} her disappearance, Grinstead visited a beauty pageant (she was active {{as a coach}} to young beauty contestants) and {{attended}} a barbecue. On October 24, 2005, a Monday morning, she {{did not show up}} for work. Co-workers called police, who went to the home where she lived alone. They found her cell phone inside the house. Her car was outside, unlocked. <b>Her</b> <b>purse</b> <b>and</b> keys were gone.|$|E
25|$|On September 27, 1996 Karyn left work at 5 p.m. {{with the}} intent to pick up her son Christopher and then shop for a dress at the Hickory Point Mall in Forsyth, Illinois. Later that night a black Pontiac Bonneville was {{discovered}} in central Illinois on westbound I-72 with its engine still running, its headlights on, and the driver's side door open. The car was reported to be registered to David Swann, Karyn's boyfriend, but contained some of Karyn's personal effects including <b>her</b> <b>purse</b> <b>and</b> driver's license. Swann reported her as a missing persons and a search campaign was conducted. At this time it was theorized that Karyn could have been the victim of a car-jacking, as investigators did not view her as likely to have voluntarily left the area due to her recently signing with a modeling agency for a job.|$|E

60|$|The other section--chiefly {{consisting}} of agents and spies of the Revolutionary Government--she would gladly have ignored. They had at first made a constant demand on <b>her</b> <b>purse,</b> <b>her</b> talents <b>and</b> her time: then she {{grew tired of}} them, and felt more and more chary of being identified with a set which was in such ill-odour with that very same jeunesse doree whom Candeille had desired to please.|$|R
50|$|According to the arresting officers, {{upon her}} arrest, <b>her</b> phone, <b>purse</b> <b>and</b> money were secured {{in her car}} and her car was towed to a tow yard on the Pacific Coast Highway.

25|$|Many {{survivors}} found {{a temporary}} haven in the First Precinct station house. After a Brooklyn Eagle reporter found her dazed near the Washington Street entrance, Kate Claxton was taken there. Dressed only in thin theatrical garb, she {{huddled in the}} station house. The enormous disaster would occur to her only in small, incongruous pieces. Sitting quietly in Captain Smith's office, she would suddenly mourn for some lost article of clothing, her seal skin sacque or jewelry. Later on, the thought that she had lost <b>her</b> <b>purse</b> <b>and</b> was penniless would haunt her. From time to time people would enter and she would ask them about H. S. Murdoch, the actor {{who had been on}} stage with her during her final minutes inside and who had rushed to his dressing room for outerwear. No one had seen him; she would beseech the person to go look for him. Eventually a waterproof cloak was found for her and she was driven to her rooms at Pierrepoint House.|$|E
500|$|The next morning, Tim is {{visited by}} a {{neighbor}} who warns him that digging for buried items in the backyard {{is a bad idea}} and says that the site was once the [...] "Chicano Hall of Fame". Soon afterwards, Max returns to pick up <b>her</b> <b>purse</b> <b>and</b> finds Tim digging again. She joins him and discovers a plastic bag filled with bones. Meanwhile, Lee goes to visit her sister Squiggy (Melanie Lynskey) and brother-in-law Bob (Ron Livingston) for an afternoon after complaining to her mother that she no longer feels she has an identity outside of being a mother and wife.|$|E
500|$|At the Source Awards, Tracy {{still does}} not want to host. Jack rhetorically asks him what Oprah would do, but Tracy misunderstands and starts acting like her. Backstage, Tracy shows Liz his gun, which she takes away from him. She fires it by {{accident}} and ends up shooting Steven in the buttocks. He thinks she shot him because he was going through <b>her</b> <b>purse</b> <b>and</b> calls her a racist. Following this, Ridikolous comes in and says that Jack has made a mockery of the award, adding: [...] "Wait until I tell Tupac about this!". This leads to a short awkward moment, but Jack insists he did not hear anything.|$|E
60|$|This was not {{language}} befitting {{the man who}} had preached of {{the sanctity}} of work.

500|$|In {{the days}} before Selena's death, Saldívar delayed handing over the bank {{statements}} and financial records by saying she had been physically and sexually assaulted in Mexico. Saldívar, along with Selena, appeared at a medical clinic on March 31, 1995, ostensibly to have Saldívar examined for an assault which she claimed happened to her in Monterrey. During that visit, Saldívar was given a brief physical examination by the clinic's doctor, but this {{did not include a}} gynecological exam specifically done in cases of sexual assault. It was suggested by nurse Carla Anthony that Saldívar needed to have the rape exam in San Antonio for three reasons: Saldívar was a resident of San Antonio, the clinic they were currently at was in Corpus Christi, and the assault occurred in Mexico. Afterwards, Selena again met with Saldívar in her hotel room at the Days Inn in Corpus Christi. At the hotel, Selena demanded the financial papers. At 11:48a.m. (CST), Saldívar got a gun from <b>her</b> <b>purse</b> <b>and</b> pointed it at Selena. As Selena attempted to flee, Saldívar shot her once on the right lower shoulder, severing an artery and causing a severe loss of blood. Critically wounded, Selena ran towards the lobby, leaving a -long trail of blood. She collapsed on the floor as the clerk called the emergency services, with Saldívar still chasing after her and calling her a [...] "bitch". Before collapsing, Selena named Saldívar as her assailant and gave the number of the room where she had been shot. Meanwhile, Saldívar attempted to leave in her pickup truck. She was, however, spotted by a responding police cruiser. She surrendered after a nearly nine-and-a-half-hour standoff with police and the FBI. By that time, hundreds of fans had gathered at the scene; many wept as police took Saldívar away.|$|E

2500|$|The {{experiences}} of Brandi Byrd illustrate another problematic case. Byrd {{was out with}} {{a friend who was}} charged with DUI. Byrd gave the police permission to search <b>her</b> <b>purse,</b> <b>and</b> two darvocet pills were found. She explained that her mother had given them to her after minor surgery and she had forgotten about them, but she was charged with two felonies, one for each pill. After sitting in jail for six days, Byrd went to court. The public defender and the drug court counselors told her if she didn't agree to drug court, she would go to prison.|$|E
2500|$|Burton Wilbur Abbott (February 8, 1928 [...] March 15, 1957) was a University of California at Berkeley {{accounting}} student {{living in}} Alameda, California, who was tried for {{the rape and}} murder of 14-year-old Stephanie Bryan in November 1955. Although the evidence against him was entirely circumstantial, including Stephanie's body found buried near Abbott's upstate cabin and <b>her</b> <b>purse</b> <b>and</b> ID found in the basement of his home, he was convicted and sentenced to death in California's gas chamber. On March 15, 1957 a (second) one hour stay of execution from the governor of California was communicated to the prison just moments too late to halt his execution, which had already begun.|$|E

2500|$|In 1984, Albano met {{pop singer}} Cyndi Lauper {{on a plane}} flight from Puerto Rico. Her manager, David Wolff, {{suggested}} that the two collaborate on a project {{at some point in}} the future. In 1984, the opportunity came when Lauper's video for [...] "Girls Just Want to Have Fun" [...] needed an actor to play the singer's father, and Albano was suggested. Initially reluctant, he was convinced by his wife to agree, and Lauper and Albano thereafter formed a lifelong friendship. [...] He appeared in several of her music videos and she appeared on Roddy Piper's [...] "Piper's Pit" [...] program to discuss the collaboration. Albano, in character, began denigrating Lauper and women in general and claimed to have written all her songs and been the only reason for her success. Lauper, in turn, assaulted Albano with <b>her</b> <b>purse,</b> <b>and</b> the two agreed to settle their differences in the ring.|$|E
