40|$|A {{retrospective}} analysis {{was made of}} the incidence and severity of the idiopathic respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) <b>in</b> <b>babies</b> of less than 35 weeks' gestation born at this hospital from January 1967 -December 1974. There was a lower incidence of RDS <b>in</b> <b>babies</b> born after pregnancies complicated only by prolonged rupture of membranes (PRM) (19 %) and <b>in</b> <b>babies</b> born vaginally after pregnancies complicated only by pre-eclamptic toxaemia (PET) (18 %) compared with the incidence of RDS after uncomplicated pregnancies (35 %). Babies born vaginally who developed RDS after pregnancies complicated by PRM or PET had less severe disease compared with those who developed RDS after uncomplicated pregnancies. Mortality <b>in</b> <b>babies</b> who developed severe RDS was not influenced by the occurrence of PRM or PET.

In another departure from post Code films, Stanwyck's sole companion for the duration of the picture is a black woman named Chico (Theresa Harris), whom she took with her when she ran away from home at age 14.|$|E

5|$|Toothache is {{the most}} common type of {{orofacial}} pain and, when severe, it is considered a dental emergency, since there may be a significant impact on sleep, eating, and other daily activities. It is one of the most common reasons for emergency dental appointments. Correct diagnosis can sometimes be challenging. The treatment of a toothache depends upon the exact cause, and may involve a filling, root canal treatment, extraction, drainage of pus, or other remedial action. The relief of toothache is considered one of the main responsibilities of dentists. In 2013, 223 million cases of tooth pain occurred as a result of dental caries in permanent teeth and 53 million cases occurred <b>in</b> <b>baby</b> teeth. Historically, the demand for treatment of toothache is thought to have led to the emergence of dental surgery as the first specialty of medicine.|$|E
