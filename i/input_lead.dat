Specifically we introduce an additional term to allow for an external input. This allows these models to be utilized for system identification tasks. By imposing a minor restriction on the Lyapunov functions constructed in Cohen (1992), we prove that this extended model is stable in the sense that a bounded <b>input</b> <b>leads</b> to a bounded state.

We indicate that although the Aharonov-Bohm oscillations and the Lorentz force effects co-exist in the low subband transport, for higher Fermi energies a simultaneous observation of the both effects is difficult and calls for carefully formed structures. In particular, in quantum rings with channels wider than the <b>input</b> <b>lead</b> the Lorentz force is well resolved but the Aharonov-Bohm periodicity is lost in chaotic scattering events. In quantum rings with equal length of the channels and $T$-shaped junctions the Aharonov-Bohm oscillations are distinctly periodic but the Lorentz force effects are not well pronounced.

40|$|Abstract. In {{our earlier}} work, {{we found that}} feature space induced by tactile {{receptive}} fields (TRFs) are better than that by visual receptive fields (VRFs) in texture boundary detection tasks. This suggests that TRFs could be intimately associated with texture-like input. In this paper, we investigate how TRFs can develop in a cortical learning context. Our main hypothesis is that TRFs can be self-organized using the same cortical development mechanism found in the visual cortex, simply by exposing it to texture-like inputs (as opposed to natural-scene-like inputs). To test our hypothesis, we used the LISSOM model of visual cortical development. Our main results show that texture-like <b>inputs</b> <b>lead</b> to the self-organization of TRFs while natural-scene-like <b>inputs</b> <b>lead</b> to VRFs. These results suggest that TRFs can better represent texture than VRFs. We further analyzed the effectiveness of TRFs in representing texture, using kernel Fisher discriminant (KFD) and the results, along with texture classification performance, confirm that this is indeed the case. We expect these results to help us better {{understand the nature of}} texture, as a fundamentally tactile property. ...|$|R

40|$|We study {{a device}} for {{entangling}} electrons as cotunneling occurs through a quantum dot where on-site electron-electron interactions U are in place.

The model filters singlet entangled pairs with the sole requirement of Pauli principle.

30|$|Over {{the past}} 30  years, {{the concept of}} foreign {{language}} anxiety (FLA) has received much attention from many scholars and theorists {{in the domain of}} foreign language and communication studies (Park 2014). The FLA concept is thought to be related to an individual’s affective filter, as introduced by Dulay and Burt (1977) and then developed by Krashen (1982), who focused on the process of an individual’s second language (L 2) acquisition. Krashen (1985) argued that comprehensible input and a state of the affective filter that allows the <b>input</b> <b>lead</b> to L 2 acquisition. This filter is typically activated by a variety of psychological affective variables such as motivation, attitudes, self-confidence, and anxiety (Krashen 1981). The filter thereby serves a crucial psychological function through which to facilitate or hinder the processing and reception of input in the course of L 2 acquisition. It seems obvious that FLA lies within the affective filter when highlighting a learning context of foreign languages.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} a new {{solution}} is proposed for testing simple stwo stage electronic circuits. It minimizes {{the number of}} {{tests to be performed}} to determine the genuinity of the circuit. The main idea behind the present research work is to identify the maximum number of indistinguishable faults present in the given circuit and minimize the number of test cases {{based on the number of}} faults that has been detected. Heuristic approach is used for test minimization part, which identifies the essential tests from overall test cases. From the results it is observed that, test minimization varies from 50 % to 99 % with the lowest one corresponding to a circuit with four gates. Test minimization is low in case of circuits with lesser <b>input</b> <b>leads</b> in gates compared to greater <b>input</b> <b>leads</b> in gates for the boolean expression with same number of symbols. Achievement of 99 % reduction is due to the fact that the large number of tests find the same faults. The new approach is implemented for simple circuits. The results show potential for both smaller test sets and lower cpu times. Comment: PDF 9 pages, 2 figures, 2 table...|$|R
