"James while John <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> {{a better}} {{effect on the}} teacher" [...] is an English {{sentence}} used to demonstrate lexical ambiguity {{and the necessity of}} punctuation,which serves as a substitute for the intonation, stress, and pauses found in speech.In human information processing research, the sentence <b>has</b> been used to show how readers depend on punctuation to give sentences meaning, especially in the context of scanning across lines of text. The sentence is sometimes presented as a puzzle, where the solver must add the punctuation.|$|R

6000|$|The house, {{though a}} little disorderly in {{comparison}} with the garden, was a real old house with settles in the chimney of the brick-floored kitchen and great beams across the ceilings. On one side of it was the terrible piece of ground in dispute, where Mr. Boythorn maintained a sentry in a smock-frock day and night, whose duty was supposed to be, in cases of aggression, immediately to ring a large bell hung up there for the purpose, to unchain a great bull-dog established in a kennel as his ally, and generally to deal destruction on the enemy. Not content with these precautions, Mr. Boythorn had himself composed and posted there, on painted boards to which his name was attached in large letters, the following solemn warnings: [...] "Beware of the bull-dog. He is most ferocious. Lawrence Boythorn." [...] "The blunderbus is loaded with slugs. Lawrence Boythorn." [...] "Man-traps and spring-guns are set here at all times of the day and night. Lawrence Boythorn." [...] "Take notice. That any person or persons audaciously presuming to trespass on this property will be punished with the utmost severity of private chastisement and prosecuted with the utmost rigour of the law. Lawrence Boythorn." [...] These he showed us from the drawing-room window, while his bird was hopping about his head, and he laughed, [...] "Ha <b>ha</b> <b>ha</b> <b>ha!</b> <b>Ha</b> <b>ha</b> <b>ha</b> ha!" [...] to that extent as he pointed them out that I really thought he would have hurt himself.|$|E

At the end of the year, she had a total of 3 nominations(one of which was [...] "Passion" [...] from her last album) from the Jade Solid Gold season awards. [...] "Grey", the classic dance track, won Sandy one award in both the Jade Solid Gold and RTHK year end awards presentation. Other singles such as [...] "Family Man" [...] and [...] "Grey Make-up" [...] received mediocre airplay. [...] "Grey" [...] was so successful and commercial mainly because of the first single, which is obviously the title track, is a rare Eurodance in 1987 and has the classic catchy phrase-Ha <b>Ha</b> <b>Ha</b> <b>Ha</b> <b>Ha</b> <b>Ha</b> <b>Ha...</b> "Grey" [...] was clearly intended to appeal to wider audiences through different musical genres and a concept in context with the audience.|$|E
5000|$|Old Bridge Township Raceway Park, {{originally}} {{known as}} Madison Township Raceway Park, is an American auto racing facility located at Old Bridge Township, New Jersey (with an Englishtown ZIP code), in the New York metropolitan area.

6000|$|All {{observers}} {{testify to}} the prodigious volume of voice possessed by these animals.

[...] While the cry is being uttered, the great membranous bag under the throat which communicates with the organ of voice, the so-called [...] "laryngeal sac," [...] becomes greatly distended, diminishing again when the creature relapses into silence.|$|R
5000|$|Bob Berryhill, Pat Connolly, Jim Fuller and Ron Wilson {{wrote the}} tune almost on the spot, as a {{suitable}} B-side {{was needed for}} the intended [...] "Surfer Joe" [...] single. In late 1962, while the band was in Cucamonga's Pal Recording Studio recording the single, one of the band members suggested that during the introduction before the music starts, a cracking sound, imitating a breaking surfboard, should be made. This followed by a manic voice babbling, [...] "ha <b>ha</b> <b>ha</b> <b>ha</b> <b>ha,</b> wipe out." [...] The spoken voice {{at the beginning of}} the song is the voice of the band's manager at the time, Dale Smallin.|$|R

[...] She glances at the paper again, and breaks into a hysterical laugh: [...] "Ah, <b>ha,</b> <b>ha,</b> <b>ha,</b> <b>ha!</b> Why, this is the address that I wrote out for that young gentleman's flowers! You <b>have</b> made a terrible mistake, Mr. Eichenlaub--you <b>have</b> almost killed me.

5000|$|Each of {{the evil}} rings has malevolent faces on them, in {{contrast}} to the more element-themed Planeteer rings. Captain Pollution is weakened when he is in contact with pure elements such as clean water or sunlight, while he gains power from contact with pollutants, being able to absorb pollutant and emit radioactive rays (and is later shown to gain power without limit when in contact with pollutants after his resurrection). When he is summoned he says [...] "By your polluting powers combined, I am Captain Pollution! <b>Ha!</b> <b>Ha!</b> <b>Ha!</b> <b>Ha!</b> <b>Ha!</b> Ha!", and when he disappears, he declares [...] "The polluting power is yours!" ...|$|E
5000|$|Right after Jacque openly states how {{dangerous}} he is, Bugs convinces Jacque that there's {{a man in}} the rumpus room who claims to be twice as dangerous.

Just as Jacque pulls out the cork ("Ha <b>ha</b> <b>ha</b> <b>ha</b> <b>ha</b> <b>ha,</b> a popgun! Well, Monsieur Dumb Guy, I'm gonna pull your cork!"), the gun blasts him in the face. In a classic Bugs Bunny trick (similar to one he pulled in Ballot Box Bunny), Bugs then pretends to have a phone call for Jacque from [...] "Fifi from Montreal" [...] - with the receiver being a lighted stick of dynamite. Jacque takes the bait and the dynamite explodes, swooning [...] "Ohh ... that Fifi ... she's a blast." ...|$|E
60|$|It is true that, by {{the side}} of the self-devotion and public spirit, the vices and meannesses of troubled times <b>have</b> shown themselves, as they will and must. We <b>have</b> <b>had</b> shoddy, we <b>have</b> <b>had</b> contracts, we <b>have</b> <b>had</b> substitute-brokerage, we <b>have</b> <b>had</b> speculators in patriotism, and, still worse, in {{military}} notoriety. Men <b>have</b> striven to make the blood of our martyrs the seed of wealth or office. But in times of public and universal extremity, when habitual standards of action no longer serve, and ordinary currents of thought are swamped in the flood of enthusiasm or excitement, it always happens that the evil passions of some men are stimulated by what serves only to exalt the nobler qualities of others. In such epochs, evil as well as good is exaggerated. A great social convulsion shakes up the lees which underlie society, forgotten because quiescent, and the stimulus of calamity brings out the extremes of human nature, whether for good or evil.|$|R

5000|$|For the {{syntactic}} {{structure to}} be clear to a reader, this sentence requires, at a minimum, that the two phrases be separated by using a semicolon, period, en-dash or em-dash. Still, Jasper Fforde's novel The Well of Lost Plots employs {{a variation of the}} phrase to illustrate the confusion that may arise even from well-punctuated writing: [...] "Okay" [...] said the Bellman, whose head was in danger of falling apart like a chocolate orange, [...] "let me get this straight: David Copperfield, unlike Pilgrim’s Progress, which <b>had</b> <b>had</b> 'had', <b>had</b> <b>had</b> 'had had'.
