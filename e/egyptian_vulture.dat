5|$|Also like Bewick, many {{articles}} {{end with}} a tail-piece, a small engraving, but here again Yarrell shows himself to be both more serious and less merely decorative than Bewick, with more information to impart. The <b>Egyptian</b> <b>vulture</b> article ends with a large and accurate engraving of another specimen, so the article shows both a young and an old bird, with clearly different plumage which is also described in the text.|$|E
5|$|Strandzha is {{situated}} on Via Pontica, the second-largest bird migratory route in Europe. The bays and estuaries along the Black Sea coast are a wintering destination for some birds. There are 269 avian {{species in the}} park, including populations of global importance of white-backed woodpecker, semi-collared flycatcher, olive-tree warbler and sombre tit, as well as populations of European importance of <b>Egyptian</b> <b>vulture,</b> white stork, black stork, Eurasian eagle owl and four eagle species.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Egyptian</b> <b>vulture</b> (Neophron percnopterus), {{also called}} the white {{scavenger}} vulture or pharaoh's chicken, is a small Old World vulture and {{the only member of}} the genus Neophron. It is widely distributed; the <b>Egyptian</b> <b>vulture</b> is found from southwestern Europe and northern Africa to India. The contrasting underwing pattern and wedge-shaped tail make it distinctive in flight as it soars in thermals during the warmer parts of the day. Egyptian vultures feed mainly on carrion but are opportunistic and will prey on small mammals, birds, and reptiles. They also feed on the eggs of other birds, breaking larger ones by tossing a large pebble onto them. The use of tools is rare in birds and apart from the use of a pebble as a hammer, Egyptian vultures also use twigs to roll up wool for use in their nest. Egyptian vultures that breed in the temperate regions migrate south in winter while tropical populations are relatively sedentary. Populations of this species have declined in the 20th century and some island populations are endangered by hunting, accidental poisoning, and collision with power lines.|$|E

5|$|There {{are three}} widely {{recognised}} subspecies of the <b>Egyptian</b> <b>vulture,</b> {{although there is}} considerable gradation due to movement and intermixing of the populations. The nominate subspecies, N. p. percnopterus, has the largest range, occurring in southern Europe, northern Africa, the Middle East, Central Asia, and the north-west of India. Populations breeding in the temperate zone migrate south during winter. It has a dark grey bill.|$|E
5|$|<b>Egyptian</b> <b>vulture</b> {{populations have}} {{declined}} {{in most parts}} of its range. In Europe and most of the Middle East, populations in 2001 were half of those from 1980. In India, the decline has been rapid with a 35% decrease each year since 1999. In 1967–70, the area around Delhi was estimated to have 12,000–15,000 of these vultures, with an average density of about 5 pairs per 10km2. The exact cause of the decline is not known, but has been linked {{with the use of the}} NSAID Diclofenac, which has been known to cause death in Gyps vultures.|$|E

25|$|When an <b>Egyptian</b> <b>vulture</b> (Neophron percnopterus) {{encounters}} a large egg, {{it takes a}} stone into its beak and forcefully throws it at the egg until the shell is broken, usually taking a few minutes. This behaviour, first reported in 1966, seems to be largely innate and is displayed by naïve individuals. Its origin {{could be related to}} the throwing of eggs; rounded (egg-like) stones are preferred to jagged ones.|$|E
25|$|The {{island is}} {{home to one of}} the two {{surviving}} populations of the threatened Canarian <b>Egyptian</b> <b>vulture.</b> It is also inhabited by many wild dogs and cats. On the barren, rocky land there are Barbary ground squirrels and geckos. Fuerteventura also hosts several migratory and nesting birds.

25|$|Birds are {{abundant}} in Egypt, {{especially in the}} Nile Valley and the Delta region. Birds of prey include vultures, eagles, hawks, falcons and owls. Other large birds include storks, flamingoes, herons, egrets, pelicans, quail, sunbirds and golden orioles. About four hundred and eighty species of bird have been recorded, the globally endangered ones being the red-breasted goose, white-headed duck, Balearic shearwater, <b>Egyptian</b> <b>vulture,</b> Rüppell's vulture, sociable lapwing, slender-billed curlew, saker falcon and yellow-breasted bunting. Egypt is on a major bird migratory route between Eurasia and East Africa and around two hundred species of migrants pass through twice a year.|$|E
25|$|Tymfi {{holds the}} largest {{recorded}} population of Balkan chamois deer (Rupicapra rupicapra balcanica) in Greece, {{with a population}} between 120-130 individuals out of an estimated national population between 477-750. Although chamois is registered as least concern in IUCN's red list, the subspecies balcanica numbers some thousands of individuals and its populations {{are believed to be}} declining. According to the Hellenic Ornithological Society mount Tymfi along with the neighbouring mountain Smolikas are important regions for breeding birds of prey, alpine and forest dwelling bird species. The <b>Egyptian</b> <b>vulture,</b> short-toed snake eagle, rufous-tailed rock-thrush breed in the region, whereas species such as the golden eagle, red-billed chough, rock partridge, alpine chough, wallcreeper, white-winged snowfinch and the alpine accentor are sedentary. Alpine reptilian and amphibian species are also present. Vipera ursinii lives in the mountain's subalpine meadows and is considered a threatened taxon. The amphibian alpine newts (Triturus Alpestris), living in the alpine lakes of the mountain, mostly in and around Drakolimni, are associated with local folktales of dragons and dragon battles. Yellow-bellied toads (Bombina variegata) are also common in that same area.|$|E
25|$|Golden eagles, being {{habitual}} scavengers at carrion, {{come into}} conflict with scavenging birds as well. They may encounter corvids at carrion sites and the large passerines are often highly cautious, either feeding {{some distance from the}} eagle or waiting until the eagle is done eating, lest they be predaceously grabbed. Occasionally, however, corvids may behave more boldly around golden eagles. In one case, a group of three black-billed magpies were observed to rob a golden eagle of its prey. Golden eagles also usually dominate both New World and Old World vultures. Smaller species like black vulture (Coragyps atratus) in North America and <b>Egyptian</b> <b>vulture</b> (Neophron percnopterus) in Eurasia are known to be occasionally hunted by golden eagles. Besides the Steller's sea eagle, the larger species of Old World vulture and the California condor (Gymnogyps californianus) are the only noticeably larger raptorial birds that a golden eagle may encounter. The relationship between these large vultures and golden eagles can be highly contentious, with most sources favoring victory for the eagle due to its more aggressive disposition, much stronger feet and sharp talons. In one case, a colony of griffon vulture (Gyps fulvus) was exceptionally able to displace a pair golden eagles from a cliff where they were trying nest so they could nest there themselves. On the other hand, a 5-year-old griffon vulture reintroduced into the wild in Bulgaria was thought to have been killed by a golden eagle. The golden eagle is a potential predator of the lammergeier which is often attracted to much the same habitat and prey as the eagle but often feeds largely on bone marrow from carcasses. It has been observed that both golden eagles and lammergeiers will readily pirate food away from each other. In the Southwestern United States, several conflicts between huge California condors and golden eagles have been observed. At carrion, victory during conflicts can go either way apparently. Recent observation have suggested that the critically endangered condors do not seem to actively defend their nesting territories from golden eagles but have been recorded gaining incidental protection from prairie falcons and common ravens, which both aggressively displaced the eagles from their own adjacent territories. The golden eagle is considered an occasional predator of California condors (especially fledglings) but there seems to be {{little in the way of}} eyewitness accounts to confirm this. It is possible that (as in the Bulgarian griffon vultures) the California condors have lost their natural cautiousness around eagles due to having been reintroduced from captivity.|$|E
5|$|<b>Egyptian</b> <b>vultures</b> {{are mostly}} silent but make high-pitched mewing or hissing notes at the nest and {{screeching}} noises when squabbling at a carcass. Young birds {{have been heard}} making a hissing croak in flight. They also hiss or growl when threatened or angry.|$|R
50|$|The area is {{particularly}} attractive to bird watchers, {{who come to}} see the lammergeier, griffon <b>vulture</b> and <b>Egyptian</b> <b>vultures,</b> as well as a wide variety of birds of prey. Hunters find plenty of wild boars and deer, as well as partridge and quail.|$|R

500|$|Yarrell broadly {{follows the}} lead of Bewick in {{describing}} each species in a separate section, with essentially no introduction. The first bird, the <b>Egyptian</b> <b>vulture,</b> is preceded by {{nothing more than the}} Index (there is no table of contents) and the heading [...] "British Birds", though there is an introductory paragraph on page 2, inside the <b>Egyptian</b> <b>vulture</b> article. Like Bewick, Yarrell's sections begin with a large wood engraving, depicting the species against a more or less realistic background: that of the <b>Egyptian</b> <b>vulture</b> shows a pyramid and a pair of laden camels. An immediate difference from Bewick is the list of Latin names that follows, with Vultur percnopterus (Bewick), Neophron [...] percnopterus (Selby, Jenyns, Eyton, and Gould), and Cathartes [...] percnopterus (Temminck). This care reflects both the rapidly advancing state of ornithology in the early nineteenth century, and Yarrell's more scientific approach.|$|E
50|$|Krumovitsa River Valley {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} areas in Bulgaria for breeding black storks (Ciconia nigra) and <b>Egyptian</b> <b>vultures</b> (Neophron percnopterus). Other nationally significant populations breeding at site are the short-toed snake eagle (Circaetus gallicus) (1 pair), Eurasian eagle-owl (Bubo bubo) (1-2 pairs) and the olive-tree warbler (Hippolais olivetorum) (2-5 pairs).|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} birds {{are found in}} the {{mountains}} including <b>Egyptian</b> <b>vultures.</b> Mammals include the Dorcas gazelle which is found in the Boura Mountains.

The vegetation changes with altitude, the mountains are covered with desert scrublands at lower elevations, growing richer and then becoming scrubland.|$|R
25|$|Predators of nests {{and young}} common {{ostriches}} include jackals, various birds of prey, warthogs, mongoose and <b>Egyptian</b> <b>vultures.</b> If the nest or young are threatened, {{either or both}} of the parents may create a distraction, feigning injury. However, they may sometimes fiercely fight predators, especially when chicks are being defended, and have been capable of killing even lions in such confrontations.|$|R
500|$|The {{account of}} the first species of each genus, such as the Neophron genus of vultures, {{includes}} a paragraph on [...] "Generic Characters", describing the beak, legs, wings and any distinguishing features useful for identification. These features are often small, requiring examination or measurement of specimens in the hand, reflecting the fact, repeated {{many times in the}} book, that those interested in birds shot them to collect unusual specimens. The <b>Egyptian</b> <b>vulture</b> was recorded from a specimen in Somerset, England, [...] "now in the possession of the Rev. A. Mathew, of Kilve in Somersetshire, [...] was shot near that place in October 1825." [...] The bird was one of a pair, but the other was too wary to be captured. Yarrell then proceeds to describe where the bird can be found, its behaviour and diet, and its detailed appearance. The <b>Egyptian</b> <b>vulture</b> takes up six pages, which is typical; the golden eagle gets eight pages, the hobby only four.|$|E
500|$|The adult <b>Egyptian</b> <b>vulture</b> {{measures}} [...] {{from the}} point of the beak to the extremity of the tail feathers.

500|$|A {{total of}} 121 bird {{species have been}} {{observed}} in the park, with twenty-six of them being considered of conservation priority. The area hosts fifteen raptor species and populations of bird species with limited distribution in Greece, such as the hazel grouse, Tengmalm's owl, wallcreeper and willow tit. The two bird communities that inhabit the subalpine and forest ecosystems are considered among the most complete in Greece: The first community includes species that nest and feed in the subalpine area, like the alpine chough, shore lark, western rock nuthatch and alpine swift, while the second comprises birds of prey like the griffon vulture, <b>Egyptian</b> <b>vulture,</b> peregrine falcon and common kestrel, that search for food in a wider zone.|$|E
50|$|The Sierra de Grazalema, a karstic region, {{contains}} {{a number of}} large limestone caverns, including the Cueva del Gato, the Cueva de la Pileta and the Garganta Verde.The Sierra de Grazalema {{is also home to}} many colonies of vultures, including a few pairs of <b>Egyptian</b> <b>vultures,</b> a species which is seriously threatened.
