5|$|As {{the weather}} synoptics of the {{northern}} Pacific Ocean transitioned into a late-fall to early winter-type pattern, convection from the monsoon trough extended {{to the east of}} the International Date Line. During late November, a westerly disturbance <b>developed</b> <b>into</b> twin troughs {{on opposite sides of the}} equator; the one in the Southern Hemisphere ultimately <b>developed</b> <b>into</b> Tropical Cyclone Pam, while the one in the Northern Hemisphere formed into an area of convection about 2000km (1240mi) southwest of Hawaii. The disturbance gradually organized as it drifted north-northeastward, and on November 28 it <b>developed</b> <b>into</b> Tropical Depression Five-C about 465km (290mi) west-northwest of Palmyra Atoll. Operationally, the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC) did not begin issuing warnings on the system until December 2.|$|E

5|$|A {{cold front}} moved off the East Coast of the United States on July 16 and stalled {{off the coast}} of North Carolina. It {{gradually}} decayed into a surface low pressure trough, and <b>developed</b> <b>into</b> two disturbances; one was centered 290miles (490km) south-southeast of Cape Cod and another was located 200miles (320km) south of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. The first low quickly organized into an unnamed tropical storm, and the other area initially remained broad and ill-defined. However, by July 18, the system became much better organized with improved banding features, and the area <b>developed</b> <b>into</b> Tropical Depression Two while located 220miles (355km) south-southeast of Cape Hatteras.|$|E
50|$|For females, {{the ovaries}} become morphologically visible by the 8th week of gestation. The absence of {{testosterone}} {{results in the}} diminution of the Wolffian structures.

At 16 weeks of gestation, the ovaries produce FSH and LH/hCG receptors. At 20 weeks of gestation, the theca cell precursors are present and oogonia mitosis is occurring. At 25 weeks of gestation, the ovary is morphologically defined and folliculogenesis can begin.|$|R
50|$|In {{flowering}} plants, {{the female}} gametophyte (sometimes {{referred to as}} the embryo sac) has been reduced to just eight cells inside the ovule. The gametophyte cell closest to the micropyle opening of the ovule <b>develops</b> <b>into</b> the egg cell. Upon pollination, a pollen tube delivers sperm into the gametophyte and one sperm nucleus fuses with the egg nucleus. The resulting zygote <b>develops</b> <b>into</b> an embryo inside the ovule. The ovule in turn <b>develops</b> <b>into</b> a seed and in many cases the plant ovary <b>develops</b> <b>into</b> a fruit to facilitate the dispersal of the seeds. Upon germination, the embryo grows into a seedling.|$|R

5|$|A {{cold front}} stalled and began {{weakening}} {{to the southeast}} of Bermuda on September15, spawning a low-pressure area by September18. A stationary wind circulation developed around the low by September19, aided by a trough aloft to its west. Convection <b>developed</b> <b>into</b> narrow banding features far from the center, and the overall structure gradually consolidated. It is estimated that the system <b>developed</b> <b>into</b> a subtropical depression late on September20, about 490miles southeast of Bermuda; it was classified subtropical {{because of the large}} distance between the convection and the center, uncharacteristic of purely tropical systems. The cyclone tracked northward within the weak steering flow between an upper-level low to its south and a trough to its north. Strengthening gradually, the depression attained subtropical storm status early on September21, and as such was named Kyle by the National Hurricane Center.|$|E
5|$|A {{disturbance}} in the South Indian convergence zone near Seychelles persisted on October24 with {{an area of}} convection. It gradually organized while passing near Agaléga. On October27, it <b>developed</b> <b>into</b> a tropical depression, and after Dvorak classifications of 2.5, the system was named Arilisy. It became disorganized on October29, never having intensified beyond winds of 50km/h (30mph). After moving to the southwest for much of its duration, Arilisy dissipated on October30.|$|E

40|$|The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) {{has been}} {{operating}} the satellite image analysis for tropical cyclones (TCs) in early developing stage such as tropical depressions (TDs) since 2001 to detect them and diagnose their possibility to <b>develop</b> <b>into</b> tropical storms (TSs). The analysis, {{which is based on}} Dvorak (1984), is referred to the early stage Dvorak analysis (EDA) in this report. Comparing organized convective cloud systems (OCCSs) detected through EDA with TCs on weather charts from 2002 to 2006, the detected OCCSs can be acknowledged as follows: � TDs usually have an OCCS detected through EDA, while low pressure areas (LPAs) do not. � OCCSs determined as the T-number of less than 1. 0 have considerable possibility (about 50 %) to <b>develop</b> <b>into</b> TDs with the 10 -minute maximum sustained wind (MSW) of less than Beaufort Force 7. On the other hand, few (about 5 %) OCCSs <b>develop</b> <b>into</b> TDs with MSW of less than Force 7 before the first detection of OCCSs. � OCCSs determined as the T-number of 1. 0 (T 1. 0) have very high possibility (about 80 %) to <b>develop</b> <b>into</b> TDs with MSW of Force 7 and high possibility (about 60 %) to <b>develop</b> <b>into</b> TSs. Before or at the first T 1. 0 determination, many (about 75 %) of them <b>develop</b> <b>into</b> TDs of with MSW of less than Force 7. � OCCSs determined as T 1. 5 have very high possibility (about 80 %) to <b>develop</b> <b>into</b> TSs. Before or at the first T 1. 5 determination, many (about 80 %) of them <b>develop</b> <b>into</b> TDs with MSW of Force 7. � Most (near 100 %) of OCCSs determined as T 2. 0 <b>develop</b> <b>into</b> TSs. 1...|$|R
5|$|A non-tropical trough at {{the surface}} {{extended}} from the northern Gulf of Mexico across Florida into the western Atlantic Ocean. On August 3, the western portion <b>developed</b> <b>into</b> a low pressure area. The eastern portion slowly organized and ultimately <b>developed</b> <b>into</b> Tropical Storm Cristobal. The low pressure area in the Gulf of Mexico steadily organized, and late on August 4 the circulation was organized enough for the National Hurricane Center to classify it as Tropical Depression Two while located 40miles (65km) east of Port Eads, Louisiana. Northeasterly wind shear initially prevented organization of the cloud pattern, though the depression was able to strengthen to become Tropical Storm Bertha about five hours after it formed.|$|E
5|$|A strong {{tropical}} wave accompanied with a {{low pressure}} system moved {{off the coast of}} Africa on August 19. It moved quickly westward and organized, developing banding features and cirrus outflow near the blossoming convection. The wave nearly <b>developed</b> <b>into</b> a tropical cyclone on August 21, though its fast forward motion dislocated the low level circulation from the deep convection. The wave entered an area of dry air in the central Atlantic Ocean, and by late on August 22 most of the convection dissipated from the system. On August 24, convection increased as the wave passed through the Lesser Antilles, though strong southwesterly upper level wind shear prevented further development. The tropical wave moved through the Caribbean Sea, and developed deep convection due to more favorable conditions over the Gulf of Honduras on August 28. The wave crossed the Yucatán Peninsula, and developed a surface low pressure area on the 29th in the Gulf of Mexico. Convection continued to organize, and the tropical wave <b>developed</b> <b>into</b> Tropical Depression Eleven on August 30 while located 335miles (540km) east-southeast of Corpus Christi, Texas.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{entered the}} Atlantic Ocean from Africa on July 10, and the wave <b>developed</b> <b>into</b> {{an area of}} low pressure while passing over Cape Verde. Despite the organization, the low failed to develop into a tropical cyclone due to cool waters on the sea surface and wind shear. However, those unfavorable conditions did not completely destroy the wave, as it continued traveling westward through the Lesser Antilles until July 18. That day, while south of Puerto Rico, the wave split in two; the northern half moved northwest and <b>developed</b> <b>into</b> Tropical Storm Franklin over the Bahamas, and the southern half continued westward, with its associated thunderstorm activity increasing.|$|E

5000|$|In {{seed plants}} the microspores <b>develop</b> <b>into</b> pollen grains each {{containing}} a reduced, multicellular male gametophyte.

The microsporangia of gymnosperms develop in pairs toward the bases of the scales, which are therefore called microsporophylls. Each of the microsporocytes in the microsporangia undergoes meiosis, producing four haploid microspores. These <b>develop</b> <b>into</b> pollen grains, each consisting of four cells and a pair of external air sacs. The air sacs give the pollen grains added buoyancy that helps with wind dispersal.|$|R

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on September 21, moving across the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea with little development. On October 1 it entered the eastern Pacific Ocean, and continuing westward it developed an area of persistent convection on October 5. Initially the system was disorganized, although gradual development was expected as conditions in the upper-levels of the atmosphere were expected to become more favorable. On October 7 it developed a broad low pressure area, and by the next day it was located in the eastern portion of a large area of disturbed weather; the western portion of the system later <b>developed</b> <b>into</b> Tropical Storm Olivia.
