40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the role of}} outsourced intermediate goods, together with capital, labor, and <b>insourced</b> intermediate products, as inputs in Spain's motor vehicle production. Its {{findings are consistent with}} statistically significant economies of scale. Capital and labor are found to be substitutes, as are most of the other input pairs. However, capital and outsourced intermediate goods and labor and <b>insourced</b> intermediate goods appear to have complementary relationships, and the latter relationship has become stronger over the period of study. Any actions that decrease the price of one of the inputs in a complementary pair will increase the demand for the other input. Since labor and outsourced intermediate goods appear to be substitutes, a decrease in import prices as a result of further European integration will decrease the demand for domestic labor and exacerbate Spain's unemployment problem. A similar result holds for <b>insourced</b> and outsourced intermediate goods. Copyright � 2008 The Authors. Journal compilation � 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd. ...|$|R
50|$|Backsourcing is {{sometimes}} confused with <b>insourcing.</b> However, <b>insourcing</b> simply refers to conducting certain activities in-house (whether or {{not by a}} third party), while backsourcing refers to bringing previously outsourced activities back in-house.|$|E
50|$|In contrast, <b>insourcing</b> entails {{bringing}} processes {{handled by}} third-party firms in-house, and is sometimes accomplished via vertical integration.

50|$|<b>Insourcing</b> is the {{commencement}} of performing a business function that could be contracted out internally: either {{with the help of}} a third-party provider who performs the task on-site, or by conducting said task independently. Very often it is seen as opposite of outsourcing. <b>Insourcing</b> is a business decision that is often made to maintain control of critical production or competencies. <b>Insourcing</b> is widely used in production to reduce costs of taxes, labor and transportation.|$|E

40|$|The study {{investigates the}} {{opportunity}} to outsource, partially or totally, the sterilisation service of a hospital. It proposes a framework, based on the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), to support {{the choice of the}} most effective configuration of the service when multiple criteria are considered. First, the sterilisation process was subdivided into stages that could be managed by the hospital (<b>insourced)</b> or outsourced. The feasible configurations obtained by combining <b>insourced</b> and outsourced stages were then evaluated by means of an AHP model that was validated by the participants to the decision process. The framework can be used in different settings, but the criteria must be validated in the each specific case. Further applications to real cases are needed to test it in different contexts, especially if characterised by different organisation structures...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{dissertation}} is {{to investigate}} why the Splendid Hospitality Group (SHG) has introduced outsourcing to their two hotels in Edinburgh and to identify what effects outsourcing is having on the job satisfaction of both <b>insourced</b> and outsourced employees as well as managers. The paper also seeks to gain a full perspective of the differing employee attitudes towards the outsourcing strategy. Firstly, secondary research {{was carried out in}} order to define the term “outsourcing” and to recognize the pros and cons that the outsourcing strategy can have on an organisation and especially, the hotel industry. Following this, primary research was conducted which focused on the experiences and opinions from both <b>insourced</b> and outsourced employees as well as managers in regards to outsourcing within the Splendid Hospitality Group. A qualitative research method was used where six semi-structured, face-to-face interviews were conducted which involved two <b>insourced</b> employees, two outsourced employees as well as two managers of the Splendid Hospitality Group. The data was later transcribed from recordings which were then manually coded where the researcher identified main themes. The themes included the reason to outsource, job performance, conflict between <b>insourced</b> and outsourced employees and the benefits of outsourcing. Moreover, the data was critically discussed which gave an insight into how outsourcing is affecting job satisfaction and the impact this has on a hotel as an organisation within a competitive market. Interestingly, {{all but one of the}} interviewees agreed that outsourcing only impacts negatively on a hotel which has resulted in these participants experiencing challenges such as poor job performance and communication barriers between departments. Moreover, both outsourced employees confirmed feelings of dissatisfaction within their employment which further added to the poor performance of the SHG hotels. Therefore, a set of recommendations were applied where the Splendid Hospitality Group can continue using the outsourcing strategy in a way that will allow job satisfaction amongst employees in order to prevent danger to the organisation’s reputation...|$|R
5000|$|Under the <b>insourcing</b> model, {{employees}} are on-boarded by the CRO, placed at sponsor or remote locations, {{and directed by}} the sponsor at their sites. Insourced resources are valuable in meeting research goals during periods of peak demand. This model allows sponsors to extend their current team without increasing their headcount. The task of the CRO is to then resource employees to the sponsor who can {{blend in with the}} culture of the sponsor company and provide the services that the sponsor needs in conjunction with the existing team. This prevents the sponsors from needing to bring on a dedicated staff when {{they do not have the}} long term need.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} strategic decisions of a company is to choose whether to <b>insource</b> or outsource a particular group of activities or a business function. The trend of outsourcing those activities which do not form a part of the company core competences {{is becoming more and more}} present in business practice. The aim of the analysis within this paper is to review the mentioned trend from the position of organizing the company procurement activities. The analysis shows that there is no unique trend concerning outsourcing all logistics activities, which do not form a part of the company core competences. Unlike the majority of other logistics activities, which as non-basic, tend to be outsourced, procurement dominantly stays <b>insourced.</b> Finally, based on the empirical evidence obtained from a survey carried out among 52 companies in Serbia, it is concluded that even if procurement is outsourced, this trend is more present among service than production companies...|$|R

5000|$|Regional <b>insourcing</b> {{takes this}} {{competitive}} strategy {{one step further}} by applying the classical argument of Adam Smith, which posits that two nations would benefit more from one another by trading the goods {{that they are more}} proficient at manufacturing. For instance, if France produced wine better than England, but England was more apt at manufacturing wool, both nations would benefit from trading with one another, rather than trying to produce both wool and wine on their own. [...] Regional In-Sourcing applies this concept to modern business development. Companies still create separate entities for specific tasks, {{as was the case with}} <b>insourcing,</b> but rather than these operations being performed under the same roof as the rest of the company, they are undertaken in an environment that is far more suitable to their specific purpose.|$|E

Industry standards are currently used to identify the relevant processes and underlying ICT functionality that are present in the service desk.

The latter is done by using the business component identification method, which uses an optimization algorithm in order to identify an optimal distribution of ICT functionality.

40|$|This paper uses {{empirical}} data to compare large-scale agile method tailoring in {{two types of}} global software development programme: offshore outsourced services and offshore captive development centres. This research forms {{part of a larger}} study and uses data collected from face-to-face semi-structured open-ended interviews with over 50 practitioners in 9 international companies selected using a snowball sampling technique. Analysis has been conducted using 'Glaserian' grounded theory concepts, including open coding, memoing, constant comparison and theoretical saturation. The contribution of the paper is to present a novel classification model contrasting solution focused development, where offshore organisations deliver a complete solution, and execution focused development, where offshore organisations implement work packages defined by the client. The research has discovered evidence of solution and execution focused models used by outsourced service providers. In addition, evidence is presented of solution and execution focused models used by <b>insourced</b> offshore development centres. The classification model contrasts offshore project management with offshore management disintermediation, where staff from offshore organisations are directly managed by onshore client staff. Product ownership is commonly located onshore, but here too, counter examples of offshore product ownership have been found in outsourced service providers and <b>insourced</b> offshore development centres...|$|R
