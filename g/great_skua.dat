5|$|Hunting {{areas are}} often located 100km (60mi) or more, {{offshore}} from the nest sites, although when feeding their young, the birds venture out only half that distance. It {{has been found}} that adults bringing fish to their chicks tend to arrive in groups. This is thought to benefit the bird by reducing kleptoparasitism by the Arctic skua which harasses puffins until they drop their fish loads. Predation by the <b>great</b> <b>skua</b> (Catharacta skua) is also reduced by several birds arriving simultaneously.|$|E
5|$|Aerial predators of the Atlantic puffin {{include the}} {{great black-backed gull}} (Larus marinus), the <b>great</b> <b>skua</b> (Stercorarius skua), and similar-sized species, which can catch a bird in flight, or attack one that is unable to escape fast enough on the ground. On {{detecting}} danger, puffins take off and fly down {{to the safety of}} the sea or retreat into their burrows, but if caught they defend themselves vigorously with beak and sharp claws. When the puffins are wheeling round beside the cliffs it becomes very difficult for a predator to concentrate on a single bird while any individual isolated on the ground is at greater risk. Smaller gull species like the herring gull (L. argentatus) and the lesser black-backed gull are hardly able to bring down a healthy adult puffin. They stride through the colony taking any eggs that have rolled towards burrow entrances or recently hatched chicks that have ventured too far towards the daylight. They will also steal fish from puffins returning to feed their young. Where it nests on the tundra in the far north, the Arctic skua (Stercorarius parasiticus) is a terrestrial predator, but at lower latitudes it is a specialised kleptoparasite, concentrating on auks and other seabirds. It harasses puffins while they are airborne forcing them to drop their catch which it then snatches up.|$|E

40|$|Many {{species of}} bird {{recognize}} acoustic and visual cues given by their predators and have complex defence adaptations to reduce predation risk. Recognition of threats posed by specific predators and specialized anti-predation behaviours are common. In {{this study we}} investigated predator recognition and anti-predation behaviours in a pelagic seabird, Leach's Storm-petrel Oceanodroma leucorhoa, at a site where predation risk from <b>Great</b> <b>Skuas</b> Stercorarius skua is exceptionally high. Leach's Storm-petrels breed in burrows and come on land only at night. Counter-predator adaptations were investigated correlatively in relation to changing natural light levels at night, and experimentally in relation to nocturnal visual and acoustic signals from <b>Great</b> <b>Skuas.</b> Colony attendance by Leach's Storm-petrels was attuned to changes in light conditions at night and was highest when nights were darkest. This behaviour is likely to reduce predation risk on land; however, specific recognition of <b>Great</b> <b>Skuas</b> and specialized defence behaviours were not found. Leach's Storm-petrels, in particular apparently non-breeding individuals, were entirely naïve to {{the threat posed by}} <b>Great</b> <b>Skuas</b> and were captured easily in a variety of different ways, on the ground and in the air. Lack of specialized behavioural adaptations in Leach's Storm-petrels against <b>Great</b> <b>Skuas</b> may be because spatial overlap of breeding distributions of these species appears to be a rare and recent phenomenon...|$|R

Although, given the opportunity, they occasionally kill and harass some land birds, white-tailed eagles usually target water-based birds as prey.

60|$|There {{was nothing}} new to me in all this: {{it was an old}} {{familiar}} story; I have given it fully, simply because it is an accurate statement of what is being done all over the country. There is not a county in the kingdom where you may not hear of important members of the community who are collectors of birds and their eggs, and law-breakers, both directly and indirectly, every day of their lives. They all take, and pay for, every rare visitant that comes in their way, and also require an unlimited supply of the rarer resident species for the purpose of exchange with other private collectors in distant counties. In this way our finest species are gradually being extirpated. Within the last few years we have seen the disappearance (as breeding species) of the ruff and reeve, marsh harrier, and honey buzzard; and the species now on the verge of extinction, which will soon follow these and others that have gone before, if indeed some of them have not already gone, are the sea-eagle, osprey, kite, hen harrier, Montagu's harrier, stone curlew, Kentish plover, dotterel, red-necked phalarope, roseate tern, bearded tit, grey-lag goose, and <b>great</b> <b>skua.</b> These in their turn will be followed by the chough, hobby, great black-backed gull, furze wren, crested tit, and others. These are the species which, as things are going, will absolutely and for ever disappear, as residents and breeders, from off the British Islands. Meanwhile other species that, although comparatively rare, are less local in their distribution, are being annually exterminated {{in some parts of the}} country: it is poor comfort to the bird lover in southern England to know that many species that formerly gave life and interest to the scene, and have lately been done to death there, may still be met with in the wilder districts of Scotland, or in some forest in the north of Wales. Finally, we have among our annual visitants a considerable number of species which have either bred in these islands in past times (some quite recently), or else would probably remain to breed if they were not immediately killed on arrival--bittern, little bittern, night heron, spoonbill, stork, avocet, black tern, hoopoe, golden oriole, and many others of less well-known names.|$|E

40|$|Capsule <b>Great</b> <b>Skuas</b> Stercorarius skua {{breeding}} in Scotland, Iceland, and Norway, {{winter in}} different areas. Aims To assess the winter distribution of adult <b>Great</b> <b>Skuas</b> breeding in different countries. Methods Geolocation data-loggers were deployed on breeding adults at colonies in Shetland (Scotland), southeast Iceland, and Bjørnøya (Norway) in 2008. Loggers were recovered when birds returned to breed {{the next year}} and downloaded data were processed to indicate the location of each individual throughout the winter period. Results Adult <b>Great</b> <b>Skuas</b> from Scotland wintered off northwest Africa and southern Europe. Adults from Iceland mostly wintered off Canada, with small numbers visiting northwest Africa and Europe. Although adults from Bjørnøya (Norway) migrated to similar areas to birds from Iceland, a slightly greater proportion wintered off Europe, and most used areas further north than birds from Scotland. Although three birds studied over consecutive winters used the same small area in consecutive years, four moved between different areas within one winter.

40|$|Capsule <b>Great</b> <b>Skuas</b> Stercorarius skua {{wintering}} {{in different}} areas spent different amounts of time in flight (foraging or searching for food) and so may be experiencing different feeding conditions. Aims To compare the daily percentage {{of time spent in}} flight (foraging or searching for food) between different wintering areas. Methods In 2008, loggers equipped with a saltwater sensor were deployed on adult <b>Great</b> <b>Skuas</b> at three colonies in the northeast Atlantic, and the data used to compare foraging activity between the five main wintering areas. Results The five areas used by 22 <b>Great</b> <b>Skuas</b> in winter were widely separated, from the northwest Atlantic to northwest Africa, and differ substantially in oceanography. The main difference in foraging effort among areas for individuals that were site-faithful was that the percentage of time per day spent in flight off northwest Africa was much lower than elsewhere. Among five birds that travelled between wintering areas, one reduced the percentage of time in flight after switching from Iberia to northwest Africa. Conclusion The data suggest that feeding conditions were better off northwest Africa than elsewhere, at least during winter 2008 / 09. This allowed <b>Great</b> <b>Skuas</b> wintering in that region to spend more time resting, so probably reducing their overall energy expenditure...|$|R
40|$|Temporal, biological, and {{environmental}} factors affecting accumulation of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are poorly understood in comparison with legacy lipid-soluble persistent organic pollutants. Temporal and biological comparisons of PFAS concentrations were made in <b>great</b> <b>skuas</b> (Stercorarius skua), a marine apex predator. Concentrations of 16 PFASs were quantified, including C 4 –C 10 perfluorosulfonates (PFSAs), perfluorooctanesulfonamide (PFOSA), and C 5 –C 14 perfluorocarboxylates (PFCAs). Concentrations of PFASs (ng/g wet wt) were significantly higher in eggs collected in Shetland in 2008 compared with 1980 for most compounds. However, {{the magnitude of the}} differences was small, with a mean increase of 3 [*]ng/g. Levels of PFASs in <b>great</b> <b>skuas</b> were low compared with those of other seabirds in similar ecological niches; and in contrast to other contaminants measured in the same eggs, concentrations of PFASs did not correlate with trophic level. Concentrations of PFASs in adult plasma were significantly higher in males than in females for most PFASs. This suggests that maternal transfer through egg laying may be a significant mode of elimination of PFASs in female <b>great</b> <b>skuas.</b> The low concentrations of PFASs in eggs and plasma compared with other halogenated organic contaminants and other species suggest that <b>great</b> <b>skuas</b> do not bioaccumulate PFASs to the same extent as some other seabirds...|$|R

40|$|Birds such as <b>great</b> <b>skuas</b> Catharacta skua {{adapted for}} {{successful}} breeding at high latitudes may experience problems of heat dissipation in mild climates. <b>Great</b> <b>skuas</b> spend time bathing at freshwater sites close to breeding territories and here, we examine impacts of heat stress on bathing, foraging and nest attendance of adults during three breeding seasons with marked {{variation in the}} availability of prey (1 -group sandeels Ammodytes marinus). Adults exhibited diurnal variation in bathing activity that matched heat-stress conditions. Moreover more birds bathed on days of higher average heat stress, suggesting that bathing {{plays a role in}} thermoregulation. Bathing numbers were lower in years of poor food availability, when adult attendance at territories was low, probably because lower attendance reduced the opportunity for parents to bathe without leaving chicks unattended. Chicks are normally guarded by female parents and fed by males but under conditions of low food availability territorial attendance of breeding pairs was particularly low on days of high heat stress, with chicks regularly left unattended at air temperatures exceeding 14 degrees C. Unattended chicks are at risk of being killed by neighbouring conspecifics and survival of chicks to fledging was low in the two years of low sandeel stocks.

40|$|The close {{similarity}} in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) between Pomarine and (North Atlantic) <b>Great</b> <b>skuas,</b> Stercorarius pomarinus and Stercorarius skua, has several possible explanations. Two {{of the main}} alternatives are stochastic lineage sorting of mtDNA and introgressive hybridization between S. pomarinus and S. skua. Here, a new probabilistic approach to testing these alternatives using different phylogenies based on external morphology, mtDNA and ectoparasites leads to rejection of the lineage sorting and corroboration of the hybridization hypothesis. If <b>great</b> <b>skuas</b> are a monophyletic group, {{as indicated by the}} present cladistic analysis based on morphology and by other evidence, the available molecular genetic data are as expected if mtDNA has been transferred from S. pomarinus to S. skua by introgressive hybridization.

40|$|The huge {{quantities}} of waste produced by commercial fisheries worldwide attract {{large numbers of}} scavengers. Reducing this wasteful practice is desirable, but may have implications for marine ecosystems as scavengers will face a major shortfall in food. Predicting the impact of reduced discarding requires information {{on the strength of}} the link between scavengers and fisheries. We analysed sagittal otoliths regurgitated by <b>great</b> <b>skuas</b> Stercorarius skua over 5 yr from 8 different colonies in Shetland, UK, and over 18 yr from 1 of these sites, in relation to spatial and temporal variation in fisheries activity. The proportions of 2 demersal fish not normally available to skuas, haddock Melanogrammus aeglefinus and whiting Merlangius merlangus, are positively correlated with annual variation in discard estimates. The proportion of whiting at 8 colonies is positively correlated with spatial differences in fish biomass estimates, and blue whiting Micromesistus potassou are only eaten in colonies close to the continental shelf edge, where this species is fished. Non-breeding <b>great</b> <b>skuas</b> tend to eat smaller and significantly more variable discarded fish compared with breeders. Our results indicate that <b>great</b> <b>skuas</b> rely heavily on fishery discards and are also sensitive to spatial and temporal changes in fisheries activity. Differences between breeding status indicate that the non-breeding component of the population may respond differently to changing discard policy.

We use Bayesian state-space models to describe the flight height distributions and the error in altitude measured by GPS for lesser black-backed gulls and <b>great</b> <b>skuas,</b> tracked throughout the breeding season. We also examine how location and light levels influence flight height. * Lesser black-backed gulls flew lower by night than by day, indicating that this species {{would be less likely to}} encounter turbine blades at night, when birds’ ability to detect and avoid them might be reduced. Gulls flew highest over land and lowest near the coast. For <b>great</b> <b>skuas,</b> no significant relationships were found between flight height, time of day and location. * We consider four ‘collision risk windows’, corresponding to the airspace swept by rotor blades for different offshore wind turbine designs. We found the highest proportion of birds at risk for a 22 – 250 m turbine (up to 9 % for <b>great</b> <b>skuas</b> and 34 % for lesser black-backed gulls) and the lowest for a 30 – 258 m turbine. Our results suggest lesser black-backed gulls are at greater risk of collision than <b>great</b> <b>skuas,</b> especially by day. * Synthesis and applications. Our novel modelling approach is an effective way of resolving the error associated with GPS tracking data. We demonstrate its use on GPS measurements of altitude, generating important information on how breeding seabirds use their environment. This approach and the associated data also provide information to improve avian collision risk assessments for offshore wind farms. Our modelling approach could be applied to other GPS data sets to help manage the ecological needs of seabirds and other species at a time when the pressures on the marine environment are growing...|$|R
