3000|$|Two {{mechanisms}} are suggested for the deformation of the Nile <b>Delta</b> <b>Hinge</b> Zone: Fault block displacement along basement-rooted faults or northward gravitational sliding is allowed by listric faults and detachment/décollment surfaces. Both these geological models describe the extensional tectonics {{in the south}} part of the studied area and could also {{be related to the}} compressional structures located against the Rosetta and Bardawil intersection. From a geometrical point of view, the restoration supports this relationship, evaluating the “volume” balance between the extensional displacement in the south (Hinge Zone) and the compression in the north (Cappelleti et al. 2010).|$|E
3000|$|Misfaq-Bardawil (Temsah) fault {{appears to}} be active only since Miocene: The {{dominant}} fault movement {{is due to the}} pre-salt including post-salt reactivation. The evolution of the NW–SE Temsah fault trend is different in timing: even if the restoration of 2 D sections crossing a strike-slip fault does not allow a correct balance, the thickness of the layers. The Oligocene setting shows the dextral wrench activity of the Temsah fault that began at Miocene age. The E–W-trending Nile <b>Delta</b> <b>Hinge</b> Zone consists of several northward-dipping normal faults, probably deeply rooted, bounding the southward-tilted half-graben fault blocks. The northward subsidence and sinking of the African margin in the Nile Delta area are mainly related to movements on the planes of these normal faults.|$|E

Here, native MS {{was employed to examine}} the noncovalent interactions involved in homodimerization of antibody half molecules (HL) in hinge-deleted human IgG 4 (IgG 4 <b>Delta</b> <b>hinge).</b> By analyzing the concentration dependence of the relative distribution of monomer HL and dimer (HL) (2) species, the apparent dissociation constant (K(D)) for this interaction was determined. In combination with site-directed mutagenesis, the relative contributions of residues at the CH 3 -CH 3 interface to this interaction could be characterized and corresponding K(D) values quantified over a range of 10 (- 10) - 10 (- 4) M. The critical importance of this noncovalent interaction in maintaining the intact dimeric structure was also proven for the full-length IgG 4 backbone. Using time-resolved MS, the kinetics of the interaction could be measured, reflecting the dynamics of IgG 4 HL exchange. Hence, native MS has provided a quantitative view of local structural features that define biological properties of IgG 4...|$|E
5000|$|Anambra basin is {{situated}} {{west of the}} lower Benue Trough and often considered newest formation from the Benue Trough. The basin is bounded to the south by the Niger <b>Delta</b> Basin <b>hinge</b> line. It extends north-westward into the Niger Valley, northward to the Jos massif and north-eastward into Lafia. The eastern and western limits of the basin are defined by the Abakaliki Anticlinorium and Ibadan massif, respectively.|$|R
40|$|The Upper Vortex Flap (UVF) is a {{multipurpose}} surface {{concept to}} improve the subsonic aerodynamics of highly swept <b>delta</b> wings. <b>Hinged</b> along the leading edges and deployed from the wing upper surface, the UVF generates a vortex inboard on the wing {{in addition to the}} leading-edge vortex acting on the flap. The relative suction levels on the wing and on the flap surface, governed by the flap angle and angle of attack, lead to a variety of functional applications viz. lift increment, drag modulation, lift/drag improvement and roll augmentation. This paper presents wind tunnel force and pressure measurements on a 74 -deg flat plate delta to define the UVF-related vortex effects and to assess its potential as a versatile control surface in different angle-of-attack regimes...|$|R
40|$|Square and <b>delta</b> wing {{actuators}} <b>hinged</b> at {{the wall}} beneath a flow have been deployed inside in the flow with an angular velocity between 10 and 55 rad/s. The transient flow field has been simulated experimentally in a low speed wind tunnel. These dynamic effects depend on the Strouhal number which {{can be considered as}} the ratio the Stokes to Reynolds number of the flow. It was found that these effects are augmented with increasing Strouhal number. The square actuator was found to have better aerodynamic performance than the delta or triangular ones. The effect of the incoming boundary layer was also investigated here. Experiments at two different locations in the same boundary layer established the effect of the boundary layer thickness on the generated forces. It was found that for the same nominal Strouhal number the thicker boundary layer produced higher dynamical effects and therefore higher forces. Particle Image Velocimetry phase-locked with the motion of the actuator indicated the existence of large scale vortices during the deployment. A horse-shoe vortex is always formed in front the actuator starting at very small deployment angles and a vortex is shed off the actuator at its top tip. Additional experiments were carried out under static condition to establish the effect of the wall proximity on the drag coefficient. It was found the drag coefficient is decreasing with decreasing distance from the wall.

40|$|We have {{determined}} the {{amino acid sequence}} of the first constant (C) region domain (C delta 1) and the hinge region of the delta heavy chain of human IgD WAH and also the sequence of the adjacent COOH-terminal portion of the variable (V) region, including the JH region. Together with the sequence of the Fc fragment already reported, this establishes the complete amino acid sequence of the C region of the human delta chain and confirms the presence of three C region domains in human IgD. Although the CH 1 domains of the five classes of human heavy chains have the expected degree of homology (approximately 30 %), the homology of the C delta 1 domains of the human and mouse chains is less than that exhibited by the CH 1 domains of other pairs of human and mouse heavy chains. The hinge region of the human delta chain has an unusual structure; the NH 2 -terminal half has four (or five) GalN oligosaccharides attached, whereas the COOH-terminal half lacks carbohydrate, is dissimilar in sequence, and has a high charge. A computer search verified that the GalN-rich segment has {{a high degree of}} identity in sequence with the middle portion of the human C mu 2 domain and that the high-charge segment is related to the same sequence. We propose that the two segments of the human <b>delta</b> <b>hinge</b> have a common evolutionary origin and arose by duplication and independent mutation of a hinge exon derived from the ancestral gene for the C mu 2 domain...|$|E
