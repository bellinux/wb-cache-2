5000|$|The {{introduction}} of Basel I regulations made holding bank capital and asset-backed securities (ABSs) expensive for a bank, {{depending on the}} ratings assigned {{by one of the}} Government sponsored ratings agencies. ABS's that were able to attain a rating of AA or AAA had capital requirements as low as 1.6% of the securities' size (8%x20%), allowing for higher leverage than would have been allowed otherwise. Bank capital securities, such as <b>dated</b> <b>subordinated</b> <b>debt</b> could be weighted as highly as to amount to a deduction from capital. That is to say all the investment would be funded from capital. A 'loophole' in the Basel accords meant that banks could provide a liquidity facility to the SIV of up to 360 days without holding capital against it so long as it was undrawn. The 'arbitrage' was therefore possible initially because the buy-side of the market for these instruments was limited.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the aims}} of {{mandatory}} <b>subordinated</b> <b>debt</b> is to enhance both direct and indirect market discipline.

40|$|Increasing the {{effectiveness}} of market discipline in regulated financial markets {{has emerged as a}} major policy issue for banking regulators. Perhaps the most prominent proposal for increasing market discipline is the proposal to require banks to issue publicly held <b>subordinated</b> <b>debt.</b> <b>Subordinated</b> <b>debt</b> holders can discipline banks either directly by demanding higher yields for riskier institutions or indirectly by means of market signals. This paper explores the fundamental rationale behind mandatory <b>subordinated</b> <b>debt</b> proposals, and discusses {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the most prominent proposals. To more clearly focus the analysis, the paper concentrates on proposals for requiring publicly traded <b>subordinated</b> <b>debt,</b> and therefore our analysis is relevant only to relatively large institutions that can feasibly issue such securities. The paper does not consider the various alternative proposals for issuing <b>subordinated</b> <b>debt</b> specifically designed for small institutions. Our analysis indicates that a <b>subordinated</b> <b>debt</b> requirement will only modestly increase the risk sensitivity of bank costs at most large banks; however, we argue that there are substantial benefits to using <b>subordinated</b> <b>debt</b> as a market-based trigger for regulatory action. While we favor a mandatory requirement to issue <b>subordinated</b> <b>debt,</b> such a requirement should not eliminate separate minimums for equity capital, as some proponents of <b>subordinated</b> <b>debt</b> suggest. ∗ The opinions expressed here are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent those of th...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} empirically investigates how and to {{what extent}} bank <b>subordinated</b> <b>debt</b> plays a role in providing market discipline whereby the private sector is deployed to monitor and influence bank risk taking, hence complement government supervision and regulation of banks. The study comprises four essays on the use of <b>subordinated</b> <b>debt</b> as an instrument for creating direct and indirect market discipline, with specific reference to the case of the UK banking industry. Broadly, Chapters 2, 3 and 4 examine the effectiveness of <b>subordinated</b> <b>debt</b> as an instrument of direct market discipline; Chapter 5 approaches the issue of indirect market discipline. First, we analyse whether the risk premiums or yield spreads of <b>subordinated</b> <b>debt</b> indicate banks’ financial health. Our results show that yield spreads contain timely and accurate information on issuing banks’ risk taking, and this underpins the proposals that advocate forcing large financial institutions to issue <b>subordinated</b> <b>debt</b> to the public on a regular basis. Then we examine whether the issued <b>subordinated</b> <b>debt</b> and its price have any impact on banks’ performance. The results have positive signs, implying that the signalling and influencing effects of <b>subordinated</b> <b>debt</b> can induce banks to act prudently and restrain them from assuming unsound risk. However, the final chapter finds that the UK financial regulator, the Financial Services Authority (FSA) has little enthusiasm for utilizing the <b>subordinated</b> <b>debt</b> to indirectly discipline financial institutions. This reflects the FSA’s doubt as to the usefulness of the market in providing disciplining effects. In contrast, the evidence documented in this research shows that the subordinated market proves to be sensitive to bank risk, and banks do respond to market information, hence it can be an effective mechanism for generating useful market discipline. In reforming the financial regulation regime, adding new regulations to the old is therefore not the best way forward. Rather, priority should be given to reforming the paradigm of financial regulation by allowing more room for the subordinated market to discipline the regulators to take more prompt and rigorous corrective actions. ...|$|R
40|$|Academics, {{policymakers and}} bank {{supervisors}} have expressed considerable interest in using <b>subordinated</b> <b>debt</b> and other market {{data in the}} surveillance of banking organizations, especially large and complex financial institutions. However, {{little research has been}} devoted to developing practical means of implementing such an approach for <b>subordinated</b> <b>debt.</b> This paper attempts to fill a portion of this gap. A major problem with using <b>subordinated</b> <b>debt</b> spreads is that accurate prices of individual <b>subordinated</b> <b>debt</b> issues are difficult to come by. The bond market is largely an over-the-counter market where dealer prices are proprietary. The approach used here is to evaluate a number of data sources, including price series from vendors and broker-dealers. Our results indicate that <b>subordinated</b> <b>debt</b> spreads are most consistent across sources for the most liquid bond issues. We also find that the most liquid bonds are those that have a relatively large issuance size, have a relatively young age, have been issued by a relatively large banking organization, and are traded in a relatively robust overall bond market. Moreover, although there are substantial differences in spread levels for individual bonds across data sources, there is a high degree of concordance in rankings of banking organizations by their minimum spreads across issues. There is especially strong agreement about which large banking organizations are in the tails of the spread distribution at a given point in time. However, time series results indicate that movements of <b>subordinated</b> <b>debt</b> spreads at individual institutions are sensitive to the data source for bond prices, thus complicating interpretation of such movements. On balance, our results support and provide guidance for the use of <b>subordinated</b> <b>debt</b> spreads in supervisory monitoring. However, they also support the need for careful judgment when interpreting such spreads, highlight difficulties with currently available data sources, and motivate the need for further research...|$|R
