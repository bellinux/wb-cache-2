5|$|On {{a trip to}} {{the bird}} sanctuary, the Simpson family discovers that a {{speedway}} raceway built around the sanctuary is opening that day, to Lisa's dismay. The family watches from the stand and sees Ned Flanders and his family, who claims to enjoy the high levels of safety the drivers use. Later, a squad of cheerleaders fires free T-shirts from air cannons into the crowd, and Homer rudely demands one. Irritated, Maude leaves to buy hot dogs. The cheerleaders send a full salvo of T-shirts in Homer's direction, but <b>he</b> <b>bends</b> down at the last second to pick up a bobby pin on the ground. Maude returns at that exact moment, gets hit by the T-shirts and falls {{over the edge of the}} bleachers to her death on the parking lot.|$|E
25|$|Shoes {{are then}} {{measured}} {{to the foot}} and bent to the correct shape using a hammer and anvil, and other modifications, such as taps for shoe studs, are added. Farriers may either cold shoe, in which <b>he</b> <b>bends</b> the metal shoe without heating it, or hot shoe, in which he places the metal in a forge before bending it. Hot shoeing can be more time-consuming, and requires the farrier {{to have access to}} a forge; however, it usually provides a better fit, as the mark made on the hoof from the hot shoe can show how even it lies. It also allows the farrier to make more modifications to the shoe, such as drawing toe- and quarter-clips. The farrier must take care not to hold the hot shoe against the hoof too long, as the heat can damage the hoof.|$|E
500|$|His despair gone, Bemis contentedly sorts {{the books}} he {{looks forward to}} reading for years to come. Just as <b>he</b> <b>bends</b> {{down to pick up}} the first book, he stumbles, and his glasses fall off and shatter. In shock, he picks up the broken remains of the glasses he is {{virtually}} blind without, and says, [...] "That's not fair. That's not fair at all. There was time now. There was—was all the time I needed…! It's not fair! [...] It's not fair!" [...] and bursts into tears, surrounded by books he now can never read.|$|E

6000|$|... "Mr. Bundercombe, I see {{his face}} change. His mouth came wide open; his eyes looked as though they would drop out. <b>He</b> <b>bend</b> over that note. He {{looked at it and}} looked at it; and then he looked at me.|$|R
500|$|The {{archangel}} Gabriel {{appears to}} Mary to inform {{her that she}} shall bear the Son of God. [...] He is shown standing in a three-quarter view wearing a small jeweled diadem and dressed in vestments. He has a richly embroidered red-and-gold brocade cope, edged with a pattern of gray seraphim and wheels, over a white alb and amice. He holds his staff of office in one hand, and raises the other towards the Virgin. <b>He</b> <b>bends</b> his knees, honoring and acknowledging her as Mother of Christ and Queen of Heaven, and his feet are bare and positioned slightly behind hers.|$|E
2500|$|The play {{within the}} play is set in [...] "Lady Muldoon's country {{residence}} one morning in early spring" [...] and opens with a body lying on an otherwise empty stage. The help, Mrs. Drudge, gravitates to the radio, oblivious to the corpse, and turns it on {{just in time for}} an overly expository police message explaining that police are searching for an escaped madman in the swamps surrounding the manor. Simon, a mysterious young man new in the neighbourhood enters the house, and it is revealed that he has dumped Felicity Cunningham for her friend Cynthia Muldoon, lady of the house. In the audience, Birdboot has mentally done the same. Major Magnus Muldoon, Cynthia's brother-in-law, is also in love with Cynthia. Eventually Inspector Hound from the police force arrives on the scene, apparently searching for the madman, and the company finally notices the body. The company splits up to look for a man of suspicion, when Simon is left alone on stage with the body, <b>he</b> <b>bends</b> over it and seems to recognise the victim, at which point he is shot by an unknown assailant.|$|E

6000|$|She {{could not}} keep the narrow way, [...] For still the little feet would stray, [...] And ever must <b>he</b> <b>bend</b> t' undo [...] The tangled grasses from her shoe,-- [...] From dainty rosebud lips in pout, [...] Must kiss the perfect flowér out! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear Davy," [...] he said, {{giving me}} a vicious kick, [...] "I {{could not think of}} it. I will go with you at once.

6000|$|Just on the day, {{when the}} {{high-mounted}} Sun [...] Did furthest in his northern progress run, [...] <b>He</b> <b>bended</b> forward, and even stretch'd the sphere [...] Beyond {{the limits of}} the lengthen'd year, [...] To view a brighter sun in Britain born; [...] That was the business of his longest morn; [...] 10 [...] The glorious object seen, 'twas time to turn.|$|R
6000|$|But {{away with}} remembrance, no more will I pine [...] That others usurped {{for a time}} what was mine!

60|$|He {{turned away}} {{without looking at}} her, and <b>he</b> hesitated, <b>bending</b> over to pluck a stem of goldenrod.|$|R
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>bends</b> his travel-tarnished feet [...] To {{where she}} wastes in clay: From day-dawn until eve he fares [...] Along the wintry way; From day-dawn until eve repairs [...] Unto her mound to pray.|$|E

6000|$|... "Then," [...] said <b>he,</b> <b>bending</b> on {{me a look}} of {{the utmost}} severity, [...] "there is indeed little more to be said. Nevertheless, we {{take into account the}} {{confused}} state of your intellect yesterday, and judge you leniently; and let us hope that the pangs of an outraged conscience will be more painful to you than the light punishment I am about to inflict for so destestable a crime." ...|$|R

6000|$|BLOOM: Poetry. Well educated. Pity. (<b>He</b> <b>bends</b> {{again and}} undoes the buttons of Stephen's waistcoat) To breathe. (He brushes the woodshavings from Stephen's clothes with light hand and fingers) One pound seven. Not hurt anyhow. (He listens) What? ...|$|E
