It certainly {{appears to have been}} one of its most vigorously contested, featuring multiple, longstanding and competing territorial and maritime jurisdictional claims. The objective of this chapter is to provide the geographical and geopolitical background to the frequently conflicting national maritime claims made by the South China Sea littoral States. This exercise is designed to provide the necessary contextual backdrop to considerations of the application of maritime <b>joint</b> <b>development</b> mechanisms and/or other provisional arrangements of a practical nature in the South China Sea. With this in mind, key characteristics of the coastal geography of the South China Sea are outlined, notably the implications of its semienclosed nature and the baselines that have been defined along its coasts. The insular features of the South China Sea, many of which are subject to conflicting sovereignty claims, are then examined with particular reference to their potential maritime claims and role in the delimitation of maritime boundaries. The chapter then outlines the maritime jurisdictional claims of the South China Sea coastal States, including existing maritime boundary agreements and maritime <b>joint</b> <b>development</b> <b>zones,</b> as well as unilateral and historical maritime claims. Accordingly, a spatial picture of the maritime geography of the South China Sea including the locations and extents of claims to maritime jurisdiction is built up.

50|$|Indications of the {{existence}} of hydrocarbons in São Tomé and Príncipe were first noted in 1974, but attempts by the Portuguese Colonial Administration to sign a concession agreement with Ball & Collins North Sea consortium (a predecessor of Premier Oil of the United Kingdom) were abandoned following the country’s declaration of independence in 1975. Other attempts to start petroleum exploration during the late 1980s and 1990s also failed. In 2003, Nigeria (60%) and São Tomé and Príncipe (40%) agreed to jointly operate an overlapping maritime boundary located about 200 km offshore Nigeria known as the <b>Joint</b> <b>Development</b> <b>Zone</b> (JDZ). Activities in the JDZ were to be overseen by the Joint Development Authority (JDADA). The JDZ was divided into nine blocks, and a licensing round was opened for bids in 2004, which resulted in the award of Block 1 to a consortium made up of Chevron Corporation of the United States (51%), Esso Exploration and Production Nigeria-Sao Tome (One) Ltd.

40|$|The Law of International Maritime Boundaries is {{characterized}} by an evolution that can be noticed at many levels. These levels include the application of equitable principles, the criteria for delimitation, the basis of title, the techniques, the methods and the applicable law. This legal evolution, which is deep-rooted in a case by case approach has not always led to greater predictability and consistency of the judicial and arbitral decisions. One {{should keep in mind}} the fact that each case is a unicum. From the 1969 pioneer North Continental Shelf Case to recent decisions, the position of the I. C. J. is well-established: there is not one method of delimitation which is predetermined or privileged, which takes priority or which is of mandatory application. The ultimate goal consists in drawing an equitable maritime boundary between coastal States. In Jan Mayen Case (Denmark/ Norway Case 1993), the I. C. J. made two major developments by considering in one hand the equidistance provision first codified at article 6 of Geneva Convention on the Continental Shelf as a provisional method of delimitation. On the other hand, the Court gave notable effect to socio-economic factors which, prior to that case, had been constantly dismissed because of their subjectivity, variability and momentary nature (Tunisia/ Libya Case 1982). Regarding the basis of the title, progress from natural prolongation as the traditional basis of the title to 200 miles distance from the shoreline as the new basis of the title (Libya/ Malta Case 1985) should be noted. As for the application of equitable principles, one can say that they are progressively losing their variability. For the judge, in fact, equitable principles must be of an objective nature based mainly on coastal geography in order to be of general application. With regard to applicable law issues, besides the 1958 Geneva Convention, States now have recourse to the 1982 Convention on the Law of the Sea, States practice, jurisprudence, and rules of customary international law. In respect of that law which is evolving with its uncertainties, we have tried to lay stress on the contributions of African States to its development. We wanted to verify to what extent those States have played a significant part in the progressive development of the Law of the Sea in general and particularly with regard the law of maritime boundary delimitation. We have emphasized {{in the first part of}} our analysis, the evolution of the law of maritime boundaries. In the second part, we have analysed in two steps African contributions. We have concluded that African Coastal States should, as much as possible and in line with the trend to peaceful cooperation at sea in Africa, avoid resolving disputes through litigation. After having defined their maritime priorities, policies and strategies, States should use diplomatic negotiations to settle their maritime boundary disputes. They can also, as a supplementary approach, set up <b>Joint</b> <b>Development</b> <b>Zones</b> or provide for Joint Exploitation of their marine resources as an interim approach to disputes resolution. We have analyzed the legal implications of such regimes in the prospective case between Ivory Coast and Ghana. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{application}} of wellsite biostratigraphic technique has aided {{the reconstruction of}} the subsurface geology in the Nigerian deepwater region. It has further aided decision making during drilling operations including the planning of well paths. Critical decisions regarding casing setting, coring point selection, overpressure zone determination and total depth picks, are easily achieved through confirmation of well prognosis and correlation to offset wells. This technique is very important in the tectonically active Nigerian deepwater region which is characterized by varying degrees of both syn-depositional and post-depositional deformation. Accurate interpretation of basin architecture, lateral variation and facies change is required before drilling. Confirmation of well prognosis during drilling operation is equally important. It has been proved that wellsite biostratigraphic technique helps to “get it right at first” when integrated with the traditional lithologic description, log signature correlation and seismic profile interpretations. The modern and rapid processing technique of calcareous nannofossil, for instance, provides ‘real time’ result for the exploration team for confirmation of, or adjustment to, the drilling program. The attendant contribution in saved time, cost and safe and successful drilling operation makes the technique beneficial for all operators. This paper presents practical experience of wellsite biostratigraphy application in three oil prolific Nigerian deepwater regions: the Niger Delta, <b>Joint</b> <b>Development</b> <b>zone</b> of Nigeria/Sao Tome and Principe area (JDZ) and Benin (Dahomey) Basin...|$|E

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{maritime}} joint development zones {{have emerged as}} an important means to overcome deadlock in relation to maritime jurisdictional claims. A key consideration in the negotiation and establishment of maritime joint development arrangements {{is the definition of}} the precise geographical area within which joint development is to proceed. This chapter reviews joint development practice with particular reference to the spatial definition of joint zones. This experience can be broadly divided into joint zones that have been agreed in addition to a maritime boundary line and those that have been defined {{in the absence of a}} boundary line, which have proved a more popular alternative. With respect to the latter type of joint zone, many such joint areas are determined by the limits of competing maritime claims and thus involve the joint development of disputed waters. The definition of joint zones in this manner is often a sensitive and challenging issue. This is the case because, without prejudice clauses notwithstanding, the use of unilateral maritime claims as the limits of a joint area to an extent validates such claims, giving them practical impact and thereby a degree of endorsement and legitimacy which they may not, in fact, warrant. This has led to reluctance on the part of some States to, in a sense, recognise and accept what are regarded as excessive claims through their use in the definition of the limits of a maritime <b>joint</b> <b>development</b> <b>zone.</b> This chapter explores past experience of how this delicate issue has been dealt with. Some observations drawn from this inventory and assessment of past practice are offered, together with some preliminary considerations on the applicability of these observations to overlapping claims in the South China Sea...|$|E
40|$|This study {{critically}} {{assesses the}} appropriateness of the governance system used to control all aspects of oil exploration and production within the Nigeria São Tomé and Príncipe <b>Joint</b> <b>Development</b> <b>Zone</b> (NSTP-JDZ). The motivation for carrying out the research emerged from {{a review of the literature}} on oil and gas joint venture operations which straddle more than one country’s borders. In the case of the NSTP-JDZ, several reports had criticised its governance practices but had failed to provide a rigorous analysis to substantiate their claims. The study therefore contributes to the literature relating to the governance of oil and gas joint development zones. A mixed method approach was used in the empirical research and the results were analysed against a globally acknowledged good governance theoretical framework. The results confirmed that there are major flaws in the NSTP-JDZ governance system, although there are also positive aspects of the practices. Four areas of concern were identified: Firstly, inadequate personnel skills were impairing management of the zone to such an extent that it could not be guaranteed that resources will be safeguarded for the benefits of future generation. Secondly, control of resources was severely impaired by an uncertainty about who had the authority to implement actions and, of more concern, by political and other conflicting interventions in the management decisions of the NSTP-JDA. Thirdly, the findings indicated the need for improvement in the audit procedures and communication culture between local communities and NSTP-JDZ operators. Lastly, there was a body of opinion that employment practices within the zone were unfair. In addition to identifying the above deficiencies in the governance system, the study has identified and analysed differences in views on governance issues between key stakeholders in the zone. These differences are important as they may well pinpoint why the governance system is deficient and, more importantly, reveal how the governance system can be improved. The vested interests of stakeholders are known to shape stakeholder views and, when there are stakeholders from different countries representing their nation’s interests, these differences can be acute; the findings may be extrapolated to other joint development zones although the various characteristics of the parties involved in each zone will affect the degree to which it is applicable. Finally, the study may have significant economic consequences for both Nigeria and the São Tomé and Príncipe - bearing in mind the importance of oil resources to both countries.
