50|$|<b>Hydrotrope</b> is a {{compound}} that solubilises hydrophobic compounds in aqueous solutions (by means other than micellar solubilization). Typically, hydrotropes {{consist of a}} hydrophilic part and a hydrophobic part (like surfactants) but the hydrophobic part is generally too small to cause spontaneous self-aggregation.Hydrotropes do not have a critical concentration above which self-aggregation 'suddenly' starts to occur (as found for micelle- and vesicle-forming surfactants, which have a critical micelle concentration or cmc and a critical vesicle concentration or cvc, respectively). Instead, some hydrotropes aggregate in a step-wise self-aggregation process, gradually increasing aggregation size. However, many hydrotropes do not seem to self-aggregate at all, unless a solubilisate has been added. Hydrotropes are in use industrially. Examples of hydrotropes include sodium p-toluenesulfonate and sodium xylene sulfonate.|$|E
40|$|The {{signature}} of hydrotropic solubilisation is the sigmoidal solubility curve; when plotted against <b>hydrotrope</b> concentration, solubility increases suddenly after the minimum <b>hydrotrope</b> concentration (MHC), and reaches a plateau at higher <b>hydrotrope</b> concentrations.

Here we develop a theory, derived from the first principles of statistical thermodynamics using partially-open ensembles, to identify the origin of hydrophobic cooperativity. Our theory bears a close resemblance to the cooperative binding model used for protein-ligand binding.

40|$|The {{presented}} paper introduces {{an attempt}} for finding a theoretical model capable for describing the critical aggregation concentration (cac) for some <b>hydrotropes</b> (a series of sodium-p-n-alkylbenzoates, n= 0 - 8). Such a proposal {{was carried out}} through theoretical calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) for estimating some physical properties which might be helpful for supporting the recent published report as all of these <b>hydrotropes</b> are considered as surfactant like (see doi: 10. 1021 /la 2025846). The estimated physical properties can be divided to three classes according to their effect: steric properties such as volume and surface area, electronic properties such as polarizability, and hydrophobic properties such as log P which represents the ratio of concentrations of a compound in two phases of octanol and water. The results show that both steric and hydrophobic properties play major roles in predicting the cac for the presented <b>hydrotropes.</b> The best model was found between cac and tail polarizability (PT) according to the following relation: cac = 1. 52 - 1. 09 log PT; with r 2 equal to  0. 96, S.

40|$|Poor aqueous {{solubilities}} of drug candidates {{limit their}} bioavailability. A number of delivery systems are in use {{to enhance the}} bioavailability of the drugs with poor solubility in water. The self-assemblies of <b>hydrotropes,</b> surfactants and oil/water micro emulsions may provide a means of enhancing solubility and enhance bioavailability of drugs. Although these drugs delivery systems are in use but the mechanism through which these delivery systems solubilize the drugs needs detail investigations. The objective of the current dissertation was to provide {{the understanding of the}} mechanism through which simple aggregates of <b>hydrotropes,</b> micelle of surfactants and oil in water microemulsions solubilize the drugs. For the purpose, apparent solubility of drugs namely, Meloxicam, Celecoxib, Ibuprofen and Lidocaine was determined in aqueous solution of <b>hydrotropes,</b> surfactants, surfactant/hydrotrope, surfactants/butanol mixtures and in oil/ water microemulsions. These mediums were tested for their ability to enhance the aqueous solubility of these water insoluble drugs. The results obtained for molar solubilization ratio (MSR), partition co-efficient (KM) of the investigated drugs concluded that these were lower in <b>hydrotropes</b> as compared to the one obtained in other stated systems. Among the <b>hydrotropes,</b> sodium benzoate showed highest (0. 006 - 0. 0107), whereas sodium p-toluene sulfonate (0. 0014 - 0. 0052) the lowest MSR values. The negative values obtained for ï¿½„Go illustrated the spontaneous mixing of these drugs in all the investigated systems. The CMC, HLB, oxyethylene units and aggregation number of surfactants along with molecular mass of the drug, polarity of the drug and the group attached to them showed a great impact over the solubility of two model drugs, Meloxicam and Celecoxib in nonionic surfactants including Tween 20, Tween 80, Brij 30, Brij 35, Triton X- 100, and Triton X- 114. It was noted that the surfactants with high aggregation number solubilized higher amount of drugs and had higher value of MSR than others. The solubility was enhanced with the increase in number of oxyethylene units in a surfactant. The solubility was also increased with the increase in number of carbon atoms in alkyl chain of surfactants used. Similar results were observed when Lidocaine was solubilized in ionic, nonionic and zwitterionic surfactants. Among the nonionic, N,N, Dimethyledodecyle amine-N-Oxide (DDAO) whereas among ionic and zwitterionic surfactants, N,N, Dimethyldodecyle- amonio propane-sulfonate (DDAPS) surfactants showed higher ability to solubilize the model drug, Lidocaine. The addition of <b>hydrotropes</b> and/or butanol to aqueous solution of DDAPS showed a noticeable increase in solubility of all the investigated drugs. In case of oil/ water microemulsion, the increase in molecular mass of oil in a homologous series increased the solubility of drugs. It was also noticed that microemulsions had highest ability to solubilize the drugs among all the investigated systems. The results obtained by light scattering revealed that the addition of drugs does not increase the aggregation number and hydrodynamic radius of the surfactants micelles. However, both the aggregation number and size was increased by the addition of butanol and <b>hydrotropes.</b> The addition of hydrocarbon to the DDAPS/butanol mixture resulted a decrease in micellar size as well as the aggregation number. Similar observations were also made for aggregation number and hydrodynamic radius in case of Menthol or Eutectic mixtures of Lidocaine/Menthol used as an oil phase. All these observations concluded that the drugs are solubilized in inner core of micelles/aggregates of the surfactants/hydrotropes. However in case of oil/water microemulsions these were solubilized only in oil phase of microemulsions...|$|R

40|$|The {{properties}} {{of a series}} of aliphatic and aromatic carboxylates and phenolate mimicking functional groups of humic acid is discussed as far as their behavior in aqueous solutions close to the surface is concerned. Both surface tension measurements and MD simulations confirm that sodium formate behaves in accord with the classical theory of surfaces of electrolytes, whereas sodium acetate and, much more pronounced, sodium benzoate and sodium phenolate show a more hydrotropic behavior with surface active anions. Further to the surface tension data, the MD results suggest that these <b>hydrotropes</b> are highly oriented at the solution-vapor interface. ...|$|R

We have chosen a series of short-chain alcohols as <b>hydrotropes</b> and benzyl alcohol, limonene and a hydrophobic azo-dye (Disperse Red 13) as organic compounds to be dissolved. A very weak pre-structuring is found for ethanol/H 2 O and 2 -propanol/H 2 O mixtures. Pre-structuring is most developed for binary 1 -propanol/H 2 O and tert-butanol/H 2 O mixtures and supports the bicontinuity model of alcohol-rich and water-rich domains as already postulated by Anisimov et al. Such a pre-structuring leads to a high solubilisation power for poorly water miscible components (limonene and Disperse Red, characterized by high octanol/water partition coefficients, log(P) values of 4. 5 and 4. 85), whereas a very weak pre-structuring leads to a high solubilisation power for slightly water miscible components (benzyl alcohol). This difference in solubilisation power can be linked to (i) the formation of mesoscale structures in the cases of ethanol and 2 -propanol and (ii) the extension of pre-structures in the cases of 1 -propanol and tert-butanol. Three different solubilisation mechanisms could be identified: bulk solubilisation, interface solubilisation and a combination of both. These supramolecular structures in binary and ternary systems were investigated by small-and-wide-angle X-ray and neutron scattering, dynamic light scattering and conductivity measurements (in the presence of small amounts of salt...|$|R
