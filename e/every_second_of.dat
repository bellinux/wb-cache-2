25|$|As of 2008, {{blogging}} {{had become}} such a mania that a new blog was created <b>every</b> <b>second</b> <b>of</b> every minute of every hour of every day. Researchers have actively analyzed the dynamics of how blogs become popular. There are essentially two measures of this: popularity through citations, as well as popularity through affiliation (i.e., blogroll). The basic conclusion from studies {{of the structure of}} blogs is that while it takes time for a blog to become popular through blogrolls, permalinks can boost popularity more quickly, and are perhaps more indicative of popularity and authority than blogrolls, since they denote that people are actually reading the blog's content and deem it valuable or noteworthy in specific cases.|$|E

25|$|After {{the ship}} has reached its {{cruising}} speed of 0.8c, each twin would see 1second {{pass in the}} received image of the other twin for every 3seconds of his own time. That is, each would see {{the image of the}} other's clock going slow, not just slow by the ε factor 0.6, but even slower because light-time-delay is increasing 0.8seconds per second. This is shown in the figures by red light paths. At some point, the images received by each twin change so that each would see 3seconds pass in the image for <b>every</b> <b>second</b> <b>of</b> his own time. That is, the received signal has been increased in frequency by the Doppler shift. These high frequency images are shown in the figures by blue light paths.|$|E
25|$|In the 2005 Tour de France, Landis {{finished}} ninth {{overall in}} the General classification, his highest finish in the tour at that time.

Winning Paris–Nice gave Landis 52 points in the UCI ProTour individual competition, starting him off in first place for 2006. Landis continued his display of strength with another overall win in the Ford Tour de Georgia, which took place from April 18 to April 23.

500|$|CTW's {{researchers}} were {{strongly influenced by}} behaviorism, a popular movement in psychology during the late 1960s; therefore, many methods and tools used were primarily behavioral. Palmer developed [...] "the distractor", which he used to test if the material shown on Sesame Street captured young viewers' attention. Two children at a time were brought into the laboratory and shown an episode on a television monitor and a slide show next to it. The slides would change every seven seconds; researchers recorded when the children's attention was diverted from the episode. They were able to assess almost <b>every</b> <b>second</b> <b>of</b> Sesame Street this way; if an episode captured children's interest 80–90 {{percent of the time}}, producers would air it. However, if it only worked 50 percent of the time they would change (or remove) content.|$|E
500|$|Though {{he was a}} keen sportsman and {{a highly}} {{regarded}} member of the high school's cricket and rugby teams, he disliked his educational experience; according to Waters, [...] "I hated <b>every</b> <b>second</b> <b>of</b> it, apart from games. The regime at school was a very oppressive one... the same kids who are susceptible to bullying by other kids are also susceptible to bullying by the teachers." [...] Whereas Waters knew Barrett and Gilmour from his childhood in Cambridge, he met future Pink Floyd founder members Nick Mason and Richard Wright in London at the Regent Street Polytechnic (later the University of Westminster) school of architecture. Waters enrolled there in 1962, {{after a series of}} aptitude tests indicated he was well-suited to that field. He had initially considered a career in mechanical engineering.|$|E

500|$|Palmer and his team's {{approach}} to researching the show's effectiveness was innovative; {{it was the}} first time formative research was conducted in this way. [...] For example, Palmer developed [...] "the distractor", which he used to test if the material shown on Sesame Street captured young viewers' attention. [...] Two children at a time were brought into the laboratory; they were shown an episode on a television monitor and a slide show next to it. [...] The slides would change every seven seconds, and researchers recorded when the children's attention was diverted away from the episode. [...] They were able to record almost <b>every</b> <b>second</b> <b>of</b> Sesame Street this way; if the episode captured the children's interest 80–90% of the time, the producers would air it, but if it only tested 50%, they would reshoot.

500|$|Despite {{not being}} as {{acclaimed}} as its second season, {{reception of the}} first season was still generally positive. Despite giving the Edifying Ed-Ventures DVD a negative review, IGN's Mike Drucker praised the show, saying: [...] "Every bit {{of the show is}} played for the maximum comic effect, and the interactions between the characters are usually very fun," [...] and particularly praised the season finale, [...] "Avast Ye Eds", saying that it is a [...] "good example of how the animators developed a clever, surreal environment that most kids could probably relate to. They simply go wild and allow regular childhood adventures turn into comedic epics, very over-the-top, but still linked to the way that kids act and react to strange situations." [...] While calling it a [...] "gem" [...] and of [...] "entertaining nature", he criticized the storylines as [...] "repetitive" [...] and said the show [...] "lacks the genius of SpongeBob".

500|$|The {{episode title}} is a {{reference}} to the television series The Man from U.N.C.L.E. and the town of Jupiter, Florida, which is where Reynolds spent most of his childhood. Sterling proclaims that his career path was largely influenced by Reynolds' film career, particularly his work in the musical film At Long Last Love (1975) and the spy cinema Operation C.I.A. (1965). Reed stated, [...] "Archer says [...] Operation C.I.A. is why [...] became a spy. And [...] like, 'Really, I thought that movie sucked.'" [...] A sequence which features Sterling strapping Reynolds onto a handtruck reflects homage to the thriller film The Silence of the Lambs (1991). The song [...] "East Bound and Down" [...] by Jerry Reed is presented in the episode, while Sterling makes several references to several American cinematic works from the 1970s. Jesse Carp of Cinema Blend wrote: [...] "I should start by saying that this episode played particularly well for me because I’m a huge fan of 1970s American cinema—the good and the bad—so all of those references that Archer soon starts throwing at Reynolds, I'm catching and loving <b>every</b> <b>second</b> <b>of</b> it." [...] "The Man from Jupiter" [...] contains several scenes that are reminiscent to those in the action film Gator (1976). Carp wrote that [...] "it isn't long before the Reynolds' sweet talking and charisma mesmerizes Archer and soon the pair are talking plot possibilities for the last film in the Gator trilogy." ...|$|E
500|$|Performer Neal Medlyn re-enacted the DVD {{during his}} {{performance}} at the New Museum in April 2008 together with dancers Will Rawls and Erick Montes. His performance was one-hour long and it was titled The Neal Medlyn Experience Live. He sang along to the DVD audio track, complete with word-for-word between-song patter and band introductions. Booth Newspapers' Roger LeLeivre reviewed the re-enactment positively writing, [...] "The event... was a hoot, and the audience loved <b>every</b> <b>second</b> <b>of</b> it. Medlyn has Beyoncé's signature, often spastic, moves down pat, down to each minute hand gesture and facial expression... Unlike a drag show, Medlyn does not try to convince anyone they are seeing Beyoncé. There wasn't {{much in the way}} of costumes (well, he did enter in a black wig, tube top and hot pants, but those bit the dust rather quickly), and why bother?". He concluded that the length of the show was [...] "perfect" [...] as it [...] "ended before the shtick wore out its welcome". LeLeivre finished his review by writing, [...] "It was a delicious pop-culture skewering, right down to the back-up dancers, with their over-the-top moves and expressions... Clearly it enhanced the 'experience,' if you had a passing acquaintance with Beyoncé's songs... but such knowledge was not a prerequisite to enjoying this homage". Claudia La Rocco of The New York Times described his re-enactment as [...] "absurdly faithful" [...] and added that it wouldn't have been nearly as [...] "smart or touching" [...] without the dancing of Rawls and Montes. She further put the performance in her list of the [...] "richest" [...] moments of 2008 and noted, [...] "These astounding performers slipped between genders and among genres, enveloping Mr. Medlyn in utter fabulousness and proving just how sophisticated pop culture can be. Backup dancers everywhere should feel proud." ...|$|E
500|$|Writing in The Independent, Cathy Pryor declared, [...] "Louis Theroux is out-oddballed {{this week}} by {{the subject of his}} latest {{documentary}} ... Astonishingly, Theroux makes you feel some sympathy for them and the price they pay for being the way they are." [...] Thomas Sutcliffe of The Independent posited that viewers were [...] "... wondering, after an hour, whether the Phelps hadn't got a bit more out of it than Louis. They aren't representative of anything but themselves, after all, and they rejoice in the world's detestation. So they had nothing to lose by being held up to ridicule, and gained exactly what they want – a bigger audience for their insane rantings." [...] Writing for The Daily Record, Paul English wrote favorably, [...] "The journalist in me marvels at yet more great work from Theroux. But the human in me mourns that we gave this appalling family exactly what they want. The shiny badge of notoriety..." [...] A review in the Irish Independent was critical of giving any coverage to the group, [...] "Theroux tried to get the teenage daughters to deviate from the standard family line but they weren't budging an inch. The end result was that a group of loathsome people who spend <b>every</b> <b>second</b> <b>of</b> their lives trying to attract free publicity for themselves got a whole hour of it courtesy of the BBC. Ah, the joys of public service television." [...] Writing for The Observer, Kathryn Flett was critical of the choice of title for the documentary, commenting, [...] "The Most Hated Family in America? Says who? Louis Theroux? BBC2? Ooh, I don't like a sweeping statement of a documentary title. Not that the family who comprise the majority of the 71 congregants of the Westboro Baptist Church of Topeka, Kansas, aren't appalling, but the title definitely infers that they are the family most hated by most Americans, when I doubt most Americans have the faintest idea who they are." [...] Mike Bradley of The Observer commented about the film, [...] "A shock doc, but an easy target for Theroux." ...|$|E
