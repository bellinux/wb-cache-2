40|$|During {{the archaeological}} {{research}} of some XVI – XVII century possessions ’ of Kaunas old-town there were found marble statuary fragments and architectural decorations ’ elements. The {{aim of the}} present research was to prepare assumptions {{for the study of}} art and historical research of the discovered statuary and architectural decoration elements. It was important to determine mineral composition of the historical statuary fragments, as well as to analyse and describe weathering processes of their rock and to determine the original location of statuary raw materials. The majority of identified statuary fragments were chiselled from marble and some, supposedly, architectural decoration elements, from dolomite of foreign origin. Because of the lack of comparable marble and dolomite rock samples the determination of the discovered statuary fragments ’ raw rock’s original locations (quarries) was impossible. The research results confirmed the assumptions about presence of rock in the surface cultural soil layer for a long time. The results of analysis of soil found in the statuary <b>fixing</b> <b>hole</b> proved that the statuary laid in the soil of Kaunas city or its regions. The results of instrumental researche have not answered to the main question – who {{is the author of the}} broken statuary and in which historical period they were chiselled. The search of these answers is a task for qualified experts of study of art and purposeful historical-archival approach of analysis...|$|E

We conducted this study to evaluate theclinical usefulness of ultrasound-aided fixation {{as compared with the}} conventional fixationmethod using a drill and an expanderin patientswith ZMfracture. Methods  We conducted a retrospective study in 35 patientswith ZMfracturewho had beentreated at our hospital during a period ranging fromMarch of 2008 toDecember of 2010. Wedivided them into two groups: an ultrasound-aided fixation group, comprising 13 patientswho underwent ultrasound-aided fixation (SonicWeld Rx, KLS Martin), and a conventionalgroup, comprising 22 patients who underwent conventional fixation (Biosorb FX, LinvatecBiomaterials Ltd.). We compared such variables as sex, direction, age at operation, follow-upperiod, operation duration, number of <b>fixed</b> <b>holes,</b> and time to discharge between the twogroups. Results  The ultrasound-aided fixation reduced the operation duration by about 30 minutesas comparedwith that of conventional fixation.
