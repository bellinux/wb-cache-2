25|$|The Northerner was {{the first}} of the {{substantially}} overhauled carriage trains to be fitted with a new type of bogie of Korean manufacture, which offered a superior quality ride to its Timken-built predecessors, classed X25330. The new bogies, classed X28020 by NZR, were based on the Kinki bogies as well as bogies, classed X28250 by NZR, used underneath the Silver Star cars. Substantial work was carried out on all 19 carriage underframes to facilitate the 38 bogies' placement underneath. The underframes were raised to make easier the fitting of the newer bogies, and <b>drawgear</b> lowered the same distance.|$|E
2500|$|The 'grassgrubs' were ill-fated. Their <b>drawgear</b> {{and bodies}} were not {{designed}} to be locomotive-hauled and they quickly wore out. [...] By 1985 they had been withdrawn from service due to metal fatigue. [...] Most of the passenger runs were continued after their demise, but the New Plymouth-Taumarunui service ended in 1983 (having already had its rollingstock replaced by 56ft cars), and Minister of Rail, Richard Prebble ended the Gisborne service in 1985 because of even lower patronage and by the late 1980s the Wellington-Wairarapa service was abbreviated to terminate in Masterton as patronage on the Masterton - Palmerston North section was often fewer than 20 passengers per trip, due to improved highways and bus services. [...] The AC class vehicles were replaced by NZR 56-foot carriages on the remaining Wellington-Napier, Picton-Christchurch, Wairarapa and Christchurch-Greymouth services.|$|E

50|$|Both Class 18 {{locomotives}} were withdrawn by 1951. After their locomotives were {{withdrawn from}} service, the two Type HT tenders had their mechanical stokers removed and their <b>drawgear</b> modified {{for use with}} Class 15CA locomotives. They were then redesignated Type KT.|$|E
50|$|After their {{locomotives}} were {{withdrawn from}} service, the Type HT tenders {{of the two}} Class 18 2-10-2 Henschel Giants had their mechanical stokers removed and their <b>drawgear</b> modified for use with Class 15CA locomotives. These two tenders were then redesignated Type KT as well.|$|E
50|$|The {{locomotives}} {{were delivered}} with Type MP1 tenders with a coal capacity of 10 lt t and a water capacity of 4250 imp gal. The same tender {{was used by}} altogether sixteen locomotive classes, but those of the Class MC1 were fitted with a radial type of <b>drawgear.</b>|$|E
5000|$|After their {{locomotives}} were {{withdrawn from}} {{service in the}} early 1950s, the two Type HT tenders had their mechanical stokers removed and their <b>drawgear</b> modified for use with Class 15CA locomotives.

50|$|Meanwhile, <b>drawgear</b> of new {{rolling stock}} {{is being built}} at a height {{suitable}} for conversion. The proposed European C-AKv freight coupler {{is compatible with the}} SA3 coupler but adds integrated air and electrical connections. This standard would need to be revised to allow for the unforeseen development of electronically controlled pneumatic brakes.|$|E
50|$|As built, the {{locomotive}} {{had a single}} feedwater pump, fitted to the centre frame stretcher and driven by an eccentric on {{the centre of the}} driving axle. The buffing and <b>drawgear</b> were centrally arranged, with Johnston link-and-pin couplers without buffers instead of the buffers-and-chain which had been used on the three broad gauge Natal Railway Company locomotives.|$|E

50|$|Before {{entering}} {{service in}} New South Wales the 4 locos were fitted with buffers and hook <b>drawgear</b> to NSWGR standards. The cab profile was also altered to fit within the New South Wales loading gauge. It seems {{that only one}} unit was used at the Dunheved facility. Being of the hood type, with a central cab, they could work in either direction without turning.|$|E
50|$|The {{length of}} a train, {{including}} the longest trains, may be measured in number of wagons (for bulk loads such as coal and iron ore) or in metres for general freight. Train lengths and loads on electrified railways, especially lower voltage 3000 V DC and 1500 V DC, are limited by traction power considerations. <b>Drawgear</b> and couplings can be a limiting factor, tied in with curves, gradients and crossing loop lengths.|$|E
50|$|The 50 kV AC 50 Hz Class 15E is {{the product}} of a joint venture by Mitsui who was {{responsible}} for the design, Toshiba who supplied the electrical components, the RSD division of DCD-Dorbyl who supplied the monoblock cast frame, bolster bogies and <b>drawgear,</b> and Union Carriage & Wagon (UCW) in Nigel who constructed the bodies. It was manufactured for Transnet Freight Rail (TFR) by UCW who delivered the first locomotives in 2010.|$|E
5000|$|The only {{modifications}} {{required to}} these locomotives {{for them to}} be put to work on the SAR were to the buffing and <b>drawgear.</b> As built, they had 12 in diameter [...] "bull's eyes" [...] acetylene gas headlamps, powered from a generator affixed to the running board on the right hand side adjoining the smokebox. The same medium was used for the cab lighting, but these lights were removed and smaller headlamps were installed.|$|E
50|$|When {{goods traffic}} commenced, the wagons were {{attached}} to the last passenger train of the day, but when the line was opened to Basingstoke a dedicated goods train was run. The guard travelled in a vehicle called a Noah's Ark, in which sundries and parcels were carried. The <b>drawgear</b> had no springing, and starting a heavy train was usually achieved by setting back on to a scotch, so as to slacken all the couplings, and then to start forward.|$|E
50|$|A strong chassis is {{required}} to both support the extra ballast weight and pulling forces transmitted by the drawbar. A reinforced chassis also allows multiple tractors to be coupled together to maximize power and traction. Heavy-duty versions of commercial tractor units may be fitted with a ballast box and suitable <b>drawgear,</b> or a ballast tractor may be purpose-built. Ballast is placed above the driving axle, or spread out over multiple driving axles to maximize traction on each and evenly distribute its load.|$|E
5000|$|The {{greatest}} {{benefit of}} Distributed Power—and {{the reason for}} development of the original concept—is the reduction of <b>drawgear</b> draft forces, permitting the doubling {{in the size of}} trains without exceeding draw-gear strength, through the use of mid- or rear-train locomotives. There are also potential train handling benefits; over an undulating track profile, a skillful engineer can manipulate the relative power outputs (as well as dynamic and air brake applications) to minimize run-in and run-out of coupler slack throughout the train." ...|$|E
50|$|In 1998, Tasman {{decided to}} sell its {{locomotive}} back to Tranz Rail, who would then take over the duties of shunting the Kawerau yard with more conventional shunting locomotives. As a result, DA 512 was sold to Tranz Rail, who immediately moved it to Hutt Workshops for further alterations {{to make it more}} suitable as a heavy shunting locomotive. This included fitting shunter's refuges {{at either end of the}} locomotive, and extended <b>drawgear</b> to accommodate the extra length of the refuges, as well as a repaint in the then-current 'Cato Blue' livery.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, rail {{operator}} Tranz Rail began experimenting {{with the use}} of diesel traction through the Otira Tunnel, using modified DX class locomotives with low-level intakes and modified <b>drawgear</b> (locomotives modified in this manner were later reclassified DXC). It was decided that the use of an extraction fan and tunnel doors would be sufficient to allow diesel operation, and so {{the decision was made to}} decommission the Otira electrification which was no longer capable of meeting modern requirements, and was also largely worn out after 74 years of heavy use.|$|E
50|$|The Double Fairlie was {{the first}} {{articulated}} locomotive to enter service in South Africa and also the first to have Walschaerts valve gear, which had been invented in 1844 by Belgian locomotive foreman Egide Walschaerts. The locomotive which was acquired by the CGR was of the separate boiler type. It had two boiler barrels, with a central firebox common to both barrels and fired from the side. The buffing and <b>drawgear</b> were fitted on the two engine units. The pivots were located under the two boiler saddles and were carried on centre bearings which formed part of the engine unit frames.|$|E

50|$|The {{engine was}} tended {{by a new}} Type JT1 tender, built with an {{underframe}} and bogies identical {{to those of the}} Type JT tender. As on the Type GT tender of the Class S, the top sides of the Type JT1 tender’s coal bunker were set inwards to afford the crew the maximum rearward field of vision. The front of the engine and the back of the tender were fitted with modified and strengthened draft gear. The intermediate <b>drawgear</b> between engine and tender was similar in design to that of the Class 15F. The engine and tender were both fitted with vacuum brakes.|$|E
5000|$|The {{official}} SAR diagram book {{contains an}} annotation with the Type XE1 drawing {{to the effect}} that tender no. 552, a three-axle Type YC tender off a SAR Class 6C locomotive, was added to the type in 1956. While the reason is not apparent from the document, it could only have been {{as a result of a}} modification of the tender's engine <b>drawgear</b> which would place it in the [...] "X_" [...] tender group and of the tender being fitted with a larger water tank which would place it in the [...] "_E" [...] tender group.|$|E
50|$|The {{trailing}} bogie {{was moved}} 30 in back and engine was fitted with American <b>drawgear.</b> But {{this did not}} work. In 1937, Bihta accident occurred with the engine jumping the tracks and derailing at 60 mph. The tracks were twisted like noodles. 100 people lost their lives. The Pacific Locomotive Committee was formed on public demand. Robert Leguille {{came up with a}} solution. He decided to fit leading and trailing bogie with stiffer side springs and better damping. He was proven right with experiments. The Bombay, Baroda and Central India Railway and Madras and Southern Mahratta Railway followed his advice and EIR restricted the engines to slow-speed trains.|$|E
5000|$|An {{example of}} how one code word {{replaced}} many normal words in a sentence, and the longest code message in the library was Ryzy the translation as follows; [...] Vehicle No ..... may be worked forward to ..... behind the brakevan of a suitable goods train during daylight provided locomotive branch certifies fit to travel. If the damaged vehicle is fitted with automatic coupling it must only be worked forward behind a brakevan also fitted with automatic coupling by connecting the automatic couplers on each vehicle but, if fitted with ordinary <b>drawgear,</b> it must be screw coupled. Westinghouse brake {{to be in use}} throughout train and on damaged vehicle. Guard to be given written instructions to carefully watch vehicle en route.|$|E
50|$|In 1960, {{when all}} the SWA narrow-gauge lines were widened to Cape gauge, the Class Hd and Class NG5 {{locomotives}} were withdrawn from service while the 21 Class NG15 locomotives were all shipped to Port Elizabeth for use on the Langkloof line to Avontuur. The first one was offloaded in Port Elizabeth in April 1961, still equipped with a single central buffer and side chains, the preferred <b>drawgear</b> on the ex-German lines in SWA. Their arrival {{increased the number of}} locomotives on the Avontuur Railway from a total of 23 in March 1961 to 43 by July. As a result, {{all but one of the}} Class NG10 as well as Class NG G11 no. 51, South Africa’s first Garratt, were withdrawn from service by July 1962.|$|E
5000|$|AB 608 Passchendaele was {{donated by}} NZR to the NZR&LS in 1967 as the class {{leader of the}} AB class. It was towed to Ferrymead in 1972, and {{remained}} there until 1993, when Steam Incorporated of Paekakariki indicated an interest in leasing and restoring 608. It was towed to Wellington {{as part of a}} Steam Inc excursion in 1993, and work began to restore the locomotive in 1997 with the stripping of the engine unit for restoration. The locomotive has since received a new tender body, and been fitted with stronger 'Janney yoke' <b>drawgear</b> to facilitate towing of the locomotive by mainline freight train if necessary. Ab 608 was re-commission on 25 April 2014 is now operational and mainline certified.|$|E
50|$|The Indian {{locomotive}} class XB was a 4-6-2 (or Pacific) {{passenger locomotive}} with a 17 LT axle load. It {{had a lot}} of problems. It was built with the help of British Engineering Standards Association (BESA). It was up to date as any locomotive in England. It had American 3-point suspension with compensating levers for indifferent tracks in India. The trailing wheels were mounted on a Cartazzi truck as it was for the rest of British Pacifics at the time. Goodall-type <b>drawgear</b> was fitted between engine and tender to facilitate free movement. They still proved to be successful as they survived till the 1980s. The modifications in India to this class was implemented in LMS Railway in UK. Copper firebox had combustion chamber extension.|$|E

5000|$|Due to a {{locomotive}} shortage {{because of the}} planned replacement of AN Tasrails English Electric locomotive fleet, twelve DQs and three QRs were sold to the company. DQs 6007, 6330, 6353 and QR 3032, along with eight 1460 class locomotives, were sold to Tasrail. The three DQs were modified for service in Tasmania, while QR 3032 had its short-hood lowered as a DQ. The eight 1460s were fully rebuilt as DQs, with some being undergoing rebuilding when they were sold. Originally the three QRs were on a one year lease, but were later sold. The modifications made to the units were changing the <b>drawgear</b> back to the originally Queensland Railways standard height, increasing the fuel tank capacity, relocate the battery boxes, installation of a sludge tank and engine room sump pan, fitting of the [...] "Kaitiaki" [...] vigilance, fitting of ZTR electronic anti-wheelslip technology and upgrading dynamic brakes. The locos were also were renumbered in the 2000 series, and tested between Wellington and Palmerston North.|$|E
