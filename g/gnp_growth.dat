After a mild economic slump in the mid-1980s, Japan's economy began a period of expansion in 1986 that continued until it again entered a recessionary period in 1992. Economic growth averaging 5% between 1987 and 1989 revived industries, such as steel and construction, which had been relatively dormant in the mid-1980s, and brought record salaries and employment. In 1992, however, Japan's real <b>GNP</b> <b>growth</b> slowed to 1.7%. Even industries such as automobiles and electronics that had experienced phenomenal growth in the 1980s entered a recessionary period in 1992. The domestic market for Japanese automobiles shrank {{at the same time}} that Japan's share of the United States' market declined. Foreign and domestic demand for Japanese electronics also declined, and Japan seemed on the way to losing its leadership in the world semiconductor market to the United States, Korea and Taiwan.|$|E

Reforms have further decentralized the M-form economy along regional lines, which provided flexibility and opportunities for carrying out regional experiments, for the rise of non-state enterprises, and for the emergence of markets. This is why China's non-state sector share of industrial output increased from 22 % in 1978 to 47 % in 1991 and its private sector's share from zero to about 10 %, both being achieved without mass privatization and changes in the political system...|$|R

Statistical agencies should continue to collect data on environmental quality and to value changes in environmental capital in the context of national resource accounting.

40|$|Abstract: The global {{financial}} unrest {{over the last}} decade has shifted the attention of banking regulators (Basel II, 2001) in estimating default probabilities for a variety of borrowers. Within a binary choice panel data framework, the current study analyzes various models and cross-examines their performance in identifying financial crises in emerging markets. Using financial ratios, macroeconomic variables, and international factors, the paper identifies a set of warning indicators and discriminates among the three estimators employed. The most important determinants of commercial/official arrears and reschedulings are the debt-to-GDP ratio, inflation, trade liberalization, and the variability of <b>GNP</b> per capita <b>growth.</b> In addition to that, changes in financial flows from foreign investors do affect default frequencies, while external developments are found to be insignificant. Cross-modeling comparison indicates the presence of different exogenous risk factors, depending on the approach employed. Further analysis indicates the presence of heterogeneity, but pertinent estimators fail to perform well. Unlike the fixed- and random-effects estimators, the pooled-logit model yields the minimum number of misclassifications. When past credit performance is taken into account, the significance of some signals is reduced, but the model’s misclassification performance is markedly enhanced...|$|R

The empirical evidence suggests that countries with {{a large share of}} primary exports in <b>GNP</b> have bad <b>growth</b> records and high inequality, especially if the quality of institutions {{and the rule of law}} are bad. The economic argument that a resource bonanza induces appreciation of the real exchange rate and a decline of non-resource export sectors may have some relevance. More important, a resource boom reinforces rent grabbing, especially if institutions are bad, and keeps in place bad policies. Optimal resource management may make use of the Hoteling rule and the Hartwick rule. However, a recent World Bank study suggests that resource rich economies squander their natural resource wealth and more often have negative genuine saving rates.
