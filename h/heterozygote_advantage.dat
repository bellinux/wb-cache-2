5|$|Alternatively, {{selection}} can {{be divided}} according to its effect on genetic diversity. Purifying or negative selection acts to remove genetic variation from the population (and is opposed by de novo mutation, which introduces new variation. In contrast, balancing selection acts to maintain genetic variation in a population, {{even in the absence}} of de novo mutation, by negative frequency-dependent selection. One mechanism for this is <b>heterozygote</b> <b>advantage,</b> where individuals with two different alleles have a selective advantage over individuals with just one allele. The polymorphism at the human ABO blood group locus has been explained in this way.|$|E
5|$|Hybrids are not {{as might}} be {{expected}} always intermediate between their parents (as if there were blending inheritance), but are sometimes stronger than either parent variety, a phenomenon called heterosis, hybrid vigour, or <b>heterozygote</b> <b>advantage.</b> This is most common with plant hybrids. A transgressive phenotype is a phenotype that displays more extreme characteristics than either of the parent lines. Plant breeders use several techniques to produce hybrids, including line breeding and the formation of complex hybrids. An economically important example is hybrid maize (corn), which provides a considerable seed yield advantage over open pollinated varieties. Hybrid seed dominates the commercial maize seed market in the United States, Canada and many other major maize-producing countries.|$|E
5|$|Some {{forms of}} {{balancing}} selection do {{not result in}} fixation, but maintain an allele at intermediate frequencies in a population. This can occur in diploid species (with pairs of chromosomes) when heterozygous individuals (with just one copy of the allele) have a higher fitness than homozygous individuals (with two copies). This is called <b>heterozygote</b> <b>advantage</b> or over-dominance, of which the best-known example is the resistance to malaria in humans heterozygous for sickle-cell anaemia. Maintenance of allelic variation can also occur through disruptive or diversifying selection, which favours genotypes that depart from the average in either direction (that is, the opposite of over-dominance), and {{can result in a}} bimodal distribution of trait values. Finally, balancing selection can occur through frequency-dependent selection, where the fitness of one particular phenotype depends on the distribution of other phenotypes in the population. The principles of game theory have been applied to understand the fitness distributions in these situations, particularly in the study of kin selection and the evolution of reciprocal altruism.|$|E

The aim of our study was to characterize, for the first time, the genetic composition of this breed in relation to its known source populations. We sequenced the hypervariable part of the mtDNA control region and genotyped the Amelogenin gene, four sex-linked microsatellites and 39 autosomal microsatellites in 79 Czechoslovakian Wolfdogs, 20 German Shepherds and 28 Carpathian wolves. We performed a range of population genetic analyses based on both empirical and simulated data. Only two mtDNA and two Y-linked haplotypes were found in Czechoslovakian Wolfdogs. Both mtDNA haplotypes were of domestic origin, while only one of the Y-haplotypes was shared with German Shepherds and the other was unique to Czechoslovakian Wolfdogs.

The semi-dominant autosomal black gene survived in 26 out of 40 cultures {{by the end of the}} experiment, demonstrating its selective advantage at these very low frequencies. The gene increased from an initial frequency of 0. 002 to 0. 055 (at generation 11) in at least one replicate.

The observations only partially fitted expectation based on a branching process model.

40|$|In {{a closed}} population, mating of related {{individuals}} (inbreeding) occurs because {{of only a}} few number of ancestors. Related individuals have an increased proportion of their genome in common. The probability for the offspring increases to inherit the same allele of one common ancestor from each of the parents and to be homozygous for the locus. The closer the relationship of the parents the faster the proportion of homozygous loci rises in the progeny. Based on these relations, the inbreeding coefficient F (Wright 1921) reflects the increase of homozygosity in a population or the expected proportion of allele pairs identical by descent for an individual, respectively. Beside this estimation method, individual homozygosity can be measured directly with different genetic markers in chickens, for example with RFLP, with protein polymorphism or with microsatellite markers. The objective of the presented study was to analyse genetic variability in a closed New Hampshire line by comparison of estimated (by inbreeding coefficients) and realized (by microsatellite analysis) inbreeding. The New Hampshire line was maintained at the research station of the institute of Animal Sciences, Humboldt-University of Berlin near Berlin/Germany since 1955. Divided into 15 sublines, the hens (10 to 15 per subline) were mated in a rotation system once a year in order to avoid close inbreeding. The individual inbreeding coefficients F (Wright) were estimated including complete pedigree data of about 8100 chickens. For the molecular analysis, DNA was isolated from blood samples of generation 1994 (79 chickens) and plasma samples of generation 1982 (58 chickens). The individuals were typed by 17 markers located in non-coding regions and 6 markers within coding regions. Based on the frequencies of genotypes, allele frequencies and expected genotype frequencies were calculated and their deviations from Hardy Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) were checked. The individual realized inbreeding was determined as the proportion of homozygous loci of all investigated loci. In the investigated New Hampshire line 22 markers were polymorphic showing only few alleles per locus (2 to 4). Comparing the generations of 1982 and 1994, 80 % of the loci changed allele frequencies significantly, partly accompanied by losses of alleles in 1994. In 5 loci the observed genotype frequencies deviated significantly from HWE expectations in both generations, but in contrast to the theory mainly with tendency to heterozygosity. Mean realized inbreeding increased from 56, 4 % (in 1982) to 61, 6 % (in 1994). At the same time the mean estimated inbreeding (Wright) increased from 18, 8 % to 24, 3 % and reached 26, 6 % after 43 generations. The low rate of inbreeding was caused by the rotation mating scheme which was used to avoid close inbreeding. The increase of realized inbreeding (molecular analysis) was higher than predicted by the increase of estimated inbreeding (Wright). In general, an overestimation of homozygosity by the inbreeding coefficient was expected because of <b>heterozygote</b> <b>advantages.</b> These advantages could be explained by heterozygous genes which are responsible for fertility and vitality. The microsatellites for the presented analysis were chosen from coding and non-coding regions. In contrast to the majority of 17 markers located in non-coding regions with increasing homozygosity, the 6 microsatellites located within coding regions showed on average an increase of heterozygosity in the New Hampshire line. Slow inbreeding and slight selection to maintain the line compensated inbreeding depressions and could have counteracted the expected decrease in heterozygosity...|$|R

Reported here are two early stage intraocular amelanotic melanomas discovered in 2 Tyr-HRAS+ Ink 4 a/Arf heterozygous (1 normal CKDN 2 A allele) transgenic FVB/n mice. These tumors were morphologically and immunohistochemically similar to spontaneous UM recently reported in the Ink 4 a/Arf homozygous (CKDN 2 A knockout) parent strain. The tumors originated in the posterior uveal tract. The neoplasms were comprised of bundles of spindle-shaped melanocytes admixed with some epithelioid cells. Tumors were immunohistochemically positive for neuron-specific enolase, S- 100, pan-ras, but negative for cytokeratin and Melan-A. The development of early lenticular opacity and bilateral cataracts is a consistent phenotype of transgenic mice in which the retinoblastoma signaling pathway has been disrupted.

The clinical and laboratory features of malaria in children were described. In multiple regression analysis, raised plasma lactate (> 5 mmolll) was the major predictor of death. Acidosis and impaired renal function were also independent predictors of mortality, and muscle-cell injury was identified as a cause of dark urine. A case-control study of 249 children admitted to hospital with severe malaria and 233 children with severe non-malaria illnesses was undertaken to investigate the possible protective effect of a+-thalassaemia and SAO against the severe manifestations of malaria and other severe illnesses. Homozygous a+thalassaemia reduced the risk of severe malaria by 60 % and SAO appeared to provide complete protection against cerebral malaria. Interestingly, a+ thalassaemia also protected against hospital admission in children with nonmalarial illnesses. I investigated the frequencies of a+ -thalassaemia and SAO, and their relationship with malaria in pregnancy and pregnancy outcome, in over 900 women who delivered their babies in hospital. My findings suggest that neither a+ thalassaemia nor SAO protected against malaria in pregnancy or improved pregnancy outcome. During these studies, I identified the haematological and red-cell abnormalities most consistent with the band 3 deletion for SAO, which may be used to improve the diagnosis, where molecular methods are not available. The findings of the potent protection afforded by a+-thalassaemia and SAO against severe malaria in children will encourage further investigation of the underlying mechanisms. In turn, this may offer new approaches to the design of targeted interventions for the prevention and treatment of malaria that will improve the health of the millions of children who suffer from this devastating disease every year.

40|$|Bovine Tuberculosis (bTB) is {{a disease}} of {{significant}} economic importance, {{being one of the}} most persistent animal health problems in the UK and the Republic of Ireland and increasingly constituting a public health concern especially for the developing world. Limitations of the currently available diagnostic and control methods, along with our incomplete understanding of bTB transmission, prevent successful eradication. This Thesis addresses the development of a complementary control strategy which will be based on animal genetics and will allow us to identify animals genetically predisposed to be more resistant to disease. Specifically, the aim of my PhD project is to investigate the genetic architecture of resistance to bTB and demonstrate the feasibility of whole genome prediction for the control of bTB in cattle. Genomic selection for disease resistance in livestock populations will assist with the reduction of the in herd-level incidence and the severity of potential outbreaks. The first objective was to explore the estimation of breeding values for bTB resistance in UK dairy cattle, and test these genomic predictions for situations when disease phenotypes are not available on selection candidates. Through using dense SNP chip data the results of Chapter 2 demonstrate that genomic selection for bTB resistance is feasible (h 2 = 0. 23 (SE = 0. 06)) and bTB resistance can be predicted using genetic markers with an estimate of prediction accuracy of r(g, ĝ) = 0. 33 in this data. It was shown that genotypes help to predict disease state (AUC ≈ 0. 58) and animals lacking bTB phenotypes can be selected based on their genotypes. In Chapter 3, a novel approach is presented to identify loci displaying <b>heterozygote</b> (dis) <b>advantage</b> associated with resistance to M. bovis, hypothesising underlying non-additive genetic variation, and these results are compared with those obtained from standard genome scans. A marker was identified suggesting an association between locus heterozygosity and increased susceptibility to bTB i. e. a heterozygote disadvantage, with the heterozygotes being significantly more in the cases than in the controls (x 2 = 11. 50, p< 0. 001). Secondly, this thesis focused on conducting a meta-analysis on two dairy cattle populations with bTB phenotypes and SNP chip genotypes, identifying genomic regions underlying bTB resistance and testing genomic predictions by means of cross-validation. In Chapter 4, exploration of the genetic architecture of the trait revealed that bTB resistance is a moderately polygenic, complex trait with clusters of causal variants spread across a few major chromosomes collectively controlling the trait. A region was identified on chromosome 6, putatively associated with bTB resistance and this chromosome as a whole was shown to contribute a major proportion (hc 2 = 0. 051) of the observed variation in this dataset. Genomic prediction for bTB was shown to be feasible even when only distantly related populations are combined (r(g,ĝ) = 0. 33 (SE = 0. 05)), with the chromosomal heritability results suggesting that the accuracy arises from the SNPs capturing linkage disequilibrium between markers and QTL, as well as additive relationships between animals (80...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Balancing {{selection}} operating {{for long}} evolutionary periods at a locus {{is characterized by}} the maintenance of distinct alleles because of a <b>heterozygote</b> or rare-allele <b>advantage.</b> The loci under balancing selection are distinguished by their unusually high polymorphism levels. In this report, we provide statistical and comparative genetic evidence suggesting that the SDHA gene is under long-term balancing selection. SDHA encodes the major catalytical subunit (flavoprotein, Fp) of the succinate dehydrogenase enzyme complex (SDH; mitochondrial complex II). The inhibition of Fp by homozygous SDHA mutations or by 3 -nitropropionic acid poisoning causes central nervous system pathologies. In contrast, heterozygous mutations in SDHB, SDHC, and SDHD, the other SDH subunit genes, cause hereditary paraganglioma (PGL) tumors, which show constitutive activation of pathways induced by oxygen deprivation (hypoxia). Results We sequenced the four SDH subunit genes (10. 8 kb) in 24 African American and 24 European American samples. We also sequenced the SDHA gene (2. 8 kb) in 18 chimpanzees. Increased nucleotide diversity distinguished the human SDHA gene from its chimpanzee ortholog and from the PGL genes. Sequence analysis uncovered two common SDHA missense variants and refuted the previous suggestions that these variants originate from different genetic loci. Two highly dissimilar SDHA haplotype clusters were present in intermediate frequencies in both racial groups. The SDHA variation pattern showed statistically significant deviations from neutrality by the Tajima, Fu and Li, Hudson-Kreitman-Aguadé, and Depaulis haplotype number tests. Empirically, the elevated values of the nucleotide diversity (% π = 0. 231) and the Tajima statistics (D = 1. 954) in the SDHA gene were comparable with the most outstanding cases for balancing selection in the African American population. Conclusion The SDHA gene has a strong signature of balancing selection. The SDHA variants that have increased in frequency during human evolution might, by influencing the regulation of cellular oxygen homeostasis, confer protection against certain environmental toxins or pathogens that are prevalent in Africa. </p...|$|R

50|$|Polymorphism can be {{maintained}} by selection favoring the heterozygote, and this mechanism is used to explain the occurrence of some kinds of genetic variability. A common example is the case where the heterozygote conveys both advantages and disadvantages, while both homozygotes convey a disadvantage. A well-established case of <b>heterozygote</b> <b>advantage</b> {{is that of the}} gene involved in sickle cell anaemia.|$|E
50|$|The {{polymorphism}} {{is maintained}} by negative assortative mating—each morph mates with its opposite. Dimorphic pairs {{may have an}} advantageous balance between parental care and aggressive territorial defense. In addition, {{as in many other}} polymorphisms, <b>heterozygote</b> <b>advantage</b> seems to help maintain this one; the proportion of WS birds homozygotic for the inversion is even lower than would be expected from the low frequency (4%) of pairings of the same morph.|$|E
