500|$|In late April 2005, in an {{interview}} to an Azerbaijani newspaper Realniy Azerbaijan, the former Russian secret service agent Alexander Litvinenko accused the Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation of having organised the Armenian parliament shooting, ostensibly to derail the peace process which would have resolved the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, but he offered {{no evidence to support}} the accusation. In May 2005, the Russian embassy in Armenia denied any such involvement, and described Litvinenko's accusation as an attempt to harm relations between Armenia and Russia by people against the democratic reforms in Russia. The Armenian National Security Service also denied the Russian involvement in the shootings. The NSS spokesman Artsvin Baghramyan stated [...] "not a single fact or <b>even</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> relating to Litvinenko's theory emerged during the trial." [...] President Robert Kocharyan's national security adviser, Garnik Isagulyan, called Litvinenko a [...] "sick man." ...|$|E
500|$|... "All I Want for Christmas Is You" [...] was lauded {{by music}} critics. Parisien called the song [...] "a year-long banger", complimenting its {{instrumentation}} and melody. Steve Morse, editor of The Boston Globe, wrote that Carey sang {{with a lot}} of soul. According to Barry Schwartz from Stylus Magazine, [...] "to say this song is an instant classic somehow doesn't capture its amazingicity; it's a modern standard: joyous, exhilarating, loud, with <b>even</b> <b>a</b> <b>hint</b> of longing." [...] Schwartz praised the song's lyrics as well, describing them as [...] "beautifully phrased," [...] and calling Carey's voice [...] "gorgeous" [...] and [...] "sincere." [...] Kyle Anderson from MTV labeled the track [...] "a majestic anthem full of chimes, sleigh bells, doo-wop flourishes, sweeping strings {{and one of the most}} dynamic and clean vocal performances of Carey's career". While reviewing the 2009 remix version, Becky Bain from Idolator called the song a [...] "timeless classic" [...] and wrote, [...] "We love the original song to pieces—we blast it while decorating our Christmas tree and lighting our Menorah." [...] In his review for Carey's Merry Christmas II You, Thomas Connor from the Chicago Sun-Times called the song [...] "a simple, well-crafted chestnut and one of the last great additions to the Christmas pop canon". Shona Craven of Scotland's The Herald, said, [...] " [...] a song of optimism and joy that maybe, just maybe, hints at the real meaning of Christmas." [...] Additionally, she felt the main reason it was so successful is the subject [...] "you" [...] in the lyrics, explaining, [...] "Perhaps what makes the song such a huge hit is the fact that it's for absolutely everyone." [...] Craven opened her review with a bold statement: [...] "Bing Crosby may well be turning in his grave, but no child of the 1980s will be surprised to see Mariah Carey's sublime All I Want For Christmas Is You bounding up the charts after being named the nation's top festive song." [...] In a 2006 retrospective look at Carey's career, Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker said, the [...] "charming" [...] song was one of Carey's biggest accomplishments, calling it [...] "one of the few worthy modern additions to the holiday canon". Dan Hancox, editor of The National, quoted and agreed with Jones' statement, calling the song [...] "perfection". In 2010, Rolling Stone ranked [...] "All I Want for Christmas Is You" [...] fourth on its Greatest Rock and Roll Christmas Songs list, calling it a [...] "holiday standard." ...|$|E
