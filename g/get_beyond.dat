However, after independence in 1956 the Khartoum government shifted the sugar project to the north, where it is grown under much less favorable conditions with heavy irrigation. A sugar, clothing, and a weaving factory was established in Mongalla in the 1970s but operations failed to <b>get</b> <b>beyond</b> their trial phase and diminished as conflict grew in {{the region in the}} early 1980s. In April 2006 the President of Southern Sudan, Salva Kiir Mayardit, named Mongalla as one of the Nile ports {{to be the first to}} be rehabilitated.|$|E

Jack Crayston and George Swindin, both former players, followed Whittaker but could not replicate his success. Apart from finishing third in 1958–59 and fifth in both 1955–56 and 1956–57, Arsenal usually finished in mid-table. Nor did the club have much luck in the FA Cup — after reaching the final in 1951–52, Arsenal would not <b>get</b> <b>beyond</b> the quarter-finals again until 1970–71. To make matters worse for the club, Tottenham Hotspur won the Double in 1960–61.|$|E

Fisheries targeting the Northern krill (Meganyctiphanes norvegica), a medium-sized krill reaching body lengths of more than , as well as Tysanoessa raschii (2cm) and T. inermis in the Gulf of St. Lawrence and on the Scotian Shelf have been proposed, but didn't <b>get</b> <b>beyond</b> early experimental stages. They are limited to harvesting a few hundred tonnes of krill per year, and Nicol & Foster consider it unlikely that any new large-scale harvesting operations in these areas will be started due to the opposition from local fishing industries and conservation groups.|$|E

At 5–4 up on Ronnie O'Sullivan in the semis, Fu got a huge kick on a red when in the balls and also missed a green with the rest later on as O'Sullivan levelled and then made a 130 break in the deciding frame to win. Before the end of 2016, Fu reached the final of the Scottish Open, with his closest game being a 4–3 victory over Neil Robertson in the fourth round as Fu did not lose more than a frame in his other five matches. In the final John Higgins opened the match with three centuries, before Fu added one of his own. He came from 4–1 down by winning eight frames in a row to land his third ranking tournament title. Throughout the tournament, Fu made 11 centuries and 21 more breaks over 50 in seven matches.|$|E

[...] The harshest review came from Sam Goldner of Tiny Mix Tapes, who bashed the album as a major contributing factor to [...] "the nasty details, the blemishes, the facts of this world that truly corrupt our collective sense of well-being and hope" [...] in regards to how the Star Wars franchise has been marketed.|$|E
500|$|In 2000, Sony {{released}} its successor to PlayStation, the PlayStation 2. Insomniac's ideas {{for its first}} PlayStation 2 project included Monster Knight, a concept that was designed in 1999 but the game did not <b>get</b> <b>beyond</b> its planning stage. The canceled project was revealed 13 years after the game's conception. The second title was Girl With A Stick, which took inspirations from The Legend of Zelda and Tomb Raider. It {{was intended as a}} serious game, and to prove Insomniac's ability to create games other than platformers. Insomniac spent six months on the project, developing several prototypes and a functional demo. However, most staff members, beside Price, were not passionate about the project, and thought it was [...] "one-dimensional". Sony also thought the game would not find a market, and recommended Insomniac to [...] "play to [...] strengths". As a result, Girl With A Stick was scrapped. According to Price, Girl with A Stick is a lesson for Insomniac and its first failure.|$|E

500|$|Christopher Paolini {{started reading}} fantasy books {{when he was}} 10 years old. At the age of 14, as a hobby, he started writing the first novel {{in a series of}} four books, but he could not <b>get</b> <b>beyond</b> a few pages because he had [...] "no idea" [...] where he was going. He began reading {{everything}} he could about the [...] "art of writing", and then plotted the whole Inheritance Cycle book series. After a month of planning out the series, he started writing the draft of Eragon by hand. It was finished a year later, and Paolini began writing the [...] "real" [...] version of the book. After another year of editing, Paolini's parents saw the final manuscript. They immediately saw its potential and decided to publish the book through their small, home-based publishing company, Paolini International. Paolini created the cover art for this edition of Eragon, which featured Saphira's eye on the cover. He also drew the maps inside the book.|$|E
500|$|The 18-foot (5.5m) high Roman wall {{enclosing}} the City put {{the fleeing}} homeless {{at risk of}} being shut into the inferno. Once the riverfront was on fire and the escape route cut off by boat, the only exits were the eight gates in the wall. During the first couple of days, few people had any notion of fleeing the burning City altogether. They would remove what they could carry of their belongings to the nearest [...] "safe house", in many cases the parish church or the precincts of St Paul's Cathedral, only to have to move again hours later. Some moved their belongings and themselves [...] "four and five times" [...] in a single day. The perception of a need to <b>get</b> <b>beyond</b> the walls only took root late on the Monday, and then there were near-panic scenes at the narrow gates as distraught refugees tried to get out with their bundles, carts, horses, and wagons.|$|E
500|$|In a {{contemporary}} review for Spin, Lauren Spencer hailed Badmotorfinger as a [...] "garden of sound" [...] that drew on older hard rock influences without sounding [...] "derivative".

She concluded in her review that the record was more [...] "stylishly bombastic rather than bludgeoningly bombastic. Tuneless heavy metal is, after all, still tuneless heavy metal, {{and in that}} department, Soundgarden are as functional as they make 'em." [...] In a retrospective review, AllMusic staff writer Steve Huey deemed the album [...] "heavy, challenging hard rock full of intellectual sensibility and complex band interplay." [...] Robert Christgau was less enthusiastic, finding it [...] "credible" [...] as a metal record because of Thayil's impressive use of guitar noise but less impressive lyrically: [...] "Chris Cornell howls on about 'lookin for the paradigm' and 'your Jesus Christ pose' (I swear, that's the good stuff)".|$|E
