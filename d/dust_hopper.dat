40|$|The {{influence}} {{of the presence of}} a hopper section, consisting of a <b>dust</b> <b>hopper</b> and swirl attenuator, under gas-solid cyclones has been investigated by numerical simulation. Inclusion of this configuration in the simulations was found to have a significant influence on both flowpattern and separation efficiency.

The cyclone separation was predicted to be better with the hopper section included than without, a physical reason is proposed.

40|$|Abstract. The {{gas flow}} {{structure}} of new quick-contact cyclone reactor was simulated by using Reynolds stress model of Computational Fluid Dynamics method. In preliminary work, {{it had been}} proved that the simulated results agreed well with the experimental results. The results show that: (1) in mixer region, the three-dimensional velocities of gas flow are very small and the vertical vortexes cover the most part of the mixer which could contribute to gas-solid mixing effect; (2) in separator region, the rotation intensity of gas flow is very strong through accelerating action of guided vanes. However, some vortexes exist near the entrance of exhaust pipe and <b>dust</b> <b>hopper</b> which is not conductive to separation efficiency. The results could play a directive role in mass and heat transfer process and catalytic cracking reaction in cyclone reactor...|$|E
50|$|<b>Dust</b> {{enters the}} <b>hopper</b> from the {{collection}} device. For example, baghouses are shaken or blown with compressed air to release caked-on dust from the bag. Precipitators use a rapping system to release the dirt. The crumbling dust falls into the <b>hopper.</b> Once the <b>dust</b> in the <b>hopper</b> reaches capacity, it is released through {{an opening in the}} bottom with a diameter of about 8 - 12 in. Hoppers are rectangular in cross section but have sides that slope at about a 60° angle. Slanted sides make it easier to remove the ash. Conveyors are sometimes used to carry away the particulate matter.|$|R
50|$|The {{greatest}} difficulty {{associated with}} the removal of <b>dust</b> from the <b>hopper</b> is the compaction of the ash.

50|$|Trickle valves, {{also known}} as vacuum valves, are {{commonly}} used in industrial dust collection applications to maintain an airlock seal on a <b>dust</b> collector <b>hopper</b> while allowing bulk solid material to be automatically discharged. These valves are typically a less expensive alternative to more commonly used rotary airlocks. Unlike rotary airlock valves which are driven by either an electric motor or a gas or air-powered motor, trickle valves require no external power source and are therefore well-suited for use in mechanical trenchers, where a dust-free environment in the pinnacle truss and axle bore is required for smooth operation. Trickle values were originally developed for this purpose.|$|R
30|$|Wan et al. (2008) {{defined the}} {{coefficient}} of restitution for the cyclone walls using a trial and error method. They adopted different coefficients of restitution at different wall positions. When the calculated separation efficiency of cyclone showed a good agreement with the experimental result using a certain coefficient of restitution, it was adopted. By assuming that the particle size and shape remain unchanged through the passage from the inlet to the spigot, the impact velocity and impact angle of particles {{with respect to the}} cyclone wall are changing from top to bottom of the hydrocyclone. For the current study, according to Wan et al. (2008), the particle coefficient of restitution was set as 1.0 – 0.9 at the annular space. From top to bottom of the separation space (cylindrical body part), the particle coefficient of restitution was set as 0.9 – 0.6, and at the <b>dust</b> <b>hopper</b> (conical part), the particle coefficient of restitution was set as 0.5 – 0.05 as a linear function of height.|$|E
40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of the project was}} to evaluate the long-term feasibility of using activated carbon injection (ACI) options to effectively reduce mercury emissions from Texas electric generation plants in which a blend of lignite and subbituminous coal is fired. Field testing of ACI options was performed on one-quarter of Unit 2 at TXU's Big Brown Steam Electric Station. Unit 2 has a design output of 600 MW and burns a blend of 70 % Texas Gulf Coast lignite and 30 % subbituminous Powder River Basin coal. Big Brown employs a COHPAC configuration, i. e., high air-to-cloth baghouses following cold-side electrostatic precipitators (ESPs), for particulate control. When sorbent injection is added between the ESP and the baghouse, the combined technology is referred to as TOXECON{trademark} and is patented by the Electric Power Research Institute in the United States. Key benefits of the TOXECON configuration include better mass transfer characteristics of a fabric filter compared to an ESP for mercury capture and contamination of {{only a small percentage of}} the fly ash with AC. The field testing consisted of a baseline sampling period, a parametric screening of three sorbent injection options, and a month long test with a single mercury control technology. During the baseline sampling, native mercury removal was observed to be less than 10 %. Parametric testing was conducted for three sorbent injection options: injection of standard AC alone; injection of an EERC sorbent enhancement additive, SEA 4, with ACI; and injection of an EERC enhanced AC. Injection rates were determined for all of the options to achieve the minimum target of 55 % mercury removal as well as for higher removals approaching 90 %. Some of the higher injection rates were not sustainable because of increased differential pressure across the test baghouse module. After completion of the parametric testing, a month long test was conducted using the enhanced AC at a nominal rate of 1. 5 lb/Macf. During the time that enhanced AC was injected, the average mercury removal for the month long test was approximately 74 % across the test baghouse module. ACI was interrupted frequently during the month long test because the test baghouse module was bypassed frequently to relieve differential pressure. The high air-to-cloth ratio of operations at this unit results in significant differential pressure, and thus there was little operating margin before encountering differential pressure limits, especially at high loads. This limited the use of sorbent injection as the added material contributes to the overall differential pressure. This finding limits sustainable injection of AC without appropriate modifications to the plant or its operations. Handling and storage issues were observed for the TOXECON ash-AC mixture. Malfunctioning equipment led to baghouse <b>dust</b> <b>hopper</b> plugging, and storage of the stagnant material at flue gas temperatures resulted in self-heating and ignition of the AC in the ash. In the hoppers that worked properly, no such problems were reported. Economics of mercury control at Big Brown were estimated for as-tested scenarios and scenarios incorporating changes to allow sustainable operation. This project was funded under the U. S. Department of Energy National Energy Technology Laboratory project entitled 'Large-Scale Mercury Control Technology Field Testing Program [...] Phase II'...|$|E
40|$|A {{section of}} road was {{constructed}} in Northeastern Indiana {{in the summer of}} 1996 using waste foundry sand as the embankment construction material. Initial testing on the waste sand had determined no detrimental health effects. However, it was observed during construction that once the sand had dried, tire-road interaction raised copious clouds of black dust. This led to worker concern regarding airborne silica and silicosis. This study aimed at determining whether the threat of overexposure to airborne crystalline silica existed in regard to Occupation Health and Safety Administration’s (OSHA) Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL). Experiments carried out at the Auburn Foundry waste sand monofill in the summer of 1998 in which clouds of dust were purposefully generated and sampled by both respirable personal samplers and high volume area samplers showed that respirable crystalline silica dust did not overexpose the workers relative to the OSHA PEL. The negative findings of crystalline silica in the respirable samples were confirmed in the area samples by an second, independent laboratory. Calculations show that up to an average of 20 % by weight of respirable size dust such as baghouse <b>hopper</b> <b>dust</b> can be allowed in the waste foundry sand. Specifying this amount of fine dust for waste foundry sand will provide a worker exposure safety factor of about 2. 0 for protection against overexposure to crystalline silica dust. Removing the baghouse <b>hopper</b> <b>dust</b> material from the waste sand would reduce dust generation considerably. Recommended methods of dust abatement include watering down the dust during transportation, dumping, and compacting and keeping the sand wet during construction...|$|R

40|$|The waste-heat boiler is used {{within the}} Sulphide flash {{smelting}} process {{as the main}} dust and energy recovery unit. The large volume of off-gas discharged from the flash smelter is {{at a very high}} temperature (1350 °C) and contains a significant dust load that subjects the downstream waste-heat boiler to tough and demanding conditions. The boiler cavity is especially prone to dust accretions, fouling, and corrosion caused by accumulation of molten particles and precipitation of sulphuric acid. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is applied within a qualitative study to model the flow and heat transfer distribution throughout the waste-heat boiler. The commercial CFD package, Fluent 6. 2. 16, was applied to a modified waste-heat boiler (23 m × 11 m × 5. 4 m) within the Outokumpu flash smelting process. This investigation focuses on the geometric modifications to the typical boiler design, which includes elevation of the ceiling, placement of flow-obstructing baffles and radiation plates parallel within the flow path. Also investigated were various boiler operating conditions such as the circulation of process off-gas, air leakage from the <b>dust</b> discharging <b>hoppers</b> and variation in inlet gas composition. The geometric modifications had the desired effect of increasing the volumetric utilization and therefore enhancing heat transfer between the boiler surface and the gas stream and dust segregation. Introducing circulated off-gas at a rate of 20 m/s and at a 45 ° angle {{to the front of the}} waste boiler further enhanced cooling while reducing the high impact of the furnace-uptake gas-stream on the boiler ceiling.

Phase I of the development effort consisted of design, construction, and testing of a 5. 7 -m{sup 3 }/min (200 -acfm) working AHPC model. Results from both 8 -hr parametric tests and 100 -hr proof-of-concept tests with two different coals demonstrated excellent operability and greater than 99. 99 % fine-particle collection efficiency. Since all of the developmental goals of Phase I were met, the approach was scaled up in Phase II to a size of 255 m{sup 3 }/min (9000 acfm) (equivalent in size to 2. 5 MW) and was installed on a slipstream at the Big Stone Power Plant. For Phase II, the AHPC at Big Stone Power Plant was operated continuously from late July 1999 until mid-December 1999. The Phase II results were highly successful in that ultrahigh particle collection efficiency was achieved, pressure drop was well controlled, and system operability was excellent. For Phase III, the AHPC was modified into a more compact configuration, and components were installed that were closer to what would {{be used in a}} full-scale commercial design. The modified AHPC was operated from April to July 2000. While operational results were acceptable during this time, inspection of bags in the summer of 2000 revealed some membrane damage to the fabric that appeared to be caused by electrical effects. Subsequently, extensive theoretical, bench-scale, and pilot-scale investigations were completed to find an approach to prevent bag damage without compromising AHPC performance. Results showed that the best bag protection and AHPC performance were achieved by using a perforated plate installed between the discharge electrodes and bags. This perforated-plate design was then installed in the 2. 5 -MW AHPC at Big Stone Power Plant in Big Stone City, South Dakota, and the AHPC was operated from March to June 2001.

The AHPC combines the best features of electrostatic precipitators (ESPs) and baghouses in a unique approach to develop a compact but highly efficient system. Filtration and electrostatics are employed in the same housing, providing major synergism between the two collection methods, both in the particulate collection step and in the transfer of <b>dust</b> to the <b>hopper.</b> The AHPC provides ultrahigh collection efficiency, overcoming the problem of excessive fine-particle emissions with conventional ESPs, and solves the problem of reentrainment and re-collection of dust in conventional baghouses. The objective of the AHPC is to provide > 99. 99 % particulate collection efficiency for particle sizes from 0. 01 to 50 {micro}m and be applicable for use with all U.

Extensive studies were then carried out to determine the reason for the bag damage and to find possible solutions without compromising AHPC performance. The best solution to prevent the bag damage was found to be perforated plates installed between the electrodes and the bags, which can block the electric field from the bag surface and intercept current to the bags. The perforated plates not only solve the bag damage problem, but also offer many other advantages such as operation at higher A/C (air-to-cloth) ratios, lower pressure drop, and an even more compact geometric arrangement. For this project, AHPC pilot-scale tests were carried out to understand the effect of the perforated plate configuration on bag protection and AHPC overall performance and to optimize the perforated plate design. Five different perforated plate configurations were evaluated in a coal combustion system. The AHPC performed extremely well even at a low current level (1. 5 - 3. 0 mA) and a low pulse trigger pressure of 6. 5 in. W. C. (1. 62 kPa), resulting in a bag-cleaning interval of over 40 min at an A/C ratio of 12 ft/min (3. 7 m/min) for most of the test period.
