40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to identify potential synergies between a dry-mill corn fed (EtOH) plant and a coal based Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) power plant. The general conclusion is that heat integration opportunities do exist between EtOH production and IGCC, and indicate that further investigation of the topic is warranted. Specific results indicate that in a best case scenario all of the heat load due to EtOH distillation, <b>evaporator</b> and <b>drum</b> dryer could be met by unutilized heat from the IGCC, and would result in significant economic and carbon emission benefits. In the worst case scenario, it is concluded that only {{a significant portion of}} drum dryer load could be met, which would still yield significant economic and moderate carbon emission reduction benefits...|$|R
40|$|The Radioactive Liquid Waste Treatment Facility (RLWTF) at Argonne National Laboratory-West (ANL-W) in Idaho {{provides}} improved {{treatment for}} low-level aqueous waste compared to conventional systems. A unique, patented evaporated system {{is used in}} the RLWTF. SHADE (shielded hot air <b>drum</b> <b>evaporator,</b> US Patent No. 4, 305, 780) is a low-cost disposable unit constructed from standard components and is self-shielded. The results of testing and recent operations indicate that evaporation rates of 2 to 6 gph (8 to 23 L/h) can be achieved with a single unit housed in a standard 30 -gal (114 -L) drum container. The operating experience has confirmed the design evaporation rate of 60, 000 gal (227, 000 L) per year, using six SHADE's...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWaste heat {{recovery}} generation (WHRG) {{is a power}} plant system that utilizes the flue gas to generate an electrical power in cement industry. This plant has various unit operations, such as economizer, <b>evaporator,</b> superheater, steam <b>drum,</b> and turbine. To design WHRG plant, steam drum needs to be controlled in the first place, {{for the reason that}} this unit operation will affect steam quality utilized to drive the turbine. There are three finest control elements which can be applied on steam drum; they are level control, pressure control, and mass flow rate control. The control structure on steam drum has deficiency on overcoming the load change value. To handle this problem, WHRG plant needs the other control structure. Plantwide control (PWC) is one of control method to handle the default load changes value. There are two kinds of design methods part based on PWC, the first part is top-down and the second part is bottom-up. Top-down part is a method used to optimize a particular process by determining the advantageous function, while bottom-up part is a method used to maintain the stability rate of the system. Since this study was aimed to control WHRG plant by considering the stability rate, bottom-up part was utilized. The stages used in designing the research based on bottom-up part are determining the operational objectives and limitations, analyzing the degree of freedom in the form of degree of freedom value used to calculate the total of manipulated variable (MV), determining variable process needs controlling, determining the manipulator of production rate, determining the structure of regulatory control layer, determining the adjustment of controller based on Relative Gain Array (RGA) method, and administering open loop test derived from the resulted system's responses. Based on PWC method, there are three kinds of control structures; they are boiler follow (BFC), turbines follow (TFC), and coordinate controller (CC). The output response resulted by this simulation show that CC is the most precise control structure to handle the load changes on WHRG plant. It can analyze with low value of IAE, settling time, and maximum overshoot of the control result. The IAE value of CC is 857. 3439, BFC = 1182. 895, while TFC = 887. 1246. CC control structure produces IAE better than BFC and TFC. Hence, the precise control structure for WHRG plant is CC...|$|R
40|$|SummaryIn this study, the Trilateral Flash Cycle (TFC) and the Partially Evaporating Cycle (PEC) {{have been}} {{analyzed}} and {{compared to the}} Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) for power production from low temperature heat sources. This study {{is a continuation of}} the work done in my project thesis fall 2013. The ORC is a well-known technology that is in use in several plants today. The TFC and PEC on the other hand are still in a state of technical development. The biggest challenge for the TFC and PEC is the required two-phase expansion. Lately, two-phase expanders with high efficiencies have been developed, which makes the TFC and PEC economically interesting. Currently, only a few studies on the TFC and PEC can be found, {{and most of them are}} theoretical considerations. All of these studies finds the TFC promising for low temperature heat sources, which was also the findings of my project thesis. The PEC is found to be promising for smaller systems where the working fluid pump efficiency is low. The TFCs main difference from the ORC is that the heating process ends at the boiling point of the working fluid, i. e. there is no evaporation and superheating. This leads to a better temperature match between the working fluid and the heat source, such that more heat can be transferred to the working fluid. Power is produced in a two-phase expander after the heating process. The cost pr. kWh for TFC systems have been estimated to be lower than for ORC systems due to the elimination of the <b>evaporator,</b> separator <b>drum,</b> gear box, lube oil system and the fact that simpler heat exchangers can be used. In the PEC, the working fluid is allowed to be partially evaporated during the heating process. This is done in an attempt to combine the advantages of the TFC and the ORC. The ORC, TFC and PEC have been simulated in a Microsoft Excel calculation tool, using Visual Basic for Applications. The simulations include detailed heat exchanger models to calculate heat transfer coefficients and pressure losses, and two-phase expander efficiency models for the TFC and PEC. The three cycles have been simulated and optimized for maximum net power production for three cases using different heat source temperatures. Air with a mass flow of 10 kg/s and temperatures of 100, 150 and 200 &# 176;C are used for Case I, Case II and Case III respectively. Water at 20 &# 176;C is used as the heat sink. The three cases are simulated with eight different working fluids, R 123, R 134 a, R 245 fa, R 1234 ze(E), butane, pentane, isopentane and propane with maximum heat exchanger areas of 1000, 1500, 2000, 2500, 3000, 3500 and 4000 m 2. Different performance parameters are calculated and used to compare the performance of the ORC, TFC and PEC, and the different working fluids. The results show that the TFC has the lowest power production for all cases, and the largest estimated system size. Both the total heat exchanger area and expander outlet volume flow are generally higher for the TFC systems, especially for the lower heat source temperature cases. For the 100 &# 176;C and 150 &# 176;C cases the power production for the TFC and ORC is in the same range. Since TFC systems are estimated to have a lower cost than ORC systems, they can be suitable for systems with heat sources in this range when system size is not a critical factor. The PEC does not show any advantage over the ORC for the cases analyzed here. This study shows less promising results for the TFC than my project thesis and other published studies. This is mainly due to the variable two-phase expander efficiency used here, and that none of the other studies considers pressure losses in the system or calculation of heat transfer coefficients for each working fluid. A scientific paper on the main results from the study before the simulation of the PEC and inclusion of the heat exchanger models is given in Appendix C. This paper has been submitted to the journal Energy. A scientific paper on the final results of the study is given in Appendix D. This paper has been submitted to the Gustav Lorentzen Conference. </p...|$|R
