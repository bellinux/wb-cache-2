5000|$|There {{are many}} signs of <b>dental</b> <b>erosion,</b> {{including}} changes in appearance and sensitivity. One {{of the physical}} changes can be the color of teeth. There are two different colors teeth may turn if <b>dental</b> <b>erosion</b> is occurring, the first being a change of color that usually happens {{on the cutting edge}} of the central incisors. This causes the cutting edge of the tooth to become transparent. A second sign is if the tooth has a yellowish tint. This occurs because the white enamel has eroded away to reveal the yellowish dentin. [...] A change in shape of the teeth is also a sign of <b>dental</b> <b>erosion.</b> Teeth will begin to appear with a broad rounded concavity, and the gaps between teeth will become larger. There can be evidence of wear on surfaces of teeth not expected to be in contact with one another. [...] If <b>dental</b> <b>erosion</b> occurs in children, a loss of enamel surface characteristics can occur. Amalgam restorations in the mouth may be clean and non-tarnished. Fillings may also appear to be rising out of the tooth, the appearance being caused when the tooth is eroded away leaving only the filling. The teeth may form divots on the chewing surfaces when <b>dental</b> <b>erosion</b> is occurring. This mainly happens on the first, second, and third molars. One of the most severe signs of <b>dental</b> <b>erosion</b> is cracking, where teeth begin to crack off and become coarse. [...] Other signs include pain when eating hot, cold, or sweet foods. This pain is due to the enamel having been eroded away, exposing the sensitive dentin.|$|E

40|$|Background and aim. Patients {{with disabilities}} {{have a higher}} {{prevalence}} of caries and <b>dental</b> <b>erosions</b> than general population. This particularity may be assessed by the study of microcrystallization of saliva. We investigated the oral liquid microcrystallization in children with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), a condition associated with <b>dental</b> <b>erosions.</b> Material and methods. 54 children have been clinically examined: 27 children suffering from GERD with ages between 13 and 15, {{were included in the}} study group, and 27 healthy children- the control group. The study of crystallographic changes of the oral liquid was performed using the method developed by Shatohina, Razumov SN, Shabalin VN (2006) with the scanning electron microscope VEGA TESCAN TS 5130 MM. Results. The degree of microcrystalization of the oral liquid in children with GERD was considerably reduced, (1. 73 ± 0. 11 points) and was lower than in children in the control group (3. 22 ± 0. 16 points) (p< 0. 01, RR= 2). The degree of micro-crystallization of oral liquid in children with GERD was 1. 86 times lower than in healthy children. This was correlated with the duration of gastroesophageal reflux. Conclusion.

40|$|Abstract: Taking into {{consideration}} the problem, which the patients face, with erosions of the teeth, our study is focused toward examining the consumption of carbonated and fruit drinks during the day, as a potential risk factor, {{in the development of}} erosive tissue, depending on the age of the patients, and salivary values of calcium and phosphates, and their association with the onset of <b>dental</b> <b>erosions.</b> In the presented distribution of data which take {{into consideration}} the consumption of carbonated drinks in the listed groups, for Pearson Chi-square= 12, 75 and p years, for p 0, 05 (p= 0, 57) between the values of the phosphates in the saliva of the examinees from the examined groups, there is no significant difference. From the presented results, we can see that between the average group values, of phosphates in the saliva of the examinees, p> 0, 05 and there is {{no significant difference between the}} groups. We can conclude that future studies and discussions about the erosion of t teeth, and their role in the overall oral health, are necessary, but also, it seems that they are also stimulated because of their frequency.

5000|$|<b>Dental</b> <b>erosion</b> {{can occur}} by non-extrinsic factors too. Intrinsic <b>dental</b> <b>erosion</b> {{is known as}} perimolysis, whereby gastric acid from the stomach comes {{into contact with the}} teeth. People with {{diseases}} such as anorexia nervosa, bulimia, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) often suffer from this. GERD is quite common and an average of 7% of adults experience reflux daily. The main cause of GERD is increased acid production by the stomach. [...] This is not exclusive to adults, as GERD and other gastrointestinal disorders may cause dental erosions in children. Rumination also may cause acid erosion.|$|E
5000|$|Acid erosion, {{also known}} as <b>dental</b> <b>erosion,</b> {{is a type of}} tooth wear.

[...] There is generally widespread ignorance of the damaging effects of acid erosion; this is particularly the case with erosion due to fruit juices, because they tend to be seen as healthy. [...] Erosion is found initially in the enamel and, if unchecked, may proceed to the underlying dentin.|$|E
40|$|Numerous case-control {{and other}} studies {{involving}} confirmation of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) by esophageal pH-metry and {{the assessment of}} <b>dental</b> <b>erosions</b> have shown significant associations between the two conditions in both adults and children. By contrast, when asked to vote on whether GERD may cause <b>dental</b> <b>erosions,</b> only 42 % of physicians strongly agreed that such an association existed in adults, and just 12. 5 % strongly agreed for children, respectively in two global consensus reports. Part of this divergence between the perceptions of physicians and the findings of research publications may reflect {{a general lack of}} oral health education during medical training, and cursory oral examinations being made under less-than-ideal conditions. Adequate salivary secretions are essential {{for the protection of the}} teeth and the oropharyngeal and esophageal mucosa. The quantity and quality of the saliva require monitoring as many drugs, including several of the proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), can cause hyposalivation. In addition, PPIs do not always result in adequate acid suppression. Therefore, collaboration between physicians and dentists is strongly advocated to prevent or ameliorate possible adverse oral effects from both endogenous and exogenous acids, and to promote adequate saliva production in patients with GERD.

50|$|The {{etiology}} of dental attrition is multifactorial {{one of the}} most common causes of attrition is bruxism. Bruxism is the para-functional movement of the mandible, occurring during the day or night. It can be associated with presence of audible sound when clenching or grinding the teeth. This is usually reported by parents or partners if the grinding occurs during sleep. In some cases, <b>dental</b> <b>erosion</b> is also associated with severe dental attrition. <b>Dental</b> <b>erosion</b> is tooth surface loss caused by extrinsic or intrinsic forms of acid. Extrinsic erosion is due to a highly acidic diet, while intrinsic erosion is caused by regurgitation of gastric acids. Erosion softens the dental hard tissues making them more susceptible to attrition. Thus, if erosion and bruxism both exist, surface loss due to attrition is faster. Severe attrition in young patients is usually associated with erosive factors in their diets. The different physiological processes of tooth wear (abrasion, attrition and erosion) usually occur simultaneously and rarely work individually. Therefore, it is important to understand these tooth wear processes and their interactions to determine causes of tooth surface loss. Demineralization of the tooth surface due to acids can cause occlusal erosion as well as attrition. Wedge-shaped cervical lesions are commonly found in association with occlusal erosion and attrition.|$|E
5000|$|Acidic {{drinks and}} foods lower the pH {{level of the}} mouth so {{consuming}} them causes the teeth to demineralise. Drinks low in pH levels that cause <b>dental</b> <b>erosion</b> include fruit juices, sports drinks, wine, beer and carbonated drinks [...] Orange and apple juices are common culprits among fruit juices. Carbonated drinks such as colas, lemonades are also very acidic, as are fruit-flavoured drinks and dilutables. Frequency rather than total intake of acidic juices {{is seen as the}} greater factor in dental erosion; infants using feeding bottles containing fruit juices (especially when used as a comforter) are therefore at greater risk of acid erosion.|$|E
50|$|Acid erosion {{is defined}} as the loss of tooth enamel caused by acid attack. When {{consuming}} carbonated sugar sweetened beverages, acid deposits on the teeth, attacking the enamel. Over a gradual period, the enamel is worn down, which can lead to <b>dental</b> caries. <b>Erosion</b> of tooth enamel begins at a pH of 5.5, and ingredients found in sugar sweetened beverages such as phosphoric acid and citric acid significantly contribute to the demineralization of the enamel. Citric acid in various sugar sweetened beverages can cause chelation.|$|R
40|$|Background Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is {{very common}} in {{developed}} world, with the prevalence of disease is between 6 and 20 %. Pathologic reflux can provoke not only typical symptoms (heartburn and regurgitation) but also atypical symptoms and diseases of extraoesophageal organs (pulmonary, ENT, mouth). High prevalence of GERD in patients with unexplained chest pain, asthma, chronic cough, chronic laryngitis, hoarsness and <b>dental</b> <b>erosions</b> is not a proof of causality. GERD can cause these diseases with reflux of acid and pepsin into pharynx, larynx, lungs and mouth (reflux theory) or through vasovagal mechanisms (reflex theory). Conclusions Good therapeutic success with medical or operative treatment in early methodologically not well conducted studies has not been completely proven in double-blind placebo controlled studies. GERD is an ethyological reason for these extraoesophageal symptoms and diseases in an approximately one third of patients. With diagnostic modalities that we have now, we cannot clearly define in which patient is GERD is an ethyologic factor or a contributer, before we start the treatment. In patients suspected of having GERD, there is therapeutic option of a trial with high dose of proton pump inhibitor for 3 to 6 months. In other patients with low clinical suspicion of GERD, 24 -hour pH testing should be done first. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} offers a {{literature}} {{review of the}} main oral complications observed in women during pregnancy and menopause, and describes the different dental management protocols used during these periods and during lactation, according to the scientific literature. To this effect, a PubMed-Medline search was made, using the following key word combinations: “pregnant and dentistry”, “lactation and dentistry”, “postmenopausal and dentistry”, “menopausal and dentistry” and “oral bisphosphonates and dentistry”. The search was limited to reviews, metaanalyses and clinical guides in dental journals published over the last 10 years in English and Spanish. A total of 38 publications were evaluated. Pregnancy can be characterized by an increased prevalence of caries and <b>dental</b> <b>erosions,</b> worsening of pre-existing gingivitis, or the appearance of pyogenic granulomas, among other problems. Although routine dental treatment is generally safe in pregnant patients and posteriorly during the lactation period, certain dental procedures can have potentially damaging effects, {{such as the use}} of ionizing radiations, the administration of drugs, or the generation of pain and stress. In postmenopausal women, alterations of the oral cavity are related to the hormone alterations that characterize these patients and to physiological aging of the oral tissues, potentially giving rise to periodontitis, burning mouth syndrome and xerostomia. As a result of the development of osteoporosis, these patients may be receiving treatment with oral bisphosphonates, which in turn may require changes in the dental management plan...|$|R
50|$|To prevent {{demineralisation}} in the mouth, it {{is important}} for an individual to ensure they have a well-balanced diet, including foods containing calcium and foods that are low in acids and sugars. The individual should have a diet high in fresh fruits and vegetables, wholegrain cereals, legumes, seeds and nuts. Sugary snacks including lollies, fruit bars, muesli bars, biscuits, dried fruit, cordials, juices and soft drinks should be limited as they contribute to dental decay and <b>dental</b> <b>erosion.</b> Additionally, excessive starchy foods (such as bread, pasta, and crackers), fruits and milk products consumed frequently can cause the growth of dental plaque and bacteria. Therefore healthy eating, healthy drinking and proper maintenance of oral hygiene {{is the best way to}} promote and maintain sound tooth structure for an individual.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most common}} cause of erosion is by acidic foods and drinks. In general, foods and drinks with a pH below 5.0 - 5.7 have been known to trigger <b>dental</b> <b>erosion</b> effects. Numerous {{clinical}} and laboratory reports link erosion to excessive consumption of drinks. Those thought to pose a risk are soft drinks, some alcohol and fruit drinks, fruit juices such as orange juice (which contain citric acid) and carbonated drinks such as colas (in which the carbonic acid is not the cause of erosion, but citric and phosphoric acid). [...] Additionally, wine has been shown to erode teeth, with the pH of wine as low as 3.0 - 3.8. Other possible sources of erosive acids are from exposure to chlorinated swimming pool water, and regurgitation of gastric acids.|$|E

40|$|Background: Numerous studies {{worldwide}} have {{assessed the}} association between <b>dental</b> <b>erosions</b> or other related oral manifestations, and the gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Nowadays, {{one of the main}} therapeutic resources of GERD is represented by proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). Adequate salivary secretions and flow are considered mandatory for the protection of both teeth and esophageal mucosa. The aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the possible correlation between GERD treatment options and subsequent control of oral manifestation, taking as premises that either PPIs or dietary and lifestyle changes may control oral patterns of GERD by acting on salivary secretions. Methods: 48 clinically diagnosed GERD adult patients with oral manifestations, mainly erosions, were included in the study, none of which showing alarming symptoms that would require further gastroenterologic examination. Oral examination evaluated the DMF (decayed, missing, filled) and OHI-S (Simplified Oral Hygiene) indices. Salivary flow was evaluated by the Saxon test. 25 patients were prescribed dietary and lifestyle measures and PPIs (omeprazole – 20 mg), whereas 23 patients were managed only through dietary and lifestyle modifications. General assessment was performed at the time of diagnosis and 4 weeks afterwards. Results: No significant differences as to the DMF index, OHI-S index or Saxon test were found over the 4 weeks management between the groups. Conclusions: Oral manifestation of GERD may be caused by impaired salivary secretions and flow, otherwise no - positive or negative - effect could be secondary to PPI therapy. Accordingly, complex oral rehabilitation of GERD patients and collaboration between gastroenterologists and dentists should be promoted...|$|R
40|$|Rumination {{syndrome}} involves {{bringing up}} partially digested food into the pharynx voluntarily, followed by reswallowing or expelling.

Indeed, the first case of adult rumination in Japan was reported as recently as 2006. Due to this recent increase in awareness, notions about the disease have remained {{in a state of}} constant fluctuation. While first believed to be a disease of neurologically-impaired children between 3 and 8 months of age, it is now widely recognized as occurring in men and women of all ages and cognitive abilities. Originally rumination was labeled benign; however, it is now known to cause such complications as weight loss, malnutrition, <b>dental</b> <b>erosions,</b> halitosis, electrolyte abnormalities, abdominal discomfort, weight loss, choking, aspiration, and pneumonia. Similarly, while the absence of gastroesophageal reflux disease was an original criterion for the syndrome, it has been found that many of these patients have evidence of “pathologic gastroesophageal reflux. ” Some suggest that thorough upper gastrointestinal workup, such as upper esophageal barium studies and EGD, not be done on children presenting with rumination, despite the presence of abdominal pain or other accompanying gastrointestinal symptoms. We performed a thorough upper gastrointestinal workup on a patient with concurrent rumination syndrome and heartburn, and were intrigued to find erosive eosinophilic esophagitis on EGD.
