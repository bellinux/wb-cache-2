25|$|The poem {{is about}} a local blacksmith. Noted as being strong, he works by the sweat of his brow and does not owe anyone anything. Children coming home from school stop to stare {{at him as he}} works, {{impressed}} by the roaring bellows and burning sparks.

25|$|Progressively {{it becomes}} obvious that Bret {{was once an}} awkward, science-minded kid who brutally {{repressed}} everything authentic about himself in order to fit in. Now <b>he</b> <b>goes</b> <b>through</b> the motions of a hollow existence, unable to admit even to himself {{the depth of his}} misery. As his certainties unravel, the night does as well. A fraternity prank goes wrong and propels Bret from his comfort zone into a cross-campus adventure, where he discovers devastating truths about the house president he once idolized. Meanwhile, it becomes clear that the school and society are moving beyond the values that Bret has built his life around: while tech careers have become the hope for a dawning Information Age, his fraternity is a hated and secretly bankrupt enclave slated for demolition.

Cerberus however, views Medley and the other rogues as viruses that must be deleted before they destroy Planet B and wants to hunt them down.

Homer forms his own security company called [...] "SpringShield". Although it only has Homer, Lenny, and Carl, it is more efficient and more successful than the Springfield Police Department.

500|$|Jared Harris {{was told}} after the tenth episode {{read-through}} by series creator Matt Weiner that Lane Pryce's time {{was at an}} end. About Lane's forced retirement, Harris stated: [...] "In the beginning, he doesn't know that's the reason he's being called into the office. Once it comes up, {{he thinks he can}} bluff his way out of it. And then <b>he</b> <b>goes</b> <b>through</b> all of these emotions, from anger to denial to depression to acceptance. It was all written in there. The [...] was very specific about the different turns he would take." [...] Harris continued about his character's subsequent suicide: [...] "When Matt told me [...] idea, I laughed my ass off. When he said the car doesn't start, I just laughed for about five minutes. Nothing goes right for ...The sadness that I feel is that it's been such an amazing experience." [...] Pete's (Vincent Kartheiser), Don's (Jon Hamm), and Roger's (John Slattery) [...] "shocked and chaotic" [...] reactions to Lane's corpse were the actors' genuine reactions, according to Harris.|$|E

500|$|His Capitalism and Freedom {{brought him}} {{national}} and international attention outside academe. It was published in 1962 by the University of Chicago Press and consists of essays that used non-mathematical economic models to explore issues of public policy. [...] It sold over 400,000 copies in the first eighteen years {{and more than half}} a million since 1962. It has been translated into eighteen languages. [...] Friedman talks about the need to move to a classically liberal society, that free markets would help nations and individuals in the long-run and fix the efficiency problems currently faced by the United States and other major countries of the 1950s and 1960s. <b>He</b> <b>goes</b> <b>through</b> the chapters specifying a specific issue in each respective chapter from the role of government and money supply to social welfare programs to a special chapter on occupational licensure. Friedman concludes Capitalism and Freedom with his [...] "classical liberal" [...] stance, that government should stay out of matters that do not need and should only involve itself when absolutely necessary for the survival of its people and the country. He recounts how the best of a country's abilities come from its free markets while its failures come from government intervention.|$|E
500|$|After {{the defeat}} of the look-alike bio-noid, the door to the interdimensional rift throws wide open, and Clancy appears, telling Ryu, Irene, and Foster that they were all used as pawns in his plan to take over the ruins and claim all the life energy as his. Foster tries to follow Clancy through the door, but the energy tears him apart and is destroyed. Ryu instructs Irene to stay behind while <b>he</b> <b>goes</b> <b>through</b> the rift into the subspace, as he knows that he will be {{protected}} from the power that is inside. Ryu encounters the look-alike bio-noid again while inside the subspace, who was resurrected and transmuted into a super creature. After he defeats the look-alike, Ryu is instantly teleported into a room, where he meets Clancy once again. He tells Ryu that he has already claimed the life energy as his and explains the truth behind Castle Rock– that the ruins are a dimensional warship called the [...] "Ancient Ship of Doom". He says that [...] "these super-dimensional ruins are the foundation upon which a new world will be created", and that it will now be where all new life will originate from. The ship reappears in the real world, and Clancy then fires a test shot from the ship into the distance to demonstrate its power, which Irene watches in horror. He then drops Ryu through a trap door to the outside of the ship.|$|E
500|$|One of {{at least}} nine {{significant}} {{ways in which the}} remake deviates from its source material, [...] "Evermore" [...] is among the film's songs that emphasize the sadness and loneliness of both the Beast and Belle's situations. Occurring approximately two-thirds into the film, the song assumes a role that was originally occupied by the song [...] "If I Can't Love Her" [...] in the Broadway musical, identified by Fred Hawson of ABS-CBN News as [...] "a grand moving solo" [...] during which the Beast sincerely expresses his undying feelings for Belle. In Beauty and the Beast, [...] "Evermore" [...] appears as a solo performed by the Beast shortly before [...] "The Mob Song" [...] as the film approaches its dramatic climax. After the Beast and Belle (Emma Watson) share a dance in the castle's ballroom to Mrs. Potts (Emma Thompson) singing [...] "Beauty and the Beast", the couple has a conversation during which the Beast learns how much Belle actually misses her father, Maurice (Kevin Kline). Finally admitting that Belle is no longer his prisoner, the character sings [...] "Evermore" [...] shortly after he releases the heroine from the castle, insisting that she return to her village and protect Maurice from Gaston (Luke Evans). Believing that Belle has been lost to him forever, the Beast is heartbroken by the character's departure and laments his misfortune by performing [...] "Evermore", accepting that releasing his former prisoner makes breaking the enchantress' spell more difficult, even impossible. Serving as a culmination of both the Beast's personal and emotional journeys, Tracy Goldman of The Cornell Daily Sun observed that the song [...] "adds more depth to the character" [...] by [...] "highlighting the changes <b>he</b> <b>goes</b> <b>through</b> throughout the movie." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} {{displays}} news anchor {{reports about the}} Earth on course {{to pass through the}} tail of a comet named Eurydice, as well as displaying a worldwide panic. The rest of the video then is presented {{through the use of a}} handheld video camera. Grande is in a Fiat car as the passenger, with her boyfriend (played by Matt Bennett), who is recording. They are stuck in traffic as they try to leave the city, implied to be Los Angeles, California. While everyone around them is panicking, Grande seems to be calm as she wants to get a closer look at the comet. Impatient, she leaves the car while Bennett tries to stop her, and then follows. They make their way through the crowds, but are stopped by the police who are barricading the street. Meanwhile, the comet erupts in the sky and begins to crash to the ground as the song starts. Grande manages to get through but Bennett is unable to, so <b>he</b> <b>goes</b> <b>through</b> an open ambulance and manages to catch up with her in an alleyway with stairs leading up into an apartment complex. Ariana notices the comet in the sky. The two enter a home of a frightened family and try to leave through the other door, only for the comet to crash into the building, nearly killing both of them. Frightened, the two continue on and enter a room filled with television screens of the comet and an old man sitting at a desk. As the former two of them try to leave, the latter tries to stop them, but they knock him to the ground, and all the screens change to the same countdown timer. [...] Grande and Bennett eventually make their way up the rooftop after subduing the old man again, who had caught up with them. The camera is then set down, and shows the two of them embracing each other one last time until the comet crashes down, destroys everything and leads the Earth to an end.|$|E
2500|$|In March 2015, Hanks {{appeared}} in the Carly Rae Jepsen music video for [...] "I Really Like You", lip-syncing most of the song's lyrics as <b>he</b> <b>goes</b> <b>through</b> his daily routine.

Donovan who negotiated {{for the release of}} pilot Francis Gary Powers by the Soviet Union in exchange for KGB spy Rudolf Abel. It was released in October 2015 to a positive reception.

2500|$|The three editors {{start to}} develop their own {{conspiracy}} theory, [...] "The Plan", as part satire and part intellectual game. Starting from Ardenti's [...] "secret manuscript", they develop an intricate web of mystical connections. They also make use of Belbo's small personal computer, which he has nicknamed Abulafia. Belbo mainly uses Abulafia for his personal writings (the novel contains many excerpts of these, discovered by Casaubon as <b>he</b> <b>goes</b> <b>through</b> Abulafia's files), but it came equipped with a small program that can rearrange text at random. (Compare with the game of Dissociated Press and Ramon Llull's Ars Magna.) They use this program to create the [...] "connections" [...] which inspire their Plan. They enter randomly selected words from the Diabolicals' manuscripts, logical operators ("What follows is not true", [...] "If", [...] "Then", etc.), truisms (such as [...] "The Templars {{have something to do with}} everything") and [...] "neutral data" [...] (such as [...] "Minnie Mouse is Mickey Mouse's fiancée") and use Abulafia to create new text.|$|E
2500|$|This was the {{opposite}} of what happened to the English leg-spinner Doug Wright, a notorious no-baller with a [...] "long, springy run and windmill action" [...] that saw him overstep the line too many times. Bill O'Reilly wrote [...] "He waves his arms widely, and rocks on his legs like a small ship pitching and tossing in a fairly heavy sea. Whenever he bowls in Australia there are people who whistle and cat-call as <b>he</b> <b>goes</b> <b>through</b> his strange approach to the stumps." [...] Jack Fingleton called the no-ball [...] "Wright's curse...He's probably bowled more of these than any other spinner in history", It was easier for the umpires to call Wright for no-balling as be bowled at a slow-medium pace and Lindwall’s fast bowling was more difficult to judge, but they should have called them equally if their feet were over the line. Incidentally, Wright had a habit of licking his hand before bowling each ball which the umpires forbade in the 1950-51 Ashes series and upset his rhythm, but was allowed by Scott and Bowick in 1946-47.|$|E
