5|$|Given that Gadge is {{revealed}} {{to actually be}} a witch, Howick asked Shearsmith whether the former's character, Thomas, truly had witnessed Gadge engaging <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>kind</b> of supernatural activity. Shearsmith suggested that Thomas was motivated by greed. However, he begins to regret his choice when he witnesses Gadge being tortured. Pemberton, though, noted that the real-life accusations of witchcraft must {{have been based on}} some level of belief.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} hoard, discovered {{within a}} large ring barrow known as Istriţa Hill near Pietroasele, Romania, consisted of 22 pieces, comprising a wide assortment of gold vessels, plates and cups {{as well as}} jewellery, including two rings with inscriptions. When first uncovered, the objects were found stuck together by an unidentifiable black mass, leading to {{the assumption that the}} hoard might have been covered <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>kind</b> of organic material (e.g. cloth or leather) prior to being interred.

5|$|After Christie's {{return from}} his second combat patrol, Admiral Chester Nimitz {{recommended}} he and Lockwood meet in Brisbane and discuss joint submarine operations. During the visit, Lockwood and Christie discussed technical issues, {{as well as}} the establishment of advanced bases in Mios Woendi and Saipan. However, the meeting also resulted <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>kind</b> of personal rift between the two men. They had already clashed over the Mark 6 exploder and the Mark 14 torpedo, and some of Lockwood's staff believed Christie's ride in Harder was a risky and unnecessary stunt. After meeting with Lockwood, Christie met with MacArthur and related the events of Dealey's fifth war patrol to the general. MacArthur then decided to award Dealey a Distinguished Service Cross, and Christie the Silver Star. Additionally at this meeting, Christie found out his earlier recommendation for an army decoration to Griffith had apparently been blocked by Kinkaid. Despite Kinkaid's order regarding army decorations, MacArthur insisted on granting medals to the two men. Although Christie did not request the decorations, he was put on the spot and felt compelled to report the entire affair to Kinkaid. In the end, the general awarded the medals, displeasing Kinkaid.|$|E
