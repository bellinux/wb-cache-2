40|$|AbstractOrientations during {{drained and}} {{undrained}} triaxial shear tests on an artificially made clayey soil were studied. The {{results show that}} the orientation pattern before shearing is nearly random, although there may be some degree of preferred orientation caused by the overburden pressure. Becoming higher towards the failure plane, the degree of preferred orientation sharply increases in both tests as the compression increases until failure. It was discovered that in the consolidated undrained tests, failure occurs at higher levels of strain than previously believed, while in the consolidated <b>drained</b> <b>tests,</b> failure occurs at much lower levels of strain than previously believed. The results indicate the formation of a wider deformation zone towards and at failure in the <b>drained</b> <b>tests.</b> This is probably because particles in the <b>drained</b> <b>tests</b> have enough time to respond to the applied shear stress and change their orientation accordingly. This may explain the formation of wider deformation zones along creeping (aseismic) faults and narrow zones along seismic faults whose mechanisms are analogous to the <b>drained</b> and undrained <b>tests,</b> respectively...|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} study {{was carried out}} to investigate the static liquefaction behaviour of sand {{with a small amount}} of plastic and nonplastic fines. Five series of tests were conducted in drained and undrained conditions. The <b>drained</b> <b>test</b> results indicate not only that the failure line coincides with the critical state, but also that the development of volumetric strain during shearing was not sensitive to the initial confining pressure. In both isotropically and anisotropically consolidated undrained tests, a so-called “reverse behaviour” was consistently observed. The results were also interpreted in the critical state framework. The critical and steady state (CS/SS) data were found to trace along the same curve in e–log([*]p′) space, irrespective of the stress history and effective stress paths. A comparison between the isotropic consolidation line (ICL) and critical state (CS) curve showed that a small amount of fines can significantly change the shape and position of the ICL relative to the CS curve. Furthermore, the soil behaviour manifested in both drained and undrained shearing led to the development of a modified state parameter. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{behavior}} of Hostun RF sand on proportional strain paths at low confining pressures (20 to 100 kPa) is considered in this paper. In such paths, a constant dilation rate is imposed during shear. The usual features of pore pressure increase (contracting material) or decrease (dilating material) are here observed depending upon whether the imposed dilation rate is respectively greater or {{smaller than the}} "natural" dilation rate at failure (as measured in a <b>drained</b> <b>test).</b> Particular attention {{is given to the}} static liquefaction phenomenon, which is seen to occur for loose as well as dense sand provided the imposed dilation rate is large enough to lead to a continuous pore pressure increase during shear. Instability tests performed at low confining pressures on proportional strain paths show that the instability line is strain path dependent.

40|$|A {{hierarchical}} multiscale {{framework is}} proposed {{to model the}} mechanical behaviour of granular media. The framework employs a rigorous hierarchical coupling between the FEM and the discrete element method (DEM). To solve a BVP, the FEM is used to discretise the macroscopic geometric domain into an FEM mesh. A DEM assembly with memory of its loading history is embedded at each Gauss integration point of the mesh {{to serve as the}} representative volume element (RVE). The DEM assembly receives the global defor-mation at its Gauss point from the FEM as input boundary conditions and is solved to derive the required constitutive relation at the specific material point to advance the FEM computation. The DEM computa-tion employs simple physically based contact laws in conjunction with Coulomb’s friction for interparticle contacts to capture the loading-history dependence and highly nonlinear dissipative response of a granular material. The hierarchical scheme helps to avoid the phenomenological assumptions on constitutive relation in conventional continuum modelling and retains the computational efficiency of FEM in solving large-scale BVPs. The hierarchical structure also makes it ideal for distributed parallel computing to fully unleash its predictive power. Importantly, the framework offers rich information on the particle level with direct link to the macroscopic material response, which helps to shed lights on cross-scale understanding of granular media. The developed framework is first benchmarked by a simulation of single-element <b>drained</b> <b>test</b> an...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: In recent years, {{geotechnical}} {{engineers have}} {{paid much attention}} on reliability-based design. The probability density functions (PDFs) of the uncertain soil parameters are required for the reliability-based design. Once these PDFs are obtained, reliability analysis can be conducted, and reliability-based design can be achieved. Among the soil parameters, soil strengths play important roles in geotechnical design, e. g. friction angle of sand and undrained shear strength of clay. It {{is essential to obtain}} the PDFs of the soil strengths to facilitate reliability-based design. How to obtain those PDFs based on all available information is an important research subject. It is possible to establish the PDFs of the soil strengths based on results from sophisticated laboratory tests, e. g. <b>drained</b> <b>test</b> for sand to obtain its friction angle, but those tests may be expensive and time consuming. On the other hand, some in-situ and laboratory tests are quick and convenient, but they usually do not provide direct information on the soil strengths. Nevertheless, they do usually provide indirect information of the soil strengths by correlation, e. g. SPT-N is positively correlated to friction angle of sand, and overconsolidation ratio (OCR) is also related to undrained shear strength of clay. Therefore, it is possible to update the PDFs of the soil strengths by using the in-situ and laboratory test data. ...|$|E
40|$|Triaxial {{testing is}} {{probably}} the most widely used laboratory test by geotechnical engineers to determine the stress-strain-shear strength behaviour of saturated soils. Conventional testing requires back pressure saturation to achieve a degree of saturation {{as close as possible to}} unity. Following saturation, the sample is typically isotropically consolidated by either increasing the cell pressure of reducing the back pressure (ideally increasing the cell pressure to prevent dissolution of the air). The results of the consolidation phase are then used to select an appropriate strain rate - the rate of axial deformation. The requirements for dissipation of pore pressure during a <b>drained</b> <b>test</b> (CD) are widely recognised; equally important are the rates of axial straining in a consolidated undrained (CU) test and the relation of these strain rates to the anticipated rates of failure in the field. A comparison of current Australian Standard (AS) "informative" method for determination of the strain rate in undrained shearing is made with the American and British Standards. The AS suggests significantly higher strain rates, which will lead to higher undrained strengths between lab and field, an effect which is not well understood. Finally the AS rate is too fast to allow pore pressure equalisation prior to failure, and any test involving different stages pre-failure must use a significantly slower axial strain rate...|$|E

In this model, two hardening mechanism are comprised named volumetric hardening from a unified Critical state model for Clays and sands (CASM) by Yu (1998) and shear hardening from Hardening soil model (HSM). The basic equations and corresponding parameters are discussed. Some improvements and modifications of DHSM are introduced and the constitutive model is implemented in to Plaxis finite element code. In addition, a serial of tests on low plasticity clay performed by Gens (1982) have been carried out. Among them, drained tests including different consolidation rate and isotropic-anisotropic condition on the low plasticity clay are identified and applied by DHSM program. Variety of complex geomaterial behaviors are examined and studied based on both laboratory and numerical simulation results. Through the results, the model corresponds well with the <b>drained</b> <b>test</b> through real parameters especially during overconsolidated condition. The strain rate can be significantly decreased during hardening process which is more closed to the real behavior.

40|$|Experimental {{results are}} {{presented}} in this paper to show that a runaway type of pre-failure instability can occur for sand under dilatancy rate controlled conditions when an appropriate strain increment ratio, dεv/dε 1, is imposed. This type of instability is similar to the runaway type of instability observed for very loose sand under undrained conditions. Whether a soil element will undergo pre-failure instability depends on the difference between the strain increment ratio of the soil obtained from <b>drained</b> <b>test,</b> under a specified effective confining pressure, (dεv/dε 1) s, and the strain increment ratio imposed during the test, (dεv/dε 1) i, rather than the absolute magnitude of (dεv/dε 1) i. Based on the experimental data obtained in this study it was found that an instability line can be determined from a series of strain path tests conducted at different effective confining pressures but with the same dεv/dε 1 by joining the peak points of the effective stress paths to the origin in the q–p′ stress space. This line is similar to the instability line obtained from undrained tests on loose sand. The instability tests under dilatancy rate controlled conditions indicate that the stress ratio at the onset of instability obtained in the instability tests coincide with the peak stress ratio line. This suggests that the peak stress line can be used to predict the onset of instability under dilatancy rate controlled conditions {{in the same way as}} the use of instability line to predict the onset of instability under undrained conditions...|$|E
40|$|A {{satisfactory}} {{technique for}} determining the residual strength of overconsolidated clay has not been established yet. The authors try to estimate the residual strength by two approaches using conventional shear test apparatuses, {{considering the fact that}} the maximum shear stress and the shape of τ-ε curve are to be affected by the stress history. The first approach is to formularize the τ-ε curves obtained from the results of a long term shear test and to regard the maximum value and the final constant value of the formula as the peak strength (τ_f) and the residual strength (τ_r) respectively. In the long term shear test, the shear speed should be controlled as slow as not to affect the shear strength of the clay. Therefore, a speed controlling gear set is attached to a conventional direct shear apparatus and the readings of gauges are recorded by a self recording device. The second approach is to correct, in connection with time effect, the maximum value (τ_fq) and the final constant value (τ_uq) of the τ-ε curve obtained from the results of a quick shear test. The τ_f -log ν_s (ν_s: shear speed) and the τ_u – log ν_s relations are determined from a series of tests changing the shear speed within the allowable range of the shear test apparatus used. The shear speed (ν_st) necessary for a <b>drained</b> <b>test</b> is estimated from the coefficient of permeability of the clay. Finally, the long term shear strengths (τ_f and τ_r) are deduced from these results. Although the both results seem to coincide with, on the whole, the value of φ’_r (residual angle of shearing resistance) is a little larger in the latter case than that in the former case. The difference of the value of φ’_r will be caused by the assumption in the latter case that only the cohesion component is subjected to the time effect and the friction component is not affected from it...|$|E

40|$|Traditionally, void ratio, e {{has been}} used as a state {{variable}} for predicting the liquefaction behaviour of soils under the Critical State (Steady State) framework. Recent publications show that void ratio, e may not be a good parameter for characterizing sand with fines as the steady state, SS data points move downward in e-log(p&# 61602;) space up to certain fines content termed as threshold fines content, TFC. Thus, it was difficult to apply SS concept on sand with fines as a small variation of fines content may lead to different SS line. Many researchers proposed to used equivalent granular void ratio, e* as an alternative state variable (i. e. in lieu of void ratio, e) in attempt to obtain a narrow trend line for SS data points irrespective of fc provided fc &# 61603; TFC. The e* is obtained from e. For the conversion from e to e*, one need a parameter b which presents the active fraction of fines in overall force structure of sand. However, predicting the b is problematic. Most, if not all, of the b reported were determined by case-specific back-analysis, that is, the b-value was selected so that the test results for a given sand-fines type could be correlated with the equivalent granular void ratio, e* irrespective of fines content. This thesis examines the factors that affecting the b value by examining published work on binary packing. This leads to a simple semi-empirical equation for predicting the value of b based onparticle size ratio, &# 61539; and fines content, fc. Published data and experimental results on Sydney sand appears to be in support of the proposed equation. The single relation of SS data points in e*-log(p&# 61602;) space for sand with fines is referred as Equivalent Granular Steady State Line, EG-SSL. The EG-SSL is then used to define the equivalent granular state parameter,&# 61561;*. A good correlation observed between &# 61561;* and q-p&# 61602;, q-&# 61541; q responses in undrained shearing. The e* and &# 61561;* are also used to modified a state dependent constitutive model. Seven model input parameters are needed in addition four to critical state input parameters. These parameters are obtained from <b>drained</b> <b>test.</b> The model is used to predict q-p&# 61602;and q-&# 61541; q responses for flow, non-flow and limited flow behaviour for 0 % to 30 % fines contents. The model predictions are in good agreement with experimental results. The effect of fines types (in terms of plasticity and angularity) on the prediction equation of b are also examined with four different types of fines. A negligible effect of fines type on the prediction equation of b is observed. The link between monotonic and cyclic loading behaviour for sand with fines are also examined with emphasis on cyclic instability and strain hardening behaviour after quasi steady state, QSS for a range of fines contents (provided that fc < TFC). It is found that a single set of rules could be used to correlate monotonic and cyclic behaviour for a range of fines contents at same &# 61561;*...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2015 The {{triaxial}} test {{has been extensively}} used to evaluate both saturated and unsaturated soil behaviors. The conventional {{triaxial test}} apparatus for saturated soils cannot be used to test unsaturated soils due to difficulties in soil volume and suction measurement. In 1961, a suction-controlled triaxial test apparatus was developed to investigate behavior of unsaturated soils. Since this development, the suction-controlled test has been widely used for unsaturated soil characterization. Most important concepts concerning unsaturated soil mechanics were developed based upon results from suction-controlled tests. However, the suction-controlled triaxial test on unsaturated soils, which is a <b>drained</b> <b>test,</b> is usually laborious, time-consuming, and costly, {{and may not be}} justifiable for routine engineering projects. The constant water content (undrained) test has been widely used to investigate saturated soil behaviors. However, for unsaturated soils, due to difficulties in direct, rapid, and reliable suction measurement, the constant water content test was rarely used for unsaturated soil behavior evaluation. In addition, accurate volume change measurement of unsaturated soils was a great challenge for researchers. Recently, the Modified State Surface Approach (MSSA) has been developed to calibrate unsaturated soil behaviors. According to MSSA, both results from suction-controlled and constant water content triaxial tests can be used for constitutive behavior calibration on unsaturated soils. In this study, a new triaxial test system was developed to investigate unsaturated soil behaviors through constant water content triaxial tests. To measure soil suction variation during testing, a new type of high-suction tensiometer was developed based on a commercial miniature pressure transducer. A 15 bar air-entry ceramic disc was used as the filter of the high-suction tensiometer. After saturation and calibration, this new type of high-suction tensiometer could be utilized for matric suction measurement on unsaturated soils with a maximum measurable suction up to 1100 kPa determined via a free evaporation test. To measure the volume change of unsaturated soils during triaxial testing, a photogrammetry-based method was developed by integrating photogrammetry, optical-ray tracing, and least-square estimation techniques. Through two validation tests on a stainless steel cylinder and a saturated sand specimen, the average point and total volume change measurement accuracy were determined to be approximately 0. 065 mm and 0. 05 %, respectively. With this method, the conventional triaxial test apparatus for saturated soils can be used for triaxial testing on unsaturated soils without any modification. In addition to total volume change measurement, the newly developed photogrammetry-based method {{can also be used to}} investigate the deformation characteristics of soils during triaxial testing such as full-field deformation, volumetric strain non-uniformity, full-field strain distribution, and shear band evolution process. To evaluate the performance of the new triaxial testing system, a series of constant water content triaxial tests were carried out on unsaturated soils. New methods were proposed to characterize shear strength of the tested unsaturated soils. Also, an example was given to calibrate the constitutive behavior of an unsaturated soil based on results from the constant water content triaxial tests. Analysis results indicated that the proposed triaxial testing system is a cost effective and time efficient alternative to the suction-controlled triaxial testing system. In geotechnical and highway engineering, many projects involve unsaturated soils at shallow depths with low confining stresses (less than 100 kPa). To investigate the behavior of unsaturated soils at low confining stresses, the new triaxial testing system was simplified to a modified unconfined compression testing system. In this simplified system, negative air pressure (i. e., vacuum pressure) was used to provide the low confining stress for the triaxial tests. The high-suction tensiometers were used to monitor soil matrix suction variation during testing. A photogrammetric method was utilized for deformation measurements of unsaturated soils during triaxial testing. A series of undrained triaxial tests was also carried out to demonstrate the use of the modified unconfined compression testing system for unsaturated soil behavior evaluation under different confining stresses...|$|E
40|$|The Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta is a 700, 000 acre estuary at the {{confluence}} of the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers, which consists of below sea-level islands surrounded by levees. Many of theses levees are not engineered structures, consisting of uncompacted sands, silts, clays, and organics often founded upon natural levees and in some cases on peaty organic soil. Many hazards threaten the Delta, but the seismic hazard is exceptional because of the potential for multiple simultaneous breaches inundating many islands within the Delta. The objectives of this research are to improve fundamental understanding of cyclic and post-cyclic behavior of peat that could affect levee performance, and develop analysis tools to predict this behavior. Laboratory testing is performed on 22 undisturbed Shelby tube samples gathered from Sherman Island at depths ranging from approximately 1 to 6 m. The shear testing in this research is carried out using the UCLA bi-directional broadband simple shear device, which is a digitally-controlled device with capabilities for chamber pressure control and multidirectional excitation. The apparatus was improved as part of this research program to add capabilities for testing under constant-height and stress-controlled conditions. Oedometer tests are carried out on Sherman Island peat to evaluate its compressibility properties. To facilitate accurate determination of the end of primary consolidation, a new consolidometer was fabricated that provides single drainage through the top of the specimen, while pore pressure is measured at the bottom. For specimens with high organic content (OC > 28 %), values of coefficient of consolidation (c_v) for normally-consolidated load stages are observed to decrease as vertical effective stress increases, often by more than two orders of magnitude over the stress range tested in the consolidometer. For the Sherman Island peat c_v is as high as 400 〖? 10 〗^(- 4) cm 2 /s at σ_p^'. The trend of compression index (Cc), and recompression index (Cr) confirms that they are positively correlated with in situ water content (w 0) and OC. The values of C_α⁄C_c (where C_αis secondary compression index) for the Sherman Island peat ranges from 0. 05 to as high as 0. 12 with an average of 0. 08. Hydraulic conductivity k depends on void ratio, and decreases with the decrease in void ratio. The slope of e versus logk (i. e., C_k) increases with initial void ratio (e 0), and the best fit for the data is C_k= 0. 20 e_ 0. Monotonic test results show that lightly overconsolidated peat with OCR < 2 shows contractive behavior, while higher OCR’s result in dilative behavior. The Normal Consolidation Line (NCL) and Failure State Line (FSL) are approximately parallel for OC ≤ 35 %. Normalized shear strength (the normalization is with respect to pre-shear vertical effective stress) has been evaluated as a function of OCR. The soil behavior generally supports the concept of normalization, with the strength ratio being higher for high OC (80 - 85 %) than for low OC (≤ 35 %). Cyclic strain-controlled tests show that for low shear strain amplitude, γ_c (< 0. 7 %), although hysteretic loops form, cyclic degradation of stiffness does not occur and pore pressures do not accumulate. Accordingly, stress paths are similar to those for a <b>drained</b> <b>test.</b> For higher 〖 γ〗_c, r_ur increases from cycle-to-cycle and reaches to around 0. 1 after 15 cycles at 4 % shear strain. The soil stiffness degrades slightly to achieve the uniform strain amplitude. One of the principle contributions in this dissertation is to demonstrate that evaluation of the rate of secondary compression following primary consolidation is related to the vertical distance in void ratio – effective stress space between soil state and a secondary compression reference line (SCRL). The traditional approach takes this rate as logarithmically decaying with time following load application, but is shown to not be generally applicable. For example, it fails for the case of a small load increment applied to a soil element. I develop a conceptual and analytical framework to compute the rate of void ratio change as a function of soil state given this framework, which predicts slower secondary compression as OCR (overconsolidation ratio) increases. The proposed framework provides a much improved match to observations for conditions differing from those in traditional consolidation tests in which the ratio of load increase to initial stress is approximately unity. When peaty organic soils are cyclically loaded, they can experience an increase of secondary compression rate relative what would have been present without dynamic loading. This increased rate of volume change occurs even for shear strain amplitudes that do not induce a pore pressure response. For a given soil, the rate change increases with strain amplitude and number of cycles, which {{can be viewed as a}} partial resetting the secondary compression clock without change in total stress. However, rather than modeling this in a time-based framework, I demonstrate that this reset behavior can be captured by a vertical shift of the SCRL, which can be quantified by a reset index (I_R). The value of I_R varies between 0 (no reset) to 1 (fully reset). An empirical model is developed for I_R as a function of cyclic shear strain amplitude, number of uniform loading cycles, organic content, over-consolidation ratio, initial overburden pressure, and amount of static shear stress. A simplified procedure is developed to estimate post-earthquake settlement of organic soils in consideration of post-earthquake pore pressure dissipation and accelerated rates of secondary compression. The procedure uses 1 -D site response analysis to find representative profiles of peak shear strain and its phasing in time. The irregular shear strain time series is then converted to uniform shear strain cycles at some specified amplitude as a fraction of the peak. Reset index and pore pressure ratio at the conclusion of shaking are then calculated using predictions equations conditioned on strain amplitude, number of cycles, over-consolidation ratio, organic content, and pre-earthquake stress conditions. The resulting values of reset index and pore pressure can be used in a non-linear consolidation code to calculate post-earthquake settlement versus time...|$|E
40|$|A non-associated {{plasticity}} {{model for}} friction materials was presented by Krenk (1999) and an efficient calibration procedure developed by Ahadi & Krenk (1999). The {{ability of the}} model to represent the behaviour of sand was verified by calibrating the model from different sets of triaxial <b>drained</b> <b>tests</b> for both loose and dense sand performed at different confining pressures. This paper {{is a collection of}} calibration and prediction examples. The model was calibrated according to the procedure described in Ahadi & Krenk (1999) and results were compared to experimental data from Borup & Hedegaard (1995) and Ibsen & Jakobssen (1996). The obtained material parameters indicate that the shear modulus $G$ should increase with the mean stress, while the increase of the bulk stiffness should be less than linear. The dependency on mean stress is studied by fitting a power law function for both $G$ and $kappa$. Finally prediction for undrained (constant volume) test at different initial pressures are presented with material parameter determined from <b>drained</b> triaxial <b>test</b> data...|$|R
40|$|Americium and curium were {{produced}} in the past at the Savannah River Site (SRS) for research, medical, and radiological applications. They have been stored in a nitric acid solution in an SRS reprocessing facility {{for a number of}} years. Vitrification of the americium/curium (Am/Cm) solution will allow the material to be safely stored or transported to the DOE Oak Ridge Reservation. Oak Ridge is responsible for marketing radionuclides for research and medical applications. The bushing melter technology being used in the Am/Cm vitrification research work is also under consideration for the stabilization of other actinides such as neptunium and plutonium. A series of melter <b>drain</b> <b>tests</b> were conducted at the Savannah River Technology Center to determine the relationship between the drain tube assembly operating variables and the resulting pour initiation times, glass flowrates, drain tube temperatures, and stop pour times. Performance criteria such as ability to start and stop pours in a controlled manner were also evaluated. The tests were also intended to provide support of oil modeling of drain tube performance predictions and thermal modeling of the drain tube and drain tube heater assembly. These <b>drain</b> <b>tests</b> were instrumental in the design of subsequent melter drain tube and drain tube heaters for the Am/Cm bushing melter, and therefore in the success of the Am/Cm vitrification and plutonium immobilization programs...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} our study was to {{evaluate}} the results of endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) {{in the management of}} patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (INPH). Methods: Our prospective study included seven patients (five men and two women; ages ranging between 68 and 78 years) with two or more typical NPH symptoms of short duration (< 6 months), with no other morbidity factors, with a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score ≥ 18, aqueductal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) stroke volume ≥ 42 μL, and positive lumbar <b>drain</b> <b>test.</b> The etiology of NPH was idiopathic in all of these cases. Their preoperative work-up included brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and cine-MR, MMSE test, and CSF lumbar <b>drain</b> <b>test,</b> in all cases. The clinical status of all participants was graded using the Japanese intractable hydrocephalus system. An ETV was performed in all participants. Follow-up included periodic clinical evaluations, MMSE, and MRI with cine-MR studies. The follow-up time range was 12 - 72 months. Results: The mean postoperative clinical grade was 3. 1, while the preoperative was 6. 1. Gait disturbance and urinary incontinence were the most responsive symptoms. The mean postoperative MMSE score was 23. 6, while the preoperative score was 20. 3. The mean postoperative aqueductal CSF stroke volume, 6 months after the procedure, was 31. 6 μL, while the preoperative volume was 48. 8 μL. Conclusions: ETV may be a safe alternative surgical option for a limited number of carefully selected INPH patients...|$|R

The increase of the shear strength of the sand with the matric suction is very small and {{there is almost no}} increase of that over 20 kPa of the matric suction.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a hyperbolic mathematical model {{to predict the}} complete stress-strain curve of <b>drained</b> triaxial <b>tests</b> on uniform dense sand. The model was formed in one equation with many parameters. The main parameters that are needed to run the model are the confining pressure, angle of friction and the relative density. The other parameters, initial and final slopes of the stress strain curve, the reference stress and the curve-shape parameter are determined as functions of the confining pressure, angle of friction and the relative density using best fitting curve technique from the experimental <b>tests</b> results. <b>Drained</b> triaxial <b>tests</b> were run on clean white uniform sand to utilize and verify this model. These tests were carried out at four levels of confining pressure of 100, 200, 300 and 400 kPa. This model was used to predict the stress-strain curves for <b>drained</b> triaxial <b>tests</b> on quartz sand at different relative density using the data of Kouner [1]. The model predictions were compared with the experimental results and showed good agreements of the predicted results with the experimental results {{at all levels of}} applied confining pressures and relative densities...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The nonhomogeneous {{behavior}} of structured soils during triaxial tests {{has been studied}} using a finite element model based on the Structured Cam Clay constitutive model with Biot-type consolidation. The effect of inhomogeneities caused by the end restraint is studied by simulating <b>drained</b> triaxial <b>tests</b> for samples with a height to diameter ratio of 2. It was discovered that {{with the increase in}} degree of soil structure with respect to the same soil at the reconstituted state, the inhomogeineities caused by the end restraint will increase. By loading the sample at different strain rates and assuming different hydraulic boundary conditions, inhomogeneities caused by partial drainage were investigated. It was found that if drainage is allowed from all faces of the specimen, fully <b>drained</b> <b>tests</b> can be carried out at strain rates about ten times higher than those required when the drainage is allowed only in the vertical direction at {{the top and bottom of}} the specimen, confirming the findings of previous studies. Both end restraint and partial drainage can cause bulging of the triaxial specimen around mid-height. Inhomogeneities due to partial drainage influence the stress–strain behavior during destructuring, a characteristic feature of a structured soil. With an increase in the strain rate, the change in voids ratio during destructuration reduces, but...|$|R

40|$|Dynamic {{consolidation}} {{method for}} compacting base ground {{has been adopted}} on a various type of soils in the past decade. However, its theoretical evaluation has not been fully developed yet, because its mechanism of improvement is too complex. Impulsive loading triaxial test apparatus was developed in this study {{for the purpose of}} testing soil elements applying the stress increments induced by dropping hanmmer. Furthermore, a compressibility of sandy soil under various stress increments and drainage conditions were investigated by using the apparatus. As a result, at first, it was found {{that in the case of}} undrained tests, the compaction of soil was produced by dissipation of induced pore water pressure after undrained loading.

Isotropic and <b>drained</b> triaxial <b>tests</b> were performed in a very wide range of confining pressures (up to 60 MPa). After presenting the stress-strain curve pattern and the mean stress influence on the shear behaviour, the paper focuses on the definition of a strength criterion and of the yield surface for this material.
