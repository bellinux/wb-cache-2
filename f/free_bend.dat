This term generally refers to testing and analysis focused on the quality and strength of the weld, but may refer to technological actions to check for the presence, position and extent of welds. These are divided into destructive and non-destructive methods. A few examples of destructive testing include macro etch testing, fillet-weld break tests, transverse tension tests, and guided bend tests. Other destructive methods include acid etch testing, back bend testing, tensile strength break testing, nick break testing, and <b>free</b> <b>bend</b> testing. Non-destructive methods include fluorescent penetrate tests, magnaflux tests, eddy current (electromagnetic) tests, hydrostatic testing, tests using magnetic particles, X-rays and gamma ray based methods and acoustic emission techniques. [...] Other methods include ferrite and hardness testing.|$|E
40|$|Electrical {{isolation}} {{using the}} ablation catheter {{has been widely}} used as the golden standard {{for the treatment of}} atrial fibrillation. Clinical practice shows that the tip orientation affects the formation of the effective lesion size. However, the traditional unidirectional or bidirectional catheter with the compliant bending shapes cannot provide great orientation capability to target the lesion paths asymmetric to the catheter&# 39;s entry point. In this letter, we propose a two-dimensional (2 -D) tendon-actuated asymmetric catheter to render two different bending characteristics to adapt to the special anatomy. The contact-aided compliant mechanism is adopted by designing the asymmetric blocks to form the self-collision in one lateral bending direction. Kinematics with asymmetric bends under the <b>free</b> <b>bend</b> and constraint bend are investigated. The algorithm of 3 -D path exploration in the confined workspace is proposed to validate the reachability. The bending angles of two asymmetric bends are compared and the 3 -D phantom study is carried out to validate its effectiveness. Results indicate that the contact-aided compliant mechanism can be integrated with the steerable catheter successfully to help form the different bending characteristics, finally improving the tip orientation capability to the specific ablation line lesions...|$|E
40|$|Sheet metal {{products}} {{are widely used}} in various industries nowadays. Among those, bent parts are made by performing linear bends on the sheet metal blanks prepared according to the unfolding of the corresponding designs. Computer aided process planning (CAPP) for bent parts consists of closely related tasks. In this context, the aspects of tool selection and dimensional accuracy verification have been tackled in this study. Due to the industrial requirements for part complexity and tool variety, simple mapping compatible and collision-free tools to bend lines merely based on part descriptions is not plausible. Meanwhile, the interrelation between tool selection and bend sequencing makes automated tool selection a combinatorial problem. The current research {{has resulted in a}} proactive strategy to downscale the problem complexity. Tools are firstly preselected based on the collision prone details obtained from the analysis of part geometries, and secondly refined according to the collisions detected while planning for abend sequence. Moreover, a generic approach founded on a set of rules is proposed for individual tool selections by evaluating the encountered collision scenarios. Besides, three complementary strategies for optimising the tool collection selected for a part have been worked out by considering production planning requirements. Overall, a tool selection methodology has been developed {{as an integral part of}} CAPP to obtain a feasible and well-optimised tool set for part production. The methodology hasbeen partially implemented in an industrial software package that delivers feasible results within a limited time span. Once a process plan is confirmed with a collision <b>free</b> <b>bend</b> sequence and an appropriate tool assignment, its compatibility with the tolerance plan imposed on the part should be verified. In the last part of this study, together with the insight of the sources of errors, an analytical stochastic model has been established for an efficient estimation of the distributions of the resulting global dimensions once the bend sequence and the distributions of the elementary errors are known. Therefore, the error stack-up and the stochasticity of the process have been incorporated with economic time complexity. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Dexterous {{continuum}} manipulators (DCMs) can largely {{increase the}} reachable region and steerability for minimally and less invasive surgery. Many such procedures require the DCM {{to be capable}} of producing large deflections. The real-time control of the DCM shape requires sensors that accurately detect and report large deflections. We propose a novel, large deflection, shape sensor to track the shape of a 35 mm DCM designed for a less invasive treatment of osteolysis. Two shape sensors, each with three fiber Bragg grating sensing nodes is embedded within the DCM, and the sensors&# 39; distal ends fixed to the DCM. The DCM centerline is computed using the centerlines of each sensor curve. An experimental platform was built and different groups of experiments were carried out, including <b>free</b> <b>bending</b> and three cases of bending with obstacles. For each experiment, the DCM drive cable was pulled with a precise linear slide stage, the DCM centerline was calculated, and a 2 D camera image was captured for verification. The reconstructed shape created with the shape sensors is compared with the ground truth generated by executing a 2 D- 3 D registration between the camera image and 3 D DCM model. Results show that the distal tip tracking accuracy is 0. 40 ± 0. 30 mm for the <b>free</b> <b>bending</b> and 0. 61 ± 0. 15 mm, 0. 93 ± 0. 05 mm and 0. 23 ± 0. 10 mm for three cases of bending with obstacles.

30|$|Factors which {{determine}} the stiffness of a fixator construct depend on its two main constituents: the device material and configuration {{on one hand}} and the pins on the other.

Other pin factors that add to fixator rigidity are increased pin spread (length of the fractured bone involved in fixation), increased pin numbers and levels and lastly, increased pin divergent angle in the axial plane [7, 11, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25]. Considering the aforementioned factors, the design of the external fixator used in this study can be considered as a modification of the Catagni and Cattaneo module in 1986 [11, 12] but where the distal rings are replaced by femoral arches.|$|R

Exploiting Boolean vectors, a novel assembly scheme is developed {{which can be}} used to enforce the continuity requirements at the edges of delamination region, leading to a delamination stiffness term.

It may be used where the residual stress distribution is symmetrical about the mid-surface as {{it is usually the}} case for frequently-used sheet metal post-processing techniques such as skin-pass or temper rolling, tension- and roller leveling. An existing inverse technique is used to obtain a residual stress profile and material constants that provide the best fit in a finite element analysis of bending with the experimentally derived moment-curvature relation. The method is verified for bending of a low-carbon stainless steel using measurement of residual stress by X-ray diffraction. The residual stresses were induced in the sheet by cold rolling. The technique described here can be used industrially as a rapid method of investigating residual stresses in incoming sheet. In processes where the deformation is principally one of bending, such as cold roll forming, it is known that residual stresses have an influence on shape defects and springback and the method presented here can be used to determine whether incoming sheet is suitable for further processing and also as a means of obtaining improved material data input for numerical simulation...|$|R
