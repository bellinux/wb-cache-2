40|$|Many {{existing}} {{theories of}} financial intermediation have difficulty explaining why financial activity can generate large real effects.

We characterize the equilibria by showing the comparative-static responses of <b>key</b> <b>aggregates</b> {{to changes in the}} pure rate of time preference, investment uncertainty, and bank costs. We find that the results depend crucially on the intertemporal elasticity of labor supply and the aggregate level of employment.

The latter is expressed by the relative size of the elasticity of maintenance to the Hicksian elasticity of complementarity between maintenance and utilization.

The main conclusions of the paper are the following: In order to implement the central economic preferences it is necessary to make macro-economic decisions in all the above-mentioned investment problems.

40|$|This is paper {{introduces}} a new single-pass reservoir weighted-sampling stream aggregation algorithm, Priority-Based Aggregation (PBA). While order sampling {{is a powerful}} and e cient method for weighted sampling from a stream of uniquely keyed items, there is no current algorithm that realizes the benefits of order sampling {{in the context of}} stream aggregation over non-unique keys. A naive approach to order sample regardless of key then aggregate the results is hopelessly inefficient. In distinction, our proposed algorithm uses a single persistent random variable across the lifetime of each key in the cache, and maintains unbiased estimates of the <b>key</b> <b>aggregates</b> that can be queried at any point in the stream. The basic approach can be supplemented with a Sample and Hold pre-sampling stage with a sampling rate adaptation controlled by PBA. This approach represents a considerable reduction in computational complexity compared with {{the state of the art}} in adapting Sample and Hold to operate with a fixed cache size. Concerning statistical properties, we prove that PBA provides unbiased estimates of the true aggregates. We analyze the computational complexity of PBA and its variants, and provide a detailed evaluation of its accuracy on synthetic and trace data. Weighted relative error is reduced by 40 % to 65 % at sampling rates of 5 % to 17 %, relative to Adaptive Sample and Hold; there is also substantial improvement for rank queriesComment: 10 page...|$|E
40|$|While much {{attention}} {{has focused on}} the modelling of the interdependencies between <b>key</b> <b>aggregates</b> and stock indices in industrialised countries, this thesis is focused on investments in emerging markets and real estate � two research branches that have up to now not been investigated to a comparable extent. The analysis of individual scientific issues therefore contributes to improving the understanding of conditions and essential interrelationships in these markets and sectors. Within the scope of the present thesis, the empirical results are mainly based on the Johansen (1988) procedure. The use of vector error correction models (VECM) guarantees that the dynamic character among the selected determinants is taken into account and furthermore allows the evaluation of both the long-term equilibrium relationships and the channels during the adjustment process after deviations from the long-term trend. In addition, the empirical results are verified by employing further analyses in order to gain deeper insights into the respective scientific issue. In Chapter 2 the study examines �Macroeconomic Effects on Emerging Market Sector Indices�. As emerging countries continue to gain in importance for the world economy, it is worthwhile extending research into regions that have up to now been comparatively neglected. Contrary to the a priori defined hypotheses, the majority of the exam-ined sectors benefited from increasing commodity prices during the examination sample. As a result, this finding provides empirical evidence on the suspicion that the ongoing catching-up process and the consequential growth in affluence in the emerging countries is largely driven by growing commodity prices and exports. According to that, not only those sectors which are closely linked to commodity trade activities benefit from rising prices. Instead, via the channels of increasing consumption rates and growing domestic purchasing power within the emerging economies, the remaining sectors also benefit from the increase in export earnings. In contrast to Chapter 2, which conducts a cross-sectoral comparison, the fol-lowing chapters are focused on the real estate sector in particular. The scientific approach of Chapter 3 is similar to the first one and is focused on �The Link between Property and Economy� in the German and British real estate markets. On a long-term basis, the results of the implemented VEC models indicate re-markable similarities between both examined real estate markets. Accordingly, in spite of the outlined differences, the long-term equilibrium is determined by the same factors indicating the same signs and the same magnitude of coeffi-cients. Consequently, the empirical results clarify that the fundamental role of property markets in an economy dominates country-specific characteristics in the long run. The distinctive features of the national property markets, however, are primarily relevant during the adjustment process after deviations from the long-term equilibrium. Although the economic environment is also considered in Chapter 4, this study is primarily aimed at the scientific issue of whether real estate stock indices in the United States and the United Kingdom are predominantly driven by the underlying property markets or by progress on general stock markets. For this purpose, an alternative approach is used. Instead of focussing only on the assets of real estate equities, direct real estate and stock indices � as was frequently done in previous studies � the macroeconomic environment is here explicitly taken into account in each country. As real estate markets are known to be cyclical in nature (Lizieri et al., 1998), it is therefore supposed that the structure of market behaviour differs across phases of boom and bust. This might be recognisable by lower adjustment velocities after deviations from the equilibrium or by different volatilities of property values depending on the economic situation. Accordingly, the implemented methods indicate a significantly stronger linkage among the real estate assets compared to the equity assets in the long run. Therefore, this study clarifies that long-term investments in real estate equity indices still fulfil their function as an alternative investment in order to diversify an investor´s portfolio...|$|E
