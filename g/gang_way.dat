60|$|What had she learned? Sight of {{the black}} horse grazing near seemed to prompt the trenchant replies. Spades belonged to Jean Isbel. He had been stolen by her father or by one of her father's accomplices. Isbel's vaunted cunning as a tracker had been no idle boast. Her father was a horse thief, a rustler, a {{sheepman}} only as a blind, a consort of Daggs, leader of the Hash Knife Gang. Ellen well remembered the ill repute of that <b>gang,</b> <b>way</b> back in Texas, years ago. Her father had gotten in with this famous band of rustlers to serve his own ends--the extermination of the Isbels. It was all very plain now to Ellen.|$|E

50|$|During {{the first}} years of Prohibition, the Rats {{controlled}} most of the illegal bootlegging in and around St. Louis. They also began to supplement their bootlegging profits with armed robberies that victimized banks, armored cars, and messengers. It was estimated that Egan's Rats stole nearly $4,000,000 over a five-year period. Colbeck was ruthless with anyone who got in the <b>gang's</b> <b>way,</b> including its own members.|$|R

With two copies of the <b>gang's</b> <b>way,</b> Po explains the bandits must follow the rules {{as they have been}} set out from the beginning. The two items are divided between the two men. Nongoloza receives the hide and Ngeleketshane receives the rock. The two are instructed to carry them wherever they go. The rock, however, proves to be too awkward to carry and one day it is accidentally dropped down a hill. It splits into two pieces, one of which falls into a river. This leaves Ngeleketshane's gang with only half of the gang's laws.|$|R

Neither O'Bodkins, {{the principal of the}} school, nor his assistants (with the exception of the 16-year-old Grip) care much about the well-being of children, let alone their conduct or education, and Lit'l Fellow continues to suffer, now at the hands of his peers (particularly Carker, the leader of the gang) for honesty and dignity which he has begun to show at such early years, and hence refusal to follow the <b>gang's</b> <b>ways</b> of theft and panhandling. Lit'l Fellow recalls what he remembers of the early years of his life to Grip (who has become a close friend of the boy), mentioning an evil woman Hard and a compassionate girl named Sissy - the only person who cared for him in his early years, and whom he indeed came to think of as an elder sister. After the death of yet another child who lived with them, Lit'l Fellow ran away from Hard's hut, only to be found by Thornpipe.|$|R

5000|$|The Gang Supervision Unit (GSU) members {{supervise}} parolees statewide who {{are known}} gang members. The Unit uses several aggressive methods to prevent gang violence and recruitment. These include intensive supervision of parolees, and sharing gang intelligence with the FBI, {{state and local}} law enforcement agencies. The officers' interaction with these parolees gives them a unique, street-level view of the <b>ways</b> <b>gang</b> membership affects individuals and communities, and the <b>ways</b> <b>gangs</b> attempt to lure young people. Additionally, the Gang Supervision Unit members also conduct gang education and recognition training for hospitals, universities, public schools and municipal police departments, based on up-to-the-minute information collected during their everyday duties. The Gang Supervision Unit also provides Gang Resistance Education and Training (GREAT) programming for elementary school students.|$|R

50|$|According to some critics, the vagueness of gang {{injunctions}} and <b>gang</b> identification give <b>way</b> to {{a system}} of policing that uses racial profiling to classify and criminalize civilians, even if innocent. Police are accused of using stereotypes that are perpetuated through the media to target potential gang members. Therefore, urban youth of color (often African American or Latino) implicitly become the targets of gang injunctions.|$|R

During his quest, Tommy discovers that he has 5 half-brothers; Mexican burro rider Ramon (Schneider), whose innkeeper mother Frank had a fling with; mentally challenged yet happy-go-lucky Lil' Pete (Lautner), who has a strong neck that makes him immune to hanging; feral mountain-man Herm (Garcia), who speaks incomprehensibly; guilt-ridden drunkard Danny (Wilson), who served as a bodyguard for Abraham Lincoln until accidentally leading John Wilkes Booth to murder him; and African-American saloon pianist Chico (Crews), who confesses to be only 50 percent white; all of which join Tommy. Meanwhile, Clem joins the eye patch gang in hopes of finding Tommy to take revenge on him after Clem removes his only functional eye (since the other eye patch wearers claim that removing the right eye is part of the <b>gang's</b> <b>way)</b> before they kidnap Tommy's fiancee, though she manages to escape them due to Clem's poor eyesight and heads out to find Frank. When meeting Chico and Danny, they run with Chico's boss: the aggressive, always smiling saloon owner Smiley Harris (Keitel), who was part of Frank's gang until Frank stole his cut of their biggest score and left him to die at the windmill. He owns a large golden nugget the brothers steal after Ramon, while riding his burro, accidentally decapitates Smiley with a shovel from behind just as he is about to shoot the brothers as revenge against Frank for his betrayal, though Ramon was only trying to knock him out.|$|R

40|$|Gangs were {{a target}} of {{widespread}} political and social attention during the 1990 s, and despite a short-lived lull in policy focus, gangs are recently receiving increased attention from policymakers. In spite of political concern about gangs, very little research had examined perceptions of gangs. By conducting face-to-face interviews with thirty of thirty-five county prosecutors, this study {{was among the first}} to examine prosecutors' perspectives of gangs in Gainesville, Florida, an area that could be considered an "emerging" gang city. Themes from the interviews were extracted and included prosecutorial perceptions of the: (1) definition and prevalence of gangs in Gainesville, Florida; (2) personal and social characteristics of gang members; (3) reasons people join gangs; and (4) best approaches to stop or eliminate <b>gangs.</b> The <b>ways</b> in which prosecutors' perspectives mirror prior research on gangs is highlighted. ...|$|R

5000|$|The Panopticon was the {{ultimate}} realization of a modern disciplinary institution. It allowed for constant observation characterized by an [...] "unequal gaze"; the constant possibility of observation. Perhaps the most important feature of the panopticon {{was that it was}} specifically designed so that the prisoner could never be sure whether they were being observed at any moment. The unequal gaze caused the internalization of disciplinary individuality, and the docile body required of its inmates. This means one is less likely to break rules or laws if they believe they are being watched, even if they are not. Thus, prisons, and specifically those that follow the model of the Panopticon, provide the ideal form of modern punishment. Foucault argues that this is why the generalized, [...] "gentle" [...] punishment of public work <b>gangs</b> gave <b>way</b> to the prison. It was the ideal modernization of punishment, so its eventual dominance was natural.|$|R
