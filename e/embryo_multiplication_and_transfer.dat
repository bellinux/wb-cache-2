A {{problem is to}} find a protocol such that under the condition that any eavesdropper intercepting any quantum system being exchanged among the parties must not be able to acquire information, the parties compute an arithmetic operation such as addition <b>and</b> <b>multiplication,</b> <b>and</b> <b>transfer</b> its computing result to another party. One of main ideas to solve this problem is based on operating state phases. A quantum addition algorithm based on operating phases has been proposed by Draper, but his algorithm was not considered being eavesdropped. We propose secure quantum arithmetic protocols...|$|R
40|$|Neural retinas of 6 -day-old chick embryos {{synthesize}} DNA and {{are able}} to carry out DNA excision repair. However, in contrast to the situation in human cells, the maximum rate of repair induced by N-acetoxy acetylaminofluorene (AAAF) is no greater than that induced by methyl methanesulfonate (MMS). With advancing differentiation of the retina in the <b>embryo,</b> cell <b>multiplication</b> <b>and</b> DNA synthesis decline and cease, and concurrently the cells lose the ability to carry out DNA excision repair. Thus, in 15 - 16 -day embryos, in which the level of DNA synthesis is very low, DNA repair is barely detectable. If retinas from 14 -day embryos are dissociated with trypsin and the cell suspension is plated in growth- promoting medium, DNA synthesis is reinitiated; however, in these cultures there is no detectable repair of MMS-induced damage, and only low levels of repair are observed after treatment with AAAF. A cell line was produced, by repeated passaging of these cultures, in which the cell population reached a steady state of DNA replication. However, the cell population remained deficient in the ability to repair MMS-induced damage. This cell line most likely predominantly comprises cells of retino-glial origin. Possible correlations between deficiency in DNA repair mechanisms in replicating cells and carcinogenesis in neural tissues are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Mutation {{induction}} and biotechnological {{techniques are}} current approaches used in plant breeding. At present work, both methodologies were combined {{in order to}} obtain a mutation-breeding model in avocado. In vitro germination and rooting of zygotic <b>embryos,</b> sprout <b>multiplication</b> <b>and</b> plantlets adaptation in Cuban avocado varieties were studied. Percentage of germinated entire embryos were higher using mature than immature embryos. Near of 80 % of entire plantlets obtained by embryo culture technique were adapted to greenhouse conditions. Based on inhibition of entire sprout fraction, radiosensibility curves for Duke and Hass varieties were developed. Inhibition of entire sprout fraction was described by a second order polynomial equation. Fit of experimental data and theoretical model was equal to 0. 96 and 0. 95 for Hass and Duke radiosensibility curves, respectively. LD 50 values defined as the dose, at which the 50 % of entire sprout fraction are inhi-bited, were determined in 27 and 28 Gy for Hass and Duke varieties, respectively. Gamma-rays mutagenic doses for zygotic embryos of both varieties were also established between 19 and 25 Gy. Applied mutagenic dose did not affect significantly plantlets development. However, leaf and root anomalies, atrophied and chlorophyll-deficient shoots and albinism were observed at doses higher than LD 50 values. The usefulness of the combined approach to improve avocado varieties was discussed. This in vitro methodology appears as an alternative to traditional breeding met-hods, particularly for improving agronomic characteristics as rot-root resistance and salt toleran-ce in avocado...|$|R
40|$|Background The {{importance}} of historical contingency {{in determining the}} potential of viral populations to evolve has been largely unappreciated. Identifying the constraints imposed by past adaptations is, however, of importance for understanding many questions in evolutionary biology, such as the evolution of host usage dynamics by multi-host viruses or the emergence of escape mutants that persist {{in the absence of}} antiviral treatments. To address this issue, we undertook an experimental approach in which sixty lineages of Tobacco etch potyvirus that differ in their past evolutionary history and degree of adaptation to Nicotiana tabacum were allowed to adapt to this host for 15 rounds of within host <b>multiplication</b> <b>and</b> <b>transfer.</b> We thereafter evaluated the degree of adaptation to the new host {{as well as to the}} original ones and characterized the consensus sequence of each lineage. Results We found that past evolutionary history did not determine the phenotypic outcome of this common host evolution phase, and that the signal of local adaptation to past hosts had largely disappeared. By contrast, evolutionary history left footprints at the genotypic level, since the majority of host-specific mutations present at the beginning of this experiment were retained in the end-point populations and may have affected which new mutations were consequently fixed. This resulted in further divergence between the sequences despite a shared selective environment. Conclusions The present experiment reinforces the idea that the answer to the question “How important is historical contingency in evolution?” strongly depends on the level of integration of the traits studied. A strong historical contingency was found for TEV genotype, whereas a weak effect of on phenotypic evolution was revealed. In an applied context, our results imply that viruses are not easily trapped into suboptimal phenotypes and that (re) emergence is not evolutionarily constrained. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{gibberellin}} at multiplication stage on somatic embryo growth and maturation and plantlet regeneration of tangerine (Citrus reticulata Blanco.) var. Batu 55 was assessed. Somatic embryo at globular phase was cultured on MT media + 30 gL- 1 sucrose and various concentrations of gibberellin (0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 ppm). The somatic embryo was maturated on MT media + 500 ppm malt extract + 73 mM sorbitol + 73 mM galactose. Cotyledonary somatic embryo was regenerated into plantlet on MT media + 500 ppm malt extract + 30 gL- 1 sucrose + 2 ppm GA 3. The {{results showed that}} the addition of gibberellin in somatic <b>embryo</b> <b>multiplication</b> stage increased somatic embryo growth and maturation and plantlet regeneration of tangerine.

Initially the explants were surface sterilized appropriately with 0. 1 % mercuric chloride for one minute, 70 % ethanol for 30 seconds and 3 % hydrogen peroxide for one minute. Then the explants {{were treated with}} three different antioxidants for reduction of phenol browning of the explants. Among the antioxidants, 10 mg/L ascorbic acid {{was found to be}} the best. Among the five different tissue culture media - B 5, WPM, MS, SH and Y 3 - tested, MS medium was chosen to be the best for meristem culture. Among the growth regulators, cytokinins (benzyl adinine, kinetin and zeatin) used alone and in combination with auxins (naphthalene acetic acid, indole acetic acid, indole butyric acid), the shoot growth was better observed after 20 days when MS medium was incorporated with 3. 0 mg/L of benzyl adinine and 3. 0 mg/L of kinetin with coconut milk.

40|$|Rapid and genotype-independent {{protocols}} for two direct {{in vitro}} morphogenesis pathways including direct shoot organogenesis from embryo and direct shoot proliferation from node {{have been developed}} in cumin (Cuminum cyminum L.). Direct regenerations occurring without passing callus phase are important since fewer somaclonal variation and genotype-dependency are likely to arise from these methods in comparison with regenerations trough callus. After embryo culture, shoots with single-cellular origin were regenerated from the meristematic zone of embryo without any intermediate callus phase. In contrast, proliferated shoots with multi-cellular origin were directly regenerated from the axillary buds (meristems) of node explants. Effects of different concentrations of 6 -Benzylaminopurine (BAP), α-Naphthaleneacetic Acid (NAA) and Indole- 3 -kcetic Acid (IAA) on B 5 medium of embryo and node cultures as well as subculture were studied in detail. In direct organogenesis pathway from embryo explant, 0. 1 mg L - 1 NAA + 1 mg L - 1 IAA resulted the highest shoot regeneration response (89. 5 shoots per regenerated explant), whereas 0. 1 mg L - 1 BAP + 1 mg L - 1 NAA was the most effective combination in direct shoot proliferation from node explant (42 shoots per regenerated explant). BAP (cytokinin) revealed the inhibitory effect on induction of direct shoot organogenesis pathway from embryo explant, while low concentration of BAP (0. 1 mg L - 1) had positive effect on direct shoot proliferation pathway from node explant. Subculturing was not necessary for shoot <b>multiplication</b> <b>and</b> elongation in <b>embryo</b> culture, whereas <b>multiplication</b> <b>and</b> elongation of shoots in node culture were associated to subculture on growth regulator-free medium. In other part of study, the behavior of different cumin genotypes in direct regeneration pathways was studied. Both direct organogenesis and direct proliferation pathways were applicable to different cumin genotypes and regenerated plants were phenotypically normal. This study supports the feasibility of combined direct regenerations protocols from embryo and node of cumin in germplasm conservation by in vitro cloning and genetic improvement programs...|$|R

Proficiency in mathematics across the United States {{has become an}} area of concern as performance on state accountability tests continues to demonstrate that less than 50 % of students in 4 th and 8 th grade are proficient in mathematics (NCES, 2013). With such large numbers of students lacking proficiency in mathematics, systematic interventions that target many {{students need to be}} utilized to intervene when large numbers of students are demonstrating limited proficiency. The current study implemented a classwide intervention with 133 third- and fourth-grade students to increase proficiency in multiplication. Students were randomly assigned to the cognitive strategy (CSI), timed drill (TD), or a control condition. The intervention occurred for 15 school day sessions for 30 minutes. Results indicated that students in the timed drill (TD) condition improved on measures of basic <b>multiplication</b> <b>and</b> near <b>transfer</b> measures of division fluency, and students in the CSI condition improved on a measure of multiplication word problem solving. Findings from this study indicate that classwide dyad interventions can be used to help classrooms with large numbers of students struggling with basic multiplication. Future {{research is needed to determine}} what interventions should continue for those students not making adequate progress in tier 1 interventions, but given the promising data found here and the pressing need for increased student mathematics proficiency, additional research seems warranted. Implications for research and practice, limitations, and future directions are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Two pruning {{algorithms}} for the Vector-Radix Fast Cosine Transform are presented. Both {{are based}} on an in-place approach of the direct two-dimensional fast cosine transform (2 D FCT). The first pruning algorithm concerns the computation of N 0 xN 0 out of NxN DCT points, where both N 0 and N are powers of 2. The second pruning algorithm is more general and concerns a recursive approach for the computation of any number of points of arbitrary shaped regions. A comparison with the row-column pruning method reveals that the proposed algorithms are more efficient in terms of total computational complexity, i. e. <b>multiplications,</b> additions <b>and</b> data <b>transfers.</b> 1.
