5|$|Exercise {{appears to}} be useful for {{preventing}} low back pain. Exercise is also probably effective in preventing recurrences in those with pain that has lasted more than six weeks. Medium-firm mattresses are more beneficial for chronic pain than firm mattresses. There is little to no evidence that back belts are any more helpful in preventing low back pain than education about proper lifting techniques. Shoe <b>insoles</b> do not help prevent low back pain.|$|E
5|$|Exercise {{therapy is}} {{effective}} in decreasing pain and improving function for those with chronic low back pain. It also appears to reduce recurrence rates {{for as long as}} six months after the completion of program and improves long-term function. There is no evidence that one particular type of exercise therapy is more effective than another. The Alexander technique appears useful for chronic back pain, and there is tentative evidence to support the use of yoga. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) has not been found to be effective in chronic low back pain. Evidence for the use of shoe <b>insoles</b> as a treatment is inconclusive. Peripheral nerve stimulation, a minimally-invasive procedure, may be useful in cases of chronic low back pain that do not respond to other measures, although the evidence supporting it is not conclusive, and it is not effective for pain that radiates into the leg.|$|E

40|$|SummaryObjectiveTo {{compare the}} {{influence}} of concomitant heeled footwear when wearing a lateral wedged <b>insole</b> for medial compartment of osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee, between everyday walking shoes for outdoor use and socks or flat footwear without a heel for indoor use. DesignA total of 227 outpatients were prospectively randomized and treated with a neutral wedged <b>insole</b> inserted into shoes (placebo with shoes; n= 45), a wedged <b>insole</b> inserted into shoes (inserted <b>insole</b> with shoes; n= 45), a sock-type ankle supporter with a wedged <b>insole</b> when wearing socks or flat footwear (inserted <b>insole</b> without shoes; n= 46), a subtalar strapped <b>insole</b> when wearing shoes (strapped <b>insole</b> with shoes; n= 45), and the strapped <b>insole</b> with socks or flat footwear (strapped <b>insole</b> without shoes; n= 46). The Lequesne index of knee OA at week 12 was compared with the baseline in each treatment group. ResultsTwenty patients withdrew from the study, and the 207 patients who completed the 12 -week study were evaluated. At the final assessment, participants wearing the inserted <b>insole</b> without shoes (P= 0. 003), the strapped <b>insole</b> with shoes (P< 0. 0001), and the strapped <b>insole</b> without shoes (P< 0. 0001) demonstrated significantly improved Lequesne index scores in comparison with their baseline assessments. No {{significant differences were found}} in the placebo (P= 0. 16) or the inserted <b>insole</b> with shoes (P= 0. 2) groups. ConclusionConcomitant heeled footwear may decrease the efficacy of an inserted lateral wedged <b>insole.</b> The optimal usage of a lateral wedged <b>insole</b> for knee OA would be the combination with socks or flat footwear without heels...|$|R

Among people with hip and knee osteoarthritis, exercise in water may reduce pain and disability, and increase quality of life in the short term. Also therapeutic exercise programs such as aerobics and walking reduce pain and improve physical functioning for up to 6 months after the end of the program for people with knee osteoarthritis.|$|E

40|$|The {{somatosensory}} system {{plays an important}} role in balance control and age-related declines in somatosensory function have been implicated in falls incidence. Different types of <b>insole</b> devices have been developed to enhance somatosensory information and improve postural stability. However, they are often too complex and expensive to integrate into daily life and textured <b>insole</b> surfaces may provide an inexpensive and accessible means to enhance somatosensory input. This study investigated the effects of textured <b>insole</b> surfaces on postural sway in ten younger and seven older participants performing standing balance tests on a force plate under three <b>insole</b> surface conditions: (1) barefoot; (2) with hard; and (3), soft textured <b>insole</b> surfaces. With each <b>insole</b> surface, participants were tested under two vision conditions (eyes open, closed) on two standing surfaces (firm, foam). Four 30 s trials were collected for different combinations of <b>insole</b> surface, standing surface and vision. Centre of pressure measurements included the range and standard deviation of anterior-posterior and medial-lateral displacement, path length and the 90 % confidence elliptical area. Results revealed a significant Group*Surface*Insole interaction for five of the dependent variables. Compared to younger individuals, postural sway was greater in older people on both standing surfaces in the barefoot condition. However, both textured <b>insole</b> surfaces reduced postural sway for the older group especially in the eyes closed condition on a foam surface. These findings suggest that textured <b>insole</b> surfaces can reduce postural sway in older people, particularly during more challenging balance tasks. Textured <b>insole</b> surfaces may afford a low-cost means of decreasing postural sway, providing an important intervention in falls prevention...|$|R
40|$|This {{project is}} to design and {{fabricate}} of an orthotic <b>insole</b> by using Kinect® XBOX 360 gaming sensor scanner and 3 D printer. In order to fulfill medical requirement, it was invented to help medical field to overcome their problem of high 3 D scanner cost, handcrafted fabrication, inventory problem, and long fabrication time. In term of process, author had proven the potential of Kinect® XBOX 360 gaming sensor as a 3 D scanner, CAD as the method of the orthotic <b>insole</b> design, and Additive Manufacturing as the fabrication technique. In literature review, author had made deeply research in conventional orthotic <b>insole</b> fabrication which begins with plaster casting of the patient’s foot, followed by handcrafted orthotic <b>insole</b> design until the fabrication process. Author also had made visitation to Rehabilitation Hospital Cheras for data procurement regarding orthotic <b>insole</b> design and fabrication processes. In analytical phase, author had done calculation for the accuracy of the Kinect® XBOX 360 gaming sensor and the results shows Kinect® XBOX 360 device is capable of producing 3 D reconstructed geometry with the maximum and minimum error of 3. 78 % (2. 78 mm) and 1. 74 % (0. 46 mm) respectively. Besides, the higher the scanned model dimension, the less error can be achieved based on the complexity of the scanned model. The orthotic <b>insole</b> design process had been done by using Autodesk Meshmixer 2. 6 and Solidworks 2014 software with Rehabilitation Hospital Cheras as the main reference in design process. Fabrication of the orthotic <b>insole</b> had been made by using Flashforge 3 D printer and Filaflex (TPE) filament as the material of the orthotic <b>insole.</b> For validation of the fabricated orthotic <b>insole,</b> author had conducted form, fit, and function test. As the result, the fabricated <b>insole</b> design produced 0. 29 mm RMS error compared to designed dimension. Functionality of the orthotic <b>insole</b> had been justified by conducting the foot pressure scan and the results had proven the fabricated <b>insole</b> is capable of reducing the pressure especially in metatarsal area.

The patients randomized into either treated with exercise and analgesic plus 6 mm wedge <b>insole</b> (19 patients) or only with analgesics and exercise (18 patients). Pain while walking, standing and at rest was recorded on a 100 mm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), pain with passive motion was evaluated by Doyle’s Ritchie Index, and functional status was evaluated by the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) at baseline, 1 st month and 3 rd month visits. Results: At the 3 rd month visit, the ratio of patients with improvement according to the Ritchie Index score was higher in the group using 6 mm wedge <b>insole</b> compared to group using no <b>insole</b> (p= 0. 008). The patients using 6 mm wedge <b>insole</b> had significant improvement in WOMAC pain subscale (p= 0. 003) and total WOMAC (p= 0. 01) scores at the 1 st month visit and VAS at rest (p= 0. 03), standing (p= 0. 02), walking (p= 0. 01), total WOMAC (p= 0. 001), and all subscales of WOMAC (except WOMAC stiffness score) at the 3 rd month visit compared to group using no <b>insole.</b> Conclusion: 6 mm lateral wedge <b>insole</b> significantly reduces pain while walking, standing, at rest and with passive movement of the knee in patients with grade II and III knee osteoarthritis.
