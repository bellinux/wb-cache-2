2500|$|The Indian Legion was {{organised}} as {{a standard}} German army infantry regiment of three battalions of four companies each, at least initially with <b>exclusively</b> <b>German</b> commissioned officers.

[...] There are 5 people who speak Italian. [...] Until the 15th century, the local language was almost <b>exclusively</b> <b>German.</b> The French-speaking community slowly grew until in the 18th and 19th centuries, the village was bilingual.

2500|$|At {{the same}} time, naval {{innovations}} {{led to a}} German domination of trade in the Baltic Sea and parts of Eastern Europe through the Hanseatic League. Along the trade routes, Hanseatic trade stations became centers of the German culture. German town law (Stadtrecht) was promoted {{by the presence of}} large, relatively wealthy German populations, their influence and political power. Thus people who would be considered [...] "Germans", with a common culture, language, and worldview {{different from that of the}} surrounding rural peoples, colonized trading towns as far north of present-day Germany as Bergen (in Norway), Stockholm (in Sweden), and Vyborg (now in Russia). The Hanseatic League was not <b>exclusively</b> <b>German</b> in any ethnic sense: many towns who joined the league were outside the Holy Roman Empire and a number of them may only loosely be characterized as German. The Empire itself was not entirely German either. It had a multi-ethnic and multi-lingual structure, some of the smaller ethnicities and languages used at different times were Dutch, Italian, French, Czech and Polish.|$|E
60|$|It {{was then}} {{the height of the}} London concert season. Morning {{performances}} of music were announced in rows. Reading the advertised programmes, Carmina found them, in one remarkable respect, all alike. They would have led an ignorant stranger to wonder whether any such persons as Italian composers, French composers, and English composers had ever existed. The music offered to the English public was music of <b>exclusively</b> <b>German</b> (and for the most part modern German) origin. Carmina held the opinion--in common with Mozart and Rossini, as well as other people--that music without melody is not music at all. She laid aside the newspaper.|$|E
6000|$|Another {{point is}} humanly {{interesting}} in this Congress; but cannot fully be investigated {{for want of}} dates. Always, we perceive, according to the news of it that reach Berlin,--of England going right for the Kaiser or going wrong for him,--his Prussian Majesty's treatment of his children varies. If England go right for the Kaiser, well, and his Majesty is in good-humor with Queen, with Crown-Prince and Wilhelmina. If England go wrong for the Kaiser, dark clouds gather on the royal brow, in the royal heart; explode in thunder-storms; and at length crockery goes flying through the rooms, blows descend on the poor Prince's back; and her Majesty is in tears, mere Chaos come again. For as a general rule, unless the English Negotiation have some prospering fit, and produce exceptional phenomena, Friedrich Wilhelm, ever loyal in heart, stands steadfast by his Kaiser; ever ready [...] "to strike out (LOS ZU SCHLAGEN," [...] as he calls it) with his best strength in behalf of a cause which, good soul, he thinks is essentially German;--all the readier if at any time it seem now <b>exclusively</b> <b>German,</b> the French, Spanish, English, and other unlovely Foreign world being clean cut loose from it, or even standing ranked against it. [...] "When will it go off, then (WANN GEHT ES LOS)?" [...] asks Friedrich Wilhelm often; diligently drilling his sixty thousand, and snorting contempt on [...] "Ungermanism (UNDEUTSCHHEIT)," [...] be it {{on the part of}} friends or of enemies. Good soul, and whether he will ever get Julich and Berg out of it, is distractingly problematical, and the Tobacco-Parliament is busy with him! ...|$|E

Estimates for the plans, which were named Nordstern, were for a population of 250,000 of <b>exclusively</b> <b>Germans.</b> However, all that was ever realized at Øysand was the airfield and a small army base, as well as a series of prison camps.|$|R

5000|$|The British {{historian}} Ian Kershaw {{has argued}} that Nolte was operating on the borderlines of Holocaust denial with his implied claim that the [...] "negative myth" [...] of the Third Reich was created by Jewish historians, his allegations of the domination of Holocaust scholarship by [...] "biased" [...] Jewish historians, and his statements that one should withhold judgment on Holocaust deniers, whom Nolte takes considerable pains to stress are not <b>exclusively</b> <b>Germans</b> or fascists. In Kershaw's opinion, Nolte is attempting to imply that perhaps Holocaust deniers are on to something.|$|R

50|$|This {{area was}} {{developed}} between 1850 and 1900 by immigrants who were almost <b>exclusively</b> <b>German.</b> As a result, {{the area was}} called Dutchtown, a mispronunciation of Deutschtown.

These buildings were very solidly built.|$|E
