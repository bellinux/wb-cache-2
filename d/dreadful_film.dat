Unlike... {{everything else in the}} movie, the boys somehow manage to at least come off as likeable." [...] His review concluded [...] "I'll grudgingly admit, while it is an absolutely <b>dreadful</b> <b>film</b> by nearly every objective measure, Nukie probably isn't the worst E.T. knockoff ever made. However, it is definitely the worst one you can watch with your lights on, the volume up, and your door unlocked," [...] possibly in reference to the myriad adult parodies of the aforementioned film.|$|E
5000|$|The piece {{has been}} filmed twice. The first, in 1933, {{directed}} by Herbert Wilcox was filmed in black-and-white, with Anna Neagle and Fernand Gravet in the leading roles. A version for MGM in 1940, directed by W S Van Dyke was in colour and starred Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy. In both cases, {{the score was}} heavily cut. Coward disliked the much-rewritten 1940 film and vowed that no more of his plays would be filmed in Hollywood. In 1951 he told The Daily Express, [...] "I was saving up Bitter Sweet as an investment for my old age. After MGM's <b>dreadful</b> <b>film</b> I can never revive it." ...|$|E

5000|$|On 20 June 2010 he {{appeared}} on the BBC Radio 4 programme Desert Island Discs. In it he said of The Adventurers, that the film was a disaster, {{and that he should}} never have made it. On working with Orson Welles on Ferry to Hong Kong, he said that it was: [...] "dreadful, it was my nightmare film. It was a <b>dreadful</b> <b>film,</b> and everything was wrong with it; principally him Welles." [...] He also said that his biggest mistake was failing to direct the film version of the musical Oliver!. Its composer Lionel Bart had assured Gilbert that nobody else would do the film, but Gilbert was also contractually committed to Paramount to make a film (that he has since refused to name), which caused him to withdraw from the project.|$|E
5000|$|British Director Lindsay Anderson {{was engaged}} to {{accompany}} Wham! to China and make a documentary film about the visit. The film was shot over two weeks of March and April and edited over late spring and summer 1985 in London. Anderson called his one-hour and 18 minute film If You Were There.In {{the final stages of}} editing, Anderson was dismissed by Wham!'s management, the editing team quit, and the film was entirely re-edited, renamed and released as Foreign Skies: Wham!

5000|$|The film had a {{polarizing}} {{effect on}} critics upon release. The Washington Posts critics were split: Desson Thomson described {{the film as}} an [...] "unabashed vamp {{for a pair of}} household names, and as such it works, often hilariously", while Hal Hinson wrote that [...] "its piddling—a hangdog little comedy with not enough laughs." [...] Roger Ebert wrote for The Chicago Sun Times that [...] "Ishtar is a truly <b>dreadful</b> <b>film,</b> a lifeless, massive, lumbering exercise in failed comedy" [...] and Gene Siskel called it [...] "shockingly dull" [...] and [...] "dim-witted"; together they selected it as the worst film of 1987 on Siskel & Ebert & The Movies. Janet Maslin of The New York Times was more forgiving, writing [...] "The worst of it is painless; the best is funny, sly, cheerful and, here and there, even genuinely inspired" [...] and Vincent Canby—also for the Times—listed it as a runner up to his top films of 1987.|$|E
5000|$|The film {{is based}} on Coward's stage operetta, which was a hit in 1929 in London. It was filmed twice, first in 1933 in {{black-and-white}} (in Britain, with Anna Neagle and Fernand Gravet in the leading roles). The 1940 film is much cut and rewritten, removing much of the operetta's irony. The opening and closing scenes are cut, focusing the film squarely upon the relationship between MacDonald's character, Sarah, and her music teacher, Carl Linden. The opening scene was a flash forward, in which Sarah appears as an elderly woman recalling how she fell in love. One reason for dropping this scene is {{that it had been}} appropriated for MGM's 1937 film Maytime. Coward disliked the 1940 film and vowed that no more of his shows would be filmed in Hollywood. In 1951 he told The Daily Express, [...] "I was saving up Bitter Sweet as an investment for my old age. After MGM's <b>dreadful</b> <b>film</b> I can never revive it" [...] on stage.|$|E
5000|$|Like its predecessor, {{the film}} {{received}} negative reviews, and holds a 20% 'rotten' rating based on 15 reviews {{with an average}} rating of 3.8/10 on review aggregate Rotten Tomatoes. John Anderson of the Los Angeles Times called the film [...] "a self-reverential salute to Ducks" [...] while also saying that the film was [...] "lazier" [...] than its predecessors. Steve Hedgpeth of the Newark Star Ledger wrote, 'Somebody put this stupid Disney franchise in Deep-Freeze'. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times wrote that [...] "D3: The Mighty Ducks is a truly <b>dreadful</b> <b>film,</b> a lifeless, massive, childish exercise in failed comedy". Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune called it [...] "dull, stupid, brainless, and dim-witted". Janet Maslin of The New York Times enjoyed the film, writing [...] "Not {{as great as the}} first two; but it's funny, sly, cheerful and, here and there, even genuinely inspired, which is why I enjoyed it." [...] Vincent Canby—also for the Times—listed it as one of his top films of 1996.|$|E
5000|$|Pope {{formerly}} {{maintained a}} production deal with Lionsgate. [...] In 2012 he commenced production on a neo-noir feature The Canyons (film) written by Bret Easton Ellis, directed by Paul Schrader and starring Lindsay Lohan that was funded {{in part by}} a successful Kickstarter campaign as well as by Pope, Schrader and Ellis individually. [...] The film received media coverage for the innovative way it was financed and produced, utilizing new media techniques including crowdfunding, online casting [...] and social media sites including Twitter and Facebook. [...] The film also received attention for the casting of lead actress Lindsay Lohan who had been acting infrequently in the preceding years as well as former adult performer James Deen in his first mainstream role.
