A numerical shock physics code (CTH) is used to characterize the mass and velocity of munition fragments. Both two- and three-dimensional simulations of the munition have been completed in this study. Based on threshold fragment velocity/mass results drawn from both previous and current analyses, it is determined that under all fragment impact conditions from the munition configurations considered in this study, no perforation of the inner chamber wall will occur, and the integrity of the Burster Detonation Vessel is retained. However, the munition case fragments have sufficient mass and velocity to locally damage the surface of the inner wall of the containment vessel...|$|R

40|$|The article {{contains}} a thermodynamic analysis of a new combustion system that allows the combustion of stratified gas mixtures with mean air excess coefficient in the range 1. 4 - 1. 8. Spark ignition {{was used in the}} pre-chamber that has been mounted in the engine cylinder head and contained a rich mixture out of which a turbulent flow of ignited mixture is ejected. It allows spark-jet ignition and the turbulent combustion of the lean mixture in the main combustion chamber. This resulted in a two-stage combustion system for lean mixtures. The experimental study has been conducted using a single-cylinder test engine with a geometric compression ratio ε = 15. 5 adapted for natural gas supply. The tests were performed at engine speed n = 2000 rpm under stationary engine load when the engine operating parameters and toxic compounds emissions have been recorded. Analysis of the results allowed to conclude that the evaluated combustion system offers large flexibility in the <b>initiation</b> of <b>charge</b> ignition through an appropriate control of the fuel quantities supplied into the pre-chamber and into the main combustion chamber. The research concluded with determining the charge ignition criterion for a suitably divided total fuel dose fed to the cylinder...|$|R

40|$|Corrugated {{stainless}} steel tubing (CSST) {{has been used}} for more than 20 years as a replacement for conventional black iron gas piping. CSST has a thinner tubing wall and is susceptible to damage from lightning activity when discharges enter a structure, potentially resulting in perforation of the CSST wall and fire ignition. Grounding has been promoted by CSST manufacturers as a solution to this problem. We use modeling and simulation of voltage potentials and arc currents to evaluate the effects of grounding on the voltage potential across CSST, which can result in arc <b>initiation,</b> and <b>charge</b> through the arc, which can result in melting and perforation of the CSST wall. Our results show multiple scenarios where a 10 kA 10 × 350 s current waveform with 1 Ω grounding of the CSST still results in voltages greater than the arc initiation threshold of 25 kV and charge through the arc greater than 1. 2 C, the perforation threshold we measured. For the case where lightning enters the structure through an outdoor light fixture or chimney, the presence of a grounding wire increases the charge through the arc from 0. 13 C to 2. 22 C. These results indicate that good grounding of CSST will not necessarily prevent arc initiation nor perforation of the CSST wall by lightning. Good grounding may in fact exacerbate the problem of lightning damage to CSST depending on where lightning enters the building and the electrical parameters of the path to ground...|$|R
40|$|The final HE {{test for}} the fiscal year was {{conducted}} in the 4 -foot detonation sphere in May. A 200 g charge of 2 - 4 - 6 trinitrotoluene (1 1 / 2 -inch diameter x 4 1 / 2 -inch long) was initiated. On <b>initiation,</b> the TNT <b>charge</b> failed to detonate but instead partial deflagration of the HE took place. The ensuing pressure rise (54 torr vs. {approximately} 120 torr expected) implied a partial detonation; nevertheless, sampling and evaluation at the detonation products was continued. After removal of the products, the sphere was opened for inspection. The interior of the sphere was covered with a heavy carbon deposit adhering to a viscous film. Closer observation revealed granules of TNT embedded in the residual layer and also smeared on the surfaces of the involved hardware. Scrubbing with soap and water had no effect on the film; consequently, all the contamination was removed with acetone. Of the related hardware, only the copper cylinder suffered any damage.

The {{total cost of}} credit (for either short-term or unsecured loans) is applied here to a number of loan amounts and loan periods. The total monthly cost of credit is indicated in rands; this rand amount is indicated as a monthly percentage of the initial loan. This monthly percentage gives the most accurate possible indication of the total cost of credit in each case. The annual cost may be obtained by multiplying these figures by twelve. It is assumed for the purposes of these calculations that the maximum rates of interest and fees are charged, for the reasons explained above. It is also assumed that the total <b>initiation</b> fee is <b>charged</b> to the borrower and capitalised: that is to say, is paid off over the same period as the loan, at the same interest rate (five per cent per month if it is a short-term loan, or 3.3 per cent per month if it is an unsecured loan). If the initiation fee were regarded as a separate loan, it would attract its own initiation and service fees, which would make the initiation fee even more expensive. For the sake of simplicity, interest is not charged on unpaid interest and other fees (although this is permitted by the Act), which would make the total cost of credit even more expensive.|$|R
40|$|AbstractRocket {{propelled}} grenade (RPG) shaped charge attack {{threats are}} of particular concern for Insensitive Munitions (IM) development. In response to these threats, the U. S. Project Engineering Office for Ammunition (PEO Ammo) worked with ARDEC to develop a highly reproducible and well characterized standardized 81 mm shaped <b>charge</b> jet <b>initiation</b> test configuration. This test {{was adopted by the}} U. S. DoD for RPG threat testing as specified in MIL-STD- 2105 D and is completed as per STANAG 4526. Recent U. S. Insensitive Munitions shaped <b>charge</b> <b>initiation</b> attention has been focused on realistic smaller shaped charge threats. STANAG 4526 discusses standardized threats related to “Top Attack Bomblets” and SCJ with “Characteristics of 50 mm Rockeye”. As a representative shaped charge for smaller size threats than the RPG, the 50 mm Rockeye munition has been commonly recommended for testing. However, recent testing of the 50 mm Rockeye munitions has shown a large undesirable variability of jet tip characteristics. This large variability in jet tip characteristics would be consistent with a large variability in munitions response to the 50 mm Rockeye jet attack. Additionally, it has become clear that this shaped charge does not represent a commonly observed threat. For this reason, an effort is currently underway to identify a dominant smaller shaped charge threat and to develop a surrogate small shaped charge threat test configuration that provides very reproducible jet characteristics. The result to date is that 40 mm grenades have been identified as a dominant smaller shaped charge threat and a surrogate consistent in approach with previous efforts has been designed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background There {{is little}} {{data on the}} impact of office-based {{buprenorphine}} therapy on criminal activity. The goal {{of this study was to}} determine the impact of primary care clinic-based buprenorphine maintenance therapy on rates of criminal charges and the factors associated with criminal charges in the 2 years after initiation of treatment. Methods We collected demographic and outcome data on 252 patients who were given at least one prescription for buprenorphine. We searched a public database of criminal charges and recorded criminal charges prior to and after enrollment. We compared the total number of criminal cases and drug cases 2 years before versus 2 years after initiation of treatment. Results There was at least one criminal charge made against 38 % of the subjects in the 2 years after initiation of treatment; these subjects were more likely to have used heroin, to have injected drugs, to have had any prior criminal charges, and recent criminal charges. There was no significant difference in the number of subjects with any criminal charge or a drug charge before and after initiation of treatment. Likewise, the mean number of all cases and drug cases was not significantly different between the two periods. However, among those who were opioid-negative for 6 or more months in the first year of treatment, there was a significant decline in criminal cases. On multivariable analysis, having recent criminal charges was significantly associated with criminal <b>charges</b> after <b>initiation</b> of treatment (adjusted odds ratio 3. 92); subjects who were on opioid maintenance treatment prior to enrollment were significantly less likely to have subsequent criminal charges (adjusted odds ratio 0. 52). Conclusions Among subjects with prior criminal <b>charges,</b> <b>initiation</b> of office-based buprenorphine treatment did not appear to have a significant impact on subsequent criminal charges. </p...|$|R
40|$|This Master’s Thesis {{concerns}} the technical problems and solutions in the Telia Mobile 9 ̆ 2 s Golden Gate Architecture. The Golden Gate project will bridge service control from the IPnetwork to the circuit switched network. Connecting the different users of PSTN, GSM, W-LAN, and GPRS networks together will require solutions to many problems. Most {{of the problems}} have already been defined by Telia. Our task is to evaluate {{two parts of the}} Golden Gate architecture, namely the Interconnect- and Service Provider roles. The Interconnector provider connects networks of different technical standards and enables other network operators to reach Service Providers on the Internet or other IP-based networks. The role concerns mainly mapping between SS 7 signaling and the Session <b>Initiation</b> Protocol (SIP), <b>charging</b> and billing. Via the Interconnector the Service Provider can connect different services to any network. We will describe the SIP-protocol in detail and then we will look into the mapping between SS 7 and SIP. We will also propose a charging model. It is important to have a solution that supports roaming between the different networks, we will evaluate such a solution. Most of the protocols (INAP, ENUM, MAP and ISUP) that are involved in the Golden Gate architecture are not completely defined. There are many Internet Drafts that discuss the possible functionality of the protocols and the interworking between them. Many different Internet-workgroups are working with these issues. No one seems to have the right answers for the interconnection between the protocols involved. Since the IP-telephony will probably replace today’s telephony systems, it is important to ensure a suitable Quality of Service (QoS), security that guarantees privacy, and a fair billing function. These are the three major problems in the IP-telephony world. IP-Telephony or Voice over IP (VoIP) has been on the market for a long time, there are many 'free IP-call sites' that use VoIP, but the quality of the calls are not yet good enough to replace traditional telephony. Our task here {{is to make sure that}} the necessary quality of service is provided, and a reliable charging model is used...|$|R
6000|$|She {{had gone}} out with these last words so in her ears that when once she was well away--back {{this time in the}} great square alone--it was as if some instant {{application}} of them had opened out there before her. It was positively, this effect, an excitement that carried her on; she went forward into space under the sense of an impulse received--an impulse simple and direct, easy above all to act upon. She was borne up for the hour, and now she knew why she had wanted to come by herself. No one in the world could have sufficiently entered into her state; no tie would have been close enough to enable a companion to walk beside her without some disparity. She literally felt, in this first flush, that her only company must be the human race at large, present all round her, but inspiringly impersonal, and that her only field must be, then and there, the grey immensity of London. Grey immensity had somehow of a sudden become her element; grey immensity was what her distinguished friend had, for the moment, furnished her world with and what the question of [...] "living," [...] as he put it to her, living by option, by volition, inevitably took on for its immediate face. She went straight before her, without weakness, altogether with strength; and still as she went she was more glad to be alone, for nobody--not Kate Croy, not Susan Shepherd either--would have wished to rush with her as she rushed. She had asked him at the last whether, being on foot, she might go home so, or elsewhere, and he had replied as if almost amused again at her extravagance: [...] "You're active, luckily, by nature--it's beautiful: therefore rejoice in it. Be active, without folly--for you're not foolish: be as active as you can and as you like." [...] That had been in fact the final push, as well as the touch that most made a mixture of her consciousness--a strange mixture that tasted at one and the same time of what she had lost and what had been given her. It was wonderful to her, while she took her random course, that these quantities felt so equal: she had been treated--hadn't she?--as if it were in her power to live; and yet one wasn't treated so--was one?--unless it came up, quite as much, that one might die. The beauty of the bloom had gone from the small old sense of safety--that was distinct: she had left it behind her there forever. But the beauty of the idea of a great adventure, a big dim experiment or struggle in which she might, more responsibly than ever before, take a hand, had been offered her instead. It was as if she had had to pluck off her breast, to throw away, some friendly ornament, a familiar flower, a little old jewel, that was part of her daily dress; and to take up and shoulder as a substitute some queer defensive weapon, a musket, a spear, a battle-axe conducive possibly in a higher degree to a striking appearance, but demanding all the effort of the military posture. She felt this instrument, for that matter, already on her back, so that she proceeded now in very truth as a soldier on a march--proceeded as if, for her <b>initiation,</b> the first <b>charge</b> had been sounded. She passed along unknown streets, over dusty littery ways, between long rows of fronts not enhanced by the August light; she felt good for miles and only wanted to get lost; there were moments at corners, where she stopped and chose her direction, in which she quite lived up to his injunction to rejoice that she was active. It was like a new pleasure to have so new a reason; she would affirm, without delay, her option, her volition; taking this personal possession of what surrounded her was a fair affirmation to start with; and she really didn't care if she made it at the cost of alarms for Susie. Susie would wonder in due course [...] "whatever," [...] as they said at the hotel, had become of her; yet this would be nothing either, probably, to wonderments still in store. Wonderments in truth, Milly felt, even now attended her steps: it was quite as if she saw in people's eyes the reflection of her appearance and pace. She found herself moving at times in regions visibly not haunted by odd-looking girls from New York, duskily draped, sable-plumed, all but incongruously shod and gazing about them with extravagance; she might, from the curiosity she clearly excited in byways, in side-streets peopled with grimy children and costermongers carts, which she hoped were slums, literally have had her musket on her shoulder, have announced herself as freshly on the warpath. But for the fear of overdoing this character she would here and there have begun conversation, have asked her way; {{in spite of the fact}} that, as that would help the requirements of adventure, her way was exactly what she wanted not to know. The difficulty was that she at last accidentally found it; she had come out, she presently saw, at the Regent's Park, round which, on two or three occasions with Kate Croy, her public chariot had solemnly rolled. But she went into it further now; this was the real thing; the real thing was to be quite away from the pompous roads, well within the centre and on the stretches of shabby grass. Here were benches and smutty sheep; here were idle lads at games of ball, with their cries mild in the thick air; here were wanderers, anxious and tired like herself; here doubtless were hundreds of others just in the same box. Their box, their great common anxiety, what was it, in this grim breathing-space, but the practical question of life? They could live if they would; that is, like herself, they had been told so; she saw them all about her, on seats, digesting the information, feeling it altered, assimilated, recognising it again as something, in a slightly different shape, familiar enough, the blessed old truth that they would live if they could. All she thus shared with them made her wish to sit in their company; which she so far did that she looked for a bench that was empty, eschewing a still emptier chair that she saw hard by and for which she would have paid, with superiority, a fee.|$|R
