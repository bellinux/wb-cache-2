40|$|Background: in {{clinical}} practice, <b>dimethylaminoethanol</b> (DMAE) {{has been used}} in the fight against wrinkles and flaccidity in the cervicofacial region. the firming action of DMAE is {{explained by the fact that}} its molecule, considered to be a precursor of acetylcholine, alters muscle contraction. However, no experimental studies have confirmed this theory. Because the actual mechanism of DMAE action was not defined and there were no references in the literature regarding its direct action on fibroblasts, this study was performed to evaluate the direct action of DMAE on cultured human fibroblasts. Methods: Human fibroblasts obtained from discarded fragments of total skin from patients undergoing plastic or reconstructive surgical procedures performed within the Plastic Surgery Division at the Federal University of S (a) over tildeo Paulo were used for this study. the explant technique was used. the culture medium was supplemented with different concentrations of DMAE on the fourth cell passage, and the cell proliferation rate, cytosolic calcium levels, and cell cycle were evaluated. Statistical analysis was performed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by a New-man-Keuls test for multiple comparisons. Results: A decrease in fibroblast proliferation was associated with an increase in DMAE concentration. A longer treatment time with trypsin was required for the groups treated with DMAE in a dose-dependent manner. in the presence of DMAE, cytosolic calcium increased in a dose-dependent manner. Apoptosis also increased in groups treated with DMAE. Conclusion: <b>Dimethylaminoethanol</b> reduced the proliferation of fibroblasts, increased cytosolic calcium, and changed the cell cycle, causing an increase in apoptosis in cultured human fibroblasts.

40|$|SUMMARY A {{double-blind}} crossover {{trial with}} 2 -dimethylaminoethanol (Deanol), a possible precursor of brain acetylcholine, {{was carried out}} in nine patients with Huntington's chorea. It was found to be ineffective in inducing any alteration in hyperkinesia. The pharmacological treatment of Huntington's chorea has been based on the use of neuroleptic drugs, on the hypothesis that there is a functional dopaminergic hyperactivity in this illness (Agid, 1975). More recently, after the observation of reduced cholinergic and GABAminergic activity at the striatal level in brains of choreic subjects (McGeer et al., 1973; Stahl and Swanson, 1974; Bird and Iversen, 1974), therapeutic trials were carried out with substances which facilitate the formation and persistence of these supposed neurotransmitters. The hypothesis of reduced cholinergic activity at the striatal level is supported by the therapeutic effectiveness of physostigmine, a powerful anti-cholinesterase drug which also passes the blood-brain barrier (Aquilonius and Sjostrom, 1971; Klawans and Rubovitz, 1972; Davis et al., 1976). Nevertheless, this drug cannot be used clinically because of serious and numerous side effects. Since then, there have been attempts to influence cholinergic metabolism by providing substances considered to be acetylcholine precursors. <b>Dimethylaminoethanol</b> acid (Deanol), a drug which has been proved to enhance the formation of acetylcholine in the CNS, has been shown to have effects on the CNS in animals (Pfeiffer et al., 1957; Haubrich et al., 1975), and in various pathological conditions in humans, such as schizophrenia, periodic headache, chronic states of fatigue, and bronchial asthma (Pfeiffer, 1958; Murphree et al., 1960).

Similarly, when slices were exposed to the choline analogue <b>dimethylaminoethanol</b> within the first 10 hours, the phospholipid composition of the membrane lipids was drastically altered, the wound-induced respiration in a 24 -hr period was substantially curtailed, and the development of cyanide insensitivity was sharply inhibited.

The quality control for the tracer, however, seems still to be challenging. [11 C]Choline is commonly synthesized by passing [11 C]methyl iodide through a SPE cartridge wetted with 2 - <b>dimethylaminoethanol</b> (DMEA), washing the cartridge with ethanol, water and eluting the product with saline. Thus the aim for chromatography is to separate sodium chloride, residual DMEA and [11 C]choline for the reliable quantification DMEA, as it competes with [11 C]choline in vivo. To achieve this, several chromatographic methods have been reported, e. g. RP with ion-pair elution and IC in different combinations with RI, conductivity or amperometric detection. The major difficulties listed were insufficient resolution and low detection sensitivity, which at times required two chromatographic runs to accomplish the task [1 - 4]. We investigated the capability of mixed-mode chromatography in resolving these issues...|$|E
40|$|Paper {{presented}} to the 6 th Annual Symposium on Graduate Research and Scholarly Projects (GRASP) held at the Hughes Metropolitan Complex, Wichita State University, April 23, 2010. Research completed at the Department of Chemistry, College of Liberal Arts and SciencesOver the past decade, photodynamic therapy (PDT) has begun to gain worldwide attention either as a primary or as an alternate treatment for solid cancers. 1 The success of the treatment largely depends upon the tumor-selectivity and photosensitizing properties of the photosensitizer used. Phthalocyanines with absorption extending well into the near-IR region have been considered to be potential PDT agents. In the present study, the synthesis of asymmetrically substituted phthalocyanine has been described. In {{order to avoid the}} tedious separation of a mixture of phthalocyanines prepared by statistical method, Kobayashi’s ring expansion of boron subphthalocyanine route 2 has been used. This route produces exclusively 3 : 1 asymmetrical phthalocyanine. Fluorinated boron subphthalocyanine and diiminoisoindoline of glycol chain substituted phthalonitrile were used as reagents. Mild reaction conditions were employed using <b>dimethylaminoethanol</b> as the solvent.

The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effects of DMAE-based formulations on hairless mice and human skin. Formulations containing with or without DMAE were applied to the dorsum of hairless mice. Histopathological and histometric evaluations were carried out after seven days. Formulations were also applied to the ventral forearm and the lateral periocular area of human volunteers. Stratum corneum water content and skin mechanical properties were analyzed using Corneometer and Cutometer, before and after a single and repeated application. Histometric evaluations showed that formulations with or without DMAE increased the viable epidermis thickness, but only the DMAE-supplemented formulation led to increased dermal thickness. DMAE also induced increase in collagen fiber thickness, which was observed in the histopathological study. After the single and the 8 -week period application on human skin, formulations with and without DMAE enhanced the stratum corneum water content in the forearm skin. Mechanical properties were not significantly modified. So, we can suggest that DMAE action is related to its effects on the dermis as observed in the histopathological and histometric studies and showed hydration effects on skin.

40|$|Embryonic {{development}} in the sea urchin requires trophic actions of the same neurotransmitters that participate in mammalian brain assembly.

A variety of developmental neurotoxicants affect this transporter in mammalian brain. [3 H]Hemicholinium- 3 binding to the transporter was found in the cell membrane fraction at stages from the unfertilized egg to pluteus, with a binding affinity comparable with that seen in mammalian brain. Over the course of development, the concentration of transporter sites rose more than 3 -fold, achieving concentrations comparable with those of cholinergically enriched mammalian brain regions. <b>Dimethylaminoethanol</b> (DMAE), a competitive inhibitor of choline transport, elicited dysmorphology beginning at the mid-blastula stage, with anomalies beginning progressively later as the concentration of DMAE was lowered. Pretreatment, cotreatment, or delayed treatment with acetylcholine or choline prevented the adverse effects of DMAE. Because acetylcholine was protective at a lower threshold, the DMAE-induced defects were most likely mediated by its effects on acetylcholine synthesis. Transient removal of the hyaline layer enabled a charged transport inhibitor, hemicholinium- 3, to penetrate sufficiently to elicit similar anomalies, which were again prevented by acetylcholine or choline. These results indicate that the developing sea urchin possesses a high-affinity choline transporter analogous to that found in the mammalian brain, and, as in mammals, the functioning of this transporter {{plays a key role in}} the developmental, trophic activity of acetylcholine.

On the ground, there is limited possibility of prosecutions because most of the NPS are not scheduled in France at this time. However, because of the problems posed, police officers attempt to make it part of their jurisdiction and seize the substances. We have monitored the recent NPS seizures to characterise their use in France and to participate in raising the awareness of the increase in seizures of these substances in France which may have an impact on other areas of Europe. All seizures were analysed according to standard analytical strategy defined in our quality plan. The analysis consisted of screening by ion mobility spectrometry (Ionscan™ 400 B, Smiths Detection) and by gas-chromatography/mass-spectrometry (MSD 5975 GC/MSD, Agilent Technologies) after dilution or decoction in an organic solvent: (i) methanol or (ii) acetonitrile or after (iii) derivatisation by Sil-Prep™. Observed mass spectra were compared to the spectral libraries from the ENFSI-DWG and the SWGDRUG. All results relating to NPS were evaluated and substances and their origins were classified. Between 2013 and 2014, 56 seizures of NPS were analysed in our laboratory: 4 seizures in 2013 and 52 seizures in 2014, showing a dramatic increase in the last year. If synthetic cannabinoids (SC) were the main substances identified (15 different compounds), we also found five different phenylethylamines (ethylphenidate, MDAI, DCMP, camfetamine, fencamfamine), two tryptamines (5 -MeO-DALT and αMT), two benzodiazepines (etizolam and diclazepam), a thiophenic analogue of methamphetamine (methiopropamine), a piperazine (mCPP) and <b>dimethylaminoethanol.</b> These seizures came from different areas of France. All results were registered in our national database from which some government bodies are informed. If all of the substances identified in the analysed seizures were already known, the increasing number of cases objectivises a geographical extension and a supply diversification which may be representative in other parts of Europe. France has not been spared from NPS and seems to be catching up, unfortunately. In France, we are observing a new kind of market with legal and illegal aspects and an evolution of use previously described in some countries. For example, suppliers now often sell pure powdered substance; packagings are simpler than the previous coloured bags and they clearly provide the name and formula of the substance(s). As in many other countries, there are too few tools to prevent this expansion, however, the French government has begun to register the NPS.

This rationalizes the drive to develop new tracers {{that are based on}} other metabolic pathways like protein synthesis, tumour cell proliferation, or fatty acid synthesis. In this respect, [18 F]FCho is a promising alternative because its uptake in tumour cell is correlated to up regulated and elevated levels of choline kinase and choline transporters. Due to the affinity for the kinase enzyme, choline is metabolically trapped in tumour cells with superior imaging properties as result. To further elaborate the potential of [18 F]FCho as radiotracer, a semi-automated Scintomics synthesis module was modified for its production. However, using the prescribed synthesis procedures, we observed high levels of residual DMAE in the [18 F]FCho solution thus obtained. Remarkably, few {{attention has been paid to}} this defect, especially since in previously published reports it was noted that [11 C]Cho uptake was altered by the presence of residual DMAE. As a consequence, we attempted to produce [18 F]FCho with higher purity (i. e., lower DMAE levels) and, in line with this, to elucidate the role of residual DMAE on [18 F]FCho uptake using F 98 glioma cell lines and xenograft mouse models (Chapter 3). Having a [18 F]FCho preparation method available, an investigational medicinal product dossier was compiled for 2 clinical trials to be conducted using this tracer: 1) for the early detection of glioma recurrence after treatment of the primary tumour and 2) for differentiation between cirrhotic changes and malignant lesions in well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC). These trials required the implementation of a fully validated quality system for the production and quality control of the final [18 F]FCho solution. To assure long-term stability of this procedure, a retrospective study was conducted to evaluate the quality of the produced tracer and the validated synthesis procedure. Moreover, the compliance of the synthesis procedures and quality controls with the forthcoming PIC/s regulations for hospital pharmacies was evaluated (Chapter 4). Considering the need for quantification of the radiotracer uptake to evaluate biological processes, we assumed it was appropriate to determine a proper kinetic model for [18 F]FCho. The selected kinetic model was verified against the corresponding, but simplified graphical analysis to obtain a robust and reliable method that allows absolute quantification of the tracer uptake in tissues (Chapter 5). [18 F]FCho is currently used for the visualisation of various tumours, but oxidative metabolisation to the corresponding betaine compromises sensitivity. The development of analogues, which are less susceptible to this oxidation, seems a feasible strategy to induce tracer uptake in the tumours with improved sensitivity. For this reason, <b>dimethylaminoethanol</b> (DMAE) and homocholine were labelled with [18 F]fluoride and evaluated in vivo as potential biomarkers for the aberrant phospholipids metabolism. Indeed, preliminary in vitro tests indicated that [14 C]- and [11 C]-labelled DMAE are better tracers to visualize the tumours phospholipids metabolism, because their uptake in various tumour cells was 2 to 7 -fold higher than for [14 C]- and [11 C]-labelled choline. Considering the better radiophysical properties of [18 F]fluorinated compounds, synthesis was attempted of [18 F]-labelled DMAE as a new tracer for tumour imaging (Chapter 6). On the other hand, it was published that homocholine shows reduced affinity for the choline dehydrogenase enzyme. Accordingly, evaluation of radiolabelled homocholine and its analogues as potential biomarkers for the aberrant phospholipids metabolism was aimed at (Chapter 7) ...|$|E
