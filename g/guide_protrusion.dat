40|$|Objectives: {{to assess}} the {{sensitivity}} and specificity of ARCUSdigma in diagnosing tem-poromandibular joint (TMJ) pathology (TMD). Methods. 102 TMJs were exmined with ARCUSdigma and “Cadiax Diagnostic ” elec-tronic axiography system. Free opening, free protrusion and mediotrusion were recorded with both devices. Guided opening and <b>guided</b> <b>protrusion</b> were examined with “Cadiax Diagnostic”. Using free opening and free protrusion diagnosis was established. Results. Sensitivity of ARCUSdigma {{was found to be}} 84, 21 % and 92, 86 % for the right and left TMJ respectively. Specificity – 93, 75 % and 95, 65 % for the right and left TMJ. The 95 % confidence interval for sensitivity and specificity was calculated. Conclusions. Within the limitations of this study, ARCUSdigma appeared to be a valuable supplement to clinical findings in diagnosing TMDs.

40|$|Multiple {{attributes}} of the three-dimensional (3 D) extracellular matrix (ECM) have been independently implicated as regulators of cell motility, including pore size, crosslink density, structural organization, and stiffness. However, these parameters cannot be independently varied within a complex 3 D ECM protein network. We present an integrated, quantitative study of these parameters across {{a broad range of}} complex matrix configurations using self-assembling 3 D collagen and show how each parameter relates to the others and to cell motility. Increasing collagen density resulted in a decrease and then an increase in both pore size and fiber alignment, which both correlated significantly with cell motility but not bulk matrix stiffness within the range tested. However, using the crosslinking enzyme Transglutaminase II to alter microstructure independently of density revealed that motility is most significantly predicted by fiber alignment. Cellular protrusion rate, protrusion orientation, speed of migration, and invasion distance showed coupled biphasic responses to increasing collagen density not predicted by 2 D models or by stiffness, but instead by fiber alignment. The requirement of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity was also observed to depend on microstructure, and a threshold of MMP utility was identified. Our results suggest that fiber topography <b>guides</b> <b>protrusions</b> and thereby MMP activity and motility...|$|R

40|$|Cell {{migration}} {{is a crucial}} event during development and in disease. Mechanical constraints and chemical gradients {{can contribute to the}} establishment of cell direction, but their respective roles remain poorly understood. Using a microfabricated topographical ratchet, we show that the nucleus dictates the direction of cell movement through mechanical guidance by its environment. We demonstrate that this direction can be tuned by combining the topographical ratchet with a biochemical gradient of fibronectin adhesion. We report competition and cooperation between the two external cues. We also quantitatively compare the measurements associated with the trajectory of a model that treats cells as fluctuating particles trapped in a periodic asymmetric potential. We show that the cell nucleus contributes to the strength of the trap, whereas cell <b>protrusions</b> <b>guided</b> by the adhesive gradients add a constant tunable bias to the direction of cell motion...|$|R
40|$|Chemotaxis is {{the ability}} of cells to move in the {{direction}} of an external gradient of signaling molecules. Cells are <b>guided</b> by actin-filled <b>protrusions</b> in the front, whereas myosin filaments retract the rear of the cell. Previous work demonstrated that chemotaxis of unpolarized amoeboid Dictyostelium discoideum cells is mediated by two parallel pathways, phosphoinositide- 3 -kinase (PI 3 K) and phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2). Here, we show that polarized cells exhibit very good chemotaxis with inhibited PI 3 K and PLA 2 activity. Using genetic screens, we demonstrate that this activity is mediated by a soluble guanylyl cyclase, providing two signals. The protein localizes to the leading edge where it interacts with actin filaments, whereas the cyclic guanosine monophosphate product induces myosin filaments {{in the rear of the}} cell. We conclude that chemotaxis is mediated by multiple signaling pathways regulating protrusions at the front and rear of the cell. Cells that express only rear activity are polarized but do not exhibit chemotaxis, whereas cells with only front signaling are unpolarized but undergo chemotaxis. ...|$|R

The thesis focuses on the fabrication of biological surfaces which can be controlled via external stimuli. Chapter 1 - Introduction to Nanobiotechnology - presents {{an introduction to the}} background of this research including the role of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) in nanobiotechnology, microstructure fabrication techniques, stimuli responsive surfaces and cell migration. Chapter 2 - Surface characterization techniques - presents surface characterization techniques employed throughout this research. Chapter 3 - Study of Arp 2 / 3 complex activity in filopodia of spreading cells using patterned biological surfaces - presents the fabrication and characterization of patterned biological (fibronectin) surfaces using patterning technology (microcontact printing) and several surface analytical techniques. This study explores the role of filopodia in the spreading of Mouse Embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells and the function of Arp 2 / 3 complex in this process. The results demonstrated that filopodia, produced by MEF cells interacted with the patterned fibronectin surface and <b>guided</b> lamellipodia <b>protrusion.</b> Arp 2 / 3 complex, which is absent on the filopodia adhesion site, does not facilitate in the adhesion of filopodia on the fibronectin surface.

40|$|Introduction: Twin-block {{appliance}} {{is simple}} removable bite block mostly {{used in the}} management of Class II malocclusion. It can modify the occlusal inclined plane to <b>guide</b> the mandible <b>protrusion.</b> Hence, when the patients are wearing the Twin-block appliances, this altered biomechanical environment and will stimulate the growth of the secondary cartilage of condyle and will caused the condyle to change in size, volume or position the in long term. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the changes of horizontal distance from condyle to nasal septum after the Twin-block treatment on Class II division 1 with retrognathic mandible. Methods: There were total 5 samples of panoramic radiograph before Twin-block treatment and 5 samples of panoramic radiograph after Twin-block treatment. The panoramic radiographs were traced to identify the changes of horizontal distance from condyle to nasal septum after the Twin-block treatment. The distance from the middle of nasal septum to the most superior surface of condyle head for right region and left region were measured, then the differences were statistically analyzed. Results: The horizontal distance from the middle of nasal septum to the most superior surface of condyle head after the Twin-block treatment increased. The difference of condyle position before and after the treatment of Twin-block. was slight (p-value > 0. 05).

40|$|Dynamic {{regulation}} of cell adhesion on extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins plays vital {{roles in the}} establishment and maintenance of tissue structure. More specifically, the spatial coordination of cell-ECM adhesion foci, or focal contacts, influences direction-sensing in motile cells {{for a wide range}} of biological processes in metazoan life. Currently available evidence suggests that positive feedback loops between a few canonical signaling pathways focuses rapid turnover of focal contacts at the leading edge, where broad <b>protrusions</b> <b>guide</b> cells in one direction or another. For instance, Rho GTPases regulate the localization of specific actin cytoskeletal rearrangements, phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 K) -generated second messengers facilitate polarization of related signaling molecules, and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) may potentially act as a mediator of these distinct signaling pathways. This dissertation aims to elucidate mechanisms that coordinate these signaling pathways, with acknowledgement of the limitations of current methods in studying cell migration (Chapter 1). To address questions relating to the role of certain signaling molecules in the maintenance of direction in migration, novel methods for depositing gradients of ECM molecules have been established, including one novel technique incorporating microfluidics, which is amenable to live cell tracking via standard microscopy (Chapter 2). This microfluidic device enables the relative impact of the overexpression of various key proteins to be examined. The subsequent study suggests the role of FAK in facilitating maintained directional migration, also described as persistent migration (Chapter 3). These results suggest that FAK is a critical facilitator of direction-sensing and spatial {{regulation of}} focal contacts...|$|R
40|$|Classical Hodgkin's {{lymphoma}} (cHL) -affected {{lymphoid tissue}} contains {{only a few}} malignant Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells, which are disseminated within a massive infiltrate of reactive cells. In particular, the innate immune infiltrate is deemed to support tumour growth by direct cell-cell interaction. Since they are rarely found {{in close proximity to}} the malignant cells in situ, we investigated whether cHL-derived extracellular vesicles might substitute for a direct cell-cell contact. We studied the crosstalk of the transmembrane proteins CD 30 and CD 30 ligand (CD 30 L) because they are selectively expressed on HRS and innate immune cells, respectively. Here, we showed that HRS cells released both the ectodomain as a soluble molecule (sCD 30) and the entire receptor on the surface of extracellular vesicles. The vesicle diameter was 40 - 800 nm, as determined by cryo- and immune electron microscopy. In addition to CD 30, typical extracellular vesicle markers were detected by mass spectrometry and flow cytometry, including tetraspanins, flotillins, heat shock proteins and adhesion molecules. In contrast to sCD 30, vesicles caused a CD 30 -dependent release of interleukin- 8 in CD 30 L(+) eosinophil-like EoL- 1 cells and primary granulocytes from healthy donors, underscoring the functionality of CD 30 on vesicles. In extracellular matrix (ECM) -embedded culture of HRS cells, a network of actin and tubulin-based <b>protrusions</b> <b>guided</b> CD 30 (+) vesicles into the micro-environment. This network targeted CD 30 (+) vesicles towards distant immune cells and caused a robust polarization of CD 30 L. Confocal laser scanning microscopy of 30 µm sections showed a CD 30 vesicle-containing network also in cHL-affected lymphoid tissue of both mixed-cellularity and nodular sclerosing subtypes. This network might facilitate the communication between distant cell types in cHL tissue and allow a functional CD 30 -CD 30 L interaction in trans. The tubulin backbone of the network may provide a target for the therapy of cHL with antitubulin-based CD 30 antibody constructs...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} innovative micro-scale platforms {{as a means to}} address the current challenges within the field of cell biology, and to provide an interface between miniaturized analytical technology and experimental systems for the life sciences. The work includes an analytical platform for rapid assessment of the viability of adherent single cells; a surface patterning strategy for investigations of cell-to-cell communication via protrusions; a versatile microfluidic probe in SU- 8 hard-polymer, and a microfabricated millimeter-wave measurement system for the identification and characterization of niosome (non-ionic surfactant vesicle) constituents, which is operated in a label-free, non-invasive manner. One of the major challenges in cell biology is to understand the heterogeneity of cells, i. e., cells of the same species and in the same local environment can differ dramatically. Recent evidence suggests that these differences in individual cells can affect the development, health and function of the entire cell population, and for this reason, single-cell studies have become increasingly important. However, there remains a need of instrumentation for efficient analytical investigations on single cells in adherent cultures and tissue slices. My thesis addresses some of the research problems that life scientists encounter in single-cell experiments, and suggests novel analytical devices and protocols that provide efficient solutions to these problems. One of them is a protocol for the rapid determination of the viability of individual mammalian cells in adherent cell cultures, utilizing a microfluidic device for selective perfusion of targeted cells (Paper I). I also introduce micropatterned cytophobic polymer (Teflon AF) on glass as cell culture substrate, which exhibits differential adhesion properties with respect to biological cells. This enabled the analysis of spatially separated cells in terms of their ability to establish interconnections by reaching out to other cells via <b>protrusions,</b> <b>guided</b> by the pre-determined surface pattern. Applying a microfluidic device for selective perfusion of single cells grown on these substrates allowed for examination of the chemical communication between interconnected pairs of cells (Paper II). In Paper III, a facile process for fabrication of free-standing microfluidic devices in a photo-patternable hard-polymer (SU- 8) is reported. This constitutes a major, necessary step towards large-scale fabrication of diversely functionalized single-cell superfusion devices with high potential in drug screening and diagnostics. Finally, in Paper IV, a concept for an open-volume dielectric spectroscopy platform based on millimeter-wave technology, developed for label-free identification and characterization of niosome constituents, is presented. The microfabricated platform creates new opportunities for analyzing and characterizing the compositional variances in niosome membranes in the context of drug delivery...|$|R
