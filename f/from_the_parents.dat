2500|$|The Janzen-Connell {{model is}} one of the most {{important}} studies of how seed predation may influence plant demography. The Janzen-Connell model illustrates how seed density and survival respond to distance <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> tree and differential rates of seed predation. Seed density is hypothesized to decrease as distance <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> tree increases. Where seeds are most abundant under <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> tree, seed predation is predicted to be at its highest. As distance <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> tree increases, seed abundance and thus seed predation are predicted to decrease as seed survival increases.|$|R

[...] All this stimulation {{is important for the}} baby’s development.|$|R
5|$|Spanning World War II, when American comics {{provided}} {{cheap and}} disposable escapist entertainment {{that could be}} read and then discarded by the troops, the Golden Age of comic books covered the late 1930s to the late 1940s. A number of major superheroes were created during this period, including Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Captain Marvel, and Captain America. In subsequent years comics were blamed for a rise in juvenile crime statistics, although this rise was shown to be {{in direct proportion to}} population growth. When juvenile offenders admitted to reading comics, it was seized on as a common denominator; one notable critic was Fredric Wertham, author of the book Seduction of the Innocent (1954), who attempted to shift the blame for juvenile delinquency <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>parents</b> of the children to the comic books they read. The result was a decline in the comics industry. To address public concerns, in 1954 the Comics Code Authority was created to regulate and curb violence in comics, marking {{the start of a new}} era.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{generated}} significant controversy. Former Governor of Alaska and 2008 Republican vice-presidential nominee Sarah Palin, who is referenced {{briefly in}} the episode as being the mother of Ellen, took offense to the episode's portrayal of Down syndrome, due to her son's diagnosis of the disorder. Andrea Fay Friedman, who was also diagnosed with Down syndrome and portrayed the character of Ellen, publicly refuted Palin, instead supporting executive producer and series creator Seth MacFarlane, who defended the episode, and was also supported by Bill Maher, the host of Real Time. The episode got more criticism <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Parents</b> Television Council during its original broadcast.|$|E

The legislation requires that at each event, the mohel receives signed consent forms <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>parents,</b> acknowledging that they were notified of health risks associated with cleaning the wound by sucking blood from the male baby's organ. This regulation caused an outcry among certain Orthodox Jewish communities on this alleged infringement of their religious freedom, and the matter was taken to federal court.|$|E
25|$|Rolling Stone {{magazine}} {{was founded in}} San Francisco in 1967 by Jann Wenner and Ralph Gleason. To get it off the ground, Wenner borrowed $7,500 from his own family and <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>parents</b> of his soon-to-be wife, Jane Schindelheim. The first issue carried a cover date of November 9, 1967, and was in newspaper format with a lead article on the Monterey Pop Festival. The cover price was 25¢ (equivalent to $ in 2016).|$|E

25|$|A causal {{network is}} a Bayesian network with an {{explicit}} {{requirement that the}} relationships be causal. The additional semantics of the causal networks specify that if a node X is actively caused {{to be in a}} given state x (an action written as do(X=x)), then the probability density function changes to the one of the network obtained by cutting the links <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>parents</b> of X to X, and setting X to the caused value x. Using these semantics, one can predict the impact of external interventions from data obtained prior to intervention.|$|E
25|$|There is {{verbal and}} nonverbal {{guidance}} from parents to children with chores and other activities. For example, {{a pat on the}} shoulder can communicate to the child that he/she is doing the activity at hand the correct way. This example relates to the LOPI model by there being an appraisal <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>parent(s)</b> in order to support their progress in learning and contributing better in the community. As the child gradually advances towards more complex tasks, the goal of mastery and feedback on the adequacy of their contributions become more pronounced.|$|E

After Rais admitted to the charges on 21 October, the court canceled a plan to torture him into confessing. Peasants of the neighboring villages had earlier begun to make accusations that their children had entered Gilles' castle begging for food and had never been seen again. The transcript, which included testimony <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>parents</b> {{of many of these}} missing children as well as graphic descriptions of the murders provided by Gilles' accomplices, was said to be so lurid that the judges ordered the worst portions to be stricken from the record.|$|E
25|$|The 'origin of the soul' has {{provided}} a vexing question in Christianity. The major theories put forward include soul creationism, traducianism, and pre-existence. According to creationism, each individual soul is created directly by God, either {{at the moment of}} conception or some later time. According to traducianism, the soul comes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>parents</b> by natural generation. According to the preexistence theory, the soul exists before the moment of conception. There have been differing thoughts regarding whether human embryos have souls from conception, or there is a point between conception and birth where the fetus acquires a soul, consciousness, and/or personhood. Stances in this question might more or less influence judgements on the morality of abortion.|$|E
25|$|Multiculturalism – Although the {{theoretical}} foundations of psychology {{are rooted in}} European culture, {{there is a growing}} recognition that there exist profound differences between various ethnic and social groups and that systems of psychotherapy need to take those differences into greater consideration. Further, the generations following immigrant migration will have some combination of two or more cultures—with aspects coming <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>parents</b> and from the surrounding society—and this process of acculturation can play a strong role in therapy (and might itself be the presenting problem). Culture influences ideas about change, help-seeking, locus of control, authority, and the importance of the individual versus the group, all of which can potentially clash with certain givens in mainstream psychotherapeutic theory and practice. As such, there is a growing movement to integrate knowledge of various cultural groups in order to inform therapeutic practice in a more culturally sensitive and effective way.|$|E
