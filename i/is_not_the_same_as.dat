5|$|Corals' {{many colors}} give it appeal for {{necklaces}} and other jewelry. Intensely red coral is prized as a gemstone. Sometimes called fire coral, it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> fire coral. Red coral {{is very rare}} because of overharvesting.|$|E
5|$|Another {{economic}} measure, {{closely related}} to the energy payback time, is the energy returned on energy invested (EROEI) or energy return on investment (EROI), which is the ratio of electricity generated divided by the energy required to build and maintain the equipment. (This <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> the economic return on investment (ROI), which varies according to local energy prices, subsidies available and metering techniques.) With expected lifetimes of 30 years, the EROEI of PV systems are in the range of 10 to 30, thus generating enough energy over their lifetimes to reproduce themselves many times (6-31 reproductions) depending on what type of material, balance of system (BOS), and the geographic location of the system.|$|E

5|$|Hairan I: {{the name}} appears on a 251 {{inscription}} from Palmyra describing him as Ras implying {{that he was}} already an adult by then. In the Augustan History, Odaenathus' eldest son is named Herod; the inscription at Palmyra dating to 263 celebrating Hairan's coronation mentions him with the name Herodianus. It is possible that Hairan of the 251 inscription <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> Herodianus of the 263, but this is contested by Hartmann who conclude {{that the reason for}} the difference in the spelling is due to the language used in the inscription (Herodianus being the Greek version), meaning that Odaenathus' eldest son and co-king is Hairan Herodianus.|$|E
5|$|The {{aerodynamics}} of a {{wind turbine}} are not straightforward. The air flow at the blades <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> the airflow {{far away from}} the turbine. The very nature {{of the way in which}} energy is extracted from the air also causes air to be deflected by the turbine. In addition the aerodynamics of a wind turbine at the rotor surface exhibit phenomena that are rarely seen in other aerodynamic fields. The shape and dimensions of the blades of the wind turbine are determined by the aerodynamic performance required to efficiently extract energy from the wind, and by the strength required to resist the forces on the blade.|$|E
5|$|The central {{concept of}} natural {{selection}} is the evolutionary fitness of an organism. Fitness is measured by an organism's ability to survive and reproduce, which determines {{the size of its}} genetic contribution to the next generation. However, fitness <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> the total number of offspring: instead fitness is indicated by the proportion of subsequent generations that carry an organism's genes. For example, if an organism could survive well and reproduce rapidly, but its offspring were all too small and weak to survive, this organism would make little genetic contribution to future generations and would thus have low fitness.|$|E

5|$|An embargo <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> Food Power, however, {{food power}} {{can be used in}} an embargo. In fact, embargoes that do not involve food in their list of {{restricted}} items often fail. For example, on August 20, 1914 the Allied Powers began an embargo on important items that were normally shipped to Germany. However, the embargo was not complete nor effective until food was added to the list of restricted materials. Food has the real power. After food was introduced the blockade began to strangle Germany's economy because they were dependent on imports for food. Because the Allied Powers used the power of food in their embargo, Germany was forced to resort to desperate measures and eventually failed despite them.|$|E
5|$|Some animals {{mimic the}} optic {{flow of the}} background, so that the {{attacker}} {{does not appear to}} move when seen by the target. This is the main focus of work on motion camouflage, and is often treated as synonymous with it. An attacker can achieve this by choosing its flight path so as to remain on the line between the target and either some real landmark point, or a point at infinite distance (giving different pursuit algorithms). It therefore does not move from the landmark point as seen by the target, though it inevitably looms larger as it approaches. This <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> moving straight towards the target (classical pursuit): that results in visible sideways motion with a readily detectable difference in optic flow from the background. The strategy works whether the background is plain or textured.|$|E
5|$|The body of {{a modern}} soprano {{clarinet}} is equipped with numerous tone holes of which seven (six front, one back) are covered with the fingertips, and the rest are opened or closed using a set of keys. These tone holes let the player produce every note of the chromatic scale. On alto and larger clarinets, and a few soprano clarinets, key-covered holes replace some or all finger holes. The most common system of keys was named the Boehm system by its designer Hyacinthe Klosé in honour of flute designer Theobald Boehm, but it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> the Boehm system used on flutes. The other main system of keys is called the Oehler system and is used mostly in Germany and Austria (see History). The related Albert system is used by some jazz, klezmer, and eastern European folk musicians. The Albert and Oehler systems are both based on the early Mueller system.|$|E

5|$|After {{cancelling}} the self-destruct, {{they find}} the Bynars have uploaded massive amounts of information to the Enterprise computers, but {{they are unable to}} decode it. Realizing that Minuet was purposely created by the Bynars as a distraction, Picard and Riker ask the simulation {{about what is going on}} as the ship nears the orbit of Bynar. Minuet explains that a star near the Bynar homeworld had gone supernova, and the EMP it emitted would knock out their computer systems, effectively killing the Bynars. They had used the Enterprise to upload their computer information for safekeeping and then planned to download it back to the Bynar computers after the threat of the EMP had passed. With Data's help, Picard and Riker successfully download the data, and the Bynars recover. They apologize for their actions, having feared that Starfleet would refuse to help, though Picard notes they only had to ask. As the Enterprise returns to Starbase, Riker returns to the holodeck to thank Minuet but finds that without the Bynar data, the simulation has regressed to the expected norm for the holodeck, and while Minuet still exists, she <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> before. Riker reports to Picard that Minuet is gone.|$|E
5|$|Robert van Voren {{also says}} Russian {{psychiatry}} {{is now being}} headed by the same psychiatrists who was heading psychiatry in Soviet times. Since then Russian psychiatric system has not almost changed. In reality, we still see a sort of the Soviet psychiatry {{that was in the}} late 1980s. Russian psychiatrists {{do not have access to}} specialized literature published in other countries and do not understand what is world psychiatry. Staff training has not changed, literature is inaccessible, the same psychiatrists teach new generations of specialists. Those of them who know what is world psychiatry and know it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> what is happening in Russia are silent and afraid. The powerful core of the old nomenklatura in psychiatry was concentrated in Moscow, and it was clear that the struggle inside their fortress would be not only difficult, but also it would be a waste of time, energy and resources, so the Global Initiative on Psychiatry has been avoiding Moscow almost completely for all the years. Instead, the Global Initiative on Psychiatry took active part in projects for reforming the mental health service in Ukraine, donated a printing plant to Ukrainian public, organized a publishing house, helped print a huge amount of medical and legal literature distributed for free, but the Ukrainian tax police accused the publishing house of manufacturing counterfeit dollars, and a significant part of humanitarian aid that the Global Initiative on Psychiatry had gathered in the Netherlands for Ukrainian psychiatric hospitals was stolen in Kiev.|$|E
5|$|The law {{of large}} numbers predicts that when the {{absolute}} number of copies of the allele is small (e.g., in small populations), the magnitude of drift on allele frequencies per generation is larger. The magnitude of drift {{is large enough to}} overwhelm selection at any allele frequency when the selection coefficient is less than 1 divided by the effective population size. Non-adaptive evolution resulting from the product of mutation and genetic drift is therefore considered to be a consequential mechanism of evolutionary change primarily within small, isolated populations. The mathematics of genetic drift depend on the effective population size, {{but it is not clear}} how this is related to the actual number of individuals in a population. Genetic linkage to other genes that are under selection can reduce the effective population size experienced by a neutral allele. With a higher recombination rate, linkage decreases and with it this local effect on effective population size. This effect is visible in molecular data as a correlation between local recombination rate and genetic diversity, and negative correlation between gene density and diversity at noncoding DNA regions. Stochasticity associated with linkage to other genes that are under selection <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> sampling error, and is sometimes known as genetic draft in order to distinguish it from genetic drift.|$|E
