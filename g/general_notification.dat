40|$|Abstract Background The {{requirement}} to obtain written informed consent may undermine {{the potential of}} pragmatic randomized clinical trials (pRCTs) to improve evidence-based care. This requirement could compromise trials statistical power or even force it to close them down prematurely. However, recent data from the U. S. and Spain suggest {{that a majority of}} the public endorses written consent for low-risk pRCTs. The present manuscript assesses whether this view is shared by patients. Methods This was a cross-sectional, probability-based survey, with a 2  ×  2 factorial design, assessing support for written informed consent versus verbal consent or <b>general</b> <b>notification</b> for two low-risk pRCTs in hypertension, one comparing 2 drugs with similar risk/benefit profiles and the other comparing the same drug being taken in the morning or at night. This web-based survey was conducted in May 2016. Two-thousand and eight adults who were representative of the Spanish population participated in the survey (response rate: 61 %). Of these 2008 respondents, 338 indicated that they had been diagnosed with hypertension and were being treated with prescription medicines for this condition at the time of responding to the survey. The primary outcome measures were respondents’ personal preference and recommendation to a research ethics committee regarding the use of written informed consent versus verbal consent or <b>general</b> <b>notification.</b> Results Overall, 74 % of the 338 patient respondents endorsed written consent. In both scenarios, <b>general</b> <b>notification</b> received significantly more support (30. 6 %- 44. 7 %) than verbal consent (13. 3 %- 17. 6 %). 43 % of respondents preferred and/or recommended <b>general</b> <b>notification</b> rather than written consent. Conclusions As in the survey of the general public, more patients endorsed written consent than the alternative option. However, two factors suggest that a different approach to written consent should be investigated for low-risk pRCTs: a) a substantial minority of respondents supported <b>general</b> <b>notification,</b> b) data from the US have shown that most patients who prefer written consent are willing to forego it if obtaining written consent makes the trial too difficult to be conducted; and c) 2016 CIOMS guidelines endorse waivers of consent when the trial fulfills specific conditions. Surveys in other EU countries are needed to assess what patients believe towards pRCTs. If similar results to that reported in this study are found, it is foreseeable that with educational efforts, <b>general</b> <b>notification</b> could be an acceptable and widespread approach to the conduct of low-risk pRCTs...|$|E
40|$|Aims: Pragmatic {{randomized}} {{clinical trials}} (pRCTs) {{collect data that}} {{have the potential to}} improve medical care significantly. However, these trials may be undermined by the requirement to obtain written informed consent, which can decrease accrual and increase selection bias. Recent data suggest {{that the majority of the}} US public endorses written consent for low-risk pRCTs. The present study was designed to assess whether this view is specific to the US. Methods: The study took the form of a cross-sectional, probability-based survey, with a 2 × 2 factorial design, assessing support for written informed consent vs. verbal consent or <b>general</b> <b>notification</b> for two low-risk pRCTs in hypertension, one comparing two drugs with similar risk/benefit profiles and the other comparing the same drug being taken in the morning or at night. The primary outcome measures were respondents' personal preference and hypothetical recommendation to a research ethics committee regarding the use of written informed consent vs. the alternatives. Results: A total of 2008 adults sampled from a probability-based online panel responded to the web-based survey conducted in May 2016 (response rate: 61 %). Overall, 77 % of respondents endorsed written consent. In both scenarios, the alternative of <b>general</b> <b>notification</b> received significantly more support (28. 7 – 37. 1 %) than the alternative of verbal consent (12. 7 – 14. 0 %) (P = 0. 001). Forty per cent of respondents preferred and/or recommended <b>general</b> <b>notification</b> rather than written consent. Conclusions: The results suggested that, rather than attempting to waive written consent, current pRCTs should focus on developing ways to implement written consent that provide sufficient information without undermining recruitment or increasing selection bias. The finding that around 40 % of respondents endorsed <b>general</b> <b>notification</b> over written consent raises the possibility that, with educational efforts, the majority of Spaniards might accept <b>general</b> <b>notification</b> for low-risk pRCTsThis work was supported in part by the Victor Grifols i Lucas Foundation (Barcelona, Spain:[URL] The present work was funded in part by intramural research funds of the US NIH Clinical Cente...|$|E

40|$|Pertussis, {{caused by}} {{infection}} with the gram negative B. pertussis bacterium, {{is a serious}} respiratory illness that can last for months. While B. pertussis infection rates are estimated between 1 - 10 % in the <b>general</b> population, <b>notifications</b> of symptomatic pertussis only comprise 0. 01 - 0. 1 % indicating that most individuals clear B. pertussis infections without developing (severe) clinical symptoms. In this study we investigated whether genetic risk factors {{are involved in the}} development of symptomatic pertussis upon B. pertussis infection. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in candidate genes, MBL 2, IL 17 A, TNFα, VDR, and IL 10 were genotyped in a unique Dutch cohort of symptomatic clinically confirmed (ex-) pertussis patients and in a Dutch population cohort. Of the seven investigated SNPs in five genes, a polymorphism in the Vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene (rs 10735810) was associated with pertussis. The VDR major allele and its homozygous genotype were more present in the symptomatic pertussis patient cohort compared to the control population cohort. Interestingly, the VDR major allele correlated also with the duration of reported pertussis symptoms. Vitamin D 3 (VD 3) and VDR are important regulators of immune activation. Altogether, these findings suggest that polymorphisms in the VDR gene may affect immune activation and the clinical outcome of B. pertussis infection...|$|R
5000|$|Another {{capability}} of UPnP networking is event notification, or eventing. The event notification protocol {{defined in the}} UPnP Device Architecture is known as <b>General</b> Event <b>Notification</b> Architecture (GENA). A UPnP description for a service includes a list of actions the service responds to {{and a list of}} variables that model the state of the service at run time. The service publishes updates when these variables change, and a control point may subscribe to receive this information. The service publishes updates by sending event messages. Event messages contain the names of one or more state variables and the current value of those variables. These messages are also expressed in XML. A special initial event message is sent when a control point first subscribes; this event message contains the names and values for all evented variables and allows the subscriber to initialize its model {{of the state of the}} service. To support scenarios with multiple control points, eventing is designed to keep all control points equally informed about the effects of any action. Therefore, all subscribers are sent all event messages, subscribers receive event messages for all [...] "evented" [...] variables that have changed, and event messages are sent no matter why the state variable changed (either in response to a requested action or because the state the service is modeling changed).|$|R

40|$|The {{issue of}} notifying {{people who have}} been exposed to blood {{products}} that have been associated with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) has arisen {{at a time when the}} Canadian blood system is under intense scrutiny. As a result, the Canadian Red Cross Society issued a recommendation to health care institutions that recipients of CJD-associated blood products be identified, notified and counselled. Although Canadian jurisprudence in the realm of informed consent may support a policy of individual notification, a review of the scientific evidence and the applicable ethical principles arguably favours a policy of a more general public notification. Indeed, situations such as this require a unique approach to the formation of legal and ethical duties, one that effectively integrates all relevant factors. As such, the authors argue that individual notification is currently not justified. Nevertheless, if a system of <b>general</b> <b>notification</b> is implemented (e. g., through a series of public health announcements), it should provide, for people who wish to know, the opportunity to find out whether they were given CJD-associated products...|$|E
40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} cooperation between primary schools and authorities {{of social and}} legal protection of children. Social and legal protection of children is provided to children whose parents fail to fulfil the obligations defined in parental responsibility or fail to pursue or abuse the rights defined in parental responsibility. Social and legal protection is also provided to children leading immoral or shiftless way of life or regularly escaping from their parents. The <b>general</b> <b>notification</b> obligation assigns schools to notify local authorities of communities with wide competences of fact that indicate that a child requires social and legal protection. The goal of the thesis {{is to find out}} how a primary school cooperates with a children social-law care department in relation to social pathologic behaviour in primary school children. Two research questions were set to reach the goal. I tried to find out in what way cooperation between primary schools and authorities of social and legal protection of children is conducted and whether primary school teachers and social workers consider the cooperation efficient, by means of semi -structured interviews with primary school teachers and with social workers. The data obtained this way were analysed by the open data coding method. The cooperation is based on mutual transfer of information on pupils with problems, reports and written assessment of pupil's behaviour and school result. Social workers and primary school teachers meet at consultation meetings and also at disciplinary boards and case conferences. School teachers and social workers consider their cooperation effective. Certain problems however occur in their cooperation. To make the cooperation more effective two teachers propose more frequent updating of laws and applicable regulations with regard to current needs of children and legislation modification. Social workers propose establishment of a multidisciplinary team, an increase of the number of social workers and presence of a lawyer at the children social-law protection department, education in social and legal protection of children for primary school teachers, and an Internet forum. The results of the thesis may be used for making the cooperation more efficient and for prevention of risky behaviour among primary school children...|$|E
40|$|Stiprus prekių ženklas, tai viena pagrindinių sėkmingo verslo sudedamųjų dalių. Prekių ženklais yra laikomi bet kokie žymenys, kurie gali būti pavaizduoti grafiškai bei kurių esminė funkcija – vieno asmens prekes ar paslaugas atskirti nuo kito asmens prekių ar paslaugų. Tačiau tam, kad ženklui būtų suteikiama teisinė apsauga, kuri padeda apsisaugoti nuo nesąžiningų konkurencijos veiksmų, prekių ženklą reikia įregistruoti nacionaliniu, Europos Sąjungos arba tarptautiniu lygiu. Tam, kad būtų užtikrinta vienoda šalių praktika prekių ženklų registravimo atžvilgiu, 1957 m. buvo sukurta Nicos klasifikacija, sudaryta iš bendro prekių ir paslaugų klasių sąrašo, kartu su reikalingais paaiškinimais, bei abėcėlinio prekių ir paslaugų sąrašo su atitinkamos klasės nuoroda, kuriai yra priskiriama kiekviena prekė ar paslauga. Teigdami paraišką įregistruoti atitinkamą prekių ženklą, pareiškėjai dažnai nurodo tik atitinkamos Nicos klasifikacijos klasės antraštės bendrąsias sąvokas. Iki 2012 metų birželio mėnesio klasių antraščių bendrosios sąvokos buvo interpretojamos remiantis dviem požiūriais. Pirmasis požiūris teigė, jog „klasių antraštės apima visą klasę“, o antrasis nurodė, jog „reiškia tai, kas parašyta. “ Nenuostabu, kad valstybių tarnybose skirtingai interpretuojant klasių antraščių bendrųjų sąvokų naudojimą prekių ženklo registracijos paraiškose, kilo didelių abejonių nustatinėjant tokios registracijos teikiamos apsaugos ribas. 2012 m. birželio 19 d. Europos Sąjungos Teisingumo Teisme buvo priimtas sprendimas vadinamojoje „IP Translator“ byloje, sukėlęs daugiau klausimų nei pateikęs atsakymų. Atsižvelgiant į tai, šiame darbe buvo siekama analizuojant minėtą sprendimą bei jo pasekoje Europos Sąjungos prekių ženklų ir dizaino paskelbtus Bendruosius pranešimus, Europos Parlamento ir Tarybos reglamentą Nr. 2015 / 2424 išsiaiškinti, ar norint nustatyti prekes ir paslaugas, kurioms yra prašoma prekių ženklo apsaugos pakanka nurodyti Nicos klasifikacijos klasių antraščių bendrąsias sąvokas. Darbe buvo išsiaiškinta, jog iš visų Nicos klasifikacijos klasių antraščių bendrųjų sąvokų tik penkios nėra pakankamai aiškios ir tikslios, dėl ko tik jomis remiantis be papildomo patikslinimo nėra galimybės nustatyti kokia yra atitinkamos prekių ženklo registracijos suteikiamos apsaugos apimtis. Todėl, kaip nurodoma naujajame Europos Parlamento ir Tarybos reglamente Nr. 2015 / 2424, Nicos klasifikacijos klasių antraščių bendrųjų sąvokų naudojimas yra galima, jeigu nėra pažeidžiamas aiškumo bei tikslumo kriterijus. Strong {{trademark}} {{is one of}} {{the main}} components of successful business. Any marks, which are illustrated graphically and have the essential function to separate goods and services from another person’s goods and services, are considered to be trademarks. However in order to grant legal protection to the trademark that helps to protect against unfair competitive actions, the trademark has to be registered on the national, European Union’s or international level. In order to ensure the unanimous registration practice of trademarks in the Special Union, Nice classification was created in 1957. This classification consists of common list of classes, necessary explanations and alphabetic list of goods and services with the reference of certain class, to which the product or service is attributed. It covers 45 classes in total. It is an often case in practice that the applicant indicates only general concepts of certain heading of the Nice Classification in the registration application. Two approaches were predominant among the States until June 2012, which were applied to explain the usage of general concepts of classes’ headings in registration applications. The first approach is when “the headings of classes cover the entire class”, thus accordingly, when the agencies use the second approach, they “see what is written” and the headings were assessed literally. Therefore there is no wonder that big doubts arouse while setting the protection limits of registration in different countries, where the usage of general concepts of headings in the registration applications was interpreted differently. The decision of the Court of Justice in so called “IP Translator” case had an especially big influence on the approach that the situation has to be changed because of such legal ambiguity. It was solved in the aforementioned case whether the general concepts of the heading of the class 41 “Education, Entertainment, Training, Sport and Cultural Activities” cover the translation services, as well. The prejudicial matters were used essentially to learn whether the usage of general concepts of headings of the classes of Nice Classification is possible in the application for trademark’s registration and how clearly and accurately the goods and services are identified, with regard to which the trademark’s protection is requested. Although this decision was waited in expectation to solve the problem of legal ambiguity, but actually it raised more questions than answers. Therefore the purpose of this work is to learn whether it is enough to indicate the general concepts of headings of the classes of Nice Classification in order to identify goods and services, with regard to which the trademark’s protection is requested. The main focus is given to the analysis of general notices published by ESINT with regard to application of Nice Classification. According to the <b>General</b> <b>notification</b> of 20 February 2014 on acceptability of classification terms for general practice v 1. 0, it was attempted to learn the criteria, with the help of which it should be determined whether certain term is clear and precise. It was determined that descriptions of certain goods and services are considered sufficiently clear and precise only when their protection scope may be determined according to usual meaning of their descriptions. If it is not possible to understand what the protection scope is, the sufficient precision and clarity may be achieved through identification of certain factors, for example characteristic, purpose and/or identified sector of the market. Besides, the situations may be possible that the same term is used in description of several classes. However it will be sufficiently clear and precise in one class, and completely unclear in another. The analysis of the <b>General</b> <b>notification</b> of 20 February 2014 on execution of the decision in the case “IP Translator” v 1. 2 helped to distinguish three modes, on the ground of which the possibility is granted to the applicants to ensure the protection of the entire alphabetic list when applying for the trademark’s registration after the decision in the case “IP Translator”. So the applicants may fill out the declaration, to mark the field electronically or to name each concept separately. The attention should be paid to the fact that each country chooses individually whether to apply one or several modes. In order to learn, which general concepts of Nice Classification are not clear and precise, the <b>General</b> <b>notification</b> of 28 October 2015 on the practice of application of general concepts of headings of the classes of Nice Classification v 1. 2 was used. It helped to distinguish 5 general concepts, i. e. concept of the class 7 “Machinery”, concept of the class 37 “Repairs” and “Installation services”, concept of the class 40 “Treatment of materials”, and concept of the class 45 “Personal and social services rendered by others to meet the needs of individuals”. In the end of the work the attention was paid to the fact that one of the essential outcomes of the case “IP Translator” was the new Regulation of the European Parliament and Council No. 2015 / 2424, that has replaced in part the Regulation on Community’s trademark. The new regulation contains the provision that the general concepts of headings of the classes of Nice Classification have to be interpreted literally, i. e. they cover the goods and services, which are meant literally by appropriate general concept...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Since the 1980 s, {{clinical}} trial evidence has supported aspirin {{use in the}} secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD). AIM: To explore aspirin use among British men with known CVD in a population-based study. METHOD: Longitudinal study (British Regional Heart Study), in which subjects have been followed up for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality since 1978 - 1980. Aspirin use was assessed by questionnaires to study participants in November 1992 (Q 92); cardiovascular diagnoses are based on <b>general</b> practice <b>notifications</b> to October 1992. A total of 5751 men aged 52 - 73 years (87 % of survivors) completed questions on aspirin use. RESULTS: Overall, 547 men (9. 5 %) were taking aspirin daily, of whom 321 (59 %) had documented CVD. Among men with pre-existing disease, 153 out of 345 (44 %) men with myocardial infarction, 42 out of 109 (39 %) with stroke, and 75 out of 247 (29 %) with angina were taking aspirin daily. Among men with angina (54 % versus 26 %) or myocardial infarction (59 % versus 42 %), those who had undergone coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) or angioplasty {{were more likely to}} be receiving aspirin. Higher rates of aspirin use were also found in those whose last major event occurred after January 1990 (47 % versus 34 %). There was no association between aspirin use and social class or region of residence. CONCLUSION: Despite strong evidence of its effectiveness, many patients with established CVD were not receiving aspirin. Daily aspirin treatment was less likely in men with less recent major CVD events and in those who had not received invasive treatment...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{methods for}} estimating {{the efficiency of}} measles and pertussis notification with particular reference to England and Wales. Crude estimates are obtained from a comparison of annual numbers of births and notifications, and this approach is modified to include detailed age-specific data. Other sources of data, notably the Hospital In-Patient Enquiry, are used to give detailed estimates over time. These analyses provide evidence for a strong positive correlation between notification efficiency and incidence for both diseases and for a dramatic fall in the notification efficiency for pertussis between 1957 and 1976. This decrease {{is of particular interest}} insofar as it could explain in part the apparent fall in size of successive pertussis epidemics during that period. It is estimated that since 1976 the spotter practices of the Royal College of General Practitioners General Practice Research Unit have been approximately 1. 5 times more efficient at reporting measles and 2. 5 times more efficient at reporting pertussis than the national average for reporting to the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys. Finally it is noted that estimates of notification efficiency are positively correlated with the assumed level of vaccine efficacy, and that all these methods require assumptions concerning the proportion of vaccinations which are recorded, the proportion of vaccinations which are successful in immunizing the recipient, and the proportion of the population which ultimately contracts the infection. In <b>general,</b> measles <b>notification</b> in England and Wales is considerably better than that for pertussis, being of the order of 40 - 60 % for the former and only 5 - 25 % for the latter...|$|R
40|$|A subtle shift {{has taken}} place in the {{mechanics}} of preemption, the doctrine that determines when federal law displaces state law. In the past, Congress was the leading actor, and courts and commentators focused almost exclusively on the precise wording of its statutory directives as a clue to its intent to displace state law. Federal agencies were, if not ignored, certainly no more than supporting players. But the twenty-first century has witnessed a role reversal. Federal agencies now play the dominant role in statutory interpretation. The U. S. Supreme Court has recognized the ascendancy of federal agencies in preemption disputes—an ascendancy unchecked by the change in presidential administrations. This Article confronts the profound implications for the administrative rulemaking process caused by the ascendancy of federal agencies in the preemption realm. Stakeholders with vested interests in preemption disputes, such as state governmental organizations, state attorneys general, consumer- and business-oriented organizations, and private litigants, can continue to ignore the preemptive rulemaking processes within federal agencies only at their peril. As this Article further shows, those processes are, in and of themselves, rich areas for investigation. Taking a unique perspective “inside” the preemptive rulemaking processes within five major federal agencies that regulate in areas as diverse as health and safety, banking, and the environment, this Article presents the first look at agencies’ responses to President Obama’s Memorandum on Preemption and their efforts to ensure compliance with the relevant provisions of Federalism Executive Order 13132, which governs preemptive rulemaking. With this empirical grounding in agency practice, the Article addresses possibilities for reform, including a novel attorney <b>general</b> preemption <b>notification</b> provision and a blueprint for external review of newly proposed internal oversight procedures. The specific reform measures are guided by the overarching goals of (1) creating a “home” within agencies for consideration of the federalism values at stake in preemptive rulemaking and ensuring participation in the rulemaking process by suitable representatives of state regulatory interests; and (2) establishing a system of internal agency policing of the empirical and factual predicates to arguments for preemption, coupled with external oversight. This journey inside agency preemption charts preemption’s future path...|$|R

It is also significant feature that, Members who were earlier designated of as Members of Regional Council(MRC), then {{came to be known}} as Member of District Council(MDC) with the upgradation of the Regional Council to the status of full-fledged Autonomous District Counci.In spite of being identified as Pawi in Mizoram, the Lai regarded the appellation [...] "Pawi" [...] as a derogatory term, as such; they never identified themselves as Pawi but Lai. So, the leaders of Lai began to fight and demand for abolition of the name ‘Pawi’ and wanted to change it into ‘Lai’. Thus, under the Sixth Schedule to the Constitution (Amendment) Act,1988 of Indian Parliament (No.67 of 1988) and by Notification No.DCA/E/154/81/40.the name Pawi Autonomous District Council was changed into Lai Autonomous District Council (LADC) in 1988. However, the name of the tribe is still listed as Pawi in serial number 13 of the list of Schedule Castes and Schedule Tribes of Mizoram.The three Autonomous District Councils of Mizoram, viz, the Lai Autonomous District Council (LADC), the Mara Autonomous District Council(MADC), and the Chakma Autonomous District Council were under the administrative jurisdiction of Chhimtuipui revenue district till August 1998, and Chhimtuipui district was bifurcated into two new revenue district, namely, Chhimtuipui West District with headquarters at Lawngtlai and Chhimtuipui East District with headquarters at Saiha by the Govt. of Mizoram. The Chhimtuipui west district comprised the areas covered by the LADC and CADC excluding the areas under Sangau Assembly Constituency of the LADC. The Chhimtuipui East District comprised the remaining areas of the then undivided Chhimtuipui District covered by the MADC and areas under Sangau Assembly Constituency of the LADC. Later on, per <b>General</b> Administration Department <b>Notification</b> No.F.20016/2/99 dated 3 June 1999 of the Govt. of Mizoram, Chhimtuipui West District was changed into Lawngtlai District and the Chhimtuipui East District was also changed into Saiha District. As the Lai were not satisfied with the allocation of Sangau Block under the administrative jurisdiction of Saiha District, the winter session of the LADC on 4 December 2000, unanimously resolved to request the Govt. of Mizoram, to reallocate Sangau Block under the administrative jurisdiction of Lawngtlai District. As a measure for facilitating better administrative efficiency as well as fulfilling the wishes of the Lai people, the Govt. of Mizoram placed Sangau Block under the jurisdiction of Lawngtlai District since October 2005.|$|R
