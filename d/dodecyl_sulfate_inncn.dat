40|$|The {{adsorption}} of the polymer-surfactant {{mixture of}} poly(2 -ethyl- 2 -oxazoline) -sodium <b>dodecyl</b> <b>sulfate</b> at the air-water interface {{has been studied}} by neutron reflectivity and surface tension. The observed patterns of adsorption more closely resemble those encountered in weakly interacting polymer-surfactant mixtures, rather than the pronounced enhancements in adsorption observed in strongly interacting polymer-surfactant mixtures, {{such as in the}} related poly(ethyleneimine) -sodium <b>dodecyl</b> <b>sulfate</b> mixtures. The adsorption was found to be strongly dependent on solution pH, polymer molecular weight, and polymer concentration. At the lower and higher molecular weights studied, there was little enhancement in the sodium <b>dodecyl</b> <b>sulfate</b> adsorption at low sodium <b>dodecyl</b> <b>sulfate</b> concentrations, whereas at the intermediate polymer molecular weights, some enhancement in the adsorption was observed. For the higher-molecular-weight polymers and at increasingly higher polymer concentrations, a significant reduction of the surfactant at the interface compared to pure sodium <b>dodecyl</b> <b>sulfate</b> occurred for sodium <b>dodecyl</b> <b>sulfate</b> concentrations between the critical aggregation concentration and the critical micellar concentration. The results illustrate the important role of modifying the functionality of poly(ethyleneimine) on surface adsorption...|$|R

40|$|The {{detergent}} sodium <b>dodecyl</b> <b>sulfate</b> is {{a well-known}} inducer of irritant contact dermatitis. In this study we show that sodium <b>dodecyl</b> <b>sulfate</b> induces the serine proteinase inhibitor, plasminogen activator inhibitor type 2, in epidermal keratinocytes. The enhancement in plasminogen activator inhibitor type 2 mRNA and antigen is observed both when sodium <b>dodecyl</b> <b>sulfate</b> is applied topically to normal human skin as well as when it {{is added to the}} growth medium of cultured human keratinocytes. In vitro, plasminogen activator inhibitor type 2 mRNA is increased within 4 – 8 h after addition of the detergent, and the increase in plasminogen activator inhibitor type 2 antigen occurs slightly later. The enhancing effect of sodium <b>dodecyl</b> <b>sulfate</b> on plasminogen activator inhibitor type 2 is not related to nonspecific cell lysis nor is it secondary to induction of tumor necrosis factor α. Similarities between our in vitro and in vivo findings lead us to hypothesize that sodium <b>dodecyl</b> <b>sulfate</b> may exert its effect on epidermal plasminogen activator inhibitor type 2 via interaction with the keratinocyte...|$|R

The fimbriae remain associated with the cell envelope of A. bovis, even when sonicated or exposed sequentially to toluene, Triton X- 100, lysozyme, ribonuclease, and deoxyribonuclease. Adhesion of outer membrane-derived cell wall ghosts of A. bovis to glass was inhibited by IO 4 -, sodium <b>dodecyl</b> <b>sulfate,</b> urea, pronase, and trypsin. Protease treatment digested the fimbriae from the distal end, and exposure to sodium <b>dodecyl</b> <b>sulfate</b> depolymerized the fimbriae.

We studied {{the effects of}} resorcinol, phenol, 3, 5 -xylenol, chloroxylenol, and 4 -hexyl-resorcinol on normal human epidermal keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts for cytotoxicity and cytokine release, determined by 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyl tetrazolium bromide methodology and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. An inverse correlation between phenol concentrations causing a 50 % reduction in keratinocyte and fibroblast viability at 24 h and their octanol water-partition coefficients (i. e., hydrophobicity) was observed. 3, 5 -xylenol, chloroxylenol, hexyl-resorcinol, and sodium <b>dodecyl</b> <b>sulfate,</b> but not resorcinol or phenol, induced release of interleukin- 1 α from keratinocytes at cytotoxic concentrations. Variable release of tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin- 8 from keratinocytes occurred only at toxic threshold concentrations of the phenols or sodium <b>dodecyl</b> <b>sulfate.</b> Subtoxic concentrations of phenols or sodium <b>dodecyl</b> <b>sulfate</b> did not induce cytokine release from keratinocytes. Neither the phenols nor sodium <b>dodecyl</b> <b>sulfate</b> induced release of the chemokines interleukin- 8, growth-related oncogene-α or monocyte chemotactic protein- 1 from fibroblasts. Conditioned media from keratinocytes treated with cytotoxic concentrations of 3, 5 -xylenol, chloroxylenol, hexyl-resorcinol, or sodium <b>dodecyl</b> <b>sulfate</b> stimulated further release of the chemokines from fibroblasts above that obtained with control media.
