Although dismissed {{by some as a}} gimmick, these techniques added a personality to her voice and enabled her to fully demonstrate her multi-octave range.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the early}} {{department}} stores were {{more than just a}} retail emporium; rather they were venues where shoppers could spend their leisure time and be entertained. Some department stores offered reading rooms, art galleries and concerts. Most department stores had tea-rooms or dining rooms and offered treatment areas where ladies could <b>indulge</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> manicure. The fashion show, which originated in the US in around 1907, became a staple feature event for many department stores and celebrity appearances were also used to great effect. Themed events featured wares from foreign shores, exposing shoppers to the exotic cultures of the Orient and Middle-East.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{his fame}} as an illustrator, Leyendecker {{was able to}} <b>indulge</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> very luxurious {{lifestyle}} which in many ways embodied the decadence of the Roaring Twenties. However, when commissions began to wane in the 1930s, {{he was forced to}} curtail spending considerably. By the time of his death, Leyendecker had let all of the household staff at his New Rochelle estate go, with he and Beach attempting to maintain the extensive estate themselves. Leyendecker left a tidy estate equally split between his sister and Beach. Leyendecker is buried alongside parents and brother Frank at Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York City. Charles Alwood Beach died in 1954 and is buried in Holy Sepulchre Cemetery, East Orange, New Jersey.|$|E
25|$|The {{purchase}} of lottery tickets cannot {{be accounted for}} by decision models based on expected value maximization. The reason is that lottery tickets cost more than the expected gain, as shown by lottery mathematics, so someone maximizing expected value should not buy lottery tickets. Yet, lottery purchases can be explained by decision models based on expected utility maximization, as the curvature of the utility function can be adjusted to capture risk-seeking behavior. More general models based on utility functions defined on things other than the lottery outcomes can also account for lottery purchase. In addition to the lottery prizes, the ticket may enable some purchasers to experience a thrill and to <b>indulge</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> fantasy of becoming wealthy. If the entertainment value (or other non-monetary value) obtained by playing is high enough for a given individual, then the {{purchase of}} a lottery ticket could represent a gain in overall utility. In such a case, the disutility of a monetary loss could be outweighed by the combined expected utility of monetary and non-monetary gain, thus making the purchase a rational decision for that individual.|$|E

500|$|Army ants forage {{in a wide}} roving column, attacking any {{animals in}} that path that are unable to escape. In Central and South America, Eciton burchellii is the {{swarming}} ant most commonly attended by [...] "ant-following" [...] birds such as antbirds and woodcreepers. This behaviour was once considered mutualistic, but later studies found the birds to be parasitic. Direct kleptoparasitism (birds stealing food from the ants' grasp) is rare and has been noted in Inca doves which pick seeds at nest entrances as they are being transported by species of Pogonomyrmex. Birds that follow ants eat many prey insects and thus decrease the foraging success of ants. Birds <b>indulge</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> peculiar behaviour called anting that, as yet, is not fully understood. Here birds rest on ant nests, or pick and drop ants onto their wings and feathers; {{this may be a}} means to remove ectoparasites from the birds.|$|E

The following day, Nassau and Posen battled Slava, scoring three hits on the Russian ship that forced her to retreat. By 19 August, the Russian minefields had been cleared and the flotilla entered the Gulf. However, reports of Allied submarines in the area prompted the Germans to call off the operation the following day.

By 19 August, the Russian minefields had been cleared and the flotilla entered the Gulf. Reports of Allied submarines in the area prompted the Germans to call off the operation the following day.

2500|$|The film pokes fun at revolutionary {{groups and}} 1970s British left-wing politics. [...] "What the film does do is place modern {{stereotypes}} {{in a historical}} setting, which enables it to <b>indulge</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> number of sharp digs, particularly at trade unionists and guerilla organisations". The groups in the film all oppose the Roman occupation of Judea, but fall into the familiar pattern of intense competition among factions that appears, to an outsider, to be over ideological distinctions so small as to be invisible, thus portraying {{the phenomenon of the}} narcissism of small differences. Michael Palin says that the various separatist movements were modelled on [...] "modern resistance groups, all with obscure acronyms which they can never remember and their conflicting agendas".|$|E
2500|$|MacDonagh {{points out}} {{that none of the}} marriages in Austen's fiction of which she {{approved}} was financially imprudent. For Austen, marriage and children were a girl's natural and best aspiration. She advocated sincere attachment, material prudence and circumspect delay in the choice of a marriage partner. If the appropriate conditions were met, then marriage should follow. Austen realized that women without independent means felt very great pressure to marry someone who could look after them, because otherwise they would be a burden on their families. The marriage market that she describes is quite detailed and well understood by all concerned. For example, as is explained in Mansfield Park, [...] "Miss Maria Ward, 'with only seven thousand pounds', had the good luck to captivate a baronet, 'her uncle, the lawyer, allowed her to be at least three thousand pounds short of any equitable claim to it'. To <b>indulge</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> marriage less lucrative than might have been expected was regarded as 'throwing oneself away', and someone like Mary Crawford, who prided herself on her realism, could not bring herself to do it." ...|$|E
