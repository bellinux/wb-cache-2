40|$|The {{scheme for}} economy of {{electric}} energy during {{the work for}} an example of a <b>grain</b> <b>thrower</b> of the ZME 60 type (Voronezh Region, Semiluki) on grain flows in rural economy is offered. <b>Grain</b> <b>thrower</b> can carry out the following technological operations: loading of grain in vehicles; loading and unloading of grain stores; mechanical shoveling of grain on the open areas; separation of grain with office of light impurity. In the scheme the relay 3 UG 3521 / 22 t (SIEMENS firm) is used. The relay can carry out multipurpose protection of engines and comprises the relay of the maximum current, the relay of the minimum current, a timer and the index relay. Temporary charts of the relay 3 UG 3521 / 22 t are provided in the mode "without preservation" and in the mode with "preservation" for the OVER functions (reaction to growth of current) and the UNDER function (reaction to recession of current). Use of the relay 3 UG 3521 / 22 t allowed to receive protection at long start-up of electric motors, at an overload of electric motors, when idling (for economy of electric energy due to automatic shutdown of the conveyor) and at break or jamming of the conveyor. Besides, in the scheme it is offered the multipurpose relay of tension (the relay of control of phases) for protection of three engines of a <b>grain</b> <b>thrower</b> at not full-phase modes of a power line. The economy of electric energy can be received in case of, for example, the late actions of the operator for timely shutdown of the engine of a self-feed upon transition of a <b>grain</b> <b>thrower</b> to idling. In practice transition of a <b>grain</b> <b>thrower</b> to the mode of idling is quite often possible in process of reduction of amount of the thrown grain on a platform before a <b>grain</b> <b>thrower.</b> In practice transition of a <b>grain</b> <b>thrower</b> to the mode of idling is quite often possible in process of reduction of amount of the thrown grain on a platform before a <b>grain</b> <b>thrower.</b> The offered electric circuit can be used in the <b>grain</b> <b>thrower</b> and grain loaders in temporary warehouses, granaries and open grain flows...|$|E
5000|$|Grain {{undergoes}} {{free fall}} during many handling processes. For example, grain is conveyed {{out of the}} combine and dropped into some other storage device, usually a grain cart or semi. It also undergoes free fall when unloaded into bins or silos. Grain can be damaged from free fall anytime it is dropped into a new storage device. This damage is dependent on many factors such as type of grain, height of travel, contact surfaces, discharge size, and impact angle. As grain drop height increases, so does the amount of mechanical damage incurred due to the impact. For the same distance dropped, the highest percent of breakage will be in maize, followed by soybeans and then wheat. [...] <b>Grain</b> <b>throwers</b> may be used spread grain {{in an attempt to}} reach the full load capacity of a storage space, and can increase damage due to the grain undergoing yet another handling process.|$|R
50|$|Grain {{damage is}} a broad term {{that is used to}} {{describe}} any degradation in the quality of grain. In the current grain trade, this damage can affect price, feed quality, food product quality, and susceptibility to pest contamination. Between the field and the end use, grain may go through any number of handling operations which can each contribute to grain damage. For example, grain might encounter free fall, conveyors, spouts, <b>grain</b> <b>throwers,</b> elevators, hoppers, dryers, and many more. Overall, these handling methods can be evaluated as to what effect they have on the grain. Damaged grain can often be characterized by {{the extent to which it}} reduces storage time. For example, cracked or broken kernels are more susceptible to insect or bacteria as well as chemical degradation. The damage to the actual grain is only one example of losses incurred after harvest. In order to quantify grain damage, one must also understand grain quality. Grain quality is a very broad term and can relate to many topics such as foreign material, chemical compositions, mechanical damage, insect infestations, and many more. These references to quality are highly dependent on the end use of the grain. Certain types of damage may be acceptable to specific industries, whereas others cannot use grain with these issues.|$|R
