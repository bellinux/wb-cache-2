5|$|In June 1903, {{supervised}} by Gabriel Lippmann, Curie was awarded her doctorate from the University of Paris. That month {{the couple were}} invited to the Royal Institution in London to <b>give</b> <b>a</b> <b>speech</b> on radioactivity; being a woman, she was prevented from speaking, and Pierre alone was allowed to. Meanwhile, a new industry began developing, based on radium. The Curies did not patent their discovery and benefited little from this increasingly profitable business.|$|E
5|$|This episode {{revolves}} around Liz Lemon (played by Tina Fey) and Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) {{trying to get}} Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) to make a successful appearance on Late Night with Conan O'Brien, a late night talk show. These attempts are complicated when Tracy has a bad reaction to pills prescribed by Dr. Leo Spaceman and he temporarily goes crazy. Meanwhile, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) is preparing to <b>give</b> <b>a</b> <b>speech</b> at the Waldorf-Astoria.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 12, she {{switched}} to golf, sharing her first set of golf clubs with her sister—Annika got the odd numbered clubs and Charlotta the even—and earned her first handicap of 54. She was so shy as a junior she used to deliberately three-putt {{at the end of}} a tournament to avoid giving the victory speech. The coaches noticed and at the next tournament both the winner and the runner-up had to <b>give</b> <b>a</b> <b>speech.</b> Sörenstam decided that if she were going to have to face the crowd anyway she might as well win and the deliberate misses stopped.|$|E

5|$|One set of deleted scenes charted the Space Exploration Center's {{attempts}} to enlist International Rescue to escort the second Zero-X. Meanwhile, the Hood telepathically contacts his half-brother Kyrano, coercing him to relay the Tracy family's actions. With {{the removal of}} the one scene in which he appears, Kyrano, another character voiced by David Graham, was completely cut from the film. A second deleted scene featured Lady Penelope and Parker en route to Glenn Field via New York, flying on board the aircraft Fireflash which made its first appearance in the pilot episode of Thunderbirds. Another deleted scene saw Jeff Tracy <b>give</b> <b>a</b> <b>speech,</b> broadcast worldwide over the Trans American TV Network.|$|E
5|$|After the Soviets {{took over}} Armenia in 1920, the Armenian American {{community}} {{was divided into}} two camps: one supporting Soviet Armenia (mostly members of the Hunchak and Ramgavar parties), another one against it (mostly made up of ARF members). During the 1933 World's Fair, Leon Tourian, the primate of the Eastern Diocese of the Armenian Apostolic Church of America, refused to <b>give</b> <b>a</b> <b>speech</b> because the Armenian tricolor of the 1918-1920 Republic was hanging behind him, while Etchmiadzin, {{the seat of the}} Catholicos of All Armenians, was in Armenia that was then part of the Soviet Union and used a different flag. This upset the Dashnak members present in the ceremony. The conflict reached a crisis on December 24, 1933, when several members of ARF assassinated Archbishop Tourian during the Christmas Eve service in New York's Holy Cross Armenian Apostolic Church.|$|E
5|$|Before Crisis {{opens with}} the trainee Turks {{on a mission}} {{in the city of}} Midgar to {{investigate}} AVALANCHE activities. With help from Reno, AVALANCHE retreat. However, the attack proves to be a diversion for a greater strike at the town of Junon, where President Shinra is set to <b>give</b> <b>a</b> <b>speech.</b> President Shinra is shot, but survives, and calls in Sephiroth. However, it transpires that even the attack on the President was a diversion, and AVALANCHE's real target was a weapon called the Mako Cannon, which they planned to fire at Midgar, destroying the city. Elfé and Sephiroth do battle at the cannon, but the fight ends inconclusively, and AVALANCHE withdraw. AVALANCHE next target Rayleigh a professor carrying data on the SOLDIER members and their creation. The Turks are sent to protect Rayleigh, accompanied by several Shinra guards, including Cloud. Fuhito, a scientist working for AVALANCHE, is able to corrupt Rayleigh's data when the Turks disobey orders and save Rayleigh instead of protecting the information. Using the SOLDIER data, Fuhito develops an elite unit known as the Ravens, using them to capture two SOLDIERs, Essai and Sebastian. The Turks succeed in rescuing the pair, and are then sent to destroy AVALANCHE, accompanied by Zack. Essai and Sebastian, however, are captured once again, and turned into Ravens. Even though Zack is able to bring them back to their senses, he is unable to save them.|$|E

5|$|Andriamampandry {{tried on}} several {{occasions}} to warn Andriamasinavalona {{of the danger of}} administering the kingdom in this way. In one instance, he placed a hen {{in the middle of a}} room, then set one red rooster free in each corner. The roosters attacked one another viciously, leaving the king speechless. On another day, the elder brought four eagles to the king in a basket. When the basket was opened, the eagles flew wildly about the room, creating havoc. Andriamampandry warned the king that his realm would be no better off once his four sons got a taste of power. Andriamasinavalona recognized the danger but could not bear to choose which among his sons should be excluded from having a part in the decision-making responsibilities of the kingdom, so ignored the elder's advice. Finally Andriamampandry decided to give the king a very explicit warning. Andriamasinavalona had gathered his people in Andohalo to <b>give</b> <b>a</b> <b>speech,</b> when Andriamampandry set a bull loose into the crowd. In the panic that ensued, numerous people were gored or trampled to death, several pregnant women miscarried, and the gathering dispersed in chaos. The king demanded to know who had loosed the bull so that he may be executed, but when Andriamampandry took responsibility he warned the king that yet more blood would be spilled before the earth would be quenched. He then criticized the king for his concern over the relatively few deaths at the gathering, in light of the number of people who would die as a consequence of his division of Imerina. He further predicted that the prince at Ambohimanga would unite Imerina and lead it back to greatness. Andriamasinavalona reportedly had no response to give Andriamampandry, but instead hung his head in shame.|$|E

25|$|In 1970, Nixon {{appeared}} at a Graham revival in East Tennessee, which they thought safe politically. It drew {{one of the}} largest crowds in Tennessee and protesters against the Vietnam War. Nixon was the first president to <b>give</b> <b>a</b> <b>speech</b> from an evangelist's platform. Their friendship became strained in 1973 when Graham rebuked Nixon for his post-Watergate behavior and the profanity heard on the Watergate tapes; they eventually reconciled after Nixon's resignation.|$|E

25|$|During the 1955 general {{election}} campaign, Plummer was embarrassed {{when he turned}} up to <b>give</b> <b>a</b> <b>speech</b> in Hemel Hempstead {{to find that the}} caretaker had not unlocked the hall. A second meeting nearby had been cancelled when only five people turned up. In June 1956 he was taken ill while in the House of Commons, being attended to by Doctor MPs Dr Charles Hill and Dr Barnett Stross. He introduced the Racial Discrimination Bill in 1957, aiming to make discrimination on racial grounds illegal; the Bill was talked out by Conservative MP Ronald Bell.|$|E
25|$|As Richmond {{falls to}} U.S. forces under Daniel MacArthur, Featherston flees to the Hampton Roads area of Virginia to <b>give</b> <b>a</b> <b>speech</b> to {{what remains of}} the Confederate States. After leaving the radio station, he calmly watches Newport News explode, as a U.S. superbomb {{attempting}} to assassinate him goes off. Featherston is annoyed at the display of US power, but takes it in stride, considering it was he who set off the first North American superbomb, that Newport News wasn't nearly as important a target as Philadelphia, and most importantly, he was still alive.|$|E
25|$|Lucas is {{particularly}} {{well known for}} his activism and outspokenness. His criticism of drug use and his sponsorship of public service ad campaigns {{about the dangers of}} unprotected sex in the gay community led Harvey Fierstein to interview him for The Advocate. His New York Blade columns on Ultra-Orthodox Judaism and Islam sparked a campus debate at Stanford University in February 2008 when Lucas was invited to <b>give</b> <b>a</b> <b>speech</b> to students. In 2010 he debated Peter Tatchell and Sue Sanders at England's Oxford University on whether the gay rights movement has undermined family values.|$|E

25|$|In 1992, the Romanian {{government}} allowed Michael {{to return}} to Romania for Easter celebrations, where he drew large crowds. Even though the Romanian government denied his request to <b>give</b> <b>a</b> <b>speech</b> from the Royal Palace (now the National Museum of Art of Romania), his speech from a hotel room drew over a million people to Bucharest to see him. Michael refused the offer {{of the president of}} the National Liberal Party, Radu Câmpeanu, to run for elections as president of Romania. Michael's popularity alarmed the government of President Ion Iliescu, and he was forbidden to visit Romania, being denied entry twice in 1994 and 1995.|$|E
25|$|In season ten, Preston {{is seen to}} {{be living}} in Zürich, where he runs a privately owned cardiothoracic {{research}} hospital. He invited Cristina to the hospital to <b>give</b> <b>a</b> <b>speech</b> on her research. Cristina is both shocked and angered by the sight of Preston, and the former couple exchange bitter sentiments. Cristina claims that the two would never have worked out because she wanted to emulate him, not be by his side. Preston then reveals his ulterior motive for bringing Cristina to Switzerland: to ask her to take over his hospital, which she accepts. He is married to an Italian woman, Edra, and has two daughters, Simone and Vivianna. They {{are on the verge of}} moving to Milan.|$|E
25|$|Later on, Galán's staff {{received}} {{information from}} the Colombian intelligence services advising him of the presence in Bogotá {{of a group of}} hitmen with the intention to kill him. His staff advised him not to travel to the town of Soacha and that the trip to Valledupar was more suitable since he was also scheduled to attend a football match in nearby Barranquilla for a 1990 FIFA World Cup qualification match in which the Colombian team was going to play. At the last moment, Galán changed his mind and ordered his staff to prepare to go to Soacha. Galán was killed as he walked onto the stage to <b>give</b> <b>a</b> <b>speech</b> in front of 10,000 people in Soacha. At least ten others were wounded in the gunfire.|$|E
