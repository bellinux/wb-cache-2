Why don't they all get {{together}} and drive Bully and Mrs. Bully out of the Old Orchard? If they don't I'm afraid he will drive them out. No one likes to live with such quarrelsome neighbors.

5000|$|The {{tone was}} set for the fight. Pryor tried to {{increase}} the tempo, moving more, punching more, hitting Arguello with slashing combinations while Arguello stayed true to his strategy, summarized before the fight as [...] "I don't have to hit him many times in each round, but <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> {{make sure that every}} time I hit him it hurts", waited for counterpunching opportunities and used both his own strength and Pryor's momentum from coming forward to try to make every blow as explosive and painful as possible. In every round each fighter would have their high points, and every round became difficult to score.|$|E
5000|$|Regarding the {{literary}} quality of her works, Arno Schmidt in his authoritative biography of Friedrich de la Motte Fouqué, quotes E. T. A. Hoffmann as follows: [...] "In the afternoon to see Frau Fouqué who bored and displeased me terribly by reading {{from one of}} her very bad novels" [...] (30 January 1815) [...] - [...] followed by a second similarly dimissive statement. Schmidt continues by commenting: [...] "After having read ten of her books <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> agree with him; the best among them are the novels Roderich and the tale Der Delphin, although they do follow well-known models very closely; in addition, some pieces in her books, for example the poems in Frau des Falkenstein, were not written by her but by her husband." ...|$|E

5000|$|In {{the film}} Kiranjit Ahluwalia {{is portrayed as}} a middle class {{homemaker}} instead of a factory worker as she was in reality, Pragna Patel and Rahila Gupta's characters are merged to create one person, played by the Indian actress Nandita Das, and Americanized legal terminology rather than the actual British. The director Jagmohan [...] "Jag" [...] Mundhra in his defense said [...] "Even if you tell a true story, a true story is never really a true story. How do you define the truth? None of us were really there and obviously the recollections {{of people who were}} there have changed now. Ultimately <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> tell an engaging story.

[...] William R. Colby of KillingBoxx.com said that [...] "it isn't nearly as polished as some of Stanze's other films", but that [...] "the effects work is above average and gorehounds will appreciate the fun bloodletting that occurs." [...] Michael Scrutchin of Flipside Movie Emporium gave the film a B+ and said, [...] "This one outshines many of its bigger budgeted peers in terms of pure style and fun. You get all the flesh-eating, throat-ripping, screwdriver-stabbing, chainsaw-roaring entertainment you could possibly want." ...|$|E
50|$|Well I {{developed}} this stand-up persona, and that's {{where it all}} started from. I realised I was getting laughs being a version of me, and that's what {{ended up in the}} sitcom.

[...] But Felix admitted that she would rather have the one gold medal that she was missing. [...] "I would love to trade my three world championships for your gold," [...] Felix jokingly said to Veronica Campbell-Brown of Jamaica at the medalists' news conference. She referred to the 2008 Olympic gold medal in the 200 m, a race Felix was heavily favored to win. She was distressed over finishing second to Campbell-Brown when it happened in Beijing and still obsessed about it a year later. [...] "I don't think I ever want to get over it," [...] Felix said. [...] "I never want to be satisfied with losing."

5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Guitar World in 2011 Fredrik states [...] "My dad always listened to jazz, and I guess that influenced me to learn about improvisation. An improvised solo sounds {{so much better than}} a written one. For me, there's not much thinking going on at all, only a reaction to what I'm being told from the inside. And no, I have not had any formal training. When I record my leads, they are usually based on feel and totally ignorant to all laws of music theory. This, of course, is because I just play whatever comes out. There are no rules. But on certain songs, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> figure out what scales I need to use to follow chord changes. Since I'm not very good with all the scales, I sometimes have to write parts down and plan things ahead. I usually improvise the first part, then insert the written part and continue to improvise {{until the end of the}} solo. It's a very confusing way to do it, but I do whatever it takes to make it sound like I know what I'm doing".|$|E
5000|$|After being {{fourth place}} in top billing {{for the third}} season, Daryl was {{promoted}} to second place in top billing for every season since the fourth, having {{become one of the}} main protagonists of the series. Fans follow the character, and Reedus in other roles. They have debated Daryl's sexual orientation and sexuality, especially with regard to Caryl (Carol and Daryl) and Bethyl (Beth and Daryl) shippers; some fans argue that he is heterosexual, while others argue that he is gay or bisexual. The Walking Dead creator Robert Kirkman stated that Daryl is heterosexual, but that the show has portrayed him as somewhat asexual. [...] "I think that he's a very introverted character and I think that's somewhat his appeal. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> clear something up, though," [...] said Kirkman. [...] "In the Walking Dead letters column in the old comic book that I do, there was a question that made me mention that there was a possibility early on about making Daryl Dixon's character gay and it caused quite a hubbub online.

40|$|Before today, when I {{read the}} {{acknowledgements}} of theses from previous years, I was always shocked.

I don’t think it was until this very moment, when I realized how very many people <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> thank, that I realize how much help I really did need, and am so appreciative {{to all those who}} provided it. So, here goes… First, I want to thank Juj, Hel, Sons, Calvo, the CozyTown anthem, and the memory of Herb, for making the past year one of the best (or the best?) year(s) of my life. I don’t think I’ll ever be cozier. To the dinners and laughs and stupid outfits that made this year fly by. And thank you to Tess and Erica for five hour Usdan dinners, for editing drafts, and for sharing gum, wine, runs, clothes, and philosophical insights. And thank you to Alex, for having unlimited confidence in me and in my ability to do almost anything, which helps me to do at least something.

40|$|I {{have known}} Mdm X for over twenty years. We {{knew each other}} when we worked in a library in Lok Fu Estate as volunteers. The {{voluntary}} service was related with helping in tutorial work and summer services as provided by the library. Mdm X is known {{to me as a}} very enthusiastic, helpful, accountable and mature person, who never declines to offer help whenever she has time and the ability to help. Her help is solid and wholehearted. She is now a teacher in a secondary school. Her childhood was spent in a resettlement estate, namely Wang Tau Hom Resettlement Estate, in the Kowloon Peninsular. Her childhood is typical of the one in resettlement estate. She came from a family of many siblings, a total of 9 in all in hers. Her house was so congested and the basic provisions for living so primitive that I am of the opinion that the situation must have significant influence on her mentality development as well as socialization as she grew up. So, before the interview, I had a pre-meeting with her to discuss about my presumption and the kind of questions that I would like to put to her for answer. She was very kind because she also takes a very keen interest in my project and did a lot of preparation before coming for the recording on 20 th February 2000. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> say that during the interview, Mdm X demonstrated organization and precision in her disclosure of information and her answers to my questions. Her exposition far exceeds my expectation. We had also seen some of her childhood and teenage photographs before the interview. The photographs did help us to focus more sharply on the context of the interview. On the whole, I have a strong feeling that the kind of hardship that Mdm X had gone through in her childhood has a profound positive influence on her mentality development and socialization. She had a warm and loving family, in which every family members maintain a tight link to each others, linkage of which being highly constructive and enduring in nature. Filial piety is also well established. The cause for all these morality development seemingly lies on successful family education which results in Mdm X an early development of goal pursuit in life. It was an enjoyment doing the interview because the happenings in her childhood and the mentality development so seen were highly cheering in nature...|$|E
