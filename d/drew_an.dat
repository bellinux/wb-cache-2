50|$|Since {{the prizes}} {{are exactly the}} same, it follows that you will prefer Gamble A to Gamble B {{if and only if}} you believe that <b>drawing</b> <b>a</b> red ball is more likely than <b>drawing</b> <b>a</b> black ball (according to {{expected}} utility theory). Also, there would be no clear preference between the choices if you thought that a red ball was as likely as a black ball. Similarly it follows that you will prefer Gamble C to Gamble D if, and only if, you believe that <b>drawing</b> <b>a</b> red or yellow ball is more likely than <b>drawing</b> <b>a</b> black or yellow ball. It might seem intuitive that, if <b>drawing</b> <b>a</b> red ball is more likely than <b>drawing</b> <b>a</b> black ball, then <b>drawing</b> <b>a</b> red or yellow ball is also more likely than <b>drawing</b> <b>a</b> black or yellow ball. So, supposing you prefer Gamble A to Gamble B, it follows that you will also prefer Gamble C to Gamble D. And, supposing instead that you prefer Gamble B to Gamble A, it follows that you will also prefer Gamble D to Gamble C.|$|R

5|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} in August 1973 following the tour supporting the previous album, Foxtrot (1972). The group set aside {{a short period of}} time to write new material, which covered a number of themes, including the loss of English folk culture and an increased American influence, which was reflected in the title. Following the album's release, the group set out on tour, where they <b>drew</b> <b>an</b> enthusiastic reception from fans.|$|E

5|$|Attendances at Midland Alliance matches were {{generally}} small, with many matches attracting fewer than 100 spectators. In the 2006–07 season the average attendance across the league was 124, {{but in the}} 2007–08 season this fell to 87. The best supported team in that season was Atherstone Town, whose average home attendance was 162.

5|$|Despite the {{critical}} success, {{the second season}} of Parks and Recreation continued to suffer in the Nielsen ratings. By December 2009, the average episode viewership was 5.3 million households. The average was lower than the other NBC comedy shows that aired Thursday night along with Parks and Recreation: Community <b>drew</b> <b>an</b> average 6.5 million households, 30 Rock an average 7.3 million, and The Office an average 10.1 million. By February 2010, ratings had begun to improve all of NBC's Thursday comedy shows, especially Parks and Recreation, but the network remained in fourth place among the major networks in Nielsen ratings. By {{the end of the}} season, the average viewership for the 24 episodes of season two was 4.68 million, lower than season one's average of 5.45 million households.|$|E
5|$|Flood was They Might Be Giants' first {{release on}} any major label. Elektra Records {{approached}} the band following the unexpected {{success of their}} second album, Lincoln, which was released on the independent Bar/None label. The record deal that Elektra presented was {{largely due to the}} work of Susan <b>Drew,</b> <b>an</b> A worker who had been following the band since 1986. Because of her confidence, the band was given an extensive level of creative control over their projects, in addition to the ability {{to take advantage of the}} label's strategies and resources. Although They Might Be Giants recorded the album as a duo, they were joined by many guest musicians on brass and string instruments. The band also enlisted Alan Bezozi to help program some of the drums for the album.|$|E

50|$|If two {{cards are}} drawn with {{replacement}} from {{a deck of}} cards, the event of <b>drawing</b> <b>a</b> red card on the first trial and that of <b>drawing</b> <b>a</b> red card on the second trial are independent. By contrast, if two cards are drawn without replacement from a deck of cards, the event of <b>drawing</b> <b>a</b> red card on the first trial and that of <b>drawing</b> <b>a</b> red card on the second trial are not independent, because a deck that has had a red card removed has proportionately fewer red cards.|$|R
50|$|For example, it is {{impossible}} to <b>draw</b> <b>a</b> card that is both red and a club because clubs are always black. If just one card is drawn from the deck, either a red card (heart or diamond) or a black card (club or spade) will be <b>drawn.</b> When <b>A</b> and B are mutually exclusive, P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B). To find the probability of <b>drawing</b> <b>a</b> red card or a club, for example, add together the probability of <b>drawing</b> <b>a</b> red card and the probability of <b>drawing</b> <b>a</b> club. In a standard 52-card deck, there are twenty-six red cards and thirteen clubs: 26/52 + 13/52 = 39/52 or 3/4.|$|R
5|$|The July 25, 2008 Arena Mexico show <b>drew</b> <b>an</b> {{estimated}} {{crowd of}} 16,500, which {{was close to}} a sell out for the arena and {{a significant increase in}} attendance compared to the Super Viernes shows in the weeks prior to the Universal Tournament and the Leyenda de Plata finals. SuperLuchas magazine later described the Universal Tournament as a promising sign of what the CMLL/TNA working relationship would bring, but in hindsight also noted that it turned out that those promises were never fulfilled as the two companies stopped working together by the end of 2008.|$|E
5|$|The highest {{attendance}} {{recorded at}} Hampden for a football match was 149,415, for the 1937 British Home Championship tie between Scotland and England.

The European Cup match between Celtic and Leeds United in 1970 was attended by 136,505, which is a UEFA competition record.|$|E
