Upper-middle income countries chose workshops {{as the first}} option, with interviews and <b>expert</b> <b>panels</b> in second place.

Workshops, surveys and interviews were used by countries at all income levels, implying that involvement of {{different points of view}} was common to many FTA efforts in connection with e-Government. This is also consistent with the results of Saritas & Burmaoglu in [103], who found these methods to be among those most frequently combined with other FTA methods.|$|R
30|$|Literature review, brainstorming, <b>expert</b> <b>panels,</b> {{scenario}} workshops, scenario writing, {{and surveys}} cluster together. Some of these methods, such as brainstorming, literature review, and surveys, are usually implemented {{at the beginning}} of the FTA process in order to collect and generate inputs to discuss later [36, 41]. This group also contains participatory methods, i.e. scenario workshop, workshops, citizen and <b>expert</b> <b>panels,</b> which are usually implemented for generating long-term visions using the previous inputs [36, 41]. Thus, this group is formed of methods that could be used across the whole FTA process.|$|R

Following the LTTE's defeat, the Tamil National Alliance, the largest Tamil political party in Sri Lanka, dropped its demand for a separate state in favour of a federal solution. The final stages of the war left some 294,000 people displaced.|$|E

Michael Buxton, a professor at RMIT University, said that after the 1983 Ash Wednesday fires the government bought back tens of thousands of lots across the Dandenong Ranges because they were in extremely high fire risk areas; he backed another similar large-scale buyback scheme to move people away from unacceptably high risk areas.|$|E

As a result of the controversy, on 12 August an <b>expert</b> <b>panel</b> of the WHO endorsed the use of interventions with as-yet-unknown effects for both treatment and prevention of Ebola, and also said that deciding which treatments should be used and how to distribute them equitably were matters that needed further discussion.|$|E

Johnston and Schweig attributed this earthquake to a rupture on the New Madrid North Fault. A minority viewpoint holds that this earthquake's epicenter was in southern Illinois. A 2011 <b>expert</b> <b>panel</b> urged further research to clarify this point, stating that the Illinois hypothesis would mean that an extended section of fault exists, perhaps still loaded and capable of hosting a great earthquake in the future.|$|E
