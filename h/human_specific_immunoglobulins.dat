40|$|Radiolabeled <b>human</b> non <b>specific</b> <b>immunoglobulin</b> G (IgG or HIG) was {{proposed}} in the early nineties as a potential tracer for imaging infection and sterile inflammation. Formulations with ¹¹¹In and (99 m) Tc as the label were developed and extensive preclinical work was undertaken to assess its potential as a diagnostic agent. ¹¹¹In-HIG was used {{in a number of}} clinical studies and proved efficient in detecting orthopedic infections, especially in patients with prostheses, fever of unknown origin, opportunistic infections in immunocompromised patients, including patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus and neutropenic patients. In the latter patients, {{there was no need for}} blood manipulation to harvest white cells for leukocyte labeling which was a considerable advantage.

40|$|By use of pooled <b>human</b> sera, <b>specific</b> {{protective}} <b>immunoglobulins</b> {{against the}} Smith-diffuse strain of Staphylococcus aureus, strains SS- 620 and SS- 619 of types III and II group B streptococci, and strain K- 9 of Klebsiella pneumoniae were successively extracted from their whole cell and antibody complexes by elution with propionic acid containing 5 % sucrose. Injection of 0. 14, 0. 05, 0. 09, and 0. 15 mg of these eluates in mice gave protection against lethal infection only with homologous strains. However, no protective effect was observed against these infections, even with considerably higher amounts {{of a conventional}} immunoglobulin preparation. The major components of the eluates were the three major immunoglobulins, immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgA, and IgM, although nonspecific proteins were also included. Protective activities of these eluates were absorbed out by their protection-inducing antigens, indicating that they contained <b>specific</b> protective <b>immunoglobulins...</b>|$|R

40|$|Recombinant {{immunoglobulins}} comprise {{an important}} class of <b>human</b> therapeutics. Although <b>specific</b> <b>immunoglobulins</b> can be purposefully raised against desired antigen targets by various methods, identifying an immunoglobulin clone that simultaneously possesses potent therapeutic activities and desirable manufacturing-related attributes often {{turns out to}} be challenging. The variable domains of individual immunoglobulins primarily define the unique antigen specificities and binding affinities inherent to each clone. The primary sequence of the variable domains also specifies the unique physicochemical properties that modulate various aspects of individual immunoglobulin life cycle, starting from the biosynthetic steps in the endoplasmic reticulum, secretory pathway trafficking, secretion, and the fate in the extracellular space and in the endosome-lysosome system. Because of the diverse repertoire of immunoglobulin physicochemical properties, some immunoglobulin clones’ intrinsic properties may manifest as intriguing cellular phenotypes, unusual solution behaviors, and serious pathologic outcomes that are of scientific and clinical importance. To gain renewed insights into identifying manufacturable therapeutic antibodies, this paper catalogs important intracellular and extracellular phenotypes induced by various subsets of immunoglobulin clones occupying different niches of diverse physicochemical repertoire space. Both intrinsic and extrinsic factors that make certain immunoglobulin clones desirable or undesirable for large-scale manufacturing and therapeutic use are summarized...|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} {{existence}} of an extracellular staphylococcal product, designated staphylococcal decomplementation antigen (DA), that causes rapid consumption of early-reacting complement components up to and including C 5 in human serum. Complement activation occurs as a consequence of immune complex formation between DA and <b>specific</b> <b>human</b> <b>immunoglobulin</b> G antibodies and proceeds primarily via the classical pathway. The terminal components C 7, C 8, and C 9 are not consumed during the process. Levels of DA production do not correlate with the expression of classical pathogenic factors, such as coagulase, clumping factor, protein A, or alpha-toxin. DA is a nondialyzable macromolecule eluting in a molecular-weight region of 70, 000 to 120, 000 on Sephacryl S- 300 and displaying an apparent sedimentation coefficient of 3 to 4 S on sucrose density gradients. The molecule is remarkably stable and resists destruction upon boiling for 30 min or by treatment with pronase, lysostaphin, DNase, or RNase. We anticipate that DA protects staphylococci from complement attack through induction of abortive, complement-consuming reactions in the fluid phase...|$|R

40|$|A {{circulating}} plasma inhibitor of the "von Willebrand factor" {{was observed}} in a multiply tranfused subject with severe von Willebrand's disease. The platelet-active von Willebrand factor {{is associated with a}} plasma protein macromolecular complex that is deficient in the disease. The inhibitor appears to be an IgG antibody, kappa type, based on neutralization tests with goat antisera to <b>specific</b> <b>human</b> <b>immunoglobulins.</b> The IgG and inhibitor separated out together in plasma fractions obtained by "salting-out" and chromatographic procedures. Two separate inhibitor neutralization tests for the platelet-active factor, one with human plasma and ristocetin, the other with bovine plasma, gave similar results, based on the macroscopic aggregation time test of fixed human platelets. With cryoprecipitate transfusions the inhibitor was transiently neutralized with the temporary appearance of von Willebrand factor, factor VIII, and factor VIII-like antigen in the plasma. The plasma inhibitor level increased after transfusion, suggesting an anamnestic response. Lower titer inhibitor plasmas neutralized only the platelet activity. Highest titer plasma also neutralized human factor VIII, but only in part; it did not neutralize either bovine factor VIII or the human small active factor VIII fragment. The anti-factor VIII activity of the von Willebrand factor inhibitor may be due to steric hindrance, dependent on the spatial relationship of factor VIII sites on the macromolecular complex...|$|R
40|$|Ureaplasma urealyticum {{strains of}} all serotypes express a <b>specific</b> <b>human</b> <b>immunoglobulin</b> Al {{protease}} that cleaves immunoglobulin Al to produce intact Fab and Fc fragments. The {{use of a}} variety of inhibitors suggests that the enzyme is a serine protease. N-terminal sequencing of the Fc digestion product showed that the enzyme cleaves between the proline and threonine residues 235 and 236 in the hinge region of the heavy chain of immunoglobulin Al. Immunoglobulin A (IgA) is the main immunoglobulin present at mucosal surfaces. Several pathogenic organisms, including Ureaplasma urealyticum, in which adhesion to a mucosal surface may be the first step in pathogenesis have been shown to produce human IgAl-specific proteases that cleave IgAl into intact Fab and Fc fragments (8, 9, 14, 16). Generally, these enzymes cleave the heavy chain at proline-threonine or proline-serine bonds within the hinge region (7). In this report we describe initial studies of the IgAl protease of U. urealyticum. Ureaplasma strains of serotypes 1 (T 7), 4 (11860), 6 (12253), and 8 (T 960) were gifts from D.

40|$|The BioElisa Syphilis, a new {{competitive}} {{enzyme immunoassay}} (EIA) for Treponema pallidum whole antigen that uses <b>specific</b> <b>human</b> <b>immunoglobulin</b> G (IgG) antibodies as the competitor, was evaluated for potential use in screening for syphilis at various stages. The results obtained by this competitive EIA {{were compared with}} those obtained by the fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-abs) test and the T. pallidum hemagglutination assay (TPHA). Serum samples from 434 patients with positive TPHA and FTA-abs test results, including patients with primary, latent, secondary, and tertiary syphilis and neurosyphilis, were investigated. Two samples tested negative by competitive EIA but were weakly reactive by the TPHA and the FTA-abs test. Sixteen serum samples from patients with clinically documented active syphilis, including several patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus, tested positive by the competitive EIA. There was a direct inverse correlation between EIA indices and titers in the TPHA and the FTA-abs test for all samples that tested positive. Specificity was assessed by testing 358 serum samples which tested negative for syphilis by TPHA and the FTA-abs test, including 100 serum samples from patients with documented infectious or autoimmune diseases. Only two serum samples gave a weakly positive EIA result. Thus, competitive EIA had a sensitivity of 99. 5 % and a specificity of 99. 4 % relative {{to the results of}} the FTA-abs test and TPHA.
