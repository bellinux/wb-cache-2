In {{the case of}} an option to invest, the investment problem can be formulated before and after taxes, demonstrating the effects of flexibility and irreversibility. A sufficient condition for tax neutrality is the equivalence of the investment problems before and after taxes. Under this condition, neutral depreciation schedules can be derived for every kind of interest taxation without explicitly solving the emerging free-boundary problems. Two special cases of neutral tax systems are the cash flow tax and the Johansson-Samuelson tax. For the validity of the Johansson-Samuelson theorem under uncertainty and irreversibility it is necessary to extend the <b>depreciation</b> <b>base</b> on the real option. ...|$|E

40|$|Background: Several {{accounting}} scandals {{have caused}} a development from rules-based to principles-based regulation. Swedish municipalities follow the principle-based recommendations issued by RKR (The Council for Municipal Accounting). An explicit requirement of component depreciation has been introduced prior to 2014. The principles-based regulatory framework raises some choices regarding the introduction and demands that professional judgments are made. There is some risk that comparability decreases. This risk could be reduced by being inspired by and do similarly to what the previous actors have done. Questions: How do municipalities introduce component <b>depreciation</b> <b>based</b> on the principles-based regulatory framework? What underlying factors affecting the choice {{and what are the}} effects of the transition to component depreciation? Purpose: This study aims to create an understanding of how various municipalities’ behavior is influenced by the limited guidance that principle-based system gives when component depreciation is being introduced. It also seeks to explain the effects of the transition. Method: The study is based on a qualitative approach in which five in-depth interviews were conducted with five different municipalities. The respondents were selected through a targeted selection depending on how far they have come in the change process. Results and conclusion: The study shows that municipalities primarily choose to use component depreciation for new investments, how the old fixed assets should be handled is somewhat unclear. Furthermore, municipalities tend largely to be inspired by and collaborate with each other. Cooperation takes place but in different ways depending on whether it is a large or small community. Small municipalities often collaborate with each other and are inspired by the larger municipalities, while the larger municipalities cooperate with each other and are inspired by the private sector.

40|$|We examine, in a {{simplified}} model without uncertainty, {{the response of}} a regulated firm to inflation {{in the cost of}} capital equipment. This model firm is assumed to be constrained to meet a given demand schedule, and to realize a prescribed rate of return on capital; the firm's revenue requirements include <b>depreciation</b> <b>based</b> on original cost. We explore the steady-state relationships between the firm's financial parameters (rate of return, debt ratio, payout ratio, etc.) and the rate of inflation, which follow by the use of accounting identities from the condition that inelastic demand be met; we also examine the consequences in the steady state of the additional condition that equity investors receive the return they require. We further consider a sudden jump in the rate of inflation, and show that, quite apart from considerations of capital attraction or shareholder satisfaction, this necessitates an increase in the return on capital. We show how, if the firm adjusts to increased inflation only by a gradual increase in its rate of return, holding all other parameters fixed, the necessity of meeting the given demand implies that the old shareholders, who did not foresee an increase in the rate of inflation, will, if regulation is instantaneous and exact, and the required return on equity is earned, receive a real return on their investment which is higher than they anticipated and higher than that received by the new shareholders. This effect {{can be traced to the}} use of original-cost depreciation. We then show how by adjustment of any of several parameters, i. e., the payout ratio, the debt ratio, or the balance between internal and external financing, demand can still be met while all shareholders receive exactly the real return they require. The question of whether, in the real world, such an adjustment is possible or desirable is not explored. ...|$|R

40|$|This Thesis {{describes}} {{an approach to}} the development and testing of a model that can compare construction performance across time, space, and economic system. Labour and capital productivity measures {{as well as the}} multi-factor approach were evaluated. Capital productivity alone, as a 'pure' financial ratio, appears able to deal with the key problems posed by indexation, to deal with inflation for time-series comparisons, and fluctuating currency exchange rates, for international comparisons. The major flaws with traditional capital productivity measures, particularly the problems inherent in valuing the 'capital' employed in a given industry or sector, are discussed and the model is developed to meet the objections. The notion of capital productivity employed in the model, while in computational terms similar to the traditional approach, is different in philosophical terms. Thus instead of than attempting to 'value' the capital employed in the productive process, the cost of capital 'sunk' is valued making allowance for notional <b>depreciation</b> <b>based</b> on the balance of the different types of assets employed. The discount rate emerges by counterpoising the discounted value of anticipated future profits against the historic cost of investment sunk into the current stock of capital goods. There are problems specific to construction, in particular the incidence of off-site prefabrication and plant hire, which tend to make traditional capital productivity largely irrelevant to the construction process. An input-output framework is used to examine the productivity involved in the total building process as opposed to the on-site activities. In addition, the problems of incompatibility across economic systems manifested in such issues as differential rates of indirect taxation etc., is allowed for by adjusting the price levels from market prices to 'eigenprices' an input-output based approach. The resulting model is tested via an inter-industry time-series Case Study of the UK over the period 1948 to 1990 using six broad industrial groupings.

40|$|The present master's thesis {{deals with}} the {{establishment}} of a data system to be used for the assessment and calculation of depreciation of public service infrastructure for drinking water supply. The aim of collecting the funds for the restoration of the infrastructure network is to maintain the standard of supply and ensure the functional capacity of the infrastructure. The draft system to be used for the assessment and calculation of depreciation of public service infrastructure was designed by integrating the data from the cadastre of public service infrastructure and the existing data from the register of fixed assets. As it has been found during the course of writing the present thesis that the two sets of data are not consistent and that the data from the register of fixed assets do not show the real value of infrastructure or that the calculation of <b>depreciation</b> <b>based</b> on such register does not ensure a sufficient amount for the replacement of decrepit fixed assets, it is proposed that the assessment of public utility infrastructure be based on the data from the cadastre of public service infrastructure, which are presumed to be the most detailed and precise aggregated data on public utility infrastructure. It is proposed in the thesis that the purchase value of new infrastructure be assessed based on the data from the cadastre and the reference pricelist. A realistic assessment of the value of drinking water supply infrastructure facilitates the collection of sufficient depreciation funds and realistic pricing of drinking water supply. This in turn facilitates compliance with the requirements of EU directives (Commission Directive 2006 / 111 /EC on the transparency of financial relations between Member States and public undertakings as well as on financial transparency within certain undertakings, Directive 2000 / 60 /EC of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a framework for Community action in the field of water policy) and with the fundamental environmental principles, i. e. the polluterpays principle and the coverage of all costs principle...|$|R

This appears to be a result of a decline in the cost of homeownership relative to renting.

The decline in the cost of owner-occupied housing relative to rental housing is estimated to have sharply increased homeownership.
