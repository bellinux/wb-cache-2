50|$|Many parishes {{nevertheless}} have {{at different}} times opted to issue periodicals produced entirely from within their own community and not including any of the mass-produced <b>insets.</b> Being largely dependent on volunteers, they have often varied their format according to local circumstances, and in some parishes they have seemingly had a rather intermittent existence. Where <b>insets</b> were included, these might often have originated at completely different dates from their cover magazines, or else have been merely the short-term choices of particular local editors. This makes it highly likely that most surviving collections of <b>insets</b> will be incomplete.|$|R
5|$|The photographers in 1999, 2001, 2003 and 2004 were {{respectively}} Antoine Verglas, James Porto, Michael Zeppetello and Steven White for the Swimsuit Issue works.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the {{linearity}} and the change of the time outputting or <b>insetting</b> cylinders from or into a block and chronological age. Concretely, what is the strongest linearity and the most changeful of the following three sorts of time? 1. The time outputting all cylinders from a block. 2. The time <b>insetting</b> all cylinders into a block. These cylinders were put in order before <b>insetting.</b> 3. The time <b>insetting</b> all cylinders into a block. These cylinders were put at random before <b>insetting.</b> In this paper I use the data which appeared in Otoda's paper(1978). Subjects ares twenty-eight normal children, from two years to five years seven months old. In order to examine the linearity I calculate the Pearson's moment correlation coefficient. In order to examine the change I calculate the regression coefficient. In conclusion, the linearity of the time <b>insetting</b> all cylinders which were put at random into a block is the strongest, and its rate of change is the hardest. When the Montessori cylinder block is used as a screening test material for child psychological development, the time <b>insetting</b> all cylinders which were put at random into a block is most useful. Key words: BLOCK, CYLINDER, DEVELOPMENT, MONTESSORI, SCREENING The Montessori cylinder block is an educational tool used in the Montessori method. It is a sort of visual sensory educational tool. A photograph of it is shown in Figure 1. The sort of the cylinder blocks which are shown in Figure 1 is B type(Iwata 1984). This paper is a pilot study to examine the Montessori cylinder block test, to determine whether it can be used as a screening test material for child psychological development...|$|R
5|$|Gedi {{was made}} a {{historic}} monument in 1927. The site was declared a protected monument in 1929, after looters began removing Chinese porcelain <b>inset</b> as architectural decoration. In 1939, the Kenya Public Works Department began restoring structures that were at the greatest risk of collapse. Further site restoration, primarily clearing vegetation overgrowth, was conducted in 1948–1959 by James Kirkman, who was appointed warden of the site after Gedi and the surrounding forest was declared a national park in 1948.|$|E
5|$|The Pipil used wooden weapons {{with stone}} blades. Their weapons {{included}} long spears, atlatls (spear-throwers), arrows, and the macana (a wooden sword with <b>inset</b> obsidian blades {{similar to the}} Aztec macahuitl). These weapons proved inferior to elements of Spanish warfare such as steel, the horse and firearms. The Spanish described how the natives of El Salvador wore thick cotton armour, described as three fingers thick, that extended down {{to their feet and}} significantly encumbered them.|$|E
5|$|Group C lies to the {{southwest}} of Group B and east of Group E. Group C is arranged around two large structures (C1 and C2). It possesses two small plazas; the East Plaza is {{the larger of the}} two, enclosing an area to the east of the main temple, Pyramid C1. The East Plaza was accessed via a narrow alley that ran between a large, low platform and a high-status residential structure with a patio (C8). An <b>inset</b> stairway climbed outside of the retaining wall of Group C and accessed the East Plaza between the high-status residence and a platform to its east. The West Plaza is located behind Platform C2 and is enclosed to the north by three platforms (C9, C10 and C17).|$|E

5|$|Iguanodon teeth are, as {{the name}} suggests, like those of an iguana, but larger. Unlike hadrosaurids, which had columns of {{replacement}} teeth, Iguanodon only had one replacement tooth at a time for each position. The upper jaw held up to 29 teeth per side, with none {{at the front of}} the jaw, and the lower jaw 25; the numbers differ because teeth in the lower jaw are broader than those in the upper. Because the tooth rows are deeply <b>inset</b> from the outside of the jaws, and because of other anatomical details, it is believed that, as with most other ornithischians, Iguanodon had some sort of cheek-like structure, muscular or non-muscular, to retain food in the mouth.|$|E
5|$|Pale Blue Dot, {{which was}} {{taken with the}} narrow-angle camera, was also {{published}} {{as part of a}} composite picture created from a wide-angle camera photograph showing the Sun and the region of space containing the Earth and Venus. The wide-angle image was <b>inset</b> with two narrow-angle pictures: Pale Blue Dot and a similar photograph of Venus. The wide-angle photograph was taken with the darkest filter (a methane absorption band) and the shortest possible exposure (5 milliseconds), to avoid saturating the camera's vidicon tube with scattered sunlight. Even so, the result was a bright burned-out image with multiple reflections from the optics in the camera and the Sun that appears far larger than the actual dimension of the solar disk. The rays around the Sun are a diffraction pattern of the calibration lamp which is mounted in front of the wide-angle lens.|$|E
5|$|Pillars and columns, such as Washington Column and Lost Arrow, {{are created}} by cross joints. Erosion acting on master joints is {{responsible}} for creating valleys and later canyons. The single most erosive force {{over the last few}} million years has been large alpine glaciers, which have turned the previously V-shaped river-cut valleys into U-shaped glacial-cut canyons (such as Yosemite Valley and Hetch Hetchy Valley). Exfoliation (caused by the tendency of crystals in plutonic rocks to expand at the surface) acting on granitic rock with widely spaced joints is responsible for creating domes such as Half Dome and North Dome and <b>inset</b> arches like Royal Arches.|$|E

5|$|Platform B5 {{possesses}} two stepped {{levels with}} cornices and encloses {{the northern part}} of the west side of the Group B plaza. The lower level possesses a single <b>inset</b> stairway, while the upper terrace has two stairways flanked by balustrades, with a third balustrade dividing the two. The platform provides a broad view across the Pancaco River valley to the west. Structure B5 was built on top of an earlier construction phase, which is exposed along the upper portion of the back wall because restoration of the building only rebuilt the lower portion. It was built from stone slabs and was originally taller than the final version of the platform but was cut back to the reduced height of the new building.|$|E
5|$|Spanish {{and native}} tactics and {{technology}} differed greatly. The Spanish viewed {{the taking of}} prisoners as a hindrance to outright victory, whereas the Maya prioritised the capture of live prisoners and of booty. The indigenous peoples of Guatemala lacked key elements of Old World technology such as a functional wheel, horses, iron, steel, and gunpowder; they were also extremely susceptible to Old World diseases, against which they had no resistance. The Maya preferred raiding and ambush to large-scale warfare, using spears, arrows and wooden swords with <b>inset</b> obsidian blades; the Xinca of the southern coastal plain used poison on their arrows. In response {{to the use of}} Spanish cavalry, the highland Maya took to digging pits and lining them with wooden stakes.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish {{conquest of}} El Salvador was the {{campaign}} {{undertaken by the}} Spanish conquistadores against the Late Postclassic Mesoamerican polities in the territory that is now incorporated into the modern Central American nation of El Salvador.

Before the conquest the country formed {{a part of the}} Mesoamerican cultural region, and was inhabited by a number of indigenous peoples, including the Pipil, the Lenca, the Xinca, and Maya.
