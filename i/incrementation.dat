5000|$|Similarly to the {{preceding}} section, the binary number [...] {{of the form}} [...] with [...] 1s equals the skew binary number [...] plus [...] Note that since addition is not defined, adding [...] corresponds to incrementing the number [...] times. However, [...] is bounded by the logarithm of [...] and <b>incrementation</b> takes constant time.

5000|$|The {{advantage}} of skew binary {{is that each}} increment operation {{can be done with}} at most one carry operation. This exploits the fact that [...] Incrementing a skew binary number is done by setting the only two to a zero and incrementing the next digit from zero to one or one to two. When numbers are represented using a form of run-length encoding as linked lists of the non-zero digits, a form called the sparse representations of numbers by Okasaki, <b>incrementation</b> and decrementation can be performed in constant time.|$|E
5000|$|... is a {{theoretically}} interesting idealization of a computer. There {{are several}} variants. In most of them, each register {{can hold a}} natural number (of unlimited size), and the instructions are simple (and few in number), e.g. only decrementation (combined with conditional jump) and <b>incrementation</b> exist (and halting). The lack of the infinite (or dynamically growing) external store (seen at Turing machines) can be understood by replacing its role with Gödel numbering techniques: the fact that each register holds a natural number allows the possibility of representing a complicated thing (e.g. a sequence, or a matrix etc.) by an appropriate huge natural number — unambiguity of both representation and interpretation can be established by number theoretical foundations of these techniques.|$|E

The Chrysler Building was the first building in the world to break the 300 m barrier, and the Empire State Building was the first building to have more than 100 floors. It stands at 381 m and has 102 floors. The next tallest skyscraper was the World Trade Center, which was completed in 1971. The north tower was 417 m and the south 415 m tall. It surpassed the height of the Empire State Building by 36 m. Two years later the Sears Tower was built in Chicago, standing at 442 m with 110 floors, surpassing the height of the World Trade Center by 25 m. The Petronas Towers rose 10 meters above the Sears Tower, standing at a height of 452 m and each having 88 floors.|$|E
50|$|Pascual-Leone {{analyzed}} developmental data {{in terms}} of the task’s constructive complexity. He assessed complexity by number of essential operators, relations, or schemes that children must simultaneously relate to produce a performance. With his analyses he inferred in 1963 that there is a maximum mental demand that each child’s age group can cope with - the characteristic mental (M-) power of each developmental stage-level. Only when the growth of mental power in a child is equal to or larger than the task’s mental demand, can the child reliably solve a task. Today this information is well recognized; but in the nineteen seventies and eighties the idea was not taken seriously. Pascual-Leone was the first to claim, via his task analyses, that the true organismic stages were in fact the sub-stages of Piaget. Recently Arsalidou, Pascual-Leone, Johnson, Morris, & Taylor have produced data suggesting that these levels of functioning may be expressed in adults by <b>incrementation</b> of brain activity in the executive (prefrontal lobes, etc.) network.|$|E
5000|$|All 2-operand 8-bit {{arithmetic}} {{and logical}} (ALU) operations {{work on the}} 8-bit accumulator (the A register). For two-operand 8-bit operations, the other operand can be either an immediate value, another 8-bit register, or a memory cell addressed by the 16-bit register pair HL. The only 8-bit ALU operations that can have a destination other than the accumulator are the unary <b>incrementation</b> or decrementation instructions, which can operate on any 8-bit register or on memory addressed by HL, as for two-operand 8-bit operations. Direct copying is supported between any two 8-bit registers and between any 8-bit register and a HL-addressed memory cell, using the MOV instruction. An immediate value can also be moved {{into any of the}} foregoing destinations, using the MVI instruction. Due to the regular encoding of the MOV instruction (using nearly a quarter of the entire opcode space) there are redundant codes to copy a register into itself (MOV B,B, for instance), which are of little use, except for delays. However, what would have been a copy from the HL-addressed cell into itself (i.e., MOV M,M) instead encodes the HLT instruction, halting execution until an external reset or unmasked interrupt occurs.|$|E
40|$|Observing the {{existing}} {{relationships between the}} elementary operations of addition, multiplication (iteration of additions) and exponentiation (iteration of multiplications), a new operation (named <b>incrementation)</b> is defined, consistently with these laws and such that addition {{turns out to be}} an iteration of incrementations. <b>Incrementation</b> turns out to be consistent with Ackermann's function. After defining the inverse operation of <b>incrementation</b> (named decrementation), we observe that R is not closed under it. So a new set of numbers is defined (named E, Escherian numbers), such that decrementation is closed on it. After defining the concept of pseudoorder (analogous to the order, but not transitive), it is shown that Escherian numbers are not transitive. Then addition and multiplication on E are analysed, and a correspondence between E and C is found. Finally, <b>incrementation</b> is extended to C, {{in such a way that}} decrementation is closed on C too.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of gender on the <b>incrementation</b> of {{language}} change through an examination of TH-fronting in Hastings, southeast England. Research into <b>incrementation</b> to date has shown that children show lower rates of innovative forms than adolescents. As a conse-quence, when children {{are added to the}} view of language change in apparent time it creates what Labov (2001) labels an ‘adolescent peak’. Although there is already strong empirical support for the model, there is a discrepancy with regards to how gender impacts on the process. While Labov (2001) observes peaks only across the trajectory of the gender leading the change, Tagliamonte & D’Arcy (2009) find adolescent peaks for both genders. This begs an important question: do both males and females participate equally in <b>incrementation,</b> or is it only the gender leading the change? Previous conclusions are limited {{by the fact that the}} evidence comes from female-led changes. The present study contributes to this question through analysis of change across an age-stratified sample of speakers which extends to include the age groups necessary to test this hypothesis: a child (8 - 10 years) and an adolescent (16 - 18 years) cohort. Moreover, through an investigation of TH-fronting, a male-led change, this paper presents original perspective on the relationship between gender and <b>incrementation.</b> This provides an important piece of the puzzle and further tests the universality of this model...|$|E

40|$|Adolescent peaks {{have been}} {{observed}} {{across a range of}} different types of language change (Labov 2001, Tagliamonte and D’Arcy 2009). However, while Labov (2001) finds that peaks are only present in the gender leading the change in phonetic variables, Tagliamonte and D’Arcy (2009) find no gender asymmetry in morphosyntactic and discourse-pragmatic changes. This paper contributes to this issue through an apparent time investigation of TH-fronting in southeast England. Crucially, this is a male-led change, thus presents an ideal opportunity to further investigate the relationship between gender and <b>incrementation.</b> While the results provide further support for the claim that an adolescent peak is a “general requirement of change in progress” (Labov 2001 : 455), the details of this analysis contribute further understanding of how this process interacts with a form’s embedding within the wider sociolinguistic system.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an investigation into the geometrically nonlinear behaviour of circular arches. A curved element is used, based on satisfying the condition that the circumferential strain and change in curvature, rather than the displacements, should be simple independent functions of the co-ordinate axes. The analysis was carried out using the linearized incremental method based on the mid-increment stiffness in conjunction with the Newton-Raphson iterative technique. A comparison is first made between the results obtained with this element and those using a simple polynomial shape function. The behaviour of a range of arches is then considered and the results are compared and found to agree well with an analytical method. The results include the behaviour of deeper but still shallow arches which exhibit “looping” of the load-deflexion curve, and bifurcation of the equilibrium path into unsymmetric deflexions of the arch. A computer program was developed to allow any of the generalized degrees of freedom which are designated for <b>incrementation</b> to be expressed as either forces, to avoid failure at the vertical tangent to the load deflexion curves, or as generalized displacements to avoid failure at the horizontal tangent. The program also allows the quantity subjected to <b>incrementation</b> to be changed as necessary to follow complex load-deflexion equilibrium paths. <br/...|$|E
