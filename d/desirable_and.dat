5|$|Though most provinces {{were capable}} of {{producing}} wine, regional varietals were <b>desirable</b> <b>and</b> wine was a central item of trade. Shortages of vin ordinaire were rare. The major suppliers {{for the city of}} Rome were the west coast of Italy, southern Gaul, the Tarraconensis region of Hispania, and Crete. Alexandria, the second-largest city, imported wine from Laodicea in Syria and the Aegean. At the retail level, taverns or speciality wine shops (vinaria) sold wine by the jug for carryout and by the drink on premises, with price ranges reflecting quality.|$|E
5|$|As freshmen {{struggled}} with the Athenian curriculum, he reverted to classification by academic discipline and offered companion texts {{in the field of}} the current work studied. In their dorms, the college students were known for their lack of respect for property, with three times the breakage in dorm assets {{than the rest of the}} university. Meiklejohn saw this as <b>desirable</b> <b>and</b> indicative of abetting nonconformity, and did not attempt to curb it. Meiklejohn had full reign over the college, so the university and its disciplinary proceedings could not intervene. Upon their exit two years later, students transferred to a number of Ivy League and prominent state universities. By this time, the college was known throughout the nation and Europe.|$|E
5|$|Moreover, as the {{industrial}} revolution took hold and the prevalence of manual labour declined, there were increasing concerns that British men would become unfit and undisciplined; images of sport and combat were thought to motivate the viewer to aspire to an ideal of physical strength which people were worried was becoming lost. Wrestling and boxing thus were popular subjects for artworks, and Etty had produced other paintings and sketches of men engaged in fights {{of one kind or}} another. It had become common for artists to use boxers and soldiers as models, as they had the strength and bearing considered <b>desirable,</b> <b>and</b> the discipline to hold a pose for long periods in the studio.|$|E

So far, a number of UDEA(DEA in present undesirable factors) models have been developed: The UCCR, UBCC models and the UFDH model are well known as basic UDEA model. In this paper, we suggest a model call generalized UDEA(UGDEA) model,which can treat the above stated basic DEA models in a unified way. In addition,by establishing the theoretical properties on relationship among the UGDEA model and those UDEA models, we prove that the UGDEA model make it possi-ble to calculate the efficiency of DMU incorporating various preference structures of decision makers...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Department of Mathematics, Washington State UniversityThis {{dissertation}} develops {{procedures for}} super fair division that use marks {{to reduce the}} number of cuts required for super fair division when compared to all known existing procedures that use marks or can be modified to use marks. Further, our procedures work for the division of <b>desirables,</b> <b>and</b> undesirable, and with entitlements. We further show that for 2 players, at most 3 cuts are required for a super fair division, and we develop a procedure that requires at most 3 cuts for both <b>desirables</b> <b>and</b> undesirable, and with entitlements. For n players, we provide the first known proof that at least n+ 1 cuts are required for a super fair division, and develop a procedure that requires only 2 n+ 3 cuts, which, to our knowledge, is vast improvement on all known n player procedures. Lastly, we prove that for one of our procedures, the number of cuts required is a function of the number of distinct measures. For the case that there are only 2 distinct measures, the number of cuts achieves the minimum bound of n+ 1. Department of Mathematics, Washington State Universit...|$|R
