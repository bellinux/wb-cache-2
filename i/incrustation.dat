60|$|The great {{accumulation}} of loose calcareous particles, {{lying on the}} beach near the Settlement, commences {{in the month of}} October, moving towards the S.W., which, as I was informed by Lieutenant Evans, is caused by a change in the prevailing direction of the currents. At this period the tidal rocks, at the S.W. end of the beach, where the calcareous sand is accumulating, and round which the currents sweep, become gradually coated with a calcareous <b>incrustation,</b> half an inch in thickness. It is quite white, compact, with some parts slightly spathose, and is firmly attached to the rock. After a short time it gradually disappears, being either redissolved, when the water is less charged with lime, or more probably is mechanically abraded. Lieutenant Evans has observed these facts, during the six years he has resided at Ascension. The <b>incrustation</b> varies in thickness in different years: in 1831 it was unusually thick. When I was there in July, there was no remnant of the incrustation; but on a point of basalt, from which the quarrymen had lately removed a mass of the calcareous freestone, the <b>incrustation</b> was perfectly preserved. Considering the position of the tidal-rocks, and the period at which they become coated, {{there can be no doubt}} that the movement and disturbance of the vast {{accumulation of}} calcareous particles, many of them being partially agglutinated together, cause the waves of the sea to be so highly charged with carbonate of lime, that they deposit it on the first objects against which they impinge. I have been informed by Lieutenant Holland, R.N., that this <b>incrustation</b> is formed on many parts of the coast, on most of which, I believe, there are likewise great masses of comminuted shells.|$|E

40|$|The {{formation}} of <b>incrustations</b> on {{public water supply}} well screens reduces their performance considerably. The <b>incrustations</b> increase hydraulic losses, reduce {{the capacity of the}} well and screen, affect the quality of the pumped water and increase maintenance costs. In alluvial environments, the most common deposits are iron and manganese hydroxides. However, the rates of formation, compositions and levels of crystallization vary, depending on the geochemical characteristics of the alluvial environment, the microbiological characteristics of the groundwater and the abstraction method. Samples of 15 <b>incrustations</b> were collected from wells that tap shallow alluvial aquifers and were found to be dominated by iron. XRD analyses detected low-crystalline ferrihydrite and manganese hydroxide in the samples collected from the water supply source at Trnovče (Velika Morava alluvial). The <b>incrustations</b> from the Belgrade Groundwater Source revealed the presence of ferrihydrite and a substantial amount of goethite α-FeOOH. Apart from goethite, greigite (Fe 3 S 4) was detected in three samples, while one sample additionally contained bernalite Fe(OH) 3 and monoclinic sulfur S 8. Among carbonates, only siderite was detected.

6000|$|The {{rocks of}} St. Paul appear from a {{distance}} of a brilliantly white colour. This is partly owing to the dung of a vast multitude of seafowl, and partly to a coating of a hard glossy substance with a pearly lustre, which is intimately united {{to the surface of the}} rocks. This, when examined with a lens, is found to consist of numerous exceedingly thin layers, its total thickness being about the tenth of an inch. It contains much animal matter, and its origin, no doubt, is due to the action of the rain or spray on the birds' dung. Below some small masses of guano at Ascension, and on the Abrolhos Islets, I found certain stalactitic branching bodies, formed apparently in the same manner as the thin white coating on these rocks. The branching bodies so closely resembled in general appearance certain nulliporae (a family of hard calcareous sea-plants), that in lately looking hastily over my collection I did not perceive the difference. The globular extremities of the branches are of a pearly texture, like the enamel of teeth, but so hard as just to scratch plate-glass. I may here mention, that on a part of the coast of Ascension, where there is a vast accumulation of shelly sand, an <b>incrustation</b> is deposited on the tidal rocks, by the water of the sea, resembling, as represented in Plate 4, certain cryptogamic plants (Marchantiae) often seen on damp walls. The surface of the fronds is beautifully glossy; and those parts formed where fully exposed to the light, are of a jet black colour, but those shaded under ledges are only grey. I have shown specimens of this <b>incrustation</b> to several geologists, and they all thought that they were of volcanic or igneous origin! In its hardness and translucency--in its polish, equal to that of the finest oliva-shell--in the bad smell given out, and loss of colour under the blowpipe--it shows a close similarity with living sea-shells. Moreover in sea-shells, it is known that the parts habitually covered and shaded by the mantle of the animal, are of a paler colour than those fully exposed to the light, just as is the case with this <b>incrustation.</b> When we remember that lime, either as a phosphate or carbonate, enters into the composition of the hard parts, such as bones and shells, of all living animals, it is an interesting physiological fact to find substances harder than the enamel of teeth, and coloured surfaces as well polished as those of a fresh shell, re-formed through inorganic means from dead organic matter--mocking, also, in shape, some of the lower vegetable productions. (1/6. Mr. Horner and Sir David Brewster have described ("Philosophical Transactions" [...] 1836 page 65) a singular [...] "artificial substance resembling shell." [...] It is deposited in fine, transparent, highly polished, brown-coloured laminae, possessing peculiar optical properties, on the inside of a vessel, in which cloth, first prepared with glue and then with lime, is made to revolve rapidly in water. It is much softer, more transparent, and contains more animal matter, than the natural <b>incrustation</b> at Ascension; but we here again see the strong tendency which carbonate of lime and animal matter evince to form a solid substance allied to shell.) ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In 1994 for {{the first}} time massive <b>incrustations</b> in the {{centrifuges}} treating the digested sludge were detected in some wastewater treatment plants (WWTP’s) of the Berliner Wasserbetriebe, which were, as was found out later, mainly due to the precipitation of white MAP (magnesium ammonium phosphate = struvite) deposits with small portions of different calcium phosphate compounds. Obviously, the wastewater purification process used, with enhanced biological phosphorus removal and concentrated streams of digesting sludge, favours the formation of <b>incrustations</b> during sludge treatment. These <b>incrustations</b> were the cause of a lot of operational problems. To prevent <b>incrustations,</b> modifications in the process engineering technology have been applied after several studies and trials. Deliberate extraction of the CO 2, e. g. by air injection through a fine-bubble surface aeration system {{at the bottom of the}} digested sludge storage tank just before the centrifuges, causes the pH to rise to approx. 8 and results in induced struvite precipitation. This technology enables a precipitation product suitable for recycling. In general several processes for further separation of the MAP from the digested sludge are considered. First trials were carried out using hydro-cyclones. A subsequent second hydro-cyclone stage allowed a further increase in the P-concentration to approx. 40 kg/m, giving a yield of phosphorus of 20 %. This corresponds with P-load of approx. 316 kg/day and amounts to 18 % of the P inlet load in the WWTP Waßmannsdorf. To recovery the separated precipitated MAP, particularly from the digested sludge...|$|R

60|$|The saline <b>incrustations,</b> near Bahia Blanca, are not {{confined}} to, though most abundant on, the low muddy flats; for I noticed some on a calcareous plain between thirty and forty {{feet above the}} sea, and even a little occurs in still higher valleys. Low alluvial tracts in the valleys of the Rivers Negro and Colorado are also encrusted, and in the latter valley such spaces appeared to be occasionally overflowed by the river. I observed saline <b>incrustations</b> {{in some of the}} valleys of Southern Patagonia. At Port Desire a low, flat, muddy valley was thickly incrusted by salts, which on analysis by Mr. T. Reeks, are found to consist of a mixture of sulphate and muriate of soda, with carbonate of lime and earthy matter. On the western side of the continent, the southern coasts are much too humid for this phenomenon; but in Northern Chile I again met with similar <b>incrustations.</b> On the hardened mud, in parts of the broad, flat-bottomed valley of Copiapo, the saline matter encrusts the ground to the thickness of some inches: specimens, sent by Mr. Bingley to Apothecaries' Hall for analysis, were said to consist of carbonate and sulphate of soda. Much sulphate of soda is found in the desert of Atacama. In all parts of South America, the saline <b>incrustations</b> occur most frequently on low damp surfaces of mud, where the climate is rather dry; and these low surfaces have, in almost every case, been upraised above the level of the sea, within the recent period.|$|R
