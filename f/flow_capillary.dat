40|$|Microreactor {{technology}} {{is an important}} method of process intensification. Liquid-liquid slug <b>flow</b> <b>capillary</b> microreactor {{has been used to}} intensify the mass transfer limited and strongly exothermic reactions. In this type of reactor, either two liquids flow alternate to each other in a capillary or one liquid flows as a continuous flow while other flows in the form of enclosed drops (slugs) depending on the interfacial tension between two liquids and liquid adhesion with the solid walls. The enhanced mass transfer is due to the internal circulations within the slugs which arise due to shearing action between the slug axis and the capillary wall or continuous phase. The slug size and the intensity of internal circulations depend on the type of mixing element and physical properties of the liquids. The proper understanding of physical behaviour of fluids at the microscale is a challenging issue for the growing microreactor application demands. This paper highlights the hydrodynamic characteristics of the liquid-liquid slug <b>flow</b> <b>capillary</b> microreactor.

In the present study we address whether CEU measurement of capillary volume is influenced by bulk flow and if measured capillary filling rate allows discrimination of different flow pattern changes within muscle. Three in vitro models were used: (i) bulk flow rate was varied within a single length of capillary tubing; (ii) at constant bulk <b>flow,</b> <b>capillary</b> volume was increased 3 -fold by joining lengths of capillary in series, and compared to a single length; and (iii) at constant bulk <b>flow,</b> <b>capillary</b> volume was increased by sharing flow between a number of lengths of identical capillaries in parallel. The contrast medium for CEU was gas-filled albumin microbubbles. Pulsing interval (time) versus acoustic–intensity curves were constructed and from these, capillary volume and capillary filling rate were calculated. CEU estimates of capillary volume were not affected by changes in bulk flow. Furthermore, as CEU estimates of capillary volume increased, measures of capillary filling rate decreased, regardless of whether capillaries were connected in series or parallel. Therefore, CEU can detect a change in filling rate of the microvascular volume under measurement, but it {{can not be used to}} discriminate between different flow patterns within muscle that might account for capillary recruitment in vivo...|$|E
