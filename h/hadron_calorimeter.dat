40|$|One serious {{challenge}} for <b>hadron</b> <b>calorimeters</b> is setting the absolute calibration. Electromagnetic calorimeters in a magnetic spectrometer have {{the momentum of}} electrons to calibrate against. In addition, at hadron colliders, Z supplies a narrow resonance to determine calibrations. No such well-measured processes have been available {{in the past for}} <b>hadron</b> <b>calorimeters.</b> In high energy collisions, high Pt hadrons are not normally isolated, rather appearing as part of jets. Contamination of the energy scale by unmeasured neutrals or by leakage from adjacent particles is always a concern. There are low cross section processes that possess jets of well understood energy, for example a high pt Z recoiling off of a single jet. The high energy and luminosity of the LHC may supply enough of these events for quantities useful for calibration. In this paper we outline the possibility for doing in situ calibration using Z recoiling off of a jet events, and {ital t{anti t}} events. We also comment on the more conventional possibilities of using muons and energy-flow to calibrate...|$|R

A magnetic field of 1.5 Tesla was created by a superconducting coil 6.4 m long and 5.3 m in diameter.

50|$|In late 1977 the Queen Mary {{group led}} by Peter Kalmus, along with the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory group under Alan Astbury and the Birmingham University {{group led by}} John Dowell joined Carlo Rubbia in the {{international}} collaboration known as UA1 at CERN. The UK groups involved had joint responsibility for designing, building and operating a large <b>hadron</b> <b>calorimeter</b> and also a trigger processor {{as part of the}} UA1 collaboration. The calorimeter, which measured the energies of strongly-interacting particles emerging from collisions, consisted of 7,000 sheets of plastic scintillator with a total mass of 30 tonnes placed in slots in the return yoke of a large electromagnet. Testing of the scintillator sheets was carried out at Queen Mary using cosmic rays. The scintillator light was transferred via fluorescent wavelength-shifter bars and light guides to 2000 photomultipliers outside the magnet. The number of proton-antiproton collisions exceeded the ability to record these by a factor of at least 1000. This necessitated the design of a trigger processor, a purpose-built electronic device which had to make decisions within 2 microseconds on which 1 in 1000 collisions was likely to be worth recording on magnetic tape for subsequent analysis, and which 999 could be discarded irretrievably. Some years later when the collision rate had increased, a new trigger processor was built.|$|E
