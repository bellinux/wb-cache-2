40|$|Abstract: Globally, {{populations of}} {{diadromous}} anguilliform fish, such as eel and lamprey, have experienced substantial declines, {{partly as a}} result of habitat fragmentation caused by river infrastructure. In the UK, a new configuration of bristle pass (sidemounted and vertically oriented) has been developed to help upstream moving European eel (Anguilla anguilla) negotiate low-head structural barriers such as gauging weirs. However, the efficiency of this type of anguilliform pass remains untested, despite regional implementation and recommendation of nationwide deployment in England and Wales. This study investigated the behaviour of <b>European</b> eel and <b>river</b> <b>lamprey</b> (Lampetra fluviatilis) as they attempted to pass an unmodified (control), or modified (treatment - with bristle passes installed) Crump weir, under experimental conditions. The experiment was repeated under three hydraulic regimes (low, medium and high velocity) that represent a range of conditions frequently encountered at Crump weirs in the field. Passage and delay were quantified and the influence of hydraulic regime and treatment assessed. Both species were highly motivated to explore their surroundings and move upstream during the trials. Bristle passes helped <b>European</b> eel and <b>river</b> <b>lamprey</b> pass the Crump weir, although interspecific variation in efficiency was evident. Passage metrics and behavioral reasons for interspecific differences are presented and discussed, as is the need for further research on design optimisation...|$|R

40|$|AbstractFrom March 1989 until May 1995 overall 675 hauls were {{performed}} using a commercial stow net vessel {{to get information}} concerning spatial and seasonal distribution, length frequency distribution, stock situation and migration patterns of lampreys in the Elbe estuary in northern Germany. 2217 <b>river</b> <b>lampreys</b> (Lampetra fluviatilis) and 10 sea lampreys (Petromyzon marinus) were caught during the whole study period. The <b>river</b> <b>lamprey</b> occurred in 40. 3 % of the performed stow net hauls. The catch success was highest in the western main channel, whereas the frequency of occurrence of <b>river</b> <b>lampreys</b> was only about 10. 9 % at the most upstream site in the southern marginal area. In 1989 and 1990 significantly more than 50 % of the hauls contained <b>river</b> <b>lampreys.</b> In contrast, from 1991 to 1995 their frequency of occurrence was lower than 40 %, in 1991 even lower than 20 %. Sea lampreys occurred only at 6 from 9 sampled sites and were only observed in 1990 and 1992 – 1994. Total lengths of <b>river</b> <b>lampreys</b> varied between 7 and 46 cm. Based on the length frequency distribution, the following three size classes of <b>river</b> <b>lampreys</b> were separated: LF I (7 to 16 cm), LF II (17 – 26 cm) and LF III (27 – 46 cm). The majority of the caught individuals could be grouped in size class LF III. Total lengths of sea lampreys ranged between 69 and 85 cm and were restricted to only one size class (PM III). 70 % of all sea lampreys were caught in April and May. Most of the sea lampreys were observed in the eastern main channel. The maximum average abundance of <b>river</b> <b>lampreys</b> was observed with 6. 75 Ind · m− 3 · 10 − 6 {{in the same area}} in 1992. However, in 1993 and 1994 the highest average abundances of <b>river</b> <b>lampreys</b> occurred in the western main channel. Based on redundance analysis, a significant correlation between the abundances of lampreys and the environmental variables autumn, spring, summer, salinity, water temperature, grain size, new moon and first moon quarter was found. The downstream migrating <b>river</b> <b>lampreys</b> of size class LF I und the sea lampreys during their anadromous spawning migration showed highest abundances mainly in spring, whereas high abundances of <b>river</b> <b>lampreys</b> of size class LF II in the feeding phase occurred in summer. The presence of both size classes LF I and LF II confirms the successful reproduction of <b>river</b> <b>lampreys</b> in the catchment area of the Elbe.

40|$|The {{stability}} of a discrete body size dimorphism of sexually mature <b>river</b> <b>lamprey</b> Lampetra fluviatilis from the River Endrick, Scotland, was examined over a 21 year period. Stable isotope {{analysis was used}} to test the hypothesis that the two size forms comprise individuals with differing migration and parasitic foraging strategies. Maturing <b>river</b> <b>lamprey</b> and the brook lamprey Lampetra planeri were trapped over 3 months each year in the periods 1983 – 1984 and 2004 – 2005. Brook lamprey catches and catches of both species combined showed no significant trend in catch rate with time. The catch rate of small body size <b>river</b> <b>lamprey</b> declined between 1983 – 1984 and 2004 – 2005 (although the difference did not reach statistical significance; P = 0 · 055). In contrast, there was {{a significant increase in the}} catch rate of the large body size <b>river</b> <b>lamprey</b> and as a consequence, a significant change in the relative proportion of each of the two <b>river</b> <b>lamprey</b> morphs over the study period. Analysis of the stable isotopes of C and N in muscle tissue showed that brook lamprey tissue derived its carbon from a freshwater source and had a δ 13 C more consistent with that of the River Endrick than with Loch Lomond. δ 15 N values for this species showed it to be feeding at the base of the food chain, consistent with filter feeding as an ammocoete. The large body size and the small body size <b>river</b> <b>lamprey</b> adults differed substantially in their δ 13 C values, with the small body size δ 13 C signature indicative of a freshwater carbon source and the large body size morph of a marine source. The small body size morph had a δ 13 C signature that was consistent with that of Loch Lomond powan Coregonus lavaretus suggesting that they share a common carbon source. The large body size morph was clearly feeding at a higher trophic level than the small body size morph. A single small body size <b>river</b> <b>lamprey</b> individual with typical morphology for that group, however, had C and N signatures that clustered with those of the large body size morphs. This individual had either migrated to sea to forage, as is typical for the species, or had been feeding on an anadromous fish with a strong marine C signature in fresh water. It is concluded that the body size dimorphism is indicative of a differential migration and foraging strategy in the parasitic phase of the life cycle of <b>river</b> <b>lamprey</b> at this site...|$|R

40|$|Globally, {{populations of}} {{diadromous}} anguilliform morphotype fish, such as eel and lamprey, have experienced substantial declines, {{partly as a}} result of habitat fragmentation caused by river infrastructure. In the UK, a new configuration of hydraulically unobtrusive bristle pass (side-mounted and vertically oriented) has been developed to help upstream moving European eel (Anguilla anguilla) negotiate gauging weirs. The efficacy of vertically oriented bristle passes remains untested, despite their potential as a low-cost low-maintenance solution to improve habitat connectivity at low-head structural barriers worldwide. This study assessed the ability of small (82 – 320 mm) and large (322 – 660 mm) European eel and adult (291 – 401 mm) <b>river</b> <b>lamprey</b> (Lampetra fluviatilis) to pass upstream over an experimental Crump weir installed in a large open-channel flume with (treatment) and without (control) side-mounted vertically oriented bristle passes under three different hydraulic regimes. Both species were highly motivated to explore their surroundings and move upstream during the trials. Under flooded control conditions, passage efficiency (the total number of times fish passed the structure as a percentage of total attempts) and passage success (the number of fish that passed the structure as a percentage of those that attempted) were high, delay was short, and number of failed attempts before passage was low for both species. When difference in head was at its greatest (230 mm) and velocity and its variation downstream were high (maximum u and ?: 2. 43 ms? 1 and 0. 66 ms? 1, respectively), the upstream movement of small eel and lamprey was blocked, and passage efficiency and success for large eel low (4. 6 % and 17. 2 %, respectively). For large eel that successfully passed, delay was long, and number of failed attempts before upstream passage was high. When bristle passes were installed, passage efficiency for small (91. 5 %) and large eel (56. 7 %), and passage success for large eel (76. 5 %) and lamprey (36. 7 %) was higher, while delay and the number of attempts before passage was lower for both species.

The presence of VHSV was confirmed by immunofluorescent antibody technique (IFAT), ELISA and RT-PCR. Phylogenetic analysis based on the full-length VHSV glycoprotein (G) gene sequence revealed that the isolates were most closely related to the VHSV strain isolated in 1996 from herring Clupea harengus and sprat Sprattus sprattus in the Eastern Gotland Basin of the Baltic Sea, and were therefore assigned to VHSV genotype II. The partial G gene sequences obtained (nt 1 to 672 – 1129) of all 5 lamprey VHSV isolates were identical, and so were the entire G genes (nt 1 to 1524) of 2 isolates sequenced.
