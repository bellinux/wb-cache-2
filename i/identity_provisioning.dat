40|$|Within {{health and}} social care {{there is a strong}} need to provide access to highly {{sensitive}} information, and one which requires high levels of identity assurance. This paper outlines a joint project between Edinburgh Napier University and miiCard [10], and which aims to provide trusted identities in order to support both the access to health records, and also support the requirements to share information across domains. It provides an overview of some of the key issues involved in proving identity within the access to health care records, and also the proposed framework, safi. re, that is being used in the joint project. The paper also includes the results from a survey on the attitudes to the access to electronic health records, and shows that users in the survey often require high-levels of assurance in the <b>identity</b> <b>provision</b> that is used in health record access. A key finding is that users mostly prefer to use an <b>identity</b> <b>provision</b> method that they control, along with one which has high levels of assurance, and this re-enforces the viewpoint that LOA (Level of Assurance) 3 + should be used to control the access for public access to electronic patient records. The paper outlines the differing levels of assurance and proposes that LOA 3 +should be the minimum requirement for health record access for citizens...|$|R

40|$|On the Internet large service {{providers}} tend {{to control the}} digital identities of users. These defacto identity authorities wield significant power over users, compelling them to comply with non-negotiable terms, before access to services is granted. In doing so, users expose themselves to privacy risks, manipulation and exploitation via direct marketing. Against this backdrop, the emerging areas of Digital Ecosystems and user-centric identity emphasise decentralised environments with independent self-determining entities that control their own data and identity. We show that recent advances in user-centric identity, federated identity and trust have prepared the ground for decentralised <b>identity</b> <b>provisioning.</b> We show how social trust, rather than blind deference to authorities, can {{provide a basis for}} identity, where risks can be weighed and compared rather than merely accepted. Fundamentally, we are considering the move from authority-centric centralised <b>identity</b> <b>provisioning</b> to user-centric distributed <b>identity</b> <b>provisioning.</b> Finally, we highlight the potential impacts of distributed <b>identity</b> <b>provisioning</b> in the Information Society and give a brief roadmap for its general implementation and adoption.

But, as the Economist (2015) rightly points out, blockchain technology has far-reaching applications beyond cryptocurrencies and payments. In fact, blockchain-based organizing and the resulting DAOs {{have the ability to}} replace centralized intermediaries in other applications requiring complex coordination such as asset ownership tracking, trade financing, digital <b>identity</b> <b>provision,</b> supply chain traceability, and more. Besides, in the last 3  years, more than 50 new ventures received seed funding using blockchain-powered “initial coin offerings”, thereby bypassing, at least partly, the use of venture capitalist intermediaries to obtain funding faster and at more favorable valuations (e.g., in 2014, Ethereum raised $ 18.4 million in a few days and is now valued at $ 34 billion). DAOs are on the rise, and it is an exciting time for management and organizational scholars to address this emerging phenomenon with new theory and solid empirical research.|$|R

40|$|The {{entities}} {{participating in}} a context-aware service platform need to establish and manage trust relationships in order to assert different trust aspects including <b>identity</b> <b>provisioning,</b> privacy enforcement, and context information provisioning. Current trust management models address these trust aspects individually {{when in fact they}} are dependent on each other. In this paper we identify and analyze the trust relationships in a context-aware service platform and propose an integrated trust management model that supports quantification of trust for different trust aspects. Our model addresses a set of trust aspects that is relevant for our target context-aware service platform and is extensible with other trust aspects. We propose to calculate a resulting trust value for context-aware services, which considers the dependencies between the different trust aspects, and aims to support the users in the selection of the more trustworthy services. In this calculation we target two types of user goals: one with high priority in privacy enforcement (privacy concerned) and one with high priority in the service adaptation (service concerned).

30|$|User {{centricity}} is {{an important}} identity management feature which emphasizes on transferring the control of identity attributes and disclosure preferences {{in the hands of}} identity possessor (CSC). In a user-centric IDMS, CSCs are involved in every <b>identity</b> <b>provisioning</b> operation and have full control over their online identity information (Dhamija and Dusseault [2008]; Leskinen [2012]; Windley [2005]). CSCs are responsible for the management of their identity credentials; however, user-centric systems have problems in terms of security and privacy. Following are the mechanisms through which identity management systems provide user centricity to the Cloud service consumers. Consistent User Experience: Identity management systems are required to offer support to various technologies (e.g. OpenID, SAML, OAuth) run by multiple IdPs to ensure the interoperability among various systems (Cameron [2005]; Celesti et al. [2010]; Chowdhury and Noll [2007]; Ranchal et al. [2010]). An IDMS that supports interoperability among various identity management systems (by either offering support to multiple technologies or by following common schema for the exchange of identity credentials) help to ensure consistent user experience while accessing multiple services. Self-service: Identity management systems are required to provide a self-service feature that enables the user to alter his sensitive personal information stored by the Cloud service providers (such as postal address, phone number, password etc.) (Ates et al. [2011]; Choudhury et al. [2011]; Luo et al. [2009]). Users must be allowed to modify/update their personal identification information that uniquely identifies them in an IDMS. It also reduces the SP’s operational costs and troubleshooting time.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Data {{protection}} {{is important for}} all information systems that deal with human-subjects data. Grid-based systems – such as the cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid (caBIG) – seek to develop new mechanisms to facilitate real-time federation of cancer-relevant data sources, including sources protected {{under a variety of}} regulatory laws, such as HIPAA and 21 CFR 11. These systems embody new models for data sharing, and hence pose new challenges to the regulatory community, and to those who would develop or adopt them. These challenges must be understood by both systems developers and system adopters. In this paper, we describe our work collecting policy statements, expectations, and requirements from regulatory decision makers at academic cancer centers in the United States. We use these statements to examine fundamental assumptions regarding data sharing using data federations and grid computing. Methods An interview-based study of key stakeholders from a sample of US cancer centers. Interviews were structured, and used an instrument that was developed {{for the purpose of this}} study. The instrument included a set of problem scenarios – difficult policy situations that were derived during a full-day discussion of potentially problematic issues by a set of project participants with diverse expertise. Each problem scenario included a set of open-ended questions that were designed to elucidate stakeholder opinions and concerns. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and used for both qualitative and quantitative analysis. For quantitative analysis, data was aggregated at the individual or institutional unit of analysis, depending on the specific interview question. Results Thirty-one (31) individuals at six cancer centers were contacted to participate. Twenty-four out of thirty-one (24 / 31) individuals responded to our request- yielding a total response rate of 77 %. Respondents included IRB directors and policy-makers, privacy and security officers, directors of offices of research, information security officers and university legal counsel. Nineteen total interviews were conducted over a period of 16 weeks. Respondents provided answers for all four scenarios (a total of 87 questions). Results were grouped by broad themes, including among others: governance, legal and financial issues, partnership agreements, de-identification, institutional technical infrastructure for security and privacy protection, training, risk management, auditing, IRB issues, and patient/subject consent. Conclusion The findings suggest that with additional work, large scale federated sharing of data within a regulated environment is possible. A key challenge is developing suitable models for authentication and authorization practices within a federated environment. Authentication – the recognition and validation of a person's identity – is in fact a global property of such systems, while authorization – the permission to access data or resources – mimics data sharing agreements in being best served at a local level. Nine specific recommendations result from the work and are discussed in detail. These include: (1) the necessity to construct separate legal or corporate entities for governance of federated sharing initiatives on this scale; (2) consensus on the treatment of foreign and commercial partnerships; (3) the development of risk models and risk management processes; (4) development of technical infrastructure to support the credentialing process associated with research including human subjects; (5) exploring the feasibility of developing large-scale, federated honest broker approaches; (6) the development of suitable, federated <b>identity</b> <b>provisioning</b> processes to support federated authentication and authorization; (7) community development of requisite HIPAA and research ethics training modules by federation members; (8) the recognition of the need for central auditing requirements and authority, and; (9) use of two-protocol data exchange models where possible in the federation. </p...|$|E

25|$|As {{with most}} European standards, {{compliance}} by the member {{countries of the}} European Union is purely voluntary, and to be determined {{at the level of}} the member country, usually by means of legislation, or by its own standards organization. To illustrate, this standard, which has been accepted by the United Kingdom, is known locally as BS EN 1789:2007, with the 'BS' referring to British Standards. As a result, the adoption of this standard has varied considerably from one country to another. Most countries, for example, have adopted the sections dealing with vehicle design and performance, while only a few (the UK, Ireland, and Sweden at this writing), have fully adopted the colour, warning system, and livery schemes for such vehicles. To further complicate matters, some countries have adopted some portion of the visual identity standards, but not all. In the Netherlands, Belgium, and some parts of Germany, the conversion to the basic identifying colour (yellow) is occurring, but the balance of visual <b>identity</b> <b>provisions</b> are not. In addition, some countries which are not currently members of the European Union, such as Norway are adopting some portions of the standards, primarily because few other good standards exist for this purpose, particularly those that reflect European realities. The rate and degree of compliance with the standard is a conscious choice by individual countries, while in others, compliance is a matter of the priorities for the changing of older, country specific, legislation. As previously stated, compliance with the standard is purely voluntary. There are no untoward financial implications to compliance, since only ambulances purchased after ratification of the standard by each country are required to be compliant. There is no mandatory provision for the retrofitting of existing ambulances.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a theoretical discussion of meaning creation in general, and interpretive functions of English adjectives in particular. The discussion {{rests on a}} dynamic view of meaning and interpretation, according to {{which there are no}} fixed linguistics meanings – not even for single lexemes. Instead of symbolising meaning in a more or less static and ‘eternal’ fashion, linguistic items are assumed to effect the creation of meaning and to shape meaning dynamically in the particular communicative event at hand, from some kind of underlying ‘raw material’ (also referred to as purport and schemas). It is suggested that the interpretive functions of linguistic items – that is the effects that such items have in the creation of meaning – may be approached in two main ways, namely from the formal and from the semantic point of view respectively. Effects triggered by the form of a certain item are referred to as formal interpretive functions (FIFs), and effects prompted by the meaning created for the form are referred to as semantic interpretive functions (SIFs). FIFs are claimed to be the same for all items – namely to activate, delimit and shape underlying purport and schemas – whereas SIFs are said to differ between items, and also for one and the same item on different occasions of use. It is furthermore suggested that FIFs affect the creation of meaning for the relevant item itself, whereas SIFs affect the creation of meaning for other items, on any level of conceptual organisation. For instance, a form such as tall typically activates and delimits purport and schemas to do with some kind of extension (notably in space), thereby shaping a basic word meaning tall. The meaning thus created may in turn affect other meaning in the larger context. For instance, tall, as created in default interpretation of a tall man entered the room, affects the meaning of the noun phrase a tall man as a whole, in that it specifies the interpreter’s conception of a certain something that entered a specific room. In this case, the relevant SIF is thus to specify. Other SIFs suggested for adjectives are kind identification, element identification, <b>identity</b> <b>provision</b> and stipulation. The aim of the thesis is two-fold: on the one hand to outline a suggestive theory of meaning creation and interpretive function in general, and, on the other hand, to present a theoretical discussion of adjective functions in particular, with the ultimate goal of providing a general framework from which more specific models for in-depth empirical research can be obtained. ...|$|R

The attacker intends to subvert the integrity of peer vehicle communications by launching Sybil attacks. The attack has captured a certain number of legitimate identities (or keys) belonging to other vehicles. Such an attack model is practical, powerful, and has not been considered yet in related literature [1 – 6]. For example, a malicious parent could easily steal identities of multiple members of their family that have <b>identities</b> already <b>provisioned.</b> Clearly with more sharing of vehicles today (e.g., rental cars and car pools), the feasibility of skimming attacks in vehicles (or in related hardware) to steal identities is even more practical. With multiple legitimate identities in hand, the potency of an attacker is much higher. The mobile nature of vehicular networks makes detection of such identity thefts quite difficult in practice. It is assumed that the attacker will utilize all its Sybil identities to attack the network in an attempt subvert the network integrity.
