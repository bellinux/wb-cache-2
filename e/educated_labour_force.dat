40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} knowledge assets - technological and human capital - on the regional productivity levels within a Cobb-Douglas production function model, which includes the traditional tangible inputs, {{as well as other}} territorial and industrial features of the regions. Spatial panel econometric techniques are applied to account for geographical association and to examine the role of knowledge spillovers from the neighbouring regions. We apply our empirical model to a large set of regions belonging to the EU 27 plus Norway and Switzerland over the period 2000 - 2008. Our main results, robust to a wide array of sensitivity checks, show that both knowledge assets exert a positive impact on GDP, with human capital being more effective than technological capital in most cases. Moreover, we find evidence of spatial spillovers directly associated with the two knowledge assets, which turn out to have a larger effect in the regions of the 12 new accession countries. These results underline the central role played by highly <b>educated</b> <b>labour</b> <b>forces</b> in allowing a region to absorb the potential knowledge spilling from the external territories, especially in developing countries, and to ensure its effective use in the production process.

40|$|Regional competitiveness, {{especially}} in the industrialised countries, is increasingly reliant {{on the availability of}} an adequate endowment of knowledge assets at the local level, like technological and human capital. These intangible factors enhance regional efficiency directly as inputs of the production function, but they also {{play a crucial role in}} allowing the territory to absorb the potential knowledge spillovers from the neighbouring regions. The aim of this paper is to analyse the role of the internal and external factors in determining the productivity level for a large set of regions belonging to the EU 27 plus Norway and Switzerland. We estimate a Cobb-Douglas production function over the period 2000 - 2008 where, in addition to the traditional inputs of physical capital and units of labour, we consider innovation activities and human capital endowments as relevant knowledge assets. We also control for other geographical and industrial features of the regions. In order to take into account the commonly found geographic association across regions, our analysis is carried out within the spatial panel econometric framework. Main results, robust to a wide array of sensitivity checks, show that knowledge assets exhibit positive and significant coefficients and the impact of human capital on GDP is higher than the one found for technological capital in most of the estimated empirical models. Moreover, we find evidence of spatial spillovers directly associated with the two immaterial assets, which turn out to be much more effective in the regions of the 12 new accession countries with respect to all other European regions. The significant presence of such spillovers emphasizes the important role played by highly <b>educated</b> <b>labour</b> <b>forces</b> in increasing the regions’ absorptive capacity of new external knowledge and in ensuring its effective use in the production process.

40|$|International {{literature}} {{indicates that}} the prevalence of HIV/AIDS is disproportionately high in South Africa, and that HIV/AIDS should be addressed along with other STDs and TB. Construction is traditionally reliant on labour and is a transient process. The reliance on a poorly <b>educated</b> transient <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> makes the industry particularly susceptible to the dynamics, spread and impact of HIV/AIDS, STDs and TB. The susceptibility is exacerbated by the socio-economic conditions most workers are exposed to. The combating of HIV/AIDS, STDs and TB requires a multistakeholder approach encapsulating interventong other: clients; communities; contractors; government; industry associations; media; tertiary institutions, and unions. The need therefore is amplified by the possible percentage {{decrease in the number}} of healthy active workers in the industry as a result of, primarily HIV/AIDS, and the impact thereof.

40|$|In industrialized economies, {{unemployment}} rates are {{inversely related to}} education levels. Data from 1963 to 1994 show that Israel is an anomaly exhibiting an inverted U-shaped relationship. Workers with 9 - 12 years of schooling experienced {{the highest level of}} unemployment, in contrast to the 0 - 8 and 13 years of schooling groups that consistently had lower rates. Multivariate regression analysis of data for Israel, from 1976 - 1994, indicates that the inverted U-shaped relationship is moderating. The national unemployment rate and a time trend variable had positive and significant effects tending to strengthen the inverted U-shape relationship. However, an increase in the unemployment rate within the 0 - 8 -education group relative to the 9 - 12 group and a decline in the <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> participation rate of the 0 - 8 group, overrode these factors, producing a move toward flattening the inverse relationship. The major factor responsible for the anomaly in the education-unemployment relationship in Israel appears {{to be the result of}} government policies intended to protect low-educated immigrants with large families.

30|$|An {{adequately}} <b>educated</b> {{and trained}} <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> {{is essential for}} economic growth. Education and training raise the productivity of workers and create capacity to innovate and adopt new technologies. Conversely, shortages of educated and skilled workers, or workers with education and skills that do not match labour market needs, lower the potential for growth and may raise unemployment. However, translating ‘adequate’ into concrete education and training policies is a challenging task, not least because jobs are continuously changing. Structural change, technological change, globalization and trade have a bearing on the tasks and duties performed in our economies, which are to an important extent reflected in differential changes in job growth across occupations. These changes in the occupational structure, by implication, affect the economy-wide requirements in terms of education and skills of workers. Furthermore, various imperfections in labour markets give rise to skills mismatch, and this issue has risen on policy agendas because of the skills-intensive nature of much economic and technological change, {{as well as the}} impact of the economic crisis (Cedefop 2010; European Commission 2012; World Economic Forum 2014).|$|R

40|$|This paper builds upon {{previous}} research on ethnic penalties in European labour markets by studying unemployment among higher <b>educated</b> non-western immigrant <b>labour</b> market entrants. By doing so, we attempt {{to get a better}} understanding of the extent to which one of the most advantaged immigrant groups still faces significant barriers in their search for work. We discuss to what extent structural-, institutional-, and socio-cultural characteristics of countries are able to explain cross-national variation in these inequalities between natives and non-western immigrants. Drawing upon pooled cross-section data from the European <b>Labour</b> <b>Force</b> Surveys (2005 - 2011), we test our hypotheses using a two-step multilevel method. Our analyses demonstrate that, first of all, higher <b>educated</b> non-western immigrant <b>labour</b> market entrants are more likely to be unemployed than their native counterparts. Second, we find that a higher percentage of foreigners in a country is positively associated with higher inequalities between immigrants and natives. However, in contrast to our expectation, governmental attempts to stimulate the integration of non-western immigrants are related to larger inequalities between non-western immigrants and natives among higher <b>educated</b> <b>labour</b> market entrants. Finally, we find inconclusive effects with regard to a country’s immigration history...|$|R
