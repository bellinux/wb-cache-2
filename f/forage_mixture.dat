40|$|Intensive farming {{focusing}} on monoculture grass species to maximise forage production {{has led to}} a reduction in the extent and diversity of species-rich grasslands. However, plant communities with higher species number (richness) are a potential strategy for more sustainable production and mitigation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Research has indicated the need to understand opportunities that <b>forage</b> <b>mixtures</b> can offer sustainable ruminant production systems. The objective of the two experiments reported here were to evaluate multiple species <b>forage</b> <b>mixtures</b> in comparison to ryegrass-dominant pasture, when conserved or grazed, on digestion, energy utilisation, N excretion, and methane emissions by growing 10 – 15 month old heifers. Experiment 1 was a 4 × 4 Latin square design with five week periods. Four forage treatments of: (1) ryegrass (control); permanent pasture with perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne); (2) clover; a ryegrass:red clover (Trifolium pratense) mixture; (3) trefoil; a ryegrass:birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus) mixture; and (4) flowers; a ryegrass:wild flower mixture of predominately sorrel (Rumex acetosa), ox-eye daisy (Leucanthemum vulgare), yarrow (Achillea millefolium), knapweed (Centaurea nigra) and ribwort plantain (Plantago lanceolata), were fed as haylages to four dairy heifers. Measurements included digestibility, N excretion, and energy utilisation (including methane emissions measured in respiration chambers). Experiment 2 used 12 different dairy heifers grazing three of the same forage treatments used to make haylage in experiment 1 (ryegrass, clover and flowers) and methane emissions were estimated using the sulphur hexafluoride (SF 6) tracer technique. Distribution of ryegrass to other species (dry matter (DM) basis) was approximately 70 : 30 (clover), 80 : 20 (trefoil), and 40 : 60 (flowers) for experiment 1. During the first and second grazing rotations (respectively) in experiment 2, perennial ryegrass accounted for 95 and 98 % of DM in ryegrass, and 84 and 52 % of DM in clover, with red clover accounting for almost all of the remainder. In the flowers mixture, perennial ryegrass was 52 % of the DM in the first grazing rotation and only 30 % in the second, with a variety of other flower species occupying the remainder. Across both experiments, compared to the <b>forage</b> <b>mixtures</b> (clover, trefoil and flowers), ryegrass had a higher crude protein (CP) content (P < 0. 001, 187 vs. 115 g kg − 1 DM) and DM intake (P < 0. 05, 9. 0 vs. 8. 1 kg day − 1). Heifers in experiment 1 fed ryegrass, compared to the <b>forage</b> <b>mixtures,</b> had greater total tract digestibility (g kg − 1) of DM (DMD; P < 0. 008, 713 vs. 641) and CP (CPD, P < 0. 001, 699 vs. 475), and used more intake energy (%) for body tissue deposition (P < 0. 05, 2. 6 vs. − 4. 9). For both experiments, heifers fed flowers differed the most compared to the ryegrass control for a number of measurements. Compared to ryegrass, flowers had 40 % lower CP content (P < 0. 001, 113 vs. 187 g kg − 1), 18 % lower DMD (P < 0. 01, 585 vs. 713 g kg − 1), 42 % lower CPD (P < 0. 001, 407 vs. 699 g kg − 1), and 10 % lower methane yield (P < 0. 05, 22. 6 vs. 25. 1 g kg − 1 DM intake). This study has shown inclusion of flowers in <b>forage</b> <b>mixtures</b> resulted in a lower CP concentration, digestibility and intake. These differences were due in part to sward management and maturity at harvest.

Four dietary treatments, comprising ad libitum access to 1 of 4 <b>forage</b> <b>mixtures</b> plus a standard allowance of 4 kg/d dairy concentrates, were offered. The 4 <b>forage</b> <b>mixtures</b> were, on a dry matter (DM) basis: (1) 100 % grass silage, (2) 66 % grass silage: 34 % red clover silage, (3) 34 % grass silage: 66 % red clover silage, and (4) 100 % red clover silage. In each of 4 experimental periods, there were 21 days for adaptation to diets and 7 days for measurements. There {{was an increase in}} both DM intakes and milk yields as the proportion of red clover in the diet increased. However, the increase in milk yield was not as great as the increase in DM intake, so that the efficiency of milk production, in terms of yield (kg) of milk per kg of DM intake, decreased. The concentrations of protein, milk fat, and the shorter chain saturated fatty acids decreased, whereas C 18 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and long-chain PUFA (C 20 +) increased as the proportion of red clover in the diet increased. There was little effect of dietary treatment on the organoleptic qualities of milk as assessed by taste panel analysis. There were no effects on the aroma of milk, on aftertaste, or overall liking of the milk. Milk was thicker and creamier in color when cows were fed grass silage compared with red clover silage. The flavor of milk was largely unaffected by dietary treatment. In conclusion, increasing the proportion of red clover in the diet of dairy cows increased feed intakes and milk yields, decreased the concentration of fat and protein in milk, increased PUFA for healthiness, and had little effect on milk organoleptic characteristics.

We used the Integrated Farm System Model (IFSM) to examine the short- (2 -yr) and long-term (25 -yr) performance and economic returns of four pasture mixtures (two, three, five, and seven species of grasses and legumes) and grass monocultures grazed according to plant morphology or canopy height criteria. For both 2 - and 25 -yr analyses, reduced pasture production in the morphology-based grazing strategy led to a decrease in net return compared to the height-based grazing strategy. Both analyses showed that the differences in net return were mainly due to seed, fertilizer, and feed costs, pasture production, and the income from excess forage sales. Production was more dependable for the height-based grazing strategy compared with the morphology-based strategy. Complex mixtures generated greater and more consistent net returns compared with either the simple mixtures or grass monoculture. More importantly, when comparing the difference in net return obtained by a particular forage treatment in dry and wet years, the net return using complex mixtures was reduced by only 25 to 27 %. On the other hand, reductions in net return ranged from 36 % for a three-species mixture to 55 % for grass monoculture. For dairy pastures, complex mixtures are a useful alternative to reduce production variability in dry years...|$|E
40|$|In North Vietnam, during winter, {{shortage}} of herbage constrains {{the profitability of}} dairy farming. The first objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the potential of alternative temperate (C 3) forage species, namely common oat (Avena sativa L.), lop-sided oat (Avena strigosa Schreb.), Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum L.) and a commercial <b>forage</b> <b>mixture</b> (Avex), to address the {{shortage of}} herbage during winter in the mountain regions of North Vietnam. The second objective was to measure the effects of cultural practices (sowing rate, harvest interval and irrigation level) on yield of dry matter (DM), chemical composition, digestibility of DM and metabolizable energy (ME) concentration of herbage from the best adapted C 3 species previously tested (lop-sided oat). Four experiments were conducted. Oat species proved to be the best adapted species and produced the highest annual yield of herbage (7600 kg DM ha) 1) with a high nutritive value. Yields of DM of lop-sided oat were not affected by sowing rate of seed but increased as the length of harvest intervals increased from 30 to 45 and 60 d (P < 0 Æ 001). Crude protein concentration, digestibility ofDMand ME concentration decreased as the harvest interval increased (P < 0 Æ 01). Irrigation increased the yields of DM of lop-sided oats by 1 Æ 3 (P < 0 Æ 05) but had no effect on the nutritive value of herbage. It is concluded that both common oat and lopsided oat are suitable species to provide herbage in the winter for the mountain regions of North Vietnam. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Alfalfa is {{the most}} {{important}} forage plant in our country. It is mainly grown as pure crop for livestock nutrition, although it gives very good results when grown in mixture with other plant species. By growing in mixtures many advantages are achieved, the most important are: possibility for alfalfa to be used in grazing and reduced need for fertilization of grassland. In two year trial (2003 - 2004), changes in botanical composition of alfalfa mixtures depending on the present species in the mixture, i. e. their competitive abilities and fertilization with N, were monitored. Investigations showed that by ageing of crops the share of grasses increases and share of legumes and weeds decreases. Fertilization showed positive effect on strengthening of competitive abilities of grass in relation to leguminous species and increased share of weeds in <b>forage</b> <b>mixtures.</b> Key words: grass-leguminous mixtures, botanical composition, N fertilizatio...|$|R
40|$|There is {{evidence}} that multispecies swards can increase biomass productivity and provide number of ecosystem benefits. However, little is known regarding the possible interactions between forage species that can modulate positively or negatively the use of nutrients by ruminants. The objective {{of this study was}} to provide a better understanding of the associative effects between some forage species on intake and digestion parameters. Three sheep feeding experiments were conducted according to a repeated Latin square design using models of simple <b>forage</b> <b>mixtures</b> under the form of fresh forage or silage, and during which intake behaviour, DM digestibility, and methane emissions were measured. Synergies between cocksfoot silage and red clover silage, and between ryegrass and chicory, were observed on DM intake and eating rate, with optimums for the proportion 50 : 50. For the cocksfoot-red clover association, the synergy was also observed on daily intake of the digestible fraction that can reflect animal performances. No associative effect was observed on methane yield and the lowest emissions were observed for pure red clover and pure chicor...|$|R

Co-localization of {{quantitative}} trait loci for foliar disease resistance in sorghum. Plant Breeding, 128, (5), 532 - 535. Twenty-four multiparous Holstein-Friesian dairy cows {{were used in}} a replicated 4 x 4 Latin square changeover design experiment to test the effects of changing from ryegrass (Lolium perenne) silage to red clover (Trifolium pratense) silage in graded proportions on feed intakes, milk production, milk organoleptic qualities, and whole-body nitrogen partitioning. Four dietary treatments, comprising ad libitum access to 1 of 4 <b>forage</b> <b>mixtures</b> plus a standard allowance of 4 kg/d dairy concentrates, were offered. The 4 <b>forage</b> <b>mixtures</b> were, on a dry matter (DM) basis: 1) 100 % grass silage, 2) 66 % grass silage: 34 % red clover silage, 3) 34 % grass silage: 66 % red clover silage, and 4) 100 % red clover silage. In each of 4 experimental periods, there were 21 d for adaptation to diets and 7 d for measurements. There {{was an increase in}} both DM intakes and milk yields as the proportion of red clover in the diet increased. However, the increase in milk yield was not as great as the increase in DM intake, so that the efficiency of milk production, in terms of yield (kg) of milk per kg of DM intake, decreased. The concentrations of protein, milk fat, and the shorter chain saturated fatty acids decreased, whereas C 18 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and long-chain PUFA (C 20 +) increased as the proportion of red clover in the diet increased. There was little effect of dietary treatment on the organoleptic qualities of milk as assessed by taste panel analysis. There were no effects on the aroma of milk, on aftertaste, or overall liking of the milk. Milk was thicker and creamier in color when cows were fed grass silage compared with red clover silage. The flavor of milk was largely unaffected by dietary treatment. In conclusion, increasing the proportion of red clover in the diet of dairy cows increased feed intakes and milk yields, decreased the concentration of fat and protein in milk, increased PUFA for healthiness, and had little effect on milk organoleptic characteristics.

40|$|Abstract: Investigation {{was carried}} out on 500 Arbor Acres and Redbro {{chickens}}. First group of 30 male and female chickens per genotype was slaughtered after 12 h period of food deprivation. Second group remained in the facility and was fattened until 50. day. Third group was reared for 50 days but in a semi intensive system, with use of 20 m and free range area of 1 m/bird. Nutrition was based on mixture of ground corn, barley, vitmain mineral additive and 30 % of complete <b>forage</b> <b>mixture.</b> All chickens, subsequent to finished fattening period (50 days) were weighed and after 12 h food deprivation period were slaughtered. Arbor Acres chickens {{at the age of}} 42 days had lower mortality (3. 80 %), better feed conversion (1. 868) and higher realized value of production index (206. 73) compared to Redbro chickens. Chickens reared in the facility have realized considerably higher body mass (1820. 33 g) compared to free range chickens (1667. 50 g). Chickens at the age of 50 days had higher carcass yield comapred to chcikens at the age of 42 days. Carcass yields "traditional processing " and "ready to roast " were considerably higher in chickens at the age of 50 days (83. 53 and 76. 59) compared to carcass yields of chickens at the age of 42 days (82. 61 and 75. 68). Chickens reared in the facility (chicken coop) (83. 86) had higher carcass yields "traditional processing " than free range chickens.

40|$|In many European countries, the {{abandonment}} of traditional practices in the last decades produced remarkable effects on agricultural land use. In marginal mountain lands, {{one of the most}} evident outcomes is the reduction of the surfaces occupied by open habitats, mostly represented by meadows and pastures. The ecological consequences of reduced grazing in the pastures concerned not only the vegetation structure but also the floristic composition and the biodiversity of the herbaceous component, which is modified by the progressive establishment of woody species. For these reasons, it is important to carry out specific programs of habitat improvements in order to restore and maintain herbaceous vegetation, both for faunistic purposes and biodiversity conservation. In this note we describe the effectiveness of agronomical intervention carried out to enhance pasture quality in a protected area, once grazed by domestic animals, now utilised exclusively by wild fauna. The study was carried out for five years in a Regional Park (Parco Regionale dei Laghi di Suviana e Brasimone, Emilia Romagna, central Italy), in an experimental area where the vegetation was characterised by a high presence of bracken fern. Agronomical operations consisted of the restoration of a pasture, using an appropriate <b>forage</b> <b>mixture.</b> After the restoration, data collection concerned botanical composition, floristic richness and biodiversity of vegetation. Moreover, the utilization of single species by wild fauna was assessed by means of the defoliation rate methodology in order to evaluate the real consumption of each plant species. The results obtained in the studied area confirmed the efficiency of the improvement in terms of botanical composition and pastoral value of the pasture and they provided detailed information about selection of different plant species by wild ungulates...|$|E
40|$|Inclusion of forage legumes in low-input forage {{mixtures}} improves herbage {{production and}} soil fertility through addition of nitrogen (N) from N 2 -fixation. The impact of different grass–legume mixtures on the N {{contribution of the}} <b>forage</b> <b>mixture</b> has rarely been investigated under comparable soil and climatic conditions. We conducted a field experiment on a sandy soil at two nitrogen levels with seven twospecies forage mixtures: alfalfa, bird’s-foot trefoil, red clover, or white clover in mixture with perennial ryegrass, and white clover in mixture with meadow fescue, timothy, or hybrid ryegrass. We found high N 2 - fixation of more than 300 kg N ha− 1 from both red clover and alfalfa even when the two mixtures received 300 kg total-N ha− 1 in cattle slurry. The addition of cattle slurry N fertilizer lowered N 2 -fixation for white clover and red clover as expected, but for bird’s-foot trefoil and alfalfa no changes {{in the proportion of}} N derived from N 2 -fixation was observed. We conclude that the competition for available soil N from perennial ryegrass in mixture was an important factor for the proportion of N in alfalfa, white clover, and bird’s-foot trefoil obtained from N 2 -fixation. White clover had a high proportion of N derived from atmosphere for all companion grasses despite significant differences in white clover proportion. Although the perennial ryegrass–alfalfa mixture in the grass phase yielded more than twice the N from N 2 -fixation compared to white clover in the perennial ryegrass mixture, this did not in the following year lead to higher residual N effects of alfalfa. Both in terms of N yield in the grass phase and N yield in the subsequent spring barley red clover contributed most to the improvement of soil N fertility...|$|E

The final version is available from via American Dairy Science Association [URL] multiparous Holstein-Friesian dairy cows were used in a replicated 3 ? 3 Latin square changeover design experiment to test the effects of changing from corn (Zea mays) silage to red clover (Trifolium pratense) silage in graded proportions on feed intakes, milk production, and whole-body N and P partitioning. Three dietary treatments with ad libitum access to 1 of 3 <b>forage</b> <b>mixtures</b> plus a standard allowance of 4 kg/d dairy concentrates were offered. The 3 treatment <b>forage</b> <b>mixtures</b> were, on a dry matter (DM) basis: (1) R 10 : 90 % corn silage and 10 % red clover silage, (2) R 50 : 50 % corn silage and 50 % red clover silage, and (3) R 90 : 10 % corn silage and 90 % red clover silage. In each of 3 experimental periods, there were 21 d for adaptation to diets, and 7 d for measurements. Diet crude protein intakes increased, and starch intakes decreased, as the silage mixture changed from 90 % corn to 90 % red clover, although the highest forage DM intakes and milk yields were achieved on diet R 50. Although milk fat yields were unaffected by diet, milk protein yields were highest with the R 50 diet. Whole-body partitioning of N was measured in a subset of cows (n = 9), and both the daily amount and proportion of N consumed that was excreted in feces and urine increased as the proportion of red clover silage in the diet increased. However, the apparent efficiency of utilization of feed N for milk protein production decreased from 0. 33 g/g for diet R 10 to 0. 25 g/g for diet R 90. The urinary excretion of purine derivatives (sum of allantoin and uric acid) tended to increase, suggesting greater flow of microbial protein from the rumen, as the proportion of red clover silage in the diet increased, and urinary creatinine excretion was affected by diet. Fecal shedding of E. coli was not affected by dietary treatment. In conclusion, even though microbial protein flow may have been greatest from the R 90 diet, optimum feed intakes and milk yields were achieved on a diet that contained a 1 : 1 DM mixture of corn and red clover silagesauthorsversionPeer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Provision of an {{adequate}} mineral {{supply in the}} diets of ruminants fed mainly on grassland herbage can present a challenge if mineral concentrations are suboptimal for animal nutrition. Forage herbs may be included in grassland seed mixtures to improve herbage mineral content, although there is limited information about mineral concentrations in forage herbs. To determine whether herbs have greater macro- and micromineral concentrations than forage legumes and grasses, we conducted a 2 -year experiment on a loamy-sand site in Denmark sown with a multi-species mixture comprised of three functional groups (grasses, legumes and herbs). Herb species included chicory (Cichorium intybus L.), plantain (Plantago lanceolata L.), caraway (Carum carvi L.) and salad burnet (Sanguisorba minor L.). We also investigated the effect of slurry application on the macro- and micromineral concentration of grasses, legumes and herbs. In general, herbs had greater concentrations of the macrominerals P, Mg, K and S and the microminerals Zn and B than grasses and legumes. Slurry application indirectly decreased Ca, S, Cu and B concentrations of total herbage because {{of an increase in}} the proportion of mineral-poor grasses.

Alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), sainfoin (Onobrychis sativa Lam.), brome grass (Bromus inermis Leys.), intermediate wheatgrass (Agropyron intermedium (Host). Beauv.), crested wheatgrass (Agropyron cristatum L. Gaertn.) and their binary and ternary mixtures were used as experimental material. The study found significant differences in yield and quality among the <b>forage</b> <b>mixtures</b> investigated. Sainfoin + bromegrass + crested wheatgrass and sainfoin + crested wheatgrass mixtures gave the highest dry matter yield (8. 36 and 7. 75 t/ha, respectively). Binary and ternary mixtures of alfalfa + grasses had higher crude protein levels and lower values of ADF and NDF content than mixtures of sainfoin + grasses. Pure alfalfa (56. 64 %) and binary mixtures of alfalfa + grasses (53. 53 to 54. 28 %) had the highest TDN values. The relative feed values of the mixtures ranged from 95. 64 to 112. 58.
