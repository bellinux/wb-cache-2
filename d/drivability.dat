5|$|The general <b>drivability</b> test is {{performed}} by trotter stallions. It is optional for draught type horses {{in lieu of}} the pulling test, and for pony-sized horses {{in lieu of the}} rideability test. The horse is driven by two different members of the studbook evaluation committee during this test, and asked to perform at a walk and trot. Its cooperation and disposition are evaluated on a scale of 4 to 10 points.|$|E
5|$|The trotter type is {{the lightest}} Finnhorse. A trotter section horse {{should be of}} light {{conformation}} yet muscular, with a relatively long body and long legs. At the studbook evaluation, a trotter-type horse must meet the standards in racing results and/or in breeding value index as decreed by Suomen Hippos. A trotter's disposition is evaluated during the <b>drivability</b> test. However, type {{is not part of}} the studbook evaluation standard for trotters.|$|E
5|$|The draught section <b>drivability</b> test, which evaluates disposition: adaptability, reliability, and calmness, {{consists}} of four parts, and 0–5 points are given for each. To pass the test, the horse must score at least one point for {{each part of the}} test, and its combined score for the test must be at least 10 points. The first part examines the behaviour of the horse while it is being harnessed and loaded, then unloaded and unharnessed, and the remaining three parts evaluate the way the horse behaves when being driven. These parts often include regulation of the speed of the horse's walk, halts, turns around obstacles, and backing with a load around a corner.|$|E
5|$|A pony-sized Finnhorse must measure no {{more than}} 148cm (14.2-1/2 hands, 58-1/2inches) at the withers or the croup. Both sexes are also {{required}} to pass either a <b>drivability</b> or a ridability test. The horse's pedigree is also evaluated, and uncharacteristically small individuals descending from larger-sized lines are not accepted. The horse should be proportionately small all over, and express all the qualities of a full-size Finnhorse. Especially thorough {{attention is paid to}} the pony-sized horse's character, obedience and cooperation. The pony-sized Finnhorse is suited to practically any use the larger Finnhorse is, with the exception of heavy draught work because of its smaller size and proportionally reduced strength. However, some individuals have been able to compete with and even win against full-size Finnhorses in work horse competitions. Many pony-sized individuals are cross-registered for trotter section breeding, as small Finnhorses can be equal competitors in harness against larger ones. In combined driving, the pony-sized Finnhorse's size is an advantage, allowing for greater agility. The section is popular for therapy and riding school use.|$|E
25|$|GM {{has long}} worked on alternative-technology vehicles, and {{has led the}} {{industry}} with ethanol-burning flexible-fuel vehicles that can run on either E85 (ethanol) or gasoline. The company {{was the first to}} use turbochargers and was an early proponent of V6 engines in the 1960s, but quickly lost interest as muscle car popularity increased. They demonstrated gas turbine vehicles powered by kerosene, an area of interest throughout the industry, but abandoned the alternative engine configuration in view of the 1973 oil crisis. In the 1970s and 1980s, GM pushed the benefits of diesel engines and cylinder deactivation technologies with disastrous results due to poor durability in the Oldsmobile diesels and <b>drivability</b> issues in the Cadillac V8-6-4 variable-cylinder engines. In 1987, GM, in conjunction with AeroVironment, built the Sunraycer, which won the inaugural World Solar Challenge and was a showcase of advanced technology. Much of the technology from Sunraycer found its way into the Impact prototype electric vehicle (also built by Aerovironment) and was the predecessor to the General Motors EV1.|$|E
500|$|A draught-type horse {{must pass}} two {{tests in the}} {{studbook}} evaluation: a walking test and either a pulling or a general <b>drivability</b> test. The points given for the horse's performance in these tests are added to those given for its temperament and gaits, resulting in the final workability score. The horse is also given a score for its conformation. In addition to achieving the minimum scores for both workability and conformation, stallions accepted for the working-horse section of the stud book are required to trot [...] in less than 2 minutes and 30 seconds.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "Sportshift" [...] {{semi-automatic}} transmission {{benefited from a}} software update, while a lightened flywheel was introduced for both the manual and the Sportshift. Aston Martin also stiffened the suspension and now uses Bilstein dampers. An optional sports pack is being offered with stiffer springs, tighter handling, and all-new 5-spoke alloy wheels. Sportshift-equipped models also receive a new dual throttle mapping update which allows the driver to choose from the default sport mode, or comfort mode, which gives more comfortable shifts and throttle input for <b>drivability.</b>|$|E
2500|$|... 1989 {{marked the}} first year of a fuel-injected V8 engine. The 305cuin V8 was updated with {{throttle}} body electronic fuel-injection (RPO LO3), first introduced in 1987 on Chevrolet/GMC pickups and vans. This engine was rated at [...] and , which was only a slight increase in torque over the carbureted engine. However, the cold weather starts, <b>drivability,</b> fuel economy and emissions were all improved as a result of fuel injection. The 4.3L V6 was no longer the base engine, and was now only available in taxi and police optioned Caprices. The 307 engine remained unchanged for station wagons. Rear-seat passengers received shoulder belts for the outboard positions and air conditioning was standard on all models.|$|E
2500|$|In 1990, Yugo America {{introduced}} an {{electronic fuel injection}} version of the Yugo GVX to replace the less expensive carbureted fuel system; however, it arrived too late {{as the result of}} a recall by the United States Environmental Protection Agency of over 126,000 vehicles sold in the United States due to a failure to meet exhaust emissions. The recall effectively caused Yugo America to cease importation and fold in April 1992. The faulted emission system used an [...] "emissions" [...] carburetor of outdated design, a two-way catalyst that required an air pump, and exhaust gas recirculation valve; the outdated, power-reducing application of this equipment on an already under-performing drivetrain was one of the major problems that caused the vehicles to get a reputation for poor <b>drivability</b> and the inability to meet emission standards.|$|E
2500|$|Of all {{cylinder}} layouts without {{balance shaft}} a straight eight design has very low inherent vibration, while the side-valve layout contains {{the moving parts}} of the valve train within the cast-iron block, enabling it to be very quiet compared to an overhead valve configuration (as in the contemporary Buick engines). Combined with a substantial exhaust manifold and effective intake and exhaust muffling {{this can lead to}} a very quiet vehicle, both internally and externally. At the time of its use a quiet engine was thought to be a mark of quality in an automobile. Bores need be of small diameter to keep the engine length down and so strokes must be long to obtain larger displacements - such configurations (called [...] "undersquare") exhibit good low-rpm torque and are capable of slow idle speeds, enhancing both <b>drivability</b> and quietness. While Chrysler vehicles had similar engines they were not targeted for the lower middle price range enabled by General Motors' manufacturing expertise and volumes of the time.|$|E
2500|$|Drivetrain choices {{remained}} basically {{as before}} but the high-performance pair received several noteworthy improvements. The solid-lifter unit was driven with a high-lift, long-duration camshaft to produce [...] and breathed through a big four-barrel Holley carburetor {{instead of the}} base engine's Carter unit. The fuel injected engine also gained , bringing its total to , but at a then-hefty $538.00. Although transmission options remained ostensibly the same for 1964, the two Borg-Warner T-10 four-speeds {{gave way to a}} similar pair of gearboxes built at GM's Muncie, Indiana, transmission facility. Originally a Chevy design, it had an aluminum case like the Borg-Warner box but came with stronger synchronizers and wider ratios for better durability and <b>drivability.</b> If enthusiast publications liked the first Sting Ray, they loved the 1964, though some writers noted the convertible's tendency to rattle and shake on rough roads. [...] Sales of the 1964 Sting Ray reached 22,229 - another new Corvette record, if up only a little from banner-year 1963. Coupe volume dropped to 8304 units, but convertible sales more than compensated, rising to 13,925.|$|E
2500|$|Suzuki's {{inability}} to fully meet the 1978 emissions regulations with the two-stroke engine compelled {{them to write}} a contract with Toyota to purchase engines from their subsidiary Daihatsu, Suzuki's main competitor. Beginning in May 1977 Daihatsu's catalysed [...] four-stroke AB10 engine was installed in the SS11, selling in parallel with the two-stroke at a slightly higher (by ¥18,000) price. Four-strokes had a [...] "4" [...] logo in the grille. These were very weak sellers, offering much less torque and <b>drivability</b> than their two-cycle brethren. Torque was 3.9kgm at 3500rpm, versus 4.6kgm in the smaller two-stroke engine. At about the same time, in an attempt at meeting the tighter 1978 (53年) emissions standards with a two-stroke, the new SS12 Fronte 7-S was presented. It had a now even cleaner T4A engine called the TC53. [...] "TC53" [...] stood for Twin Catalyst, year 53 of the Showa era (1978 in the common era). This new, cleaner engine lost further power and torque though, now down to , and still barely met the official emissions standards. A mere 6421 SS12s were built, compared to 66,540 SS10 Frontes.|$|E
2500|$|Compared to {{the first}} {{generation}} Ridgeline, Honda's second attempt at a mid-size truck for the North American market has the automotive press changing its tune, yet it still has an image problem. [...] Gearheads.org wrote the [...] "2017 Honda Ridgeline still won’t get respect but should" [...] stating, its [...] "downside {{is going to be}} looks" [...] with its [...] "soft rounded pudgy panda look rather than a sharp chiseled warhorse." [...] A New York Daily News reporter said, [...] "You’d think that the most utilitarian of passenger vehicle styles –-the pickup truck-– would be a completely logical purchase. [...] If that were the case, the Ridgeline would outsell all of the other midsize trucks by a landslide, boasting the best combination of safety, utility and <b>drivability</b> in the class. [...] But the Toyota Tacoma and Chevrolet Colorado both have something that the Ridgeline almost completely lacks: ...bravado." [...] That being said, Car and Driver magazine proclaimed, [...] "The Ridgeline’s roomy cabin, ample storage, smooth ride, and innovative touches make its rivals seem outdated. ...it not only has cargo space, but also the makings of a great tailgate party..." [...] Motor Trend magazine summed up their view by says they liked [...] "its smooth ride and sharp handling," [...] disliked [...] "the high price, clumsy infotainment system, and plain design," [...] and nominated the new Ridgeline as one of its finalist for their 2017 Truck of the Year competition.|$|E
2500|$|At a {{media event}} on February 28, 2011, Holden {{unveiled}} the Australian assembled Cruze sedan in facelifted [...] "Series II" [...] guise, {{otherwise known as}} the JH series. Prime Minister Julia Gillard attended the February launch to drive the first example off Holden's production line before full-scale production commenced in March. Holden has confirmed an initial local content level of between 40 and 50percent if assessed by retail value, with an aim of increasing Cruze localization over time. Series II styling revisions to the grille, lower air intake, and bumper have softened the front-end to bear a closer resemblance to Holden's larger VE II Commodore. Further differentiation from the original has been achieved via the fitment of amber front indicator lights, jewelled bezel headlamps, remodelled wheel trims, and through adjustments to the lower portion of the rear bumper. Carrying over largely unchanged is the 1.8-liter petrol inline-four, tweaked to yield slight enhancements in <b>drivability.</b> When automatic transmission is specified, the 1.8-liter is now teamed with GM's six-speed 6T30 unit, lighter and more compact than the previous 6T40. Diesel remains optional for [...] "CD" [...] and [...] "CDX" [...] specifications over the standard 1.8-liter petrol. Alterations to the 2.0-liter turbodiesel have resulted in an additional [...] and [...] and a slight reduction in fuel consumption for the manual variant, now a six-speed unit. However, the headline change is {{the release of the}} turbocharged 1.4-liter engine, dubbed iTi by Holden for intelligent turbo induction. The inclusion of the 1.4 also brings an upgrade to electric (as opposed to hydraulic) power steering and affixes a Watt's linkage to the torsion beam rear suspension. Linked with six-speed manual or automatic transmissions, the 1.4 is fitted as standard to the new [...] "SRi" [...] and [...] "SRi-V" [...] sports-oriented trims, but is available at extra cost on the base [...] "CD". The new [...] "SRi" [...] and [...] "SRi-V" [...] models have their respective badges embossed onto the grille insert, are fitted with their own front bumper design, and feature side skirts, chrome exterior door handles, a rear lip spoiler, and five-spoke 17-inch alloy wheels. Over the [...] "CD", [...] "SRi" [...] gains a leather-covered steering wheel rim and shift lever, with the [...] "SRi-V" [...] extending this upholstering to the seating. A heat function for the front seats, keyless entry with push-button engine start, reversing sensors, and seven-inch LCD multimedia unit are also part of the [...] "SRi-V" [...] equipment list. This multimedia system integrates satellite navigation, the CD and DVD players, and a 10GB internal hard disk drive. In mid-November 2011, Holden released the MY12 update to the Series II Cruze. This update coincided with the release of the hatchback body variant and saw Bluetooth telephone connectivity standard across the range.|$|E

50|$|Like locking hubs, the CAD {{system is}} {{designed}} to improve fuel efficiency of the vehicle. Other, often debated, benefits of CAD systems are reduced vibration, axle wear, and noise, as well as improved steering and <b>drivability.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{case of a}} Heat Plate-failure the car {{may have}} <b>drivability</b> {{problems}} due condensed fuel in the intake during cold engine operations. This condensed fuel is compensated in engines without Heat Plates by enriching the A/F mixture.|$|E
50|$|Unlike the ARX-01, the ARX-02 is {{a bespoke}} LMP {{designed}} entirely for Acura by Wirth Research. The original 3.4L V8 was expanded to 4 liters for more durability and <b>drivability</b> {{with the larger}} power developed with P1 rules.|$|E
50|$|After {{problems}} with their engine in the first races, which saw Daniel Ricciardo down to his last power unit after just four outings, Renault introduced a new, modified engine for the Spanish Grand Prix, aiming to improve both reliability and <b>drivability.</b>|$|E
50|$|All models {{received}} {{catalytic converters}} {{to meet the}} latest federal and California emission requirements that included bonuses such as improved fuel economy and <b>drivability,</b> along with longer spark plug and muffler life, but required more expensive and lower-octane unleaded gasoline.|$|E

50|$|However, the V8-6-4 engine would {{experience}} {{a litany of}} unsolvable problems in <b>drivability</b> and reliability mostly due to the primitive state of engine control technologies at the time. Cadillac was then forced to rush development and production of the High Technology engine for a 1982 introduction in their current rear-wheel drive models.|$|E
5000|$|Pontiac's Maximum Mileage System {{consisted}} of GM's new catalytic converter that reduced emissions while improving <b>drivability</b> and fuel economy, a High Energy electronic ignition, and lengthened routine maintenance intervals. Radial tires were standard on all models and a [...] "Radial Tuned Suspension" [...] option was available that included upgraded radial tires along with {{front and rear}} sway bars.|$|E
50|$|Motronic is {{the trade}} name {{given to a}} range of digital engine control units {{developed}} by Robert Bosch GmbH (commonly known as Bosch) which combined control of fuel injection and ignition in a single unit. By controlling both major systems in a single unit, many aspects of the engine's characteristics (such as power, fuel efficiency, <b>drivability,</b> and emissions) can be improved.|$|E
50|$|Several kit {{cars and}} replicas {{inspired}} by the Ford GT40 have been built. They are generally intended for assembly by the enthusiast in a home workshop or garage. There are two alternatives to the kit car approach, either continuation models (exact and licensed replicas true to the original GT40), or modernizations (replicas with upgraded components, ergonomics & trim for improved usability, <b>drivability</b> and performance).|$|E
5000|$|The Bosch K-Jetronic CIS varied fuel {{pressure}} to the injectors dependent on the mass airflow. While this system was exceedingly reliable, it did not allow the use of as [...] "hot" [...] cams as MFI or carburettors allowed. Therefore, the 911S's horsepower decreased from 190 to 175 PS (140-128 kW) despite the displacement increase from 2.4 to 2.7 L. However, the engine did have increased <b>drivability.</b>|$|E

50|$|Cross-drive {{transmissions}} also {{improved the}} <b>drivability</b> of the manual transmissions then in use. Manual transmissions were heavy and tiring to drive, requiring skill and strength from the driver, and also frequent adjustments as the clutch plates wore. The pre-selector gearbox {{had been used}} to simplify the driving task, but at the cost of mechanical complexity. The cross-drive transmissions offered a mechanically-actuated self-changing gearbox, where the ratio selection could be either manual, automatic, or by pre-selection.|$|E
50|$|Incremental {{improvements}} {{were made}} almost every {{year of the}} production run. One of the major improvements was {{the introduction of the}} oxygen sensor in North America in late 1976 (1977 models), which Volvo called Lambda Sond and developed in conjunction with Bosch. It added a feedback loop to the K-Jetronic fuel injection system already in use, which allowed fine-tuning of the air and fuel mixture and therefore produced superior emissions, <b>drivability</b> and fuel economy.|$|E
50|$|The TR-6070 {{is based}} on the well-respected TREMEC TR-6060 {{six-speed}} transmission. A triple overdrive gear was added to improve fuel economy and lower emissions. Incorporated in the TR-6070 is a Gear Absolute Position (GAP) sensor. The technology provides a signal from the transmission to the engine controller, inferring the real time position of the shift selector. With this information, the engine RPM can be controlled to match the next gear selection - which enhances <b>drivability.</b>|$|E
