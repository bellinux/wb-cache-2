500|$|After {{selecting}} the music by Alexandrov for the anthem, Stalin needed new lyrics. [...] He {{thought that the}} anthem was short and, because of the Great Patriotic War, that it needed a statement about the impending defeat of Nazi Germany by the Red Army. The poets Sergey Mikhalkov and Gabriel El-Registan were called to Moscow by one of Stalin's staffers, and were told to fix the lyrics to Alexandrov's music. They were instructed to keep the verses the same, but {{to find a way}} to change the refrains which described [...] "a Country of Soviets". Because of the difficulty of expressing the concepts of the Great Patriotic War in song, that idea was dropped from the version which El-Registan and Mikhalkov completed overnight. After a few minor changes to emphasize the Russian Motherland, Stalin approved the anthem and had it published on 7 November 1943, including a line about Stalin [...] "inspir us to <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>faith</b> with the people". The revised anthem was announced to all of the USSR on January1, 1944 and became official on March15, 1944.|$|E
500|$|At this time, {{the priests}} who {{were part of}} St. Peter were doing the best they could to <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>faith</b> alive in their congregation. The priests were smart men who had {{attended}} school in Italy prior to their immigration, but most were unable to speak fluent English. At a time when immigrants were desperately trying to fit into the American life and be as American as possible, going to a church where the congregation was Italian was not the most desirable choice. [...] Therefore, many Catholic Italians began going to churches and many others changed their religion altogether. Many of these Italians were becoming Protestant. [...] The priests were poorly paid and most lived on about twenty-five cents per day. They had no permanent housing: many slept in the church itself, and preferred the altar floor {{because it was the only}} place in the church that had carpeting. It was also common for the priests to say Mass several churches on the same day. These circuits trips were sometimes as much as twenty-five miles away.|$|E

On Maxwell's emergence with Urban Hang Suite, writer Carol Brennan cited him, along with the Fugees, D'Angelo and Tony Rich, as neo soul musicians that [...] "exhibited the identifying characteristics of this new breed of R artists: lyrics that give voice to intense personal expression, creative control over the music, and a unexpectedly successful debut." [...] In his book A Change Is Gonna Come: Music, Race & the Soul of America (2006), Craig Hansen Werner lists Maxwell's Urban Hang Suite as important in neo soul, including it along with R.

2500|$|Bon Jovi's fifth studio album <b>Keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>Faith</b> was {{released}} in November 1992, representing [...] "the {{beginning of a new}} chapter in the history of Bon Jovi" [...] and marking a change in the band's sound and image. The album turned away from heavy drums and wild guitar solos, but instead introduced a more mature sound of Bon Jovi and contained more serious lyrics. The media focused considerable attention on Jon Bon Jovi’s hair. When Jon Bon Jovi cut his hair he made headlines on CNN. To promote <b>Keep</b> <b>The</b> <b>Faith</b> they returned to their roots playing a few dates at the small New Jersey clubs where they had started their career.

The (Eastern) Orthodox Church strives to <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>faith</b> of the seven Ecumenical Councils. In contrast, the term [...] "Oriental Orthodoxy" [...] refers to the churches of Eastern Christian traditions that <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>faith</b> of only the first three ecumenical councils. Both the Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox churches formally believe themselves to be the continuation of the true church and the other to have fallen into schism, although in the past 20 years much work has been done toward ecumenism or reconciliation between the Oriental and Eastern Orthodox churches. There has been an attempt to achieve ecumenism (Russian: sobornost) between the Antiochian and Oriental Orthodox churches. At Chambesy in Switzerland, plenary talks were held resulting in agreements in 1989, 1990 and 1993. All official representatives of the Eastern Orthodox and the Oriental Orthodox reached agreement in these dialogues that the Christological differences between the two communions are more a matter of emphasis than of substance. Although elements in a number of the Eastern Orthodox Churches have criticized the apparent consensus reached by the representatives at Chambesy, the patriarch and holy synod of the Antiochian Orthodox Church welcomed the agreements as positive moves towards a sharing in the Love of God, and a rejection of the hatred of insubstantial division.|$|E
2500|$|The band's {{first four}} albums blended the glam metal and hard rock genres.

40|$|We {{study the}} role of women in the Bursylysyas Komi folk {{orthodox}} movement. Throughout the history of the movement, women have gradually gained more authority in this religious community. The initial stage of communist rule and the final phase of the Soviet Union were periods in which women’s domination in local religious life was most obvious. We argue that men lost their leadership in the movement because their way of execution of religious power was public and thus they became targets for Soviet repression. Komi women continued to <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> Bursylysyas <b>faith</b> alive, although they did so in a more domestic, hidden way. This enabled women to lead local religious practise throughout the Soviet period. In addition, the peculiar ecstatic practices of Bursylysyas, most fully developed during the initial period of Soviet rule, were more suitable for women in the framework of Komi traditional folk religiosity...|$|R
