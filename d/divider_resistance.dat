In {{order to}} solve the light failure {{problems}} that cannot {{be found in the}} process of coach running in time, a new type of full electronic automotive light detector is designed in this research. The detector, as one of fixed electrical parts, is installed on the coach central control box in the process of automobile manufacture. It, as a sensitive element, controls circuits to work through <b>divider</b> <b>resistance</b> in tandem with car lamps. This article introduces working principles of the detector and circuit design and its performance. The detector is subjected to the test by being installed on the coach. The result shows that it has excellent performance and the test has also set a trouble-free record of 500, 000 km...|$|E
5000|$|In {{a normal}} voltage <b>divider,</b> the <b>{{resistance}}</b> of each branch {{is less than}} the resistance of the whole, so the output voltage {{is less than the}} input. Here, due to the negative resistance, the total AC resistance [...] is less than the resistance of the diode alone [...] so the AC output voltage [...] is greater than the input [...] The voltage gain [...] is greater than one, and increases without limit as [...] approaches [...]|$|R
50|$|When Kelvin-Varley {{dividers}} {{are used}} to test high voltages, self-heating can create a problem. The first divider stage is often made from 10 kΩ resistors, so the <b>divider</b> input <b>resistance</b> is 100 kΩ. Total power dissipation at 1000 V is therefore 10 W. Most of the divider resistors will dissipate 1 W, but the two resistors bridged by the second divider stage will only dissipate 0.25 W each. That means the bridged resistors will have {{a quarter of the}} self-heating and a quarter of the temperature rise.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{electromagnetic}} pulse simulator designed {{in this paper}} consists of an adjustable direct current high voltage source, a capacitor for energy-storage, an air spark gap switch, a resistive divider for measurement and a GHz transversal electromagnetic wave (GTEM) cell. The analysis model is constructed based on the theory of transmission line. Influencing factors, such as self-load and impedance mismatch of the transmission line (as well as the cell), were analyzed using Pspice. The self-load {{has the effect of}} parallel connection with the load of GTEM cell. It may increase the rise-time, decrease the fall time and reduce the voltage peak. The sudden change of the transmission line impedance will make the waveform of pulse contain reflected oscillation. Four types of <b>resistance</b> <b>divider</b> link were also simulated using Pspice. Improper connection of the <b>resistance</b> <b>divider</b> will cause the waveform of pulse oscillation and lengthen the rise-time, which can be reduced by shorting the high voltage lead, using system structure with gradually changing resistance or connecting a damping resistance at the end...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{enhanced}} accurate DC and RF model of nonlinear spiral polysilicon voltage <b>divider.</b> The high <b>resistance</b> polysilicon <b>divider</b> is a sensing part of the high voltage start-up MOSFET transistor that can operate up to 700 V. This paper presents {{the structure of a}} proposed model, implemented voltage, frequency and temperature dependency, and scalability. A special attention is paid to the ability of the created model to cover the mismatch and influence of a variation of process parameters on the device characteristics. Finally, the comparison of measured data vs. simulation is presented in order to confirm the model validity and a typical application is demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|Improvement or {{at least}} control of {{variability}} {{is one of the}} key challenges for Redox based resistive switching memory technology. In this paper, we investigate the impact of a serial resistor as a voltage divider on the SET variability in Pt/Ta 2 O 5 /Ta/Pt nano crossbar devices. A partial RESET in a competing complementary switching (CS) mode is identified as a possible failure mechanism of bipolar switching SET in our devices. Due to a voltage <b>divider</b> effect, serial <b>resistance</b> value shows unequal impact on switching voltages of both modes which allows for a selective suppression of the CS mode. The impact of voltage divider on SET variability is demonstrated. A combination of appropriate write voltage and serial resistance allows for a significant improvement of the SET variabilit...|$|R
40|$|Strain gauges {{allow the}} measurands force, pressure, torque or strain to be {{converted}} into voltage ratios and to be indicated by measuring amplifiers. Precision measurements are preferably carried out at 225 Hz and at voltage ratios of up to 2 mV/V. Bridge standards, which have to {{be traced back to}} national standards, are used for the electrical calibration of these measuring amplifiers. More than 15 years ago, in PTB the first measuring arrangement for this purpose has been developed and installed. The present contribution explains the traceability principle of bridge standards, shows the long-term stability of selected bridge standards on the basis of measurement results and brings first investigations into the interchangeability of measuring amplifiers up for discussion. Traceability of bridge standards Strain gauge transducer and measuring amplifier form a measuring chain. For the calibration of the measuring amplifiers, the transducer is replaced by a so-called bridge standard which allows defined voltage ratios to be realized with high precision and to be applied as calibration signals to the measuring amplifier. Bridge standards contain <b>resistance</b> <b>divider...</b>|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} focused on the effect {{produced}} by systematic error of measurement devices in monitoring of a system, dam. The effect produced by systematic error in dam monitoring consist in a wrongdescription of dam evolution. Measurement errors lead in a deflection of the dam from the normal evolution. The physical parameter, inclination, needs to be measured with an accuracy of 0. 05 %. The sensor used is a full differential output voltage. In a measurementdevice an error source is the electronic components imperfections. The performance of measurement instruments depend on resistance tolerance. The error produced by tolerance on a measurement device is a systematic error and in monitoring process become a random error. The measure of transducer with Wheatstone-bridge supposes to use high accuracy resistance of 0. 01 %. But a high accuracy resistor increases the cost o instruments. The source of systematic error can be eliminated if the transducer is measured without <b>resistance</b> <b>divider.</b> To obtain positive voltage at sensor output this is power supply relative to common mode voltage of analog converter. In this casethe measurement error depends just by ADC. The acquisition is made with a differential converter. To obtain an accuracy of measurement of 0. 05 % is used a 14 bit converter. The ADC has auto calibration function so the offset and gain errors are internally compensated...|$|R
