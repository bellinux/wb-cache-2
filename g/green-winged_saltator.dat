50|$|The thick-billed saltator (Saltator maxillosus) is {{a species}} of saltator in the Thraupidae family. It is found in {{highland}} Atlantic Forest in southeastern Brazil, far northeastern Argentina (only Misiones Province), and perhaps far eastern Paraguay. Unlike most other saltators, it is sexually dichromatic: Females resemble a <b>green-winged</b> <b>saltator,</b> but with a thicker bill, greener face and buff throat. The male thick-billed saltator is unique with its long white eyebrow, grey back, and black and orange beak (amount of orange varies).|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{wild and}} {{domestic}} birds, cryptosporidiosis is {{often associated with}} infections by Cryptosporidium galli, Cryptosporidium baileyi and Cryptosporidium meleagridis. In addition to these species, a number of avian Cryptosporidium species yet to be fully characterized are commonly found among exotic and wild avian isolates. The present study aimed to detect and identify samples of Cryptosporidium spp. from free-living wild birds, in order to contribute to the knowledge of the variability of this parasite in the free-living population of Brazil. Stool samples were collected from 242 birds, with the following proportions of individuals: 50 Emberizidae (20. 7 %), 112 Psittacidae (46. 3 %), 44 Cardinalidae (18. 2 %), 12 Turdidae (5. 0 %), eight Ramphastidae (3. 3 %), seven Icteridae (2. 9 %), three Estrilididae (1. 2 %), two Contigidae (0. 8 %), two Thraupidae (0. 8 %) and two Fringilidae (0. 8 %). Among the 242 fecal samples from wild birds, 16 (6. 6 %) were positive for the presence of oocysts of Cryptosporidium. Molecular characterization of the 16 samples of Cryptosporidium, were performed with phylogenetic reconstructions employing 292 positions of 18 S rDNA. None of the samples of birds was characterized as C. meleagridis. C. galli was identified in one rufous-bellied thrush (Turdus rufiventris), five <b>green-winged</b> <b>saltators</b> (Saltator similis), one slate-coloured seedeater (Sporophila schistacea), one goldfinch (Carduelis carduelis) and three saffron finches (Sicalis flaveola). One goldfinch isolate, one buffy-fronted seedeater (Sporophila frontalis), one red-cowled cardinal (Paroaria dominicana) and one other saffron finch (S. flaveola) were identified as C. baileyi. Avian genotype II was found in an isolate from a white-eyed parakeet (Aratinga leucophthalma). Clinical symptoms of cryptosporidiosis in birds have already been described and the number of wild birds which were shedding parasites was high. Therefore, further epidemiological research and disease surveillance of birds in the wild is warranted...|$|R

40|$|AbstractClinical, gross, and {{histopathology}} lesions {{and molecular}} characterization of Trichomonas spp. infection were described in two striped owls (Asio (Rhinoptynx) clamator), one American kestrel (Falco sparverius), two green-winged saltators (Saltator similis), {{and in a}} toco toucan (Ramphastos toco) from Brazil. These birds presented clinical signs including emaciation, ruffled feathers, abundant salivation and open mouth breathing presumably due to abundant caseous material. Gross lesions were characterized by multifocal yellow friable plaques {{on the surface of}} the tongue, pharynx and/or caseous masses partially occluding the laryngeal entrance. In the owls, the caseous material extended into the mandibular muscles and invaded the sinuses of the skull. Histopathologically, marked necrotic and inflammatory lesions were associated with numerous round to oval, pale eosinophilic structures (6 – 10 μm) with basophilic nuclei, consistent with trichomonads. Organisms similar to those described above also were found in the liver of the two green-winged saltators. To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first report of trichomonosis in a striped owl and a toco toucan. Sequence analysis of the Trichomonas spp. internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS- 1) region and partial 5. 8 S of the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) disclosed significant genetic diversity. Two sequences had 100 % identity to Trichomonas gallinae, whereas two sequences had a 99 % and 92 % identity to a Trichomonas vaginalis-like sequence, respectively. One sequence (<b>green-winged</b> <b>saltator</b> 502 - 08) had a 100 % identity to a newly recognized genus Simplicomonas...|$|E
