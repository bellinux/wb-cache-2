500|$|Keynes {{had begun}} a {{theoretical}} work {{to examine the}} relationship between unemployment, money and prices back in the 1920s. The work, Treatise on Money, was published in 1930 in two volumes. A central idea of the work was that if the amount of money being saved exceeds the amount being invested – which can happen if interest rates are too high – then unemployment will rise. This is in part a result of people not wanting to spend too high a proportion of what employers pay out, making it difficult, in aggregate, for employers to make a profit. Another key theme of the book is the unreliability of <b>financial</b> <b>indices</b> for representing an accurate – or indeed meaningful – indication of general shifts in purchasing power of currencies over time. In particular he criticised the justification of Britain's return to the gold standard in 1925 at pre-war valuation by reference to the wholesale price index.

50|$|In {{economics}} and finance, an index is a statistical measure {{of changes in}} a representative group of individual data points. These data may be derived from any number of sources, including company performance, prices, productivity, and employment. Economic indices track economic health from different perspectives. Influential global <b>financial</b> <b>indices</b> such as the Global Dow, and the NASDAQ Composite track the performance of selected large and powerful companies in order to evaluate and predict economic trends. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 primarily track U.S. markets, though some legacy international companies are included. The consumer price index tracks the variation in prices for different consumer goods and services over time in a constant geographical location, and is integral to calculations used to adjust salaries, bond interest rates, and tax thresholds for inflation. The GDP Deflator Index, or real GDP, measures the level of prices of all new, domestically produced, final goods and services in an economy. Market performance indices include the labour market index/job index and proprietary stock market index investment instruments offered by brokerage houses.|$|E

40|$|Today’s {{construction}} industry consists of fierce competition and low margins, resulting in companies focusing on cost risk awareness. The {{aim of this}} thesis was to investigate how construction companies manage their market risks, with a special focus on commodity risks. In addition, the thesis purpose was also to explore the composition of commodity exposures within a few selected construction companies. A <b>financial</b> <b>index</b> of commodity exposures was generated out of Statistiska Centralbyråns’ totala faktorprisindex for multi-residence housing projects. Furthermore, a fictional case was combined to test the risk management effect of the <b>financial</b> <b>index,</b> using Sweden’s four largest construction companies’ commodity exposures. In summary, the construction companies were all aware of their commodity exposures although most of them did not actively manage them or know their exposures extent. Moreover, financial risk management of commodities is not easy or straightforward, resulting in difficulties in choosing the right management tool. Therefore, this thesis created and illustrated how a <b>financial</b> <b>index</b> {{could be used as}} a way to stabilize the profitability in construction projects...|$|R

One index, the London InterBank Offered Rate (2 ̆ 2 Libor 2 ̆ 2), may be the world 2 ̆ 7 s most important number, an interest rate benchmark upon which hundreds of trillions of dollars depend. Yet, almost every day new revelations emerge that Libor was tampered with {{during the height of}} the financial crisis by one or many of the world 2 ̆ 7 s most prominent banks, with billions of dollars potentially misappropriated. This index disruption has attracted tremendous interest from regulators, private litigants, and market observers. Despite their importance, however, <b>financial</b> <b>indices</b> are poorly understood, and almost completely unstudied.

40|$|We apply RMT, Network and MF-DFA {{methods to}} {{investigate}} correlation, network and multifractal properties of 20 global <b>financial</b> <b>indices.</b> We compare results {{before and during}} the financial crisis of 2008 respectively. We find that the network method gives more useful information about the formation of clusters as compared to results obtained from eigenvectors corresponding to second largest eigenvalue and these sectors are formed on the basis of geographical location of indices. At threshold 0. 6, indices corresponding to Americas, Europe and Asia/Pacific disconnect and form different clusters before the crisis but during the crisis, indices corresponding to Americas and Europe are combined together to form a cluster while the Asia/Pacific indices forms another cluster. By further increasing the value of threshold to 0. 9, European countries France, Germany and UK constitute the most tightly linked markets. We study multifractal properties of global <b>financial</b> <b>indices</b> and find that <b>financial</b> <b>indices</b> corresponding to Americas and Europe almost lie in the same range of degree of multifractality as compared to other indices.
