5|$|<b>Experts</b> <b>estimate</b> <b>that</b> {{with the}} {{accession}} of Armenia, the internationally unrecognised Nagorno-Karabakh Republic {{would not be}} integrated into the Eurasian Union. Armenia is a permanent political, military and economic ally of Russia, whereas Azerbaijan holds close ties with the west. The Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev expressed concern in 2013 that no reliable customs border between Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh could be drawn. However, Nazarbayev expressed that he holds all the existing disagreements preventing Armenia's integration into Eurasian Economic Union are surmountable. The Chairman of the Foreign Policy Committee in the Armenian Parliament, Artak Zakarian, announced on 14 May 2014 that Armenia will build no customs border including the region of Nagorno-Karabakh.|$|E

25|$|Some <b>experts</b> <b>estimate</b> <b>that</b> while up to 50% {{of cancers}} of the tonsil may be {{infected}} with HPV, only 50% {{of these are}} likely to be caused by HPV (as opposed to the usual tobacco and alcohol causes). The role of HPV in the remaining 25-30% is not yet clear. Oral sex is not risk free and results in a significant proportion of HPV-related head and neck cancer.|$|E
25|$|The Internet {{of things}} (IoT) is {{the network of}} {{physical}} devices, vehicles, home appliances, and other items embedded with electronics, software, sensors, actuators, and network connectivity which enable these objects to connect and exchange data. Each thing is uniquely identifiable through its embedded computing system but is able to inter-operate within the existing Internet infrastructure. <b>Experts</b> <b>estimate</b> <b>that</b> the IoT will consist of about 30 billion objects by 2020.|$|E
25|$|The {{uncontrolled}} {{urban development}} after {{the abolition of}} the indentured system and the late initiative to conserve the site in late 20th century meant that only the partial remains of the place have survived. From the complex founded in 1849, <b>experts</b> <b>estimate</b> <b>that</b> only about 15% still authentically exists today. However, records of the building plan and photographs, as well as recent archaeological evidence, allow for the precise reconstruction of the complex.|$|E

25|$|Urban {{flooding}} {{has significant}} economic implications. In the US, industry <b>experts</b> <b>estimate</b> <b>that</b> wet basements can lower property values by 10%-25% and are cited {{among the top}} reasons for not purchasing a home. According to the U.S Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), almost 40% of small businesses never reopen their doors following a flooding disaster. In the UK, urban flooding is estimated to cost £270 {{million a year in}} England and Wales; 80,000 homes are at risk.|$|E
25|$|By contrast, {{the water}} level of the Caspian Sea has been rising {{steadily}} since 1978 for reasons that scientists {{have not been able}} to explain fully. At the northern end of the sea, more than 10,000 square kilometres of land in Atyrau Province have been flooded. <b>Experts</b> <b>estimate</b> <b>that</b> if current rates of increase persist, the coastal city of Atyrau, eighty-eight other population centers, and many of Kazakhstan's Caspian oil fields could be submerged by 2020.|$|E
25|$|Increasing {{landfill}} {{space is}} also an issue. St. Lucie County is planning to experiment with burning trash through plasma arc gasification to generate energy and reduce landfill space. The experiment {{will be the largest}} {{of its kind in the}} world to date, and begin operation no later than 2009. If successful, <b>experts</b> <b>estimate</b> <b>that</b> the entire St. Lucie County landfill, estimated to contain 4.3 million tons of trash, will disappear within 18 years. Materials created in the energy production can also be used in road construction.|$|E
25|$|In October 2008 Ukrainian <b>experts</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> a small {{political}} party {{who wants to}} win seats in parliament would spend up to US$30 million on the campaign and large political parties would spend up to $100 million.

25|$|Urban {{flooding}} {{can lead}} to chronically wet houses, which are linked {{to an increase in}} respiratory problems and other illnesses. Urban flooding also has significant economic implications for affected neighborhoods. In the United States, industry <b>experts</b> <b>estimate</b> <b>that</b> wet basements can lower property values by 10–25 percent and are cited among the top reasons for not purchasing a home. According to the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), almost 40 percent of small businesses never reopen their doors following a flooding disaster. In the United States, insurance is available against flood damage to both homes and businesses.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, western oil <b>experts</b> <b>estimate</b> <b>that</b> Russia's seizing of Crimea, and the {{associated}} control of an area of Black Sea {{more than three times}} its land area gives it access to oil and gas reserves potentially worth trillions of dollars. It also deprives Ukraine of its chances of energy independence. Most immediately however, analysts say, Moscow's acquisition may alter the route along which the South Stream pipeline would be built, saving Russia money, time and engineering challenges. It would also allow Russia to avoid building in Turkish territorial waters, which was necessary in the original route to avoid Ukrainian territory.|$|E
25|$|<b>Experts</b> <b>estimate</b> <b>that</b> total {{spending}} on American military and non-military intelligence during the Cold War peaked at $71 billion (in 2013 dollars) {{in the late}} 1980s. By 1994 spending for the non-military National Intelligence Program (NIP) had declined to $43.4 billion. Fiscal 2013 intelligence spending exceeded the Cold War peak, at $52.6 billion for NIP and $23 billion for military intelligence programs. In constant dollars it is about double the estimated 2001 budget and 25% greater than the 2006 budget. From the September 11 attacks on the United States in 2001 to 2013, the government {{has spent more than}} $500 billion on intelligence.|$|E
50|$|Serbian {{organized}} crime <b>experts</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> 10,000 foot soldiers form {{a part of}} the 5 major {{organized crime}} groups operating in the country. A courier package of 5 kilos of cocaine was intercepted from Paraguay and 4 Belgraders were arrested. The busts were part of Operation Balkan Warrior; an international drug smuggling case that involves mainly the Zemun Clan. The leader of the drug ring is Željko Vujanović.|$|R
50|$|For {{a decade}} after World War II, there were no new {{population}} statistics released by the Soviet Union, and {{a proposal for a}} new Soviet census for 1949 was rejected by Soviet leader Joseph Stalin. During this time, most Western <b>experts</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> the population of the Soviet Union was between 215 and 220 million people, but in June 1956 (after Stalin's death), the Soviet government announced that the country's population at that point was only 200,200,000.|$|R
50|$|Currently {{control of}} barley scab {{is seen as}} a high priority, {{resulting}} in the U.S. National Wheat and Barley Scab Initiative. In 2005 alone North Dakota State <b>experts</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> scab cost the North Dakota farm economy $162 million and in 1993 it cost North Dakota, South Dakota, and Minnesota $1 billion. Fungicide trials in 2004 were promising. Results demonstrated that fungicide use reduced scab by 77-85%, reduced vomitoxin levels by 49-69%, and increased yields by 10-14%.|$|R
25|$|Hence, while {{initially}} considered safe, {{the drug}} was responsible for teratogenic deformities in children born after their mothers used it during pregnancies, prior to the third trimester. In November 1961, thalidomide {{was taken off the}} market due to massive pressure from the press and public. <b>Experts</b> <b>estimate</b> <b>that</b> the drug thalidomide led to the death of approximately 2,000 children and serious birth defects in more than 10,000 children, about 5,000 of them in West Germany. The regulatory authorities in East Germany did not approve thalidomide. One reason for the initially unobserved side effects of the drug and the subsequent approval in West Germany was that at that time drugs {{did not have to be}} tested for teratogenic effects. They had been tested on rodents only, as was usual at the time.|$|E
500|$|Casa Rinconada, {{isolated}} from the other central sites, sits to {{the south side of}} Chaco Wash, adjacent to a Chacoan road leading to a set of steep stairs that reached the top of Chacra Mesa. Its sole kiva stands alone, with no residential or support structures whatsoever; it did once have a [...] passageway leading from the underground kiva to several above-ground levels. Chetro Ketl, located near Pueblo Bonito, bears the typical 'D'-shape of many other central complexes. Begun between 1020 and 1050, its 450–550 rooms shared one great kiva. <b>Experts</b> <b>estimate</b> <b>that</b> it took 29,135man-hours to erect Chetro Ketl alone; Hewett estimated that it took the wood of 5,000 trees and 50 million stone blocks.|$|E
500|$|In Hungary, {{the belief}} in vampires has existed since the Middle Ages, and bloodthirsty creatures are {{mentioned}} all over the Inquisition's notes. In the 12th century, Hungarian inquisitors interrogated a pagan shaman during a trial {{in the city of}} Sárospatak, who claimed the existence of a demon, which was called [...] "izcacus" [...] (which means blood drinker). That demon was described as a wild entity that could eventually be called to destroy the enemies of the pagans. The Hungarian <b>experts</b> <b>estimate</b> <b>that</b> this word's origin dates back to the period before the Hungarians' arrival in Europe in 895. The word {{has its roots in the}} ancient Turkish language, with which the Hungarians made contact during the late 8th century in the regions between Asia and Europe.|$|E
50|$|Using a bulk timber {{panel system}} affects the carbon {{footprint}} {{of the building}} in three ways. Firstly, the production of cement produces 870 kg of carbon dioxide. This equates to 237 kg of carbon per tonne. The project's sustainability <b>expert</b> <b>estimates</b> <b>that</b> if this building were to be a concrete structure, it would contain approximately 950 cubic metres of concrete. This would require 285 tonnes of cement and would, therefore, produce approximately 67,500 kg of carbon.|$|R

They were cheered by approximately 1 million supporters, with an estimated 300,000 fans located around St George's Hall – the final destination of the parade. Business <b>experts</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> one in five workers took time off following the victory. It was also <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> Liverpudlians drank around 10,000 bottles of champagne after the match, with supermarket chain Sainsbury's stating: [...] "We've never seen anything like it. We would usually expect to sell this much champagne at Christmas".|$|R
50|$|<b>Experts</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> 25 to 40 cocaine semi-subs {{departed}} from South America in 2007, and expected that figure to double in 2008.The western Colombian shore topography is near ideal for transporting the cocaine produced in clandestine laboratories in nearby Nariño department. About {{a third of}} the 550 metric tonnes of cocaine coming out of Colombia each year leaves via the Pacific coast and a significant amount is being carried in semi-submersibles. The U.S. Homeland Security <b>estimates</b> <b>that</b> drug submarines now account for 32 percent of all maritime cocaine flow between Latin America and the United States.|$|R

2500|$|From 1822 the {{government}} began to recall the coins {{and replace them with}} sterling coinage. By the time the holey dollar was finally demonetised in 1829, most of the 40,000 coins in circulation had been exchanged for legal tender and melted down into bullion. [...] <b>Experts</b> <b>estimate</b> <b>that</b> only 350 Holey dollars and 1500 dumps remain. The rarity of the Australian holey dollar ensures that even those in relatively poor condition are valuable. There are many stories of holey dollars being found in unusual circumstances.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, moonshining was rampant {{throughout}} Southern Appalachia, and Cataloochee was no exception. [...] Some <b>experts</b> <b>estimate</b> <b>that</b> 95% of households in Cataloochee {{made their own}} whiskey, although most of this was for personal use. [...] Early settlers used whiskey as a remedy for various ailments {{and to help them}} work long hours during the summer. [...] During Prohibition, some of Cataloochee's poorer residents and small farmers supplemented their income by selling moonshine, which was in high demand. [...] The liquor was sold at Waynesville, and from there shipped as far away as New York City and Washington, D.C.|$|E
50|$|Officials <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> the government's {{decision}} to provide free service to publicsector institutions {{contributed to a}} 23 percent increase in publicsector consumption in 1990. <b>Experts</b> <b>estimated</b> <b>that</b> additional electrical generation capacity would likely be needed {{to keep pace with}} demand. The Honduran Congress assumed authority for setting electric prices beginning in 1986 but then became reluctant to increase rates. Under pressure from the World Bank, it did agree to a 60 percent increase in 1990, with additional increases in 1991. To offset these increased rates for residential users, the National Congress initiated a system of direct subsidies that ran through 1992.|$|R
