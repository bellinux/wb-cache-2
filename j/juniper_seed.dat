40|$|With a {{distribution}} range that covers {{most of the}} Northern hemisphere, common juniper (Juniperus communis) {{has one of the}} largest ranges of all vascular plant species. In several regions in Europe, however, populations are decreasing in size and number due to failing recruitment. One of the main causes for this failure is low seed viability. Observational evidence suggests that this is partly induced by climate warming, but our mechanistic understanding of this effect remains incomplete. Here, we experimentally assess the influence of temperature on two key developmental phases during sexual reproduction, i. e. gametogenesis and fertilisation (seed phase two, SP 2) and embryo development (seed phase three, SP 3). Along a latitudinal gradient from southern France to central Sweden, we installed a transplant experiment with shrubs originating from Belgium, a region with unusually low <b>juniper</b> <b>seed</b> viability. Seeds of both seed phases were sampled during three consecutive years, and seed viability assessed. Warming temperatures negatively affected the seed viability of both SP 2 and SP 3 seeds along the latitudinal gradient. Interestingly, the effect on embryo development (SP 3) only occurred in the third year, i. e. when the gametogenesis and fertilisation also took place in warmer conditions. We found strong indications that this negative influence mostly acts via disrupting growth of the pollen tube, the development of the female gametophyte and fertilisation (SP 2). This, in turn, can lead to failing embryo development, for example, due to nutritional problems. Our results confirm that climate warming can negatively affect seed viability of juniper...|$|E

30|$|Most {{hardwood}} {{species in}} the woodlands, including all oaks, resprout vigorously after being top-killed by fire (Reemts and Hansen 2008). A few species, such as prairie sumac (Rhus lanceolata [A. Gray] Britton), colonize burned areas primarily from seed, but can also resprout after fire (Rasmussen and Wright 1989). Ashe juniper does not resprout and, while small individuals can be killed by relatively low-intensity fires, larger individuals are killed only by high-intensity fires (Bryant et al. 1983, Fonteyn et al. 1988, Noel and Fowler 2007). Ashe <b>juniper</b> <b>seeds</b> are dispersed by birds and, to a lesser extent, some mammals, and dispersal is relatively inefficient (Chavez-Ramirez and Slack 1993, 1994). The woodland communities can successfully regenerate after a single fire, although regaining the original structure may take decades (Huss 1954, Gehlbach 1988).

40|$|In this study, the {{effectiveness}} of management measures aimed at promoting recruitment in the last large Flemish juniper population at Heiderbos is evaluated. We resurveyed demographic plots 23 years after their establishment in 1980 and linked the population changes with detailed records of the intensive management during the same period. Between 1980 and 2003 the population size has decreased by 36 % and has changed from a relatively immature to a mature population with very few young individuals. Based on a simple model that simulated height growth between 1980 and 2003, the recruitment and mortality rates were estimated to be 5 and 24 ha(- 1) yr(- 1) respectively. Intensive management has thus {{not been able to}} promote recruitment and the population might go extinct within 40 years if these rates remain unchanged. Furthermore, some measures, notably the working of the soil, have increased mortality of established junipers. The reasons for the limited recruitment are not entirely clear yet, but it may be due to a combination of the limited availability of bare ground for germination and the extremely low viability of <b>juniper</b> <b>seeds.</b> The latter fact may be a common characteristic of many threatened juniper populations in northwestern Europe.

40|$|Two {{moments in}} the course of {{vegetation}} processes taking place after the abandonment of formerly cultivated fields at the species rich alvar dry grasslands on the Baltic island of Oland (Sweden) were studied. After 50 years of natural restoration not all species had returned. Twelve missing species were sown into the field and the local species pool was investigated. Eleven species emerged and survived one growing season. Short-term establishment was possible and diaspore dispersal seems to be the limiting factor for species returning. In the local species pool occur 160 characteristic species, including all missing species. After 85 years Juniperus communis forms an almost closed woodland. The seed bank of small open places inside the woodland contained not more than 31 species in total. In the open places and in places {{at the edge of the}} woodland, flowering intensity and light availability were measured. Both were lower inside. Disappearance of grassland species in the open places seems to be initiated by a decreased reproduction due to less flowering caused by shadowing by the <b>junipers.</b> <b>Seed</b> production is decreased and the seed bank depleted. When shrub cutting is done as restoration measure, returning of species has to come from seed dispersal since only few species survive in the seed bank or vegetatively. Restoration of dispersal possibilities for plant species should be included in restoration measures of calcareous grasslands and other habitats. Artificial reintroduction is an option that should be considered more. This study is an example of research about the restoration processes in habitats related to traditional agricultural systems. More knowledge about these systems has to be gained in order to restore and maintain them. ...|$|R

40|$|Background and Aims: Environmental {{change is}} {{increasingly}} impacting ecosystems worldwide. However, our {{knowledge about the}} interacting effects of various drivers of global change on sexual reproduction of plants, one of their key mechanisms to cope with change, is limited. This study examines populations of poorly regenerating and threatened common juniper (Juniperus communis) to {{determine the influence of}} four drivers of global change (rising temperatures, nitrogen deposition, potentially acidifying deposition and altering precipitation patterns) on two key developmental phases during sexual reproduction, gametogenesis and fertilization (seed phase two, SP 2) and embryo development (seed phase three, SP 3), and on the ripening time of seeds. Methods: In 42 populations throughout the distribution range of common juniper in Europe, 11 943 seeds of two developmental phases were sampled. Seed viability was determined using seed dissection and related to accumulated temperature (expressed as growing degree-days), nitrogen and potentially acidifying deposition (nitrogen plus sulfur), and precipitation data. Key Results: Precipitation had no influence on the viability of the seeds or on the ripening time. Increasing temperatures had a negative impact on the viability of SP 2 and SP 3 seeds and decreased the ripening time. Potentially acidifying depositions negatively influenced SP 3 seed viability, while enhanced nitrogen deposition led to lower ripening times. Conclusions: Higher temperatures and atmospheric deposition affected SP 3 seeds more than SP 2 seeds. However, this is possibly a delayed effect as <b>juniper</b> <b>seeds</b> develop practically independently, due to the absence of vascular communication with the parent plant from shortly after fertilization. It is proposed that the failure of natural regeneration in many European juniper populations might be attributed to climate warming as well as enhanced atmospheric deposition of nitrogen and sulfur...|$|R

40|$|With a {{distribution}} range that covers {{most of the}} northern hemisphere, common juniper (Juniperus communis L.) {{has one of the}} largest distribution ranges of all plant species on earth. The last decades, however, multiple studies are reporting a significantly declining size and plummeting number of common juniper populations in many regions, including in the western European lowlands and the Mediterranean mountain regions. Failing recruitment {{is one of the main}} reasons for this decline. In many of the remaining European juniper populations, the percentage of viable seeds is extremely low, thereby limiting the chances for successful regeneration. However, also other reasons, such as the absence of microclimate suitable for germination and seedling establishment, can be responsible for the lack of recruitment. It was suggested that climate warming as well as enhanced atmospheric depositions can negatively affect <b>juniper’s</b> <b>seed</b> viability. However, the mechanisms behind these effects remain unclear. The aim of this thesis was to further our understanding of the effects of climate change (changing temperature and precipitation) and air pollution (atmospheric depositions of nitrogen and sulphur) on different phases of the sexual reproductive phase of common juniper. We focussed on three crucial seed phases: (seed phase 1, SP 1) the early gametophyte development and pollination; (seed phase 2, SP 2) further development of the gametophytes, fertilization and early embryo development; (seed phase 3, SP 3) late embryo development. The seed viability of populations with and without recruitment was compared. Only after SP 3, we found significant differences in seed viability between populations with and populations without recruitment. Hence, this made us conclude that late embryo development is the most crucial phase during seed development. However, anomalies during SP 2 can have a delayed effect on embryo development. Therefore, both seed phases were retained for further research. With both observational and experimental research we studied the effects of global environmental changes on seed viability. Overall, we found viability of SP 2 - and SP 3 -seedsto decrease with temperature. Enhanced atmospheric depositions were only negatively correlated with SP 3 -seed viability. There are different pathways through which these global-change drivers possibly elaborate their negative effects. For example, increasing temperatures can negatively affect the development and growth of the female gamethophyte and the pollen tube, the male-female synchrony in the pre-fertilization phases, the development of the megagametophyte and the nutrition and growth of the embryo. On the other hand, both atmospheric depositions and warming can cause nutrient imbalances. Although the ripening of the embryo (SP 3) was identified as the most vulnerable phase, we found strong indications that the actual reasons for low seed viability should be searched in the preceding processes. For example, our transplant experiment along a latitudinal gradient clearly showed that significant differences in seed viability between the temperature treatments only occurred if the seeds also experienced higher temperatures during SP 2. Hence, it is plausible that anomalies, induced by warming or enhanced atmospheric deposition, occur during the development of the female gametophyte (SP 2). However, their effects only manifested themselves in SP 3, for example, by leading to a malfunctioning megagametophyte that will not be able to nourish the developing embryo. In addition, with a germination experiment, we assessed ideal microclimatic soil conditions for germination and seedling establishment. We found that it is highly important that <b>juniper</b> <b>seeds</b> are in contact with mineral soil, with a sufficient amount of loam or organic matter, for successful germination. For example, sod cutting can create these conditions. To conclude, our findings highlight that common juniper, arguably one of the most iconic threatened tree species of Europe, is becoming a victim of global change. Successful recruitment in common juniper will only occur if the following conditions are met: enough viable seed must be available (e. g. during a colder period of several years) and enough microsites suitable for establishment must be present. The probability that microsites exist where these conditions (viable seeds and chances for establishment) occur at the same time increases in larger areas where the management is already suited for common juniper. Concerning the low seed viability, attention should be focused on locations where the microclimate is expected to be colder (e. g. northerly oriented slopes or the vicinity of small rivers) and where atmospheric depositions are lower (e. g. not too close to busy roads and/or farms). This work is also an extra call for policy makers to increase their efforts in reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases and reactive nitrogen...|$|R
50|$|The Cotswolds Dry Gin {{contains}} nine botanicals. The central three botanicals of the London Dry style, <b>juniper,</b> coriander <b>seed</b> and {{angelica root}} are macerated for 18 {{hours in the}} neutral base spirit (a rectified spirit at 96% ABV, made from wheat) and some water.

The use of fresh citrus zest is fairly unusual in gin production, where the less time-consuming use of dried zest is far more common. The use of the fresh zest means that the louche effect occurs when the gin is diluted or chilled; as the oils from the botanicals emulsify they give the gin a cloudy, pearlescent appearance.

Repeated summer prescribed fires can also reduce or eliminate junipers from a community (Ewing et al. 2005).

30|$|Oak-juniper (Quercus spp.-Juniperus spp.) {{woodlands}} in the Southwest are co-dominated by resprouters and seeders. Most oak species resprout vigorously after fire (Boyd and Bidwell 2002, Rodríguez-Trejo and Myers 2010) and can suppress regeneration of codominant seeding species (Haire and McGarigal 2008, Reemts and Hansen 2008). The dominant juniper species {{include both}} seeders and resprouters (Adams 2008). Many junipers can be top-killed by fire when small (Noel and Fowler 2007), but large individuals often survive prescribed fires (Ansley and Rasmussen 2005).

40|$|Greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus; sage-grouse) {{currently}} occupy {{an estimated}} 56 % {{of the potential}} range-wide pre-European settlement habitat. Population declines have been largely attributed to direct habitat loss and fragmentation related to anthropogenic activities that promote wildfires and the subsequent spread of invasive plants. Vegetation manipulations, including the seeding of plant species, such as forage kochia (Bassia prostrata), {{have been identified as}} potential strategies to mitigate the risk of wildfire and enhance sage-grouse habitat in areas at risk to wildfires. I evaluated the composition changes that occurred in a lower elevation sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) plant community within the Grouse Creek Watershed in western Box Elder County, Utah, USA, in response to prescribed vegetation manipulations (green-stripping through chain harrowing, <b>juniper</b> mastication, <b>seeding</b> forage kochia, applying Plateau® herbicide) and studied the effect of these changes on sage-grouse habitat-use patterns and vital rates. I monitored 53 radio-collared sage-grouse throughout the Grouse Creek watershed from 2010 - 2012. Seasonal movements suggested local individual bird adaptations to annual variations in weather and habitat fragmentation. Sage-grouse selected for untreated areas; however, treated areas were used to expand the size of the lek. Untreated areas exhibited a higher percent composition of shrubs compared to areas that were chain harrowed to prepare a seedbed. Sage-grouse nest success and adult male survival rates during this study were relatively low compared to range-wide population estimates. Nest predation was higher for nests located closer to roads. The forage kochia seeded in the firebreaks emerged the season after seeding (2011). Using microhistological techniques, I detected small quantities of forage kochia in sage-grouse fecal pellets. Nutrient analysis confirmed that forage kochia samples collected from the sites exhibited a high protein content and low secondary metabolite content, similar to black sagebrush (Artemisia nova). Although greenstripping with forage kochia in lower elevation sagebrush communities may prove to be a beneficial technique for protecting rangelands from wildfire and provide a dietary source for wildlife, site preparation should be conducted to minimize the impact on existing sagebrush canopy cover habitats. Long-term monitoring should be implemented to determine extended effects of greenstripping treatments on sagebrush habitat and sage-grouse vital rates. Although individual sage-grouse demonstrated local adaptations to fragmentation and seasonal variations in weather, increased fragmentation and climate change {{in this part of the}} Great Basin may increase meta-population extirpation risks inhabiting lower elevation sagebrush areas in the Grouse Creek Watershed...|$|R

Taking into account various microorganism susceptibility to ozone, it was of great importance to develop a sufficiently effective ozone dose to preserve food products using different strains based on the microbial model. For this purpose, we have chosen the Weibull model to describe the survival curves of different microorganisms. Based on the results of microorganism survival modelling after ozone treatment and considering the least susceptible strains to ozone, we selected the critical ones. Among tested strains, those from genus Bacillus were recognized as the most critical strains. In particular, B. subtilis and B. pumilus possessed the highest resistance to ozone treatment because the time needed to achieve the lowest level of its survival was the longest (up to 17. 04 min and 16. 89 min for B. pumilus reduction on juniper berry and cardamom seed matrix, respectively). Ozone treatment allow inactivate microorganisms to achieving lower survival rates by ozone dose (20. 0 g O 3 /m 3 O 2, with a flow rate of 0. 4 L/min) and contact time (up to 20 min).
