30|$|Many gene loci had <b>multiple</b> {{corresponding}} DNA <b>probes</b> on the array. Of the upregulated genes {{represented by}} <b>multiple</b> <b>probes</b> on the array, 54 showed varying expression patterns among the probes (Figure  1). The {{rest of the}} genes represented by <b>multiple</b> <b>probes</b> showed consistent expression patterns among the probes. For example, three probes on the array corresponded to the Os 11 g 0216900 gene (IDI 2). Two of the probes showed an expression pattern belonging to group B, and one probe showed expression belonging to group C (see Additional file 4). In such cases, different patterns were counted as representing different genes. Each result shown in the figures and tables was derived from data from one probe. In the case of genes with <b>multiple</b> <b>probes,</b> the result for the probe with the greater signal intensity was chosen. All numerical data, including those from other probes of the same gene locus, are presented in Additional file 4 : Table S 1. Some probes that satisfied our criteria for selection at one time point had an expression ratio ≥ 1.95 with low signal intensity (under 180 in the induced state) at another time point (e.g., Os 06 g 0639800 in Table  1). In classifying the upregulated genes (Figure  1), such data for certain time points for some genes were also classified as upregulated time points. In other results, the unsatisfied data are shown with notes.|$|R

40|$|We {{wanted to}} use a <b>multiple</b> <b>probes</b> and white light {{interferometer}} to measure the surface profile of thin film. However, this system, as assessed with a scanning method, suffers from {{the presence of a}} moving stage and systematic sensor errors. In this paper, in order to separate measurement error caused by the moving stage and systematic sensor errors, the least squares analysis is applied to achieve self-calibration in the measurement process. The modeling principle and resolution process of the least squares analysis with <b>multiple</b> <b>probes</b> and autocollimator are introduced and the corresponding theory uncertainty calculation method is also given. Using this method, we analysis the experimental data and obtain a shape close to the real file. Contrasting with the actual value, the bias and uncertainty in the case of different number of probes are discussed. The results demonstrated the feasibility of the constructed multi-ball cantilever system with the autocollimator for measuring thin film with high accuracy. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Interpretation of gene {{expression}} microarrays requires a mapping from probe set to gene. On many Affymetrix {{gene expression}} microarrays, a given gene may be detected by <b>multiple</b> <b>probe</b> sets, which may deliver inconsistent or even contradictory measurements. Therefore, obtaining an unambiguous expression estimate of a pre-specified gene {{can be a}} nontrivial but essential task. Results We developed scoring methods to assess each probe set for specificity, splice isoform coverage, and robustness against transcript degradation. We used these scores to select a single representative probe set for each gene, thus creating a simple one-to-one mapping between gene and probe set. To test this method, we evaluated concordance between protein measurements and gene expression values, and between sets of genes whose expression {{is known to be}} correlated. For both test cases, we identified genes that were nominally detected by <b>multiple</b> <b>probe</b> sets, and we found that the probe set chosen by our method showed stronger concordance. Conclusions This method provides a simple, unambiguous mapping to allow assessment of the expression levels of specific genes of interest. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background On {{most common}} {{microarray}} platforms many genes {{are represented by}} <b>multiple</b> <b>probes.</b> Although this is quite common no one has systematically explored the concordance between probes mapped to the same gene. Results Here we present an analysis of all the cases of <b>multiple</b> <b>probe</b> sets measuring the same gene on the Affymetrix U 133 a GeneChip and found that although {{in the majority of}} cases both measurements tend to agree there are a significant number of cases in which the two measurements differ from each other. In these cases the measurements can not be simply averaged but rather should be handled individually. Conclusion Our analysis allows us to provide a comprehensive list of the correlation between all pairs of probe sets that are mapped to the same gene and thus allows microarray users to sort out the cases that deserve further analysis. Comparison between the set of highly correlated pairs and the set of pairs that tend to differ from each other reveals potential factors that may affect it. </p...|$|R
