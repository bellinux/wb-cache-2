50|$|A {{misconception}} about <b>crumple</b> <b>zones</b> sometimes voiced is {{that they}} reduce safety for the occupants of the vehicle by allowing the body to collapse, therefore risking crushing the occupants. In fact, <b>crumple</b> <b>zones</b> are typically located in front of and behind {{the main body of}} the car (which forms a rigid 'safety cell'), compacting within the space of the engine compartment or boot/trunk. Modern vehicles using what are commonly termed 'crumple zones' provide far superior protection for their occupants in severe tests against other vehicles with <b>crumple</b> <b>zones</b> and solid static objects than older models or SUVs that use a separate chassis frame and have no <b>crumple</b> <b>zones.</b>|$|R
50|$|They {{do tend to}} {{come off}} worse when {{involved}} in accidents with SUVs without <b>crumple</b> <b>zones</b> {{because most of the}} energy of the impact is absorbed by the vehicle with the <b>crumple</b> <b>zone</b> — however, even for the occupants of the 'worse off' car, this will still often be an improvement — as the result of two vehicles without <b>crumple</b> <b>zones</b> colliding will usually be more hazardous to both vehicle's occupants than a collision that is at least partly buffered.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Recently, {{pedestrian}} protection related research topics have been actively studied by automotive designers and engineers {{due to the}} enhanced pedestrian protecting regulations. It is required to design an energy absorbing structure, such as <b>crumple</b> <b>zone</b> that can sufficiently absorb the impact energy to reduce the leg injury when accident happens. The structure is designed by reducing the height of front end module, considering the mounting location, and investigating impact characteristics. In this paper, {{the concept of the}} <b>crumple</b> <b>zone</b> was introduced {{and the role of the}} <b>crumple</b> <b>zone</b> was investigated by analyzing the performance of upper legform impact to a bonnet leading edge test, and the design process was suggested...|$|R

50|$|The <b>crumple</b> <b>zone</b> is a {{structural}} feature mainly used in automobiles and recently incorporated into railcars.|$|R
50|$|For safety reasons {{all modern}} cars feature a {{collapsible}} steering column (energy absorbing steering column) which will collapse {{in the event of}} a heavy frontal impact to avoid excessive injuries to the driver. Airbags are also generally fitted as standard. Non-{{collapsible steering column}}s fitted to older vehicles very often impaled drivers in frontal crashes, particularly when the steering box or rack was mounted in front of the front axle line, at the front of the <b>crumple</b> <b>zone.</b> This was particularly a problem on vehicles that had a rigid separate chassis frame, with no <b>crumple</b> <b>zone.</b> Most modern vehicle steering boxes/racks are mounted behind the front axle on the front bulkhead, at the rear of the front <b>crumple</b> <b>zone.</b>|$|R

These crates are not intended for use on airplanes or for carrying pets outside of vehicles. They also do not make good housebreaking crates.|$|R

5000|$|The 2004 Pininfarina Nido Experimental Safety Vehicle locates <b>crumple</b> <b>zones</b> {{inside the}} {{survival}} cell. Those interior <b>crumple</b> <b>zones</b> decelerate a sled-mounted survival cell.Volvo {{has also been}} developing this idea for use in small cars. Their driver's seat is mounted to what is basically a 'sled' on a rail, with shock absorbers in front of it. In an impact, the whole [...] "sled" [...] of driving seat and belted in driver, slides forward up to 8 inches, and the shock absorbers dissipate the peak shock energy of the impact, lengthening the deceleration time for the driver. Simultaneously, {{the steering wheel and}} the driver's side dashboard slide forward {{to make room for the}} driver, as he is thrown forwards stretching the seatbelt. Combined with a front <b>crumple</b> <b>zone</b> and airbag, this system could greatly reduce the forces acting on the driver in a frontal impact.|$|R
50|$|For safety considerations, {{in modern}} cars {{the fuel tank}} is usually located ahead of the rear axle, out of the <b>crumple</b> <b>zones</b> of the car.|$|R

5000|$|Mercedes-Benz {{emerged from}} World War II as an automaker {{in the early}} 1950s with the {{expensive}} 300 Adenauers and the exclusive 300SL grand tourers that gained it fame, {{but it was the}} simple unibody Pontons comprised the bulk of the company's revenues. Work began in earnest on the Ponton cars in 1951 with a design focused on passenger comfort and safety. Their as an urgency to replace the dated pre war designed W136 Type 170. Head of the design team was Dr. Fritz Nallinger. Styling was headed by Karl Wilfert. Daimler-Benz incorporated into the design criteria a unitary body frame body, based on the [...] "three-box design". Part of the design team was Béla Barényi. Barényi designed the concept of the <b>crumple</b> <b>zone,</b> and the non-deformable passenger cell into the design. The <b>crumple</b> <b>zones</b> patent 854157, granted in 1952, describes the decisive feature of passive safety. Barényi questioned the opinion prevailing until then, that a safe car had to be rigid. He divided the car body into three sections: the rigid non-deforming passenger compartment and the <b>crumple</b> <b>zones</b> during collision. This design concept was proven by ADAC crash test facility in June, 2010 when a Mercedes Ponton was crash tested in their Technical Centre in Landsberg am Lech, confirming the existence of the design incorporated into the vehicle. This made for a milestone in car design with front and rear <b>crumple</b> <b>zones</b> for absorbing kinetic energy on impact.|$|R
50|$|When {{a vehicle}} is {{hit on the}} side by another vehicle, the <b>crumple</b> <b>zones</b> of the {{striking}} vehicle will absorb some of the kinetic energy of the collision. The <b>crumple</b> <b>zones</b> of the struck vehicle may also absorb some of the collision's energy, particularly if the vehicle is not struck on its passenger compartment. Both vehicles are frequently turned from their original directions of travel. If the collision is severe, the struck vehicle may be spun or rolled over, potentially causing it to strike other vehicles, objects, or pedestrians. After the collision, the involved vehicles may be stuck together by the folding of their parts around each other.|$|R

50|$|Typically, <b>crumple</b> <b>zones</b> {{are located}} in the front part of the vehicle, in order to absorb the impact of a head-on collision, though they may be found on other parts of the vehicle as well. According to a British Motor Insurance Repair Research Centre study of where on the vehicle impact damage occurs: 65% were front impacts, 25% rear impacts, 5% left side, and 5% right side. Some racing cars use aluminium, composite/carbon fibre honeycomb, or energy {{absorbing}} foam to form an impact attenuator that dissipates crash energy using a much smaller volume and lower weight than road car <b>crumple</b> <b>zones.</b> Impact attenuators have also been introduced on highway maintenance vehicles in some countries.|$|R
