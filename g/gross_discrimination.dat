The early detection {{of biological}} warfare agents (BWAs) in atmosphere is a huge challenge that could be addressed through UV-LIF (Ultra Violet Laser Induced Fluorescence) techniques. Fluorescence measurements of aerosol particles can provide <b>gross</b> <b>discrimination</b> between bio-agents and atmospheric background particles, In this work we intend to investigate the capability of discriminating among different biological warfare agents (BWA) through {{the analysis of the}} optical emission spectra. To accomplish this task, a deep knowledge of fluorescence features with different boundary conditions is required, {{in order to create a}} database of comparable spectral fingerprints. Preliminary results, obtained through a laboratory setup with a standard UV lamp source, showed that significant differences can be appreciated among BWAs simulants' spectra (Figure 1).

Such a procedure corrects for degree and severity of brain injury in addition to premorbid levels of intelligence. Alternative measures such as education are suggested, which can be employed as a covariate controlling for premorbid intelligence.

Petrographic analyses allowed us to interpret the absorption features in compositional terms. Spectral and petrographic classes coincided when the principal mineralogy was also spectrally dominant (e. g. in carbonate rocks). When the principal mineralogy did not produce diagnostic spectral features (e. g. in siliceous rocks in the visible-short wave infrared region), the classification was based on spectrally dominant secondary phases. The reflectance spectra were measured on both freshly cut and exposed surfaces of the samples. Apart from a few cases of spectral features obliteration due to kaolinization, or overall albedo change related to texture variation, the two sets of spectra did not significantly differ. The responses of airborne MIVIS and AVIRIS hyperspectral sensors were simulated from spectra representative of the spectral classes, showing that significant identification and classification of well exposed metamorphic rocks are potentially possible using remote instruments providing high quality spectra. Although at present there are no plans for a spaceborne instrument of this quality, TM simulations and band composite images showed that a preliminary <b>gross</b> <b>discrimination</b> of the rocks belonging to the different classes was however possible...|$|E

Examination of temporal resolution and discharge history revealed advantages in discrimination from both dependent (connectivity) and independent (bursting) interspike interval properties. We found the average synergy (information {{greater than that}} summed from the individual neurons) was 50 % for fine discrimination of orientation and 25 % for spatial frequency and < 10 % for <b>gross</b> <b>discrimination</b> of both orientation and spatial frequency. Dependency (Kullback-Leibler "distance " between the actual responses and two wholly independent responses) was measured between pairs of neurons while varying orientation, spatial frequency, and contrast. In general, dependency was more selective to spatial parameters than was firing rate. Variation of dependence against spatial frequency corresponded to variation of burst rate, and was even narrower than burst rate tuning for orientation. We also found a gradual decline (adaptation) of dependency overtime that is faster for lower contrasts and which is likely {{a result of the}} decrease in isolated (non-burst) spikes. The results suggest that salient information is more strongly represented in bursts, but that isolated spikes also have a role in transferring this information between neurons. The dramatic influence of burst length modulation on both synaptic efficacy and dependency around the peak orientation leads to substantial cooperation that can improve discrimination in this region...|$|E

Black males actually enjoy faster growth of employment share in unionized plants, suggesting that Title VII has been effective in increasing opportunities for blacks. This may help explain why unionization, though decreasing in the private sector, has been increasing among blacks. The role played by unions in mediating affirmative action regulations is also examined. There are significant differences across particular unions, especially between craft and industrial unions, within industries that correspond with each union's public record on EEO. Black employment increasesmost rapidly in industries with a long history of black employment, in plants organized by unions that take a liberal position towards EEO, and in industries with a large union wage effect. As least in California manufacturing during this period,the belief that unions have hindered minority and female employment does not seem to hold true for industrial unions. ...|$|R

These so-called hard drug users were asked about their current involvement with six categories of human services — homeless shelters, food pantries or soup kitchens, medical services, government financial assistance, drug self-help groups, and miscellaneous services. The findings suggest that drug users are active consumers of human services; nearly 90 percent reported current involvement. The average number of services used was more than three per person. Results of multivariate analyses suggest that a host of variables influence the type and number of services used. The study found no <b>gross</b> patterns of <b>discrimination.</b> It is concluded that more information is needed about how hard drug users interact with the human services system and that expectations of what the human services system is capable of accomplishing need to be re-evaluated...|$|R

We model sex discrimination as the complete exclusion of females from {{the labor market}} or as the exclusion of females from managerial positions. The former implies a reduction in GDP per capita; the latter distorts the allocation of talent and lowers economic growth. Both imply lower female-to-male schooling ratios. Our model predicts a convex relationship between nondiscrimination and growth. Although discrimination is difficult to measure, it will be reflected in schooling differentials. We present evidence based on cross-country regressions {{that is consistent with}} a convex relationship between schooling differentials and growth.

40|$|As {{contents}} for visuohaptic {{rendering of}} virtual objects {{continue to be}} developed, the need will soon arise {{for the protection of}} visuohaptic media from illegal reproduction. Until very recently, digital watermarking has been concerned with only visual and audio contents. Several studies on visuohaptic watermarking demonstrated that the haptic sensory channel is sometimes more sensitive to watermarks embedded in a triangular mesh data structure than the visual channel. This attests to the need to extend current state-of-the-art visual 3 D watermarking techniques to visuohaptic algorithms where the sensorimotor capabilities of the haptic channel are taken into account. This dissertation presents a series of studies towards the development of roughness-adaptive visuohaptic 3 D watermarking techniques. In the first study, a roughness-adaptive visual watermarking scheme is presented that adaptively maximizes watermark strength based on local surface roughness. It takes advantage of the fact that a rougher surface patch can mask a stronger watermark than a smoother surface patch. A visual perception study was conducted to quantify watermark perceptibility as a function of surface roughness. It was found that the maximum watermark strength for invisibility is linearly related to measured surface roughness: the rougher the host surface, the stronger the watermark that can be successfully hidden. The stronger watermarks in turn contribute to improved robustness of watermarks. In the second study, the roughness-adaptive watermarking approach was extended to include the haptic sensory modality. A perception study was conducted to estimate watermark detection thresholds under vision alone, touch alone and visuohaptic conditions. The results showed that watermark detection threshold was determined by the visual channel (i. e., vision is more sensitive) at rougher surface patches, and by the haptic channel (i. e., touch is more sensitive) at smoother surface patches. The third study sought to equalize the extent of shading during the visual and haptic rendering of 3 D objects, in order to achieve a more general approach to visuohaptic watermarking. A new approach based on spherigon smoothing is adapted to up-sample 3 D triangular meshes to achieve the same smoothing for both visual and haptic rendering. A human perception study showed that watermark strength can be increased by 5 to 26 times depending on local surface roughness while preserving imperceptibility. The increase in watermark strength led to 309 % increase in robustness as compared with the second study. Finally, we examined the potential of inserting watermarks by altering the gross shape of 3 D objects as opposed to surface details. It was found that vision is dominant in 3 D <b>gross</b> shape <b>discrimination</b> in that the visuohaptic thresholds were similar to the visual thresholds. These studies exemplify the use of human perception data in specifying watermark strengths. The findings form the foundation for future development of 3 D visuohaptic watermarking schemes that can have exciting applications in cultural heritage preservation, entertainment and commerce. ...|$|R
40|$|Within the United States of America, the LGBT {{community}} has suffered not only <b>gross</b> levels of <b>discrimination</b> and victimization, this community {{continues to this}} day to suffer a level of inequality that puts into question the nation’s commitment to liberal democratic principles, such as human, political, and civil rights. From the Stonewall Riots of the 1960 s to the legalization of same-sex marriage in 13 states throughout the Republic, the LGBT {{community has}} had to struggle immensely to be recognized as a group of citizens who are equally deserving of the freedoms and rights allotted to all Americans. Nevertheless, same-sex couples in the majority of states within the United States of America are banned from entering the public institution of marriage. The disparity on the recognition of same-sex marriage is a violation of the Freedom of Internal Movement guaranteed by the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV, Section 2 of the US Constitution, as well as, the Privileges or Immunities Clause in the Fourteenth Amendment of the same. This paper examines the concept of liberal democracy and liberal democratic values. It establishes that freedom of internal mobility is inherent to a liberal democracy. Then, I conduct an analysis of the importance of internal mobility within the United States through the review of a Supreme Court case; this later provides the basis necessary to analyze the four states with four levels of recognition of same-sex marriage. These four states are: South Carolina (constitutional ban), New Mexico (no prohibition, nor recognition), New Jersey (civil unions) and New York (marriage equality). The reality established by the different levels of recognition of same-sex marriage is one that is unique to the LGBT community because it creates two costs of mobility from which heterosexual couples are exempt. These two costs are a lack of access to benefits available through marriage and a condition of restricted autonomy. This paper shows that the costs same-sex couples must face are due to invidious discrimination and do not constitute a compelling government interest for the states that have a ban on same-sex marriage; therefore, it represents a sort of institutionalization of inequality for a group of Americans who met all other requirements to obtain a marriage license. As a result, the disparity among states on the recognition of same-sex marriage impedes on American same-sex couples’right to migrate freely throughout the Republic, rendering this disparity as unconstitutional...|$|R
40|$|This article {{considers}} {{whether a}} successful employment discrimination plaintiff may be entitled, under current law, {{to receive an}} augmented award (a gross up) to neutralize certain adverse federal income tax consequences. The question of whether such a gross up is allowed, the resolution of which can have drastic effects on litigants, has received almost no attention from practitioners, judges, and academics. Because of the potentially enormous impact of {{the alternative minimum tax}} (AMT) on discrimination lawsuit recoveries, however, the gross up issue is now beginning to appear in reported cases. The three principal federal anti-discrimination statutes - Title VII, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) - generally confer broad equitable powers on the courts to devise remedies that will make the victims of discrimination whole in economic terms. The Internal Revenue Code (Code), however, sometimes operates to frustrate this make-whole objective by taxing a discrimination award more heavily than the components of the award would have been taxed had the components been earned in due course by the plaintiff. This excess taxation gives rise to what this article calls adverse tax consequences. A discrimination plaintiff may suffer adverse tax consequences in two distinct ways. First, amounts recovered to compensate for back pay and front pay losses may be subjected to higher income tax rates than if such amounts had been earned as wages in due course. This increase in tax rates is typically {{due to the fact that}} the plaintiff 2 ̆ 7 s recovery is in a lump sum; as a result, a portion of the recovery may be subject to marginal rates higher than the plaintiff 2 ̆ 7 s typical marginal rate. Second, an employment discrimination recovery could implicate the AMT. If so, the AMT may cause the recovery to be effectively taxed at rates significantly higher than the top marginal rate of 35 percent. In fact, in certain cases, the AMT may cause the tax on the recovery to exceed 100 percent - meaning that a victorious plaintiff would owe more in taxes than her recovery. This AMT trap is notoriously absurd as a matter of tax policy and undermines the national policy of encouraging the pursuit of meritorious civil rights claims. Yet, the trap persists, at least in most areas of the country. The resolution of the gross up issue depends ultimately on whether the federal anti-discrimination remedial provisions permit judges to shift the liability for these adverse tax consequences from the plaintiff - on whom the Internal Revenue Code specifically imposes the liability - to the defendant - whose unlawful conduct necessitated the lawsuit that caused the adverse taxconsequences. The potential vehicle for this shift is the broad equitable powers conferred upon courts to fashion relief in order to make victims of discrimination whole. The issue of whether these broad equitable powers allow judges to shift a portion of the plaintiff 2 ̆ 7 s federal income tax liability to defendants is particularly interesting since both the plaintiff 2 ̆ 7 s tax liability and the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s discrimination liability arise from federal statutes passed by Congress. Thus, the resolution of the issue depends on which body of statutes, the Internal Revenue Code or the pertinent federal anti-discrimination statute, prevails over the other. More generally, though, the issue concerns the courts 2 ̆ 7 willingness to delve into federal income tax matters and focus on after-tax dollars, which are meaningful, rather than pre-tax dollars, which are meaningless. Courts typically have been reluctant to get their hands dirty with tax law if they can avoid it. Determining after-tax income can be a painstaking process and predicting future after-tax income even more so. Nevertheless, we conclude that courts have the authority to provide <b>gross</b> ups to <b>discrimination</b> plaintiffs and should exercise this authority whenever adverse tax consequences are substantial...|$|R
