Force One Pro Wrestling held its inaugural event, [...] "Pledge of Allegiance", on May 19, 2007, in Egg Harbor City, New Jersey, with Cairo, (in his capacity as commissioner) crowning Heavyweight Champion Breaker Morant and Junior Heavyweight Champion White Lotus. [...] In late 2009, Cairo resigned from Force One Pro Wrestling as well, turning the promotion over to Diego DeMarco (James Pilman) & former student turned wrestler Johnny Calzone (John Short), who took the promotion in a different direction, renaming the promotion Force 1 Pro, who ran shows in the same venues as the old Force One. Cairo returned to the business in 2011 with Coastal Pro Wrestling (again with former partner Phil Varlese, and with former NWA official Fred [...] "Richards" [...] Rubenstein). Coastal signed on as a National Wrestling Allince affiliate, and eventually a licensee, but broke away a year later due to differences with the ownership of the NWA. Cairo eventually split from Coastal after a 2-year run, and ran several shows under the Global 1 Pro Wrestling banner, before leaving the wrestling business again in 2013.|$|E

40|$|International audienceNon-covalent {{interactions}} between halopyridine substrates and catalytically inert building blocks, namely zinc(II) –porphyrins and zinc(II) –salphens, influence the catalytic outcome of Suzuki–Miyaura and Mizoroki–Heck palladi-um-catalysed cross-coupling reactions. The weak Zn···N {{interactions between}} halopyridine substrates and zinc(II) -containing porphyrins and salphens, respectively, were studied {{by a combination}} of 1 HNMR spectroscopy, UV/Vis studies, Job-Plot analysis and, in some cases,X-ray diffraction studies. Additionally,t <b>he</b> <b>former</b> studies revealed unique supramolecular polymeric and dimeric rearrangements in the solid state featuring weak B r···N (halogen bonding), C-H···p, B r···p and p···p interactions. The reactivity of halopyridine substrates in homogeneous palladium-catalysed cross-coupling reactions was found to correlate with the binding strength between the zinc(II) -containing scaffolds and the corresponding halo-pyridine. Such observation is explained by the unfavourable formation of inactive over-coordinated halopyridine···palladium species. The presented approach is particularly appealing for those cases in which substrates and/or products deactivate (or partially poison) a transition-metal catalyst...|$|E
40|$|Treball de fi de màster en Lingüística Teòrica i AplicadaTutor: Josep QuerWhile {{spoken and}} signed {{languages}} express linguistic meaning through distinct modalities – t <b>he</b> <b>former</b> {{makes use of}} the audiooral modality, whereas the second operates through the visualgestural modality– both build meaningful structures through phonological systems composed of meaningless substructure units. When the process of second language acquisition involves learning to communicate in the other modality, one must acquire a new phonological system. Some {{research has been conducted}} on the subject, but it has not yet been asked what role phonological knowledge might play in the acquisition process that takes place when hearing/nadults attempt to acquire a sign language. The present paper considers this issue, and through a pilot study attempts {{to examine the effects of}} the activation of phonological knowledge on perception and production accuracy of sign parameters. Additionally, a proposal for a future study is made, with the added goal of investigating the pedagogical methods of sign language as a second language...|$|E

40|$|Quantitative {{limonite}} mapping {{within the}} leached capping of the porphyry copper deposit at La Escondida, Chile, permits {{reconstruction of the}} paleohydrologic and chemical evolution of a well-developed supergene ore-forming system. The mineralogy, textures, and relative abundance of supergene limonite minerals (hematite, goethite, and jarosite) are used to re-construct <b>he</b> <b>former</b> ratio of pyrite to chalcocite and the preoxidation copper grade based on empirical imonite sulfide correlations (after Locke, 1926; Blanchard, 1968; and Loghry, 1972). Estimates of preoxidation copper grades in surface exposures and tops of drill holes at La Escondida are significantly lower than actual copper grades in the underlying enrichment blanket at depth. This apparent inconsistency is explained by a progressive increase in the copper grade of the sulfide enrichment blanket as it descended to its present location {{in response to a}} descending water table. This systematic trend of reconstructed grades of su-pergene-enriched copper sulfide increasing with depth offers the first quantitative proof of cumulative downward enrichment in a supergene profile, as proposed by Locke (1926). The consistent trends of limonite mineralogy and abundance in vertical profiles indicate that water table descent at La Escondida was relatively continuous in space, although not necessarily in time. Evidence for cumulative downward enrichment in vertical profiles through leached capping allows quantitative analysis of chemical mass balance in dynamic supergene systems. Slopes of linear regressions for profiles of reconstructed enriched copper grades vs. depth indicate lateral fluxes into or out of a given vertical profile. This method provides independent veri-fication of conclusions from a previous study of copper mass balance at La Escondida (Brimhall et al., 1985) which showed that lateral fluxes of copper were a significant factor during su-pergene leaching and enrichment...|$|E
40|$|Summary. Zonal myrmekitic and granophyric ntergrowths in {{plagioclase}} and K-feldspar phenocrysts are described. There are {{two such}} zones in the feldspars of the Late Granite, G 2, {{but only one}} in the Early Granite, G 1. The zonal granophyric intergrowths are the end-product ofthe replacement of myrmekitic plagioclases by K-feldspar. Transitional stages of this replacement, which took place in the solid state, are represented in numerous examples. The zones of myrmekite, which also represent growth in the solid state, occur between zones of magmatie plagioclase, which is oscillatory-zoned. It is concluded that the granites evolved at depth under the influence of at least hree phases of volcanic activity. Each of these phases re-sulted in the partial melting of the country rocks with subsequent magmatic crys-tallization, followed further, under the slow cooling conditions, by extensive r action in the solid state. During each of the final two phases, some of the granite was in-truded as a crystal mush to form G 1 and G 2, in which the phenocrysts retain evi-dence of their evolution at depth whilst the ground-mass gives evidence of the final magmatic crystallization. UNDY is the southernmost si e of igneous activity in the Atlantic Tertiary province. The island is composed primarily of granite although a group of Palaeozoic slates, into which the granite was emplaced, outcrop {{at the southern end of}} the island. A swarm of Tertiary basalt and trachyte dykes cuts both granite and slate. Dollar (1941) has made the most recent field study of the granite and concluded that there are two distinct granites. The earlier, GI, is domed up and broken by the later, G 2, which shows a chilled margin against <b>he</b> <b>former.</b> There is also a late dyke phase, G 3.
