40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} service <b>design</b> <b>cases</b> by online service companies and suggests framework to understand service design of them. Background: Recently, exploratory service <b>design</b> <b>cases</b> by online service companies such as Google, Apple, and NHN has been developed. Service design and online service experience design has been booming among user experience professionals but these two areas are not clearly defined. It is interesting to study the definition and key factors of service design and online service experience design. Moreover, investigating service <b>design</b> <b>cases</b> by online service companies is needed. Method: Due to diversification of service <b>design</b> <b>cases</b> by online service companies, this study has reviewed online resources and literatures about top 5 online service companies in USA and Korea. Furthermore, this study used expert interview who worked for service design at NHN. To understand the attributes of service <b>design</b> <b>cases,</b> this study developed 3 types of service design classifications scheme such as service design as extension of online service, space design and event service design. Finally, this study suggested a new framework for service <b>design</b> <b>cases.</b> Results: This study investigated service <b>design</b> <b>cases</b> by online service companies and suggests key issues and frameworks to uncover service design for online service. Conclusion: Service <b>design</b> <b>cases</b> for online service was analyzed by 2 * 2 matrix(extension, enrichment*product, service) to explain characteristics and attributes. NHN's Knowledge-iN bookshelf at NHN library 1 is a unique form of service design as a tool of enrichment of online experience. Application: The results of this study migh...|$|R

40|$|Teaching {{architectural}} design is not {{primarily concerned with}} presenting a body of knowledge analytically, but rather with influencing the way students act in a design situation. Previous <b>design</b> <b>cases</b> play {{an important part in}} this process, as they provide students with sets of objectives and corresponding solution patterns. Nevertheless, one of the main problems with using precedents in the design studio is that students take them rather as models to be copied than as starting points for their own research. To overcome this problem, the representation of <b>design</b> <b>cases</b> has to be improved. Our thesis is that in {{architectural design}} the structure of a <b>case</b> base of <b>design</b> precedents relies to a large extent on the various, and often conflicting, interpretations of precedents that are provided by architectural theory and discourse. Within a theory of design where exploration is the dominant strategy, we propose a method of using <b>design</b> <b>cases</b> and <b>design</b> theories in an integrated way. Through the use of hypermedia as a medium for representation of <b>design</b> <b>cases,</b> the process of looking for information can be based on the same metaphor as the design process itself...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{deals with}} two important issues in Case-based Design (CBD) : {{a structure of}} <b>design</b> <b>cases</b> and a process of design adaptation for handling design failures. The structure of <b>design</b> <b>cases</b> involves problem situation, design specification, design tasks, design solutions, causal explanation, past design failures as well as design performance. It has been noticed that how to represent a structure of <b>design</b> <b>cases</b> {{and how it can}} be used in actual a process of design adaptation process are important in Case-based Design. Adaptation process in Case-based Design is also critcial, especially in handling design failures. The description and the analysis of design adaptation process in the context of Case-based Design paradigm is the major focus of this research. A model of casual explanation is presented as an useful tool for identifying sources of design failures. For efficiently handling design failures based on causal explanation, it is essential to characterize various design failures and to devise an adequate structure of adaptation process. Applicability of adaptation process is demonstrated in an exemplary kitchen layout...|$|R

The optimisation model was formulated using the FICO™ Xpress optimisation suite. The objective of optimisation was to minimise the annual total energy consumption and costs.
