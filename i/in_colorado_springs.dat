In May 1888 he left the Hawaiian Islands for the United States for his health. Settling <b>in</b> <b>Colorado</b> <b>Springs,</b> Colorado, he initially wrote home stating that he was improving, but his condition worsened. His brother Theodore traveled all the way from Hawaii to see him for the last time before he died on August16, 1888. He was 31 {{years old at the time}} of his death. His brother-in-law Edmund William Holdsworth was chosen as administrator of his estate; Purvis' will, written on April22, left everything to his brother Theodore Purvis. His remains were interred in the Evergreen Cemetery <b>in</b> <b>Colorado</b> <b>Springs.</b>|$|E

Each year since 1968, the United States Air Force Academy alumni association bestows the Jabara Award upon the Academy graduate whose accomplishments demonstrate superior performance in fields directly involved with aerospace vehicles.

5|$|In 1955, an {{advertisement}} encouraging children to call Santa Claus over a special telephone number was printed <b>in</b> <b>Colorado</b> <b>Springs,</b> Colorado.

5|$|Shortly after {{negotiations}} with the union ended, the mine owners met secretly with Sheriff Bowers <b>in</b> <b>Colorado</b> <b>Springs.</b> They told Bowers they intended to bring in hundreds of nonunion workers, {{and asked if he}} could protect such a large force of men. Bowers said he could not, for the county lacked the financial resources to pay and arm more than a few deputies. The mine owners offered to subsidize an initial force of a hundred or so men. Bowers agreed, and immediately began recruiting ex-police and ex-firefighters from Denver.|$|E
5|$|The Cray-3 was {{originally}} slated for delivery in 1991. This was {{during a time}} when the supercomputer market was rapidly shrinking from 50% annual growth in 1980, to 10% in 1988. At the same time, Cray Research was also working on the Y-MP, a faster multi-processor version of the system architecture tracing its ancestry to the original Cray-1. In order to focus the Y-MP and Cray-3 groups, and with Cray's personal support, the Cray-3 project moved to a new research center <b>in</b> <b>Colorado</b> <b>Springs.</b>|$|E

Shortly thereafter, the corporate headquarters in Minneapolis decided to end work on the Cray-3 in favor of another design, the Cray C90. In 1989 the Cray-3 effort was spun off to a newly formed company, Cray Computer Corporation (CCC).|$|E

5|$|After the convention, Willkie {{returned}} to New York. When {{he went to}} the movies, he received a standing ovation, as he did when he went to see the play Life With Father. He resigned from C on July 8, 1940, confident that even if he lost his presidential bid, he would not lack for work. He had Republican National Committee (RNC) chairman John Hamilton dismissed on the advice of some of his advisors, who felt Hamilton was too conservative and isolationist, though the former chairman was given the post of executive director with partial responsibility for the Willkie campaign. Congressman Martin became RNC chair. At a time when little campaigning was done until after Labor Day, Willkie left on a five-week working vacation to The Broadmoor, a resort <b>in</b> <b>Colorado</b> <b>Springs,</b> but found neither peace nor privacy.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{extensive}} damage resulting from the hurricane, where the Hornets would play for the 2005–06 season came into question. Although the New Orleans Arena suffered only slight damage, the flooding surrounding the area {{made it impossible to}} use. With the training camp scheduled to begin on October 4, the team announced that the first three weeks of camp would be held at the Air Force Academy <b>in</b> <b>Colorado</b> <b>Springs,</b> Colorado, instead of their usual location, Alario Center in Westwego. Additionally the team stated that they wanted to play home games within Louisiana, at either the Pete Maravich Assembly Center or the Rivercenter in Baton Rouge. On September 3, Hornets owner George Shinn stated that the storm would not be used as a reason to permanently relocate the franchise.|$|E
5|$|During the {{peregrine}} falcon decline, Houle studied biology at Colorado College <b>in</b> <b>Colorado</b> <b>Springs.</b> The institution's block scheduling system meant that Houle had fewer classes each day, {{allowing her to}} travel frequently to experience various ecosystems {{in addition to her}} academic studies. Upon leaving college, Houle began working for the Colorado Division of Wildlife, and her first field assignment was to observe {{peregrine falcon}} activity along the Rocky Mountains for four summers, two of which were spent at Chimney Rock. Following her experience with the peregrine falcons, Houle had to decide whether to continue pursuing wildlife biology or to commit instead to her passion of writing. Wings for My Flight combined both of Houle's interests; it recounted her observations of the peregrines as well as her interaction with the community at Chimney Rock during her first summer there.|$|E

5|$|Ellis {{defeated}} Betterman 2 to 0 at {{the finals}} of the 2012 U.S. Olympic Trials. Coleman had attended Betterman's wrestling clinics {{when he was}} younger. Coleman is {{the youngest member of}} the American wrestling delegation going to the Olympics. After Coleman qualified for the Olympics, he realized that his mother, who works in customer service for the Illinois State Toll Highway Authority, could not afford to attend due to financial hardship. Coleman was living at the United States Olympic Training Center <b>in</b> <b>Colorado</b> <b>Springs</b> on a limited monthly stipend from the United States Olympic Committee and could not assist her. Powell rented Coleman's family a one-bedroom flat in London out of personal funds and the Oak Park High School wrestling program subsequently raised $14,000 to ensure that his mother, aunt and siblings could attend. Coleman dropped from the 66kg division to the 60kg division for the Olympics. Coleman lost {{in the first round of}} Olympic competition to Ivo Angelov of Bulgaria by a 31 score.|$|E
5|$|The Liberty Head nickel was {{replaced}} after 1912, and initially {{there was no}} indication that 1913-dated pieces with that design existed. In December 1919, a coin dealer, Samuel W. Brown, placed advertisements in coin publications, offering to buy 1913 Liberty Head nickels. The following August, Brown appeared at the annual American Numismatic Association (ANA) convention bearing such a piece. Brown claimed that a master die had been prepared for 1913 and that these pieces had been run off to test it. As it turned out, Brown possessed five coins, which he eventually sold. After spending fifteen years {{in the hands of the}} eccentric Col. E.H.R. Green, the famous Fort Worth, Texas, area collector, the coins were finally dispersed in 1943. Since then, they have had several owners each. Today, two are on public display—at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington and the ANA's Money Museum <b>in</b> <b>Colorado</b> <b>Springs,</b> while three are owned privately. The most recent sale of a 1913 Liberty Head nickel was in January 2010, when one sold for $3,737,500 in an auction.|$|E
