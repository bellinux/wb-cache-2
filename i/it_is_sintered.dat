40|$|Abstract Tungsten carbide-cobalt powder {{is pressed}} before {{sintering}} into a compacted form using punches and a die cavity. After the powder has been pressed {{to a specific}} shape, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>sintered</b> and shrinks a certain amount to a final size. To accommodate this shrinkage, the pressing tools are designed to a certain “shrinkage percentage” and thus the pressed component or compact {{is larger than the}} sintered component by that percentage amount. During the pressing process, there is a large amount of friction between the powder being compacted and the die cavity wall. To counter pressing friction, a lubricant is pre-mixed with the tungsten carbide powder.

40|$|Development of {{reliable}} and improved structural ceramics for advanced heat engines and other applications requires process diagnostics and materials evaluation from powder preparation to green-body forming to final sintering. Injection molding is a promising processing method being developed for mass production of complex-shaped heat engine components such as turbochargers (rotors and stator vanes) and engine valves. Major processing steps in injection-molded ceramic manufacturing include preparation of ceramic powders and organic binders, mixing, molding, binder removal, sintering, and finishing [1]. While materials evaluation and diagnostics are needed throughout the process, {{it is particularly}} important to evaluate the distributions of binders/plasticizers in as-molded green bodies [2].

40|$|Strain {{hardening}} {{occurs as}} a result of extensive plastic deformation of a material at below recrystallization temperature.

40|$|Hydroxyapatite (HA) is {{the main}} {{structural}} component in natural bone. Due to its excellent biocompatibility and bioactivity, <b>it</b> can <b>be</b> used for biomedical application as a coating layer for metallic implants. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> reported that <b>it</b> helps the formation of chemical bonding at the HA/bone interface.
