40|$|Aim: To {{study the}} {{performance}} of the implanted both one-piece and three-piece IOLs in relation to the enlarged <b>diameters</b> <b>of</b> the capsular bags of the highly myopic eyes. Subjects and Methods: Patient were randomly divided into two groups; group (A), included 25 eyes that underwent phacoemulsification with implantation of one-piece IOLs, Group (B) included 25 eyes that underwent phacoemulsification with implantation of three-piece IOLs. All patients include in this study were high myopes with axial length greater than 26. 5 mm. All eyes were planned for clear lens extraction or cataract extraction. Results: In group (A), a statistically significant negative correlation was found between the <b>diameters</b> <b>of</b> the capsular bags and the <b>diameters</b> <b>of</b> the implanted on – piece IOLs. The correlation coefficient (r) is – 0. 56. In group (B), a statistically significant positive correlation was found between the <b>diameters</b> <b>of</b> the capsular bags and the <b>diameters</b> <b>of</b> the implanted three-piece IOLs.

5|$|The size of {{the welding}} torch nozzle depends {{on the amount of}} {{shielded}} area desired.

The inside <b>diameter</b> <b>of</b> the nozzle is preferably at least three times the <b>diameter</b> <b>of</b> the electrode, but there are no hard rules. The welder judges the effectiveness of the shielding and increases the nozzle size to increase the area protected by the external gas shield as needed. The nozzle must be heat resistant and thus is normally made of alumina or a ceramic material, but fused quartz, a high purity glass, offers greater visibility. Devices can be inserted into the nozzle for special applications, such as gas lenses or valves to improve the control shielding gas flow to reduce turbulence and introduction of contaminated atmosphere into the shielded area. Hand switches to control welding current can be added to the manual GTAW torches.|$|E
