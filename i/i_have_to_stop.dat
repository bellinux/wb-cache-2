5000|$|Barshim {{suffered}} {{a back injury}} in early 2012 and (later) {{said he was not}} healthy at the London Olympics. The problem was found to be a stress fracture in the fifth (L5) Lumbar vertebrae. In an interview for the IAAF in April 2013, Barshim said: [...] "It started hurting bad before the (2012) World Indoor Championships and then <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> a bit. Before the Olympics, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> again, but we have a really good sports center in Doha and I also received treatment in Warsaw." ...|$|R

6000|$|... ‘Do {{you propose}} I should trundle it myself, like a hawker’s barrow?’ said I. ‘Why, my good man, if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> here, anyway, <b>I</b> should prefer {{to buy a}} house and garden!’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{shall have}} them," [...] Guy {{said as he}} placed them in his doublet, [...] "if <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> till midnight to get speech with them; the matter of waiting a few hours is but a trifle in {{comparison}} with the life of a man. I would that I could warn others." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hurrah!" [...] Edgar exclaimed; [...] "there they are. I mean to {{see this}} battle, Sidi, if <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> here a month. It cannot be long before Nelson arrives. I cannot think why the French admiral should have risked being caught in a trap like this, when a defeat would cut the French army off from Europe altogether." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{father has}} kept me in as a {{punishment}} because I did my sums wrong. The other boys {{have gone out}} bird-nesting, but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> here until I get them right. I don't know when that will be," [...] he added with a sigh, [...] "as I hate rule of three and can't do it." ...|$|E
5000|$|Kempner {{states that}} the film took 13 years to make. [...] "It was all about raising money {{for the rights to}} the archival and featurefootage. That was so {{expensive}} that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> and start about 20 times." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Bob bored me badly, {{though we}} didn't talk much. I {{was driving the}} disc-harrows and he lay in the grass. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> {{for a few minutes}} every time I reached the turning and listen to his remarks." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you," [...] Charlie said. [...] "It {{is not the}} men's fault we are late, but {{the last}} part of the way we came on very slowly. I was getting so {{exhausted}} that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> every few hundred yards." ...|$|R
60|$|To detail {{just the}} {{opposite}} of the above invoice is to describe me. I haven't any right to criticise books, and I don't do it except when I hate them. I often want to criticise Jane Austen, but her books madden me so that I can't conceal my frenzy from the reader; and therefore <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> every time I begin.|$|E
60|$|Or I may be roused from {{my writing}} by her cry that I am making strange faces again. It is my contemptible {{weakness}} that if I say a character smiled vacuously, I must smile vacuously; if he frowns or leers, I frown or leer; {{if he is}} a coward or given to contortions, I cringe, or twist my legs until <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> writing to undo the knot. I bow with him, eat with him, and gnaw my moustache with him. If the character be a lady with an exquisite laugh, I suddenly terrify you by laughing exquisitely. One reads of the astounding versatility of an actor who is stout and lean on the same evening, but what is he to the novelist who is a dozen persons within the hour? Morally, I fear, we must deteriorate—but this is a subject I may wisely edge away from.|$|E
6000|$|Privately speaking, {{this is a}} sordid and {{criminal}} war, and in every way shameful and excuseless. Every day I write (in my head) bitter magazine articles about it, but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> with that. For England must not fall; it would mean an inundation of Russian and German political degradations which would envelop the globe and steep it {{in a sort of}} Middle-Age night and slavery which would last till Christ comes again. Even wrong--and she is wrong--England must be upheld. He is an enemy of the human race who shall speak against her now. Why was the human race created? Or at least why wasn't something creditable created in place of it. God had his opportunity. He could have made a reputation. But no, He must commit this grotesque folly--a lark which must have cost him a regret or two when He came to think it over and observe effects. For a giddy and unbecoming caprice there has been nothing like it till this war. I talk the war with both sides--always waiting until the other man introduces the topic. Then I say [...] "My head is with the Briton, but my heart and such rags of morals as I have are with the Boer--now we will talk, unembarrassed and without prejudice." [...] And so we discuss, and have no trouble.|$|E
5000|$|I love LSD, I just don't, I just... And I don't {{think that}} LSD is an {{addictive}} drug personally, but, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> tried <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> taking {{crack in the}} past and I tried <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> drinking {{in the past and}} say, [...] "OK, I won't drink, I'll just smoke pot" [...] or [...] "I won't take crack, I'll just drink" [...] and whatever the one thing that I decided I would do, I did so much of it to compensate for not doing anything else because that's how <b>I</b> was. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> everything, you know? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As it happens, I didn't {{sleep at}} all," [...] Jake replied. [...] "Steering that unhandy coal-scow rather got upon my nerves {{and when she}} took the awkward sheer as we came through the reef the tiller knocked Maccario down and nearly broke my ribs. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> the helm going the wrong way somehow." ...|$|R
5000|$|In [...] "The Trans List", Mac {{describes}} his life before transitioning genders. [...] "I really don't know why I {{was waiting for}} so long," [...] Mac says. [...] "It {{seemed like it was}} no longer an option for my sanity or for my health. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> spending so much time trying to cover up my emotions and my problems, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> deal with myself." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{have been}} wounded myself {{so often that}} <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> and think before I {{can tell you the}} exact number of times. I have been hit by musket balls, by pistol bullets, and by {{bursting}} shells, besides being pierced by bayonet, lance, sabre, and finally by a brad-awl, which was the most painful of any. Yet out of all these injuries I have never known the same deadly sickness as came over me when I felt the poor, silent, patient creature, which I had come to love {{more than anything in the}} world except my mother and the Emperor, reel and stagger beneath me. I pulled my second pistol from my holster and fired point-blank between the fellow's broad shoulders. He slashed his horse across the flank with his whip, and for a moment I thought that I had missed him. But then on the green of his chasseur jacket I saw an ever-widening black smudge, and he began to sway in his saddle, very slightly at first, but more and more with every bound, until at last over he went, with his foot caught in the stirrup, and his shoulders thud-thud-thudding along the road, until the drag was too much for the tired horse, and I closed my hand upon the foam-spattered bridle-chain. As I pulled him up it eased the stirrup leather, and the spurred heel clinked loudly as it fell.|$|E
60|$|Washington, Aug. 25, 1863. DEAR MOTHER--The {{letter from}} George, and your lines, {{and a few}} from Jeff came yesterday, and I was glad indeed {{to be certain that}} George had got back to Kentucky safe and well--while so many fall that we know, or, what is about as bad, get sick or hurt in the fight, and lay in hospital, it seems almost a miracle that George should have gone through so much, South and North and East and West, and been in so many hard-fought battles, and {{thousands}} of miles of weary and exhausting marches, and yet have stood it so, and be yet alive and in good health and spirits. O mother, what would we [have] done if it had been otherwise--if he had met the fate of so many we know--if he had been killed or badly hurt in some of those battles? I get thinking about it sometimes, and it works upon me so <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> and turn my mind on something else. Mother, I feel bad enough about Andrew, and I know it must be so with you too--one don't know what to do; if we had money he would be welcome to it, if it would do any good. If George's money comes from Kentucky this last time, and you think some of it would do Andrew any real good, I advise you to take some and give him--I think it would be proper and George would approve of it. I believe there is not much but trouble in this world, and if one hasn't any for himself he has it made up by having it brought close to him through others, and that is sometimes worse than to have it touch one's self. Mother, you must not let Andrew's case and the poor condition of his household comforts, etc., work upon you, for I fear you will--but, mother, it's no use to worry about such things. I have seen so much horrors that befall men (so bad and such suffering and mutilations, etc., that the poor men can defy their fate to do anything more or any harder misfortune or worse a-going) that I sometimes think I have grown callous--but no, I don't think it is that, but nothing of ordinary misfortune seems as it used to, and death itself has lost all its terrors--I have seen so many cases in which it was so welcome and such a relief.|$|E
5000|$|Wilkinson {{has spoken}} {{of her love}} {{for the work of}} Diana Wynne Jones, David Almond and Lewis Carroll in interviews. She has also {{revealed}} that Shaun Tan is her favourite illustrator. She has been quoted as saying: [...] "My favourite books would be Fire and Hemlock by Diana Wynne Jones and Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There by Lewis Carroll. Oh, and Love That Dog by Sharon Creech. And The Last Samurai by Helen DeWitt. Do <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> there?" ...|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> gain {{them some}} time, and I {{could think of}} nothing other than <b>to</b> attack. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> them somehow. <b>I</b> distracted them, and I even managed to shoot one down, but then I myself was hit. My plane took 15 cannon hits, 80 by machine gun. My leg and my arm were injured, {{although}} I didn't feel a thing. I knew I probably wasn't going to make it back.|$|R
30|$|Time {{when all}} {{children}} walkabout the road, {{this time of}} year, sun can be very hot. After {{all of them are}} needing water. After cyclone Pam, the water that belongs to you and me was not very good. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> class sometimes, half days, and then we’d eat all together, sometimes we tell the children not to come to school tomorrow because we don’t have enough food (E).|$|R
5000|$|In 2006, Pawel Pawlikowski {{directed}} a film adaptation starring Rhys Ifans, Ben Whishaw, Eddie Marsan, and Warren Clarke {{but it was}} suspended in mid-production when the director's wife fell seriously ill and died. In 2010, he said [...] "We'd shot 60% of the film when <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop.</b> The material looks great, like nothing I've ever done or even seen before. It could have been really great, definitely original".|$|R
5000|$|With {{the release}} of the band's fifth studio record Twilight of the Innocents, in 2007, Wheeler spoke of how if the group hadn't toured so heavily they would have been more prolific, that: [...] "It would have been cool to have twice as many songs by now. I {{definitely}} could have done it, but if I go on tour <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> writing. Writing needs to be a relaxing process and you need peace and quiet and the right stuff around you. Whenever we take a break I could write a song every day, pretty much." ...|$|E
5000|$|I made my albums like movies, {{you know}} what I mean? I wanted {{people to be able}} to listen to a movie in their car while they was driving. [...] "I want to start off making movies where people will know they're at a movie. Like my man Tarantino, he did that movie Pulp Fiction - classic movie, man. Every time it comes on TV or cable, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> and watch it. And it's based on nothing, really. There's only a few people out there that are able to do that, where it comes from nothing but the vision and {{imagination}} of the artist.|$|E
5000|$|Duncan Campbell {{was born}} in Springburn, a Scottish village near Glasgow. Interested in music from a young age, he would often listen to his father play the cornet, as well as {{listening}} to his father's collection of Jazz records on a wind up gramophone. His collection consisted {{of the works of}} Louis Armstrong, Henry Red Allen, Paul Whiteman, Count Basie and Harry Lauder. The first classicial record he bought was by Frederick Delius and titled [...] "On Hearing the First Cuckoo in Spring". Duncan recalled: [...] "I used to play it looking out of the window on a very rainy day and even now, when I play that song in the car <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> and cry. It’s so good and yet, so sad." ...|$|E
60|$|The Boy was black-haired, {{and so was}} the Major, luckily. I cut off a {{piece of}} the Major's hair above the temple with a knife, and put it into the packet we were making. The laughing-fit and the chokes got hold of me again, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop.</b> The Major was nearly as bad; and we both knew that the worst part of the work was to come.|$|R

40|$|Early {{last summer}} {{one of my}} fellow {{students}} suggested I include an editorial column in future issues of the ISU Veterinarian. My first inclination was to decline but the suggestion came up again which prompted me to ask exactly about what should I write? The response was, and rightly so, to write about something for which <b>I</b> <b>have</b> strong feelings. Although it may seem silly, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> and think about those feelings...|$|R
5000|$|In 1964, McIntyre {{graduated}} from John Adams High School before attending Ohio State University. There, she first studied French {{with plans to}} become a linguist with the United Nations, but she became a dance major during her third year after taking a dance history course with Shirley Wynne. McIntyre recalled, [...] "In my third year, I said, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> fooling myself. ... The dance-history courses really shifted me to say, Yes—go for it if that’s {{what you want to}} do." [...] During her time at Ohio State, the university commissioned her to choreograph for an evening with Lucas Hoving, Doris Humphrey, and Anna Sokolow. In 1966, McIntyre attended the American Dance Festival where she would later return {{as a member of the}} faculty in the early 1990s and in 2008.|$|E
5000|$|Despite {{being an}} elite gymnast, Wymer {{did not make}} the 1988 U.S. Olympic team, {{finishing}} 26th at the 1988 U.S. nationals. By 1992, the 18-year-old Wymer decided to concentrate on a college career at the University of Michigan. In 1992, Wymer told the Detroit Free Press of her disappointment:"I probably won't even watch gymnastics during the Olympics. I always wonder how far I could have gotten if I had put 100 percent of my energy into gymnastics. Maybe when I get older, I'll be able to watch."Wymer recalled that her [...] "mistake" [...] was dividing her high school time between gymnastics, student government, cheerleading and boyfriends. [...] "I wanted to be involved in everything, but I regret that," [...] she said. [...] "I wish I had the mind and body I have today when I was younger. But <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> dwelling on the past or I'll drive myself nuts." ...|$|E
