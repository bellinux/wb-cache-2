40|$|Application of {{colloidal}} silica more than doubles bond strength of ceramic tile/substrate attachments. "Densification" process strengthens surface where tile attaches to felt strain-isolator pad, redistributing stresses and preventing failures at that point. First, isopropyl alcohol {{is applied to}} bottom tile surface. Second, aqueous mixture of cementing {{colloidal silica}} and reinforcing ball-milled silica particles is painted on tile. <b>Finally,</b> <b>after</b> <b>drying,</b> tile is rewaterproofed by exposure to vapors or methyltrimethoxysilane and acetic acid...|$|E

30|$|Firstly, 300 mL GO dispersions of {{different}} concentrations (0.005  wt%, 0.01  wt%, 0.02  wt%, 0.04  wt%, and 0.08  wt%) were prepared. Then, 9 g MMT {{was added to}} the GO dispersion to produce a GO/MMT dispersion, followed by vigorous stirring at 8000  rpm for 30  min. Then the dispersion was left to stand at 80  °C for 16  h to equilibrate the adsorption and hydration between MMT and GO. Thereafter, the dispersion was centrifuged at 10, 000  rpm for 15  min. The precipitate was washed several times with deionized water until the upper liquid was clear. <b>Finally,</b> <b>after</b> being <b>dried</b> at 80  °C for 24  h, the precipitate was ground into powder for XRD, XPS, FT-IR, and Raman spectra analysis.|$|R
30|$|The typical {{preparation}} {{procedure of}} S-doped Fe 2 O 3 /C was depicted as follows: 8  g NaOH and 1.2  g cellulose powder were dissolved in 80  mL DI water. The mixture was stirred for 3  h {{at room temperature}} and aged at −  15  °C for 12  h. After that, the mixture was stirred vigorously by a magnet stirrer {{at room temperature for}} 2  h to dissolve cellulose. 0.28  g FeCl 3 · 6 H 2 O and 0.15  g FeCl 2 · 4 H 2 O were then added to the solution simultaneously and stirred for 2  h. Afterward, 1  g thiourea was added to the mixture and stirred for a few minutes before transferring the mixture to a Teflon sealed autoclave at 160  °C for 10  h. After cooling to room temperature, S-doped Fe 2 O 3 /C nanocomposite was collected by a magnet and washed for several times with DI water and diluted HCl. The product was <b>finally</b> obtained <b>after</b> <b>drying</b> in a vacuum oven at 60  °C for 12  h.|$|R

EDTA- 2 Na solution (0.2  mol/L), citric acid solution (0.2  mol/L), and a complex solution of EDTA- 2 Na (0.1  mol/L) and citric acid (0.1  mol/L) were separately adopted to modify USY. The suspension was then filtered and washed with deionized water. Hierarchical USY was <b>finally</b> obtained <b>after</b> the <b>drying</b> of the filtering cake at 110  °C overnight. Three USY samples were marked as USY-E, USY-C, and USY-EC corresponding to modifiers EDTA- 2 Na, citric acid, and complex modifiers of EDTA- 2 Na and citric acid.|$|R

40|$|A {{nanocomposite}} possessing perovskite-related nanosheets dispersed in a siloxane {{network was}} prepared by cohydrolysis of the n-decoxy derivative of an ion-exchangeable layered perovskite, HCa 2 Nb 3 O 10 ·xH 2 O (HCaNb), and tetramethoxysilane (TMOS) via a sol–gel process involving exfoliation.

The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of the product <b>after</b> <b>drying</b> for 1 d showed dark lines with a thickness of 1. 5 nm, which {{was consistent with the}} thickness of an individual nanosheet, indicating exfoliation of HCaNb. In the XRD patterns of the reaction products of the n-decoxy derivative of HCaNb and TMOS before <b>drying</b> and <b>after</b> <b>drying</b> for 60 min, (0 0 l) reflections were detected. <b>After</b> <b>drying</b> for 80 min, the intensity of the (0 0 l) reflections decreased.

40|$|This {{research}} {{evaluated the}} quality of Eucalyptus dunnii sawn wood {{for use in the}} lumber industry. Logs of 25 and 30 cm of diameter were used, broken down according to two methods.

Defects such as crooking, bowling, cupping, and index of cracks in boards, in two humidity conditions, were appraised. Defects were appraised before and <b>after</b> <b>drying,</b> i. e. <b>after</b> reaching the humidity balance. The crooking was more intense in radial boards. The bowling was similar in the two studied systems. Cupping only happened in tangential boards <b>after</b> <b>drying.</b> Cracks were more intense in tangential break down, presenting larger evolution <b>after</b> <b>drying,</b> when compared with radial break down.
