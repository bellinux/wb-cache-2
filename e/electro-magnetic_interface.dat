40|$|An isoparametric four-node {{finite element}} for {{multilayered}} magneto-electro-elastic plates analysis is presented. It {{is based on}} an equivalent single-layer model, which assumes the first order shear deformation theory and quasi-static behavior for the electric and magnetic fields. First, the electro-magnetic state of the plate is determined in terms of the mechanical primary variables, namely the generalized displacements, by solving the strong form of the magneto-electric governing equations coupled with the <b>electro-magnetic</b> <b>interface</b> continuity conditions and the external boundary conditions. In turn, this result is used into the layers constitutive law to infer the equivalent single-layer laminate constitutive relationships that express the plate mechanical stress resultants in terms of the generalized displacements taking the magneto-electro-elastic couplings into account. The weak form of the mechanical equilibrium equations is then written and used to determine the mechanical primary variables. Once these are determined the magneto-electric state can be recovered by simple post-processing. The finite element is formulated by using the mixed interpolation of tensorial components approach where the kinematical variables are usually written in terms of nodal values through shape functions, whereas the transverse shear strains are differently interpolated. These approximations are used in the weak form of the equilibrium equations to obtain the discrete stiffness and mass matrices together with the expression of the equivalent forces. The finite element is validated for static and free vibrations problems by comparison with available 3 -D solutions. Its characteristics are ascertained in terms of convergence, accuracy and sensitivity with respect to plate thickness and element distortion. Performances of the method for the computation of through-the-thickness variables distributions are also investigated. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—At the {{horizontal}} interface between vertically uniaxial half-space media, {{the propagation of}} electromagnetic fields is the-oretically investigated for an interfacial impulse current source of infinitesimal size. For the electric field, the problem divides into {{the horizontal}} source and horizontal receiver (HH), vertical source and vertical receiver (VV), horizontal source and vertical receiver (HV), and vertical source and horizontal receiver (VH) cases. Em-ploying the interface scheme of the Cagniard-style analysis, the solutions of the HH and VV cases are obtained in exact explicit forms. The solutions of the HV and VH cases cannot be expressed in integral-free forms, but the impulse components implicit in the integral solutions can be analytically extracted {{without the aid of}} the frequency-domain asymptotic techniques. Investigation is also made of the magnetic field and of the variation of waveforms when the receiver is taken a little off the interface. The uniaxial case is a generalization of the isotropic case, affording richer information of the wave physics.
