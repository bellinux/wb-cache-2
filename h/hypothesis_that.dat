When a contradiction is detected, the user is encouraged to unassert one of the contradictory beliefs by unasserting some underlying <b>hypotheses</b> <b>that</b> led to the contradiction. As a result, all propositions that had been inferred from the <b>hypotheses</b> <b>that</b> have been unasserted are also unasserted.|$|R

Some authors dispute the <b>hypothesis</b> <b>that</b> antioxidant vitamins could prevent chronic diseases, while others maintain such a possibility is unproved and misguided from the beginning.|$|E

5|$|Bates {{put forward}} the <b>hypothesis</b> <b>that</b> the close {{resemblance}} between unrelated species was an antipredator adaptation. He {{noted that some}} species showed very striking coloration, and flew in a leisurely manner, almost as if taunting predators to eat them. He reasoned that these butterflies were unpalatable to birds and other insectivores, and were thus avoided by them. He extended this logic to forms that closely resembled such protected species, mimicking their warning coloration but not their toxicity.|$|E

While CMM tries to outline the cause and effect relationship of communication, it fails to create consistencies as the theory dictates that each situation is different.|$|R

According to this hypothesis, the self-immolation participants were paid actors, and were presumably assured that the flames would be extinguished before doing real harm.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a formal, foundational {{approach to learning}} from examples in machine learning. It is assumed that a learning system is presented with a stream of facts describing a domain of application. The task {{of the system is}} to form and modify hypotheses characterising the relations in the domain, based on this information. Presumably the set of <b>hypotheses</b> <b>that</b> may be so formed will require continual revision as further information is received. The emphasis in this paper is to characterise those <b>hypotheses</b> <b>that</b> may potentially be formed, rather than to specify the subset of the <b>hypotheses</b> <b>that,</b> for whatever reason, should be held. To this end. formal systems are derived from which the set of potential <b>hypotheses</b> <b>that</b> may be formed is precisely specified. A procedure is also derived for restoring the consistency of a set of hypotheses after conflicting evidence is encountered. In addition, this work is extended to where a learning system may be &quot;told &quot; arbitrary sentences concerning a domain The approach is intended to provide a basic framework lor the development of systems that learn from examples, as well as a neutral point from which such systems may be viewed and compared. 1...|$|R
