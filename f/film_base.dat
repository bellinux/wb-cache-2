25|$|Dufaycolor {{additive}} color film {{was introduced in}} 1931. It used a mosaic of tiny RGB color filters between the emulsion and the <b>film</b> <b>base</b> to record and reproduce the color.|$|E
25|$|Current color films do {{this with}} three layers of {{differently}} color-sensitive photographic emulsion coated on one strip of <b>film</b> <b>base.</b> Early processes used color filters to photograph the color components as completely separate images (e.g., three-strip Technicolor) or adjacent microscopic image fragments (e.g., Dufaycolor) in a one-layer black-and-white emulsion.|$|E
2500|$|A {{more common}} {{technique}} {{emerged in the}} early 1910s known as film tinting, {{a process in which}} either the emulsion or the <b>film</b> <b>base</b> is dyed, giving the image a uniform monochromatic color. [...] This process was popular during the silent era, with specific colors employed for certain narrative effects (red for scenes with fire or firelight, blue for night, etc.).|$|E

2500|$|The three color {{records are}} stacked as shown at right, with a UV filter on top {{to keep the}} {{non-visible}} ultraviolet radiation from exposing the silver-halide crystals, which are naturally sensitive to UV light. [...] Next are the fast and slow blue-sensitive layers, which, when developed, form the latent image. [...] When the exposed silver-halide crystal is developed, it is coupled with a dye grain of its complementary color. [...] This forms a dye [...] "cloud" [...] (like {{a drop of water}} on a paper towel) and is limited in its growth by development-inhibitor-releasing (DIR) couplers, which also serve to refine the sharpness of the processed image by limiting the size of the dye clouds. The dye clouds formed in the blue layer are actually yellow (the opposite or complementary color to blue). [...] There are two layers to each color; a [...] "fast" [...] and a [...] "slow." [...] The fast layer features larger grains that are more sensitive to light than the slow layer, which has finer grain and is less sensitive to light. [...] Silver-halide crystals are naturally sensitive to blue light, so the blue layers are {{on the top of the}} film and they are followed immediately by a yellow filter, which stops any more blue light from passing through to the green and red layers and biasing those crystals with extra blue exposure. [...] Next are the red-sensitive record (which forms cyan dyes when developed); and, at the bottom, the green-sensitive record, which forms magenta dyes when developed. [...] Each color is separated by a gelatin layer that prevents silver development in one record from causing unwanted dye formation in another. On the back of the <b>film</b> <b>base</b> is an anti-halation layer that absorbs light which would otherwise be weakly reflected back through the film by that surface and create halos of light around bright features in the image. In color film, this backing is [...] "rem-jet", a black-pigmented, non-gelatin layer which is removed in the developing process.|$|E

50|$|A <b>film</b> <b>base</b> is a {{transparent}} substrate which {{acts as a}} support medium for the photosensitive emulsion that lies atop it. Despite the numerous layers and coatings associated with the emulsion layer, the base generally accounts {{for the vast majority}} of the thickness of any given film stock. Historically there have been three major types of <b>film</b> <b>base</b> in use: nitrocellulose (cellulose nitrate), cellulose acetate (cellulose triacetate, cellulose diacetate, cellulose acetate propionate, and cellulose acetate butyrate), and polyester (polyethylene terephthalate (PET) (Kodak trade-name: ESTAR)).|$|E
50|$|Scratches, abrasions, cinch marks {{caused by}} {{rewinding}} a film too tightly, and other blemishes {{are a common}} problem with films that are candidates for restoration. Most of these scratches are in {{the back side of}} the film in the transparent substrate that forms the <b>film</b> <b>base,</b> rather than in the photographic emulsion on the front that holds the film's actual image. In the normal process of duplicating a film in an optical printer, collimated light passes through the <b>film</b> <b>base</b> on its way to illuminate the emulsion. Any scratches, abrasions, etc., in the <b>film</b> <b>base</b> cause the light to bend such that the duplicated film ends up with bright or dark (depending on whether copying from a negative or positive original) copies of the scratches. This bending of the light is being caused by the difference in the refraction index of the substrate and the air.|$|E

50|$|Black-and-white {{photographic}} films using {{silver halide}} emulsions {{are the only}} film types that have proven to last for archival storage. The determining factors for longevity include the <b>film</b> <b>base</b> type, proper processing (develop, stop, fix and wash) and proper storage. Early films were coated onto a nitrate base material which was prone to combustion if stored in uncontrolled temperatures. Nitrate film was replaced with acetate-base films.
