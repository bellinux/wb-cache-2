5|$|Born in Stettin, Germany (now Szczecin, Poland), to assimilated Jews, Döblin {{moved with}} his mother and {{siblings}} to Berlin when he was ten years old after his father had abandoned them. Döblin would live in Berlin for the almost all of the next forty-five years, engaging with such key figures of the prewar and Weimar-era German cultural scene as Herwarth Walden and the circle of Expressionists, Bertolt Brecht, and Thomas Mann. Only a few years after his rise to literary celebrity with the 1929 publication of Berlin Alexanderplatz, Döblin was forced into exile by the rise of the Nazi dictatorship. He spent 1933–1940 in France and then was forced to flee again {{at the start of the}} Second World War. Like many other German émigrés he spent the war years in Los Angeles, where he converted to Catholicism. He moved to West Germany after the war but did not <b>feel</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>in</b> postwar Germany's conservative cultural climate and returned to France. His final years were marked by poor health and financial difficulties, and his literary work was met with relative neglect.|$|E
25|$|In Seascape, Nancy and Charlie, an American {{couple on}} the verge of the major life change of retirement, are having {{problems}} in their relationship. They are discussing these matters on the beach when another couple appears, two human-sized lizards named Leslie and Sarah who speak and act like people. The lizards have evolved {{to such a degree that}} they no longer <b>feel</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>in</b> the sea and are compelled to seek life on the land. What the lizards experience with Nancy and Charlie nearly drives them back to the sea, but with an offer of help from the human couple, they decide to stay.|$|E
500|$|Endino billed {{the band}} thirty hours of {{recording}} at $606.17. Jason Everman, a guitarist who {{was impressed by}} Nirvana's demo with Dale Crover, supplied the money. He briefly joined the group as second guitarist. Everman was credited as a guitarist on the album sleeve, and is the other guitarist {{on the cover of}} the album, even though he did not perform on the album. Bassist Krist Novoselic explained, [...] "We just wanted to make him <b>feel</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>in</b> the band." ...|$|E

Technically, Donahue mostly plays in fingerpicking or hybrid picking style with his right hand. However, his left hand technique made him famous among guitar players.|$|R
50|$|Thirteen-year-old Kim <b>feels</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>in</b> the wilderness. One night, nature's soul {{appears to}} him {{in the form of an}} Indian, and designates him nature's protector. Kim decides to remain out in the forest and live off what nature provides. Soon, however, Kim's {{assignment}} becomes more serious. He has to try and save as many animals as he can from man's pointless killing, and he will stop at nothing.|$|R
500|$|Environment {{plays a role}} in all of the Shannara novels: [...] "Environment is a {{character}} in my story and almost always {{plays a major role in}} affecting the story's outcome. I have always believed that fantasy, in particular, because it takes place in an imaginary world with at least some imaginary characters, needs to make the reader <b>feel</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>in</b> the setting. That means bringing the setting alive for the reader, which is what creating environment as {{a character}} is really all about." [...] However, Brooks believes that Sword was more about behavioral issues and personal sacrifice.|$|E
500|$|Whence, in {{the name}} of Count Buffon and Baron Cuvier, came those dogs that I saw in Typee? Dogs!—Big hairless rats rather; all with smooth, shining, {{speckled}} hides—fat sides, and very disagreeable faces. Whence could they have come? That they were not the indigenous production of the region, I am firmly convinced. Indeed they seemed aware of their being interlopers, looking fairly ashamed, and always trying to hide themselves in some dark corner. It was plain enough they did not <b>feel</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>in</b> the vale—that they wished themselves well out of it, and back to the ugly country from which they must have come.|$|E
500|$|During the {{creation}} of [...] God of War, the game's director David Jaffe attempted to create a version of Kratos that looked brutal but had a different appearance from what {{is considered to be}} the traditional Greek hero. The character's traditional armor was removed to show the character's individualism, and details such as hair and other [...] "flowing things" [...] were removed. Jaffe said of his final version of the character, that while [...] " [...] may not totally <b>feel</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>in</b> Ancient Greece from a costume standpoint, I think he achieves the greater purpose which is to give players a character who they can play who really does just let them go nuts and unleash the nasty fantasies that they have in their head." ...|$|E

500|$|She was a {{prolific}} painter who generated over 1,500 canvasses in three decades. [...] Moses initially charged $3 to $5 for a painting, depending upon its size, and as her fame increased her works were sold for $8,000 to $10,000. Her winter paintings {{are reminiscent of}} some of the known winter paintings of Pieter Bruegel the Elder, although she had never seen his work. A German fan of her work said, [...] "There emanates from her paintings a light-hearted optimism; the world she shows us is beautiful and it is good. You <b>feel</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>in</b> all these pictures, and you know their meaning. The unrest and the neurotic insecurity of the present day make us inclined to enjoy the simple and affirmative outlook of Grandma Moses." ...|$|E
500|$|Lost creators Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse were fans of Akinnuoye-Agbaje's work on HBO's Oz, {{and asked}} him to portray the character. Although Akinnuoye-Agbaje was not {{initially}} interested in joining the cast, he was persuaded by Cuse and Lindelof, but for a shorter period than they had in mind. Akinnuoye-Agbaje had a lot of influence on his character, changing the character's name and making adjustments to Eko's personality. After appearing on the show for one season, Akinnuoye-Agbaje asked Cuse and Lindelof to write his character out of the show because he did not <b>feel</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>in</b> Hawaii. They decided a [...] "shocking and emotional death" [...] would be the best way for the character to depart: after seeing his brother on the island, Eko chases him until he stumbles upon the smoke monster, which brutally murders him.|$|E
500|$|Charlie Wen, {{director}} of visual development on God of War and God of War II, {{is responsible for}} designing Kratos. Wen said that his direction for designing Kratos was as much influenced by similarly themed films as it was by pop culture, which led him to sketch a series of images of Kratos on napkins at a restaurant, introducing {{the idea of the}} double-chained blades and eventually Kratos' iconic design. Double-chained blades were chosen as Kratos' signature weapon because they emphasized the character's animal nature while also allowing combat to remain fluid. Jaffe said of the final version of [...] the character, [...] " [...] may not totally <b>feel</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>in</b> Ancient Greece from a costume standpoint, I think he achieves the greater purpose which is to give players a character who they can play who really does just let them go nuts and unleash the nasty fantasies that they have in their head." ...|$|E

It was a cold, correct, {{accomplished}} fact; the household fairies had left it,--and when the fairies leave a room, nobody ever <b>feels</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>in</b> it. No pictures, curtains, no wealth of mirrors, no elegance of lounges, can in the least make up for their absence.

500|$|In November 1987 Harrison {{released}} the platinum album Cloud Nine. Co-produced with Jeff Lynne of Electric Light Orchestra, the LP included Harrison's rendition of James Ray's [...] "Got My Mind Set on You", which went to {{number one in}} the US and number two in the UK. The accompanying music video received substantial airplay, and another single, [...] "When We Was Fab", a retrospective of the Beatles' career, earned two MTV Music Video Awards nominations in 1988. Recorded at his estate in Friar Park, Harrison's slide guitar playing featured prominently on the album, which included several of his long-time musical collaborators, including Clapton, Jim Keltner, and Jim Horn, who recalled Harrison's relaxed and friendly demeanour during the sessions: [...] "George made you <b>feel</b> <b>at</b> <b>home,</b> <b>in</b> his home... He once had me sit on a toilet and play my soprano sax, and they miked it {{at the end of the}} hall for a distant sound. I thought they were kidding... Another time he stopped me in the middle of a sax solo and brought me 3 p.m. tea—again I thought he was kidding." [...] Cloud Nine reached number eight and number ten on the US and UK charts respectively, and several tracks from the album achieved placement on Billboards Mainstream Rock chart – [...] "Devil's Radio", [...] "This Is Love" [...] and [...] "Cloud 9".|$|E
2500|$|Bahru Zewde on {{the other}} hand, while admitting that [...] "contradiction and {{inconsistency}} were the hallmark of his character and policies", notes that Iyasu's reign was characterized by [...] "a series of measures which, because {{of the social and}} economic security they implied, may well be considered progressive." [...] Iyasu modernized many sections of the Ethiopian criminal code, and created a municipal police force, the Terenbulle. His overtures to the Muslim inhabitants of Ethiopia [...] "can be interpreted as one of trying to redress the injustices of the past, of making the Muslims <b>feel</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>in</b> their own country." ...|$|E
2500|$|This culture {{today has}} evolved to include larger {{companies}} aiming at acquiring the bright minds driving startups. Google, among other companies, has made strides to make purchased startups and their workers <b>feel</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>in</b> their offices, even letting them bring their dogs to work. The main goal behind all {{changes to the}} culture of the startup workplace, or a company hiring workers from a startup to do similar work, is to make the people feel as comfortable in their new office as possible in order to optimize performance [...] Some companies even try to hide how large they are to capture a particular demographic, {{as is the case with}} Heineken recently.|$|E

2500|$|Patriotism {{may come}} to mean {{different}} things for different ex-military brats, but nevertheless figures strongly in the upbringing, language and thinking of many {{who grew up in}} military families. The comfort, or sense of restriction, (or both) that can be found on military bases {{is not limited to the}} physical trappings, but can be fortified via some of the consistent rituals common to them. When moving around the world, these rituals can help brats <b>feel</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>in</b> their new community. Even though the faces and geography change, the [...] "base" [...] can remain recognizable because the rituals are often uniform. The underlying principle of these rituals is consistent: to promote patriotism.|$|E
2500|$|Amongst {{those who}} took part in the council of war was Sir Richard Grenville, a younger brother of Sir Bevil. In the {{historian}} S.R. Gardiner's opinion [...] "A selfish and unprincipled man, [...] had gone through the evil schooling of the Irish War", and, falling into the hands of the Parliamentarians upon his landing at Liverpool, he had declared himself willing to embrace their cause. His military experience gained him the appointment of lieutenant-general of Waller's horse. He was not a man to <b>feel</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>in</b> an atmosphere of Puritanism, and on 3 March 1644 he fled to Oxford, carrying with him the secret of Paulet's treachery. Grenvile's name was attached with every injurious epithet to a gallows in London, while at Oxford he was regarded as a pattern of loyalty.|$|E
2500|$|Clarkson was {{admired by}} the {{faithful}} for being open about her religious beliefs during {{her time in}} Rideau Hall.

[...] In this same interview, she criticized conservatives for creating what she called the [...] "deep divide" [...] in the Anglican church regarding homosexuality. Clarkson was also noted for visiting Anglican churches around Canada on her many tours, saying that she enjoyed seeing how the church fit in communities in all parts of Canada. Her public faith, however, was also the cause of controversy: She received particular criticism when she was seen taking communion in a Catholic church since that denomination does not permit open communion.|$|E

GamePro cited her {{as an example of}} the right way to do female video game characters, along with other female protagonists such as Portals Chell, Half-Life 2s Alyx Vance, and Silent Hill 3s Heather Mason. Kotaku editor Stephen Totillo compared her to Kendra Midori, protagonist of the Avatar video game, describing Midori as a [...] "nature-loving scientist lady" [...] while describing Jade as a [...] "nature-loving photographer," [...] stating that she would <b>feel</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> <b>in</b> the world of Avatar. In an article discussing racial ambiguity in video games, Wired editor Chris Kohler uses Jade as an example of someone whose race is ambiguous, also bringing up a reader's blog post listing Jade in his list of black characters. This caused a [...] "mini-controversy" [...] on the NeoGAF forums, from which Kohler took statements as evidence of the ambiguity.

Heinze memorialized his grandmother in an article he wrote for The Jewish Daily Forward shortly after she {{died at the age of}} 101; he described her as a flamboyant, stylish, and impeccably dressed woman, and he recalled that after his grandfather (her husband of 60 years) had died, she [...] "kept on going, honestly confessing her loneliness but unflaggingly maintaining her enthusiasm for life and for us." [...] He quoted her as frequently giving him the reminder, [...] "We are 100% Americans, dear, always remember that!"
