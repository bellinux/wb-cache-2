The influences of engine speed at full load and <b>evaporating</b> <b>pressure</b> on the EERs performances are analyzed. The results reveal that water in Group H and R 141 b in Group L contribute the peak improvement in system benefits, while fluids in Group H show better cost-effectiveness. The EERs performances would be influenced strongly by <b>evaporating</b> <b>pressure</b> at high engine speed, while it also requires high pressure to enhance the performances at low speed.

40|$|Abstract: This article {{describes}} and evaluates an organic Rankine cycle (ORC) for a {{waste heat recovery}} system by both theoretical and experimental studies. Theoretical analysis of several working fluids shows that cycle efficiency is very sensitive to <b>evaporating</b> <b>pressure,</b> but insensitive to expander inlet temperature. Second law analysiswas carried out usingR 600 a as aworking fluid and a flow of hot air as a heat source, which is not isothermal, along the evaporator. The result discloses that the evaporator’s internal and external entropy generation is the main source of total entropy generation. The effect of the heat source temperature, <b>evaporating</b> <b>pressure,</b> and evaporator size on the entropy generation rate is also presented. The obtained useful power is directly linked to the total entropy generation rate according to the Gouy–Stodola theorem. The ORC testing systemwas established and operated using R 600 a as aworking fluid and hotwater as a heat source. Themaximum cycle efficiency of the testing system is 5. 2 per cent, and the testing result also proves that cycle efficiency is insensitive to heat source temperature, but sensitive to <b>evaporating</b> <b>pressure.</b> The entropy result also shows that internal and external entropy of the evaporator is the main source of total entropy generation...|$|E

In this study a compressor is characterized experimentally with refrigerant R 134 a and through 118 tests at condensing pressures varying from 8. 6 up to 40. 4 bar (tsat = 33. 9 °C to tsat = 100. 8 °C) and <b>evaporating</b> <b>pressures</b> varying from 1. 6 up to 17. 8 bar (tsat = - 15. 6 °C to tsat = 62. 4 °C). Under these conditions the compressor motor was pushed at its maximal current in several tests. This compressor’s performance is mainly characterized by its isentropic and volumetric efficiencies. It presents a maximal isentropic efficiency of 72 %, corresponding to a pressure ratio of around 2. 5 – 2. 6. The volumetric efficiency decreases linearly from almost 1. 0 (for a pressure ratio of 1. 3) to 0. 83 (for a pressure ratio of 9. 7). A slight degradation of the isentropic and volumetric efficiencies is observed when the compressor supply and exhaust pressures are increased for a given pressure ratio; this could be due to an internal leakage.
