5|$|After {{leaving the}} main line {{immediately}} south of Hellingly, the railway passed over gated level crossings at Park Road and New Road. Farm Siding, a single siding on {{the west of the}} line beyond the crossings, was a collection point for the farm's agricultural produce {{in the early years of}} the railway, but later fell out of use. The line climbed most of the way from <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hospital at 1 in 50. About halfway between Hellingly and the hospital the line entered the hospital grounds, passing to the west of Park House Siding, which served the hospital's Park House annexe.|$|E
5|$|It passes into a {{primarily}} residential area, though several auto service shops exist {{along this}} stretch, {{as well as}} Northern Secondary School. The road heads slightly west south of Blythwood Road, then crosses Blythwood Ravine, which contains the small Burke Brook. After climbing into Lawrence Park, the road meets Lawrence Avenue East. This intersection, featuring a multi-stage traffic light, directs driver to the east before continuing north. From <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northern terminus, it is classified as a collector road and is a wide residential street with several stop signs. The road ends {{near the edge of}} the West Don Valley at an intersection with Glen Echo Drive, adjacent to the Doncliffe Bus Loop.|$|E

5|$|Lysosomes {{carry out}} {{intracellular}} digestion, {{in a process}} called phagocytosis (from the Greek phagein, to eat and kytos, vessel, referring <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cell), by fusing with a vacuole and releasing their enzymes into the vacuole. Through this process, sugars, amino acids, and other monomers pass into the cytosol and become nutrients for the cell. Lysosomes also use their hydrolytic enzymes to recycle the cell's obsolete organelles in a process called autophagy. The lysosome engulfs another organelle and uses its enzymes to take apart the ingested material. The resulting organic monomers are {{then returned to the}} cytosol for reuse. The last function of a lysosome is to digest the cell itself through autolysis.|$|E
25|$|To the north, {{below the}} steep cliffs of the plateau, lies a narrow belt of Mediterranean farmland. Olives and other {{mediterranean}} {{fruits and vegetables}} are grown <b>here.</b> <b>To</b> <b>the</b> south, the forest and farmland gives way to juniper bush maquis and pre-desert scrub with some winter grazing.|$|E

The Dar es Salaam commuter rail goes from <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> city centre but it is not fast(narrow gauge) and there are ten level crossings of roads along the route. Its also a hub of industry.|$|E
25|$|Another branch diverged northwards <b>here,</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west of Sunnyside Road: {{called the}} Gartsherrie, Hornock and Summerlea Branch Canal, it ended at the Gartsherrie Ironworks, {{just south of}} the present-day Gartsherrie Road. It was {{originally}} planned to serve coal pits, but it was still unfinished in 1830 when the Baird Brothers established their Gartsherrie Ironworks at its termination.|$|E
25|$|At {{the western}} end of Phrygia stood the towns of Aizanoi (modern Çavdarhisar) and Acmonia. From <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{southwest}} lies the hilly area of Phrygia that contrasts to the bare plains of the region's heartland. Southwestern Phrygia is watered by the Maeander (Büyük Menderes River) and its tributary the Lycus, and contains the towns of Laodicea on the Lycus and Hierapolis.|$|E

25|$|Chylomicrons, {{the least}} dense {{cholesterol}} transport molecules, contain apolipoprotein B-48, apolipoprotein C, and apolipoprotein E (the principal cholesterol carrier in the brain) in their shells. Chylomicrons carry fats from the intestine to muscle and other tissues {{in need of}} fatty acids for energy or fat production. Unused cholesterol remains in more cholesterol-rich chylomicron remnants, and taken up from <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bloodstream by the liver.|$|E
25|$|The Stoors, {{the second}} most numerous, were shorter and stockier and had an {{affinity}} for water, boats and swimming. They lived on the marshy Gladden Fields where the Gladden River met the Anduin (there is a similarity <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hobbits of Buckland and the Marish in the Shire. It is possible that those hobbits were the descendants of Stoors). It was from these Hobbits that Déagol and Sméagol/Gollum were descended.|$|E

25|$|The two routes enter Keeseville, {{where in}} mid-village {{they cross the}} Ausable River and enter Clinton County. NY9N reappears here, {{reaching}} its northern terminus. North of the village, the two routes split again and exchange the roles they had been playing for their entire northward journey. 9 takes the eastward fork to the lake, running close to the state's edge; while 22 will run inland from <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> border.|$|E
25|$|Oddly, {{the four}} truths refer <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> eightfold path {{as the means}} to gain liberation, while the {{attainment}} of insight into the four truths is portrayed as liberating in itself. According to Bronkhorst, this is an inconsistency which reveals a changes which took place over time {{in the composition of}} the sutras. An example of this substitution, and its consequences, is Majjhima Nikaya 36:42-43, which gives an account of the awakening of the Buddha.|$|E

25|$|The single fact of John Paul II's {{election}} in 1978 changed everything. In Poland, everything began. Not in East Germany or Czechoslovakia. Then {{the whole thing}} spread. Why in 1980 did they lead the way in Gdansk? Why did they decide, now or never? Only {{because there was a}} Polish pope. He was in Chile and Pinochet was out. He was in Haiti and Duvalier was out. He was in the Philippines and Marcos was out. On many of those occasions, people would come <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Vatican thanking the Holy Father for changing things.|$|E
25|$|A legionary camp {{may have}} also existed at Aila (modern Aqaba), which has been {{excavated}} by Parker since 1994. The city was located {{at the north end}} of the Gulf of Aqaba where it was a centre of sea traffic. Several land routes also intersected here. Legio X Fretensis, originally stationed in Jerusalem, was transferred <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> terminus of the Via Nova. So far, a stone curtain wall and projecting tower have been identified, but it is uncertain whether they were part of the city wall of Aila or the fortress. The evidence suggests the fort was constructed in the late 4th or early 5th century.|$|E
