5|$|Since the {{judgement}} the <b>Fixed-term</b> Parliaments Act 2011 {{has removed}} limitation that the Parliament Act 1911 can't {{be used to}} extend the duration of Parliament.|$|E
5|$|Parliament {{had been}} limited {{to a maximum of}} seven years under the Septennial Act 1716, but the Parliament Act 1911 amended the Septennial Act to limit Parliament to five years, {{beginning}} the first meeting of Parliament after the election. In practice, no election was absolutely forced by that limitation; until the Septennial Act was repealed by the <b>Fixed-term</b> Parliaments Act 2011, all parliaments were dissolved by the Monarch under the Royal Prerogative on request of the Prime Minister. It should be noted, however, that the five-year maximum duration in the amended Septennial Act referred to the lifetime of the Parliament, and not to the interval between general elections. For example, the 2010 general election was held five years and one day after the 2005 general election, whilst the 1992 general election was held on 9 April 1992 and the next general election was not held until 1 May 1997. The reduction in Parliament length was seen as a counterbalance to the new powers granted to the Commons. The <b>Fixed-term</b> Parliaments Act 2011, in contrast, calls for general elections every five years (unless called sooner, as in 2017), and provides for dissolution of Parliament only by operation of law prior to each election; it abolished dissolution under the Royal Prerogative.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the regular and reserve armies, all former Regular Army personnel (known as the Regular Reserve) may be recalled for duty as needed. The Regular Reserve has two categories: A and D. Category A is mandatory, with {{the length of time}} in the category dependent on time spent in Regular Army service. Category D is voluntary, and consists of personnel who are no longer required to serve in category A. Regular Reserves in both categories serve under a <b>fixed-term</b> reserve contract and may report for training or service overseas and at home, similar to the Army Reserve. In 2007, there were 121,800 Regular Reserves, of which 33,760 served in categories A and D. Beginning in April 2013, the full Regular Reserve strength was no longer reported—only those serving in categories A and D (30,000 in 2015).|$|E
5|$|It is the {{prerogative}} of the monarch to summon and prorogue Parliament. Each parliamentary session {{begins with the}} monarch's summons. The new parliamentary session is marked by the State Opening of Parliament, during which the Sovereign reads the Speech from the throne in the Chamber of the House of Lords, outlining the Government's legislative agenda. Prorogation usually occurs about one year after a session begins, and formally concludes the session. Dissolution ends a parliamentary term, and {{is followed by a}} general election for all seats in the House of Commons. A general election is normally held five years after the previous one under the <b>Fixed-term</b> Parliaments Act 2011, but can be held sooner if the Prime Minister loses a motion of confidence, or if two-thirds {{of the members of the}} House of Commons vote to hold an early election.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the 2010 general election, the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats {{pledged to}} {{introduce}} <b>fixed-term</b> elections. As {{part of the}} Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition agreement, the Cameron ministry agreed to support legislation for <b>fixed-term</b> Parliaments, with {{the date of the}} next general election being 7 May 2015. This resulted in the <b>Fixed-term</b> Parliaments Act 2011, which removed the prime minister's power to advise the monarch to call an early election. The Act only permits an early dissolution if Parliament votes for one by a two-thirds supermajority, or if a vote of no confidence is passed by a majority and no new government is subsequently formed within 14 days. However, the prime minister had the power, by order made by Statutory Instrument under section 1(5) of the <b>Fixed-term</b> Parliaments Act 2011, to fix the polling day to be up to two months later than 7 May 2015. Such a Statutory Instrument must be approved by each House of Parliament. Under section 14 of the Electoral Registration and Administration Act 2013, the <b>Fixed-term</b> Parliaments Act 2011 was amended to extend the period between the dissolution of Parliament and the following general election polling day from 17 to 25 working days. This had the effect of moving forward the date of the dissolution of the Parliament to 30 March 2015.|$|E
25|$|This {{section was}} {{repealed}} by the <b>Fixed-term</b> Parliaments Act 2011 for the United Kingdom on 15 September 2011, when parliament {{was given a}} fixed five-year term.|$|E
25|$|The {{chairman}} of the military court announced the verdicts on Christmas Eve, 1947 and delivered the corresponding sentences on December 30. Seven life sentences, seven <b>fixed-term</b> prison sentences, and one death penalty were handed down. Four defendants were acquitted, including Rickhey.|$|E
25|$|The United Kingdom general {{election}} of 2015 {{was held on}} 7 May 2015 to elect 650 members to the House of Commons. It was the first {{general election}} {{at the end of}} a <b>fixed-term</b> Parliament. Local elections took place in most areas on the same day.|$|E
25|$|The {{belief in}} the DWP was that the new {{approach}} would not just cap {{the total number of}} people on sickness benefits, as Incapacity Benefit was supposed to have done, but actively reduce it to {{a small group of people}} with severe disabilities and another modestly-sized group who were undergoing <b>fixed-term</b> pre-employment training.|$|E
25|$|The union {{works to}} raise {{awareness}} of problems faced by all workers in Japan, including foreign/migrant workers, to improve members' working conditions and bargaining power and to inform members of their rights under Japanese labour law. Activities include strikes, rallies and leafleting, filing injunctions and arguing cases at Labour Commissions and District Courts on issues such as <b>fixed-term</b> contracts, the non-enrollment of employees into Social Insurance, illegal outsourcing of Assistant Language Teachers by public schools, and unfair dismissals due to one-year contracts.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Fixed-term</b> Parliaments Act 2011 (as {{amended by}} the Electoral Registration and Administration Act 2013) {{led to the}} {{dissolution}} of the 55th Parliament on 30 March 2015 and the scheduling of the election on 7 May, the House of Commons not having voted for an earlier date. There were local elections on the same day in most of England, with the exception of Greater London. No other elections were scheduled to take place in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland, apart from any local by-elections.|$|E
25|$|The Chief of Air Force may be {{selected}} {{from any of}} the RAAF's air vice-marshal appointments, although the Air Commander or Deputy Chief of Air Force are the most frequent appointees. While every chief to date has been a pilot, since the mid-1970s there has been no legal restriction on appointees from other disciplines. The CAF is appointed by the Prime Minister and is usually a <b>fixed-term</b> tenure, after which the member normally retires, unless offered the more senior role of CDF. Four heads of the RAAF have gone on to attain the position of CDF or equivalent.|$|E
25|$|An Ordinance of February 1982 {{limited the}} {{duration}} of <b>fixed-term</b> contracts to 6 to 12 months, and introduced an end of contract bonus of 5% total gross pay over the contract’s period. Another Ordinance passed that same month restricted {{the duration of}} assignments to 6 months, and increased the ‘precarious employment allowance’ from 4% to 15% of gross pay per assignment. For public sector workers, a law was passed in 1982 to prevent gender segregation in recruitment {{and to ensure that}} the situation was monitored carefully. An Act of July 1982 allowed the spouses of shopkeepers and artisans to receive social or work-related entitlements. An Act of August 1982 raised employers’ participation in financing the public transportation expenses of employees. In April 1982 special aids were extended to farmers who had invested between 1 April 1981 and 31 March 1982.|$|E
25|$|Until 1956, {{there were}} only two banks in Liechtenstein: the Liechtensteinische Landesbank as an {{institution}} governed by public law, and Bank in Liechtenstein AG, a private-law company. On 6 April 1956, Guido Feger founded Verwaltungs- und Privat-Bank – today’s VP Bank – in the legal form of a Liechtenstein institution with start-up capital of 2 million Swiss francs. The founding was a logical extension of Guido Feger’s Allgemeinen Treuunternehmens (ATU), at the time the largest and oldest trust company in Vaduz. In 1956, it employed 13 people in Liechtenstein and, on behalf of clients, four offices workers in foreign countries. Together, they catered to the needs of roughly 900 clients in matters pertaining to the fiduciary administration of real estate interests, securities portfolios and current accounts – mainly in the CHF realm and the United States – as well as patent rights, loans and <b>fixed-term</b> deposits.|$|E
25|$|The cabinet is {{traditionally}} drawn {{from members of}} the prime minister's party or coalition and mostly from the House of Commons but always from both legislative houses, the cabinet being responsible to both. Executive power is exercised by the prime minister and cabinet, all of whom are sworn into the Privy Council of the United Kingdom, and become Ministers of the Crown. The current Prime Minister is Theresa May, who has been in office since 13 July 2016. May is also the leader of the Conservative Party. For elections to the House of Commons, the UK is divided into 650 constituencies, each electing a single member of parliament (MP) by simple plurality. General elections are called by the monarch when the prime minister so advises. Prior to the <b>Fixed-term</b> Parliaments Act 2011, the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949 required that a new election must be called no later than five years after the previous general election.|$|E
25|$|An {{election}} is called following {{the dissolution of}} the Parliament of the United Kingdom. The 2015 general election was the first to be held under the provisions of the <b>Fixed-term</b> Parliaments Act 2011. Prior to this, the power to dissolve Parliament was a royal prerogative, exercised by the sovereign on the advice of the prime minister. Under the provisions of the Septennial Act 1716, as amended by the Parliament Act 1911, an election had to be announced on or before the fifth anniversary of the beginning of the previous parliament, barring exceptional circumstances. No sovereign had refused a request for dissolution {{since the beginning of the}} 20th century, and the practice had evolved that a prime minister would typically call a general election to be held at a tactically convenient time within the final two years of a Parliament's lifespan, to maximise the chance of an electoral victory for his or her party.|$|E
25|$|As well {{as having}} rights for fair treatment, the Equality Act 2010 {{requires}} {{that people are}} treated equally, {{unless there is a}} good justification, based on their gender, race, sexual orientation, beliefs and age. To combat social exclusion, employers must positively accommodate the needs of disabled people. Part-time staff, agency workers, and people on <b>fixed-term</b> contracts are treated generally equally compared to full-time or permanent staff. To tackle unemployment, all employees are entitled to reasonable notice before dismissal after a qualifying period of a month, after two years they can only be dismissed for a fair reason, and are entitled to a redundancy payment if their job was no longer economically necessary. If an enterprise is bought or outsourced, the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006 require that employees' terms cannot be worsened without a good economic, technical or organisational reason. The purpose of these rights is to ensure people have dignified living standards, whether or not they have the relative bargaining power to get good terms and conditions in their contract.|$|E
25|$|A {{government}} decree of March 1982 {{sought to}} provide greater employment {{security for the}} increasing number of workers on part-time and <b>fixed-term</b> contracts by restricting the circumstances in which employers could use such labour (this was largely to ensure that permanent employees were not displaced by cheaper and more easily dismissed part-time workers). The law set out to ensure that such workers receive the same benefits as full-time workers and trade unions were given statutory rights to institute legal proceedings against employers or temporary work agencies if the provisions of the new law were evaded. That same year, the government passed legislation to ensure the full, legal eligibility of women for all civil service posts and an active policy was adopted to encourage them to come forward for promotion. In 1981, legislation was passed which permitted the establishment of local private radio stations. In March 1982, a “Special Statute” was granted to Corsica, which set the territory apart legally from other regions and provided it with additional state subsidies and greater autonomy over cultural, social, economic, and educational policies. Various measures were also introduced to improve conditions for migrants. A new drive began in 1981 to encourage local authorities to establish programmes including literacy programmes, housing schemes, and the setting up of young people’s and women’s groups, and in 1983 France ratified the Council of Europe’s Convention on the Legal Status of Migrant Workers. The Association Law of 1981 allowed foreigners {{for the first time to}} form associations in France under the same rules that governed citizens, and these new immigrant associations were thereafter eligible to receive public funding. New policies removed the French language requirements of immigrants to run for seats in employee institutions, and foreign workers became eligible for the first time to sit on important industrial relations councils known as the Conseils des Prud’hommes. In 1982, an existing programme to assist the repatriation of Algerian nationals was replaced by a system offering a choice between vocational training, assistance to set up a small business and a repatriation grant.|$|E
25|$|Decrees {{were made}} in January 1982 {{concerning}} official recognition of persons and bodies responsible for noise monitoring, the monitoring of carbon monoxide and benzene levels in the atmosphere at workplaces, and the inspection of electrical installations. A decree issued in February 1982 laid down safety measures to be taken against electrical hazards arising during the construction, operation and maintenance of electric power distribution installations. A decree issued by the Minister of Labour in March 1982 specified the offices responsible for carrying out the technical tests on particularly dangerous machinery (listed in a decree of April 1981) which are required before the machinery can be officially approved. It also specified the {{information to be provided}} by the person applying for official approval. A decree of May 1982 contained provisions on the setting up, restructuring, organization, financing and tasks of occupational health services in agricultural undertakings and listed those agricultural undertakings for which special medical surveillance is required. Another decree, made that same month, contained new regulations governing health, safety and preventive health measures in public undertakings. It laid down detailed health and safety requirements and specified how these were to be met. It also contained provisions on training in the area, medical surveillance, and health and safety services. Two Orders of July 1982 amended the rules applicable to <b>fixed-term</b> contracts and temporary work with the intention of restricting the use of casual labour and improving the living and working conditions of workers in insecure jobs. A law of July 1982 concerning the spouses of craftsmen and tradesmen employed in the family business amended the provisions of the labour code, social security system, civil code and company law to establish an occupational status for this group of people. In June 1982, a new popular savings book paying index-linked interest was introduced, under which Individuals domiciled for tax purposes in France and whose tax liability was under FF 1 000 were entitled to hold a maximum of FF 10000 (FF 20000 for households) savings in that scheme. Also in 1982, holidays for the low-paid were encouraged by an extension of holiday Vouchers (Cheques-Vacances), subsidized by the employer and requiring regular saving out of earnings. A banking law of January 1984 entitled individuals lacking current accounts who had been refused by three banks to ask the Bank of France to designate a bank or the postal bank to provide them with free accounts.|$|E

500|$|Unlike {{earlier in}} the Republic, legionaries were no longer {{fighting}} on a seasonal basis to protect their land. Instead, they received standard pay, and were employed by the state on a <b>fixed-term</b> basis.

A destabilising consequence of this development was that the proletariat [...] "acquired a stronger and more elevated position" [...] within the state.|$|E
500|$|Unlike {{earlier in}} the Republic, legionaries were no longer {{fighting}} on a seasonal basis to protect their land. Instead, they received standard pay, and were employed by the state on a <b>fixed-term</b> basis. As a consequence, military duty began to appeal most to the poorest sections of society, to whom a guaranteed salary was attractive. The army therefore consisted of a far higher proportion of the poor—particularly the rural poor—than it had previously. A destabilising consequence of this development was that the proletariat [...] "acquired a stronger and more elevated position" [...] within the state. This professionalisation of the military was necessary to provide permanent garrisons for newly acquired and distant territories such as Hispania, something not possible under an army of seasonal citizen militia.|$|E
500|$|The monarch {{could force}} the {{dissolution}} of Parliament through a refusal of royal assent; this would inevitably lead to a government resigning. By convention, the monarch always assents to bills; {{the last time the}} royal assent was not given was in 1708 during the reign of Queen Anne when she withheld royal assent from the Scottish Militia Bill. This {{does not mean that the}} right to refuse has died: George V believed he could veto the Third Irish Home Rule Bill; Jennings writes that [...] "it was assumed by the King throughout that he had not only the legal power but the constitutional right to refuse assent". The royal prerogative to dissolve Parliament was abrogated by the <b>Fixed-term</b> Parliaments Act 2011. Section 6(1) of the Act however specifically states that the monarch's power to prorogue Parliament is not affected by the Act.|$|E
500|$|In 1950 the King's Private Secretary Sir Alan [...] "Tommy" [...] Lascelles, writing pseudonymously to The Times {{newspaper}} asserted {{a constitutional}} convention: {{according to the}} Lascelles Principles, if a minority government asked to dissolve Parliament to call an early election to strengthen its position, the monarch could refuse, and would do so under three conditions. When Harold Wilson requested a dissolution late in 1974, the Queen granted his request as Heath had already failed to form a coalition. The resulting general election gave Wilson a small majority. The monarch could in theory unilaterally dismiss a Prime Minister, but a Prime Minister's term now {{comes to an end}} only by electoral defeat, death, or resignation. The last monarch to remove a Prime Minister was William IV, who dismissed Lord Melbourne in 1834. The <b>Fixed-term</b> Parliaments Act 2011 removed the monarch's authority to dissolve Parliament; the Act specifically retained the monarch's power of prorogation however, which is a regular feature of the parliamentary calendar.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Fixed-Term</b> Employees (Prevention of Less Favourable Treatment) Regulations 2002 cover {{people with}} {{contracts}} that purport {{to last for}} a limited duration. The Regulations (unlike the Directive appears to require) were written to only cover [...] "employees" [...] and not the broader group of [...] "workers". In contrast, the European Court of Justice held in Mangold v Helm that equality was a general principle of EU law. This meant that a German Act which required <b>fixed-term</b> contracts be objectively justified after two years work, but gave no protection to workers beyond the age of 52, was unlawful. Likewise, the UK Regulations ban less favourable treatment of <b>fixed-term</b> staff without objective justification. Less generous than other countries, regulation 8 says if an employee has a succession of fixed term contracts lasting over 4 years, the employee is {{to be treated as}} having a permanent contract. In practice, UK law already regulated <b>fixed-term</b> work in this respect, because the qualifying period for unfair dismissal will be met even if an employee has had short breaks in employment.|$|E
