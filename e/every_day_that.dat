5|$|The {{originally}} scheduled June 2014 opening {{was delayed}} due to several mechanical problems, including leaky pipes, broken exhaust fans due to sudden vibrations, and failing bolts.

5|$|The race {{itself was}} much like its Greek counterpart, {{although}} there were usually 24 races <b>every</b> <b>day</b> <b>that,</b> during the fourth century, took place on 66 days each year. However, a race consisted of only 7 laps (and later 5 laps, so {{that there could be}} even more races per day), instead of the 12 laps of the Greek race. The Roman style was also more money-oriented; racers were professionals and there was widespread betting among spectators. There were four-horse chariots (quadrigae) and two-horse chariots (bigae), but the four-horse races were more important. In rare cases, if a driver wanted to show off his skill, he could use up to 10 horses, although this was extremely impractical.|$|E

25|$|Locusts are the {{swarming}} {{phase of}} the short-horned grasshoppers of the family Acrididae. Some species can breed rapidly under suitable conditions and subsequently become gregarious and migratory. They form bands as nymphs and swarms as adults—both of which can travel great distances, rapidly stripping fields and greatly damaging crops. The largest swarms can cover hundreds of square miles and contain billions of locusts. A locust can eat its own weight (about 2grams) in plants <b>every</b> <b>day.</b> <b>That</b> means one million locusts can eat about one ton of food each day, and the largest swarms can consume over 100,000 tonnes each day.|$|E

25|$|In Israel, Jewish {{circumcision}} {{is entirely}} legal, as is posthumous circumcision. In 1999, the Israeli Supreme Court overruled {{an attempt to}} have after-death circumcision outlawed. Though illegal, female circumcision is still practiced among the Negev Bedouin, and tribal secrecy among the Bedouin {{makes it difficult for}} authorities to enforce the ban. In 2013, Rabbinical court in Israel ordered a mother, Elinor Daniel, to circumcise her son or pay a fine of 500 Israeli Shekel for <b>every</b> <b>day</b> <b>that</b> the child is not circumcised. She appealed against the Rabbinical court ruling and the High Court ruled in her favour stating, among other considerations, the basic right of freedom from religion.|$|E

25|$|The National Christmas Tree again {{remained}} largely unlit in 1980. President Carter's five-year-old grandson, Jason, {{switched on the}} tree. The tree had been completely decorated with large balls and lights, but {{at a meeting in}} early December 1980 the families of the American hostages asked that the tree remain unlit. The lights on the tree shone for 417 seconds, one second for <b>every</b> <b>day</b> <b>that</b> the hostages had been captive. The lights were then turned off, leaving only the star atop the tree shining. When the hostages were released on January 20, 1981, the tree was redecorated. It was relit for the returning hostages on January 27. 1980 was also the first year that the Pageant of Peace organizers were required by the National Park Service to hold an open meeting to solicit input from the public. Once again, a separate small tree honored of American prisoners of war.|$|E
25|$|On 16 July, the Ottoman Army, having {{concentrated}} more forces {{than the}} Russians, thwarted a planned Russian offensive {{and pushed the}} Russian Army back at the Battle of Manzikert (10–26 July 1915), capturing the city. There then followed the Battle of Kara Killisse which saw the Russian recapture of Manzikert. As {{a result of these}} operations to the north of Lake Van, the Russians evacuated their remaining combat forces from the city of Van. Armen Garo, and his assistant, Khetcho asked General Abatzieff to permit the Armenian inhabitants in the Van area to move with the Russian army toward Igdir. This request was rejected {{on the grounds that the}} movement of vital Russian army transports could not done promptly if hampered by refugees. For eight consecutive days during July, General Nikolaeff kept the Armenian leaders idle. The Russian General told them <b>every</b> <b>day</b> <b>that</b> he would not retreat under any circumstances, and that therefore it was entirely needless to remove the people.|$|E

500|$|McGovern {{had made}} several real estate {{investments}} in the D.C.area and became interested in hotel operations. In 1988, using the money he had earned from his speeches, the McGoverns bought, renovated, and began running a 150-room inn in Stratford, Connecticut, {{with the goal of}} providing a hotel, restaurant and public conference facility. It went into bankruptcy in 1990 and closed the following year. In 1992, McGovern's published reflections on the experience appeared in Wall Street Journal and the Nation's Restaurant News. He attributed part of the failure to the early 1990s recession, but also part to the cost of dealing with federal, state and local regulations that were passed with good intentions but made life difficult for small businesses, and to the cost of dealing with frivolous lawsuits. McGovern wrote, [...] "I... wish that during the years I was in public office I had had this firsthand experience about the difficulties business people face <b>every</b> <b>day.</b> <b>That</b> knowledge would have made me a better U.S.senator and a more understanding presidential contender." [...] His statement would still be resonating with American conservatives two decades later.|$|E
