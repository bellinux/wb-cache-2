5000|$|Mixed <b>flowing</b> <b>gas</b> (MFG) {{is a type}} of {{laboratory}} environmental testing for products, particularly electronics, to evaluate resistance to corrosion due to gases in the atmosphere. Mixed <b>Flowing</b> <b>Gas</b> (MFG) test is a laboratory test in which the temperature (°C), relative humidity (%RH), concentration of gaseous pollutants (in parts per billion, ppb or parts per million ppm level), and other critical variables (such as volume exchange rate and airflow rate) are carefully defined, monitored and controlled. The purpose of this test is to simulate corrosion phenomenon due to atmospheric exposure. The electronic product is exposed to gases such as chlorine, hydrogen sulfide, nitrogen dioxide, and sulfur dioxide at levels in the parts per billion range, in a controlled environmental chamber. Test samples that have been exposed to MFG testing have ranged from bare metal surfaces, to electrical connectors, and to complete assemblies. In regards to noble metalplated connector applications, MFG testing has been widely accepted as a qualification test method to evaluate the performance of these connectors.|$|E

50|$|There {{are several}} {{important}} assumptions {{involved in the}} underlying theory of compressible flow.

Instead, the continuum assumption allows us to consider a <b>flowing</b> <b>gas</b> as a continuous substance except at low densities. This assumption provides a huge simplification which is accurate for most gas-dynamic problems. Only in the low-density realm of rarefied gas dynamics does the motion of individual molecules become important.|$|E

50|$|However, in many applications, {{the thermal}} {{properties}} of the fluid can be dependent upon fluid composition. In such applications, varying composition of the fluid during actual operation can affect the thermal flow measurement. Therefore, {{it is important for}} the thermal flow meter supplier to know the composition of the fluid so that the proper calibration factor can be used to determine the flow rate accurately. Suppliers can provide appropriate calibration information for other gas mixtures, however the accuracy of the thermal flow meter is dependent on the actual gas mixture being the same as the gas mixture used for calibration purposes. In other words, the accuracy of a thermal flow meter calibrated for a given gas mixture will be degraded if the actual <b>flowing</b> <b>gas</b> has a different composition.|$|E
50|$|ASC {{works with}} its customer's {{internal}} engineers {{to solve problems}} involving the flow of fluids (gases or liquids) in or around {{a wide variety of}} equipment or goods. Some problems include simply the flow itself. These include such things as reducing pressure drop, eliminating flow induced vibrations, or ensuring uniform flow through an equipment that processes elements of the flow (e.g., pollution reduction equipment such as a catalyst or an electrostatic precipitator). Since fluid flow carries energy, heat transfer problems such as improving thermal mixing or heating/cooling characteristics are often solved. Similarly, ASC undertakes many problems involving the pneumatic transport of particulate. The chemical reactions in a <b>flowing</b> <b>gas</b> or liquid are also the subject of ASC studies. Methods used to solve these problems include: Numerical simulation (including Computational fluid dynamics), Wind tunnel testing, Laboratory modeling (including Scale models), and Field testing.|$|E

Heat is often used to assist in the desorption of volatile species from the sample. Ions are formed by chemical ionization in the gas phase. A direct analysis in real time source operates by exposing the sample to a dry gas stream (typically helium or nitrogen) that contains long-lived electronically or vibronically excited neutral atoms or molecules (or [...] "metastables"). Excited states are typically formed in the DART source by creating a glow discharge in a chamber through which the gas flows. A similar method called atmospheric solids analysis probe ASAP uses the heated gas from ESI or APCI probes to vaporize sample placed on a melting point tube inserted into an ESI/APCI source. [...] Ionization is by APCI.|$|E

40|$|Self-aligning {{soldering}} {{technology is}} being developed for low cost, passive, precision optical alignments. To avoid contamination problems, the solder reflow process must use reacting or inert gas instead of chemical flux materials. Since the accuracy of these optical alignments should reach the range of a few micrometers (μm), the <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> may affect the aligning process. Therefore, {{the effects of the}} <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> on the self-aligning process must be understood. The experiments described show that <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> effects do exist. The top plate, 8. 4 mm × 8. 4 mm, can be moved by the <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> by as much as 4. 5 μm and 7. 8 μm at <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> rates of 2. 5 L/min and 5. 0 L/min, respectively. The numerical analysis in this study models the <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> effects {{for a wide range of}} chip sizes, solder geometry, and <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> direction. In the numerical analysis, fluid computation and solder force calculation are conducted to study the <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> effects on chip displacement that is the distance away from the well aligned position along the <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> direction. The results show that the <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> effects are related to many factors including chip size, <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> rate, solder height, and flow direction. For a one-dimensional laser array, these effects are negligible because the chip size is very small.

40|$|We use {{high-resolution}} cosmological hydrodynamic simulations {{to study}} the angular momentum acquisition of gaseous halos around Milky-Way-sized galaxies. We find that cold mode accreted gas enters a galaxy halo with ~ 70 % more specific angular momentum than dark matter averaged over cosmic time (though with a very large dispersion).
