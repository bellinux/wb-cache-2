40|$|In Brazil, citrus {{black spot}} (CBS) caused by Guignardia citricarpa {{is a major}} disease that has {{different}} symptoms on fruit. In this study, fruit of Citrus sinensis infected by G. citricarpa and showing the symptoms false melanosis, freckle <b>spot</b> and <b>hard</b> <b>spot</b> were cross-sectioned and analysed anatomically and histochemically by light microscopy. Immuno-histological assays were performed. All symptoms were accompanied by a thickening of the cuticle. False melanosis lesions did not contain pycnidia and remained restricted to the epicarp or to the first layers of the mesocarp. The stomata {{in this type of}} lesion showed phenolic compounds in the guard cells and in the sub-stomatal chamber. In some samples, the guard cells and their surrounding cells lysed, and a wound meristem began to form underneath them. Freckle <b>spot</b> and <b>hard</b> <b>spot</b> lesions had very similar histological alterations to the epicarp and mesocarp, but in our samples only <b>hard</b> <b>spot</b> lesions contained pycnidia. Both of these symptoms were accompanied by protein inclusions. Epidermal and sub-epidermal cells located in the oil-gland region were obliterated, causing alterations in these structures. All symptoms had regions that stained strongly for lipids and phenols.

A doubled-sided {{lapping machine}} of {{grinding}} stone manufactured of a SiC as an abrasive, specific resin and other thermosetting resin were developed for grinding {{process of the}} substrate of hard disk drive (HDD) made up of aluminum since the conventional lapping machine cause the serious quality problem of the magnetic substrate. However, at certain parameter during the grinding process, the abrasive stone was clogging due to the agglomeration of debris from the substrate which cause scratches on the magnetic substrates and affect its performance. The samples were classified into four parts (soft <b>spot,</b> border <b>spot,</b> <b>hard</b> <b>spot,</b> and unused spot). Characterizations of the samples were done using XRF, SEM and FTIR analysis.

50|$|These bugs are {{a common}} garden insect which may damage {{a wide variety of}} crops {{including}} cotton, peaches and tomatoes, and seeds such as beans, black-eyed peas and sorghum. Like other bugs L. phyllopus suck juices from plants by puncturing them with their sucking mouth parts, making them resistant to ingested pesticides. A toxin is injected into the plant when piercing its skin, causing discoloration and <b>hard</b> <b>spots</b> on fruits. The adult bugs are highly resistant to pesticides; however, they are vulnerable in their bright orange nymph stage.

5000|$|Sheet plywood boat {{building}} uses {{sheets of}} plywood panels usually fixed to longitudinal long wood such the chines, inwhales (sheer clamps) or intermediate stringers {{which are all}} bent around a series of frames. By attaching the ply sheets to the longwood rather than directly to the frames this avoids <b>hard</b> <b>spots</b> or an unfair hull. Plywood may be laminated into a round hull or used in single sheets. These hulls generally have one or more chines and the method is called Ply on Frame construction. A subdivision of the sheet plywood boat building method {{is known as the}} stitch-and-glue method, where pre-shaped panels of plywood are drawn together then edge glued and reinforced with fibreglass without the use of a frame. Metal or plastic ties, nylon fishing line or copper wires pull curved flat panels into three-dimensional curved shapes. These hulls generally have one or more chines. Marine grade plywood of good quality is designated [...] "WBP" [...] (which stands for water- and boiled-proof) or more usually BS 1088. Australian plywood manufacturers and suppliers have issued warnings that some Asian nations are selling ply stamped BS 1088 which does not meet international standards. Specifically, they say outer plies are too thin (should be 1.2 mm minimum) or are very thin (less than 0.5 mm) or high-grade surface ply such as Okoume is combined with a much heavier and wider inner cores. Most high-grade marine Okoume (Gaboon) ply uses lightweight poplar inner cores. Often the 1088 stamp is blurred in the poor Asian ply so it is not clear. In Australia and New Zealand a higher-grade marine ply than BS1088 is AS2272. It requires both faces to be [...] "A" [...] quality, with even-thickness plies. The most common plywood used for this grade is plantation-grown Hoop Pine which is fine grained, very smooth, moderately light (at [...] it is the same weight as Meranti ply and about 13% heavier than genuine poplar cored BS1088 Okoume). Hoop pine has a very high stress rating of F17, indicating high strength. Meranti (Lauan) ply has a stress rating of F14 and Okoume ply F8. Okoume ply is commonly coated with epoxy to increase strength and impact resistance as well as to exclude water. Both types of plywood construction are very popular with amateur builders, and many dinghies such as the Vaurien, Cherub, Tolman, Moth and P class (ply on frame construction) and FJs, FDs and Kolibris (stitch-and-glue method) have been built from it. Another variation is tortured ply where very thin(3 mm) and flexible (often Okoume)preshaped panels ply are bent into compound curves and sewn together. Little or no framework or longitudinal wood is used. This method is mainly confined to kayaks.|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references: 98 - 105. A system of finite element modeling combined with graphics. elastogram generation was used to study the detection of <b>hard</b> <b>spots</b> in beef rations. Finite element was used to model the structural deformation of beef steaks under compression while elastogram was generated using cross-correlation techniques on congruent compression RF echo sequences. The system was first used to determine the optimal elastography conditions for segments of pro-and post-detection of <b>hard</b> <b>spots</b> in packaged beef rations. Three different models, halogenous model, non-homogenous model and orthotropic model were established for beef steaks and the elastograms with different sizes and ratios of moduli of elasticity (modulus ratios) of <b>hard</b> <b>spots</b> to surrounding tissue were generated under the selected conditions. The elastograms were segmented using an automatic thresholding algorithm and the results were used to analyze the detection of <b>hard</b> <b>spots.</b> The optimal conditions determined for elastography were an applied strain of 1. 0 %, a sampling frequency of 35 MHz, a signal-to-noise ratio of 10, and a transducer frequency of 5 MHz. There were significant differences among three models for <b>hard</b> <b>spots</b> detection. The orthotropic model described the structure of beef steaks most precisely and had the smallest detected error for hard spot detection among the three models. Sizes of hard spot, modulus ratios of hard spot versus background, and relative positions of <b>hard</b> <b>spots</b> are factors affecting the detection of <b>hard</b> <b>spots</b> for elastography. The larger the size of hard spot, or the higher the modulus ratio, the smaller the relative error of the hard spot detection. In order for spots to be detected, they must have at least 4 mm of diameter with 5. 0 modulus ratio or 2. 5 modulus ratio with 6 mm of diameter. The relative positions of <b>hard</b> <b>spots</b> also was a factor affecting the individual detection of <b>hard</b> <b>spots</b> when more than one hard spot existed in the sample. Interference between <b>hard</b> <b>spots</b> may cause noise in elastogram. Three automatic thresholding segmentation algorithms were also developed in this study. They selected the threshold value for segmentation based on the contour lines, the local minima of the histogram of the elastogram, and the magnitude of gradient of the Image...|$|E

40|$|Observations from in-situ video records {{acquired}} during laboratory ice crushing {{experiments and}} medium scale indentation tests at Hobson's Choice Ice Island exhibit remarkable consistency. Spalling of ice {{away from the}} contact zone produces a sawtooth pattern in the load records and {{nearly all of the}} actual movement of the indentor into the ice occurs during the sharp drops in load associated with the spalls. The majority of the load is borne on relatively intact ice (<b>hard</b> <b>spots)</b> where the pressure, from calculations using load data and measured hard spot areas and from pressure sensors, is in the range 40 - 70 MPa. The visual data show how spalling determines the evolution of hard spot size and shape during the tests. Melt produced in the hard spot areas has been observed in the laboratory tests and its thickness measured. Significant quantities of melt produced in Hobson's Choice tests have also been documented. All of these observations are consistent with a process of heat generation, and consequent melt production, caused by viscous flow of a thin layer of liquid in the high pressure zones. This process accounts for the bulk of the energy dissipation in the experiments and explains how an indentor can rapidly move forward on <b>hard</b> <b>spots</b> consisting of relatively undamaged ice.
