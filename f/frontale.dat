40|$|Lélia Picabia - Appositions nominales et déterminant zéro : le cas des appositions <b>frontales</b> Nominal appositions exhibit anaphoric {{properties}} and {{are linked to}} their antecedent by a BE-type relation. The initial assumption {{of this paper is}} that nominal appositions behave as nonref erring, nominal predicates. The comparison of fronted appositions and specificational sentences reveals that in both constructions, the fronted (nonrefe- rential) phrase receives a list-reading, a type of interpretation typically associated with an event-type, stage-level predicate. It further appears that apposed nominals which include a null determiner are steadily associated with a stage-level reading, whatever their linear position with respect to their antecedent; contrastively, apposed nominals which include the overt indefinite determiner (un) are associated with an individual-level readin. A correlate appears to exist between the type of determiner and the syntactic locus of the apposed nominal : the null determiner occurs in fronted appositions (even though these may be moved to the right), while the indefinite determiner occurs in postposed appositions. These descriptive results lead us to conclude that the null and indefinite determiners must have their own syntactic function, and more precisely, must correspond to some functional heads.

40|$|An experiment, {{designed}} to overcome shortcomings in previous work, {{was conducted to}} investigate the potential symptomatic benefits of relaxation training {{in the treatment of}} asthma in children. Fourteen chronic, severely asthmatic children received three sessions in which they rested quietly, followed by five sessions of relaxation training, and finally three sessions of relaxing as trained previously. Pulmonary function was assessed, in a manner far more definitive than in previous studies, before and after each session, and three additional times at 30 -minute intervals thereafter. Tension in the <b>frontales</b> muscles, heart and respiration rates, and skin temperature and conductance were also monitored. Heart rate and to some extent muscle tension results tended to confirm the attainment of relaxed states. However, the lung function results failed to substantiate the previous, preliminary findings of a clinically meaningful change in pulmonary function following relaxation. The status of relaxation in the treatment of asthma was discussed...|$|R

During the March 1977 Antiprod 1 -MD 12 cruise, hydrological {{data were collected}} along 66 ° 30 E between 40 and 62 ° 8. These data show a frontal zone between 43 and 46 ° 8 which separates the antarctic and subtropical regions and within which is concentrated most of the circumpolar current. The frontal zone {{is due to the}} coalescence of the antarctic and subtropical convergences into a single convergence zone, effectively eliminating the subantarctic region. The few observations made previously in the Kerguelen-Crozet area show a similar structure. However, the frontal zone which is located between 43 and 46 ° 8 in the Kerguelen region (60 °- 75 °E) is located three degrees further north, between 41 and 43 ° 8, in the Crozet region (50 °E). The coalescence of the two fronts was due to the northward translation of the antarctic convergence west of Crozet Islands, a possible effect of the bottom topography. Oceanol.

The two were co-founders of the JSL Second Division in 1972 and, although spent 20 seasons (1979 to 1999) in separate tiers, rekindled the rivalry in the late 1990s as Kawasaki fans deserted Verdy to support <b>Frontale,</b> seen as a more community-focused club, and since then their fortunes have reversed as <b>Frontale</b> is a top flight mainstay while Verdy sunk into the second tier beginning in 2005.|$|E

Malacoceros cariacoensis n. sp. can be differentiated by {{the shape of the}} prostomium, which has two short frontal horns and the posterior portion laterally prolonged into a faintly demarcated, double-looped nuchal organ, extending to the base of setiger 2, a reduction in the size of setiger 1, the absence of body pigmentation, and the number of apical teeth on the hooded hooks. Rhynchospio harrisae n. sp. differs from other species of the genus in that the peristomium is moderately developed with low lateral wings, and the anterior notopodial setae are arranged in two rows with a superior tuft of capillaries. A key to Malacoceros species worldwide is provided.

40|$|The {{functional}} {{role of the}} thalamus and its cortical network memory processes is controversial. The anterior nuclei of the thalamus are thought to underlie recall, while the mediodorsal nucleus has been proposed to process recognition. In this work, a novel procedure for assessing lesions in the human thalamus based on magnetic resonance images {{has been used to}} correlate the lesion extent with behavioral deficits in patients with thalamic ischemia. The involvement oft he thalamus in recognition and recall has been studied in healthy subjects using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Results suggest a complex pattern of structure-function relationships within the thalamus. A mediodorsal thalamic-prefrontal cortical network underlay recall and was active during encording and retrieval. An anterior thalamic-retrosplenial network was especially active during the retrieval phase of recall. These findings lay the basis for more refined functional parcellation of the human thalamus. Die Beteiligung des menschlichen Thalamus an Ged 4 chtnisprozessen wird kontrovers diskutiert. So wird davon ausgegangen, dass die anterioren thalamischen Kerne an der freien Reproduktion und der mediodorsale Kern an der Wiedererkennung beteiligt sind. In der vorliegenden Arbeit wurden beide Prozesse sowohl bei Patenten mit isch 4 mischen L 4 sionen des Thalamus als auch mittels funktioneller Magnetresonanztomographie bei gesunden Probanden untersucht. Im Zug der Untersuchung der Patientengruppe wurde eine neue, magnetresonanztomographisch gest Methode zur Evaluation von L 4 sionen im menschlichen Thalamus entwickelt.
