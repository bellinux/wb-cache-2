5|$|A last {{group of}} sheep breeds {{is that of}} fur or <b>hair</b> <b>sheep,</b> which do not grow wool at all. <b>Hair</b> <b>sheep</b> {{are similar to the}} early domesticated sheep kept before woolly breeds were developed, and are raised for meat and pelts. Some modern breeds of <b>hair</b> <b>sheep,</b> such as the Dorper, result from crosses between wool and hair breeds. For meat and hide producers, <b>hair</b> <b>sheep</b> are cheaper to keep, as they do not need shearing. <b>Hair</b> <b>sheep</b> are also more {{resistant}} to parasites and hot weather.|$|E

5000|$|The Pelibuey (also {{known as}} Cubano Rojo) is a breed of {{domestic}} sheep {{raised in the}} Caribbean, Mexico, and South America. The Pelibuey is a breed of <b>hair</b> <b>sheep,</b> meaning they do not generally grow wool. This adaptation makes them especially useful for tropical environments where heavily wooled sheep do not thrive. The breed is thought to originate in Africa, specifically from the West African Dwarf sheep. [...] This breed is primarily raised for meat.|$|E
50|$|Red Maasai sheep {{are named}} for their usual color of red-brown, {{though they may}} also be pied. The breed is a <b>hair</b> <b>sheep,</b> meaning it does not produce wool, though it may have a shaggy coat of hair. It is also a fat-tailed sheep breed known for visibly large fat {{deposits}} in its tail and hindquarters. Red Maasai are medium-to-large bodied sheep. All of these factors mean the Red Maasai is suited to meat production instead of fiber.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to evaluate heat tolerance of thirty crossbred sheep (Santa Ines with Dorper) with white and black coat under heat stress. The experiment was conducted in September and October of 2012 and a completely randomized design was used. Before and after one hour exposure to solar radiation (14 h 00 - 15 h 00), rectal temperature, respiratory rate and surface temperature of the animals were measured. The Black Globe Temperature Humidity Index, the Heat Tolerance Index and the Heat Tolerance Coefficient were calculated. The values found for the Black Globe Temperature Humidity Index in the sun and in the shade were 89. 08 and 82. 81 respectively. Animals coat coloring did not influence on their rectal temperature and there was no difference on the heat tolerance index. It was verified the effect of coat coloring on the respiratory rate in dark colored <b>hair</b> coat <b>sheep</b> (P < 0. 05) and the effect of the environment and coat coloring on the surface temperature and on the heat tolerance coefficient under the sun. Dark colored <b>hair</b> coat <b>sheep</b> presented lower heat tolerance...|$|R
50|$|The breed is {{believed}} to be descended from African sheep that were brought to the Caribbean on slave ships, and is a breed of <b>hair</b> <b>sheep</b> which does not grow wool. The St Croix is a hardy tropical breed known for its parasite resistance, and is raised primarily for meat production. Breeders have crossbred the St Croix with other breeds to impart these important traits into their bloodlines. The St Croix breed is the foundation breed for Katahdin and Royal White breeds.|$|E
50|$|The Blackhead Persian (also {{known as}} Swartkoppersie) is a fat-tailed breed of {{domestic}} sheep from Africa.The sheep is originally from Somalia (the Somali inhabited {{areas of the}} Horn of Africa) and a direct descendant of the Somali sheep. The breed is also a type of <b>hair</b> <b>sheep,</b> meaning they do not grow wool and tolerate heat better than wooled breeds and are raised primarily for meat. The Blackhead Persian has a white body and, as their name would suggest, an entirely black head.|$|E
50|$|Meatmasters are fat-tailed <b>hair</b> <b>sheep</b> (meaning {{they lack}} wool which {{requires}} shearing), {{come in a}} diverse array of colors, and may be either horned or polled. The focus in breeding is mostly on meat production, {{but they are also}} very hardy and with good mothering instincts (inherited from their Damara breeding). Rams weigh from 85 to 105 kilograms and ewes 60-70 kg. They are now found in all nine provinces of South Africa and are especially valued in the northern bush veld areas. Meatmasters have been exported to Namibia, Australia, and Canada.|$|E
50|$|Similar effects {{apply to}} animals, with fur acting as {{additional}} factor for both increased particle retention and partial skin shielding. Unshorn thickly wooled sheep are well protected; while the epilation threshold for sheared sheep is between 23-47 Gy (2500-5000 rep) and the threshold for normally wooled face is 47-93 Gy (5000-10000 rep), for thickly wooled (33 mm <b>hair</b> length) <b>sheep</b> it is 93-140 Gy (10000-15000 rep). To produce skin lesions comparable with contagious pustular dermatitis, the estimated dose is between 465-1395 Gy.|$|R
5|$|The nest, {{built by}} both adults over several weeks, {{is made from}} several hundred mud pellets and lined with {{feathers}} and soft, dry grass, <b>hair,</b> <b>sheep’s</b> wool or plant down. It may be a half-cup when constructed under an overhang on a vertical wall or cliff, or shaped as a bowl {{like that of the}} barn swallow when placed on a sheltered ledge. The nest may be built on a rock cliff face, in a crevice or on a man-made structure, and is re-used for the second brood and in subsequent years. Caves are found in limestone formations and in the lava flows which cover much of western Saudi Arabia, and their ceilings are a favoured location for nesting pale crag martins, red-rumped swallows, and the little swifts which may appropriate the hirundines' nests. In buildings, nests are usually constructed against concrete, which provides adhesion similar to that of rock, but metal walls are sometimes used, and nests may be supported on beams or other horizontal supports. Birds sometimes breed in occupied buildings, and there is a record of a pair nesting in a busy restaurant kitchen. Artificial nests are readily used, and halved coconut shells have been successfully occupied in Abu Dhabi.|$|R

5000|$|The Meatmaster is a {{breed of}} {{domestic}} sheep native to South Africa. Bred {{in the early}} 1990s from various <b>hair</b> <b>sheep</b> breeds, the Meatmaster was created {{with the goal of}} improving the meat characteristics of African fat-tailed sheep breeds. The fat-tailed sheep had various advantageous characteristics such as hardiness and suitability for desert life, but was slow to mature, had a poor distribution of fat and lacked the muscling of the hind quarters of European breeds. The composite breed increased the amount of muscle and had a better distribution of fat but retained the hair (rather than wool) coat and other desirable traits such as resistance to tick-borne diseases and a good flocking instinct.|$|E
50|$|The Van Rooy, {{also known}} as the Van Rooy White Persian, is a breed of {{domestic}} sheep native to South Africa. The Van Rooy was first developed in 1906 by (and named for) J. C. van Rooy, a South African Senator and farmer in the Bethulie district. The Van Rooy is cross between indigenous Ronderib Afrikaner sheep, Blackhead Persian, and Rambouillets. It is a fat-tailed sheep and also a <b>hair</b> <b>sheep,</b> removing the need for shearing and crutching. They are generally kept for meat production, and are very well-suited to arid climates. Van Rooys are polled, have drooping ears, and are entirely white. The breed is relatively rare, even in South Africa, but has also been exported to Namibia and Zimbabwe.|$|E

50|$|This famous find by Natalia Polosmak {{is known}} as the Ice Maiden. She {{discovered}} the mummy in an ancient, and previously undisturbed, burial mound. The mummy was unusual in that it was a woman interred with full ceremonial honors; a rare distinction for a woman at that time. The mummy was intricately tattooed and is estimated to date back to the 5th century BCE. She was beautifully dressed with a black felt headdress which was found intact and decorated with figures that indicated her high social status. She wore a necklace of wooden camels and high boots of leather. Her dress was of woven camel <b>hair</b> and <b>sheep's</b> wool with braided tassels and colored red with insect dye. More tattooed mummies (c. 300 BC) were also extracted from the permafrost at the site.|$|R
50|$|In Garuda Purana, {{there was}} nothing in the {{universe}} except the Brahman. The universe became an expanse of water, and in that Vishnu was born in the golden egg. He created Brahma with four faces. Brahma then created the devas, asuras, pitris and manushas. He also created the rakshasas, yakshas, gandharvas. Other creatures came from the various parts of his body (e.g. snakes from his <b>hair,</b> <b>sheep</b> from his chest, goats from his mouth, cows from his stomach, others from feet). His body hair became the herbs. The four varnas came from his body parts and the four Vedas from his mouths. He created several sons from his mind, Daksha, Daksha's wife, Manu Svaymbhuva, his wife Shatarupta and the rishi Kashypa. Kashypata married thirrteen of Daksha's daughter and all the devas and the createures were born through them. Other Puranas and the Manu Smriti mention several variations of this theory.|$|E
5000|$|The California Red sheep is a {{breed of}} {{domestic}} sheep {{developed in the}} United States in the 1970s. It is so named because its lambs are born all red, and retain this color in their faces and limbs in to adulthood. In the early 1970s, Dr. Glenn Spurlock of Davis, California crossed Tunis sheep and Barbados Blackbelly sheep, and the California Red is consequently a dual - purpose breed {{with many of the}} qualities of its forebears, the out-of season breeding qualities and fleece of the Tunis and the heat tolerance and carcase quality of the Blackbelly. Spurlock actually set out to create a new <b>hair</b> <b>sheep</b> like the Barbados Blackbelly, but though he failed to do so [...] - [...] California Reds have reddish tan hairs intermingled with white wool. [...] - [...] he and other breeders continued to keep developing the strain anyway. The California Red can lamb out of season, thus being able to produce multiple lamb crops in a year. It also functions well in hot weather, and is polled in both sexes.|$|E
40|$|<b>Hair</b> <b>sheep</b> of Caribbean origin {{have become}} an {{important}} part of the U. S. sheep industry. Their lack of wool eliminates a number of health concerns and drastically reduces the cost of production. More importantly, Caribbean <b>hair</b> <b>sheep</b> demonstrate robust production performance even in the presence of drug-resistant gastrointestinal nematodes, a rising concern to the industry. Despite the growing importance of <b>hair</b> <b>sheep</b> in the Americas their genetic origins have remained speculative. Prior to this report no genetic studies were able to identify a unique geographical origin of <b>hair</b> <b>sheep</b> in the New World. Our study clarifies the African and European ancestry of Caribbean <b>hair</b> <b>sheep.</b> Whole-genome structural analysis was conducted on four established breeds of <b>hair</b> <b>sheep</b> from the Caribbean region. Using breeds representing Africa and Europe we establish an objective measure indicating Caribbean <b>hair</b> <b>sheep</b> are derived from Iberian and West African origins. Caribbean <b>hair</b> <b>sheep</b> result from West African introgression into established ecotypes of Iberian descent. Genotypes from 47, 750 autosomal single nucleotide polymorphism markers scored in 290 animals were used to characterize the population structure of the St. Croix, Barbados Blackbelly, Morada Nova, and Santa Ines. Principal components, admixture, and phylogenetic analyses results correlate with historical patterns of colonization and trade. These patterns support co-migration of these sheep with humans...|$|E
40|$|In {{epithelial}} differentiation keratin intermediate filament {{genes are}} expressed in multifarious tissue-specific and stage-specific patterns. Pairs of type I and type II intermediate filament genes, belonging to multigene families, are coordinately regulated, and 4 – 5 genes of each type {{are expressed in}} the hair follicle. Accumulating chromosomal mapping data points to a major locus for each intermediate filament multigene family on separate chromosomes. In this report we describe the isolation of a <b>sheep</b> <b>hair</b> keratin cosmid by chromosome walking that overlaps two previously described cosmids and establishes a continuous 100 -kb segment of cloned DNA containing three hair and three hair-like type II intermediate filament keratin genes. A new hair keratin type II intermediate filament gene, KRT 2. 11, {{is located in the}} middle of the cluster, and partial sequence data reveal a striking conservation of its predicted N-terminal region with other <b>sheep</b> <b>hair</b> keratin type II intermediate filament proteins. Expression analyses demonstrate the presence of a 2. 4 -kb KRT 2. 11 transcript in wool follicle RNA and show that expression occurs in the follicle cortical keratinocytes above the dermal papilla. The three hair genes are clustered within about 40 kb and flanked by hair-like genes that are not expressed in the hair follicle, thereby demarcating a hair keratin gene domain...|$|R
30|$|Knowledge {{of spatial}} {{distribution}} of breeds can aid in developing production environment descriptors and classify breeds for conservation as {{spatial distribution of}} breeds was highly correlated with environmental controls. Naturalised sheep breeds in Brazil {{tend to be more}} localized than commercial breeds which may mean they are at greater risk. <b>Hair</b> and wool <b>sheep</b> tend to occur in specific environments.
