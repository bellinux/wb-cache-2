For diurnal migrants, the sun is used to navigate by day, and a stellar compass is used at night. Birds that use the sun compensate for the changing position of the sun during the day by the use of an internal clock. Orientation with the stellar compass depends on the position of the constellations surrounding Polaris.

They hold that, not only did monks save and cultivate the remnants of ancient civilization during the barbarian invasions, but that the Church promoted learning and science through its sponsorship of many universities which, under its leadership, grew rapidly in Europe in the 11th and 12th centuries.

La Trobe Archaeology has major focuses in Australian Indigenous Archaeology, African Archaeology and Palaeoanthropology, Palaeolithic Archaeology, Middle Eastern Prehistoric Archaeology, Australian Historical Archaeology, Biomolecular Archaeology, Asian Archaeology, Archaeology and GIS, Geoarchaeology and Archaeological Geophysics. La Trobe Archaeology currently runs excavations, field schools and conducts research in Australia, Jordan, South Africa, Kenya, Bulgaria, and Sri Lanka. This includes the Australian Palaeoanthropological and Geoarchaeology Field School at the Drimolen early hominin site in South Africa, run jointly with the University of Johannesburg since 2013. Archaeology is also aligned to La Trobe's research focus area in Transforming Human Societies. In 2011 the university, in conjunction with the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences and Andy Herries, an associate professor, built the Australian Archaeomagnetism Laboratory (TAAL), based within the Department of Archaeology, Environment and Community Planning. The main aim and focus of research in the laboratory is promoting the use of magnetic methods of analysis (palaeomagnetism, rock magnetism, archaeomagnetic dating and magnetostratigraphy) for understanding the age, palaeoenvironmental/climate context and site formation history of archaeological and fossil sites, as well as archaeometric archaeometry) analysis of archaeological artefacts for understanding behavioural information such as material sourcing and the development of pyrotechnology. The laboratory also undertakes other research with the Department of Physics, including comparative work at the Australian Synchrotron. In conjunction with the <b>Geomagnetism</b> Laboratory at the University of Liverpool, TAAL has a major focus on reconstructing palaeosecular variation from southern hemisphere archaeological sources (mostly in Australia and southern Africa) over the last 5 Ma, with the aim of constructing an Australian Archaeomagnetic Curve. This currently includes work on the 50 ka long sequence of human occupation at Lake Mungo in Australia where La Trobe Archaeology directs field excavations and survey. In 2011 the laboratory was involved in dating the age of the new South African hominin species Australopithecus sediba, which was published in the journal [...] "Science". TAAL's director, Andy Herries is currently an Australian Research Council funded Future Fellow in the Geochronology of Human Evolution and is a recognised world leader in the magnetic analysis of karst deposits (caves sediments and speleothem, e.g., stalagmites). He been responsible with colleagues for providing many of the first dates for South African hominin sites. African Archaeology and Paleoanthropology is a major focus of the TAAL and archaeology at La Trobe. Main focuses of research in the laboratory are 1) the role of heat treatment of stone for the manufacture of stone tools in the archaeological record; 2) the age of Australian marsupial fossil sites; 3) creating a chronological framework for the Palaeolithic and human evolution in Africa and Asia; 4) reconstructing occupation intensity, spatial patterning, fire use and palaeoclimatic records from archaeological sites. La Trobe Archaeology in conjunction with the School of Molecular Sciences also runs a stable isotope facility directed by Colin Smith, an ARC Future Fellow. The laboratory's main research emphasis is investigating the preservation of biomolecules in archaeological skeletal tissue and how this affects the information they contain.|$|E
