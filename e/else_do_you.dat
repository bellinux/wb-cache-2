In his next {{appearance}} vs. Yale, despite scoring only six points, he posted a career-high 13 rebounds. Teammate Stéphane Lasme added 10 boards. Lappas said, [...] "What <b>else</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> say about Anthony Anderson? He had thirteen rebounds in the game. Its {{great to see}} Anthony have six points {{in the game and}} win. We couldn't have one a game like this in a million years with Anthony Anderson only scoring six points. You don't even notice it now, where when he didn't score before we almost didn't have a chance. It's good for him {{to go out there and}} play and direct these kids that he has out there under him." [...] In mid-December 2004, Anderson was suspended for three games after failing a drug test. Lappas called it a [...] "violation of team rules." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{session was}} stopped while doctors {{attended}} to Ratzenberger. After initially being taken by ambulance to the on-circuit medical centre, he was airlifted to Maggiore Hospital shortly after, the second driver {{to be admitted}} there during the weekend. The session was restarted approximately 25minutes later, but several teams—including Williams and Benetton—took no further part. Later in hospital, {{it was announced that}} Ratzenberger had {{died as a result of}} his multiple injuries. His death marked the first Formula One race weekend fatality since the 1982 Canadian Grand Prix when Riccardo Paletti was killed. It had been eight years since Elio de Angelis died testing a Brabham car at the Circuit Paul Ricard. Professor Sid Watkins, then head of the Formula One on-track medical team, recalled in his memoirs Ayrton Senna's reaction to the news, stating that [...] "Ayrton broke down and cried on my shoulder." [...] Watkins tried to persuade Senna not to race the following day, asking [...] "What <b>else</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> need to do? You have been world champion three times, you are obviously the quickest driver. Give it up and let's go fishing." [...] Senna replied, [...] "Sid, there are certain things over which we have no control. I cannot quit, I have to go on." ...|$|E
500|$|Consequence of Sounds Alex Young {{praised the}} {{simplicity}} of the concept adding that it costs [...] "more money than your entire life fortune." [...] That was echoed by Andrew Martin of Prefix Magazine who called the video [...] "super-simplistic, albeit effective." [...] Sarah Fitzmaurice of Daily Mail also gave a positive review for the video praising its simple and energetic concept accompanied by the [...] "fierce outfits". A writer of OK! compared the video with Will Smiths work in The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air adding that Beyoncé [...] "has gone back to video basics." [...] A writer of The Huffington Post called the video a [...] "fresh take on a New Edition classic" [...] and concluded that it was a [...] "lot more simple than it sounds." [...] Lisa Potter of Marie Claire also praised the energy and Beyoncé's figure in the video, writing, [...] "The pregnant superstar puts on another energetic performance during the video, showing off her fabulous figure in a skimpy black leotard complete with a military fetish cap and Isabel Marant sneakers, before changing into a series of tailored suits." [...] Jenna Hally Rubenstein of MTV Buzzworthy wrote that the video was similar to Michael Jackson's Dangerous era adding, [...] "While some might say the basic concept of Beyoncé's [...] 'Love On Top' video is too straightforward, we actually think it's amazing – just let Beyoncé sing, dance, look fuhLAWless and wear a cute hat! What <b>else</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> people need?!" [...] Maura Johnston of The Village Voice described the video as a direct homage to New Edition's [...] "If It Isn't Love" [...] but added that when the song's key changes start, [...] "Beyoncé and her posse of backup dancers get a bit brassier and fancier". She further wrote that the video was something that Phil Collins [...] "would be proud" [...] of.|$|E

2500|$|The African press named Uruguay {{public enemy}} No.1 and {{described}} them as cheats. Suárez was unapologetic about his handball, stating [...] "I {{made the best}} save of the tournament." [...] Suárez boasted after the match of his handball save, claiming that [...] "The 'Hand of God' now belongs to me," [...] {{a reference to the}} handball goal scored by Diego Maradona in the 1986 World Cup. Ghana's coach Milovan Rajevac argued that Suárez's actions were [...] "really shocking," [...] describing the result as a [...] "football injustice." [...] Uruguay's coach Óscar Tabárez defended Suárez: [...] "Saying we cheated Ghana is too harsh a word to use...We also abide by what the referee did. It could have been a mistake. Yes, he stuck his hand out, but it's not cheating. What <b>else</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> want? Is Suárez also to blame for Ghana missing the penalty?
