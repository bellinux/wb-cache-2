2500|$|In general, {{there will}} be many {{different}} eigenvalues [...] for which a non-zero eigenvector solution exists. Since the entries in the adjacency matrix are non-negative, there is a unique largest eigenvalue, which is real and positive, by the Perron–Frobenius theorem. This greatest eigenvalue results in the desired centrality measure. The [...] component of the related eigenvector then gives the relative centrality score of the vertex [...] in the network. The eigenvector is only defined up to a common factor, so only the ratios of the centralities of the vertices are well defined. To define an absolute score one must normalise the <b>eigen</b> <b>vector</b> e.g. such that the sum over all vertices is 1 or the total number of vertices n. Power iteration is one of many eigenvalue algorithms that may be used to find this dominant eigenvector. Furthermore, this can be generalized so that the entries in A can be real numbers representing connection strengths, as in a stochastic matrix.|$|E

50|$|The main linear {{technique}} for dimensionality reduction, principal component analysis, performs a linear mapping {{of the data}} to a lower-dimensional space {{in such a way}} that the variance of the data in the low-dimensional representation is maximized. In practice, the covariance (and sometimes the correlation) matrix of the data is constructed and the <b>eigen</b> <b>vectors</b> on this matrix are computed. The <b>eigen</b> <b>vectors</b> that correspond to the largest eigenvalues (the principal components) can now be used to reconstruct a large fraction of the variance of the original data. Moreover, the first few <b>eigen</b> <b>vectors</b> can often be interpreted in terms of the large-scale physical behavior of the system. The original space (with dimension of the number of points) has been reduced (with data loss, but hopefully retaining the most important variance) to the space spanned by a few eigenvectors.|$|R
40|$|In {{data mining}} and machine {{learning}} {{the detection of}} the outliers has become a very important topic. An effective and efficient framework is needed to identify deviated data in many real world applications such as intrusion detection and credit card fraud. Many methods used for detection of the outliers are typically implemented in batch mode and that implementation on large scale data is difficult. For implementation of the batch mode on large scale data will lead to sacrifice of computation and memory requirement. In this paper, I address the computational and memory management issues and propose Online oversampling principal component analysis algorithm that aims at detecting outliers from large scale data via online updating technique. The prior principal component analysis based approaches, the data would not be stored in covariance matrix, and thus our approach would be basically interested in large scale data problems. In this algorithm the oversampling of target instances and extracting the principal direction of the data the algorithm allows us to determine the target instances according to the variation of the resulting <b>eigen</b> <b>vector.</b> The proposed framework need not have to explicitly compute the <b>eigen</b> <b>vector</b> and hence this favours the problem that is being addressed in the paper.

The TM tapes for the six LANDSAT 5 scenes covering the northern portion of the Red Sea hills were received, and preliminary maps and interpretations were made {{for most of the}} area.

The <b>eigen</b> <b>vectors</b> associated with the largest eigen values are extracted to form the eigen space. We call these <b>eigen</b> <b>vectors</b> ” 3 D Eigenfaces”. Any face model can then be approximated by a linear combina-tion of these eigenfaces, thus reducing the whole space of face shape to the smaller space of these coefficients. We show that the reconstructed faces using these 3 D eigenfaces are sufficiently close to the original faces. This result can be applied in image-based reconstruction of 3 D face models. ...|$|R
