40|$|We present fault {{localization}} techniques {{suitable for}} diagnosing <b>end-to-end</b> <b>service</b> problems in communication systems with complex topologies. We refine a layered system model that represents relationships between services and functions offered between neighboring protocol layers. In a given layer, an <b>end-to-end</b> <b>service</b> between two hosts may be provided using multiple host-to-host services offered in this layer between two hosts on the end-to-end path. Relationships among end-to-end and host-tohost services form a bipartite probabilistic dependency graph whose structure {{depends on the}} network topology in the corresponding protocol layer. When an <b>end-to-end</b> <b>service</b> fails or experiences performance problems {{it is important to}} efficiently find the responsible host-to-host services. Finding the most probable explanation (MPE) of the observed symptoms is NP-hard. We propose two fault localization techniques based on Pearl's iterative algorithms for singly connected belief networks. The probabilistic dependency graph is transformed into a belief network, and then the approximations based on Pearl's algorithms and exact bucket tree elimination algorithm are designed and evaluated through extensive simulation study...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper extends our originalwork on window-constrained scheduling, {{to address}} the problem of meeting <b>end-to-end</b> <b>service</b> {{guarantees}} across a sequence of servers. We describe an algorithm, called Multi-hop Virtual Deadline Scheduling (MVDS), that attempts to minimize end-to-end window-constraint violations, while maximizing link utilization for a series of real-time streams. The challenge posed by the multi-hop problem is how to derive a local scheduling and dropping scheme from global service requirements, so that each server along a path can cooperate to guarantee <b>end-to-end</b> <b>service.</b> Similar to our VDS algorithm developed for a single server, MVDS orders packets at the heads of streams according to their local virtualdeadlines. Using various packet dropping schemes at each server, based on current workloads and likelihoods of meeting <b>end-to-end</b> <b>service</b> constraints, we evaluate the performance of MVDS. Simulation results show that MVDS can provide better window-constrained service guarantees than other related algorithms, while still maintaining high link utilization. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{two issues}} related to resource reservation establishment in packet switched networks o ering realtime services. The rst issue arises out of the natural tension between the local nature of reservations (i. e., they control the service provided on a particular link) and the end-to-end nature of application service requirements. How do reservation establishment protocols enable applications to receive their desired <b>end-to-end</b> <b>service?</b> We review the current onepass and two-pass approaches, and then propose a new hybrid approach called one-pass-with-advertising. The second issue in reservation establishment weconsider arises from the inevitable heterogeneity in network router capabilities. Some routers and subnets in the Internet will support realtime services and others, such as ethernets, will not. How can a reservation establishment mechanism enable applications to achieve the <b>end-to-end</b> <b>service</b> they desire {{in the face of}} this heterogeneity? We propose an approach involving replacement services and advertising to build <b>end-to-end</b> <b>service</b> out of heterogeneous per-link service o erings. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In the Future Internet, free {{exchange}} of information between enterprise applications and networking systems promotes the personalization of services and enables {{many different types of}} end-user applications and management operations optimizing the network performance. As result of this free information exchange, we need to facilitate the federation of information between these applications, harmonizing the differences between operation, management data and information models in heterogeneous networks, and application management systems. This paper concentrates on identifying the research challenges that we have to address in the areas of software engineering and network management supporting federation. In particular, we describe research challenges for federated management systems highlighting the flexibility these systems can offer in the Future Internet communications, when they are able to support value-added federated <b>end-to-end</b> <b>services.</b> As part of our approach, semantic techniques are cited to represent networking information governing technology and/or network protocols offering a wide diversity of <b>end-to-end</b> <b>services</b> {{as a result of this}} transparent information sharing process...|$|R

40|$|New {{wireless}} Internet {{applications such}} as telephony and video have forced the introduction of Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) technologies (802. 16 and 802. 11 s) that provide high reliability and guaranteed access to the wireless channel. While the wireless network technology is providing deterministic <b>end-to-end</b> <b>service,</b> the analysis tools have not matched the new technological developments. In this paper we bridge the gap. We use bottom-up analysis of spatial TDMA, starting with a given TDMA schedule, to show that spatial TDMA systems are stop-and-go queuing systems, which can be analyzed in the network calculus framework. In particular, we {{take advantage of the}} fact that stop-and-go queuing systems have relatively easy to derive service curves and derive an endto-end service curve for spatial TDMA networks. We then analyze the performance of two 802. 16 mesh scheduling algorithms, by comparing the <b>end-to-end</b> <b>service</b> curves offered to their connections. With the service curve framework, the challenge becomes in the top-down analysis of wireless networks, towards scheduling algorithms that generate specific <b>end-to-end</b> <b>service</b> curves...|$|E
