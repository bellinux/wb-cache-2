5|$|Also {{included}} in the NBA's 50th-anniversary celebration was {{the selection of the}} Top 10 Teams <b>in</b> <b>NBA</b> History.

Teams were chosen from among all single-season individual teams. Each team won the NBA championship, and they combined to average 66 wins per season. The 1995–96 Chicago Bulls had the best single-season record <b>in</b> <b>NBA</b> history with 72 wins.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we report}} the intercone {{transport}} of Weyl fermions <b>in</b> <b>NbAs</b> with {{external magnetic field}} in parallel to electric field, a quantum phenomenon known as the Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomaly. Surprisingly, the resulting negative magnetoresistance (MR) <b>in</b> <b>NbAs</b> shows significant difference from NbP. The observed low-field positive MR dip, which is missing in NbP at low temperatures, indicates that the spin-orbital coupling (SOC) is significantly stronger <b>in</b> <b>NbAs</b> than <b>in</b> the former. The results imply that the contribution of arsenic to SOC <b>in</b> TaAs and <b>NbAs</b> is not negligible.
