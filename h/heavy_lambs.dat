In experiment 1, 6 - 7 months old Karayaka male lambs (7 light and 7 heavy) were used. Sugar beet pulp, perennial ryegrass and alfalfa straw were used to feed lambs in the research lasting for 28 days. In experiment 2, 7 - 8 months old Karayaka male lambs (7 light and 7 heavy) were used. The ground barley, wheat bran, expeller cottonseed meal and alfalfa straw were used to feed. The second experiment was continued for 42 days. In roughage selection, <b>heavy</b> <b>lambs</b> consumed more feed (54 %) than light lambs in total consumption (experiment 1). Besides, the Sugar beet pulp and alfalfa straw consumption of <b>heavy</b> <b>lambs</b> were higher than that of light lambs 64 and 30 %, respectively. In experiment 2, total feed consumption of <b>heavy</b> <b>lambs</b> was higher (39. 8 %) than that of light lambs.

40|$|Lamb {{producers}} {{have the option}} to market lambs at a range of slaughter weights. However, there are limited price premiums for heavier carcasses on a per kilogram basis. Any economic advantage of <b>heavy</b> <b>lambs</b> is realised by extra weight and not price. Both genetic and on-farm factors contribute to extra weight gain. Firstly, lamb weight and growth is correlated to its mature size and lambs from larger parents grow faster and reach heavier weights, but also have greater feed requirements. Secondly, stocking and reproductive rate account for the majority of variation in whole-farm profit, but increasing these also increases feed requirements. The production of <b>heavy</b> <b>lambs</b> is therefore a trade-off with maximising stocking and reproductive rate within the pool of available feed resources. We hypothesise that slaughter weight does not increase with mature size, due to the priority to increase stocking and reproductive rate for profit maximisation...|$|E

Twenty entire male lambs {{had been used}} in this experiment; the Longissimus Thoracis et Lumborum muscle, taken from all the 20 animals, was analyzed for chemical composition, fatty acid, cholesterol and mineral contents. Protein content was 22. 1 %, fat content 4. 5 %, cholesterol 63. 5 mg/ 100 g. The most represented fatty acid was oleic acid (37. 62 % of total fatty acids), followed by palmitic acid (26. 31 % of total fatty acids). Phosphorus and potassium were the two most represented minerals in muscles examined, respectively 285. 6 and 329. 5 mg/ 100 g.

30|$|Although pastoralists {{have tried}} out several {{measures}} to combat livestock losses, resistance exists, as they feel restricted from utilizing the pasture {{areas where they}} traditionally have had access. However, certain pastoralists have found ways forward {{to respond to the}} threat the carnivores entail. The reindeer herding district that tends their herd closely throughout winter has experienced fewer reindeer losses (see also Risvoll 2015). They have calm animals due to frequent stock handling with carefully selected husbandry methods; thus, tending and moving their herd when needed is also more manageable. However, this strategy comes with a price, as it is difficult to carry off with limited number of herders available, and other chores must then be placed on hold, for instance, participation in various meetings and boards. Sheep farmers who have traditional Norwegian breeds that tend to stay more in flocks have experienced declined losses to carnivores, to a certain extent. However, trade-offs exist, as income will be limited as long as the incentives favour <b>heavy</b> <b>lambs</b> (e.g. Risvoll 2015).|$|E

The dietary rpCLA supplement had no influence on carcass fatness nor on the fat content of the liver and tissues and had little influence on the FA profiles of these tissues. In the adipose tissues, rpCLA increased the proportions of saturated FAs, 18 : 0 and 18 : 2 t 10 c 12, and decreased the proportions of monounsaturated FAs in the adipose tissues.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the effect of sex and slaughter weight of Istrian sheep lambs on pH value and meat colour. The study included 118 lambs of both sexes (64 male and 54 female) which were, prior slaughter, divided into two groups: light (17. 76 kg; 28 male and 32 female) and heavy (20. 17 kg; 3 male and 22 female). Carcass weight was determined immediately after carcass processing and after 24 hours, while the pH value and meat colour were determined 45 minutes and 24 hours after slaughter. Average hot and cold carcass weights in light lambs were 9. 76 and 9. 47 kg, and in <b>heavy</b> <b>lambs</b> 11. 80 and 11. 49 kg, with chilling loss of 2. 96 and 2. 60 % respectively. Istrian sheep lambs carcasses are quite uniform in relation to sex in terms of all the investigated traits, except value of L* and a* colour parameters. For the production of larger lamb meat quantities it might be recommended to increase lambs slaughter weight since the higher slaughter weight has the positive effect on carcass weight and chilling loss while retaining the desirable values of meat quality parameters...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} prolificacy on mother-young mutual {{recognition}} is still largely unknown in sheep. The {{aim of the}} present study was to investigate the ability of prolific ewes to develop an exclusive bond with their neonate and to recognize each other from alien subjects. Observations were performed on 11 D'man and 16 Romanov ewes with, respectively, 19 and 37 of their lambs. Maternal selectivity was tested at 24 h postpartum during two consecutive periods of 3 min. All mothers accepted their own lambs at suckling, while 21 out of 27 (78 %) rejected the alien, thus displaying mostly selective nursing. To assess mother-young recognition, a two-choice test was performed at 36 h postpartum. Ewes clearly preferred their own lambs to an alien lamb and behavioral differences were not found between mothers of small (singletons and twins) and large litters (triplets and quadruplets). Romanov ewes reached their own lambsmore rapidly and spent more time near them than D'man ewes. Lambs from small litters, in particular light lambs, clearly preferred their mothers to an alien dam; however, both light and <b>heavy</b> <b>lambs</b> in large litters did not discriminate between the two stimulus ewes.

40|$|In {{the first}} 3 days of life, triplet lambs, {{especially}} the smaller triplets, are less capable of surviving than twins and singles. However, whether differences in behaviour and survival of lambs within triplet litters persist after this period is unknown. This trial examined {{the differences in}} sucking behaviour and milk intake between the light, medium and <b>heavy</b> <b>lambs</b> within a triplet litter at 8 - 17 days of age, with the lamb rank based on birth weight. Of 28 triplet carrying ewes, only 10 complete litters survived to at least 8 days of age and {{could be used for}} this trial. After 4 hours of separation, the lambs were returned to the ewe and the behaviour of the lambs and ewe was observed for a period of 15 minutes. The abdominal girth and body weight of the lambs were measured before and after the sucking period. At 8 - 17 days of age, triplet lambs still differed in terms of weight (P= 0. 001) and abdominal girth (P= 0. 002); the triplet lambs born lightest were still lightest and had the smallest abdominal girth. However, there were no statistical relationships between lamb rank and sucking behaviour. Light, medium and <b>heavy</b> <b>lambs</b> did not differ in the number of sucking bouts, number of attempted bouts, total sucking duration, mean sucking bout duration, relative sucking duration, teat fidelity or number of butts. Nor did lamb rank affect the behaviour of the ewes (kicks or butts, walking away from lambs) or measures of milk intake such as relative weight gain or girth gain. However, there was a tendency for lamb rank to have an effect on one measure of milk intake (weight gain) (P= 0. 09). The lambs that were lightest at birth tended to gain less weight during the observation period than heavier lambs, particularly those of medium birth weight. There was also a tendency for lamb rank to have an effect on relative girth gain (P= 0. 08). The lambs born lightest tended to gain more girth relative to their original girth than the heaviest lambs. The only measure of sucking behaviour that tended to differ with lamb rank was the frequency of teat switching (P= 0. 09); medium lambs tended to switch teats more often than the heaviest lambs. Overall, weight gain {{is likely to be the}} most accurate indicator of milk intake; based on this variable, lambs born lightest appear to have ingested less milk than their heavier siblings, despite the lack of differences in sucking behaviour. These lambs were still lighter and smaller at 8 - 17 days of age, suggesting that they had lower growth rates and potentially lower chances of survival. Further research should aim to determine whether ewes and lambs can adapt their sucking behaviour to cope with triplet litters, instead of twins or singles, or whether ewes should be selected for higher milk production. In addition, the effect of different management strategies (e. g. fostering or weaning of the lightest lamb or providing milk supplement) on triplet lambs‚Äô milk intake, growth and survival should be tested...|$|E

The flavor concentrates were prepared by steam distillation, ether extraction and fractionation. Pooled samples were prepared {{in the same way}} to measure any variations due to methodology. Gas chromatographic separation and statistical analysis, based on analysis of variance, indicated that 21 peaks out of 124 peaks showed significant differences (at 5 % level or 1 % level). Among these 21 peaks, 5 were affected by breed, 4 by sex-type, 8 by carcass weight and 7 peaks were influenced by the interaction of breed, sex-type and carcass weight. Variations due to breed revealed that Rambouillet lambs possessed the highest proportion of flavor peaks which showed significant differences, with Targhee lambs the second highest, Columbia the third and Suffolk- cross the lowest proportion of flavor compounds. The effect of sex-type suggested that was contributed to the highest concentration of peaks which might influence the expression of flavor. However, there was no evidence showing that the concentration of peaks for ewes was greater than that of wethers or vice versa. Differences associated with weight indicated that light animals yielded a higher concentration of flavor volatiles, medium weight lambs the second and <b>heavy</b> <b>lambs</b> the lowest concentration of volatiles.

40|$|The {{increasing}} use {{of genetically}} modified (GM) feeds has aroused many concerns in Europe. The possibility to replace soybean in livestock feedstuffs has led to revalue the use of legume grains such as pea (Pisum sativum), lupin (Lupinus albus) and field bean (Vicia faba var. minor). The use of the these legume grains may lower the European dependence of protein rich feeds. The cultivation of legume grains is economically feasible and is widely practiced in South Italy due to the favorable land and climatic conditions and accordingly to the EU provisions on crop rotation. This study was planned in order to evaluate {{the influence of a}} diet containing a variety of pea (Pisum sativum L., var. Corallo) commonly cultivated in South Italy as alternative to a traditional soybean meal based feed on the productive performances and meat quality traits in <b>heavy</b> <b>lambs</b> of two local Merino crossbreeds. The experiment was conducted using two different Merino ethnic groups of 20 male lambs each: ‚ÄúMerinizzata Cavone‚Äù (MC) and ‚ÄúMerinizzata Leccese‚Äù (ML). All the lambs were raised traditionally with their dams suckling milk until the age of 50 days and then they were weaned using a commercial weaning feed for a week. The lambs of each genetic pool were divided into two homogeneous groups (No. = 10) and fed with one of the two pelletted rations containing: a) soybean meal (SBM) or b) pea feed (PF). Lambs were slaughtered altogether at the age of 100 days. The results show that pea may be successfully used in lamb diets providing satisfactory results in terms of growth performance and meat quality.

40|$|Sheep {{production}} {{is the only}} animal production in Sweden that is increasing. Therefore, increasing knowledge of the {{production is}} of great interest. In order to run a viable sheep production, producers needs {{to be successful in}} the breeding of the animals and achieve an economic surplus in the end. Lambs that are born healthy and vital have greater conditions to perform high lamb weight gains and thus a successful production. There are many factors affect the survival, birth weight and early weight gain of the new born lamb. The most important factors regarding the maternal influence and the environmental factors that affect the lambs survival and early life weight gain was explored in this paper. Weight at birth is positively correlated to survival, weight gain, adult weight and maternal traits. Litter size affects the birth weight and is explained by that the uterus is a limited space. Birth weight of lambs is lower in first parity ewes. Birth weight of lambs increases with the ewe‚Äôs age up to the fourth parity when it declines again. The foetus grows rapidly during the last weeks of gestation and the newborn lamb weight can be affected by feeding. Feeding regime in early gestation does not affect the growth of the foetus. The milk production of the ewe is of great significance for the lambs‚Äô early weight gain. Lambs that have restricted access to milk in early life have a low correlation between birth weight and early life weight gain. A minor investigation was made to study the influence of birth weight on early weight gain in post natal lambs. The study included 53 lambs of different breeds. The weights of the lambs were registered at as close to birth as possible and as close to 120 hours after the first occasion as possible. An hourly weight gain was calculated in order to calculate a corrected weight at 120 hours. Litter size, sex of the lamb, age and the maternal behavior of the ewe and occurrence of complications during parturition were also registered. The study showed that birth weight affects the early weight gain. Lambs with higher birth weights had higher early weight gains than lambs that were smaller at birth. The results confirmed earlier studies. A likely explanation is that small lambs have a lower early weight gain due to their smaller potential to feed as much as <b>heavier</b> <b>lambs.</b> However, lambs which were smaller at birth had relatively, to the birth weight, a higher growth rate than the <b>heavier</b> <b>lambs.</b> The study also showed that male <b>lambs</b> were <b>heavier</b> and had a higher weight gain than female lambs. Triplets had lower birth weights and grew less than twins and single born lambs. There was only a marginal difference between twins and single born lambs. Adult ewes had the <b>heaviest</b> <b>lambs</b> and the highest weight gains of their lambs. Crossbreeds lambs had higher weights at birth than the purebreds. The study suffered from the relatively low number of lambs which makes extensive conclusions difficult to make except for the correlation between birth weight and early weight gain. It is suggested that birth weight and early weight gain can be used for selecting ewes in the herd as this parameter may well reflect the ewes‚Äô success potential, including, foetus growth, maternal instincts and behaviour and milk production. But this has to be further investigated...|$|R

Glucose, protein, cholesterol and triglycerides plasma levels were low at 1 ‚Äì 12 h of birth and increased over the first 3 days. Rectal temperature increased as well and a significant effect of year and season of birth was observed, where summer-born lambs had higher rectal temperature both at 24 ‚Äì 36 h and 48 ‚Äì 60 h of age compared to winter-born lambs. Also, lambs born from older ewes (3 ‚Äì 5 years) had higher rectal temperature at 1 ‚Äì 12 h than lambs born from younger ewes (< 2 years). Winter-born lambs had higher glucose plasma level at 48 ‚Äì 60 h of birth than summer-born lambs which had the highest protein plasma level at all time points measured. Birth weight influenced neonatal physiology with <b>heavy</b> <b>lambs</b> having higher rectal temperature, glucose, cholesterol and cortisol plasma levels at 1 ‚Äì 12 h of birth than medium and light lambs. Accordingly, quadruplets had the lowest rectal temperature at all time points measured compared to singles, twins and triplets. Twins had higher glucose and protein plasma levels at 1 ‚Äì 12 h and 24 ‚Äì 36 h of birth than triplets, quadruplets and quintuplets. Birth weight was negatively related to cortisol plasma levels at 24 ‚Äì 36 h and 48 ‚Äì 60 h of birth. Average daily weight gain over 10 days was positively related to glucose plasma level and rectal temperature, and inversely related to cortisol plasma level at all points measured. Average daily gain weight between 10 and 30 days was also positively related to glucose plasma level and inversely related to cortisol plasma level. Finally, it was found that rectal temperature, glucose and protein plasma levels were higher in lambs that survived beyond one month of age in comparison to those that died. The main outcome {{of this study is that}} smaller triplets and quadruplets have lower rectal temperature and metabolites plasma level than twin- and single-born lambs during the first 3 days of life and this impairs their chance of survival. These physiological traits are reliable indicators for health status in prolific D‚Äôman sheep and can be exploited in order to improve lamb production...|$|E
40|$|Merinos are bred {{primarily}} for wool production, valued {{specifically for the}} fine-wool they produce. Wool returns have been diminishing over recent years so using management to improve wool quantity and quality is beneficial to growers. Shearing ewes {{at different stages of}} pregnancy has been shown to potentially influence the follicle population which in turn could achieve a finer, heavier fleece in the offspring, although this has not been examined in Merinos. A consequence of the diminishing wool returns is a greater emphasis on meat production, resulting in a shift in focus to increase live weight and body condition in order to increase reproductive performance and produce <b>heavy</b> <b>lambs</b> for sale. The whole Merino wool market is also currently threatened by the perception of overseas purchasers towards the practice of mulesing. Mulesing is undertaken in approximately half of New Zealand's Merino lambs as a means of reducing blowfly strike. There are few data available under New Zealand conditions for these pre-mentioned management factors that influence Merino production. Therefore, the aim of this thesis was to profile the live weight and body condition of single- and twin-bearing Merino ewes; investigate the effect of shearing time of Merino ewes on the live weight, fleece characteristics and the follicle population in their progeny; and to investigate the effect of mulesing Merino lambs on their live weight, dag score and fleece characteristics. Two hundred and ninety nine Merino owes were bred to 4 mature Merino rams on day 0 of the experiment (d 0; May 20, 2006). Pregnant ewes were then allocated to one of three shearing times; mid-pregnancy (d 106), late-pregnancy (d 141) and post-lambing (d 191). Ewes were weighed and condition scored on dO, d 79, d 106, d 141, d 191 and d 283 of the experiment. The ewes produced 128 ewe-lambs which were used for subsequent measurements. Ewe-lambs were identified using DNA parentage testing to their dam's maternal shearing treatment. Ewe-lambs were weighed on d 191 (approximately 6 weeks of age) and weighed and dag scored on d 191 (approximately 6 weeks of age). d 283 (approximately 4 months of age), d 359 (approximately 7 months of age) and d 499 (approximately 1 year of age). Ewe-lambs were wrinkle scored on d 191. On d 191, 60 ewe-lambs were mulesed; the remaining 67 were left un-mulesed. A skin biopsy was taken from the mid-side of the lamb at d 359 and analysed for primary and secondary follicle density. Two mid-side wool samples were taken from the lambs; one at d 359 (approximately 7 months of age) and one at d 499 (approximately 1 year of age). The first of these samples was analysed for washing yield, colour and fibre diameter. The second mid-side was analysed for fleece class, staple length and staple strength respectively. At d 499 fleece weight was measured before the mid-side sample was taken. Twin-bearing ewes were heavier (P< 0. 05) than single-bearing ewes from d 0 (start of breeding) through to d 79 (pregnancy diagnosis). They were also heavier (P< 0. 05) following this period. However, this is most likely due to the weight of their foetuses. Body condition score of twin-bearing ewes decreased following lambing until d 191 (tailing) but recovered by d 283 (weaning). Single-bearing ewes were more likely (P< 0. 05) to be rearing a lamb at d 191. Single-born lambs were heavier (P< 0. 05) at d 191 and d 283, had heavier fleeces and had a higher primary follicle number index than their twin-born counterparts. Shearing time of Merino ewes had no effect on lamb live weight at any stage of the experiment. It also had no effect on ewe live weight apart from in late-pregnancy where the mid-pregnancy shorn ewes were heavier (P< 0. 05) than late-pregnancy shorn and post-lambing shorn ewes. Shearing ewes in mid-pregnancy had no effect on the fleece characteristics of their lambs. The progeny of lambs born to ewes shorn post-lambing had a significantly greater follicle density, secondary follicle density, follicle number index and secondary follicle number index than their mid- and late-pregnancy shorn counterparts. Mulesing Merino lambs had no effect on their growth, live weight or fleece characteristics. It resulted in a reduction in dags at d 359 and d 588 which is likely to reduce susceptibility to blowfly strike. The purpose of mulesing is to reduce wrinkles around the breech, and in this study, the more wrinkles a lamb had at d 191 the greater the secondary to primary follicle ratio, total follicle density, secondary follicle density, secondary follicle number index, primary follicle number index, total follicle number index, and fleece weight. This suggests a productive advantage to sheep with more wrinkles; however, they also had more dags and therefore were at greater risk of blowfly strike than the less wrinkly lambs. In conclusion, shearing ewes post lambing increased the secondary follicle density of the ewe progeny but had no affect on fleece characteristics. In contrast to experiments with other breeds, shearing Merino ewes in mid-pregnancy compared with post-lambing had no effect on fleece or follicle characteristics. There is an opportunity for future work investigating the mechanisms behind the response of lambs to shearing their ewe post-lambing. The results suggest that maintaining high ewe live weight and body condition score throughout pregnancy will result in more lambs reared to at least tailing, and heavier lambs at weaning. Further work is required to examine the potential benefits of differential management of single and twin-bearing/rearing ewes. Mulesing lambs reduces dag score, and hence is likely to reduce flystrike rates but had no effect on live weight, or fleece characteristics. Alternatives to the practice of mulesing that give equal protection, compared to mulesing, against blowfly strike need to be found...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{tilmicosin}} on {{the incidence of}} clinical mastitis and subsequent lamb performance was studied in 9 sheep flocks in Ontario. Ewes were treated randomly with either tilmicosin or placebo approximately one month prior to lambing. Outcome was assessed by comparing rates of clinical mastitis, palpable udder abnormalities, and preweaning (50 -day) lamb weights between the 2 treatment groups, while controlling for other important variables. Lambs raised by multiparous ewes treated with tilmicosin were significantly <b>heavier</b> than <b>lambs</b> from placebo-treated multiparous ewes at 50 days. Lambs from tilmicosin-treated ewes were on average 0. 52 kg <b>heavier</b> than <b>lambs</b> in the placebo group. There {{was no difference between}} treatment groups in the weight of lambs from first parity ewes. Tilmicosin treatment resulted in a 43 % decrease in palpable udder abnormalities. Incidence of clinical mastitis did not differ between experimental groups. The administration of tilmicosin prelambing, at the time of routine clostridial disease vaccination, may be a beneficial and convenient way to reduce mastitis infection and improve the preweaning gain of lambs...|$|R
