30|$|The first {{enactment}} (in {{the first}} research cycle) had {{been conducted in}} the school year of 2014 (Jong, 2015; Jong & Sha﻿ng, 2015). Adopting the VISOLE framework and the game, Teachers A, B and C implemented serious gaming to teach the Agriculture module in their schools. The total number of Grade 11 student participants in that enactment had been 99 (34 <b>from</b> <b>School</b> A, 32 <b>from</b> <b>School</b> B, and 33 <b>from</b> <b>School</b> C). The second enactment (in the second research cycle) was conducted in the school year of 2015. Adopting the optimised VISOLE framework and the revised game (see the sub-section of Redesign), Teachers A, B and C again implemented serious gaming to teach the Agriculture module in their schools.

5|$|As state superintendent, Paulus helped {{introduce}} statewide assessment {{testing for}} grades 3, 5, 8, and 11 in 1991. Other education reforms introduced that year were the Certificate of Initial Mastery (CIM) and Certificate of Advanced Mastery (CAM) {{that were designed}} to replace the high school diploma in Oregon. These were optional programs which {{were part of a}} broader program that included issuing a report card outlining the progress as a state, as required by a law the state legislature passed in 1991. Paulus also supported school to work initiatives for reforming public education while in office, which were part of the 1991 reforms. At the time Paulus was one of only ten women in the nation to hold the top education position in their state. She left the office on January 4, 1999, after two terms. In 2007, the Oregon Legislature eliminated the optional certificates <b>from</b> <b>schools</b> in the state.|$|E

5|$|The Soviet propaganda-motivated {{support for}} Polish-language {{cultural}} activities, however, {{clashed with the}} official policy of Russification. The Soviets at first intended to phase out the Polish language and so banned Polish <b>from</b> <b>schools,</b> street signs, {{and other aspects of}} life. This policy was, however, reversed at times—first before the elections in October 1939; and later, after the German conquest of France. In November 1940, the Poles of Lwów observed the 85th anniversary of Adam Mickiewicz's death. Soon, however, Stalin decided to re-implement the Russification policies. He reversed his decision again, however, when a need arose for Polish-language pro-Soviet propaganda following the German invasion of the Soviet Union; as a result Stalin permitted the creation of Polish forces in the East and later decided to create a Communist People's Republic of Poland.|$|E
40|$|Purpose—Walking to and <b>from</b> <b>school</b> {{contributes}} to total physical activity levels. This study investigated whether perceived and actual neighborhood features {{were associated with}} walking to or <b>from</b> <b>school</b> among adolescent girls. Methods—A sample of geographically diverse 8 th grade girls (N= 890) from the Trial for Activity in Adolescent Girls (TAAG) study living within 1. 5 miles of their middle school were recruited. Participants completed a self-administered survey on their neighborhood and walking behavior. Geographic information system (GIS) data {{were used to assess}} objective neighborhood features. Nested multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine the contribution of perceived and objective measures of walking to or <b>from</b> <b>school.</b> Results—Fifty-six percent (N= 500) of the girls walked to or <b>from</b> <b>school</b> at least one day of the week. White (42 %) girls walked more frequently than Hispanic (25 %) and African American (21 %) girls. Girls were nearly twice as likely to walk to or <b>from</b> <b>school</b> if they perceived their neighborhoods as safe and perceived they had places they liked to walk, controlling for other potential confounders. Additionally, girls who lived closer to school, had more active destinations in their neighborhood, and smaller sized blocks were more likely to walk to or <b>from</b> <b>school</b> than those who did not. Conclusion—Safety, land use, and school location issues need to be considered together when designing interventions to increase walking to and <b>from</b> <b>school...</b>|$|R

This paper presents results from a study that was conducted to explore the socioeconomic and school factors causing pupils to be absent <b>from</b> <b>school</b> in lower primary schools in Masaba Sub-county, Nyamira County in Kenya. The results from data analysis had shown that pupils’ absenteeism was an issue in lower primary schools in the sub-county and pupils’ were often absent <b>from</b> <b>school</b> on Monday and Fridays. Several socio-economic and school factors made pupils to be absent <b>from</b> <b>school.</b> The socioeconomic factors included: children staying at home to help parents in family business and lack of money for basic needs. The school factors included: Un-conducive school environment; and poor relationship with peers and teachers. The strategies {{that could be used to}} reduce pupils’ absenteeism <b>from</b> <b>school</b> include: Strict implementation of school rules, banning of unauthorized levies, and effective teaching...|$|R

Children were kept <b>from</b> <b>schools</b> and, in some cases, hidden from government officials tasked with rounding up children on reserves. Parents regularly advocated for increased funding for schools, including {{the increase of}} centrally located day schools to improve access to their children, and made repeated requests for improvements {{to the quality of}} education, food, and clothing being provided at the schools. Demands for answers in regards to claims of abuse were often dismissed as a ploy by parents seeking to keep their children at home, with government and school officials positioned as those who knew best.|$|E
5|$|As a senior, he mostly played running back. In the 2009 TAPPS Division I {{football}} semifinals, Mark had 102 {{yards on}} 16 carries, including two rushing touchdowns and a 33-yard receiving touchdown. However, he was stopped on fourth and goal {{to go from}} the 2-yard-line with 11 seconds left as the team lost Nolan Catholic High School 3628. Mark's senior season statistics were 23 receptions for 242 yards, 92 rushes for 772 yards and 20 total touchdowns (four on punt and kickoff returns). He also had seven touchdowns called back due to penalties. He was honored as a first team All-state selection. As a senior, he had 18 offers <b>from</b> <b>schools</b> including his five finalists: Northwestern, Arizona, Iowa State, Vanderbilt and Colorado as well as Houston, Baylor, UTEP, Virginia and Penn State.

40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to assess the {{relationships}} between commuting to and <b>from</b> <b>school</b> (active vs. passive) and their explanatory variables. A total of 2653 adolescents (1361 boys, 1292 girls; M age= 13. 4 ± 2. 6) participated in this study. The students were questioned about commuting to and <b>from</b> <b>school,</b> physical activity and school sports participation and perceptions of competence and health. Socioeconomic status and body mass index were calculated. Results show that a minority of the students use active transportation to and <b>from</b> <b>school.</b> Also, age increasing, participation in school sports and increasing duration were positively correlated with active commuting for both routes (to and <b>from</b> <b>school).</b> Given that active commuting may be a simple and effective way to increase physical activity level among youth populations, it is important to promote, improve conditions and create strategies in order {{to increase the number of}} students that actively commute to and <b>from</b> <b>school...</b>|$|R

5|$|Davidson's family {{assumed that}} he would follow his father in {{becoming}} a priest and he was brought up strictly. When he was six he began attending Banister Court School in Southampton, an establishment founded initially for the sons of Merchant Navy officers. In 1890 Harold was sent to live with two maiden aunts in Croydon while he attended the Whitgift School. Here he became an enthusiastic amateur actor, encouraged by his friendship with a fellow-pupil, Leon Quartermaine, who later won recognition {{on the stage and}} in films. In February 1894 the pair appeared together in a school production of the farce Sent to the Tower. Under his aunts' influence, Davidson became a part-time worker at Toynbee Hall, an East End charity founded by Samuel and Henrietta Barnett which attracted many volunteers <b>from</b> <b>schools</b> and universities. Because of these distractions he neglected his school work and failed to win a scholarship that would enable him to attend Oxford University and study for holy orders. In the face of his father's disapproval, he decided to pursue a career as a stage comedian.|$|E
5|$|In November 1938, a young Jewish man {{requested}} {{an interview}} with the German ambassador in Paris and met with a legation secretary, whom he shot and killed to protest his family's treatment in Germany. This incident provided the pretext for a pogrom the NSDAP incited against the Jews on 9 November 1938. Members of the SA damaged or destroyed synagogues and Jewish property throughout Germany. At least 91 German Jews were killed during this pogrom, later called Kristallnacht, the Night of Broken Glass. Further restrictions were imposed on Jews in the coming months– they were forbidden to own businesses or work in retail shops, drive cars, go to the cinema, visit the library or own weapons and Jewish pupils were removed <b>from</b> <b>schools.</b> The Jewish community was fined one billion marks to pay for the damage caused by Kristallnacht and told that any money received via insurance claims would be confiscated. By 1939, around 250,000 of Germany's 437,000 Jews emigrated to the United States, Argentina, Great Britain, Palestine and other countries. Many chose to stay in continental Europe. Emigrants to Palestine were allowed to transfer property there {{under the terms of the}} Haavara Agreement, but those moving to other countries had to leave virtually all their property behind and it was seized by the government.|$|E
5|$|Traditional {{values have}} endured the attempt by western {{institutions}} {{to impose a}} positive image of deviant behavior. For instance, {{in spite of the}} removal of homosexuality from the nomenclature of mental disorders, 62.5% of 450 surveyed psychiatrists in the Rostov Region view it as an illness, and up to three quarters view it as immoral behavior. The psychiatrists sustain the ban on gay parades and the use of veiled schemes to lay off openly lesbian and gay persons <b>from</b> <b>schools,</b> child care centers, and other public institutions. The chief psychiatrist of Russia Zurab Kekelidze in his 2013 interview to Dozhd says that a part of the cases of homosexuality is a mental disorder, he counters the remark that the World Health Organization removed homosexuality from the list of mental disorders by stating that it is not true. Homosexuality, which is a mental disorder, was continuously defined as such by the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia in 2005 when its president Savenko expressed their joint surprise at the proposal by the Executive Committee of the American Psychiatric Association to exclude homosexuality as a mental disorder from manuals on psychiatry due to political pressure from western NGOs and governments, referred the proposal to antipsychiatric actions, and stated that ideological, social and liberal reasoning for the proposal was substituted for scientific one. In 2014, Savenko changed his mind about homosexuality, and he along with Alexei Perekhov succumb to pressure and, in their joint paper criticized and referred the trend to consider homosexuality as a mental disorder to Soviet mentality.|$|E
