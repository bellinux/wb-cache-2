40|$|Abstract This {{study was}} {{performed}} {{to determine the effects}} of the pretreatment and cold-vacuum drying methods on the physicochemical properties and antioxidant activities of dried peaches. Moisture content was significantly lower with 0. 3 % NaCl treatment with cold-vacuum drying. The pH, brix and acid ratio (SS/TA) were the lowest with 1. 0 % soluble Ca treatment, while soluble solid and SS/TA were significantly <b>higher</b> <b>with</b> 0. 1 % vitamin C treatment compared to those with other treatments. The ∆E and browning degree was lower in the pretreated sample compared to the untreated sample. Cutting strength of dried peaches was highest in the pretreated samples, and it was the <b>highest</b> <b>with</b> 1. 0 % soluble Ca treatment. Total sugar content with 0. 1 % vitamin C and 1. 0 % soluble Ca treatment was significantly <b>higher</b> than that <b>with</b> 0. 3 % NaCl treatment. The free sugar content was lower with 0. 3 % NaCl treatment but it was <b>higher</b> <b>with</b> 0. 1 % vitamin C and 1. 0 % soluble Ca treatment. The sensory evaluation result was <b>highest</b> <b>with</b> 0. 1 % vitamin C treatment.
