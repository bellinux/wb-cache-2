50|$|To further {{conserve}} <b>encoding</b> <b>space,</b> most registers {{are expressed}} in opcodes using three or four bits, the latter via an opcode prefix in 64-bit mode, while at most one operand to an instruction can be a memory location. However, this memory operand {{may also be the}} destination (or a combined source and destination), while the other operand, the source, can be either register or immediate. Among other factors, this contributes to a code size that rivals eight-bit machines and enables efficient use of instruction cache memory. The relatively small number of general registers (also inherited from its 8-bit ancestors) has made register-relative addressing (using small immediate offsets) an important method of accessing operands, especially on the stack. Much work has therefore been invested in making such accesses as fast as register accesses, i.e. a one cycle instruction throughput, in most circumstances where the accessed data is available in the top-level cache.|$|E

40|$|The {{hunter-gatherer}} {{hypothesis of}} SILVERMAN and EALS (1992) is the best-supported evolutionary explanation for {{sex differences in}} human spatial cognitive skills. It proposes that the sex differences in performance {{on a range of}} spatial task are a consequence of males (who hunted much more than did females) being better adapted to <b>encode</b> <b>space</b> allocentrically, and to rely on Euclidian navigational strategies employing distant landmarks, whereas females (who gathered much more than did males) are better adapted to <b>encode</b> <b>space</b> more egocentrically, navigating based more on local landmarks, and to be better able to precisely encode the position of particular objects. We tested this hypothesis by comparing the performance of male and female participants in a virtual navigation task (in which we could manipulate the landmark information available), a virtual dead-reckoning task and an object location memory task. The patterns of sex differences in the spatial tasks were strongly supportive of the hunter-gatherer hypothesis, but the sex-specific correlations between tasks thought to be underpinned by the same spatial-cognitive ability were not always supportive of the hypothesis, suggesting that the hunter-gatherer hypothesis requires some revisions or extensions. 26 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} imaging (MRI) typically achieves spatial encoding {{by measuring the}} projection of a q-dimensional object over q-dimensional spatial bases created by linear spa-tial encoding magnetic fields (SEMs). Recently, imaging strat-egies using nonlinear SEMs have demonstrated potential advantages for reconstructing images with higher spatiotem-poral resolution and reducing peripheral nerve stimulation. In practice, nonlinear SEMs and linear SEMs can be used jointly to further improve the image reconstruction performance. Here, we propose the multidimensionally encoded (MDE) MRI to map a q-dimensional object onto a p-dimensional <b>encoding</b> <b>space</b> where p> q. MDE MRI is a theoretical framework link-ing imaging strategies using linear and nonlinear SEMs. Using a system of eight surface SEM coils with an eight-channel ra-diofrequency coil array, we demonstrate the five-dimensional MDE MRI for a two-dimensional object as a further generaliza-tion of PatLoc imaging and O-space imaging. We also present a method of optimizing spatial bases in MDE MRI.

40|$|Most modern {{processors}} (either embedded {{or general}} purpose) contain {{higher number of}} physical registers than those exposed in the ISA. Due {{to a variety of}} reasons, this phenomenon is likely to continue especially on embedded systems where <b>encoding</b> <b>space</b> is very limited. Saving the <b>encoding</b> <b>space</b> leads to lower power consumption in the I-cache; on the other hand, harnessing more physical registers saves power in the memory subsystem and reduces latency as well. These design decisions however result in the difficulty of register allocation for a compiler due to limited number of exposed registers at ISA level. In this paper, we therefore propose a hardware managed register allocation scheme to allocate more physical registers at runtime and to utilize them. As a byproduct, we also show that hardware managed register allocation has other merits such as better exploitation of low register pressure regions, more flexible management of caller-save/callee-save registers, etc. Our approach consists of both compiler and hardware enhancements. On the compiler side we assign variables at various stack offsets such that the offsets indicate the relative allocation priorities at runtime. The hardware is modified to identify such spills and make decisions whether they should be put in the (invisible) physical registers based on their relative priorities. Finally, our results show slight improvement in the instructions per cycle counts (IPC) but significant power consumption reduction in the cache...|$|E

The shape map identifies its own, preferred input when it is translated, deformed, scaled and fragmented, and discrimi-nates other shapes very distinctively. <b>Encoding</b> visual <b>space</b> is much more efficient for shape recognition than determining contour geometry only. ...|$|R
