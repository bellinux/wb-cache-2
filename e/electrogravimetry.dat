50|$|An {{advantage}} {{to this kind}} of analysis over <b>electrogravimetry</b> {{is that it does not}} require that the product of the reaction be weighed. This is useful for reactions where the product does not deposit as a solid, such as the determination of the amount of arsenic in a sample from the electrolysis of arsenous acid (H3AsO3) to arsenic acid (H3AsO4).|$|E
50|$|<b>Electrogravimetry</b> is {{a method}} used to {{separate}} and quantify ions of a substance, usually a metal. In this process, the analyte solution is electrolyzed. Electrochemical reduction causes the analyte to be deposited on the cathode. The cathode is weighed {{before and after the}} experiment, and weighing by difference is used to calculate the amount of analyte in the original solution. Controlling the potential of the electrode is important to ensure that only the metal being analyzed will be deposited on the electrode.|$|E

This system is committed to acquire appropriated data for determining the Electrogravimetric Transfer Function (EGTF) and provide information regarding the mass transfer in an electrochemical cell in the AC <b>Electrogravimetry</b> Technique, but maintaining a good trade-off between the locking frequency bandwidth and the resolution in the frequency tracking, that is, enlarging the bandwidth of the system to follow signals with frequency as higher as 1 kHz, but maintaining an accurate and continuous tracking of this signal. The enlarged bandwidth allows the study of fast kinetic process in electrochemical applications and the continuous tracking let to achieve a precise measurement with good resolution rather than average frequency records obtained by conventional frequency meters.

40|$|International audienceTo {{accompany}} {{the search for}} optimal materials in electrochemical supercapacitors, appropriate characterization tools to assess key parameters of newly developed electrodes are required. Here we demonstrate the capabilities of ac-mode <b>electrogravimetry</b> to study in details the capacitive charge storage mechanisms in electrochemically reduced graphene oxide (ERGO) thin film electrodes. The coupling of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) with fast quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) complements classical electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) by capturing here {{the dynamics of the}} electroadsorption process, identifying charged moieties and detecting solvation effects. We evidenced the coelectroadsorption of two types of cationic species (fully and partially hydrated cations) in the potential range studied and the indirect intervention of free solvent molecules. Further kinetic information on electroadsorption is also obtained which leads to a full deconvolution of the global EQCM response at both gravimetric and temporal level. Through a fine analysis of the interactions of different cations of period one elements, Li+, Na+, and K+, with ERGO, we evidenced the critical role of solvation processes on the kinetics of electroadsorption, and provided an experimental proof to the phenomena that smaller ions are more tightly bound to their water molecules such that an inverse relationship exists between the dehydration energy and the ion size. Such gravimetric and dynamic subtleties are unreachable with classical tools and with EQCM method alone which permits us to suggest the ac-mode <b>electrogravimetry</b> as a baseline diagnostic tool to explore charge transfer mechanisms at the nanoscale...|$|E

The kinetic aspects of the three different redox transitions proposed for this polymer (leucoemeraldine-polaron transition, polaron-bipolaron transition, and bipolaron-pernigraniline transition) and the species involved, cation (hydrated proton), anion (bisulfate ion), and free solvent (water), are studied {{by means of the}} mass impedance technique. An ionic transfer model is proposed with coherent results where anion transfer is the fastest process and hydrated proton transfer is the slowest process (Grotthuss mechanism).

40|$|International audienceElectrodeposited poly(o-toluidine) (POT) on gold {{electrodes}} {{was investigated}} in a 0. 5 M H 2 SO 4 aqueous solution using cyclic <b>electrogravimetry</b> with in situ vis-NIR spectroscopy. This coupling of different techniques allows the electrical, color, and mass changes during the electrochemical reactions of these polymers to be correlated. Therefore, this is a powerful tool to obtain valuable information on the physical models of polymer films and their electrochemical properties. The accurate analysis of the results from these techniques showed the contribution of three different redox transitions (leucoemeraldine-polaron transition, polaron-bipolaron transition, and bipolaron-pernigraniline transition) and the participation of cation (hydrated proton), anion (bisulfate ion), and free solvent (water) transfers in these redox transitions. Moreover, the contributions of each redox transition to the current, absorbance derivative, and mass derivative were separated...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an in-depth characterisation {{study of the}} patina formed on a copper tile taken {{from the roof of}} Queen Anne's Summer Palace in Prague after > 300 years of exposure to the action of the atmosphere. A wide variety of techniques have been used, including metallographic and chemical analysis (<b>electrogravimetry,</b> AAS, XRF) of the copper matrix, and spectroscopic and microscopic investigations (GIXRD, FTIR, TEM/EDS and SEM/EDS) to determine the composition and structure of the patina. The major conclusions of the study are: (a) the base copper contains abundant inclusions mainly of rosiaite (PbSbO); (b) the patina is formed by an inner sublayer of cuprite (CuO) and an outer sublayer of brochantite [CuSO(OH) ] and antlerite [CuSO(OH) ] and traces of azurite [Cu(CO) (OH) ]; and (c) the brochantite/antlerite crystals are randomly doped with Fe and C.

40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} the development of low-cost teaching experiments of <b>electrogravimetry</b> for undergraduate students using principles of green chemistry. Copper was electrochemically deposited on brass under an electrical current density of 50 mA cmâˆ’ 2 from acidic solutions containing nitrate anions. Color changes at the brass electrode and of the solution were observed, indicating that the reduction of copper ions had occurred. The deposition efficiency values were between 92. 8 % and 93. 8 %, and the electrochemical efficiency values were between 85. 6 % and 86. 5 %. There was no significant contribution from parallel reactions. These experimental conditions facilitated the didactic exploration of gravimetric and electrochemical concepts. Following the principles of green chemistry, the experiments produced no toxic substances, all the materials could be recycled, and the energy consumption was the lowest. For this reason, this experiment {{was considered to be}} very interesting for didactical purposes...|$|E
40|$|International audienceRedox {{mechanisms}} of conducting polymers {{are not yet}} fully understood. Attractive analytical tools and pertinent models are necessary to achieve this goal. In this paper, numerical simulations based on a theory dealing with ions transfer through electroactive film/electrolyte interface was developed to predict {{the behavior of a}} conducting polymer called poly(JUG-co-JUGA). The main advantage of this approach is that it can be applied for any polymer assuming a mixed conducting material and a thin enough film neglecting the transport effect. It is the first time where the same model allows both classical cyclic <b>electrogravimetry</b> (current and mass over a potential scan) and ac-electrogravimetry (electrochemical impedance and mass/potential transfer functions) to be estimated theoretically. Moreover and to our knowledge the electrochemical behavior of poly(JUG-co-JUGA) was examined through these techniques for the first time. It is shown herein that the cation transfer is preponderant but the free solvent motion must be taken into account. This effect is not detected by classical electrochemical measurements but only by combining electrochemical characterization to gravimetric measurements...|$|E

Seven compounds were investigated: 4 -aminophenylacetic acid, 4 -aminophenethyl alcohol, 4 -fluoroaniline, 4 -(heptadecafluorooctyl) aniline, 4 -aminoantipyrine, 4 -(4 -aminophenyl) butyric acid and 3, 4, 5 -trimethoxyaniline. Quantitative monitoring of the electrodeposition process {{was carried out by}} <b>electrogravimetry</b> using quartz crystal microbalance (QCM). The electrodeposited mass varies between 26 ng/cm 2 for 4 -fluoroaniline formed during 30 s to 442 ng/cm 2 for 4 -phenylbutyric acid formed during 300 s. The corrosion inhibition properties of aryl-modified layers have been studied in buffer citrate with pH = 3 or 3. 5 % NaCl solutions using electrochemical noise (ECN) and Tafel potentiodynamic polarization measurements.

40|$|Electrochemically formed {{thin films}} are vital {{for a broad}} range of {{applications}} in virtually every field of modern science and technology. Understanding the film formation process could provide a means to aid the characterisation and control of film properties. Herein, we present a fundamental approach that combines two well-established analytical techniques (namely, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and <b>electrogravimetry)</b> with a theoretical approach to provide physico-chemical information on the electrode/electrolyte interface during film formation. This approach allows the monitoring of local and overall surface kinetic parameters with time to enable an evaluation of the different modes of film formation. This monitoring is independent of surface area and surface concentrations of electroactive species and so may allow current computational methods to calculate these parameters and provide a deeper physical understanding of the electrodeposition of new bulk phases. The ability of this method to characterise 3 D phase growth in situ in more detail than that obtained by conventional approaches is demonstrated through the study of a model system, namely, Cu bulk-phase deposition on a Pt electrode covered with a Cu atomic layer (Cuad/Pt) ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{combination}} of different in situ techniques allows {{a more complete}} analysis combining several physical and chemical processes of polymer-modified electrodes to be obtained. The hybrid technique -cyclic <b>electrogravimetry</b> coupled with visible-near infrared spectroscopy- was used to study in depth the electrochemistry of poly(o-toluidine) (POT) thin films. In this work, a POT modified electrode was polarized between the pernigraniline and leucoemeraldine forms in 0. 5 M HNO 3 and 0. 5 M HClO 4 solutions. The electrochromic properties of View the MathML sourcePOT-CIO 4 âˆ’ and View the MathML sourcePOT-NO 3 âˆ’ were localized in the experimental potential range associated to the transfer of charged species during the redox reactions. The analysis of all the experimental results has allowed the main contribution of proton, anion and water transfers to be separated in three redox transitions together with the electrochromic properties of POT. Semi-quantitatively, the better electrochemical and electrochromic properties of both films take place predominantly at potentials where the higher accumulation of the radical cations (polarons and bipolarons) in the polymer structure involves great lattice reorganization.

40|$|AbstractAnalytical Chemistry plays a very {{important}} role in the modern world. The main reasons are; the need of environmental monitoring, quality of food and water control, human health, quality of industrial production control, nanotechnologies and material science. Together with Inorganic Chemistry, Organic Chemistry and Physical Chemistry, Analytical Chemistry is a fundamental chemical course. The education of Analytical Chemists is carried out in 52 Polish universities introduced already in the Bolonia Process, ECTS points and three steps of education: Bachelor's degree (at universities of technology â€“ Engineer's degree), Master's degree and Doctoral Studies. The first level, Bachelor's degree, contains the basic knowledge: gravimetric analysis, <b>electrogravimetry,</b> acid-base titration, oxidation-reduction titration, precipitation titration, complexometric titration and quality assurance and quality control of results. The second level (Master's degree) contains more developed analytical techniques: gas and liquid chromatography, spectrophotometric methods, electrochemical methods, elemental analysis etc. A bachelor's projects as well as a diploma and doctoral thesis very often are prepared in the field of Analytical Chemistry. It is very popular with students, each year we have in Poland about 100 doctorate in this field. The laboratory on Polish universities are well equipped in specialist apparatuses, but it's strongly depended on university profile and how big it is. Some students are doing studies and thesis abroad, in the frame of LLP ERASMUS Program or other international programs.

40|$|Although {{conducting}} polymers {{have been}} studied {{for more than ten}} years, their use in liquid chromatography is still new. This thesis studies the chemical and electrochemical properties of conducting polymers for use in liquid chromatography. The use of these polymers both as novel stationary phases and as electrochemical detection systems was explored. Polypyrrole was chosen as an example throughout this study. The polymer was either electrochemically or chemically synthesized on various substrates. The properties of polypyrrole were characterized using chronoamperometry, chronopotentiometry, elemental analysis, cyclic voltammetry, <b>electrogravimetry,</b> scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive x-ray (EDX) analysis, and fast atomic bombardment mass spectrometry and the results indicated that the polymer was suitable for chromatographic studies. Specifically, it was found that polypyrrole had unique properties in anion exchange. It was also found that the polymer was thermally-sensitive. Hardware and systems for synthesis and characterization of the stationary phases were developed {{in the course of this}} work. Polypyrrole incorporated with chloride and dodecyl-sulfate was deposited on reticulated vitreous carbon (RVC) particles and silica based particles for use as liquid chromatographic stationary phases. The properties of the polypyrrole stationary phases were determined by elemental analysis, surface area analysis, SEM and EDX analysis. Studies using polypyrrole stationary phases in chromatography and electrochemically controlled liquid chromatography were characterized using a selection of test compounds. Both reversed-phase and anion exchange chromatographic behavior was found on the polypyrrole stationary phases, and separations using these mechanisms were achieved. Electrochemical control was found to be effective on RVC based polypyrrole stationary phases. A polypyrrole dispersed-mercury modified electrode was also developed in the course of this work. Its chemical and physical stability, as well as electrochemical sensitivity and selectivity were investigated. It was demonstrated that the electrode could be used in amperometric detection following HPLC separation. This study has indicated that it is possible for conducting polymers to be used in chromatographic separation and detection systems...|$|E
