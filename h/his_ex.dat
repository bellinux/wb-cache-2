Juvenal is thought to extensively lampoon Statius' type of court poetry in his fourth satire on the turbot of Domitian, but he also mentions the immense popularity of Statius' recitations in Satire 7.82ff. In late antiquity, the Thebaid which was by then a classic received a commentary by a Lactantius Placidus.|$|E

25|$|The Audiencia was {{a longstanding}} {{governmental}} institution in New Spain. (The first audiencia {{in the colony}} was created on December 13, 1527 and the second, on February 13, 1548.) In addition to functioning as a court of last resort, the Audiencia oidores also exercised important legislative and executive powers {{in the government of}} New Spain.

This gave him important judicial powers along with his executive and legislative ones. (The viceroy could only set the agenda of the court. Only if a viceroy was a trained lawyer could he rule on cases before the audiencia.) The Crown had shown a strong preference for military men as viceroys, and those that did not have a military background generally had an ecclesiastical one. None were lawyers.|$|E
