50|$|Universal {{measuring}} {{machines are}} measurement devices used for objects in which geometric relationships {{are the most}} critical element, with dimensions specified from geometric locations rather than absolute coordinates. The very first uses for these machines was the inspection of gauges and parts produced by <b>jig</b> <b>grinding.</b> While bearing some resemblance to a coordinate-measuring machine (CMM) its usage and accuracy envelope differs significantly.|$|R
40|$|<b>Jig</b> <b>grinding</b> is {{well known}} as a {{precision}} internal machining process for high precision products such as dies and fixtures. Investigation to realize high productivity and high accuracy is performed with different electrodeposited CBN wheels under various grinding conditions. Grinding characteristics such as grinding forces, torque and surface roughness were measured. The main results obtained are as follows. (1) Grinding accuracy improved {{with an increase in}} peripheral speed of grinding wheel. (2) Grinding forces and torque decrease with an increase in peripheral speed of wheel but increase with wheel depth of cut and work feed rate. (3) Grinding forces and torque increase with the cumulative stock removal which is caused by the progress of attritional wear of CBN abrasive grains. (4) A clear reduction of grinding forces is caused by quill motion overlapping the main axis and is induced by the decrease in the mean chip volume and/or the mean chip cross-sectional area...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, an {{evaluation}} of the <b>jig</b> <b>grinding</b> process using a comprehensive experimentation is performed. There are several factors influencing the performance of the grinding performance. The performance of the process was measured in terms of MRR and Ra. The experiments were conducted based on Taguchi L 9 orthogonal array with the chosen three parameters at three levels. The statistical analysis using ANOVA indicates that none of the parameters are significant at 95 % confidence level. It was observed that speed followed by depth of cut and feed influence the roughness of the ground surfaces. The MRR was influenced by feed followed by speed and depth. The AOM analysis was performed for MRR and Ra at all processing conditions. The response graphs for means and S/N rations were generated for each of the chosen input parameters. Regression equations were developed corresponding to each of these processing conditions. This comprehensive analysis has helped characterize jog grinding at an experimental level...|$|R

40|$|A {{long life}} time {{behaviour}} of ceramic denture requires a ductile machined surface {{to avoid the}} well-known subsurface damages of brittle materials caused by machining. Slow and rapid damage propagation begins at break outs and cracks and limits life time significantly. Therefore ductile machined surfaces are an important demand to machine dental ceramics. Using ceramic materials for an automatic production of ceramic dentures by CAD/CAM is a challenge, {{because a lot of}} technological, medical and optical demands have to be considered. The IPS Empress 2 framework ceramic keeps most of it. This study shows possibilities to machine this ceramic with economical parameters. The machining tests were performed with various parameters such as tool grain size and feed speed. Denture Ceramics were machined by <b>jig</b> <b>grinding</b> on a 5 axis CNC milling machine Maho HGF 500 with a high speed spindle up to 120. 000 rpm. Result of the wear test was low tool wear. With one tool you are able to machine eight occlusal surfaces by roughing and finishing. One occlusal surface takes about 60 minutes machining time. Recommended parameters for roughing are middle diamond grain sized tools (D 107), cutting speed v(c) = 4, 2 m/s, feed rate v(ft) = 1000 mm/min, depth of cut a(e) = 0, 06 mm, width of contact a(p) = 0, 8 and for finishing ultra fine diamond grain sized tools (D 46), cutting speed v(c) = 4, 2 m/s, feed rate v(ft) = 100 mm/min, depth of cut a(e) = 0, 02 mm, width of contact a(p) = 0, 8 mm...|$|R

Small bits that become blunt are often discarded because sharpening them correctly is difficult and they are cheap to replace. For larger bits, special <b>grinding</b> <b>jigs</b> are available.

This new reader consisted of “cementing a thick glass plate to each end of a small block of optical glass.

The end result was a cylinder of glass whose rounded ends acted as lenses.” ...|$|R
