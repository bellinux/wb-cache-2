This study in the Amazonian forest of Peru aimed at investigating if characteristics related to the defecation patterns of tamarins (Saguinus mystax and Saguinus fuscicollis) affected short-term post-dispersal seed fate, through secondary seed dispersal by <b>dung</b> beetles and <b>removal</b> by seed predators. Data on dung beetle activity were based on direct observations of 49 defecations while seed fate was studied using semi-controlled experiments (N = 458 for secondary dispersal and N = 398 for predation). Tamarins produce small defecations with a low number of seeds. Thirty-five per cent of defecations were visited by an average of 1. 5 dung beetles that usually transport the faeces as pellets. Twenty-four per cent of seeds were buried by beetles at a mean depth of 3. 5 cm. With increasing quantities of faecal matter, the probability of secondary seed dispersal increased but not the depth of burial. Seed predation pressure was low (17. 6 %) after 4 d and higher in faeces of S. mystax than in faeces of S. fuscicollis. Despite their small size, tamarins could be considered as high-quality seed dispersers, with a potential role for forest regeneration. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Management-oriented {{models of}} cattle habitat use often treat grazing {{pressure}} {{as a single}} variable summarizing all cattle activities. This paper addresses the following questions: How does the spatial pattern of cattle effects vary between cattle activities in a highly heterogeneous landscape? Do these patterns change over the grazing season as forage availability decreases? What are the respective roles of natural and management-introduced structures? We estimated the intensity of herbage <b>removal,</b> <b>dung</b> deposition and trampling after each of three grazing periods on a grid of 25 m × 25 m cells covering an entire paddock in the Swiss Jura Mountains. We found no significant positive correlations between cattle effects. Spatial patterns weakened through the season for grazing and trampling, whereas dunging patterns changed little between grazing periods. Redundancy analysis showed that different cattle effects were correlated with different environmental variables and {{that the importance of}} management-introduced variables was highest for herbage removal. Autocorrelograms and partial redundancy analyses using principal coordinates of neighbour matrices suggested that dunging patterns were more coarse-grained than the others. Systematic differences in the spatial and seasonal patterns of cattle effects may result in complex interactions with vegetation involving feedback effects through nutrient shift, with strong implications for ecosystem management. In heterogeneous environments, such as pasture-woodland landscapes, spatially explicit models of vegetation dynamics need to model cattle effects separately...|$|R

In this study we investigated the relationship between dung beetle community attributes (determined through trapping) and function (using <b>dung</b> <b>removal</b> experiments that allowed different dung beetle functional groups to access the dung) in rainforest and cleared pasture in a tropical landscape in Australia 2 ̆ 7 s Wet Tropics. Species richness, abundance and biomass were higher in rainforest compared to adjacent pasture, and species composition between these land use types differed significantly. However, average body size and evenness in body size were higher in pasture than in rainforest. <b>Dung</b> <b>removal</b> was higher in rainforest than in pasture when both functional groups or tunnelers only could access the dung. Increased <b>dung</b> <b>removal</b> in the rainforest was explained by higher biodiversity and dominance of a small number of species with distinct body sizes, as <b>dung</b> <b>removal</b> was best predicted by the evenness in body size of the community.

Exposure to veterinary anthelmintic residues in livestock dung can have lethal and sublethal effects on dung beetles, and can reduce rates of <b>dung</b> <b>removal,</b> but {{the immediate and}} longer-term consequences for other dung beetle mediated functions have rarely been studied. We investigated the consequences of anthelmintic exposure on survival of the dung beetle Aphodius fossor and its delivery of four ecosystems functions that underpin pasture production: <b>dung</b> <b>removal,</b> soil fauna feeding activity, primary productivity, and reduction of soil compaction.

For <b>dung</b> <b>removal,</b> we found a significant interaction between the timing of exposure and functioning: while <b>dung</b> <b>removal</b> was impaired by concurrent exposure to high levels of ivermectin, functioning was unaffected when beetles that had been exposed previously to the same concentration of anthelmintic later interacted with untreated dung. Other ecosystem functions were not affected significantly by anthelmintic exposure, and there was no evidence to suggest any persistent impact of anthelmintic exposure on ecosystem multifunctionality. While anthelmintic residues remain a significant threat to dung beetle populations, for adult beetles, we found no evidence that residues have detrimental consequences for ecosystem functioning beyond the immediate point of exposure...|$|E

This effect of cattle activity on gap revegetation can be subdivided in three main factors: herbage <b>removal,</b> trampling and <b>dung</b> and urine deposition. The {{objective of this}} study was to assess how these three effects moderate the plant succession following gap creation. In an exclosure, four controlled treatments simulating cattle activity (repeated mowing, trampling, manuring and untreated control) were applied on plots of 2 2 m.

During three years, vegetation changes were monitored in spring and in autumn, with a square grid of 100 cells of 0. 01 m 2 centred on the gap. Our experiment confirmed that fine-scale gap creation may have a high impact on relative abundances of species in the community.

The {{objective of this}} study was to assess the effects of these factors, separately or in combination, and to compare them with cattle grazing over a one year period in a field experiment conducted in the Jura Mountains of northwestern Switzerland. A set of controlled treatments simulating the three factors was applied in a fenced area: (1) repeated mowing – three levels; (2) intensive trampling – two levels; (3) manuring with a liquid mixture of dung and urine – three levels. All treatments were applied homogeneously to the entire surface of each of the 40 plots inside the exclosure. Additionally, ten plots outside the fenced area represented reference plots with regular cattle pasturing. The multivariate response of species composition was assessed three times with the point-intercept method: in spring before the treatments, in autumn after one season of treatments and at the beginning of the following year after winter rest. Multivariate analyses of vegetation data in the first year showed an overwhelming seasonal shift and significant differences induced by treatments. Abandoned and manured plots showed the largest deviation from the cattle grazed reference. Herbage removal, simulated by repeated mowing, appeared to be the most important factor for maintaining vegetation texture. Seasonal treatment effects were only partially carried over to the next spring, showing an unexpected resilience of the plant community, probably due to life-history traits and competition release following climatic disturbance in winter...|$|R

40|$|Agricultural {{expansion}} and intensification are major threats to global biodiversity, ecological functions, and ecosystem services. The {{rapid expansion of}} oil palm in forested tropical landscapes is of particular concern given their high biodiversity. Identifying management approaches that maintain native species and associated ecological processes within oil palm plantations is therefore a priority. Riparian reserves are strips of forest retained alongside rivers in cultivated areas, primarily for their positive hydrological impact. However, they can also support a range of forest-dependent species or ecosystem services. We surveyed communities of dung beetles and measured <b>dung</b> <b>removal</b> activity in an oil palm-dominated landscape in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. The species richness, diversity, and functional group richness of dung beetles in riparian reserves {{were significantly higher than}} in oil palm, but lower than in adjacent logged forests. The community composition of the riparian reserves was more similar to logged forest than oil palm. Despite the pronounced differences in biodiversity, we did not find significant differences in <b>dung</b> <b>removal</b> rates among land uses. We also found no evidence that riparian reserves enhance <b>dung</b> <b>removal</b> rates within surrounding oil palm. These results contrast previous studies showing positive relationships between dung beetle species richness and <b>dung</b> <b>removal</b> in tropical forests.

Synthesis and applications: The similarity between riparian reserves and logged forest demonstrates that retaining riparian reserves increases biodiversity within oil palm landscapes.

Our study examined the effects of dung beetle body mass on <b>dung</b> <b>removal</b> at two levels. First, we used the lab experiment to evaluate the efficiency of eight dung beetle species belonging to two functional groups (tunnelers, dwellers) on <b>dung</b> <b>removal.</b> Second, the same species employed in the lab were used in field mesocosms {{to examine the effects of}} the two functional groups on <b>dung</b> <b>removal</b> maintaining realistic differences in the total body mass between tunneler and dweller assemblages.

We used a statistical approach (offset method) which took into account a priori constraints due to the study design allowing us to analyse the effect of larger species in mesocosm style experiments. Body size played a crucial role in dung removal: large beetles were more efficient than small ones and the percentage of removed dung increased with higher body mass heterogeneity. Tunnelers were more efficient than dwellers over both short and long time periods (one month and one year). Significant effects of dwellers were found only after one year.

This thesis {{examines the}} suitability of controlled and wilderness grazing as conservation management tool for open, nutrient-poor habitats. It tests the Resource-mediated Successional Grazing Cycle (RSGC) theory, which claims that free-ranging large grazers can act as driving force for successional woodland-grassland cycles. The hypotheses were that free-ranging cattle create grassland in woodland (i), deplete the nutrient pools of these grasslands (ii), induce invasion of woody pioneers because of this depletion (iii). During the subsequent woodland phase the soil nutrient pool is replenished (iv). The study {{was carried out in}} the Wolfhezerheide, The Netherlands. The vegetation was composed of 19 ha of woodland, 33 ha of grassland and 9 ha of Calluna heathland. The area was year-round grazed by free-ranging cattle (90 kg ha - 1 yr - 1) after 1983. Atmospheric N-deposition varied from 25 - 60 kg ha - 1 yr - 1 depending on the vegetation. Vegetation change was monitored. Habitat and diet selection were quantified by 24 -h observation and bite counting. On the basis of these data, nutrient balances were assessed for the whole area, the successional communities and excreta and excreta-free patches in the grassland. The results showed that cattle induced grasslawns in gaps in the heathland and woodland. They suppressed woody and tall herbaceous species in the woodland undergrowth and introduced grass seeds by <b>dung</b> deposition. Nutrient <b>removal</b> only exceeded the atmospheric inputs on excreta-free patches in the grassland for phosphorus and potassium. Nutrients were removed from these sites by off-take and gaseous excreta-N losses. Cattle also reduced the interception deposition. Nutrient depletion favoured the invasion of pioneer dwarfshrubs (Calluna) and trees (Pinus sylvestris and Betula spp) in the grass lawns. This result was related to the carbon-based chemical resistance of the involved woody pioneers. Cattle and wild herbivores only prevented wood encroachment on relatively nutrient-rich grasslands. Wood invasion and abandoning by the cattle induced replenishment of the soil nutrient pool. The results confirmed the RSGC hypotheses and emphasised the interaction of herbivory and plant resources as determinants of cyclic plant succession. These findings implicate that wilderness grazing may generate temporary open, nutrient-poor habitats in dry uplands, but incompleteness of the abiotic gradient, successional mosaics and herbivore assemblage will restrict the openness and soil depletion. Under these circumstances, conservation managers might prefer controlled grazing. Forced summer grazing, nutrient removal from grass lawns by housing of the animals during the night and additional removal of unwanted species seemed to mimic natural herbivory...|$|R
40|$|The Effects of Tropical Forest Management on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Functioning Eleanor M. Slade 1. 	Between 35 % and 50 % of all closed-canopy {{tropical}} forest has been lost, {{and the rate}} of deforestation continues to increase throughout the tropics. Despite a wealth of literature on the effects of {{tropical forest}} disturbance on the diversity and composition of a variety of taxa, there is still no clear consensus on the value of disturbed forests for biodiversity. 2. 	If forest management practises are to be sustainable in the long-term they should maintain both biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (the interactions and processes of the ecosystem), as well as a timber harvest. However, few studies have investigated the extent to which ecosystem functioning is reduced in logged forests. The effects of different logging intensities on a variety of taxa, and the ecosystem processes with which they are associated, were assessed in the Danum Valley Conservation Area in Sabah (Malaysian Borneo). 3. 	Even under high logging intensities, the forests of Sabah appear to have been managed in a way that maintains timber yields in the short-term. However, other aspects of forest structure had been affected, which could have important consequences ecologically, and for the long-term sustainability of timber harvests. 4. 	Combining field studies with manipulative experiments allows assessment of the impacts of species changes associated with habitat modification on measures of ecosystem functioning. Dung beetle (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae: Scarabaeinae) functional group richness and composition were manipulated in a series of field experiments. Certain functional groups and species were found to have a greater impact on ecosystem functioning than others; nevertheless a full complement of species was needed to maintain full ecosystem functioning. 5. 	Dung beetles appeared to be relatively robust to changes in forest structure associated with selective logging, but species richness was reduced with high-intensity logging. There was a corresponding decrease in ecosystem functioning (<b>dung</b> and seed <b>removal)</b> with a decrease in species richness, and a decrease in the biomass of large nocturnal tunnellers, suggesting that although some species are dominant, rare species are also needed to preserve full ecosystem functioning. 6. 	A complex interaction between birds and ants resulted in reduced herbivory of seedlings of the important timber tree, Parashorea malaanonan, in some instances. However, this interaction was not affected by either selective or high intensity logging. Seedfall of P. malaanonan, was reduced in logged forest compared to primary forest. Despite insect seed predation being higher in primary forest, there was still successful recruitment during a non-mast year. Parasitism of insect-predated seeds was found to be inversely density dependent, and was higher in logged forest where seed predation was lower. 7. 	The results of this thesis suggest that the forests of Sabah appear to be being logged under a management system that is compatible with sustainable timber management, but not necessarily sustainable forest management. Low intensity selective logging seems to preserve much of the original forest structure, biodiversity and ecosystem functioning compared to logging at higher intensities. However, ecosystem processes were variable in their response to logging, suggesting that management decisions should be based on the consideration of multiple taxa and processes...|$|R
40|$|Biomass {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} resources in smallholder farms in Africa. It is used for fuel, soil organic matter, construction materials and animal feed. While the main source of fuel in the household is wood, other types of on-farm resources are used. In fact, most fuel sources in Kenya are supplied by non-forest trees and traditional fuels (i. e. <b>dung,</b> crop residues). <b>Removal</b> of biomass from the farm as a source of fuel, could lead to decreasing levels of soil organic matter and nutrient availability. An alternative is the pyrolysis of biomass residues while cooking, which can provide fuel energy and biochar as a soil amendment. The first step to establishing a smallholder farm biochar- bioenergy system is the assessment of biomass resources and their capacity to sustain household energy consumption. We carried out a biomass and energy consumption assessment in 50 household in the Highland of western Kenya, investigating the variation of biomass availability with age, farm size and feedstock. Current household energy consumption patterns were determined as well as whether on-farm biomass energy can sustain the current energy use. This thesis presents data on household energy consumption patterns when a pyrolysis stove is introduced in the household and the percent return of biochar after cooking. Total biomass productivity varied with farm age, with an average of 5. 76 t farm- 1. Current energy consumption per capita averages 11. 27 GJ yr- 1. Wood biomass productivity alone does not currently support energy consumption. However, based on our data total biomass productivity including crop residues, shrub and tree litter can provide 18. 27 GJ capita- 1 farm- 1 yr- 1 of energy for cooking needs. The introduction of a pyrolysis stove can improve the system even further by providing the necessary energy to cook but also producing an average of 0. 5 t of biochar per household yr- 1. A system that combines the production of biochar and bioenergy may be able to address several constraints facing resource-poor farmers in Africa. Pyrolysis cook stoves in combination with a biochar return to soil may have the potential to provide farmers with an increase in crop productivity and energy efficiency. However, biomass serves more than one purpose in the farm and its removal from the fields as a source of fuel can also have negative effects in the nutrient balance of the soil. Currently farmers use a portion of on-farm biomass as fuel, while the rest is kept in the fields as a source of organic matter. Both the fresh biomass and ash serve as sources of soil amendments. However, both amendments have limitations. The quality of the fresh residue can determine the mineralization and availability of specific nutrients (i. e N); while ash is void of important plant nutrients like N limiting its usefulness as a soil amendment. Therefore, the second objective of this thesis was to investigate the short term effects of applying charred and ashed plant residues in comparison to fresh residue return on maize biomass productivity and nutrition. Fresh biomass was applied at an initial rate of 18. 05 g pot- 1, while 46 - 65 % less biochar and and 90 - 96 % less ash were applied according to pyrolysis and combustion conversion efficiency for each feedstock. Dry biomass production increased by 400 % and 350 % with application of biochar and ash, respectively, when compared to fresh biomass from nutrient-poor residues. Important differences existed between different plant residues. Pyrolysis or ashing did not improve crop growth for nutrient-rich amendments such as collard stalks which are best applied as fresh biomass. On the other hand, nutrient-poor feedstocks such as cobs and maize stover are most effective as organic amendments when pyrolyzed or fully combusted to ash...|$|R

In {{order to determine}} the effect of the 2 groups on <b>dung</b> <b>removal</b> rate, as well as the associated mechanisms, we conducted a two-factor, two-level factorial-designed experiment in an alpine meadow of eastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Four treatments were included: (A) flies excluded, beetles included; (B) beetles excluded, flies included; (C) both flies and beetles excluded; and (D) both flies and beetles included, each having 45 replicates of artificial dung pats (17 cm in diameter; ca. 248 g in dry weight). We examined dung quality, removal rates, and abundance and biomass of macro-soil faunas within the dung 9 times (5 replicates sampled each time) during the experimental period of 32 d. Both beetles and flies (maggots), as well as the interaction between the 2 groups, markedly affected the <b>dung</b> <b>removal</b> rates. The total dry weight loss of the dung during the experiment was 167. 6 g and 127. 5 g on average for the beetle and fly groups, respectively. The removal rate in terms of both dung weight and organic matter loss was significantly greater for the beetles than the flies, which was principally because the consumption rate was lower and the resident time was shorter for fly maggots than for the beetles. The coexistence of the 2 species increased <b>dung</b> <b>removal</b> synergistically on the first sampling day and additively between the 2 (nd) and the 5 (th) day. However, after the 8 (th) day of the experiment, the coexistence effect was negative, such that the dung loss of treatment D was comparable to treatment A but significantly greater than treatment B. The synergistic control might be due to the mediating effect of predator beetles on the relative abundance of coprophagous beetles and maggots, and the negative effect of the functional group diversity was because of the overwhelming competitive advantage of the beetles over fly maggots. In conclusion, although both fly and beetle species may significantly contribute to <b>dung</b> <b>removal,</b> the effect of the interaction between flies and beetles appears to depend on dung age (the sampling timing) in the alpine meadow.

In total, 7923 individuals from 39 species of dung beetle were collected. There {{were no significant differences}} in abundance, biomass or diversity across sites.

The environmental and vegetation variables measured had little influence on species composition. An average of 63 – 99 % of dung was removed over 24 h.

Overall, dung beetle communities and associated ecosystem functions were robust to low-intensity but not high-intensity selective logging.

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{problems}} facing the meat and leather industries is dung cladding on hides. Dung dried onto hides is difficult to remove {{during the early stages}} of processing, resulting in the necessity for prolonging the soaking step, with the consequence of risking bacterial damage to the hides. Microscopic examination of dung on hide reveals that adhesion is between the dung and the hair alone, with no sticking of the dung to the epidermis. This accounts for the difficulty in removing dry dung; the matrix of the hair within the dung creates a strong composite material. Analysis shows that major components of the composition of dung are lignocellulosic materials (lignin, hemicellulose and cellulose). This project concerns solubilising the dung faster, to reduce soaking time by targeting these components with enzyme technology, using hemicellulases, cellulases, and laccases from commercial products and a range of fungal organisms (Coriolus versicolor and Aspergillus niger). Removal of dung from hide pieces is affected by the action of cellulase, xylanase and laccase separately over 20 - 24 hours. Mixture of these enzymes removes dung in 6 - 8 hours demonstrating that synergistic activity is more effective than separate enzyme treatments. When commercial enzyme mixture or Coriolus versicolor or Aspergillus niger cultural broths were used to effect <b>dung</b> <b>removal</b> in tannery drums in a larger scale experiment, in some cases the removal of dung was observed within 1 hour by the help of the mechanical action and nonionic surfactant. The enzyme treatment did not affect the components of hide, such as collagen, hyaluronic acid and dermatan sulphate and it was found that enzyme treated leathers and control samples showed no differences in terms of their physical characteristics. Investigations in the mechanism of <b>dung</b> <b>removal</b> by spectrophotometry, chromatography and chemical techniques show that the enzyme treatments remove the dung from hides without changing the fundamental structure of the substrate. The enzymes probably attack the structural parts in lignocellulose, which are most susceptible to solubilising with enzymes: these attacks make small changes in the carbohydrate and lignin contents, but these changes are powerful enough for effective <b>dung</b> <b>removal...</b>|$|E
40|$|Land-use {{change has}} become a force of global {{importance}} and has gained status {{as the most important}} driver of ecosystem degradation. The resulting creation of habitat edges has pervasive impacts on the distribution and persistence of species in forest ecosystems. Responses of species to edge effects can be highly dependent on ‘response’ traits, which may in turn co-vary with ‘effect’ traits that determine rates of ecosystem functioning. Therefore, non-random loss of species due to traits conferring higher susceptibility to extinction may also result in the loss of functionally-important species across a habitat edge gradient. Likewise, response and effect traits may be important in determining reassembly of communities in regenerating habitats, which may provide insight into potential scenarios of functional responses to restoration efforts. To test for potential off-site effects of adjacent matrix habitat restoration on dung beetle communities, I compared dung beetle community structure and species trait composition across Afromontane forest edges adjacent to degraded and regenerating matrix habitat at Ngel Nyaki forest reserve in Nigeria. I also measured <b>dung</b> <b>removal</b> rates across habitat edge gradients to investigate the relative off-site impacts of matrix restoration on dung beetle-mediated ecosystem processes. I found significant effects of adjacent matrix condition on edge response functions in dung beetle abundance, species distributions, and trait composition. Beetle abundances were markedly higher in forests adjacent to regenerating matrix, whereas the largest differences in trait composition were found between degraded and regenerating matrix habitat, indicating the presence of ecological filtering processes in these areas. Furthermore, I found that species traits determined community structural responses to environmental change and this had strong flow-on effects to rates of <b>dung</b> <b>removal.</b> Shifts in trait distributions explained <b>dung</b> <b>removal</b> rates above and beyond total beetle mass, suggesting that neutral processes alone could not explain functional efficiency. In particular, habitat regeneration resulted in the assembly of communities with high total beetle mass and on-average smaller beetles, which was optimal for functional efficiency. In conclusion, the restoration of adjacent matrix habitat was shown to effectively mitigate edge effects on dung beetle community structure resulting in the re-establishment of important associated ecosystem processes...|$|E
40|$|Communities are {{influenced}} by many factors, with anthropogenic impacts {{being one of the}} strongest. These factors can influence community structure and may cause non-random species loss by filtering certain traits of species, which may also determine how a species contributes to ecosystem functioning. The structure of a community can also be highly variable over short timescales and across seasons, as abiotic factors can alter a resource over the course of days and also alter intensity of competition within a community. These short-timescale influences are most noticeable in an ephemeral resource that is limited in both space and time. Changes in community structure and interactions can be represented as networks of interactions (links) among species (nodes). Interaction networks describe a community and incorporate non-trophic interactions, which can alter their structure. These are generally measured by counting the number of trophic interactions, ignoring non-trophic interactions such as competition. However, competitive interactions may be important for network dynamics, yet the most appropriate way to quantify competition remains unclear. The outcome of a competitive interaction could potentially be predicted by the body size ofcompeting individuals, and this would remove the need to observe individual interactions. These ideas were tested using the dung-associated community in an Afromontane forest reserve in Nigeria across variation in seasons and in areas that were protected from anthropogenic impacts by fencing. Trapping and recording of interactions within the community was used to assess community structure, and experiments were run to test how <b>dung</b> <b>removal</b> and secondary seed dispersal changed across seasons and in protected areas of the forest. The influence of competition was determined by altering the size and number of dung beetles present at the resource. The community structure was influenced by forest protection and varied across seasons. Additionally, the size and number of dung beetles present was higher in protected areas in the wet season, resulting in higher <b>dung</b> <b>removal</b> and secondary seed dispersal and indicating non-random species loss in unprotected areas. The attractiveness of the dung resource changed over short timescales and desiccation occurred rapidly in the dry season, which resulted in decreased insect abundance and diversity over the course of days. Individual <b>dung</b> <b>removal</b> rates were not additive, and could only be used to predict community-level <b>dung</b> <b>removal</b> when taking into account competitive interactions. The body-size ratio between winners and losers of a competition was a good predictor of an interaction outcome. Competition networks were highly connected and nested, with compartmentalisation occurring in the competition network. At the community level, effects of forest protection and changing seasons only altered network nestedness. Therefore, body size can be used to predict species responses to anthropogenic threats and community structure and function when taking into account density-dependent competitive interactions. Furthermore, when determining community responses to anthropogenic threats, sampling across changes in seasons and observing competitive interactions provides more information about a community structure and stability...|$|E

40|$|Much of the {{literature}} on the relationship between species richness or functional group richness and measures of ecosystem function focuses on a restricted set of ecosystem function measures and taxonomic groups. Few such studies have been carried out under realistic levels of diversity in the field, particularly in high diversity ecosystems such as tropical forests. We used exclusion experiments to study the effects of dung beetle functional group richness and composition on two interlinked and functionally important ecological processes, <b>dung</b> <b>removal</b> and secondary seed dispersal, in evergreen tropical forest in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. Overall, both dung and seed removal increased with dung beetle functional group richness. However, levels of ecosystem functioning were idiosyncratic depending on the identity of the functional groups present, indicating an important role for functional group composition. There was no evidence for interference or competition among functional groups. We found strong evidence for overyielding and transgressive overyielding, suggesting complementarity or facilitation among functional groups. Not all mixtures showed transgressive overyielding, so that complementarity was restricted to particular functional group combinations. Beetles in a single functional group (large nocturnal tunnellers) had a disproportionate influence on measures of ecosystem function: in their absence <b>dung</b> <b>removal</b> is reduced by approximately 75 %. However, a full complement of functional groups is required to maximize ecosystem functioning. This study highlights the importance of both functional group identity and species composition in determining the ecosystem consequences of extinctions or altered patterns in the relative abundance of species...|$|E
40|$|Dung beetles mediate {{a variety}} of {{important}} ecosystem services in both natural and human-modified habitats. These services {{are associated with the}} exploitation of dung by beetles for breeding and feeding, with different functional groups using dung in different ways. While many studies have considered how individual ecosystem functions and services (primarily <b>dung</b> <b>removal</b> and seed dispersal) are affected by changes in dung beetle diversity, fewer studies have considered the consequences for multiple functions and services. We used manipulative experiments to evaluate the functional efficiency of three species of dung beetles, each representing one of the three functional groups present in temperate Europe. Standardising beetle biomass, we compared single-species treatments to a three-species mixture containing each of the species in equal biomass. We then measured three ecosystem services relevant in supporting pasture-based livestock production systems: <b>dung</b> <b>removal,</b> soil fauna activity, and soil aeration. The presence of dung beetles significantly elevated all three ecosystem services. However, delivery of each service peaked under different treatments, indicating that no single-species assemblage can provide maximum functioning across multiple services. For all three services, the three-species polyculture provided a level of functioning indistinguishable from the most efficient single-species treatment. Our results highlight the importance of considering multiple functions and services when assessing the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, and suggest that the conservation of functional richness within dung beetle communities could {{play an important role in}} securing the delivery of multiple ecosystem services...|$|E

40|$|As {{the human}} {{population}} expands, agricultural expansion and intensification will exert an increasing pressure on remaining habitats, especially in the tropics. Oil palm {{is one of the}} most rapidly expanding crops in these regions, and identifying management strategies that conserve biodiversity and ecosystem services in these landscapes is therefore a priority. I assess whether riparian forest fragments (riparian reserves) conserve species and the functions they support within oil palm landscapes. Riparian forests are legally required for their beneficial impact on hydrological dynamics and their potential to contribute to the conservation of terrestrial species is poorly documented. I focussed on two ecologically important indicator groups (ants and dung beetles) and the ecosystem processes that they support. Whilst protecting primary forest will remain the most important strategy for biodiversity conservation, I found that riparian reserves do support species of ants and dung beetles that would not otherwise persist in oil palm landscapes. However, the extent to which riparian reserves maintained key ecological functions differed between these two taxa. The amount of nutrient distribution carried out by ants in riparian reserves was similar to logged forest areas, and higher than in oil palm. In contrast, <b>dung</b> <b>removal</b> functions did not vary between these land uses. I also investigated how the vegetation structure and landscape context of riparian reserves affects the dung beetle communities they support. Increasing reserve width and proximity to other forest fragments had a positive impact on the species richness and diversity of dung beetles in riparian reserves. There was little evidence that riparian reserves enhance the provision of <b>dung</b> <b>removal</b> or pest control services in adjacent areas of oil palm. The results provide evidence to support the introduction and/or enforcement of legislation to protect riparian forest reserves in order to conserve biodiversity and ecological processes in oil palm landscapes.

The first week of colonisation was crucial to quick <b>dung</b> <b>removal,</b> despite the high heterogeneity of colonisation of such patchy and ephemeral resource. The second week reinforced the role of earlier colonisers by showing antagonistic effects that were probably due to the top-down regulation of dung removers by predators and parasites in grazed ecosystems...|$|E

In the dry season termites removed more baits at the top-catena positions than at the bottom positions, but there was no effect of catena position in the wet season.
