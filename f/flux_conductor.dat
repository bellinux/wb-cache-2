40|$|Presented on Wednesday, March 16, 2011 from 3 : 00 pm to 4 : 00 pm in Howey {{building}} lecture Room 5 on the Georgia Tech Campus. Runtime: 44 : 52 minutesThe discovery by Meissner and Ochsenfeld in 1933 {{that the}} magnetic field inside a conductor is expelled when it is cooled down to become superconducting was considered very surprising at the time. Meissner wrote that this has no classical explanation. Since then virtually every textbook stresses that this means that a superconductor is in fact not just a zero resistivity perfect conductor but in addition has the mysterious property that it can expel internal magnetic flux. In this colloquium I will present evidence {{that this is all}} a misunderstanding based on insufficient knowledge of what classical physics in fact predicts about the magnetic <b>flux</b> inside perfect <b>conductors...</b>|$|R
50|$|Laithwaite {{developed}} a repulsive-based maglev using two long conductors set {{on either side}} of a <b>flux</b> plate. The <b>conductors</b> ran down the top of the plate off the end, were bent through 180 degrees, and then ran back {{along the top of the}} plate, forming a long U-shape. Running current through the loops of wire caused magnetic fields that were repulsive over the loops, and attractive in the area between them. This meant that if the motor became uncentered compared to the stator plate, it would naturally feel a force pulling it back to the center. The only downside of this approach is that the vehicle in proper alignment feels both attractive and repulsive forces, meaning that greater energy is needed to provide the required amount of lift. The system did not provide thrust, only lift, so the team proposed to place a thin LIM between the two lift coils.|$|R

Introduction: 2 HP Three Phase Induction Motor, No. 83362, Type 1, Form K. 1800 R. P. M., 110 Volts, 60 Cycles, 12 amperes. The primary or rotor {{of the motor}} is mounted in a hollow {{cylindrical}} frame of cast iron. This frame also forms {{the base of the}} machine and supports two end plates which contain the rotor bearings. The bearings consist of brass boxes arranged to be lubricated by two rings in each bearing. These rings revolve as the shaft turns carrying the oil from a chamber below the bearings. The primary consists of an iron core which is built up of sheet steel stampings. The core is firmly bolted to the frame. The conductors, which are copper wires or bars, depending upon the size of the machine, are placed in grooves in the core. These coils are insulated from the core and from each other where more than one conductor is placed in a slot. The windings, which are (y) connected, are held in the slots by thin wedges of tough wood, to protect the winding from mechanical injury, and also from the mechanical pull due to the reaction of the flux in the rotor. The secondary member or rotor is built up of laminated sheet steel. The laminae are insulated from each other by sheets of tissue paper or by a coating of japan, {{in order to reduce the}} loss by eddy currents which are induced by the <b>flux.</b> The <b>conductors</b> in this member are heavy copper bars which are short circuited at the ends of the rotor by heavy copper plates...|$|R
40|$|In {{centering}} electrodynamic bearings, {{the guiding}} forces {{result from the}} interaction between eddy currents generated by a magnetic <b>flux</b> variation in <b>conductors</b> and the magnetic field. Predicting the dynamical behavior {{of this kind of}} bearings is not easy given the interactions between the electromagnetic nature of the forces and the rotational machinery aspects. In this paper, an electromechanical model, able to explain, predict, analyze and simulate the dynamical behavior of bearings submitted to eddy current forces, is applied on a homopolar null-flux electrodynamic bearing. The identification of the modelâ€™s parameters is done based on quasi-static FEM simulation results. Thanks to the insight the electromechanical model gives on the physics involved in the bearing, the dynamical stability and the stiffness of the bearing are analyzed {{as a function of the}} bearing spin speed. For various operation conditions like a constant external load or a static unbalance, the behavior of the electrodynamic bearing is simulated and examined using the electromechanical model. For all these operation conditions, the influence of the external damping, necessary to stabilize the system is analyzed. The amount of necessary damping to introduce is discussed and also its impact on the overall bearing consumptio...|$|R
50|$|Another less general type of {{magnetic}} sensing mechanism in animals {{that has been}} thoroughly described is the inductive sensing methods used by sharks, stingrays and chimaeras (cartilaginous fish). These species possess a unique electroreceptive organ known as ampullae of Lorenzini which can detect a slight variation in electric potential. These organs {{are made up of}} mucus-filled canals that connect from the skin's pores to small sacs within the animal's flesh that are also filled with mucus. The ampullae of Lorenzini are capable of detecting DC currents and have been proposed {{to be used in the}} sensing of the weak electric fields of prey and predators. These organs could also possibly sense magnetic fields, by means of Faraday's law: as a conductor moves through a magnetic field an electric potential is generated. In this case the conductor is the animal moving through a magnetic field, and the potential induced depends on the time varying rate of <b>flux</b> through the <b>conductor</b> according to.These organs detect very small fluctuations in the potential difference between the pore and the base of the electroreceptor sack. An increase in potential results in a decrease in the rate of nerve activity, and a decrease in potential results in an increase in the rate of nerve activity. This is analogous to the behavior of a current carrying conductor; with a fixed channel resistance, an increase in potential would decrease the amount of current detected, and vice versa. These receptors are located along the mouth and nose of sharks and stingrays.|$|R
40|$|Magnetically driven imploding liner {{systems can}} be used as a source of shock energy for {{materials}} equation of state studies, implosion driven magnetized plasma fusion experiments, and other similar applications. The imploding liner is a cylinder of conducting material through which a current is passed in the longitudinal direction. Interaction of the current with its own magnetic field causes the liner to implode. Sources of electrical energy for imploding liner systems are capacitor banks or explosive pulse power systems seeded by capacitor banks. In August, 1996, a high energy liner experiment (HEL- 1) was conducted at the All-Russia Scientific Research Institute (VNIIEF) in Sarov, Russia. A 5 tier 1 meter diameter explosive disk generator provided electrical energy to drive a 48 cm outside diameter, 4 mm thick, aluminum alloy liner having a mass of about 11 kg onto an 11 cm diameter diagnostic package. The purpose of the experiment was to measure performance of the explosive pulse power generator and the heavy imploding liner. Electrical performance diagnostics included inductive (B-dot) probes, Faraday Rotation current measurement, Rogowski total current measurement, and voltage probes. <b>Flux</b> loss and <b>conductor</b> motion diagnostics included current-joint voltage measurements and motion sensing contact pins. Optical and electrical impact pins, inductive (B-dot) probes, manganin pressure probes, and continuously recording resistance probes in the Central Measuring Unit (CMU) and Piezo and manganin pressure probes, optical beam breakers, and inductive probes located in the glide planes were used as liner symmetry and velocity diagnostics. Preliminary analysis of the data indicate that a peak current of more than 100 MA was attained and the liner velocity was between 6. 7 km/sec and 7. 5 km/sec. Liner kinetic energy was between 22 MJ and 35 MJ. 4 refs., 6 figs., 1 tab...|$|R
40|$|The Segmented Rail Phased Induction Motor (SERAPHIM) is a compact, pulsed linear {{induction}} motor (LIM) offering a unique capability for very high speed train propulsion. It uses technology developed for the Sandia coilgun, an electromagnetic launcher designed to accelerate projectiles to several kilometers per second. Both aluminum cylinders and plates were accelerated to a kilometer per second (Mach 3) by passing through a sequence of coils which were energized at the appropriate time. Although this technology was developed for ultra-high velocity, it can be readily adapted to train propulsion for which, at sea level, the power required to overcome air resistance limits the operational speed to a more modest 300 mph. Here, the geometry is reversed. The coils are on the vehicle and the ``projectiles`` are fixed along the roadbed. SERAPHIM operates not by embedding <b>flux</b> in a <b>conductor,</b> but by excluding it. In this propulsion scheme, pairs of closely spaced coils on the vehicle straddle a segmented aluminum reaction rail. A high frequency current is switched on as a coil pair crosses an edge and remains off as they overtake the next segment. This induces surface currents which repel the coil. In essence, the pulsed coils push off segment edges because at the high frequency of operation, the flux has insufficient time to penetrate. In contrast to conventional LIMs, the performance actually improves with velocity, even for a minimal motor consisting of a single coil pair reacting with a single plate. This paper will present results of proof-of-principle tests, electromagnetic computer simulations, and systems analysis. It is concluded that this new linear {{induction motor}} can be implemented using existing technology and is a promising alternative propulsion method for very high speed rail transportation...|$|R
40|$|From power {{distribution}} across large distances to radio transmissions, coupled inductors are used extensively in electrical applications. Their properties allow for increasing or decreasing voltage and current, transferring impedance through a circuit, {{and they can}} isolate two circuits from each other electrically. There are {{a wide variety of}} applications which exploit properties of transformers, such as tesla coils, impedance matching in audio frequency applications, potential transformers for reading very high voltages, Scott-T transformers which convert twophase components to three-phase (or vice versa), and many more. This module explains the functions of coupled inductors and explores the equations governing their performance. It will present mutual inductance, dot notation, the coupling coefficient, the turns ratio, and finally the ideal transformer. This module will explain how to model coupled inductors and provide modeling examples in MapleSim. Introducing Coupled Inductors As current flows through a conductor, a magnetic field is generated. Steady-state currentwill induce a steady magnetic field, and likewise a time-varying current will induce a timevarying magnetic field. Nearby conductors will generate a current as the varying magnetic <b>flux</b> permates the <b>conductor,</b> as stated by Faraday's law. This principle is known as inductance. To begin investigating coupled inductance, recall that the voltage across an inductor is proportional to the change in current. L is the inductance of the conductor, in henry's [...] Eq. (1) Figure 1 : Two coils are magnetically coupled, wound around a magnetic core. With coupled inductors, such as those shown in figure 1, two wires are wrapped around a magnetic core. In this diagram, note that the two wires are wrapped around the core in opposite directions and produce the same polarity of voltage. This is due to Lenz's law. A varying magnetic field, generated by the current, will induce a current in the opposite direction on the coupled coil. Heinrich Lenz added the negative sign to Faraday's law of induction, below. Here, is the change in magnetic flux and is the electromotive force [...] Eq. (2) The flux within the magnetic core of the coupled inductors depends on the material of the core, the number of turns of the wire around the core, and the current. The voltage across the inductor is related to the flux by the number of turns of the coil...|$|R
40|$|D. Ing. Changes in the {{preferred}} technologies used in modem switched mode power supplies {{are driven by}} {{the need for a}} decrease in cost of manufacturing while maintaining the highest possible power density. Modem materials allow smaller components to be manufactured without affecting their electromagnetic properties but thermal problems still impair efforts to further reduce their size. Increased switching frequencies cause increased conductor and core losses in magnetic components such as inductors and transformers. Amongst other advantages the increased surface area of low-profile planar structures allow better removal of the heat generated in the component and this work reevaluates conductor optimization for specific planar inductor windings. Conductor optimization has been a topic thoroughly investigated over the last few decades and these techniques have been adopted for planar winding design. It will be shown that the process involved in the manufacturing of helical planar windings allows further exploitation of the basic optimization process. A per-layer optimization technique, earlier proposed by other researchers and deemed impractical at the time, is revised and it is shown here that it can be successfully implemented in the chosen winding type. The per-layer optimization is also extended to accommodate non-sinusoidal current waveforms in this work. Other facets of loss reduction are also addressed. Windings are shaped in the region of air gaps in magnetic circuits to reduce the losses caused by the fringing <b>flux</b> intersecting the <b>conductors</b> but since the shaping influences both the ac-resistance and dc-resistance of the winding an optimization process is required to find the optimal conductor arrangement. Contributions are made with regard to speeding up the process of finding the optimal layout of conductors around the air gap by devising a simple model for the flux distribution of the fringing flux. The effect of combining the per-layer optimization technique with these shaping techniques is exploited to its full potential in this work and contributes largely to loss reduction in helical inductor windings carrying currents containing ac- and dc components. The optimization time is reduced by allowing winding shaping while maintaining the dc-resistance of each layer. The optimal winding shape then becomes a function of the window constraints for a chosen core rather than finding it through conventional methods. Case studies, complete with FEM-simulations and experimental measurements, are offered in support of the proposed solutions. Manufacturing issues are dealt with and loss measurement techniques developed as part of this work...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to investigate the factors that enhance conductive anodic filament (CAF) formation in printed wiring boards. The variables studied were (1) <b>flux</b> formulation, (2) <b>conductor</b> spacing, (3) operating voltage, and (4) temperature. A Weibull distribution of failure times due to CAF was observed. A novel test circuit was designed and implemented that allowed the mean time to failure to be determined for boards processed with three different fluxes, at 0. 5 mm and 0. 75 mm conductor spacings and at 150 V and 200 V. The boards were aged at 85 %RH and a temperature of 75 Â°C, 85 Â°C or 95 Â°C. It was found that the flux formulation affected the rate of CAF formation. A modified linear aliphatic polyether flux with a chloride activator had a significantly different activation energy than control printed wiring boards or those boards processed with a poly(ethylene/propylene) glycol flux or a poly(ethylene/propylene) glycol flux with a bromide activator. The addition of bromine to a poly(ethylene/propylene) glycol flux decreased the rate of CAF formation as compared to poly(ethylene/propylene) glycol without a halide activator. The inter-relation between voltage and conductor spacing was quantified as a L 4 /V 2 relationship for the plated through hole test pattern used in this study. 325 V/mm was found to be a critical voltage gradient for the formation of CAF. The maximum temperature of the reflow profile also greatly enhances CAF formation and decreases the mean time to failure. Microscopic analysis showed distinct differences in CAF morphology between the various processed boards. Control boards had small halo-like CAF formations around a separated fiber / epoxy interface. CAF that formed on boards processed with poly(ethylene/propylene) glycol or poly(ethylene/propylene) glycol with a bromine activator had a stratified appearance that penetrated well into the epoxy. Boards that were processed with the modified linear aliphatic polyether with chlorine activator had a striated morphology that also penetrated into the epoxy. All CAFs were consistently copper and chlorine containing despite the use of a bromine containing flux. Electron diffraction revealed that a CAF observed in this study was synthetic atacamite. Stainless steel (i. e., iron, nickel, and chromium) residues were also observed as a result of drill bit breakage during PTH formation. Ph. D. Committee Chair: Laura J.
