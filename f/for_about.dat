5|$|Again, {{this is a}} simplification, {{based on}} a {{hypothetical}} Earth that orbits at uniform speed around the Sun. The actual speed with which Earth orbits the Sun varies slightly during the year, so {{the speed with which}} the Sun seems to move along the ecliptic also varies. For example, the Sun is north of the celestial equator <b>for</b> <b>about</b> 185 days of each year, and south of it <b>for</b> <b>about</b> 180 days. The variation of orbital speed accounts for part of the equation of time.|$|E

Since the rod did not fully extend, and the flag was tightly folded and packed during the journey, the flag ended up with a slightly wavy appearance, as if there were a breeze. Shortly after their flag planting, President Richard Nixon spoke to them by a telephone call from his office.

Our key insight {{is that we}} can avail of quantification while preserving SMT-based decidability, simply by encoding refinement parameters as uninterpreted propositions within the ground refinement logic. We illustrate how this simple mechanism yields a variety of sophisticated and automatic means <b>for</b> reasoning <b>about</b> programs, including: parametric refinements for reasoning with type classes, index-dependent refinements <b>for</b> reasoning <b>about</b> key-value maps, recursive refinements <b>for</b> reasoning <b>about</b> data structures, and inductive refinements <b>for</b> reasoning <b>about</b> higher-order traversal routines. We have implemented our approach in HSOLVE, a refinement type checker for Haskell, and present experiments using HSOLVE to verify correctness invariants of various programs. ...|$|R
