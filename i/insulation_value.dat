500|$|The fur {{of mammals}} has many uses protection, sensory purposes, waterproofing, and camouflage, {{with the primary}} usage being thermoregulation. The types of hair include definitive, which may be shed after {{reaching}} a certain length; vibrissae, which are sensory hairs and are most commonly whiskers; pelage, which consists of guard hairs, under-fur, and awn hair; spines, which are a type of stiff guard hair used for defense in, for example, porcupines; bristles, which are long hairs usually used in visual signals, such as the mane of a lion; velli, often called [...] "down fur," [...] which insulates newborn mammals; and wool which is long, soft and often curly. Hair length is negligible in thermoregulation, as some tropical mammals, such as sloths, have the same length of fur length as some arctic mammals but with less insulation; and, conversely, other tropical mammals with short hair have the same insulating value as arctic mammals.

The different clothing ensembles’ insulations were determined by 1 : measurement using adultsized versions of the clothing on thermal manikins, 2 : estimations from adult clothing data obtained from the standards tables in ISO 9920 and ASHRAE 55, and 3 : calculations using a regression equation from McCullough et al. (1985) that was adapted to accommodate children’s sizes for ages 6 e 17 years. Values for the clothing area factor, fcl, were also determined by measurement and by using a prediction equation from ISO 9920. Results in this study suggested that the clothing <b>insulation</b> <b>values</b> found from the measured and adapted data were similar to the adult’s data in standards tables for the same summer and winter seasons. Further, the effect of the <b>insulation</b> <b>values</b> on the different scholars’ age groups were investigated using the clothing temperature rating technique and compared to the scholars’ comfort temperature found in recent field studies. Results showed that the temperature ratings of the clothing using the three methods described above are close and in agreement with the scholars’ comfort temperature. Though estimated and measured fcl data differed, the impact on the temperature ratings was limited. An observed secular change in the children’s heights and weights in the last few decades implies that, for adolescents, the children’s body surface areas {{are similar to those of}} adults, making the use of adult clothing tables even more acceptable. In conclusion, this study gives some evidence to support the applicability of using adults’ data in ASHRAE 55 and ISO 9920 standards to assess the thermal <b>insulation</b> <b>values</b> of different children’s clothing ensembles, provided that careful selection of the garments, ensembles material and design takes place...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the main}} goals of {{building}} acoustics is the prediction of airborne sound insulation between rooms to determine the quality of sound protection. In many practical cases, however, the objective measures of the airborne sound insulation using procedures in standards are not {{in agreement with the}} subjective assessment. This paper, therefore, after reviewing the conventional model to calculate airborne sound insulation, introduces a calculation scheme based on loudness level linked with specific fluctuation strength, yielding a weighted normalised loudness level difference, Lnor,w. By analysing the difference between standard airborne sound <b>insulation</b> <b>values</b> and the introduced weighted normalised loudness level difference, it is revealed that the sound pressure level that is transmitted through a partition decreases with increasing frequency, and this is independent of the type of signal and of the airborne sound <b>insulation</b> <b>values</b> (View the MathML source-values), whereas if the transmitted signal is converted into a loudness level, it tends to rise with increasing frequency. Moreover, it is found that, whereas a simple level difference does not exhibit the effect of a given signal to the frequency-dependent airborne sound insulation curve, using Lnor,w, a significant change can be observed, in terms of both computed and measured results. Furthermore, the frequency-dependent results allow more details to be investigated for a certain sound insulation. A comparison between the measured and predicted airborne sound insulation with no obvious malfunction suggests that at some frequency ranges, a hypothetical subjective related failure might occur. Overall, the proposed Lnor,w could reveal detailed insights into the in situ measured airborne sound insulation compared with standard airborne sound <b>insulation</b> <b>values.</b> The frequency-dependent values discussed in this paper form a basis for developing a single-number index...|$|R
