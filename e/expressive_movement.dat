60|$|Erection of the dermal appendages.--Hardly any <b>expressive</b> <b>movement</b> is so {{general as}} the {{involuntary}} erection of the hairs, feathers and other dermal appendages; {{for it is}} common throughout three of the great vertebrate classes. These appendages are erected under the excitement of anger or terror; more especially when these emotions are combined, or quickly succeed each other. The action serves to make the animal appear larger and more frightful to its enemies or rivals, and is generally accompanied by various voluntary movements adapted for the same purpose, and by the utterance of savage sounds. Mr. Bartlett, who has had such wide experience with animals of all kinds, does not doubt {{that this is the}} case; but it is a different question whether the power of erection was primarily acquired for this special purpose.|$|E

40|$|Spatial bodily {{movements}} are extremely suitable as a design technique, because our body conveys emotions and expression, {{as well as}} geometry and (inter) actions. Moreover, these movements can stimulate the creative process. The computer could play an interesting and powerful role to amplify this technique.

If a computer wants {{to make sense of}} a designer expressing his ideas with <b>expressive</b> <b>movements,</b> it desperately needs guidelines to interpret and capture the essence of these movements. As a first step to formulate these guidelines, we tested the suitability, subtlety and expressiveness of spatial bodily <b>movements</b> to capture <b>expressive</b> design ideas. Moreover, the premise is tested that outsiders, more specifically designers, are able to pick up the expression of bodily movements. Our findings support the potential of a gestural design tool. Results show that there is no significant difference between sketching and gesturing. Moreover, an interpreter was able to capture the expression when looking at the gestures...|$|R
40|$|Currently {{little is}} known about the brain {{dynamics}} and <b>expressive</b> <b>movements</b> that support musical engagement. We hypothesize that repetitive expressive gestures play an important role in inviting musical engagement in listeners, and that these movements can reveal the feelings experienced by the listener. Furthermore, we hypothesize that brain dynamics supporting these <b>expressive</b> <b>movements</b> play a key role in musical engagement. We trained expert and non-expert participants to communicate the feeling of music they are hearing using simple rhythmic U-shaped hand /arm "conducting" gestures that animate the 2 -D movement of a spot of light on a video display while we use body motion capture and EEG to record their movements and brain activity. Periodically we introduced a "not engaged" condition during which a distractor task impedes the participant's engagement in the engaged listening task. We then asked viewers to rate the recorded 2 -D spot animations of the recorded gestures on a musical emotion rating scale to test to what extent the musical affective experience of the "conductors" can be conveyed by these animations to viewers who do not hear the music. The ratings from the conductor and viewer groups were well correlated, verifying that the affective intent of the conductors' gestures are experienced by viewers. Statistically significant differences were found in the motion capture and EEG data between the fully engaged condition and the not-engaged condition. A comparison of the EEG data recorded during the two conditions revealed low alpha- and theta-synchronization in the parietal- temporaloccipital (PTO) junction which was specific to the engaged condition, and time-locked to the participants' <b>expressive</b> <b>movements.</b> The results from the viewer experiment suggest that the feeling intention of the expressive gesture task is communicable through a single point-light display, and that viewers can distinguish engaged performances from not-engaged performances. Our EEG results suggest that brain dynamics supporting engaged music listening, located at the PTO junction, are co- modulated with the <b>expressive,</b> rhythmic <b>movements</b> made by the listener. The fact that we can non-invasively monitor musical engagement gives us a useful and general tool for music perception research, with possible wider applications to music classification, technology, and therap...|$|R

40|$|Since {{people often}} {{communicate}} internal states and intentions through movement, robots can better interact with humans if they too can modify their movements to communicate changing state. These movements, {{which may be}} seen as supplementary to those required for workspace tasks, may be termed “expressive. ” However, robot hardware, which cannot recreate the same range of dynamics as human limbs, often limit expressive capacity. One solution is to augment <b>expressive</b> robotic <b>movement</b> with <b>expressive</b> sound. To that end, this paper presents an application for synthesizing sounds that match various movement qualities. Its design is based on an empirical study analyzing sound and movement qualities, where movement qualities are parametrized according to Laban’s Effort System. Our results suggests a number of correspondences between movement qualities and sound qualities. These correspondences are presented here and discussed within the context of designing movement-quality-to-sound-quality mappings in our sound synthesis application. This application will be used in future work testing user perceptions of <b>expressive</b> <b>movements</b> with synchronous sounds...|$|R

5000|$|A {{significant}} influence {{on the development of}} the 'system' came from Stanislavski's experience teaching and directing at his Opera Studio, which was founded in 1918.

40|$|Current {{methods for}} figure {{animation}} involve a tradeoff between {{the level of}} realism captured in the movements and the ease of generating the animations. We introduce a motion control paradigm that circumvents this tradeoff—it provides the ability to generate {{a wide range of}} natural-looking movements with minimal user labor. ^ Effort, which is one part of Rudolf Laban 2 ̆ 7 s system for observing and analyzing movement, describes the qualitative aspects of movement. Our motion control paradigm simplifies the generation of <b>expressive</b> <b>movements</b> by proceduralizing these qualitative aspects to hide the non-intuitive, quantitative aspects of movement. We build a model of Effort using a set of kinematic movement parameters that defines how a figure moves between goal keypoints. Our motion control scheme provides control through Effort 2 ̆ 7 s four-dimensional system of textual descriptors, providing a level of control thus far missing from behavioral animation systems and offering novel specification and editing capabilities on top of traditional keyframing and inverse kinematics methods. Since our Effort model is inexpensive computationally, Effort-based motion control systems can work in real-time. ^ We demonstrate our motion control scheme by implementing EMOTE (Expressive MOTion Engine), a character animation module for <b>expressive</b> arm <b>movements.</b> EMOTE works with inverse kinematics to control the qualitative aspects of end-effector specified movements. The user specifies general movements by entering a sequence of goal positions for each hand. The user then expresses the essence of the movement by adjusting sliders for the Effort motion factors: Space, Weight, Time, and Flow. EMOTE produces a wide range of <b>expressive</b> <b>movements,</b> provides an easy-to-use interface (that is more intuitive than joint angle interpolation curves or physical parameters), features interactive editing, and real-time motion generation. ...|$|R
