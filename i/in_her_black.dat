5|$|In her car, {{she packed}} clothing, toiletries, college textbooks, and birth-control pills. When her room was searched later, campus police {{discovered}} {{most of her}} belongings packed in boxes and the art removed from the walls. It's not clear whether Murray packed them that day, but police at the time asserted she'd packed between Sunday night and Monday morning. On top of the boxes was a printed email to Murray's boyfriend indicating trouble in their relationship. Around 3:30 pm, she drove off the campus <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>black</b> 1996 Saturn sedan; classes at the university had been canceled that day due to a snowstorm.|$|E
500|$|Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe {{described}} Jenny stating: [...] "Dreary, confused, introverted narcissist [...] downcast, secretive, almost Goth <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>black</b> moodiness, she is {{the epitome}} of an unhappy egotist. She is so consumed with {{the ups and downs of}} her own depression and self-loathing, she just doesn't have the energy to look outward. Her misery is her mirror, and she's forever gazing into it." [...] New York Magazine describe Jenny as a capricious yet obnoxious type of character adding that she can be patronizing. They also observe her as looking [...] "fabulous, fun, and sexy but her downfall is her annoying side." [...] Diane Shipley of The Guardian branded Jenny a [...] "whiny egomaniac". Lesbian magazine Curve brands Jenny a [...] "narcissistic navel-gazer".|$|E
2500|$|Her outfit in Bayonetta 2 {{was again}} {{designed}} by Shimazaki. It was generally designed more around straight lines than curves. All her jewelry and accessories were designed around this initiative apart from her glasses. There was debate {{about where to}} show skin, {{but when it was}} decided to create a cape {{at the front of the}} outfit, the front of her outfit was closed and instead they opted to show a large area of her back. For her new look, blue became a key color as opposed to the first game, where it was red: this was because water was a key theme for the second game and Hashimoto requested blue to become the design's key color. This eventually proved difficult as, combined with the black and silver incorporated into her outfit and the game's general color palette, it did not have the sharp qualities of her former appearance. Shimazaki described trying to make her stand out <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>black</b> outfit as [...] "a nightmare". Her overall design theme was [...] "solid". The character's hairstyle underwent a major redesign. Hashimoto's main reason behind this was that [...] " [...] personality is the type that would not want to remain stagnant. She would want to change her style, taste in fashion, and her costumes. Down the line in the series, she may make further changes to her appearance." [...] The texture of her outfit was designed to appear similar to leather, despite it still being made from her hair. Her new guns, Love is Blue, were also difficult to design, as making them too large or too similar in color to other elements of Bayonetta's outfit would not have fitted her. In the end, they were made a more striking shade of blue, as well as being given some gold to match Bayonetta's chestpiece and a silver sheen. Each of the guns, Night, Jealous, Eye and Life, were given antique charms adorned with flower designs and named according to their color and the ideas they evoked to further promote and augment the new look.|$|E

60|$|A single unfortunate {{phrase of}} Kirk's, spoken in haste, but remembered at leisure, {{formed the basis}} of this uncertainty. That {{afternoon}} when he had left her he had said that Mamie was the real mother of the child. Could it be that Mamie's undeviating devotion to the boy had won the love which she had lost?
