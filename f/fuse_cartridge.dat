The company moved to its current facilities established at Werkhofstrasse 8 in 1948. The company was transformed into a limited liability company in 1949. In 1964 the company had grown to 194 employees. By 1968, component sales amounted to two-thirds of Schurter's business due to increasing exports. Hienrich Schurter died that year.

From the experimental results, the fuse element was melted and scattered by applied surge current(above 0. 79 kA) and overload current(above 4. 5 A). It was also attached to the inner surface of the fuse tube. The fuse element was attached as a thin film on inner sur-face of fuse tube when large surge current was applied.

One form of fuse box abuse was to put a penny in the socket, which defeated overcurrent protection and resulted in a dangerous condition.

50|$|It {{started off}} as Gun Carriage Agency, but after {{shifting}} {{of the agency}} first to Allahabad in 1814, and then to Fatehgarh in 1816, its importance was diminished. Finally in 1829, all the machines were shifted to Fatehgarh. However, it had the strength of springing back to life again and again. The vacant space was utilised for the much-needed expansion and renovation of the Gun Factory of Fort William. Besides casting of brass guns, it also took up manufacture of iron shot and shells. Around 1855, breech-loading steel rifled guns had got {{its way to the}} British arsenal, but the Cossipore plant was not properly equipped to undertake manufacturing of such guns. The mini-bullet factory was transferred to Dumdum. It had little work and there were suggestions for its closure but it survived. The rifled guns, imported from England, required new elongated shells. It was decided that Cossipore would be utilised for manufacturing of the new shells. It underwent some expansion and the name ‘Gun Foundry’ was changed to ‘Foundry and Shell Factory’ in 1872. Along with the manufacturing of new elongated shell, there was requirement of undertaking manufacturing of modern <b>fuses</b> and <b>cartridges</b> to match the newly introduced breech-loading guns. So further expansion took place in 1887 and 1890. In 1892, steel was, for the first time cast in India, at Cossipore by a Siemen’s Martin Open Hearth Plant. In 1896, a rolling mill was erected. However, the metallurgical units were shifted to Ishapore in 1903 as no further space for expansion was available at Cossipore. In 1890, a shop was erected for the manufacture and repair of fittings of imported breech-loading guns. The plant undertook the manufacture of quick-firing guns in 1905. With the return of the manufacturing of guns, the name of Cossipore unit got the present name of ‘Gun and Shell Factory’ in 1905.|$|R

Around 1896 with his business in machinery progressing, Hubbell's next patent was a major breakthrough in the fastener industry: the process and machinery for cold rolled screw threads which reduced the rate of material lost in production by more than 50%. He designed and built progressive blanking and forming dies, patented machinery to slot screw heads, a machine to assemble screws and small parts, devised tools to indicate speed, and patented a changeable speed screwdriver. Hubbell's idea was to provide convenience, safety, and control to an electric light with his new [...] "pull socket" [...] which was patented in August 1896. The same familiar device with its on/off pull chain is still in use today. He built three prototypes by hand using metal and insulated wood parts to design a product with individual wires permanently attached in the proper sequence and correct polarity, and one which could be connected or disconnected, easily and safely, to a power supply in the wall. <b>cartridge</b> <b>fuses</b> and fuse block, lamp holders, key sockets - soon followed the same path Later, Hubbell's [...] "separable plug" [...] design took shape on the drawing board back in Bridgeport, and then submitted to the patent office in Washington, D.C. Additional designs based on that basic concept - separable plugs in different configurations, a single flush mounted receptacle - as well as new products for electrical circuits. One of the most successful and the one most familiar today, was the duplex receptacle which is still found everywhere that electrical power is used. In 1901 Hubbell published a 12-page catalogue that listed 63 electrical products of his company's manufacture, and four years later he incorporated his enterprise as Harvey Hubbell, Incorporated , In the same year, the Company registered its trademark of [...] "...a sphere with meridian lines and the name 'Hubbell' centered within." [...] Hubbell's pace of new ideas and product design did not falter. In 1909 the company began constructing a four-floor factory and office building that woul d become the first building in New England made of reinforced concrete.|$|R
