25|$|From {{the end of}} the Great Depression {{until the}} early 1970s, Keynesian {{economics}} provided the main inspiration for economic policy makers in Western industrialized countries. The influence of Keynes's theories waned in the 1970s, due to stagflation and critiques from Friedrich Hayek, Milton Friedman, Robert Lucas, Jr. and other economists, who were less optimistic about the ability of interventionist government policy to positively regulate the economy or otherwise opposed to Keynesian policies. From the early 1980s to 2008, the normative consensus among economists was that attempts at fiscal stimulus would be ineffective even <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>recession,</b> and such policies were only occasionally employed by the governments of developed countries.|$|E
25|$|The JG thus fulfils an {{absorption}} {{function to}} minimise the real {{costs associated with}} the flux of the private sector. When private sector employment declines, public sector employment will automatically react and increase its payrolls. So <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>recession,</b> the increase in public employment will increase net government spending, and stimulate aggregate demand and the economy. Conversely, in a boom, the decline of public sector employment and spending caused by workers leaving their JG jobs for higher paid private sector employment will lessen stimulation, so the JG functions as an automatic stabilizer controlling inflation. The nation always remains fully employed, with a changing mix between private and public sector employment. Since the JG wage is open to everyone, it will functionally become the national minimum wage.|$|E

25|$|In his 2009 book The Keynes Solution, post-Keynesian {{economist}} Paul Davidson makes another historical {{case for}} the effectiveness of Keynesian policy, referring {{to the experience of}} the United States during the Great Depression. He notes how economic growth and employment levels increased for four successive years as the New Deal policies were pursued by President Roosevelt. When government spending was cut back in 1937 due to concerns about the budget deficit, all the gains were lost in one year, and growth only resumed after spending increased again from 1938, as a response to growing acceptance of deficit spending <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>recession</b> and later due to World War II. For Davidson, this experience validates the view that Keynesian policy has the power to deliver full employment and prosperity for a government's entire labor force. Davidson also wrote that both price stability and employment in the Keynesian age were superior even to the classical gold standard era that was terminated by World War I.|$|E
500|$|If {{businesses}} provided {{employees with}} gross pay (including income tax withholding and the employee share of payroll taxes), Arduin, Laffer & Moore Econometrics estimated production costs could decrease by {{a minimum of}} 11.55% (partial accommodation).

This decrease would offset a portion of the FairTax amount reflected in retail prices, which proponents suggest as the most likely scenario.
