25|$|In the laboratory, {{anhydrous}} {{sodium sulfate}} {{is widely used}} as an inert <b>drying</b> <b>agent,</b> for removing traces of water from organic solutions. It is more efficient, but slower-acting, than the similar agent magnesium sulfate. It is only effective below about 30°C, {{but it can be}} used with a variety of materials since it is chemically fairly inert. Sodium sulfate is added to the solution until the crystals no longer clump together; the two video clips (see above) demonstrate how the crystals clump when still wet, but some crystals flow freely once a sample is dry.|$|E

40|$|Dry sex' {{refers to}} the {{preference}} for a dry, tight vagina during sexual intercourse. Women in Zimbabwe and elsewhere {{have been found to}} use a variety of <b>drying</b> <b>agents</b> to achieve these effects. Previous studies of 'dry sex' have concentrated on documentation of the practice and investigation of any associated increased risk of HIV. In contrast, this study examines the impact of 'dry sex' on condom use and effectiveness. Focus group interviews were held with female HIV/AIDS peer educators in Zimbabwe who had a history of commercial sex work. Participants reported that <b>drying</b> <b>agents</b> had physical and psychological consequences. That is, agents were said to dry and tighten a woman's vagina, and also to serve as 'love potions' to attract sexual partners and ensure their faithfulness. Although vaginal dryness was not found to deter the use of condoms, some women were reluctant to use condoms for fear of blocking the 'magic' of <b>drying</b> <b>agents.</b> There was agreement among participants that condoms frequently broke when used in conjunction with <b>drying</b> <b>agents.</b> Participants primarily attributed condom breakage to excessive vaginal tightness. Lubricants were not routinely used during sex or with condoms. However, participants preferred the use of lubricated condoms when they used condoms. Implications of the 'dry sex' practice for AIDS prevention programs and development of new HIV prevention technologies are discussed. vagina condom Africa HIV AIDS...|$|R
25|$|In 1867 {{the company}} {{incurred}} financial losses {{from a bad}} investment in the United Kingdom and declining demand for its products. In the same year Julius Vorster Jr., {{the son of the}} founder Julius Vorster, became involved in the management of the company. On his recommendation the company began to produce magnesium sulfate {{in order to reduce the}} losses. Magnesium sulfate was primarily intended for the export to the United Kingdom, where it was used as a <b>drying</b> <b>agent</b> in the textile industry. The new product and an improving market for potassium nitrate helped the company to overcome the financial crisis in 1870. In 1871 the potassium chloride factory in Staßfurt was closed. On October 1, 1875 the second son of Vorster, the chemist Fritz Vorster joined the company as technical director. After the death of the founder Julius Vorster on October 10, 1876, the new owners converted the company into a limited partnership (Kommanditgesellschaft).|$|E
2500|$|Because of its low {{solubility}} in water and hygroscopic properties, MgCO3 was first added to salt in 1911 to make it flow more freely. The Morton Salt company adopted the slogan [...] "When it rains it pours" [...] {{with reference to the}} fact that its MgCO3-containing salt would not stick together in humid weather. Magnesium carbonate, most often referred to as 'chalk', is also used as a <b>drying</b> <b>agent</b> on athletes' palms in rock climbing, gymnastics and weight lifting.|$|E
2500|$|The {{primary use}} of {{magnesium}} carbonate is {{the production of}} magnesium oxide by calcining. Magnesite and dolomite minerals are used to produce refractory bricks. [...] MgCO3 is also used in flooring, fireproofing, fire extinguishing compositions, cosmetics, dusting powder, and toothpaste. [...] Other applications are as filler material, smoke suppressant in plastics, a reinforcing agent in neoprene rubber, a <b>drying</b> <b>agent,</b> a laxative to loosen the bowels, and color retention in foods. In addition, high purity magnesium carbonate is used as antacid and as an additive in table salt to keep it free flowing.|$|E

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis discusses firefighting {{and the use}} {{of portable}} fireextinguishers in the salvage of historic artefacts focusing on textiles.. It also looks into the use of multi-purpose dry chemical extinguishers in a textile context and the impact the actual dry-agent has on textiles after firefighting. Literature studies, interviews and tests on different textiles were carried out to write this thesis. During the tests textiles were exposed to the <b>dry</b> <b>agent</b> and also to <b>dry</b> <b>agent</b> plus water to investigate the difference in residue. After vacuumcleaning it was clear that when the textile was exposed to <b>dry</b> <b>agent</b> and water it was almost impossible to remove the chemical without rinsing in water. By examining the residue left on the textile using SEM it was possible to see if a textile was as well decontaminated after vacuum-cleaning as it looks to the eye. We know that the <b>dry</b> <b>agent</b> often consists of ammonium phosphate which acts corrosively on many materials and one can assume it damages textiles as well after longer exposure. Buildings housing cultural collections are vulnerable as we cannot easily replace ruined material with new. Everybody involved in the care of historically important objects must have a plan on how to react if there is a fire and in the salvaging after a catastrophe. The damage can be greatly reduced if knowledge is spread and people are informed on how to behave in case of a disaster. Not only the fire but also the way we put it out will have a huge impact on textiles...|$|R
2500|$|If the {{azeotrope}} is {{not considered}} sufficiently pure for use, there exist some techniques to break the azeotrope to give a pure distillate. This set of techniques are known as azeotropic distillation. Some techniques achieve this by [...] "jumping" [...] over the azeotropic composition (by adding another component {{to create a new}} azeotrope, or by varying the pressure). Others work by chemically or physically removing or sequestering the impurity. For example, to purify ethanol beyond 95%, a <b>drying</b> <b>agent</b> (or desiccant, such as potassium carbonate) can be added to convert the soluble water into insoluble water of crystallization. Molecular sieves are often used for this purpose as well.|$|E
2500|$|Most climbers {{choose to}} wear {{specialized}} rubber climbing shoes {{which are often}} of a smaller size than their normal street shoes {{in order to improve}} sensitivity towards foot placements and use the tightness to their advantage. [...] Climbing chalk (MgCO3) is commonly used as a <b>drying</b> <b>agent</b> to minimize sweating of the hands. Most other equipment is of a protective nature. Rock climbing is inherently dangerous, so to minimize the potential consequences resulting from a fall, climbers use protection. The most basic protective equipment is a climbing rope. Climbing [...] would attach the rope to themselves; {{in the event of a}} fall, the rope would usually cause injury to the climber in the hope that it prevented death. With advances in technology came the development of specialized harnesses, carabiners which are used for clipping into belay and rappel anchors and connecting gear, and belay devices which are used to catch a falling climber, hold or lower a climber and for rappelling. Eventually, the placement of bolts with the use of quickdraws led to the rise of sport climbing. Traditional climbers developed the spring-loaded camming device, which increased safety over chocks, hexes, and pitons. Some climbers choose to wear a specialized climbing helmet to protect them from falling rocks or equipment or head injuries from crashing into rocks.|$|E

50|$|The {{drying process}} is {{accelerated}} by certain metal salts, especially derivatives of cobalt, manganese, or iron. In technical terms, these oil <b>drying</b> <b>agents</b> are coordination complexes that function as homogeneous catalysts. These salts {{are derived from}} the carboxylates of lipophilic carboxylic acids, such as naphthenic acids to make the complexes oil-soluble. These catalysts speed up {{the reduction of the}} hydroperoxide intermediates. A series of addition reactions ensues. Each step produces additional free radicals, which then engage in further crosslinking. The process finally terminates when pairs of free radicals combine. The polymerization occurs over a period of days to years and renders the film dry to the touch. Premature action of the <b>drying</b> <b>agents</b> causes skinning of the paint, this undesirable process is suppressed by the addition of antiskinning agents such as methylethyl ketone oxime, which evaporate when the paint/oil is applied to a surface.|$|R
50|$|The {{reactants}} are {{in principle}} in equilibrium with the product, and water may be removed via an added <b>drying</b> <b>agent</b> or by azeotropic distillation. In practice, {{the reaction of}} the salicylaldehyde with the amine in alcoholic solvent usually goes to completion.|$|E
50|$|Calcium hydride is the {{chemical}} compound with the formula CaH2, {{and is therefore}} an alkaline earth hydride. This grey powder (white if pure, which is rare) reacts vigorously with water liberating hydrogen gas. CaH2 is thus used as a <b>drying</b> <b>agent,</b> i.e. a desiccant.|$|E
50|$|Lead (lead naphthenate) {{was added}} as a <b>drying</b> <b>agent</b> to {{some types of}} paint to ensure the paint surface hardened.
