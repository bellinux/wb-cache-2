5|$|A major {{accomplishment}} of the Johnson administration was {{the passage of}} a legislative redistricting bill. Despite the fact that the U.S. Constitution requires redistricting after every decennial census, Kentucky's legislative districts had remained virtually unchanged between 1893 and 1941. He asked the 1942 legislative session to adjourn early so <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>call</b> a special session {{for the sole purpose of}} considering a redistricting bill. The legislators obliged, and passed a bill by the end of the special session.|$|E
5|$|On 12 April 1798 the British {{blockade}} fleet {{under the}} command of Admiral Lord Bridport sailed from its winter anchorage at St Helens on the Isle of Wight for the Breton coast. Bridport mustered ten ships of the line to maintain the watch on Brest, although detachments of the fleet had been cruising in the region since 25 January and with notice <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>call</b> on 28 ships of the line. The French fleet had suffered a series of setbacks {{in the early years of}} the war: in addition to the losses at Groix, seven ships had been lost at the Glorious First of June in 1795 and more were wrecked during the failed Croisière du Grand Hiver operation of 1795 and the Expédition d'Irlande in 1796. To replenish these losses, the French Navy was building new ships at its major fleet bases and in April 1798 a ship had been commissioned at Lorient: the Hercule, a 74-gun ship of 1,876 tons burthen launched in July 1797 and commanded by the experienced Captain Louis L'Héritier, veteran of the Glorious First of June, and with a crew of 680, 20 short of a full complement.|$|E
25|$|In 1690 {{the main}} theatre of the Nine Years' War {{moved to the}} Spanish Netherlands. Command of French forces now passed to the talented Marshal Luxembourg (a {{position}} he would keep {{until his death in}} 1695), superseding Marshal Humières who had suffered defeat at the Battle of Walcourt the previous year. Luxembourg's army consisted of 34 battalions and 94 squadrons; if necessary <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>call</b> upon support from Marshal Boufflers’ forces on the Moselle.|$|E

25|$|Abdul Rahman's son planned {{from there}} to move from city to city, fortifying as they went, and if Charles wished {{to stop them from}} making a {{permanent}} enclave for expansion of the Caliphate, he would have to come to them, in the open, where, he, unlike his father, would dictate the place of battle. All worked as he had planned, until Charles arrived, albeit more swiftly than the Moors believed <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>call</b> up his entire army. Unfortunately for Rahman's son, however, he had overestimated the time it would take Charles to develop heavy cavalry equal to that of the Muslims.|$|E
25|$|On {{the night}} of 22 April, Napoleon {{instructed}} Bessières to advance with Lieutenant General Karl Philipp von Wrede's Bavarian division from the VII Corps, General of Division Gabriel Jean Joseph Molitor's French infantry division from the IV Corps, and General of Brigade Jacob François Marulaz's IV Corps cavalry division. The emperor planned for the pursuit to cross the Inn and capture Braunau am Inn. On the 24th, Napoleon ordered Marshal François Joseph Lefebvre, the commander of VII Corps, to take the division of Lieutenant General the Crown Prince of Bavaria to recapture Munich from Jellacic. If necessary, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>call</b> on Lieutenant General Deroy's Bavarian division also. Bessières, with Wrede's division, reached Neumarkt-Sankt Veit on 22 April. From there he sent Marulaz to probe toward the Inn River.|$|E
25|$|January 1996: A {{listener}} from Penang {{called in}} {{during one of}} Patrick's show to relate his recent experience {{with a member of}} the police force. At a roadblock, a policeman had stopped him for allegedly drinking and driving, and asked for a bribe from the listener. When he said {{that he did not have}} money with him, the policeman allegedly told him that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>call</b> someone to bring him the money. When he said that he did not have a phone, the policeman allegedly offered him the use of his mobile phone. After the show, SAC Supian Amat lodged a police report against Patrick under the instruction of Rahim Noor, then the IGP of Malaysia, resulting in Patrick being called to the police station for interviews. The media went to town with this issue; famous local cartoonist Lat drew a satirical cartoon on the incident which was published in the New Straits Times.|$|E

For a time Æthelwold had a claim to be the most powerful ruler in England. Edward's apparent reluctance to engage him in battle may have been well founded.|$|E
500|$|After repaying his {{debts and}} {{recovering}} financially, but failing to obtain payment for his war of 1812 contract, Lyon solicited a federal appointment {{that would provide}} a salary and stability in his final years. [...] In 1820, President James Monroe, a friend and political supporter of Lyon's, appointed him United States factor to the Cherokee Nation in the Arkansas Territory. He again attempted to serve in Washington, D.C. by running for the Arkansas Territory's delegate seat in Congress against incumbent James Woodson Bates. [...] He narrowly lost the election {{to serve in the}} 17th Congress (1,081 to 1,020), and then unsuccessfully contested the result. Lyon wrote to the House that the governor of the territory and other officials refused to allow him to inspect ballots and returns, or to have a hearing where <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>call</b> witnesses. [...] As a result, Lyon was unable to gather proof to support his claim to the seat. [...] He withdrew his contest, and Bates continued to serve.|$|E
500|$|Historians have {{advanced}} various views as to why, even though Müller was {{generally regarded as}} the superior scholar, he lost to Williams. Beckerlegge suggests several possible factors: unlike Williams, Müller {{was known as a}} writer and translator rather than a teacher of Sanskrit, he did not have links to the East India Company or the Indian Civil Service that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>call</b> upon for supporters, and he had not been educated at Oxford. In his obituary of Müller, Arthur Macdonell (Boden professor 1899–1926) said that the election [...] "came to turn on the political and religious opinions of the candidates rather than on their merits as Sanskrit scholars", adding that [...] "party feeling ran high and large numbers came up to vote." [...] Similarly, Dowling has written that [...] "in the less cosmopolitan precincts outside Oxford... the argument that Müller was 'not English' told heavily against him" [...] since [...] "the argument was (and was meant to be, of course) unanswerable." [...] She adds that Tories opposed him for his liberal political views, traditionalist factions within Oxford rejected [...] "Germanizing" [...] reform, and [...] "the Anglican clergy... detected unbelief lurking in his umlaut". The American historian Marjorie Wheeler-Barclay takes the view that the three motives for people voting against Müller cannot be disentangled. Those who supported Indian missionary work, Dowling writes, saw it as the key to continued British rule, and {{there was no need to}} take a chance by electing Müller, who had [...] "a reputation for unsound religious opinions", since Williams was a scholar [...] "of distinction known for his conservatism and piety." ...|$|E

There was never an answer, though once he thought he heard a bubbling scream from the dun waters sliding past. Then the storm broke, and he returned to the house drenched and dejected.|$|R

500|$|Presiding {{over the}} trial was Sir William Chapple, a senior and {{respected}} judge in his early sixties. [...] The prosecution was directed by King's Counsel Thomas Place and Richard Crowle (brother of George), and proceedings were recorded by a York resident, Thomas Kyll. [...] Turpin had no defence barrister; {{during this period of}} English history, those accused had no right to legal representation, and their interests were cared for by the presiding judge. [...] Among the seven witnesses called to testify were Thomas Creasy, and James Smith, the man who had recognised Turpin's handwriting. [...] Turpin offered {{little in the way of}} questioning his accusers; when asked if he had anything to ask of Creasy, he replied [...] "I cannot say anything, for I have not any witnesses come this day, as I have expected, and therefore beg of your Lordship to put off my trial 'till another day", and when asked about Smith, he claimed not to know him. [...] When questioned himself, Turpin told the court that he had bought the mare and foal from an inn-keeper near Heckington. [...] He repeated his original story of how he had come to use the pseudonym Palmer, claiming that it was his mother's maiden name. [...] When asked by the judge for his name before he came to Lincolnshire, he said [...] "Turpin". [...] Without leaving the courtroom the jury found Turpin guilty of the first charge of stealing the mare and foal, and following further proceedings, guilty of stealing the gelding. [...] Throughout the trial Turpin had repeatedly claimed that he had not been allowed enough time to form his defence, that proceedings should be delayed until <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>call</b> his witnesses, and that the trial should be held at Essex. [...] Before sentencing him, the judge asked Turpin if he could offer any reason why he should not be sentenced to death; Turpin said: [...] "It is very hard upon me, my Lord, because I was not prepar'd for my Defence." [...] The judge replied: [...] "Why was you not? [...] You knew the Time of the Assizes as well as any Person here." [...] Despite Turpin's pleas that he had been told the trial would be held in Essex, the judge replied: [...] "Whoever told you so were highly to blame; and as your country have found you guilty of a crime worthy of death, it is my office to pronounce sentence against you", sentencing him to death.|$|E

2500|$|Shakespeare for Berlioz {{represented}} {{the summit of}} poetic utterance, with the bard's veracity of dramatic expression and freedom from formal constraints resounding in the composer's spirit. More profoundly, Shakespeare became a source, by way of its dramatic truth, for Berlioz' fundamental notion of expressive truth; this was how <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>call</b> Romeo and Juliet [...] "the supreme drama of my life." [...] He read from the plays constantly, often aloud for anyone who would listen.

2500|$|This was {{the core}} of {{veterans}} who served {{with him on a}} permanent basis, and as Hanson says, [...] "provided a steady supply of dependable troops year around." [...] While other Germanic cultures, such as the Visigoths or Vandals, had a proud martial tradition, and the Franks themselves had an annual muster of military aged men, such tribes were only able to field armies around planting and harvest. It was Charles' creation of a system whereby <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>call</b> on troops year round that gave the Carolingians the first standing and permanent army since Rome's fall in the west.|$|E
2500|$|Fronto {{returned}} to his Roman townhouse at dawn on 28 March, having left his home in Cirta as soon as news of his pupils' accession reached him. He sent a note to the imperial freedman Charilas, asking if <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>call</b> on the emperors. Fronto would later explain {{that he had not}} dared to write the emperors directly. The tutor was immensely proud of his students. Reflecting on the speech he had written on taking his consulship in 143, when he had praised the young Marcus, Fronto was ebullient: [...] "There was then an outstanding natural ability in you; there is now perfected excellence. There was then a crop of growing corn; there is now a ripe, gathered harvest. What I was hoping for then, I have now. The hope has become a reality." [...] Fronto called on Marcus alone; neither thought to invite Lucius.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{box office}} success for The Lady Eve and The Miracle of Morgan's Creek, {{conflict}} with Paramount's studio bosses increased. In particular, executive producer Buddy DeSylva never really trusted his star writer-director and was wary (and arguably jealous) of the independence Sturges enjoyed on his projects. One {{of the sources of}} conflict was that Sturges liked to reuse many of the same character actors in his films, thus creating what amounted to a regular troupe <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>call</b> upon within the studio system. [...] Paramount feared that the audience would tire of repeatedly seeing the same faces in Sturges productions. But the director was adamant, stating, [...] "hese little players who had contributed so much to my first hits had a moral right to work in my subsequent pictures." [...] The way Sturges wrote and directed these actors created a succession of what film critic Andrew Sarris later called [...] "self-expressive cameos of aggressive individualism."> ...|$|E
