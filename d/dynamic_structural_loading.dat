40|$|A {{pilot study}} was {{conducted}} on a flapped semi-span model to investigate the concept and viability of near-wake vortex management by means of boundary layer separation control. Passive control was achieved using a simple fairing and active control was achieved via zero mass-flux blowing slots. Vortex sheet strength, estimated by integrating surface pressures, was used to predict vortex characteristics based on inviscid rollup relations and vortices trailing the flaps were mapped using a seven-hole probe. Separation control {{was found to have}} a marked effect on vortex location, strength, tangential velocity, axial velocity and size over a wide range of angles of attack and control conditions. In general, the vortex trends were well predicted by the inviscid rollup relations. Manipulation of the separated flow near the flap edges exerted significant control over either outboard or inboard edge vortices while producing small lift and moment excursions. Unsteady surface pressures indicated that dynamic separation and attachment control can be exploited to perturb vortices at wavelengths shorter than a typical wingspan. In summary, separation control has the potential for application to time-independent or time-dependent wake alleviation schemes, where the latter can be deployed to minimize adverse effects on ride-quality and <b>dynamic</b> <b>structural</b> <b>loading...</b>|$|E
30|$|The major {{barrier of}} {{implementing}} three RTS units {{lies in the}} cost of RTS. The price of a robotic total station is around 80 – 100 times the price of a camera. Therefore, this research is intended to model a moving object based on tracking a minimum quantity of dynamic control points on the object. As such, the reliable dimensional measurements at one particular moment can be obtained with the lowest equipment cost. In the current site testing, we had only two RTS units available; the problem definition is to measure sling lengths and their changes for a rigging system in order to ensure quality and safety. Hence implementing the “five point relative modeling” by use of two RTS was considered sufficient and cost effective in comparison with the “three point absolute modeling” using three RTS units; (3) analyzing <b>dynamic</b> <b>structural</b> <b>loading</b> effects based on real-time measurements of sling sagging magnitude, which can be made possible through photogrammetry modeling. As the sagging effect of a loose sling is ignored in the current study, the end-to-end length measurement gives only an approximation of the sling length. In fact, the photo-based approach allows direct modeling of the sagging effect on the sling. The determination of the exact sling length based on the end-to-end distance and the sagging effect will be investigated in the follow-up research.|$|E

40|$|On December 9 th 2009, the International Space Station (ISS) 2 A {{solar array}} mast {{experienced}} prolonged longeron shadowing during a Soyuz undocking. Analytical reconstruction of induced thermal and <b>dynamic</b> <b>structural</b> <b>loads</b> showed an exceedance of the mast buckling limit. Possible structural {{damage to the}} solar array mast could have occurred during this event. A Low fidelity video survey of the 2 A mast showed no obvious damage of the mast longerons or battens. The {{decision was made to}} conduct an on-orbit dynamic test of the 2 A array on December 18 th, 2009. The test included thruster pluming on the array while photogrammetry data was recorded. The test was similar to other Dedicated Thruster Firings (DTFs) that were performed to measure structural frequency and damping of a solar array. Results of the DTF indicated lower frequency mast modes than model predictions, thus leading to speculation of mast damage. A detailed nonlinear analysis was performed on the 2 A array model to assess possible solutions to modal differences. The setup of the parametric nonlinear trade study included the use of a detailed array model and the reduced mass and stiffness matrices of the entire ISS being applied to the array interface. The study revealed that the array attachment structure is nonlinear and thus was the source of error in the model prediction of mast modes. In addition, a detailed study was performed to determine mast mode sensitivity to mast longeron damage. This sensitivity study was performed to assess if the ISS program has sufficient instrumentation for mast damage detection...|$|R

40|$|Dynamic load due to gust for {{helicopter}} rotors directly {{affects the}} structural stress and flight performance. In case of gust, it may cause {{the loss of}} trust force or the increase of deflection for rotors. In current work, an effective coupled aeroelastic model based on a medium-deflection beam theory and a nonlinear unsteady aerodynamic model in the time domain were constructed. Three types of gust in vertical direction were added in the model. The <b>dynamic</b> response and <b>structural</b> <b>load</b> for helicopter rotors under three types of gust were calculated, respectively. Results indicated that when rotors suffer a gust in hover at downward direction, the thrust force on rotor disk would decrease significantly when the gust amplitude increases, which should be paid attention in the design. Among the three gust types with the same gust strength, the maximum instantaneous shear force due to impulse shape gust is the largest. When the rotors suffer a gust in a forward flight, the shear force {{at the root of}} rotors would increase with the gust strength first but then it decreases. More attention should be paid to the decrease of thrust force and the increase of <b>structural</b> <b>load</b> in a forward flight...|$|R

40|$|During a {{possible}} {{loss of coolant accident}} in BWRs, {{a large amount}} of steam will be released from the reactor pressure vessel to the suppression pool. Steam will be condensed into the suppression pool causing <b>dynamic</b> and <b>structural</b> <b>loads</b> to the pool. The formation and break up of bubbles can be measured by visual observation using a suitable pattern recognition algorithm. The aim {{of this study was to}} improve the preliminary pattern recognition algorithm, developed by Vesa Tans-kanen in his doctoral dissertation, by using MATLAB. Video material from the PPOOLEX test facility, recorded during thermal stratification and mixing exper-iments, was used as a reference in the development of the algorithm. The developed algorithm consists of two parts: the pattern recognition of the bubbles and the analysis of recognized bubble images. The bubble recognition works well, but some errors will appear due to the complex structure of the pool. The results of the image analysis were reasonable. The volume and the surface area of the bubbles were not evaluated. Chugging frequencies calculated by using FFT fitted well into the results of oscillation frequencies measured in the experiments. The pattern recognition algorithm works in the conditions it is designed for. If the measurement configuration will be changed, some modifications have to be done. Numerous improvements are proposed for the future 3 D equipment...|$|R

40|$|Wind {{turbines}} are complex, nonlinear, dynamic systems {{forced by}} aerodynamic, gravitational, centrifugal, and gyroscopic loads. The aerodynamics of wind turbines are nonlinear, unsteady, and complex. Turbine rotors {{are subjected to}} a complicated 3 -D turbulent wind inflow field, with imbedded coherent vortices that drive fatigue loads and reduce lifetime. Design of control algorithms for wind turbines must account for multiple control objectives. Future large multi-megawatt turbines must be designed with lighter weight structures, using active controls to mitigate fatigue loads, while maximizing energy capture. Active damping should be added to these dynamic structures to maintain stability for operation in a complex environment. At the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), we have designed, implemented, and tested advanced controls to maximize energy extraction and reduce <b>structural</b> <b>dynamic</b> <b>loads.</b> These control designs are based on linear models of the turbine that are generated by specialized modeling software.

40|$|Dynamic load of {{helicopter}} rotors due to gust directly {{affects the}} structural stress and flight performance for helicopters. Based {{on a large}} deflection beam theory, an aeroelastic model for isolated helicopter rotors in the time domain is constructed. The <b>dynamic</b> response and <b>structural</b> <b>load</b> for a rotor under the impulse gust and slope-shape gust are calculated, respectively. First, a nonlinear Euler beam model with 36 degrees-of-freedoms per element is applied to depict the structural dynamics for an isolated rotor. The generalized dynamic wake model and Leishman-Beddoes dynamic stall model are applied to calculate the nonlinear unsteady aerodynamic forces on rotors. Then, we transformed the differential aeroelastic governing equation to an algebraic one. Hence, the widely used Newton-Raphson iteration algorithm is employed to simulate the dynamic gust load. An isolated helicopter rotor with four blades is studied to validate the structural model and the aeroelastic model. The modal frequencies based on the Euler beam model agree well with published ones by CAMRAD. The flap deflection due to impulse gust {{with the speed of}} 2 m/s increases twice to the one without gust. In this numerical example, results indicate that the bending moment at the blade root is alleviated due to elastic effect...|$|R
40|$|When {{using all}} MSC/NASTRAN eigensolution methods except Lanczos, the analyst can replace the coupled system rigid-body modes {{calculated}} within DMAP module READ with mass orthogonalized and normalized rigid-body modes {{generated from the}} system stiffness. This option is invoked by defining MSC/NASTRAN r-set degrees of freedom via the SUPORT bulk data card. The newly calculated modes are required if the rigid-body modes calculated by the eigensolver are not 'clean' due to numerical roundoffs in the solution. When performing transient <b>structural</b> <b>dynamic</b> <b>load</b> analysis, the numerical roundoffs can result in inaccurate rigid-body accelerations which affect steady-state responses. Unfortunately, when using the Lanczos method and defining r-set degrees of freedom, the rigid-body modes calculated within DMAP module REIGL are retained. To overcome this limitation and to allow MSC/NASTRAN to handle SUPORT degrees of freedom identically for all eigensolvers, a DMAP Alter has been written which replaces Lanczos-calculated rigid-body modes with stiffness-generated rigid-body modes. The newly generated rigid-body modes are normalized {{with respect to the}} system mass and orthogonalized using the Gram-Schmidt technique. This algorithm has been implemented as an enhancement to an existing coupled loads methodology...|$|R

40|$|One of the Civil {{criteria}} in ABET TC 2 K is that programs “apply current knowledge and adapt to emerging applications of technology,” such as, {{changes in the}} building codes. Structural design firms also have the expectation that Civil Engineering Technology (CET) graduates {{should be able to}} apply current codes to determine <b>structural</b> <b>loads,</b> required for the analysis and design of structures. While most CET programs expose their students to structural analysis and design using instructor or textbook-prescribed loads, few expose students to the detailed calculation of actual <b>structural</b> <b>loads</b> using current codes. Many jurisdictions in the United States, including New York State, have recently adopted the International Building Code (IBC), which contains the latest provisions on <b>structural</b> <b>loads,</b> including wind and seismic loads for buildings. Prior to 2002, in New York State, the building code only required buildings to be designed for wind loads using a very simple tabular method. Seismic loads were not considered. Under that dispensation, it was possible and feasible to integrate the topic of <b>structural</b> <b>loads,</b> dead, live, snow and wind load, into any one of the structural design courses, all-be-it at an elementary level. However, with the adoption of building codes, such as the IBC 2000, the calculation of <b>structural</b> <b>loads</b> has become complex and time consuming.

40|$|To {{assist in}} the {{development}} of mechanical structures which are subjected to <b>dynamic</b> <b>loads,</b> <b>structural</b> <b>dynamic</b> testing, using a test rig loaded by servo-hydraulic actuators to reproduce operational measured responses in the laboratory, may form an essential element of the development process. The input loads acting on the structure under operational conditions can in most cases not be measured directly, and instead the <b>structural</b> <b>dynamic</b> responses to these loads are recorded. The input forcing functions then need to be determined to effect a simulation of the operational conditions. With this work, a time domain based testing system has been developed to enable the reproduction of service-acquired dynamic responses on any actual full scale structure in the laboratory, taking into account the full multiple axis dynamics of the system. The system is able to determine the input forcing functions in such a way that, when applied to the teststructure, an accurate reproduction of the in-service measured responses are reproduced on the computer controlled laboratory test rig. The test structure is instrumented with suitable transducers which are used to record the <b>structural</b> <b>dynamic</b> response under operational conditions. The test structure is thereafter installed in a servo-hydraulic actuator test rig in the laboratory. The test rig is excited with synthetic random inputs while simultaneously recording the responses to these inputs. Using the experimental input-output data, a dynamic model of the test system is found by using parametric dynamic system identification techniques. By using the service aquired vibration responses together with the dynamic model, the system inputs may be determined. A series of iterations around this first approximation finally provides a high degree of accuracy in the simulation. To prove the integrity of the developed system, it has been applied to a number of case studies using a variety of different engineering structures, and very accurate results were achieved.
