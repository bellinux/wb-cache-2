2500|$|Health {{advocacy}} encompasses direct {{service to}} the individual or family as well as activities that promote health and {{access to health care}} in communities and the larger public. [...] Advocates support and promote the rights of the patient in the health care arena, help build capacity to improve community health and enhance health policy initiatives focused on available, safe and quality care. Health advocates are best suited to address the challenge of patient-centered care in our complex healthcare system. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) defines patient-centered care as: Health care that establishes a partnership among practitioners, patients, and their families (when appropriate) to ensure that decisions respect patients’ wants, needs, and preferences and that patients have the education and support they need to make decisions and participate <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>care.</b> Patient-centered care {{is also one of the}} overreaching goals of health advocacy, in addition to safer medical systems, and greater patient involvement in healthcare delivery and design.|$|E

50|$|Clinicians {{are trained}} in shared {{decision-making}} so patients are actively involved <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>care</b> when they do require input from health services. There are targeted programmes for high-risk population groups, such as older people, those living in nursing homes, people with long-term conditions, and people with high body mass index. There is a system-wide electronic health record so information about patients is available across providers. This enables effective co-ordination of care across different settings.|$|E

50|$|A 'Training & Enrichment' {{department}} {{was established in}} 2008 {{to improve the quality}} of the animals' lives. Animals are now trained to voluntarily participate <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>care.</b> This technique is known to reduce stress caused by medical and husbandry procedures. A study conducted on the Safari's chimpanzees has shown that protected contact training significantly reduces the chimpanzees' social stress.Behavioral enrichment is incorporated into daily animal care routine. Enrichment encourages natural behaviors and provides interesting experiences for both animals and zoo visitors.|$|E
50|$|Similar changes {{occurred}} in the medical area, especially in the 1980s with the beginnings of hospice and home care/home health care industries. Patients since the 1980s have been encouraged to become participants <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>care</b> and to become knowledgeable consumers of the services of medical care. In the UK for example, the government has largely contributed to encouraging patients to become more active. The government has focused on developing information services such as NHS (National Health Service) Direct and NHS Direct Online.|$|E

5000|$|... === Iron replacement=== When {{adjusting}} daily iron supplementation regimens, {{lowering the}} daily iron dose requires a longer duration of therapy. The estimated total dose of elemental iron {{may be used}} to guide therapy, and replacement may be provided in cycles. Based on this approach, the person should participate <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>care</b> by determining the iron formulation and dose schedule that they are able to tolerate. The amount of elemental iron that is absorbed in the gut is not constant, and can change significantly depending on several factors, including hemoglobin level and body iron stores. The amount of iron absorbed decreases as the iron deficiency is corrected. Therefore, {{it is not possible to}} predict the exact amount of iron that will be absorbed, but it is recommended that approximately 10%-20% of an oral iron dose will be absorbed in the beginning of the therapy.|$|E
