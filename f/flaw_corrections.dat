50|$|NASA was {{planning}} on replacing the post-Challenger SRBs with a new Advanced Solid Rocket Motor (ASRM) to be built by Aerojet at a new facility, designed by subcontractor, RUST International, on {{the location of a}} canceled Tennessee Valley Authority nuclear power plant, at Yellow Creek, Mississippi. The ASRM would have produced additional thrust in order to increase shuttle payload, so that it could carry modules and construction components to the ISS. The ASRM program was canceled in 1993 after robotic assembly systems and computers were on-site and approximately 2 billion dollars spent, in favor of continued use, after design <b>flaw</b> <b>corrections,</b> of the SRB.|$|E
50|$|In {{response}} to the crash Saab and US firm Calspan introduced software modifications to the aircraft. A modified Lockheed NT-33A {{was used to test}} these improvements, which allowed flight testing to resume 15 months after the accident. On 8 August 1993, production aircraft 39102 was destroyed in an accident during an aerial display in Stockholm. Test pilot Rådeström lost control of the aircraft during a roll at low altitude when the aircraft stalled, forcing him to eject. Saab later found the problem was high amplification of the pilot's quick and significant stick command inputs. The ensuing investigation and <b>flaw</b> <b>correction</b> delayed test flying by several months, resuming in December 1993.|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} the Selection of Original Universe Proposal (SOUP) of Tye et al {{and show that}} as it stands, this proposal is <b>flawed.</b> The <b>corrections</b> to the Euclidean gravity action that were to select a Universe with a sufficiently large value of the cosmological constant Λ to allow for an inflationary phase only serve to renormalize the cosmological constant so that Λ→Λeff. SOUP then predicts a wave function that is highly peaked around Λeff→ 0, thereby reintroducing {{the issue of how}} to select initial conditions allowing for inflation in the early Universe...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{contribute}} to the generic theory of Hamiltonians by proving {{that there is a}} C 2 -residual R in the set of C 2 Hamiltonians on a closed symplectic manifold M, such that, for any H in R, there is a full measure subset of energies e in H(M) such that the Hamiltonian level (H,e) is topologically mixing; moreover these level sets are homoclinic classes.

5000|$|Modern {{critics are}} {{surprised}} by just how little Webster changed the King James Version. His revision was very light, {{as he did}} not want to make the language wholly contemporary, but rather wanted to correct flaws he disagreed with as an educator. Other, less orthodox Americans were bringing out their own versions of the New Testament, but he had no interest in theologically motivated changes. One notable change that was beyond just revising language <b>flaws</b> was a <b>correction</b> changing the word [...] "Easter" [...] in Acts 12:4 to the word [...] "Passover".|$|R
50|$|Bulgakov {{responded to}} the heresy {{accusation}} in his Dokladnaia zapiska Mitropolitu Evlogiiu prof. prot. Sergiia Bulgakova (Paris, 1936). Archbishop Seraphim then rebutted Bulgakov in his Zashchita sofianskoi eresi (Sofia, 1937). No final report was prepared on the sophiology controversy by the commission set up by Bulgakov's own jurisdiction. However, Metropolitan Evlogy convoked a bishops' conference on 26-29 November 1937 to bring closure to the matter. The bishops in their statement were working from reports by Archimandrite Cassian (Bezobrazov) and Chetverikov and they concluded that the accusations of heresy against Bulgakov were unfounded but that his theological opinions showed serious <b>flaws</b> and needed <b>correction.</b>|$|R
50|$|Investigation of {{telemetry}} data quickly {{narrowed the}} cause of the failure to a fault somewhere in the guidance system, but the exact nature of it could not be determined. It appeared that the missile programmer either shut off completely shortly after liftoff or suffered a power outage, restarted, and then failed to execute the pitch and roll sequence. Two months after the MA-3 flight, the Atlas's programmer was discovered buried in mud on a beach not far from the launch pad and examined. The exact cause of the failure was not determined with certainty, however several possible causes were proposed, including contamination of pins in the programmer or a transient voltage that had caused the programmer to reset itself. The programmer on the whole was found to have several serious design <b>flaws</b> that required <b>correction.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{correction}} of the documented heritage, {{is a necessity}} in research which must be fulfilled, based on a scientific methodology, understanding of the standards of correction and critical view to the text. It is only through this procedure to do the initial {{correction of}} a text or recognize the text <b>correction</b> <b>flaws</b> and attempt to proofread and re-correct the text for a second time. In this article, it is attempted to conduct a critical study over"Emadi Shahryari" epistle(Divan) and to express briefly its flaws in five categories, alongside the flaws which has misguided the reviser. The Introduction and categorization of these flaws can lead to preventing them from being repeated and assist the other revisers not to have similar flaws. The authors have categorized the flaws under fifteen general titles, for each evidences have been delivered from "Emadi's" Divan refined by "Zabi-al-la Habib...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{frequent}} requirements changes, extensions of functionality, {{as well as}} continuous adaptation to changing environments, the designs of large software systems continually degrade. In the context of object [...] oriented software restructuring, we {{show that there is}} still an important gap between the design <b>flaw</b> detection and <b>correction</b> phases, as well as an acute lack of rigorously defined correction methodologies and appropriate tools. In this paper, we state a number of important criteria that have to be fulfilled by any such approach. The novel notion of "correction strategy" is then introduced, as a reference description that enables a human [...] assisted tool to plan all necessary steps for the safe removal of detected design flaws, with special concern towards the targeted quality goals of the restructuring process. Based on correction strategies, we propose a scalable, quality [...] driven and highly automatable approach {{to bridge the gap between}} state of the art design flaw detection methodologies and source code transformations...|$|R

When you mention tuning the engine some think only maintenance is performed but it should be emphasized that the engine had some significant <b>flaws</b> and that <b>correction</b> was necessary; to carry out it was put into practice knowledge acquired in college {{and with the help of}} manual and painstaking research the various engine problems were resolved. Once the engine tuning was completed it was found the actual state of automatic transmission and the diagnosis, transmission has its roots even before it had been repaired but was not a success, because of this the car passed without work near one year. Overall, this project some considerable problems were corrected and is not only limited to repair by replacing a part with a new one, but the analysis of the causes that produced damage, so bring a final solution to all problems...|$|R
40|$|Continuing {{increases}} {{in the cost of}} higher education, along with an ever-changing financial aid environment, suggest that financial planning is more important than ever for those seeking to send a child to college. One commonly used aid to the financial planner is the "college savings table, " which is ubiquitous in both the popular press, as well as the literature geared toward financial planners. Although they are intended to simplify the planning process, some of these tables may lead to misallocation of family resources. The tables generally purport to show how much money parents must save monthly to fund four years of college at a specified future date. We demonstrate that these tables often employ <b>flawed</b> methodology. Upon <b>correction</b> (and given reasonable assumptions about investor behavior, growth rates in tuition costs, and investment yields), the monthly savings necessary to fund a given level of college expenses can be substantially less than those reported. Additionally, published tables typically provide the planner with a limited range of investment yield assumptions, suggesting a narrow range of porrfolio possibilities. We provide a series of tables which allow the financial planner to estimate required savings for various combinations of investment yields and tuition growth rates.
