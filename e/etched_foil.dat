40|$|The surface {{enlargement}} {{to increase}} the electrical capacity of Al-foil for electrolytic condensers is usually obtained by etching in chlorid-containing solutions. Such processes lead to pollution of environment. As mentioned in the literature {{it is possible to}} get anodic foils for this purpose by vapour deposition of Al on foils, but the specific capacity is smaller than this one by etching. During working at this project it was experimented on production of cathodic foil by an additive process for surface enlargement with high capacity and chemical stability. The Al-foil was cleaned with plasma and in the presence of oxygen and argon at reduced pressure and vapour deposited with Al in a vacuum vapour deposition equipment for foils. The obtained layers were porous, oxid-containing with a width till 12 #mu#m and values of capacity up to 2000 #mu#F/cm 2. The process of stabilisation for a constant capacity during storage on the air and in water has to proceed in a wet-chemical way. The maximal values decreased to 1000 #mu#F/cm" 2, but they are sufficient higher as <b>etched</b> <b>foils</b> of the same thickness.
