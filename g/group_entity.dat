5000|$|Application of {{the theory}} of {{inherently}} competitive group-entities below that level is questionable to the degree that the group or the entity does have some biological identity, e.g. an ecoregion, a species, a food chain, the carbon cycle of the atmosphere, the water cycle of a watershed. Such bases for organization would seem, like that of the kin, clan, or family, to align biological and group interests, and therefore overcome the objections that group and individual entities have nothing in common. Accordingly, eco-anarchism and the looser green anarchisms, and related theories in green economics such as that of trustee stewardship of the commons, are more likely to perceive group-entity actions as benign if the <b>group</b> <b>entity</b> itself has a biological or ecological parameter, mission or scope. For instance, watersheds as borders, or a migration corridors as a right of way, could align the interests of the biological creatures that rely on these to the group-entities that succeed via effective management of them.

40|$|The {{standardized}} method {{set out in}} the New Basel Accord {{requires the}} different evaluation of similar counterparties belonging to groups with a different rating. Based on the “criteria” adopted by the rating agencies, there are no independent estimates of group ratings, with respect to the rating of the individual <b>group</b> <b>entities,</b> and, in many cases, the agencies choose not to notify the market of their judgement of the group. This paper examines the ratings of groups and individual <b>group</b> <b>entities,</b> with a view to assessing the effects of change to the group structure on the rating. The analysis focuses on the financial sector and is limited to the Italian market, which has been characterized in recent years by a strong trend towards concentration. The results achieved by analysing the rating processes by the principal international agencies (Fitch, Moody’s and Standard and Poor’s) show that the ratings of the groups, or of the individual <b>group</b> <b>entities,</b> adjusted {{on the basis of their}} characteristics, are not at all affected by the occurrence of significant corporate events regarding the group’s structure...|$|R

50|$|By {{the end of}} 1968, the Beatles' {{status as}} a <b>group</b> <b>entity</b> was in limbo. McCartney {{suggested}} a group project involving rehearsing, recording and performing the songs in a live concert. The project soon adopted a working title of Get Back but would eventually see official release as the Let It Be album and film in 1970. Although the sessions for their double album had involved a degree of ensemble playing, the band were ill-prepared to settle comfortably back into this mode; in particular, Lennon had descended into heroin addiction, leaving him variously incommunicative or {{highly critical of the}} venture. On 10 January 1969, eight days after filmed rehearsals commenced at Twickenham Film Studios, Harrison's frustration and resentment peaked and he informed his bandmates that he was leaving. Having enjoyed rewarding collaborations outside the Beatles during much of 1968, particularly with Eric Clapton, Bob Dylan and the Band, the combined patronising by McCartney and estrangement from Lennon had taken its toll. The band were therefore on the verge of potential collapse and at an impasse. In 2003, Rolling Stone magazine cited a recording that exists from the Twickenham sessions the day after Harrison's departure in which Lennon suggests inviting Clapton to take over lead guitar duties.|$|E
40|$|The European Commission is {{currently}} working on a legislative draft to harmonise the corporate income tax provisions for multinational groups of companies throughout the European Union. For that purpose the European Commission has installed a working group with the mission to draft a Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB) applicable for multinational companies. As the EU member states are not willing to surrender their taxing power to the supranational level of the EU each group entity's tax base would be determined by apportionment of the group's overall taxable income according to a predefined micro-economic factor based formula whereas the group income will be calculated by consolidating earnings beforehand separately determined by each <b>group</b> <b>entity</b> (preconsolidation income). The situs state of the particular <b>group</b> <b>entity</b> would then apply its statutory corporate tax rate on the apportioned tax base. This paper evaluates the effects of this prospective apportionment procedure on any given corporate <b>group</b> <b>entity</b> and finds that the share of the group's income allocated to a particular entity using the apportionment formula does regularly not equal the pre-consolidation income of the respective <b>group</b> <b>entity.</b> The reasons for this regular observable deviation can be found on the one hand in the concept of the apportionment formula and on the other hand in the specifics of the definitions of the apportionment factors.

40|$|Abstract—Document images {{prove to}} be a {{difficult}} case for standard stereo correspondence approaches. One of the major problem is that document images are highly self-similar. Most algorithms try to tackle this problem by incorporating a global optimization scheme, which tends to be computationally expensive. In this paper, we show that incorporation of layout information into the matching paradigm, as a <b>grouping</b> <b>entity</b> for features, leads to better results in terms of robustness, efficiency, and ultimately in a better 3 D model of the captured document, {{that can be used in}} various document restoration systems. This can be seen as a divide and conquer approach that partitions the search space into portions given by each <b>grouping</b> <b>entity</b> and then solves each of them independently. As a <b>grouping</b> <b>entity</b> text-lines are preferred over individual character blobs because it is easier to establish correspon-dences. Text-line extraction works reasonably well on stereo image pairs in the presence of perspective distortions. The proposed approach is highly efficient and matches obtained are more reliable. The claims are backed up by showing their practical applicability through experimental evaluations.

30|$|The musical symbols used in Sargam {{notation}} {{are classified}} as singleton or grouped entity according to whether they have meaning or sense in single form or they make sense only when they combine with another musical entity. For example, anumandra, the octave specification symbol makes sense only when it is joined with a musical note (Swara). Singleton musical entities are always found independent in the notation and have semantics of their own. An example of singleton entities are tala marking symbols, anga/avarta mark etc. This classification among music symbols is required due to difference in encoding single and group entities, where <b>group</b> <b>entity</b> symbols can be encoded together only and not individually.|$|E
