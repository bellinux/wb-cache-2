5|$|Cagney {{was even}} more violent towards women in the gangster film Picture Snatcher (1933): in one scene, he knocks out an amorous woman whose {{feelings}} he does not reciprocate and violently throws her <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>backseat</b> of his car. In April 1931, the same month as the release of The Public Enemy, Hays recruited former police chief August Vollmer to conduct {{a study on the}} effect gangster pictures had on children. After he had finished his work, Vollmer stated that gangster films were innocuous and even overly favorable in depicting the police. Although Hays used the results to defend the film industry, the New York State censorship board was not impressed, and from 1930 through 1932, removed 2,200 crime scenes from pictures.|$|E
25|$|On August 9, 1943, Basquette {{was raped}} and robbed in Burbank, California, after {{she gave a}} ride to 22-year-old Army Private George Paul Rimke.

Rimke denied the charges but was found guilty on August 26, 1943 and sentenced to life in prison.|$|E

5000|$|Airbag Safety: Before {{the first}} challenge, Andrew gives the {{remaining}} five drivers a brief safety lesson {{on the dangers}} that {{can be caused by}} the violent inflation of an airbag, as nearly all of them have bad habits that could cause them to be injured (Mariah's constant smartphone use, Tyler's habit of hunching over his wheel, Jason's incorrect wheel grip, and Chanie's bizarre driving posture; Siham is again the only driver with no major issues in this department). The triggering of a Honda Civic's passenger-side airbag is shown to be so violent that it blows <b>the</b> rear-view mirror <b>into</b> <b>the</b> car's <b>backseat,</b> shocking <b>the</b> five drivers.|$|R
5000|$|On December 28, 1972, McBratney made {{arrangements}} to kidnap a Gambino crime family loanshark who Jerry Capeci and fellow investigative journalists only identify as [...] "Junior". The loanshark was allegedly Vincent D'Amore, a capo in the Gambino crime family. Maloney approached [...] "Junior" [...] on the street, shoved a handgun into his stomach, and forced him into nearby waiting vehicle with McBratney, Genovese and Shurman. Junior fought his attempted kidnappers and Maloney pistolwhipped him before forcing him <b>into</b> <b>the</b> car's <b>backseat</b> so <b>the</b> gang {{could make a}} quick retreat. Unfortunately for McBratney and the others, two young boys witnessed the kidnapping, recording the license plate and {{turned it over to}} a relative with connections to organized crime.|$|R

500|$|According to Sánchez, on Friday, November 6, 2009, she {{and three}} others were taken in her own {{neighborhood}} by men working for the Cuban government. She {{said that she was}} heading to an anti-violence demonstration and was forcefully put into a car along with another Cuban blogger, Orlando Luis Pardo Lazo (she stated that the other two were placed into another car). She characterizes the event on her blog, Generation Y, as a [...] "kidnapping" [...] and describes the event in detail. [...] Sánchez said that when she was accosted on the street, [...] "The curious crowded around and I shouted, 'Help, these men want to kidnap us,' but they stopped those who wanted to intervene with a shout that revealed the whole ideological background of the operation, 'Don’t mess with it, these are counterrevolutionaries.'" [...] Sánchez said that she was put <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>backseat</b> of the car and received blows to her head, legs and buttocks as she was pinned down. [...] The incident was condemned by the U.S. administration and by Human Rights Watch.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Red Blooded Woman" [...] was {{directed}} by Jake Nava, an English film director who had previously worked with artists like Beyoncé and Kelis. It was filmed in Los Angeles, California, in December 2003. It begins with a scene of a congested traffic jam in which Minogue is caught. She is shown seated in her car singing to the song in a sensual manner, with the camera repeatedly focusing on her eyes and lips. Her outfit is composed of {{a black and white}} singlet, a satin waist cincher, jeans with chain fringes, and a black sheepskin shrug (this outfit was donated by Minogue to the Arts Centre Melbourne and is displayed in the Kylie Minogue Collection). A few seconds later, she gets down from her vehicle and playfully makes her way to a tank. Climbing up on its ladder, Minogue dances seductively to the chorus of the song. She then resumes walking on the street and is accompanied by two doberman puppies who escape from a nearby car. After entering <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>backseat</b> of another car, Minogue begins unwrapping a red dress and proceeds to change into it as she is watched by various onlookers. As the second chorus starts, Minogue is seen dancing with a group of backup dancers at a different location. Her attire consists of a fluorine yellow bustier worn underneath a pastel pink dress designed by French fashion house Balenciaga. The scene changes back to the street, where Minogue is shown entering a truck. She dims the lights and then dances in a different outfit, consisting of a black bikini, red leggings, and laced gloves. However, she exits the truck in the same red outfit she donned earlier. The rest of the video rapidly intersperses scenes of Minogue dancing inside and in front of the truck, on a car, with the backup dancers, and near a gang of motorcyclists.|$|E
