40|$|Most {{patients}} have explicit desires or requests when they visit their physicians. Identification of patients' requests and needs {{is the starting}} point of a patient-centered approach to care. The frequency with which physicians met their patients' <b>desires</b> <b>for</b> services and that frequency's association with patient satisfaction were examined for 243 patients with chronic disease in general medicine clinics of a Department of Veterans Affairs hospital. Patients desired a mean of 11. 9 services, of which an average of 67 percent were met. However, many patients' <b>desires</b> <b>for</b> information and most of their <b>desires</b> <b>for</b> help with emotional and family problems were not met. Patients with the most unmet <b>desires</b> <b>for</b> services, especially services related to information, were significantly less satisfied with their physicians than were those with fewer unmet desires. Factor analysis was used to develop a short, 16 -item Requests for Services Questionnaire that appeared to cover the range of services that patients with chronic conditions desire. Enhancing physicians' ability to recognize and respond to patients' <b>desires</b> <b>for</b> services by using short patient request questionnaires may have the potential to improve patient satisfaction and other health care outcomes...|$|R

Our analysis included data from 205 adults, who furnished {{a total of}} 7, 827 reports of their desires {{over the course of}} a week. Across various desire domains, results revealed substantial differences in desire frequency and strength, the degree of conflict between desires and other goals, and the likelihood of resisting desire and the success of this resistance. <b>Desires</b> <b>for</b> sleep and sex were experienced most intensively, whereas <b>desires</b> <b>for</b> tobacco and alcohol had the lowest average strength, despite the fact that these substances are thought of as addictive. <b>Desires</b> <b>for</b> leisure and sleep conflicted the most with other goals, and <b>desires</b> <b>for</b> media use and work brought about the most self-control failure. In addition, we observed support for a limited-resource model of self-control employing a novel operationalization of cumulative resource depletion: The frequency and recency of engaging in prior self-control negatively predicted people’s success at resisting subsequent desires on the same day...|$|R
