50|$|Homosexuality {{was often}} linked to {{communism}} <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> <b>War's</b> Lavender Scare and critics {{have written about}} film's subtle, yet central, <b>Cold</b> <b>War</b> narrative. <b>The</b> fair amount of subtlety employed in All About Eve is seen as primarily being due to Production Code restrictions on the depiction of homosexuals in <b>the</b> media <b>during</b> this time. However, notwithstanding those restrictions, Corber cites the film as but {{one example of a}} recurrent theme within American film of the homosexual as an emotionally bereft predator. The documentary The Celluloid Closet also affirms this theme to which Corber refers, including citing numerous other film examples from the same Production Code time period in which All About Eve was made.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to use the assault on the JAFRC, and Barsky’s {{individual}} story within that, to illuminate the mechanisms of political repression <b>during</b> <b>the</b> early <b>Cold</b> <b>War.</b> <b>The</b> JAFRC was the first to be subpoenaed by HUAC, the first to challenge its legitimacy, and the first to set <b>the</b> pattern for <b>Cold</b> <b>War</b> inquisitions. In 1950, after three years of unsuccessful legal appeals, the Committee’s entire Executive Board was jailed. Barsky received the most severe sentence. It was the biggest single incarceration of political prisoners in America <b>during</b> <b>the</b> early <b>Cold</b> <b>War.</b> Upon release, Barsky lost his right to practise medicine. By early 1955, the JAFRC had dissolved: like Barsky’s career, it had been crippled by McCarthyism...|$|R
