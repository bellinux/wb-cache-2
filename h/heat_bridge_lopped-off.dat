In this research, insulation panels with multilayer, low-emissivity aluminum-polyethylene sheets were prepared and investigated. The results of the study showed that surface emissivity and convection currents have important influence on heat flow. The aluminum-polyethylene sheets were effective in reflecting heat and reducing heat transfer by radiation. They also divided the air space in the insulation system, resulting in the reduction of convection currents and convection heat transfer. The heat insulation system was built without micro <b>heat</b> <b>bridges.</b> Consequently, <b>heat</b> conduction was not increased by micro <b>heat</b> <b>bridges</b> resulting in lower effective thermal conductivity than the commonly used insulation materials.

30|$|Heat {{transfer}} in a WS or CF mat occurs via solid conduction, gaseous conduction, convection, and radiation. The extent of solid conduction {{depends on the}} quantity of WS or CF in the mat, since these materials form <b>heat</b> <b>bridges.</b> It also depends on fiber alignments in the mat, because the k-value along the longitudinal direction is 2 – 3 times greater than that in the transverse direction [10].

40|$|During {{the last}} {{years there has been}} {{reported}} considerable and rapid contamination on newly built rendered façades in Sweden due to biological growth. The problem is believed to occur mostly on façades of render applied on thermal insulation, but apart from this it is difficult to find clear relationships indication which façades might be infected. The aim of this project is to explain why certain façades gets heavy biological growth while other seemingly similar do not. We will do that with comparing biological knowledge with building physical and -technical knowledge. One of the major approaches in this project is to investigate building façades. We have investigated several buildings with discolored façades, mostly in Skåne, the southern most part of Sweden, and tried to identify the organisms growing. The most dominating organisms we found growing on the façades were lichens and algae. In addition we have investigated building façades with organized patterns of small round areas where no growth occur on otherwise quite fouled façades. These small round areas appears then on the façade as “white dots”. Further investigations of the façades show that the “white dots” appear at each fastener placed under the rendering to fasten the thermal insulation to the structural wall behind. We believe that the fasteners are <b>heat</b> <b>bridges,</b> with higher outer surface temperature and therefore a lower surface relative humidity at which no microbial growth occurs. Results from computer simulations showed that the fasteners are <b>heat</b> <b>bridges</b> and in cases with thin layers of thermal insulation and rendering give a 1 - 2 K higher night-time temperatures {{than the rest of the}} façade which made a difference in relative humidity at 11 %. This small difference in temperature gives high enough differences in moisture state to almost prevent microbial growth above the fasteners. As we know that organisms need a high relative humidity to grow, these results could explain the uneven distribution of biological growth on the façades with “white dots”. Temperature and relative humidity measurements on façades of thin rendering on thermal insulation (light façades) and brick wall with rendering (heavy façades) shows that light façades are more directly influenced by the weather conditions than the heavy façades. The temperature varied much more on the light façades than the on the heavy façades; in a day of October 2005 the temperature varied from 60. 4 °C during daytime to - 0. 4 °C during the next night. During nights there is no difference between the lowest temperatures on the light façades on the south- and north-facing façades. The light façades gets colder in the night then the heavy façades due to the lower heat capacity in the construction, whereas the heavy façades with the higher heat capacity can store the heat from daytime during night. The red-colored façades, which had a higher temperature than the white-colored façades, have a significantly lower relative humidity with a difference of 20 % relative humidity if it was not fully overcast. The relative humidity during night on the south-facing façades shows that the white-colored heavy façade had a higher maximum relative humidity with approximately difference of 10 % relative humidity during night than the red-colored light façade in spite of the higher minimum temperature during night on the white-colored heavy façade. The results from the temperature measurements above the fasteners show that the fasteners are <b>heat</b> <b>bridges</b> that increase the façade surface a few degrees during night, but also in the winter on the north-facing façade during daytime. We will continue our measurements of temperature and relative humidity on heavy and light façades in addition with investigations of biological growth on both the above façades and on newly built light façades. Also biological growth will be studied on samples with thin rendering on thermal insulation where we will investigate different abiotic factors on the samples. By this we hope to understand the mineral façade as a biological habitat and learn more about the organisms living there and which abiotic and biotic factors that control the growth...|$|R

Two more new concepts of reference entransy dissipation and nondimensional entransy dissipation are first introduced. Then it is showed that the nondimensional entransy dissipation rate (NER) can be employed as an objective function to evaluate the efficiency of a thermal transfer process in a porous material. By using this criterion and a newly developed structure growth algorithms, different porous structures were generated and the corresponding values of both ETC and NER were derived to illustrate the usefulness and power of using NER to assess the thermal performance of the materials. The results show that the effective thermal conductivity not only influences the heat transfer ability of porous media, but also reflects the irreversibility of heat conduction in porous media, which is a dissipation coefficient for heat transfer. Meanwhile, decreasing the structural particle size will increase the contact points, i. e. more <b>heat</b> <b>bridges,</b> decrease the temperature gradient nearby the contact points, and hence significantly increase the effective thermal coefficient of porous media. Essentially, decreasing the particle size will result in a more uniform distribution of both temperature gradient and local entransy dissipation rate along the heat flow direction, and consequently lead to a larger effective thermal conductivity...|$|R

Imaging the building façades and the roofs with an IR camera, thermal inspections {{of the buildings}} can be carried out. In such inspections a spatial correspondence between IR-images and the existing 3 D building models can be helpful. Texturing 3 D building models with IR images this spatial correspondence can be created. Furthermore in textures heat leakages can be detected and the <b>heat</b> <b>bridges</b> can be stored together with 3 D building data. However, before extracting leakages, the windows should be located. In IR images glass reflects the surrounding and shows false results for the temperature measurements. Consequently, the windows should be detected in IR images and excluded for the inspection. The most common algorithms for window detection were developed for the images in the visual band. In this paper, an algorithm for window detection in textures extracted from terrestrial IR images is proposed. In the first step, small objects have to be removed by scaling down the image (texture).
