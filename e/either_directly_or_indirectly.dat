Each of the single gene defects is rare, with more than 200 in all described. Most genes involved affect ion channels, <b>either</b> <b>directly</b> <b>or</b> <b>indirectly.</b> These include genes for ion channels themselves, enzymes, GABA, and G protein-coupled receptors.|$|E

5|$|The {{setting of}} the main series is a Northern European-style dark fantasy world where humans and creatures from myth and legends live side by side, while the {{spin-off}} game is set in an alternative reality leading {{from one of the}} first game's possible endings.

Dark or mature plot and character themes and multiple endings have become a staple of the series.

5|$|Stone recovered, and was {{released}} from UCDMC on October 15, a week after he was stabbed. Sacramento Police detectives {{were assigned to the}} case shortly after the initial stabbing. Along with video obtained of the assault; eyewitness statements; and tips from the public, detectives determined the identity of the assailant, and an arrest warrant was issued for Tran. On November 4th, 2015, Tran was arrested without incident, after detectives, uniformed officers, and deputies from the Sacramento Police Department, Elk Grove Police Department, and Sacramento County Sheriff's Department conducted a traffic stop near his home in Elk Grove, California. Law enforcement officials involved in the case said that it did not appear Tran or anyone in his group knew of Stone's publicity. Officials also stated that the crime {{did not appear to be}} a retaliatory strike by a terrorist organization (<b>either</b> <b>directly</b> <b>or</b> <b>indirectly)</b> against Stone for his part in foiling a terror attack. Law enforcement officials stated that Tran has previous felony convictions, and that Tran was most likely intoxicated at the time of the assault.|$|E

40|$|Abstract A Russellian {{notion of}} what it is for a {{proposition}} to be “directly about” something in particular is defined. Various strong and weak, and mediate and immediate, Russellian notions of general (direct or indirect) aboutness are then defined in terms of Russellian direct aboutness. In particular, a proposition is about something iff the proposition is <b>either</b> <b>directly,</b> <b>or</b> strongly <b>indirectly,</b> about that thing. A competing Russellian account, due to Kaplan, is criticized through a distinction between knowledge by description and denoting by description. The epistemological significance of Russellian aboutness is assessed. A Russellian substitute for de re propositional attitude is considered...|$|R

25|$|A taunt is {{a battle}} cry, a method in hand-to-hand combat, sarcastic remark, or insult {{intended}} to demoralise the recipient, or to anger them and encourage reactionary behaviours without thinking. Taunting can exist {{as a form of}} social competition to gain control of the target's cultural capital (i.e. status). In sociological theory, the control of the three social capitals is used to produce an advantage in the social hierarchy as to enforce one's own position in relation to others. Taunting is committed by <b>either</b> <b>directly</b> bullying, <b>or</b> <b>indirectly</b> encouraging others to bully the target. It is also possible to give a response of the same kind, to ensure one's own status. It can be compared to fighting words and trash-talk.|$|R
30|$|Although Kramers’ law [5] and LDPs [26, 34] {{are well}} {{understood}} for finite-dimensional stochastic differential equations (SDEs), {{the work for}} infinite-dimensional evolution equations is much more recent. In particular, {{it has been shown}} very recently that one may extend Kramers’ law to certain stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) [4, 6, 7] driven by space-time white noise. The work of Berglund and Gentz [7] provides a quite general strategy how to “lift” a finite-dimensional Kramers’ law to the SPDE setting using a Galerkin approximation due to Blömker and Jentzen [8]. Since the transfer of PDE techniques to neural fields has been very successful, <b>either</b> <b>directly</b> [51] <b>or</b> <b>indirectly</b> [14, 21], one may conjecture that the same strategy also works for SPDEs and stochastic neural fields.|$|R
