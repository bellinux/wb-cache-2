5|$|The {{mining sector}} remains very lucrative, {{with some of}} the world's largest {{platinum}} reserves being mined by Anglo American plc and Impala Platinum. The Marange diamond fields, discovered in 2006, are considered the biggest diamond find in over a century. They have the potential to improve the fiscal situation of the country considerably, but almost all revenues from the field have disappeared <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> of army officers and ZANU-PF politicians.|$|E
25|$|Despite his success, Tarchaneiotes was resented by {{the local}} magnates, who had mostly profited from the {{previous}} situation and were most affected from his reforms and his honest administration, {{as well as by}} the anti-Arsenite establishment of the Church. In the end, some of the pronoia holders, who were deprived of land through John's reforms, approached the anti-Arsenite bishop of Philadelphia, Theoleptos, and accused Tarchaneiotes of plotting a revolt. Facing the hostility of the local aristocracy, Tarchaneiotes was forced to flee—probably in mid-1300—to Thessalonica, where the emperor resided. Apparently Tarchaneiotes was imprisoned again, for he is last recorded as being released again from prison in 1304. Following his flight, the situation in Asia Minor deteriorated rapidly as his reforms were abandoned and reversed, and the army's pay was diverted <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> of the local elites. Consequently, within a short time the Byzantine army disintegrated, especially as the numerous mercenaries deserted it for want of pay, opening the path for the complete collapse of Byzantine authority in Asia Minor over the next decade.|$|E
500|$|Communications scholar Arthur Kroker {{argues that}} Innis's {{study of the}} Canadian Pacific Railway was only the first in which he {{attempted}} to demonstrate that [...] "technology is not something external to Canadian being; but on the contrary, is the necessary condition and lasting consequence of Canadian existence". [...] It also reflected Innis's lifelong interest {{in the exercise of}} economic and political power. His CPR history ends, for example, with a recounting of Western grievances against economic policies, such as high freight rates and the steep import tariffs designed to protect fledgling Canadian manufacturers. Westerners complained that this National Policy funnelled money from Prairie farmers <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> of the Eastern business establishment. [...] "Western Canada", Innis wrote, [...] "has paid for the development of Canadian nationality, and it would appear that it must continue to pay. The acquisitiveness of Eastern Canada shows little sign of abatement." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{starting}} position {{in this game}} {{is the same as}} in standard chess. Players make moves as in standard chess. Instead of moving, a player can take one of their own pieces from the board and put it <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>pocket,</b> provided that <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> is empty. If the piece is placed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> from <b>the</b> last rank, it gets promoted to a piece of higher class. Otherwise the player has an option to mutate <b>the</b> piece <b>into</b> a different piece of the same class. The choice of mutating (or not) must be made at the time the piece is removed. White cannot use <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> on <b>the</b> first move. The king cannot be placed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>pocket.</b>|$|R

2500|$|In 2012, Cohen {{sponsored}} the Cohen Amendment reducing infrastructure funding to Afghanistan. The Afghan Infrastructure Fund {{has been plagued}} with problems, with millions of taxpayer dollars disappearing. When {{another member of the}} House said the funding was essential to bringing our troops home, Cohen replied “The {{truth of the matter is}} that it has nothing to do with whether we can bring our troops home or not. [...] The truth is that we cannot account for where this money is going, and it is likely going <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>pockets</b> of the top one-half of one percent in Afghanistan. [...] The infrastructure holds up well enough there to deploy and redeploy our troops, so it’s good enough to bring them home permanently.” The Amendment passed 228–191 and is the first piece of legislation reducing funding to Afghanistan.|$|E

50|$|Pocket {{mutation}} chess is a chess variant {{invented by}} Mike Nelson in 2003.

When placing <b>the</b> piece <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>the</b> player can mutate the piece, i.e. change it to a different piece.|$|R

500|$|On 13 and 14 June the 24th Brigade Group {{continued}} operations {{aimed at}} forcing <b>the</b> Japanese garrison <b>into</b> <b>the</b> stronghold—dubbed [...] "the Pocket" [...] by the Australians. The 2/43rd Battalion secured the emergency airstrip at Timbalai on Labuan's west coast on 13 June, and {{elements of the}} 2/28th Battalion continued to push west <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pocket</b> along MacArthur Road. A company from the 2/28th Battalion made another attack <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pocket</b> <b>the</b> next day after the 2/12th Field Regiment had fired 250 rounds <b>into</b> <b>the</b> area, but was forced to withdraw after being unable to overcome heavy resistance. By the conclusion of 14 June the Australians judged that, aside from <b>the</b> <b>Pocket,</b> <b>the</b> island was now secure. Porter assessed that an attack on this position {{would need to be}} made in strength using well-coordinated forces.|$|R
