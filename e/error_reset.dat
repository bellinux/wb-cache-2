Despite they are commonly and efficiently {{used for this}} purpose, the recent literature about navigation of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) demonstrates that they can represent a valuable support for these systems. Measurements of the AUV position can be exploited as observations within the onboard navigation filter to limit the drift of the state estimation error, unavoidable drawback in case of dead reckoning based approaches. This way, the AUVs can indeed be involved in longterm missions without the necessity of periodic surfacing to get GPS signal for estimation <b>error</b> <b>reset.</b> The paper presents some deductions derived by a considerable set of acoustic position measurements obtained through an EvoLogics S 2 CR 18 / 34 USBL modem used in two different configurations (fixed to a tripod {{on the bottom and}} floating on the surface). Different results were obtained in the two cases. The proposed analysis of the results will be a solid base for the optimization of the configuration of an USBL-aided navigation system for AUVs that the authors plan to implement and test in the coming future. Part of the experimental data are obtained exploiting the Littoral Ocean Observatory Network (LOON). The LOON consists of four EvoLogics S 2 CR 18 / 34 modems deployed by the NATO Science and Technology Organization Centre for Maritime Research and Experimentation (STO-CMRE) in the sea in front of La Spezia, Italy...|$|E

40|$|The {{existence}} of a worldwide indoor floorplans database can lead to significant growth in location-based applications, especially for indoor environments. In this paper, we present CrowdInside: a crowdsourcing-based system for the automatic construction of build-ings floorplans. CrowdInside leverages the smart phones sensors that are ubiquitously available with humans who use a building to automatically and transparently construct accurate motion traces. These accurate traces are generated based on a novel technique for reducing the errors in the inertial motion traces by using the points {{of interest in the}} indoor environment, such as elevators and stairs, for <b>error</b> <b>resetting.</b> The collected traces are then processed to detect the overall floorplan shape as well as higher level semantics such as detecting rooms and corridors shapes along with a variety of points of interest in the environment. Implementation of the system in two testbeds, using different An-droid phones, shows that CrowdInside can detect the points of inter-est accurately with 0. 2 % false positive rate and 1. 3 % false negative rate. In addition, the proposed <b>error</b> <b>resetting</b> technique leads to more than 12 times enhancement in the median distance error com-pared to the state-of-the-art. Moreover, the detailed floorplan can be accurately estimated with a {{a relatively small number of}} traces. This number is amortized over the number of users of the building. We also discuss possible extensions to CrowdInside for inferring even higher level semantics about the discovered floorplans. 1...|$|R

40|$|The Ramsey {{regression}} equation specification <b>error</b> test (<b>RESET)</b> furnishes a diagnostic for omitted variables in a linear regression model specification (i. e., {{the null hypothesis}} is no omitted variables). Integer powers of fitted values from a regression analysis are introduced as additional covariates in a second regression analysis. The former regression model can be considered restricted, whereas the latter model can be considered unrestricted; this first model is nested within this second model. A RESET significance test is conducted with an F-test using the error sums of squares and the degrees of freedom for the two models.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis {{is to develop a}} strategy for statistical/econometric inferences applicable to systemwise testing of econometric models. A common deficiency in many applied econometric studies is the absence of statistical diagnostic testing. A model {{is only as good as}} the assumptions being used, and if these assumptions are incorrect then the model can be as good as worthless. In the field of econometrics, available data typically consist of time series data which are not generated under controlled conditions. Hence there arises the need for a well designed misspecification testing strategy. Among other things, the thesis outlines a strategy for how to select an appropriate model. The thesis consists of four papers: Paper I, describes a misspecification testing strategy designed to ensure the appropriateness of the statistical assumptions underlying a system of equations. The strategy is explained and illustrated by means of an empirical example, in which the annual demand for milk in Sweden for the period 1960 - 1991 is estimated by using an approximation of the AIDS model (LA/AIDS).

Hence, a second ORNN, which is called the output recurrent neural identifier (ORNI), is used as an identifier to provide the required information.

40|$|There is a {{large body}} of {{evidence}} relating to the ways that people tap in time with sounds, and perform error correction in order to do this. However, off-beat tapping is less well investigated than on-beat tapping. The current study involves coordinating with a stimulus sequence with underlying isochrony and systematic deviations from this isochrony that increase or decrease in magnitude to look at people's capacity to error-correct when performing off-beat synchronisation with a set of sounds. Participants were instructed to 'tap between the tones' but 'try to maintain regularity'. While analysis using typical methods suggested a form of error correction was occurring, a series of more complex analyses demonstrated that participants' performance during each trial can be classified according to one of four different strategies: maintaining a regular pulse, <b>error</b> correction, phase <b>resetting,</b> and negative <b>error</b> correction. While maintaining a regular pulse was the preferred strategy in conditions with increasingly isochronous stimuli, the majority of trials are best explained by other strategies, suggesting that participants were generally influenced by variability in the stimuli. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|R

By using the iterative learning mechanics, two discrete-time DSC controllers are designed, which enable all {{distributed energy resources}} (DERs) in a MG to achieve the voltage/frequency restoration and active power sharing accuracy, respectively. In special, the secondary control inputs are merely updated {{at the end of}} each round of iteration, and thus each DER only needs to share information with its neighbors intermittently in a lowbandwidth communication manner. This way, the communication costs are greatly reduced, and some sufficient conditions on the system stability and robustness to the uncertainties are also derived by using the tools of Lyapunov stability theory, algebraic graph theory, and matrix inequality theory. The proposed controllers are implemented on local DERs, and thus no central controller is required. Moreover, the desired control objective can also be guaranteed even if all DERs are subject to internal uncertainties and external noises including initial voltage and/or frequency <b>resetting</b> <b>errors</b> and measurement disturbances, which then improves the system reliability and robustness.

Earlier we described a grandparental-origin-dependent sex-of-offspring-specific TRD of maternal chromosome 12 alleles closely linked to an imprinted region and hypothesized that it resulted from imprint <b>resetting</b> <b>errors</b> in the maternal germline. Here, we report that the genotype of the parents for loss-of-function mutations in the Dnmt 1 gene influences the transmission of grandparental chromosome 12 alleles. More specifically, maternal Dnmt 1 mutations restore Mendelian transmission ratios of chromosome 12 alleles. Transmission of maternal alleles depends upon {{the presence of the}} Dnmt 1 mutation in the mother rather than upon the Dnmt 1 genotype of the offspring. Paternal transmission mirrors the maternal one: live-born offspring of wild-type fathers display 1 : 1 transmission ratios, whereas offspring of heterozygous Dnmt 1 mutant fathers tend to inherit grandpaternal alleles. Analysis of allelic transmission in the homologous region of human chromosome 14 q 32 detected preferential transmission of alleles from the paternal grandfather to grandsons.

This technology has {{found its way into}} a number of areas, such as space missions, synchrotron light sources, and medical imaging. Nowadays, detectors and custom ICs are routine in high-energy physics applications. Electronic readout circuits have become a key part of every modern detector system. Many sensing circuits in detectors depend upon accumulating charge on a capacitor. The charge uncertainty on the capacitor when it is reset causes a signal <b>error</b> known as <b>reset</b> noise. Therefore, low noise readout circuitry capable of driving high input capacitance is essential for detector systems. A low noise pre-amplifier/amplifier readout circuitry has been designed and fabricated in 0. 13 um IBM CMOS 8 RF process technology. The pre-amplifier/ amplifier chain employs correlated double sampling at the input to suppress the kTC noise without any additional circuitry. In order to increase the signal-to-noise ratio, capacitive matching is used at the amplifier input. The experimental results of the signal processing chain employing capacitive matching and correlated double sampling show more than 60 times improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio over the same circuit without these improvements. In this dissertation a novel auto-zeroing technique is introduced as well. This technique uses a nulling point other than the amplifier's input and output to perform the auto-zeroing operation. The auto-zeroing is performed by taking advantage of emitter degeneration in the input transistor pair of the differential pair. For testing purposes this technique is implemented on a telescopic cascode differential amplifier.

By hijacking Lincolnshire’s visual culture, we aim to seize upon a newly collective situation in which the lines between 'here' and 'there' are dissolved. 'Airminded' has been produced by the The Society for Ontofabulatory Research, a group of academics, artists and writers based in Lincolnshire, UK. The film, which takes an essayistic form, explores the phenomenon of 'drone culture'. This phenomenon is especially pertinent to the filmmakers given that Lincolnshire's long historical association with aviation has led to the present situation in which a fleet of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, located in Afghanistan, are piloted from a Royal Air Force base in a quiet Lincolnshire village. Drone culture is, however, universal, and concerns more than just flight - it is a symptom of a new electronic space in which the distinction between 'here' and 'there' disappears. To explore this idea, the film is structured around aerial footage captured by flying over Lincolnshire, taking a route determined by maps of Afghanistan. This material is intercut with archive film, photographs, and animated sequences, all of which are set to an omnipresent drone soundtrack (scored by David McSherry, formerly of the band Fila Brazillia) and voices from both England and Afghanistan.
