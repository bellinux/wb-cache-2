40|$|Levels {{of fishing}} effort {{are defined as}} being {{excessive}} where they result in depletion of commercially valuable stocks and so threaten sustainable harvests. In many parts of Southeast Asia, this threat has been realized by {{the rapid expansion of}} commercial fisheries and the consequent increase in fishing effort. Southeast Asian fisheries are described as having a dualistic structure with distinct small-scale and large-scale subsectors. Competition and conflict between these subsectors is widespread and exacerbates the negative social consequences of excessive fishing effort. These include dissipation of resource rents, <b>gear</b> <b>conflicts</b> leading to broader social conflict, increased use of destructive fishing techniques, changes in the food supply and distribution channels (with disproportionate negative effects on rural populations), and increased concentration of economic power within the fisheries sector. Further, excessive fishing effort reduces incomes and standards of living for the majority of fishermen and undermines communitybased distributive and resource management mechanisms. The fundamental problems of fisheries management are inherently political, entailing issues of resource allocation and distributive equity. These problems are complicated by the role of fisheries as a social safety valve for the landless and the unemployed. As such, fisheries managment cannot be divorced from broader problems of Southeast Asian nations and are only solvdble within this larger context...|$|E
40|$|The American Samoa {{longline}} fleet expanded markedly in 2001. Prior to that, {{the fleet}} was comprised primarily of local catamaran alias (Figure 1 a) targeting South Pacific albacore (Thunnus alalunga) {{for the two}} canneries in American Samoa. The alias also caught bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus), yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares), skipjack (Katsuwonus pelamis),dolphin (Coryphaena hippurus), and wahoo (Acanthocybium solandri) for the canneries, local markets and subsistence. Generally 50 ’ in length, and possess modern communications and other fish-finding technology. The big boats also have freezers (blast or brine), whereas the alias have limited fish storage and carry little ice. The sudden entrance of big boats into the fleet is reflected in an abrupt {{increase in the number}} of hooks set/year, as well as an increase in albacore catches (Figure 2). Evolution of a Longline Fleet The entrance of big boats into American Samoa’s longline fleet has drawn considerable attention from fisheries managers, and a number of issues have arisen due to the increase in fleet size and capability. The Western Pacific Regional Fishery Management Council (WPRFMC) has classified these issues into three areas– avoiding <b>gear</b> <b>conflicts,</b> maintaining the potential for economically viable catch rates in the small-scale fishery, and maintaining cultural identity and dependence on ocean resources (WPRFMC 2000). A nearshore area closure has been implemented, and a limited entry system is being considered. It is hoped that these two management devices will prevent the issues from developing into problems.

40|$|This thesis {{scrutinize the}} insight from {{emerging}} theories on cooperation in common-pool resources. The models of co-management {{were inspired by}} examples of collective action among people, which is {{in stark contrast to}} the prominent tragedy of commons metaphor. The focus in this thesis is on the effect of technological change on the co-management of a natural renewable resource. The fishery of Lofoten is explored during the years 1864 – 1988, as this fishery has been regarded as an example of successful co-management. It had for instance a local governance structure that integrated the fishermen into the decision making process. Furthermore, the fishery of Lofoten is well documented with the annual Lofoten reports (Lofotberetningene). The data set is extracted from these unique historical documents. During the years of 1905 – 1920, a rapid technological progress occurred as the share of motorized vessels increased from 0 to 40 per cent. This period coincide with increasing violations of the co-management rules and regulations. A regression model is used to measure these violations, which serves as a proxy for defection in the co-management. The result shows that a shock in motorization was associated with a strong and significant effect on violations of the rules and regulations. Furthermore, it suggests that technological change affects the cooperation of a common-pool resource. The strain on cooperation would then increase because of the chances of higher effort and <b>gear</b> <b>conflicts</b> in the fishery, due to higher mobility and speed. The findings encompass the emerging theories, and it shows that a rapid technological change is associated with a significant eroding cooperation in a common-pool resource. It shows that the pressure towards stronger monitoring and enforcement is associated with increasing technological progress...|$|E

40|$|Marine reserves, areas {{permanently}} {{closed to}} all fishing, are frequently proposed {{as a tool}} for managing fisheries. Fishery benefits claimed for reserves include increases in spawning stock size, animal body size, and reproductive output of exploited species. Reserves are predicted to augment catches through export of offspring to fishing grounds, and spillover of juveniles and adults from reserves to fisheries. Protection of stocks and development of extended age structures of populations in reserves are argued to offer insurance against environmental variability and management failure. Models also suggest reserves will reduce year-to-year variability in catches, and offer greater simplicity of management and enforcement. Reserves are predicted to lead to habitat recovery from fishing disturbance which can also enhance benefits to fisheries. Extensive field research confirms many of these predictions. Reserves worldwide have led to increases in abundance, body size, biomass and reproductive output of exploited species. Such measures often increase many times over, sometimes by an order of magnitude or more. Population build up is usually rapid with effects detectable within 2 - 3 years of protection. Increases are often sustained over extended periods, particularly for longer-lived species and for measures of habitat recovery. Reserves have benefitted species from a wide taxonomic spectrum that covers most economically important taxa, including many species of fish, crustaceans, mollusks and echinoderms. Encouraged by these results, many countries and states have embarked upon initiatives to establish networks of marine reserves. However, reserves remain highly controversial among fishers and fishing industry bodies who argue that fishery benefits remain unproven. In the last three years there has been rapid {{growth in the number of}} cases where fisheries have been shown to benefit from reserves. In this report, we critically analyze this body of evidence, drawing upon studies of reserves and fishery closures. Fishery managers have long used fishery closures, areas temporarily closed to fishing for one or more species or to specific fishing gears. They are employed to help rebuild depleted stocks, reduce <b>gear</b> <b>conflicts,</b> protect vulnerable life stages of exploited species or protect sensitive habitats from damaging gears. Such areas can tell us much about the potential effects of marine reserves. Fishery benefits from reserves and fishery closures typically develop quickly, in most cases within five years of their creation. Perhaps the most persuasive evidence of fishery effects of reserves comes from changing fishing patterns. In most places where well-respected reserves or fishery closures exist, fishers tend to move their fishing activities closer to their boundaries. Fishing-the-line, as it is called, allows fishers to benefit from spillover of animals from reserves to fishing grounds. There are now well-documented cases of spillover from more than a dozen countries and including a wide range of species. It is more technically demanding to prove fishery enhancement through export of offspring on ocean currents. Existing reserves are generally small, making it hard to detect increased recruitment to fisheries at a regional scale. However, there are now several cases in which export of eggs and larvae have been confirmed, including dramatic enhancement of scallop fisheries in Georges Bank and clam fisheries in Fiji. Small reserves have worked well and repeatedly produce local benefits. However, regional fisheries enhancement will require more extensive networks of reserves. Some of the most convincing success stories come from places in which between 10 and 35 % of fishing grounds have been protected. In several cases there is evidence that yields with reserves have risen to higher levels than prior to protection, despite a reduction in the area of fishing grounds. In other cases, smaller reserves have stabilized catches from intensively exploited fisheries or slowed existing rates of decline. We describe experiences that prove that success of marine reserves is not contingent on habitat type, geographical location, the kind of fishery involved, or the technological sophistication of management. Reserve benefits are not restricted to habitats like coral reefs, or to artisanal fisheries, as some critics claim. Fishery benefits have been demonstrated from reserves established in tropical, warm- and cold-temperate waters, and in many habitats, including coral reefs, rocky reefs, kelp forests, seagrass beds, mangroves, estuaries, soft sediments, continental shelves and deep sea. Reserves and fishery closures have worked well for a wide range of fisheries, spanning recreational fisheries, artisanal fisheries like those of coral reefs, through small-scale nearshore fisheries for species like lobsters, up to industrial-scale fisheries for animals like flatfish and scallops. They have worked across a similarly broad spectrum of management sophistication, from self-policing by committed fishers, through warden patrols to satellite monitoring of distant fishing activities. We now have strong evidence that with the support of local communities, marine reserves offer a highly effective management tool. However, reserves will only rarely be adequate as a stand-alone management approach, although we describe cases where they have worked in the absence of other measures. They will be most effective when implemented as part of a package of limits on fishing effort and protect exploited species and their habitats...|$|E
40|$|In 1993, the Center for Marine Conservation (CMC), {{and other}} {{conservation}} organizations {{negotiated with the}} fishing industry to develop a proposal that {{became the basis for}} the 1994 amendments to the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (MMPA). 2 ̆ 7 The take reduction team process is a direct outgrowth of that negotiation. Both the fishing industry and conservation community believed it important to create a multi-party negotiation process to devise strategies for eliminating marine mammal entanglements in commercial fishing gear while maintaining the viability of commercial fisheries. Thus, the mediated take reduction team process was created. Despite difficulties in balancing both the need to reduce marine mammal kills and minimize economic impacts on fishermen, the take reduction team process has successfully produced consensus take reduction plans in three of the five take reduction teams, and has succeeded in establishing better working relationships among the different interest groups. Dialogue that would otherwise not have taken place has resulted in the development of creative research recommendations and strategies to reduce marine mammal entanglement in fishing gear. Facilitators have been essential {{to the success of the}} negotiation process; they helped to articulate and address participant concerns, moving participants from posturing to substance in a timely manner. In its evolution, the negotiation process clearly had its growing pains. Initially every take reduction team has to overcome obstacles such as lack of familiarity, acceptance and trust in order to develop a take reduction plan. The dynamics of each take reduction team was unique. The Gulf of Maine Harbor Porpoise Take Reduction Team (GOMTRT), for example, had a lengthy history together in its previous incarnation as the Harbor Porpoise Working Group; moreover, its actions were intimately tied to the New England Fishery Management Council 2 ̆ 7 s (NEFMC) ever-changing actions to recover groundfish stocks. While there was familiarity, the GOMTRT 2 ̆ 7 s plan was often overtaken by the actions of the NEFMC. In contrast, some members of the Atlantic Offshore Cetacean Take Reduction Team (AOCTRT) were from competing fisheries, a situation that generated suspicion and a general unwillingness to accept the basic premises, let alone the outcome resulting from the group process. Moreover, the debate was colored by the fact that National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) had closed at least one of the fisheries represented on the team and there were ongoing, pre-existing <b>gear</b> <b>conflicts</b> among the commercial fishing groups that had little to do with marine mammal conflicts. The Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Team (ALWTRT) was unable to reach a consensus due to insufficient negotiation time and the added pressures originating from an ongoing lawsuit on this issue. Yet, throughout all of this the system worked. The facilitators were essential in helping players get past these issues and move through posturing to substance. Those teams that moved quickly through their concerns about the quality of the science-the population and bycatch estimates and the calculation of Potential Biological Removal (PBR) -and into the development of take reduction strategies faired best in this process. Issues of team size and time available to negotiate were also critical. Smaller teams facilitated greater discussion and a sense that all participants could freely express their opinions. While the MMPA 2 ̆ 7 s six-month deadline pushed the teams to achieve consensus, participants cited, in two cases, it did not allow sufficient time for consensus to be reached. The process would benefit from two additional meetings-one to review the final plan before it is submitted to NMFS and another during the Evaluation of the Take Reduction Team Process comment period to allow the team to provide feedback to NMFS. In all situations the process provided a framework for dialogue among disparate groups-a dialogue that often resulted in creative research recommendations and strategies to reduce marine mammal entanglement in fishing gear. Adding to the difficulties of team dynamics is the large shift in emphasis from adversarial advocacy to a participatory planning process. The take reduction team process represents a new way of doing business for NMFS, fishermen, and conservation groups. NMFS is struggling with the implementation schedule mandated within the statutory timeframes; incorporation of take reduction plan recommendations into federal regulations, either under the authority of MMPA or through fishery management plans developed by the regional councils under the authority of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery and Conservation Management Act; the role of the take reduction team in the development of the regulations; and its level of commitment to this process and accountability to the take reduction team. NMFS has yet to realize that consensus is hard-won at all levels. In addition, NMFS has failed to recognize that this multi-party take reduction negotiation process is equally as important to participants as the fishery management council process. Consequently, if the take reduction team process is to be successful, NMFS must also adopt the view that this process is a high priority partnership among itself and all of the various stakeholders. It must expect no less from itself than any of the other active participants. NMFS representatives to the take reduction team must have the ability to both evaluate the consensus from a legal perspective and commit the agency to that consensus. This means that the Regional Administrator, a representative from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 2 ̆ 7 s (NOAA) Office of General Counsel, and a NMFS enforcement officer must be present at crucial times in the negotiating process. In order to prevent the entire process from being undermined, the NMFS representative cannot be passive, but instead must advise the team as to whether the consensus recommendation can be easily implemented and enforced, and whether the research recommendations are achievable. Otherwise team members may conclude the negotiation process and leave with false or unrealistic expectations, a result that undermines the process. To further meet its commitments, NMFS must also implement the take reduction plan within the statutory timeframes set out in the MMPA, provide the necessary resources to achieve, adequate levels of observer coverage, and carry out the research recommendations essential to inform take reduction strategies. These concerns highlight the need for greater resources to implement the take reduction plans but also a greater commitment on the part of NMFS to the process and the plans. Finally, although the take reduction plans have been in force for slightly over a year and some are showing some signs of success, it is too soon to assess the efficacy of the team consensus. Furthermore, when comparing the timetables for implementation of the take reduction plans to the timing of assessment of progress toward reducing takes to below PBR and achieving progress toward the zero mortality rate goal, it is clear that NMFS may not be able to fully evaluate progress under this regime at that time. Nevertheless, most participants look favorably upon the take reduction team process as an alternative to the traditional adversarial notice and comment rulemaking procedures...|$|E

40|$|The global fishing {{industry}} is facing unprecedented pressures. In the past (for {{a variety of}} reasons) the entire ocean was designated as a fishery using any gear type but increasingly this approach is untenable. The seas and the fishery (albeit through some strange legal mechanisms) belong to the public who are making a greater range of demands on their public resource than just fishery and navigation; marine conservation, oil exploration, windfarms and commercial dredging are all making a more complex environment for fishers to operate within and are causing increased scrutiny on the basic operational parameters of the {{fishing industry}}. For a variety of legal reasons ranging from marine protected area designations {{to the rights of}} the seabed owners it is no longer possible to use any gear type in any area without consideration of the ramifications on other users. Former legal loopholes relating to everything from health and safety to slavery are rapidly being closed in relation to fisheries as the ability to enforce against vessels at sea increases and legal norms are incorporated from elsewhere. Perhaps no fishery exemplifies the tensions generated by the former freedoms of the sea as much as the scallop fishery. The increasing use of subsea cabling, the establishment of marine protected areas and a larger array of zonal fisheries management measures have all brought scallop dredging into conflict with other marine users as well as increasing focus on <b>gear</b> <b>conflict</b> within the industry particularly those engaged in static fisheries. The introduction of effort controls for over 15 meter vessels via days at sea restrictions in 2015 and other technical measures are the first attempts to directly control the fishery but there {{is still a long way}} to go before the public endorsed uses of the sea (and the seabed) are properly protected from perceived wide rights granted to scallop dredgers.

Across 2 studies we examined the effect of controlled, dyadic interactions on attitudes towards the ‘other’ in members of groups involved in ideological conflict. Study 1 involved Mexican immigrants and White Americans in Arizona, and Study 2 involved Israelis and Palestinians in the Middle East. Cross-group dyads interacted via video and text in a brief, structured, face-to-face exchange: one person was assigned to write about the difficulties of life in their society (‘perspective-giving’), and the second person was assigned to accurately summarize the statement of the first person (‘perspective-taking’). Positive changes in attitudes towards the outgroup were greater for Mexican immigrants and Palestinians after perspective-giving and for White Americans and Israelis after perspective-taking. For Palestinians, perspective-giving to an Israeli effectively changed attitudes towards Israelis, while a control condition in which they wrote an essay on the same topic without interacting had no effect on attitudes, illustrating the critical role of being heard. Thus, the effects of dialogue for conflict resolution depend on an interaction between dialogue condition and participants' group membership, which may reflect power asymmetries.

40|$|Philosophiae Doctor - PhDIn this thesis, I examine {{household}} {{strategies in}} response to water level fluctuations of Lake Chilwa. I also analyse the frequency and patterns of migration of fishers, conflicts due to migration of fishers and comanagement. The following are the key results:First, the seasonal and periodic lake level changes affect livelihoods of the households. As a coping strategy, the households depend on fishing in pools of water located in influent rivers and hunt birds for income and food while others migrate to find work as casual labourers. When the lake rises during the rain season, inundated areas become suitable for production of maize and rice. However, when the floods recede in the dry season, farming of winter maize and vegetables is common. Second, migration of fishers is common around Lake Chilwa. The pattern of migration varies according to the season and gear type. The northern marshes and floodplain where fishers land the highest catches composed mainly of Barbus paludinosus, attract more fishers operating different fishing <b>gear</b> types. <b>Conflicts</b> emerge due to the Nkacha seine operations,which require removal of aquatic vegetation. The local fishers believe that the aquatic vegetation {{is a source of}} food for fish. The conflicts are in various forms including access to fishing grounds, authority to grant access to fishing areas and fish price competition between the local fishers and migrants. Third, the household strategies towards recovery of the fishery after recessions are inherent within the households’ traditional system. However, the introduction of co-management does not recognise key actors that include fishers and river-based fishing households that participated in the formulation of conservation strategies for remnant fish stocks in lagoon and rivers during the 1995 recession. Co-management is characterised by limited participation of the fishers especially those operating seines, district assemblies and non-governmental organisations. Similarly, there is low transparency especially with respect to how the key stakeholders, Department of Fisheries and traditional leaders, take decisions. In stark contrast, accountability among Beach Village Sub- Committees is growing; hence more fishing households now perceive these as representing the interests of Department of Fisheries. Based on the above results, a diversified occupational change involving fishing, farming and trading is necessary. The co-management arrangement should be adaptive with consideration of the traditional customs and values of the participating households. Since these households are dependent on the availability of fisheries, it is thus imperative to promote maximum resource exploitation in between recessions and encourage a complete stop to fishing during recessions.

We compared the population demographics of channel catfish in the Wabash River, Indiana, sampled with baited 25 - and 32 -mm-bar mesh hoop nets and three-phase alternating current (AC) electrofishing. Based on catch per unit effort, the relative abundance of channel catfish sampled with 32 -mm hoop nets was lower than that of fish sampled with 25 -mm hoop nets and AC electrofishing. Each gear type also resulted in a different length frequency, mean length increasing progressively in sampling with 25 -mm hoop nets, 32 -mm hoop nets, and AC electrofishing. Similarly, age-frequency distributions differed among gears. The 25 -mm hoop nets biased the age structure toward younger individuals (mean age = 2. 5), whereas both 32 -mm hoop nets (mean age = 4. 0) and AC electrofishing (mean age = 5. 8) included older fish. Catch-curve analysis generated different mortality rates for the three gear types, the mortality rate being highest (50 %) in fish sampled with 25 -mm hoop nets. Gear-specific size and age structures led to differences in von Bertalanffy statistics among the 25 -mm hoop nets and AC electrofishing, while the results for 32 -mm hoop nets were uninterpretable. Because the different <b>gears</b> led to <b>conflicting</b> parameter estimates, management practices based on sampling with single gears may be contradictory. Given the differences in gear selectivity, biologists need to approach management cautiously until calibration to the true size and age structure is conducted...|$|R
40|$|As pescarias no reservatório da UHE-Tucuruí no rio Tocantins, Pará, envolvem cerca de 6. 000 pescadores e movimentam cerca de R$ 4, 2 milhões/ano. A atividade se concentra em três espécies principais: tucunaré Cichla monoculus (capturado com anzol), pescada Plagioscion squamosissimus (capturado com rede e/ou anzol) e mapará Hypophthalmus marginatus (capturado com rede). Com o objetivo de caracterizar os pescadores e as pescarias do reservatório, criar cenários de aumento do esforço pesqueiro e prever os momentos de conflito pela escassez de recursos, foram levantadas informações da {{literatura}} e realizadas duas campanhas de coleta de dados nos anos de 1999 e 2000, envolvendo entrevistas com líderes comunitários e pescadores. As seguintes variáveis foram consideradas: desembarque por espécie-alvo (de acordo com os registros fornecidos pelas colônias de pescadores), artes de pesca, estratégias dos pescadores, conflitos e formas de apropriação do espaço e rendimentos da atividade. Estas variáveis foram inseridas em um modelo dinâmico, simulado no software Vensim PLE para um período de 10 anos a partir de 1999. Os resultados indicam que a pesca de anzol é a estratégia mais rentável, e que possíveis momentos de conflito devido à escassez de recursos podem acontecer em curto prazo (2005). A metodologia utilizada para as simulações e análises de risco também se revelou adequada à realidade local e ao conjunto de dados disponíveis. The {{fisheries in}} the reservoir of UHE-Tucuruí employ about 6. 000 fishermen generating approximately R$ 4. 2 million/year. There are three main target-species: Tucunaré Cichla monoculus (caught with hook and line), Pescada Plagioscion squamosissimus (caught with gill net and/or hook and line) and Mapará Hypophthalmus marginatus (caught with gill net). Published information was reviewed and data collected during two field trips in 1999 and 2000 that included interviews with community leaders and fishermen. The aims were: {{to get information}} on the reservoir fisheries and fishermen; create scenarios of fishing effort increase; and, forecast potential conflicts due {{to the collapse of}} resources. The following variables were considered: target-species landings (data records supplied by the fishermen's associations), fishing <b>gear,</b> fishing strategies, <b>conflicts,</b> fishing spot allocation systems, and income. These variables, covering a period of 10 years starting from 1999, were entered into a dynamic model, simulated with the Vensim PLE software. The results indicate that the hook and line fishery is the most profitable, and potential conflicts due to resource scarcity could occur in short time (2005). The methodology used for the simulations and risk analysis was found to be suitable for the local reality and available data set...|$|R
