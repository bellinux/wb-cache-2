40|$|Over the years, {{military}} exercises {{have proven to}} increase our country’s effectiveness in actual missions. However, the <b>exercise</b> <b>planning</b> process is a time consuming activity that can span anywhere from months to years. Scenarios are often used during C 2 <b>exercise</b> <b>planning</b> and execution to portray training tasks {{in the context of}} real-world situations. Exercise scenarios typically originate as a few high level paragraphs or pages of textual and/or graphical information and evolve into very detailed events as the <b>exercise</b> <b>planning</b> process progresses. The development of a detailed scenario to support an exercise is a time consuming process that often accounts for {{a large portion of the}} <b>exercise</b> <b>planning</b> cycle. Thus, there is a need for technology that enhances the <b>exercise</b> <b>planning</b> process by shortening the amount of time it takes to create and validate detailed exercise scenarios against training tasks and available resources. This paper discusses the capabilities of the Air Defense <b>Exercise</b> <b>Planning</b> Tool (ADEPT). The goal of the ADEPT technology is to shorten the <b>exercise</b> <b>planning</b> cycle by providing automated scenario development, analysis and generation capabilities. In addition, the paper addresses current limitations of existing scenario technology, the results of small pilot project and future capabilities for ADEPT. 1...|$|R
40|$|Good {{physical}} fitness generally makes the body {{less prone to}} common diseases. A personalized <b>exercise</b> <b>plan</b> that promotes a balanced approach to fitness helps promotes fitness, while inappropriate forms of exercise can have adverse consequences for health. This paper aims to develop an ontology-driven knowledge-based system for generating custom-designed <b>exercise</b> <b>plans</b> based on a user’s profile and health status, incorporating international standard Health Level Seven International (HL 7) data on {{physical fitness}} and health screening. The generated plan exposing Representational State Transfer (REST) style web services which can be accessed from any Internet-enabled device and deployed in cloud computing environments. To ensure the practicality of the generated <b>exercise</b> <b>plans,</b> encapsulated knowledge used {{as a basis for}} inference in the system is acquired from domain experts. The proposed Ubiquitous <b>Exercise</b> <b>Plan</b> Generation for Personalized Physical Fitness (UFIT) will not only improve health-related fitness through generating personalized <b>exercise</b> <b>plans,</b> but also aid users in avoiding inappropriate work outs...|$|R

40|$|This thesis aims {{to create}} <b>exercise</b> <b>plans</b> for {{patients}} with low back pain and {{is a part of}} the research project selfBACK. Case-based reasoning is used to create the <b>exercise</b> <b>plans,</b> which is the process of solving new problems by reusing solutions of similar previous problems. The main focus of the thesis is to explore how the reused solutions can be adapted to fit the needs of the patient better. Different adaptation methods are explored, and two methods are applied within the SELFBACK setting. In the experiments, the solutions created by the adaptation methods are evaluated against solutions where no adaptation is performed. The results of the experiments show promising results, indicating that adaptation further improves the creation of <b>exercise</b> <b>plans...</b>|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} (Validation <b>Exercise</b> <b>Plan),</b> as {{output of}} Task 5. 1, {{points out the}} GAMMA validation objectives (Chapter 3) and strategy (Chapter 4). Then, the validation scenarios are identified (Chapter 5) and the <b>exercise</b> <b>plans</b> are defined (Chapter 6). Thereby, the GAMMA validation activities will mainly follow the procedure advocated in the European standard E-OCVM. However, the procedure will be slightly adapted in order to consider the experiences made by the partners in other projects. The GAMMA validation strategy is, thus, {{a combination of a}} well-accepted European standard and best practice. The Validation <b>Exercise</b> <b>Plan</b> is a document containing all relevant planning information to be considered in the execution of the validation exercises (WP 9), including the Validation Scenarios Definition and Description...|$|R
