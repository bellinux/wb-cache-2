25|$|While the {{earthquake}} {{quickly became the}} only subject on talkback radio, other early coverage relied on comments from Police and other 24-hour services who were immediately affected and needed {{to communicate with the}} media. Because {{the earthquake}} occurred early on a Saturday morning, with only overnight staff on duty, it took several hours for some media outlets to give the event full live coverage. So it took until mid-morning for some media outlets to have sufficient stories and staff on duty to allow them to commence continuous live broadcasts. One television producer later observed that if the earthquake had happened just a few hours earlier, or later, they would have had a full studio crew on duty and have been able to <b>go</b> <b>live</b> immediately.|$|E

Quinn considered delaying the Steam release, as {{she did not want to}} be seen as taking advantage of Williams' death. She eventually decided to keep to the original release schedule, as she thought that making the game available to those struggling with their own problems was more important than any negative publicity she might receive, writing, [...] "I can’t in good conscience hold back offering someone something that could help them start making real changes in their life for the sake of reducing the risk of offending people or hurting my own reputation." ...|$|E
500|$|Fark tweaked {{its site}} design {{a little more}} on June 1, 2011, with the comment, [...] "Fark's {{redesign}} will <b>go</b> <b>live</b> at 5PM EST. Heads-up {{for those of you}} who missed the other warning threads and need a place to completely lose your mind." [...] Having learned from the controversy caused by the 2007 redesign, Curtis introduced the new site as a preview one week (two weeks for TotalFark users) prior to June 1, to allow users to comment on the changes and provide feedback on where things were broken. The primary reason for the redesigned site is to make it easier to use and more intuitive. The site's tagline was changed from [...] "It's not news, it's FARK" [...] to [...] "We don't make news. We mock it." [...] The music tab was also dropped, due to low usage – content was rolled into the Showbiz or Video tab, where most of the content was already cross-posted anyway. An overhaul to the Fark Mobile Web site was not done at this time, but Curtis did say that small changes would be implemented over time to make the mobile site more consistent with the overall design of the new site.|$|E
500|$|On December 20, 2014, {{the album}} was made {{available}} for pre-order at the iTunes Store. When ordered, six tracks (five in the United Kingdom) were automatically downloaded.

Originally, [...] "Living for Love" [...] was intended to serve as the lead single from the album. It was to be released on Valentine's Day, {{with the rest of the}} record slated for the spring. However, due to the leak, the release date had to be pushed up. Oseary recalled that they did not receive a confirmation until Friday night whether the pre-release could be executed, since iTunes was closing for the Christmas weekend.
