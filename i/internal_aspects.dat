5|$|The central {{image of}} The Dry Salvages is {{water and the}} sea. The images {{are similar to the}} Odyssey but {{represent}} <b>internal</b> <b>aspects.</b> Humanity loses itself to technology and theories like evolution that separate mankind philosophically from the past. According to Eliot, within each man there is a connection to all of mankind. If we just accept drifting upon the sea, then we will end up broken upon rocks. We are restrained by time, but the Annunciation gave mankind hope that {{he will be able to}} escape. This hope is not part of the present. What we must do is understand the patterns found within the past to see that there is meaning to be found. This meaning allows one to experience eternity through moments of revelation. Through Christ, we are able to overcome time unless we do not know him. Our corruption can be overcome and that we are able to join the eternal.|$|E
5|$|Gender plays a {{large role}} within Fielding's moral critique, and effeminacy is a means to emphasise a male character's moral {{shortcomings}} or problematic deviations from social and cultural traditions. Starting with Love in Several Masques, the stock characters that he relies on emphasise the deviations by recalling traditional behavioural stereotypes and in their commentary on the masculinity or femininity of other characters. The political implications for gender extend to a criticism of powerful female within the domestic and public domains. Many of the problems portrayed within the plays are {{the results of the}} domestic sphere extended into politics, especially within Tom Thumb. As Jill Campbell points out, not only does Fielding critique women in power, but the reversals of gender and power serve as a way to say that private concerns are taking priority over public concerns. In his plays and his novels, women are used as a way to discuss the <b>internal</b> <b>aspects</b> of humans, which includes both emotions and morality. Although Fielding sometimes uses females to express ideal ways to act, he does mock women who abuse their relationship with the internal, emotions, and morality to dominate and assume power. This theme appears as early as Love in Several Masques and continues throughout, especially in prose parody Shamela where Shamela falsifies claims to virtue to control and get ahead in life.|$|E
500|$|Wisemore is not {{the only}} one to serve as a means to comment on society; the {{characters}} Vermilia and Lady Matchless are used to discuss the proper role of females within society by serving as housewives. The dialogue between the two reveals that females are only in control of the domestic sphere because men have allowed them to dominate in the area. This is not to suggest that Fielding supports the repression of females; instead, women are used as a way to discuss the <b>internal</b> <b>aspects</b> of humans including both emotions and morality. However, feminist critic Jill Campbell points out that Fielding does mock women who abuse their relationship with the internal, emotions, and morality in order to dominate and assume power. Tiffany Potter, another feminist critic, sees gender within the play in a different light; Merital's actions and words show a moderate approach to females, and [...] "Women are neither victims of deceitful men nor overdefensive virgins, but individuals who can choose to 'bestow' their favours on a man who will 'enjoy' them." ...|$|E

50|$|There are two {{perspectives}} to this: {{the external}} aspect, {{which is the}} independently observable fact that people do tend to obey the rule with regularity, and the <b>internal</b> <b>aspect</b> which is the feeling by an individual of being in some sense obligated to follow the rule, otherwise known as the critical reflective attitude. It is from this internal sense that the law acquires its normative quality. The obedience by the populace of a rule is called efficacy. No law {{can be said to}} be efficacious unless followed by the majority of the populace. Though an average citizen in a modern state with a developed legal system may feel the <b>internal</b> <b>aspect</b> and be compelled to follow the laws, it is more important for the officials of the society/peoples to have the <b>internal</b> <b>aspect</b> since it is up to them to follow the constitutional provisions which, if they wish, could ignore without accountability. Yet, the officials must use the <b>internal</b> <b>aspect</b> and accept the standards as guiding their behaviour in addition to also guiding the behaviour of other officials.|$|R
40|$|One of HLA Hart’s main {{contributions}} to jurisprudence is {{his theory of}} social rules.

Drawing on recent work {{in the philosophy of}} action, I argue that the <b>internal</b> <b>aspect</b> of social rules is best thought of as the widespread ‘acceptance’ that an action should be performed. The technical notion of acceptance I rely on is related to Hart’s own understanding of acceptance, but the two differ in several important respects...|$|R

30|$|When the genitofemoral nerve is affected, {{the pain}} may be {{localized}} in the inguinal area and may radiate to the <b>internal</b> <b>aspect</b> of the thigh {{and to the}} genital area. Lesions of the genital branch of the genitofemoral nerve induce vulvodynia or pudendal pain located selectively in the anterior portion of the vulva (clitoris). Surgical access to the inguinal region (appendectomy, herniorraphia, introduction of lateral trocar for laparoscopy, etc.) exposes patients to a risk of injury to the genitofemoral nerve. Neurologic symptoms are then restricted to sensory changes located in the groin area, the ventral genital area (as in lesion of the ventral branch of the PN), and/or the <b>internal</b> <b>aspect</b> of the tight (lesion of the femoral branch) but never below the knee. Since the genital branch is only sensitive in females, neither bladder dysfunction nor urinary incontinence occurs. Inguinal nerve block with an anesthetic agent is the diagnostic method of choice.|$|R
40|$|H. L. A. Hart {{thought that}} a theory of law can be purely {{descriptive}} and called his theory a “descriptive sociology”. One of his great contributions to modern legal theory is his emphasis on the <b>internal</b> <b>aspect</b> of social rules. According to him, a theory of law can be built {{on the basis of}} the description of the participants’ view without sharing with it. This descriptivism is totally rejected by Dworkin, who propagates a theory that denies a sharp separation between a legal theory and its implications for adjudication. For Dworkin, a legal theory is only possible as a theory with “the internal, participants’ point of view”. Dworkin’s position implies a radicalization of legal theory that will transform the statement of an external point of view to that of an internal one. For Dworkin, the descriptivism bases on the sociological concept of law, which is an “imprecise criterial concept” and is “not sufficiently precise to yield philosophically interesting essential features. ”Hart’s position is vulnerable because it takes an impure form of descriptivism that still draws a categorical distinction between fact and norm. This theoretical impurity results from the ambiguity of interpreting the <b>internal</b> <b>aspect</b> of rules. A strategy to rescue the Hart’s project is to radicalize his descriptivism with Luhmann's systems theory. Adapting the systems theoretical distinction between internal and external observation of law with all its implications for the explanation of the legal system and legal communications, Hart’s descriptivism finally attains its pure form, which is not only a distinctive paradigm of legal theory, but also possesses the potentialities to clarify its relationship to the legal theory based on the <b>internal</b> <b>aspect</b> of law...|$|R
