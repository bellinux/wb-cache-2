25|$|Named to honour the company's twenty-fifth anniversary, in 1988, the 25th Anniversary Countach, {{although}} mechanically {{very similar}} to the 5000QV, sported considerable restyling. Notably, restyling, enlargement and extension of the rear 'air-box' intake-ducts was among other refinements undertaken (extending them to a more gradual incline further in-keeping with aerodynamic-streamlining), while the secondary pair of <b>debossed</b> ducts, originally situated further behind them, were brought forward and relocated directly on top, encompassing refashioned fins now running longitudinally rather than transversely, this allowed the airboxes, located behind the radiators to be rotated from a transverse to a longitudinal position, allowing better airflow from the radiators out through the secondary fins. Additionally, further reconstruction of an already modified engine-bay cover, from a concept consisting of dual-raised sections and tri-ducting, to one that embodies a centre-raised section incorporating dual-ducting become another feature. Various redevelopments to the rear-end were made; most notably the introduction of a rear bumper extending outwardly from the lower-portion.|$|E

50|$|High Lift Digital Embossing is {{absolutely}} stunning. It has {{the excitement of}} a spot UV varnished, embossed job but with perfect registration and without the matching, deep <b>deboss</b> on the reverse of the sheet below the embossing.|$|R
50|$|The {{machines}} used {{in making}} Addressograph plates would <b>deboss</b> (pressed into the plate) the letters into the plate {{resulting in a}} well defined printing surface resembling the typewriter fonts of the day on the reverse side {{that would be used}} to transfer the details (usually customer addresses) onto envelopes or form letters. The same style was used in the early 40's to 80's for the US military identification tags and the tag details could be transferred onto medical charts using a hand held imprinter in field hospital conditions.|$|R
5000|$|... "Debossing" [...] {{is similar}} to embossing, but {{recesses}} the design rather than raising it. Rather than the paper being raised in specific areas, it is indented. The process involves applying pressure to the front side of a substrate and forcing the material down from the surface. Although {{it is not as}} common as embossing, it is occasionally used to provide a different effect or appearance that fits a particular theme. Embossing and <b>debossing</b> on digitally printed applications is an off-line process, which may add a significant cost to the job.|$|R
50|$|In reality, {{the notch}} was {{used with the}} Model 70 Addressograph Hand Identification Imprinting Machine (a pistol-type {{imprinter}} used primarily by the Medical Department during World War II). American dogtags of the 1930s through 1970s were produced using a Graphotype machine, in which characters are <b>debossed</b> into metal plates. Some tags are still <b>debossed,</b> using earlier equipment, and some are embossed (with raised letters) on computer-controlled equipment.|$|E
50|$|A {{persistent}} rumor is that <b>debossed</b> (imprinted with stamped in letters) dog tags {{were issued}} from World War II {{till the end}} of the Vietnam War and that currently the U.S. Armed Forces is issuing embossed (imprinted with raised letters) dog tags. In actuality, the U.S. Armed Forces issues dog tags with both types of imprinting, depending on the machine used at a given facility. The military issued 95% of their identification tags up until recently (within the past 10 years) with <b>debossed</b> text.|$|E
50|$|Embossing and {{debossing}} are {{the processes}} of creating either raised or recessed relief images and designs in paper and other materials. An embossed pattern is raised against the background, while a <b>debossed</b> pattern is sunken into {{the surface of the}} material (but might protrude somewhat on the reverse, back side).|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{effects of}} process {{parameters}} such as laser power, scanning velocity and wire feeding speed on weld joint quality {{has been discussed}} through some laser welding experiments using coaxial inside-beam wire feeding process method. The results reveal that: Along {{with the increase of}} the laser power, weld width and depth are increasing gradually; Coating surface will appear burning loss and <b>deboss</b> when laser power is too large. The increase of scanning velocity decreases the depth and width of molten bath, and abates laser hole-effect, so the metal plate can not be welded penetration. Larger wire feeding speed can avoid welding seam produce burning loss, but it also can strengthen welding wire reflect the laser, and decline the welding...|$|R
5000|$|The {{album cover}} for One of These Nights {{is the last}} Eagles album design on which Burden was involved. He made the skull stand up off the page by <b>debossing</b> large areas {{together}} with detailed and elaborate embossing in the wings and feathers. According to Burden, the cover image represents where the band was coming from and {{where they were going}} [...] - [...] "The cow skull is pure cowboy, folk, the decorations are American Indian inspired and the future is represented by the more polished reflective glass beaded surfaces covering the skull. All set against the dark eagle feather wings that speak of mysterious powers." [...] The album artwork received a Grammy nomination for Best Album Package.|$|R
50|$|An Addressograph {{system of}} the 1960s was {{essentially}} a Graphotype <b>debossing</b> machine for preparing address plates, a cassette-style plate feeder, a heavy-duty, rapidly moving inked ribbon, a platten for hand-feeding the mail piece, and a foot pedal for stamping the address. The individual steel address plates were inserted into card-sized frames which {{had a series of}} slots along the top where colored metal flags could also be inserted for sorting purposes. The plate assemblies were placed in steel cassettes resembling library card catalogue drawers, which were manually inserted into the machine. At the press of the foot pedal the plate assemblies were swapped in sequence in a similar fashion to a slide projector, placing an impression of the raised type onto the mail piece.|$|R
50|$|In December 2003 a 2005-dated {{base was}} {{introduced}} for new registrations. Beginning at approximately AVA 0001, the <b>debossed</b> left sticker box was removed, as in approximately November 2006 the state {{switched to a}} single sticker displaying both month and year of expiry, a practice that would be continued on the 2007 base.|$|E
5000|$|The cover art {{was painted}} by New York City minimalist line painter Jon McCafferty. Promotional {{copies of the}} album were housed in a mauve, cloth-covered Digipack, with the title and artist <b>debossed</b> and a number [...] "4" [...] {{embossed}} over both of the [...] "R"s.

50|$|This edition {{featured}} new sculpts {{designed specifically}} for Space Hulk, instead of being shared with the sets for the tabletop game Warhammer 40,000. Advancements in sculpting and moulding have allowed Games Workshop's Alex Hedstr√∂m to add a greater level of detail to the miniatures. Each of the twelve miniatures representing Terminators has a distinct appearance, such as Brother Omnio being shown consulting a scanner mounted in his Power Fist. The miniatures representing Genestealers were posing in varied poses - with one bursting {{up from the floor}} and another climbing down from the wall. The counters and the board sections of the game were made using new <b>debossing</b> techniques which applied shallow depressions into the cardboard. These board sections were additionally much thicker and heavier than those of previous editions. The Games Workshop studio and box art represents the Blood Angels Space Marine Chapter.|$|R
5000|$|Cookie mould: Usually made of wood, ceramic, or plastic. Springerle moulds are {{the oldest}} {{examples}} of such, and are popular for Scottish shortbread. [...] A cookie mould typically has an ornate design <b>debossed</b> into the surface; the mould is {{pressed into the}} cookie dough to produce an embossed design.

50|$|In the Graphotype process, {{commonly}} used commercially {{from the early}} 1900s through the 1980s, a debossing machine was used to stamp characters into metal plates; the plates could then be used to repetitively stamp such things as addresses onto paper {{in the same way}} that a typewriter functions, except that a single stroke of the printer could produce a block of text, rather than requiring each character to be printed individually. The debossing process creates durable, easily legible metal plates, well-suited for military identification tags, leading to adoption of the system by the American military. It was also realized that <b>debossed</b> tags can function the same way the original Graphotype plates do.|$|E
50|$|You can {{distinguish}} a traditional letterpress printer from a digital printer by its <b>debossed</b> lettering. A traditional letterpress printer made a heavy impression into {{the stock and}} producing any indentation at all into the paper {{would have resulted in}} the print run being rejected. Part of the skill of operating a traditional letterpress printer was to get the machine pressures just right so that the type just kissed the paper transferring the minimum amount of ink to create the crispest print with no indentation. This was very important as when the print exited the machine and was stacked having too much wet ink and an indentation would have increased the risk of set-off (ink passing from the front of one sheet onto the back of the next sheet on the stack).|$|E
5000|$|Crazy Clown Times sleeve {{artwork and}} booklet were {{designed}} by graphic artists Chris Bigg and Vaughan Oliver of v23 under direction from Lynch; Lynch designed several pieces of additional artwork. The [...] "Super-Deluxe" [...] edition, released in 2012, is packaged in a red-leatherette book [...] "and a rigid black suedelle slipcase for maximum tactile effect". Describing the process of designing the packaging, Oliver said: [...] "I was aiming for a sexy, kitsch quality with the black suede slipcase and red foil-blocked type. The book that slides out enhances this concept with a red leatherette finish and silver clothed spine whilst adding an 'art book' touch with the 'tipped in' image of the red die set into a <b>debossed</b> square centred on the book cover. The overall effect exudes, sex, sleaze and 'roulette wheel' ambience." ...|$|E
50|$|In the front, the Marauder shares {{most of its}} trim {{with the}} Grand Marquis; much of the rear and side trim is shared with the Crown Victoria. Both bumpers are unique to the Marauder; the rear {{features}} the model name <b>debossed</b> on the bumper and is redesigned to accommodate the larger Megs tailpipe tips. The front bumper was redesigned with a central air intake added to improve engine ventilation along with twin Cibi√© fog lamps. The headlight and corner light lenses (from the Grand Marquis) had their non-reflective surfaces blacked out and the grille was painted black with a body-color surround. The taillight and reverse light lenses (from the Crown Victoria) were dark-tinted to the minimum of DOT standards. Unique to the Marauder, the center caps of wheels featured a revival of a 1960s Mercury logo (a silhouette of the Roman god Mercury).|$|E

40|$|Tablets are {{the most}} popular solid dosage form in the {{pharmaceutical}} industry because they are cheap to manufacture, chemically and mechanically stable and easy to transport and fairly easy to control dosage. Pharmaceutical tableting operations have been around for decades however the process is still not well understood. One of the common problems faced during the production of pharmaceutical tablets by powder compaction is sticking of powder to the punch face, This is known as 2 ÃÜ 7 sticking 2 ÃÜ 7. A more specialized case of sticking is picking when the powder is pulled away form the compact in the vicinity of <b>debossed</b> features. In the pharmaceutical industry, picking is solved by trial and error which is an expensive, labor intensive and time consuming affair. ^ The objective of this work was to develop, validate, and implement a modeling framework for predicting picking in powder compacts. The model was developed in Abaqus a commercially available finite element package. The resulting model was used to investigate the influence of <b>debossed</b> feature geometry viz. the stroke angle and degree of pre-pick, and, influence of lubricant on picking.

40|$|The {{compaction}} behaviour of {{a commercial}} granulated clay (magnesium aluminium smectite, gMgSm) was investigated using macroscopic pressure-density measurements, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray microtomography (XŒºT) and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). This material was studied as a potential compaction excipient for pharmaceutical tabletting, {{but also as a}} model system demonstrating the capabilities of SAXS for investigating compaction in other situations. Bulk compaction measurements showed that the gMgSm was more difficult to compact than polymeric pharmaceutical excipients such as spheronised microcrystalline cellulose (sMCC), corresponding to harder granules. Moreover, in spite of using lubrication (magnesium stearate) on the tooling surfaces, rather high ejection forces were observed, which may cause problems during commercial tabletting, requiring further amelioration. Although the compacted gMgSm specimens were more porous, however, they still exhibited acceptable cohesive strengths, comparable to sMCC. Hence, there may be scope for using granular clay as one component of a tabletting formulation. Following principles established in previous work, SAXS revealed information concerning the intragranular structure of the gMgSm and its response to compaction. The results showed that little compression of the intragranular morphology occurred below a relative density of 0 ¬∑ 6, suggesting that granule rearrangements or fragmentation were the dominant mechanisms during this stage. By contrast, granule deformation became considerably more important at higher relative density, which also coincided with {{a significant increase in the}} cohesive strength of compacted specimens. Spatially-resolved SAXS data was also used to investigate local variations in compaction behaviour within specimens of different shape. The results revealed the expected patterns of density variations within flat-faced cylindrical specimens. Significant variations in density, the magnitude of compressive strain and principal strain direction were also revealed in the vicinity of a <b>debossed</b> feature (a diametral notch) and within bi-convex specimens. The variations in compaction around the <b>debossed</b> notch, with a small region of high density below and low density along the flanks, appeared to be responsible for extensive cracking, which could also cause problems in commercial tabletting...|$|E
