2500|$|The scandal had {{a devastating}} effect upon Pisemsky, who [...] "has {{fallen into a}} state of total apathy, as <b>he</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> in {{difficult}} times," [...] according to Lev Anninsky. Retired from his position at Biblioteka Dlya Chtenya, he severed all ties with literary Saint Petersburg {{and at the end of}} 1862 moved to Moscow, where he spent the rest of his life. Pisemsky worked in a hectic manner, devoting the whole of 1862 to Troubled Seas. Of this book's background Pyotr Boborykin wrote: [...] "A journey abroad, to the London exhibition, meeting Russian émigrés there, and hearing many curious stories and anecdotes concerning the propagandists of those times confirmed Pisemsky in his decision to paint a broader picture of Russian society, and I don't doubt the sincerity with which he embarked upon this task." [...] Indeed, in April 1862 Pisemsky went abroad and in June visited Alexander Herzen in London so as to explain his position towards the revolutionary democratic press. He failed to get any support, though.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the seventh}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), chapter [...] when the Pharaoh's butler and baker {{offended}} him, the Pharaoh {{put them into}} the prison as well. One night, the butler and the baker each dreamed a dream. Finding them sad, Joseph asked the cause, and they {{told him that it}} was because no one could interpret their dreams. Acknowledging that interpretations belong to God, Joseph asked them to tell him their dreams. The butler told Joseph that he dreamt that he saw a vine with three branches blossom and bring forth grapes, which he took and pressed into Pharaoh's cup, which he gave to Pharaoh. Joseph interpreted that within three days, Pharaoh would lift up the butler's head and restore him to his office, where he would give Pharaoh his cup just as <b>he</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> And Joseph asked the butler to remember him and mention him to Pharaoh, so that he might be brought out of the prison, for he had been stolen away from his land and had done nothing to warrant his imprisonment. When the baker saw that the interpretation of the butler's dream was good, he told Joseph his dream: He saw three baskets of white bread on his head, and the birds ate them out of the basket. Joseph interpreted that within three days Pharaoh would lift up the baker's head and hang him on a tree, and the birds would eat his flesh. In the maftir (...) reading that concludes the parashah, on the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday, Pharaoh made a feast, restored the chief butler to his butlership, and hanged the baker, just as Joseph had predicted. But the butler forgot about Joseph. The seventh reading ( [...] , aliyah), the third open portion ( [...] , petuchah), chapter [...] and the parashah end here.|$|E
