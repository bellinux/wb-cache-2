5|$|Sallekhana {{differs from}} {{other forms of}} ritual deaths {{recognized}} in Jainism as appropriate. The other situations consider ritual death to be better for a mendicant than breaking his or her Five Great vows (Mahavrata). For example, celibacy {{is one of the}} Five vows, and ritual death is considered better than being raped or seduced or if the mendicant community would be <b>defamed.</b> A ritual death under these circumstances by consuming poison is believed to be better and allows for an auspicious rebirth.|$|E

25|$|Most {{defendants}} in defamation lawsuits are newspapers or publishers, which {{are involved in}} about twice as many lawsuits as are television stations. Most plaintiffs are corporations, businesspeople, entertainers and other public figures, and people involved in criminal cases, usually defendants or convicts but sometimes victims as well. In no state can a defamation claim be successfully maintained if the allegedly <b>defamed</b> person is deceased.|$|E

Because of the outbreak of World War II, this agreement was only partially carried out.|$|E
25|$|Ding Feng died in 271. His {{cause of}} death was not {{recorded}} in history. In his later years, Ding Feng gradually became arrogant as he achieved more glory for his contributions on the battlefield. He was slandered and <b>defamed</b> by others after his death. However, Sun Hao still recognised Ding Feng for his meritorious service, so he did not massacre Ding's family and instead exiled them to Linchuan (臨川; commandery capital in present-day Linchuan District, Fuzhou, Jiangxi).|$|E
25|$|It was {{subsequently}} alleged by Meissner, {{who was at}} the time secretary of the Enmore branch of the Labor Party and one of the central figures in the controversy, that the bashing was undertaken by Domican, an underworld figure with close links to the right-wing faction of NSW Labor, acting on suggestions from Richardson.

Community radio stations throughout the country stopped broadcasting on June 17 to protest the conviction and other press freedom cases. No further information was available at year's end.|$|E
25|$|The {{hate speech}} laws in France are matters of both civil law and {{criminal}} law. Those laws protect {{individuals and groups}} from being <b>defamed</b> or insulted because they belong or do not belong, in fact or in fancy, to an ethnicity, a nation, a race, a religion, a sex, or a sexual orientation, or {{because they have a}} handicap. The laws forbid any communication which is intended to incite discrimination against, hatred of, or harm to, anyone because of his belonging or not belonging, in fact or in fancy, to an ethnicity, a nation, a race, a religion, a sex, or a sexual orientation, or because he or she has a handicap.|$|E
25|$|According to § 194 {{the charge}} of insult (slander) can only be prosecuted if the <b>defamed</b> person chooses to press charges. False {{imprisonment}} can be charged if the victim—when applying an objective view—can {{be considered to be}} impaired in his or her rights of free movement. According to § 228 of the German criminal code a person inflicting a bodily injury on another person with that person's permission violates the law only in cases where the act can be considered to have violated good morals in spite of permission having been given. On 26 May 2004 the Criminal Panel No. 2 of the Bundesgerichtshof (German Federal Court) ruled that sado-masochistically motivated physical injuries are not per se indecent and thus subject to § 228.|$|E
25|$|Ellison, {{after reading}} {{unpublished}} drafts {{of the book}} on Fantagraphics's website, believed {{that he had been}} <b>defamed</b> by several anecdotes related to this incident. He sued in the Superior court for the State of California, in Santa Monica. Fantagraphics attempted to have the lawsuit dismissed. In their motion to dismiss, Fantagraphics argued that the statements were both their personal opinions and generally believed to be true anecdotes. On February 12, 2007, the presiding judge ruled against Fantagraphics' anti-SLAPP motion for dismissal. On June 29, 2007, Ellison claimed that the litigation had been resolved pending Fantagraphics' removal of all references to the case from their website. No money or apologies changed hands in the settlement as posted on August 17, 2007.|$|E
25|$|On 16 July 2008 the Malaysian {{police have}} {{obtained}} a warrant of arrest against Raja Petra for criminal defamation. This {{is due to}} his statutory declaration connecting Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak’s wife, Datin Seri Rosmah Mansor, saying she was present when Mongolian national Altantunya Shaariibuu’s body was blown up. On 17 July, Raja Petra was charged with three counts of criminal intimidation over his statutory declaration on the murder of Mongolian translator Altantuya Shaariibuu. He {{is alleged to have}} <b>defamed</b> Deputy Prime Minister's wife Datin Seri Rosmah Mansor by making a libellous statement in the declaration which he affirmed on 18 June when he knew that it would tarnish her good name. He also faced similar charges against Kolonel Norhayati Hassan and her husband Acting Kolonel Abdul Aziz Buyong.|$|E
25|$|Milkovich filed suit, {{alleging that}} the {{suggestion}} that he had lied had <b>defamed</b> him. Since perjury is a felony in Ohio, the statements {{were found to be}} defamatory and Milkovich was ruled a private figure, both of which were helpful to his case. However, the trial court granted a directed verdict in favor of the newspaper since it found Diadiun's column to be a statement of opinion, which cannot be libelous, {{and that there was no}} actual malice, per Sullivan. Milkovich appealed to the Ohio Eleventh District Court of Appeals, which found that there was actual malice. In turn, the newspaper appealed to the state Supreme Court, which dismissed it on the grounds that there were no significant constitutional issues. In 1979 the U.S. Supreme Court denied certiorari.|$|E
25|$|On 21 September 2016, Nicky Hager was subpoenaed by Colin Craig's {{lawyers to}} testify {{as part of}} the latter's defence in a {{defamation}} suit filed by Jordan Williams, the co-founder of the New Zealand Taxpayers' Union. Hager had initially volunteered to give evidence, however decided {{he did not want to}} after Mr Williams gave evidence in relation to Craig's treatment of his former press secretary, Rachel MacGregor. Craig gave evidence that he had read Hager's book Dirty Politics before producing his pamphlet Dirty Politics and Hidden Agendas, which was found to have <b>defamed</b> Williams. Hager took the stand as an expert witness and alleged that publications linked to Jordan Williams on Cameron Slater's blog attacked Craig and followed a similar pattern that had been documented in his book. After testifying for fifteen minutes, Hager was not cross-examined by Williams' lawyers and was allowed to leave by the judge.|$|E

500|$|Napoleon's senate called Louis XVIII to {{the throne}} on the {{condition}} that he would accept a constitution that entailed recognition of the Republic and the Empire, a bicameral parliament elected every year, and the tri-colour flag of the aforementioned regimes.

In 2004, a Canadian Falun Gong practitioner Joel Chipkar won a libel case against Pan Xinchun, an officer at the Chinese consulate in Toronto, who had called Chipkar a member of a [...] "sinister cult" [...] in a newspaper article. Pan was ordered to pay $10,000 in damages to Chipkar, but left the country before paying. In 2008, the Appeals Court of Quebec, Canada, ruled that a Chinese language newspaper [...] "Les Presses Chinoises" [...] had <b>defamed</b> Falun Gong when it depicted the practice as dangerous and perverse. The court did not award damages, however, on the basis that the defamation targeted the group, rather than the individual plaintiffs ...|$|E
500|$|Barney {{was rescued}} from a tar pit by Bart's pet {{elephant}} Stampy in [...] "Bart Gets an Elephant" [...] {{and he also}} started a snowplowing business rivaling Homer's in [...] "Mr. Plow". Barney's commercial <b>defamed</b> Homer, causing Homer to lose his customers. As revenge, Homer fooled Barney into plowing a driveway on Widow's Peak, a treacherous mountain just outside Springfield.

Indeed, Slew and Jack McCain had not had sterling records at the Academy themselves, finishing in the bottom third and bottom twentieth respectively. McCain realized later that the Academy had taught him that [...] "to sustain my self-respect for a lifetime {{it would be necessary}} for me to have the honor of serving something greater than my self-interest", a lesson that he would need to carry him through a [...] "desperate and uncertain" [...] time a decade later.|$|E
