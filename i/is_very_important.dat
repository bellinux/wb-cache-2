5|$|Naturally {{occurring}} silver {{is composed}} of two stable isotopes, 107Ag and 109Ag, with 107Ag being slightly more abundant (51.839% natural abundance). This almost equal abundance is rare in the periodic table. The atomic weight is 107.8682(2) u; this value <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>important</b> because {{of the importance of}} silver compounds, particularly halides, in gravimetric analysis. Both isotopes of silver are produced in stars via the s-process (slow neutron capture), as well as in supernovas via the r-process (rapid neutron capture).|$|E

5|$|A base such as spermine {{has a few}} {{different}} {{sites where}} protonation can occur. In this example the first proton can go on the terminal –NH2 group, or either of the internal –NH– groups. The pKa values for dissociation of spermine protonated at one or other of the sites are examples of micro-constants. They cannot be determined directly by means of pH, absorbance, fluorescence or NMR measurements. Nevertheless, the site of protonation <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>important</b> for biological function, so mathematical methods {{have been developed for}} the determination of micro-constants.C NMR Data Processed by the New Computer Program HypNMR2000.

Important cargo quantities are carried by river, between Constanta and Central and Eastern European countries: Bulgaria, Serbia, Hungary, Austria, Slovakia and Germany. River traffic <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>important</b> for the Constanța Port, having a share of 23.3% of the total traffic in 2005, when 8,800 river vessels called to the port.|$|E

The viscosity of the molten glass <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>important</b> for manufacturing success. During drawing, the process where the hot glass is pulled {{to reduce the}} diameter of the fiber, the viscosity must be relatively low. If it is too high, the fiber will break during drawing.

It is also important in reproduction. Like other slow lorises, the Sunda slow loris has glands on its elbows that exude oils. The gland is licked to spread scent and {{is thought to have}} evolved for communication, but it is toxic to humans. If the person is allergic to the animal they can go into shock and could even die. It also has glands on its anus and can signal conspecifics by perineal rubbing which deposits urine. When it locates the scent of another slow loris it may rub its face on the substrate where the scent was found.|$|E

5|$|Silver <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>important</b> in {{electronics}} for conductors and electrodes {{on account}} of its high electrical conductivity even when tarnished. Bulk silver and silver foils were used to make vacuum tubes, {{and continue to be}} used today in the manufacture of semiconductor devices, circuits, and their components. For example, silver is used in high quality connectors for RF, VHF, and higher frequencies, particularly in tuned circuits such as cavity filters where conductors cannot be scaled by more than 6%. Printed circuits and RFID antennas are made with silver paints, Powdered silver and its alloys are used in paste preparations for conductor layers and electrodes, ceramic capacitors, and other ceramic components.|$|E

The first two members of the group share similar properties as they are solid metals under standard conditions. Mercury is the only metal that is a liquid at room temperature. While zinc <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>important</b> in the biochemistry of living organisms, cadmium and mercury are both highly toxic.
