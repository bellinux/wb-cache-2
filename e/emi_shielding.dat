30|$|We {{present a}} {{feasibility}} study {{that has been}} carried out to determine the best power regulation strategy for the PET front-end electronics of the trimodal PET/MRI/EEG TRIMAGE scanner. Conventional power regulation strategies cannot be applied to PET/MRI because standard switching regulators stop working in presence of a high magnetic field. At the state of the art, linear regulators are used instead. However, linear regulators are inefficient and might not allow to fulfill power and thermal constraints if the electronics becomes more power demanding, such {{as in the case of}} FPGA based front-ends. Very recently, a new generation of switching power supplies has been introduced for EMI critical applications where the discrete inductor energy buffer is not allowed. These supplies have very small footprint, need few biasing peripherals and they use on-chip integrated inductors for energy storage. These switching power regulators coupled with an adequate <b>EMI</b> <b>shield</b> could be an achievable power solution for our PET front-end electronics. Test procedures for Enpirion.

Finite Element Method (FEM) simulations and Monte Carlo based tolerance analysis are used to show that even a deviation of 15 ÷ 20 % from the nominal values of the most important design parameters of the PyC film, i. e. its thickness and sheet resistance, does not significantly affect the wanted level of electromagnetic interference <b>shielding</b> efficiency (<b>EMI</b> SE). The ranges of the SE show that <b>EMI</b> <b>shield</b> based on PyC film is characterized by a robust behavior with respect to the variation of such parameters due to the production processes.

Both dielectric constant and electrical conductivity of carbon foams in quasi-static regime, at 129 Hz, were high (more than 10 (6) and close to 70 S/m, respectively), and increased with carbon foams density according to power laws. Significant electromagnetic interference <b>shielding</b> efficiency (<b>EMI</b> SE) was found at microwave (MW) frequencies for all produced samples. The highest value of electromagnetic attenuation at the level of 20 dB for 2 -mm thick sample was observed for the foam having the highest density and the lowest mean cell size.

CNT-polymer composites either based on solvent casting or melt-based techniques have been studied with various polymer matrices, including PMMA [22], liquid crystal polymers, and melamine formaldehydes [23], PVA [24], and fused silica [25] for various applications such as radiation protection, <b>EMI</b> <b>shielding,</b> and electrostatic discharge materials. There are many reports on <b>EMI</b> <b>shielding</b> of carbon nanotubes reinforced polymer composites [26 – 30] in the X-band region because of its use in military communication satellites, weather monitoring, air traffic control, defense trackingand high-resolution imaging radars.

In {{order to be able}} to measure more efficiently, there is a strong need to be able to perform small tests while the cooler remains cold. For this reason the cooler is equipped with a dipstick provision which allows samples to be entered without warming up. Tests have been performed with a dipstick cooling down to 4 K. In the first period of this master thesis assignment, several possible designs were discussed with regard to the most performance dipstick unit which allows experiments to be performed at 20 mK level. However, during the study of several design options, a dipstick provision for cryogenic detector development was designed and manufactured by Leiden Cryogenics. As a consequence the assignment in SRON changed, and the second phase of this master thesis was to adapt the dipstick purchased by SRON to the TES requirements. To achieve the goals of the thesis it was first necessary to have the CAD models of the dipstick.
