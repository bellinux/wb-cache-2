40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to examine, during field conditions, what impact {{additional}} insulation on a spine board would have on thermoregulation. Method: The study was conducted outdoors, under field conditions in February in the north of Sweden. The subjects, all wearing standardised clothing, were immobilised on uninsulated (n= 10) or insulated spine boards (n= 9). Tympanic temperature as well as the subjects’ estimated sensation of cold and their estimated level of shivering were measured at five minute intervals during the trial. Statistical analysis of the data gathered for the first 55 minutes was performed. Results: There were no differences between the two groups regarding reduction in body core temperature or cold discomfort. There was, however, a statistically significant increase in estimated shivering for the subjects placed on uninsulated spine boards. Conclusion: Additional insulation on a spine board by the means of an <b>insulation</b> <b>mat</b> rendered a significantly reduced need for shivering in a cold environment. This is an effect that could be of great importance during protracted evacuations of injured, ill or otherwise compromised patients. In the light of these results we conclude that spine boards, as well as other materials used for prehospital transportation of patients in cold environments, should be well insulated. This is a measure that could be accomplished by such simple means as using an additional <b>insulation</b> <b>mat...</b>|$|E
40|$|Increasingly {{stringent}} diesel {{particulate emissions}} standards have reestablished international interest in diesel filters, whose first series application {{dates back to}} 1985. Modem diesel engine technology, with computerized engine management systems and advanced, common rail injection systems, needs to be fully exploited to support efficient and durable diesel filter systems with catalytic aids, as standard equipment in passenger cars. Efficient system and components' optimization {{requires the use of}} mathematical models of diesel filter performance. The three-dimensional model,for the regeneration of the diesel particulate filter presented in this paper has been developed as an engineering tool for the detailed design optimization of SiC diesel filters of modular structure. The 3 -D modeling is achieved by interfacing an existing 1 -D model to commercial finite element method software for the computation of the 3 -D temperature field within the whole filter assembly, including the adhesive of the filter blocks, the <b>insulation</b> <b>mat,</b> and the metal canning.

40|$|In most {{aviation}} applications, a major {{cost benefit}} {{can be achieved}} by a reduction of the system weight. Often the acoustic properties of the fuselage structure are not in the focus of the primary design process, too. A final correction of poor acoustic properties is usually done using <b>insulation</b> <b>mats</b> in the chamber between the primary and secondary shell. It is plausible that a more sophisticated material distribution in that area can result in a substantially reduced weight. Topology optimization is a well-known approach to reduce material of compliant structures. In this paper an adaption of this method to acoustic problems is investigated. The gap full of <b>insulation</b> <b>mats</b> is suitably parameterized to achieve different material distributions. To find advantageous configurations, the objective in the underlying topology optimization is chosen to obtain good acoustic pressure patterns in the aircraft cabin. An important task in the optimization is an adequate Finite Element model of the system. This can usually not be obtained from commercially available programs {{due to the lack of}} special sensitivity data with respect to the design parameters. Therefore an appropriate implementation of the algorithm has been done, exploiting the vector and matrix capabilities in the MATLAB environment. Finally some new aspects of the Finite Element implementation will also be presented, since they are interesting on its own and can be generalized to efficiently solve other partial differential equations as well...|$|R

The assignment was supplied by MMB Consulting, Kristinehamn. The {{purpose of this}} projectwas to find an alternative way of shaping wire-net <b>insulation</b> <b>mats.</b> This <b>insulation</b> product isused for fire and thermal insulation of technical installations. The insulation consists of stoneor glass wool with a sewn on steel wire netting on the out facing side. This netting has thepurpose to enable fastening to e. g. ventilation ducts and to provide bounding of joints. Thiswire netting makes regular methods for fitting stone or glass wool non applicable. Theexisting method for shaping wire-net insulation has flaws due to not being designed for thisapplication. These flaws include poor ergonomics, efficiency and low result quality. The objectives with this project {{is to find a}} new method that makes fitting of wire-netinsulation more efficient and safer for the user regarding personal safety and ergonomics. The work has been conducted according to the methods of the industrial product developmentprocess and the design methodology. The project resulted in a motor driven tool for shaping wire-net insulation that according to atheoretical foundation has proven to be more user adapted through being designed for goodergonomics and by offering a simpler handling. This solution is also considered to be moreefficient and to give better results than the present solution.

40|$|The thermal {{conductivity}} (λ) of wood shavings <b>insulation</b> <b>mats</b> {{was investigated in}} terms of wood shavings' dimensions and mat density. The raw materials were collected from at imber-precut factory and three fractions，L，M，and S with different dimensions and thickness were obtained by a sieve classification. The bulk density of L and M was almost identical. In order to investigate the effects of raw material size on mat {{thermal conductivity}}， the λ of mats with a density of 140 kg/m 3 was compared among L，M, and S fractions. It {{was found that the}} λ of M fraction mats (M-mats) was about 12 % lower than that of L fraction mats (L-mats). In order to investigate the effects of mat density，the λ of mats with a density of 120 and 180 kg/m 3 was also measured for L-mats and M-mats. The results showed that the higher mat densities were，the lower the λ became. Also，the λ of M-mats was found to be 11 % lower than that of L-mats on average through this density range. To quantitate the effects of raw material size on mat thermal conductivity，we calculated the apparent λ of coarse pores in the mats (λvl) ，which includes the effects of convective and radiant heat transfer that were calculated {{with the use of a}} mix law of two types of layer arrangement models parallel (PA-model) and perpendicular (PE-model) to the direction of heat flow. The results showed that the λvl of M-mats was 27 % lower than that of L-mats on average. This suggests that using smaller wood shavings makes coarse pores smaller. which consequently inhibits convective and radiant heat transfer. Also，the results revealed that the existence ratio of the PA-model was much smaller than the PE-model. Since changes in λvl affect only the PA-model, reductions in mat thermal conductivity smaller than in λvl are explicable by the low existence ratio of the PA-model...|$|R

Based on crystalline phase nucleation and growth kinetics, a 99 +% SiO 2 glass was selected as the base composition. A coating was developed that incorporated the high emissivity phase NiCr 2 O 4 as a two phase coating with goals of high emittance and minimum change in thermal expansion. A second major coating classification has a plasma sprayed emittance coating over a sealed pure amorphous SiO 2 layer. A third area of development centered on extremely thin amorphous SiO 2 coatings deposited by chemical vapor deposition.

This flexible composite insulation system consists of an outer layer of silicon carbide fabric, followed by alumina <b>mat</b> <b>insulation,</b> and alternating layers of aluminized polyimide film and aluminoborosilicate scrim fabric. A potential application of this composite insulation would be as a thermal protection system for the aerobrake of the aeroassist space transfer vehicle (ASTV).

40|$|Pinyon and juniper {{trees are}} {{expanding}} into mountain sagebrush communities throughout their ranges. Fire {{is used to}} restore these sagebrush communities, but limited information is available on seedling establishment of native shrubs and herbs. We examined effects of spring prescribed fire in the Great Basin on emergence and survival of five species (Artemisia tridentata vaseyana, Festuca idahoensis, Poa secunda, Eriogonum umbellatum and Lupinus argenteus) common to these communities. Data were collected in three microsites (undertree, undershrub and interspace) on a burned and unburned site following a prescribed fire and on the unburned site the year prior to the fire. Soil temperature and moisture were collected on both sites and years. Emergence and survival of A. tridentata was low. Grasses had higher emergence and survival under trees in 2003 in the unburned site, reflecting the pre-burn distribution of these species. E. umbellatum had high emergence and survival regardless of site or microsite. L. argenteus had moderate emergence that was lowest on the burned site under trees and highest on the unburned site in interspaces. Burned soils were warmer than unburned soils. Undertree microsites on the unburned site were cooler than other microsites on both sites due to shading and <b>insulation</b> by needle <b>mats.</b> Soil moisture was generally higher on the burn site due to fewer shrubs and trees. Pinyon appeared to have a facilitative role for grass seedling establishment on both sites. Spring prescribed fire {{did not have a}} negative impact on emergence or survival in these mountain sagebrush communities. Low establishment of some species indicate higher seeding rates or repeated seeding may be required.
