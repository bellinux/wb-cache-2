5|$|In Maine, 20 {{counties}} were declared {{states of}} emergency. After the storm, Southern New England Telephone sent {{a crew of}} 100workers in 50trucks to Maine to assist in restoring power. Power was quickly restored, and in some places the outages were less severe than during Carol. For only {{the third time in}} its history, the Portland Evening Express was not delivered due to the storm. Most primary roads were re-opened by two days after the storm, although rural areas and rail lines took longer to repair. There was a temporary travel ban for all but emergency vehicles in Maine due to washed out roads. Affecting densely populated portions of the state, Edna struck the day before the governor race between Republican Burton M. Cross and Democratic Edmund Muskie. Before the election, politicians commented how a suppressed turnout {{as a result of the}} storm would benefit Muskie, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>state</b> <b>where</b> no Democrat had won governorship since 1934. Muskie ultimately won the election in a close race, which saw a lower turnout than 1950, likely due to Edna suppressing the rural, Republican turnout.|$|E
5|$|McGovern {{attended}} Mitchell High School, {{where he}} was a solid but unspectacular member of the track team. A turning point came when his tenth-grade English teacher recommended him to the debate team, where he became quite active. His high-school debate coach, a history teacher who capitalized on McGovern's interest in that subject, proved to be a great influence in his life, and McGovern spent many hours honing his meticulous, if colorless, forensic style. McGovern and his debating partner won events in his area and gained renown <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>state</b> <b>where</b> debating was passionately followed by the general public. Debate changed McGovern's life, giving him a chance to explore ideas to their logical end, broadening his perspective, and instilling a sense of personal and social confidence. He graduated in 1940 in the top ten percent of his class.|$|E
5|$|The Clinton {{campaign}} had counted on winning the nomination by Super Tuesday and was unprepared financially and logistically for a prolonged effort; lagging in Internet fundraising as Clinton began loaning money to her campaign. There was continuous turmoil within the campaign staff {{and she made}} several top-level personnel changes. Obama won the next eleven February contests across the country, often by large margins and took a significant pledged delegate lead over Clinton. On March 4, Clinton broke the string of losses by winning in Ohio among other places, where her criticism of NAFTA, a major legacy of her husband's presidency, helped <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>state</b> <b>where</b> the trade agreement was unpopular. Throughout the campaign, Obama dominated caucuses, for which the Clinton campaign largely ignored preparation. Obama did well in primaries where African Americans or younger, college-educated, or more affluent voters were heavily represented; Clinton did well in primaries where Hispanics or older, non-college-educated, or working-class white voters predominated. Behind in delegates, Clinton's best hope of winning the nomination came in persuading uncommitted, party-appointed superdelegates.|$|E

50|$|A polymer brush is {{the name}} given to a surface coating {{consisting}} of polymers tethered to a surface.

These polymer layers can be tethered to flat substrates such as silicon wafers, or highly curved substrates such as nanoparticles. Also, polymers can be tethered in high density to another single polymer chain, although this arrangement is normally named a bottle brush. Additionally, there is a separate class of polyelectrolyte brushes, when the polymer chains themselves carry an electrostatic charge.|$|R
25|$|The {{race was}} covered {{nationwide}} {{as one of}} the most closely watched Senate races that year.

25|$|Nucleic acid {{thermodynamics}} is {{the study}} of how temperature affects the nucleic acid structure of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). The melting temperature (Tm) is defined as the temperature at which half of the DNA strands are in the random coil or single-stranded (ssDNA) state. Tm depends on the length of the DNA molecule and its specific nucleotide sequence. DNA, when <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>state</b> <b>where</b> its two strands are dissociated (i.e., the dsDNA molecule exists as two independent strands), is referred to as having been denatured by the high temperature.|$|E
25|$|A notable {{disadvantage}} {{of the method}} is that the lensing cannot be repeated, because the chance alignment never occurs again. Also, the detected planets will tend to be several kiloparsecs away, so follow-up observations with other methods are usually impossible. In addition, the only physical characteristic that can be determined by microlensing is {{the mass of the}} planet, within loose constraints. Orbital properties also tend to be unclear, as the only orbital characteristic that can be directly determined is its current semi-major axis from the parent star, which can be misleading if the planet follows an eccentric orbit. When the planet is far away from its star, it spends only a tiny portion of its orbit <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>state</b> <b>where</b> it is detectable with this method, so the orbital period of the planet cannot be easily determined. It is also easier to detect planets around low-mass stars, as the gravitational microlensing effect increases with the planet-to-star mass ratio.|$|E

25|$|However, some {{observers}} claim the merger {{has not had}} positive results. Critics argue that local FEA unions are less effective in collective bargaining, local and state annual dues are too high, young teachers are reluctant to join their local affiliates, and neither the state association nor local unions have done much to protect under-performing teachers from being fired. These critics say the association is increasingly frozen out of politics <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>state</b> <b>where</b> Republicans control both the executive and legislative branches of government, and has made little headway in convincing the public that the candidates it backs are worth electing or the policies it supports are worth enacting. FEA supporters counter that the federation has proven effective despite these odds, and remains a force in state politics. They point to the federation's king-making role in the state's 2002 Democratic gubernatorial primary, where the union's candidate (Bill McBride) defeated a better-known and funded candidate (Janet Reno) and ran a strong campaign against a popular, wealthy incumbent (Gov. Jeb Bush).|$|E

[...] Previously unaffiliated politically, Romney declared himself a member of the Republican Party and gained election to the convention. By early 1960, many in Michigan's somewhat moribund Republican Party were touting Romney as a possible candidate for governor, U.S. senator, or even U.S. vice president.|$|E

500|$|By February 1856 Morton {{had made}} his way to the newly formed Republican party at the {{national}} level as a member of the resolutions committee to the preliminary national convention that met in Pittsburgh. He also served as a delegate to the 1856 Republican National Convention in Philadelphia. Thirty-two-year-old Morton became the People's/Republican candidate for governor of Indiana in 1856. His Democratic opponent was Ashbel P. Willard, a popular state senator. Despite a hard-fought campaign that for the first time brought Morton to the attention of voters around the state, Willard defeated him in the general election by fewer than 6,000 votes, amid charges on both sides of fraudulent voting. Radical Republican George W. Julian, who detested Morton, contended that Morton did not take a strong enough position against slavery, and, as conservative former Whigs claimed, he had been too lenient on the issue <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>state</b> <b>where</b> southern-born residents wanted nothing to do with blacks or abolitionism.

2500|$|... 2012. On July 9, 2012, the Episcopal Church {{passed a}} {{resolution}} approving an official liturgy for blessing same-sex unions. This liturgy, called “The Witnessing and Blessing of a Lifelong Covenant” offers a blessing close to marriage, but the church is {{clear that it is}} not marriage. According to Rev. Ruth Meyers, chairwoman of the Standing Commission on Liturgy and Music, “There are a lot of similarities. The couple give their consent to being joined in lifelong commitment, they exchange vows. There’s the possibility of exchanging rings, or, for couples who have been together for some time and already have rings, to have their rings blessed. There is a blessing over the couple. But we’re clear at this point {{that this is not a}} marriage because the Episcopal Church is not in agreement in its understanding of marriage.” The resolution enables priests to bestow the church’s blessing on gay couples even if they live <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>state</b> <b>where</b> same-sex marriage is illegal; however, bishops who do not approve of the liturgy can prohibit their priests from using it. The resolution is provisional and will be reviewed in three years.|$|E
2500|$|In the United States, {{there are}} no federal laws prohibiting {{discrimination}} against employees based on their sexual orientation.

If a small business owner owns his or her business <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>state</b> <b>where</b> there is a law against sexual orientation discrimination, the owner must abide to the law regardless of there not being a federal law. Twenty states and the District of Columbia have laws against this form of discrimination in the workplace.

For example, California has laws in place to protect employees {{who may have been}} discriminated against based upon sexual orientation or perceived sexual orientation. California law prohibits discrimination against those [...] "with traits not stereotypically associated with their gender", such as mannerisms, appearance, or speech. Sexual orientation discrimination comes up, for instance, when employers enforce a dress code, permit women to wear makeup but not men, or require men and women to only use restrooms designated for their particular sex regardless of whether they are transgender.|$|E
