50|$|The {{basis of}} the assay is {{fluorescence}} anisotropy, also known as fluorescence polarization. If a fluorescent molecule is stationary and exposed to plane-polarized light, it will become excited and consequently emit radiation back to the polarized-plane. However, if the excited fluorescent molecule is in motion (rotational or translational) during the <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lifetime,</b> it will emit light {{in a different direction}} than the excitation plane. The <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lifetime</b> is the amount of time between the absorption moment and the fluorescent emission moment.|$|E

Fluorophosphate glasses are very unusual in nature.

50|$|If the {{molecules}} {{have a variety}} of different spectra (absorption spectra and/or emission spectra), then it is possible to look at light from just a few molecules at a time by using the appropriate light sources and filters. Molecules can also be distinguished in more subtle ways based on <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lifetime</b> and other techniques.|$|E
40|$|Quantifying the {{variation}} in emission properties of fluorescent nanodiamonds is important for developing their wide-ranging applicability. Directed self-assembly techniques show promise for positioning nanodiamonds precisely enabling such quantification. Here we show an approach for depositing nanodiamonds in pre-determined arrays which are used to gather statistical information about <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lifetimes.</b> The arrays were created via a layer of photoresist patterned with grids of apertures using electron beam lithography and then drop-cast with nanodiamonds. Electron microscopy revealed a 90 % average deposition yield across 3, 376 populated array sites, {{with an average of}} 20 nanodiamonds per site. Confocal microscopy, optimised for nitrogen vacancy fluorescence collection, revealed a broad distribution of <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lifetimes</b> in agreement with literature.

40|$|The {{fluorescence}} {{of molecules}} on silver-island films exhibits nonexponential decay and is several {{orders of magnitude}} more rapid than on a silica surface, while the total emission intensity is slightly increased. This behavior results from the electromagnetic coupling between the fluorescing molecules and the plasmon resonances of the silver islands. We obtain good agreement with a model that uses the same theory for the electromagnetic coupling as {{has been used to}} account for surface-enhanced Raman scattering. <b>Fluorescent</b> <b>lifetimes</b> of molecules near metal surfaces are dramatically affected by the electromagnetic interaction between the excited molecules and the metal surface. To date, experimental and theoretical investigations have focused on the effects of a smooth surface. 1 - 3 In this Letter we report the first known study of <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lifetimes</b> of molecules near rough silver surfaces and show that the behavior is significantly different.

50|$|The {{properties}} desired of CSSNCs {{when using}} them for biological applications include high quantum yield, narrow fluorescence emission, broad absorption profile, stability against photobleaching, 20 second <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lifetime,</b> and high brightness. High quantum yields mean that minimal energy {{will need to}} be put into the quantum dot to induce fluorescence. A narrow fluorescence emission allows for multiple colors to be imaged at once without color overlap between different types of CSSNCs. Having a broad absorption profile allows multiple CSSNCs to be excited at the same wavelength and thus, multiple CSSNCs could be imaged simultaneously. Having a 20-second <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lifetime</b> allows for time-resolved bioimaging. The utility of CSSNCs is that they can be a complement to organic fluorophores. CSSNCs are less susceptible to photobleaching, but less is known about them compared to organic fluorophores. CSSNCs have 100-1000 times the two-photon fluorescence efficiency as organic dyes, exemplifying their value.In the cases where CSSNCs are used in biological medium, the core is a quantum dot and the shell can be an organic molecule or biological ligands, such as a DNA, that are used for biocompatibility and targeting. The shell can also be an organic molecule to which a biological molecule is later conjugated, furthering the modularity of core-shell structure. The most popular core/shell pair used is CdSe core with ZnS or CdS shell, which improves the quantum yield and protects against photobleaching compared to that of the core material alone. The size of the CSSNC is directly correlated to the color of fluorescence, so being able to control particle size is desirable. However, it is generally unknown how the shell molecules, and salt concentration, pH, and temperature of the media affect the CSSNCs’ properties and remains empirical.|$|E
5000|$|Fluorescent {{moieties}} emit photons several nanoseconds after absorption {{following an}} exponential decay curve, which differs between dyes and {{depends on the}} surrounding solvent. When the dye {{is attached to a}} macromolecules the decay curve becomes multiexponential. Conjugated dyes generally have a lifetime between 1-10 ns, a small amount of longer lived exceptions exist, notably pyrene with a lifetime of 400ns in degassed solvents or 100ns in lipids and coronene with 200ns. On a different category of fluorphores are the fluorescent organometals (lanthanides and transition metal-ligand complexes) which have been previously described, which have much longer lifetimes due to the restricted states: lanthanides have lifetimes of 0.5 to 3 ms, while transition metal-ligand complexes have lifetimes of 10 ns to 10 µs. Note that <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lifetime</b> {{should not be confused with}} the photodestruction lifetime or the [...] "shelf-life" [...] of a dye.|$|E
5000|$|Homogeneous, mix-and-read TR-FRET assays offer {{advantages}} over other biomolecular screening assays, such as fluorescence polarization (FP) or TRF assays. [...] In FP assays, background fluorescence due to library compounds is normally depolarized and background signal due to scattered light (e.g. precipitated compounds) is normally polarized. Depending on the assay configuration, either case {{can lead to}} a false positive or false negative result. However, because the donor species used in a TR-FRET assay has a <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lifetime</b> that is many orders of magnitude longer than background fluorescence or scattered light, emission signal resulting from energy transfer can be measured after any interfering signal has completely decayed. TR-FRET assays can also be formatted to use limiting receptor and excess tracer concentrations (unlike FP assays), which can provide further cost savings. [...] In the case of TRF assays, a wash step is required to remove unbound fluorescent reagents prior to measuring the activity signal of the assay. This increases reagent use, time to complete the assay, and limits the ability to miniaturize the system (e.g. converting from a 384-well microtiter plate to a 1536-well plate). TR-FRET assays take advantage of the required proximity of the donor and acceptor species for generation of signal.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect on}} {{structure}} and property of adding fluoride into Tm 3 + doped lead-germanate glass was established and verified experimentally. It {{was found that}} up to 10 mol% of fluoride could be introduced into our original lead-germanate composition while retaining the high thermal stability ideal for fibre fabrication. Much improved spectroscopic features, namely increased <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lifetimes</b> from 3 H 4 and 3 F 4 levels in Tm 3 + with increasing fluorine content, were observed. At {{the same time it}} was found that the radiative properties of Tm 3 + were left unchanged by fluoride addition, indicating that reduced multiphonon relaxation was responsible for the increased <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lifetimes.</b> This was well explained and foreseen by our established structure-property relation in terms of adding fluorine to the glass. In conclusion, fluoro-germanate glass shows advantages over germanate glass in optical properties and over fluoride glass in chemical and mechanical properties for practical fiber device applications.
