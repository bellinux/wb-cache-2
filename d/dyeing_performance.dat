40|$|In {{the current}} work novel navy and black fibre-reactive dye {{molecules}} were designed, synthesised and evaluated technically against the market leading dye, C. 1. Reactive Black 5. Novel intermediates were synthesised using a Michael-type addition of 4 aminophenyl- p-vinylsulphone onto various {{primary and secondary}} amines. The resulting novel bis(aminoaryl) intermediates were isolated and characterised, before being tetrazotised and utilised as linker molecules in the synthesis of four novel reactive dyes, each possessing two 'twice coupled H-acid' units. These reactive dyes were then applied to cotton in an exhaust dyeing process, at different concentrations, and their <b>dyeing</b> <b>performance</b> was {{compared to that of}} the market leading dye. The novel dyes were up to 20 % stronger on the cloth than the reference dye. This first series of dyes derived from novel linker intermediates had molar extinction coefficients of around 90, 000 L mor 1 cm- 1. The second series of dyes was derived from commercially available linker intermediates, which allowed a different degree of electron transfer from one chromophoric part of the molecule to the other. As a result of electron transfer, the molar extinction coefficients increased up to 144, 000 L mor 1 cm- 1. It was found that the structure of the linking molecule has a significant influence on the 3 -dimensional structure of the overall dye molecule and thus on its <b>dyeing</b> <b>performance,</b> for example the dye derived from 3, 3 '-diaminodiphenyl sulphone performed much better, than its para-isomer. Arising from the unexpectedly large difference in technical properties of isomeric dyes, a series of eight isomeric dyes was synthesised and evaluated. The differences in <b>dyeing</b> <b>performance</b> were clearly related to their 3 dimensional structures. It was found that dyes possessing a meta-sulphone linker were technically superior to the para-isomers. The isomers with meta structures appeared more hypsochromic with a wider half band width, while the para linker had a bathochromic influence and having a shorter half band width. All dyes performed better, at high concentrations, when applied at higher temperature, i. e. 80 Ã‚Â°C compared to 60 Ã‚Â°C, possibly attributable to their size. A fourth series of four novel bis(monochlorotriazinyl) dyes was prepared from an identical dyebase, but with varying degree of sulphonation. This resulted in different levels of anionic charge, which influenced the dyes' solubility and <b>dyeing</b> <b>performance.</b> A number of eight sulphonate groups was found to be the optimum in terms of solubility and <b>dyeing</b> <b>performance,</b> but that the optimum number of sulphonate groups is strongly dependent on the type of chromophore.

40|$|Textile Industries use {{different}} chemicals in dyeing processes, consuming {{large quantities of}} water and producing large volumes of wastewater. For the particular case of indigo dyeing processes, its reduction is performed chemically {{by the addition of}} sodium dithionite. However, this is considered environmentally unfavorable because of the resulting contaminated wastewaters. Therefore, it is important to replace sodium dithionite with other alternatives in order to achieve cleaner processes. α-hydroxycarbonyls have been suggested as possible environmentally friendly alternatives to reduce indigo. However, each one applied alone is enable to attain the <b>dyeing</b> <b>performances</b> offered by the conventional reductant. Thus, the study of the synergy of some selected α-hydroxycarbonyls was proposed. In this paper, a mixture design of experimental (DOE) methods was used to determine the optimum combination of α-hydrxycarbonyls to be applied in the indigo reduction process. Based on the design expert software, quadratic models were established as functions of α-hydroxycarbonyls proportions. The diagnostics of models were investigated by using mixture contour plots.

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} improve the {{cationic}} <b>dyeing</b> <b>performance</b> of para-aramid fiber, the optimal conditions of fiber pretreatment were determined through the orthogonal test with three-factor (sulfuric acid dosage, temperature and time) and four-level array using the tensile strength and apparent color depth of modified fabrics as the main evaluation criteria.

The results showed that the modified para-aramid fiber displayed a smoother surface, and the acid hydrolysis of polymer molecules occurred. The treatment increased the number of reactive dyeing sites on fiber surface and consequently improved the <b>dyeing</b> <b>performance</b> of para-aramid fabric. The optimal process for the modification of para-aramid fiber with sulfuric acid treatment was 2 % dosage of sulfuric acid at 40 °C for 1 hour.

30|$|The {{demand of}} natural {{colorants}} for the dyeing of textile fibers {{has been increasing}} gradually in recent years due to a growing global ecological awareness as well as a greater emphasis on a cleaner and greener production process. The eco-friendly dyeing of polyester fiber with natural dye henna is a novel approach that has extensively been studied in this article. To this end, the dyeing of polyester fiber with henna dye was conducted at different temperatures without using hazardous metallic mordants. Then the <b>dyeing</b> <b>performance</b> was investigated in terms of depth of shade measurement, analysis of colorimetric properties of color and assessment of color fastness properties of henna dyed polyester fabric samples. The amount of dye absorption by fiber and the resulting depth of shade were found to increase with increasing dyeing temperature. In case of colorfastness properties, all dyed substrates demonstrated excellent fastness ratings against washing, rubbing and perspiration with little to no deterioration of color. Moreover, the detailed morphological study revealed that surface structure of fiber remained unchanged after dyeing at an elevated temperature and pressure. So, the findings suggest that dyeing of polyester fiber with henna dye without any metallic mordants is a promising approach to get the desired <b>dyeing</b> <b>performance</b> alongside opening up an avenue for eco-friendly dyeing.|$|E

40|$|In {{an attempt}} to develop hair dye {{products}} that give more natural-looking colors, {{some of the basic}} steps from the natural biosynthetic pathway to melanin have been imitated chemically. Our hair coloring process starts with 3, 4 -dihydroxyphenylalanine (dopa). By careful selection of oxidant and oxidation conditions, dopa is converted on hair to 5, 6 -dihydroxyindole in high yield. This indole has been known for many years to be the immediate precursor to the black eumelanins, and it can be readily polymerized in situ to dye the hair an intense black color. Additionally, the natural process produces the red and yellow pheomelanins by incorporating sulfur-containing nucleophiles uch as cysteine into the melanogenic process. We have also found that significant color changes can be produced by adding a variety of nucleophiles to the system, including cysteine and other thiols. By these means, a wide range of shades can be produced on hair under conditions acceptable to the user of the hair <b>dye.</b> <b>Performance</b> of the <b>dyed</b> hair appears to be comparable to that of current permanent dyes and is clearly superior in both application technique and performance to the alternative natural dye products available today...|$|R
