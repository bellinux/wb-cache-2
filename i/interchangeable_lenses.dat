25|$|On August 25, 1981 Sony {{unveiled}} {{a prototype of}} the Sony Mavica. This camera was an analog electronic camera that featured <b>interchangeable</b> <b>lenses</b> and a SLR viewfinder.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{electronically}} controlled <b>interchangeable</b> <b>lenses,</b> such {{as those}} used for SLR cameras, have f-stops specified internally in 1/8-stop increments, so the cameras' 1/3-stop settings are approximated by the nearest 1/8-stop setting in the lens.|$|E
25|$|Like SLRs DSLRs {{typically}} use <b>interchangeable</b> <b>lenses</b> (1) with {{a proprietary}} lens mount. A movable mechanical mirror system (2) is switched down (exact 45-degree angle) to direct {{light from the}} lens over a matte focusing screen (5) via a condenser lens (6) and a pentaprism/pentamirror (7) to an optical viewfinder eyepiece (8). Most of the entry-level DSLRs use a pentamirror instead of the traditional pentaprism.|$|E

50|$|A mirrorless <b>interchangeable</b> <b>lens</b> camera (MILC) is {{a digital}} camera with an <b>interchangeable</b> <b>lens</b> and uses an image sensor to provide an image to a rear display and/or an {{electronic}} viewfinder (EVF). It is called mirrorless since {{it does not have}} a mirror in the optical path.|$|R

25|$|Panasonic {{released}} the first Micro Four Thirds camera, the Lumix DMC-G1. Several manufacturers have announced lenses {{for the new}} Micro Four Thirds mount, while older Four Thirds lenses can be mounted with an adapter (a mechanical spacer with front and rear electrical connectors and its own internal firmware). A similar mirror-less interchangeable lens camera, but with an APS-C-sized sensor, was announced in January 2010: the Samsung NX10. On 21 September 2011, Nikon announced with the Nikon 1 a series of high-speed MILCs. A handful of rangefinder cameras also support <b>interchangeable</b> <b>lenses.</b> Six digital rangefinders exist: the Epson R-D1 (APS-C-sized sensor), the Leica M8 (APS-H-sized sensor), both smaller than 35mm film rangefinder cameras, and the Leica M9, M9-P, M Monochrom and M (all full-frame cameras, with the Monochrom shooting exclusively in black-and-white).|$|E
2500|$|The {{ability to}} {{exchange}} lenses, {{to select the}} best lens for the current photographic need, and to allow the attachment of specialised lenses, {{is one of the}} key factors in the popularity of DSLR cameras, although this feature is not unique to the DSLR design and mirrorless interchangeable lens cameras are becoming increasingly popular. <b>Interchangeable</b> <b>lenses</b> for SLRs and DSLRs (also known as [...] "Glass") are built to operate correctly with a specific lens mount that is generally unique to each brand. A photographer will often use lenses made by the same manufacturer as the camera body (for example, Canon EF lenses on a Canon body) although there are also many independent lens manufacturers, such as Sigma, Tamron, Tokina, and Vivitar that make lenses for a variety of different lens mounts. There are also lens adapters that allow a lens for one lens mount to be used on a camera body with a different lens mount but with often reduced functionality.|$|E
5000|$|Few TLR cameras offered <b>interchangeable</b> <b>lenses</b> {{and none}} {{were made with}} a zoom lens. In systems with <b>interchangeable</b> <b>lenses,</b> such as the Mamiya, the fixed {{distance}} between the lenses sets a hard limit on their size, which precludes the possibility of large aperture long-focus lenses.|$|E
