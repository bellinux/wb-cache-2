40|$|This study {{examines}} and analyses the <b>expropriation</b> <b>laws</b> {{and practices in}} Ethiopia. The objective of the thesis is to analyze and describe the land rights and <b>expropriation</b> <b>laws</b> in Ethiopia and to compare them with the practice {{in order to determine}} the fairness of compensation. The study is made against the Ethiopian Constitution and other subsidiary legislations which provide the basic land rights and the nature and details of expropriation. The basic argument made in this thesis is that even if the Ethiopian Constitution provides and guarantees common ownership of land (together with the state) to the people, this right has not been fully realized whether in terms of land accessibility, enjoyablity, and payment of fair compensation in the event of expropriation. The reasons have to do either with the faulty nature of the laws or with their implementation by public authorities. From the outset, the constitution excludes land as a subject of compensation. For this reason, land is being excluded from the compensation package and hence it has no value for the holder. Urban land holders are denied location value of their property, which they can collect it otherwise during sale, and hence the compensation becomes unfair. Similarly, rural farmers are denied compensation for the complete loss of their farm land. The denial of compensation for the value of the land is categorically in contradiction with the very principle of joint ownership of land by the people and the state. There are also other reasons which are related to the law or its practical applicability, such as valuation process which reduces the amount of compensation. There are also property interests which are not included as compensable interests. Payment of compensation is one factor for secure property right and hence sustainable development. To ensure fair compensation in the event of compensation, a legal and policy level reform is necessary to address and amend the existing problems. Further, to harmonize the laws and practices is imperative to reduce the amount of injustice existed in today’s expropriation procedure in Ethiopia. QC 20131122 </p...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the theories and practices surrounding the rural land takings law in modern China. It identifies and rejects the dominant Transition Paradigm {{in the existing}} literature which treats the contemporary crisis of rural land expropriation in China as a case of unfulfilled constitutional promise and dispenses prescriptions aimed at developing the Chinese <b>expropriation</b> <b>law</b> towards the supposedly more advanced models of takings law found in other countries, especially the USA. By unearthing the long overlooked historical lineage within which the rural land takings law evolves {{over the past century}} in China, including the almost forgotten original takings clause in the 1954 PRC Constitution and the foundational theories propounded by both the communist and nationalist parties, this thesis offers a much richer picture on how and why the Chinese <b>expropriation</b> <b>law</b> has become the way it is today. It shows that the widely recognized phenomenon of “land finance” is a symptom rather than cause of the problem, which lies in the deeply entrenched tradition of rural land takings for the party-state’s social transformative programmes, rendering the Chinese experience incomparable to that of any other countries. The current takings clause in the 1982 PRC Constitution and the present law in this area, despite the relevant reforms over the past decade, remain to faithfully reflect such a tradition characterized by the state’s plan-based top-down control over rural land and the presumption of state expropriation in non-agricultural use of rural land. Since these have been the paramount features of the Chinese land regime for over half a century and are unlikely to change in the foreseeable future, most of the reform recommendations made in the existing scholarship are either irrelevant or unfeasible. However, {{this is not to say}} that no change is possible. A more modest yet more realistic reform proposal will be put forward. This thesis is not currently available on ORA...|$|E

40|$|This {{article was}} {{submitted}} for the UN Economic Commission for Africa “ 2017 Conference on Land Policy in Africa” Nov. 14 - 17 2017, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. This article {{sheds light on}} a series of events that triggered escalating tensions over land and resources in the coastal communities of Lagos, Nigeria. This article provides an in-depth analysis of Nigeria’s <b>laws</b> on <b>expropriation</b> and the processes of acquiring land and compensating landholders in the Lekki Free Trade Zone (LFTZ) case. Specifically, the analysis addresses the following research questions: 1) Do Nigeria’s laws comply with internationally recognized standards on expropriation and compensation? 2) Did the government follow international standards on expropriation and compensation in the LFTZ case? 3) What measures can be recommended to the Nigerian government to the balancing of property rights with the public interest, thus ensuring the sustainable development of both affected communities and the general public? Proposing law reform as a solution to the recurring issue of insufficient compensation, this article answers research question (1) by assessing Nigeria’s <b>laws</b> on <b>expropriation</b> and compensation to determine whether they comply with internationally recognized standards as established by the Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure (FAO 2012). To conduct the analysis of Nigerian laws and practices related to land expropriation and compensation, the authors utilized the legal indicators on Nigeria from the Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure dataset available on Land Portal. This dataset measures national <b>expropriation</b> <b>laws</b> against international standards and is publicly available on the Land Portal (Tagliarino 2016, 2017). Answering research question (2) entailed conducting a desk review of primary and secondary sources on the LFTZ case as well as surveying 140 households from 10 communities that were affected by the LFTZ. The survey questions asked about the type of compensation, resettlement, and other entitlements granted to affected communities, the process by which compensation was calculated and land was expropriated, and whether the amount given was sufficient to cover income and other livelihood losses. Interviews were also conducted with local NGOs, government bodies, and the private sector to better understand the various viewpoints on the LFTZ case. Research question (3) was answered by using the findings from the legal analysis and LFTZ case study to develop a set of evidence-based recommendations for legal reform of Nigeria's Land Use Act...|$|R
40|$|In Arun the Constitutional Court {{held that}} section 28 of the Land Use Planning Ordinance (LUPO) vests all land {{indicated}} as public roads on a development {{plan in the}} local authority upon approval of such a plan. This includes land that is {{in excess of the}} normal need of the development. The appellant must hence be compensated for the "expropriation" of such excess land if the provision is to comply with section 25 (2) of the Constitution. This ruling is problematic for both <b>expropriation</b> <b>law</b> and administrative law. In terms of section 25 (2) four objections may be raised against the Arun decision. Firstly, it disregards the function of the public interest requirement for expropriation, as understood in view of the law-of-general-application requirement (which, in turn, is informed by the legality principle). The state cannot expropriate property for purposes that are ultra vires (or ulterior to) the authorising legislation. Yet the Arun court seems to allow just this by permitting the local authority to acquire land unrelated to the normal need of the development against payment of compensation instead of setting the attempted expropriation aside. The judgment, secondly, ignores the role of compensation under section 25 (2). Merely paying compensation to an affected party cannot turn an invalid expropriation into a valid one, since compensation is merely the result of a valid expropriation and not a justification for it. Thirdly, it makes the distinction between deprivation and expropriation pivot on the effect of the property limitation, which is unable to properly distinguish between these two forms of limitation in all instances. Finally, Moseneke DCJ's ruling seems to afford an election to litigants who are affected by materially defective expropriations to choose whether to accept the expropriation and claim compensation or to have it reviewed and set aside under PAJA. This election, if it indeed exists, subverts the principles of <b>expropriation</b> <b>law</b> and may have negative repercussions for both <b>expropriation</b> <b>law</b> and administrative law, especially in view of the single-system-of-law principle. From an administrative law perspective the authors identify four considerations that could assist courts in determining whether administrative law should be considered, if not applied, in a given case. The first is the internal coherency of the law in view of the subsidiarity principles. The subsidiarity principles provide guidelines for courts to decide cases where two fundamental rights might be applicable. A principled approach is necessary in this context to ensure that the law operates as a single system and displays the positive characteristics of such a system. The fact that Moseneke DCJ preferred to award compensation to Arun instead of reviewing the expropriation under PAJA runs contrary to these principles and seems to result in an outcome which endorses – instead of prevents – administrative injustice. Secondly, the Constitutional Court's refusal to follow PAJA by reason of its being onerous on the appellant contradicts earlier case law where the Court held that time-periods under the Act cannot be circumvented by reason of their being burdensome. The rationale behind these time-periods is integral to securing administrative justice, since time-periods are not merely formalistic technicalities. Thirdly, the authors argue that a green-light approach to internal remedies could have resulted in the broadening of the interpretative context and recognition of the legitimate role of the public administration in the state. Finally, deference as understood by Dyzenhaus also exemplifies why administrative law should not be ignored in cases which concern the exercise of public power. According to Dyzenhaus, deference requires courts to actively participate in the justification of administrative decisions by asking whether the administration's "reasoning did in fact and also could in principle justify the conclusion reached"...|$|E
40|$|The {{empirical}} {{evaluation of}} the causal effects of land titling typically suffers from selectivity bias.
