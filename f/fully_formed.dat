5|$|As {{feathers}} grow at variable rates, these variations lead to visible {{dark and}} light bands in the <b>fully</b> <b>formed</b> feather. These so-called growth bars and their widths {{have been used to}} determine the daily nutritional status of birds. Each light and dark bar correspond to around 24 hours and the use of this technique has been called ptilochronology (analogous to dendrochronology).|$|E
5|$|As {{with all}} endopterygotes, beetle larvae pupate, and from these pupae emerge <b>fully</b> <b>formed,</b> sexually mature adult beetles, or imagos. Pupae never have mandibles (they are adecticous). In most pupae, the {{appendages}} are not {{attached to the}} body and {{are said to be}} exarate; in a few beetles (Staphylinidae, Ptiliidae etc.) the appendages are fused with the body (termed as obtect pupae).|$|E
5|$|Lungless {{salamanders}} in {{the family}} Plethodontidae are terrestrial and lay {{a small number of}} unpigmented eggs in a cluster among damp leaf litter. Each egg has a large yolk sac and the larva feeds on this while it develops inside the egg, emerging <b>fully</b> <b>formed</b> as a juvenile salamander. The female salamander often broods the eggs. In the genus Ensatinas, the female has been observed to coil around them and press her throat area against them, effectively massaging them with a mucous secretion.|$|E

40|$|The <b>fully</b> {{oxidized}} <b>form</b> of cytochrome c oxidase, {{immediately after}} complete oxidation of the <b>fully</b> reduced <b>form,</b> pumps protons upon {{each of the}} initial 2 single-electron reduction steps, whereas protons are not pumped during single-electron reduction of the <b>fully</b> oxidized “as-isolated” <b>form</b> (the <b>fully</b> oxidized <b>form</b> without any reduction/oxidation treatment) [Bloch D, et al. (2004) The catalytic cycle of cytochrome c oxidase is not {{the sum of its}} two halves. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 101 : 529 – 533]. For identification of structural differences causing the remarkable functional difference between these 2 distinct <b>fully</b> oxidized <b>forms,</b> the X-ray structure of the fully oxidized as-isolated bovine heart cytochrome c oxidase was determined at 1. 95 -Å resolution by limiting the X-ray dose for each shot and by using many (≈ 400) single crystals. This minimizes the effects of hydrated electrons induced by the X-ray irradiation. The X-ray structure showed a peroxide group bridging the 2 metal sites in the O 2 reduction site (Fe 3 +-O−-O−-Cu 2 +), in contrast to a ferric hydroxide (Fe 3 +-OH−) in the <b>fully</b> oxidized <b>form</b> immediately after complete oxidation from the <b>fully</b> reduced <b>form,</b> as has been revealed by resonance Raman analyses. The peroxide-bridged structure is consistent with the reductive titration results showing that 6 electron equivalents are required for complete reduction of the <b>fully</b> oxidized as-isolated <b>form.</b> The structural difference between the 2 <b>fully</b> oxidized <b>forms</b> suggests that the bound peroxide in the O 2 reduction site suppresses the proton pumping function...|$|R

5|$|Some redback {{males have}} been {{observed}} using an alternative tactic that also ensures more of their genetic material is passed on. Juvenile female redbacks nearing their final moulting and adulthood have <b>fully</b> <b>formed</b> reproductive organs, but lack openings in the exoskeleton that allow access to the organs. Males will bite through the exoskeleton and deliver sperm without performing the somersault seen in males mating with adult females. The females then moult {{within a few days}} and deliver a clutch of fertilised eggs.|$|E
5|$|A high {{accident}} rate may also occur because Thoroughbreds, {{particularly in the}} United States, are first raced as 2-year-olds, well before they are completely mature. Though they may appear full-grown and are in superb muscular condition, their bones are not <b>fully</b> <b>formed.</b> However, catastrophic injury rates are higher in 4- and 5-year-olds than in 2- and 3-year-olds. Some believe that correct, slow training of a young horse (including foals) may actually be beneficial to the overall soundness of the animal. This is because, during the training process, microfractures occur in the leg followed by bone remodeling. If the remodeling is given sufficient time to heal, the bone becomes stronger. If proper remodeling occurs before hard training and racing begins, the horse will have a stronger musculoskeletal system and will have a decreased chance of injury.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Rick is the third-most intense Pacific {{hurricane}} on record. Developing {{south of}} Mexico on October15, 2009, Hurricane Rick traversed an area favoring rapid intensification, {{allowing it to}} become a hurricane within 24 hours of being declared a tropical depression. An eye began to form during the afternoon of October16; once <b>fully</b> <b>formed,</b> the storm underwent another period of rapid strengthening. During the afternoon of October17, the storm attained Category5 status on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. Several hours later, Rick attained its peak intensity as the third-strongest Pacific hurricane on record with winds of 180mph (285km/h) and a barometric pressure of 906mbar (hPa; 26.75inHg).|$|E

Ruth MacDonald saw Geisel's drawing style as <b>fully</b> <b>formed</b> in Mulberry Street, arguing that only his page design improved in later books, better keeping children's attention without confusing them. Philip Nel found the artwork in Geisel's later books {{to have a greater}} energy and looseness than in Mulberry Street or his earlier cartooning.

5|$|Lochner {{seems to}} have {{prepared}} on paper before approaching his underdrawings; {{there is little evidence}} of reworking, even when positioning large groups of figures. Infrared reflectography of the underdrawings for the Last Judgment panels show letters used to denote the final colour to be applied, for example g for gelb (yellow) or w for weiss (white), and there are few deviations in the finished work. He often rearranged drapery fold lines or to denote perspective, enlarged or diminished the size of figures. The underdrawings reveal a draughtsman of skill, dynamism and confidence; the figures appear <b>fully</b> <b>formed</b> with little evidence of reworking. Many are extremely detailed and precisely modelled, for example St Ursula's brooch in the Altarpiece of the City Patron Saints, which contains closely detailed garlands and diadems.|$|E
5|$|The {{accretion}} process probably {{lasted for}} several thousand {{years before the}} moon was <b>fully</b> <b>formed.</b> Models suggest that impacts accompanying accretion caused heating of Ariel's outer layer, reaching a maximum temperature of around 195K {{at a depth of}} about 31km. After the end of formation, the subsurface layer cooled, while the interior of Ariel heated due to decay of radioactive elements present in its rocks. The cooling near-surface layer contracted, while the interior expanded. This caused strong extensional stresses in the moon's crust reaching estimates of 30 MPa, which may have led to cracking. Some present-day scarps and canyons may be a result of this process, which lasted for about 200million years.|$|E

5|$|During its {{period of}} migration, Neptune {{is thought to}} have {{captured}} a large KBO, Triton, which is the only large moon in the Solar System with a retrograde orbit (it orbits opposite to Neptune's rotation). This suggests that, unlike the large moons of Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus, which are thought to have coalesced from rotating discs of material around their young parent planets, Triton was a <b>fully</b> <b>formed</b> body that was captured from surrounding space. Gravitational capture of an object is not easy: it requires some mechanism to slow down the object enough to be caught by the larger object's gravity. A possible explanation is that Triton was part of a binary when it encountered Neptune. (Many KBOs are members of binaries. See below.) Ejection of the other member of the binary by Neptune could then explain Triton's capture. Triton is only 14% larger than Pluto, and spectral analysis of both worlds shows that their surfaces are largely composed of similar materials, such as methane and carbon monoxide. All this points to the conclusion that Triton was once a KBO that was captured by Neptune during its outward migration.|$|E
5|$|Temnospondyls like Sclerocephalus {{are known}} from both large adult {{specimens}} and small larvae, showing an extreme change in body shape. In these species, {{the shape and}} proportions of skull bones change {{in the early stages}} of development. The ornamentation on the surface of the skull roof also develops at this time. Small, regularly spaced pits are the first to form, followed by larger ridges. As development continues, the external gills disappear. Small teeth that once covered the palate are lost. The postcranial skeleton does not develop at the same rate as the skull, with ossification (the replacement of cartilage by bone) happening more slowly. Vertebrae and limb bones are poorly developed, ribs and fingers are absent in the early stages, and the scapulocoracoid and ischium are entirely absent through most of development. Once maturity is reached, most bones have <b>fully</b> <b>formed</b> and growth rate slows. The bones of some temnospondyls like Dutuitosaurus show growth marks, possibly an indication that growth rate varied with the change in seasons. Fossils of temnospondyls like Metoposaurus and Cheliderpeton show that individuals grew larger past maturity. The oldest individuals usually have more pitting on their skulls with deeper sulci.|$|E
5|$|The 2761st Engineer Battalion (Special) at Sandia was {{commanded}} by Colonel Gilbert M. Dorland, {{and consisted of}} a headquarters company, a security company (Company A), a bomb assembly company (Company B) and a radiological monitoring company (Company C), although Company C was never <b>fully</b> <b>formed.</b> For training purposes, Company B was initially divided into command, electrical, mechanical and nuclear groups, but the intention was to create three integrated 36-man bomb assembly teams. To free the bomb assembly teams from having to train newcomers, a Technical Training Group (TTG) was created under Lieutenant Colonel John A. Ord, a Signal Corps officer with a Doctor of Science degree from Carnegie Institute of Technology who had directed the training of thousands of radar technicians at the Southern Signal Corps School during the war. The battalion was redesignated the 38th Engineer Battalion (Special) in April 1947, and in July it {{became part of the}} newly created AFSWP Field Command, under the command of Brigadier General Robert M. Montague. The TTG was soon reporting directly to Montague as well.|$|E

5|$|The {{paintings}} depict isolated figures {{enclosed in}} spaces that are undefined, overwhelmingly claustrophobic, reductive and eerie. Coming early in Bacon's career, they are uneven in quality, but show a clear progression especially {{in how they}} utilise and present ideas he was still clearly developing and coming to terms with. Head I (actually begun {{in the winter of}} 1948) and Head II show formless pieces of flesh that broadly resemble human heads; they have half-open eyes and a pharynx, though it is positioned much higher than would be expected in a human. Heads III, IV and V show <b>fully</b> <b>formed</b> busts recognisable as men, and are characterised by a haunted atmosphere. These two broad ideas coalesce in Head VI, which is as physiologically tortured as the first two paintings, and as spectral as the middle three. In Head VI the figure has developed and is now shown wearing vestments, the first indication in Bacon's work of the influence of Velázquez, while the focus has become the open mouth and the study of the human scream.|$|E
5|$|The pupal cocoon is spun from silk, {{but like}} the larval case, often has other {{materials}} attached. When pupating, species that build portable cases attach them to some underwater object, seal {{the front and back}} apertures against predators while still allowing water to flow through, and pupate within it. Once fully developed, most pupal caddisflies cut through their cases with a special pair of mandibles, swim up to the water surface, moult using the exuviae as a floating platform, and emerge as <b>fully</b> <b>formed</b> adults. They can often fly immediately after breaking from their pupal cuticle. Emergence is mainly univoltine (once per year) with all the adults of a species emerging at the same time. Development is within a year in warm places, but takes over a year in high latitudes and at high elevation in mountain lakes and streams.|$|E
5|$|Volvariella surrecta {{is a rare}} species, {{even though}} its major host is quite common; the {{conditions}} required for the parasite to produce fruit bodies are not well known. Some authors have suggested that it may grow equally well as a parasite or a saprobe. V.surrecta has been found on its host in several different habitat types, including birch woodlands, pine plantations, scrub, thickets of small trees or shrubs beside roads, and under brambles. No definite preference for soil type has been determined, having been found in sands, clay, gravels, and peat. In 1867, Worthington George Smith {{reported that he had}} successfully cultivated the species by partially burying fruit bodies under water-soaked rotting fir leaves that were placed in a bell-glass in a warm room. According to his account, a white mycelium grew over the leaves and eventually formed small white pins (immature, undifferentiated fruit bodies) that grew into <b>fully</b> <b>formed</b> mushrooms about two weeks after starting.|$|E

5|$|The Maya sculptural {{tradition}} {{that produced the}} stelae emerged <b>fully</b> <b>formed</b> and had probably been preceded by sculpted wooden monuments. However the tradition of raising stelae had its origin elsewhere in Mesoamerica, among the Olmecs of the Gulf Coast of Mexico. In the Late Preclassic it then spread into the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and southwards along the Pacific Coast to sites such as Chiapa de Corzo, Izapa and Takalik Abaj where Mesoamerican Long Count calendar dates began to be carved onto the stelae. Although at Izapa the stelae depicted mythological scenes, at Takalik Abaj they began to show rulers in Early Classic Maya posture accompanied by calendrical dates and hieroglyphic texts. It was also at Takalik Abaj and Izapa that these stelae began to be paired with circular altars. By approximately 400BC, {{near the end of}} the Middle Preclassic Period, early Maya rulers were raising stelae that celebrated their achievements and validated their right to rule. At ElPortón in the Salamá Valley of highland Guatemala a carved schist stela (Monument1) was erected, the badly eroded hieroglyphs appear to be a very early form of Maya writing and may even be the earliest known example of Maya script. It was associated with a plain altar in a typical stela-altar pairing that would become common across the Maya area. Stela 11 from Kaminaljuyu, a major Preclassic highland city, dates to the Middle Preclassic and is the earliest stela to depict a standing ruler. The sculpted Preclassic stelae from Kaminaljuyu and other cities in the region, such as Chalchuapa in ElSalvador and Chocolá in the Pacific lowlands, tend to depict political succession, sacrifice and warfare.|$|E
