5|$|Lili posed {{a threat}} to Bermuda, and a {{hurricane}} warning as the storm approached, but only gusty winds and light rainfall was reported. As Lili continued westward, it had also posed a significant threat to the East Coast of the United States, since some of the computer models did not predict a northward curve. As a result, several hurricane watches and warnings were issued from Little River Inlet, South Carolina, to Cape Henlopen, Delaware. However, Lili later curved northward, and only caused minor coastal erosion <b>in</b> <b>North</b> <b>Carolina</b> <b>and</b> rainfall in Pennsylvania. Lili began impacting Atlantic Canada as it was transitioning an extratropical cyclone, and the storm reportedly caused strong winds in Nova Scotia and Newfoundland. No damage total or fatalities were reported.|$|E

5|$|Of the season's six {{tropical}} cyclones, five became tropical {{storms and}} four strengthened into hurricanes. Furthermore, {{none of these}} strengthened into a major hurricane—Category3 or higher on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale—marking the seventh such occurrence since 1900. The strongest hurricane of the season peaked as only as a strong Category2 with winds of 110mph (175 km/h). The second hurricane caused one death and $1.45million (1920USD) in damage in Louisiana, the third left one fatality <b>in</b> <b>North</b> <b>Carolina,</b> <b>and</b> the fifth storm indirectly killed one person in Florida.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} Hurricane Floyd in New England {{stretched}} across the region from Connecticut to Maine and included two casualties. Floyd, once a large and powerful hurricane, made landfall <b>in</b> <b>North</b> <b>Carolina</b> <b>and</b> weakened as it tracked northward along the U.S. East Coast. By September 17, 1999, the storm, downgraded in strength to a tropical storm, was situated over New England. It produced heavy rainfall and gusty winds throughout the entire region, leading to widespread downing of trees and extensive power outages before it moved away later that day. In Danbury, Connecticut, Floyd triggered severe flooding, considered the worst in 40 years, that damaged hundreds of homes. Precipitation in some areas amounted to , with wind gusts approaching hurricane force in Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|By about a {{week after}} the passage of the hurricane, President George W. Bush {{declared}} disaster areas for 36North Carolina counties, 77counties and independent cities in Virginia, the entire state of Maryland, all three counties in Delaware and six West Virginia counties. The disaster declaration allocated the use of federal funds for rebuilding and providing aid in the aftermath of hurricane Isabel. By about four months after the passage of the hurricane, disaster aid totaled about $516million (2003USD, $ USD), primarily <b>in</b> <b>North</b> <b>Carolina</b> <b>and</b> Virginia. Over 166,000 residents applied for individual assistance, with about $117million (2003USD, $ USD) approved for residents to assist with temporary housing and home repairs. About 50,000business owners applied for Small Business Administration loans, with about $178million (2003USD, $ USD) approved for the assistance loans.

He was promoted to captain in July 1945, shortly before the Pacific War's end, but was uncertain of securing a regular commission in the Marine Corps. He was ordered back to Cherry Point, where he joined VMF-913, another Corsair squadron, and learned that he had qualified for a regular commission. In March 1946, he was assigned to Marine Corps Air Station El Toro in southern California. He volunteered for service with the occupation in North China, believing that it would be a short tour. He joined VMF-218 (yet another Corsair squadron), which was based at Nanyuan Field near Beijing, in December 1946, and flew patrol missions until VMF-218 was transferred to Guam in March 1947. He finally returned home in December 1948.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Barbara was {{the second}} named {{tropical}} cyclone of the 1953 Atlantic hurricane season. Forming from a tropical wave on August 11 in the southern Bahamas, Barbara moved northward and attained hurricane status the next day. Ultimately peaking with winds corresponding to Category 2 status on the modern-day Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, Barbara moved ashore in eastern North Carolina and curved back out to sea. The storm passed to the southeast of the New England region and dissipated on August 16. Damage from the hurricane was fairly minor, totaling around $1.3million (1953USD, $ USD). Most of it occurred <b>in</b> <b>North</b> <b>Carolina</b> <b>and</b> Virginia from crop damage. The hurricane left several injuries, some traffic accidents, as well as seven fatalities in the eastern United States; at least two were due to electrocution from downed power lines.

5|$|Randolph Chitwood, a cardiothoracic surgeon with East Carolina, {{performed}} the first minimally invasive robotic-assisted mitral-valve heart {{surgery in the}} United States. East Carolina researchers also developed an electronic fluency device called SpeechEasy; the device is designed to improve the fluency {{of a person who}} stutters by changing the sound of the user's voice in his or her ear. Walter Pories, a faculty member at The Brody School of Medicine developed the standard procedure for gastric bypass surgery. Researchers here also first discovered that 80% of obese/type 2 diabetic patients who underwent this surgical procedure had a reversal of the disease. The Biofeedback Lab is currently developing techniques to help service members recover from posttraumatic stress disorders and traumatic brain injuries they received in Afghanistan and Iraq. The in vitro fertilization program is ranked first <b>in</b> <b>North</b> <b>Carolina</b> <b>and</b> fourth overall in the United States.

5|$|The 1986 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season officially began on June1, 1986, and lasted until November30, 1986. These dates conventionally delimit {{the period of}} each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin. During the 1986 season, the first subtropical depression formed {{in the first week}} of June, while the last tropical cyclone dissipated at the end of the third week of November. The 1986 season had lower than average activity because of an ongoing El Niño event, and was the least active season in the North Atlantic since the 1983 Atlantic {{hurricane season}}. This was also the first season since 1972 to have no major hurricanes. Earl was the strongest hurricane of the season, reaching Category 2 status. Few storms caused significant damage; Hurricane Bonnie caused heavy rains and flooding across southeast Texas when it made landfall near Sea Rim State Park. Hurricane Charley caused limited damage <b>in</b> <b>North</b> <b>Carolina</b> <b>and</b> Massachusetts, but crossed the Atlantic as an extratropical cyclone and caused considerable damage in the British Isles.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} Hurricane Floyd in New York {{included}} two deaths {{and millions of}} dollars in damage. Hurricane Floyd, once a large and powerful Category 4 hurricane, made landfall <b>in</b> <b>North</b> <b>Carolina</b> <b>and</b> moved northward along the East Coast, making landfall on Long Island as a tropical storm. The threat of the hurricane prompted schools in New York City to close {{for the first time since}} 1996, and 20 shelters were opened. Floyd produced flooding rainfall and gusty winds throughout the state, from the southern Hudson Valley to the Lake Champlain area. The flood waters damaged multiple roads and forced residents to evacuate from certain locations. Strong winds left as many as 100,000 people without power and brought down a high number of trees due to the saturated ground. In the aftermath of the storm, 15 counties in eastern New York were declared eligible for state or federal assistance.|$|E
5|$|The first {{storm was}} tracked {{beginning}} on June30 offshore North Carolina. It moved eastward and was last noted {{on the following}} day. However, no tropical cyclones were reported {{in the remainder of}} July or August. Activity resume when another tropical storm was located southeast of the Bahamas on September6. It intensified into a hurricane before making landfall <b>in</b> <b>North</b> <b>Carolina</b> <b>and</b> was last noted over the north Atlantic Ocean on September17. The SS Central America sank offshore, drowning 424 passengers and crew members. Another hurricane may have existed east of South Carolina between September22 and October26, though little information is available. The final documented tropical cyclone was initially observed east of Lesser Antilles on September24. It traversed the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico, striking the Yucatán Peninsula and later Port Isabel, Texas. The storm dissipated on September30. In Texas, damage was reported in several towns near the mouth of the Rio Grande River.|$|E
