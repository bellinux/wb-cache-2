5|$|During investigations, {{which usually}} take place before or in between trial sessions, the player gathers {{information}} and <b>evidence</b> {{by talking to}} characters such as their client, witnesses, and the police. The player is able to move around a cursor to examine various things in the environment. By using a menu, the player can move to different locations, examine <b>evidence,</b> and present <b>evidence</b> to other characters; by showing certain pieces of <b>evidence</b> to some witnesses, the player can get access to new information. In the game's fifth case, created for the DS version and used in all subsequent releases, the player is able to examine <b>evidence</b> more closely, rotating it to view it from all sides and zooming in or out on it using touchscreen controls; they are also able to move a cursor to investigate specific parts of the <b>evidence.</b> The fifth case also features forensics tests that the player can use at crime scenes to find clues: the player can spray luminol by tapping areas they want to examine on the touch screen, which makes the player able to see otherwise invisible blood stains; and they can touch the touch screen to apply aluminum flake powder in order to search for finger prints. After applying it, they can blow into the microphone to reveal the prints. Once the player has gathered enough <b>evidence,</b> the investigation section ends.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe glucose {{metabolism}} of Fibrobacter succinogenes S 85 was studied in detail; key intermediates and alternative pathways were <b>evidenced</b> by NMR and/or enzymatic assays. A high phosphoketolase activity was detected in four strains of Fibrobacter under strictly anaerobic conditions, with ribose- 5 -phosphate as substrate, no activity was <b>evidenced</b> with fructose- 6 -phosphate. This {{is the first}} report of a pentose phosphates phosphoketolase in bacteria unable to use pentoses. In contrast, the Entner-Doudoroff pathway and the oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway could not be <b>evidenced.</b> Incubation of living cells of F. succinogenes with Na 213 CO 3 confirmed the incorporation of 13 CO 2 in the carboxylic group of succinate. The presence of fumarase was <b>evidenced</b> by in vivo 13 C-NMR using 2 -heptyl- 4 -hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide (HQNO); the enzyme showed a high reversibility under physiological conditions. The production of formate from glucose catabolism was <b>evidenced</b> by enzymatic assay and by NMR and a pyruvate formate lyase activity was detected using strictly anaerobic conditions...|$|R
