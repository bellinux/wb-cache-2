2500|$|One round {{passed between}} Kemp's {{shoulder}} and head upon which Kemp stated he wet himself although {{on another occasion}} he later claimed {{this may have been}} due to a split water pouch. Kemp [...] "went straight down, cutting my <b>face</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> hit the ground." [...] The crew were pinned down by accurate fire from AK-47s and rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs), with five to seven RPGs flying over their heads by just a metre and bullets passing inches from their heads and hitting the ground either side of them. It was speculated that a sniper had targeted Kemp possibly because they knew they were journalists, or because their blue protective clothing looked unusual, and the camera may have looked like a weapon. The crew were pinned down for [...] "about seven to ten minutes" [...] with return fire commencing after [...] "three or four minutes" [...] after the soldiers had got into cover. Only after fierce return fire and a delay of three or four minutes could the crew be extracted.|$|E

60|$|Amused as I {{was at the}} ingenious jumble he {{had made}} of Spencer's words, I kept as grave a <b>face</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> could.|$|E
6000|$|To this Mr Codlin, {{who had a}} surly, grumbling manner, replied, as he twitched Punch off the {{tombstone}} {{and flung}} him into the box, 'I don't care if we haven't lost a farden, but you're too free. If you {{stood in front of}} the curtain and see the public's <b>faces</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> do, you'd know human natur' better.' ...|$|R
60|$|She was {{standing}} in thought, a doubtful expression on her <b>face.</b> But <b>as</b> <b>I</b> looked at her she shook her head.|$|R
60|$|I saw a {{man with}} {{close-cropped}} red hair and a large square-jowled <b>face,</b> such <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have seen upon an English prize-fighter.|$|R
60|$|He listened very gravely; his <b>face,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> went on, {{expressed}} more concern than astonishment; he did {{not immediately}} speak when I had concluded.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thought I knowed the man's <b>face</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> seed {{him on the}} rick!--thought I did! And where be ye trading o't to now, shepherd?" ...|$|E
60|$|A change {{passed over}} her <b>face</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> spoke; a vague doubt of me {{began to show}} itself in her eyes. She drew back a little, without making any reply.|$|E
60|$|It was {{a fearful}} cry--doubly fearful {{on a ship}} {{hundreds}} of miles from land--and my <b>face</b> blanched <b>as</b> <b>I</b> sprang to my feet.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! Steve! poor Stevie! The accursed boar has rent his goodly <b>face</b> so <b>as</b> <b>I</b> {{would never}} have known him. Poor Steve! Best his soul!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When {{the mask}} was removed I saw her <b>face.</b> Not <b>as</b> <b>I</b> {{remember}} {{it in the}} pride of her youth and beauty--not even <b>as</b> <b>I</b> remember her on her sick-bed--but <b>as</b> <b>I</b> remember her in her coffin." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'I {{am afraid}} that that is quite impossible,' said I. He had been {{watching}} me eagerly out of his small eyes, and I could see a shadow pass over his <b>face</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> spoke.|$|E
60|$|Wherefore, I say, I ordered down my cowardice, and, looking {{both of them}} as {{squarely}} in the <b>face</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> knew how, passed out of the open into the appalling yard of this wooden house.|$|E
60|$|My {{guardian}} {{had come}} home and was standing thoughtfully by the dark window. When I went in, his face cleared {{and he came to}} his seat, but he caught the light upon my <b>face</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> took mine.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not a bit. He has dark hair--almost a Grecian nose, regular teeth, and an {{intellectual}} <b>face,</b> <b>as</b> nearly <b>as</b> <b>I</b> can recall to mind.' ...|$|R
60|$|Lady Dennisford had failed. I {{saw it in}} her <b>face</b> <b>as</b> soon <b>as</b> <b>I</b> {{entered the}} room, and her first few words {{confirmed}} it.|$|R
60|$|The old man's <b>face</b> fell <b>as</b> <b>I</b> {{answered}} {{that time was}} pressing, and I must return the following day, while for some reason Alice turned her face aside, but she laughed pleasantly.|$|R
60|$|I {{thought of}} her <b>face</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> had seen it in the half light--a faint {{impression}} of delicate colourlessness, and {{for the life of}} me I could not help a little shiver. Lady Angela looked at me in surprise.|$|E
6000|$|... "When {{both the}} infidels {{are about to}} die before her <b>face,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> still hope to see them do, we may learn the answer. But unless she wills it, never before," [...] he replied, and the Sultan noted his saying.|$|E
6000|$|... "A terrible change {{came over}} the woman's <b>face</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> asked the question. Her {{features}} turned perfectly livid. It was some seconds before she could get out the single word 'Yes'--and when it did come {{it was in a}} husky unnatural tone.|$|E
60|$|I {{watched her}} <b>face</b> {{carefully}} <b>as</b> <b>I</b> spoke, and I thought that I detected a very faint flush mounting her cheek. Seeing an opening and an advantage, I sought {{to follow it}} up.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Mr Broster. I {{always think}} of him as Reggie. He's one of Nature's Reggies. Such a kind, honest <b>face.</b> Well, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> was saying, Reggie {{discovered}} {{that it was time for}} lessons, and sent Ogden upstairs.' ...|$|R
60|$|I {{took a step}} forward, {{but before}} I could gain the threshold, the door was slammed in my <b>face,</b> and <b>as</b> <b>I</b> stood there, quivering with anger and disappointment, I heard the bolts being shot within.|$|R
6000|$|... "Craig!" [...] she cried. [...] "Craig! I saw his <b>face</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> sat in {{my chair}} there, talking to the Captain. I saw a man's white face--nothing else. He must have been leaning over the rail. He heard me call out and he disappeared." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, that {{is really}} the difficulty. We might dye that hair of his and darken his <b>face,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> {{am going to do}} myself. There are tall men in France, and even his inches would not matter so much; the danger lies in his speech." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{remember}} too {{the petty}} little difficulty I felt whether I should ignore these pickets altogether, or lift a hat as I hurried past with averted eyes, or look {{them in the}} <b>face</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> did so. Towards the end the House evoked an etiquette of salutation.|$|E
5000|$|The {{result was}} the series of portraits known <b>as</b> <b>Faces</b> <b>I</b> Have Met.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mademoiselle," [...] the Vicomte answered, fixing {{his dark}} eyes impressively upon her, [...] "for you there remains the hardest of all tasks--inaction. Believe me that when I came here, {{it was not my}} {{intention}} to put {{the truth of the matter}} so plainly before you. Neither was it the will of those whose orders I carry out. But I, Mademoiselle, before all things, I believe in inspiration. I find in Mademoiselle"--he bowed once more--"qualities which alter the situation. I--a judge of <b>faces</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> venture to believe myself--have looked into yours, and many things have happened." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> saw Cavor's <b>face,</b> <b>as</b> white <b>as</b> <b>I</b> felt my own to be. We {{regarded}} {{one another}} in silence. The transparent blackness of the glass behind him made him seem as though he floated in a void.|$|R
6000|$|There was a smile {{come upon}} his <b>face</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> spoke, {{and he looked}} down upon Nathaniel and me, who were wedged among that throng which watched the {{apprentices}} quarrel, until we were like to be squeezed flat, and said in what I took to be a friendly tone: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{not trust}} {{too much to}} that Dillon, sir," [...] {{returned}} the anxious boy, in a whisper; [...] "if you had seen his <b>face,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> did, when the binnacle light fell upon it, as he came up the cabin ladder, you would put no faith in him." ...|$|E
60|$|A sudden {{recollection}} {{came to me}} of Ned Brooke's <b>face</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> {{had seen}} it the day before at the gate, coupled with the remembrance of seeing him walking down the lane at a quick pace, so unlike his usual shambling gait, while I ran through the lawn.|$|E

40|$|Although I {{believe the}} best way to learn is with a {{hands-on}} experience, we can also learn from other's experiences. For my Senior Thesis project I have created a self-promotional website which combines my resume, portfolio, skills, fine arts pieces, and personality into one cohesive body of work which can be viewed independently. This process has strengthened my knowledge of web design applications and extended my education. Along with the website I have written a brief documentation of the successes and problems <b>I</b> <b>faced</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> constructed this piece. From that paper I have also created a teaching aid for beginning web design students and peers to prepare them for common occurrences with in this field. Honors CollegeThesis (B. ?. ...|$|R
