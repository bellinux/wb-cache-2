40|$|Chromosomal {{instability}} (CIN) underlies malignant {{properties of}} many solid cancers {{and their ability}} to escape therapy, and it might itself cause cancer [1, 2]. CIN is sustained by deficiencies in proteins, such as the tumor suppressor p 53 [3 - 5], that police genome integrity, but the primary cause of CIN in sporadic cancers remains uncertain [6, 7]. The primary suspects are mutations that deregulate telomere maintenance, or mitosis, yet such mutations have not been identified in the majority of sporadic cancers [6]. Alternatively, CIN could be caused by a transient event that destabilizes the genome without permanently affecting mechanisms of mitosis or proliferation [5, 8]. Here, we show that an otherwise <b>harmless</b> <b>virus</b> rapidly causes massive chromosomal instability by fusing cells whose cell cycle is deregulated by oncogenes. This synergy between fusion and oncogenes "randomizes" normal diploid human fibroblasts so extensively that each analyzed cell has a unique karyotype, and some produce aggressive, highly aneuploid, heterogeneous, and transplantable epithelial cancers in mice. Because many viruses are fusogenic, this study suggests that viruses, including those that have not been linked to carcinogenesis, can cause chromosomal instability and, consequently, cancer by fusing cells...|$|E
40|$|Lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) is an {{apparently}} innocuous and persistent virus that can modify mouse immune reactions. We {{have shown that}} LDV-infected mice immunized with human growth hormone (hGH) showed a deep modification of the specificity of the anti-hGH antibodies (Ab) in CBA/Ht mice but not BALB/c animals. The aim of this work was to extend the previous observations to another mouse strain, C 57 BL/ 6, {{as well as to}} an antigen unrelated to hGH, ovalbumin (OVA), and to explore {{at the same time the}} production of various cytokines at serum and cellular levels. The amount of Ab directed to hGH or OVA native antigenic determinants versus the concentration of Ab to cryptic epitopes was evaluated by ELISA competition experiments. Results indicated that LDV infection affected Ab specificity solely in CBA/Ht mice. In CBA/Ht the virus infection was associated with a reduction of the Ab titers to hGH native epitopes and with a decrease of IL- 13 and IL- 17 serum levels, but Ab to native OVA epitopes were increased with a simultaneous increase of IL- 17. Accordingly, only lymph node cells from infected CBA/Ht mice immunized with OVA were found to produce INF-γ, IL- 13 and IL- 17. Thus, a correlation of cytokine production with a change in Ab specificity after a viral infection was found, although this phenomenon was restricted to a given antigen and to the genetic background of immunized animals. These observations suggest that an apparent <b>harmless</b> <b>virus</b> can affect some immunological mechanisms, which could lead, for example, to inflammatory or autoimmune disorders...|$|E

40|$|What {{force was}} great enough to wipe from Earth {{not only the}} woolly mammoth but all the other megafauna that once roamed the planet, from the saber toothed tiger to the giant sloth? These giant beasts all {{vanished}} from the fossil record around the same time, about 15 thousand years ago, {{at the end of}} the Pleistocene. Many scientists believe the mass megafauna extinctions were caused by hunting and/or a sudden change in climate. This radio broadcast explores the theory that the extinctions were caused by a highly lethal infectious disease. The scientist investigating this hyperdisease theory by analyzing woolly mammoth remains from Siberia, is trying to isolate the super virus he believes wiped out these furry beasts. The broadcast discusses how likely it may be that a virus can cause the total devastation of extinction, by being both highly infectious and lethal at the same time; whether humans carried a virus with them to the New World which later jumped to large animals; and the difficulty of proving a virus found within animal remains was lethal, as opposed to one of many <b>harmless</b> <b>viruses.</b> The broadcast is about 29 minutes in length.

40|$|Since the mid 60 's {{the human}} coronaviruses (HCoV), {{represented}} by HCoV-OC 43 and HCoV- 229 E, were generally considered relatively <b>harmless</b> <b>viruses.</b> This status changed dramatically {{with the emergence}} of SARS-CoV in 2002 / 2003. The SARS-CoV pandemic took 774 lives around the globe and infected more than 8000 people in 29 countries. SARS-CoV is believed to be of zoonotic origin, transmitted from its natural reservoir in bats through several animal species (e. g., civet cats, raccoon dogs sold for human consumption in markets in southern China). The epidemic was halted in 2003 by a highly effective global public health response, and SARS-CoV is currently not circulating in humans. The outbreak of SARS-CoV and the danger of its re-introduction into the human population, as well as the danger of the emergence of other zoonotic coronaviral infections triggered an intense survey for an efficient treatment that resulted in the evaluation of several anticoronaviral compounds. HCoV-NL 63 and HCoV-HKU 1 were identified shortly after the SARS-CoV outbreak. The 4 human coronaviruses HCoV- 229 E, HCoV-OC 43, HCoV-NL 63 and HCoV-HKU 1 cause mild respiratory illnesses when compared to SARS, but these infections are involved in 10 - 20 % of hospitalizations of young children and immunocompromised adults with respiratory tract illness. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a successful therapy to prevent disease induction or a vaccine to prevent new infections.

5000|$|AIDS denialism is {{the denial}} {{that the human}} {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) {{is the cause of}} acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). AIDS denialism has been described as being [...] "among the most vocal anti-science denial movements".

Insofar as denialists acknowledge AIDS as a real disease, they attribute it to some combination of recreational drug use, malnutrition, poor sanitation, and side effects of antiretroviral medication, rather than infection with HIV. However, the evidence that HIV causes AIDS is scientifically conclusive and the scientific community rejects and ignores AIDS-denialist claims as based on faulty reasoning, cherry picking, and misrepresentation of mainly outdated scientific data. With the rejection of these arguments by the scientific community, AIDS-denialist material is now spread mainly through the Internet.|$|R
50|$|Haemophilia is {{considered}} the best test of the HIV-AIDS hypothesis by both denialists and AIDS researchers. While Duesberg claims AIDS in haemophiliacs is caused by contaminated clotting factors and HIV is a <b>harmless</b> passenger <b>virus,</b> this result is contradicted by large studies on haemophiliac patients who received contaminated blood. A comparison of groups receiving high, medium {{and low levels of}} contaminated clotting factors found the death rates differed significantly depending on HIV status. Of 396 HIV positive haemophiliacs followed between 1985 and 1993, 153 died. The comparative figure for the HIV negative group was one out of 66, despite comparable doses of contaminated clotting factors. A comparison of individuals receiving blood donations also supports the results; in 1994 there were 6888 individuals with AIDS who had their HIV infection traced to blood transfusions. Since the introduction of HIV testing, the number of individuals whose AIDS status can be traced to blood transfusions was only 29 (as of 1994).|$|R

SNB is inherited through recessive genes.Progressive retinal atrophy PRA, {{is a disease}} that causes nerve cells {{at the back of}} the eye to degenerate. The condition usually begins in older pets and can lead to blindness. Progressive retinal degeneration or atrophy (PRD/PRA) represents a group of inherited eye diseases characterized by abnormal development or premature degeneration of the retina. There are two types of photoreceptors in the retina and these are the light-sensitive rods and cones. They are responsible for detecting light and converting it into an electrical signal that travels to the brain. When the photoreceptor cells deteriorate, vision is lost because the animal has no way to generate an image from the light reaching the retina. Puppies are usually blind before one year of age.For the first time ever, animals (Briards) that were born blind gained the ability to see after undergoing gene therapy, according to research from the University of Florida, Cornell University and the University of Pennsylvania.UF researchers had established that the apparently <b>harmless</b> adeno-associated <b>virus</b> can carry healthy copies of a gene into the cells of the retina, which is composed of layers of light-sensitive nerve cells. The healthy gene's mission: to produce a protein critical to translating light waves into nerve impulses that can be interpreted as images by the brain. The study was successful and the puppies could see in the eye that was treated. Officials from the Foundation Fighting Blindness, which supported the study with grant funds, said the success in reversing blindness in dogs is an important advance.|$|R
40|$|Respiratory tract {{infections are}} a major global health concern, {{accounting}} for high morbidity and mortality, especially in young children and elderly individuals. Traditionally, highly common bacterial respiratory tract infections, including otitis media and pneumonia, {{were thought to be}} caused by a limited number of pathogens including Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. However, these pathogens are also frequently observed commensal residents of the upper respiratory tract (URT) and form-together with <b>harmless</b> commensal bacteria, <b>viruses</b> and fungi-intricate ecological networks, collectively known as the 'microbiome'. Analogous to the gut microbiome, the respiratory microbiome at equilibrium is thought to be beneficial to the host by priming the immune system and providing colonization resistance, while an imbalanced ecosystem might predispose to bacterial overgrowth and development of respiratory infections. We postulate that specific ecological perturbations of the bacterial communities in the URT can occur in response to various lifestyle or environmental effectors, leading to diminished colonization resistance, loss of containment of newly acquired or resident pathogens, preluding bacterial overgrowth, ultimately resulting in local or systemic bacterial infections. Here, we review the current body of literature regarding niche-specific upper respiratory microbiota profiles within human hosts and the changes occurring within these profiles that are associated with respiratory infections...|$|R
40|$|Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a human-specific gamma-herpes virus of the Lymphocryptovirus genus {{that has}} succeeded to colonize more than 90 % {{of the adult}} population. EBV s {{coevolution}} with humans has established a largely harmless co-existence {{that depends on the}} variability of viral gene expression and on the immunological host response. Though infection with EBV is generally <b>harmless,</b> the <b>virus</b> is associated with multiple human tumors, such as Burkitt lymphoma, classical Hodgkin lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders, and AIDS lymphomas. The role of EBV in the malignant transformation is still enigmatic even after more than 40 years of research on this virus. EBV readily infects B-lymphocytes in vitro. After infection the virus establishes a latent infection and expresses 9 viral proteins. The concerted effect of these EBV proteins will be the activation and proliferation of the infected B cells. This viral gene expression pattern was named type III latency. As the EBV-infected B cells with type III latency are highly immunogenic they are readily detected and killed by the specific cytotoxic T cells. In contrast to the EBV-infected normal B cells, the majority of the EBV-carrying tumors do not express all the nine proteins; rather they express only EBNA- 1 or EBNA- 1 together with the latent membrane proteins (LMP- 1 and LMP- 2). The factors that determine what viral genes EBV will express in the different normal and malignant cells are only partially known. Motivated by the lack of in vitro models in which to study the interaction of EBV with the malignant Hodgkin/Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells, we infected with EBV one of the Hodgkin lymphoma-derived cell lines and studied the viral gene expression in this EBV-converted subline. In this system we identified two cytokines, IL- 4 and IL- 13, that could modulate the viral gene expression (specifically, induce the expression of LMP- 1) and with their help we could for the first time reconstitute in vitro the EBV gene expression seen in the classical Hodgkin lymphomas in vivo. We have also studied the molecular mechanisms that are responsible for the induction of LMP- 1 by IL- 4 and IL- 13. Through these studies we identified STAT 6 as an important inducer of LMP- 1 expression. As STAT 6 is constitutively activated in the majority of Hodgkin lymphomas, our results not only provides an explanation how LMP- 1 is expressed in the EBV-carrying HRS cells, but might also have future therapeutic implications. Further work identified two additional cytokines, IL- 10 and IL- 21, which could induce the expression of LMP- 1 in EBV-positive B cell and NK cell lymphoma-derived cell lines. The effect of IL- 21 was pleiotropic: it could induce LMP- 1 in cells that did not express it, and it induced the plasma cell differentiation and down-regulation of expression of the EBV nuclear antigens (EBNA- 1 to - 6) in type III lymphoblastoid and Burkitt lymphoma cell lines. Furthermore, when isolated human CD 4 + T cells were co-cultured with different EBVcarrying lymphoma cell lines, we found that upon activation they were capable of inducing the expression of LMP- 1, just as the recombinant cytokines did. Altogether our results provide evidence for an important role for the cytokines secreted by CD 4 + T or other inflammatory cells in the modulation of EBV latent gene expression...|$|R
40|$|Foot-and-mouth disease, {{also known}} as FMD, {{is caused by the}} aphthovirus Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), which is a highly {{contagious}} disease of cloven-hoofed animals. It is endemic in Africa, parts of South America and southern Asia. In South Africa, the disease is controlled essentially through prophylactic vaccination. Current vaccines on the market are chemically inactivated virus strains. However, these are not considered ideal due to the possibly insufficient inactivation which could fail to render the <b>virus</b> <b>harmless.</b> Research on recombinant vaccines which obviate the need for high biosafety requirements for vaccine preparation has shown that recombinant FMDV virus-like particles (VLPs), devoid of viral genetic material, are an ideal vaccine candidate as they are as immunogenic as the virions themselves when administered to animals. These VLPs are formed by the assembly of the FMDV capsid proteins VP 0, VP 1 and VP 3, which are generated upon the proteolytic cleavage of the capsid precursor protein P 1 - 2 A, by the FMDV 3 C-protease. The expression platforms used to co-express and produce the component capsid proteins and the protease are usually mammalian, insect or E. coli cells. The use of these expression systems requires extensive bioreactor infrastructure and sterile conditions for vaccine preparation which are costly. In addition, some studies have shown how the co-expression of the 3 C-protease can prove to be deleterious when expressed at a high concentration in expression systems. In order to circumvent this, and encourage more efficient production of the capsid proteins and subsequent VLP assembly, researchers have shown that the levels of the 3 C-protease can be down-regulated by introducing mutations in the 3 C gene or a ribosomal frameshift in the gene sequence which subsequently reduce its deleterious effect. Our laboratory has previously shown that similar FMDV VLPs can be assembled by the expression of FMDV P 1 - 2 A (referred to as oP 1 - 2 A, in this study), {{in the absence of the}} 3 C-protease in the plant Nicotiana benthamiana, albeit in low amounts. This platform does not require high biocontainment facilities for the production of recombinant proteins and VLPs and the process is easily scalable. This study centers mainly on optimisation of the FMDV capsid protein expression in N. benthamiana in order to increase VLP yields. I first used codon-optimisation as an approach to improve expression of the capsid proteins and compared expression in the presence and absence of the 3 C-protease, using mP 1 - 2 A- 3 C (a new codon-optimised construct), mP 1 - 2 A and oP 1 - 2 A. Electron microscopy (EM) showed that VLPs resulting from the expression of both mP 1 - 2 A- 3 C and mP 1 - 2 A were very low in yield, and irregular in shape and size compared to those produced using oP 1 - 2 A. The stability of the plant-produced VLPs was assessed by counting numbers of VLPs, when it was seen that expression of mP 1 - 2 A- 3 C compared to oP 1 - 2 A produced an average of 1 VLP per field of view versus 3 VLPs per view, for the same magnification. Furthermore, maturation trials at room temperature was performed on the oP 1 - 2 A VLPs, whereby a time-point between 30 to 45 minutes was considered ideal to produce stable VLPs. It is also known that FMDV, unlike the other members of the Picornaviridae family, is acid and heat-labile. The second aim of this study was to promote the stability, and hence encourage the amount of the VLPs produced, by engineering acid and heat-resistant mutants, namely, VP 1 N 17 D, VP 2 H 93 C and VP 1 N 17 D/VP 4 S 73 N using site-directed mutagenesis. A fourth mutant, VP 3 A 118 V which is acid sensitive was used as a control in downstream experiments. The mutants were subjected to a lower than normal pH and a higher than normal temperature. Expression of oP 1 - 2 A from the pH and heat assays was assessed to be better than its mutants. The optimum VLP count of 3 VLPs per field of view, was achieved from expression of oP 1 - 2 A, after treatment at pH 6. 2, compared to 2 VLPs or 1 VLP per field of view for the other mutants tested under all the different conditions. The final aim of this study was to test the immunogenicity of the VLPs from expression of oP 1 - 2 A in Balb/C mice. Due to the low yields of VLPs obtained from purification through a continuous gradient, a partial purification method was adopted. Two experimental groups of animals were either vaccinated with P 1 - 2 A VLPs or with adjuvanted P 1 - 2 A VLPs. A control group was administered with partially-purified plant extract, previously infiltrated with pEAQ-HT. The two experimental groups elicited a marginal increase in humoral immune response at 41 days post vaccination (dpv), which increased significantly at 58 dpv. To my knowledge, this is the first study showing that VLPs produced from expression of FMDV P 1 - 2 A only, in tobacco plants, can withstand otherwise degradative acidic and heat conditions. This characteristic has potential for extending the shelf-life of such a candidate vaccine. I also implemented maturation steps to further promote the stability of such VLPs. Finally, the partially purified VLPs showed that they stimulate a significant FMDV P 1 - 2 A-specific immune response, particularly in combination with the adjuvant Montanide suggesting that it has potential as a candidate FMDV vaccine...|$|R
