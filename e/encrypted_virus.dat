5000|$|Polymorphic {{code was}} the first {{technique}} that posed {{a serious threat to}} virus scanners. Just like regular encrypted viruses, a polymorphic virus infects files with an encrypted copy of itself, which is decoded by a decryption module. In the case of polymorphic viruses, however, this decryption module is also modified on each infection. A well-written polymorphic virus therefore has no parts which remain identical between infections, making it very difficult to detect directly using [...] "signatures". Antivirus software can detect it by decrypting the viruses using an emulator, or by statistical pattern analysis of the <b>encrypted</b> <b>virus</b> body. To enable polymorphic code, the virus has to have a polymorphic engine (also called [...] "mutating engine" [...] or [...] "mutation engine") somewhere in its encrypted body. See polymorphic code for technical detail on how such engines operate.|$|E

50|$|In the cryptoviral {{extortion}} attack, the <b>virus</b> hybrid <b>encrypts</b> {{plaintext data}} on the victim's machine using the randomly generated IV and SK. The IV+SK are then <b>encrypted</b> using the <b>virus</b> writer's public key. In theory the victim must negotiate with the virus writer to get the IV+SK back in order to decrypt the ciphertext (assuming there are no backups). Analysis of the virus reveals the public key, not the IV and SK needed for decryption, or the private key needed to recover the IV and SK. This result {{was the first to}} show that computational complexity theory can be used to devise malware that is robust against reverse-engineering.|$|R
40|$|Recently, the {{software}} virus Ransomware spread like a cyclone wind. As a cyclone wind creates atmospheric instability, Ransomware similarly creates computer data instability. Each user {{moves in the}} direction of digitization. The user securely holds data in his/her computer, but what if the data are “abducted”. Ransomware is a software virus that parses user data. This software can lock the system in a manner in which a person is forced to pay a ransom to retrieve his/her data. Ransomware attacks not only home computers but also company computers. This software <b>virus</b> <b>encrypts</b> data such that it cannot be deciphered by a regular individual. Thus, an individual has to pay the ransom to decrypt the data. However, the generated files are unrecognized by the computer system. This study provides an intensive review of the WannaCry Ransomware, its effect on the world of information, and the preventive measures implemented to control this Ransomware...|$|R
5000|$|An {{article that}} {{describes}} [...] "useful virus functionalities" [...] {{was published by}} J. B. Gunn under the title [...] "Use of virus functions to provide a virtual APL interpreter under user control" [...] in 1984. The first IBM PC virus in the [...] "wild" [...] was a boot sector virus dubbed (c)Brain, created in 1986 by the Farooq Alvi Brothers in Lahore, Pakistan, reportedly to deter unauthorized copying of the software they had written. The first virus to specifically target Microsoft Windows, WinVir was discovered in April 1992, {{two years after the}} release of Windows 3.0. The virus did not contain any Windows API calls, instead relying on DOS interrupts. A few years later, in February 1996, Australian hackers from the virus-writing crew VLAD created the Bizatch virus (also known as [...] "Boza" [...] virus), which was the first known virus to target Windows 95. In late 1997 the <b>encrypted,</b> memory-resident stealth <b>virus</b> Win32.Cabanas was released—the first known virus that targeted Windows NT (it was also able to infect Windows 3.0 and Windows 9x hosts).|$|R
