Controlled human exposure studies have demonstrated impaired vascular function after inhalation of exhaust generated by a diesel engine under idling conditions. Objectives: To assess the vascular and fibrinolytic effects of exposure to <b>diesel</b> <b>exhaust</b> generated during urban-cycle running conditions that mimic ambient 'real-world' exposures. Methods: In a randomised double-blind crossover study, eighteen healthy male volunteers were exposed to <b>diesel</b> <b>exhaust</b> (approximately 250 mu g/m(3)) or filtered air for one hour during intermittent exercise. <b>Diesel</b> <b>exhaust</b> was generated during the urban part of the standardized European Transient Cycle. Six hours post-exposure, vascular vasomotor and fibrinolytic function was assessed during venous occlusion plethysmography with intra-arterial agonist infusions. Measurements and Main Results: Forearm blood flow increased in a dose-dependent manner with both endothelial-dependent (acetylcholine and bradykinin) and endothelial-independent (sodium nitroprusside and verapamil) vasodilators. <b>Diesel</b> <b>exhaust</b> exposure attenuated the vasodilatation to acetylcholine (P < 0. 001), bradykinin (P < 0. 05), sodium nitroprusside (P < 0. 05) and verapamil (P < 0. 001). In addition, the net release of tissue plasminogen activator during bradykinin infusion was impaired following <b>diesel</b> <b>exhaust</b> exposure (P < 0. 05). Conclusion: Exposure to <b>diesel</b> <b>exhaust</b> generated under transient running conditions, as a relevant model of urban air pollution, impairs vasomotor function and endogenous fibrinolysis {{in a similar way}} as exposure to <b>diesel</b> <b>exhaust</b> generated at idling. This indicates that adverse vascular effects of <b>diesel</b> <b>exhaust</b> inhalation occur over different running conditions with varying exhaust composition and concentrations as well as physicochemical particle properties.

40|$|The U. S. Bureau of Mines {{and others}} have {{conducted}} a number of occupational exposure surveys {{since the publication of}} the International Agency for Research on Cancer report of 1989 (1), which labeled <b>diesel</b> <b>exhaust</b> as a probable human carcinogen. These surveys have assessed <b>diesel</b> <b>exhaust</b> exposure using measurement of diesel aerosol and/or specific polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons as indicators of exposure. This report reviews, available <b>diesel</b> <b>exhaust</b> aerosol and gas measurement techniques. Measurement of human exposure to toxic agents {{is the first step in}} determining the exposure-dose-response relationship. It is a fundamental step in risk assessment. Measuring exposure to <b>diesel</b> <b>exhaust</b> pollutants is particularly challenging due to the complexity and variability of exhaust components. This paper reviews current occupational health standards for diesel emissions and available <b>diesel</b> <b>exhaust</b> gas and aerosol measurement techniques. Although surveys in mines have primarily assessed <b>diesel</b> <b>exhaust</b> exposure using <b>diesel</b> particulate matter (DPM) some exhaust gas measurements have been used as indicators of exposure.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Air {{pollution}} particulates {{have been}} identified as having adverse effects on respiratory health. The present study was undertaken to further clarify the effects of <b>diesel</b> <b>exhaust</b> on bronchoalveolar cells and soluble components in normal healthy subjects. The study was also designed to evaluate whether a ceramic particle trap {{at the end of the}} tail pipe, from an idling engine, would reduce indices of airway inflammation. METHODS: The study comprised three exposures in all 10 healthy never smoking subjects; air, diluted <b>diesel</b> <b>exhaust,</b> and diluted <b>diesel</b> <b>exhaust</b> filtered with a ceramic particle trap. The exposures were given for 1 hour in randomised order about 3 weeks apart. The <b>diesel</b> <b>exhaust</b> exposure apperatus has previously been carefully developed and evaluated. Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed 24 hours after exposures and the lavage fluids from the bronchial and bronchoalveolar region were analysed for cells and soluble components. RESULTS: The particle trap reduced the mean steady state number of particles by 50 %, but the concentrations of the other measured compounds were almost unchanged. It was found that <b>diesel</b> <b>exhaust</b> caused an increase in neutrophils in airway lavage, together with an adverse influence on the phagocytosis by alveolar macrophages in vitro. Furthermore, the <b>diesel</b> <b>exhaust</b> was found to be able to induce a migration of alveolar macrophages into the airspaces, together with reduction in CD 3 +CD 25 + cells. (CD = cluster of differentiation) The use of the specific ceramic particle trap at the end of the tail pipe was not sufficient to completely abolish these effects when interacting with the exhaust from an idling vehicle. CONCLUSIONS: The current study showed that exposure to <b>diesel</b> <b>exhaust</b> may induce neutrophil and alveolar macrophage recruitment into the airways and suppress alveolar macrophage function.

We evaluated FENO as a measure of airway inflammation after controlled exposure to <b>diesel</b> <b>exhaust</b> or ozone. Methods: Healthy volunteers were exposed to either <b>diesel</b> <b>exhaust</b> (particle concentration 300 mu g/m(3)) and filtered air for one hour, or ozone (300 ppb) and filtered air for 75 minutes. FENO was measured in duplicate at expiratory flow rates of 10, 50, 100 and 270 mL/s before, 6 and 24 hours after each exposure. Results: Exposure to <b>diesel</b> <b>exhaust</b> increased FENO at 6 hours compared with air at expiratory flow rates of 10 mL/s (p = 0. 01) and at 50 mL/s (p = 0. 011), but FENO did not differ significantly at higher flow rates.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the impact of {{short-term}} exposure to diluted <b>diesel</b> <b>exhaust</b> on inflammatory parameters in human airways. We previously exposed control subjects for 1 hour to a high ambient concentration of <b>diesel</b> <b>exhaust</b> (particle concentration 300 pg/m 3 [...] a level comparable with that found in North Sea ferries, highway underpasses, etc). Although these exposures did not have any measurable effect on standard indices of lung function, there was a marked neutrophilic inflammatory response in the airways accompanied by increases in blood neutrophil and platelet counts. Endothelial adhesion molecules were upregulated, and the expression of interleukin 8 messenger RNA (IL- 8 mRNA*) was increased in a pattern consistent with neutrophilia. Individuals with asthma have inflamed airways and are clinically more sensitive to air pollutants than are control subjects. The present study was designed to assess whether this clinical sensitivity can be explained by acute neutrophilic inflammation or an increase in allergic airway inflammation resulting from <b>diesel</b> <b>exhaust</b> exposure. For this study, we used a lower concentration of <b>diesel</b> <b>exhaust</b> (100 microg/m 3 PM 10) for a 2 -hour exposure. At this concentration, both the control subjects and those with asthma demonstrated a modest but statistically significant increase in airway resistance following exposure to <b>diesel</b> <b>exhaust.</b> This increase in airway resistance was associated with an increased number of neutrophils in the bronchial wash (BW) fluid obtained from control subjects (median after <b>diesel</b> <b>exhaust</b> 22. 0 vs median after air 17. 2; P = 0. 015), as well as an increase in lymphocytes obtained through bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) (15. 0 % after <b>diesel</b> <b>exhaust</b> vs 12. 3 % after air; P = 0. 017). Upregulation of the endothelial adhesion molecule P-selectin was noted in bronchial biopsy tissues from control subjects (65. 4 % of vessels after <b>diesel</b> <b>exhaust</b> vs 52. 5 % after air). There was also a significant increase in IL- 8 protein concentrations in BAL fluid and IL- 8 mRNA gene expression in the bronchial biopsy tissues obtained from control subjects after <b>diesel</b> <b>exhaust</b> exposure (median IL- 8 expression 65. 7 % of adenine phosphoribosyl transferase [APRT] gene expression value after <b>diesel</b> <b>exhaust</b> vs 51. 0 % after air; P = 0. 007). There were no significant changes in total protein, albumin, or other soluble inflammatory markers in the BW or BAL fluids. Red and white blood cell counts in peripheral blood were unaffected by <b>diesel</b> <b>exhaust</b> exposure. Airway mucosal biopsy tissues from subjects with mild asthma (defined as forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV 1] greater than or equal to 70 % of the predicted value) showed eosinophilic airway inflammation after air exposure compared with the airways of the corresponding control subjects. However, among the subjects with mild asthma, <b>diesel</b> <b>exhaust</b> did not induce any significant change in airway neutrophils, eosinophils, or other inflammatory cells; cytokines; or mediators of inflammation. The only clear effect of <b>diesel</b> <b>exhaust</b> on the airways of subjects with asthma was a significant increase in IL- 10 staining in the biopsy tissues. This study demonstrated that modest concentrations of <b>diesel</b> <b>exhaust</b> have clear-cut inflammatory effects on the airways of nonasthmatic (or control) subjects. The data suggest a direct effect of <b>diesel</b> <b>exhaust</b> on IL- 8 production leading to upregulation of endothelial adhesion molecules and neutrophil recruitment. Despite clinical reports of increased susceptibility of patients with asthma to <b>diesel</b> <b>exhaust</b> and other forms of air pollution, it does not appear that this susceptibility is caused either directly by induction of neutrophilic inflammation or indirectly by worsening of preexisting asthmatic airway inflammation. The increased level of IL- 10 after <b>diesel</b> <b>exhaust</b> exposure in airways of subjects with asthma suggests that this pollutant may induce subtle changes in airway immunobiology. This is an important topic for further investigation. Other possible explanations for the apparent lack of response to <b>diesel</b> <b>exhaust</b> among subjects with asthma include (1) the time course of the response to diesel may differ from the response to allergens, which peaks 6 to 8 hours after exposure; (2) a different type of inflammation may occur that was not detectable by the standard methods used in this study; and (3) the increased sensitivity of patients with asthma to particulate air pollution may reflect the underlying bronchial hyperresponsiveness found in asthma rather than any specific increase in inflammatory responses...|$|R
40|$|The risk of {{lung cancer}} {{associated}} with <b>diesel</b> <b>exhaust</b> has been calculated from 14 case-control or cohort studies. We evaluated the findings from these studies {{to determine whether there}} is sufficient evidence to implicate <b>diesel</b> <b>exhaust</b> as a human lung carcinogen. Four studies found increased risks associated with long-term exposure, although two of the four studies were based on the same cohort of railroad workers. Six studies were inconclusive due to missing information on smoking habits, internal inconsistencies, or inadequate characterization of diesel exposure. Four studies found no statistically significant associations. It can be concluded that short-term exposure to <b>diesel</b> engine <b>exhaust</b> (20 years) increases the risk {{of lung cancer}} for locomotive engineers, brakemen, and diesel engine mechanics. There is inconsistent evidence on the effects of long-term exposure to <b>diesel</b> <b>exhaust</b> in the trucking industry. There is no evidence for a joint effect of <b>diesel</b> <b>exhaust</b> and cigarette smoking on lung cancer risk. Using common criteria for determining causal associations, the epidemiologic evidence is insufficient to establish <b>diesel</b> engine <b>exhaust</b> as a human lung carcinogen...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: <b>Diesel</b> <b>exhaust</b> is {{a common}} air {{pollutant}} made up of several gases, hydrocarbons, and particles. An experimental study {{was carried out which}} was designed to evaluate if a particle trap on the tail pipe of an idling diesel engine would reduce effects on symptoms and lung function caused by the <b>diesel</b> <b>exhaust,</b> compared with exposure to unfiltered exhaust. METHODS: Twelve healthy non-smoking volunteers (aged 20 - 37) were investigated in an exposure chamber for one hour during light work on a bicycle ergometer at 75 W. Each subject underwent three separate double blind exposures in a randomised sequence: to air and to <b>diesel</b> <b>exhaust</b> with the particle trap at the tail pipe and to unfiltered <b>diesel</b> <b>exhaust.</b> Symptoms were recorded according to the Borg scale before, every 10 minutes during, and 30 minutes after the exposure. Lung function was measured with a computerised whole body plethysmograph. RESULTS: The ceramic wall flow particle trap reduced the number of particles by 46 %, whereas other compounds were relatively constant. It was shown that the most prominent symptoms during exposure to <b>diesel</b> <b>exhaust</b> were irritation of the eyes and nose and an unpleasant smell increasing during exposure. Both airway resistance (R(aw)) and specific airway resistance (SR(aw)) increased significantly during the exposures to <b>diesel</b> <b>exhaust.</b> Despite the 46 % reduction in particle numbers by the trap effects on symptoms and lung function were not significantly attenuated. CONCLUSION: Exposure to <b>diesel</b> <b>exhaust</b> caused symptoms and bronchoconstriction which were not significantly reduced by a particle trap...|$|R
