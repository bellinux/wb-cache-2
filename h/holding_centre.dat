25|$|Shortly after Wright {{joined the}} organisation, {{he was caught}} in {{possession}} of illegal weapons and sentenced {{to five years in}} a wing of HMP Maze (Maze Prison) reserved for paramilitary youth offenders. Before his imprisonment Wright was taken to Castlereagh <b>Holding</b> <b>Centre,</b> a police interrogation centre with a notorious reputation for the brutality employed during grilling. According to Wright's sister Angela, he later claimed that he had been subjected to a number of indignities by the interrogating officers, including having a pencil shoved into his rectum. During his spell in prison Wright briefly joined the blanket protest, although he stepped down following an order from the UVF's Brigade Staff (Belfast leadership), who feared that prisoner participation in the protest was being interpreted as a show of solidarity with the Provisional IRA.|$|E
25|$|A {{total of}} 1118 {{people were arrested}} in {{relation}} to the G20 summit protests, the largest mass arrests in Canadian history, while nearly 800 of them were released without charge. The remaining 231 people remained with charges before the court while 58 of them have had their charges withdrawn or stayed. Smaller-scale, non-violent protests took place the following day, June 28, during the afternoon and evening. Nearly 1000 protesters marched to Toronto City Hall and Queen's Park to protest the treatment of arrested individuals at the Eastern Avenue <b>holding</b> <b>centre</b> and demanded the release of individuals still being detained, although police had earlier released several arrested on minor charges. Large numbers of Toronto Police Service officers continued to patrol the demonstrations. On June 29, a group of gay activists gathered outside a community centre where Toronto Police Service chief Bill Blair was scheduled to speak to demand his resignation for the treatment of women and homophobia within the detention centre.|$|E

5000|$|The {{first years}} at the Benalla Migrant Camp were the busiest, with a peak {{occupancy}} of 1063 migrants in 1951. The number of migrant arrivals decreased markedly when the displaced persons scheme drew {{to an end in}} 1952 and a number of <b>holding</b> <b>centres</b> closed.|$|R
40|$|Berried {{lobsters}} {{collected from}} landing <b>centres</b> and lobster <b>holding</b> <b>centres</b> {{were used for}} larval rearing of the spiny lobsters, Panulirus homarus (Linnaeus, 1758), Panulirus ornatus (Fabricius, 1798) and Panulirus versicolor (Latrielle, 1804). Fecundity of the lobsters used for larval rearing was calculated {{as the number of}} eggs deposited on the ovigerous setae on the pleopods. The number of eggs in a single brood ranged from 1, 20, 544 to 4, 49, 585 in P. homarus. 5, 18, 181 to P. ornatus 1, 979, 522 and that of P. versicolor as 1, 70, 212 to P. versicolor 7, 33, 752. The tropical lobsters are reported to and therefore breed two times or more in a year. The absolute (annual) fecundity of these lobsters is expected to be higher. The phyllosoma larvae released, as percentage of fecundity, was maximum in P. homarus 85. 7, 49. 7 in P. ornatus and 74. 0 in P. versicolor. Handling of lobsters at the landing and <b>holding</b> <b>centres</b> and aerial transport resulted in high percentage of eggs in arrested development, complete or partial shedding of eggs and release of weak phyllosoma larvae. Severe bacterial infection leading to complete shedding of eggs was recorded in a few breeders collected from <b>holding</b> <b>centres...</b>|$|R

2500|$|UFF {{leader and}} self-styled [...] "Captain Black" [...] John White {{confessed to the}} killings during a police {{interrogation}} for other offences at the Castlereagh <b>Holding</b> <b>Centre</b> in 1976. He was convicted of the murders in 1978 and given two life sentences. The trial judge described the killings as [...] "a frenzied attack, a psychotic outburtst". White maintained that the UFF's second-in-command (and later North Belfast UDA brigadier) Davy Payne, also known as [...] "The Psychopath", {{was part of the}} assassination squad and played {{a leading role in the}} killings. Historian Ian S. Wood confirmed Payne's central involvement in the double killing. Although Payne had been questioned by the RUC after the killings, he admitted nothing and never faced any charges. It was alleged that whenever Payne wished to frighten or intimidate others he would shout: [...] "Do you know who I am? I'm Davy Payne. They say I killed Paddy Wilson".|$|E
2500|$|In late 1829 Charles Sturt {{and his men}} {{passed along}} the Murrumbidgee River on horses and drays. They {{launched}} their whale-boat near the Murrumbidgee-Lachlan junction and continued the journey by boat to the Murray River and eventually to the sea at Lake Alexandrina (before returning by the same route). During the late-1830s stock was regularly overlanded to South Australia via the Lower Murrumbidgee. [...] At the same time stockholders were edging westward along and the Lachlan, Murrumbidgee, Billabong and Murray systems. [...] By 1839 all of the river frontages {{in the vicinity of}} present-day Hay were occupied by squatters. [...] By the mid-1850s pastoral runs in the western Riverina were well-established and prosperous. The nearby Victorian gold-rushes provided an expanding market for stock. The prime fattening country of the Riverina became a sort of <b>holding</b> <b>centre,</b> from where the Victorian market could be supplied as required.

2500|$|Individuals arrested {{during the}} protests {{who claimed to}} be s not taking part in protests {{condemned}} the treatment they received from police at the Eastern Avenue <b>holding</b> <b>centre.</b> According to testimonials given to the Toronto Star and La Presse by a few arrestees, including university students, journalists, street medics, teachers, tourists, photographers, and a former mayoral candidate, [...] " [...] rights were violated" [...] and [...] "police brutality [...]" [...] The detention centre was described as [...] "cold" [...] with [...] "barely any food or water" [...] and [...] "no place in the cages to even sit," [...] and [...] "tantamount to torture." [...] Other allegations included harassment, lack of medical care, verbal abuse, and strip searches of females by male officers. At one point, a plainclothes officer reportedly told a detainee that the federal government had declared martial law. Blair defended the conditions in the temporary detention centre, citing the fact that every room in the centre was under video surveillance, and that to the best of the officers' abilities, occupants were read their rights. However, a Toronto Star commentator editorialized that [...] "some of the elements of classic authoritarian detention were there, albeit in embryonic forms." ...|$|E
2500|$|In mid-February 2011, about 4,000 mostly Tunisian {{refugees}} {{landed on}} the Italian island of Lampedusa, causing the authorities to declare {{a state of emergency}} that would allow for federal aid to the island. Interior Minister Roberto Maroni accused the EU of not doing enough to curb immigration and asked them to do more. He said that the [...] "Tunisian system was 'collapsing'" [...] and that he would [...] "ask the Tunisian Foreign Ministry for permission for our authorities to intervene to stop the flow in Tunisia," [...] suggesting Italian troops would be on Tunisian soil. He called the event a [...] "biblical exodus." [...] The comments started a row between the two countries with the Tunisian Foreign Ministry saying it was ready to work with Italy and others but that it [...] "categorically rejects any interference in its internal affairs or any infringement of its sovereignty." [...] In response, Italy's Foreign Minister Franco Frattini said that both countries share a [...] "common interest" [...] to halt the immigration, while he also offered [...] "logistical help in terms of police and equipment. Until now the system of patrolling the coasts of Northern Africa has worked and we want to re-establish the technique, which had reduced illegal immigration to zero until a month ago." [...] Tunisia then said that it had troops patrolling southern fishing ports and that checkpoints had been erected in coastal towns. By 14 February, at least 2,000 refugees had been sent to Sicily with the other 2,000 quarantined at a re-opened <b>holding</b> <b>centre.</b> On 2 March about 350 more people arrived on the island.

In general though, Yungaba was used as transit depot for those British migrants who had their own accommodation arranged.
