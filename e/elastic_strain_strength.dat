The TTZN alloys have been designed using the electronic parameters of the alloying elements, combined with the approaches of the electron-to-atom ratio (e/a) and molybdenum equivalence (Mo eq). X-ray diffraction analysis has revealed that all the TTZN alloys are comprised of a single β phase, however, transmission electron microscopy observations revealed that ω and β phases co-existed in the microstructure. The compression strains of the TTZN alloys range from 22 % to 36 % and the compression strength from 1787 to 1807 MPa. The tensile Young&# 039;s modulus, <b>elastic</b> <b>strain</b> and yield <b>strength</b> are 73. 12 ± 4. 43, 74. 98 ± 2. 19 and 76. 62 ± 2. 38 (GPa); 1. 57 ± 0. 27, 1. 25 ± 0. 27 and 1. 29 ± 0. 16 (%); and 1107. 42 ± 144. 68, 932. 11 ± 195. 22 and 953. 58 ± 120. 76 MPa for TTZN- 1, TTZN- 2 and TTZN- 3, respectively.

Methods: A total of 90 patients with thyroid cancer who accepted surgical treatment in our hospital between March 2015 and September 2016 were selected as the observation group, and 50 patients who received surgery in our hospital during the same period and were with clear pathological diagnosis of thyroid adenoma were selected as the control group. According to the median of ultrasonic <b>elastic</b> <b>strain</b> ratio, the observing group were further divided into high <b>elastic</b> <b>strain</b> ratio group and low <b>elastic</b> <b>strain</b> ratio group (n= 45).

40|$|In {{this paper}} we explore methods of {{measuring}} <b>elastic</b> <b>strain</b> variations {{in the presence of}} larger lattice rotations (up to - 11 °) using high resolution electron backscatter diffraction. We have examined the fundamental equations which relate pattern shifts to the <b>elastic</b> <b>strain</b> tensor and modified them to a finite deformation framework from the original infinitesimal deformation one. We incorporate the traction free boundary condition into the minimisation problem for the finite deformation case (i. e. large rotations and small <b>elastic</b> <b>strains).</b> Numerical experiments show that this finite deformation kinematic analysis continues to work well, while the infinitesimal analysis fails, when the misorientation between test and reference pattern is made increasingly high. However, measurements on patterns simulated using dynamical diffraction theory indicated that this formulation is not sufficient to recover <b>elastic</b> <b>strains</b> accurately because the pattern shifts are not determined accurately when large rotations are present. To overcome this issue we remap the test pattern to an orientation that is close to that of reference pattern. This remapping was defined by a finite rotation matrix, which was estimated from the infinitesimal rotation matrix measured using cross-correlation. A second cross-correlation analysis between the reference pattern and the remapped test pattern allows the <b>elastic</b> <b>strains</b> to be recovered using the much simpler infinitesimal deformation theory. We have also demonstrated that accurate recovery of <b>elastic</b> <b>strains</b> requires accurate knowledge of the pattern centre if this remapping algorithm is used...|$|R

The squired <b>elastic</b> <b>strain</b> gradient is required for the free energy stability to arbitrary strain gradients. Obtained analytical expressions showed that the fundamental upper limit for the magnitude of the static bulk flexoelectric effect strength, established by Yudin and Tagantsev under the absence of squired <b>elastic</b> <b>strain</b> gradient and higher order gradients terms, should be substituted by the temperature-dependent condition on the flexoelectric coupling strength under the presence of the gradient terms. Moreover, we established that the SMP appears and becomes stable in commensurate ferroics if the flexocoupling constant exceeds the critical value, defined by the reduced temperature, strain and order parameter gradients constants, striction and expansion coefficients in the LGD functional. We calculated the soft phonon dispersion in ferroics with commensurate and incommensurate long-range ordered phases allowing for the squired <b>elastic</b> <b>strain</b> gradient, as well as static and dynamic flexocoupling. Appeared that the dispersion for the optic mode is slightly sensitive to the flexocoupling, while the dispersion of acoustic mode strongly depends on the coupling strength.
