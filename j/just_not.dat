5|$|The Dreamcast {{version of}} the game was praised for its visuals, gameplay, and {{translation}} of the original arcade experience. Due to the PlayStation's limited RAM capacity, Capcom removed tag team battles {{in an attempt to}} preserve the game's speed and graphical integrity.

5|$|According to Jainism, {{the purpose}} of nonviolence is {{not because it is}} a commandment of a God or any other supreme being. Its purpose is also not simply because its {{observance}} is conducive to general welfare of the state or the community. While it is true that in Jainism, the moral and religious injunctions were laid down as law by Arhats who have achieved perfection through their supreme moral efforts, their adherence is <b>just</b> <b>not</b> to please a God, but the life of the Arhats has demonstrated that such commandments were conductive to Arhat's own welfare, helping him to reach spiritual victory. Just as Arhats achieved spiritual victory by observing non-violence, so can anyone who follows this path.|$|E
50|$|The typical {{interpretation}} of Neti-Neti is not this, not this or neither this, nor that. It is a phrase meant {{to convey the}} inexpressibility of Brahman in words and the futility of trying to approximate Brahman with conceptual models.In VisishtAdvaita, the phrase is taken {{in the sense of}} <b>not</b> <b>just</b> this, <b>not</b> <b>just</b> this or <b>not</b> <b>just</b> this, <b>not</b> <b>just</b> that. This means that Brahman cannot be restricted to one specific or a few specific descriptions. Consequently, Brahman is understood to possess infinite qualities and each of these qualities are infinite in extent.|$|R
40|$|Extract:Serial crime {{refers to}} any series {{of two or}} more related crimes (Petherick, 2005, pp. 143 - 149). Despite the limits set upon us by {{traditional}} nomothetic reasoning, this does not necessarily mean two or more related crimes of the same type (i. e., rape, homicide, burglary, stalking, etc.). Unfortunately, many investigators and researchers are stuck in a nomothetic mode [...] a function of how crime has been studied (chunked into similar groups), as opposed to how criminals actually behave and how crime must consequently be investigated. From a practical standpoint, it is not the type of crime that defines the existence of a series, but the inference that the same offender is committing them. Nomothetic research and study have worked very hard to blind us to the reality that many offenders are <b>not</b> <b>just</b> rapists, <b>not</b> <b>just</b> murderers, <b>not</b> <b>just</b> arsonists, <b>not</b> <b>just</b> stalkers, <b>not</b> <b>just</b> burglars, or <b>not</b> <b>just</b> bank robbers. In fact, many serial offenders (a. k. a. serialists) commit crimes of multiple types {{in the course of a}} criminal season or career. Keeping this criminal versatility in mind is one of the steps that can lead to offenders’ identification and apprehension...|$|R

5|$|Because R. norvegicus {{and related}} species {{are seen as}} pests, their {{intentional}} import into foreign countries is often regulated. For example, the importation of foreign rodents is prohibited in Australia, and so various coat types, colors, and varieties have been bred separately from foreign lines, or are <b>just</b> <b>not</b> obtainable within that country (for example, hairless and dumbo-eared fancy rats do not exist in Australia). In other areas, like the Canadian province of Alberta, which is considered rat-free, the ownership of domestic fancy rats outside of schools, laboratories, and zoos is illegal.|$|E

The Doctor informs Skaldak he was encased in the ice for 5000 years. Skaldak laments the loss of his daughter and his people; however, the Doctor tries to comfort him with the knowledge that the Ice Warriors still live, <b>just</b> <b>not</b> on Earth or Mars. Skaldak escapes from his armour - an act of great dishonour - and stops broadcasting the signal to the other Ice Warriors because he believes himself to be the only one of his kind left. The Doctor surmises that, thinking himself to be the last of his kind, Skaldak has nothing left to lose. He manages to grab and kill three members of the crew.|$|E

Deep Throat felt that the truth the Syndicate kept secret from the public needed to be known, and believed Mulder to be the one person capable of exposing this knowledge. However, during the disappearance of Max Fenig, Deep Throat provided Mulder with false information in order to divert him, later explaining that he believed the public was <b>just</b> <b>not</b> ready to know some truths.|$|E

In 2007, Johansson took part in social advocacy {{as part of the}} anti-poverty campaign ONE, which was organized by U2 lead singer Bono. In March 2008, a UK-based bidder paid £20,000 on an eBay auction to benefit Oxfam, winning a hair and makeup treatment, a pair of tickets, and a chauffeured trip to accompany Johansson on a 20-minute date to the world premiere of He's <b>Just</b> <b>Not</b> That Into You.|$|E

A minor knee injury sustained during the mid-season training camp meant he missed a couple of matches, and thereafter his appearances in the starting eleven were intermittent, whether through suspension or <b>just</b> <b>not</b> being selected. Groningen finished in seventh place, albeit 19 points behind Twente whom they faced in the play-offs. Kieftenbeld put in a strong performance in the first leg in a 1–0 defeat at home, but a 3–2 loss in the second leg confirmed that Groningen would not qualify for the Europa League.|$|E
5|$|Wanting {{to escape}} the Western themes that {{influenced}} Dr. Slump, Toriyama used Oriental scenery in Dragon Ball, referencing Chinese buildings and scenery. The island where the Tenkaichi Budōkai is held is modeled on Bali, which he visited in 1985. The area around Bobbidi's spaceship was inspired by photos of Africa. When including fights in the manga, Toriyama had the characters go to uninhabited locations to avoid the difficulties of drawing residents and destroyed buildings. The author said that Muscle Tower in the Red Ribbon Army storyline {{was inspired by the}} video game Spartan X, in which enemies appear very fast, and that the fights were similar to the ones in the Tenkaichi Budōkai, <b>just</b> <b>not</b> in a tournament setting.|$|E
5|$|Cooper's {{supporting}} part in {{the commercially}} successful comedy Wedding Crashers (2005) improved his career prospects, but also led to him being typecast as the best friend to the main character in such comedies as Failure to Launch (2006), The Rocker (2008), and He's <b>Just</b> <b>Not</b> That Into You (2009). During this period, Cooper also continued starring in television shows, such as the 2005 sitcom Kitchen Confidential, and played a dual role in a 2006 onstage production of Three Days of Rain. However, the former was cancelled after four episodes due to low ratings. His breakthrough came {{with the role of}} a reckless teacher in Todd Phillips' comedy The Hangover (2009), which became one of the highest grossing R-rated films of all time. Cooper continued to take on parts in several box office hits, including The A-Team (2010), Limitless, and The Hangover Part II (both in 2011).|$|E

5|$|It's not literal {{about the}} drug for me, I've never taken lithium before. It's sort of a metaphor about {{numbness}} and happiness... it's me looking at happiness {{in a negative way}} because I've always been... kind of afraid to be happy. Like with the band and the art and everything else, it's always like I'm never letting myself break through into the happiness it seems like, because it's not cool or something. And describing happiness is lithium, it's like saying 'that's numbness, I won't be able to be an artist anymore if I'm happy', which is hilarious because that's <b>just</b> <b>not</b> true, I'm happy. So it's... this fight within the song of... 'do I do this and get out of here and get happy or do I wallow in it like I always do?' and it's cool because {{at the end of the}} song I say 'I'm going to let it go', like I am going to be happy.|$|E

Between the two of us we came up with just this kind of groove, which stays on the same note as opposed to change, it's quite technical but it kind of added a bit of bounce to the song and it made it roll along in a much more fluid way. It was a bit mechanical before and it's just interesting how something small like that can really change the whole vibe of a song. It was just nice because from there on it was one of our favourite tracks and it almost didn't get on the record but it's now one of our favourite tracks.|$|E
