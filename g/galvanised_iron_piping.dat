40|$|Highly stable {{selective}} coatings of {{cobalt oxide}} {{have been prepared}} on commercial aluminium and <b>galvanised</b> <b>iron</b> substrates by the method of spray pyrolysis. The optothermal, structural and optical properties of these films have been investigated to determine the optimum growth parameters. Best selectivity values are obtained for films with thicknesses ~ 0 Â· 30 [mu]m on aluminium and ~ 0 Â· 32 [mu]m on <b>galvanised</b> <b>iron.</b> The optimised films on aluminium give [alpha] = 0 Â· 88 and [epsilon] 100 Â°C = 0 Â· 15 whereas those on <b>galvanised</b> <b>iron</b> give [alpha] = 0 Â· 88 and [epsilon] 100 Â°C = 0 Â· 13. The films are extremely adherent and are stable up to 500 Â°C {{in the case of}} aluminium and 350 Â°C in the case of <b>galvanised</b> <b>iron</b> substrates. ...|$|R
