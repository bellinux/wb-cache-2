Unlike uranium-235, it is non-fissile, which means it cannot sustain a chain reaction. However, it is fissionable by fast neutrons, and is fertile, meaning it can be transmuted to fissile plutonium-239. 238U cannot support a chain reaction because inelastic scattering reduces neutron energy below the range where fast fission of one or more next-generation nuclei is probable.

TRIGA used uranium zirconium hydride (UZrH) fuel, {{which has a}} large, prompt negative <b>fuel</b> <b>temperature</b> coefficient of reactivity.

Due to its safety and reliability, which allows it to be installed in densely populated areas, and its ability to still generate high energy for brief periods, which is particularly useful for research, it became the world's most popular research reactor, and General Atomics sold 66 TRIGAs in 24 countries. The high-temperature gas-cooled reactor (HTGR) was less successful, and only two HTGR power reactors were built, both in the United States. A 40 MW demonstration unit at the Peach Bottom Nuclear Generating Station [...] in Pennsylvania operated successfully, but a larger 300 MW unit at the Fort St. Vrain Generating Station in Colorado encountered technical problems. General Atomics also conducted research into thermonuclear energy, including means of magnetically confining plasma. Between 1962 and 1974 Creutz published six papers on the subject.|$|E

40|$|This report {{documents}} {{an effort}} to quantify {{the uncertainty of the}} calculated temperature data for the first Advanced Gas Reactor (AGR- 1) fuel irradiation experiment conducted in the INL’s Advanced Test Reactor (ATR) in support of the Next Generation Nuclear Plant (NGNP) R&D program. Recognizing uncertainties inherent in physics and thermal simulations of the AGR- 1 test, the results of the numerical simulations can be used in combination with the statistical analysis methods to improve qualification of measured data. Additionally, the temperature simulation data for AGR tests can be used for validation of the fuel transport and fuel performance simulation models. The crucial roles of the calculated <b>fuel</b> <b>temperatures</b> in ensuring achievement of the AGR experimental program objectives require accurate determination of the model temperature uncertainties. The report is organized into three chapters. Chapter 1 introduces the AGR Fuel Development and Qualification program and provides overviews of AGR- 1 measured data, AGR- 1 test configuration and test procedure, and thermal simulation. Chapters 2 describes the uncertainty quantification procedure for temperature simulation data of the AGR- 1 experiment, namely, (i) identify and quantify uncertainty sources; (ii) perform sensitivity analysis for several thermal test conditions; (iii) use uncertainty propagation to quantify overall response temperature uncertainty. A set of issues associated with modeling uncertainties resulting from the expert assessments are identified. This also includes the experimental design to estimate the main effects and interactions of the important thermal model parameters. Chapter 3 presents the overall uncertainty results for the six AGR- 1 capsules. This includes uncertainties for the daily volume-average and peak <b>fuel</b> <b>temperatures,</b> daily average temperatures at TC locations, and time-average volume-average and time-average peak <b>fuel</b> <b>temperatures...</b>|$|R

FRAPTRAN is mainly used for transient analysis and it calculates parameters including <b>fuel</b> and cladding <b>temperatures,</b> cladding strain, rod gap pressures and energy stored in the fuel. FRAPCON is used mainly to study steady state long term behavior of fuels. It gives valuable information related to fission gas release and fuel creep.

To model performance of this composite, these material properties were modified for UO 2 -BeO based on data available and techniques used in literature along with few assumptions, due to limited availability of data. Modified codes were used to study behavior of the composite. Results reveal that significant reductions in <b>fuel</b> centerline <b>temperatures,</b> cladding strain, rod gas pressures and fission gas release are obtained for the composite fuel.
