The first experimental factor were 3 -grass-legumes mixtures having the following composition: M 1 – Festulolium braunii 50 %, Trifolium pretense L. 50 %, M 2 – Festulolium braunii 50 %, Medicago sativa ssp. media 50 %, M 3 – Festulolium braunii 50 %, Trifolium pratense L. 25 %, Medicago sativa ssp. media 25 %. Combinations with soil’s medium amendment was marked as UG, and without soil’s medium amendment – BUG. In addition, nitrogen fertilization in the annual dose of 60 kg N∙ha- 1, potassium 120 kg K 2 O∙ha- 1 and phosphorus {{in the amount of}} 80 kg P 2 O 5 ∙ha- 1 were applied on all plots. Detailed study included the chemical composition of plant, which was determined at the Institute of Technology and Life Sciences in Falenty.

The {{influence}} of nitrogen fertilization and harvesting practices on biomass production, chemical composition and nutritional value were studied on Andropogon gayanus Kunth forages set in Sudanese agroclimatic zone of Burkina Faso. The first year was spent {{to establish an}} adequate plant population, by transplantation of Andropogon gayanus stumps; then, four nitrogen doses were applied on experimental blocs during the second year: a) 0 N-units/ha (0 kilos of urea/ha) as Control, b) 18. 5 N-units/ha (40 kilos of urea/ha), c) 37 N-units/ha (80 kilos of urea/ha) and d) 76 N-units/ha (150 kilos of urea/ha). Also, three harvesting intervals were applied as follows: harvesting i) every 30 days, ii) 40 days and iii) once at ear emergence. Each factor combination was repeated 4 times. Results indicated that treatment 67 N-u/ha combined with harvesting once at ear emergence led to the higher total dry matter (DM) production (7. 6 tons DM/ha), while harvesting every 30 days showed the best expression of nitrogen fertilization effects.

40|$|Agriculture is {{a period}} of {{specialization}} and commercialization. This is also happening to milk production. Until now most of the production has been carried out on family farms. Many farmers realize that it may be difficult for them to compete in the future with larger scale dairy farms. Furthermore, many farmers who take care of the cows themselves want to be released from this work. These and other factors have led to the idea of dairy cow pools. This is an arrangement where several owners of dairy cows enter into a contract with the management of a central housing, <b>feeding,</b> and <b>milking</b> <b>unit</b> designed to handle large numbers of cows.

40|$|In {{the sandy}} regions of The Netherlands, high losses of N from {{intensified}} dairy farms are threatening the environment. Therefore, government defined decreasing maximum levy-free N surplusses {{for the period}} 1998 – 2008. On most dairy farms, the current N surplus has to be reduced by half at least. Farmers fear that realizing these surplusses will be expensive, because it limits application of animal manure, which then has to be exported or additional land has to be bought. Moreover, farmers {{are worried about the}} impact on soil fertility. To explore the possibilities for reducing surplusses of average intensive farms by improved nutrient management, farming systems research is carried out at prototype farm De Marke. Results are compared with results of a commercial farm in the mid- 1980 s, the moment that systems research started and introduction of the milk quota system put a halt to further intensification. Results indicate that average intensive farms can realise a reduction in N surplus to a level below the defined final maximum, without the need to buy land or to export slurry. Inputs of N in purchased feeds and fertilisers decreased by 56 and 78 %, respectively. Important factors are reduced <b>feed</b> intake per <b>unit</b> <b>milk,</b> {{as a result of a}} higher milk yield per cow, less young stock and judicious feeding, an improved utilization of home-made manure and a considered balance between the grassland and maize area.

40|$|Various {{studies have}} {{indicated}} a relationship between enteric methane (CH 4) production and milk fatty acid (FA) profiles of dairy cattle. However, the number of studies investigating such a relationship is limited and the direct relationships reported are mainly obtained by variation in CH 4 production and milk FA concentration induced by dietary lipid supplements. The {{aim of this study}} was to perform a meta-analysis to quantify relationships between CH 4 yield (per <b>unit</b> of <b>feed</b> and <b>unit</b> of <b>milk)</b> and milk FA profile in dairy cattle and to develop equations to predict CH 4 yield based on milk FA profile of cows fed a wide variety of diets. Data from 8 experiments encompassing 30 different dietary treatments and 146 observations were included. Yield of CH 4 measured in these experiments was 21. 5 ± 2. 46 g/kg of dry matter intake (DMI) and 13. 9 ± 2. 30 g/ kg of fat- and protein-corrected milk (FPCM). Correlation coefficients were chosen as effect size of the relationship between CH 4 yield and individual milk FA concentration (g/ 100 g of FA). Average true correlation coefficients were estimated by a random-effects model. Milk FA concentrations of C 6 : 0, C 8 : 0, C 10 : 0, C 16 : 0, and C 16 : 0 -iso were significantly or tended to be positively related to CH 4 yield per <b>unit</b> of <b>feed.</b> Concentrations of trans- 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 C 18 : 1, trans- 10 + 11 C 18 : 1, cis- 11 C 18 : 1, cis- 12 C 18 : 1, cis- 13 C 18 : 1, trans- 16 +cis- 14 C 18 : 1, and cis- 9, 12 C 18 : 2 in milk fat were significantly or tended to be negatively related to CH 4 yield per <b>unit</b> of <b>feed.</b> <b>Milk</b> FA concentrations of C 10 : 0, C 12 : 0, C 14 : 0 -iso, C 14 : 0, cis- 9 C 14 : 1, C 15 : 0, and C 16 : 0 were significantly or tended to be positively related to CH 4 yield per <b>unit</b> of <b>milk.</b> Concentrations of C 4 : 0, C 18 : 0, trans- 10 + 11 C 18 : 1, cis- 9 C 18 : 1, cis- 11 C 18 : 1, and cis- 9, 12 C 18 : 2 in milk fat were significantly or tended to be negatively related to CH 4 yield per <b>unit</b> of <b>milk.</b> Mixed model multiple regression and a stepwise selection procedure of milk FA based on the Bayesian information criterion to predict CH 4 yield with milk FA as input (g/ 100 g of FA) resulted in the following prediction equations: CH 4 (g/kg of DMI) = 23. 39 + 9. 74 × C 16 : 0 - iso – 1. 06 × trans- 10 + 11 C 18 : 1 – 1. 75 × cis- 9, 12 C 18 : 2 (R 2 = 0. 54), and CH 4 (g/kg of FPCM) = 21. 13 – 1. 38 × C 4 : 0 + 8. 53 × C 16 : 0 -iso – 0. 22 × cis- 9 C 18 : 1 – 0. 59 × trans- 10 + 11 C 18 : 1 (R 2 = 0. 47).
