5|$|The Nintendo DS's two screens {{act as one}} tall screen; however, in practice, this {{essentially}} <b>just</b> <b>gives</b> {{the player}} {{a better view of}} the surroundings and, save for one boss battle, (Hector the Reflector, where the bottom screen acts as a mirror through which to see Hector during the battle) only provides the benefit of being able to see more (above) and, when the player is on the top screen, below. The game does not make use of the bottom screen's touch sensitivity for basic gameplay, though it is an option for selecting levels and in some mini-games. Each of DSs five worlds has two bosses, each with a weakness that must be identified and exploited. Most of the time, these are simply giant-sized versions of normal enemies, though some are more inventive.|$|E
500|$|In June 2014, Clark Gregg stated he {{believed}} the season would be shown in a block of 10 episodes, then breaking for Agent Carter, before airing the remaining 12. Explaining this decision, Bell said, One of our challenges last year was to produce 22 episodes that aired over, what, 40 weeks? 36 weeks? Something like that. And the age of re-runs is dead. Re-runs are death, and so you're trying to commit to the habit of the show and [...] tune in to something else or a re-run and they'll get pissed off. They'll go away. What this allows us to do is minimize repeats. We're showing ten episodes, and {{there has to be}} a gap or two because it's physically impossible to produce ten shows and get through post production in time, we can't do that so there's going to be a Marvel special at some point. But pretty much every week you're showing up and we're there, and then instead of a repeat showing up mid-run and losing momentum, Agent Carter comes in and has its own cool stuff, and they're running eight weeks in a row, then we can come back and run twelve in a row with no interruptions. We're still producing our show every week but it <b>just</b> <b>gives</b> us time, barely, to finish 22 on schedule. It takes out the need for repeats in the back half.|$|E
500|$|The UK's Daily Telegraph {{also gave}} the film a {{positive}} review, remarking, [...] "For {{the most part}} the action romps along, spurred by some impressive special effects," [...] adding, [...] "It's just slightly disappointing that, with the momentum having been established so effectively, we now have to wait until next year to enjoy the rest of the ride." [...] Roger Ebert awarded the first part three out of four stars, praising the cast and calling it [...] "a handsome and sometimes harrowing film [...] [...] [...] completely unintelligible for anyone coming to the series for the first time". Scott Bowles of USA Today called it, [...] "Menacing and meditative, Hallows is arguably the best instalment of the planned eight-film franchise, though audiences who haven't kept up with previous chapters will be hopelessly lost", while Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly likewise praised the film as [...] "the most cinematically rewarding chapter yet." [...] In a review for the Orlando Sentinel, Roger Moore proclaimed Part I as [...] "Alternately funny and touching, it's the best film in the series, an Empire Strikes Back for these wizards and their wizarding world. And those effects? They're so special you don't notice them." [...] Ramin Setoodeh of Newsweek gave a negative review, writing, [...] "They've taken one of the most enchanting series in contemporary fiction and sucked out all the magic [...] [...] [...] while Rowling's stories are endlessly inventive, Potter onscreen <b>just</b> <b>gives</b> you a headache." [...] Lou Lumenick of the New York Post found the film to be [...] "Beautifully shot but a soulless cash machine... delivers no dramatic payoff, no resolution and not much fun." ...|$|E

Mickelson said: [...] "I've never felt more excited going into The Open. I don't think there's {{a better way to}} get ready for a major than playing well the week before and getting into contention.

2500|$|The {{physiological}} blood-flow response largely decides {{the temporal}} sensitivity, {{that is how}} accurately we can measure when neurons are active, in BOLD fMRI. The basic time resolution parameter (sampling time) is designated TR; the TR dictates how often a particular brain slice is excited and allowed to lose its magnetization. [...] TRs could vary from the very short (500ms) to the very long (3s). For fMRI specifically, the hemodynamic response lasts over 10 seconds, rising multiplicatively (that is, {{as a proportion of}} current value), peaking at 4 to 6 seconds, and then falling multiplicatively. Changes in the blood-flow system, the vascular system, integrate responses to neuronal activity over time. Because this response is a smooth continuous function, sampling with ever-faster TRs does not help; it <b>just</b> <b>gives</b> more points on the response curve obtainable by simple linear interpolation anyway. Experimental paradigms such as staggering when a stimulus is presented at various trials can improve temporal resolution, but reduces the number of effective data points obtained.|$|E
2500|$|Director Masaru Konuma {{calls his}} own early S/M films [...] "European-type S/M," [...] and says, [...] "Later S/M {{developed}} in a very Japanese fashion. The Oniroku Dan way." [...] Konuma says that Dan described three purposes of S/M: [...] "for punishment, for confinement and {{for a sense of}} shame," [...] and that [...] "Oniroku Dan dislikes S as punishment... his novels and screenplays are centered around the 'humiliation' concept." [...] Dan confirmed Konuma's view by observing, [...] "My book editors often confuse S/M with cruelty and they want me to write some 'punishment tale' for them. This type of story is out of my realm. It <b>just</b> <b>gives</b> me the creeps. Rather, my concept of S/M is 'distorted sexual desire' or extreme disorientation. It's a male fantasy derived from love... from seeing a beauty suffer through the sense of shame. Therefore, my style contains a romantic, aesthetic, and sometimes decadent fragrance." [...] Konuma says of Dan's female characters, [...] "In his novels, he's searching for the beauty of women. He creates an ideal woman and proceeds to sell an S/M 'fantasy' to his readers." [...] According to Naomi Tani, Dan's perfect film actress must [...] "look good in a kimono; she needs to have long jet-black hair; she must have a certain amount of body fat, so that the bondage rope makes a clear impression on her skin; and she has to be graceful under torture, with strong facial expressions." ...|$|E

2500|$|Throughout the Mario RPG series, Toad is {{featured}} {{as more of}} a minor character due to the large amounts of generic toads which appear in the games who seem to replace his role as a helper. Regardless, in the times he does appear, Toad is once again a minor character who <b>just</b> <b>gives</b> a backstory to Mario and the others. In Super Mario RPG, Toad appears as a major NPC character who teaches Mario about the different skills to use in battles in the beginning as the duo heads to the Mushroom Kingdom (though Toad had to be saved by Mario along the way as he is kidnapped frequently by enemies). Toad appears more throughout the game, for example as part of Mario's nightmare. Toad appears as a playable character in [...] for a short time when the player is exploring around Mario and Luigi's house. In Super Princess Peach, Toad is kidnapped earlier in the game along with Mario and Luigi by the Hammer Bros.. However, Toad appears as a playable character in two of the minigames in the game. Paper Toad appears in Super Paper Mario in 3 aspects of the game. He appears in the intro, telling Paper Mario and Paper Luigi that Paper Princess Peach has been kidnapped, and later appears in the Arcade mini-game Mansion Patrol. Additionally, Toad is one of the 256 Catch Cards in the game. In , a mysterious infection called [...] "The Blorbs" [...] causes the Toads to inflate to many times their normal size and roll around uncontrollably.|$|E
