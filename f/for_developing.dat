This is done by carrying out a set of unit-root tests on the real interest differentials with respect to Germany and the US. Our results support the hypothesis of a rapid reversion towards a zero differential <b>for</b> <b>developed</b> countries and towards a positive one for emerging markets. An important result is that this adjustment tends to be highly asymmetric and markedly different <b>for</b> <b>developed</b> and emerging countries. Our evidence reveals a high degree of market integration <b>for</b> <b>developed</b> countries and highlights the importance of risk premia for emerging markets...|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to the air and naval forces assigned to protect shipping in Australian waters, fixed defences were constructed to protect the major Australian ports. The Australian Army was responsible <b>for</b> <b>developing</b> and manning coastal defences to protect ports from attacks by enemy surface raiders. These defences commonly consisted {{of a number of}} fixed guns defended by anti-aircraft guns and infantry. The Army's coastal defences were considerably expanded as the threat to Australia increased between 1940 and 1942, and reached their peak strength in 1944. The Royal Australian Navy was responsible <b>for</b> <b>developing</b> and manning harbour defences in Australia's main ports. These defences consisted of fixed anti-submarine booms and mines supported by small patrol craft, and were also greatly expanded as the threat to Australia increased. The RAN also laid defensive minefields in Australian waters from August 1941.|$|E

Crop diversity can protect againstcrop failure, and can also offer higher returns.|$|E
