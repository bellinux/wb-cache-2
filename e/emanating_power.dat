40|$|To better {{understand}} the mechanisms leading to different radon background levels in volcanic settings, we have performed two long-term deformation experiments of 16 days using a real-time setup that enables us to monitor any variation of radon activity concentration during rock compression. Our measurements demonstrate that, {{in the case of}} highly porous volcanic rocks, the <b>emanating</b> <b>power</b> of the substrate changes {{as a function of the}} volcanic stress conditions. Constant magmatic pressures, such as those observed during dike intrusions and hydrothermal fluid injections, can result in pervasive pore collapse that is mirrored by a significant radon decrease until a constant emanation is achieved. Conversely, repeated cycles of stress due to, for example, volcano inflation/deflation cycles, cause a progressive radon increase a few days (but even weeks and months) before rupture. After rock failure, however, the formation of new emanation surfaces leads to a substantial increase of the radon signal. Our results suggest that surface deformation in tectonic and volcanic settings, such as inflation/ deflation or constant magmatic pressures, have important repercussions on the <b>emanating</b> <b>power</b> of volcanic substrates...|$|E

The most conspicuous Rn- 222 feature found in the data analysis is a region that includes Aristarchus Crater. The excess <b>emanating</b> <b>power</b> of the Aristarchus region may be an indication of internal activity at that site.

40|$|In {{a series}} of 18 {{concrete}} samples, the influence of several parameters related to composition and production processes on the radon exhalation rate was studied. The investigated parameters were: amount and type of cement, water-cement ratio, curing conditions and curing time, type of aggregates, compressive strength, and water evaporation rate during conditioning. Strong positive correlations with the calculated radon <b>emanating</b> <b>power</b> were found for the evaporation rate and the water-cement ratio. A negative correlation was found for the compressive strength. The results are discussed {{with respect to the}} capillary pore volume and pore size of the concrete samples...|$|E

40|$|The surface {{areas of}} several thorium oxide and thorium oxide [...] uranium oxide {{preparations}} were {{measured by the}} emanation method. The radioactive gas- counting system employed is described, and {{a discussion of the}} procedure for converting counting data to terms of <b>emanating</b> <b>power</b> and finally to surface area values is given. Surface area values by the emanation method were compared with BET values from like samples. The difference between values obtained by the two methods was attributed to the efficiency of the radioactive gas-detecting system and the porosity of the oxide samples. The contribution of Rn/sup 2 //sup 2 //sup 2 / from the oxide samples containing uranium was found to be negligible and presented no problem. Samples fired at temperatures above 1500 %DEC for one hour in air exhibited a marked increase in "room temperature" emanation rates. The predicted lattice-loosening temperature of metal oxides is approximately one-half their absolute melting point. Above this temperature, sufficient thermal agitation is induced to permit exchange and possibly permanent displacement of atoms in the crystal lattice. Therefore, firing these oxide preparations at temperatures above 1500 deg C would probably result in lattice defects throughout the crystal structure, with the surface defects contributing to an increase in surface area and a corresponding increase in the emanation rate.

40|$|The {{emanation}} of thoron (Rn/sup 220 /) from sintered UO/sub 2 / powders {{and plates}} was measured {{as a function}} of temperature. The uranium oxide samples were indexed with radiothorium by coprecipitation and coevaporation techniques. The emanation measurements were performed in a flow system, using an alpha scintillation detector and a helium-hydrogen carrier gas mixture. Both the radiothorium concentration (5 to 100 mu C/g UO/sub 2 /) and the uranium oxide density (71 to 99 percent TD) were varied. The surface areas and densities of the UO/sub 2 / plates were measured by krypton gas adsorption and liquid immersion techniques, respectively. Assuming a diffusion mechanism, diffusion coefficients for thoron in sintered UO/sub 2 / were calculated {{as a function of}} temperature. The data were represented by an equation of the form, D = D/sub O/ exp (-Q/RT). An apparent increase in both activation energy (Q) and D/sub O/ with density was observed for the 1100 to 1450 deg C temperature range. For some samples the thoron <b>emanating</b> <b>power</b> could be measured at temperatures as low as 400 deg C. Log D versus 1 /T plots from 400 to 1450 deg C gave intersecttng straight lines with different activation energies. One intersection occurred near the Tammann temperature. The emanation of Rn/sup 220 / from UO/sub 2 / apparently involves several types of diffusion processes. (auth...|$|E

40|$|Rose Slivka {{tells us}} in her essay, The Persistent Object, that the {{craftsman}} {{is a man}} of eminence, making objects to <b>emanate</b> <b>power</b> and magic (from its original Saxon form kraft, meaning power and strength) and invested all tools of utility with this presence. All objects were symbols of power no less than utility. As an act of making, craft embodies a regenerative reality. Craft was more than it is, an integral ingredient of the human condition. It carries a reminder of being human. The act of making, of interacting with tools and materials is {{what it feels like to}} be human. Anything less is merely an illusion or a cerebral misunderstanding. The physical engagement in a creative process is a human phenomenon and by virtue of our relation to this biosphere we all deserve the privilege of being included in the event. Craft is fundamentally encoded in our DNA. If the gene for active creativity has somehow been repressed or misplaced, these words are a reminder that acknowledging the fact will more than likely suspend any atrophy. The craftsman knows how to access, invest and reveal the power mentioned by Rose Slivka, but in the context of today amongst the congestion of excess, variety, and the perpetual discount, the crafted artifact is rarely sought nor its power recognized.
