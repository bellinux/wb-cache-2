Although the Philippine claim to Sabah has not been actively pursued for some years, some Filipino politicians are promising to bring it up again, [...] while the Malaysian government asks the Philippines not to threaten ties over such issue. The Royal Malaysia Police and the Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister made a proposal to ban barter trade between Malaysia and the Philippines as it was seen only benefited to one side and threatening the security of the state. This was enforced then although facing numerous opposition from Filipino resident on the nearest Philippine islands due to the raise of the living cost in their region after the ban as well from the Malaysian opposition parties, while receiving positive welcomes by Sabahans residents and politicians. [...] The barter trade activity was resumed on 1 February 2017 with the increase of security surveillance and enforcement from both Malaysia and the Philippines authorities to jointly secure their borders. Despite the return of barter trade activity, the state of Sabah has maintained they will always be cautious on their trade with the Philippines. In 2016, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte and Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak have agreed to set aside the two countries’ dispute over Sabah <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>meantime.</b>|$|E
