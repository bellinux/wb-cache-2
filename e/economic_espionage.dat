Computer Investigations and Infrastructure Threat Assessment Center (CITAC) and the National Infrastructure Protection Center (NIPC) were created to deal with the increase in Internet-related problems, such as computer viruses, worms, and other malicious programs that threatened US operations. With these developments, the FBI increased its electronic surveillance in public safety and national security investigations, adapting to the telecommunications advancements that changed the nature of such problems.|$|E

In July 2015, WikiLeaks published documents which showed that the NSA had tapped the telephones of many German federal ministries, including that of the Chancellor Angela Merkel, for years since the 1990s. On 4 July 2015, WikiLeaks published documents which showed that 29 Brazilian government numbers were selected for secret espionage by the NSA. Among the targets there were also the President Dilma Rousseff, many assistants and advisors, her presidential jet and other key figures in the Brazilian government.|$|E
2500|$|Trade secret {{misappropriation}} {{is different}} from violations of other intellectual property laws, since by definition trade secrets are secret, while patents and registered copyrights and trademarks are publicly available. In the United States, trade secrets are protected under state law, and states have nearly universally adopted the Uniform Trade Secrets Act. The United States also has federal law {{in the form of}} the <b>Economic</b> <b>Espionage</b> Act of 1996 (...) , which makes the theft or misappropriation of a trade secret a federal crime. This law contains two provisions criminalizing two sorts of activity. The first, , criminalizes the theft of trade secrets to benefit foreign powers. The second, , criminalizes their theft for commercial or economic purposes. (The statutory penalties are different for the two offenses.) In Commonwealth common law jurisdictions, confidentiality and trade secrets are regarded as an equitable right rather than a property right but penalties for theft are roughly the same as in the United States.|$|E

5000|$|Porteous {{raises the}} question: is commercially oriented, economic/scientific/technical espionage efficient? He observes that some claim {{intelligence}} obtained through <b>economic</b> <b>espionage</b> would be [...] "tactically useless" [...] {{for a number}} of reasons. Typically, the barriers to potential efficiency are related to an intelligence agency's lack of knowledge of the subject area and to problems associated with the dissemination of intelligence once acquired. These arguments tend to come from individuals who at the same time argue for or accept the need for government to defend against <b>economic</b> <b>espionage</b> engaged in by other governments. It is difficult to support these points simultaneously: if <b>economic</b> <b>espionage</b> is [...] "tactically useless", it is similarly useless to foreign governments that practice it, and thus need not be defended against.|$|E
5000|$|The {{difference}} between competitive intelligence and <b>economic</b> or industrial <b>espionage</b> is not clear; {{one needs to}} understand the legal basics to recognize how {{to draw the line}} between the two.

40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to advance our understanding of inter-organizational learning by introducing evidence of illegal learning across organizational boundaries. By drawing upon data from a largely unexplored area of management and organization studies, that of <b>economic</b> and industrial <b>espionage,</b> we attempt to demonstrate that contemporary debates could benefit considerably from an exploration of such illegal forms of learning. Three vignettes involving <b>economic</b> and industrial <b>espionage</b> are presented to demonstrate the limitations of both our current conceptualisations of inter-organizational learning and what motivates people to illegally acquire knowledge across organizational boundaries. In direct challenge to the dominant 'black-box' view of organizations presupposed by the sticky and leaky knowledge debate these vignettes present powerful evidence of external forces encouraging the forced leakage of knowledge. Resultantly our understanding of what constitutes sticky and leaky knowledge has to be adapted. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of the implications for future researc...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Economic</b> or {{industrial}} <b>espionage</b> commonly {{occurs in}} one of two ways. Firstly, a dissatisfied employee appropriates information to advance interests or to damage the company. Secondly, a competitor or foreign government seeks information to advance its own technological or financial interest. [...] "Moles", or trusted insiders, are generally considered the best sources for <b>economic</b> or industrial <b>espionage.</b> Historically known as a [...] "patsy", an insider can be induced, willingly or under duress, to provide information. A patsy may be initially asked to hand over inconsequential information and, once compromised by committing a crime, bribed into handing over more sensitive material. Individuals may leave one company to take up employment with another and take sensitive information with them. Such apparent behavior {{has been the focus of}} numerous industrial espionage cases that have resulted in legal battles. Some countries hire individuals to do spying rather than use of their own intelligence agencies. Academics, business delegates, and students are often thought to be used by governments in gathering information. Some countries, such as Japan, have been reported to expect students be debriefed on returning home. A spy may follow a guided tour of a factory and then get [...] "lost".
