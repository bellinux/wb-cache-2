5|$|Stuart Lake {{described}} {{in his book}} how Earp single-handedly stood down a large crowd that wanted to lynch gambler Michael O'Rourke (Johnny Behind the Deuce). O'Rourke had killed Henry Schneider, chief engineer of the Tombstone Mining and Milling Company—he said in self defense. Henry was well-liked, and a mob of miners quickly gathered, threatening to lynch O'Rourke on the spot. In fact, the Epitaph gave primary credit to Ben Sippy <b>for</b> <b>standing</b> down the crowd, assisted by Virgil Earp, Wyatt Earp, and Johnny Behan. This incident as described by Lake added to Earp's modern legend as a lawman.|$|E
5|$|Zero {{was created}} by Taro Yoko, the game's {{director}} and co-writer, and designed by Kimihiko Fujisaka. Yoko wanted an unusual type of protagonist {{that had not been}} featured very often in games. Fujisaka crafted her to emulate the dark tones of the series, although he also added features to create a feminine vibe, such as the flower in her eye. Despite being criticized for her characterization and personality, she has also been praised for her interactions with the other characters and <b>for</b> <b>standing</b> out among video game protagonists. Fans of the Drakengard series in Japan have also received her positively.|$|E
5|$|A mock-up was {{manufactured}} in Japan after Kawasaki won the contract. It was shipped to Singapore {{and put on}} public display during the 1984 National Exhibition held in November 1984 at World Trade Centre. The mock-up featured three choices of seating arrangements and colour schemes; {{members of the public}} were invited to give feedback on these options. The finalised interior design of the C151 trains consisted of a fully longitudinal seating arrangement. The bucket seats were made of plastic; glass partitions separated the seating areas from the passenger doors. Strap lines <b>for</b> <b>standing</b> passengers were installed in the middle of every car. The colour scheme of each adjacent car's interior is distinct to make car identification in cases of fault reporting easier for passengers. Originally the colour scheme of the driving trailer cars was orange, that of the second and fifth motor cars was blue, and that of the two centre motor cars was green. There were nine seats between two doors; this was reduced to seven after the first round of refurbishment.|$|E

He vows revenge on Bart, setting up a regular plotline in future episodes. The charges against Krusty are dropped and he regains the trust of the community. Homer then apologizes to Krusty for fingering him in court, and Krusty thanks Bart <b>for</b> <b>standing</b> up for the truth and sticking to his convictions, and a picture is taken of the two shaking hands (which Bart later hangs in his bedroom, refilled with Krusty decor).|$|E
5|$|Construction of Lerkendal {{started as}} a public works during the 1930s, as a measure to create jobs. It opened on 10 August 1947, and {{consisted}} of a main grass field, two gravel fields, two handball courts and two tennis courts. The main field had a spectator capacity for 37,000 on temporary stands, making it the second-largest stadium in the country. The long sides consisted of temporary wooden stands, with seating on the south stand and standing places on terraces on the north stand. The end sides of the stadium consisted of grass embankments at a 30 percent angle, allowing <b>for</b> <b>standing</b> space for spectators without having to build stands. Changing rooms were located in a nearby German-built barracks dating from the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|However, the United Kingdom courts {{gradually}} {{adopted a}} single sufficient interest test for all prerogative orders. In R. v. Commissioners of Customs and Excise, ex parte Cook (1969), for example, the High Court used a sufficient interest test {{to determine whether}} an applicant had standing {{to apply for a}} mandatory order. Singapore followed the UK's move towards a uniform test for all prerogative orders. In Re Lim Chor Pee, ex parte Law Society of Singapore (1986), the Court of Appeal endorsed the sufficient interest test for mandatory orders. In that case, the Law Society of Singapore had applied for a mandamus (now known as a mandatory order) to ensure that the Disciplinary Committee heard and investigated all six charges levied against an advocate and solicitor. The Court, applying the decision of the House of Lords in R. v. Inland Revenue Commissioners, ex parte National Federation of Self-Employed and Small Businesses Ltd. (1981), held that the test <b>for</b> <b>standing</b> was whether the applicant had a sufficient interest in the subject matter, and not whether he or she had a specific legal right.|$|E

5|$|Nelson Mandela's father, Gadla Henry Mphakanyiswa Mandela, {{was a local}} {{chief and}} {{councillor}} to the monarch; he {{was appointed to the}} position in 1915, after his predecessor was accused of corruption by a governing white magistrate. In 1926, Gadla was also sacked for corruption, but Nelson was told that his father had lost his job <b>for</b> <b>standing</b> up to the magistrate's unreasonable demands. A devotee of the god Qamata, Gadla was a polygamist with four wives, four sons and nine daughters, who lived in different villages. Nelson's mother was Gadla's third wife, Nosekeni Fanny, daughter of Nkedama of the Right Hand House {{and a member of the}} amaMpemvu clan of the Xhosa.|$|E
5|$|Peter Cane has {{distinguished}} between {{cases where the}} courts have found that an applicant has standing to represent identifiable individuals (associational standing), and cases where the applicant purports to represent the public interest (public interest standing). Under this analysis, ex parte Greenpeace may be regarded {{as an example of}} the former, and ex parte World Development Movement the latter. In 1994, the Law Commission recommended that there should be a two-track system <b>for</b> <b>standing.</b> An applicant should have standing in one of two situations: either in his or her personal capacity, in which case a remedy lies ex debito justitae ("from a debt of justice", that is, as a matter of right); or at the discretion of the court if it considers that it is in the public interest to accord standing.|$|E
5|$|A/S Ullevaal Stadion {{was founded}} on 27 January 1925. The company was owned 73.5% by Lyn, 24% Aker Municipality and 5.1% by the clubs Ullevaal, Tåsen, Nydalen and Heming. The stadium was built with a running track, {{allowing}} the stadium to {{also be used for}} track and field, and had a capacity of about 35,000 spectators. The stadium cost NOK416,000. The grand opening was held on 26 September 1926 by Crown Prince Olav. It was followed by a friendly match between a reinforced Lyn and Örgryte IS of Sweden, where Lyn won 5–1. In the opening game, tickets cost NOK3 for seats, NOK2 <b>for</b> <b>standing</b> places and NOK1 on the end stands. The stadium became both the home ground for Lyn and hosted track and field events. The first international match was held on 29 May 1927 and featured Norway losing 0–1 against Denmark. The match against Sweden from the Nordic Football Championship 1933/36 on 22 September 1935 was held in front of a crowd of 35,495, which still stands as the spectator record. The stadium was served by the Oslo Metro {{with the opening of the}} Sognsvann Line in 1934. In 1938, a new East Stand (Klokkesvingen) was opened.|$|E
