5|$|A 1926 {{graduate}} of the United States Naval Academy, Mumma served {{on a number of}} warships. He studied marine engineering at the L'École Nationale Supérieure de Maritime in Paris, where he learned the latest techniques of maritime construction. During World War II he served at the David Taylor Model Basin, where he investigated problems of propeller design. In January 1943, he took over the Propeller desk at the Bureau of Ships. He joined the Alsos Mission in 1944, and in the last <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> was part of a 75-man task force that captured the city of Kiel, including the whole garrison of 150,000 men.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to Germany, Köln operated Flettner Fl 282 helicopters as an experiment. She provided gunfire support to German ground forces during Operation Barbarossa, {{the invasion of}} the Soviet Union in 1941, and returned to Norway in 1942. Ultimately, she was sunk in Wilhelmshaven in March 1945 by American bombers. Her guns were still above water, which allowed her to support the defending German army against British ground forces until the final <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war.</b>|$|E
5|$|After the {{planning}} for the invasion, Dutton took command of 3 Commando Brigade, which was already serving in Afghanistan. In 2003, he led the brigade into the start of Iraq War, supported by units from the British Army {{as well as the}} United States Marine Corps, making Dutton the first British officer to command American troops since the Second World War. He commanded his men through heavy resistance from Iraqi forces in the early <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war.</b>|$|E

5|$|Cöln and Dresden {{joined the}} High Seas Fleet in 1918, which limited their service careers. They were {{assigned}} to the II Scouting Group, and participated in an abortive fleet operation to Norway to attack British convoys. They were to have led attacks on British merchant traffic designed to lure out the British Grand Fleet and force a climactic fleet battle in the final <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> but the Wilhelmshaven Mutiny forced the cancellation of the plan. The two ships were interned and eventually scuttled in Scapa Flow in June 1919. Both Dresden and Cöln remain on the bottom of Scapa Flow.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> in the Cape Colony, the Boers {{surrounded}} and laid siege to the British garrisons {{in the towns}} of Kimberley and Mafeking and destroyed the railway bridge across the Orange River at Hopetown. Substantial British reinforcements (an army corps under General Redvers Buller) arrived in South Africa and were dispersed to three main fronts. While Buller himself advanced from the port of Durban in Natal to relieve the besieged town of Ladysmith and a smaller detachment under Lieutenant General Gatacre secured the Cape Midlands, the reinforced 1st Division under Lord Methuen advanced from the Orange River to relieve Kimberley.|$|E

5|$|On 3 June 1944, Braun's sister Gretl Braun married SS-Gruppenführer Hermann Fegelein, {{who served}} as Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler's liaison officer on Hitler's staff. Hitler used the {{marriage}} {{as an excuse to}} allow Braun to appear at official functions, as she could then be introduced as Fegelein's sister-in-law. When Fegelein was caught in the closing <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> trying to escape to Sweden or Switzerland, Hitler ordered his execution. He was shot for desertion in the garden of the Reich Chancellery on 28 April 1945.|$|E
5|$|Some of the {{released}} Croats apparently {{succeeded in}} travelling to the Slovene Littoral {{in the closing}} <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war.</b> They were then organised as a separate unit of the largely illusory remnant of the Armed Forces of the Independent State of Croatia {{under the command of}} General Matija Parac, which was formally part of General Draža Mihailović's Chetniks. The unit was under the direct command of General Miodrag Damjanović. Later the unit retreated to British-occupied northern Italy.|$|E
5|$|Three {{weeks after}} {{the failure of the}} operation, a second attack was {{launched}} which proved more successful in sinking a blockship {{at the entrance to the}} canal but ultimately did not close off Bruges completely. Further plans to attack Ostend came to nothing during the summer of 1918, and the threat from Bruges would not be finally stopped until the last <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> when the town was liberated by Allied land forces.|$|E

5|$|After her commissioning, Justice was {{assigned}} to the Mediterranean Fleet. In September 1909, she traveled to the United States for the Hudson-Fulton Celebration. At the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, she {{was assigned}} to the 2nd Division of the 2nd Squadron of the Mediterranean Fleet. She covered troop convoys from North Africa to France in the first <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> and spent the rest based at Corfu and Mudros without seeing any action. After the war ended, she participated in the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War, though a mutiny in the French fleet in April 1919 led to the fleet's withdrawal. Justice was sold for scrapping in 1922.|$|E
5|$|All {{four main}} Einsatzgruppen {{took part in}} mass shootings from the early <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war.</b> Initially the targets were adult Jewish men, but by August the net had been widened to include women, children, and the elderly—the entire Jewish population. Initially there was a semblance of {{legality}} given to the shootings, with trumped-up charges being read out (arson, sabotage, black marketeering, or refusal to work, for example) and victims being killed by a firing squad. As this method proved too slow, the Einsatzkommandos began to take their victims out in larger groups and shot them next to, or even inside, mass graves that had been prepared. Some Einsatzkommandos started to use automatic weapons, with survivors being killed with a pistol shot.|$|E
5|$|Arcona {{served in}} all three German navies {{in the first half}} of the 20th century. She served both with the fleet and abroad during her career in the Imperial Navy in the early 1900s. In World War I, she was used as a coastal defense ship and then as a support vessel for the U-boat {{campaign}} in the Atlantic. After the war, she served briefly in the Reichsmarine before being withdrawn and used for secondary duties. After the German Navy became the Kriegsmarine in 1935, it rebuilt Arcona as a floating anti-aircraft battery and used her to defend several German ports during World War II. She was scuttled in the final <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> and broken up for scrap in 19481949.|$|E

50|$|On <b>the</b> first <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> <b>the</b> {{squadron}} pilots {{flew from}} the early morning, intercepting bomber aircraft and engaging in combat with escorting fighters. During one of such sorties Krasnodębski's wing shot down a German Dornier Do 17, which toppled {{down to the ground}} in flames, killing the German crew.|$|R
5|$|At {{some point}} on 28 April or 29 April, General Gotthard Heinrici, Commander-in-Chief of Army Group Vistula, was {{relieved}} of his command after disobeying Hitler's direct orders to hold Berlin {{at all costs}} and never order a retreat, {{and was replaced by}} General Kurt Student. General Kurt von Tippelskirch was named as Heinrici's interim replacement until Student could arrive and assume control. There remains some confusion as to who was in command, as some references say that Student was captured by the British and never arrived. Regardless of whether von Tippelskirch or Student was in command of Army Group Vistula, the rapidly deteriorating situation that the Germans faced meant that Army Group Vistula coordination of the armies under its nominal command during the last few <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> was of little significance.|$|E
5|$|Dresden was {{commissioned}} into service with the High Seas Fleet eight {{months before the}} end of World War I; as a result, her service career was limited and she did not see action. She participated in a fleet operation to Norway to attack British convoys to Scandinavia, but they failed to locate any convoys and returned to port. Dresden was to have participated in a climactic sortie in the final <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> but a revolt in the fleet forced Admirals Reinhard Scheer and Franz von Hipper to cancel the operation. The ship was interned in Scapa Flow {{after the end of the}} war and scuttled with the fleet there on 21 June 1919, under orders from the fleet commander Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{armistice}} on 27July 1953, the squadron remained in South Korea on garrison duties—initially at Kimpo, later at Kunsan—until transferring to Iwakuni on 12October 1954. It departed for Australia on 19November and arrived in Sydney on 3December, having been based overseas for eleven years, {{a record for}} an RAAF unit. Its performance in the early <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> has been cited {{as a factor in}} the United States' decision to ratify the ANZUS treaty in September 1951. The squadron's casualty rate in Korea was twenty-five percent killed or captured. Forty-one pilots died, thirty-five from the RAAF and six on exchange from the Royal Air Force. A further seven pilots became prisoners of war. Aircraft losses totalled almost sixty, including over forty Meteors, mostly to ground fire. The squadron flew 18,872 sorties, including 3,872 in Mustangs and 15,000 in Meteors. It was credited with shooting down five MiG-15s and destroying 3,700 buildings, 1,408 vehicles, ninety-eight railway engines and carriages, and sixteen bridges.|$|E

50|$|During <b>the</b> 18-day Kurukshetra <b>war,</b> Uttar and his {{brothers}} fought in support <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pandavas. Uttar was killed on <b>the</b> very first <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> by Shalya. Uttar's brother Shweta, who witnessed <b>the</b> ghastly death <b>of</b> his brother, immediately went into a frenzy and started attacking Shalya repeatedly to avenge his brother's death. Bhishma came to Shalya's rescue and ultimately killed Shweta. Thus the two brothers died on the same <b>day,</b> within minutes <b>of</b> each other. In the Chatahurdi compilation, a third brother, Shankhya, was killed by Drona on <b>the</b> seventh <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war.</b>|$|R
