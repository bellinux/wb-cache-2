5|$|Although {{the rocks}} beneath the city {{contained}} a vast reservoir of fresh water, {{known as the}} Trarza Lake, it is running out, owing to the large growth of the city. Engineers have warned it could run out by 2054, since it is not rain-fed, and is therefore non-renewable. The problem is particularly bad in the sandy shanty towns {{where the majority of}} the population lives. Many people already <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> water, which is expensive compared with the average wage.|$|E
5|$|In November 1965, {{together}} with four business partners, David opened Elizabeth David Ltd, a shop selling kitchen equipment, at 46 Bourne Street, Pimlico. The partners were {{spurred on by}} the closure of a professional kitchenware shop in Soho on the retirement of its owner, and the recent success of Terence Conran's Habitat shops, which sold among much else imported kitchen equipment for which there was evidently a market. Among her customers were Albert and Michel Roux, who shopped there for equipment that they would otherwise <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> in France.|$|E
5|$|In 894 Stylianos Zaoutzes, basileopator {{and leading}} {{minister}} of Leo VI the Wise (r. 886–912), convinced the emperor {{to move the}} Bulgarian market from Constantinople to Thessaloniki. That move affected not only private interests but also the international commercial importance of Bulgaria and the principle of Byzantine–Bulgarian trade, regulated with the Treaty of 716 and later agreements on the most favoured nation basis. The Bulgarian merchants were allowed to live in Constantinople, resided in their own colony and paid favourable taxes. The city was a major destination of trade routes from all over Europe and Asia and {{the transfer of the}} Bulgarian market to Thessaloniki cut short the direct access to goods from the east, which under the new circumstances the Bulgarians would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> through middlemen, who were close associates of Stylianos Zaoutzes. In Thessaloniki the Bulgarians were also forced to pay higher tariffs to sell their goods, enriching Zaoutzes' cronies.|$|E

25|$|The {{exemption}} of employer-sponsored {{health benefits}} from federal income and payroll taxes distorts {{the health care}} market. The U.S. government, unlike some other countries, does not treat employer funded health care benefits as a taxable benefit in kind to the employee. The value of the lost tax revenue from a benefits in kind tax is an estimated $150billion a year. Some regard this as being disadvantageous to people who <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> insurance in the individual market which must be paid from income received after tax.|$|E

25|$|While many Palestinians {{living in}} rural {{communities}} {{have no access to}} running water, Israeli settlers who export their products have irrigated farms, lush gardens and swimming pools. The 450,000 settlers use as much or even more water than all 2.3 million Palestinians together. Many Palestinians <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> water from Israel, of often dubious quality, delivered with tanker trucks at very high prices. Water tankers are forced to take long detours to avoid Israeli military checkpoints and roads which are out of bounds to Palestinians, resulting in steep increases in the price of water.|$|E
25|$|Chilean {{software}} engineer Jorge Arellano Cid conceived the Dillo project in late 1999, publishing {{the first version}} of Dillo in December of that year. His primary goal in creating Dillo was to democratize access to information. Arellano Cid believed that no one should <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> a new computer or pay for broadband in order to enjoy the World Wide Web. To this end, he designed Dillo to be small, fast, and efficient, capable of performing well even on an Intel 80486 CPU with a dial-up Internet access.|$|E

While the global designs for whitewater boats and paddles change annually, Indian kayakers have to pay high fees if they want to import any kind of gear, or they <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> used gear in Nepal. More often than not, one will see Indian kayaking guides riding down the river in a Perception Amp, Piroutte or Dancer designs, while the kayakers from abroad ride the river in their new design, planing hull, centred volume kayaks from Riot, Pyranha, or Wave Sport.|$|E

The company, along with Takara Tomy, suggested to the filmmakers that combining robots be the main draw for the sequel. They insisted on keeping the alternate modes of some of the returning characters similar so that consumers would not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> toys of the same characters. Bay used real F-16 Fighting Falcon and tank fire when filming the battles. Many of the new Autobot cars supplied by General Motors were brightly colored to look distinctive on screen. Revenge of the Fallen features 46 robots, while the original movie had 14.|$|E
25|$|Norsk Data {{grew out}} of the {{development}} Simulation for Automatic Machinery 2 (SAM 2), a minicomputer developed at the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment (NDRE). The computer was ordered in 1966 for analysis of satellite data at Tromsø Satellite Station (TSS) and was the third computer built by NDRE. The main developers of the system were Rolf Skår, Per Bjørge, Lars Monrad-Krohn and Yngvar Lundh. SAM 2 was the first in Europe and among the first three in the world which used integrated circuits. The project was risky, as TSS originally had proposed buying an American computer and NDRE would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> such a computer if SAM 2 failed.|$|E
25|$|The sale of {{the team}} to a large {{corporation}} drew the ire of Colorado U.S. Senator Edwin C. Johnson, who introduced {{a bill that would}} have exempted teams owned by beer or liquor manufacturers from the antitrust exemption granted to Major League Baseball by the Supreme Court. He argued that Busch had bought the team solely to sell beer, and that as a result other companies would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> baseball teams to remain competitive, leading to monopolies in both businesses. When it was pointed out to him that no one had objected to brewer Jacob Ruppert's ownership of the New York Yankees, he responded that Ruppert had always kept both businesses separate.|$|E

25|$|On January 2, 1992, Moldova {{introduced}} a market economy, liberalizing prices, {{which resulted in}} huge inflation. From 1992 to 2001, the young country suffered its worst economic crisis, leaving most of the population below the poverty line. In 1993, a national currency, the Moldovan leu, was introduced to replace the Soviet ruble. The end of the planned economy also meant that industrial enterprises would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> supplies and sell their goods by themselves, {{and most of the}} management was unprepared for such a change. Moldova's industry, especially machine building, became all but defunct, and unemployment skyrocketed. The economic fortunes of Moldova began to change in 2001; since then the country has seen a steady annual growth of between 5% and 10%. In the early 2000s, there was also a considerable growth of emigration of Moldovans looking for work (mostly illegally) in Italy, Portugal, Spain, Greece, Cyprus, Turkey, Russia and other countries. Remittances from Moldovans abroad account for almost 38% of Moldova's GDP, the second-highest percentage in the world. Officially, Moldova's annual GDP is on the order of $1,000 per capita; however, {{a significant part of the}} economy goes unregistered due to corruption.|$|E
25|$|As of 2007, the {{estimated}} average per capita supply in the West Bank had increased to about 98 liter per capita per day (98 lpcd). The estimated household use was 50 lpcd, with many households consuming as little as 20 lpcd, even if connected to the network. Due to the fragmentation of the West Bank, movement of water from water-rich areas to Palestinian communities with water shortage is inhibited. Therefore, there are huge differences in water use in the eastern and southern West Bank. While the daily consumption in the Jericho district was 161 liters in 2009, in Jericho city even 225 liters, {{it was less than}} 100 liters in other areas. In the central Jordan Valley it was about 60 liters. Inhabitants of a-Nu’ima, east of Jericho, had only 24 liters. Residents of villages that are cut off from water supply <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> water from watertanker operators. All of the eastern West Bank, except the Israeli settlements and Jericho are designated as a closed military area or as an area that for other reasons has access restrictions for Palestinians. In 2012, 90% of the small Palestinian communities living there had less than 60 lpcd. Over half of them, mostly Bedouin or herding communities, often cut off from their traditional wells, had even less than 30 litres per person per day.|$|E

Contractor Hank Brusser told the court that Streeter asked him to fill in portions of the shoreline in order to create confusion over land titles. [...] According to Brusser, Streeter said that: [...] "They [...] will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> us off" [...] and that [...] "We'll get a million out of it". Streeter was also motivated by the profit he gained by selling and taxing the land he claimed.|$|E
500|$|The NOK 1billion {{renovation}} {{has become}} a scandal, due to the station being built in a curve, and thus does not have straight platforms. This will become a security problem; in addition it will create a gap up to [...] between the train and the platform, hindering accessibility to the trains for disabled people. Norges Statsbaner claims they will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> new trains due to this station alone, costing the state-owned company NOK 1.5billion. Minister of Transport, Liv Signe Navarsete from the Centre Party, has said that resolving the problems by building a straight station is not an alternative, since it would cost an additional hundred-millions of NOK, and delay the new station several years.|$|E
500|$|Originally {{conceived}} as a television series, Mulholland Drive began as a 90-minute pilot produced for Touchstone Television and intended for the ABC television network.
