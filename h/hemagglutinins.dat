50|$|Agglutination, using blood agglutinins {{known as}} <b>hemagglutinins,</b> is used diagnostically to {{identify}} blood types {{of human beings}} based on the reaction between the erythrocyte (Red blood cell) antigens and agglutinins http://www.answers.com/topic/agglutinin. Human erythrocytes have only two types of antigens (Antigen A and B) expressed in different combinations to give either erythrocytes that express only antigen A, antigen B, antigen A and B together or no antigen at all. When erythrocytes are exposed to <b>hemagglutinins</b> (anti-A and Anti-B antibodies), those expressing antigen A or B coagulate upon contacting anti-A and anti-B <b>hemagglutinins</b> respectively. Erythrocytes expressing both antigens coagulate upon contacting either anti-A or anti-B <b>hemagglutinins</b> while those not expressing any antigen do not coagulate upon contact with any hemagglutinin. This technique serves as a quick and effective method for identifying the blood type of a person and it is essential when blood transfusion has to be performed quickly to replenish lost blood.|$|E

40|$|Botulism is {{a disease}} {{involving}} intoxication with botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs), toxic proteins produced by Clostridium botulinum and other clostridia. The 150 kDa neurotoxin is produced {{in conjunction with other}} proteins to form the botulinum progenitor toxin complex (PTC), alternating in size from 300 kDa to 500 kDa. These progenitor complexes can be classified into <b>hemagglutinin</b> positive or <b>hemagglutinin</b> negative, depending on the ability of some of the neurotoxin-associated proteins (NAPs) to cause hemagglutination. The <b>hemagglutinin</b> positive progenitor toxin complex consists of BoNT, nontoxic non-hemagglutinin (NTNH), and three <b>hemagglutinin</b> proteins; HA- 70, HA- 33, and HA- 17. <b>Hemagglutinin</b> negative progenitor toxin complexes contain BoNT and NTNH as the minimally functional PTC (M-PTC), but not the three <b>hemagglutinin</b> proteins. Interestingly, the genome of <b>hemagglutinin</b> negative progenitor toxin complexes comprises open reading frames (orfs) which encode for three proteins, but the existence of these proteins has not yet been extensively demonstrated. In this work, we demonstrate that these three proteins exist and form part of the PTC for <b>hemagglutinin</b> negative complexes. Several <b>hemagglutinin</b> negative strains producing BoNT/A, /E, and /F were found to contain the three open reading frame proteins.

Previous work has suggested, although never conclusively demonstrated, that neurotoxin alone cannot survive passage through the stomach and/or cannot be absorbed from the gut without the involvement of auxiliary proteins in the complex. Therefore, this study compared the relative absorption and toxicity of three preparations of neurotoxin in an in vivo mouse model. Equimolar amounts of serotype A complex with <b>hemagglutinins,</b> complex without <b>hemagglutinins,</b> and purified neurotoxin were surgically introduced into the stomach or into the small intestine. In some experiments, movement of neurotoxin from the site of administration was restricted by ligation of the pylorus. Comparison of relative toxicities demonstrated that at adequate doses, complex with <b>hemagglutinins,</b> complex without <b>hemagglutinins,</b> and pure neurotoxin can be absorbed from the stomach. The potency of neurotoxin in complex was greater than that of pure neurotoxin, but the magnitude of this difference diminished as the dosage of neurotoxin increased. Qualitatively similar results were obtained when complex with <b>hemagglutinins,</b> complex without <b>hemagglutinins,</b> and pure neurotoxin were placed directly into the intestine.

40|$|AbstractInfluenza virus {{delivers}} its genome to {{the host}} cytoplasm via a process of membrane fusion mediated by the viral <b>hemagglutinin</b> protein. Optimal fusion likely requires multiple <b>hemagglutinin</b> trimers, so the spatial distribution of <b>hemagglutinin</b> on the viral envelope may influence fusion mechanism. We have previously shown that moderate depletion of cholesterol from the influenza viral envelope accelerates fusion kinetics even though it decreases fusion efficiency, both in a reversible manner. Here, we use electron cryo-microscopy to measure how the <b>hemagglutinin</b> lateral density in the viral envelope changes with cholesterol extraction. We extract this information by measuring the radial distribution function of electron density in > 4000 viral images per sample, assigning <b>hemagglutinin</b> density by comparing images with and without anti-HA Fab bound. On average, <b>hemagglutinin</b> trimers move closer together: we estimate that the typical trimer-trimer spacing reduces from 94 to 84  Å when ∼ 90 % of cholesterol {{is removed from the}} viral membrane. Upon restoration of viral envelope cholesterol, this spacing once again expands. This finding can qualitatively explain the observed changes to fusion kinetics: contemporary models from single-virus microscopy are that fusion requires the engagement of several <b>hemagglutinin</b> trimers in close proximity.
