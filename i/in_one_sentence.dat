25|$|Your phrase 'my copy is not mine' {{is not a}} bull. It is {{perfectly}} good English {{to use the same}} word in two different senses <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>sentence,</b> particularly when there is usage. Incongruity of language is no bull, for it expresses meaning. But incongruity of ideas (as {{in the case of the}} Irishman who was pulling up the rope, and finding it did not finish, cried out that somebody had cut off the other end of it) is the genuine bull.|$|E
25|$|Semantics is {{the branch}} of {{linguistics}} that examines the meaning of natural language, the notion of reference and denotation, {{and the concept of}} possible worlds. One concept used in the study of semantics is predicate logic, which is a system that uses symbols and alphabet letters to represent the overall meaning of a sentence. Quantifiers in semantics – such as the quantifier in the antecedent of a bound variable pronoun – can be expressed in two ways. There is an existential quantifier, ∃, meaning some. There is also a universal quantifier, ∀, meaning every, each, or all. Ambiguity arises when there are multiple quantifiers <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>sentence.</b>|$|E

500|$|Sir Roderick Murchison, {{giving a}} speech at the Royal Geographical Society, felt able to [...] "feel a pride" [...] in Wallace's success, and in the [...] "striking contributions" [...] made to science. He takes {{interest}} in [...] "Wallace's line" [...] which he calls [...] "this ingenious speculation", with [...] "the two faunas wonderfully contrasted" [...] either side of the deep channel between Borneo and Celebes, or Bali and Lombok. He points out the same principle between the British Isles and continental Europe, though there the conclusion is rather that the same fauna and flora is found on both sides. However, Murchison states his disagreement with Wallace's support for James Hutton's principle of uniformitarianism, that [...] "all former changes of the outline of the earth were produced slowly", opining that the Bali–Lombok channel probably formed suddenly. He mentions <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>sentence</b> that the book contains [...] "interesting and important facts" [...] on physical geography, native inhabitants, climate and products of the archipelago, and describes Wallace as a great naturalist and a [...] "most attractive writer".|$|E
500|$|Today this theory, {{as well as}} Lauer and Firths' conclusions, {{is widely}} questioned. Archaeological {{evidence}} of Peribsen has almost entirely been found in Upper Egypt. In particular, his name {{does not appear in}} Lower Egyptian records surviving from that time. It is argued that Peribsen may not have ruled over all of Egypt and therefore did not have the authority to force a change in state religion. Another piece of evidence that argues against the [...] "heretic Peribsen" [...] theory is the false door of the priest Shery at Saqqara. Shery held office during the early Fourth dynasty. The inscription on the false door connects the name of Peribsen <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>sentence</b> with another shadowy king of the Second dynasty, Senedj. According to the addendum, Shery was [...] "overseer of all wab-priests of king Peribsen in the necropolis of king Senedj, in his mortuary temple and at all other places". This implies that the funerary cult of Peribsen continued at least until the Fourth dynasty, inconsistent with the assumption that Peribsen's name was not allowed to be mentioned. Additionally, Egyptologists such as Herman te Velde point out that Shery was not the only Fourth dynasty priest participating in the funerary cult of Peribsen. Inkef, possibly a brother or cousin of Shery, also held the title of a [...] "supervisor of Ka-priests of Peribsen".|$|E

Out {{of state}} pressure forced Pennewill {{to reduce the}} number of lashings given <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>sentence,</b> but the pressure seemed to only intensify local opinion in favor of the use of the whipping post. He also made a controversial appointment to his elder brother, James Pennewill, the position of Chief Justice of Delaware. His brother served until his death 26 years later in 1935. It was during Pennewill's term that the DuPont Company lost its anti trust suit and was forced to divest itself of what became the Hercules Powder and Atlas Powder Companies.|$|E
2500|$|Hippocrates, in 5th century BC, {{was one of}} {{the first}} people to mention the lymphatic system. In his work On Joints, he briefly {{mentioned}} the lymph nodes <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>sentence.</b> Rufus of Ephesus, a Roman physician, identified the axillary, inguinal and mesenteric lymph nodes as well as the thymus during the 1st to 2nd century AD. The first mention of lymphatic vessels was in 3rd century BC by Herophilos, a Greek anatomist living in Alexandria, who incorrectly concluded that the [...] "absorptive veins of the lymphatics," [...] by which he meant the lacteals (lymph vessels of the intestines), drained into the hepatic portal veins, and thus into the liver. The findings of Ruphus and Herophilos were further propagated by the Greek physician Galen, who described the lacteals and mesenteric lymph nodes which he observed in his dissection of apes and pigs in the 2nd century AD.|$|E
2500|$|In October 2004, a {{journalist}} from Ciel et Espace interviewed Shahn Majid of Queen Mary, University of London about his report on Grichka Bogdanov's thesis.

[...] A [...] "draft [...] construction" [...] became [...] "la première construction [...] " [...] ("the first [...] construction"). Elsewhere, an added word demonstrated, according to Majid, that [...] "Bogdanov does not understand his own draft results." [...] Majid also described more than ten other modifications of meaning, each one biased towards [...] "surestimation outrancière"—"outrageous over-estimation." [...] Majid said that his original report described a [...] "very weak" [...] student who nevertheless demonstrated [...] "an impressive amount of determination to obtain a doctorate." [...] Later, Majid claimed in a Usenet post that, in an addendum to Avant Le Big Bang, Grichka intentionally misquoted Majid's opinion on the way this interview had been transcribed.|$|E

2500|$|According to {{prominent}} historians like Alexander Zimin and Anna Khoroshkevich, {{the continuous}} {{use of the}} term Moscovia was a result of traditional habit and the need to distinguish between the Muscovite and the Lithuanian part of the Rus', {{as well as of the}} political interests of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, which competed with Moscow for the western regions of the Rus'. Due to the propaganda of the Commonwealth, as well as of the Jesuits, the term Moscovia was used instead of Russia in many parts of Europe where prior to the reign of Peter the Great there was a lack of direct knowledge of the country. In Northern Europe and at the court of the Holy Roman Empire, however, the country was known under its own name, Russia or Rossia. Sigismund von Herberstein, ambassador of the Holy Roman Emperor in Russia, used both Russia and Moscovia in his work on the Russian tsardom and noted: [...] "The majority believes that Russia is a changed name of Roxolania. Muscovites ("Russians" [...] in the German version) refute this, saying that their country was originally called Russia (Rosseia)". Pointing to the difference between Latin and Russian names, French captain Jacques Margeret, who served in Russia and left a detailed description of L’Empire de Russie of the early 17th century that was presented to King Henry IV, stated that foreigners make [...] "a mistake when they call them Muscovites and not Russians. When they are asked what nation they are, they respond 'Russac', which means 'Russians', and when they are asked what place they are from, the answer is Moscow, Vologda, Ryasan and other cities". The closest analogue of the Latin term Moscovia in Russia was “Tsardom of Moscow”, or “Moscow Tsardom” (...) , which was used along with the name [...] "Russia", sometimes <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>sentence,</b> as in the name of the 17th century Russian work On the Great and Glorious Russian Moscow State (...)
