25|$|The usual {{designation}} for lanes on divided highways is {{the fastest}} lane is the one closest {{to the center of}} the road, and the slowest to the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>road.</b> Drivers are usually expected to keep in the slowest lane unless overtaking, though with more traffic congestion all lanes are often used.|$|E
25|$|In curved sections, {{the outside}} <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> is superelevated above the centerline. Since {{the road is}} sloped down toward {{the inside of the}} curve, gravity draws the vehicle toward the inside of the curve. This causes a greater {{proportion}} of centripetal force to supplant the tyre friction that would otherwise be needed to negotiate the curve.|$|E

40|$|PAC {{learning}} typically {{assumes that}} the training and test sets are drawn from the same distributions. This assumption often is violated in practice. How can machine learning algorithms be biased to output hypotheses that are robust to alterations in the test distribution ? We create a framework for learning in environments where the test and training distributions differ because features in the test sets {{are likely to be}} missing or corrupted. Motivated by this framework, we present a new meta-learning algorithm, FeatureBoost. We demonstrate FeatureBoost on three learning problems using backprop nets, k-nearest neighbor, and decision trees. 1 Motivation Consider a backprop net learning to steer a car in Pomerleau's ALVINN system [7]. The principle internal features learned by ALVINN nets detect the left and right <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>road.</b> ALVINN nets do not learn internal features that detect road centerlines. This creates a problem when the left or right <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> are obstructed by p [...] ...|$|R
25|$|The parkway {{continues}} to follow Lake Kanawauke to Kanawauke Circle, where it intersects with County Route106 (CR106), formerly part of NY210. Not {{far from the}} junction, Seven Lakes Drive passes two more lakes, Lake Skannatati {{to the west and}} Lake Askoti to the east, as it slowly curves to the north. The highway crosses the Long Path near Lake Skannatati and connects to a parking area near Lake Askoti. Another trail, the Red Cross Trail, traverses Seven Lakes Drive at the northern end of Lake Askoti. About a half-mile (0.8km) north of Lake Askoti is Lake Tiorati, located along the eastern <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>road.</b> As the highway runs past the lake, it turns back to the northeast and eventually reaches Tiorati Circle at the northern tip of the lake. The junction serves as the east end of Arden Valley Road, the west end of Tiorati Brook Road, and the trailhead of the Lake Tiorati Trail.|$|E
500|$|Salt {{reduces the}} melting point of ice by freezing-point depression, {{causing it to}} melt at lower {{temperatures}} and run off to the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>road,</b> while sand increases traction by increasing friction between car tires and roadways. The amount of salt dropped varies with {{the condition of the}} road; to prevent the formation of light ice, approximately [...] is dropped, while thick snow can require up to [...] of salt, independent of the volume of sand dropped. The grit is sometimes mixed with molasses to help adhesion to the road surface. However, the sweet molasses often attracts livestock, who lick the road.|$|E

She is sitting by the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> reading when Lord Rochester rides up to his ancestral home. The sight of his huge dog, coming upon her suddenly, so startles Jane that she jumps to her feet, causing Lord Rochester's horse to shy and throw its rider. He injures his ankle, {{and has to be}} assisted to remount by 'the little witch,' as he calls her, who is the cause of his accident. One evening the maniac escapes from her nurse and sets fire to the room in which Lord Rochester has fallen asleep. He is saved from a horrible death by Jane. When next Jane's haughty aunt and cousins call upon Lord Rochester, they are just in time to be introduced to his bride, who is none other than the despised Jane Eyre." ...|$|E

50|$|Puddles {{commonly}} form during rain, and {{can cause}} problems for transport. Due to <b>the</b> angle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>road,</b> puddles tend to be forced by gravity to gather on <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>road.</b> This can cause splashing as cars drive through the puddles, which causes water to be sprayed onto pedestrians on the pavement. Irresponsible drivers may do this deliberately, which, in some countries, can lead to prosecution for careless driving.|$|R

2500|$|Seven Lakes Drive {{continues}} northeast {{from the}} circle, intersecting with several trails, including the Ramapo–Dunderberg Trail and the Appalachian Trail. A {{crossing of the}} Menomine Trail follows as the parkway turns to the east. The Menomine Trail follows Seven Lakes Drive for a short distance to nearby Silver Mine Lake on the south <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>road.</b> The Silver Mine Ski Road, a trail paralleling most of the lake, meets the parkway at the eastern lakeshore. From here, the road parallels Queensboro Brook for roughly [...] to reach the Long Mountain Roundabout adjacent to Queensboro Lake, {{the last of the}} seven lakes from south to north. Here, Seven Lakes Drive directly intersects US6 and indirectly connects to the nearby Palisades Interstate Parkway (PIP) by way of ramps leading away from the circle. Seven Lakes Drive follows US6 through the circle, joining the route as both roads merge onto the PIP.|$|E
2500|$|According to Butterworth, {{the first}} {{documentary}} reference to [...] "Milburn" [...] dates from 1200/1 when King John (1199–1215) granted {{the forest of}} Milburn to William de Stuteville, Lord of the Barony of Cottingham near Hull. The term [...] "forest" [...] in this context refers to an area suitable for hunting rather than forestry in its modern sense. [...] Of course, this in no sense implies that the modern village dates from this period, nor that there was necessarily a [...] "Burn" [...] and a [...] "Mill" [...] here. Goodchild argues that the name is actually derived from Mil Borran, meaning a stone by a Roman road. Curiously on the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> {{at the entrance to}} the lonning leading to the church at NY65360/29165 there is an ancient stone which is registered on the Sites and Monuments Record (SMR) as a cross base.

2500|$|Primarily, the Miller Highway {{consisted}} of six lanes, supported above the street level on steel columns, which were located {{at regular intervals}} (~80 feet) at the outer edges and center of the roadway. [...] Longitudinal strength girders ran between the support columns along {{the direction of the}} roadway. [...] The longitudinal girders supported the industrial looking balustrades and the median. [...] Lateral strength girders ran between the support columns across the roadway, and was the location of the expansion joints. [...] Smaller longitudinal and transverse floorbeams formed a lattice structure between major girders to support the road deck. [...] The road deck {{consisted of}} reinforced concrete, on top of which the paved surface would sit. [...] Originally this was Belgian block, and was eventually substituted or paved over with asphalt as construction materials matured. [...] Drainage was provided at the expansion joints (on the older sections) or grated channels along the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> (newest sections), with rainwater and snowmelt being plumbed to the street through scuppers and downspouts located at the main support columns. [...] It was not uncommon during the life of the highway that it would be supporting not only traffic, but 6 to 8 inches of standing water. [...] The high impermeable balustrades, the undersized scuppers, and the lack of drain cleaning / maintenance were all ingredients which contributed to the structure's demise.|$|E
