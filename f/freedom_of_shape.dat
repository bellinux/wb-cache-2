The inkjet and screen printing of the back electrode in organic solar cells with inverted architecture is investigated. To this purpose, different types of PEDOT:PSS hole transport layers were combined with ambient processed inkjet printed or evaporated Ag electrodes. The thickness of the PEDOT:PSS layer is the main factor determining {{the performance of the}} devices. A too thin layer of EL-P 5015 PEDOT:PSS allows penetration of the solvents from the Ag ink, which leads to degradation of the devices and a drop in performance. To overcome this effect, a 1200 nm thick layer of EL-P 5015 is required. Alternatively, an aqueous based coating formulation of PEDOT:PSS (S 305), can be combined with either inkjet printed or screen printed electrode at significantly reduced thickness down to 40 nm. At the same time, the performance of these devices was comparable to devices with an evaporated electrode. Reducing the thickness of PEDOT:PSS layer from 1200 nm to 40 nm is a very efficient way to reduce the manufacturing costs of OPV devices. In addition, combining of thin PEDOT:PSS layer with an inkjet printed Ag grid structure allows manufacturing of semi-transparent devices. cop. 2014 Elsevier B. V...|$|E
40|$|Shape Dynamics is {{a theory}} of gravity that replaces refoliation {{invariance}} for spatial Weyl invariance. Those solutions of the Einstein equations that have global, constant mean curvature slicings, are mirrored by solutions in Shape Dynamics. However, there are solutions of Shape Dynamics that have no counterpart in General relativity, {{just as there are}} solutions of GR that are not completely foliable by global constant mean curvature slicings (such as the Schwarzschild spacetime). It is therefore interesting to analyze directly the equations of motion of Shape Dynamics in order to find its own solutions, irrespective of properties of known solutions of GR. Here I perform a first study in this direction by utilizing the equations of motion of Shape Dynamics in a spherically symmetric, asymptotically flat ansatz to derive an analogue of the Birkhoff theorem. There are two significant differences with respect to the usual Birkhoff theorem in GR. The first regards the construction of the solution: the spatial Weyl gauge <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>shape</b> dynamics is used to simplify the problem, and boundary conditions are required. In fact the derivation is simpler than the usual Birkhof theorem as no Christoffel symbols are needed. The second, and most important difference is that the solution obtained is uniquely the isotropic wormhole solution, in which no singularity is present, as opposed to maximally extended Schwarzschild. This provides an explicit example of the breaking of the duality between General relativity and Shape Dynamics, and exhibits some of its consequences.

In the present paper, a specification technique is introduced in order to define multi-variant products using degrees of <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>shape</b> attributes (in the following shape-DoFs) within the product structure. Our goal is to plan variety actively {{at the beginning of}} product development and not to describe variety by change of parameter values of the product's components as introduced in variant trees. Shape-DoFs are classified in the fields of shape attributes (dimension, position, shape as well as their combinations) {{on the one hand and}} mandatory or optional components on the other hand. Set up on this taxonomy graphical symbols are introduced to be used in product modeling. As application example, a welded pipe rack based upon the assembly structure modeling the product structure in this way is visualized in the first step. The second step is to translate the shape-DoFs into design parameters and identify relationships between them. The result is a parameter plan, as well as a configuration concept. Both can be seen as basis for CAD-modeling the product as design template which is the third step. In case of our example, Autodesk Inventor (without the ETO-Environment) is used to create the CAD-data. Discussing the effects of the proposed method, it will be shown that different shape-DoFs may cause various impacts in the whole product development process. Regarding these effects, scenarios can be performed in order to identify the cost and resource optimal variation possibilities of the product.

40|$|Transparent {{building}} {{appeals to}} imagination. The availability of glass {{in all shapes}} and sizes is continuously increasing; architects and engineers thankfully make use of the given opportunities. But glass has also some specific disadvantages, as it’s extreme brittleness. Luckily more materials are available that offer the desired transparency; transparent plastics might be a promising addition to the world of transparent building. The transparent plastics that are considered most suitable for building applications are Acrylic (PMMA) and polycarbonate (PC). In this research the behaviour of these transparent plastics is analysed and it is investigated whether and how the materials can be used in building structures, to further explore the dream of completely transparent buildings. Transparent plastics show some, for building materials, unusual characteristics, as thermoplastic and visco-elastic behaviour, special production techniques and a very low ratio between Young’s modulus and strength. This requires a different design approach. A case study is performed to get more feeling for the design with thermoplastics. To be able to use the <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>shape</b> and to explore the limits of the materials an observation tower is designed. An entirely transparent tower, made completely from transparent plastics. The design demonstrates that it is technically possible to design building structures in acrylic and polycarbonate. Transparent plastics offer promising possibilities for building design but still a lot will have to be investigated further before they can really be used for load bearing structures. For instance the development of standard details, the investigation of fire safety, the buckling behaviour of plastics and the long-term behaviour for a design life over 20 years, which is now the limit by a lack of data,. This will be a trajectory of years but other materials have come that long road before. Once the plastics industry recognises the opportunities of investing in this new product market the development of suitable building products, details and optimal material compositions will certainly progress faster. Transparent plastics will probably never become a threatening substitute for standard glazing applications, but they have the ability to become a worthy colleague to glass in the future and an interesting addition to the world of transparent building.

40|$|In many {{applications}} increasing demands on weight and cost saving require {{the application of}} new materials. In this regard austempered ductile iron (ADI) offers a high potential. Cast iron materials exhibit a high <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>shape</b> combined with rather low manufacturing costs. In addition, ADI offers an excellent combination of high strength, high toughness and a good wear resistance. The fabrication of ADI-parts consists of a casting process and a following special heat treatment. Depending on the heat treatment parameters high strength and wear resistant or high ductile grades can be developed. Current developments focus on high-performance applications of transmission and chassis components. For these applications the ductile ADI-grades ADI- 800 to ADI- 1000 represent an ideal group of materials. However, high accuracy demands require basically a machining in a heat treaded condition. The demands on machinability and particularly on tool life are high. Preliminary investigations showed that the machinability of ductile ADI {{does not meet the}} required demands. Both compared to conventional ductile iron materials and to steels of similar strength a clearly lower tool life is attained based. An extreme crater wear is a characteristic tool wear phenomenon when machining ductile ADI with coated tungsten carbides. This crater wear is located very close to the cutting edge and leads to a destabilisation of the crater lip. Furthermore, a high dynamic cutting force load is present due to a heavily segmented chip formation. Due to the wear characteristics observed in the preliminary investigations the material-dependent influences of ADI on the cutting process were fundamentally examined in this work. Key investigations were the analysis of the special austenitic-ferritic microstructure regarding potential wear mechanisms as well as a detailed study of the segmented chip formation and the subsequent loads in the contact zones of the cutting edge. Depending on the following conclusions the fundamental processes in the cutting zones and its phenomena were clarified. The unusual wear mechanisms are due to the special austenitic-ferritic microstructure of ADI. This microstructure consists of a fine structure of ferrite and high-carbon austenite. The austenite can transform into martensite during a plastic deformation. The consequence is a very strong strain hardening. This effect is observed during the chip formation and leads to a very high specific mechanical cutting edge load. A segmented chip formation is characteristic when cutting ductile iron. The tendency to a segmented chip formation is much stronger when machining ADI. Rather low mean cutting forces are the consequence of this segmented chip formation, but also strong dynamic proportion of these cutting forces. In addition, the contact zone on the rake face becomes very small and moves close to the cutting edge. A further consequence of the segmented chip formation is the support of adhesive wear. The segmented chip formation occurs in a compression and a gliding phase. During the compression phase the material is pressed under high pressure on the rake face and generates a material bonding. During the gliding phase the chip segment and the adhesive bound is again worn away. Moreover, the austenitic-ferritic microstructure has a strong tendency to adhere with tungsten-based carbides. This adhesion wear strongly increases with increasing cutting speed and associated cutting temperature. Besides adhesive also abrasive wear effects are observed. This abrasive wear is caused by the hardness of the austenitic-ferritic microstructure and segregation-effected hardness fluctuations. The hardness of austenite is much higher compared to stainless steel due to the crystal structure changed by the high carbon content. Furthermore, the abrasive tool wear is affected by the quality of the casting structure. A main reason is the alloying with manganese or molybdenum. These alloying elements segregate to the grain boundaries and lead to the precipitation of martensite and carbides. For the development of cutting tools the respective causes of the wear phenomena must be considered. In this regard, an important role for the improvement of tool wear behaviour plays to the design of the cutting edge. It is important to find an optimal compromise between a sufficient stability and a good sharpness of the cutting edge. On the one hand breakages should be prevented {{and on the other hand}} the influence of the segmented chip formation on the adhesive wear phenomena should be reduced. The same applies to the selection of the cutting tool materials and coatings. An optimal cutting tool material should combine a high abrasive wear resistance and very good edge strength. On the one hand, the high dynamic cutting forces require a good coating adherence. On the other hand, the adhesive wear of the tungsten carbide substrate must be prevented...|$|E
