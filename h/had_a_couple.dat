5|$|He was {{promoted}} in July to the AA Wichita Wranglers of the Texas League, where in nine starts he was 4–3 with a 3.23 ERA. He <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of games where he struggled at Wichita {{and gave up}} a lot of runs. However, he bounced back and helped them make the playoffs with a victory in the final game of the season.|$|E
5|$|Despite the series' {{success on}} Fox Kids, Animaniacs on Kids' WB was only {{successful}} in an unintended way, bringing in adult viewers and viewers outside the Kids' WB target demographic of young children. This unintended result of adult viewers {{and not enough}} young viewers {{put pressure on the}} WB network from advertisers and caused dissatisfaction from the WB network towards Animaniacs. Slowly, orders from the WB for more Animaniacs episodes dwindled and Animaniacs <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> more short seasons, relying on leftover scripts and storyboards. The fourth season had eight episodes, which was reduced from 18 because of Warner Bros.' dissatisfaction with Animaniacs. The 99th and final Animaniacs episode was aired on November 14, 1998.|$|E
5|$|When {{creating}} {{the music for}} the film, Snow <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of months to write and produce the music, composing the television series simultaneously. The film {{marked the first time}} in the history of the franchise that music was composed and recorded with the help of an orchestra, although, according to Snow, there was no significant change in the recording and writing process during the production of the film. The most substantial difference was that Snow used MIDI files to save his musical scores and pieces, which would afterward be sent to a copyist who would take it through one of their programs and eventually give it to the orchestrators.|$|E

25|$|Leadbeater was a {{right-handed}} lower order batsman, and a leg-break and googly bowler, who <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of good {{seasons for}} Yorkshire in 1950 and 1951, {{but failed to}} keep {{his place in the}} side. He reappeared for Warwickshire County Cricket Club in 1957 and 1958, as a possible replacement for Eric Hollies, who retired after the 1957 season; but he failed to take enough wickets and his contract was not renewed.|$|E

25|$|The game nearly {{went against}} the Sooners. Oklahoma went three-and-out on their opening possession. On their next possession, Allen Patrick fumbled the ball, turning it over to Iowa State on Oklahoma's 20yard line. Iowa State {{converted}} for a touchdown taking the early lead. It was a defensive struggle {{for the rest of}} the first half with neither team scoring. Iowa State <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> chances to extend their lead, but the OU defense stood strong. The Cyclones missed a 36yard field goal and the Sooner's defense stopped Iowa State on a 4th down play.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, Raw Power bassist Stephen 'Tash' Reddihough {{got back}} in touch with Nick Paul after many {{intervening}} years, and together with Nick and Collectors drummer Adrian even <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of jams before realising a fresh new approach was needed. In 2005, Nick found an old reel to reel tape of a long lost Machines 'live demo' session from 1977, containing two songs: ‘Racing’ and ‘You Better Hear’. Dizzy of Detour / Bin Line Records wanted to release the tracks on a forthcoming edition of his punk rarities series, Bored Teenagers.|$|E
25|$|While never a noted {{industrial}} suburb, Ashfield has <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> {{of significant}} industries. On Parramatta Rd near Frederick St was the Australian Six motor car factory {{which opened in}} 1920. The site later became an AWA factory producing radio valves and other components. The site has since {{been turned into a}} commercial and residential development. On the other side of Frederick St was the Peek Freans biscuit factory, the tower of which was (and still is) a familiar site to passing motorists on Parramatta Rd. However, this factory is also no longer industrial, serving today as a large hardware store.|$|E

25|$|As the Batman {{films were}} {{handed over to}} {{director}} Joel Schumacher from Tim Burton, the design for the Batmobile updated. Decorative lighting {{was added to the}} vehicle's rims, sides and front edge, and the wing-shaped fins reached further into the air. The car <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of unique features, such as: being able to rotate its wheels through 90 degrees so that it could move in a perpendicular direction; a grappling hook allowing the Batmobile to drive up walls; the speed to perform large jumps from surface to surface during chases across Gotham City's elevated freeways and gigantic statues.|$|E
25|$|The {{reverse of}} the badge has three variations, the badge could either be hollow backed, flat, or semi-dished. The {{hollowed}} backed variation showed {{the imprint of}} the obverse, while the flat was just solid. The semi-dished version has a slight indent that shows part of {{the outline of the}} tank. The badge was attached to the uniform via a pin and catch, which were affixed to the reverse and <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of variations. There was the conventional soldering of a small rectangular medal bar, as well as the more rare type in which a circular ball hinge was inserted into the body of the badge.|$|E
25|$|He {{made the}} short journey to Gloucestershire for 1997, but again had a {{frustrating}} time, {{spending most of}} the season in the seconds and playing only four first-team games all season. In those he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of useful innings - 53 and 49 against Pakistan A in a first-class and one-day tour match respectively - {{but for the most part}} he had to content himself with piling up the runs in the Second XI, for whom he hit three hundreds. 1998 was only slightly better, and though he picked up the man-of-the-match award for an unbeaten 64 against Hampshire he managed very little else above second-team level.|$|E

25|$|The {{influence}} of Johannes Vermeer on Metsu is unmistakable: {{the light from}} the left, the marble floor. (A. Waiboer, however, suggests that Metsu requires more emotional involvement of the viewer.) Vermeer probably competed also with Nicolaes Maes, who produced genre works in a similar style. In 1662, Vermeer was elected head of the guild and was reelected in 1663, 1670, and 1671, evidence that he (like Bramer) was considered an established craftsman among his peers. Vermeer worked slowly, probably producing three paintings a year on order. Balthasar de Monconys visited him in 1663 to see some of his work, but Vermeer had no paintings to show. The diplomat and the two French clergymen who accompanied him were sent to Hendrick van Buyten, a baker who <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of his paintings as collateral.|$|E
25|$|Cole has <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> {{of minor}} brushes with the police. On 4 March 2009 {{he was held}} after {{swearing}} {{in front of a}} police officer outside a South Kensington nightclub. He was taken to a police station and issued with an £80 Fixed Penalty Notice before being released. On 4 January 2010, Cole was convicted of a speeding offence committed on 17 November 2009. He was recorded exceeding the speed limit by doing 104mph in a 50mph zone on the A3 road in Kingston upon Thames, a residential stretch. His defence at Kingston Magistrates Court, opposing the charge in his absence, argued unsuccessfully that the police speed gun was faulty. Cole also claimed that his actions were excuseable because he was trying to evade the paparazzi. On 29 January he was fined £1000 and disqualified from driving for four months.|$|E
25|$|The 12-inch/40 calibre Canon de 305 mm Modèle 1893/96 gun was {{a typical}} {{built-up}} French heavy gun of its period. It used a Welin interrupted-screw breech and bagged propellant with a de Bange obturator {{to get a good}} gas seal during firing. It was mounted in twin-gun turrets which <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of unusual features. First, most of the turret's operating machinery was housed inside the turret, with only an armored tube to protect the ammunition hoists. This made little difference in the overall weight of the turret, but did raise the machinery higher in the ship than the turrets of other nations, which did have implications for stability. Secondly, they used a hydraulic pivot to lift the turret when it rotated; this was lowered onto a seating ring when the turret was in the proper position to fire. Each turret had a nominal 300° of traverse, although each ship had its own specific limitations.|$|E
