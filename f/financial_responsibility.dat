5|$|In 1875, the {{partially}} constructed railway was {{sold at a}} sheriff's sale after the Pennsylvania Railroad, the Latrobe terminus of the line, declined to assume <b>financial</b> <b>responsibility.</b> Thomas Mellon, a retired Court of Common Pleas judge from Allegheny County, purchased the Ligonier Valley Railroad at auction. Mellon had founded the T. Mellon and Sons Bank, and was invested in coal, steel, oil, glassmaking, and other railroad ventures. In an effort to attract passengers, Mellon decided to offer recreational grounds along the route.|$|E
5|$|On 1 August 1883 the New South Wales {{government}} made a proclamation which transferred {{control of the}} Technical and Working Men's College to an independent Board of Technical Education, to which Selfe was appointed, and assumed <b>financial</b> <b>responsibility</b> directly. The government also provided funds to fit out workshops in Kent Street that opened in 1886. This was an initiative driven by Selfe, who had admired the workshop teaching model abroad. It represented a major innovation in technical education in New South Wales.|$|E

5|$|Some {{observers}} consider Millennium Park {{to be the}} city's {{most important}} project since the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893. It far exceeded its originally proposed budget of $150million. The final cost of $475million was borne by Chicago taxpayers and private donors. The city paid $270million; private donors paid the rest, and assumed roughly half of the <b>financial</b> <b>responsibility</b> for the cost overruns. The construction delays and cost overruns were attributed to poor planning, many design changes, and cronyism. Many critics have praised the completed park.|$|E
5|$|When Charles II {{returned}} to the throne in 1660, he demobilised most of the existing army and the following year the garrison at Yarmouth was given four days notice to leave the castle. The King announced that the castle's artillery {{would be sent to}} Cowes, unless the town of Yarmouth agreed to take over the <b>financial</b> <b>responsibility</b> of running the site themselves. The town declined to do so, but Charles repeated the offer in 1666; this time Yarmouth seems to have taken action, appointing four soldiers for a garrison, although the town did not assign an officer to command them, or apparently make any repairs to the now dilapidated castle.|$|E

5|$|In 1894, {{while serving}} as torpedo officer on the depot ship , Scott learned of the {{financial}} calamity that had overtaken his family. John Scott, having sold the brewery and invested the proceeds unwisely, had lost all his capital and was now virtually bankrupt. At the age of 63, and in poor health, {{he was forced to}} take a job as a brewery manager and move his family to Shepton Mallet, Somerset. Three years later, while Robert was serving with the Channel squadron flagship , John Scott died of heart disease, creating a fresh family crisis. Hannah Scott and her two unmarried daughters now relied entirely on the service pay of Scott and the salary of younger brother Archie, who had left the army for a higher-paid post in the colonial service. Archie's own death in the autumn of 1898, after contracting typhoid fever, meant that the whole <b>financial</b> <b>responsibility</b> for the family rested on Scott.|$|E
5|$|The city {{expanded}} police protection, even temporarily having volunteer {{police officers}} to assist the three paid officers. Fire protection was expanded in 1882, with the city's first 13 paid firefighters. Former mayor Henry Vollmer accomplished several public works achievements, including large street paving and new sub-divisions being plotted. A large city budget surplus brought {{the creation of the}} Davenport City Hall. After 1900, each mayor brought new agendas for city improvement. Waldo Becker encouraged new railroads for the city. He also promised a more business-like government, in terms of <b>financial</b> <b>responsibility</b> and to depoliticize the police department. In the mid-1920s the city established the first zoning ordinances, electrical traffic signals and street lighting. The city also expanded with the incorporation of the city of Rockingham and the establishment of the Davenport Municipal Airport.|$|E
5|$|Waters {{followed}} Roman Candles {{with a third}} short film, Eat Your Makeup (1968), {{in which}} Divine once more wore drag, this time to portray a fictionalized version of Jackie Kennedy, the widow of recently assassinated U.S. President John F. Kennedy. In the film, she turns to kidnapping models and forcing them to eat their own makeup. Divine kept his involvement with Waters and these early underground films a secret from his conservative parents, believing {{that they would not}} understand them or the reason for his involvement in such controversial and bad-taste films; they would not find out about them for many years. Divine's parents had bought him his own beauty shop in Towson, hoping that the <b>financial</b> <b>responsibility</b> would help him to settle down in life and stop spending so extravagantly. While agreeing to work there, he refused to be involved in owning and managing the establishment, leaving that to his mother. Not long after, in the summer of 1968, he moved out of his parental home, renting his own apartment.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the sharing of household chores, certain cultures expect adolescents to share in their family's <b>financial</b> <b>responsibilities.</b> According to family economic and financial education specialists, adolescents develop sound money management skills through the practices of saving and spending money, {{as well as through}} planning ahead for future economic goals. Differences between families in the distribution of <b>financial</b> <b>responsibilities</b> or provision of allowance may reflect various social background circumstances and intrafamilial processes, which are further influenced by cultural norms and values, {{as well as by the}} business sector and market economy of a given society. For instance, in many developing countries it is common for children to attend fewer years of formal schooling so that, when they reach adolescence, they can begin working.|$|R
40|$|The {{investigation}} of job insecurity {{has been a}} growing field of research. However, {{little is known about}} the strategies employees adopt to reduce job insecurity. Former research has shown that employees who perceive high job insecurity tend to engage in voluntary turnover. Yet, we do not know whether such a strategy is successful in reducing perceived job insecurity. Based on the Swiss Household Panel (SHP), a general population survey in Switzerland, a propensity score matching procedure is applied to investigate whether voluntary turnover successfully reduces feelings of job insecurity for employees who previously perceived an above-average level of job insecurity. Assuming that individual and family conditions are important factors explaining the success of this strategy it is distinguished between men and women with high, equally shared, or low <b>financial</b> <b>responsibilities</b> and of different age and educational groups. The results show that voluntary turnover indeed reduces perceived job insecurity. Whereas the individual factors do not moderate this relationship, the level of <b>financial</b> <b>responsibilities</b> does: employees who equally share <b>financial</b> <b>responsibilities</b> with their partners are most successful in reducing perceived job insecurity through voluntary turnover. The use of a propensity score matching procedure has proven fruitful as the bias caused by differing pre-turnover characteristics can be reduced considerably...|$|R
