40|$|Abstract. House <b>dust</b> <b>mites</b> {{have lived}} in human contact from time immemorial. Human dander or dead skin {{constitutes}} the major organic component of the house dust ecosystem. Because the mites feed on dander, <b>dust</b> <b>mites</b> and human association will continue to co-exist {{as part of our}} environment. Efficient house-keeping practice is the best form of control to reduce infestation. However, special precautions are important when individuals are susceptible or sensitive to <b>dust</b> <b>mites.</b> House <b>dust</b> <b>mites</b> are responsible for causing asthma, rhinitis and contact dermatitis. The respiratory allergies are caused by the inhalation of dead or live mites, their faecal matter or other byproducts. Immune factors are of paramount importance in the development of <b>dust</b> related or <b>mite</b> induced respiratory diseases. House <b>dust</b> <b>mites</b> were found in some 1, 000 samples of dust taken from approximately 330 dwellings in Peninsular Malaysia and Singapore. Mattresses, carpets, corners of a bedroom, and floor beneath the bed are favourable <b>dust</b> <b>mite</b> habitats. The incriminating species based on studies here and elsewhere, as well as many other species of <b>dust</b> <b>mites</b> of unknown etiological importance are widely distributed in Malaysian homes. Density of <b>dust</b> <b>mites</b> in Malaysia and Singapore is greater than in temperate countries. Prevention and control measures with reference to subjects sensitive to <b>dust</b> <b>mite</b> <b>allergies,</b> including chemical control described in studies conducted in Europe and America are discussed. However, a cost free and most practical way to remove mites, their faecal matter and other products is to resort to sunning the bedding and carpets to kill the living mites, and then beaten and brushed to remove the dust and other components...|$|R
40|$|The {{last year}} has seen great {{progress}} {{in the understanding of}} upper airway disease and in its management. For allergic rhinitis, authors focused on the prediction of and effect on the natural course of disease. New evidence was published for the disease-modifying effect of allergen immunotherapy in terms of avoidance of new sensitizations and prevention of asthma in either randomized or real-life studies. Specifically, for patients with house <b>dust</b> <b>mite</b> <b>allergies,</b> which are often underestimated and difficult to diagnose, the efficacy of SQ house <b>dust</b> <b>mite</b> sublingual immunotherapy tablets has been demonstrated in patients with allergic rhinitis and asthma. For the first time, allergen immunotherapy significantly reduced asthma exacerbations. In patients with chronic rhinosinusitis, a novel endotyping approach purely based on T helper cell biomarkers has been developed and has shown clinical relevance through associations with asthma comorbidity and recurrence after surgery. Severe nasal polyposis with high risk for asthma comorbidity and disease recurrence is characterized by type 2 inflammatory patterns, including IgE antibodies to staphylococcal superantigens; several studies using biologic agents have targeted exactly this spectrum of mediators. This goes in parallel with new knowledge on even more type 2 mediators derived from epithelial cells, which will expand the number of possible candidates for innovative intervention...|$|R
40|$|House dust mites (HDM) {{represent}} {{a major source}} of allergens, contributing to the increasing incidence of type I hypersensitivity disease worldwide. Over 30 different IgE-binding proteins from the HDM extract were detected. Although group 1 and 2 have been identified as major allergens, due to the safety and efficacy of allergy diagnosis and immunotherapy, {{there is a need to}} carefully evaluate the clinical relevance of other allergens present in the HDM extract. In regard to this, a high molecular mass allergen of about 68 kD was purified from the HDM extract using a combination of gel permeation chromatography and reversed-phase chromatography. The IgG and IgE reactivity of the purified protein were preserved during the purification process, as confirmed by Western blot analysis with polyclonal rabbit antibodies and dot blot analysis with a pool of sera from subjects with house <b>dust</b> <b>mite</b> <b>allergy,</b> respectively.

In contrast, ProDer p 1 adjuvanted with alum induced typical strictly Th 2 -biased allergic responses with strong IgG 1 and IgE titers and IL- 5 secretion. Removal of negatively charged sialic acids in ProDer p 1 or increasing the ionic strength reduced the binding of ProDer p 1 to the cationic liposomes and resulted in a decrease of the allergen immunogenicity, suggesting that complexation is required for triggering an optimal immune response. Finally, prophylactic vaccination with ProDer p 1 -diC 14 -amidine reduced drastically the production of specific IgE and airway eosinophilia following subsequent immunization with Der p 1 -alum and challenge with aerosolized house dust mite extracts.

40|$|Background: For {{respiratory}} allergic {{disorders in}} children, sublingual immunotherapy {{has been developed}} {{as an alternative to}} subcutaneous immunotherapy. Sublingual immunotherapy is more convenient, has a good safety profile and might be an attractive option for use in primary care. A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study was designed to establish the efficacy of sublingual immunotherapy with house dust mite allergen compared to placebo treatment in 6 to 18 -year-old children with allergic rhinitis and a proven house <b>dust</b> <b>mite</b> <b>allergy</b> in primary care. Described here are the methodology, recruitment phases, and main characteristics of the recruited children. Methods: Recruitment took place in September to December of 2005 and 2006. General practitioners (in south-west Netherlands) selected children who had ever been diagnosed with allergic rhinitis. Children and parents could respond to a postal invitation. Children who responded positively were screened by telephone using a nasal symptom score. After this screening, an inclusion visit took place during which a blood sample was taken for the RAST test. Results: A total of 226 general practitioners invited almost 6000 children: of these, 51 % was male and 40 % < 12 years of age. The target sample size was 256 children; 251 patients were finally included. The most frequent reasons given for not participating were: absence or mildness of symptoms, absence of house <b>dust</b> <b>mite</b> <b>allergy,</b> and being allergic to grass pollen or tree pollen only. Asthma symptoms were reported by 37 % of the children. Of the enrolled children, 71 % was sensitized to both house dust mite and grass pollen. Roughly similar proportions of children were diagnosed as being sensitized to one, two, three or four common inhalant allergens. Conclusion: Our study was designed in accordance with recent recommendations for research on establishing the efficacy of sublingual immunotherapy; 98 % of the target sample size was achieved. This study is expected to provide useful information on sublingual immunotherapy with house dust mite allergen in primary care.

40|$|C 8 / 119 S is a mutant of {{recombinant}} Der f 2 (rDer f 2), and lacks a {{disulphide bond}} possessed by wild-type rDer f 2.

C 8 / 119 S may thus be a safe immunotherapeutic agent for house <b>dust</b> <b>mite</b> <b>allergy.</b> The aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate whether the intranasal administration of C 8 / 119 S could suppress an immediate allergic reaction in mice sensitized with wild-type rDer f 2, possessing an allergic activity comparable to native counterparts purified from mite extract. Seven-week-old male A/J mice were immunized with wild-type rDer f 2 four times, and then intranasally administered 0. 2 – 2 μg of wild-type, 0. 2 – 20 μg of C 8 / 119 S, or PBS alone, three times a week for 4 weeks. Seven days after the last administration, the mice were examined for an immediate allergic reaction. The animals administered 2 μg of C 8 / 119 S (C 2. 0 group) showed significantly reduced immediate bronchoconstriction provoked by the i. v. injection of 1 and 10 μg of wild-type rDer f 2, compared with the PBS-treated mice. Similar results were obtained when we examined mice 10 weeks after the last administration. The reactions in the other groups given wild-type or C 8 / 119 S also tended to decrease in severity in comparison with the animals of the PBS group. The allergic phenotypes of the T cells, B cells, and basophils in the C 2. 0 group were shifted to that of naive mice without immunization. We conclude that C 8 / 119 S has hyposensitizing activities in mice sensitized with wild-type rDer f 2. C 8 / 119 S may be useful for immunotherapy of house <b>dust</b> <b>mite</b> <b>allergy...</b>|$|E
50|$|Antihistamines are drugs which treat {{allergic}} rhinitis and other allergies. Antihistamines can give relief {{when a person}} has nasal congestion, sneezing, or hives because of pollen, <b>dust</b> <b>mites,</b> or animal <b>allergy.</b> Typically people take antihistamines as an inexpensive, generic, over-the-counter drug with few side effects. As an alternative to taking an antihistamine, {{people who suffer from}} allergies can instead avoid the substance which irritates them. Antihistamines are usually for short-term treatment. Chronic allergies increase the risk of health problems which antihistamines might not treat, including asthma, sinusitis, and lower respiratory tract infection. Doctors recommend that people talk to them before any longer term use of antihistamines.|$|R
40|$|Mast {{cells are}} implicated in {{allergic}} and innate immune responses in asthma, although {{their role in}} models using an allergen relevant for human disease is incompletely understood. House <b>dust</b> <b>mite</b> (HDM) <b>allergy</b> is common in asthma patients. Our aim {{was to investigate the}} role of mast cells in HDM-induced allergic lung inflammation. Wild-type (Wt) and mast cell-deficient Kit(w-sh) mice on a C 57 BL/ 6 background were repetitively exposed to HDM via the airways. HDM challenge resulted in a rise in tryptase activity in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of Wt mice, indicative of mast cell activation. Kit(w-sh) mice showed a strongly attenuated HDM- induced recruitment of eosinophils in BALF and lung tissue, accompanied by reduced pulmonary levels of the eosinophil chemoattractant eotaxin. Remarkably, Kit(w-sh) mice demonstrated an unaltered capacity to develop lung pathology and increased mucus production in response to HDM. The increased plasma IgE in response to HDM in Wt mice was absent in Kit(w-sh) mice. These data contrast with previous reports on the role of mast cells in models using ovalbumin as allergen in that C 57 BL/ 6 Kit(w-sh) mice display a selective impairment of eosinophil recruitment without differences in other features of allergic inflammatio...|$|R
40|$|House <b>dust</b> <b>mites</b> are {{microscopic}} arthropods {{that can}} trigger moderate allergic {{symptoms such as}} sneezing, watery eyes, itching, and wheezing in sensitized individuals. People with more serious <b>allergies</b> to house <b>dust</b> <b>mites</b> can develop allergic diseases like atopic dermatitis and asthma. The effects of house <b>dust</b> <b>mites</b> on <b>allergy</b> sufferers make house <b>dust</b> <b>mites</b> {{and the study of}} their effects on the human body of great medical and economic importance. A majority of the research that has been done on house <b>dust</b> <b>mite</b> 2 ̆ 7 s effects on humans has dealt with the lungs and relevant disease like asthma. Little work has been done on the inflammatory response of the skin to the house <b>dust</b> <b>mite.</b> Since the human microvascular dermal endothelial cell(HMVEC-d) is a major regulator in the inflammatory response of the skin, my research attempted to look at the in vitro effects of house <b>dust</b> <b>mite</b> extract on the expression of inflammatory molecules that are important in inflammatory cell trafficking and activation. HMVEC-d were exposed to extracts of the two most common house <b>dust</b> <b>mite</b> species Dermatophagoides farinae and Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus at four different concentrations. The expression level of the cytokines IL- 1 alpha, IL- 1 beta, IL- 6, macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha (MIP- 1 alpha), granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and eotaxin, as well as the chemokines IL- 8 and macrophage chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP- 1) were analyzed using a sandwich ELISA technique. The expression level of the chemokine receptors CXCR- 1, CXCR- 2, and CCR- 5, and the adhesion molecules intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM- 1), vascular cellular adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM- 1), and E-selectin were analyzed using the indirect ELISA technique. Expression of all of the molecules was determined at 12 hours and 24 hours post exposure to house <b>dust</b> <b>mite</b> extract. The effects of house <b>dust</b> <b>mite</b> extract on dermal endothelial cells after stimulation with TNF-alpha was also tested. The results showed an extensive upregulation in the expression of several of the molecules that were tested for. The adhesion molecule ICAM- 1 had a significant dose dependent increase in expression but the adhesion molecules VCAM- 1 and E-selectin showed a much smaller yet still significant dose dependent increase in expression. The cytokines and chemokines IL- 6, GM-CSF, IL- 8, and MCP- 1 all showed a significant dose dependent increase in expression by the HMVEC-d. The chemokine receptors were unaffected by the extract and the cytokines IL- 1 alpha, IL- 1 beta, MIP- 1 alpha, and eotaxin were not detected. The results clearly show that the two species of house <b>dust</b> <b>mite</b> extracts caused an increase in the expression level of several specific inflammatory molecules by HMVEC-d. The variation in the effects that the two species of house <b>dust</b> <b>mites</b> had on HMVEC-d indicates that the uncharacterized non-allergic components of the two extracts may also {{play a role in the}} activation of the allergic response of the skin...|$|R
