25|$|In 1946, 10 and 100 <b>forint</b> {{notes were}} {{introduced}} by the Magyar Nemzeti Bank (Hungarian National Bank). A new series of higher quality banknotes (in denominations of 10-, 20 and 100 <b>forint)</b> were introduced in 1947 and 1948. 50 <b>forint</b> notes were added in 1953, 500 <b>forint</b> notes were introduced in 1970, followed by 1000 <b>forint</b> in 1983, and 5000 <b>forint</b> in 1991.|$|E
25|$|Silver 200 <b>forint</b> coins were {{withdrawn}} in 1998 (as their {{nominal value}} was too {{low compared to}} their precious metal content); the 1 and 2 <b>forint</b> coins remained in circulation until 29 February 2008. For cash purchases, the total price is now rounded to the nearest 5 <b>forint</b> (to 0 or to 5). A new 200 <b>forint</b> coin made of base metal alloy was introduced {{in place of the}} 200 <b>forint</b> bank note on 15 June 2009.|$|E
25|$|Forgery of <b>forint</b> {{banknotes}} is not significant. However, forged 20,000 <b>forint</b> notes {{printed on}} the paper of 2000 <b>forint</b> notes after dissolving the original ink might come up and {{are not easy to}} recognize. Another denomination preferred by counterfeiters was the 1000 <b>forint</b> note until improved security features were added in 2006.|$|E

50|$|Áll az alku (It's a deal) is the Hungarian {{version of}} Deal or No Deal, {{originally}} {{created by a}} Dutch company. The show airs on TV2, and the host was Gábor Gundel Takács. There are 21 cases used in the format, with a top prize of 50,000,000 <b>forints</b> offered originally and increased to 100,000,000 <b>forints</b> on October 2, 2006 but reduced to 21,000,000 <b>forints</b> in 2009.|$|R
50|$|The bar is best kept {{refrigerated}} around 4 C. The regular 30-gram {{bar and the}} óriás bar usually retail {{for about}} 95 Hungarian <b>forints</b> (about 30 euro cents) and 140 Hungarian <b>forints</b> (about 45 euro-cents), respectively.|$|R
25|$|In 1946, coins were {{introduced}} in denominations of 2, 10, 20 fillérs and 1, 2, 5 forints. The silver 5 <b>forint</b> was reissued only in the next year, later it was withdrawn from circulation. 5 and 50 fillérs coins were issued in 1948. In 1967, a 5 <b>forint</b> coin was reintroduced, followed by a 10 <b>forint</b> in 1971 and 20 <b>forint</b> in 1982.|$|E
25|$|Commemorative {{banknotes}} {{have also}} been issued recently: 1000 and 2000 <b>forint</b> notes to commemorate the millennium (in 2000) and a 500 <b>forint</b> note to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the 1956 revolution (in 2006).|$|E
25|$|In 1992, a {{new series}} of coins was {{introduced}} in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 and (a somewhat different, 500‰ silver) 200 <b>forint.</b> Production of the 2 and 5 fillér coins ceased in 1992, with all fillér coins withdrawn from circulation by 1999. From 1996, a bicolor 100 <b>forint</b> coin was minted to replace the 1992 version, since the latter was considered too big and ugly, and could be easily mistaken for the 20 <b>forint</b> coin.|$|E
50|$|In Hungary, {{the game}} is usually played with real bets, but because the {{smallest}} value coin is 5 <b>forints,</b> {{the game is}} played with a unit of 10 <b>forints</b> per point. In this case, points are not kept on paper, instead, money is paid after each game.|$|R

50|$|In February 2012, Zsiga made {{controversial}} {{comments about}} salaries {{of public works}} program. In response to a question, Zsiga said {{it is possible to}} live off 47,000 <b>forints</b> (c. € 162) per month. According to the opposition critics, the Orbán cabinet has reduced the salary from 60,200 <b>forints</b> before that.|$|R
25|$|The <b>forint</b> (sign: Ft; code: HUF) is the {{currency}} of Hungary. It was formerly divided into 100 fillér, but fillér coins {{are no longer in}} circulation. The introduction of the <b>forint</b> on 1 August 1946 was a crucial step in the post-World War II stabilization of the Hungarian economy, and {{the currency}} remained relatively stable until the 1980s. Transition to a market economy in the early 1990s adversely affected the value of the forint; inflation peaked at 35% in 1991. Since 2001, inflation is in single digits, and the <b>forint</b> has been declared fully convertible. As a member of the European Union, the long -term aim of the Hungarian government may be to replace the <b>forint</b> with the euro, but that {{does not appear to be}} likely until some time during the 2020s.|$|E
25|$|After its 1946 introduction, the <b>forint</b> {{remained}} stable for several years, but started {{to lose its}} purchasing power as the state-socialist economic system (Planned economy) lost its competitiveness during the 1970s and 1980s. After the democratic change of 1989–90, the <b>forint</b> saw yearly inflation figures of about 35% for three years, but significant market economy reforms helped stabilize it.|$|E
25|$|Historically the <b>forint</b> was {{subdivided}} into 100 fillér (comparable to a penny), although fillér coins have been rendered useless by inflation {{and have not}} been in circulation since 1999. (Since 2000, one <b>forint</b> has typically been worth about half a US cent or slightly less.) The Hungarian abbreviation for <b>forint</b> is Ft, which is written after the number with a space between. The name fillér, the subdivision of all Hungarian currencies since 1925, comes from the German word Heller. The abbreviation for the fillér was f, also written after the number with a space in between.|$|E

25|$|The Hungarian participle pengő means 'ringing' (which in turn {{derives from}} the verb peng, an onomatopoeic word {{equivalent}} to English 'ring') and was used from the 1517th century to refer to silver coins making a ringing sound when struck on a hard surface, thus indicating their precious metal content. (The onomatopoeic word used for gold coins is csengő, an equivalent of English 'clinking' meaning a sharper sound; the participle used for copper coins is kongó meaning a deep pealing sound.) After the introduction of <b>forint</b> paper money in Hungary, the term pengő <b>forint</b> was {{used to refer to}} <b>forint</b> coins literally meaning 'ringing forint', figuratively meaning 'silver forint' or 'hard currency'.|$|E
25|$|The {{enormous}} amount of paper consumed during {{the production of the}} inflation pengő notes caused a shortage of good quality security paper; this hindered the production of <b>forint</b> banknotes.|$|E
25|$|Between 1868 and 1892 the <b>forint</b> was {{the name}} used in Hungarian for the {{currency}} of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, known in German as the gulden or florin. It was subdivided into 100 krajczár (krajcár in modern Hungarian orthography).|$|E
5000|$|Gábor Keglevich was the magister tavernicorum regalium (Treasurer (Kingdom of Hungary)) 1842-1848. He {{and some}} others founded in 1845 a {{financing}} association to finance the Hungarian industry {{and to protect the}} loan repayments. The share capital amounted 100'000 <b>forints</b> and the establishing of the common shares were worth 960'000 <b>forints</b> {{at the beginning of this}} association in 1845.|$|R

25|$|A {{completely}} redesigned {{new series}} of banknotes in denominations of 200-, 500-, 1000-, 2000-, 5000-, 10,000 and 20,000 <b>forint</b> was introduced gradually between 1997 and 2001. Each banknote depicts a famous Hungarian leader or politician on the obverse and a place or event related {{to him on the}} reverse. All of the banknotes are watermarked, contain an embedded vertical security strip and are suitable for visually impaired people. The 1000 <b>forint</b> and higher denominations are protected by an interwoven holographic security strip. The notes share the common size of 154 × 70mm. The banknotes are printed by the Hungarian Banknote Printing Corp. in Budapest on paper manufactured by the Diósgyőr Papermill in Miskolc.|$|E
25|$|The forint's {{name comes}} {{from the city of}} Florence, where gold coins were minted from 1252 called fiorino d'oro. In Hungary, florentinus (later <b>forint),</b> also a gold-based currency, was used from 1325 under Charles Robert and several other {{countries}} followed its example.|$|E
25|$|After several earlier {{attempts}} the Austro-Hungarian Empire {{adopted the}} gold standard in 1892 according to a plan drawn up by Minister of Finance Sándor Wekerle. This plan included {{the introduction of the}} new currency, the Krone. It consisted of 100 Heller (Austria) or Fillér (Hungary). The value of the Krone was set at 2 Kronen = 1 Gulden (Florin, or <b>forint</b> in Hungarian) of the previous silver-based currency. From 1900 onward, Krone notes were the only legal banknotes of the Empire.|$|E

2500|$|The <b>forint</b> was reintroduced on 1 August 1946, {{after the}} pengő was {{rendered}} almost worthless by massive hyperinflation in 1945–46: the highest ever recorded. The process was {{managed by the}} Hungarian Communist Party, which held the relevant cabinet seats. The forint's success was exploited for political gains, contributing to the Communists' takeover of complete power in 1948–49. The <b>forint</b> replaced the pengő {{at the rate of}} 1 <b>forint</b> = 4 pengő—dropping 29 zeroes from the old currency. In fact, this was an imaginary exchange rate. With the highest value note being 100 million B. pengő (1020 pengő), the total amount of pengő in circulation had a value of less than 0.1 fillér. (The [...] "B" [...] stood for an old-style [...] "billion", i.e. a million million.) Of more significance was the exchange rate to the adópengő of 1 <b>forint</b> = 200 million adópengő.|$|E
2500|$|The Hungarian {{economy could}} only be {{stabilized}} {{by the introduction of}} a new currency, and therefore, on 1 August 1946, the <b>forint</b> was reintroduced at a rate of 400000000000000000000000000000 (400 octillion) = 4 pengő, dropping 29 zeros from the old currency. [...] In effect, the total amount of circulating pengő notes had a value of less than 0.1 fillér ( [...] <b>forint).</b> [...] A more realistic comparison was the exchange rate with the [...] adópengő, which was set at 200000000 = 2 (hence the 2 ratio, mentioned above). The exchange rate for the gold was set at 13.21 <b>forint</b> per gram.|$|E

Now they have 167 buses (75 Ikarus and 88 Mercedes). In 2009 PK Zrt sold all of their buses for 2.2 billion <b>Forints</b> and started to rent them for 2.1 billion <b>Forints</b> annually. In 2012 the court gave back the buses to PK Zrt because of misappropriation.|$|R

On November 28, 2003 an almost intact copy was sold at a Budapest auction for 12 million <b>forints</b> (53,571 USD), {{although}} experts assessed its value at 25-30 million forints; on another auction in London it reached that price in 2001. In May 2008 an Old Testament in good condition was auctioned for 2,2 million <b>forints.</b> In 1981, 28,000 copies of the Bible were reprinted.|$|R
50|$|The film's plot {{is based}} on a story that {{director}} Kristóf Deák heard from a Swedish friend. The first screenplay was written in 2012, and the story was originally set in an English-language environment instead of Hungary. In 2014 Deák rewrote the screenplay and received a funding of 8,000,000 <b>forints</b> from the National Media and Communications Authority (the highest amount that can be awarded for short and experimental films). An additional 2,000,000 <b>forints</b> came from the state, the filmmakers and the film studio.|$|R
