5|$|During {{the nineteenth}} century, The Fairchild Family was {{renowned for its}} {{realistic}} portrayal of childhood and its humor, but Sherwood's book fell from favor as Britain became increasingly secularized and new fashions in children's literature came to dominate the literary scene, represented by works such as Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures <b>in</b> <b>Wonderland.</b> In the twentieth century the books have most often been viewed as quintessential examples of the didactic style of children's writing popular before Alice.|$|E

5|$|Since Juster did {{the cooking}} for the housemates, if Feiffer wanted to eat, {{he had to}} do the drawings. Feiffer quickly {{realized}} the book would require illustrations of the type and quality that John Tenniel had created for Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures <b>in</b> <b>Wonderland</b> and although a nationally-known artist, doubted his competence to do the text justice. Feiffer considers the double-spread illustration of demons late in the book to be a success and one of his favorites. It differs from his usual style (which would involve a white background), and instead uses Gustave Doré's drawings as an inspiration.|$|E
5|$|Sir John Tenniel drew {{a famous}} {{illustration}} of Alice meeting a caterpillar for Lewis Carroll's Alice <b>in</b> <b>Wonderland,</b> c. 1865.

Eric Carle's children's book The Very Hungry Caterpillar portrays the larva as an extraordinarily hungry animal, while also teaching children how to count (to five) and the days of the week.|$|E
