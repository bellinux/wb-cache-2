The objective lens is essentially a magnifying glass and was designed with a very small focal length while the eyepiece generally has a longer focal length. This {{has the effect of}} producing magnified images of close objects. Generally, an additional source of illumination is used since magnified images are dimmer due to the conservation of energy and the spreading of light rays over a larger surface area. Modern microscopes, known as compound microscopes have many lenses in them (typically four) to optimize the functionality and enhance <b>image</b> <b>stability.</b> A slightly different variety of microscope, the comparison microscope, looks at side-by-side images to produce a stereoscopic binocular view that appears three dimensional when used by humans.|$|E

Unlike classical image-based visual controllers, explicit feature correspondence (matching) to some desired set {{is not required}} before a control input is obtained.

5000|$|Toning {{refers to}} a variety of methods for {{altering}} the overall colour of the photographic image itself. Compounds of gold, platinum or other metals are used in combination with variations in development time, temperature and other factors to produce a range of tones, including warm browns, purples, sepias, blues, olives, red-browns and blue-blacks. A well-known type of toning is sepia tone. Besides adding colour to a monochromatic print, toning often improves <b>image</b> <b>stability</b> and increases contrast.|$|E
50|$|When LCD {{shutter glasses}} {{are used for}} stereo 3D displays, the {{effective}} refresh rate is halved, because each eye needs a separate picture. For this reason, it is usually recommended to use a display capable of at least 120 Hz, because divided in half this rate is again 60 Hz. Higher refresh rates result in greater <b>image</b> <b>stability,</b> for example 72 Hz non-stereo is 144 Hz stereo, and 90 Hz non-stereo is 180 Hz stereo. Unfortunately most computer graphics cards and monitors cannot handle these high refresh rates, especially at higher resolutions.|$|E
50|$|Some {{binoculars}} use image-stabilization {{technology to}} reduce shake at higher magnifications. This {{is done by}} having a gyroscope move part of the instrument, or by powered mechanisms driven by gyroscopic or inertial detectors, or via a mount designed to oppose and damp the effect of shaking movements. Stabilization may be enabled or disabled by the user as required. These techniques allow binoculars up to 20× to be hand-held, and much improve the <b>image</b> <b>stability</b> of lower-power instruments. There are some disadvantages: the image may not be quite {{as good as the}} best unstabilized binoculars when tripod-mounted, stabilized binoculars also tend to be more expensive and heavier than similarly specified non-stabilised binoculars.|$|E

5000|$|The {{ratio of}} the focal length of the {{eyepiece}} divided into the focal length of the objective gives the linear magnifying power of binoculars (sometimes expressed as [...] "diameters"). A magnification of factor 7, for example, produces an image 7 {{times larger than the}} original seen from that distance. The desirable amount of magnification depends upon the intended application, and in most binoculars is a permanent, non-adjustable feature of the device (zoom binoculars are the exception). Hand-held binoculars typically have magnifications ranging from 7x to 10x so they will be less susceptible to the effects of shaking hands. A larger magnification leads to a smaller field of view and may require a tripod for <b>image</b> <b>stability.</b> Some specialized binoculars for astronomy or military use have magnifications ranging from 15x to 25x.|$|E

40|$|Overall latency {{remains an}} {{impediment}} to perceived <b>image</b> <b>stability</b> and consequently to human performance in virtual environment (VE) systems. Predictive compensators have been proposed {{as a means to}} mitigate these shortcomings, but they introduce rendering errors because of induced motion overshoot and heightened noise. Discriminability of these compensator artifacts was investigated by a protocol in which head tracked <b>image</b> <b>stability</b> for 35 ms baseline VE system latency was compared against artificially added (16. 7 to 100 ms) latency compensated by a previously studied Kalman Filter (K-F) predictor. A control study in which uncompensated 16. 7 to 100 ms latencies were compared against the baseline was also performed. Results from 10 subjects in the main study and 8 in the control group indicate that predictive compensation artifacts are less discernible than the disruptions of uncompensated time delay for the shorter but not the longer added latencies. We propose that noise magnification and overshoot are contributory cues to the presence of predictive compensation...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The Vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) is {{quantified}} {{by computing}} {{the ratio of}} head angular velocity and eye angular velocity (VOR Gain). This measure only includes head angular movements; linear translations are not accounted for. These investigations postulate an alternative method of VOR quantification, one that assesses retinal <b>image</b> <b>stability</b> during head angular and linear movements (Foveal fixation (FF)). This method {{was used to assess}} the role of vision in balance reactions. Methods: Experiment 1 : Ten Young subjects were fitted with an eye tracker linked to an EM kinematic recording system. This allowed for the recording of head, trunk and eye kinematics during the performance of gaze stabilization tasks. Subjects fixated an LED target while performing head flexion and extension exercises at four frequencies. Point-of-gaze analysis was performed by transforming eye-in-head and head-in-space data into eye-in-space data, which were compared to the known location of the targets. The distance between the eye vector target plane intersection and the target location provided an error {{that could be used to}} calculate the estimated image location on the retina. FF and VOR gain were compared with head angular velocities to determine correlations. Experiment 2 : Balance was assessed in Young and Elderly following a series of perturbations. Dependent variables included: step latency, head and trunk angular velocity, VOR Gain, FF. Results: Correlations between head angular velocity and FF showed that retinal <b>image</b> <b>stability</b> degraded as head angular velocity increased. Elderly showed a more rapid degradation of FF with higher overall head angular velocities. Comparisons between rate of change of VOR and FF over velocity spectrum indicated a greater change in FF response. A negative linear correlation between FF and Step Latency was observed: there was no relationship between VOR gain and Step Latency. Conclusion: FF is a more sensitive measure of VOR than Gain as it accounts for angular and translational head movements. Its correlation with Step Latency suggests the importance of <b>image</b> <b>stability</b> in formulating responses following perturbation...|$|E
