5|$|In the 1770s and 1780s the {{discovery}} of copper at Parys Mountain in Anglesey which could be cheaply extracted by opencast mining led to a crash in the copper price, and expensive <b>deep</b> <b>mining</b> began to become unviable. As the copper boom came to an end, the mines began to close. In 1788 mining ceased at Dolcoath itself, although some bal maidens continued to be employed picking through the large quantities of ore which had already {{been brought to the}} surface.|$|E
5|$|MD36 {{passes through}} the Georges Creek Valley, which {{has a long history}} of coal mining. In {{recognition}} of this, the MDSHA has designated MD36 as part of the Coal Heritage Scenic Byway. Coal mining was a major industry in western Maryland in the 19th century, with railroads being the major route connecting the coal mines to markets outside the Georges Creek Valley. <b>Deep</b> <b>mining,</b> which was the primary mining method used in western Maryland, declined in use after World WarII, replaced primarily by surface mining. Although Maryland coal production is now only a small fraction of total U.S. coal production, coal from the Georges Creek Valley is used to power the AES Warrior Run power plant in Cumberland.|$|E

5|$|Mining in the creek's {{watershed}} {{began in}} 1844. A number of mining villages {{existed in the}} Tangascootack Creek watershed between 1845 and 1870. In the mid-1850s the Farrandsville Iron Company purchased large amounts of land in several places, including along Tangascootack Creek. In 1870 all of the mines in the area closed and lumbering became the area's most significant industry, with millions of board feet being floated downstream. The railroad tracks were removed and the mine buildings were abandoned or burned down. However, <b>deep</b> <b>mining</b> of the Clarion coal formation and the Lower Kittaning coal formation in the Tangascootack Creek watershed began in the 1800s and continued into the early 1900s. Strip mining operations began in the 1950s and 1960s, {{with some of the}} deep mines and surface mines being remined in the 1980s. The Independent Regulatory Review Commission issued a statement in the summer of 1987, saying that part of the North Fork Tangascootack Creek watershed was no longer suitable for surface mining. Treatment of the watershed began as early as 1998. Several projects devoted to improving the water quality of the creek had begun by 2001, by which point several more projects were planned. At least one of these projects involves the use of biosolids to encourage vegetation growth.|$|E
25|$|The main {{sources of}} calcium sulfate are {{naturally}} occurring gypsum and anhydrite, which occur at many locations worldwide as evaporites.

25|$|Although {{underground}} mining technology had {{been available for}} many centuries, {{it is likely that}} the joint problems of the hardness of the granite rock and the preponderance of underground water together with the relatively easy pickings from near the surface made <b>deep</b> <b>mining</b> unviable until the late 18th century.|$|E

On the basis of summarizing and analyzing previous heat-harm control technologies, and aiming at the usage of deep geo-thermal energy, HEMS-technology has been successfully developed. With the utilization of <b>deep</b> <b>mine</b> heat-harm as resources, ground coal-fired boiler has been replaced to achieve the mining area’s purpose of saving energy, protecting environment and sustainable developing, while solving <b>deep</b> <b>mine</b> heat-harm problems.|$|R
30|$|Ground {{temperature}} of geothermal field in <b>deep</b> <b>mines</b> gradually increases with the mining depth.

The Tamarack/C&H remained the world's <b>deepest</b> <b>mine</b> until about 1915, when its vertical depth of 5,500 feet was exceeded by the 5,824-foot depth of the Morro Velho gold mine in Brazil.|$|R
25|$|He also {{described}} <b>deep</b> <b>mining</b> underground, and mentions {{the need to}} dewater the workings using reverse overshot water-wheels, and actual examples {{have been found in}} many Roman mines exposed during later mining attempts. The copper mines at Rio Tinto were one source of such artifacts, where a set of 16 was found in the 1920s. They also used Archimedean screws to remove water in a similar way.|$|E
25|$|Most coal seams are {{too deep}} {{underground}} for opencast mining and require underground mining, {{a method that}} currently accounts for about 60 percent of world coal production. In <b>deep</b> <b>mining,</b> the room and pillar or bord and pillar method progresses along the seam, while pillars and timber are left standing to support the mine roof. Once room and pillar mines {{have been developed to}} a stopping point (limited by geology, ventilation, or economics), a supplementary version of room and pillar mining, termed second mining or retreat mining, is commonly started. Miners remove the coal in the pillars, thereby recovering as much coal from the coal seam as possible. A work area involved in pillar extraction is called a pillar section.|$|E
25|$|A {{housing crisis}} {{arose in the}} town {{at the end of}} the Second World War. New {{residential}} and private housing estates to the north-west, multi-storey flats and the redevelopment of areas such as Sinclairtown and Linktown occurred between the 1950s and 1960s. Several primary schools such as Valley, Fair Isle, Dunearn and Torbain were also built to serve these new estates (with Capshard being a latter addition in the early 1970s). Provision was given to new junior secondaries (Templehall and Balwearie); a new Catholic secondary (St Andrews) and the re-location of Kirkcaldy High School to Pathhead muir on the north side of the town. During the middle of the 1950s, construction began of a new hospital - on the site of the Fever hospital and sanatorium - to replace the cramped facilities of the cottage hospital situated to the east of the town. The late 1950s saw a new bus station open on a site north of the town centre to relieve the existing one on The Promenade (which continued to deal only with country routes until this was phased out in 1980). There was speculation that the town could grow around the 55,000 to 60,000 mark by 1970. This never materialised when the decline of linoleum in the mid-1960s - with the closure of the linoleum firm, Barry, Ostlere and Shepherd, shocking the town in particular - saw the population of the town fall. To try to combat this, <b>deep</b> <b>mining</b> was commissioned at Seafield in 1954 by the National Coal Board to help reduce the impact of job losses, it later closed in 1988, after a tug of war between the National Union of Mineworkers and the Conservative Government. Kirkcaldy harbour, which had once been vital to the town’s well being, suffered its own fate when it was closed permanently in 1992 to main traffic.|$|E
50|$|When the UK coal {{industry}} was privatised in 1994, Budge bought {{most of the}} pits for £815m, forming RJB Mining, which he had started in 1992 after buying his brother's opencast business division for £102.5m. This led to Budge being christened King Coal. He bought three out of five packages of the UK {{coal industry}} (17 <b>deep</b> <b>mine</b> pits) on 30 December 1994 for around £700m.

500|$|A newly {{emergent}} threat {{facing the}} golden-crowned sifaka is hunting by the gold miners {{moving into the}} region's forests. [...] Although mining operations are small scale, the practice of gold mining takes a toll on the forested regions because <b>deep</b> <b>mining</b> pits are often dug near or underneath large trees, disturbing the extensive root systems and ultimately killing {{the trees in the}} area. The influx of gold miners has also increased poaching pressure. Although the species is protected from hunting by local fady (taboo) around Daraina, due to their likeness to humans, and by Malagasy law, the gold miners who have immigrated to the area have begun to hunt the golden-crowned sifaka as a source of bushmeat. In 1993, David M. Meyers, a researcher who has studied the golden-crowned sifaka, speculated that if bushmeat hunting were to escalate, the species would go extinct in less than ten years since it is easy to find and not fearful of humans. [...] Indeed, bushmeat hunting by people from nearby Ambilobe has already extirpated at least one isolated population.|$|E
500|$|There {{had been}} drift mines in Westleigh since the 12th century {{but during the}} second half of the 19th century it became {{possible}} to mine the deeper seams and coal began to be an important industry and coal mining became the largest user of labour after the textile industry in Leigh. Parsonage Colliery, the last pit to be sunk in Leigh, was one of the deepest in the country, going down to over [...] The extent of mining at Parsonage Colliery increased in the 1960s with the driving of the Horizon Tunnel, which accessed previously inaccessible seams around 6ft (2m) high that were easy to work. The seams were wet, and a series of pumps was used to remove the water into underground canals before it was pumped into the canal at Leigh. The winding engine at Parsonage was a steam engine, fuelled by methane extracted from the workings, while the neighbouring Bickershaw Colliery had a superior electric system. In 1974, the two pits were linked underground, and all coal was wound at Bickershaw, which had better facilities, while Parsonage was used for supplies. The entire Lancashire Coalfield is closed to <b>deep</b> <b>mining,</b> although several open-cast mines are still in operation elsewhere in the county.|$|E
500|$|There is {{evidence}} of coal mining in the Middle Ages in the shaft mounds, waggonways and similar archaeological features resulting from early mining activity in Middleton Woods. Before the 17th century the pits were bell pits and adits or day holes dug horizontally into the hill sides where the coal seam outcropped. In 1669 Frances Conyers of New Hall had [...] "cole pits" [...] in Middleton. The pits were small and numerous and many worked for a short time. Gin pits using horses to turn the windlass were the next development and the deeper pits had brick-lined shafts and wooden headgear for hauling tubs of coal and miners out of the workings. This type of mine was in operation when Anne Leigh married Ralph Brandling whose family owned collieries in Durham. Brandling's 1,200 acre Middleton estate supplied coal to Leeds but was disadvantaged in the trade by poor roads. <b>Deep</b> <b>mining</b> arrived {{with the advent of}} steam engines to pump water out of the mines and keep the workings dry making it possible to raise coal from greater depths. In 1780 a Newcomen engine was installed at Middleton and by 1808 the mine employed 90 hewers and 60 putters. The market for coal grew as Leeds and its industries expanded.|$|E

500|$|Coal {{had been}} mined {{for several hundred}} years in {{numerous}} shallow shafts and adits, but took on greater importance when in 1776 Robert Vernon Atherton leased the coal rights to Thomas Guest from Leigh and John Fletcher from Bolton. In 1845 the era of <b>deep</b> <b>mining</b> arrived with the sinking of Fletcher's Lover's Lane pit at Howe Bridge. The Crombouke Day-Eye, a drift mine accessing the shallow Brassy and Crombouke mines, opened in 1870 and closed in 1907. (A coal seam {{was referred to as}} a [...] "mine" [...] in this part of Lancashire.) By the early 1870s Fletcher, Burrows and Company's Howe Bridge Colliery, the biggest of the three Howe Bridge pits, was sunk to the Black & White, or Seven Foot mine. It pit closed in 1959. Gibfield Colliery, situated alongside the Bolton and Leigh Railway, was working in 1829, coal was mined from the Trencherbone mine. Forty years later a [...] shaft was sunk to Arley Mine. The pit closed in 1963. In September 1913 the first pit head baths in the country were opened at Gibfield. Chanters Colliery was in Hindsford, where [...] shafts were sunk to the Trencherbone mine in 1854. In the late 1890s shafts were deepened to [...] to reach the Arley mine. Atherton had its share of mining disasters, on 11 February 1850 five men died in a gas explosion caused by a lighted candle at Gibfield and 27 men died at Lovers Lane Colliery after a firedamp explosion caused by blown-out shot on 28 March 1872. On 6 March 1957 eight men died at Chanters Colliery after an explosion of gas.|$|E

2500|$|In December 1916, [...] Füßlein, {{commander}} of German mining {{operations in the}} salient, had recorded that British <b>deep</b> <b>mining</b> was intended to support an offensive above ground and received three more mining companies, {{to fight in the}} British lower as well as the upper mine systems and had gained some success. In April 1917, the 4th Army (General Friedrich Bertram Sixt von Armin) received information from air reconnaissance that a British offensive was being prepared in the Messines Ridge sector and a spy reported to OHL, that if the offensive at Arras was frustrated, the British would transfer their effort to Flanders. Hermann von Kuhl, the Chief of Staff of [...] (Army Group Crown Prince Rupprecht), suggested that the salient around Messines Ridge be abandoned, since it could be attacked from three sides and most of the defences were on forward slopes, vulnerable to concentric, observed artillery-fire. A voluntary retirement would avoid the calamity experienced by the defenders at the Battle of Vimy Ridge on 9 April.|$|E
