40|$|Material {{transportation}} for high-rise building construction {{relies heavily on}} tower cranes. Hence {{the proper use of}} tower cranes is of paramount importance for high-rise residential building construction. In planning and monitoring crane usage in Hong Kong, a schedule is usually prepared to coordinate <b>hoisting</b> operations. Apart from that, little research in optimizing crane usage has been carried out previously, except on operation cycle times, e. g. concreting using a crane and skip and formwork erection. Allocation of time for the <b>hoisting</b> schedule is based on the planners' and operators' experience. The accuracy of the <b>hoisting</b> schedule for crane dominated construction works has significant effects on the materials supply and on concreting operations. Imbalance in the allocation of crane usage for subcontractors may lead to conflicts between trades and idling of workers due to a shortage of materials. Although planners understand that the load <b>hoisting</b> time is proportional to <b>hoisting</b> height and other factors, floor construction cycles usually, for simplicity, are assigned to be constant six day, eight day or ten day cycles without making the necessary compensation for the longer <b>hoisting</b> times for upper floors. The prediction of <b>hoisting</b> times is of great importance to planners to ensure the accuracy of the construction schedule for crane dominated construction. This paper describes the derivation of a mathematical model to predict the <b>hoisting</b> times for a tower crane for public housing construction. Work measurement is used to collect <b>hoisting</b> times data for analysis. Twelve factors considered to influence <b>hoisting</b> time are identified for the model. Multiple regression models are built for predicting supply <b>hoisting</b> times and return <b>hoisting</b> times. The effects of the variables on <b>hoisting</b> time are reviewed. Estimated <b>hoisting</b> times calculated from the models are compared with actual <b>hoisting</b> times, and a worked example illustrating the application of the models is presented.

40|$|The dynamic {{efficiency}} of <b>hoisting</b> transmission system {{on a container}} crane is fundamental for accurate efficiency prediction, while the dynamic {{efficiency of}} <b>hoisting</b> transmission system has not been investigated sufficiently. This paper will focus on dynamic efficiency of <b>hoisting</b> transmission system under <b>hoisting</b> dynamic load. A power loss model of gearbox was built. Then the dynamic model of gear transmission was developed including time-varying mesh stiffness and <b>hoisting</b> dynamic load was studied. Power loss, dynamic efficiency, and equivalent static efficiency were conducted in <b>hoisting</b> and lowering working conditions. The result shows that dynamic efficiency which consists of the significant lower frequency component coincided with <b>hoisting</b> load torque of the higher frequency component which {{is directly related to}} dynamic mesh and bearing force. And in two processes, the equivalent static efficiency in constant speed stage is min, whereas maximum value occurs in different stage.

40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>hoisting</b> load on {{transverse}} vibrations of <b>hoisting</b> catenaries during lifting in coal mines {{was investigated in}} this study. Firstly, dynamic analyses of the vertical <b>hoisting</b> rope were performed. The results show that transverse vibration plays the dominating role in the coupled dynamics of the vertical rope subjected to external excitation induced by axial fluctuations of head sheave, and the rope tension can be approximated by the quasistatic tension. Secondly, employing dynamic simulations, the effect of <b>hoisting</b> load on the transverse vibrations of <b>hoisting</b> catenaries was discussed. The results show that, under the second-order excitation frequency, a discrepant large transverse amplitude will be excited when the <b>hoisting</b> load ranges from 0 to 5000 [*]kg, leading to collision between the two adjacent catenaries and accelerating the rupture of rope. To solve this problem, according to simulation curves, the self-weight of conveyance (preload) can be optimized from 39500 [*]kg to 49500 [*]kg. Eventually, on-site measurements were performed on the studied machine, validating {{the accuracy of the}} effect of <b>hoisting</b> load on transverse vibrations of <b>hoisting</b> catenaries. This investigation will greatly support facility maintenance, machine design, and even engineering optimization for floor type multirope friction mine <b>hoists...</b>|$|R

The motions of elevator <b>hoisting</b> systems were illustrated to evaluate the proposed mathematical models and controller. The results of simulation show that the modeling methods can represent the longitudinal vibration of flexible <b>hoisting</b> systems.
