It summarizes <b>the</b> reasons <b>of</b> its popularity between the consumers and assesses different types <b>of</b> <b>the</b> poultry <b>meat</b> and their share <b>of</b> <b>the</b> total consumption <b>of</b> <b>the</b> poultry <b>meat</b> between countries is also done. In the introduction <b>the</b> consumption <b>of</b> <b>the</b> poultry <b>meat</b> from 1948 fill now is summarized briefly. There are explained <b>the</b> reasons <b>of</b> <b>the</b> increasing consumption <b>of</b> <b>the</b> poultry <b>meat.</b> <b>The</b> importance <b>of</b> <b>meat</b> in our diet and <b>the</b> species <b>of</b> <b>the</b> poultry <b>meat</b> are given in the next section. <b>The</b> composition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> poultry <b>meat</b> and its basic components as water, proteins, lipids, vitamines and minerals are described in detail. Bigger part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thesis is devoted to <b>the</b> consumption <b>of</b> <b>the</b> poultry <b>meat.</b> <b>The</b> consumption <b>of</b> <b>the</b> poultry <b>meat</b> in <b>the</b> Czech Republic and worldwide id compared here.

5000|$|<b>The</b> process <b>of</b> dry-aging usually also {{promotes}} {{growth of}} certain fungal (mold) species on <b>the</b> external surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>meat.</b> This {{does not cause}} spoilage, but rather forms an external [...] "crust" [...] on <b>the</b> <b>meat's</b> surface, which is trimmed off when <b>the</b> <b>meat</b> is prepared for cooking. These fungal species complement the natural enzymes in the beef by helping to tenderize and increase <b>the</b> flavor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>meat.</b> <b>The</b> genus Thamnidium, in particular, is known to produce collagenolytic enzymes which greatly contribute to the tenderness and flavor of dry-aged meat.|$|R

40|$|<b>The</b> goals <b>of</b> this {{research}} were {{to estimate the}} phenotypic correlations among various meat quality traits from a male broiler line and to describe the relation among these variables. Phenotypical correlations were determined among quality traits, isolating <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> slaughter date, <b>the</b> age <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mother and sex. The evaluated traits were pH measurements taken at time 0 and at 6 and 24 hours after slaughtering, color parameters, water loss due to exudation, thawing and cooking <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>meat,</b> and shear force. Important associations (P 0. 05) to <b>the</b> other traits <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>meat,</b> whereas <b>the</b> pH at 24 hours after slaughter was able of directly interfering with <b>the</b> attributes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>meat,</b> since this trait was inversely related with lightness and water losses, which indicates an effect of pH fall along 24 h after slaughtering on protein denaturation. This study demonstrates that <b>the</b> variables <b>of</b> poultry <b>meat</b> quality are related {{and that there is}} a phenotypical association between lightness and cooking losses and <b>the</b> other attributes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>meat.</b> <b>The</b> pH at 24 hours after slaughtering, lightness and cooking losses could be efficient meat quality indicators in this broiler line...|$|R

40|$|<b>The</b> {{objective}} <b>of</b> {{this study}} is to determine <b>the</b> degree <b>of</b> superficial bacterial contamination in superficial and deeper layers of raw bovine meat sold to customers at backyard meat stalls and open wet markets. A total of 150 meat samples were obtained from various meat stall and wet market in Kota Bharu, Kelantan. <b>The</b> <b>meat</b> surface were scrapped and cut to a deeper layer (2 cm deep) to screen the bacteria. The total plate count (TPC) was taken. Several potential pathogenic bacteria were found mainly on <b>the</b> surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>meat.</b> <b>The</b> deeper layers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>meat</b> showed less bacterial contamination especially in the next morning. The TPC also showed that the surface bacteria in the morning or afternoon was significantly (P < 0. 05) higher than <b>the</b> deeper layers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>meat.</b> <b>The</b> results reflect the poor conditions in slaughtering and handling of cattle carcasses, as well as hygiene deficiencies within <b>the</b> area <b>of</b> Kota Bharu. <b>The</b> high prevalence <b>of</b> potential pathogenic bacteria represents a real danger and is a threat to public healt...|$|R

While Tainos kept dogs and Muscovy ducks, only dogs were reported by early observers, or found at Lucayan sites. Less than twelve percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>meat</b> eaten by Lucayans came from land animals, of which three-quarters came from iguanas and land crabs. More than 80 percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>meat</b> in <b>the</b> Lucayan diet came from marine fishes, almost all of which grazed on seagrass and/or coral. Sea turtles and marine mammals (West Indian monk seal and porpoise) provided a very small portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>meat</b> in <b>the</b> Lucayan diet. <b>The</b> balance <b>of</b> dietary <b>meat</b> came from marine mollusks.|$|R

50|$|In many instances, {{contracting}} {{the diseases}} mentioned above often occurs due to <b>the</b> cutting <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>meat,</b> when animal blood and other fluids may touch the people cutting it, thereby infecting them. Another path of infection {{is that some}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>meat</b> may not be completely cooked. This often occurs due to <b>the</b> type <b>of</b> heat source employed; meat hung over open fires. Improper preparation of any infected animal may be fatal.|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} due to <b>the</b> higher demand <b>of</b> {{domestic}} consumers encouraged by <b>the</b> quality <b>of</b> <b>meat,</b> <b>the</b> marketing {{has made the}} retail spend <b>the</b> demand <b>of</b> refrigerators <b>the</b> supply <b>of</b> <b>meat</b> and carcasses to submit certain quality characteristics (tenderness, juiciness and color). The objective was to explain <b>the</b> types <b>of</b> <b>meat</b> softeners, which is effective in beef tenderness process. Currently industrialized softeners mainly consisting of papain can make <b>the</b> softening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>meat.</b> These softeners have industrial advantages of being readily available and relatively inexpensive, and easy to use. <b>The</b> enzymatic softening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>meat</b> {{is a result of}} partial degradation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>meat</b> component. <b>The</b> papain from papaya, bromelain from pineapple and ficin from fig have effective softener action. Collagen disruption occurs in connective tissue and the contractile proteins in which papain, bromelain, trypsin and Rhozyme P- 11 hydrolyzes <b>the</b> soluble proteins <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>meat,</b> but bromelain and ficin degrade the collagen while elastin is only degraded by papain and ficin. It follows that mechanisms such as meat softeners are efficient and able to improve this attribute, and assists in obtaining the greatest influence on <b>the</b> organoleptic <b>meat.</b> Admittedly mentioning that the current retail market, has been policing to <b>the</b> type <b>of</b> product they are buying and selling, for today's consumer shows up more particular about the quantity and quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> product they are consuming...|$|R
