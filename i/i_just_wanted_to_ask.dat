30|$|Assessing {{outcomes}} of educational efforts {{in terms of}} competence {{has a long tradition}} in fields of general education and gained particular recognition through international large-scale assessments such as Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). However, respective efforts to measure domain-specific vocational and professional competences are still rare. In 2011, the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) launched the research initiative ‘Technology-Based Assessment of Skills and Competencies in Vocational Education and Training (ASCOT)’. The initiative aimed at the development of computer-based instruments for the assessment of domain-specific competences in selected vocations in Germany on the basis of authentic work and business processes. The work presented in this paper is part of a research project entitled ‘Modelling and measuring domain-specific problem-solving competence of industrial clerks (DomPL-IK)’. 1 In the following, we want to highlight two innovative features of our competence measurement in the business domain: (1) With problem-solving competence we address higher-order competences instead of just knowledge reproduction. Therefore, we did not only develop complex problem scenarios within an authentic office simulation but also provided an open-ended and authentic problem space for working on these problems rather than apply highly structured items (e.g., multiple choice items). The analysis of the participants’ complex behavior patterns was based on a theoretically driven competence model and on item response theory (IRT). (2) As an alternative to relying on detached self-report questionnaires, we implemented an integrated measurement of non-cognitive facets of competence (i.e., facets of self-concept and interest) that we refer to as ‘Embedded Experience Sampling’ (EES): Test-takers in a complex problem-solving task are requested to stop at certain times during the test and spontaneously answer short prompts regarding their actual experience of the problem situation (e.g., ‘Your colleague Julian visits your office: Hi, how are you? I heard {{you have to deal with}} a rather large task. Well, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> how you are doing.’; answers were to be given on a four-point Likert scale, e.g. from ‘At the moment, I feel not at all confident’ =  1 to ‘… very confident’ =  4). The project is located in commercial vocational education and training (VET). Nevertheless, the approach is applicable in other domains as well.|$|E
