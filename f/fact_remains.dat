The tonnage of bombs dropped suggested {{there were fewer}} bombers than claimed. The RAF fighters claimed four Do 17s. The <b>fact</b> <b>remains</b> that the Germans penetrated the airspace without interception and {{came very close to}} inflicting critical damage to the Spitfire factory. The radar had done its job and alerted No. 11 and 10 Group 20 minutes before the bombs started to fall. The fault lay either with the No. 10 or 11 Group controllers who were late in ordering their Squadrons to scramble.|$|E

25|$|The already poor {{knowledge}} of Aix history from Roman times is further obscured {{due to the}} lack of sources regarding the end of the Roman Empire and the early Middle Ages. We are left to conjecture by studying the destruction from the barbarian invasions that have left traces of fires on Gallo-Roman villas of the area, such as at Arbin. The <b>fact</b> <b>remains</b> that the Roman Baths of Aix fell to ruins from the fifth century and traces of urban development are lost.|$|E

I therefore claimed {{to be included in the}} same category as the civilian railway officials and men of the breakdown gang, whose declared duty it was to clear the line, pointing out that though my action might differ in degree from theirs, it was of precisely the same character, and that if they were regarded as non-combatants I had a right to be considered a non-combatant too.|$|E

25|$|Jewish {{historians have}} stated {{that it is hard}} to {{describe}} the national sense of shock and trauma that set in when the masses of Jews all over the world learned that someone as famous as Sabbatai Zevi had officially abandoned his faith for Islam. However, the <b>fact</b> <b>remains</b> that Zevi is the most famous Jew to have become a Muslim, which is also what the term Sabbatean has come to denote. Many within Zevi's inner circle followed him into Islam, including his wife Sarah and most of his closest relatives and friends. Nathan of Gaza, the scholar closest to Zevi, who had caused Zevi to reveal his Messiahship and in turn became his prophet, never followed his master into Islam but remained a Jew, albeit excommunicated by his Jewish brethren.|$|E
25|$|As Governor Bush's {{counsel in}} Texas, Gonzales also {{reviewed}} all clemency requests. A 2003 article in The Atlantic Monthly asserted that Gonzales gave insufficient counsel, {{and failed to}} second-guess convictions and failed appeals. Gonzales' deputy general counsel from 1995 to 1999, Pete Wassdorf, in turn sought to defend Gonzales from what he characterized as an inaccurate and incomplete picture of the clemency process under Bush. Under Section II, Article 4 of the Texas Constitution, the Governor cannot grant a pardon or commute a death sentence except with a majority vote recommendation of the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles, so Bush was constrained in granting clemency {{even if he had}} wanted to do so in a case. The <b>fact</b> <b>remains</b> that only one death sentence was overturned by Governor Bush, and the state of Texas executed more prisoners during Gonzales's term than any other state.|$|E
25|$|Wallace-Johnson {{received}} his primary education at Centenary Tabernacle Day School before entering United Methodist Collegiate School in 1911. There, he engaged in numerous leadership activities. On one such occasion, he led his classmates in {{a protest against}} unreasonable punishment by school authorities. He also edited the school's newspaper, Wall Paper. He dropped out two years later to support his family. He was first employed as a temporary outdoor officer at the customs department. Soon, he became a permanent employee of the department. He became involved in a labour strike for increased pay and better working conditions. It is widely believed that Wallace-Johnson led the strike, but this <b>fact</b> <b>remains</b> uncertain. All employees involved in the strike were dismissed, but reinstituted to their jobs a year later after the Secretary of State for the Colonies assessed the case. During the one-year break, he held jobs as a surveyor, farmer, fisher and a clerk in a law office. He was very popular as a lay preacher among rural villagers. He was interested in joining the ministry, but he lacked the proper education needed to enter the occupation. All during this time, he wrote articles in the Aurora, a newspaper edited by H. C. Bankole-Bright. Wallace-Johnson considered Bankole-Bright {{to be the most}} influential person in his life at the time. Following a 1938 feud, Bankole-Bright would become Wallace-Johnson's political nemesis.|$|E

25|$|Organ {{donation}} is {{fast becoming}} an important bioethical issue from a social perspective as well. While most first-world nations have a legal system of oversight for organ transplantation, the <b>fact</b> <b>remains</b> that demand far outstrips supply. Consequently, there has arisen a black market trend {{often referred to as}} transplant tourism. The issues are weighty and controversial. On the one hand are those who contend that those who can afford to buy organs are exploiting those who are desperate enough to sell their organs. Many suggest this results in a growing inequality of status between the rich and the poor. On the other hand, are those who contend that the desperate should be allowed to sell their organs and that preventing them from doing so is merely contributing to their status as impoverished. Further, those in favor of the trade hold that exploitation is morally preferable to death, and in so far as the choice lies between abstract notions of justice {{on the one hand and}} a dying person whose life could be saved on the other hand, the organ trade should be legalized. Conversely, surveys conducted among living donors postoperatively and in a period of five years following the procedure have shown extreme regret in a majority of the donors, who said that given the chance to repeat the procedure, they would not. Additionally, many study participants reported a decided worsening of economic condition following the procedure. These studies looked only at people who sold a kidney in countries where organ sales are already legal.|$|E

[...] Winthrop {{was a member of}} the {{committee}} which drafted the code, but his exact role is not known because records of the committee have not survived. [...] C.S. Manegold claims that Winthrop was opposed to the Body of Liberties because he favored a common law approach to legislation, yet the <b>fact</b> <b>remains</b> that he was one of the men who drafted the legislation.|$|E
500|$|After {{the advent}} of Newtonian physics, {{the concept of a}} conatus of all {{physical}} bodies was largely superseded by the principle of inertia and conservation of momentum. As Bidney states, [...] "It is true that logically desire or the conatus is merely a principle of inertia...the <b>fact</b> <b>remains,</b> however, that this is not Spinoza's usage." [...] Likewise, conatus was used by many philosophers to describe other concepts which have slowly been made obsolete. Conatus recendendi, for instance, became the centrifugal force, and gravity is used where conatus a centro had been previously. Today, the topics with which conatus dealt are matters of science and are thus subject to inquiry by the scientific method.|$|E
40|$|Stochastic {{models are}} {{increasingly}} {{used to study}} the behaviour of biochemical systems. While the structure of such models is often readily available from first principles, unknown quantitative features of the model are incorporated into the model as parameters. Algorithmic discovery of parameter values from experimentally observed <b>facts</b> <b>remains</b> a challenge for the computational systems biology community. We present a new parameter discovery algorithm that uses simulated annealing, sequential hypothesis testing, and statistical model checking to learn the parameters in a stochastic model. We apply our technique to a model of glucose and insulin metabolism used for in-silico validation of artificial pancreata and demonstrate its effectiveness by developing parallel CUDA-based implementation for parameter synthesis in this model...|$|R

500|$|Raz {{identified}} judicial independence {{as one of}} {{the essential}} principles of the rule of law. In this context, judicial independence refers to the judiciary's independence from the legislative and executive branches of the government. Singapore's judiciary enjoys a certain measure of independence provided by various constitutional safeguards such as security of tenure and remuneration. Judges are also relatively free from executive and legislative influence. A retired Supreme Court judge, L.P. Thean, has said that it is theoretically possible for the executive to make political appointments to the Bench, to reduce a judge's remuneration by amending the Constitution, or to take away the judiciary's vital support staff, but [...] "he <b>fact</b> <b>remains,</b> however, that nothing of that kind has ever been done".|$|E

[...] Priestley was less impressed by the supposed Trollopian side of Walpole's work, finding some of it formulaic. He was more taken with a darker, Dostoyevskian, side that he found in the writing: [...] "suddenly it will transform the pleasant easy scene he is giving us into transparency behind which are bright stars and red hellfire... No matter how jolly and zestful he may appear to be, the <b>fact</b> <b>remains</b> that he possesses an unusually sharp sense of evil." ...|$|E

[...] Writing in The Observers sister paper, The Guardian, Christopher Wordsworth noted that [...] "since Goldfinger 007 has been toiling hopelessly {{in the wake of}} the Zeitgeist." [...] Prior to this novel, Wordsworth writes, [...] "the distance between Live and let Die, Ian Fleming's second and best, and You Only Live Twice, his last and worst, is a long iron down the Sandwich fairway."

500|$|By contrast, the {{remaining}} work, the Cello Concerto in E minor, had a disastrous premiere, {{at the opening}} concert of the London Symphony Orchestra's 1919–20 season in October 1919. Apart from the Elgar work, which the composer conducted, {{the rest of the}} programme was conducted by Albert Coates, who overran his rehearsal time at the expense of Elgar's. Lady Elgar wrote, [...] "that brutal selfish ill-mannered bounder ... that brute Coates went on rehearsing." [...] The critic of The Observer, Ernest Newman, wrote, [...] "There have been rumours about during the week of inadequate rehearsal. Whatever the explanation, the sad <b>fact</b> <b>remains</b> that never, in all probability, has so great an orchestra made so lamentable an exhibition of itself. ... The work itself is lovely stuff, very simple – that pregnant simplicity that has come upon Elgar's music {{in the last couple of}} years – but with a profound wisdom and beauty underlying its simplicity." [...] Elgar attached no blame to his soloist, Felix Salmond, who played for him again later. In contrast with the First Symphony and its hundred performances in just over a year, the Cello Concerto did not have a second performance in London for more than a year.|$|E

He and the orchestra got off to a disastrous start. Their first concert featured the premiere of Elgar's Cello Concerto. Apart from the concerto, which the composer conducted, the rest of the programme was conducted by Coates, who overran his rehearsal time at the expense of Elgar's.
