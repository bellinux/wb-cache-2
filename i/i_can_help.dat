500|$|I {{finally got}} tired of making movies where all I did was walk across the screen and look pretty. I got a big chance to do some real acting in The Postman Always Rings Twice, and I'm not going to slip back if <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> it. I tried to persuade the studio to give me {{something}} different. But every time I went into my argument about how bad a picture was, they'd say, [...] "well, it's making a fortune". That licked me.|$|E

I had hoped that you could straighten him out. Your charges sound fantastic to the average person—but I've been through it—the beatings, threats on my life, all the sadistic traits you charge—twelve years of it ...

500|$|Renault {{driver and}} two-time Championship winner Fernando Alonso created {{controversy}} {{when he said}} [...] "if <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>help,</b> I will help Massa." [...] Alonso's departure from McLaren after driving for the British team in 2007 had been acrimonious, and Alonso's dislike for the rookie Hamilton was well documented. Talking about Hamilton's penalty in Japan, Alonso said [...] "I don't know what he did, but it's good he's punished anyway." [...] Hamilton refused {{to be drawn into}} the controversy: [...] "I don't particularly have an opinion on it," [...] he said, adding that he was interested only in his own race.|$|E

500|$|One of {{the songs}} they worked together, [...] "It's You", {{was said to be}} one of the album's centerpiece, with Malik commenting: [...] "I just felt like I needed to put myself out there, just because it was a form of therapy for me and it did help me get through some shit. If <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> someone else at that time, that’s cool." [...] Dan Hyman from [...] Pitchfork Media stated that the song shared {{similarities}} with Ocean’s [...] "Bad Religion", with Ho mentioning that after hearing the song live and Zayn's fans noting similarities between both songs, he found them similar with the organ. [...] "It's You" [...] premiered during Zane Lowe's Beats One Radio on 25 February 2016, and a day later, 26 February 2016, it was released as the first promotional single from Zayn's debut solo studio album Mind of Mine (2016), along with the pre-order of the album on the iTunes Store.|$|E
500|$|Russian {{artillery}} {{continued to}} {{fire on the}} Light Brigade. As Lucan advanced after them with the Heavy Brigade, he saw the Light Brigade being overwhelmed by the Russian artillery and ordered the Heavies back, saying that [...] "They have sacrificed the Light Brigade; they shall not the Heavy, if <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> it". The remainder of the Light Brigade eventually reached the Russian artillery, wreaking havoc on the fleeing gunners, before pursuing the Russian cavalry behind the artillery down {{the remainder of the}} valley. Despite being outnumbered five to one, the British cavalry who pursued the Russians managed to disrupt the enemy for some time before being killed or captured. Of the cavalry who had stayed with the abandoned artillery guns, 60 or 70 were collected by George Paget, who retired back to the British lines despite Russian cavalry harrying them. The result was 110 dead, 130 wounded, and 58 missing or captured – 40 percent losses in an action that lasted 20 minutes.|$|E
500|$|Lin {{considers}} himself {{a basketball player}} {{more than just an}} Asian American. He understands that there have not been many Asians in the NBA. [...] "Maybe <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> break the stereotype," [...] said Lin. [...] "I feel like Asians in general don't get the respect that we may deserve whether it comes to sports, basketball, or whatever it might be," [...] Lin said. Prior to the 2010–11 NBA season, Americans of Asian descent who played in the NBA included Wataru Misaka, Raymond Townsend, Corey Gaines, Rex Walters, and Robert Swift. [...] " [...] carrying the hopes of an entire continent. I only had to carry the hopes of Little Rock, Arkansas. He's accomplished a lot more than I have already," [...] said Derek Fisher, who had won five NBA championships with the Lakers, after his first game against Lin. Lin is setting an example for prospective Asian athletes in America who rarely see Asian-Americans playing on their favorite teams. [...] "I don't look Japanese," [...] Walters said, referring to his mother's ethnicity. [...] "When they see , it's an Asian-American." ...|$|E

500|$|Nash, {{whose father}} {{was born in the}} Tottenham {{district}} of London, is a lifelong Tottenham Hotspur supporter, and has expressed interest in owning a minority stake in the club. [...] "I'd like to be an owner. It's something I could do {{for the rest of my}} life after my little window of popularity dies", he said in an interview with The New York Times. Nash added, [...] "I've been a passionate supporter all my life. My parents are from north London and so it's not like I'm some Yank who wants to make a profit out of football. I don't care about making money. I just want to see Spurs succeed and, if <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>help,</b> that's great." [...] However, he said any participation in Spurs would come after his basketball career is over, and he has had only [...] "casual contact" [...] with chairman Daniel Levy and former director of football Damien Comolli. Nash is also a fan of Spain's FC Barcelona, and Brazilian team Sport Club Corinthians Paulista, which his former Suns teammate Leandro Barbosa supports. When Barbosa visited Corinthians in 2007, the club gave him a shirt with Nash's name and jersey number.|$|E
500|$|Elliott {{was known}} as [...] "a coach's AD." [...] "He hired coaches he trusted, then gave them the resources, {{latitude}} and support they needed to operate as they saw fit – providing they played by the rules." [...] Iowa wrestling coach Dan Gable said his wife cried on learning that Elliott had retired. [...] In 1999, Gable wrote: [...] "Right after I came to coach at the University of Iowa, I {{had a meeting with}} Bump Elliott, who was the Athletic Director. I’ll never forget what Bump said to me: ‘Don’t ask for the moon. Strive to get there, sure, but do it wisely through continuing to build upon what you already have. As you build, come see me, and we’ll see how <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> you out.’ I now call that bit of wisdom the Bump Elliott Rule, and it serves a good reminder to keep things in perspective. Gradual, solid growth is better than any quick fix.""The one thing we emphasized from the start was that our staff had to make sure we were 100 percent loyal to each other and the university," [...] Elliott said {{at the time of his}} retirement. [...] "There could be no jealousy between the coaches and various programs. [...] I wanted no one talking behind anyone's backs. [...] I wanted absolute loyalty. [...] If not, then that person could leave any time." ...|$|E
500|$|Lester {{was offered}} {{producing}} credit but refused, going uncredited for his work. Salkind felt that bringing a second director onto the set meant {{there would be}} someone ready {{in the event that}} Donner could not fulfill his directing duties. [...] "Being there all the time meant he [...] could take over," [...] Salkind admitted. [...] " [...] couldn't make up his mind on stuff." [...] On Lester, Donner reflected, [...] "He'd been suing the Salkinds for his money on Three and Four Musketeers, which he'd never gotten. He won a lot of his lawsuits, but each time he sued the Salkinds in one country, they'd move to another, from Costa Rica to Panama to Switzerland. When I was hired, Lester told me, 'Don't do it. Don't work for them. I was told not to, but I did it. Now I'm telling you not to, but you'll probably do it and end up telling the next guy.' Lester came in as a 'go-between'. I didn't trust Lester, and I told him. He said, 'Believe me, I'm only doing it because they're paying me the money that they owe me from the lawsuit. I'll never come onto your set unless you ask me; I'll never go to your dailies. If <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>help</b> you in any way, call me." ...|$|E

2500|$|Despite Scott's {{efforts to}} {{preserve}} his anonymity, almost every reviewer guessed that Waverley was his work. Many readers too recognized his hand. One, Jane Austen, wrote: [...] "Walter Scott has no business to write novels, especially good ones. – It is not fair.

Morris first became interested in the case in the early 1990s and believes that MacDonald is not guilty after undertaking extensive research. Morris explained in a July 2013 interview, prior to the reopening of the case: [...] "What happened here is wrong. It's wrong to convict a man under these circumstances.
