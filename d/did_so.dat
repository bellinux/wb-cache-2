5|$|Did Harrison {{deliberately}} use {{the music}} of He's So Fine? I do not believe he <b>did</b> <b>so</b> deliberately.

5|$|Early in Wetherby's term, the state's {{revenues}} were inflated by the Korean War. Having adopted a pay-as-you-go {{program for the}} state, {{he was forced to}} raise additional revenue after the war ended. He <b>did</b> <b>so</b> by imposing sin taxes on cigarettes, alcoholic beverages, and parimutuel betting, but he was unable to convince the General Assembly to adopt a sales tax.|$|E

5000|$|The idea of {{intrinsic}} finality presumes an objective reality that obeys a natural order or natural {{law in the}} universe. Things are [...] "meant" [...] to be and behave a certain way, and naturally tend to act that way. For instance, animals have natural instincts for self-preservation, seeking food, and reproduction. They <b>do</b> <b>so</b> because it is their nature to <b>do</b> <b>so.</b> Theologians go further, to argue that they <b>do</b> <b>so</b> because they were created to <b>do</b> <b>so.</b>|$|R

"Such a {{thing is}} {{impossible}} {{in the nature of}} things," [...] said Mr. George; [...] "for if any one class gets the control of the government of a country, they will of course manage {{it in such a way}} as to get the wealth and the honors mainly to themselves.

5|$|Meetings {{could take}} place either inside or outside of the formal {{boundary}} of the city (the pomerium), though the official meeting place, or curia was at {{the centre of the}} Roman forum. The president of the Senate was normally one of the consuls, but it could be called to meet by any of the praetors or tribunes, both of whom had the authority to call the Senate, though praetors rarely <b>did</b> <b>so</b> unless the consuls were away and the tribunes almost never <b>did</b> <b>so.</b> Meetings were suffused in religious ritual. Temples were a preferred meeting site and auspices would be taken before the meeting could commence.|$|E
25|$|The first question, then, {{was whether}} it had had an {{adequate}} opportunity to <b>do</b> <b>so,</b> {{regardless of whether it}} actually had.

Therefore, it argued, neither there nor on remand could it have <b>done</b> <b>so.</b>|$|R
