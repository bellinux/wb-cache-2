The ultimate answer from Gasparo not long in coming: with the ark of Sant'Apollonio of 1508, he established once and for all his artistic superiority, which was by then certainly much more preferred by the Brescian clientele.|$|E

5|$|All of {{the forces}} in the {{universe}} are based on four fundamental interactions. The strong and weak forces are nuclear forces that act only at very short distances, and {{are responsible for the}} interactions between subatomic particles, including nucleons and compound nuclei. The electromagnetic force acts between electric charges, and the gravitational force acts between masses. All other forces in nature derive from these four fundamental interactions. For example, friction is a manifestation of the electromagnetic force acting between the atoms of two surfaces, and the Pauli exclusion principle, which does not permit atoms to pass through each other. Similarly, the forces in springs, modeled by Hooke's law, are the result of electromagnetic forces and the Exclusion Principle acting together to return an object to its equilibrium position. Centrifugal forces are acceleration forces that arise simply from the acceleration of rotating <b>frames</b> <b>of</b> reference.|$|E

In the final, O'Sullivan played Mark Selby. In the first session after O'Sullivan went 2–1 up, Selby took advantage of errors by O'Sullivan to win 5 straight frames. However, in a high quality second session, O'Sullivan fought back to close to within one frame at 7–8, but Selby prevailed winning the next two frames and the title 7–10. In the last six <b>frames</b> <b>of</b> the match, a total of 5 century breaks were made, 2 by O'Sullivan of 134 and 130.

5|$|At {{the base}} of {{classical}} mechanics {{is the notion that}} a body's motion can be described as a combination of free (or inertial) motion, and deviations from this free motion. Such deviations are caused by external forces acting on a body in accordance with Newton's second law of motion, which states that the net force acting on a body is equal to that body's (inertial) mass multiplied by its acceleration. The preferred inertial motions are related to the geometry of space and time: in the standard reference <b>frames</b> <b>of</b> classical mechanics, objects in free motion move along straight lines at constant speed. In modern parlance, their paths are geodesics, straight world lines in curved spacetime.|$|E

5000|$|The {{moving magnet}} and {{conductor}} {{problem is a}} famous thought experiment, originating in the 19th century, concerning the intersection of classical electromagnetism and special relativity.

The observable quantity in the experiment, the current, is the same in either case, in accordance with the basic principle of relativity, which states: [...] "Only relative motion is observable; there is no absolute standard of rest".

5|$|The {{first step}} towards colourisation was the {{restoration}} of the original negatives, which were in poor condition owing to extensive printing of the negative during the original theatrical release. Costly and labour-intensive restoration was essential before colourisation could be carried out.

After cleaning, each of the 300,000 <b>frames</b> <b>of</b> the negative was scanned into a 10 megabytes-sized file and then was digitally restored. The entire restoration work was undertaken by Acris Lab, Chennai. The dialogues in the original soundtrack were also in a bad state of preservation, which necessitated having the sound cleaned at Chace Studio in the United States. The background score and the entire musical track was recreated by Naushad and Uttam Singh.

5|$|The {{results of}} special {{relativity}} {{can be summarized}} by treating space and time as a unified structure known as spacetime (withc relating the units of space and time), and requiring that physical theories satisfy a special symmetry called Lorentz invariance, whose mathematical formulation contains the parameterc. Lorentz invariance is an almost universal assumption for modern physical theories, such as quantum electrodynamics, quantum chromodynamics, the Standard Model of particle physics, and general relativity. As such, the parameterc is ubiquitous in modern physics, appearing in many contexts that are unrelated to light. For example, general relativity predicts thatc is also the speed of gravity and of gravitational waves. In non-inertial <b>frames</b> <b>of</b> reference (gravitationally curved spacetime or accelerated reference frames), the local speed of light is constant and equal toc, but {{the speed of light}} along a trajectory of finite length can differ fromc, depending on how distances and times are defined.|$|E

Using this method, NATASHA (Nonlinear Aeroelastic Trim And Stability for HALE Aircraft) has been updated so that it is now capable of analyzing joined-wing configurations. This new formulation is based on the fully intrinsic equations, which intro-duce neither singularities and nor infinite-degree nonlinearities caused by finite rotation. The formulation makes use of an incremental form of the kinematical equations, which allows preservation of the main advantageous features of the fully intrinsic equations. The method is applied and validated for a joined-wing structure.
