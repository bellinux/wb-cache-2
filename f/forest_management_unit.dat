Indeed, despite the provision for partial zonation, the Global Toolkit makes it clear that for the purposes of certification, any <b>forest</b> <b>management</b> <b>unit</b> containing even one small HCV is classified as a High Conservation Value Forest, which brings into play extra requirements for consultation, maintenance or enhancement, and annual monitoring.

40|$|Abstract This paper {{analyzes}} how {{sustained yield}} (SY) forestry is defined and implemented in Sweden and Russia, two countries with different forest-industrial regimes. We first compare definitions of SY forestry in national legis-lation and policies.

In Sweden SY forestry is maximum yield based on high-input <b>forest</b> <b>management,</b> and in Russia it is forestry based on natural regeneration with minimum investments in silviculture.
