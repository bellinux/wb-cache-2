Batches of two reference materials. water and sand. both spiked with radionuclides (Ba- 133, Cs- 134, Cs- 137, K- 40, Co- 57 and Co- 60) were used in an intra- and <b>interlaboratory</b> <b>test.</b> For the water and sand, 10 and 9 laboratories, respectively, agreed to analyse three samples of each reference material strictly according to the pre-normative protocol. The <b>interlaboratory</b> <b>test</b> programme showed that for both reference materials the values for the reproducibility standard deviation were 1. 5 - 6 times larger than those for the repeatability standard deviation. This extra variation is caused by the parameter 'laboratory. For both reference materials the repeatability standard deviation was found in the range 0. 9 - 2. 0 % of the mean activity concentration: the reproducibility standard deviation ranged from 2. 5 - 6. 0 %. Bias of the test method was found for Cs- 134 (- 6. 8 %) and Ba- 133 (- 2. 3 %) in case of the spiked water and for Cs- 134 (- 7. 8 %) in case of the spiked sand. This bias is attributed to no or insufficient correction for coincidence summing. In general, the <b>interlaboratory</b> <b>test</b> showed satisfactory agreement between laboratories, In the light of regulations on radioactivity in materials it is concluded that for measurement of this activity the Dutch protocol may serve as a blueprint for an (European Community) protocol.

The purpose of <b>interlaboratory</b> comparison <b>tests</b> (ICTs) is to assess the results of X-ray quantitative phase analysis of an artificial mixture of minerals and to confirm the level of competence of testing laboratories. Methods. The procedure for conducting <b>interlaboratory</b> comparison <b>tests</b> is as follows: development of the programme and its approval; collecting and registering applications from laboratories, willing to participate in the ICT programme; preparation and simultaneous sending of control samples with accompanying information materials to those participating in the experiment; statistical processing of obtained results; drawing up, approval and circulation of documents confirming participation of the laboratories. The control sample is a homogenized artificial mixture of minerals (quartz, kaolinite, calcite and pyrite).

40|$|Polycyclic {{aromatic}} hydrocarbons (PAHs) have been extracted from contaminated land samples by supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) with both pure and modified carbon dioxide. An experimental design approach, {{based on a}} central composite design, {{was used to determine}} which SFE operating variables affect the total recovery of 16 PAHS. Four parametes were chosen for evaluation: pressure, temperature, extraction time, and percent methanol modifier addition. Accessible levels of each parameter were dependent on instrumental constraints. A statistical treatment of the results indicated that extraction time and percent modifier addition were the only variables to significantly affect PAH recovery. The levels of these variables were then set at their maximum values, while the pressure and temperature were maintained at their midpoint values in the design. These conditions were used in a repeatability study (n = 7), which extracted an average of 458. 0 mg kg 1 total PAHs from the contaminated land sample with an RSD of 3. 1 %. Sequential extractions on three of these samples, using identical operating conditions, did not show the presence of any PAHs.
