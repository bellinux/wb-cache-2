5|$|Before {{the arrival}} of humans roughly 1500 to 2000years ago, lemurs were found all across the island. However, early {{settlers}} quickly converted the forests to rice paddies and grassland through slash-and-burn agriculture (known locally as tavy), restricting lemurs to approximately 10% of the island's area, ~60,000km2 (23,000sq mi). Today, the <b>diversity</b> <b>and</b> complexity of lemur communities increases with floral <b>diversity</b> <b>and</b> precipitation and is highest in the rainforests of the east coast, where precipitation and floral diversity are also at their highest. Despite their adaptations for weathering extreme adversity, habitat destruction and hunting have resulted in lemur populations declining sharply, and their diversity has diminished, with the recent extinction of at least 17species in eight genera, known collectively as the subfossil lemurs. Most of the approximately 100species and subspecies of lemur are either threatened or endangered. Unless trends change, extinctions are likely to continue.|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} {{within the field of}} Industrial and Organisational Psychology. It focuses on the {{relationship}} between <b>diversity</b> management <b>and</b> organisational climate dimensions. The literature review indicates that most of the research conducted on these two concepts, <b>diversity</b> management <b>and</b> organisational climate investigated the concept diversity, not diversity management (Cox, 1993; Hicks-Clarke & Hies, 2003). This study specifically explores diversity management in a retail organisation. The empirical component of the study includes confirmatory factor analysis, reliability analysis and a correlational study investigating the relationship between <b>diversity</b> management <b>and</b> organisational climate. It was found that there is a positive and strong relationship between <b>diversity</b> management <b>and</b> organisational climate. <b>Diversity</b> management seems to correlate highly with the following climate dimensions: policies and procedures, discrimination, gender issues, equality in conditions of employment and employment equity.

5|$|Ants {{identify}} kin and nestmates {{through their}} scent, {{which comes from}} hydrocarbon-laced secretions that coat their exoskeletons. If an ant is separated from its original colony, it will eventually lose the colony scent. Any ant that enters a colony without a matching scent will be attacked. Also, the reason why two separate colonies of ants will attack each other {{even if they are}} of the same species is because the genes responsible for pheromone production are different between them. The Argentine ant, however, does not have this characteristic, due to lack of genetic <b>diversity,</b> <b>and</b> has become a global pest because of it.|$|E
