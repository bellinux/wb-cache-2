(Re-) introducing a federal wealrh tax is an attractive option both with regard to revenue and redistributive aspects.

30|$|Unrealistically, {{low water}} cost inevitably results in over-consumption {{as there is}} little {{awareness}} of the scarcity of water or the substantial cost in producing desalinated water and, therefore, no incentive to curb overuse. Therefore, the only realistic way to control the very high consumption of water within the water-scarce region will be to increase the cost of water {{with the hope that}} high water costs will compel consumers to use less of the resource and/or employ more prudent water conservation measures. This, however, may entail heavy political costs and may need a very careful analysis before implementation. To reduce water misuse, the governments can implement a water-pricing policy with two rates components, one fixed and the other volume based. The fixed charge is payable by all consumers regardless of the level of consumption and includes a <b>free</b> <b>allowance</b> <b>of</b> a determined quantity per quarter to cushion the low-income earners. The volume-based charges can be divided into pre-determined ascending volumetric blocks, that is, consumption in each succeeding block is charged at a higher rate than the previous block. This way larger consumers end up paying more and would, therefore, be motivated to conserve water and avoid wasteful expenditures. The UAE has adopted this approach by slightly increasing water and electricity tariff (Todorova 2014). However, the increase still seems too low to encourage sustainable consumption.|$|R

In China, Guangdong is the first and currently the only pilot province to introduce auctions into the allowance allocation. After the first pilot year (July 2013 –July 2014), the compliance rate of enterprises and the allowance on CO 2 emissions reduction achieved 98.90 and 99.97  %, respectively.

This paper analyzes the consequences <b>of</b> phasing out <b>free</b> <b>allowances</b> in a dynamic two-period model when one group of countries unilaterally implements climate policies such as an emissions trading scheme.

The social planner addresses the relocation problem by offering firms transfers, i. e. <b>free</b> <b>allowances,</b> conditional on maintaining the production in the regulating country. If transfers are unrestricted in both periods, then the social planner can implement the first best by setting the carbon price equal to the marginal environmental damage and using transfers to prevent any relocation. However, if transfers in the future period are restricted, it is optimal to implement a declining carbon price path with the first period price exceeding the marginal environmental damage. A high carbon price triggers investments in abatement capital and thus creates a lock-in effect. With a larger abatement capital stock, firms are less affected by carbon prices in the future and therefore less prone to relocate in the second period where transfers are restricted...|$|R
