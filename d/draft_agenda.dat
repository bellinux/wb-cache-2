It has a particular focus on ICRAF, one of the non associated centers under consideration for CGIAR support. The paper is complementary to a similar one on forestry research, and a desk study on natural resources conservation and management. It outlines the arguments made about the importance of agroforestry and the changing role of ICRAF, reviews past research, and provides a stocktaking of what institutions are doing in the field, drawn largely from the work of the TAC Forestry Panel. Three possible options are identified: carrying out agroforestry research through existing IARCs, restructuring the CGIAR system into a series of regional/agroecological centers; and combining either of the first two options with a role for ICRAF as a focal point, also continuing hands on research in Africa. The paper addresses the interface between agroforestry and forestry research.

The Agenda, representing the first time a TWH-specific NORA has been created, builds on an earlier draft (Proposed National TWH Agenda) released by NIOSH’s Office for Total Worker Health in September 2014. NIOSH invited stakeholders to provide comment on this <b>draft</b> <b>agenda</b> related to the top priority research, practice, and policy issues to help advance worker safety, health, and well-being. In 2015, in response to stakeholder input received, the TWH definition was expanded and the TWH approach was more finely focused in the final Agenda. The refined description now present in the published Agenda better reflects the priorities of the program and helps to overcome the equating of TWH with traditional workplace wellness programs that fail to integrate worker protection elements. TWH continues to place priority upon a hazard-free work environment that protects the safety and health of all workers.

The decision should contain information relating to the tasks, terms and procedures of an add-hoc committee, meaning that the committee should operate only in very strict limitations set to the spheres of its investigation, the resources it may gain access to and also to the timeframes.The ultimate reason for existence of such committees is to deliver a report on its finding during a session of the National Assembly.

40|$|Thank {{you for the}} {{opportunity}} to review and provide comments on the <b>Draft</b> 2020 Action <b>Agenda</b> for Puget Sound. This is a very comprehensive document with significant and achievable actions in each of the priority areas. Many of the priority areas identified in the <b>Draft</b> Action <b>Agenda</b> are of course priorities for Environment Canada and other agencies north of the border. Given that the Puget Sound and Georgia Basin share a common airshed, common watersheds, a common home for migratory birds and fish, and common urban growth pressures, we recognize the importance of continued transboundary collaboration in addressing our shared challenges. To this end, we are pleased to see that one of the actions under Priority D is to “work cooperatively with Canada on management and scientific investigations to increase collaborative problem solving and information sharing ” (D. 3. 8). A good example of this collaboration is the Joint Statement of Cooperation on the Georgia Basin and Puget Sound Ecosystem, signed in 2000 by Environment Canada and the US Environmental Protection Agency (Region 10). We are also encouraged by the efforts to engage other “partners ” (cities, state agencies, Puget Sound tribes, etc.) in implementing Action Agenda priorities and look forward to exploring opportunities to share information and lessons learned with agencies and groups on this side o...|$|R
40|$|The Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) {{paradigm}} {{is having a}} substantial impact on the way software systems are developed. Although significant {{progress is being made}} in several fronts, there are not a set of clear, central themes to focus research activity. As a result, there is a danger that important research needs will be overlooked, while other efforts will focus on issues of peripheral long-term significance in practice. The objective of this workshop is to begin developing a long-term community-wide research agenda for the successful development of SOA-based systems. A tentative taxonomy of research issues will be presented, as well as papers that focus on specific parts of the taxonomy.

40|$|Background: Adherence {{to medical}} {{interventions}} {{is a global}} problem. With an increasing amount of partially effective but expensive drug treatments adherence is increasingly relevant in multiple sclerosis (MS). Perceived lack of efficacy and side effects as well as neuropsychiatric factors such as forgetfulness, fatigue and depression are major determinants. However, research on adherence to behavioural interventions as part of rehabilitative interventions has only rarely been studied. Methods: In a one-day meeting health researchers as well as patient representatives and other stakeholders discussed adherence issues in MS and developed a general <b>draft</b> research <b>agenda</b> within a focus group session. Results: The focus group addressed four major areas: (1) focussing patients and their informal team; (2) studying health care professionals; (3) comparing practice across cultures; and (4) studying new adherence interventions. Conclusions: A focus on patient preferences {{as well as a}} non-judgemental discussion on adherence issues with patients should be at the core of adherence work...|$|R

On 13 - 14 February 2016, a group of researchers and activists from fifteen countries met in Amsterdam. The aim was to jointly <b>draft</b> the research <b>agenda</b> of the New Politics Project, an initiative promoted by the Transnational Institute (TNI) in partnership with several other organisations and individuals from around the world. The invited participants came from political parties, trade unions, social movements, universities, research centres and universities in Europe, the Americas, Africa and Asia. The New Politics Project has been conceived as a decentralised think tank on counter-hegemonic politics that will support the joint production of ideas to: (a) boost the development of desirable, viable and achievable alternatives aimed at transcending current oppressive and exploitative structures; (b) acknowledge the diversity of knowledge as a source of inspiration for the co-creation of alternatives; and (c) promote fruitful collaboration and exchanges among researchers and activists from different regions of the world.

However, I wonder if Chinook population trends even provide a good indicator for the status and trends of other Puget Sound anadromous fish populations (steelhead, pink, chum, sockeye, coho, cutthroat and bull trout).
