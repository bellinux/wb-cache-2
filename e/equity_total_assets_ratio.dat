The independence between the firm’s investment and financing decisions is thus not possible. A sample of 808 firms belonging to the manufacturing sector was used.

40|$|This study {{examines}} the bank efficiency and {{the determinants of}} bank profitability of nine commercial banks in Singapore over the period 2005 - 2012. A two-stage Stochastic Frontier Approach is used to estimate the cost efficiency and the profit efficiency, and a fixed effect panel data analysis is applied to test the determinants of bank profitability. The findings indicate that the profit efficiency of Singaporean banks is more heavily impacted by the Global financial crisis than the cost efficiency. Large banks are more profit efficient and less cost efficient than small banks. The exogenous factors, bank size and the market share, are significantly positively related to the profit efficiency and negatively related to the cost efficiency. Overall, there is still room for Singaporean banks to improve their cost efficiency and profit efficiency. On the other hand, bank profitability of Singaporean banks is negatively affected by the <b>equity</b> to <b>total</b> <b>assets</b> <b>ratio,</b> cost to income ratio and bank size. In contrast, the improvement in the profit efficiency can be greatly in favour of bank profitability...|$|R

40|$|In {{response}} to the recent global financial crisis, the regulatory authorities in many countries have imposed stringent capital requirements {{in the form of}} the BASEL III Accord to ensure financial stability. On the other hand, bankers have criticized new regulation on the ground that it would enhance the cost of funds for bank borrowers and deteriorate the bank profitability. In this study, we examine the impact of capital requirements on the cost of financial intermediation and bank profitability using a panel dataset of 32 Bangladeshi banks over the period from 2000 to 2015. By employing a dynamic panel generalized method of moments (GMM) estimator, we find robust evidence that higher bank regulatory capital ratios reduce the cost of financial intermediation and increase bank profitability. The results hold when we use <b>equity</b> to <b>total</b> <b>assets</b> <b>ratio</b> as an alternative measure of bank capital. We also observe that switching from BASEL I to BASEL II has no measurable impact on the cost of financial intermediation and bank profitability in Bangladesh.

Determine the performance of the EU financial industry as a whole during the period of 2004 - 2006 and 2009 - 2011. The estimation results suggest that the profitability of financial institutions in EU affect not only by internal factors but also related to the external macroeconomic environment. Boundaries – Unlike other industries, financial sector is more complicated, some information would not disclose to the public, amount of data is not transparent, and so it becomes more difficult in the process of data collection. Plus the financial crisis, economic turmoil, instability enhancement, data would be more unstable and imprecise. Methodology- In this study, the approach is to use a multiple regression to analysis the determinants of profitability for financial institutions in EU. The sample comprises a total of 110 financial institutions (44 banks and 66 financial services), which covers 3960 observations.

In order to appraise and weigh up the soundness and reliability of banking industry, the information on the risk and how the fluctuations are managed are important to consider.

The primary objective {{of this study is to}} examine whether the mandatory adoption of IFRS in the EU has affected the structure of a specific set of Greek companies reporting under IFRS and under the Greek accounting system (GAS).

The study is based on their balance sheet and income statement figures prepared both under the GAS and IFRS model.

40|$|The public {{real estate}} market was {{initiated}} by the Real Estate Investment Trust Act of 1960. Since then, investors have been concerned with the assessment of performance comparisons between publicly held assets and privately held assets. The main concern for the assessment is to reveal historically which type of ownership provided the more efficient vehicle for the investors. The National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries (NCREIF) provides the investment performance of privately held commercial real estate, and the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trust (NAREIT) provides that of publicly held commercial real estate by REITs. However, direct comparison between the two indexes is problematic due to the different characteristics of each market {{and the lack of}} historical data for accurate assessment. The primary {{purpose of this study is}} to adjust characteristics of commercial REIT assets underlying one portfolio to match the characteristics of privately held commercial assets. Since SNL data base provides hedonic data from 1995 and CRSP & Compustat merged data base provides up to 2005 Q 4, the sample period of this research is from 1995 Q 1 to 2005 Q 4. This quarterly assessment is conducted at the property sector (retail, apartment, office and industrial), then at the aggregate level. The main research of this thesis is to create adjusted REIT equity index that is derived from the following treatments in the thesis. Pure-Play' Portfolio Methodology will be applied to replicate the performance of four real estate property-type sectors defined by NCREIF - Implemented updated <b>Equity</b> to <b>Total</b> <b>Asset</b> <b>ratio</b> from De-leveraging REIT returns by WACC formula based on CRSP and Compustat merged data to obtain the value weights of <b>equity,</b> debt and <b>total</b> <b>assets.</b> (cont.) As a proxy for the returns of debts held by REITs, Gilberto-Levy Historical Mortgage Rate will be used as a proxy for the returns of debts held by REITs. Sector-Mix Adjustment according to NCREIF sector weights. REIT index investment cost proxied by Vanguard REIT fund expense (95 - 05) will be deducted from adjusted REIT equity index. In this thesis, private real estate equity investment performance is represented by the MIT Transaction Based Index (TBI) and NCREIF Property Index (NPI). Both TBI and NPI returns are deducted by asset management fees estimated by the NFI-ODCE index (NCREIF) over the same time period. Purpose of these adjustments is to improve evaluation of publicly and privately held commercial real estate asset investment performances relative to one another. Preliminary comparison between NAREIT equity REIT index and NPI quarterly returns from 1995 - 2005 was conducted to collect the mean return difference. Then the difference after the treatments was compared to observe the effects of the author's method. The results demonstrate that at the aggregate level the difference between REIT and NPI returns reduced from 1. 08 % to 0. 74 %, and the difference between REIT and TBI returns reduced from 1. 64 % to 0. 18 %. by Dongwook Kim.
