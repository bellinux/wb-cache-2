40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine whether improvements could be made to increase the capture distance of traditional local exhaust ventilation (LEV) hoods by designing a circular slotted-hood. The criterion of success for this study was to achieve increases in capture velocity at an upstream distance equal to the diameter of the hood (11 inches). By increasing capture velocity further from the face, contaminant capture could take place at distances more convenient to the circular slotted-hood operator while maintaining adequate suction. This was to be achieved by the addition of two slots and a flange to a traditional conical <b>hood</b> <b>opening.</b> Three plates were designed to change the geometry of a plain conical hood (slot area: 0. 1334, 0. 0963 and 0. 0694 ft 2). They were tested at different airflow rates (243, 347, 467, 647, 897 cubic feet per minute) for a set number of distances from the hood face using a thermal anemometer. Three-dimensional maps of performance were created for visual comparisons, and t-tests were conducted to analyze performance by comparison of velocity at any point upstream of the hood. Velocity contours illustrated that two of the three designs had greater capture velocities compared to the standalone conical hood, and paired t-tests confirmed the significance (p 3 ̆c 0. 05). Each of the new designs failed to significantly increase capture distance further than 11 inches from the hood. However, increased velocities occurred near the <b>hood</b> <b>opening</b> (within 5 inches). These modest improvements for the largest slot design increases operating pressures by approximately 0. 12 ̆ 2 wg @ 250 cfm but 1. 12 ̆ 2 wg @ 650 cfm. Implementing these new designs would increase capture velocities close to the hood, although this advantage is offset by the cost it would require to compensate for the pressure loss incurred...|$|R
50|$|On {{passenger}} cars, a hood may be {{held down}} by a concealed latch. It is designed to protect a car from thefts, damage and sudden <b>hood</b> <b>opening</b> on the road. The hood release system is common on the most of vehicles and usually consists of interior hood latch handle, hood release cable and hood latch assembly. The hood latch handle is usually located below the steering wheel, beside the driver's seat or set into the door frame. When a driver pulls a hood latch handle the hood panel pops up and allows access to the engine compartment. On race cars or cars with aftermarket hoods (that do not use the factory latch system) the hood may be held down by hood pins. A hood may sometimes contain a hood ornament, hood scoop, power bulge, and/or wiper jets. Hoods are typically made out of steel, but aluminum is rapidly gaining popularity with auto companies. Aftermarket manufacturers may construct hoods out of fiberglass, carbon fiber, or dry carbon.|$|R
5000|$|The ﬁrst {{fume hood}} {{behavior}} {{intervention in the}} MIT Chemistry Department occurred mid-November 2006, when the Chemistry Department’s EHS Coordinator reinforced the importance of closing fume hood sashes at the regularly scheduled EHS laboratory representative meeting.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} CFD {{simulations}} of a reinforced exhaust system (the Aaberg exhaust hood in particular). The reinforced suction effect {{is achieved by}} means of radial jet release. The radial jet deforms the flow pattern {{in front of the}} hood to a directional flow pattern. Unfortunately, the presence of an obstacle, such as a welding bench, leads to a defective operation of the hood. A number of CFD simulations has been undertaken in order to assess the effect of the obstacle size, its distance to the hood, and the hood declination from the normal of the obstacle surface, on the flow pattern and consequently the capture efficiency of the hood. Capture efficiency of selected cases was evaluated. For the purpose of capture efficiency evaluation, a heat source was defined within the model that imitated a metal arc welding process and introduced similar heat input into the domain altogether with a release of a passive scalar. The scalar concentration was then evaluated at the <b>hood</b> <b>opening,</b> thus capture efficiency could be calculated. The results of simulations indicate that the hood operation depends on the spatial arrangement of the hood and the obstacle. The best performance was achieved when the hood axis was aligned with the obstacle surface normal or the misalignment was small. Greater misalignment can be tolerated when the obstacle size is smaller than the hoodtoobstacle distance only...|$|R

40|$|Existing {{approaches}} for saving energy in hoods are complicated and costly to implement, {{and do not}} address the worker safety issues inherent in the traditional fume hood design. Innovation is hampered by various barriers stemming from existing fume hood testing/rating procedures, entrenched rules of thumb, and ambiguous and often contradictory guidance on safe levels of airflow. To address the shortcomings of existing approaches and to promote innovation in the marketplace, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory has developed and patented a promising new technology [...] The Berkeley Hood [...] which uses a "push-pull" approach to contain fumes and move air. Small supply fans located {{at the top and}} bottom of the hood's face, push air into the hood and into the user's breathing zone, setting up an "air divider" at the <b>hood</b> <b>opening.</b> Consequently, the exhaust fan can be operated at a much lower flow rate. Because less air is flowing through the hood, the building's environmental conditioning system can be downsized, saving both energy and initial construction costs [...] offsetting the potential added cost of the Berkeley Hood.

In consequence, the simple classical statement “enzymes accelerate reactions by decreasing the free energy of activation” represents only half of the truth. Enzymatic reactions actually proceed through ‘gates’ of relatively low free energy {{but it is not the}} process of activated gate crossing that limits the reaction rate, but the process of generally non-activated gate <b>opening,</b> <b>controlled</b> by the conformational relaxation.
