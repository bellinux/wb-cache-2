5|$|A {{legal battle}} that began {{the same year}} {{interfered}} with the band's working on another release. Volcano Entertainment—the successor of Tool's by-then defunct label Zoo Entertainment—alleged contract violations by Tool and <b>filed</b> <b>a</b> lawsuit. According to Volcano, Tool had violated their contract when the band looked at offers from other record labels. After Tool <b>filed</b> <b>a</b> countersuit stating that Volcano had failed to use a renewal option in their contract, the parties settled out of court. In December 1998 Tool agreed to a new contract, a three-record joint venture deal. In 2000, the band dismissed their long-time manager Ted Gardner, who then sued the band over his commission on this lucrative agreement.|$|E

Nevertheless, Tirnanog and publisher Enterbrain were still allowed to publish the title, though they {{changed its name to}} Tear Ring Saga, and eventually developed a sequel.

5|$|In April 2001, the Schindlers <b>filed</b> <b>a</b> {{motion for}} relief from {{judgment}} citing new evidence of Terri Schiavo's wishes. Judge Greer denied the motion as untimely under Rule 1.540(b)(5) of the Florida Rules of Civil Procedure. The Second District Court of Appeal upheld Greer's decision but remanded {{the issue in}} order to give the Schindlers an opportunity to file a new motion. On April 24, 2001 Terri's feeding tube was removed for the first time. The Schindlers <b>filed</b> <b>a</b> civil suit against Michael Schiavo alleging perjury, which was assigned to another court. The judge, Frank Quesada, issued an injunction against the removal of feeding tube until this was settled. The feeding tube was reinserted on April 26, 2001. On appeal by Michael Schiavo, the Second District Court of Appeal reversed Judge Quesada's order. In the same time frame, Michael Schiavo <b>filed</b> <b>a</b> motion to enforce the mandate of the guardianship court (that the feeding tube be removed). The Second District Court of Appeal denied the motion. These three decisions, all published in a single order by Florida's Second District Court of Appeal, came to be known by the court as Schiavo II in its later rulings.|$|E

In 2015, the new filing fees for the JCPC were noted as ranging from between £400 to a £5,000 or roughly US$600 to US$7,500 while the comparable fees for the CCJ remained at US$60 thus making the cost of <b>filing</b> <b>an</b> appeal with the JCPC at least ten times greater than <b>filing</b> <b>an</b> appeal with the CCJ.|$|R
