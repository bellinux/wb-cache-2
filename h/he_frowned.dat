500|$|A common {{point of}} {{criticism}} was the inventory system, which Sanchez called [...] "a pain". <b>He</b> <b>frowned</b> upon the player's need to retrieve objects from item boxes, and Mac Donald criticized {{the system for}} being unrealistic, as the boxes are [...] "" [...] interconnected and all items take {{the same amount of}} space when being carried, regardless of their size. Furthermore, Mallinson and Mac Donald disapproved of certain puzzles, which they believed were out of place in a police station setting. Sanchez thought that the puzzles were paced better than in the first game, but also found them less interesting and too easy for experienced players. Sackenheim noted the game's brevity in his review, and remarked that the individual scenarios are not different enough to hold the interest of casual players {{until the end of the}} game. He found the controls to be [...] "easy to pick up and play", while Sanchez thought that aiming weapons was difficult. Certain reviewers panned the voice acting, calling it [...] "cheesy", [...] "terrible" [...] and [...] "barbaric".|$|E

6000|$|MURRAY (offended). What do {{you mean}} by everything? You said that so strangely. You mean you don't believe---- (But she remains silent with her eyes shut. <b>He</b> <b>frowns</b> and takes to pacing up and down beside the bed.)

60|$|STEPHEN: (Brings {{the match}} near his eye) Lynx eye. Must get glasses. Broke them yesterday. Sixteen years ago. Distance. The eye sees all flat. (He draws the match away. It goes out.)

6000|$|... "Yes, {{that is what}} he is," [...] said Noel Rainguesson, convincingly. [...] "He is a terror; and {{not just}} in this vicinity.

5000|$|Chamberlain {{regarded}} James as extravagant, and a poor {{judge of}} men.

60|$|Are the {{properties}} of the commons of this kingdom better secured by the knight-errantry of that day? In the name of common sense, what are we to believe?
