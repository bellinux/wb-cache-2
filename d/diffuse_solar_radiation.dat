Additionally, analysis results concerning a plant shoot configuration interaction with direct <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> were taken from a past study. However, in order to consider a plant shoot as a received sunlight system, {{it is necessary to}} understand the received light characteristics of both direct <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> and <b>diffused</b> <b>solar</b> <b>radiation.</b> Under a clear sky, the ratio of direct <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> to <b>diffused</b> <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> is large.

Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the received light characteristics of a plant shoot configuration under the influence of <b>diffused</b> <b>solar</b> <b>radiation.</b> As a result, we clarify the relationship between the amount of <b>diffused</b> <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> and the amount of received light {{as a function of the}} characteristics of the plant shoot configuration.

In this study, {{for the first}} time, we performed an extensive investigation {{of the effects of}} aerosols {{and atmospheric}} particles on plant leaf proteins by combining Geographic Information System and proteomic approaches. Data on particles with diameters of 0. 1 - 1. 0 μm (PM 1) from different locations across the city of Beijing and the aerosol optical depth (AOD) over the past 6 years (2007 - 2012) were collected. In order to make the study more reliable, we segregated the influence of soil pollution by measuring the heavy metal content. On the basis of AOD and PM 1, two regions corresponding to strong and weak <b>diffuse</b> <b>solar</b> <b>radiations</b> were selected for analyzing the changes in the expression of plant proteins. Our results demonstrated that in areas with strong <b>diffuse</b> <b>solar</b> <b>radiations,</b> plant ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase was expressed at higher levels, but oxygen evolved in enhancer protein and light-harvesting complex II protein were expressed at lower levels. The expression of ATP synthase subunit beta and chlorophyll a-b binding protein were similar in both regions.
