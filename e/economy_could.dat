5|$|During the war, Italy stopped {{building}} cruisers, since destroyers, submarines, {{and smaller}} patrol vessels were more useful in operations against the Austro-Hungarians. After the war, the anemic Italian <b>economy</b> <b>could</b> not support significant naval construction programs. Additionally, Italy had received several modern light cruisers from the defeated Germans and Austro-Hungarians, and these ships formed {{the backbone of}} the Italian cruiser force.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, {{prior to the}} {{construction}} of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, the Fairbanks economy was unsteady. The News-Miner planned to expand its printing plant, but many in the company were unsure if the <b>economy</b> <b>could</b> support the added capacity. Over the objections of the News-Miner newsroom, Snedden decided to expand the Aurora Building by adding a second floor at a cost of $2 million. In 1974, as construction of the pipeline got under way, demand for office space in Fairbanks was so great that Alyeska Pipeline Company rented several News-Miner offices in the newly expanded building. About this time, the News-Miner replaced its Associated Press teletypes with a satellite connection.|$|E
5|$|The {{political}} corruption which had grown considerably during Brezhnev's tenure {{had become a}} major problem to the Soviet Union's economic development by the 1980s. In response, Andropov initiated a nationwide anti-corruption campaign. Andropov believed that the Soviet <b>economy</b> <b>could</b> possibly recover if the government were able to increase social discipline amongst workers. Brezhnev was seen as very vain and self-obsessed, but was praised for leading the Soviet Union into an unprecedented age of stability and domestic calm.|$|E
30|$|Regulatory {{convergence}} {{and cooperation}} among {{the authorities in}} the field of medical products (medicines and medical devices) are essential to deliver safe and efficacious products quickly to patients. APEC established the Regulatory Harmonization Steering Committee (RHSC) to advance this cause among member economies. This paper identifies four areas of appropriate regulatory practice in which APEC <b>economies</b> <b>could</b> converge, and explores the feasible processes of how APEC <b>economies</b> <b>could</b> cooperate in order to bring about realization of a maximum level of regulatory convergence by 2020.|$|R

30|$|This paper {{identified}} {{four areas}} of appropriate regulatory practice in which APEC <b>economies</b> <b>could</b> converge. The four areas {{are related to}} the use of (1) Certificate of Pharmaceutical Product (CPP); (2) the Pharmaceutical Inspection Co-operation Scheme (PIC/S) membership; (3) managing multiple sites in one license; and (4) risk-based reliance evaluation system. These four areas could be explored together with the feasible processes of how APEC <b>economies</b> <b>could</b> cooperate that would facilitate the defining or development of key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure the progress of convergence to assess whether “the regulatory requirements across economies become more similar or ‘aligned’ over time” (APEC RHSC Vision 2020).|$|R
5|$|Along {{with the}} rising {{importance}} of a central administration arose {{a new class of}} educated scribes and officials who were granted estates by the pharaoh in payment for their services. Pharaohs also made land grants to their mortuary cults and local temples, to ensure that these institutions had the resources to worship the pharaoh after his death. Scholars believe that five centuries of these practices slowly eroded the economic power of the pharaoh, and that the <b>economy</b> <b>could</b> no longer afford to support a large centralized administration. As the power of the pharaoh diminished, regional governors called nomarchs began to challenge the supremacy of the pharaoh. This, coupled with severe droughts between 2200 and 2150BC, is assumed to have caused the country to enter the 140-year period of famine and strife known as the First Intermediate Period.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, {{work began}} on the Central Valley Project (CVP), a federal water project that would develop the Sacramento and San Joaquin river systems for {{irrigation}} of the highly fertile Central Valley. However, {{after the end of}} World War II in 1945, the state experienced an economic boom that led to rapid urban and commercial growth in the central and southern portions of the state, and it became clear that California's <b>economy</b> <b>could</b> not depend solely on a state water system geared primarily towards agriculture. A new study of California's water supplies by the Division of Water Resources (now California Department of Water Resources, DWR) was carried out under an act of the California State Legislature in 1945.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} efforts to prepare the country militarily, the <b>economy</b> <b>could</b> not sustain a lengthy war of {{attrition}} such as had occurred in World War I. A strategy was developed based on the tactic of Blitzkrieg ("lightning war"), which involved using quick coordinated assaults that avoided enemy strong points. Attacks began with artillery bombardment, followed by bombing and strafing runs. Next the tanks would attack and finally the infantry would move in to secure any ground that had been taken. Victories continued through mid-1940, but the failure to defeat Britain {{was the first major}} turning point in the war. The decision to attack the Soviet Union and the decisive defeat at Stalingrad led to the retreat of the German armies and the eventual loss of the war. The total number of soldiers who served in the Wehrmacht from 1935 to 1945 was around 18.2 million, of whom 5.3 million died.|$|E

5|$|The Americans, British, and French all {{differed}} on {{the issue}} of reparations settlement. The Western Front had been fought in France, and that countryside had been heavily scarred in the fighting. France's most industrialized region in the north-east had been laid to waste during the German retreat. Hundreds of mines and factories were destroyed along with railroads, bridges and villages. Georges Clemenceau, the Prime Minister of France, thought it appropriate that any just peace required Germany to pay reparations for the damage they had caused. He also saw reparations as a means to ensure that Germany could not again threaten France and as well to weaken the German ability to compete with France's industrialization. Reparations would also go towards the reconstruction costs in other countries, such as Belgium, also directly affected by the war. British Prime Minister David Lloyd George opposed harsh reparations in favour of a less crippling reparations settlement so that the German <b>economy</b> <b>could</b> remain a viable economic power and British trading partner. He furthermore argued that reparations should include war pensions for disabled veterans and allowances to be paid to war widows, which would, reserve a larger share of the reparations for the British Empire. Wilson opposed these positions, and was adamant that there be no indemnity imposed upon Germany.|$|E
5|$|The Army was {{considerably}} expanded in early 1942 {{in response to}} the Japanese threat to Australia. During this year the Army's strength peaked at eleven infantry divisions and three armoured divisions, and in August 1942 the Army had a strength of 476,000 men. This force was larger than Australia's population and <b>economy</b> <b>could</b> sustain, and its strength was reduced {{in the second half of}} the year. Militia units were able to serve outside of Australian territory in the South West Pacific Area from January 1943 after the Defence (Citizen Military Forces) Act 1943 was passed, but few did so. The Army was further reduced by 100,000 members from October 1943 to free up manpower for industry. At the end of 1943 the Army's strength was set at six infantry divisions and two armoured brigades, although further reductions were ordered in August 1944 and June 1945. The Australian Army generally had a long-standing policy of using British-designed equipment, but equipment from Australia, the United States and some other countries was introduced into service in the war's later years. Pre-war doctrine was focused on conventional warfare in a European environment and the Army did not have any doctrine for jungle warfare prior to 1943. In early 1943 the Army developed a jungle warfare doctrine by adapting the pre-war field service regulations to meet the conditions in the South West Pacific.|$|E

25|$|Folklorists today {{consider}} the 1920s the Soviet Union's {{golden age of}} folklore. The struggling new government, which had to focus its efforts on establishing a new administrative system and building up the nation's backwards <b>economy,</b> <b>could</b> not be bothered with attempting to control literature, so studies of folklore thrived. There were two primary trends of folklore study during the decade: the formalist and Finnish schools. Formalism focused on the artistic form of ancient byliny and faerie tales, specifically their use of distinctive structures and poetic devices. The Finnish school was concerned with connections amongst related legends of various Eastern European regions. Finnish scholars collected comparable tales from multiple locales and analyzed their similarities and differences, hoping to trace these epic stories’ migration paths.|$|E

He advocated a more pragmatic approach known as the one country, two systems policy, in which Hong Kong (as well as Macau, and potentially also Taiwan) would be able to retain their economic systems within the PRC. On 19 December 1984, the Sino-British Joint Declaration on the Question of Hong Kong (The Joint Declaration) was signed between the PRC and UK governments. Under this agreement, Hong Kong would cease to be a British Dependent Territory on 1 July 1997 and would thenceforth be a Special Administrative Region (SAR) of the PRC. Citizens opposed to the handover led to the first wave of emigration.|$|E

Sensing an immediate threat from foreigners and realising that China's agricultural-based <b>economy</b> <b>could</b> not hope to compete with the industrial prowess of the West, Cixi decided {{that for the first time}} in Chinese history, China would learn from the Western powers and import their knowledge and technology. At the time, three prominent Han Chinese officials, Zeng Guofan, Li Hongzhang and Zuo Zongtang, had all begun industrial programs in the country's southern regions. In supporting these programmes, Cixi also decreed the opening of the Tongwen Guan in 1862, a school for foreign languages in Beijing. The Tongwen Guan specialised in new-age topics such as astronomy and mathematics, as well as the English, French and Russian languages. Groups of young boys were also sent abroad to the United States for studies.|$|E

40|$|Abstract This paper {{uses the}} method of {{structural}} vector autoregressions to decompose movements of real output and prices into demand and supply innovations for four Caribbean economies: Barbados, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, and Guyana.

Correlations between the demand and supply innovations are, however, typically low, indicating that monetary union may lead to greater stabilisation problems for these economies.
