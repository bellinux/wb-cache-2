40|$|Here we {{show that}} ionic liquids (ILs), protic or aprotic in nature {{containing}} a phosphate anion, {{can be used as}} effective <b>impregnating</b> <b>compounds</b> resulting in a 50 % improvement of the carbon yield of cellulose based carbon fibres and a 70 &# 0176;C reduction in the onset of the depolymerization temperature. Using 13 C NMR and FTIR spectra, we characterize the carbonized fibres with and without IL impregnates. The oxidative step in the formation of carbon fibres from cellulose precursors is very important in determining the final material properties, as such we examine this stage and show that the IL reduces the onset of the cellulose depolymerization temperature while improving the oxidative stability. This study highlights the ability of ILs to act as novel impregnates which can successfully reduce the formation of tar and volatile substances during carbonization of cellulose based carbon fibres resulting in an improved carbon yield and significant cost savings due to reduced maintenance and wear of equipment...|$|R
50|$|Incipient wetness {{impregnation}} (IW or IWI), {{also called}} capillary impregnation or dry impregnation, is a commonly used technique for {{the synthesis of}} heterogeneous catalysts. Typically, the active metal precursor is dissolved in an aqueous or organic solution. Then the metal-containing solution is added to a catalyst support containing the same pore volume as {{the volume of the}} solution that was added. Capillary action draws the solution into the pores. Solution added in excess of the support pore volume causes the solution transport to change from a capillary action process to a diffusion process, which is much slower. The catalyst can then be dried and calcined to drive off the volatile components within the solution, depositing the metal on the catalyst surface. The maximum loading is limited by the solubility of the precursor in the solution. The concentration profile of the <b>impregnated</b> <b>compound</b> depends on the mass transfer conditions within the pores during impregnation and drying.|$|R
50|$|Since the {{introduction}} of the 3-ring system, variations in the design have raised safety concerns. For example, the move to mini rings and mini risers caused riser failures on some designs until riser strength was improved. The failure of some manufacturers to include stiff riser inserts and other hard housing cable guides to allow the free movement of the cutaway cable when risers and webbing are twisted has caused difficulty in cutting away from malfunctions with riser twists or harness deformations. The tolerance in the manufacture of the fabric risers and their connection to the rings is critical in maintaining the mechanical advantage of the 3-ring system and this has been compromised in some designs. Reversed risers placing the rings under the risers has prevented the rings moving freely and releasing under some cutaway scenarios. Replacement of the Lolon-F coating with Teflon <b>impregnated</b> <b>compounds</b> has caused both cracking and cable stripping problems.|$|R

Despite a marked difference in the microstructure of the impregnated KNO 3 and MnOx, both impregnations caused a significant reduction in the polarization resistance of the electrodes, due to a general decrease in resistance of all the identified electrode processes.

In this work, impregnation of phytol {{as a model}} compound and multicomponent Clinacanthus nutans (C. nutans) plant extracts into alginate and silica aerogels was investigated, applying two different methods: wet impregnation and supercritical impregnation. Two types of C. nutans extracts were prepared by microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) using either ethanol-water solvent mixtures or pure ethanol as solvent. The <b>impregnated</b> <b>compounds</b> were analyzed by Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and chromatography (HPLC and UPLC–MS/MS). Results showed that supercritical impregnation method yielded the highest loading content with silica aerogels, with a content of 30. 1 ± 0. 6 wt% of the model compound phytol, and 11. 5 ± 0. 4 and 23. 9 ± 1. 0 wt% of the extracts obtained with ethanol/water and pure ethanol solvents, respectively. In the wet impregnation method, alginate aerogels exhibited higher loading than the silica aerogels regardless of their surface area properties, indicating {{that in this case}} other properties of carrier materials and the nature of compounds have a stronger influence on the compounds loading than the surface properties of the carrier. Impregnation in alginate aerogels yielded higher total phenols and flavonoids contents than in silica aerogels. Plasticized alginate biopolymer was formed when the supercritical impregnation was performed with excess of phytol at 200 bar and 40 °C, indicating that the swelling and/or plasticizing effect of SCCO 2 was remarkable combined with the effect of excess solute. Release kinetics results indicate that the alginate aerogel impregnated with the extract obtained with pure ethanol is suitable for controlled drug release whereas the alginate aerogel impregnated with the ethanol/water extract is more appropriate for fast release purposes. The release kinetics results were fitted into several mathematical models: zero order, first order and Higuchi model, to evaluate the mechanism of the release.

The concentration of the compound will be highest next to the disk, and will decrease as distance from the disk increases.

This is the zone of inhibition. This along with the rate of antibiotic diffusion are used to estimate the bacteria's sensitivity to that particular antibiotic. In general, larger zones correlate with smaller minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of antibiotic for that bacteria. Inhibition produced by the test is compared with that produced by known concentration of a reference compound. This information can be used to choose appropriate antibiotics to combat a particular infection.|$|R

Mineral composition, silver sorption/desorption, and strength are the important characteristics that influence effectiveness and durability of CWFs during transport and use. Laboratory tests were conducted on ceramic samples obtained from five CWF factories around the world to determine their mineral composition, silver sorption/desorption, and flexural strength. The results of this study showed that clays that contain traces of crystalline albite or crystalline pyroxene have better sorption of silver species than those that do not. The results showed that the Freundlich model provided the best fit for both ionic silver and silver nanoparticles for all of the ceramic materials that were tested. Thus, this model can be used to optimize the manufacturing process and the application of silver. Silver nanoparticles were desorbed more slowly than ionic silver, so they last longer in the ceramic material. Water that contains a high concentration of divalent ions is not recommended for preparing solutions of silver nanoparticles due to aggregation of the particles, which limits their sorption by the ceramic materials.

40|$|It {{has often}} been {{suggested}} that fullerenes or fullerene-related nanoparticles might {{be used for the}} encapsulation of radioactive materials. If the resulting nanocapsules were shown to be stable, this might provide a new method of nuclear waste disposal. Alternatively, radioisotopes encapsulated in carbon nanoparticles might be useful as tracers or in nuclear medicine. These possibilities have led a number of groups to experiment with the encapsulation of various radioactive atoms inside fullerenes. Actinide carbides encapsulated in carbon nanoparticles have also been prepared and {{have been shown to be}} stable for up to one year. To date, the nanocapsules have been prepared using a modification of the arc-evaporation technique for fullerene synthesis.

It was {{observed that the}} substances showed different behavior of As absorption on short and long time contact. On long time contact periods the absorption capacities are much increased with high concentrations of As in solution. However with short time contact with low As concentration, the materials show saturation or no absorption after certain time period. Thus variable capacities for As absorption are shown depending on concentration, time of absorp-tion and interval time between two contact periods. As (III) absorption was studied in the pH range 2. 45 - 7. 0. The data also show that with a contact time of 3 hrs. or more, the level of As is reduced to the acceptable limit of 0. 05 ppm in water. High concentration of phosphate in water decreases as absorption as phosphate is also strongly absorbed by iron oxide impregnated brick particles. Leaching of loaded arsenic from brick particles using different common chemicals was also studied for ferrous sulfate treated roasted brick particles. Out of the solutions of common chemicals (10 % caustic soda, 20 % sodium chloride, 10 % sodium car-bonate, 10 % potassium dihydrogen phosphate, 10 % TSP and 5 % NH 3) only 10 % caustic soda can leach ~ 95 % As from As loaded brick particles and others much less.

While BTH {{did not affect}} uredospore germination and fungal penetration in the substomatal cavity, a first impairment to the colonization appeared evident about 48 - 96 h after inoculation, with alterations of infection hypha structure and reduction in mycelium expansion. No {{differences were found in}} this phase regarding the formation and ultrastructure of haustoria in untreated and BTH-treated plants, except for the deposition of electron-opaque material in the extrahaustorial matrix of the latter. A second and decisive impairment in fungal progression was observed at 7 - 10 days after inoculation when host cell penetrated, or in close contact with the fungal hyphae, were <b>impregnated</b> by phenolic <b>compounds.</b> The same was observed in fungal walls, particularly around haustoria, thus hampering the biotrophic habitus of the fungus and further mycelium spreading. This, in turn, prevented the evasion of fungal reproductive structures, the uredinia, and the appearance of visible symptoms. No particular ultrastructural alterations were observed in most of the penetrated cells, even at late stages of infection, indicating that BTH treatment does not induce host cells to respond with a hypersensitive reaction (HR). A parallel time course of the expression of phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) gene, the key enzyme for the synthesis of phenylpropanoidic phytoalexins and many other phenolics, has shown that PAL mRNA is strongly and persistently transcripted in BTH-treated plants since the 6 th h after treatment, though no apparent ultrastructural alterations were detectable up to some days after pathogen challenging. This indicates that BTH, at the employed concentration of 0. 3 mM, directly activates the plant's own defences, thus accounting for the observed full protection against bean rust...|$|R
40|$|Zeolite {{membranes}} {{can potentially}} {{be used for}} the separation of many types of mixtures. The membranes can be tailored by a number of methods to suit a specific separation application. In this work both traditional and new innovative methods were used to tailor the properties of membranes in order to enhance the selectivity for a given separation. Traditional methods to tailor zeolite membranes include; choice of zeolite framework, adjustment of Si/Al ratio and choice of counterion. In zeolite catalysts the properties are often also tailored by incorporating metal or metal oxide clusters in the zeolite pores by impregnation. In this work the traditional methods for membrane tailoring by adjusting the Si/Al-ratio and exchanging the counterions have been used. In addition, a new method where the impregnation concept often used in catalyst preparation is adapted to tailor the properties of zeolite membranes, was used. The polarity of a zeolite can be tailored by changing the Si/Al ratio, and to facilitate the separation of polar and non polar molecure e. g. H 2 O and H 2, the Si/Al ratio should be relatively low. In the present work, separation of mixtures of H 2 O, H 2 and n-hexane was investigated for membranes with two different Si/Al ratios (silicalite- 1 and ZSM- 5), in the temperature range 25 to 350 C. The highest separation factors H 2 O/H 2 were observed at 25 C and were 14. 3 and 19. 7 for silicalite- 1 and ZSM- 5, respectively. The membranes were selective also at 100 C and the separation factors were about 3. 2 and 6 for silicalite- 1 and ZSM- 5, respectively. These results confirm that the selectivity for this separation can be controlled by changing the polarity the zeolite. The aim of the new and innovative modification procedure was to prepare CO 2 selective membranes with high flux. The pores of a silicalite- 1 membrane were <b>impregnated</b> with calcium <b>compounds</b> to aid the chemisorption of CO 2, which is essential to achieve a membrane which is CO 2 selective even at high temperatures. The result of the impregnation was evaluated by separation of CO 2 and H 2. Calcined membranes were impregnated with a solution of Ca(NO 3) 2 in methanol and heated to 600 to thermally decompose the Ca(NO 3) 2 Calcium compounds were evenly distributed in the pores of the silicalite- 1 film and there were also some relatively large CaCO 3 crystals on the surface. The separation experiments with of mixtures of CO 2 and H 2 showed that the separation factor CO 2 /H 2 at 25 C was drastically changed from 0. 7 (H 2 selective) to 3. 7 (CO 2 selective) by this modification. These results show that the properties of the H 2 selective silicalite- 1 membrane could be tailored by impregnation to prepare a CO 2 selective membrane. Godkänd; 2006; 20061120 (pafi...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{for the work}} described in this PhD thesiswas to formulate a friction model to characterize thefrictional behavior of paper. More specifically, the modelshould explain a phenomenon that is typical for paper grades,viz. : {{that the level of}} paper-to-paper friction is dependent onthe direction and the number of previous slides. The modelshould also explain the lubricating effect oflow-molecular-mass lipophilic compounds (LLC) that occur inpaper on paper-to-paper friction. Furthermore, the model shoulddescribe the types of forces that influence paper-to-paperfiction and explain the mechanism by which the LLC decreasepaper-to-paper friction. This thesis consists of a literature review of the basicconcepts of tribology and a summary of the main results andconclusions from four studies on the frictional characteristicsof paper and a study on the friction and adhesion of cellulosesurfaces together with some unpublished material. The purpose of the investigation described in the firstpaper was to explain a phenomenon that is typical for papergrades, viz. : the level of paper-to-paper friction is dependenton the direction and the number of previous slides. Thisbehavior is called 9 ̆ 3 friction hysteresis 9 ̆ 4 by theauthors, and it has its origin in the reorientation of thefibers on the surface of a paper and their alignment relativeto the sliding direction. The second paper describes a study that was aimed atidentifying lubricants that occur natively in paper. Filterpapers were <b>impregnated</b> with model <b>compounds</b> representing woodextractives, i. e. low-molecular-weight lipophilic compounds,which are present in wood, pulp and paper, and thepaper-to-paper friction was determined. The results of thatstudy show that a wood extractive must fulfill severalstructural criteria in order to lubricate a paper surface: Itmust have a hydrophilic group that can attach to the papersurface and a linear hydrocarbon backbone of sufficientlength. Although it is not specifically stated in the second paper,the authors proposed a type of lubrication by which woodextractives decrease paper-to-paper friction that is, ineffect, boundary lubrication. The purpose of the investigationdescribed in the third paper was to clarify whether woodextractives and other low-molecular-mass lipophilic compoundsthat occur in paper can act as boundary lubricants on papersurfaces. The {{main objective}} of that study was to investigatethe role of chemical structure of LLC for their orientationrelative to the paper surface, which is an important criterionfor boundary lubrication. Filter papers were impregnated withmagnesium salts of different lipophilic acids, which were usedfor model compounds for the LLC. The deposited layers ofmagnesium salts were characterized by X-ray photoelectronspectroscopy (XPS) and contact angle goniometry and thefriction of the impregnated paper sheets was determined. Theresults show that the degree of lubrication and the resistanceto wear of the layers of a magnesium salt increased withincreasing chain length and increasing degree of linearity ofthe lipophilic acid. Based on the results of that study and ofearlier studies, it is concluded that boundary lubrication isthe type of lubrication by which low-molecular-mass lipophiliccompounds that occur natively in paper decreasepaper-to-paper-friction. In boundary lubrication, surfaces are covered withmonolayers of lubricant molecules that comprise an active headgroup that can attach to the surface, e. g. a carboxyl group,and an inert linear backbone, such as a long saturatedhydrocarbon chain. Such compounds form ordered monolayers onsurfaces, so that the backbone points vertically out of planeof the surface. The friction is then determined by theinteractions between the monolayers, which are weaker than theinteractions between the clean surfaces and this gives a lowerfriction. The fourth paper describes a study on the origin of thedifferences in friction levels between different linerboardsbased on recycled fiber (old corrugated container, OCC). Thesheets were subjected to two extraction stages and analyzedwith respect to surface roughness and their content oflow-molecular-mass lipophilic compounds (LLC). The resultsshowed that a high amount of LLC in the sheets lead to lowfriction, due to lubrication. The fifth paper describes a study that was aimed atdetermining the types of forces that influence the frictionbetween the surfaces of hydrophilic polymers and explaining themechanism by which boundary lubricants decrease the friction. The adhesion and the friction of model systems was measuredwith atomic force microscopy (AFM) using regenerated cellulosefilms and functionalised AFM tips and the effect of fatty acidsand humidity was investigated. The friction significantlyincreased with increasing humidity and that there was a strongcorrelation between the ability of a fatty acid to form ahydrophobic surface and its lubricating performance. Measuredadhesion forces at high humidity were well predicted bytheoretical models that took into account the effect of theLaplace pressure acting in a water meniscus formed aroundcontact regions due to capillary condensation. The resultsindicated that the degree of capillary condensation may beeffectively suppressed by increasing the hydrophobicity of thecontacting surfaces, causing adhesion and friction to decrease. These results suggest that friction between paper surfacesunder ambient conditions is greatly influenced by the degree ofcapillary condensation. Furthermore, lubrication by fatty acidsis achieved by the formation of a vertically oriented,hydrophobic monolayer that can withstand the stresses duringsliding and increase the hydrophobicity of the paper surfaceand thereby suppress capillary condensation.
