25|$|Some {{research}} has found {{the average length of}} abstinence for bulimics in OA was significantly higher than the average length for binge eaters. Paradoxically, bulimics were also found to attend fewer meetings, and had less of a commitment to write their thoughts and feelings down daily. However, the frequency of relapse for bulimics and binge eaters was not significantly different. The differences may be explained by the predictable nature of the bulimic cycle. Other {{research has}} found binge eaters in OA had better success than bulimics. Most OA members who have reported negative experiences in the program are anorexic. This could be caused by OA's focus on problems of <b>eating</b> <b>too</b> much rather than too little. Some OA practices, such as refraining from eating certain kinds of foods, are antithetical in the case of anorexics. Though, most anorexics have a previous history of bulimia.|$|E

500|$|Humans have {{interacted with}} giraffes for millennia. The San people of {{southern}} Africa have medicine dances named after some animals; the giraffe dance is performed to treat head ailments. How the giraffe got its height {{has been the}} subject of various African folktales, including one from eastern Africa which explains that the giraffe grew tall from <b>eating</b> <b>too</b> many magic herbs. Giraffes were depicted in art throughout the African continent, including that of the Kiffians, Egyptians and Meroë Nubians. The Kiffians were responsible for a life-size rock engraving of two giraffes that has been called the [...] "world's largest rock art petroglyph". The Egyptians gave the giraffe its own hieroglyph, named 'sr' in Old Egyptian and 'mmy' in later periods. They also kept giraffes as pets and shipped them around the Mediterranean.|$|E

[...] JC's Girls {{members have been}} criticized for dressing like sex workers, a look that Veitch said is intended to help women in the sex industry identify with the group. A Baptist minister from San Bernardino, California criticized JC's Girls for not explicitly encouraging women in the sex industry to quit, and quoted , a Bible verse that states that a person cannot serve two masters. In response to the idea that strippers should quit their jobs before attending a church, Veitch said, [...] "Do we ask gluttons to stop <b>eating</b> <b>too</b> much before they come to church?" [...] Philip Sherwell of the Calgary Herald called the evangelism of JC's Girls [...] "America's most unusual Christian outreach operation".|$|E
500|$|All hay and {{concentrated}} feeds {{must be kept}} dry and free of mold, rodent feces, {{and other types of}} contamination that may cause illness in horses. Feed kept outside or otherwise exposed to moisture can develop mold quite quickly. [...] Due to fire hazards, hay is often stored under an open shed or under a tarp, rather than inside a horse barn itself, but should be kept under some kind of cover. [...] Concentrates take up less storage space, are less of a fire hazard, and are usually kept in a barn or enclosed shed. [...] A secure door or latched gate between the animals and any feed storage area is critical. [...] Horses accidentally getting into stored feed and <b>eating</b> <b>too</b> much at one time is a common but preventable way that horses develop colic or laminitis. [...] (see Illnesses related to improper feeding below) ...|$|E
500|$|Kafka's {{laryngeal}} tuberculosis worsened and in March 1924 {{he returned}} from Berlin to Prague, where members of his family, principally his sister Ottla, took care of him. He went to Dr. Hoffmann's sanatorium in Kierling just outside Vienna for treatment on 10 April, and died there on 3 June 1924. The cause of death seemed to be starvation: the condition of Kafka's throat made <b>eating</b> <b>too</b> painful for him, and since parenteral nutrition {{had not yet been}} developed, {{there was no way to}} feed him. Kafka was editing [...] "A Hunger Artist" [...] on his deathbed, a story whose composition he had begun before his throat closed to the point that he could not take any nourishment. His body was brought back to Prague where he was buried on 11 June 1924, in the New Jewish Cemetery in Prague-Žižkov. Kafka was unknown during his own lifetime, but he did not consider fame important. He became famous soon after his death. The Kafka tombstone was designed by architect Leopold Ehrmann.|$|E

It is usually eaten lukewarm with different jams, typically cloudberry, cherries or strawberry though lingonberry is often used, as well as fruits, whipped cream or, more rarely, ice cream. The reason for eating ostkaka while it is lukewarm is that if <b>eaten</b> <b>too</b> warm, the delicate flavors of the ostkaka will not come through, and if <b>eaten</b> <b>too</b> cold the consistency will be too firm and heavy.|$|R

500|$|Horses {{can become}} anxious or {{stressed}} {{if there are}} {{long periods of time}} between meals. They also do best when they are fed on a regular schedule; they are creatures of habit and easily upset by changes in routine. [...] When horses are in a herd, their behavior is hierarchical; the higher-ranked animals in the herd eat and drink first. [...] Low-status animals, who eat last, may not get enough food, and if there is little available feed, higher-ranking horses may keep lower-ranking ones from eating at all. [...] Therefore, unless a herd is on pasture that meets the nutritional needs of all individuals, it is important to either feed horses separately, or spread [...] feed out in separate areas to be sure all animals get roughly equal amounts of food to eat. [...] In some situations where horses are kept together, they may still be placed into separate herds, depending on nutritional needs; overweight horses are kept separate from thin horses so that rations may be adjusted accordingly. [...] Horses may also eat in undesirable ways, such as bolting their feed, or <b>eating</b> <b>too</b> fast. [...] This can lead to either choke or colic under some circumstances.|$|E
500|$|In 2006, a Baptist {{minister}} from San Bernardino, California criticized JC's Girls for not explicitly encouraging {{women in the}} sex industry to quit.

500|$|MacDonald {{indicates}} Potter {{was particularly}} {{sensitive to the}} openings and closings of her books (she insisted Benjamin Bunny end with the term [...] "rabbit-tobacco", for example), and, in the Flopsy Bunnies, the opening reflects her flair for the elevated diction sometimes encountered in her other books: [...] "It is said the effect of <b>eating</b> <b>too</b> much lettuce is 'soporific'." [...] Though the word 'soporific' is not generally encountered in literature for young children, Potter is aware of her audience's limitations and not only defines the word immediately but places it in context: [...] "I have never felt sleepy after eating lettuces; but then I am not a rabbit." [...] She not only defines the word, but introduces rabbits as her subject. The line does not draw attention to itself (though Potter is intruding herself into the narrative), but rather gives the tale a conversational tone or {{a sense of the}} story being told aloud by a narrator. Because she immediately brings the audience's attention back to the rabbits, there is no danger she will become a character in the tale, and she is invisible through the remainder of the tale.|$|E
