It is often stated that ulceration is exacerbated during examination periods and lessened <b>during</b> <b>periods</b> of vacation.

40|$|ABSTRACT One hundred sixty-two dwarf broiler breeder {{females were}} each inseminated at 4 -wk {{intervals}} with either 30, 60, or 120 million spermatozoa repeated on 2 consecutive days. The experiment {{was conducted at}} two age periods, i. e., 32 to 41 wk (Period I) and 55 to 63 wk (<b>Period</b> II). Females <b>during</b> <b>Period</b> II had a significantly shorter duration of fertility than <b>during</b> <b>Period</b> I (P<. 0001). Also, the mean duration of fertility but not maximum percent fertility was improved in females inseminated with the highest doses compared with the lower doses of spermatozoa. Individual fertility results confirmed that {{a large majority of}} the females (81 to 93 % <b>during</b> <b>Period</b> I and 62 to 76 % <b>during</b> <b>Period</b> II) are capable of laying 100 % fertile eggs for at least 7 days. The mean duration of fertility <b>during</b> <b>Period</b> II was longer in females primarily classified as having the longest duration of fertility in Period I. This confirms that duration of fertility is consistent during the reproductive life...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveWe {{assessed}} {{the effectiveness of}} standardized protocols in decreasing postoperative mechanical ventilation time to < 6 hours. MethodsIn 2061 patients undergoing coronary bypass, the proportion extubated in < 6 hours was calculated for 3 sequential time periods. During period 1 patients were weaned per baseline practices; <b>during</b> <b>period</b> 2, per a protocol developed by a multidisciplinary committee; and <b>during</b> <b>period</b> 3, as in period 2 but with paralytic reversal and extubation performed at lower body temperatures and an extubation reminder sheet prominently displayed. We used a χ 2 test to examine differences in ventilation times among the 3 time periods and logistic regression modeling to control for independent risk factors for prolonged ventilation. As measures of patient safety, we examined rates of reintubation and rates of patient shivering following paralytic reversal. ResultsTwelve percent of patients were extubated in < 6 hours <b>during</b> <b>period</b> 1, 24 % <b>during</b> <b>period</b> 2 (P < . 01), and 38 % <b>during</b> <b>period</b> 3 (P < . 01 compared with both periods 1 and 2). After controlling for 12 risk factors, patients {{were more likely to}} be extubated in < 6 hours <b>during</b> <b>period</b> 2 (odds ratio, 2. 39; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 84 - 3. 10) and period 3 (odds ratio, 5. 05; 95 % confidence interval, 3. 65 - 6. 99) than <b>during</b> <b>period</b> 1. There was no difference in reintubation rates across periods, and the rate of patient shivering did not increase with paralytic reversal at lower body temperature. ConclusionsThe standardized protocols outlined in this article dramatically improved early extubation performance...|$|R

5|$|Exposed {{along the}} Cheakamus River {{and its tributaries}} are the Cheakamus Valley basalts. Although not {{necessarily}} mapped {{as part of the}} Cayley field, this sequence of basaltic lava flows is geologically similar and comparable in age to volcanic features that are part of this volcanic field. At least four basaltic flows comprise the sequence and were deposited <b>during</b> <b>periods</b> of volcanic activity from an unknown vent between 0.01and 1.6million years ago. Pillow lava is abundant along the bases the flows, some of which are underlain by hyaloclastite breccia. In 1958, Canadian volcanologist Bill Mathews suggested that the lava flows were erupted <b>during</b> <b>periods</b> of subglacial activity and traveled through trenches or tunnels melted in glacial ice of the Fraser Glaciation. Mathews based this on the age of the underlying till, the existence of pillow lava close to the bottom of some lavas, indicating subaqueous volcanism, the columnar jointing {{at the edges of the}} lavas, indicating rapid cooling, and the absence of apparent palaeogeography.|$|E
