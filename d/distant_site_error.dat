40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to compare the academic performance and attitudes of students at the instructor-based site of a televised course and the <b>distant</b> <b>site.</b> An earlier pilot program indicated the need for certain technical and structural interventions at the <b>distant</b> <b>site</b> such as multiple 2 ̆ 2 press-to-touch 2 ̆ 2 microphones, a site-administrator and participative seating arrangements. At the beginning of the class, demographic data were collected from the students at both sites through a questionnaire and supplemented with information from students 2 ̆ 7 records. Factors such as age, gender, ethnicity, marital status, number of children, current class status, major, work status and CLAST scores (achievement tests) were examined. There {{were no significant differences between}} the students at the sites except ethnicity and reading CLAST scores. The instructor-based site had a higher percentage of Hispanic students and the <b>distant</b> <b>site</b> had a larger percentage of Caucasian and Black Americans. The <b>distant</b> <b>site</b> scored significantly better on the reading section of the CLAST achievement test. An evaluation instrument was distributed to both sites, at the midpoint of the semester, measuring their attitude toward the organizational, technical, and pedagogical factors of the course. A second evaluation instrument, measuring similar factors, but more in-depth, was distributed to both sites near the end of the term. Nine students at the <b>distant</b> <b>site</b> were interviewed along with the site administrator to collect additional information. ^ Course completion rates, dropout rates, pass rates and final grades of students at both sites were compared. There were no significant differences in academic performance between the students at both sites, however, there were significant differences in their attitudes. Those at the instructor-based site gave better ratings to most of items in the evaluation instruments. Problems at the <b>distant</b> <b>site</b> included audio and visual clarity, lack of available assistance, too much nonrelated talking, not enough opportunities to ask questions or to interact with the instructor during class. ...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} the importance of providing users with a coherent environment across <b>distant</b> <b>sites.</b> To date, it remains unclear how such an environment affects people’s gestures and their comprehension. In this study, we investigate how a coherent environment across <b>distant</b> <b>sites</b> affects people’s hand gestures when collaborating on physical tasks. We present video-mediated technology that provides distant users with a coherent {{environment in which they}} can freely gesture toward remote objects by the unmediated representations of hands. Using this system, we examine the values of a coherent environment by comparing remote collaboration on physical tasks in a fractured setting versus a coherent setting. The results indicate that a coherent environment facilitates gesturing toward remote objects and their use improves task performance. The results further suggest that a coherent environment improves the sense of copresence across <b>distant</b> <b>sites</b> and enables quick recovery from misunderstandings.

40|$|The {{complete}} autopsies of 145 patients {{dying of}} colorectal cancer are reviewed. Isolated local or distant metastases are infrequent, compared to disseminated disease. Solitary local recurrences are most common after resection of rectal tumors. Right colon tumors spread to local and <b>distant</b> <b>sites</b> in 90 % of autopsies, and to <b>distant</b> <b>sites</b> alone in 10 %. Rectal tumors spread locally only in 25 % of cases, to <b>distant</b> <b>site</b> alone in 25 %, and to both in 50 %. Regardless {{of the origin}} of the primary tumor, the liver is the most common site of metastasis, followed by the regional lymph nodes and the lungs. Two-thirds of the patients with right colon lesions died of liver metastases, and three-quarters of those with rectal tumors succumbed to disseminated disease. The current curative and palliative treatment of recurrent colorectal cancer in clinical medicine by surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy is reviewed. It is suggested that an understanding of the anatomic patterns of cancer recurrence will increase in importance as advances in the modalities of treatment are made...|$|R

30|$|Injury to {{an organ}} {{triggers}} {{stem cells from}} <b>distant</b> <b>sites</b> to migrate {{to the area of}} damage, where they can differentiate and help repair the damaged organ. This reparative effect had been demonstrated in muscle, liver and brain tissues [31 – 33]. In 2001, Orlic et al. investigated whether stem cells from a <b>distant</b> <b>site</b> directly transplanted into the heart could regenerate scarred areas. Results demonstrated that locally delivered autologous bone marrow stem cells could regenerate damaged myocardium in infarcted mice hearts [34]. This finding led to further research examining the differentiation of MSCs into cardiac lineages and the specific effects on cardiac function.|$|R
40|$|AbstractCutaneous metastases are a rare finding, and {{therefore}} frequently neglected. Among the possible clinical patterns of presentation, keratoacanthoma-like lesions are very infrequent {{and can be}} misrepresentative of the true diagnosis. We report a case of multiple cutaneous metastases of oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma affecting the scalp and neck that mimic keratoacanthoma. In spite of the typical clinical presentation, pathological findings corroborated the diagnosis of moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. This case raises the possibility of such a clinical presentation being caused by haematogenous dissemination of <b>distant</b> <b>site</b> visceral tumours. Therefore, the differential diagnosis of multiple keratoacanthoma-like lesions should include metastases of <b>distant</b> <b>site</b> visceral malignancies...|$|R

40|$|We {{show how}} to achieve perfect quantum state {{transfer}} and construct effective two-qubit gates between <b>distant</b> <b>sites</b> in engineered bosonic and fermionic networks. The Hamiltonian for the system can be determined after choosing an eigenvalue spectrum freely from an infinite set of options with a certain property. A corollary {{is the possibility of}} perfect communication between <b>distant</b> <b>sites</b> of a single harmonic trap or an infinitely deep square well. The nature of the effective two-qubit gates depend on the exchange symmetry for fermions and bosons. For fermionic networks, the gates are entangling (and thus universal for quantum computation). For bosonic networks, though the gates are not entangling, they allow two-way simultaneous communications. Protocols of entanglement generation in both bosonic and fermionic engineered networks are discussed...|$|R

30|$|In addition, several {{reports have}} {{revealed}} that cancer-derived miRNAs in EVs contribute to cancer progression through remodeling the fibroblasts within the <b>distant</b> <b>site.</b> Rana et al. found that cancer-associated miR- 494 and miR- 542 - 3 p in EVs are transferred to lymph node stromal cells and lung fibroblasts, targeting cadherin- 17 and upregulating matrix metalloprotease [44]. Fong et al. revealed that breast cancer cell-derived miR- 122 - 5 p in EVs suppresses glucose intake in astrocytes and lung fibroblasts by inhibiting pyruvate kinase. This increased glucose utilization and promotion of circulating tumor cell colonization favors brain and lung metastasis [45].
