5|$|A {{feature of}} the canal was the variety of methods used at Combe Hay to {{overcome}} height differences between {{the upper and lower}} reaches, initially by the use of caisson locks and when this failed an <b>inclined</b> <b>plane</b> trackway and then finally a flight of 22 conventionallocks.|$|E
5|$|After {{a catastrophic}} flood in 1889, the Johnstown <b>Inclined</b> <b>Plane</b> was {{completed}} in 1891 {{to serve as an}} escape route for future floods, as well as a convenient mode of transportation for the residents of the new communities situated above the valley. It was operated by Cambria Iron Company and its successor Bethlehem Steel until 1935, when it was sold to the borough of Westmont. The incline was briefly shut down in 1962 when its supply of power from Bethlehem Steel was terminated. Twice in its history, the Johnstown <b>Inclined</b> <b>Plane</b> fulfilled its role as a means of evacuation from floodsonce in 1936 and again in 1977. The incline was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973 and was designated a Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark in 1994. It had major renovations in 1962 and from 1983 to 1984.|$|E

25|$|Renwick's {{original}} design {{seems to have}} been to have double tracks on all <b>inclined</b> <b>planes,</b> with the descending caisson holding more water, thus, the system would not have needed (theoretically) external power. Nevertheless, the <b>inclined</b> <b>planes</b> were built with overshot water wheels to supply power.|$|R
5000|$|... 1860-present - The {{first four}} <b>inclined</b> <b>planes</b> of the ElblÄ…g Canal in Germany (East Prussia), {{nowadays}} Poland, were opened in 1860. A fifth incline was added later to replace five wooden locks. This canal reused the design from the Morris Canal for its <b>inclined</b> <b>planes.</b>|$|R
5|$|It was {{temporarily}} replaced with an <b>inclined</b> <b>plane</b> by Benjamin Outram who had successfully installed inclined planes at the Peak Forest Canal in Derbyshire, whilst 22locks and a Boulton & Watt Steam Pumping Station, capable of lifting 5,000tons {{of water in}} 12hours, were built to the latest design with metal plate clad wooden gates.|$|E
5|$|Construction was in two phases. A {{level section}} from Tiverton to Lowdwells on the Devon/Somerset border, opened in 1814, and {{was capable of}} {{carrying}} broad-beam barges, carrying up to 40tons. The Somerset section, suitable for tub-boats, which were about 20feet (6.1m) long and capable of carrying eight tons, opened in 1839. It included an <b>inclined</b> <b>plane</b> and seven boat lifts, the earliest lifts to see commercial service in the UK. The lifts predated the Anderton Boat Lift by nearly 40 years.|$|E
5|$|Myers {{designed}} {{a new type}} balloon vessel based on Carlotta's discoveries of aerodynamics and how airship bodies acted in the sky. Carlotta {{was the first woman}} to use a maneuverable airship. She used a cloth screw-sail and also a cloth rudder for controlling the steering of her aeroplane platform. The platform car device weighted 11 pounds. This {{was the first time that}} an ordinary spherical balloon could be controlled by a person. Myers then incorporated new features into balloons based on Carlotta's findings. For a more efficient steerable airship vessel he made his next balloon gas bag bottom flat so that it would act like an <b>inclined</b> <b>plane.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Inclined</b> <b>planes</b> {{have been}} used by people since prehistoric times to move heavy objects. [...] The sloping roads and causeways built by ancient civilizations such as the Romans are {{examples}} of early <b>inclined</b> <b>planes</b> that have survived, and show that they understood the value of this device for moving things uphill. The heavy stones used in ancient stone structures such as Stonehenge are believed to have been moved and set in place using <b>inclined</b> <b>planes</b> made of earth, although it is hard to find evidence of such temporary building ramps. The Egyptian pyramids were constructed using <b>inclined</b> <b>planes,</b> Siege ramps enabled ancient armies to surmount fortress walls. The ancient Greeks constructed a paved ramp 6 km (3.7 miles) long, the Diolkos, to drag ships overland across the Isthmus of Corinth.|$|R

5|$|The idea {{of using}} {{inclined}} planes was an innovation that Green had pioneered elsewhere. He had been the engineer for the Bude Canal, which included six planes, five powered by water wheels and one by a descending bucket mechanism. He {{was at the time}} the engineer for the Grand Western Canal, which included seven vertical boat lifts and an <b>inclined</b> <b>plane</b> at Wellisford, again to be powered by a descending bucket mechanism. The rise on the final section of the canal to Cwmmawr was , and three inclined planes would be much quicker and use much less water than the alternative of 20 or more locks.|$|E
5|$|In the 1820s {{a number}} of {{proposals}} for a railway between Manchester and Bolton were made, some well advanced enough to be submitted to Parliament. One, in 1825, was for a line from New Bailey in Salford, to Park Field in Bolton, and included a branch line to the Mersey and Irwell Navigation. The plan included {{the use of an}} <b>inclined</b> <b>plane</b> at Clifton to allow the railway to access the higher ground from thereon. Another scheme was to connect with the planned Liverpool and Manchester Railway near Eccles, and would reach Bolton via Moorside and Farnworth. Neither of these schemes progressed beyond the early stages of planning. In 1830 two more proposals to connect the towns were made. The Manchester to Preston Railway was unsuccessful, leaving open the way for the second scheme, which would become known as the Manchester and Bolton Railway.|$|E
5|$|With the <b>inclined</b> <b>plane,</b> the {{problems}} {{stemmed from a}} mis-calculation. Power was provided by a large tank, filled with water, which descended in a shaft, raising one boat on a trolley and allowing another to descend as it did so. When the tank reached {{the bottom of the}} shaft, the water discharged, and the second tank was used to reverse the process. Green had been the engineer on the Bude Canal, where this design had been used successfully, but the size of the tanks at Wellisford were much too small. On the Bude Canal, a tank holding 15tons of water was required to raise a boat weighing six tons. The Grand Western Canal used boats holding eight tons, but the tanks only held ten tons of water, whereas tests indicated that about 25tons was needed. It was for this reason that the steam engine was obtained to supply the power.|$|E

25|$|A short {{section of}} the Shropshire Canal {{including}} the Hay <b>Inclined</b> <b>Plane</b> has been incorporated into the Ironbridge Gorge Museums. The canal contains water near the derelict Madeley Wood Brick and Tile Works, and the section {{at the bottom of}} the <b>inclined</b> <b>plane</b> at Coalport is also in water. The <b>inclined</b> <b>plane</b> was partially restored in the 1970s, and further restoration took place in the 1990s.|$|E
25|$|Engineer William Rich Hutton was {{instrumental}} in getting the <b>inclined</b> <b>plane</b> built. Starting in 1875, a canal <b>inclined</b> <b>plane</b> was built two miles (3km) upriver from Georgetown, so that boats whose destination was downriver from Washington could bypass the congestion (and price gouging of independent wharf owners) in Georgetown. Originally the company planned to build a river lock, but then discovered that such a lock occasionally would consume more water than the level could provide. They then planned to make an <b>inclined</b> <b>plane,</b> much like the Morris Canal. The first boat went through in 1876; 1918 boats used the <b>inclined</b> <b>plane</b> that first year. Usage reports conflict: Hahn reports that was only really used for two years, and sporadically in 1889, yet Skramstad reports that due to flood damage in 1880 to the Rock Creek outlet, any boat until 1889 (when another flood wrecked the canal) going further down the Potomac than Georgetown, {{had to use the}} <b>inclined</b> <b>plane.</b> Although Hahn says it was the largest <b>inclined</b> <b>plane</b> in the world at that time, it was 600 feet long, which is short compared to Plane 9 West of the Morris Canal at 1,500 feet. It originally used a turbine to power it (like the Morris Canal) but was later switched to use steam power.|$|E
25|$|An <b>inclined</b> <b>plane</b> for railway wagons at Blackhill {{connected}} the two {{reaches of the}} canal. The coals were unloaded from the boats in the upper reach into the wagons, run down the <b>inclined</b> <b>plane,</b> and again loaded into boats in the lower reach, which was a tedious operation, and hurtful to the coals.|$|E

25|$|Building work on {{the locks}} started in 1810 and took four years. Little changed until the {{building}} of the <b>inclined</b> <b>plane</b> resulted in the reduction in size of some of the side pounds. While the <b>inclined</b> <b>plane</b> was in operation the locks were allowed to fall into decline to an extent and in 1908 the committee released Â£1,000 to bring the locks back into full (nightly) operation.|$|E

2500|$|Professor James Renwick, of Columbia University {{devised the}} idea of using <b>inclined</b> <b>planes</b> to get the boats up 1,600 feet in 90 miles, instead of using about 300 lift locks, since a lift lock of that time {{typically}} lifted about 6 feet.

25|$|Maintaining an {{adequate}} water supply was a problem, and later an <b>inclined</b> <b>plane</b> was built at Blackhill, in which barges were let down and hauled up, floating in caissons that ran on rails.

It was dismantled in 1926, but a project to re-create the Plane commenced in the 2000s, since the locks remain a bottleneck for boat traffic.|$|E
25|$|The Shropshire Canal was a tub boat canal {{built to}} supply coal, ore and {{limestone}} {{to the industrial}} region of east Shropshire, England, that adjoined the River Severn at Coalbrookdale.
