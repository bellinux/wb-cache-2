The relative 5 -year survival was 73 %, which is higher than most rates reported from other centres. Lymph node involvement was significant as a prognostic factor, with the relative 5 -year survival falling from 92 % in the group without lymph node involvement to 58 % in the group with three or more involved nodes. The prognosis was also significantly affected by the stage of the disease according to the 1973 TNM classification: the 5 -year {{survival rates}} ranged from 88 % for patients with stage 1 disease to 17 % for those with stage IV disease. Women 40 to 59 years of age had a higher survival rate (79 %) than those under 40 years (65 %) or over 60 years (66 %) of age. Analyses by 5 -year age groups showed that women 35 to 39 years old had a particularly poor survival rate (59 %). Postmenopausal women less than 55 years old had a higher survival rate than did perimenopausal or premenopausal women in the same age group.

40|$|Antigen HLA-B 27 is a <b>high-risk</b> genetic <b>factor</b> <b>with</b> {{respect to}} a group of {{rheumatoid}} disorders, especially ankylosing spondylitis. A cDNA library was constructed from an autozygous B-cell line expressing HLA-B 27, HLA-Cw 1, and the previously cloned HLA-A 2 antigen. Clones detected with an HLA probe' were isolated and sorted into homology groups by differential hybridization and restriction maps. Nucleotide sequencing allowed the unambiguous assignment of cDNAs to HL 4 -A, -B, and -C loci. The HLA-B 27 mRNA has the structural features and the codon variability typical of an HLA class I transcript but it specifies two uncommon amino acid replacements: a cysteine in position 67 and a serine in position 131. The latter substitution may have functional consequences, because it occurs in a conserved region and at a position invariably occupied by a species-specific arginine in humans and lysine in mice. The availability of the complete sequence of HLA-B 27 and of the partial sequence of HLA-Cw 1 allows the recognition of locus-specific sequence markers, particularly, but not exclusively, in the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. ...|$|R

In this study, we demonstrated that Lactobacillus paracasei GMNL- 32 (GMNL- 32), a probiotic species, exhibits anti-fibrosis and anti-apoptotic effects on the cardiac tissue of NZB/WF 1 mice. Female NZB/W F 1 mice, a well-known and commonly used lupus-prone mouse strain, were treated with or without GMNL- 32 administration for 12 weeks. Oral administration of GMNL- 32 to NZB/WF 1 mice significantly increased the ventricular thickness when compared to that of NZB/WF 1 mice. Administration of GMNL- 32 significantly attenuated the cardiac cell apoptosis that was observed in exacerbate levels in the control NZB/WF 1 mice. Further, the cellular morphology that was slightly distorted in the NZB/WF 1 was effectively alleviated in the treatment group mice. In addition, GMNL- 32 reduced the level of Fas death receptor-related pathway of apoptosis signaling and enhanced anti-apoptotic proteins. These results indicate that GMNL- 32 exhibit an effective protective effect on cardiac cells of SLE mice.

Aims : The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the <b>high-risk</b> <b>factors</b> associated <b>with</b> the development of critical illness in the hospitalized pregnant women with A/H 1 N 1 infection. Settings and Design : This retrospective cohort study was carried out in the tertiary care obstetric department of a large general hospital. Materials and Methods : The clinical data of H 1 N 1 pregnant women hospitalized from November 2009 to January 2010 was reviewed. We classified these cases into severe and critical grades according to H 1 N 1 influenza treatment guidelines. We selected maternal age, gestational age, and the time interval between symptom-onset and hospital admission as related factors of critical illness. Statistical Analysis : Logistic regression analyses to determine the relevance and importance of <b>factors</b> significantly associated <b>with</b> critical illness. Results : Eighteen cases of H 1 N 1 influenza pregnant women were admitted. Ten pregnant women were severe cases and eight pregnant women were critical cases. The maternal age (OR= 0. 979, 95 % CI: 0. 749 ~ 1. 279) and the time interval between symptom-onset and hospital admission (OR= 1. 41, 95 % CI: 0. 917 ~ 2. 169) were not found to be risk factors for critical cases.

40|$|Abstract: The {{construct}} of resilience {{has captured the}} imagination of researchers across various disciplines over the last five decades (Ungar, 2008 a). Despite {{a growing body of research}} in the area of resilience, there is little consensus among researchers about the definition and meaning of this concept. Resilience has been used to describe eight kinds of phenomena across different disciplines. These eight phenomena can be divided into two clusters based on the disciplinary origin. The first cluster mainly involves definitions of resilience derived from the discipline of psychology and covers six themes including (i) personality traits, (ii) positive outcomes/forms of adaptation despite <b>high-risk,</b> (iii) <b>factors</b> associated <b>with</b> positive adaptation, (iv) processes, (v) sustained competent functioning/stress resistance, and (vi) recovery from trauma or adversity. The second cluster of definitions is rooted in the discipline of sociology and encompasses two themes including (i) human agency and resistance, and (ii) survival. This paper discusses the inconsistencies in the varied definitions used within the published literature and describes the differing conceptualizations of resilience as well as their limitations. The paper concludes by offering a unifying conceptualization of resilience and by discussing implications for future research on resilience...|$|R

Five courses of UFT/LV therapy will be given as follows: UFT (300 mg/m 2 /d) with LV (75 mg/d) will be orally administered in 3 doses per day. Treatment will be received daily for 28 days, followed by a 7 -day rest or will be received daily for 5 days, followed by a 2 -day rest. For both regimens, 1 course will last 5 weeks, and 5 courses will be given. The primary end point is disease-free survival.

This cross-sectional study aimed to explore the relationship between preoperative pathogenic airway bacterial colonization and POP in lung cancer and to identify the <b>high-risk</b> <b>factors</b> of preoperative pathogenic airway bacterial colonization. Methods A total of 125 patients with {{non-small cell lung cancer}} (NSCLC) underwent thoracic surgery in six hospitals of Chengdu between May 2015 and January 2016. Preoperative pathogenic airway bacterial colonization was detected in all patients via fiber bronchoscopy. Patients’ PPC, <b>high-risk</b> <b>factors,</b> clinical characteristics, and the serum surfactant protein D (SP-D) level were also analyzed. Results The incidence of preoperative pathogenic airway bacterial colonization among NSCLC patients was 15. 2 % (19 / 125). Up to 22 strains were identified in the colonization positive group, with Gram-negative bacteria being dominant (86. 36 %, 19 / 22). <b>High-risk</b> <b>factors</b> of pathogenic airway bacterial colonization were age (≥ 75 yr) and smoking index (≥ 400 cigarettes/year). PPC incidence was significantly higher in the colonization-positive group (42. 11 %, 8 / 19) than that in the colonization-negative group (16. 04 %, 17 / 106) (P= 0. 021). POP incidence was significantly higher in the colonization-positive group (26. 32 %, 5 / 19) than that in the colonization-negative group (6. 60 %, 7 / 106) (P= 0. 019). The serum SP-D level of patients in the colonization-positive group was remarkably higher than that in the colonization-negative group [(31. 25 ± 6. 09) vs (28. 17 ± 5. 23) ](P= 0. 023).

Design, setting, and participants In a retrospective multicentre cohort study from six European centres between 1987 and 2005, 712 patients with PSA > 20 ng/ml underwent RP and bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy. Measurements Subgroups were analysed to determine the relationship between the number of <b>high-risk</b> <b>factors</b> and histopathology, biochemical progression-free survival, clinical evidence of progressive disease, prostate cancer–specific mortality (PCSM), and overall mortality. Kaplan-Meier analysis with log-rank test and Cox multivariable analysis were applied. Results and limitations Median follow-up was 77 mo. The number of <b>high-risk</b> <b>factors</b> was significantly associated with unfavourable histopathology. Among patients with only PSA > 20 ng/ml, 33 % had pT 2 PCa, 57. 9 % had bGS 20 ng/ml associated with bGS ≤ 7 resulted in 10 -yr PCSM of 5 %; when associated with bGS ≥ 8, PCSM was 35 %.

40|$|Purpose : To {{evaluate}} {{the outcomes of}} high-risk prostate cancer patients treated with biologically effective dose (BED) ≥ 220 Gy of high-dose radiotherapy, using low-dose-rate (LDR) brachytherapy in combination with external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) and short-term androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Material and methods : From 2005 to 2013, a total of 143 patients with high-risk prostate cancer were treated by radiotherapy of BED ≥ 220 Gy {{with a combination of}} LDR brachytherapy, EBRT, and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). The high-risk patients in the present study included both high-risk and very high-risk prostate cancer. The number of high-risk features were: 60 patients <b>with</b> 1 <b>high-risk</b> <b>factor</b> (42 %), 61 patients <b>with</b> 2 <b>high-risk</b> <b>factors</b> (43 %), and 22 patients <b>with</b> 3 <b>high-risk</b> <b>factors</b> (15 %) including five N 1 disease. External beam radiotherapy fields included prostate and seminal vesicles only or whole pelvis depending on the extension of the disease. Biochemical failure was defined by the Phoenix definition. Results : Six patients developed biochemical failure, thus providing a 5 -year actual biochemical failure-free survival (BFFS) rate of 95. 2 %. Biochemical failure was observed exclusively in cases with distant metastasis in the present study. All six patients with biochemical relapse had clinical failure due to bone metastasis, thus yielding a 5 -year freedom from clinical failure (FFCF) rate of 93. 0 %. None of the cases with N 1 disease experienced biochemical failure. We observed four deaths, including one death from prostate cancer, therefore yielding a cause-specific survival (CSS) rate of 97. 2 %, and an overall survival (OS) rate of 95. 5 %.

NCCN Guidelines Version 7. 2015 NSCLC states, “Consider adjuvant chemotherapy for high-risk, margin negative (R 0) stages IB-IIAo”, <b>with</b> prognostic <b>factors</b> such as tumor size, visceral pleural involvement, poor differentiation, and vascular invasion defining “high risk”. The current high risk factors, while informative, are largely qualitative, subjective, and can be highly variable in routine clinical practice. RNA expression assays developed and validated in large patient cohorts now offer a quantitative, reproducible measure of lung cancer-specific and overall mortality risk in patients with early stage disease. The inclusion of such measures of tumor aggressiveness among the NCCN <b>high-risk</b> <b>factors</b> would improve risk assessment for these patients and thus aid treatment decisions for physicians. 1 Specific Changes: Recommend the Lung Cancer Guidelines Committee add results from molecular testing for tumor aggressiveness using independently validated RNA expression-based prognosti...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveTo {{analyze the}} {{clinical}} <b>high-risk</b> <b>factors</b> for hepatitis B cirrhosis confirmed by liver biopsy. MethodsA case-control {{study was conducted}} on the clinical data collected from 237 patients with chronic hepatitis B who were hospitalized and underwent biopsy from April 2009 to October 2012. These patients included 79 cases confirmed by liver biopsy as having liver cirrhosis (case group) and 158 cases confirmed by biopsy as not having liver cirrhosis (control group). Univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression analysis were used to investigate the clinical risk factors for liver cirrhosis. In the univariate analysis, comparison of categorical data was made by chi-square test, and comparison of continuous data was made by t test. The indices of statistical significance were subjected to multivariate logistic regression analysis. ResultsThe univariate analysis showed that the case group had significantly increased numbers of male cases and HBeAg-negative cases, age, and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), immunoglobulin G (IgG), and hyaluronic acid levels (P＜ 0. 05) and significantly decreased albumin (Alb), hepatitis B virus DNA, and laminin levels and platelet (PLT) count (P＜ 0. 05), as compared with the control group. The unconditional multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that increasing age ［β= 0. 046, odds ratio (OR) = 0. 955 ］, elevated GGT level (β= 0. 04, OR= 0. 96), and increased IgG level (β= 0. 179, OR= 0. 836) were <b>high-risk</b> <b>factors</b> for liver cirrhosis, while increased Alb level (β=- 0. 114, OR= 1. 120) and PLT count (β=- 0. 024, OR= 1. 024) were protective factors for liver cirrhosis. ConclusionIncreasing age, decreased Alb level, elevated GGT level, decreased PLT count, and increased IgG level are <b>high-risk</b> <b>factors</b> for liver cirrhosis in patients with chronic hepatitis B whose ALT levels range within 0 - 80 U/L. Active monitoring of the above indices, especially PLT, IgG, and GGT, and liver biopsy should be performed if necessary to avoid misdiagnosis of liver cirrhosis in patients with chronic hepatitis B...|$|R

Coarse mucosal folds in the stomach, and delay in the gastro-intestinal emptying of the barium were often suggestive of amyloidosis. <b>High-risk</b> <b>factor</b> for survival of AL amyloidosis such as congestive heart failure, urine light chain, hepatomegaly and multiple myeloma were adversely affecting survival AL patients in the literature.

40|$|Various {{modeling}} {{techniques were}} used to understand fluidized bed granulation using a two-step approach. First, Plackett-Burman design (PBD) was used to identify the <b>high-risk</b> <b>factors.</b> Then, Box-Behnken design (BBD) was used to analyze and optimize those <b>high-risk</b> <b>factors.</b> The relationship between the high-risk input variables (inlet air temperature X 1, binder solution rate X 3, and binder-to-powder ratio X 5) and quality attributes (flowability Y 1, temperature Y 2, moisture content Y 3, aggregation index Y 4, and compactability Y 5) of the process was investigated using response surface model (RSM), partial least squares method (PLS) and artificial neural network of multilayer perceptron (MLP). The morphological study of the granules was also investigated using a scanning electron microscope. The results showed that X 1, X 3, and X 5 significantly affected the properties of granule. The RSM, PLS and MLP models {{were found to be}} useful statistical analysis tools for a better mechanistic understanding of granulation. The statistical analysis results showed that the RSM model had a better ability to fit the quality attributes of granules compared to the PLS and MLP models. Understanding the effect of process parameters on granule properties provides the basis for modulating the granulation parameters and optimizing the product performance at the early development stage of pharmaceutical products...|$|R

However, different studies of viruses in breast cancer present conflicting results and some of these works remain in dispute. DNA viruses, such as specific types of human papillomaviruses (HPV), Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), and human herpes virus type 8 (HHV- 8), have emerged as causal factors of some human cancers. These respective exogenous viruses and the possibility of multiple viral factors are discussed in this review...|$|R
30|$|Administrations of {{prophylactic}} antibiotics {{for patients}} who undergo ESWL are controversial according to previous studies. In several studies, pre-operative antibiotics are recommended in patients <b>with</b> <b>high-risk</b> <b>factors</b> such as having instrument or stent {{at the time of}} ESWL, positive urine culture, infected and stag-horn stones, and recurrent UTI [7 – 9]. The importance of prophylactics antifungal administration {{for patients who}} undergo ESWL has not been investigated so far. Therefore, future study on this topic is recommended. In our case, the patient did not receive any prophylactic antibiotics or antifungal before and after ESWL.|$|R
