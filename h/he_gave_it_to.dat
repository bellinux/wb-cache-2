He added an artist's studio to the cabin during the 1920s. He would spend the winter, spring, and fall at Butterfly Lodge, while the summers he would spend in Montana, in a studio inside a tipi.

In April 1039, in support of the deposed and blinded Manso II, Guaimar forced the abdication and exile of John II and his mother, Maria, a sister of Pandulf. Guaimar installed himself as duke. Then in July, he conquered Sorrento, which had been conquered by Pandulf in 1034. <b>He</b> <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> his brother Guy with the title of duke.

25|$|Disillusioned Death Eater Regulus Arcturus Black {{had learned}} about the Horcrux and its hiding place from his house elf Kreacher, whom he had {{originally}} volunteered to accompany Voldemort to hide the Horcrux. In an effort to bring about Voldemort's eventual downfall, he and Kreacher navigated the magical protection and stole the locket, replacing it with the false one to fool Voldemort. While Black died in the effort, killed by the surrounding Inferi, Kreacher took the locket back to their home at Number 12, Grimmauld Place. Unable to destroy it like Black ordered, Kreacher continued to protect the locket for years. While the Order of the Phoenix was using the house as its headquarters, the locket was stolen by Mundungus Fletcher, a petty criminal {{and member of the}} Order. <b>He</b> <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Dolores Umbridge as a bribe when she caught him selling stolen property.|$|E
25|$|The last inheritor of the estate, Rev. Luis C.F.T. Morgan-Grenville, due to prodigious debts, {{sold the}} house, gardens {{and part of}} the park in 1921 to a Mr Harry Shaw for Â£50,000 who {{intended}} to present the house to the nation. But being unable to pay for an endowment to maintain the building it was sold again in 1922 to the governors of what became Stowe School. This opened on 11 May 1923. The rest of the estate was sold as separate lots. Clough Williams-Ellis purchased the Grand Avenue to prevent its felling to create building plots. Later <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the school. The gardens remained in the ownership of the School until 1989 when an anonymous donor provided funds for an endowment and the National Trust assumed ownership. In 1997 the ownership of the house passed to the Stowe House Preservation Trust, the major aim of which is to restore the building.|$|E
25|$|King Charles IV of Spain {{had been}} an ally of France. He succeeded his father, Charles III, in 1788. At first he {{declared}} war on France on 7 March 1793, but he made peace on 22 June 1795. This peace became an alliance on 19 August 1796. His chief minister, Manuel de Godoy convinced Charles that his son, Ferdinand, was plotting to overthrow him. Napoleon exploited the situation and invaded Spain in March 1808. This led to an uprising that forced Charles to abdicate on 19 March in favor of his son, Ferdinand VII. Napoleon forced Ferdinand to return the crown to Charles on 30 April and then convinced Charles to relinquish it to him on 10 May. In turn, <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> his brother, Joseph, king of Naples on 6 June. Joseph abandoned Naples to Joachim Murat, the husband of Napoleon's sister. This was very unpopular in Spain and resulted in the Peninsular War, a struggle that would contribute to the downfall of Napoleon.|$|E

25|$|Modern {{chewing gum}} was first {{developed}} in the 1860s when chicle was brought from Mexico by the former President, General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna, to New York, where <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Thomas Adams {{for use as a}} rubber substitute. Chicle did not succeed as a replacement for rubber, but as a gum, which was cut into strips and marketed as Adams New York Chewing Gum in 1871. Black Jack (1884), which is flavored with licorice, Chiclets (1899), and Wrigley's Spearmint Gum were early popular gums that quickly dominated the market and are all still around today. Chewing gum gained worldwide popularity through American GIs in WWII, who were supplied chewing gum as a ration and traded it with locals. Synthetic gums were first introduced to the U.S. after chicle no longer satisfied the needs of making good chewing gum. By the 1960s, US manufacturers had switched to butadiene-based synthetic rubber, as it was cheaper to manufacture.|$|E

500|$|Following {{a journey}} to the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, van Meegeren painted The Supper at Emmaus using the {{ultramarine}} blues and yellows preferred by Johannes Vermeer and other Dutch Golden Age painters. The experts assumed that Vermeer had studied in Italy, so van Meegeren used [...] by Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio located at Italyâs Pinacoteca di Brera as a model. He {{had always wanted to}} walk in the steps of the masters, and he felt that his forgery was a fine work in its own right. <b>He</b> <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> his friend, attorney C. A.

500|$|Observing that naturalists {{in other}} European {{countries}} were producing volumes describing the animals {{found in their}} territories, Pennant started, in 1761, a similar work about Britain, to be called British Zoology. This was a comprehensive book with 132 folio plates in colour. It was published in 1766 and 1767 in four volumes as quarto editions, and further small editions followed. The illustrations [...] were so expensive to produce that he made little money from the publication, and {{when there was a}} profit, <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> charity. For example, the bookseller Benjamin White, brother of the naturalist Gilbert White, received permission, on payment of Â£100, to publish an octavo edition, and the money thus raised was donated to the Welsh Charity School. Further appendix volumes were added later and the text, largely written from personal observations, was translated into Latin and German.|$|E
500|$|He {{was also}} {{recognized}} for his [...] "spanky-twang" [...] guitar style. To create his sound, {{he used a}} pronounced 'phaser' effect (see 'Modulation Effects': below) plus a mixture of thumb and fingers during the rhythmic parts, while using picks for the lead runs. He combined hammer-on and pull-off riffs, with eventual upper-fret double stops and modulation effects. Jennings played a 1953 Fender Telecaster, a used guitar that {{was a gift from}} The Waylors. Jennings's bandmates adorned his guitar with a distinctive leather cover that featured a black background with a white floral work. Jennings further customized it by filing down the frets to lower the strings on the neck to obtain the slapping sound. Among his other guitars, Jennings used a 1950 Fender Broadcaster from the mid-1970s, until <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> guitarist Reggie Young in 1993. The leather covers of his guitars were carved by leather artist Terry Lankford.|$|E
500|$|Rowland has {{acknowledged}} {{on several occasions}} that although she loved dance music, it was not really the type of music she would record. While in Europe in 2008, she met Guetta {{at one of his}} DJ shows in Southern France and commented that [...] "Listening to him was just crazy." [...] Guetta was playing the instrumental version of [...] "When Love Takes Over". Recalling that it brought tears to her eyes, Rowland remarked, [...] "I felt so much emotion from the track; something happened the first time I heard it, and it was just beautiful. And I remember thinking 'Why is this touching me like this?' You know, it was like there was a kinda soul-tie to it!" [...] Upon meeting Guetta, she asked him for the song so she could write its lyrics. [...] "So I met David and asked him for the track... <b>He</b> <b>gave</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> me, and I brought it back here to London, UK and wrote the actual song". At a writing session in a London hotel room, Rowland and songwriting duo Nervo wrote the lyrics and melody over Guetta's backing track. Rowland later joined Guetta and Julie Terry LefÃ¨vre-Han in the recording studio to finish off the song.|$|E
