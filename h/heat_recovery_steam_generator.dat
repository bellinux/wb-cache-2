25|$|In a {{combined}} cycle power plant, {{the heat of}} the gas turbine's exhaust is used to generate steam by passing it through a <b>heat</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> (HRSG) with a live steam temperature between 420 and 580°C. The condenser of the Rankine cycle is usually cooled by water from a lake, river, sea or cooling towers. This temperature can be as low as 15°C.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} approach of using coal for electricity generation with improved efficiency is the integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) power plant. Instead of pulverizing the coal and burning it directly as fuel in the steam-generating boiler, the coal is gasified (see coal gasification) to create syngas, which is burned in a gas turbine to produce electricity (just like {{natural gas is}} burned in a turbine). Hot exhaust gases from the turbine are used to raise steam in a <b>heat</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> which powers a supplemental steam turbine. Thermal efficiencies of current IGCC power plants range from 39% to 42% (HHV basis) or ≈42–45% (LHV basis) for bituminous coal and assuming utilization of mainstream gasification technologies (Shell, GE Gasifier, CB). IGCC power plants outperform conventional pulverized coal-fueled plants in terms of pollutant emissions, and allow for relatively easy carbon capture.|$|E
2500|$|One type {{of fossil}} fuel power plant uses a gas turbine in {{conjunction}} with a <b>heat</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> (HRSG). It is referred to as a combined cycle power plant because it combines the Brayton cycle of the gas turbine with the Rankine cycle of the HRSG. [...] The thermal efficiency of these plants has reached a record heat rate of 5690 Btu/(kW·h), or just under 60%, at a facility in Baglan Bay, Wales.|$|E

2500|$|In {{this example}} the syngas {{produced}} {{is used as}} fuel in a gas turbine which produces electrical power. [...] In a normal combined cycle, so-called [...] "waste heat" [...] from the gas turbine exhaust is used in a <b>Heat</b> <b>Recovery</b> <b>Steam</b> <b>Generator</b> (HRSG) to make steam for the steam turbine cycle. [...] An IGCC plant improves the overall process efficiency by adding the higher-temperature steam produced by the gasification process to the steam turbine cycle. [...] This steam is then used in steam turbines to produce additional electrical power.|$|E
2500|$|The combined-cycle system {{includes}} single-shaft and multi-shaft configurations. The single-shaft system {{consists of}} one gas turbine, one steam turbine, one generator and one <b>Heat</b> <b>Recovery</b> <b>Steam</b> <b>Generator</b> (HRSG), with the gas turbine and steam turbine coupled {{to the single}} generator in a tandem arrangement on a single shaft. Key advantages of the single-shaft arrangement are operating simplicity, smaller footprint, and lower startup cost. [...] Single-shaft arrangements, however, will tend to have less flexibility and equivalent reliability than multi-shaft blocks. Additional operational flexibility is provided with a steam turbine which can be disconnected, using a synchro-self-shifting (SSS) Clutch, for start up or for simple cycle operation of the gas turbine.|$|E
2500|$|Thermodynamic {{benefits}} are that daily steam turbine startup losses are eliminated. [...] Major factors limiting the load output of a {{combined cycle power plant}} are the allowed pressure and temperature transients of the steam turbine and the <b>heat</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> waiting times to establish required steam chemistry conditions and warm-up {{times for the}} balance of plant and the main piping system. Those limitations also influence the fast start-up capability of the gas turbine by requiring waiting times. And waiting gas turbines consume gas. The solar component, if the plant is started after sunshine, or before, if we have heat storage, allows us to preheat the steam to the required conditions. That is, the plant is started faster and we consume less gas before achieving operating conditions.|$|E
50|$|Phase 2 {{consists}} of two 169 MW gas turbines, two <b>heat</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>steam</b> <b>generators</b> and a 171 MW steam turbine. It is similar to two CCGTs next-door to each other.|$|R
50|$|In 2002, two {{gas-fired}} combustion turbines and two <b>heat</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>steam</b> <b>generators</b> {{were installed}} at the University of Arizona. These utilities are cheaper to use and emit less pollutants than traditional systems.|$|R
50|$|The three 277 MWe V94.3A (now called SGT5-4000F) Siemens gas {{turbines}} provide a CCGT-type system of power generation, with three Doosan Babcock <b>heat</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>steam</b> <b>generators</b> providing <b>steam</b> to one (older) steam turbine.|$|R
2500|$|Almost all coal, petroleum, nuclear, geothermal, {{solar thermal}} electric, and waste {{incineration}} plants, {{as well as}} many natural gas power stations are thermal. Natural gas is frequently combusted in gas turbines as well as boilers. [...] The waste heat from a gas turbine, in the form of hot exhaust gas, can be used to raise steam, by passing this gas through a <b>Heat</b> <b>Recovery</b> <b>Steam</b> <b>Generator</b> (HRSG) the steam is then used to drive a steam turbine in a combined cycle plant that improves overall efficiency. Power stations burning coal, fuel oil, or natural gas are often called fossil-fuel power stations. [...] Some biomass-fueled thermal power stations have appeared also. Non-nuclear thermal power stations, particularly fossil-fueled plants, which do not use co-generation are sometimes referred to as conventional power stations.|$|E
50|$|The {{configuration}} {{of these plants}} involves replacing the old coal boiler with gas-fired turbine (GT). The gas-fired outputs exhaust heat to a <b>heat</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> (HRSG). From {{the output of the}} <b>heat</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> it is run into a steam turbine which increases electricity production and the overall efficiency of the plant. The gas-fired turbine (GT) and the <b>heat</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> (HRSG) technology has been in utilize in many repowering projects over the past 20 years in the United States alone. With increasing environmental regulations of the United States Government and the lower fuel prices made the usage of GT/HRSG an option in utilizing to renew many old coal heating power plants. This modern gas turbines operate with higher efficiencies and adding a <b>heat</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> (HRSG) raises overall plant efficiency to 40 percent to 50 percent (HHV) above the range of most coal-fired plants, reducing fuel consumption and lowering plant emissions. Siemens Corporation are also using this technology by combining the gas turbine (GT) in conjunction with the <b>heat</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> (HRSG) with the steam turbine (ST) and the combined cycle power plants to produce the most efficient power generation facilities. Existing direct-fired plants can utilize this advanced cycle concept by adding a GT and a HRSG. This so-called repowering scheme makes the existing power generation facility equally efficient as modern combined cycle power plant.|$|E
