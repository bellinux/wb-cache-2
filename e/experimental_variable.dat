5000|$|Ralph Kronig (1931, 1932), {{published}} the first theory of x-ray absorption fine structure, which contained {{some of the}} basic concepts of the modern interpretation. The Kronig-Penney Model (1931) is a one-dimensional model of a crystal that shows how the electrons in a crystal are dispersed into allowed and forbidden bands by scattering from the extended linear array of atoms. His first theory (1931) of EXAFS was the three-dimensional equivalent of this model. The theory showed that a photo electron traversing a crystal lattice would experience permitted and forbidden zones depending on its wavelength and, that even when the effect was averaged over all directions in the lattice, a residual structure should be observed. His theory was successful in predicting many generally observed features of the fine structure, including similar structure from similar lattices, inverse r2 dependence, correct r versus T dependence and increasing energy separation of the fine structure features with energy from the edge. The equation, which was re-derived in a more quantitative way in 1932 was simple to apply and interpret. Every experimenter found approximate agreement with the theory. There were always some absorption features close to that predicted by the possible lattice planes. However, the expected strong reflections (e. g. (100), (110), (111), etc. [...] ) did not always correlate with the most intense absorption features as intuitively expected. Still, agreement was close enough to be tantalizing and everyone tested the agreement of their measured [...] "Kronig structure" [...] with the simple Kronig theory. In the Kronig equation, energy positions Wn correspond to the zone boundaries, i. e. not the absorption maxima or minima, but the first rise in each fine structure maximum. abg are the Miller indices, a is the lattice constant and q is the angle between the electron direction and the reciprocal lattice direction. When averaged over all directions with a non-polarized x-ray beam and a polycrystalline absorber, cos2q = 1. However, with a single crystal absorber and polarized x-rays the absorption features should be larger for specific crystal planes. This was another <b>experimental</b> <b>variable</b> that might verify the theory and many attempted to test it. Thus began the long record of publications in which Kronig structure was interpreted in terms of the simple Kronig theory. Until the 1970s fully 2% of the papers published in Phys. Rev. were devoted to x-ray absorption spectroscopy and most invoked Kronig's theory.|$|E

40|$|The {{analysis}} of stress relaxation tests in viscoelastic materials is discussed. Stress relaxation tests are performed {{by means of}} a two-stage process, as a stretching stage up to an assumed strain level, according to a given strain rate, followed by a constant strain stage. Major attention is devoted to the influence of <b>experimental</b> <b>variables,</b> namely the strain level and the strain rate during stretching stage, on the subsequent relaxation phenomena. A constitutive analysis to interpret the behaviour shown by experimental tests is performed, accounting for the influence of the above mentioned <b>experimental</b> <b>variables,</b> to get an actual definition of time dependent behaviour of the material. This procedure is applied to investigate stress relaxation phenomena in polymeric materials and soft biological tissues, as ligaments.

40|$|Abstract Background Implementation {{of medical}} {{interventions}} may vary with organization and available capacity. The influence of this source of variability on the cost-effectiveness can be evaluated by computer simulation following a carefully designed experimental design. We used this approach {{as part of}} a national implementation study of ultrasonographic infant screening for developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH). Methods First, workflow and performance of the current screening program (physical examination) was analyzed. Then, <b>experimental</b> <b>variables,</b> i. e., relevant entities in the workflow of screening, were defined with varying levels to describe alternative implementation models. To determine the relevant levels literature and interviews among professional stakeholders are used. Finally, cost-effectiveness ratios (inclusive of sensitivity analyses) for the range of implementation scenarios were calculated. Results The four <b>experimental</b> <b>variables</b> for implementation were: 1) location of the consultation, 2) integrated with regular consultation or not, 3) number of ultrasound machines and 4) discipline of the screener. With respective numbers of levels of 3, 2, 3, 4 in total 72 possible scenarios were identified. In our model <b>experimental</b> <b>variables</b> related to the number of available ultrasound machines and the necessity of an extra consultation influenced the cost-effectiveness most. Conclusions Better information comes available for choosing optimised implementation strategies where organizational and capacity variables are important using the combination of simulation models and an experimental design. Information to determine the levels of <b>experimental</b> <b>variables</b> can be extracted from the literature or directly from experts. </p...|$|R
