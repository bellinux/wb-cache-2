Wearing a bikini and buttocks-bearing chaps, she is lowered from a cage into a boxing ring and dances, accompanied by several back-up dancers. A masked woman is {{lowered into the}} ring, and the two engage in foxy boxing. The scene is intercut with sequences of Aguilera dancing in a crop top, which she later removes to reveal a bra, and a microskirt. Redman then proceeds down a hallway, passing people such as mud wrestlers, a contortionist, and furries. The video proceeds to a scene of Aguilera and back-up dancers splashing and dancing while being sprayed with water in a room containing several urinals, as a possible reference to urolagnia. It features several sexual fetishes, from mud wrestling to muscle worshipping.|$|E

Through extensive interrogations, the North Vietnamese soldier revealed the whereabouts of North Vietnamese units; the 10th Infantry Division had encircled Duc Lap, while the 320A Infantry Division had arrived in Ea H’leo and were <b>gearing</b> <b>up</b> for an assault on Thuan Man, and an unknown unit was heading towards Ban Me Thuot. In late February, North Vietnamese artillery shells began to rain down on Pleiku, which convinced General Phu that the North Vietnamese would attack Pleiku instead of Ban Me Thuot. South Vietnamese military intelligence and information received from the American Embassy in Saigon showed the presence of {{about two or three}} North Vietnamese combat divisions positioned about 20kilometres away from Kontum and Pleiku. Indeed, the movements around Pleiku and Kontum during the month of February were designed by the North Vietnamese Tay Nguyen Front to fool South Vietnamese military commanders in the Central Highlands.|$|E

40|$|<b>GEAR</b> <b>UP,</b> a federally-funded pre-college {{outreach}} program, {{strives to}} provide academic and other supports to {{middle and high}} school students and their families to help them prepare for, and pursue, higher education. <b>GEAR</b> <b>UP</b> was established in 1998 by President Clinton through Title IV of the 1998 Amendments to the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA). This paper utilizes a phenomenological frame to explore certain key considerations involved in the initial implementation phases of a <b>GEAR</b> <b>UP</b> grant. Four distinct qualitative phenomenological perspectives from Southern Connecticut State University (SCSU) faculty members involved in a current State of Connecticut <b>GEAR</b> <b>UP</b> grant Alliance are shared. Through these four accounts, qualitative, descriptive information about specific systemic, organizational, content, and procedural factors to consider when beginning implementation and planning for a 6 -year university-school district partnership like <b>GEAR</b> <b>UP</b> are considered. The insights are not necessarily limited to <b>GEAR</b> <b>UP,</b> however, and may be applicable to other partnership initiatives and/or other large-scale program implementation efforts...|$|R

5|$|The event's tenth stage {{featured}} a summit finish to Monte Terminillo. The general classification contenders {{were all in}} a group together {{as they reached the}} final climb of the day. Piotr Ugrumov {{was the first of the}} group to attack and was joined by Roberto Conti shortly after. Behind, Indurain led a chase group that contained Andrew Hampsten, Chiappucci, Giovannetti, and Luis Herrera, while general classification hopefuls Chioccioli and Fignon dropped off the back since they could not keep pace. The group caught Conti, who was alone after Ugrumov slowed, and from there, Herrera attacked to win the stage. The next day's route was an undulating one. Chioccioli, Roberto Pagnin, and Marco Lietti formed a breakaway group and gained an advantage of three and a half minutes over the main field which was led by Indurain's team, Banesto. The group remained in front, Pagnin took the stage victory, and Indurain finished over two minutes later. With around nine kilometers remaining in the twelfth stage, there was an accident that saw Chiappicci and Giovannetti amongst others go down. The peloton continued on, <b>gearing</b> <b>up</b> for a sprint finish that Leoni won.|$|E

40|$|Leadership Policy and Organizations Department {{capstone}} projectThis report {{examines the}} role of <b>GEAR</b> <b>UP</b> site coordinators and school counselors {{in the development and}} implementation of <b>GEAR</b> <b>UP</b> Tennessee. The <b>GEAR</b> <b>UP</b> Tennessee program is an ambitious effort that offers a myriad of interventions to support academic preparation and college access in rural communities across the state. Though supported by a network of local and state partners, the program gives the nine participating districts discretion in the design and implementation of initiatives at the local level. Site coordinators are the primary agents charged with the responsibility of district-level implementation. Within the school context, school counselors are the individuals with the organizational proximity necessary for meaningful interactions with students concerning educational advancement. While <b>GEAR</b> <b>UP</b> Tennessee has collected data relative to the program's effects on schools, teachers, and parents, the work of site coordinators and school counselors has been largely overlooked. Therefore, in response to a request for assistance from the Tennessee Higher Education Commission (THEC), we developed the following research questions: How does the program structure and district context shape site 1) coordinators' implementation of <b>GEAR</b> <b>UP?</b> 2) What factors affect school counselors' implementation of <b>GEAR</b> <b>UP</b> initiatives? We conducted 63 semi-structured interviews with <b>GEAR</b> <b>UP</b> site coordinators, district leaders, school principals, school counselors and THEC officials. Interviews were designed to gather information on the district's performance in preparing students for post-secondary education; the respondent's knowledge of and role within GEAR UP; district and school supports and barriers affecting implementation, which include issues around individual and institutional capacity and will; the coherence of program messages and the sense-making in which respondents engaged to make decisions about their participation in the program and its implementation; and respondents' perceptions of program effects. Our data reveal that: Participating school districts were pressured by, and as a result largely focused on, No Child Left Behind (NCLB) compliance. The presence of NCLB largely detracted from the district's ability to fully embrace <b>GEAR</b> <b>UP</b> and integrate it into their district improvement plan. District and school leaders possessed little knowledge about <b>GEAR</b> <b>UP,</b> its intended implementation, and the appropriate role structure of site coordinators, district personnel, and school personnel. Most site coordinators did not perceive <b>GEAR</b> <b>UP</b> as a potential lever for systemic change. Site coordinators and school counselors received little substantive support from state and local leadership relative to implementation of <b>GEAR</b> <b>UP</b> college access interventions. The content of site coordinators' work focused predominantly on activity planning, resource distribution, and grant compliance. The community culture, specifically the "welfare state of mind," was perceived by all respondents as a barrier to advancing students' educational attainment. Training and professional development activities have been provided for site coordinators with a primary focus on grant compliance and reporting mechanisms. Site coordinators reported few opportunities to deepen their knowledge of how to increase students' academic preparation and college access, which has significant effects on implementation outcomes, program sustainability, and systemic change. Training for district and school personnel has been lacking and, in many cases, nonexistent. The work of school counselors is influenced by the lack of a coherent counseling curriculum, time constraints, and role ambiguity. Consequently, counselors provide sporadic support and leadership in <b>GEAR</b> <b>UP</b> implementation. As a result of these findings, we offer the following recommendations to ensure full program implementation and the attainment of program goals: 1) Improve the visibility and effectiveness of site coordinators by developing communication networks among coordinators and school and district personnel; creating comprehensive training manuals for coordinators; and implementing a series of trainings which address the factors influencing students' academic preparation and college access, as well as program implementation strategies supportive of <b>GEAR</b> <b>UP</b> goals. 2) Educate and involve district and school leadership by developing a <b>GEAR</b> <b>UP</b> TN Leaders Guide in tandem with <b>GEAR</b> <b>UP</b> TN leadership trainings. Trainings will create the forum to collaboratively plan with site coordinators in order to align <b>GEAR</b> <b>UP</b> TN interventions to both the district and school improvement plans. 3) Educate and involve the school counselor by developing a <b>GEAR</b> <b>UP</b> TN School Counselors Guide in tandem with <b>GEAR</b> <b>UP</b> TN counseling trainings. Trainings will help counselors implement college preparation curricula, improve collaborative planning with site coordinators, and develop communication networks among counselors. 4) Collectively develop a comprehensive sustainability plan which determines how to effectively disseminate data; galvanize support of the school counselor as well as district and school leadership within <b>GEAR</b> <b>UP</b> TN; and effect state-level policy change to enhance the core goals of <b>GEAR</b> <b>UP</b> TN.

25|$|The {{appearance}} of cervical mucus and vulvar sensation are generally described together as {{two ways of}} observing the same sign. Cervical mucus is produced by the cervix, which connects the uterus to the vaginal canal. Fertile cervical mucus promotes sperm life by decreasing the acidity of the vagina, and also it helps guide sperm through the cervix and into the uterus. The production of fertile cervical mucus is caused by estrogen, the same hormone that prepares a woman's body for ovulation. By observing her cervical mucus and {{paying attention to the}} sensation as it passes the vulva, a woman can detect when her body is <b>gearing</b> <b>up</b> for ovulation, and also when ovulation has passed. When ovulation occurs, estrogen production drops slightly and progesterone starts to rise.
