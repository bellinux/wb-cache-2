25|$|Arkan {{became an}} {{untouchable}} criminal figure in Belgrade {{and all of}} the former Yugoslavia. He was really so powerful, so strong financially that no one could do anything about him.... In 1993, I learned that Željko Ražnatović, Arkan, had in Belgrade kidnapped and taken to Erdut and there killed Isa Lero... also a man from the criminal underground who had come into conflict with Arkan. I even found a witness to the murder. I publicly accused Arkan. I submitted a report to the police. The police inspectors came to see me. We talked about it. <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>them</b> all the information I had, but then the police inspector told me that they were aware of it but that they were unable to prove it because of the fear among the potential witnesses. So the police were quite well-informed about his criminal activities, but {{it was very hard to}} prove anything or to bring charges because his support network was so widespread, and this can be shown through various newspaper articles and so on. In one television statement, I told him when we were debating on TV, that he had pulled a sock over his head more often than I had pulled one on my feet.|$|E

500|$|While taking acting {{classes in}} Los Angeles, Pfeiffer {{was taken in}} by a {{seemingly}} friendly couple who ran a metaphysics and vegetarian cult. While they helped Pfeiffer to stop drinking, smoking, or doing drugs, the couple took control of her entire life. Much of her money went to the group. [...] "I was brainwashed... <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>them</b> {{an enormous amount of}} money." [...] Pfeiffer, insecure, felt that she could no longer live without them. At an acting class taught by Milton Katselas in Los Angeles, Pfeiffer met fellow budding actor, Peter Horton, and they began dating.|$|E

500|$|The Game {{recorded}} tracks {{based on}} his life experiences from his childhood to his success as a rapper. When asked about the album, he stated: [...] The rapper commented on the album's perception before its release, saying, [...] "I know everybody was expecting gang-bang, 40-ounce, low-rider music, but that's not what <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>them...</b> I'm telling a real story, and maybe {{there are people out}} there who can relate to my experiences." [...] Rolling Stone observed that [...] "every song has a well-massaged hook and some immediate appeal, and verses that don't waste a lot of time getting to the point." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Book of the Stranger" [...] was {{directed}} by Daniel Sackheim. He joined the series as a director in the sixth season. He also directed the previous episode, [...] "Oathbreaker". In an interview Sackheim commented on the Jon and Sansa reunion stating [...] "Sometimes as a director, you're just looking at what's in front of you, and not {{taking into account the}} bigger picture and the epic nature of two siblings who have been separated for six seasons — and have never had scenes together, and were both really looking forward to it — reuniting. The only note <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>them</b> during the scene was, [...] "Hold yourself back. As much as it's joyous to see each other, you're equally as scared. You don't know what to expect." [...] The operative word was fear. Fear of the unknown. In a way, it added to the emotional resonance of the scene." ...|$|E
500|$|Super Mario 64 {{features}} more puzzles than earlier Mario games. It was developed simultaneously with , but as Ocarina of Time was released {{more than two}} years later, some puzzles were taken for Super Mario 64. Information about Super Mario 64 leaked in November 1995, and a playable version of the game was presented days later as part of the Nintendo 64 premiere (then known as the [...] "Ultra 64") at Nintendo Space World. At this point, the basic controls had been implemented and the game was 50% finished, featuring 32 courses, though only about 2% of mapping was complete. Miyamoto had hoped to create more courses, but only 15 courses could fit. According to Nintendo of America chairman Howard Lincoln, Miyamoto's desire to add more to the game was {{a major factor in the}} decision to delay the Nintendo 64 release from Christmas 1995 to April 1996. Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi later commented, [...] "Game creators can finish games quickly if they compromise. But users have sharp eyes. They soon know if the games are compromised. [...] asked for two more months and <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>them</b> to him unconditionally." ...|$|E

500|$|The band {{began to}} grow {{suspicious}} that Secor was keeping the money from selling the tape, and contacted their lawyer – Joe Escalante of The Vandals, who also owned independent record label Kung Fu Records. The group informed as Escalante that they believed [...] "someone's bootlegging it," [...] and requested his legal help to stop Secor. In exchange for legal fees, Blink-182 would allow Escalante's label, Kung Fu, to re-release Buddha on compact disc. The band had told Secor to not sell any more copies of the tape, but they held suspicions that he had anyway. Anonymously, Escalante ordered a tape from Secor, and Secor sold it to him. The band asserted {{that they were not}} receiving royalties for these sales. [...] "I paid off all of the royalties for the remaining stash of tapes that I had of Buddha," [...] said Secor in 2001. [...] "It was about 25. The tapes sold for five bucks, and <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>them</b> half of what their profit would be. I wanted to have a few to give to people and to have on hand." [...] Secor felt it was his right to sell his stock of the tape, as the band [...] "had been paid royalties for that already." ...|$|E
500|$|By early 1975, Nixon's {{health was}} improving. He {{maintained}} {{an office in}} a Coast Guard station 300 yards from his home, at first taking a golf cart and later walking the route each day; he mainly worked on his memoirs. He had hoped to wait before writing his memoirs; {{the fact that his}} assets were being eaten away by expenses and lawyer fees compelled him to begin work quickly. He was handicapped in this work {{by the end of his}} transition allowance in February, which compelled him to part with many of his staff, including Ziegler. In August of that year, he met with British talk-show host and producer David Frost, who paid him $600,000 (...) for a series of sit-down interviews, filmed and aired in 1977. They began on the topic of foreign policy, recounting the leaders he had known, but the most remembered section of the interviews was that on Watergate. Nixon admitted that he had [...] "let down the country" [...] and that [...] "I brought myself down. <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>them</b> a sword and they stuck it in. And they twisted it with relish. And, I guess, if I'd been in their position, I'd have done the same thing." [...] The interviews garnered 45–50million viewers—becoming the most-watched program of their kind in television history.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the years}} to follow, 50 Cent would {{continue}} to struggle to maintain a palatable working relationship with Interscope. In a 2012 interview, he explained {{the reason for the}} discord: [...] "The deal <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>them</b> was so well-put-together for them that they were to receive $750,000 in advance on the next albums - each one of the artists. They gotta remove that in this climate of record sales".|$|E
2500|$|In addition, {{none of the}} parties, {{save for}} perhaps Gene Clark, seemed willing to {{contribute}} their best material to the album, instead holding back their finest songs for their own individual solo projects. [...] This has been confirmed by Hillman, who told author John Einarson [...] "I'll be honest, I contributed my worst material because I {{was getting ready to}} do a solo record, Slipping Away, and I was saving all my good stuff and contributed this throwaway stuff that was awful. Crosby's stuff was sketchy and Roger had 'Born To Rock & Roll', which was terrible, yuck." [...] McGuinn also supported the suggestion that some band members had held back their best material, although he added [...] "I don't think I was guilty of that. <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>them</b> my best stuff at the time." ...|$|E

Al," [...] to Jolson, and presented a copy personally to Jolson's widow. With one of his later wives, Connie Stevens, he had a daughter, Joely Fisher, whose name honors Jolson.|$|E
2500|$|Although the archbishopric enjoyed full {{internal}} autonomy, {{the goals}} of Boris I were scarcely fulfilled. [...] A Greek liturgy offered by a Byzantine clergy furthered neither the cultural development of the Bulgarians, nor the consolidation of the Bulgarian state; it would have eventually resulted {{in the loss of}} both the identity of the people and the statehood of Bulgaria. Thus, Boris I greeted the arrival of the disciples of the recently deceased Saints Cyril and Methodius in 886 as an opportunity. Boris <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>them</b> the task to instruct the future Bulgarian clergy in the Glagolitic alphabet and the Slavonic liturgy prepared by Cyril. [...] The liturgy was based on the vernacular of the Slavs from the region of Thessaloniki. In 893, Boris I expelled the Greek clergy from the country and ordered the replacement of the Greek language with the Slav-Bulgarian vernacular.|$|E
2500|$|The Shabbat, {{according}} to Ezekiel 20:12 is God's sign ("ot") between Him and His people. It states, [...] "Moreover also <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>them</b> my shabbats, to {{be a sign}} between me and them, that they might know that I am the LORD that sanctify them." [...] The Shabbat was instituted on the seventh day of creation for all mankind, and God did three things as our example in Genesis 2:1-3... 1) He rested from all work, 2) He blessed the Shabbat, and 3) God sanctified the seventh day, which means He set it apart for only Holy use. [...] The ten commandments in Exodus 20:8-12 explain further that, [...] "six days shall you labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is the Shabbat of the Lord your God, in that day you shall do no work".|$|E

His funeral service was attended by Michael Jackson, Harry Wayne Casey, Jennifer Valoppi and Nat Kipner. Valoppi, a family friend said, [...] "It was emotional, there was humor. Everybody talked about how this was a man who really celebrated life and so this was a celebration of his life." [...] Gibb's ex-wife Lulu was reported to have attended his funeral. Kipner, who managed the early Bee Gees career in Australia in 1966 spoke fondly of his memories: [...] "But I had a business in Australia and I didn't want to go. So <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>them</b> their contract back. One of the dumb things I've done", he joked.|$|E
2500|$|Several sources {{suggested}} possible {{motives for}} Wong's attack, including feelings of being [...] "degraded and disrespected" [...] for his poor English language skills, depression over losing his job, and difficulty in finding work in New York. A {{few years before}} the killings, he had worked as an engineer at Endicott Interconnect Technologies, a high-tech electronics company. In 2004, the company laid off five percent of its workforce. A coworker from that time said of him, [...] "He was quiet—not a violent person" [...] and [...] "I can't believe he {{would do something like}} this". Press TV noted that Taliban leader Baituallah Mehsud claimed responsibility for the shootings, stating, [...] "They were my men. <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>them</b> orders in reaction to US drone attacks." [...] However, a spokesman for the Federal Bureau of Investigation discounted the claim as inconsistent with their evidence that Wong was a lone gunman.|$|E
