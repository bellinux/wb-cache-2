As the realization that they have failed sets in, <b>Hagga</b> begins to laugh inexplicably until she cries, producing an abundance of jewels. <b>Hagga</b> informs them that the magic spell that let her cry tears was altered, so whereas [...] "the jewels of sorrow shall last beyond all common measure", the jewels of laughter shall give [...] "little pleasure": jewels from the tears of happiness will return to the state of tears a fortnight after they are made. The Golux counts out a thousand, and they return to the castle after thanking her.|$|E
5000|$|Kambala is {{traditionally}} a simple sport which essentially, to entertain rural {{people of the}} area. The 'track' used for Kambala is a slushy paddy field. [...] The contest generally takes place between two pairs of buffaloes, each pair race in wet rice fields, controlled by a whip-lashing farmer. [...] Historically, the winning pair of buffaloes was rewarded with coconuts and bananas. Today, gold coins, silver coins are given; in some competitions, cash award is also popular. Some organising committees award eight gram gold coin as first prize. However, Kambala today has become an organised rural sport, with elaborate planning and scheduling to accommodate competietions at different places. The [...] "Kambala Committee" [...] is formed and arranges races in several categories like Kane Halage, <b>Hagga</b> Hiriya, <b>Hagga</b> Kiriya, Halage, Adda Halage etc. People place massive bets on the buffaloes to win and one can witness more than 20,000 spectators in a well-organised Kambala, egging on and cheering the buffaloes to complete the race.|$|E

[...] Faced with his failure {{and the loss of}} his jewels, the wrathful Duke dares the Todal to attack. The story ends with Hark entering an empty room to find the Duke's sword on the floor and a puddle of tears dripping from the table; in the distance, he can just make out the sound of someone laughing.|$|R

50|$|The Stuart <b>Hagga</b> Gallery {{opened in}} the Fall of 2011. It was created by {{restoring}} Mr. Boddy's original garage and then doubling it in size {{with the addition of}} acontemporary building, nestled into the hillside behind the structure. The Stuart Haaga Gallery, open year-round, presents three exhibitions per year of contemporary artist's work that portrays such themes as nature, ecology, botany, horticulture, garden design and history, and other subjects relevant to a botanical garden setting. The gallery is open 10:00 am to 4:00 pm daily except Mondays. Admission to the gallery is free with gardens admission.|$|E
5000|$|Projectra (often {{called by}} her {{nickname}} [...] "Jeckie" [...] a shortened form of her name) {{is a member}} of the royal family of the low-tech planet Orando, and possesses the superhuman ability to generate illusions affecting all five senses. During her membership in the LSH, she met, fell in love with, and married the martial artist Karate Kid. After her father King Voxv died, she fought her cousin Pharoxx and her mentor <b>Hagga,</b> who sought to usurp the throne. Afterward she became Queen Projectra of Orando, and she and Karate Kid became reserve members of the Legion of Super-Heroes. When the Legion of Super-Villains invaded Orando, Nemesis Kid defeated Karate Kid in personal combat and killed him. Projectra subsequently killed Nemesis Kid in revenge, claiming royal privilege to do so even though it violated the Legion's code against killing. She resigned from the Legion of Super-Heroes during Karate Kid's funeral and used the Legion of Super-Villains' warp devices to take Orando to another dimension to preserve them from 30th century technology and dangers.|$|E
50|$|Rathjens {{and his two}} {{colleagues were}} {{accredited}} with making the first archaeological dig in Yemen. The Imam Yahya had sent the three German scholars to Huqqa to dig an ancient grave. Rathjens could not convince the Imam that {{the three of them}} were not archaeologists. The three German scholars left for Huqqa near <b>Hagga</b> with a delegation of fifty soldiers and an inspector. With the help of fifty local workers, they unearthed a grave from the second century CE. Rathjens assumed that in Yemen, archaeology was in its nascent stages and that it should be encouraged and expanded. He reasoned, however, that the research should be done in a professional way, employing scientific methods. This gave him the incentive to request from Imam Yahya that he establish a Ministry of Antiquities and to build a museum in which the archaeological findings could be stored and preserved. Rathjens also suggested that the Imam should invite from Germany a team consisting of an archaeologist and philologist for ancient Semitic languages in order to inspect the excavations, as well as to document their findngs and do the deciphering of the inscriptions, by using strict scientific methods as those used in Europe.|$|E
40|$|In Caliphate and Kingship in a Fifteenth-Century Literary History of Muslim Leadership and Pilgrimage Jo Van Steenbergen {{presents}} a new study, edition and translation of al-Ḏahab al-Masbūk fī Ḏikr man <b>Ḥağğa</b> min al-Ḫulafāʾ wa-l-Mulūk, a summary {{history of the}} Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca by al-Maqrīzī (766 - 845 AH/ca. 1365 - 1442 CE). Traditionally considered as a useful source {{for the history of}} the ḥağğ, al-Ḏahab al-Masbūk is re-interpreted here as a complex literary construction that was endowed with different meanings. Through detailed contextualist, narratological, semiotic and codicological analyses Van Steenbergen demonstrates how these meanings were deeply embedded in early-fifteenth century Egyptian transformations, how they changed substantially over time, and how they included particular claims about authorship and about legitimate and good Muslim rule...|$|E
40|$|Objective: In {{southeast}} Yemen, {{visceral leishmaniasis}} (VL) is endemic in Lahj and Abyan {{and also in}} <b>Hagga</b> and Sadah, the areas lacking adequate diagnostic facilities. This study describes the clinical and hematological features in 64 cases of childhood VL. Material and Methods: All children below 12 years of age who were managed as inpatient cases from 1 January to 31 December 2005 were included in this study. The diagnosis of VL was established by demonstration of leishmania parasites in bone marrow aspiration. Demographic information, physical signs at presentation and results of complete blood count were recorded and bone marrow aspirations were done for LD bodies. Results: Mean age of the patients was 30 months, and there were 33 females and 31 males. Fever was seen in 100 % of children with duration before diagnosis of 56 days. Splenomegaly was present in all cases and hepatomegaly in 84. 4 %, with mean enlargement of spleen and liver of 9. 3 and 3. 5 cm, respectively. Mean hemoglobin level, white blood cell and platelet counts were 6. 6 g/dl, 3. 58 x 109 /L and 71. 7 x 109 /L, respectively. Absolute neutrophil count was < 0. 78 x 109 /L and mean reticulocyte count was 1. 7 %. Conclusion: Fever, hepatosplenomegaly and pancytopenia were the most common clinical and hematological manifestations in Yemeni children with VL...|$|E
40|$|Lipoprotein lipase (LPL; triacylglycero-protein acylhydrolase, EC 3. 1. 1. 34) was {{purified}} from bovine milk. Synthetic oligonucleotides were prepared, {{based on}} the amino acid sequences of three peptides obtained from partial digestion of purified LPL, and were used as probes to isolate cDNA clones for LPL mRNA from a bovine mammary gland. One of the clones, pLPL- 49 R 2, contains an insert cDNA (49 R 2) of about 3. 2 kilobases (kb) that hybridizes to all three probes and encodes a polypeptide that includes the NH 2 -terminal sequence of bovine LPL reported recently [Ben-Avram, C. M., Ben-Zeev, O., Lee, T. D., <b>Hagga,</b> K., Shively, J. E., Goers, J., Pedersen, M. E., Reeve, J. R. & Schotz, M. C. (1986) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 83, 4185 - 4189]. Complete nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that cDNA insert 49 R 2 contains the entire coding region for LPL {{as well as a}} 3 ' untranslated region of about 1. 6 kb. The predicted amino acid sequence indicates that bovine LPL is a hydrophilic protein consisting of 450 amino acids (Mr 50, 548) in its unglycosylated form. Blot hybridization analysis of poly(A) + mRNA from bovine mammary gland demonstrated that {{there are at least three}} sizes of LPL mRNAs [...] 3. 2, 2. 5, and 1. 7 kb [...] with the 2. 5 -kb mRNA being the most abundant. Restriction endonuclease mapping of other cDNA clones suggested that the variation in mRNA size results from differential utilization of polyadenylylation signals during mRNA processing...|$|E
