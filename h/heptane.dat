Addition of an entraining agent, such as benzene, cyclohexane, or <b>heptane,</b> allows a new ternary azeotrope comprising the ethanol, water, and the entraining agent to be formed. This lower-boiling ternary azeotrope is removed preferentially, leading to water-free ethanol.|$|E

25|$|The {{first four}} names {{were derived from}} methanol, ether, propionic acid and butyric acid, {{respectively}} (hexadecane is also {{sometimes referred to as}} cetane). Alkanes with five or more carbon atoms are named by adding the suffix -ane to the appropriate numerical multiplier prefix with elision of any terminal vowel (-a or -o) from the basic numerical term. Hence, pentane, C5H12; hexane, C6H14; <b>heptane,</b> C7H16; octane, C8H18; etc. The prefix is generally Greek, however alkanes with a carbon atom count ending in nine, for example nonane, use the Latin prefix non-.

25|$|From pentane to octane the alkanes {{are highly}} {{volatile}} liquids. They {{are used as}} fuels in internal combustion engines, as they vaporize easily on entry into the combustion chamber without forming droplets, which would impair the uniformity of the combustion. Branched-chain alkanes are preferred as they are much less prone to premature ignition, which causes knocking, than their straight-chain homologues. This propensity to premature ignition {{is measured by the}} octane rating of the fuel, where 2,2,4-trimethylpentane (isooctane) has an arbitrary value of 100, and <b>heptane</b> has a value of zero. Apart from their use as fuels, the middle alkanes are also good solvents for nonpolar substances.|$|E

Specifically, the study compares all acyclic hexanes (five constitutional isomers, a. k. a. regioisomers), all nine <b>heptanes,</b> all 18 octanes, all 35 nonanes, and all 75 decanes.

The first emergence of chirality (i. e., enantiomerism) occurred in some <b>heptanes.</b> Diastereoisomerism and meso-isomers appear with some octanes, while a pseudoasymmetric center exists in a decane regioisomer.

First, a correlation was developed that relates the composition of a retrograde gas-condensate mixture at any depletion stage to the composition at its dew point pressure. This correlation is as accurate as previous correlations, and in addition, to the composition, it includes the trends for molecular weight of <b>heptanes</b> plus fraction (A 4 WC 7 +), specific gravity of <b>heptanes</b> plus fraction (SGC 7 +), gas produced (GP) and fraction of liquid (FL). Second, a correlation to describe the molar distribution Of C 7 + of a gas-condensate mixture as a function of carbon number (CN), the C 6 mole fraction and the properties Of C 7 + has been developed. For comparison, the Ahmed, et aL, and Whitson methods were evaluated using a data base of 52 extended (from C] 5 + and up) retrograde gascondensate samples. The evaluation of the Ahmed, et al. and Whitson methods showed that both methods are better than the new method. The Ahmed, et aL method does a better overall job than the Vvlhitson method. Comparing the relative error, Ahmed, et al. method had an error of 20. 6 percent, and Whitson's method had an error of 25. 1 percent. Third, a new and improved retrograde dew point pressure correlation has been developed. The new dew point correlation is an improvement of the Kennedy-Nemeth dew point correlation.
