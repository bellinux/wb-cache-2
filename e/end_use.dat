25|$|Designing and {{implementing}} {{the most efficient}} floor system is key to creating optimal building structures.

25|$|Polyols can be {{polyether}} polyols, {{which are}} made by the reaction of epoxides with an active hydrogen containing compounds. Polyester polyols are made by the polycondensation of multifunctional carboxylic acids and polyhydroxyl compounds. They can be further classified according to their <b>end</b> <b>use.</b> Higher molecular weight polyols (molecular weights from 2,000 to 10,000) are used to make more flexible polyurethanes while lower molecular weight polyols make more rigid products.|$|E

25|$|Many {{formulae}} {{include an}} S-curve, where the price formula is different {{above and below}} a certain oil price, to dampen the impact of high oil prices on the buyer, and low oil prices on the seller. Most of the LNG trade is governed by long term contracts. When the spot LNG price are cheaper than long term oil price indexed contracts, the most profitable LNG <b>end</b> <b>use</b> is to power mobile engines for replacing costly gasoline and diesel consumption.|$|E
25|$|Another {{major factor}} in {{petroleum}} demand is {{the widespread use of}} petroleum products such as plastic. These could be partially replaced by bioplastics, which are derived from renewable plant feedstocks such as vegetable oil, cornstarch, pea starch, or microbiota. They are used either as a direct replacement for traditional plastics or as blends with traditional plastics. The most common <b>end</b> <b>use</b> market is for packaging materials. Japan has also been a pioneer in bioplastics, incorporating them into electronics and automobiles.|$|E
25|$|Natural {{graphite}} in this <b>end</b> <b>use</b> mostly {{goes into}} carbon raising in molten steel, {{although it can}} be used to lubricate the dies used to extrude hot steel. Supplying carbon raisers is very competitive, therefore subject to cut-throat pricing from alternatives such as synthetic graphite powder, petroleum coke, and other forms of carbon. A carbon raiser is added to increase the carbon content of the steel to the specified level. An estimate based on USGS US graphite consumption statistics indicates that 10,500 tonnes were used in this fashion in 2005.|$|E

25|$|The third {{byproduct}} is {{a liquid}} (methanogenic digestate) rich in nutrients, {{which can be}} used as a fertiliser, depending on the quality of the material being digested. Levels of potentially toxic elements (PTEs) should be chemically assessed. This will depend upon the quality of the original feedstock. In the case of most clean and source-separated biodegradable waste streams, the levels of PTEs will be low. In the case of wastes originating from industry, the levels of PTEs may be higher and will need to be taken into consideration when determining a suitable <b>end</b> <b>use</b> for the material.|$|E
25|$|The {{product of}} the {{polymerization}} process is unmodified PVC. Before PVC can be made into finished products, it always requires conversion into a compound by the incorporation of additives (but not necessarily all of the following) such as heat stabilizers, UV stabilizers, plasticizers, processing aids, impact modifiers, thermal modifiers, fillers, flame retardants, biocides, blowing agents and smoke suppressors, and, optionally, pigments. The choice of additives used for the PVC finished product {{is controlled by the}} cost performance requirements of the <b>end</b> <b>use</b> specification (underground pipe, window frames, intravenous tubing and flooring all have very different ingredients to suit their performance requirements). Previously, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were added to certain PVC products as flame retardants and stabilizers.|$|E
25|$|The vast {{majority}} of refined asphalt is used in construction: primarily as a constituent of products used in paving and roofing applications. According {{to the requirements of}} the <b>end</b> <b>use,</b> asphalt is produced to specification. This is achieved either by refining or blending. It is estimated that the current world use of asphalt is approximately 102 million tonnes per year. Approximately 85% of all the asphalt produced is used as the binder in asphalt concrete for roads. It is also used in other paved areas such as airport runways, car parks and footways. Typically, the production of asphalt concrete involves mixing fine and coarse aggregates such as sand, gravel and crushed rock with asphalt, which acts as the binding agent. Other materials, such as recycled polymers (e.g., rubber tyres), may be added to the asphalt to modify its properties according to the application for which the asphalt is ultimately intended.|$|E

Communities in eastern Galveston include Lake Madeline, Offats Bayou, Central City, Fort Crockett, Bayou Shore, Lasker Park, Carver Park, Kempner Park, Old City/Central Business District, San Jacinto, East End, and Lindale. As of 2009 many residents of the west <b>end</b> <b>use</b> golf carts as transportation to take them to and from residential houses, the Galveston Island Country Club, and stores. In 2009, Chief of Police Charles Wiley said he believed golf carts should be prohibited outside golf courses, and West End residents campaigned against any ban on their use.|$|E
500|$|In 1924, indium {{was found}} to have a valued {{property}} of stabilizing non-ferrous metals, and that became the first significant use for the element. The first large-scale application for indium was coating bearings in high-performance aircraft engines during World War II, to protect against damage and corrosion; this is no longer a major use of the element. [...] New uses were found in fusible alloys, solders, and electronics. In the 1950s, tiny beads of indium were used for the emitters and collectors of PNP alloy-junction transistors. In the middle and late 1980s, the development of indium phosphide semiconductors and indium tin oxide thin films for liquid-crystal displays (LCD) aroused much interest. By 1992, the thin-film application had become the largest <b>end</b> <b>use.</b>|$|E

40|$|The 'end use' {{of water}} is a {{breakdown}} of the total household water usage such as water used for toilets, showers, washing machines, taps, lawn watering, etc. Understanding <b>end</b> <b>uses</b> of water will enable water planners, water authorities and household owners determine where water is used/wasted, how much and how often. This paper describes the <b>end</b> <b>uses</b> of water from a number of single-family homes in Greater Melbourne, Australia. The study involves the analysis of water consumption data recorded at 5 -s intervals from logged households collected by Yarra Valley Water in Melbourne in 2004. The study determines how much water is used for outdoor and indoor purposes in a single-family home in Melbourne and compares the water usage during winter and summer. Hourly patterns of major <b>end</b> <b>uses</b> of water are also developed. The aim {{of this study is to}} improve the understanding of the <b>end</b> <b>uses</b> of water and to assist where to focus water conservation efforts that would be most effective financially and environmentally, and be acceptable to everyone...|$|R
