500|$|In {{creating}} the visual look for Miles, Pichelli followed her usual practice of approaching the design by giving {{thought to the}} character's personality, including the background that influenced it, and the distinctive traits that he would exhibit, such as the clothing he wears, his body language and expressions. Pichelli also designed Spider-Man's new costume, a mostly black outfit with red webbing and a red spider logo. Pichelli had worked on four issues of Ultimate Spider-Man before she was approached {{to work on the}} new title with Miles Morales. Pichelli, who works with a Cintiq 12wx <b>graphic</b> <b>tablet,</b> added more screentones to her illustrations to give what she called [...] "a more 'pop' feeling to the book", which she felt would be fitting to the series.|$|E

50|$|Graphic tablets, {{because of}} their stylus-based {{interface}} and ability to detect {{some or all of}} pressure, tilt, and other attributes of the stylus and its interaction with the tablet, are widely considered to offer a very natural way to create computer graphics, especially two-dimensional computer graphics.

50|$|The first <b>graphic</b> <b>tablet</b> {{resembling}} contemporary tablets {{and used}} for handwriting recognition by a computer was the Stylator in 1957. Better known (and often misstated as the first digitizer tablet) is the RAND Tablet {{also known as the}} Grafacon (for Graphic Converter), introduced in 1964. The RAND Tablet employed a grid of wires under the surface of the pad that encoded horizontal and vertical coordinates in a small magnetic signal. The stylus would receive the magnetic signal, which could then be decoded back as coordinate information.|$|E
50|$|A talking tactile tablet or T3 is a <b>graphic</b> <b>tablet</b> {{with a touch}} {{surface that}} can be used as an input device that uses swell paper to create 3D {{overlays}} and connects audio files to parts of the overlays.

It can be used to help visually impaired users to interpret diagrams, charts and maps by producing a tactile, touchable image, and audio feedback.|$|E
50|$|A <b>graphic</b> <b>tablet</b> (also {{known as}} a digitizer, drawing tablet, digital drawing tablet, pen tablet, or digital art board) is a {{computer}} input device that enables a user to hand-draw images, animations and graphics, with a special pen-like stylus, {{similar to the way}} a person draws images with a pencil and paper. These tablets may also be used to capture data or handwritten signatures. It {{can also be used to}} trace an image from a piece of paper which is taped or otherwise secured to the tablet surface. Capturing data in this way, by tracing or entering the corners of linear poly-lines or shapes, is called digitizing.|$|E
