40|$|Abstract. The pigtail {{catheter}} is {{a medical}} device inserted into the human body during interventional surgeries such as the transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). The catheter {{is characterized by a}} tightly curled end in order to remain attached to a valve pocket during the intervention, and it is used to inject contrast agent for the visualization of the vessel in fluoroscopy. Due to the different possible projection angles in fluoroscopy, the pigtail tip can appear in a variety of different shapes spanning from pure circular to ellipsoid or even line. Furthermore, the appearance of the catheter tip is radically alternated when the contrast agent is injected during the intervention or when it is occluded by other devices. All these factors make the robust real-time detection and tracking of the pigtail catheter a challenging task. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a new tree-structured, hierarchical detection scheme, based on a shape categorization of the pigtail catheter tip, and a combination of novel Haar features. Compared to previously used methods, the proposed framework offers a significant enhancement in the detection performance, providing in the same time accurate information about the orientation {{and the size of the}} detected object. The current framework has been validated on a vast data set consisting of 272 sequences, containing more than 20000 images, and the detection results demonstrate potential for clinical applications. The detection framework proposed <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>disclosure</b> is not limited to pigtail catheter detection, but it can also be applied successfully to any other shape-varying object with similar characteristics. ...|$|E

40|$|EP 1050512 A UPAB: 20010110 NOVELTY - Before {{separation}} of the sludge, amphiphilic agents are added. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - Preferred features: The addition converts the sludge into a state in which it settles under gravity into a compact sediment with clear supernatant liquor. Settlement under gravity continues for 1 hour, or preferably only 15 minutes. Following sedimentation, the liquid is separated by centrifugation. The sediment is then pressed to remove more liquid, which is intercepted. The solid phase is briquetted. The liquid phase is filtered, adding the solids arising, to the previously-separated solid phase. Amphiphilic agent is separated from the liquid and the solid phases by distillation and drying, respectively. It is then recycled, and/or purified by distillation. USE - A method especially suitable for fractionation of sludges, particularly inorganic sludges arising in lapping and honing operations. ADVANTAGE - Complete, immediate {{separation of}} such sludges is not possible. The new process avoids disposal and incineration, offering a method recovering both fluid and solid. Abrasives recovered include e. g. silicon carbide, boron nitride, corundum and/or diamond particles. These comparatively valuable substances can be re-used. Addition of low viscosity lipophiles is ineffective; only by use of short chain amphiphiles is the dispersion significantly de-stabilized, resulting in compact sedimentation under gravity, leaving clear, oil-containing supernatant liquid above. Conventional processes complete preparation of the separated fractions. The method is particularly suitable for sludges containing stable dispersions of oil and emulsifiers, as with lapping and honing abrasives. The viscosity is comparatively high, making conventional separations ineffective. Examples, and comparative tables of results are included <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>disclosure...</b>|$|E

Heidegger writes that metaphysics is in decline and is approaching its end, as the earth informed by metaphysics has become desolate, as {{is evident from the}} events of the last century. This decline marks the oblivion of Being as metaphysics, as the truth of metaphysics has met its desolation. Heidegger argues that metaphysics has been an illusion that sustained reality and is now approaching its end, in place, truth needs to be rethought as the unconcealment of Being as aletheia. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>disclosure</b> of Being, the essence of Being in is factity, thrown-ness, temporality is revealed and the metaphysical past of Being meets its oblivion.

It was found that a statistical difference exists between the indirect and direct disclosure of addresses; more runners disclose their home address via online sports tracking networks than via other sources. Furthermore, it was found that age {{played a role in the}} direct disclosure of addresses but not in the indirect disclosure. Older users more often disclosed their home address directly than younger ones. Conversely, gender plays a role in the indirect disclosure but not in the direct disclosure. Men more often disclosed their home address indirectly than women. Regarding temporal characteristics, it was found that the window of opportunity for a burglary is approximately 1 hour. Furthermore, the `within subject' analysis suggests that the starting hour of the run is the most predictable temporal characteristic, followed by the duration of the run and the day of the week. This research ultimately shows the extent to which the unique combination of spatial and temporal information available in online sports tracking networks can enable criminals to predict where a potential target lives and when he or she will be out running...|$|E
40|$|The nineties {{managerial}} {{reforms have}} introduced {{changes in the}} public organizations’ accounting information system, emphasizing the need for measures of efficiency, timeliness, quality, outcome, etc. (Hood, 1995; Marcon and Panozzo, 1998). These changes have been explained by their proponents in terms of improving organizational accountability and improving decision making (Coy et al., 1997; Lawrence et al., 1997). Accountability has resulted {{to be a key}} principle in the public sector, which has affected the way reporting is organized and designed. As argued by Steccolini (2004), accountability is a multifaceted and complex concept that evolves as social and cultural values change. The citizens’ increasing awareness of the sustainable development principles, for example, has determined a progressive pressure on social and environmental disclosure, bringing private and public organizations to change their reporting practices. Thus, some public organizations have started to disclose sustainability reports, social report, gender report, etc., determining a voluntary change in their practice. Some organizations have also changed the information disclosed through their annual report, as remarked by Neu et al., (1998). Churet and Eccles (2014) found that healthcare is one of the sectors with the higher proportion of organizations integrating the annual report with non-financial information. However, studies about the combination of financial and extra-financial information in the annual report of public sector’ organizations remains a quite under-investigated field. In this sense, studies on Integrated Reporting (IR) practices within public organizations are few (Dumay et al., 2016) but highly recommended (see for e. g. Adams, 2015). This pattern can be recognized also with reference to the Italian setting, where regulations are increasingly requiring companies to integrate financial and non-financial information, while in healthcare {{there is no evidence of}} IR approach. Whether IR would be implemented in the Italian public healthcare sector, additional concerns may be related to the role of the annual report in disclosing organizational performance and providing useful information for decision making. In fact, a national regulation (D. Lgs. 118 / 2011) has defined the structures and contents of the annual report to be delivered by the healthcare organizations (HCOs) to disclose and communicate their results. In particular, the regulation assigns a specific objective to the annual financial report: “to disclose information related to future actions, to actions in progress, to the ongoing situation, to those actors interested in political, social and financial decision making processes” (Article 9). However, Italian public organizations have been found to create those reports mainly to comply with legal requirements, thus providing poor quality reports mainly received by internal users (Steccolini, 2004). This challenges the role that annual reports have as accountability mean (Steccolini, 2004), and how they can be potentially used as integrated reporting practices combining financial with extra-financial information. Therefore, questions may be raised concerning the actors who are actually interested <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>disclosure</b> and for which purposes. Based on the above premise, the paper aims at exploring how management report is framed in the public healthcare sector, and whether an IR practice, as currently raised by the accounting discipline (Cima, 2016) would contribute or not to improve decision making and the public accountability. More in depth, through an exploratory case study undertaken in a public university hospital, the research enters the debate about the adoption of an IR approach in healthcare and deepens both internal and external actors’ perspectives about the need to integrate healthcare organizations’ disclosure with non-financial information. Thus, the research depicts the scenario of the information disclosed by healthcare organizations in the annual report, and deepens whether the integration of additional non-financial dimensions would contribute to report the value creation by healthcare organizations. The paper contributes to literature addressing the call for a deeper investigation of space for IR approaches in the public sector, narrowing the focus on healthcare (Adams, 2015; Dumay et al., 2016). In particular, the research consists in a first attempt to explore the possibilities for the implementation of IR in the Italian healthcare sector. This paper adopts a double perspective, that includes both investors and internal actors’ point of view shedding light on the different perceptions those actors have on the management’ reports combining financial and extra-financial information as a form of prior IR, and the eventuality to introduce within the investigated university’ hospital an IR ex-novo to disclose organizations’ value creation. To this line, the paper aims at addressing the call of Atkins and Maroun (2015) to address broader groups of stakeholders, other than capital providers to analyse integrated reporting practices adopted by organizations. The paper is structured as follow: the next section provides a general overview of IR practices and explores the literature in the field. The third section deepens the state of the art of reporting activities in the Italian healthcare sector, focusing on regulations that require the provision of non-financial information. The fourth section presents the methodological approach adopted in the study and the fifth section explains the findings of the research.
