500|$|On March 30, 2009, it was {{confirmed}} that Taylor and the Junk Beer Kidnap Band would be performing at Rockfest in 2009. The group performed on April 24, 2009 at People's Court in Des Moines, Iowa, marking Taylor's first official solo show. Taylor performs with his band the Dum Fux, who make covers for 1970s punk rock and 1980s hair metal. Taylor also performs with Audacious P, {{a band that}} is primarily a Tenacious D cover band. Rapper Tech N9ne confirmed that Taylor was to perform on his album K.O.D., but was removed because Taylor did not submit his vocals in time. Taylor recently admitted that he tried out for the vacant singer spot in the band Velvet Revolver, but said that <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>did</b> not work out. However, according to a recent Billboard article, it seems likely that he may in fact become the vocalist for Velvet Revolver, though no official confirmation has been made. Duff McKagan added that they can neither [...] "confirm or deny" [...] Taylor's membership in the band but believes that Taylor is the [...] "real deal". Slash has since ruled Corey out as the possible new vocalist explaining that [...] " [...] just wasn't right" [...] although he does love him. He however, has recorded 10 new songs with the band, drummer Matt Sorum stated it's unlikely it will ever be released. Taylor explained to Mark Hoppus on Hoppus on Music that McKagan and he were writing new music for a possible new supergroup.|$|E

The writing day was last Friday, when I ought to have left Boston for New Bedford (fifty-five miles) before eleven in the morning.

I have coughed from two or {{three in the morning}} until five or six, and have been absolutely sleepless. I have had no appetite besides, and no taste. Last night here I took some laudanum, and it {{is the only thing that}} has done me good. But the life in this climate is so very hard. When I did manage to get from Boston to New Bedford, I read with my utmost force and vigour. Next morning, well or ill, I must turn out at seven to get back to Boston on my way here.|$|E

5000|$|He Frank {{proceeded}} {{to fall apart}} before our very eyes. His style that everyone loved was melancholy, very tuneful things. He started doing things that were completely impenetrable. They were basically about psychological angst, played at full volume with lots of thrashing. I don't remember a single word of them, <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>did</b> not work. There was one review that said he belonged on a psychologist's couch. Then shortly after that, he hightailed it back to Woodstock again, because he wasn't getting any work.|$|E

50|$|After it was found, likely {{intact and}} with some but not all panels deployed, what {{happened}} has been re-evaluated since its 2015 discovery. Because the early phase of mission ran on battery power its possible some data was recorded to memory even if it could not get power from its panels.

Also, study of what happened has revealed that Beagle 2 may have gone into its pre-programmed surface operations mode and collected data after landing, <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>did</b> not transmit it, or the transmission was blocked by a closed panel. More operations might be possible with some solar arrays deployed, thus it would be able to have more energy than just the battery.|$|E
5000|$|Corabi was {{featured}} as second guitarist on Brides of Destruction's 2004 album Here Comes The Brides. He had multiple reasons {{for leaving the}} band.

He also said in an interview that [...] "when Nikki told me about the band, I was really into the idea of writing another CD with the heavy sound of the Mötley Crüe album, but as we got more into recording, we had our drummer singing what was supposed to be the best song on the CD, when Nikki and Tracii were saying that our singer was the hot new thing, <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>did</b> not make sense to me." ...|$|E

Ned later breaks up with Elly and warns her to stay away from him, as he will only put her in danger. Feeling rejected, Elly goes to The Waterhole for a drink and meets a stranger, who buys her a drink. When Ned sees them together, he realises the stranger is Jacka Hills (Brad McMurray), the husband of his former lover.

It’s very psychedelic and trippy." [...] — Janelle Monáe on the concept of the video. The music video for [...] "Cold War" [...] was released to Vevo on August 5, 2010. It was directed by Wendy Morgan and shot at the black box auditorium in The Palace of the Dogs sanitarium. The video, which Monáe described as an [...] "emotion picture", features Monáe against a black wall emoting and reacting as the song progresses. During the video, Monáe grimaces, smiles, breaks down, and eventually sheds a tear. Monae described the tears as [...] "spontaneous and triggered a chain reaction."

5000|$|In a study {{performed}} by Karpicke and Smith (2012), four experiments {{were conducted with}} elaborative study conditions based around mnemonics. The experiments consisted of using imagery-based keyword method for Experiments 1 and 2, a verbal elaboration method for Experiment 3, and identical word pairs in Experiment 4. In Experiment 1, participants learned uncommon English words paired with their definition and were divided into three groups- repeated retrieval, repeated study, and drop. After each correct recall in the drop group the pair of words were removed from future study and retrieval tasks. After each correct recall of the repeated study group, the word pairs {{were removed from the}} study groups but not recall groups. After each correct recall of the retrieval group the words were removed from the recall groups but not the study groups. Subjects were asked to recall the word pairings one week later.. Experiment 2 had the same design as the first, but two differences and had the same results as the first experiment. Experiment 3 had similar procedure with Swahili-English word pairs but had a fourth group: repeated elaborations. The results of Experiment 3 showed that long term retention was more effective with repeated retrieval than repeated verbal elaborations. Experiment 4 the subjects were asked to learn word pairs and had different cues for target words or cues that would act as the target word. Results showed that repeated retrieval enhanced long term memory and mnemonics do not stem from elaborations, unless it was for the first recall. The experimenters do not undermine the effects that elaboration has on a persons ability to learn, <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>did</b> not apply in this experiment.|$|E
5000|$|My A&R at the time, Miles Leonard and Jamie Nelson, said, [...] "We've got something. Come {{into the}} office. We've {{got to play}} you something." [...] So I went to the EMIoffice, and I had the same {{reaction}} you did, about 20 seconds in. I couldn't even fathom what I was hearing. <b>It</b> <b>just...</b> <b>did</b> something.

[...] And we did! And that kick-started a whole different phase in my career. — Minogue, about her reaction to hearing the demo of the song. [...] "Can't Get You Out of My Head" [...] was jointly written, composed, and produced by Cathy Dennis and Rob Davis. Dennis and Davis had been brought together by British artist manager Simon Fuller, who wanted the duo to come up with a song for British pop group S Club 7. The song was recorded using Cubase music software, which Davis ran on his Mac computer. Davis began playing an acoustic guitar and ran a 125 beats per minute drum loop, on which Dennis, herself a singer who had enjoyed chart success in the United States, began singing the line [...] "I just can't get you out of my head" [...] in the key of D minor. After three and a half hours, the demo was recorded and the vocals were laid afterwards. Dennis called their recording setup for the song [...] "the most primitive set-up you could imagine! Different producers work in different ways. But it's good to be reminded you don’t have to be reliant on equipment. A song is about melody and lyrics and being able to take something away in your memory that is going to haunt you." [...] She also regarded their production as a [...] "very natural and fluid process," [...] saying: [...] "We know how hard we work sometimes to write songs and then spend months picking them to pieces, but this was the easiest process, the chemicals were all happy and working together." ...|$|E

The main focus will be on the four major leading port fuctions: cargo handling, shipping, fishing-industry and ship-building. The corresponding spatial consequences of the economic upswing and decline of the city will be illustrated on general maps. Future prospects will be examined briefly in the conclusion...|$|E
