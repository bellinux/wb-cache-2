40|$|Abstract. The {{leaching}} rate of 60 Co and 137 Cs from the spent cation exchange resins in cement–b nto ite matrix has been studied. The solidification matrix was a standard Portland cement mixed with 290 – 350 (kg/m 3) spent cation exchange resins, {{with or without}} 2 – 5 % of bentonite clay. The {{leaching rate}}s from the cement– bentonite matrix for 60 Co: (4, 2 – 7, 0) ´ 10 – 5 (cm/d) and 137 Cs: (3, 2 – 6, 6) ´ 10 – 4 (cm/d), after 125 days were measured. From the leaching data the apparent diffusivity of cobalt and cesium in cement–bentonite clay matrix with a waste load of 290 – 35 (kg/m 3) spent cation exchange resins, was measured for 60 Co: (1, 1 – 4, 0) ´ 10 – 6 (cm 2 /d) and 137 Cs: (0, 5 – 2, 6) ´ 10 – 4 (cm 2 /d), after 125 days.

40|$|The {{installation}} of final repositories for nuclear waste {{has been a}} most controversial topic on the German political agenda for decades. The beginning of efforts {{to solve this problem}} {{can be traced back to}} the 1970 s when plans for the establishment of an Integrated Nuclear Waste <b>Disposal</b> <b>Centre</b> (Integriertes Entsorgungszentrum) in the State of Lower Saxony were developed. It was in this context that in 1976, 1 the Atomic Energy Act (AEA) of 19592 (the 2002 consolidated text is reproduced in Supplement to Nuclear Law Bulletin No. 70) was amended by inserting Section 9 a, paragraph 3, sentence 1, which reads very succinctly: “The Federation shall establish installations for the safekeeping and final disposal of radioactive waste. ” Despite the subsequent AEA amendments of Section 9 a, paragraph 3 and the addition of a paragraph 4 (1998) 3 that were to allow the Federation to transfer the exercise of its functions to third parties, these administrative provisions were never used. Accordingly, full responsibility of the Federation for the fulfilment of its obligation under Section 9 a, paragraph 3 of the AEA remains intact today. ...|$|E
40|$|Efficient {{planning}} and design of an appropriate reverse logistics network {{is crucial to the}} economical collection and disposal of scrapped household appliances and electrical products. Such systems are commonly modelled as mixed-integer programs, whose solutions will determine the location of individual facilities that optimize material flow. One of the major drawbacks of current models is that they do not adequately address the important issue of uncertainty in demand and supply. Another deficiency in current models is that they are restricted to a two-echelon system. This study addresses these deficiencies by embodying such uncertainties in the model using the technique of fuzzy-chance constrained programming, and by extending the model to a three-echelon system. A heuristic {{in the form of a}} hybrid genetic algorithm is then employed to generate low-cost solutions. The overall objective is to find economical solutions to the general problem of determining the volume of appliances to be moved between the three echelons of customer base to collection sites, collection sites to disposal centres and <b>disposal</b> <b>centre</b> to landfill centre/remanufacturing centre; and to the problems of positioning the disposal centres and the landfill centre/remanufacturing centres within the problem domain.

5000|$|In Case E-29/15, Sorpa, the Court {{answered}} questions {{referred to it}} by the Supreme Court of Iceland on the interpretation of Article 54 EEA. In 1988, the municipalities {{in the metropolitan area}} of Reykjavík entered into an agreement whereby Sorpa bs. was established as a municipal cooperative agency and was entrusted with waste management tasks. By a decision of 21 December 2012 the Icelandic Competition Authority found that Sorpa had infringed Article 11 of the Icelandic Competition Act pertaining to the abuse of a dominant position. It found that Sorpa enjoyed a dominant position on the market for waste acceptance in the metropolitan area of Reykjavík, where its market share amounted to approximately 70% and it faced competition from only one operator, Gámaþjónustan hf. Moreover, Sorpa enjoyed a dominant position on the market for waste disposal in the same geographic area, where it was the sole operator. The Court held that an entity of public law constitutes an undertaking within the meaning of Article 54 EEA when it does not act in the exercise of official authority but engages in an economic activity, which consists in offering goods or services on a market. In order to determine whether the provision of waste management services by a municipality or a municipal cooperative agency such as Sorpa is an economic activity, account must be taken of the existence of competition with private entities and the level of the compensation received. In that regard, the Court noted that under the Waste Disposal Act, licences for the operation of waste <b>disposal</b> <b>centres</b> and landfill sites may be granted to private entities, and one licence was granted to Gámaþjónustan, a private entity. The fact that Sorpa decided to charge a fee for the provision of waste acceptance services, although it was not obliged to do so, is a further indication of the economic nature of its activity.|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} the first to {{investigate}} the mineral composition of the atmospheric particulate matter deposited at Rio Tinto, Spain, an historical mining district of world-class importance, with emphasis on metal-bearing particles and their environmental implications. The dustfall is composed of quartz, feldspars, phyllosilicates (mica, chlorite and/or kaolinite) and a variety of accessory heavy minerals, the most common being primary sulfides (pyrite, chalcopyrite with minor galena, sphalerite and bornite) and their oxidation products (notably goethite, hematite and jarosite). This mineral assemblage suggests a local source of wind-blown dust and it is consistent with the large deposition levels of sulfide-related elements (As, Bi, Cd, Cu, Pb, Sb and Zn) registered at the sampling site adjacent to the mine waste dumps. However, the generation of potentially harmful dust particles is not restricted to mine wastes. Anthropogenic metallic compounds arising from a nearby hazardous waste <b>disposal</b> <b>centre</b> can make a relevant additional contribution to the metal deposition, particularly for Fe, Ni, Cr and Mn. Atmospheric fallout is a major mechanism for metal input to soils and plants around or near the mining area.

40|$|Vanadium pentoxide (V 2 O 5) is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used oxidation catalyst in the production of sulfuric acid. It has a service life of 5 - 10 years and is disposed after its deterioration. Spent catalyst is listed as a scheduled waste under Malaysian Environmental Quality Act (EQA), 1974 and it must be sent to Kualiti Alam Sdn. Bhd. (KA), the only integrated hazardous waste treatment and <b>disposal</b> <b>centre</b> in peninsular Malaysia. Since 2005, an amended regulation allows the spent catalyst to be treated by the waste generator, provided a positive scientific outcome is presented. This paper discusses a scientific study of the spent catalyst treatment using the cement-based solidification/stabilization (S/S) technique, whereby the treatment effectiveness was investigated through two leaching tests, TCLP and ANS 16. 1 (modified). The spent catalyst is a dry, greenish-yellow porous cylindrical solid, which contains mainly silica (56 - 75 %). Its metal contents are K (839 mg/l), V (356 mg/l), Na (99 mg /l), Al (44 mg/l), Ca (23 mg/l), Fe (13 mg/l), Mg (13 mg/l) and Ph (0. 7 mg/l). Cement-based S/S was able to control the leaching of the Fe and Pb that exceeded Malaysian EQA wastewater standard limit before the treatment. In addition, leachability index (Li) confirmed that the waste constituents were successfully encapsulated in the solidified matrix. The compressibility of the treated samples was measured using ASTM unconfined compressive strength and proved that {{they should be able to}} sustain the load placed on them in a landfill. Tiles and bricks made from the S/S process could potentially be used as construction materials...|$|E
40|$|The {{state and}} {{co-operation}} {{are of a}} very complex character and relations between them based on different principles occur in various spheres. In each sphere, however, of relations {{between the state and}} co-operation movement in socialism some persistent or relatively persistent principles of action (rules of play) should be operative. The aim of the article is development and determination of some of these principles. As the most important principles of action in relations between the socialist state as. a political institution and co-operation as a definite social movement and a form of economy following ones can be called: acceptance of relative stability of co-operative movement in socialism, assertion of free and open character of co-operative organizations, protection of democracy in management and controlling activities of co-operative units and in share of obtained profits. A principle of relative stability of co-perative forms in socialism, which is discussed deeply in the article, means that co-operation can exist and be developed in a given country in a relatively long period of time. Such principles as: incorporation of different elements of co-operation and particular co-operatives into the planned economy system, guaranty of similar conditions of functioning and development of co-operative and state economies when differences between them taken into account, etc., are also of great importance in relations between the state, i. e. a <b>disposal</b> <b>centre</b> in the planned economy system, and. particular elements of co-operation. Equality, economic character of connections and consideration of differences in the scale of economic enterprises belong to the most important principles in relations between the state and co-operative economies and between the state and co-operative units. Basing on the analysis of these principles the author occupies himself with a problem of competition between state and co-operative enterprises in socialism. He points out the necessity of a more differentiated approach in this sphere. It is indicated in the article that approval of some principles in relations between the state and co-operation in socialism is faced with some difficulties, especially in practice. It makes it difficult for co-operation to develop as well as social and economic effectiveness of co-operative forms to increase in socialism.

40|$|Abstract: Developing {{successful}} {{knowledge management}} (KM) processes is extremely difficult. In general, {{a large number}} of all KM projects end unsuccessfully. The aim {{of this paper is to}} summarize and study the attempts to take advantage of Lessons Learned in the Swedish Armed Forces (SwAF), focusing on international missions. Relevant reports, articles and literature have been studied. With the purpose of understanding the reasons for failure and the failure factors in SwAF’s attempts at KM, Chua and Lam’s model for unsuccessful KM implementation has been applied to four cases from the organization. The results show that SwAF are aware of the importance of knowledge and have attempted to implement KM on several occasions. In most cases, however, the KM projects do not achieve widespread use and eventually end unsuccessfully. Furthermore, many of the KM tools that have been developed are no longer in use.

40|$|Thesis (M. B. A.) [...] North-West University, Vaal Triangle Campus, 2009. The City of Johannesburg {{is facing}} the {{simultaneous}} challenges of an increased generation of solid waste in the City, unemployment and the running out of land to dispose the waste. Of the solid waste that is generated, 50 % is recyclable while only 10 % is recycled (SOER, 2003 : 69). Solid waste recycling is mainly performed through private sector initiatives in the City of Johannesburg. Consequently, there is no proper coordination with government initiatives. In order for South Africa to increase and sustain economic growth that would decrease unemployment, {{there should be a}} culture of entrepreneurship (Mass, G & Herrington M, 2006 : 7). Solid waste buy-back centres assist in addressing the challenges of dealing with the increased generation of solid waste and the scarcity of land for <b>disposal.</b> These <b>centres</b> also reduce the challenges of unemployment through promoting entrepreneurs to operate solid waste recycling businesses. Developed economies have managed to increase the rate of solid waste recycling to 60 %. The problems associated with solid waste have been reduced by promoting recycling through a combination of legislation and setting-up of agencies to deal with solid waste recycling. South Africa has legislation and stated programmes to deal with solid waste recycling. Nevertheless, there has been complexity with implementing recycling. This {{is the result of a}} lack of co-ordination between the role-players involved in the value chain of solid waste recycling. In order for the City of Johannesburg to increase the recycling of solid waste from 10 % to optimal rates of between 50 % and 60 %, there should be co-ordination of programmes amongst all the role players. In addition, there should also be skills provision to existing and potential entrepreneurs operating the solid waste buy-back centres. All spheres of government should promote solid waste recycling business to potential entrepreneurs and the public in order to recycle 40 % of the recyclable solid waste that is not being recycled. The establishment of a solid waste buy-back centre in the City of Johannesburg is economically viable with some buy-back centre realising a net-profit of least R 5 000 and some more than R 30 000 per month. In order for the solid waste buy-back centre to realise a net-profit of more than R 30 000 per month, there must be more than 40 tons of recyclable solid waste received by the buy-back centre per month. This study has indicated that solid waste buy-back centres rely on the economies of scale. This means that the more recyclable solid waste is received and sold by the solid waste buy-back centres, the more profitable it becomes. Master...|$|R
