At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 63, indicating [...] "generally favourable reviews", based on 8 reviews. The Guardian gave the album a mostly positive review, stating: [...] "This might {{be far from}} a perfect album, but it's certainly {{nothing to be ashamed}} of". Rolling Stone gave a mostly positive review as well saying [...] "Fist-pumpy EDM cheese this most certainly is not. Instead, W:/2016ALBUM/ works equally in a <b>field,</b> <b>car</b> or headphones, the latest catalog entry from an artist who continues to delight in bucking expectations". Clash Magazine also gave a positive review saying [...] "An album free from the shackles of a major label and its consequential rampant commercialism was always going to produce something that didn't immediately pander to its keg fuelled audience. The surprise is just how well deadmau5 pulls it off. If he actually makes a record he likes - it could be ground-breaking".|$|E

40|$|Key Words: AZ 31 B alloy; {{formability}} of stamping; forming limit Abstract: In this paper, {{the basic}} formability of stamping of magnesium-alloy AZ 31 B sheet {{has been studied}} through experiments. The stamping formability of magnesium-alloy AZ 31 B sheet, such as the conical cup value, bending formability, deep drawing formability, formability of hole expanding, forming limit has been studied by simulating processing experiments. The formability of stamping supplies the basic reference data for the stamping processing. It is {{also found that the}} formability of stamping of magnesium-alloy AZ 31 B sheets is poor at room temperature and is excellent at intermediate and high temperatures. Due to its many advantages, such as low density, high specific strength and specific stiffness, strong capacity of antivibration and damp, excellent electromagnetic shielding, easy formation by machining and recovery and so on, magnesium alloy is promising to be widely used as large covering parts in aviation and space flight <b>field,</b> <b>car,</b> 3 C products and so on.

40|$|Ongoing {{expansion}} of digital images requires new methods for sorting, browsing, and sear- ching through huge image databases. This is a domain of Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) systems, which are database search engines for images. A user typically submit a query image or series {{of images and}} the CBIR system tries to find and to retrieve the most similar images from the database. Optimally, the retrieved images should not be sensitive to circumstances during their acquisition. Unfortunately, the appearance of natural objects and materials is highly illumination and viewpoint dependent. This work focuses on representation and retrieval of homogeneous images, called textu- res, under the circumstances with variable illumination and texture rotation. We propose a novel illumination invariant textural features based on Markovian modelling of spatial tex- ture relations. The texture is modelled by Causal Autoregressive Random <b>field</b> (<b>CAR)</b> or Gaussian Markov Random Field (GMRF) models, which allow a very efficient estimation of its parameters, without the demanding Monte Carlo minimisation. Subsequently, the estimated model parameters are transformed into the new illumination invariants, which represent the texture. We derived that our textural representation is invariant to changes of illumination intensity and [...] ...|$|E
