Without completeness, individual decision making {{depends on a}} set of beliefs, and an action is preferred to another if and only if it has larger expected utility for all beliefs in this set. We consider two natural notions of incentive compatibility in this setting: maximal incentive compatibility requires that no strategy has larger expected utility than truth-telling for all beliefs, while optimal incentive compatibility requires that truth-telling has larger expected utility than all other strategies for all beliefs. In a model with a continuum of types, we show that optimal incentive compatibility is equivalent to ex-post incentive compatibility under fairly general conditions on beliefs.

40|$|Multiple {{seam mining}} {{interactions}} caused by <b>full</b> <b>extraction</b> mining, whether due to undermining or overmining, frequently involve tensile {{failure of the}} affected mine roof. The adverse ground control conditions may prevent mining for both safety and economic reasons. Prior researchers have identified the geometric, geologic and mining factors controlling multiple seam mining interactions. This numerical study examines the mechanics of these interactions using a modeling procedure that 1) incorporates the essential constitutive behavior of the rock such as strain-softening of the intact rock and shear and tensile failure along bedding planes and 2) captures the geologic variability of the rock especially the layering of weak and strong rocks and weak bedding planes. Specifically, the numerical study considered the effect of vertical stress, interburden thickness, and the immediate roof quality of the affected seam in both undermining and overmining situations. The models show that for overburden-to-interburden thickness (OB/IB) ratios of less than 5, interactions do not occur, and that for OB/IB more than 50, extreme interaction is a certainty. In between, {{the possibility of an}} interaction was found to depend on gob width-to-interburden thickness ratio, site specific geology and horizontal stress to rock strength ratio in addition to the OB/IB ratio. The models also showed that horizontal stress was profoundly altered well above or below a <b>full</b> <b>extraction</b> area and that these changes are likely to influence {{the success or failure of}} multiple seam mining. The role of horizontal stress in multiple seam mining interactions has received little attention in prior investigations.
