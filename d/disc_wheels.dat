25|$|Fowler got {{round the}} above problem {{by using a}} {{weighted}} cart with a pulley mounted beneath the frame. The cart had <b>disc</b> <b>wheels</b> that dug into the ground so that the cart acted as an anchor for the pulley. Two carts would be placed {{at opposite ends of}} the furrow so as to pull the plough in either direction, and after completing a furrow, the carts would be winched to the position for the next furrow.|$|E
25|$|The {{top of the}} {{radiator}} was lowered 2 inches from the One-o-Four's. The styling of the Majestic is similar to, but wider and with smoother lines than the short lived Regency One-O-Four model it replaced. Interior width was increased by approximately 4 inches by extending the sides {{to the edge of}} the car. The handsome body is massive with a conventional high waistline —the doors later seemed to be high with narrow windows— and a rounded rear window. There are two standard-sized headlamps at the front extremities with Daimler's usual pair of fog lamps or driving lights just above low-set bumpers. There are plain <b>disc</b> <b>wheels.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Type 1 47mm AT gun was a {{relative}} modern design {{compared to other}} Japanese Second World war designs, being relatively light and easy to handle. As with many Japanese designs, it had a very low profile and {{was intended to be}} operated from a kneeling or prone position. The gun had a gun shield to protect the gunner. The carriage appears to have adopted a number of design features from the Soviet ZIK 45 mm anti-tank gun, a number of examples of which were captured by the Japanese during the Battle of Khalkhin Gol (Nomonhan) in 1939. It used a semi-automatic breech block with a horizontal sliding wedge. When the gun was fired the spent shell casing was automatically ejected, and upon loading a fresh shell, the breech block closed automatically. A hydrospring recoil mechanism was housed under the barrel. The weapon had a split trail which opened to an angle of 60 degrees for firing to improve stability. Transport was by towing behind a truck or horse, via two steel <b>disc</b> <b>wheels</b> fitted with sponge rubber filled tires.|$|E
50|$|A <b>disc</b> <b>wheel</b> style (bypass) is {{very similar}} in design to the drum style {{humidifier}}s; this type of furnace humidifier replaces the foam drumming {{with a number of}} plastic discs with small grooves on both sides. This allows for a very large evaporative surface area, without requiring a great deal of space. Unlike the drum style humidifiers, the <b>disc</b> <b>wheel</b> does not need regular replacement.|$|R

25|$|In the 1989 Tour de France, 1988 winner Pedro Delgado {{was the big}} favourite, with Fignon, Stephen Roche, and Erik Breukink listed {{together}} as top contenders. After Delgado inexplicably was nearly three minutes late {{for the start of}} the prologue time trial, the race was open to all contenders, and ended up a battle between Greg LeMond and Fignon. LeMond won a minute in the time trial in stage five, using aerobars which enabled a new and more aerodynamic riding position (also known as tri-bars as they had previously only been used in triathlons), a new type of teardrop-shaped aerodynamic helmet in the time trials and a rear disc wheel, Fignon used normal road handlebars and a bicycle with both front and rear <b>disc</b> <b>wheels,</b> which left him more affected by cross winds. LeMond led the general classification after that stage by 5 seconds. In the tenth stage, Fignon beat LeMond by 12 seconds, and became the new leader, 7 seconds ahead of LeMond. In the time trial of stage 15, LeMond again won time on Fignon, and took back the leading position. Fignon came back by dropping LeMond on Alpe d'Huez, taking back the lead, and after he won alone at Villard-de-Lans the next day, the margin was 50 seconds.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} A1s were {{coupled to}} a traditional Great Northern type of tender with coal rails of a design that {{can be traced back}} to Stirling days. The A1-variant was a much-enlarged eight-wheel version carrying [...] of coal and [...] of water. In 1928, a new special type of tender body was built for the new non-stop Flying Scotsman train. This tender had a corridor connection and an access tunnel through the water tank. It was of a more modern design with high side sheets curved in at the top and had a coal capacity of [...] In order to be able to pack an extra ton of coal, a single coal rail was provided on this particular series, but was later deemed unnecessary. Ten of these corridor tenders were built, and a non-corridor version of similar design followed with 8-ton coal capacity and no coal rail. Further series of both types had <b>disc</b> <b>wheels</b> instead of the previous spoked variety.|$|E
500|$|Fignon {{had won the}} Tour twice before, in 1983 and 1984, and was a {{very capable}} time trialist. It seemed {{improbable}} that LeMond could take 50 seconds off Fignon over the short course. This would require LeMond to gain two seconds per kilometer {{against one of the}} fastest chrono-specialists in the world. LeMond had done wind tunnel testing in the off season and perfected his riding position. He rode the time trial with a [...] rear disc wheel, a cut-down Giro aero helmet and the same Scott clip-on aero bars which had helped him to the Stage 5 time trial win. Holding his time trialing position LeMond was able to generate less aerodynamic drag than Fignon, who used a pair of <b>disc</b> <b>wheels</b> but chose to go helmetless and did not use the aero bars that are now commonplace in time trials. Instructing his support car not to give him his split times, LeMond rode flat-out and finished at a record pace to beat Fignon by 8 seconds and claim his second Tour de France victory. As LeMond embraced his wife and rejoiced on the Champs-Élysées, Fignon collapsed onto the tarmac, then sat in shock and wept.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Nut {{embedded}} <b>disc</b> grinding <b>wheels,</b> {{also known}} as disc grinding or F-Type wheels, are required for many production jobs. Nut pull-out is a common problem encountered in <b>disc</b> grinding <b>wheels.</b> The present work proposes a simple fixture, using which {{the integrity of the}} nut in the grinding wheel can be assessed. This method can be adopted by any grinding wheel manufacturer for a realistic estimate of nut pull out strength in double <b>disc</b> grinding <b>wheels...</b>|$|R
5000|$|Steam {{locomotives}} use spoked {{driving wheels}} of cast steel. A few makers have favoured variants of this, seeking a more weight-efficient design by using {{various forms of}} hollow or girder spoke, rather than solid oval-section spokes. One {{of the most successful}} of these designs was the Bulleid Firth Brown (or BFB) wheel, often incorrectly confused with the Boxpok wheel. This had some features of the wobbly web, being developed from a flat <b>disc</b> <b>wheel</b> with short, wide [...] "spokes" [...] formed in it by displacing teardrop-shaped sections of the disc into another plane. Except for a few small lightening holes, this <b>disc</b> <b>wheel</b> is consistently one wall thickness thick, all around the disc.|$|R
50|$|In 1982, Emery was {{the first}} rider from the USA to ride a <b>disc</b> <b>wheel,</b> which was made for the USA team by {{aerodynamics}} expert Chester Kyle. In 1987, Emery {{became involved in the}} development of a new style of aerodynamic handlebars.|$|R
2500|$|The record {{attempt was}} successful. In {{front of an}} {{audience}} of 1600 people, Voigt rode 51.110 kilometers during the course of an hour, beating the previous record by 1.410 kilometers. He reached the previous mark on the 199th lap of the velodrome, with 1:28 remaining. Voigt used {{a modified version of the}} Trek Speed Concept frame, with dual <b>disc</b> <b>wheels</b> and standard aero bars. He also used a front gearing of 54 teeth and a rear gearing of 14 teeth. Voigt stood up on his machine a couple of times during the event. He was faster at the end of the attempt, as he covered some laps (250 meters) in under 17 seconds. Voigt is the oldest rider to ever beat the record [...] and his average power output was 412 watts. He is also the first German to hold the record. The UCI president, Brian Cookson, believed that this event could be the start of a cascade of attempts by other riders who perform well in time trials.|$|E
50|$|Solid <b>disc</b> <b>wheels</b> {{are used}} as well, though in outdoor {{settings}} these are generally not used on the front wheel because they are difficult to handle in crosswinds. <b>Disc</b> <b>wheels</b> provide a significant aerodynamic advantage when mounted on the rear wheel improving laminar flow over the rear half of the bike. Recent developments in technology {{have given rise to}} <b>disc</b> <b>wheels</b> with a dimpled surface like a golf ball, also in the name of aerodynamics. <b>Disc</b> <b>wheels</b> are not permitted at the Ironman World Championships in Kona Hawaii, as large crosswinds are not uncommon and present an unsafe situation to athletes.|$|E

50|$|<b>Disc</b> <b>wheels</b> are {{designed}} to minimize aerodynamic drag. A full disc is usually heavier than traditional spoke wheels, and {{can be difficult to}} handle when ridden with a cross wind. For this reason, international cycling organizations often ban <b>disc</b> <b>wheels</b> or limit their use to the rear wheel of a bicycle. However, international triathlon federations were (and are still) less restrictive and is what led to the wheels' initial usage growth in popularity in the 1980s.|$|E
50|$|The Bulleid Firth Brown wheel was a {{locomotive}} wheel {{developed for the}} Southern Railway in the late 1930s. It was a <b>disc</b> <b>wheel,</b> {{in contrast to the}} usual spoked wheels in general use on British railways. The wheel was designed by Oliver Bulleid and developed by the steel company Firth Brown of Sheffield.|$|R
50|$|Key {{features}} of the wobbly web wheel are that they are designed as a modification of the <b>disc</b> <b>wheel</b> with additional shaping, rather than a spoked wheel with merged spokes. They can be manufactured by either pressing from sheet steel, or by casting in light alloys. To avoid stress risers, the webs are formed into smooth curves, rather than sharply defined spokes.|$|R

50|$|A {{drawback}} {{to the use}} of a <b>disc</b> <b>wheel,</b> particularly for front wheels, is the lack of airflow through the wheels, which is important for cooling the brake <b>discs.</b> The rear <b>wheels</b> of single-seat racing cars are driven by driveshafts from the transaxle and the brakes are usually mounted inboard in any case, away from the wheels. Later Lotus designs, from the 26 onwards, used spoked wheels, although this was more about the shrinking diameter of racing tyres, especially fronts, rather than brake cooling. With an open-wheel racing car, any shrouding from the wheels was never a serious limitation.|$|R

50|$|A <b>disc</b> <b>wheel</b> {{may simply}} be a fairing that clips onto a traditional, spoke wheel, {{addressing}} the drag that the spokes generate by covering them; or the disc can be integral to the wheel with no spokes inside.
