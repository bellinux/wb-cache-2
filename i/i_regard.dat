5|$|If {{my letter}} makes no appeal to your heart, on the {{eleventh}} day {{of this month}} I shall proceed with such co-workers of the Ashram as I can take, to disregard {{the provisions of the}} Salt Laws. <b>I</b> <b>regard</b> this tax to be the most iniquitous of all from the poor man's standpoint. As the sovereignty and self-rule movement is essentially for the poorest in the land, the beginning will be made with this evil.|$|E

25|$|<b>I</b> <b>regard</b> the applicant's {{undertaking}} as {{a marvel}} of enterprise, energy and pluck… he is allowed - if {{my view of}} the Act is correct - to make any profits that he can {{and they are not}} subject to investigation. But when he chooses, {{in the course of his}} economies, to economise at the expense of human life, when his economy involves the withholding from his employees of reasonable remuneration, or reasonable conditions of human existence, then, as I understand the Act, Parliament insists on the payment of the Excise duty.|$|E
25|$|Above all I want no long {{faces and}} no show of grief at the burying ground. Kindly observe the final {{wishes of the}} {{undersigned}} and avoid reading the so-called Christian burial service which, {{in view of the}} language employed in it, <b>I</b> <b>regard</b> {{as one of the most}} cruel and paganish things inherited by our forebears from our remote pagan ancestors. In deference to the faith of our dear mother who was through her lifetime a loyal though never bigoted communicant of that congregation, perhaps the current pastor of the First Presbyterian Church would consent to read the Twenty-third Psalm, which was her favorite passage in the Scriptures and is mine since it contains no charnel words, no morbid mouthings about corruption and decay and, being mercifully without creed or dogma, carries no threat of eternal hell-fire for those parties we do not like, no direct promise of a heaven which, if one may judge by the people who are surest of going there, must be a powerfully dull place, populated to a considerable and uncomfortable degree by prigs, time-servers and unpleasantly aggressive individuals. Hell may have a worse climate but undoubtedly the company is sprightlier. The Catholics, with their genius for stage-management, handle this detail better. The officiating clergyman speaks in Latin and the parishioners, being unacquainted with that language are impressed by the majesty of the rolling, sonorous periods without being shocked by tressing allusions and harrowing references.|$|E
500|$|My disgust at this {{proposition}} was, I think, chiefly due to Victor Hugo's latter novels, which <b>I</b> <b>regard</b> as pretentious and untrue to nature. To this perhaps was added some feeling of indignation that I {{should be asked}} {{to give way to}} a Frenchman. The Frenchman had broken his engagement. He had failed to have his work finished by the stipulated time. From week to week and from month to month he had put off the fulfilment of his duty. And because of these laches on his part,— on the part of this sententious French Radical,— I was to be thrown over! ...|$|E

500|$|As Germany {{defeated}} [...] France in 1940, President Roosevelt proposed giving Britain munitions {{to fight}} back. [...] Senator Wheeler declared [...] "the lend-lease-give {{program is the}} New Deal's triple-A foreign policy; it will plow under every fourth American boy." [...] Roosevelt shot back, by denouncing “those who talk about plowing under every fourth American child, which <b>I</b> <b>regard</b> as the most untruthful, as the most dastardly, unpatriotic thing that has ever been said." [...] To stop the movement toward war Senator Wheeler and the Chicago Tribune published {{the full text of}} the Army's top secret war plan Rainbow 5 {{a few days before the}} attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941.|$|E
500|$|Thompson {{has said}} of her {{religious}} views: [...] "I'm an atheist ... <b>I</b> <b>regard</b> religion with fear and suspicion. It's not {{enough to say that}} I don't believe in God. I actually regard the system as distressing: I am offended by some of the things said in the Bible and the Qur'an and I refute them." [...] She is politically liberal and a supporter of the Labour Party; she told the BBC Andrew Marr Show in 2010 that she {{had been a member of}} the party [...] "all my life." [...] Thompson endorsed Jeremy Corbyn's campaign in both the 2015 and 2016 Labour Party leadership elections. She has also expressed support for the Women's Equality Party.|$|E
500|$|Reich {{was much}} {{encouraged}} by the meeting and hoped he would be invited to join Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study. During their next meeting, he gave Einstein a small accumulator, {{and over the next}} 10 days Einstein performed experiments with it in his basement, which involved taking the temperature above, inside and near the device, and stripping it down to its Faraday cage to compare temperatures. He observed an increase of temperature, which Reich argued was caused by orgone. One of Einstein's assistants pointed out that the temperature was lower on the floor than on the ceiling. Einstein concluded that the effect was simply due to the temperature gradient inside the room. [...] "Through these experiments <b>I</b> <b>regard</b> the matter as completely solved," [...] he wrote to Reich on 7 February 1941.|$|E

500|$|To {{create the}} lyrics, Eno would later play these backing tracks singing {{nonsense}} syllables to himself, then take them and form them into actual words, phrases and meaning. This lyric-writing method {{was used for}} all his more vocal-based recordings of the 1970s. The lyrics on Here Come the Warm Jets are macabre with an underlying sense of humour. They are mostly free-associative and have no particular meaning. Exceptions include [...] "The Paw Paw Negro Blowtorch", about the historical A.W. Underwood of Paw Paw, Michigan with the purported ability to set items ablaze with his breath; according to Eno, the song [...] "celebrates {{the possibility of a}} love affair with the man." [...] Eno has attempted to dissuade fans from reading too much into his words; he claims that the song [...] "Needles in the Camel's Eye" [...] was [...] "written in less time than it takes to sing... <b>I</b> <b>regard</b> [...] as an instrumental with singing on it".|$|E
500|$|Howard {{said that}} the clause [...] "is simply declaratory of what <b>I</b> <b>regard</b> as {{the law of the}} land already, that every person born within the limits of the United States, and subject to their jurisdiction, is by virtue of natural law and {{national}} law a citizen of the United States." [...] He added that citizenship [...] "will not, of course, include persons born in the United States who are foreigners, aliens, who belong to the families of ambassadors or foreign ministers accredited to the Government of the United States, but will include every other class of persons" [...] —a comment which would later raise questions as to whether Congress had originally intended that U.S.-born children of foreign parents were to be included as citizens. [...] Responding to concerns expressed by Edgar Cowan of Pennsylvania that liberalizing the right to citizenship might result in certain states being taken over by large populations of undesirable foreign immigrants, [...] John Conness of California predicted that the Chinese population in California would likely remain very small, in large part because Chinese immigrants almost always eventually returned to China, and also because very few Chinese women left their homeland to come to the United States.|$|E
500|$|The book {{reveals that}} members of the {{organisation}} had attempted to donate funds to the 2007 re-election campaign of Prime Minister of Australia John Howard in a way in which information about the financing would not have been available to the general public. Individuals describing themselves as a [...] "private group" [...] had met with a senior figure within the Liberal Party of Australia in a hotel in Sydney, and offered him a significant amount of money by way of an anonymous donation. The book's source recounted the events: [...] "They said 'We are a private group'. I asked them if they voted. It was a testing question. They said they didn't. It was a very short discussion." [...] The organisation's members are instructed that government is controlled by God, and they are told not to vote in elections. [...] "We're in the business of ideas and so are the Exclusive Brethren. <b>I</b> <b>regard</b> many of the party's views and those of the Exclusive Brethren as inconsistent. What the [...] Party stands for should not be confused {{in the mind of the}} electorate by the acceptance of donations from fringe groups. In my view, if you accept this money, you're arguably accepting some of their opinions," [...] said the book's source, explaining that he had turned down the offer of funds from the organisation.|$|E

500|$|By 1910 the Diary was {{beginning}} to achieve a reputation in London's literary and political circles. In his essay [...] "On People in Books", published earlier that year, the writer and humourist Hilaire Belloc hailed the Diary as [...] "one of the half-dozen immortal achievements of our time... a glory for us all". Among others who recorded their appreciation of the work were Lord Rosebery, {{the former prime minister}} who told Arrowsmiths that he thought he had [...] "purchased and given away more copies than any living man... <b>I</b> <b>regard</b> any bedroom I occupy as unfurnished without a copy of it". Another essayist-cum-politician who added his tribute was Augustine Birrell, who in 1910 occupied the cabinet post of Chief Secretary for Ireland. Birrell wrote that he ranked Charles Pooter alongside Don Quixote as a comic literary figure, and added a note of personal pride that one of the characters in the book—"an illiterate charwoman, it is true"—carried his name. Arrowsmiths printed these appreciations as prefaces in the 1910 and subsequent issues. The 1910 edition [...] proved immediately popular with the reading public, and was followed by numerous reprintings. In its review of this edition The Bookman s critic wrote of Charles Pooter: [...] "You laugh at him—at his small absurdities, his droll mishaps, his well-meaning fussiness; but he wins upon you and obtains your affection, and even your admiration, he is so transparently honest, so delightfully and ridiculously human".|$|E
