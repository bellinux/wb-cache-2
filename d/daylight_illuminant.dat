We found this idea interesting but not thoroughly tested. In particular, tests on real images were limited to scenes made up artificially from hyperspectral data, 4 spectral power distributions of various <b>daylight</b> <b>illuminants,</b> and the human cone sensitivity functions. The Ruderman database 4 of hyperspectral images is also quite peculiar because it consists of {{a small number of}} images of mostly foliage.

We illustrate these principles using the synthetic example of estimating blackbody radiator spectral power distributions. Then, we apply the principles to typical <b>daylight</b> <b>illuminants</b> that we measured over the course of twenty days in Stanford, California.

40|$|In {{everyday}} experience, perceived {{colors of}} objects remain approximately constant under changes in illumination. This constancy is helpful for identifying objects across viewing conditions. Studies on color constancy often employ monitor simulations of illumination and reflectance changes. Real scenes, however, have features {{that might be}} important for color constancy but that are in general not captured by monitor displays. Here, we investigate categorical color constancy employing real surfaces and real illuminants in a rich viewing context. Observers sorted 450 Munsell samples into the 11 basic color categories under a daylight and four filtered daylight illuminants. We additionally manipulated illuminant cues from the local surround. Color constancy as quantified both with a classification consistency index and a standard color constancy index was high in both cue conditions. Observers generally classified colors with the same precision across different illuminants as across repetitions for the <b>daylight</b> <b>illuminant.</b> Moreover, the pattern of classification consistency in terms of stimulus hue, value, and chroma was similar when comparing different observers for the <b>daylight</b> <b>illuminant</b> and when comparing individual observers across different illuminants.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} new camera {{calibration}} method aimed at finding a straight-line locus, in a special colour feature space, that is traversed by daylights and as well also approximately followed by specular points. The aim of the calibration is to enable recovering the colour of the illuminant in a scene, using the calibrated camera. First we prove theoretically that any candidate specular points, for an image that is generated by a specific camera and taken under a daylight, must lie on a straight line in log-chromaticity space, for a chromaticity that is generated using a geometric-mean denominator. Use is made of the assumptions that <b>daylight</b> <b>illuminants</b> can be approximated using Planckians and that camera sensors are narrowband or can be made so by spectral sharpening. Then we show how a particular camera can be calibrated so as to discover this locus. As applications we use this curve for illuminant detection, and also for re-lighting of images to show they would appear under lighting having a different colour temperature.

40|$|Naïve {{observers}} viewed {{a sequence}} of colored “Mondrian ” patterns, simulated on a color monitor. Each pattern was presented twice in succession, first under one <b>daylight</b> <b>illuminant</b> of color temperature either 16000 K or 4000 K, and then under the other, to test for color constancy. Observers compared the central square of the pattern across illuminants, either rating it for sameness of material appearance, or for sameness of hue and saturation, or judging an objective property, that is, whether its change of color originated from a change in material or only in illumination. Average color-constancy indices were high for materialappearance ratings and binary judgments of origin, and low for hue-saturation ratings. Individuals ’ performance varied, but judgments of material and of hue and saturation remained demarcated. Observers seem able to separate phenomenal percepts from their ontological projections of mental appearance onto physical phenomena: thus, even when a chromatic change alters perceived hue and saturation, observers can reliably infer the cause, the constancy of the underlying surface spectral reflectance. 2 Reeves et al.

40|$|The {{intrinsic}} circadian clock requires photoentrainment to synchronize the 24 -hour solar day. Therefore, light stimulation is {{an important}} component of chronobiological research. Currently, the chronobiological research field overwhelmingly uses photopic illuminance that is based on the luminous efficiency function, V(λ), to quantify light levels. However, recent discovery of intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs), which are activated by self-containing melanopsin photopigment and also by inputs from rods and cones, makes light specification using a one-dimensional unit inadequate. Since the current understanding of how different photoreceptor inputs contribute to the circadian system through ipRGCs is limited, it is recommended to specify light in terms of the excitations of five photoreceptors (S-, M-, L-cones, rods and ipRGCs). In the current study, we assessed whether the spectral outputs from a commercially available spectral watch (i. e., Actiwatch Spectrum) could be used to estimate photoreceptor excitations. Based on the color sensor spectral sensitivity functions from a previously published work, as well as from our measurements, we computed spectral outputs in the long-wavelength range (R), middle-wavelength range (G), short-wavelength range (B) and broadband range (W) under 52 CIE <b>illuminants</b> (25 <b>daylight</b> <b>illuminants,</b> 27 fluorescent lights). We also computed the photoreceptor excitations for each illuminant using human spectral sensitivity functions. Linear regression analyses indicated that the Actiwatch spectral outputs could predict photoreceptor excitations reliably, under the assumption of linear responses of the Actiwatch color sensors. In addition, R, G, B outputs could classify illuminant types (fluorescent vs. <b>daylight</b> <b>illuminants)</b> satisfactorily. However, the assessment of actual Actiwatch recording under several testing light sources showed that the spectral outputs were subject to great nonlinearity, leading to less accurate estimation of photoreceptor excitations. Based on our analyses, we recommend that each spectral watch should be calibrated to measure spectral sensitivity functions and linearization characteristics for each sensor to have an accurate estimation of photoreceptor excitations. The method we provided to estimate photoreceptor excitations from the outputs of spectral watches could be used for chronobiological studies that can tolerate an error in the range of 0. 2 - 0. 5 log units. Our method can be easily expanded to incorporate linearization functions to have more accurate estimations. Fil: Cao, Dingcai. University Of Illinois; Estados UnidosFil: Barrionuevo, Pablo Alejandro.

40|$|A {{theory about}} how {{changes in the}} {{illuminant}} affect the color appearance of objects must specify how the visual system's adjustments to illuminant changes vary with the surface collection in a scene. I report an experiment designed to investigate this issue. The stimuli were CRT simulations of flat matte surfaces rendered under diffuse illumination. For all combinations of 7 <b>daylight</b> <b>illuminants</b> and 12 collections of surface reflectances the subject's achromatic locus was measured on an isoluminant plane in color space. For any surface collection {{the changes in the}} achromatic locus could be well approximated by a linear transformation of the illuminant changes. These linear transformations showed relatively small variation with the surface collection. To first approximation, these results suggest that the effect of changes in the illuminant on color appearance can be described linearly and that it can be separated from the surface collection. There was an effect of the surface collection on the achromatic locus. The data rejected the idea that a surface collection's mean reflectance function might capture this effect, ruling out models of color appearance that are based on this kind of averag-ing assumption. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The colors {{present in}} {{an image of}} a scene provide {{information}} about its constituent elements. But the amount of information depends on the imaging conditions and on how information is calculated. This work had two aims. The first was to derive explicitly estimators of the information available and the information retrieved from the color values at each point in images of a scene under different illuminations. The second was to apply these estimators to simulations of images obtained with five sets of sensors used in digital cameras and with the cone photoreceptors of the human eye. Estimates were obtained for 50 hyper spectral images of natural scenes under <b>daylight</b> <b>illuminants</b> with correlated color temperatures 4, 000, 6, 500, and 25, 000 K. Depending on the sensor set, the mean estimated information available across images with the largest illumination difference varied from 15. 5 to 18. 0 bits and the mean estimated information retrieved after optimal linear processing varied from 13. 2 to 15. 5 bits (each about 85 percent of the corresponding information available). With the best sensor set, 390 percent more points could be identified per scene than with the worst. Capturing scene information from image colors depends crucially on the choice of camera sensors...|$|R
40|$|Saturation here {{refers to}} {{electronic}} saturation {{of the camera}} sensors which produces clipped colors, and not the purity of color as in the hue-saturation and value scale. Saturated images are routinely discarded in image analysis yet there are situations when they cannot be avoided. This paper proposes two strategies to recover color information in facial images taken under non-ideal conditions to make them useful for further processing. The first assumes that the skin is matte {{and that there are}} parts of the image which are not clipped. Ratios between R,G and B values of unclipped pixels belonging to the same parts of the image may then be used to compute for lost channel values. The second approach uses color eigenfaces computed from our physics-based face database obtained under different illuminants and camera calibration conditions. Skin color is recovered by transforming the first few eigenface coefficients towards ideal condition values. Excellent color recovery for clipped images is achieved when these two techniques are combined and used on face images captured under <b>daylight</b> <b>illuminant</b> with a camera white balanced for incandescent light...|$|E
40|$|Daylight {{simulators}} (i. e., D 50, D 55, D 65, and D 75 simulators) play {{an important}} role for industrial applications, such as surface color industry, recipe formulation, and graphic arts industry. Conventional light sources, including xenon lamps, tungsten-halogen lamps, and fluorescent lamps, have been used as daylight simulators. In this article, a genetic algorithm is employed to investigate optimized channels for each daylight simulator. It is found that at least six LED channels are required to produce high quality daylight simulators in terms of the CIE Metamerism Indices. Furthermore, it is possible to create a spectrally tunable daylight simulator using six LED channels with wavelengths of 357, 420, 474, 533, 595, and 660 nm. This wavelength combination with appropriate intensity combinations can produce D 50, D 55, D 65, and D 75 simulators with good performance, in terms of the CIE Metamerism Indices.

40|$|The {{interference}} colors resulting from thin films of Al 2 O 3 deposited by {{atomic layer deposition}} (ALD) on silicon have been rigorously analyzed using a recently developed robotic gonioreflectometer. A series of eleven increasingly thick films was deposited, up to 1613 5, and their reflectance values obtained for the visible spectrum. A comparison of these values with the predictions of computer simulations employing Fresnel equations has revealed that while there was generally good agreement between predicted and measured spectra, there are some spectral regions that exhibit large deviations from predicted reflectances, typically at near-normal measurement angles and shorter wavelengths. The effect of these discrepancies on color appearance was investigated in the CIE L*a*b* color space for the <b>daylight</b> <b>illuminant</b> D 65. Large iridescence is both predicted and measured for most film thicknesses. Chroma and hue differences as large as 20 CIELAB units between the predicted and the measured color centers were obtained. Simulation also predicts larger iridescence than what is actually measured. A likely cause for the observed discrepancies is that the dielectric constants of the ALD films deviate from the literature values for the bulk material. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
40|$|Colour {{discrimination}} {{has been}} widely studied in red-green (R-G) dichromats but {{the extent to which}} their colour constancy is affected remains unclear. This work estimated the extent of colour constancy for four normal trichromatic observers and seven R-G dichromats when viewing natural scenes under simulated <b>daylight</b> <b>illuminants.</b> Hyperspectral imaging data from natural scenes were used to generate the stimuli on a calibrated CRT display. In experiment 1, observers viewed a reference scene illuminated by daylight with a correlated colour temperature (CCT) of 6700 K; observers then viewed sequentially two versions of the same scene, one illuminated by either a higher or lower CCT (condition 1, pure CCT change with constant luminance) or a higher or lower average luminance (condition 2, pure luminance change with a constant CCT). The observers' task was to identify the version of the scene that looked different from the reference scene. Thresholds for detecting a pure CCT change or a pure luminance change were estimated, and it was found that those for R-G dichromats were marginally higher than for normal trichromats regarding CCT. In experiment 2, observers viewed sequentially a reference scene and a comparison scene with a CCT change or a luminance change above threshold for each observer. The observers' task was to identify whether or not the change was an intensity change. No {{significant differences were found between}} the responses of normal trichromats and dichromats. These data suggest robust colour constancy mechanisms along daylight locus in R-G dichromacy.

40|$|Fluorescence has so {{far been}} found in 52 parrot species when {{illuminated}} with ultraviolet-A (UVA) 2 ̆ 7 black 2 ̆ 7 lamps, and two {{attempts have been made to}} determine whether such fluorescence plays any role in sexual signalling. However, the contribution of the reflectance versus fluorescence to the total radiance from feathers, even in the most studied species to date (budgerigars), is unclear. Nor has the plumage of this study species been systematically assessed to determine the distribution of fluorescent patches. We therefore used spectrofluorometry to determine which areas of budgerigars fluoresce and the excitation and emission spectra involved; this is the first time that such a technique has been applied to avian plumage. We found that both the yellow crown and (normally hidden) white downy chest feathers exhibit strong UVA-induced fluorescence, with peak emissions at 527 nm and 436 nm, respectively. Conversely, the bright-green chest and dark-blue tail feathers do not fluoresce. When comparing reflectance spectra (400700 nm) from the yellow crown using illuminants with a proportion of UVA comparable to <b>daylight,</b> and <b>illuminants</b> with all UVA removed, no measurable difference resulting from fluorescence was found. This suggests that under normal daylight the contribution of fluorescence to radiance is probably trivial. Furthermore, these spectra revealed that males had fluorescent crowns with substantially higher reflectance than those of females, in both the UV waveband and at longer wavelengths. Reflectance spectrophotometry was also performed on a number of live wild-type male budgerigars to investigate the chromatic contrast between the different plumage areas. This showed that many plumage regions are highly UV-reflective. Overall our results suggest that rapid surveys using UVA black lamps may overestimate the contribution of fluorescence to plumage coloration, and that any signalling role of fluorescence emissions, at least from the yellow crown of budgerigars, may not be as important as previously thought...|$|R

Pilot work suggested that Greek had terms {{for each of the}} Berlin & Kay (1969) eleven ‘universal categories’. These terms, plus [γalázjo] “light blue”, were the most frequent terms in Greek texts. Four naming studies with varying stimuli (Munsell, Color-aid and NCS), lighting (<b>daylight,</b> <b>illuminant</b> C and fluorescent), instructions (no restriction on terms or only essential terms), and informants (bilingual Greek-English students and monolingual Greek speakers from Crete) were carried out. Measures of basicness included frequency, consistency and consensus of use, naming time and ‘necessity’. The results supported the analysis of texts, suggesting that Greek has twelve BCTs, including two terms for blue. The ranges of the two blue terms differ mainly in lightness, and this division is similar to the equivalent divisions in Russian and Turkish. However, the positions of the best examples vary across the three languages presenting difficulties for a common account of the origins of the additional term. The use of BCTs was reasonably stable across variations in methods, stimuli, lighting and informants, suggesting that field studies with limited control over these variables may nevertheless be able to identify BCTs...|$|E

By continuous stirring, the ionic exchange reactions between these two components takes place. Then, these three nanopigments were applied in a transparent paint. In order to improve the dispersion in the paint, were added two kinds of dispersant (A 40, and N 40), and then, were analyze the effects of each dispersant in the results. The nanopigments synthesized firstly obtained in paste form, after centrifuging, the supernatant eliminating water, {{and the proportion of}} dye which has not been exchanged. That proportion was determined by measuring in a UV-Vis spectrophotometer Jasco- 650. This paste format which has been used to mix it in different rates, with the transparent paint base, for extension of different concentrations, and analyzing the obtained color range, and testing in a climatic chamber at SOLARBOX RH 1500 e, for a test of UV-Vis radiation resistance. A part of samples were dried by lyophilization (freezer LDplus ALPHA 1 - 2), in order to avoid agglomerates, and changes in structure with temperature drying. This powdered form has been used for characterization analysis by X-ray diffraction (Mettler Toledo equipment, model TGA/SDTA 851 e/SF/ 1100), to see how it affects the exchange of the three dyes, in the interlayer spacing of the clay, and thermogravimetric analysis (equipment TGA/SDTA 851 e/SF/ 1100) to check if the reinforcement, provides added resistance to loss of mass by temperature. Colorimetric analysis was performed by measuring the spectral reflectance of the extensions of paint applied on cardboards white-black, with an integrating sphere spectrophotometer Minolta CM-Kronica- 2600 D, with <b>daylight</b> <b>illuminant</b> D 65 and 10 ° observer. CIELAB color space was used to analyze the perceived color of the samples, and determine the colour differences with samples made with the pure dye.

The results showed that the initial hypothesis was correct, and there are a significant reinforcement of organic matter in both, the UV radiation and temperature resistance. The colors obtained are more pure than the original dye, and the color range increases, but the optical performance is significantly lower than that of the samples with the pure dye. That could be because of the lower concentration of pure dye, in these nanopigments, and by influence of the paint base...|$|E

Although much {{work has been}} done to determine the staining susceptibility of composite resins to various liquid beverages, effects of spices on colour stability of composite resins have not been fully researched. Objectives: The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate the colour stability of nano-filled (Filtek Supreme™) and micro-hybrid (Gradia Direct™) composite resins finished with either Sof-Lex™ discs or mylar strips upon exposure to turmeric, paprika and tamarind. Materials and methods: Twenty cylindrical specimens were fabricated from two commercially available composite resins; Filtek Supreme XT™ (3 M ESPE, St Paul, MN) and Gradia Direct X™(GC AMERICA). The top surfaces of the specimen were polished with Sof–Lex™ aluminium oxide discs (3 M/ESPE, St Paul, MN USA) while the bottom surfaces were mylar strips finished. All samples were subjected to 500 thermocycling rounds between 5 and 55 ºC with 20 seconds dwell time prior to immersion in staining solution. Twenty specimens from each type of composite were then randomly divided into 4 groups (n= 5) and immersed in each staining solutions (0. 1 % turmeric, paprika and tamarind) and distilled water (control) at 37 ºC. Colour measurement at baseline, after thermocycling, 24 hours (1 day), 72 hours (3 days) and 168 hours (7 days) of immersion in staining solutions were recorded with a reflection spectrophotometer under the D 65 (<b>daylight)</b> <b>illuminant</b> using CIE L* a* b* parameters. Repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Bonferroni post hoc tests were used to determine the significance and possible interactions of each factor. Results: Among all the staining solutions tested, the highest colour deviation was obtained in the turmeric group, with mean colour change (ΔE) ranging between 17. 92 and 55. 25. Paprika recorded mean colour change (ΔE) ranging between 1. 28 and 3. 72, while tamarind produced mean colour change (ΔE) ranging between 1. 12 and 5. 42. The effect of finishing method on colour stability of composite resins appeared to be dependent on the type of composite resin. Filtek Supreme™ with mylar strips finished generally resulted in significantly more colour changes compared with specimens polished Sof-Lex™ discs, while Gradia Direct™ finished with mylar strips were found to be more resistant to colour changes. Colour change (ΔE) values were significantly influenced by the staining solutions, types of materials and finishing methods. Conclusion: Within the limitations of this study, all spices used (turmeric, paprika and tamarind) have a potential to stain composite resins; with turmeric causing the most severe discolouration regardless of the type of composite resin or finishing technique employed. The result of this study also suggests that different materials respond differently to staining by spices when either finished with mylar strips or polished with Sof-Lex™ discs. Also, contemporary composite resins available in the market e. g. nano-composite and micro-filled hybrid composite are still susceptible to discolouration by exogenous factors despite advancement in the development of resin based restorative material.
