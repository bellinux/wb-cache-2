25|$|In humans, {{the protein}} is encoded by the RB1 gene located on {{chromosome}} 13—more specifically, 13q14.1-q14.2. If both alleles of this gene are mutated early in life, the protein is inactivated {{and results in}} development of retinoblastoma cancer, hence the name Rb. Retinal cells are not sloughed off or replaced, and are subjected {{to high levels of}} mutagenic UV radiation, and thus most pRB <b>knock-outs</b> occur in retinal tissue (but it's also been documented in certain skin cancers in patients from New Zealand where the amount of UV radiation is significantly higher).|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn 1997 Lampert and Slater {{introduced}} parallel <b>knock-out</b> schemes, an {{iterative process}} on graphs that goes through several rounds. In each round of this process, every vertex eliminates exactly {{one of its}} neighbors. The parallel <b>knock-out</b> number of a graph is the minimum number of rounds after which all vertices have been eliminated (if possible). The parallel <b>knock-out</b> number is related to well-known concepts like perfect matchings, hamiltonian cycles, and 2 -factors. We derive a number of combinatorial and algorithmic results on parallel <b>knock-out</b> numbers: for families of sparse graphs (like planar graphs or graphs of bounded tree-width), the parallel <b>knock-out</b> number grows at most logarithmically with the number n of vertices; this bound is basically tight for trees. Furthermore, there is a family of bipartite graphs for which the parallel <b>knock-out</b> number grows proportionally to the square root of n. We characterize trees with parallel <b>knock-out</b> number at most 2, and we show that the parallel <b>knock-out</b> number for trees can be computed in polynomial time via a dynamic programming approach (whereas in general graphs this problem {{is known to be}} NP-hard). Finally, we prove that the parallel <b>knock-out</b> number of a claw-free graph is either infinite or {{less than or equal to}} 2...|$|R

500|$|Advances in gene {{targeting}} technologies which hijack the homologous recombination mechanics of cells are now {{leading to the}} development of a new wave of more accurate, [...] isogenic human disease models. These engineered human cell models are thought to more accurately reflect the genetics of human diseases than their mouse model predecessors. This is largely because mutations of interest are introduced into endogenous genes, just as they occur in the real patients, and because they are based on human genomes rather than rat genomes. Furthermore, certain technologies enable the knock-in of a particular mutation rather than just <b>knock-outs</b> associated with older {{gene targeting}} technologies.|$|E
2500|$|The plant {{glutamate}} cysteine ligase (GCL) is a redox-sensitive homodimeric enzyme, conserved in {{the plant}} kingdom. [...] In an oxidizing environment, intermolecular disulfide bridges are formed and the enzyme switches to the dimeric active state. The midpoint potential of the critical cysteine pair is -318 mV. In addition to the redox-dependent control, the plant GCL enzyme is feedback inhibited by glutathione. GCL is exclusively located in plastids, and glutathione synthetase (GS) is dual-targeted to plastids and cytosol, thus [...] GSH and gamma-glutamylcysteine are exported from the plastids. Both glutathione biosynthesis enzymes are essential in plants; <b>knock-outs</b> of GCL and GS are lethal to embryo and seedling.|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} parallel <b>knock-out</b> schemes, {{a procedure}} on graphs introduced by Lampert and Slater in 1997 {{in which each}} vertex eliminates exactly one of its neighbors in each round. We are considering cases in which after {{a finite number of}} rounds, where the minimimum number is called the parallel <b>knock-out</b> number, no vertices of the graph are left. We derive a number of combinatorial and algorithmical results on parallel <b>knock-out</b> numbers. We observe that for families of sparse graphs (like planar graphs, or graphs with bounded tree-width), the parallel <b>knock-out</b> number grows at most logarithmically with the number n of vertices, which is basically tight for trees. Furthermore, we construct a family of bipartite graphs for which the parallel <b>knock-out</b> number grows proportionally to the square root of n.

2500|$|In a fully upright stance, {{the boxer}} stands with the legs shoulder-width apart and the rear foot a {{half-step}} {{in front of}} the lead man. Right-handed or orthodox boxers lead with the left foot and fist (for most penetration power). Both feet are parallel, and the right heel is off the ground. The lead (left) fist is held vertically about six inches {{in front of the}} face at eye level. The rear (right) fist is held beside the chin and the elbow tucked against the ribcage to protect the body. The chin is tucked into the chest to avoid punches to the jaw which commonly cause <b>knock-outs</b> and is often kept slightly off-center. Wrists are slightly bent to avoid damage when punching and the elbows are kept tucked in to protect the ribcage. Some boxers fight from a crouch, leaning forward and keeping their feet closer together. The stance described is considered the [...] "textbook" [...] stance and fighters are encouraged to change it around once it's been mastered as a base. Case in point, many fast fighters have their hands down and have almost exaggerated footwork, while brawlers or bully fighters tend to slowly stalk their opponents.|$|E
2500|$|The caspase {{proteins}} {{are integral}} {{parts of the}} apoptosis pathway, so it follows that <b>knock-outs</b> made have varying damaging results. [...] A caspase 9 knock-out leads to a severe brain malformation. [...] A caspase 8 knock-out leads to cardiac failure and thus embryonic lethality. [...] However, {{with the use of}} cre-lox technology, a caspase 8 knock-out has been created that exhibits an increase in peripheral T cells, an impaired T cell response, and a defect in neural tube closure. [...] These mice were found to be resistant to apoptosis mediated by CD95, TNFR, etc. but not resistant to apoptosis caused by UV irradiation, chemotherapeutic drugs, and other stimuli. [...] Finally, a caspase 3 knock-out was characterized by ectopic cell masses in the brain and abnormal apoptotic features such as membrane blebbing or nuclear fragmentation. [...] A remarkable feature of these KO mice is that they have a very restricted phenotype: Casp3, 9, APAF-1 KO mice have deformations of neural tissue and FADD and Casp 8 KO showed defective heart development, however in both types of KO other organs developed normally and some cell types were still sensitive to apoptotic stimuli suggesting that unknown proapoptotic pathways exist.|$|E
2500|$|While {{working with}} the cerebellum, Kreitzer's group also {{discovered}} that depolarization of Purkinje cells could also cause a temporary reduction in excitatory input into these cells from both climbing fibres and parallel fibres (Kreitzer et al. 2001b). [...] This phenomenon was termed depolarization-induced suppression of excitation (DSE), and differs from DSI only {{by the kind of}} neurotransmitter whose release is reduced. [...] In the case of depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition, the result is a reduction in inhibitory GABA release, while in DSE the effect is a reduction in excitatory glutamate release. [...] DSE was also found to occur in other regions of the brain, however the evidence for the involvement of the endocannabinoid receptor CB1 in this process is not as solid as it is for DSI. [...] Both depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition and DSE have been studied in the CB1 knock-out mice. [...] Some groups show that both depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition and DSE are lacking in these mice, while others have shown that DSE, but not depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition, can still be evoked in the <b>knock-outs</b> (Ohno-Shosaku et al. 2002, Hajos et al. 2001). [...] The endocannabinoids may still mediate DSE too, but by acting at a yet unknown cannabinoid receptor. [...] Interestingly, some work has shown that anandamide can bind to the vannilloid receptor VR1, the receptor responsible for mediating the effects of capsaicin. [...] This receptor is present in the brain, and anandamide actions at this receptor may potentially contribute to DSE (Cristino et al. 2006, Hajos et al. 2002). [...] However DSE is currently a largely unexplored phenomenon and {{more research is needed to}} draw any firm conclusions.|$|E

2500|$|Many <b>knock-outs</b> {{have been}} made in the {{apoptosis}} pathways to test the function of each of the proteins. [...] Several caspases, in addition to APAF-1 and FADD, have been mutated to determine the new phenotype. [...] In order to create a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) knockout, an exon containing the nucleotides 3704–5364 was removed from the gene. [...] This exon encodes a portion of the mature TNF domain, as well as the leader sequence, which is a highly conserved region necessary for proper intracellular processing. [...] TNF-/- mice develop normally and have no gross structural or morphological abnormalities. [...] However, upon immunization with SRBC (sheep red blood cells), these mice demonstrated a deficiency in the maturation of an antibody response; they were able to generate normal levels of IgM, but could not develop specific IgG levels. [...] Apaf-1 is the protein that turns on caspase 9 by cleavage to begin the caspase cascade that leads to apoptosis. [...] Since a -/- mutation in the APAF-1 gene is embryonic lethal, a gene trap strategy was used in order to generate an APAF-1 -/- mouse. [...] This assay is used to disrupt gene function by creating an intragenic gene fusion. [...] When an APAF-1 gene trap is introduced into cells, many morphological changes occur, such as spina bifida, the persistence of interdigital webs, and open brain. [...] In addition, after embryonic day 12.5, the brain of the embryos showed several structural changes. [...] APAF-1 cells are protected from apoptosis stimuli such as irradiation. [...] A BAX-1 knock-out mouse exhibits normal forebrain formation and a decreased programmed cell death in some neuronal populations and in the spinal cord, leading to an increase in motor neurons.|$|E

6000|$|... [1] In a {{treatise}} on boxing by Captain Edgeworth Johnstone, just published, I read, [...] "In {{the days of}} the prize-ring, fights lasted for hours; and the knock-out blow was unknown." [...] This statement is a little too sweeping. The blow was known well enough. A veteran prizefighter once described to me his first experience of its curious effect on the senses. Only, as he had thirty seconds to recover in instead of ten, it did not end the battle. The thirty seconds made the knock-out so unlikely that the old pugilists regarded it as a rare accident, not worth trying for. The glove fighter tries for nothing else. Nevertheless <b>knock-outs,</b> and very dramatic ones too (Mace by King, for example), did occur in the prize-ring from time to time. Captain Edgeworth Johnstone's treatise is noteworthy in comparison with the earlier Badminton handbook of sparring by Mr. E. B. Michell (one of the Queensberry champions) as throwing over the old teaching of prize-ring boxing with mufflers, and going in frankly for glove fighting, or, to put it classically, cestus boxing.|$|E
