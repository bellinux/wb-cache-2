40|$|During the First Chinese National Antarctic Research Expedition 1984 / 85,observation on {{whistler}} and VLF emission {{was carried}} out by using GM type VLF broadband <b>direction-finding</b> <b>receiver.</b> The morphology of whistlers received shows two peaks of their activity at 17 - 20 LT around sunset and at 03 - 06 LT of the early morning. Whistler dispersion is greater during sunset and less after midnight. Detailed analysis of whistler data of Januray 23 and 26 at Great Wall Station reveals that the dispersions of whistlers propagating in different shells markedly decrease on the day of geomagnetic storm commencement (January 23). It implies a rapid depletion of the electron density in the shells. There is a downward flux of electron of 1 ×(10) ^ 9 el/(cm) ^ 2 s. A steady refilling process occurs in shells of L- 2. 8 - 2. 9 three days after the storm on January 26. Whistler direction-finding data obtained on January 20 show that the exit points of the whistlers are situated in a strip of about 80 km wide in longitudes whith an azimuthal direction 20 °- 40 °E of N between 48 °- 52 ° geomagnetic latitude, and there are no obvious cross L or longitudinal drifts. Whistler data at Great Wall Station are very useful for deducing temporal and spatial variations of electron density in L- 2 - 3 shells and investigating particle interchange processes between the ionosphere and the plasmasphere...|$|E
40|$|The {{backbone}} of any military operation is the Army. However {{for an international}} war, a Navy {{is essential for the}} security of the sea and for the resupply of land operations. Both services can only be successful if the Air Force has control over the skies in the areas in which they operate. In the WWI the Air Force had a minor role. Telecommunications was developed during this time and in a few cases it played a decisive role. In WWII radar was able to find and locate the enemy and navigation systems existed that allowed aircraft to operate over friendly and enemy territory without visual aids over long range. This development took place at a breath taking speed from the Ultra High Frequency, UHF to the centimeter wave length. The decisive advantage and superiority for the Air Force or the Navy depended on who had the better radar and UHF technology. 0. 0 Aviation Radio and Radar Technology Before World War II From the very beginning radar technology was of great importance for aviation. In spite of this fact, the radar equipment of airplanes before World War II was rather modest compared with the progress achieved during the war. 1. 0 Long-Wave to Short-Wave Radiotelegraphy In the beginning, when communication took place only via telegraphy, long- and short-wave transmitting and receiving radios were used. 2. 0 VHF Radiotelephony Later VHF radios were added, which made communication without trained radio operators possible. 3. 0 On-Board Direction Finding A loop antenna served as a navigational aid for airplanes. This system combined with the on-board receiver made it possible to take a rudimentary bearing on radio stations and later on UHF direction beacons. Later a special receiver was developed that together with an auxiliary antenna enabled lateral location finding. In Germany another <b>direction-finding</b> <b>receiver</b> was developed {{that at the same time}} could pulse switch the phase of the auxiliary antenna and the output voltage so that an unambiguous bearing accuracy similar to the minimum bearing could be achieved without switching to minimum input voltage. The loop antenna, with its high aerodynamic drag, was replaced by a strip antenna placed in a flat covered housing...|$|E
2500|$|Armstrong {{realized}} that if radio <b>direction-finding</b> (RDF) <b>receivers</b> could be operated at a higher frequency, this would allow better detection of enemy shipping. However, at that time, no practical [...] "short wave" [...] (defined then as any frequency above 500kHz) amplifier existed, due to the limitations of existing triodes.|$|R
