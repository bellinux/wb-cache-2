25|$|On {{the morning}} of 17 September 2007, a brand-new <b>gym</b> <b>bag</b> was left {{in front of a}} shop lot in PJS 1/48, Petaling Jaya, {{discovered}} by the shop owner. It contained an unidentified child's naked body which was stuffed in a fetal position; police believed that she had been dead for more than six hours before the discovery. A cucumber and a brinjal was found stuffed inside her genitals and had caused her rectum to rupture. It was determined that bacterial infection had contributed to her death. At the time, Nurin Jazlin's parents were not able to identify the body as their daughter's due to the changes in her physical features; it was even suggested that the child might be a foreigner, as she lacked a scar which would be caused by the mandatory BCG vaccination against tuberculosis. Her parents initially maintained hope that their daughter might be alive and were the victims of several prank calls from people claiming that Nurin was under their care. Later DNA tests conducted confirmed the body as Nurin Jazlin's.|$|E
