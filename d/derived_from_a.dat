2500|$|It {{appears from}} Watkins (1937) that the tense-marker -ta- <b>derives</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> {{compound}} tense formed with the verb -ti [...] "say" [...] which has fused {{into a single}} verb. Thus átákhúta [...] "after his hunger was satisfied" [...] <b>derives</b> <b>from</b> <b>an</b> earlier wátí wákhúta.|$|R

5|$|Biological {{structures}} or sequences {{in different}} taxa are homologous {{if they are}} <b>derived</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> common ancestor. Homology thus implies divergent evolution. For example, many insects (such as dragonflies) possess two pairs of flying wings. In beetles, the first pair of wings {{has evolved into a}} pair of hard wing covers, while in Dipteran flies the second pair of wings has evolved into small halteres used for balance.|$|E
50|$|Nonmucinous BAC {{is thought}} to <b>derive</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> {{transformed}} cell in the distal airways and terminal respiratory units, and often shows features of club cell or Type II pneumocyte differentiation. Mucinous BAC, in contrast, probably <b>derives</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> transformed glandular cell in distal bronchioles.|$|R

5|$|In this clause the adverbial, helehgüjgeer 'without saying ' must {{precede the}} predicate's complement, üünijg 'it-' {{in order to}} avoid {{syntactic}} ambiguity, since helehgüjgeer is itself <b>derived</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> verb and hence an üünijg preceding it could be construed as its complement. If the adverbial was an adjective such as hurdan 'fast', it could optionally immediately precede the predicate. There are also cases in which the adverb must immediately precede the predicate.|$|E
5|$|Knowledge about dinosaurs is <b>derived</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> {{variety of}} fossil and non-fossil records, {{including}} fossilized bones, feces, trackways, gastroliths, feathers, impressions of skin, internal organs and soft tissues. Many {{fields of study}} contribute {{to our understanding of}} dinosaurs, including physics (especially biomechanics), chemistry, biology, and the earth sciences (of which paleontology is a sub-discipline). Two topics of particular interest and study have been dinosaur size and behavior.|$|E
5|$|Paine's creed encapsulates many of {{the major}} themes {{of the rest of}} his text: a firm belief in a creator-God; a {{skepticism}} regarding most supernatural claims (here the afterlife, later in the text, miracles); a conviction that virtues should be <b>derived</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> consideration for others rather than oneself; an animus against corrupt religious institutions; and an emphasis on the individual's right of conscience.|$|E

5|$|Satan preaches from {{a raised}} earth mound and {{is dressed in}} {{clerical}} clothing {{that may be a}} soutane. He has a goat-like beard and horns, and stands in silhouette, accentuating his heavy body and gaping mouth, which is depicted as if he is screaming. His form may be <b>derived</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> 1652 illustration of the Canaanite idol Molech, as illustrated by Athanasius Kircher.|$|E
5|$|The composited camera {{negative}} of Citizen Kane {{was destroyed}} in a New Jersey film laboratory fire in the 1970s. Subsequent prints were <b>derived</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> master positive (a fine-grain preservation element) made in the 1940s and originally intended for use in overseas distribution. Modern techniques were used to produce a pristine print for a 50th Anniversary theatrical reissue in 1991 which Paramount released for then-owner Turner Broadcasting System, which earned $1.6 million in North America.|$|E
5|$|The {{garden warbler}} {{was given the}} {{binomial}} name Motacilla borin by the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert in 1783. The current genus name is from Modern Latin silvia, a woodland nymph, related to silva, a wood. The specific borin is <b>derived</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> local name for the bird in the Genoa area of Italy; it derives from the Latin bos, ox, because the warbler was believed to accompany oxen.|$|E

5|$|The genus Gymnogyps is {{an example}} of a relict distribution. During the Pleistocene epoch, this genus was {{widespread}} across the Americas. From fossils, the Floridan Gymnogyps kofordi from the Early Pleistocene and the Peruvian Gymnogyps howardae from the Late Pleistocene have been described. A condor found in Late Pleistocene deposits on Cuba was initially described as Antillovultur varonai, but has since been recognized as another member of Gymnogyps, Gymnogyps varonai. It may even have <b>derived</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> founder population of California condors.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) are <b>derived</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> {{forecast}} by city planners in 1967 which stated {{the need for a}} rail-based urban transport system by 1992. Following a debate on whether a bus-only system would be more cost-effective, then Minister for Communications Ong Teng Cheong, {{came to the conclusion that}} an all-bus system would be inadequate, as it would have to compete for road space in a land-scarce country.|$|E
5|$|There are no interventional {{studies that}} {{directly}} show mortality benefit of cholesterol lowering in FH. Rather, evidence of benefit is <b>derived</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> number of trials conducted {{in people who}} have polygenic hypercholesterolemia (in which heredity plays a smaller role). Still, a 1999 observational study of a large British registry showed that mortality in people with FH had started to improve in the early 1990s when statins were introduced.|$|E

5|$|Thor {{closely resembles}} other Indo-European deities {{associated}} with the thunder: the Celtic Taranis, the Baltic Perkūnas, the Slavic Perun, and particularly the Hindu Indra, whose red hair and thunderbolt weapon the vajra are obvious parallels. Scholars have compared Indra's slaying of Vritra with Thor's battle with Jörmungandr. Although in the past {{it was suggested that}} Thor was an indigenous sky god or a Viking Age import into Scandinavia, these Indo-European parallels make him generally accepted today as ultimately <b>derived</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> Proto-Indo-European deity.|$|E
5|$|To develop {{resistance}} to RNAi, the {{western corn rootworm}} would {{have to change the}} genetic sequence of its Snf7 gene at multiple sites. Combining multiple strategies, such as engineering the protein Cry, <b>derived</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> bacterium called Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), and RNAi in one plant delay the onset of resistance.|$|E
5|$|After the 2004 {{release of}} , Powderfinger took a hiatus, and several members {{played in the}} side {{projects}} Drag and The Predators. Fanning decided to work independently and acted on direction he felt unable to explore {{as a member of}} Powderfinger. Some of his inspiration was <b>derived</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> will {{to see if he was}} capable of recording a solo album, considering what he viewed as his limited guitar playing abilities; compared to bandmates Darren Middleton and Ian Haug. The distance from the band, coupled with the more relaxed writing process for Tea & Sympathy helped Fanning to unwind from the stress left over from 10 years working recording and touring with Powderfinger.|$|E
