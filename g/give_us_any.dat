25|$|We {{know from}} Plutarch that Xenocrates, {{if he did}} not explain the Platonic {{construction}} of the world-soul as Crantor after him did, nevertheless drew heavily on the Timaeus; and further that he was at the head of those who, regarding the universe as unoriginated and imperishable, looked upon the chronological succession in the Platonic theory as a form in which to denote the relations of conceptual succession. Plutarch unfortunately, does not <b>give</b> <b>us</b> <b>any</b> further details, and contented himself with describing the well-known assumption of Xenocrates, that the soul is a self-moving number. Probably we should connect with this the statement that Xenocrates called unity and duality (monas and duas) deities, and characterised the former as the first male existence, ruling in heaven, as father and Zeus, as uneven number and spirit; the latter as female, as the mother of the gods, and as the soul of the universe which reigns over the mutable world under heaven, or, as others have it, that he named the Zeus who ever remains like himself, governing in the sphere of the immutable, the highest; the one who rules over the mutable, sublunary world, the last, or outermost.|$|E
25|$|The Panarion furnishes very {{valuable}} {{information concerning the}} religious history of the fourth century, either because the author confines himself to transcribing documents preserved by him alone, or because he writes down his personal observations. With regard to Hieracas (Haer., lxvii), he makes known a curious Egyptian sect by whom asceticism and intellectual work were equally esteemed. In connection with the Meletians of Egypt (Haer., lxviii), he has preserved important fragments of contemporary Egyptian history of this movement. With regard to Arianism (Haer., lxix), if he gives an apocryphal letter of Constantine, he transcribes two letters of Arius. He {{is the only one}} to <b>give</b> <b>us</b> <b>any</b> information concerning the Gothic sect of the Audians (Haer., lxx), as well as the Arabian sect of the Collyridians. He has made use of the lost report of the discussion between Photinus (Haer., lxxi), and Basil of Ancyra. He has transcribed a very important letter from Bishop Marcellus of Ancyra (Haer., lxxii) to Pope Julius, and fragments of the treatise of Acacius of Caesarea against Marcellus. With regard to the Semiarians (Haer., lxxiii), he gives in the Acts of the Council of Ancyra (358) a letter from Basil of Ancyra and one from George of Laodicea, and the stenographic text of a singular sermon of Melitius {{at the time of his}} installation at Antioch. In the chapter dealing with the Anomeans (Haer., lxxvi) he has preserved a monograph of Aetius.|$|E
500|$|After {{passing on}} using Renault's new power {{unit in the}} United States and Mexico, Red Bull {{equipped}} Daniel Ricciardo's car with the new specification unit, which earned him a ten-place grid penalty in the process. Once he had tried the new unit during the free practice and qualifying sessions, Ricciardo lamented that the upgrade had not improved the performance. He said: [...] "In hindsight, it didn't <b>give</b> <b>us</b> <b>any</b> laptime, it's just for now a penalty {{for a little bit}} of knowledge." [...] During the first practice session on Friday, Mercedes tried out what was dubbed a [...] "S-duct", a vent to channel airflow through the nose of the car, a feature already seen at other cars {{over the course of the}} season. However, Mercedes decided not to run the device over the whole weekend.|$|E

50|$|Descendants of {{the earth}} human/Tevarian mix would {{eventually}} rescue Earth from alien conquerors who could mind lie - which they used to conquer the telepathic League of All Worlds. This is the 'backstory' to City of Illusions. The reunification is mentioned in The Left Hand of Darkness, though no story has yet <b>given</b> <b>us</b> <b>any</b> details.|$|R
5000|$|Some critics {{noted that}} McGrath aimed to lower people's {{expectations}} for the album during its promotion by saying things like: [...] "I know people aren't {{sitting on the edge}} of their seats waiting for a Sugar Ray album, but that wasn't the point." [...] In another interview, Murphy Karges, bassist said, [...] "We've never had any credibility. Nobody ever <b>gave</b> <b>us</b> <b>any</b> so how could we lose any?" ...|$|R
500|$|Several titles were {{considered}} during production, including [...] "Shot Down in Flames" [...] and [...] "IV". The former was rejected because Martin thought {{it sounded like}} a title The Beta Band would use. Taylor supported the name [...] "IV" [...] because he liked [...] "giving people the wrong impression all the time", and defended his opinion, saying [...] "if [...] <b>give</b> <b>us</b> <b>any</b> time, they would see that we're very serious about comedy ... and serious things as well". The album was called [...] "Made in the Dark" [...] because it was a title the band agreed on. Taylor considered the eponymous track to be one of his favourite songs, and thought it was nice to name the album after a thoughtful song, in contrast to Coming on Strong and The Warning, which he described as being [...] "big, slightly jokey, macho phrases".|$|E
500|$|Edna Gunderson of USA Today was positive, commenting, [...] "The music, while upbeat {{and even}} giddy, steers away from {{adolescent}} pranks and pratfalls, a welcome upgrade. The band creates a fresh breed of post-punk power pop by roughing up bright melodies." [...] AllMusic's Brian O'Neill gave the album three stars, {{calling it a}} [...] "far cry from the party-boy ethos DeLonge is best known for, and he wears the emotional depth well, with songs that are just as hooky as from his bread-winning main squeeze." [...] A reviewer for Q admitted that the musicians [...] "confound expectations with a very good record." [...] The positive reception of the album was {{in contrast to the}} reviews for Blink, which were often negative. [...] "I think it's a cop-out for [...] to like the music I do," [...] DeLonge told the Arizona Daily Star. [...] "Critics can't say they like Blink or <b>give</b> <b>us</b> <b>any</b> credit, 'cause we're out there goofing around." [...] Barker was more critical: [...] "I especially don't care what the critics say. Most of them are like 50 years old and they're not really educated in what kind of music we're playing to begin with!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Another {{drawback}} {{of systematic}} sampling {{is that even}} in scenarios where it is more accurate than SRS, its theoretical properties {{make it difficult to}} quantify that accuracy. (In the two examples of systematic sampling that are given above, much of the potential sampling error is due to variation between neighbouring houses – but because this method never selects two neighbouring houses, the sample will not <b>give</b> <b>us</b> <b>any</b> information on that variation.) ...|$|E

2500|$|John Mitchell of MTV News praised Knowles' dance {{skills and}} sexiness {{in the video}} despite being pregnant, and called it [...] "a feast for the eyes" [...] and [...] "a perfect mix of classic and modern, {{which seems to be}} what Beyoncé is aiming for in this era of her career". A writer of The Huffington Post {{described}} the video as [...] "characteristically kinetic". Chris Coplan of Consequence of Sound wrote that [...] "the concept may be simple, but the intricate dance numbers (take that, Fred Astaire!) and split screen action make for an energetic cinematic affair with loads of modern swag and '60s-inspired sass." [...] Joe Marvilli of the same publication wrote that the retro horns in the song, match the 1960s [...] "throwback visuals" [...] as Knowles [...] "sashes through a variety of classy outfits and energetic dance moves. It's as full of sass and swagger, as if she'd <b>give</b> <b>us</b> <b>any</b> less". Entertainment Weeklys Grady Smith compared Knowles with Nicki Minaj and called the video a [...] "typical Beyoncé dance-fest featuring frenetic movement, flashing colors, {{and a whole lot of}} sexy outfits". Contessa Gayles of [...] The Boombox also compared Knowles look and make-up in the video with Minajs style. Lisa Potter of Marie Claire compared Knowles with Andy Warhol. Carrie Battan of Pitchfork Media called it a [...] "clean and classic, filled with blocked colors, Audrey Hepburn stylings and the occasional flashing of the baby bump". Luke Jennings of The Guardian called the video a [...] "slick, very new-retro piece of film-making, and borrowed imagery is absolutely the point of it". Stereogum wrote that the video [...] "has [...] potential to be the most electric Beyoncé video since the immortal classic 'Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)'". Similarly, Matt Donnelly of Los Angeles Times described the video as [...] "so fantastic it borders on annoying" [...] and added that it could be a miniature version of [...] "Single Ladies". AOL Musics Marina Galperina called the video [...] "mod-tastic" [...] and the editing [...] "funky" [...] and [...] "collaged".|$|E
2500|$|I met Henry James {{the other}} night at Emerson's, at an Alcottian conversation, at which, however, Alcott did not talk much, being {{disturbed}} by James's opposition. [...] The latter is a hearty man enough, with whom you can differ very satisfactorily, both {{on account of his}} doctrines and his good temper. [...] He utters quasi-philanthropic dogmas in a metaphysic dress; but they are, for all practical purposes, very crude. [...] He charges society with all the crime committed, and praises the criminal for committing it. [...] But I think that all the remedies he suggests out of his head—for he goes no farther, hearty as he is—would leave us about where we are now. [...] For, of course, it is not by a gift of turkeys on Thanksgiving Day that he proposes to convert the criminal, but by a true sympathy with each one,—with him, among the rest, who lying tells the world from the gallows that he has never been treated kindly by a single mortal since he was born. [...] But it is not so easy a thing to sympathize with another, though you may have the best disposition to do it. [...] There is Dobson over the hill. [...] Have not you and I and all the world been trying to sympathize with him since he was born (as doubtless he with us), and yet we have got no further than to send him to the House of Correction once at least; and he, on the other hand, has sent us to another place several times. [...] This is the real state of things as I understand it, at least so far as James's remedies. [...] We are now, alas! exercising what charity we actually have, and new laws would not <b>give</b> <b>us</b> <b>any</b> more. [...] But perchance, we might make some improvements in the House of Correction. [...] You and I are Dobson; what will James do for us?.|$|E

6000|$|... "What on earth, or sea, ever set {{the old man}} off again?" [...] inquired Crosby, in an aggrieved whisper. [...] "It's {{two weeks}} since he's <b>given</b> <b>us</b> <b>any</b> Central American {{independent}} flapdoodle--long enough for those nigger injins to have had half a dozen revolutions. You know that the vessels that put into San Juan have saluted one flag in the morning, and have been fired at under another in the afternoon." ...|$|R
60|$|Then, without <b>giving</b> <b>us</b> <b>any</b> further {{opportunity}} of speaking, Bausi rose, {{and followed by}} Imbozwi and his councillors, marched off into his big hut. We too, were marched off, this time under a double guard commanded by someone whom I had not seen before. At {{the gate of the}} kraal we halted and asked for the arms that had been taken from us. No answer was given; only the soldiers put their hands upon our shoulders and thrust us along.|$|R
5000|$|When one {{questioned}} {{him if he}} had decided to leave the band, he declared: [...] "A.

We had a meeting in which we spoke about several topics, but apparently he said to us that we were replaceable and that we could leave if we wanted, that the door was opened.

60|$|It seem a pity {{that the}} world should throw away so many good things merely because they are unwholesome.

Yet {{there are people who}} strictly deprive themselves of each and every eatable, drinkable and smokable which has in any way acquired a shady reputation. They pay this price for health.

One of the most striking aspects of physics is the simplicity of its laws. Maxwell’s equations, Schrödinger’s equation, and Hamiltonian mechanics can each be expressed in a few lines.
