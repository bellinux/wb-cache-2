5|$|The M249 is <b>gas</b> <b>operated</b> and air-cooled. It has a quick-change barrel, {{allowing}} the gunner to rapidly replace an overheated or jammed barrel. A folding bipod is attached {{near the front}} of the gun, though an M192 LGM tripod is available. It can be fed from both linked ammunition and STANAG magazines, like those used in the M16 and M4. This allows the SAW gunner to use a rifleman's magazines as an emergency source of ammunition in the event that he runs out of linked rounds.|$|E
25|$|In 1940, {{after the}} Red Army {{accepted}} for service the 61-K 37mm anti-aircraft gun, the VVS leadership decided to equip some fighters {{and a part}} of the upcoming production series of the Ilyushin Il-2 ground attack aircraft with a 37mm autocannon capable of firing the same shell. Shpitalniy designed a gun that was <b>gas</b> <b>operated</b> and magazine fed, which however used a less powerful cartridge than the 61-K gun.|$|E
25|$|The Lewis gun was <b>gas</b> <b>operated.</b> A {{portion of}} the {{expanding}} propellant gas was tapped off from the barrel, driving a piston to the rear against a spring. The piston was fitted with a vertical post at its rear which rode in a helical cam track in the bolt, rotating {{it at the end}} of its travel nearest the breech. This allowed the three locking lugs at the rear of the bolt to engage in recesses in the gun's body to lock it into place. The post also carried a fixed firing pin, which protruded through an aperture in the front of the bolt, firing the next round at the foremost part of the piston's travel.|$|E

25|$|The first {{telephone}} lines were installed in 1882 and electric street lights took {{the place of}} the <b>gas</b> <b>operated</b> ones in 1886. The Hipódromo de Maroñas started operating in 1888, and the neighbourhoods of Reus del Sur, Reus del Norte and Conciliación were inaugurated in 1889. The new building of the School of Arts and Trades, as well as Zabala Square in Ciudad Vieja were inaugurated in 1890, followed by the Italian Hospital in 1891. In the same year, the village of Peñarol was founded. Other neighbourhoods that were founded were Belgrano and Belvedere in 1892, Jacinto Vera in 1895 and Trouville in 1897. In 1894 the new port was constructed, and in 1897, the Central Railway Station of Montevideo was inaugurated.|$|E
500|$|It fires {{from an open}} bolt and is <b>gas</b> <b>operated.</b> When {{the trigger}} is pulled, the bolt and bolt carrier move forward under {{the power of the}} recoil spring. A {{cartridge}} is stripped from the belt, chambered, and discharged, sending a bullet down the bore. Expanding propellant gases are diverted {{through a hole in the}} barrel into a chamber. This pressure moves a piston providing the energy to extract and eject the spent casing as well as advance the belt and compress the recoil spring, thus preparing for subsequent shots. At [...] long and [...] in weight ( [...] including a 200-round belt and plastic ammo box), the M249 is a cumbersome weapon.|$|E

2500|$|It {{has been}} pointed out {{that this was a}} {{practical}} design which should have worked, but it didn't. Apart from possible inconsistencies in the ammunition supplied, the real problem was that the gun used, a <b>gas</b> <b>operated</b> Hotchkiss 8mm (.323 in) machine gun borrowed from the French army, was fundamentally unsuitable for [...] "semi-automatic" [...] firing. Following initial unsuccessful tests the gun had to be returned, and the experiments ceased.|$|E
2500|$|The Marlin, being a <b>gas</b> <b>operated</b> gun, proved less {{amenable}} to synchronization than the Vickers.

The problem was eventually resolved by modifications to the Marlin's trigger mechanism, {{but in the meantime}} the engineer Adolph L. Nelson, at the Airplane Engineering Department at McCook Field had developed a new, mechanical gear especially adapted to the Marlin, officially known as the Nelson single shot synchronizer. [...] In place of the push rod common to many mechanical gears, or the [...] "pull rod" [...] of the Sopwith-Kauper, the Nelson gear used a cable held in tension for the transmission of firing impulses to the gun.|$|E

2500|$|Since blank {{cartridges}} generate {{very little}} recoil, {{far less than}} that produced by a live round, the recoil operation mechanism is not suitable for use with blanks.

[...] Short recoil operated pistols, {{the most common type}} used for self-defense and by police, are typically converted with a simple barrel replacement; the replacement barrel will lack the locking lugs to lock the slide to the frame, and will be built with an adjustable restrictor to control the chamber pressure.

To charge the rifle, the charging handle on the receiver must be pulled. The upper receiver is manufactured from an aluminum alloy while the lower receiver, along with pistol grip and shoulder stock, is manufactured as one piece from impact-resistant polymer.

Standard sights include a front post installed on the M16-style removable base and a detachable M16A2-style carrying handle with built-in diopter sight. On the upper receiver, an integral Picatinny rail exists which will accept detachable carrying handle or optional red-dot or other optical sight attachments.|$|E
2500|$|The Thompson Submachine Gun was {{developed}} by General John T. Thompson who originally envisioned an [...] "auto rifle" [...] (semi-automatic rifle) to replace the bolt action service rifles then in use. While searching {{for a way to}} allow such a weapon to operate safely without the complexity of a recoil or <b>gas</b> <b>operated</b> mechanism, Thompson came across a patent issued to John Bell Blish in 1915 based on adhesion of inclined metal surfaces under pressure. Thompson found a financial backer, Thomas F. Ryan, and started the Auto-Ordnance Company in 1916 for the purpose of developing his [...] "auto rifle". It was primarily developed in Cleveland, Ohio. The principal designers were Theodore H. Eickhoff, Oscar V. Payne, and George E. Goll. By late 1917, the limits of the Blish Principle were discovered: rather than working as a locked breech, it functioned as a friction-delayed blowback action. It was found that the only cartridge currently in U.S. service suitable for use with the lock was the [...]45 ACP round. Thompson then envisioned a [...] "one-man, hand-held machine gun" [...] in [...]45 ACP as a [...] "trench broom" [...] for use in the ongoing trench warfare of World War I. Payne designed the gun itself and its stick and drum magazines. The project was then titled [...] "Annihilator I" [...] and by 1918, most of the design issues had been resolved. However, the war ended two days before prototypes could be shipped to Europe.|$|E
