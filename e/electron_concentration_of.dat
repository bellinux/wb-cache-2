40|$|We {{study the}} surface {{conductivity}} of a field-effect transistor (FET) made of periodic array of spherical semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs). We show that electrons introduced to NCs by the gate voltage occupy {{one or two}} layers of the array. Computer simulations and analytical theory are used to study the array screening and corresponding evolution <b>of</b> <b>electron</b> <b>concentrations</b> <b>of</b> {{the first and second}} layers with growing gate voltage. When first layer NCs have two electrons per NC the quantization energy gap between its 1 S and 1 P levels induces occupation of 1 S levels of second layer NCs. Only at a larger gate voltage electrons start leaving 1 S levels of second layer NCs and filling 1 P levels of first layer NCs. By substantially larger gate voltage, all the electrons vacate the second layer and move to 1 P levels of first layer NCs. As a result of this nontrivial evolution of the two layers concentrations, the surface conductivity of FET non-monotonically depends on the gate voltage.

40|$|We {{report on}} the {{fabrication}} of Al-doped ZnO (AZO) transparent-conductive oxide (TCO) films on glass substrates by RF-sputtering, their physical properties, {{and the effect of}} thermal annealing on the AZO TCO films. The AZO films on glass substrates have a preferred orientation of the c-axis, irrespective of deposition conditions, which means that the AZO films have textured structures along the c-axis. The film thickness and surface roughness in the AZO films are proportional to plasma power and deposition time, while they are inverse-proportional to working gas ratio and working pressure. The AZO films have the optical transmittance over 80 % in the wavelength range of 400 – 1000 nm, irrespective of deposition conditions. The plasma power and the deposition time relatively give a large influence on the optical transmittance, compared to the working gas ratio and the working pressure. The AZO films deposited at room temperature have poor electrical properties, while the thermal annealing under Ar ambient significantly improves the electrical conductivity of the AZO films: an as-deposited sample has an electrical resistivity of 87 Wcm and an <b>electron</b> <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> 1. 3 ´ 1017 cm− 3, while the annealed sample has an electrical resistivity of 3. 7 ´ 10 - 2 Wcm and an <b>electron</b> <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> 1. 2 ´ 1020 cm− 3...|$|E
