5|$|I was in Russia, then Germany, {{and spent}} a lot of time in Eastern Europe. There is this amazing German house-techno music, so <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a pop {{experimental}} record. I kind of wanted to leave the '80s a little bit, so the chorus is a '90s melody, which is what the inspiration was. There was certainly some whisky involved in the writing of the record. It's about being in love with your best friend.|$|E
25|$|Talk a Good Game was {{inspired}} by R artists New Edition, Pebbles, and Babyface, Rowland spoke on the album's musical direction saying “ feels like everything <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> as far as music and R, <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> sure my roots were really pronounced on this album.” Rowland cited Whitney Houston, Marvin Gaye, and Stevie Wonder as the album's inspirations.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a Flash Gordon movie, {{with all}} the trimmings, but I couldn't obtain {{the rights to the}} characters. So I began researching and went right back and found where Alex Raymond (who had done the {{original}} Flash Gordon comic strips in newspapers) had got his idea from. I discovered that he'd got his inspiration from the works of Edgar Rice Burroughs (author of Tarzan) and especially from his John Carter of Mars series books. I read through that series, then found that what had sparked Burroughs off was a science-fantasy called , written by Edwin Arnold and published in 1905. That was the first story in this genre that I have been able to trace. Jules Verne had got pretty close, I suppose, but he never had a hero battling against space creatures or having adventures on another planet. A whole new genre developed from that idea.|$|E

500|$|Vespertine is {{an album}} {{made by a}} {{character}} who's very introvert.(sic) And it's about the universe inside every person. This time around, <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> sure that the scenery of the songs is not like a mountain or a city or outside, it's inside, so it's very internal. So I guess all three videos are very internal. [...] Sort of how you communicate with {{the world in a}} very intimate, personal way.|$|E
500|$|... "Pour Me", {{the last}} soft {{song on the}} album, is a dark ballad that has been often {{compared}} to Eminem's [...] "Stan". Johnny3Tears stated that, [...] "We were messing around with chord progressions and that came out like a more major chord style than we were used to it. It's melodic and poppy sounding. We're talking about drinking obviously because all of us sometimes drink too much. It's one of those basic every day things that people go through but they don't know how to voice it or others around them don't know to voice it. It's almost like you're looked down upon, but no one actually talks about it." [...] "Tendencies", which is the closing track for the standard edition of the album, is a high tempo alternative metal song about murder. Johnny3Tears said, [...] "When we wrote Tendencies, <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a song that kids would just go nuts to when we played it. Kids start moshpits at our shows.

500|$|Mackin also {{composed}} {{an entire}} string section and conducted an orchestra in the album. In {{an interview with}} Daily Nexus in June 2006, Mackin revealed that the conducting was the easy part and that the composing part was much harder. In this interview, Mackin also commented, [...] "composing was getting so frustrating since I wasn’t writing as fast as my mind was thinking, so going back <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> sure that each of my arrangements for this album and the 12 different songs were completely different".|$|E

500|$|Nine Inch Nails' {{earliest}} influences include Ministry and Skinny Puppy, {{which helped}} shape what became 1989's Pretty Hate Machine. The album's liner notes also {{paid tribute to}} the hip-hop group Public Enemy and Prince. Another large influence on the band's sound is Gary Numan, which is evident as Reznor once said that [...] "after hearing 'Cars' I knew <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> music with synthesizers". The 2005 single [...] "Only" [...] exemplifies the disco-style beats and synthesizers drawn from Numan's persuasion.

500|$|Carpenter {{originally}} {{wrote the}} screenplay for Escape from New York in 1976, {{in the aftermath}} of the Watergate scandal. Carpenter said, [...] "The whole feeling of the nation was one of real cynicism about the President. I wrote the screenplay and no studio wanted to make it" [...] because, according to Carpenter, [...] "it was too violent, too scary, too weird." [...] He had been inspired by the film Death Wish, which was very popular at the time. He did not agree with this film's philosophy but liked how it conveyed [...] "the sense of New York as a kind of jungle, and <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a science fiction film along these lines".|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with MTV News in August 2002, Maroon 5 vocalist Adam Levine, when asked behind the development of [...] "Harder to Breathe", admitted that the song describes the band's frustration with their label, Octone Records, during the making of their debut album, Songs About Jane. The band thought they had enough material for a release, but when the label told them to keep writing, Levine wrote this song in frustration at the pressure. [...] "That song comes sheerly from wanting to throw something. It was the 11th hour, and the label wanted more songs. It was the last crack.

500|$|In {{the words}} of Robert Smith, {{regarding}} the album's conception, [...] "I had two choices at the time, which were either completely giving in [...] or making a record of it and getting it out of me".

Smith was mentally exhausted {{during that period of}} time: [...] "I was in a really depressed frame of mind between 1981 and 1982".

The home did not open for another five years, and Tubman was dismayed when the church ordered residents to pay a $100 entrance fee. She said: [...] "hey make a rule that nobody should come in without they have a hundred dollars. Now <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a rule that nobody should come in unless they didn't have no money at all."
