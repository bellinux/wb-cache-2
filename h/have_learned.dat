60|$|As he {{drew near}} the Big River, {{he was very}} watchful and careful, was Blacky, for this was the season when hunters with terrible guns were abroad, and he had {{discovered}} that they {{were likely to be}} hiding along the Big River, hoping to shoot Mr. or Mrs. Quack or some of their relatives. So he was very watchful as he drew near the Big River, for he <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> that it was dangerous to pass too near a hunter with a terrible gun. More than once he had been shot at. But he <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> by these experiences. Oh, yes, Blacky <b>had</b> <b>learned.</b> For one thing, he <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> to know a gun when he saw it. For another thing, he <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> just how far away one of these dreadful guns could be and still hurt the one it was pointed at, and to always keep just a little farther away. Also he <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> that a man or boy without a terrible gun is quite harmless, and he <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> that hunters with terrible guns are tricky and sometimes hide from those they seek to kill, so that in the dreadful hunting season it is best to look sharply before approaching any place.|$|R

5|$|Although {{pronounced}} differently, Wicca {{is related}} to the Old English word wicca, which referred to sorcerers in Anglo-Saxon England.

He claimed to <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> the term during his initiation into the New Forest coven in 1939. By the late 1950s, Gardner's rival Charles Cardell, founder of his own tradition, had begun referring to the religion's followers as Wiccens, and possibly used Wicca in reference to the religion itself.|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} was to determine the effect of learning models on learning achievement viewed from student learning creativity. The learning models compared were Think-Talk-Write with Mind Mapping (TTW-MM), Think-Talk-Write (TTW) and direct instruction model. The research used the quasi-experimental research method. The population of {{the research}} was all of the students in grade VIII of junior high schools in Kudus regency on academic year 2015 / 2016. The size of the sample was 275 students consisted of 91 students in the first experimental group, 92 students in the second experimental group, and 92 students in the third experimental group. The results of the research are as follows. (1) The students instructed with the <b>learning</b> model TTW-MM <b>had</b> <b>learning</b> achievement as good as those instructed with the learning model TTW, and a both of them better than direct instruction, the students instructed with the <b>learning</b> model TTW <b>had</b> <b>learning</b> achievement better than those instructed with direct instruction.

(3) In each learning model, the students with the high creativity <b>had</b> <b>learning</b> achievement better than those with the medium creativity and low creativity, the students with the medium creativity <b>had</b> <b>learning</b> achievement better than those with the low creativity.

This activity was linked to cases of Campylobacter gastroenteritis in Gateshead in northeast England and led the Department of Health to suggest that milk from bottles which had been pecked open should be discarded. It was recommended that steps be taken to prevent birds attacking bottles in future.|$|E
5|$|Ernest {{believed}} he could communicate with both extraterrestrials and historical figures, channeling messages from them. In 1954, seeking to popularize his channeling, Ernest and Ruth formed an organization known as Unarius, operating {{from their home in}} California. After their marriage, Ruth served as Ernest's typist, later claiming to <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> the skill while sleeping. She recorded the information he channeled, writing books about psychic healing and trips into the solar system. In the 1950s and 1960s, they attracted several followers, including two students whom they later taught to channel. One early trainee was Charles Spiegel, who later led the group. Many converts had previous involvement with New Age or mystic groups, making it easy for the Normans to convert them.|$|E

5|$|Food {{is mostly}} {{selected}} by sight, even in conditions of dim light. Movement of the prey triggers a feeding response. Frogs {{have been caught}} on fish hooks baited with red flannel and green frogs (Rana clamitans) have been found with stomachs full of elm seeds that they had seen floating past. Toads, salamanders and caecilians also use smell to detect prey. This response is mostly secondary because salamanders have been observed to remain stationary near odoriferous prey but only feed if it moves. Cave-dwelling amphibians normally hunt by smell. Some salamanders seem to <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> to recognize immobile prey when it has no smell, even in complete darkness.|$|E
5|$|Midshipmen were {{expected}} {{to work on the}} ship, but were also expected to learn navigation and seamanship.

On smaller ships, midshipmen were instructed by a senior master's mate, often a passed midshipman, who taught them mathematics, navigation, and sailing lore. Larger ships would carry a schoolmaster, who was rated as a midshipman but usually was a civilian like the chaplain. Midshipmen {{were expected to}} keep detailed navigational logs, which were shown to the captain to assess their progress.|$|E
5|$|Mockingbird nests {{are also}} often parasitized by cowbirds. The parents {{are found to}} reject {{parasitic}} eggs at an intermediate rate. A recent study has shown that foreign eggs {{are more likely to}} be rejected from a nest later in the breeding season than from earlier in a breeding season. Early nesting hosts may not <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> the pattern and coloration of their first clutch yet, so are less likely to reject foreign eggs. There is also a seasonal threshold in terms of the overlap between the breeding seasons of the northern mockingbirds and their parasites. If the breeding season of the parasites starts later, there is less likelihood of parasitism. Hence, it pays the hosts to have relatively lower sensitivity to parasitic eggs.|$|E

5|$|The German birds {{wintering}} in British gardens rely on provided food, and {{the major}} items are bread and fat, each making up around 20% of the diet; one bird survived the whole winter eating only Christmas cake. Fruit is also eaten, notably cotoneaster (41% of the fruit consumed), ivy and honeysuckle, and apple if available. Some birds <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> to take peanuts from feeders. Blackcaps defend good winter food sources in the wild, and at garden feeding stations they repel competitors as large as starlings and blackbirds. Birds occasionally become tame enough to feed from the hand.|$|E
5|$|The Navajo may <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> {{to weave}} from their Pueblo Indian neighbors {{when they moved}} into the Four Corners region during the year 1000 A.D. Some experts contend that the Navajo were not weavers until after the 17th century. The Navajo {{obtained}} cotton through local trade routes {{before the arrival of}} the Spanish, after which time they began to use wool. The Pueblo and Navajo were not generally on friendly terms due to frequent Navajo raids on Pueblo settlements, yet many Pueblo sought refuge with their Navajo neighbors in the late 17th century to evade the conquistadors {{in the aftermath of the}} Pueblo Revolt. This social interchange is the probable origin of the distinctive Navajo weaving tradition. Spanish records show that Navajo people began to herd sheep and weave wool blankets from that time onward.|$|E
