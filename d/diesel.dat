5|$|At Survivor Series 1994, the storyline with Michaels and <b>Diesel</b> saw Michaels accidentally superkick <b>Diesel</b> once again. As a result, <b>Diesel</b> {{turned on}} Michaels, {{becoming}} {{a face and}} vacating the Tag Team Championship. Three days later, Bob Backlund put <b>Diesel</b> over by dropping his WWF World Heavyweight Championship in a match that lasted eight seconds. <b>Diesel</b> feuded with Michaels and defended the belt against him at WrestleMania XI.|$|E

5|$|Despite Michaels {{winning the}} right to be escorted by Pamela Anderson to his WWF World Heavyweight Championship match against <b>Diesel</b> at WrestleMania, Anderson came to the ring with <b>Diesel</b> instead. Michaels's bodyguard, Sycho Sid, {{attempted}} to interfere on Michaels's behalf but ultimately helped <b>Diesel</b> retain the title. <b>Diesel</b> offered Michaels a rematch, and Michaels told Sid {{that he would not be}} needed in the upcoming match. Upset with Michaels, Sid attacked Michaels until <b>Diesel</b> came to Michaels's rescue. <b>Diesel</b> and Michaels became allies once again and teamed up to win the WWF Tag Team Championship later that year.|$|E
5|$|Michaels and Diesel's feud resumed at the Royal Rumble when Michaels {{attacked}} <b>Diesel</b> {{during his}} match with Hart. Michaels then became the top {{contender for the}} WWF World Heavyweight Championship by winning the 1995 Royal Rumble match. <b>Diesel</b> won their match at WrestleMania after Sid, Michaels' new bodyguard, accidentally distracted the referee. <b>Diesel</b> offered Michaels a rematch, and Michaels told Sid that his services would not be required during the rematch. Sid attacked Michaels, and <b>Diesel</b> came to Michaels' defense. This attack caused Michaels to turn face, and he and <b>Diesel</b> resumed their friendship and won the WWF Tag Team Championship later in 1995.|$|E
5|$|The WWF World Heavyweight Championship {{match between}} Bret Hart and <b>Diesel</b> came next. <b>Diesel</b> was {{accompanied}} by Shawn Michaels, and Hart was joined by brother-in-law and former tag-team partner Jim Neidhart. <b>Diesel</b> used his size against Hart, but Hart managed to perform a Figure Four leglock on <b>Diesel.</b> After this was broken, the wrestlers fought outside the ring. Michaels got involved and attacked Hart. Back inside the ring, the Hart and <b>Diesel</b> fought as Michaels removed the turnbuckle pad. Hart reversed Diesel's attack, however, and slammed Diesel's head into the turnbuckle. Hart put <b>Diesel</b> in the Sharpshooter, but <b>Diesel</b> easily reached the ropes to break the hold. Michaels attacked Hart while the referee's back was turned, which allowed <b>Diesel</b> to perform the Jackknife powerbomb. Before he could pin Hart, however, Neidhart interfered to cause the disqualification and allow Hart to retain his title. After the match, <b>Diesel</b> and Michaels attacked Hart, but Neidhart left the ring.|$|E

5|$|The WWF World Heavyweight Championship {{match was}} next, in which <b>Diesel</b> defended the title against Bret Hart. <b>Diesel</b> began the match by clotheslining Hart, but Hart gained the {{advantage}} {{by focusing on}} injuring Diesel's knee. He performed the figure four leglock twice before attacking <b>Diesel</b> outside the ring. <b>Diesel</b> regained the advantage by using his size and strength to throw Hart and perform power moves to wear him down. Hart tied Diesel's legs to the ring post {{with a piece of}} tape and kicked him repeatedly. <b>Diesel</b> recovered and performed the Jackknife power bomb on Hart. Before the referee could count the pinfall, Shawn Michaels ran to the ring and attacked <b>Diesel.</b> The referee ordered the match to continue, and the match went back and forth until Hart used the Sharpshooter submission hold to place pressure on Diesel's injured leg. Owen Hart interfered by attacking Bret, but the match was ordered to continue. Bret Hart and <b>Diesel</b> brawled until Bret rolled <b>Diesel</b> up for a pinfall. The referee was knocked unconscious, and Michaels, Jarrett, and The Roadie came to the ring to attack <b>Diesel.</b> Meanwhile, Owen Hart and Bob Backlund attacked Bret Hart. Because the referee could not control the match, it was declared a draw and <b>Diesel</b> retained his championship.|$|E
5|$|The first {{match of}} the event saw The Bad Guys, which {{consisted}} of Razor Ramon, the 1-2-3 Kid, the Davey Boy Smith, and The Headshrinkers (Sione and Fatu) versus The Teamsters, composed of <b>Diesel,</b> Shawn Michaels, Jeff Jarrett, Owen Hart, and Jim Neidhart. The opening minutes of the match featured brothers-in-law Hart and Smith trading moves as well as Jarrett and Ramon brawling. Fatu became the first wrestler eliminated after <b>Diesel</b> performed a Jackknife powerbomb on him. <b>Diesel</b> eliminated the 1-2-3 Kid forty-two seconds later after another Jackknife powerbomb. Sione followed thirty-one seconds later after being pinned by <b>Diesel.</b> Davey Boy Smith entered the ring, but <b>Diesel</b> soon knocked him between the ropes to the arena floor. Hart and Neidhart prevented Smith from getting back in the ring, and Smith was eliminated after the referee counted him out. Razor Ramon was left as {{the only member of}} his team to face the five members of The Teamsters. He fought with <b>Diesel</b> for several minutes, but <b>Diesel</b> then performed the Jackknife powerbomb on him and prepared to pin him for the victory. Michaels insisted on having <b>Diesel</b> hold Ramon while Michaels performed a superkick on their opponent. Ramon dodged the kick, and Michaels kicked <b>Diesel</b> in the face. <b>Diesel</b> became angry at Michaels, particularly because the same mistake had cost <b>Diesel</b> the Intercontinental Championship at SummerSlam. He and Michaels argued outside the ring {{while the rest of the}} team attempted to calm them down. The referee counted all five wrestlers out of the ring and declared Razor Ramon the winner of the match. Shawn Michaels was shown backstage after the match, and he stated that he was disbanding his tag team with <b>Diesel</b> and vacating the Tag Team Championship. He then got into a car and drove away from the arena.|$|E
5|$|The {{other main}} event at WrestleMania was {{a match for}} the WWF World Heavyweight Championship between <b>Diesel</b> and Shawn Michaels. <b>Diesel</b> had {{originally}} entered the WWF as Michaels's bodyguard but later began wrestling and forming a tag team with Michaels. The pair held the WWF Tag Team Championship together in 1994. At Survivor Series 1994, however, Michaels accidentally kicked <b>Diesel</b> in the face. This led to an argument during which <b>Diesel</b> dissolved the tag team and vacated the championship. Three days later, <b>Diesel</b> defeated Bob Backlund to become the new WWF Champion. At Royal Rumble 1995, Michaels won the battle royal main event, which earned him a match against <b>Diesel</b> for the title belt at WrestleMania.|$|E

It is shown that the character of wear of cylinder shells and crankpins affect negatively the technicaloperating parameters and limit the resource of <b>diesels</b> as a whole. The wear value is proportional to operating time of <b>diesels,</b> but there are the cases of considerable deviations of value and intensity of wear of parts of responsible tribosystems, which affect the set resource of <b>diesels</b> before a major overhaul...|$|R

5|$|The pay-per-view's {{main event}} was a {{standard}} {{match for the}} WWF Championship, where the champion <b>Diesel</b> defended the title against Sid (managed by Ted DiBiase). Late in the contest, <b>Diesel</b> performed a Jacknife Powerbomb on Sid and went for the pinfall. Tatanka came out and attacked <b>Diesel,</b> which resulted in <b>Diesel</b> retaining the championship via disqualification. Tatanka, along with DiBiase, attacked <b>Diesel.</b> Sid attempted to perform a powerbomb, but Bam Bam Bigelow ran to the ring, forcing the villains {{to go to the}} outside.|$|E
5|$|A feud began between Shawn Michaels and Mr. Perfect after WrestleMania IX as {{a result}} of Michaels attacking Perfect. They faced each other at SummerSlam 1993, and Michaels won by countout after his new bodyguard, <b>Diesel</b> {{attacked}} Perfect. Perfect then feuded with <b>Diesel</b> until leaving the WWF.|$|E
5|$|After beating Razor Ramon for the WWF Intercontinental Championship in April 1994, <b>Diesel</b> was in {{the midst}} of a major push. He was {{considered}} the top contender to Bret Hart's WWF World Heavyweight Championship, and a match was booked for King of the Ring in which only Hart's title would be on the line. The feud intensified on the May 30, 1994, episode of Monday Night Raw during Jerry Lawler's interview segment, The King's Court. During an interview with Hart, Lawler invited <b>Diesel</b> and his friend Shawn Michaels to confront Hart. After a verbal confrontation, <b>Diesel</b> performed his Jacknife Powerbomb on Hart, after which <b>Diesel,</b> Michaels and Lawler attacked Hart. The following week on Monday Night Raw, Bret announced that he would have a family member, whose identity would be a secret until the pay-per-view, in his corner to help prevent Michaels from interfering on Diesel's behalf.|$|E
5000|$|On December 17, 2007, the SIJHL {{announced}} {{the cessation of}} the Schreiber <b>Diesel's</b> season.

The <b>diesel</b> trainsets will be moved to service on the Danbury or Waterbury branches, or to the planned Hartford Line from New Haven to Springfield.|$|E
5|$|Bam Bam Bigelow {{challenged}} Lawrence Taylor to a match, which Taylor accepted after initially refusing. <b>Diesel</b> trained Taylor, {{who beat}} Bigelow at WrestleMania XI. Embarrassed, Bigelow challenged <b>Diesel</b> to {{a match for}} the WWF World Heavyweight Championship. Tatanka was at ringside for the match; he turned on Bigelow and caused him to lose. Bigelow attacked Tatanka after the match, which led to Sid, a new addition to the Corporation, to come to Tatanka's defense. This led to a tag team match at King of the Ring 1995, where <b>Diesel</b> and Bigelow defeated Tatanka and Sid.|$|E
50|$|Four vintage <b>diesels</b> {{have been}} {{restored}} to operation, three for excursion trains and {{one as a}} switcher. The U.S. Navy in Oahu donated three <b>diesels</b> and the U. S. Army donated one locomotive in the 1970s. All diesel-electric|diesel locomotives are operational.|$|R

50|$|TH&B 71 cost $191,712 at the time. For comparison, Alco 1,000 hp (750 kW) yard {{switchers}} {{built in}} Schenectady, New York cost $115,000 including duty, while CPR G5 class 4-6-2 steam locomotives cost $88,000. The benefit of <b>diesels</b> over steam was largely their reduced operating costs compared to steam, {{but they had}} to be kept going to pay for themselves. Increased utilization was key to their cost benefits. Steam locomotives were inherently labor-intensive machines to operate even though less expensive to buy and operate than <b>diesels.</b> The greatest savings were to be had in yard service where switching often meant idle time. It was here that <b>diesels</b> made their first major inroads into the scene. Early road <b>diesels</b> were less dependable than yard engines and failure on the road away from a quick replacement engine would affect operations. Railways were not always willing to trust <b>diesels</b> with passenger trains that were themselves an advertisement for the railway, nor on freight trains that paid the bills.|$|R
5|$|Bam Bam Bigelow {{was embarrassed}} {{after losing to}} Lawrence Taylor. To redeem himself, he {{challenged}} <b>Diesel</b> to a match for the WWF Championship. During the match, Tatanka turned on Bigelow and caused him to get pinned. Bigelow {{was kicked out of}} the Million Dollar Corporation and attacked by DiBiase's wrestlers. <b>Diesel</b> saved Bigelow from the attack, which led to a friendship being formed between the two. Bigelow defeated Tatanka in a dark match at In Your House 2. At King of the Ring 1995, Sid, DiBiase's latest addition to the Corporation, teamed with Tatanka in a loss to the team of <b>Diesel</b> and Bigelow.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{failing to}} capture the WWF World Heavyweight Championship at King of the Ring, <b>Diesel</b> {{continued}} to enjoy an unprecedented push. In 1994, {{he became the first}} wrestler in WWF history to win the WWF's Triple Crown in one calendar year. The Headshrinkers dropped the tag team title to <b>Diesel</b> and Michaels one day before SummerSlam 1994. <b>Diesel</b> followed this up by winning the WWF World Heavyweight Championship on November 26, 1994.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the next}} match, <b>Diesel</b> threw Razor Ramon out of the ring, {{allowing}} Michaels to remove the turnbuckle padding. Payton argued with Michaels about his interference, drawing the referee's attention. Michaels {{seized the opportunity to}} attack Ramon behind the referee's back. <b>Diesel</b> used two big boots and a series of submission holds to maintain the advantage. When he tried to throw Ramon into the unprotected turnbuckle, Payton pointed out the missing padding to the referee, who stood in the way to prevent the move. Soon after, <b>Diesel</b> tried to ram Ramon into the turnbuckle, but Ramon escaped and pushed <b>Diesel</b> into the turnbuckle. Ramon kept his momentum by performing a bulldog, a scoop slam, and a superplex. When Michaels tried to get involved again, Payton chased him around the outside of the ring. While the referee was distracted, Michaels entered the ring and tried to perform a superkick while <b>Diesel</b> held Ramon. Ramon moved, causing Michaels to kick <b>Diesel</b> instead. Ramon pinned <b>Diesel</b> to win the match and regain the Intercontinental Championship.|$|E
