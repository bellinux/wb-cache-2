25|$|Earlier {{infrared}} observations {{had been}} made by both space-based and ground-based observatories. Ground-based observatories have the drawback that at infrared wavelengths or frequencies, both the Earth's atmosphere and the telescope itself will radiate (glow) strongly. Additionally, the atmosphere is opaque at most infrared wavelengths. This necessitates lengthy exposure times and greatly decreases the ability to detect faint objects. It could be compared to trying to observe the stars at noon. Previous space observatories (such as IRAS, the Infrared Astronomical Satellite, and ISO, the <b>Infrared</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Observatory)</b> were launched during the 1980s and 1990s and great advances in astronomical technology have been made since then.|$|E
25|$|Near InfraRed Spectrograph (NIRSpec) {{will also}} perform {{spectroscopy}} {{over the same}} wavelength range. It was built by the European Space Agency at ESTEC in Noordwijk, Netherlands. The leading development team is composed of people from Airbus Defence and Space, Ottobrunn and Friedrichshafen, Germany, and the Goddard Space Flight Center; with Pierre Ferruit (École normale supérieure de Lyon) as NIRSpec project scientist. The NIRSpec design provides three observing modes: a low-resolution mode using a prism, an R~1000 multi-object mode and an R~2700 integral field unit or long-slit spectroscopy mode. Switching of the modes is done by operating a wavelength preselection mechanism called the Filter Wheel Assembly, and selecting a corresponding dispersive element (prism or grating) using the Grating Wheel Assembly mechanism. Both mechanisms {{are based on the}} successful ISOPHOT wheel mechanisms of the <b>Infrared</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Observatory.</b> The multi-object mode relies on a complex micro-shutter mechanism to allow for simultaneous observations of hundreds of individual objects anywhere in NIRSpec's field of view.

We present low {{resolution}} multi-object spectroscopy of an I-band magnitude limited (IAB ≃ 23 – 23. 5) sample of galaxies {{located in an}} area centered on the Hubble Deep Field-South (HDFS). The observations were obtained using the Focal Reducer/low dispersion Spectrograph (FORS) on the ESO Very Large Telescope. Thirtytwo primary spectroscopic targets in the HST-WFPC 2 HDFS were supplemented with galaxies detected in the <b>Infrared</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Observatory’s</b> survey of the HDFS and the ESO Imaging Deep Survey to comprise a sample of 100 galaxies for spectroscopic observations. Based on detections of several emission lines, such as [OII]λ 3727, Hβ and [OIII]λ 5007, or of other spectroscopic features, we measured accurate redshifts for 50 objects in the central HDFS and flanking fields. The redshift range of the current sample of galaxies is 0. 6 – 1. 2, with a median redshift of 1. 13 (at I≃ 23. 5 not corrected for completeness). The sample is dominated by starburst galaxies with {{only a small fraction}} of ellipticals (∼ 10 %). For the emission line objects, the extinction corrected [OII]λ 3727 line strengths yield estimates of star formation rates in the range 0. 5 – 30 M⊙/yr.

40|$|We {{carry out}} {{a study of the}} {{hardness}} of the radiation of ionizing clusters in HII regions. Firstly, we explore the applicability of the softness parameter, originally defined in the optical for pairs of consecutive ionization stages of the same species. With the advent of the <b>infrared</b> <b>space</b> <b>observatories,</b> this definition has been extended to the mid-infrared. We show that the softness parameters, as determined both in the optical and the mid-infrared wavelengths, are sensitive to the effective temperature using a sample of data in both spectral regimes. This is confirmed by comparing the data with a grid of photoionization models, although no complete agreement has been found even for different stellar model atmospheres. Finally, we show that both softness parameters are consistent in the search for radial variations of the hardness of the ionizing radiation of HII regions in the discs of spiral galaxies. We find a range of trends, from galaxies showing pronounced gradients to those showing very flat ones. Although the detectability and slope of these gradients can be altered by the size and luminosity of the studied HII regions, it looks that their existence is related to the mass and type of the galaxies and, hence, to the roperties of the entire disc.

40|$|Although {{variations}} in elemental abundance ratios in the Milky Way Galaxy certainly exist, details remain uncertain, {{particularly in the}} inner Galaxy, where stars and H II regions in the Galactic plane are obscured optically. In this paper we revisit two previously studied, inner Galaxy H II regions: G 333. 6 − 0. 2 and W 43. We observed three new positions in G 333. 6 − 0. 2 with the Kuiper Airborne Observatory and reobserved the central position with the <b>Infrared</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Observatory’s</b> Long Wavelength Spectrometer in far-infrared lines of S ++, N ++, N +, and O ++.
