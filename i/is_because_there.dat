5|$|An ultra diffuse galaxy (UDG) is an extremely-low-density galaxy. The galaxy may be {{the same}} size as the Milky Way but has a visible star count of only 1% of the Milky Way. The lack of {{luminosity}} <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>there</b> is a lack of star-forming gas in the galaxy which results in old stellar populations.|$|E
5|$|The {{enzymology}} of proteases {{provides some}} of the clearest known examples of convergent evolution. The same geometric arrangement of triad residues occurs in over 20 separate enzyme superfamilies. Each of these superfamilies is the result of convergent evolution for the same triad arrangement within a different structural fold. This <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>there</b> are limited productive ways to arrange three triad residues, the enzyme backbone and the substrate. These examples reflect the intrinsic chemical and physical constraints on enzymes, leading evolution to repeatedly and independently converge on equivalent solutions.|$|E
5|$|This {{is because}} land birds in high {{northern}} latitudes, where food becomes scarce in winter, leave for areas further south (including the Southern Hemisphere) to overwinter, {{and because the}} continental landmass is much larger in the Northern Hemisphere. In contrast, among (pelagic) seabirds, species of the Southern Hemisphere {{are more likely to}} migrate. This <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>there</b> is a large area of ocean in the Southern Hemisphere, and more islands suitable for seabirds to nest.|$|E

5000|$|After {{living in}} Oregon from 1843 to 1848, Peter H. Burnett wrote: Oregonians <b>were</b> all honest, <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> nothing to steal; they <b>were</b> all sober, <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no liquor to drink; <b>there</b> <b>were</b> no misers, <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> {{no money to}} hoard; and they <b>were</b> all industrious, <b>because</b> it <b>was</b> work or starve.|$|R
5|$|Each {{attempt to}} answer the mind–body problem {{encounters}} substantial problems. Some philosophers argue that this <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>there</b> is an underlying conceptual confusion. These philosophers, such as Ludwig Wittgenstein and his followers {{in the tradition of}} linguistic criticism, therefore reject the problem as illusory. They argue that it is an error to ask how mental and biological states fit together. Rather it should simply be accepted that human experience can be described in different ways—for instance, in a mental and in a biological vocabulary. Illusory problems arise if one tries to describe the one in terms of the other's vocabulary or if the mental vocabulary is used in the wrong contexts. This is the case, for instance, if one searches for mental states of the brain. The brain is simply the wrong context for the use of mental vocabulary—the search for mental states of the brain is therefore a category error or a sort of fallacy of reasoning.|$|E
5|$|Parliamentary {{sovereignty}} {{means that}} Parliament can, if it chooses, legislate contrary to fundamental principles of human rights. The Human Rights Act 1998 will not detract from this power. The constraints upon its exercise by Parliament are ultimately political, not legal. But {{the principle of}} legality means that Parliament must squarely confront what it is doing and accept the political cost. Fundamental rights cannot be overridden by general or ambiguous words. This <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>there</b> is too great a risk that the full implications of their unqualified meaning may have passed unnoticed in the democratic process. In the absence of express language or necessary implication to the contrary, the courts therefore presume {{that even the most}} general words were intended to be subject to the basic rights of the individual. In this way the courts of the United Kingdom, though acknowledging the sovereignty of Parliament, apply principles of constitutionality little different from those which exist in countries where the power of the legislature is expressly limited by a constitutional document.|$|E
25|$|The {{sizes of}} drums and cymbals given below are typical. Many drummers differ {{slightly}} or radically from them. Where no size is given, it <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>there</b> {{is too much}} variety to call a typical size.|$|E
25|$|Other {{studies have}} found that in a context where both {{languages}} are valued, the acquisition of the languages is not affected. This may <b>be</b> <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> more opportunities to use both languages.|$|R
6000|$|Oh, I am so happy! I {{wonder if}} there is another girl {{in the world as}} happy as I am tonight. No, of course <b>there</b> cannot <b>be,</b> <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> only one Walter! ...|$|R
5000|$|The initial {{images of}} the blaze {{suggested}} that the tower might be nearly destroyed. However Rem Koolhaas said that [...] "they are simply rebuilding it as it <b>was,</b> <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no structural damage." ...|$|R
25|$|Babinet's {{paradox is}} that {{contrary}} to naïve expectations, {{the amount of}} radiation removed from a beam in the diffraction limit is equal to twice the cross-sectional area. This <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>there</b> are two separate processes which remove radiation from the beam in equal amounts: absorption and diffraction.|$|E
25|$|The {{stranger}} bears {{a certain}} objectivity {{that makes him}} a valuable member to the individual and society. People let down their inhibitions around him and confess openly without any fear. This <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>there</b> is {{a belief that the}} Stranger is not connected to anyone significant and therefore does not pose a threat to the confessor's life.|$|E
25|$|Most research, such as {{studies done}} by UNICEF, {{suggests}} that boys {{are much more}} likely than girls to be trafficked for the purposes of begging; experts presume this <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>there</b> is a greater female presence in trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation. In Albania, where forced begging is a common practice, seventy percent of victims are male.|$|E
50|$|FCI Danbury became {{exclusively}} for female inmates in 1993. This <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> {{a lack of}} space {{for women in the}} Northeastern United States and due to the {{growth in the number of}} female prisoners.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} days of the colony of New South Wales, it was {{sometimes}} known as Stonequarry Cove and Stone Quarry Creek. This may have <b>been</b> <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> once a nearby quarry in Five Dock.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I'm {{perfectly}} well, thank you. But, whatever I {{may have}} said, I don't approve of that poor creature showing herself for--for money. She is selling herself. It must <b>be</b> <b>because</b> <b>there's</b> {{no other way}} out." ...|$|R
25|$|A 2015 study {{concluded}} that the low barriers to entry in a competitive market such as coffee undermines any effort to give higher benefits to producers through Fair Trade. They used data from Central America, to establish that the producer benefits were close to zero. This <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>there</b> is an oversupply of certification, and {{only a fraction of}} produce classified as Fair Trade is actually sold on Fair Trade markets, just enough to recoup the costs of certification.|$|E
25|$|A monotreme is an {{egg laying}} mammal. This theory <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>there</b> {{have been some}} reports that the waitoreke lays eggs. Known {{monotremes}} are the platypus and the six species of echidna, which are all native to Australia and New Guinea. The description of the echidna differs from the common description of the waitoreke. The platypus is more like {{the description of the}} waitoreke but still different. A new type of monotreme is also possible.|$|E
25|$|Flight: Flight {{muscles are}} the most {{specialised}} category of muscle and are capable of rapid contractions. Nerve impulses are required to initiate muscle contractions and therefore flight. These muscles are also known as neurogenic or synchronous muscles. This <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>there</b> is a one-to-one correspondence between action potentials and muscle contractions. In insects with higher wing stroke frequencies the muscles contract more frequently than at the rate that the nerve impulse reaches them and are known as asynchronous muscles.|$|E
50|$|St. Paul's {{is known}} as the 'Winter Church' and St. Lawrence, on West Wycombe Hill as the 'Summer Church.' This <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no road up to St. Lawrence until 1928 and no power until the 1970s.|$|R
5000|$|In 1997, Andy Paley {{looked back}} on Brian Wilson as [...] "a pretty good record, but it wasn't {{as good as}} it could have <b>been</b> <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> too many cooks, and Brian wasn't really calling the shots." ...|$|R
50|$|Glenugie {{was one of}} {{a number}} of distilleries that failed to {{continue}} past the 1983 market. This <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> too much competition at the time, leading to about a dozen single malt distilleries closing in this year.|$|R
25|$|The Earth's current orbital {{inclination}} is 1.57° (see above). Earth presently {{moves through the}} invariable plane around January 9 and July 9. At these times, there {{is an increase in}} meteors and noctilucent clouds. If this <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>there</b> is a disk of dust and debris in the invariable plane, then when the Earth's {{orbital inclination}} is near 0° and it is orbiting through this dust, materials could be accreted into the atmosphere. This process could explain the narrowness of the 100,000-year climate cycle.|$|E
25|$|Galectins are a {{large family}} with {{relatively}} broad specificity. Thus, they have a broad variety of functions including mediation of cell–cell interactions, cell–matrix adhesion and transmembrane signalling. Their expression and secretion is well regulated, suggesting they may be expressed at different times during development. There are no serious defects when individual galectin genes are deleted in knock-out mouse models. This <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>there</b> is substantial overlap for the essential functions. The list of functions for galectins is extensive and it is unlikely they have all been discovered. A handful of the main functions are described below.|$|E
25|$|The World Health Organization, {{looking at}} global public health, {{identifies}} fluoride {{as one of}} a few chemicals (along with the arsenic and nitrate, {{and to a lesser extent}} lead, selenium and uranium) that are found in excessive levels in many parts of the world and cause negative health effects; for fluoride this is especially true in large regions of India, China, Central Africa and South America, and locally in many parts of the world. Only for fluoride does it recommend adjusting the level in places where the chemical is low to reach a threshold; this <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>there</b> is clear evidence that low concentrations provide protection against cavities, both in children and in adults.|$|E

25|$|The {{compliance}} {{component of}} a Single Audit covers the study and understanding (planning stage) {{as well as the}} testing and evaluation (exam stage) of the recipient with respect to federal assistance usage, operations and compliance with laws and regulations. The financial component is exactly like a financial audit of a non-federal entity which includes the audit of the financial statements and accompanying notes. Depending on the recipient, the Single Audit can be simple and straightforward, or it could be complex and troublesome. This <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>there</b> are millions of federal grants awarded each year to thousands of recipients, each with its own independent way of operating. Therefore, the Single Audit differs from recipient to recipient and from federal program to program.|$|E
25|$|Police {{brutality}} {{is measured}} {{based on the}} accounts {{of people who have}} experienced or seen it, as well as the juries who are present for trials involving police brutality cases. This <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>there</b> is no way to quantify the use of excessive force for any particular situation. Because police brutality is relative to a situation, it depends on if the suspected person(s) is(are) resisting. Out {{of the people who were}} surveyed about their account with the police brutality in 2008, only about 12% felt as if they had been resisting. Although police force itself cannot be quantified, the opinion of brutality among various races, genders, and ages can. African Americans, women, and younger people are more likely to have negative opinions about police than Caucasians, men, and middle-aged to elderly individuals.|$|E
25|$|D {{note that}} the {{internal}} energy, , of a solution is lowered by the electrical interaction of its ions, but that this effect can't be determined by using the crystallographic approximation for distances between dissimilar atoms (the cube root of the ratio of total volume {{to the number of}} particles in the volume). This <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>there</b> is more thermal motion in a liquid solution than in a crystal. The thermal motion tends to smear out the natural lattice that would otherwise be constructed by the ions. Instead, D introduce the concept of an ionic atmosphere or cloud. Like the crystal lattice, each ion still attempts to surround itself with oppositely charged ions, but in a more free-form manner; at small distances away from positive ions, one is more likely to find negative ions and vice versa.|$|E
50|$|Before the {{integration}} of engines in ships, the maritime professions consisted of deck department jobs. This <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no engine for engineers to work on. The type of propulsion used before the engine powered paddle wheel was wind power.|$|R
50|$|There are no parking {{facilities}} {{available on}} Line 1. The MMRDA stated that this <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no space available.
