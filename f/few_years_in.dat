5|$|Asuma is a male wizard with a {{frivolous}} {{personality and}} {{is the director of}} Kamisaid Magic Academy. He likes using magic to surprise others, such as making flowers and small birds appear out of nowhere. His sacrifice for magic is that he ages quickly. For example, when Misaki was saved by him, she was surprised he had aged a <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>in</b> one day.|$|E

30|$|These {{distributions}} {{show that}} low-educated workers work {{less in the}} formal sector. On average, {{by the age of}} 70, under this policy, low-educated workers spend about two <b>fewer</b> <b>years</b> <b>in</b> formal employment relative to the benchmark, an effect that is primarily explained by {{the right side of the}} distribution. Individuals with high and medium levels of education also work for <b>fewer</b> <b>years</b> <b>in</b> the formal sector by the age of 70 relative to the benchmark, respectively on average 4 and 3.4 <b>years</b> <b>fewer.</b> <b>In</b> all these cases, it is explained mainly by the fact that they prefer to retire as soon as possible. Moreover, the distribution for workers with high and medium education levels is more concentrated around the threshold of 30 <b>years</b> than <b>in</b> the benchmark.|$|R

5|$|The Meander {{volunteer}} fire brigade {{was formed in}} 1972, though a station was not built until some years after. They received their first fire truck in 1973, {{which had to be}} kept at member's houses for the first <b>few</b> <b>years.</b> <b>In</b> 1991 the brigade had approximately 15 members. This brigade was formed in consequence of the Rural Fires Act 1950; an act aimed at combating bushfires.|$|E

5|$|Indonesia kept East Timor {{shut off}} from the rest of the world, except for a <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>in</b> the late 1980s and early 1990s, {{claiming}} that the vast majority of East Timorese supported integration. This position was followed closely by the Indonesian media such that an East Timorese acceptance of their integration with Indonesia was taken for granted by, and was a non-issue for, the majority of Indonesians. East Timor came to be seen as a training ground for the officer corps in tactics of suppression for Aceh and Papua, and was pivotal in ensuring military sector dominance of Indonesia.|$|E

5|$|Kesler {{is known}} as a two-way forward, capable of {{contributing}} both offensively and defensively. In his first <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>in</b> the NHL, he established his role as a shutdown forward, playing on the penalty kill and against opposing teams' top players. He also earned a reputation as an agitator, trash-talking and engaging opponents physically in between play. During the 2008–09 season, Kesler began adding a more offensive component to his game and was moved up to the Canucks' second line from third. With an increased points total, he earned league recognition with his first Selke Trophy nomination as the NHL's best defensive forward. He has since continued to improve his offensive skills while remaining defensively responsible.|$|E
5|$|Lody {{was further}} memorialised in 1937 when the newly {{launched}} destroyer Z10 was christened Hans Lody. Other {{ships in the}} same class were also given the names of German officers who had died in action.

After a <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>in</b> Royal Navy service she was scrapped in Sunderland in 1949.|$|E

After his discharge, he worked as a brakeman for a local railroad for the next <b>few</b> <b>years.</b> <b>In</b> late 1904, the Detroit Tigers intended to sign Neuer to a contract. However, nothing came of it and he never played a game with the organization.|$|E

5|$|Sir Francis and {{his wife}} were Protestants. In 1556 they went to Frankfurt in Germany to escape {{religious}} persecution under Queen Mary I, taking five of their children with them. It is unknown whether Lettice was among them, and she may have passed the next <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>in</b> the household of Princess Elizabeth with whom the family had a close relationship since the mid-1540s. They returned to England in January 1559, two months after Elizabeth I's succession. Francis Knollys was appointed Vice-Chamberlain of the Royal Household; Lady Knollys became a senior Lady of the Bedchamber, and her daughter Lettice a Maid of the Privy Chamber.|$|E
5|$|The most {{acclaimed}} of the neo-noirs {{of the era}} {{was director}} Roman Polanski's 1974 Chinatown. Written by Robert Towne, it is set in 1930s Los Angeles, an accustomed noir locale nudged back some <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>in</b> {{a way that makes}} the pivotal loss of innocence in the story even crueler. Where Polanski and Towne raised noir to a black apogee by turning rearward, director Martin Scorsese and screenwriter Paul Schrader brought the noir attitude crashing into the present day with Taxi Driver (1976), a crackling, bloody-minded gloss on bicentennial America. In 1978, Walter Hill wrote and directed The Driver, a chase film as might have been imagined by Jean-Pierre Melville in an especially abstract mood.|$|E

5|$|Disturbance is {{important}} in the creation of biodiverse habitats. In the absence of disturbance, a climax vegetation cover develops that prevents the establishment of other species. Wildflower meadows are sometimes created by conservationists but most of the flowering plants used are either annuals or biennials and disappear after a <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>in</b> the absence of patches of bare ground on which their seedlings can grow. Lightning strikes and toppled trees in tropical forests allow species richness to be maintained as pioneering species move in to fill the gaps created. Similarly coastal habitats can become dominated by kelp until the seabed is disturbed by a storm and the algae swept away, or shifting sediment exposes new areas for colonisation. Another cause of disturbance is when an area may be overwhelmed by an invasive introduced species which is not kept under control by natural enemies in its new habitat.|$|E
5|$|Following the 1911 exhibition, at the {{personal}} request of Sir George White, Coandă {{moved to the}} United Kingdom {{to take a position}} as chief engineer or chief designer at British and Colonial Aeroplane Company for a <b>few</b> <b>years.</b> <b>In</b> the next four decades Coandă worked on a great variety of inventions. During World War II he revived his earlier turbo-propulseur engine when he was contracted by the German Army in late 1942 to develop an air propulsion system for military ambulance snow sledges much like the one made for the Russian Grand Duke. The German contract concluded after one year, yielding no plans for production. Though Coandă had experimented with a variety of nozzles, and said that he had achieved a degree of success, no turbojet-engine-style fuel injection or combustion in the air stream was attempted.|$|E
5|$|Hafizullah Amin (Pashto/; born 1 August 1929 – 27 December 1979) was an Afghan {{politician}} {{during the}} Cold War. Amin {{was born in}} Paghman and educated at Kabul University, after which he started {{his career as a}} teacher. After a <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>in</b> that occupation, he went to the United States to study. He would visit the United States a second time before moving permanently to Afghanistan, and starting his career in radical politics. He ran as a candidate in the 1965 parliamentary election but failed to secure a seat. Amin was the only Khalqist elected to parliament in the 1969 parliamentary election, thus increasing his standing within the party. He was one of the leading organisers of the Saur Revolution which overthrew the government of Mohammad Daoud Khan.|$|E

5|$|Ifs {{new owner}} was Robert Guinn, of Galaxy Publishing. The change of {{ownership}} was abrupt {{and led to a}} delay in publication, with the first issue under new editorship not appearing until July 1959. The editor was Horace Gold, who was also the editor of Galaxy Science Fiction; Galaxy had gone from a monthly to a bimonthly schedule at the start of 1959, and If and Galaxy appeared in alternate months for the next <b>few</b> <b>years.</b> <b>In</b> a 1975 retrospective article, Gold commented that his policy with If was to experiment, using new writers who had not yet established themselves. In the judgement of science-fiction historian Mike Ashley, the effect was that If became the weaker of the two magazines, printing stories that were of lower quality than those Gold selected for Galaxy.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, {{he began}} his comedy career by {{following}} up on a suggestion by David Lawrence (a disc jockey friend who had been paying Drew to write jokes for David's radio show in Cleveland) {{to go to the}} library and borrow books on how to write jokes. The following year, after winning an open-microphone contest, he became Master of Ceremonies at the Cleveland Comedy Club. He performed at comedy clubs over the next <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>in</b> Cleveland and Los Angeles. He first came to the national eye as a comedian when he competed in the 1988 Star Search. Carey was working as a stand-up comedian when he appeared on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson in November 1991. His performance that night impressed Carson, who invited Carey to the couch next to his desk; this was considered a rare honor for any comedian. In that same year, Carey joined the 14th Annual Young Comedians Special on HBO and made his first appearance on Late Night with David Letterman. In 1994, Carey wrote his own stand-up comedy special, Drew Carey: Human Cartoon, which aired on Showtime and won a CableACE Award for Best Writing.|$|E
5|$|On {{the death}} of Rufus in 1100, Ranulf was imprisoned in the Tower of London by Rufus' {{successor}} Henry I of England. Ranulf was a convenient scapegoat for the financial extortions of Rufus' reign. He became the first prisoner {{to escape from the}} Tower and went into exile in Normandy with Rufus' and Henry's older brother Robert Curthose, the Duke of Normandy. Ranulf became a leading advisor to Robert, and assisted in his unsuccessful invasion of England, an attempt to oust Henry from the throne. The brothers reconciled, but although Ranulf was restored to office he spent the next <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>in</b> Normandy, returning only after Henry had defeated Robert at the Battle of Tinchebray. Ranulf subsequently retired from political life, with only occasional appearances in public. He remained active in ecclesiastical affairs, attending councils and working to defend the rights of his see.|$|E
