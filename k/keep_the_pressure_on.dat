This decision, to quickly attack Fevzi Pasha's Seventh Army in the Judean Hills, was to <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> this Ottoman army with the hope of capturing Jerusalem, while denying them time to complete their reorganisation, dig deep trenches or worst of all, counterattack.|$|E

500|$|Oregon's {{preferred}} offensive {{game plan}} was to play an attacking fast break style of basketball. In response, opposing teams with shorter players often played a slower-paced offense. Oregon's fast break was unique among West Coast basketball teams, who were not accustomed to facing such an offensive style. Dick said of the team's attack that [...] "We wanted to <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> (the opponent) mentally – more so than physically. Never give them a moment's rest." [...] When inbounding the ball, the Webfoots often restarted play quickly to maintain their fast pace. Hobson frequently tracked Oregon's attempted shots in both competition and practice sessions, and built the offense around his players' strengths. On defense, the team switched between zone and man-to-man styles depending on how its opponent played.|$|E
500|$|United manager Ferguson also praised Dudek's {{performance}} in the match: [...] "Their goalkeeper has won them the game, sometimes {{you just have to}} put your hands up on these occasions. Dudek has won them the cup. He deserved to be man of the match. We didn't get a break. Dudek's performance encouraged them to stay near their penalty box. In tough games like that the first goal is very important. It's a test for us. We can either accept defeat or we can fight back." [...] Captain Keane was disappointed with the defeat: [...] "The players, managers, staff are all upset but I suppose nowhere near as bad as the fans, if you don't win a match in football you feel as though you have let the fans down." [...] His focus turned to United's participation in the UEFA Champions League, as they looked to end the season with a trophy: [...] "It would have been nice {{to get a piece of}} silverware in the cabinet, especially with the opposition being Liverpool, we've just got to lick our wounds. We've got a game against Leeds on Wednesday and we'll get on with training for Wednesday. The players know we'll have to get together, get ready and try to <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> Arsenal. But we are eight points behind them, which puts them in a very strong position and again we are pinning our hopes on the European Cup, which is a dangerous game to play as we saw last season." ...|$|E

Optical networking {{has become a}} key technology in accommodating the rapidly expanding Internet traffic.

New optical networks are expected to support the increasing network load by employing both sophisticated transmission (wavelength division multiplexing division (WDM)) and switching technologies (optical switches and cross-connects). This study will explain how the hybrid nodes achieve with different network models and make it operation through innovative technical designs...|$|R
5000|$|Critical {{reaction}} to Charge!! was generally positive, with many reviewers praising The Aquabats' transition in genre. Johnny Loftus of Allmusic gave the album four stars out of five, remarking that the band had [...] "refocused its musical and ideological attack" [...] during {{the six years}} since their previous studio album: [...] "Intact are the pop references, zany in-jokes, and Batman villain fetishism...But Charge!! is much more rewarding musically. It doesn't loiter awkwardly between punk, pop, ska, and broad humor — it <b>keeps</b> <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> with a catchy guitar- and keyboard-driven blend of anthemic choruses and appropriately squawky elements." [...] A review on IGN also complimented this shift in style, writing [...] "The neo-new-wave result is superbly effective, especially considering the band's campy, Saturday-morning-cartoon feel." ...|$|R

In doing so, Ramsay {{was ordered to}} <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> the Japanese [...] while avoiding committing large-scale forces. Nevertheless, it was decided that the Australians would carry out a limited offensive, consisting largely of patrol actions, with the goal of advancing beyond the western tip of the island where the US garrison had remained. To achieve this, the Australian commanders decided to establish two bases: one around Jacquinot Bay on the southern coast, with a supporting base on the north coast around Cape Hoskins.|$|E

2500|$|After {{the fourth}} Test of their five-Test {{series against the}} West Indies in 1966, England were 3–0 down and had lost the series. Needing someone {{to come in to}} {{revitalise}} the squad, the England selectors turned to the successful Yorkshire captain, Brian Close. Close knew why he had been selected, and also why many of his men had been. At the pre-match dinner he said, [...] "I shouldn't be here if we hadn't made such a mess of the series. What's more, neither would a few of you. You are here because you are all fighters, {{and we are going to}} <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> and keep it on for five days." [...] What Close did was to engender a battling spirit for the final Test Match. So, when England were 166 for 7 in reply to the West Indies' 268 all out, they did not give up. Instead, centuries from Tom Graveney and John Murray, and half-centuries from Ken Higgs and John Snow, saw England to a score of 527. The highlight of the match was when West Indian captain Gary Sobers, who had a batting average in the series of well over 100, came in to bat at 137 for 5 with his side still 122runs from making England bat again. Close knew that Sobers was a fine hooker, and he knew how he wanted to approach him, so he asked Snow to bowl a bouncer first up. Everything went to plan: Sobers hooked, edged the ball into his body, and it rebounded to Close at his customary short leg position, close to the batsman, ready to take the catch – or a full blow to the body had Sobers middled it. Sobers c. Close, b. Snow 0 off one ball. England went on to win the game by an innings and 34 runs.|$|E
