6000|$|... "It {{is always}} useful," [...] Matteo said, [...] "to have a fast boat. It is {{invaluable}} <b>in</b> <b>case</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> been {{getting into a}} scrape, and {{have one of the}} boats of the city watch in chase of you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{you have}} seen {{a good deal of}} Vane, and, <b>in</b> <b>case</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> any hankering after his scalp, I think I'd better mention that there's reason to believe he won't be worth powder and shot before very long." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, anyhow, you're {{the first}} of them I've seen at all, and {{directly}} Jim {{told me he was}} coming to you, I made him ring up <b>in</b> <b>case</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> room for me." ...|$|R
60|$|CONSCIENCE (at last; in an acid voice): That is {{a history}} of the Peloponnesian War by Thucydides {{on the table in front}} of you. I thought I would mention it, <b>in</b> <b>case</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> forgotten.|$|R
6000|$|... 'That's unfortunate, for I am poor too; and <b>in</b> <b>case</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> had it, I'd have {{borrowed}} it of you. But if we {{told this}} landlady {{we would see}} her paid, I suppose that would answer the same purpose?' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "As far as Pangbourne. Meet {{me at the}} bookstall at 3:30. I {{shall have}} the tickets. Goodbye, Dr. Hamilton! And, by the way, {{there are two things}} which I should be very glad if you would bring with you, <b>in</b> <b>case</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> them. One is your case for {{collecting}} beetles, and the other is a stick, and the thicker and heavier the better." ...|$|E

And if any presence shall be necessary in order to complete it I will come over, though I hope it can be done without that.|$|E
40|$|Extract] <b>In</b> <b>case</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> not yet noticed, {{we are in}} {{the midst}} of an {{environmental}} revolution – one that revolves around escalating improvements in Earth Observation, open data, and the creation of new data platforms that provide remarkable linkages among disparate kinds of information. The power and potential of these new platforms is unprecedented...|$|R
6000|$|... "I thought," [...] resumed Clara, {{in rather}} lower tones than before, [...] "that I would just look into your room before I {{went to the}} ball, and see that {{everything}} was properly arranged for <b>you,</b> <b>in</b> <b>case</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> any idea of writing tonight; I had just time to do this while my aunt, who is going with me, was upstairs altering her toilette. But perhaps you don't feel inclined to write?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, <b>you</b> <b>had</b> {{better take}} your things down now,' Mr. Hawtrey broke <b>in,</b> 'in <b>case</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to lie down. There {{seems to be}} a fresh wind blowing outside.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Dear Mother,--I write again <b>in</b> <b>case</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> not {{received}} my letters. [...] To-day I {{go into the}} Morea, which will, I trust, be colder than this [...] place, where I have tarried in the expectation of obtaining rest. [...] Sligo has very kindly proposed a union of our forces for the occasion, [...] which will be perhaps as uncomfortable to him as to myself, judging [...] from previous experience, which, however, {{may be explained by}} my own [...] irritability and hurry.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing whatever," [...] she {{answered}} promptly. [...] "How I {{should like to}} tell you everything! But I have made a solemn promise, and I must keep it. My lips are sealed. But one thing I should like you to understand, <b>in</b> <b>case</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> ever had any doubt about it. Mr. Sabin is really my uncle, my mother's brother. He is engaged in a great enterprise in which I am a necessary figure. He has suddenly become very much afraid of you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Although she {{carefully}} confined herself to commonplace expressions of sympathy, I {{could see that}} it was equally a relief to both of us to feel that we were prevented from being traveling companions. Don't suppose that I have taken a capricious dislike to Mrs. Rook--or that you are in any way to blame for the unfavorable impression which she has produced on me. I will make this plain when we meet. In the meanwhile, I need only tell you that I gave her a letter of explanation to present to Sir Jervis Redwood. I also informed him of my address in London: adding a request that he would forward your letter, <b>in</b> <b>case</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> written to me before you receive these lines.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing so dire as that, I believe. But if you've made me {{question}} {{the propriety of}} applying the blessing <b>in</b> all <b>cases,</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{done a very good}} thing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Trust your instinct," [...] I advised her. [...] "Most women {{trust to}} that, {{and make no}} worse {{mistakes}} than men. <b>In</b> this <b>case</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> your brother's letter to help you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, indeed, sir!' said Mr Cheggs. 'I'm {{glad to hear}} it. You {{know where}} I'm to be found, I suppose, sir, <b>in</b> <b>case</b> <b>you</b> should <b>have</b> {{anything}} to say to me?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I {{left you}} in better hands, Miss Yerba; {{and let me}} thank you now," [...] he added in a lower tone, [...] "for {{recognizing}} it as you did a moment ago. I'm glad that you instinctively liked Colonel Pendleton. Had you known him better, you would have seen how truthful that instinct was. His chief fault {{in the eyes of}} our worthy friends is that he reminds them of a great deal they can't perpetuate and much they would like to forget." [...] He checked himself abruptly. [...] "But here is your letter," [...] he resumed, drawing Colonel Pendleton's missive from his pocket, [...] "perhaps you would like to read it now, <b>in</b> <b>case</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> any message to return by me. Miss Woods and I will excuse you." ...|$|E
60|$|Finding Jo Candy so obstinate, Queen Ann let {{him have}} his own way and {{continued}} her journey {{to the house of}} the eighteenth and last man in Oogaboo, who was a young fellow named Jo Files. This Files had twelve trees which bore steel files of various sorts; but also he had nine book-trees, on which grew a choice selection of story-books. <b>In</b> <b>case</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> never seen books growing upon trees, I will explain that those in Jo Files' orchard were enclosed in broad green husks which, when fully ripe, turned to a deep red color. Then the books were picked and husked and were ready to read. If they were picked too soon, the stories were found to be confused and uninteresting and the spelling bad. However, if allowed to ripen perfectly, the stories were fine reading and the spelling and grammar excellent.|$|E
6000|$|... 20. <b>In</b> <b>case</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> not a forenoon to spare, nor {{eyesight}} to waste, {{this much}} of merely necessary abstract must serve you,--that from the Drachenfels and its six brother felsen, eastward, trending to the north, there runs and spreads a straggling company of gnarled and mysterious craglets, jutting and scowling above glens fringed by coppice, and fretful or musical with stream; the crags, in pious ages, mostly castled, for distantly or fancifully Christian purposes;--the glens, resonant of woodmen, or burrowed {{at the sides}} by miners, and invisibly tenanted farther, underground, by gnomes, and above by forest and other demons. The entire district, clasping crag to crag, and guiding dell to dell, some hundred and fifty miles (with intervals) between the Dragon mountain above Rhine, and the Rosin mountain, 'Hartz' shadowy still {{to the south of}} the riding grounds of Black Brunswickers of indisputable bodily presence;--shadowy anciently with 'Hercynian' (hedge, or fence) forest, corrupted or coinciding into Hartz, or Rosin forest, haunted by obscurely apparent foresters of at least resinous, not to say sulphurous, extraction.|$|E

6000|$|... “Yes,” said Appleby, who hid his astonishment by an effort. “Still, <b>in</b> this <b>case</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{not been}} as wise as usual, Don Maccario. There are men who become more obdurate {{when you try to}} intimidate them. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> already heard my decision.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The Indians are out again," [...] Mr. Welch said, [...] "and in force. They have massacred the Brents and {{are making}} toward the settlements. They may {{come this way}} or they may not; at any rate, we must be {{prepared}} for them. Get the beasts into the sheds, and then do you all take scythes and set to work to cut down that patch of corn, which is high enough to give them shelter; there's nothing else which will cover them within a hundred yards of the house. Of course you will take your rifles with you and keep a sharp lookout; but they will have heard the bell, {{if they are in}} the neighborhood, and will guess that we are on the alert, so they are not likely to attempt a surprise. Shut one of the gates and leave the other ajar, with the bar handy to put up <b>in</b> <b>case</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to make a run for it. Harold will go up to the lookout while you are at work." ...|$|E
6000|$|Now, my dear gamekeeper, I {{must really}} draw to a close. For I have {{much else to}} write before the mail goes out three days hence. [...] Fanny being asleep, {{it would not be}} {{conscientious}} to invent a message from her, so you must just imagine her sentiments. I find I have not the heart to speak of your recent loss. You remember perhaps, when my father died, you told me those ugly images of sickness, decline, and impaired reason, which then haunted me day and night, would pass away and be succeeded by things more happily characteristic.

60|$|I think so. If I {{may make}} a {{suggestion}} without seeming {{to be trying to}} teach my grandmother to suck eggs, I will offer it. In our days we have learned the value of combination. We apply it everywhere--in railway systems, in trusts, in trade unions, in Salvation Armies, in minor politics, in major politics, in European Concerts. Whatever our strength may be, big or little, we organise it. We have found out that that {{is the only way to}} get the most out of it that is in it. We know the weakness of individual sticks, and the strength of the concentrated faggot. Suppose you try a scheme like this, for instance. In England and America put every Jew on the census-book as a Jew (<b>in</b> <b>case</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> not been doing that). Get up volunteer regiments composed of Jews solely, and when the drum beats, fall in and go to the front, so as to remove the reproach that you have few Massenas among you, and that you feed on a country but don't like to fight for it. Next, in politics, organise your strength, band together, and deliver the casting-vote where you can, and, where you can't, compel as good terms as possible. You huddle to yourselves already in all countries, but you huddle to no sufficient purpose, politically speaking. You do not seem to be organised, except for your charities. There you are omnipotent; there you compel your due of recognition--you do not have to beg for it. It shows what you can do when you band together for a definite purpose.|$|E
