It is necessary to realize detection and classification processes and systems for water quality analysis. The important direction is to lead to uncomplicated understanding for public utilization. This paper presents the river Sensing Processing Actuation processes (rSPA) for determination and classification of multiple-water- parameters in Chaophraya river. According to rSPA processes of multiple-water-quality-parameters, we find the pollutants of conductivity, salinity and total dissolved solid (TDS), which are accumulated from upstream to downstream. In several spots of the river, we have analyzed water quality in a maximum value <b>of</b> pollutants <b>in</b> <b>term</b> <b>of</b> oxidation-reduction potential (ORP).

The background of study {{is the importance of}} a good textbook for a guide in teaching and learning process and reading exercises are one of the content of textbook to improve the students’ skill. The study is aimed at responding the following questions; (1) To which extent of reading exercises in :Developing English Competencies 1 ” an English textbook for Senior High School Grade X Published by pusat perbukuan Departement Pendidikan Nasional. are relevant with KTSP?, (2) what types of reading exercises are employed in “Developing English Competencies 1 ”?. The topic is discussed through library research. The reading exercises in “Developing English Competencies 1 ” are used as data. The data gathered by reading, identification, classification, simplification and analysis. All data then analyzed by using evaluating textbook (content analysis). The result of analysis reveals that <b>in</b> <b>term</b> <b>of</b> aim of exercise, the Reading Exercises are sufficient enough to improve the students’ ability in reading skill. <b>In</b> the <b>term</b> <b>of</b> type of texts, all reading exercises are based on type <b>of</b> reading exercises. <b>In</b> <b>term</b> <b>of</b> relevance with KTSP Curriculum, the exercises of textbook do not cover all reading materials demanded in Curriculum, but there are two materials that are not in the textbook. <b>In</b> <b>term</b> <b>of</b> type of reading exercise, all type of reading exercises are covered in the textbook.

In this paper, we propose a novel detection scheme for MIMO based transmission that combines the adaptive MMSE [1] detection scheme with a priori information and parallel interference cancellation (PIC) in the spatial domain. Simulation results show interesting gain <b>in</b> <b>term</b> <b>of</b> BER performance and also <b>in</b> <b>term</b> <b>of</b> complexity because the BER performance can be adapted in function of the number of iteration that we set-up for the adaptive MMSE detection.
