25|$|The sulfate {{minerals}} all {{contain the}} sulfate anion, 2−. They {{tend to be}} transparent to translucent, soft, and many are fragile. Sulfate minerals commonly form as evaporites, where they precipitate out of evaporating saline waters; alternative, sulfates {{can also be found}} in hydrothermal vein systems associated with sulfides, or as oxidation products of sulfides. Sulfates can be subdivided into anhydrous and hydrous minerals. The most common hydrous sulfate by far is gypsum, CaSO4⋅2H2O. It forms as an evaporite, and is associated with other evaporites such as calcite and halite; if it incorporates sand grains as it crystallizes, gypsum can form <b>desert</b> <b>roses.</b> Gypsum has very low thermal conductivity and maintains a low temperature when heated as it loses that heat by dehydrating; as such, gypsum is used as an insulator in materials such as plaster and drywall. The anhydrous equivalent of gypsum is anhydrite; it can form directly from seawater in highly arid conditions. The barite group has the general formula XSO4, where the X is a large 12-coordinated cation. Examples include barite (BaSO4), celestine (SrSO4), and anglesite (PbSO4); anhydrite {{is not part of the}} barite group, as the smaller Ca2+ is only in eight-fold coordination.|$|E

During the early {{parts of the}} Jurassic, which lasted from approximately 210 million years ago until about 144 million years ago, the area was almost certainly extremely arid as {{is evidenced by the}} great sandstones of the region and the many dune and desert structures - such as <b>desert</b> <b>roses</b> - that are found preserved within the rocks of the region. In these sediments have been found the remains of early dinosaurs - possibly those of a species known as Massospondylus. It was also clearly a period of intense volcanism - with intrusive igneous rocks representing the ejected and intrusive molten matter from the interior of the Earth scattered about the region. The Jurassic was the age of great plant eating sauropods and smaller, carnivorous dinosaurs. This was the age of the origin of vertebrate flight with pterosaurs - flying dinosaurs - and the first birds appearing. The oceans themselves were full {{of a wide variety of}} life including many different types of fish, squids and ammonites - fossils of which are plentiful in the slightly younger rocks of the coastal regions to the southeast of the area.
