25|$|On 29 October 1917, Leutnant der Reserve Heinrich Gontermann, Staffelführer of Jasta 15, was {{performing}} aerobatics when his triplane broke up. Gontermann was fatally {{injured in the}} ensuing crash landing. Leutnant der Reserve Günther Pastor of Jasta 11 was killed two days later when his triplane broke up in level <b>flight.</b> <b>Inspection</b> of the wrecked aircraft showed that the wings had been poorly constructed. Examination of other high-time triplanes confirmed these findings. On 2 November, Idflieg grounded all remaining triplanes pending an inquiry. Idflieg convened a Sturzkommission (crash commission) which concluded that poor construction and lack of waterproofing had allowed moisture to damage the wing structure. This caused the wing ribs to disintegrate and the ailerons to break away in flight.|$|E

In November 1949, he became head of <b>flight</b> <b>inspection</b> and deputy chief of polar aviation. Mazuruk participated in the 1950 Sever-5 drift station expedition and in the 1951 evacuation of North Pole-2 drift station. He retired from active duty in February 1953 and worked for the Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute. Mazuruk participated in the 1954 Sever-6, 1955 Sever-7, 1959 Sever-11, 1960 Sever-12, and 1961 Sever-13 drift station expeditions. He made over 254 flights to polar research stations, including the first landing of an Antonov An-2 aircraft in Antarctica in January 1956 during the 1st Soviet Antarctic Expedition in 1956. Mazuruk lived in Moscow. He died on 2 January 1989 and {{was buried in the}} Troyekurovskoye Cemetery.|$|E
25|$|The Convair {{was sold}} in 1976 and {{replaced}} by a used Hawker Siddeley HS 748 from Varig which was dedicated for navaid <b>flight</b> <b>inspection</b> and calibration for the CAA. The Falcons were sold to the RNoAF, the last being handed over in 1978, although FOF retained a contract to conduct heavy maintenance on them. The Electras were mostly used for charter flights for SAS, although they were also used to an extent on charter flights, particularly hauling of flowers from Genova and flights to Greenland. SAS gradually established its own network of cargo routes, reducing the amount subcontracted to Fred. Olsen. In the end SAS launched the Air de Cologne (AdC) concept, and one of Fred. Olsen's aircraft were painted in the black livery. SAS discontinued its freight-only flights in 1988, and FOS lost most of its business. AdC was sold to TNT, and FOF was able to secure freight contracts with it and KLM.|$|E

The frequency of landmark inspections is highest when the ant is close to the feeder and falls as the ant moves away.

50|$|The Air Force Flight Standards Agency (AFFSA) {{operates}} as a U.S. Air Force Field Operating Agency operating {{under the direction of}} the Headquarters of the U.S. Air Force. AFFSA maximizes the effectiveness of Air Force global air operations by ensuring access to worldwide airspace in all weather conditions. The agency does this by providing accurate, relevant, and timely flight information and support services to Department of Defense, national, and coalition aviators. It also acts as lead command for the creation and application of criteria, procedures, and precision equipment for worldwide instrument flight operations, air traffic control, airfield management, and air traffic control and landing systems for the Air Force. AFFSA evaluates and capitalizes on emerging technologies to ensure unrestricted access to domestic and international airspace. It partners with Federal Aviation Administration, sister services, major commands, coalition partners, and host nations to maintain the consistency and accuracy of more than 81 airfields, 1,092 navigation systems and 8,214 instrument approach procedures worldwide. It performs combat <b>flight</b> <b>inspections,</b> oversees the Air Force airfield operations standardization program and instructs the Air Force Advanced Instrument School.|$|R

The Transponder Landing System (TLS) non-traditional PAR can transmit an ILS signal that corresponds to the aircraft position relative to the precision approach.
