A solution of 0. 01 M CaCl 2, containing a tracer (bromide) and oxadixyl was sprayed onto the surface of the soil column, and then simulated rainfall was applied at an intensity of 0. 034 cm h- 1.

40|$|Multiple {{sampling}} {{is widely}} used in vadose zone percolation experiments to investigate the extent in which soil structure heterogeneities influence the spatial and temporal distributions of water and solutes. In this note, a simple, robust, mathematical model, based on the beta-statistical distribution, is proposed {{as a method of}} quantifying the magnitude of heterogeneity in such experiments. The model relies on fitting two parameters, alpha and zeta to the cumulative <b>elution</b> <b>curves</b> generated in multiple-sample percolation experiments. The model does not require knowledge of the soil structure. A homogeneous or uniform distribution of a solute and/or soil-water is indicated by alpha = zeta = 1, Using these parameters, a heterogeneity index (HI) is defined as root 3 times the ratio of the standard deviation and mean. Uniform or homogeneous flow of water or solutes is indicated by HI = 1 and heterogeneity is indicated by HI > 1. A large value for this index may indicate preferential flow. The heterogeneity index relies only on knowledge of the <b>elution</b> <b>curves</b> generated from multiple sample percolation experiments and is, therefore, easily calculated. The index may also be used to describe and compare the differences in solute and soil-water percolation from different experiments. The use of this index is discussed for several different leaching experiments. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Determination of the {{magnitude}} and location of pre-glomerular oxygen shunting is critical in understanding its role in renal hypoxia. Unfortunately, experimental studies {{have been unable to}} quantify {{the magnitude}} and location of pre-glomerular oxygen shunting. Computational models could theoretically fill this void by providing quantitative information related to renal oxygen shunting. However, their use is limited by uncertainty in model parameters. In this study we show the benefits of integrating oxygen pulse experiments with computational models of oxygen transport to quantitatively analyze oxygen shunting. The method involves injecting an oxygen pulse of known shape into the renal artery and monitoring the oxygen concentration profile at the renal vein exit. The shape and timing of the venous oxygen <b>elution</b> <b>curve</b> indicates the magnitude and location of oxygen shunting along the renal vasculature. Here, we developed a transient computational model for oxygen transport in pre-glomerular vasculature simulating the above experimental protocol.

40|$|AbstractThe NBD-PE/Rd-PE {{fluorescent}} membrane fusion assay {{was used}} to measure the pH dependence and kinetics of the fusion activity of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus with liposomes designed to mimic the composition of the endosomal membrane. Fusion activity was only observed at pH values less than 6. 3 and showed a greater rate and extent at lower pH values. Pronounced kinetic fusion curves were observed at pH values below 5. 8. When equivalent lipid amounts of target liposomes and virus were mixed at pH 5. 3 the dequenching activity had a t 1 / 2 of 45 ± 10 sec. In addition to catalyzing membrane fusion after acidification the glycoprotein complex was previously found to undergo conformational change (C. Di Simone, M. A. Zandonatti, and M. J. Buchmeier, 1994, Virology 198, 455 - 465), including loss of the GP- 1 polypeptide from the virion surface. The pH dependence and kinetics of this acid-induced GP- 1 release were quantitated using centrifugal separation of solubilized GP- 1 from pelleted virions. A pH-dependent <b>elution</b> <b>curve</b> was determined with progressively more GP- 1 released at pH values below 6. 3 and reaching nearly 100 % dissociation at pH 5. 5 after 30 min at 37 °.

40|$|Some {{applications}} of convective-dispersive (CD) model and MIM model (which compartmentalizes the liquid {{phase in the}} two mobile and immobile domains) are presented using experimental data obtained in a laboratory study. An initial series of tests on undisturbed, unsaturated soil samples of different texture, conducted with TDR-associated hydrodynamic techniques, demonstrated the reliability of CD model which, when implemented with the least squares method, produces a sufficiently precise space-time distribution of chlorine anion concentrations. However, to reduce some significant discrepancies among the <b>elution</b> <b>curves</b> calculated and measured on the same soils brought to maximum water content values {{it was necessary to}} use a more sophisticated version of the CD model, represented by the MIM model...|$|R
40|$|The mode of the {{chromatogram}} {{is inadequate}} for characterizing experimental <b>elution</b> <b>curves,</b> which are generally dissymmetrical. It is also dependent on axial diffusion. When the {{molecular weight distribution}} is defined either by the generalized exponential function or by the log-normal function, simulation of elution at finite resolution shows that the calibration curve at infinite resolution, independent of the flow rate of the carrier fluid, is approximated validly by correlating the first moment of the chromatogram (MEV) with the geometrical compound average (M ̄n M ̄w) 1 2 = M 0. The concentration effect seems {{to be controlled by}} a double extrapolation procedure defined by (1) treatment of the chromatograms using the calibration curve at zero concentration (InM 0 versus lim c→o MEV), and (2) linear extrapolation to infinite dilution of the calculated molecular weight averages. © 1980.
