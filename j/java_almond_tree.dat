[...] The rendering of <b>Almond</b> <b>Tree</b> in Blossom is positioned close and accessible to the viewer, and the branches appear to extend beyond the painting's frame. A yellow butterfly flits among the pink blossoms growing on the red branches. The subject is reminiscent of an earlier painting which Van Gogh made in Paris depicting flowering trees.|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} study, {{chemical}} composition and in situ rumen dry matter degradability (DMD) of some tree species (cherry, apricot and <b>almond</b> <b>tree</b> leaves) were determined. Crude protein (CP) concentration varied from 6. 76 % for <b>almond</b> <b>tree</b> to 2. 76 % for cherry tree, {{neutral detergent fiber}} (NDF) and acid detergent fiber (ADF), from 29. 2, 20. 8 % for apricot tree to 20. 8 and 15. 8 % for <b>almond</b> <b>tree</b> leaves respectively. Polyphenol and tannin composition measured from 3. 49, 1. 2 % for <b>almond</b> <b>tree</b> to 1. 51 and 0. 61 % for apricot tree, respectively. In situ rumen degradability {{was carried out in}} three fistulaed Taleshi native male cattle which were incubated at times of 0, 4, 8, 16, 24, 48, 72 and 96 -hour. Almond leaves had higher potential degradation (a+b) for dry matter (92. 37 %) and cherry leaves showed lower potential degradation (84. 12 %), respectively. Effective rumen degradable dry matter at rate of 0. 05 /h varied from 69. 86 % for <b>almond</b> <b>tree</b> to 52. 20 % for cherry leaves. Results showed that the almond leaves were higher in nutritive value than cherry and apricot leaves. Therefore, <b>almond</b> <b>tree</b> leaves could be used with forage in ruminant diets to reduce cost of animals feed requirements. Overall, it seemed that the tree leaves used in this study, had a higher nutritive value in ruminant’s nutrition, however more experiments are needed for an accurate determination of nutritional values of these resources...|$|R
