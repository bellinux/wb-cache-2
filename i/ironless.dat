As the axial flux machine {{can easily be}} constructed with a multi-rotor configuration, it is well suited for <b>ironless</b> stator design, which has gained interest in the latest years due {{to the development of}} high remanent flux density permanent magnets. In addition to the reduced eddy current losses and weight of the stator itself, an <b>ironless</b> design eliminates the magnetic forces acting on the stator, so that the necessity of a heavy stator frame is reduced. Several winding topologies exist for <b>ironless</b> stators, and it can be interesting to compare these with each other.

40|$|Sensorless {{control of}} PMSM's (Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors) has {{occupied}} scientists {{for a long}} time. The result {{of this research is}} becoming widely accepted by the industry due to its low cost and reliability. However, the majority of today's motor drives are still equipped with some kind of position sensor. The reason is that sensorless control still have several limitations and is usually more complex than a traditional motor control. A new method to estimate the standstill position of PMSM's is presented. The method is based on the anisotropic properties of permanent magnets and is therefore referred to as MAM (Magnetic Anisotropy Method). The proposed method is independent of any ferromagnetic material and can therefore be used in many types of <b>ironless</b> PMSM's where standard methods fail. The MAM method is tested on a linear <b>ironless</b> motor, and measurement results from a "stripped" rotative motor without any supporting ferromagnetic material are also presented. Furthermore, it is shown in this thesis how Extended Kalman filters can be used to estimate the rotor position, and especially how the robustness and dynamic response of the overall control algorithm can be improved by using identification experiments and optimization algorithms. Some basic modelling of PMSM's are also presented. The modelling process is focused on techniques which are suitable for observers such as Extended Kalman filters. To show the versatility of the method, experimental results from two different motor types are presented. The first is a linear <b>ironless</b> motor while the second is a Hybrid Stepper Motor (HSM).

This three-dimensional analytical approach {{is based on the}} exact calculation of the magnetic field components created by ring permanent magnets whose polarizations are either radial or axial. We assume that the ferromagnetic particles of the ferrofluid are saturated. Moreover, the permanent magnets (Neodymium Iron Boron) used in the considered applications create a magnetic field which is much higher than the magnetic field created by the magnetic particles in the ferrofluid so the latter is neglected. Nevertheless, the static behavior of the ferrofluid seal depends on both the magnetic field produced by the permanent magnets and the saturation magnetization of the ferrofluid particles. Furthermore, the accurate knowledge of the ferrofluid seal shape as well as the magnetic pressure inside the ferrofluid seal is very useful for the design of devices using both permanent magnets and ferrofluid seals. It is emphasized here that our structures are completely <b>ironless</b> and thus, there are no iron-base piston for these structures.

40|$|The {{advanced}} technology of today {{has reduced the}} need of testing medical equipment on human patients. The invention of the lung simulator {{has made it possible}} to test ventilators without putting the condition of test patients in jeopardy. The device also allows medical staff to be trained in a safe and more rapid way. Several types of lung simulators are available. The digitally controlled variant is the most versatile one for simulations. This type has easily adjustable static and dynamic properties, which, in contrary to traditional passive mechanical simulators, make it possible to simulate different types of breathing. The available design of a digitally controlled lung simulator, however, has one major drawback. The system uses a motor-ball screw assembly to drive a piston in the air compartment. One of the properties of this assembly is that the motor shaft motion is negligibly affected (not ‘backdrivable’) by air pressure exerted on the piston by an external source. The result of this is a feedback system that needs to realize the entire dynamic response to pressure changes, by active control of the motor. Because of this, the system can easily become unstable for certain settings of the static and dynamic properties. The objective of this thesis is to determine what the best alternative actuator is for the lung simulator, to the end of making it more stable than the current version. By improving the existing lung simulator and improving its range of operation, and its performance, it can be made more effective and accurate, which will result in better healthcare. To reach this goal, firstly the desired requirements for the lung simulator will be obtained from the end user. After this, a literature study about alternative actuators shall be conducted. With the results of the literature study, a ranking of the alternative actuators are determined. From the literature study eight alternative actuators have come up. These are the moving coil actuator, moving iron actuator, permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM), <b>ironless</b> core motor, piezoelectric actuator, pneumatic actuator, hydraulic actuator and wax motor. The most important requirements on which the different actuators are evaluated are backdrivability, force linearity, force, precision, speed and stroke length. Of the eight alternative actuators, except for the PMSM and the <b>ironless</b> core actuator, all the others have an insufficient score on {{one or more of the}} requirements. A comparison of the PMSM and the <b>ironless</b> core actuator shows that the backdrivability of the <b>ironless</b> core actuator is better, and that it has the best overall score. The conclusion is that the <b>ironless</b> core actuator is the most suitable alternative for the lung simulator. The use of the actuator should increase the stability of the lung simulator. However, no testing was possible because of malfunctioning hardware and time shortage. Therefore no practical confirmation could be obtained about the effects of the new actuator on the system. It is recommended to put the top-ranked actuators to the test in a prototype. From the test results it will be possible to confirm whether the instability of the original lung simulator was indeed caused by the actuator, and whether the <b>ironless</b> core motor is indeed the best suitable alternative actuator for the lung simulator.

A recently proposed technique termed the 'equal inductance method' offers commutation control and starting performance equal to that obtained when using Hall sensors.
