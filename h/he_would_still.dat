5|$|Beato, who {{had covered}} {{military}} operations in India and China, was probably attracted by {{the news of the}} annexation. While he arrived in Burma after the main military operations ended, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>still</b> get {{to see more of the}} action, as the annexation by the British led to an insurgency which lasted for the following decade. This allowed Beato to take a number of pictures of British military in operations or at the Royal Palace, Mandalay, as well as insurgency soldiers and prisoners.|$|E
5|$|The revised meeting date of 16 August, however, {{coincided with}} {{his visit to}} the horse races at York, a fashionable event at which Byng had entries in two races. He once again wrote to the Home Office, saying that {{although}} <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>still</b> be prepared to be in command in Manchester {{on the day of the}} meeting if it was thought really necessary, he had absolute confidence in his deputy commander, Lieutenant Colonel Guy L'Estrange.|$|E

5|$|Besides his two Emmy Awards and six Annie Awards for SpongeBob SquarePants, Hillenburg {{has also}} {{received}} other recognition, {{such as an}} accolade from Heal the Bay for his efforts on elevating marine life awareness, and the Television Animation Award from the National Cartoonists Society. Despite this, he {{has been involved in}} public controversies, including one that was centered on speculation over the SpongeBob character's intended sexual orientation, and a lawsuit that was filed against him. Hillenburg has been diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in 2017, but stated that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>still</b> continue to work on his show.|$|E
5|$|For instance, {{if he had}} 100,000 strings {{worth of}} gold and silver and used this money to buy {{productive}} property, in a year he would gain 10,000 strings; after ten years or so, he would have regained the 100,000 strings {{and what would be}} divided among the family would be interest. If it were invested in a pawn broking business, in three years the interest would equal the capital. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> <b>still</b> have the 100,000 strings, and the rest, being interest, could be divided. Moreover, it could be doubled again in another three years, ad infinitum.|$|E
5|$|Castellaneta started acting {{after his}} {{graduation}} from Northern Illinois University in 1979. He {{decided that if}} his career went nowhere <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>still</b> {{have a chance to}} try something else. He began taking improvisation classes, where he met his future wife Deb Lacusta. Castellaneta started to work at The Second City, an improvisational theatre in Chicago, in 1983 and continued to work there until 1987. During this period, he did voice-over work with his wife for various radio stations. He auditioned for a role in The Tracey Ullman Show and his first meeting underwhelmed Tracey Ullman and the other producers. Ullman decided to fly to Chicago to watch Castellaneta perform. His performance that night was about a blind man who tries to become a comedian and Ullman later recalled that although there were flashier performances that night, Castellaneta made her cry. She was impressed and Castellaneta was hired.|$|E

5|$|In late April {{there were}} reports that Orme had a sore throat. This caused Orme to drift in the betting for the Derby, and La Fleche became the favourite. Orme was {{withdrawn}} from the 2000 Guineas, but returned to doing gentle exercise and it was hoped that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>still</b> {{be able to make the}} Derby. The Duke of Westminster hinted that he had been poisoned. In early May, Orme had still not improved, and connections stated that he had been poisoned with mercury. It was suspected that the culprit may have been a well-known backer of Derby rival La Fleche, with the poison being administered in a lozenge that Orme chewed, blistering his tongue. However, a dentist that removed part of a decayed tooth from Orme suggested that the illness was not due to poisoning, but to the decayed tooth.|$|E
5|$|On July 12, 2011, Paul {{announced}} that he would forgo seeking another term in Congress in order to focus on his presidential bid. On May 14, 2012, Paul {{announced that}} he would not be competing in any other presidential primaries but that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>still</b> compete for delegates in states where the primary elections have already been held. At the 2012 Republican National Convention, Paul received 190 delegate votes. In January 2013, Paul retired from Congress but still remains active on college campuses, giving speeches promoting his libertarian vision. Paul received one electoral vote from a Texas faithless elector in the 2016 presidential election, making him the oldest person to receive an electoral vote, as well as the second registered Libertarian Presidential candidate in history to receive an Electoral College vote after John Hospers.|$|E
5|$|In Major League Baseball, the 300win club is {{the group}} of {{pitchers}} who have won 300 or more games. Twenty-four pitchers have reached this milestone. The New York Gothams/Giants/San Francisco Giants are the only franchise to see four players reach the milestone while on their roster: those players are Tim Keefe, Mickey Welch, Christy Mathewson, and Randy Johnson. Early {{in the history of}} professional baseball, many of the rules favored the pitcher over the batter; the distance pitchers threw to home plate was shorter than today, and pitchers were able to use foreign substances to alter the direction of the ball. The first player to win 300games was Pud Galvin in 1888. Seven pitchers recorded all or the majority of their career wins in the 19thcentury: Galvin, Cy Young, Kid Nichols, Tim Keefe, John Clarkson, Charley Radbourn, and Mickey Welch. Four more pitchers joined the club {{in the first quarter of}} the 20thcentury: Christy Mathewson, Walter Johnson, Eddie Plank, and Grover Cleveland Alexander. Young is the all-time leader in wins with 511, a mark that is considered unbreakable. If a modern-day pitcher won 20 games per season for 25 seasons, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>still</b> be 11 games short of Young's mark.|$|E
60|$|The {{landlord}} bade him enter. He did {{not know}} whether Monsieur Rabecque would forgive him for being disturbed; he could not say whether Monsieur Rabecque would consent to see this visitor at such an hour; very probably <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not. <b>Still,</b> monsieur might enter.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>would,</b> however, <b>still</b> {{make the}} last effort {{for the whole}} stake.

50|$|In {{the first}} year, JJ Pryor Jr {{supposedly}} attended Lehigh University {{on a football}} scholarship in 1963 but joined the Marines when injured to pay for college.

2500|$|There was a {{sense that}} Paul Buckle was {{clearing}} the decks in time for the January transfer window.

25|$|Westinghouse {{was after}} a {{perpetual}} motion machine, and the British physicist Lord Kelvin, one of Westinghouse's correspondents, {{told him that he}} would be violating the laws of thermodynamics.

25|$|Carolina {{suffered}} a major setback when Thomas Davis, an 11-year veteran {{who had already}} overcome three ACL tears in his career, went down with a broken arm in the NFC Championship Game.

25|$|Glass {{later learned}} that Fitzgerald had joined the army and was {{stationed}} at Fort Atkinson in present-day Nebraska. He traveled there as well, where Fitzgerald returned his stolen rifle.

However, the captain asked Fitzgerald to return the stolen rifle to Glass, and before departing Glass warned Fitzgerald never to leave the army, or <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>still</b> kill him. According to Yount's story, Glass also obtained $300 as compensation.|$|E
