The present study tested the hypothesis that bone-to-implant contact (BIC) and bone area fraction occupancy (BAFO) increase over <b>functional</b> <b>loading</b> time around dental implants. Due to prosthetic retreatment reasons, 93 human implant retrievals from the same manufacturer (Bicon LLC, Boston, MA, USA) were obtained over a period of approximately 15 years. The retrieved implants were under <b>functional</b> <b>loading</b> from 120 days to approximate to 18 years and were histomorphologic/metrically evaluated. BIC/BAFO were assessed as a function of multiple independent variables: implant surface type, diameter, length, jaw (maxilla/mandible), region (anterior/posterior), and time of <b>functional</b> <b>loading.</b> The results showed that both BIC and BAFO increased over time independently of implant design/clinical variables, supporting the postulated hypothesis.

25|$|Attempts at {{repair of}} ischaemic-damaged bone will usual occur in 2 phases. First, when dead bone abuts live marrow, {{capillaries}} and undifferentiated mesenchymal cells grow into the dead marrow spaces, while macrophages degrade dead cellular and fat debris. Second, mesenchymal cells differentiate into osteoblasts or fibroblasts. Under favorable conditions, layers of new bone {{form on the}} surface of dead spongy trabeculae. If sufficiently thickened, these layers may decrease the radiodensity of the bone; therefore, the first radiographic evidence of previous osteonecrosis may be patchy sclerosis resulting from repair. Under unfavorable conditions repeated attempts at repair in ischaemic conditions can be seen histologically and are characterized by extensive delamination or microcracking along cement lines as well as the formation of excessive cement lines. Ultimate failure of repair mechanisms due to persistent and repeated ischaemic events is manifested as trabecular fractures that occur in the dead bone under <b>functional</b> <b>load.</b> Later followed by cracks and fissures leading to structural collapse of the area involved (osteocavitation).|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To assess {{debonding}} due to <b>functional</b> <b>loading</b> at the cervical dentin {{margins of}} deep Class II MOD restorations prepared {{with a variety}} of adhesive restoratives in endodontically-treated teeth. Materials and Methods: MOD preparations and endodontic treatment were carried out on extracted sound maxillary premolars. The cavities were restored with seven material combinations: Three different resin-based composites (RBC) (Z 100, Herculite XRV or Clearfil RP with their respective bonding systems); two bonded amalgam combinations (Valiant with Superbond D or with Panavia 21) and two sandwich combinations [the RBC Tetric with the polyacid-modified RBC (compomer) Compoglass or Z 100 with the resin-modified glass ionomer Fuji II LC]. For each group, half of the samples were exposed to mechanical <b>functional</b> <b>loading</b> and the other half served as control. Imperfect bond formation and debonding due to loading was determined by dye penetration. In addition, the dye penetration scores were correlated with the cusp fracture strengths of similarly prepared restorations of a previous study. Results: After <b>functional</b> <b>loading,</b> the RBC in combination with hybridizing dentin bonding agents showed better preservation of marginal integrity than the sandwich restorations, which in turn performed better than the amalgam restorations (P < 0. 05). Debonding correlated with reduction in fracture resistance. Under the conditions of this study, debonding of adhesive MOD restorations by <b>functional</b> <b>loading</b> can best be prevented by using RBC in combination with hybridizing dentin-bonding systems...|$|R

40|$|SummaryObjectiveAltered loading is an {{important}} etiological factor for temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders. Studies examining altered loading of the TMJ {{have been done in}} rats but the response of the TMJ to altered loading in mice is largely unknown. Therefore, due to the potential usefulness of genetically engineered mice, the goal {{of this study was to}} develop a mouse TMJ altered <b>functional</b> <b>loading</b> model. MethodsOne hundred and thirty four, 21 -day-old CD- 1 female mice were divided into two groups: (1) normal loading (hard pellet diet) for 2 – 6 weeks and (2) altered <b>functional</b> <b>loading</b> (incisor trimming every other day and soft dough diet) for 2 – 6 weeks. The mandibular condylar cartilage was evaluated by histology, the subchondral bone was evaluated by microcomputed tomography (micro-CT) analysis and gene expression was evaluated by real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. ResultsAltered <b>functional</b> <b>loading</b> for 2 – 6 weeks caused significant reduction in the thickness of the condylar cartilage whereas, only at 4 weeks was there a significant decrease in the bone volume fraction and trabecular thickness of the subchondral bone. Gene expression analysis showed that altered <b>functional</b> <b>loading</b> for 4 weeks caused a significant reduction in the expression of SRY-box containing gene 9 (Sox 9), Collagen type X (Col X), Indian hedgehog (Ihh), Collagen type II (Col II) and Vascular endothelial growth factor (Vegf) and altered loading for 6 weeks caused a significant decrease in the expression of Sox 9, Col II, Vegf and Receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (Rankl) compared to the normal <b>loading</b> group. ConclusionAltered <b>functional</b> TMJ <b>loading</b> in mice for 2 – 6 weeks leads to a loss of the condylar cartilage and a transient loss in the density of the mandibular condylar subchondral bone...|$|R

5000|$|The first {{suggested}} {{measurement for}} <b>functional</b> <b>load</b> {{was the number}} of minimal pairs, but this {{does not take into account}} word frequency and is difficult to generalize beyond binary phonemic oppositions. Charles Hockett proposed an information theoretic definition in 1955, which has since been generalized. Now, given a large text corpus, one can compute the <b>functional</b> <b>load</b> of any phonological contrast including distinctive features, suprasegmentals, and distinctions between groups of phonemes. For instance, the <b>functional</b> <b>load</b> of tones in Standard Chinese is as high as that of vowels i.e. the information lost when all tones sound alike is as much as that lost when all vowels sound alike. [...] Martinet predicted that perceptually similar pairs of phonemes with low <b>functional</b> <b>load</b> would merge. This has not been proved empirically; indeed, all empirical tests have come out against it e.g. [...] merged with [...] in Cantonese in word-initial position in the late 20th century despite the fact that of all consonants in binary opposition to , only the [...] opposition had a higher <b>functional</b> <b>load</b> than the [...] opposition.|$|E

40|$|Malreduction and {{malalignment}} (malunion) of tibial fractures {{is often}} an unfortunate consequence of their treatment with half-frame external fixation devices. This problem is especially apparent in fractures with poor or absent bony apposition following proper surgical reduction. The increased demands placed on the fixator by weight bearing, escalate the incidence and severity of this complication. Therefore, this study sought to investigate a possible cause of this problem in the Hoffmann fixator, namely slippage in the universal joints, and to establish if any solution could be instituted to resolve or alleviate this slippage.;An initial analysis was performed to determine the loads which would cause an individual joint to slip at each of its interfaces of motion. These values were tested against the theoretical loads these same joints bore when an entire frame was tested to failure {{to determine if the}} earlier experiments had predictive power. Next, a joint modified to reduce slippage was tested in a similar manner to establish if it would better enable the fixator to bear <b>functional</b> <b>loads.</b> It was then determined if these slippage values were sufficient to enable the Hoffmann half-frame fixator to withstand functional weight-bearing.;The slippage values of the individual joint were found to be predictive of their performance within a total frame. The standard Hoffmann universal joint could not be expected to bear <b>functional</b> <b>loads</b> in a half-frame configuration without slippage occurring. The modified joints decreased the slippage problem in the joint and indicated certain Hoffmann half-frame configurations could protect against joint slippage under <b>functional</b> <b>loads</b> for some tibial fracture types.;Thus, universal joint slippage in Hoffmann half-frame fixators leading to frame failure and possible subsequent fracture malalignment could account for some of the malunion seen in tibial fractures bearing <b>functional</b> <b>loads.</b> Standard universal joints cannot be expected to bear <b>functional</b> <b>loads</b> for the tibia without failure. Half-frame configurations constructed with modified universal joints can be expected to withstand these loads in certain tibial fracture types, but based on this study, there appears to be little likelihood of half-frame configurations protecting against joint slippage and its subsequent complications in all types of tibial fractures...|$|R
