5|$|The <b>dictator</b> had maius imperium {{and total}} {{authority}} {{to command the}} state, however, since the <b>dictator</b> generally tried to maintain order, this did not conflict with {{the responsibilities of the}} other magistrates, who continued to function during a dictatorship. The magister equitum had similar plenary authority, with parallel and somewhat subordinate authority to the <b>dictator.</b>|$|E
5|$|To be {{considered}} a <b>dictator</b> novel, a story should have strong political themes drawn from history, a critical examination of the power held by the <b>dictator,</b> the caudillo, and some general reflection {{on the nature of}} authoritarianism. Although some <b>dictator</b> novels centre on one historical <b>dictator</b> (albeit in fictional guise), they do not analyze the economics, politics, and rule of the régime as might a history book. The <b>dictator</b> novel genre includes I, the Supreme (1974), by Augusto Roa Bastos, about Dr. Francia of Paraguay, and The Feast of the Goat (2000), by Mario Vargas Llosa, about Rafael Leónidas Trujillo of the Dominican Republic. Alternatively, the novelist might create a fictional <b>dictator</b> to achieve the same narrative end, as in Reasons of State (1974), by Alejo Carpentier, in which the <b>dictator</b> is a composite man assembled from historical dictators. The genre of the <b>dictator</b> novel has been very influential {{in the development of a}} Latin American literary tradition, because many of the novelists rejected traditional, linear story-telling techniques, and developed narrative styles that blurred the distinctions between reader, narrator, plot, characters, and story. In examining the authority of leadership, the novelists also assessed their own social roles as paternalistic dispensers of wisdom, like that of the caudillo whose régime they challenged in their <b>dictator</b> novels.|$|E
5|$|The novelists of the <b>dictator</b> novel genre {{combined}} narrative {{strategies of}} both modern and postmodern writing. Postmodern techniques, constructed {{largely in the}} late 1960s and 1970s, included use of interior monologues, radically stream-of-consciousness narrative, fragmentation, varying narrative points of view, neologisms, innovative narrative strategies, and frequent lack of causality. Alejo Carpentier, a Boom writer and contributor to the <b>dictator</b> novel genre pioneered {{what came to be}} known as magical realism, although the use of this technique is not necessarily a prerequisite of the <b>dictator</b> novel, as there are many that do not utilize magical realism.|$|E

40|$|Why do some leaders {{eliminate}} rivals from {{authoritarian regimes}} and therefore diminish elites' capabilities {{to remove them}} via coups, while others do not? By examining both dictators' incentives and opportunities to weaken regime elites, I show that <b>dictators</b> {{are more likely to}} eliminate rivals when elites' capabilities to oust <b>dictators</b> via coup is temporarily low. Thus, somewhat paradoxically, my theory predicts that <b>dictators</b> are more likely to weaken elites' capabilities as the threat of coup decreases rather than when coup risk is high. Furthermore, I argue that successful coups that put new <b>dictators</b> in power temporarily diminish elites' capabilities to remove <b>dictators</b> and, thus, provide a window of opportunity for the <b>dictators</b> to take steps to consolidate power. Empirical results using a new dataset on purges of militaries from 1969 to 2003 provide strong evidence for my hypotheses...|$|R
40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{focuses on}} three North African <b>dictators</b> who were overthrown in revolution of so called Arab Spring in 2011. These <b>dictators</b> are Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, Tunisia; Hosni Mubarak, Egypt, and Muammar Gaddafí, Libya. These three <b>dictators</b> were chosen {{because of their}} importance in the Arab Spring movement. In Ben Ali's ruled Tunisia the revolution started, Libya went through a civil war that ended with Gaddafi's death giving chance to the people to change the regime. Egypt {{is considered to be}} politically the most important Arab country and during Mubarak's rule {{it used to be a}} stable state. The revolution disclaimed this hypothesis. The thesis aims at comparing the way that two Czech weekly magazines Respekt and Týden wrote about the <b>dictators.</b> If we compare the pre-revoltuion era (from 2007 until early 2011) and the revolution year 2011, we can see the increase in the number of the texts published and that the way of speaking about the <b>dictators</b> has partically changed. We cannot leave without notice the scepticism which the magazines expressed to the upcoming elites after the falls of the <b>dictators.</b> The year 2011 witnessed the change and in case of Gaddafi, also the <b>dictator's</b> death.

5|$|In {{the history}} of post-independence Latin America, dictatorships have been {{relatively}} commonexamples range from Paraguay's José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia in the 19th century to Chile's Augusto Pinochet in the 20th. In this context, Latin American literature has been distinguished by the protest novel, or <b>dictator</b> novel; the main story is based around the <b>dictator</b> figure, his behaviour, characteristics and {{the situation of the}} people under his regime. Writers such as Sarmiento used the power of the written word in order to criticize government, using literature as a tool, an instance of resistance and as a weapon against repression.|$|E

5|$|Since the tribunes were {{considered}} to be the embodiment of the plebeians, they were sacrosanct. Their sacrosanctity was enforced by a pledge, taken by the plebeians, to kill any person who harmed or interfered with a tribune during his term of office. All of the powers of the tribune derived from their sacrosanctity. One consequence was that it was considered a capital offense to harm a tribune, to disregard his veto, or to interfere with a tribune. In times of military emergency, a <b>dictator</b> would be appointed for a term of six months. Constitutional government would be dissolved, and the <b>dictator</b> would be the absolute master of the state. When the dictator's term ended, constitutional government would be restored.|$|E
