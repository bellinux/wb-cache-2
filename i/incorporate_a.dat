5|$|Plans for an {{expansion}} of the high-speed line to Hamar have been launched, but have not been incorporated into any specific plans. This suggestion would increase the length of the high-speed rail north of Oslo with —almost a doubling. The project may or may not <b>incorporate</b> <b>a</b> further high-speed line to Trondheim.|$|E
5|$|The NAIT 5si is the {{entry-level}} NAIT and {{the direct}} {{replacement of the}} NAIT 5i (with italic 'i'); the NAIT XS 2 is positioned as the mid-range product. The SUPERNAIT 2, the flagship integrated amplifier in the Naim stable individually decoupled inputs and no digital circuitry. Both <b>incorporate</b> <b>a</b> headphone output via a class-A headphone amplifier.|$|E
5|$|The pavilion's {{construction}} was {{aided by the}} French CATIA software program and internet conferencing. Early plans to <b>incorporate</b> <b>a</b> surrounding waterfall and stairway were abandoned. In the end, budget limitations led to compromises with the original architectural plan that left many elements in their most straightforward form, such as exposed pipes and conduits, or rough concrete.|$|E

5|$|A town is a {{classification}} of municipalities used in British Columbia. British Columbia's Lieutenant Governor in Council may <b>incorporate</b> <b>a</b> {{community as a}} town by letters patent, under {{the recommendation of the}} Minister of Communities, Sport and Cultural Development, if its population is greater than 2,500 but not greater than 5,000 and the outcome of a vote involving affected residents was that greater than 50% voted in favour of the proposed incorporation.|$|E
5|$|Academic {{criticism}} of Inseminoid has {{concentrated on the}} film's treatment of the female sex and female sexualities {{in the context of}} corruption by an alien source. In addition to its depiction of the abject Sandy, who is rendered a distorted Other in the aftermath of her unnatural impregnation, the film has been seen to <b>incorporate</b> <b>a</b> clash between the patriarchal and the maternal towards its climax, as the new mother kills her former friends one by one. Complementing the film's successful VHS run, a novelisation of Inseminoid was written by Larry Miller.|$|E
5|$|All air well designs <b>incorporate</b> <b>a</b> {{substrate}} with {{a temperature}} sufficiently low so that dew forms. Dew {{is a form}} of precipitation that occurs naturally when atmospheric water vapour condenses onto a substrate. It is distinct from fog, in that fog is made of droplets of water that condense around particles in the air. Condensation releases latent heat which must be dissipated in order for water collection to continue.|$|E

5|$|All {{images from}} Hubble are {{monochromatic}} grayscale, in which its cameras <b>incorporate</b> <b>a</b> variety of filters each passing specific wavelengths of light. Color images {{are created by}} combining separate monochrome images taken through different filters. This process can also create false-color versions of images including infrared and ultraviolet channels, where infrared is typically rendered as a deep red and ultraviolet is rendered as a deep blue.|$|E
5|$|Design work on {{the class}} began in 1892 and lasted until 1894. The ships of the Kaiser Friedrich III class marked a {{significant}} departure from the previous s. Influenced by the Japanese cruisers' victory over a heavier-armed Chinese fleet at the Battle of Yalu, heavy-caliber guns designed to penetrate armor were abandoned and replaced with smaller quick-firing guns. These guns were intended to raze the superstructure of enemy battleships and demoralize the crew. The propulsion system was improved and reorganized to <b>incorporate</b> <b>a</b> third propeller shaft. The armor system, however, remained similar to that employed on the Brandenburgs.|$|E
5|$|Early in his career, Barton mainly {{played a}} {{defensive}} role, with a game based on tackling and tracking back {{to shield the}} defence. As his career has progressed, he has begun to <b>incorporate</b> <b>a</b> more attacking approach to his play, which {{has resulted in a}} greater number of goals and assists, and his six goals from midfield made him Manchester City's leading scorer in the 2006–07 season, ahead of strikers Georgios Samaras, Bernardo Corradi, Émile Mpenza and Darius Vassell.|$|E

Fluorescent lighting relies on mercury vapour for its operation. Ruby lasers generate deep red beams by exciting chromium atoms; the lanthanides are also extensively employed in lasers. Gallium, indium, and arsenic; and copper, iridium, and platinum {{are used in}} LEDs (the latter three in organic LEDs).|$|E
