40|$|The {{purpose of}} this Master's thesis {{is to look at}} {{possible}} designs for a robotic cleaning solution for salmon slaughterhouses due to the daily need for cleaning and thus high labor costs, and simulate these solutions. In addition, the use of computer vision to aid in such a task is investigated. This thesis is part of a research project that aims at being able to clean a whole slaughterhouse. The focus on this thesis was mainly on cleaning an <b>electric</b> <b>stunner,</b> but many of the challenges with cleaning such a component are transferable to cleaning a whole slaughterhouse. The main emphasis of this Master's thesis has been on developing different designs for the robotic cleaning solution. Finding a way to move a robot around in a salmon slaughterhouse is a big challenge, and various solutions to this have been developed and investigated. This thesis has both looked at alternatives for the robot, and also looked at smart solutions for the suspension of a robot. Both existing components already on the market have been evaluated, and building certain components from scratch have been investigated. A custom, modular robot have also been designed, with the goal of making a robot that is lighter and has a longer reach than any other robot in its weight class. Some of the designed solutions have been simulated, and it can be concluded that while probably none of the designed solutions will be the final solution when the project is done, some of the designs will greatly influence the next steps for the project. Further work will require trail and error and prototyping to reach a final design. Another aspect of the robotic cleaning is the robot trajectories. Cleaning is usually performed every day after production has stopped. In {{order to be able to}} clean even though a component has been moved, requiring new robot trajectories, computer vision has been tested to see if the position and orientation of components can be established with such an accuracy that the robot trajectories can be updated according to the computer vision data, and resume the cleaning. It can be concluded that computer vision can be accurate enough to calibrate new trajectories if a component is moved, given a good enough sensor. It was also tested to see if computer vision can be used to find unwanted obstacles in the environment. The experiments showed good results, and it can be concluded that unwanted objects can be found as long as they are not too small. To alleviate some of the problems with manually programming the hundreds of robot commands necessary to clean a whole <b>electric</b> <b>stunner,</b> some time was spent investigating the possibility to generate robot trajectories automatically from a CAD model of the <b>electric</b> <b>stunner.</b> This showed promising results for a simple geometry like a box on a table, but the complex geometries for the components in a salmon slaughterhouse proved to be difficult. Further work would be required to achieve a satisfactory result...|$|E

5000|$|Soon, Olaff, Steppenwolf, and Meg {{are at an}} oil works {{fixing the}} {{submarine}} now known as Deep Blue. As Meg watches them leave in Deep Blue, the Dagger League has cameclarification neededÂ and attack her. After the Dagger League members are defeated (one accidentally slips on oil and falls to his death in the ocean, one is hit by the big hook while getting distracted by the smoke {{coming out of the}} wrecked pipe, one is locked inside the building when Meg threw a wrench inside the working area and the member followed the noise, and the other one was crushed to death by the barrels of oil), Meg then went after the leader. As she knocks out the leader with a rag with chloroform, she removes the mask, revealing to be Oola. She ties up Oola and asks why was she being with the Dagger League. Oola said the Kraken is a [...] "secret that won't be revealed" [...] and Oola also said that she and the Dagger League took care of Deep Blue and it is [...] "too late" [...] for Steppenwolf. Oola said that Steppenwolf will go very deep into the ocean and will [...] "stay" [...] there. Suddenly, a helicopter arrives and reveals the Captain Lockman has arrived. Meanwhile, under the deep ocean in the submarine carrier, Olaff tells Steppenwolf to be careful with the submarine, because he spent years building the damn thing. As Steppenwolf gets into the submarine, the propulsion mechanism is broken, but Olaff told him that it should be working, because he tested it three days ago. Steppenwolf then finds the Kraken's tentacle. He scares it away by using a flagpole that broke the giant sharp rocks. Steppenwolf then scares it away when the submarine landed on the crumbled platform, which was destroyed and landed on a big part of a sunken ship which scared the Kraken away. Steppenwolf then uses a mine and attaches it on a grid and when the Kraken touched the mine, the mine exploded and scared the beast away. Steppenwolf then uses a torpedo bomb and drops it in the trench which touches a lava tube which exploded and the lava tube shot out lava which scared away the Kraken in its home. Steppenwolf uses a net and captures three angler fish and they light up the inside of the Kraken's home, revealing the monster. He also blocks the hole with the net to prevent the angler fish from escaping. Steppenwolf uses a winch and attaches it on a small stalagtite. He was ready to battle the Kraken, but the <b>electric</b> <b>stunners</b> were empty. Steppenwolf finds a cannon and takes it. He goes back above the trench and finds a small sunken ship and bashes it with the cannon and finds a lot of working electric charges. He brings the electric charges and heads back down to the Kraken's home. The submarine grabs the winch and he swings and throws three charges in the Kraken's mouth, stunning it. Steppenwolf then uses the syringe and collects some of its blood (however, the longer Steppenwolf waits, the Kraken will recover). As Steppenwolf leaves the trench, he uses lifeboat and floats up into the submarine carrier. Olaff and Steppenwolf get out of the sea and head back to the oil works and find Meg sitting next to Captain Lockman and Oola. Olaff was shocked of his daughter being the leader of the Dagger League. Lockman then tells everyone to stop the meeting. Steppenwolf then shows Lockman the Kraken's blood {{and he said that he}} could get the job faster without Lockman. Lockman said it doesn't matter and said that Reggie Donovan is waiting for their [...] "little treasure".|$|R
40|$|The <b>electric</b> <b>stunner</b> (e-stunner) is {{commonly}} used to handle Nile crocodiles (Crocodylus niloticus) on commercial farms in South Africa, but while it seems to improve handling and safety for the keepers, no information regarding physiological reactions to e-stunning is currently available. The {{aim of this study}} was therefore to compare various physiological parameters in farmed Nile crocodiles captured either manually (noosing) or by using an e-stunner. A total of 45 crocodiles were captured at a South African farm by either e-stunning or noosing, and blood samples were taken immediately as well as four hours after capture. Parameters monitored were serum corticosterone, lactate, glucose, as well as alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, and creatinine kinase. Lactate concentrations were significantly higher in noosed compared to e-stunned animals (P < 0. 001). No other blood parameter differed significantly between the two capture methods. In addition, recorded capture time confirmed that noosing takes significantly longer compared to e-stunning (P < 0. 001), overall indicating that e-stunning seems the better option for restraint of especially large numbers of crocodiles in a commercial setup because it is quicker, safer, and did not cause a significant increase in any of the parameters measured.

40|$|During {{the past}} 15 years {{crocodile}} farming {{has become more}} important and sophisticated all over the world. In South Africa there are currently an estimated one million Nile crocodiles (Crocodylus niloticus) on commercial farms, mostly for leather production. The management, especially of crocodiles that are close to slaughter, is very intensive as the skins of these animals {{have to be in}} immaculate condition to achieve good prices on the international markets. In this regard, the <b>electric</b> <b>stunner</b> is often used on a daily basis on most farms in South Africa to safely handle crocodiles. However, this technique (electrical immobilisation) has only been scientifically evaluated in the Australian saltwater crocodile (C. porosus). As crocodilian species might react differently to the electrical immobilisation procedure, the aim of the project was to compare certain physiological parameters of Nile crocodiles captured by either electrical immobilisation (stunning) or captured manually by noosing. This study was conducted during the summer of 2012 on a commercial crocodile farm near Pongola, South Africa. In total 45 crocodiles were used of which 23 crocodiles were captured by electrical immobilisation and 22 by means of noosing. Physiological parameters chosen for monitoring were serum corticosterone, blood lactate, blood glucose, as well as alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and creatinine kinase (CK). The concentrations and activities of these parameters were determined in blood samples collected immediately after capture by the two methods. Animals were then tied and blind-folded and kept in a quiet place. Four hours later blood samples were collected again from each animal to monitor changes in concentrations and activities of these parameters. In all cases the time was recorded that it took to capture each animal. In addition, total handling time until blood collection was also recorded on an individual basis. Our results indicate that although corticosterone increased greatly within the four hour interval in both groups, there was no difference (p> 0. 05) between the two methods of capture. Lactate did not increase significantly within the four hour period in both groups, but was higher when animals were noosed. Glucose concentrations rose within four hours, but no significant differences could be detected between the two capture methods. While ALT and ALP did not show any clear trend, increased activities were detected for AST and CK in the four hour period after capture. Both, AST and CK levels were higher in noosed animals. Noosing a crocodile took longer to restrain the animal when compared to the stunning method. On average stunning took 118 seconds from start of capture until an animal was under control while noosing took 186 seconds per animal. As a consequence the noosed animals struggle for a longer time, which most probably caused exhaustion and muscle damage; explaining the higher levels of blood lactate, AST and CK. One helper was injured (bite wound) trying to control a crocodiles using the noose method. Electrical immobilisation is therefore considered to be the better option for commercial farms, from a physiological perspective, as well as an animal welfare and human safety viewpoint.
