500|$|Both sides {{used the}} respite {{to prepare for}} the next day. Virginia put her wounded ashore and {{underwent}} temporary repairs. Captain Buchanan was among the wounded, so command on the second day fell to his executive officer, Lieutenant Catesby ap Roger Jones. Jones proved to be no less aggressive than the man he replaced. While Virginia was being prepared for renewal of the battle, and while Congress was still ablaze, Monitor, commanded by Lieutenant John L. Worden, arrived in Hampton Roads. The Union ironclad had been rushed to Hampton Roads in hopes of protecting the Union fleet and preventing Virginia from threatening Union cities. Captain Worden was informed that his primary task was to protect Minnesota, so Monitor took up a position near the grounded Minnesota and waited.

500|$|The band {{feared that}} {{following}} the overt rock of the War album and tour, {{they were in}} danger of becoming another [...] "shrill", [...] "sloganeering arena-rock band". The group were confident that fans would embrace them as successors to the Who and Led Zeppelin, but according to Bono: [...] "something just didn't feel right. We <b>felt</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> more dimension than just the next big anything, we had something unique to offer." [...] Thus, they sought experimentation for their fourth studio album, The Unforgettable Fire. Clayton said, [...] "We were looking for something that was a bit more serious, more arty." [...] The Edge admired the ambient and [...] "weird works" [...] of Brian Eno, who, along with his engineer Daniel Lanois, eventually agreed to produce the record. Island Records founder Chris Blackwell initially tried to discourage them from their choice of producers, believing that just when the band were about to achieve the highest levels of success, Eno would [...] "bury them under a layer of avant-garde nonsense".|$|E

The CW president Mark Pedowitz explained, “We had better pilots. The bottom line is we <b>felt</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> stronger things to go with, and we didn’t go forward with it. It was well-written, it was darker than we wanted it to be, and we didn’t believe it had sustainability... We didn’t believe that it was a sustainable script, a sustainable series.

500|$|In 1880, an Australian side captained by Billy Murdoch toured England. The {{tourists}} {{had difficulty}} finding good opponents; most county sides turned them down, although Yorkshire played two unofficial matches against them. There {{was a lot}} of bad will, exacerbated by the Australians' arrival in England at short notice, to some extent unexpectedly. [...] This was heightened by an English perception that the Australians came frequently to maximise their profits; at the time, professionalism was frowned upon. [...] In his autobiography Lord Harris wrote, [...] "They asked no-one's goodwill in the matter, and it was felt this was a discourteous way of bursting in on our arrangements; and the result was they played scarcely any counties and were not generally recognised ... We <b>felt</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> to make a protest against too frequent visits". Harris initially shunned the team and tried to avoid correspondence and meetings with them. An attempt to arrange a game against an English XI for the Cricketers' Fund was turned down, and public advertisements in the newspapers were shunned. W.G. Grace was sympathetic to the Australians and felt that they were not to blame for the riot. He attempted to arrange a game for them at Lord's, but was rebuffed by the Marylebone Cricket Club, who gave the excuse that the ground was not available.|$|E
500|$|On July 30, 2010, the NBC network {{announced}} that {{an episode of}} 30 Rocks fifth season would be filmed and broadcast live on two occasions in the evening of October 14, 2010. The decision was made {{in part due to}} lagging ratings for all of NBC's Must-See TV line-up. The idea was originally conceived during the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike, when the cast performed two live versions of the season two episode [...] "Secrets and Lies" [...] as a benefit at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre in New York City. When asked by Entertainment Weekly the reason for doing a live episode, Fey said [...] " [...] was what made us {{think that it would be}} fun to do [...] And how far we've come... Now we're going to do it on TV." [...] In this same interview, Fey revealed that the episode would also be performed in front of a live audience. [...] "It will be exciting for us to do it for a live audience and see if we get live laughter." [...] Fey noted that the experience [...] "was so fun to feel the different timing of the show live and the audience response, which you just don't get in a single-camera show." [...] In another interview, Fey revealed that the staff have talked about doing a live show for years [...] "because we <b>felt</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> sort of interesting personnel for it." [...] Following the conclusion of the writers' strike they spoke to NBC about performing live and attempted to film it during the fourth season; however, they were unable to schedule it. For the fifth season, the writing staff began planning the live performance and waited until McCarthy-Miller—a recurring 30 Rock director—was available to helm it. Fey and Carlock said in separate discussions that another decision to do this episode of 30 Rock was based on the cast having theater and improvisation experience. Alec Baldwin had previously performed in the East and West live broadcasts of the Will & Grace [...] premiere episode, [...] "Alive and Schticking".|$|E
