40|$|Kraft pulp fibers lose inter-fiber bonding ability {{when they}} are dried during the {{manufacture}} of paper. Adverse environmental consequences of this loss include (a) limitations {{on the number of}} times that kraft fibers can be recycled, (b) reduced paper strength, sometimes making it necessary to use heavier paper or paperboard to meet product strength requirements, increasing the usage of raw materials, (c) decreased rates of paper production in cases where the <b>fiber</b> <b>furnish</b> has been over-refined in an attempt to regain inter-fiber bonding ability. The present study is the first of its type to focus on unbleached kraft fibers, which are a main ingredient of linerboard for corrugated containers. About 90 million tons of unbleached kraft fiber are used worldwide every year for this purpose...|$|E
40|$|Eucalyptus wood {{is among}} the most {{important}} biomass resource in the world. Wood mechanical defibration and fibrillation are energy-intensive processes utilized not only to produce pulp for papermaking, but also to produce reinforcement fibers for biocomposites, nanocellulose, or pretreat lignocellulosic material for biofuels production. The structural features of different Eucalyptus hybrids affecting the refining energy consumption and produced <b>fiber</b> <b>furnish</b> properties were evaluated. The defibration and fiber development were performed using an alkaline peroxide mechanical pulping (APMP) process, which included chelation followed by an alkaline peroxide treatment prior to wood chip defibration. Despite the similar wood densities and chemical compositions of different Eucalyptus hybrids, there was a clear difference in the extent of defibration and fibrillation among the hybrids. The high energy consumption was related to a high amount of guaiacyl lignin. This observation is of major importance when considering the optimal wood hybrids for mechanical wood defibration and for understanding the fundamental phenomena taking place in chemi-mechanical defibration of wood...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} project presents {{new information about}} the permanence and durability of contemporary Korean handmade papers, explains the particular methods of traditional hanji papermakers while introducing the possibilities of utilizing the products of Korean papermills in conservation. Traditional Korean papermaking uses a unique technique, known as webal, to form a sheet which distributes fibers evenly in both directions theoretically resulting in less specific grain direction and an expansion/contraction rate which is even in both directions. In addition, Korean paper employs an exclusive use of paper mulberry known as chamdak or dak {{in contrast to the}} typically mixed <b>fiber</b> <b>furnish</b> of Chinese papers. Like most East Asian papers, the pH of Korean paper is alkaline or neutral. The typical alkalis used to prepare fibers are soda ash (Na 2 CO 3) or caustic soda (NaOH). A variety of contemporary samples of Korean papers have been artificially aged and evaluated according to TAPPI standards {{under the direction of the}} Research and Testing Laboratory of the Library of Congress. This project will present interesting data concerning tensile strength, brightness, and pH before and after aging as well as expansion and contraction measurements. The results are very promising for the possibility of using Hanji for conservation treatment. One of the suggested advantages of using Hanji may be in the lack of strong grain direction providing a stable and non competing repair or lining paper...|$|E
40|$|By {{removing}} the primary fines from an oxygen-delignified mill birch pulp, a fiber fraction was obtained having low metals content and no extractives. After DEDeD bleaching the fiber fraction had somewhat higher brightness and better brightness stability than the birch pulp containing the primary fines. The fines fraction was enriched with lignin, extractives, xylan, and metals. Bleaching the fines fraction in a QQP sequence {{did not affect}} the extractives, whereas a ZeQP sequence clearly reduced the extractives content. In a biorefinery concept, the fines fraction could be utilized as a source of xylan, fatty acids, sterols, and betulinol. Another possibility is to use the fines fraction unbleached or separately bleached as a bonding material in various <b>fiber</b> <b>furnishes...</b>|$|R

This article reviews current design considerations for developing a safe, effective clinical laser angioplasty system. The choice of laser, fiber, and catheter determines the performance characteristics of such a system. The laser provides the power source for ablative radiation, the <b>fiber</b> <b>furnishes</b> a means of transmitting the laser radiation, and the catheter provides a way of directing the fiber at the target tissue.

25|$|China is the world's largest {{producer}} and consumer of agricultural products– and some 300million Chinese farm workers {{are in the}} industry, mostly laboring on pieces of land {{about the size of}} U.S farms. Virtually all arable land is used for food crops. China is the world's largest producer of rice and is among the principal sources of wheat, corn (maize), tobacco, soybeans, potatoes, sorghum, peanuts, tea, millet, barley, oilseed, pork, and fish. Major non-food crops, including cotton, other <b>fibers,</b> and oilseeds, <b>furnish</b> China with a small proportion of its foreign trade revenue. Agricultural exports, such as vegetables and fruits, fish and shellfish, grain and meat products, are exported to Hong Kong. Yields are high because of intensive cultivation, for example, China's cropland area is only 75% of the U.S. total, but China still produces about 30% more crops and livestock than the United States. China hopes to further increase agricultural production through improved plant stocks, fertilizers, and technology.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to evaluate the effect of kenaf <b>fiber</b> orientation and <b>furnish</b> formulation on the properties of laminated natural fiber–polymer composites (LNPC). The uniaxial fiber orientation provided property enhancement of the LNPC. The ran-domly oriented kenaf fibers, regardless of fiber con-tents in the laminates, provided an equal performance compared to the composites made of 25 % fiber glass reinforced polyvinyl ester resin in the same laboratory processing conditions. Thermal properties of the lami-nates obtained from thermal gravimetry with differen-tial scanning calorimetry (TG-DSC) showed that the melting point (Tm) of the polypropylene (PP) film lami-nates decreased, and the crystallization peak increased as the kenaf fiber content in the laminates increased. The surface morphology results of the kenaf fiber and fractures of the laminates showed that some fibers pulled out from the matrix. The mechanical properties increased as the kenaf fiber content increased. The tensile stress of the laminated compo-sites fabricated with unidirectional fiber orientation was about 2 – 4 times higher than those with the ran-domly oriented samples. POLYM.

40|$|UnrestrictedPhotoacoustic {{microscopy}} is an {{imaging technique}} which draws from the specific strengths of two imaging modalities by capturing {{the contrast of}} optical imaging, while retaining the high resolution of ultrasonic imaging. It provides great promise for studying the structure and dynamics of tissue micro-vasculature in development and pathogenesis. Previous work in photoacoustic imaging has been mostly limited to single element transducers. This thesis presents results of a novel photoacoustic microscopy system using a 30 MHz linear array and a custom receive electronics. There are {{two versions of the}} system, PAM I and PAM II. Both systems are comprised of three main components, a short pulsed laser, a high frequency transducer, and a custom multi-channel electronics system. The attraction towards high frequency arrays over single element transducers is natural; they offer the same resolution advantage of higher frequencies, while diminishing the need for mechanical scanning through steering of the beam, delivering aperture flexibility, tighter focusing capabilities through beamformation, and the capability to image in real-time.; The PAM I system includes an Nd:YAG pumped tunable dye laser, delivering a 6. 5 ns pulse duration, and a 10 Hz pulse repetition rate to the sample via an optical <b>fiber.</b> <b>Furnishing</b> an incident energy of approximately 6 mJ/cm 2 at 584 nm, the laser induced acoustic waves via thermoelastic expansion. Using a 30 MHz linear array and a custom multi-channel receive system, both phantom and in situ photoacoustic images were obtained. The receiving transducer array is a piezo-composite 48 element linear array, with an 8 mm focal depth, and a - 6 dB fractional bandwidth of 50 %. Multi-channel receive electronics were developed to include multiplexing and signal processing stages. Four-to-one multiplexers are used to select between elements. The signals are passed through filtering stages, followed by variable and fixed gain stages. The system receiver gain varies from 33 dB- 73 dB, with a - 3 dB system response between 8 MHz and 55 MHz. The channels are further multiplexed to acquire data from a 4 channel oscilloscope. Using offline delay and sum beamforming, initial results provided phantom images from an 80 µm hair in water, and a 6 µm carbon fiber in an optically scattering medium similar to biological tissue. Photoacoustic images in situ clearly showed subcutaneous vessels less than 100 µm in diameter imaged at depths of 3 mm below the skin surface in a Sprague Dawley rat.; The PAM II system is a 16 channel fully automated parallel multi-channel system that acquires data from all elements on the receive board at once. Controlled by the user interface and the PC, the PAM II system uses the receiver front end analog board and is complimented by custom digital electronics. The digital portion of the system is a backplane motherboard/channel board scheme. Individual channel boards simultaneously digitize the echoes from the receiver at a 100 MHz sampling rate. Digital data are then stored in temporary memory and transferred via the PCI bus to the PC with an NI- 6534 (National Instruments, Houston, TX) acquisition board. A Labview program was developed to handle system triggering, and control signals to the digital board and receiver multiplexers. PAM II uses an Isonnolab Edgewave laser pumping 6 ns pulses at 598 nm using an electro-optic Q-switch, delivering an incident energy of below 15 mJ/cm 2. Phantom images in water and Intralipid solution were formed to characterize the system. Photoacoustic images of micro-vessels in a human hand and 3 D images of vasculature in two Sprague Dawley rats were obtained in vivo. The axial and lateral spatial resolutions for both systems were found to be 45 ± 5 µm and 100 ± 5 µm, respectively. Ongoing research is also presented for development of a real time PAM system. Initial experiments provided in vivo rat images differentiating micro-vessels in systole and diastole...|$|R
40|$|Formation {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the end-use properties of paper products, but before formation can be optimized to achieve superior properties, an understanding about the causes of formation must be developed. Formation is caused by variations in the basis weight of paper that are results of fiber floc formation before and during the forming of the sheet. This project is a first step in a larger research program aimed at studying formation. By observing the effects that mechanical energy dissipation (in the form of turbulence) and retention chemical dosage have on floc formation, we may develop a better understanding of how to control formation. In this study, a rectangular cross-section flow channel was constructed to aid in the acquisition of digital images of a flowing <b>fiber</b> suspension. The <b>furnish</b> consisted of a 55 : 45 spruce:pine bleached market pulp mix from a Western Canadian mill. Turbulence was varied by changing the flow rate; Reynolds numbers achieved range from 20, 000 to 40, 000. The retention aid used was a cationic polyacrylamide with a medium charge density. Dosage of the retention aid was varied from 0 to 2 pounds per ton OD fiber. Digital images of the flowing fiber suspension were acquired with a professional digital SLR camera with a forensics-quality lens. Three separate image analysis techniques were used to measure the flocculation state of the fiber suspension: morphological image operations, formation number analysis, and fast Fourier transform analysis. Morphological image analysis was capable of measuring floc size increases seen in the acquired floc images. It was shown how floc diameter could increase simultaneously with decreasing total floc area and total floc number. A regression model relating retention aid dosage and energy dissipation was constructed in an effort to predict flocculation. The regression model was used to predict F 2 (formation number squared) results from the study. The interaction effect RE was shown to have a differing effect across the retention aid dosage levels. As a result, this model and technique may prove to be a beneficial tool in optimizing retention aid applications. Ph. D.
