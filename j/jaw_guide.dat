40|$|AbstractThis {{research}} {{introduces a}} new surgical clip instrument with improved mechanism {{to apply the}} metal clips to patient's vessel/tissues in the surgical operations. The improved clip delivery system has been designed and developed in the instrument to improve the clip distal move from clip channel into <b>jaw</b> <b>guide</b> track and resolve the problems of clip accidental shooting out when clip is being loaded into jaw pair by compression spring that has been normally used in some current surgical clip instruments. With this improvement, this new surgical open clip instrument can prevent patient's vessels and tissues from being damaging because the distal move of clips is well controlled without clip drop-off incident. Plus the operational force to form the clip is lower than regular surgical instruments due to new mechanism design. In addition to the above, the manufacturing and product cost can be decreased because the dimensional tolerance of components, such as clip channel and <b>jaw</b> <b>guide</b> track, can be wider due to this new instrument design. The prototype of this new instrument is analyzed and optimized through computer aided modeling and simulation, {{in order to prove}} its feasible function, reliable performance, and mechanical advantage. All these improved features have also been tested and verified through the prototype. With some further improvement to this new instrument design and valuable evaluations from surgeon and clinical fields in next several months, the commercial availability of this surgical clip instrument will be anticipate in 1 – 2 years...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the recent {{research and development}} of an endo surgical/biomedical instrument in surgical suture applications for minimally invasive therapy procedure. The newly developed instruments can not only protect the wound during the surgical procedure but also actively help the healing process. The new mechanism design of the surgical instrument aids in better ergonomic design, reliable functionality, and continuous cost reduction in product manufacturing. 3 -D modeling technique, functionality analysis, kinematical simulation and computer aided solution have been applied to the instrument design, development and future improvement to meet the specific requirements of minimally invasive surgery procedure. The improved new endo surgical/biomedical instrument can prevent patient’s vessels and tissues from being damaging because the distal move of clips are well controlled without clip drop-off incident. Plus the operational force to form the clip is lower than regular surgical/biomedical instruments due to this special new mechanism design. In addition to the above, the manufacturing and product cost can be decreased because the dimensional tolerance of components, such as clip channel and <b>jaw</b> <b>guide</b> track, can be loose due to this new instrument design. The prototypes of this new endo surgical/biomedical instrument design are analyzed through computer aided modeling and simulation, in order to prove its feasible functionality, reliable performance, and mechanical advantage. All these improved features have also been tested and verified through the prototypes...|$|E

40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a device for interventions in a tube-shaped body cavity, in particular for ureteroendotomy. The device has a guide tube (3) containing an axially movable operating rod (4) at whose proximal end is a knife (1) with {{a cutting edge}} (8) and at whose other end an operating end to move the knife (1) in the axial direction from an idle position to an operating position. The main feature of the invention is that a knife guiding part (2) is provided, said part being connected to the guide tube (3) in a locked bearing and which is provided with an axial bore hole to receive and guide a knife holding sleeve (5) bearing the knife (1) and coupled to the operating rod (4) and an axial slot forming two <b>guide</b> <b>jaws</b> (12) for the knife (1), whereby the <b>guiding</b> <b>jaws</b> (12) of the knife guiding parts (2) has a shape largely fitting {{the shape of the}} knife (1) such that the cutting edge (8) of the knife (1) is covered completely by the <b>guiding</b> <b>jaws</b> (12) on the side when the cutting edg e (8) of the knife (1) is in its idle position, and that, furthermore, the knife guiding part (2) has a thicker part (14) clamping the body cavity perpendicular to the plane of the cutting edge (8) in the front area already freeing the cutting edge (8) of the knife (1) on its top side on transition to an operating position...|$|R
30|$|There {{are also}} {{drawbacks}} to using a cutting guide. These include the extra {{cost of the}} design and manufacture of a surgical guide. However, these disadvantages diminish as the technologies in this field improve. Given that CAD/CAM-based orthognathic guides are already in use for the maxilla, additional guide models for use in genioplasty can be designed and manufactured more rapidly and therefore more cheaply. We envisage the use of orthognathic surgical guides to cut, and remove, the jaw. In addition, they {{could be used in}} conjunction with <b>jaw</b> positioning <b>guides,</b> to allow the surgeon to determine the amount of jaw displacement, using landmark data. More complex guides could even be designed to both hold maxillary and mandibular bone segments in place and link with cutting guides.|$|R
30|$|The {{oral and}} peri-oral {{musculature}} especially the lips, cheeks and tongue are well {{developed in a}} newborn. Apart from affecting the harmonious growth {{and development of the}} <b>jaws,</b> they also <b>guide</b> occlusal development and help in establishing a correct inter-maxillary relationship. Suckling done by the child during breastfeeding is more physiologic and promotes a better oro-facial development. In the literature, an increased duration of breastfeeding has often been associated with a reduced incidence of malocclusion [1],[2].|$|R
40|$|This article {{introduces}} a new biomedical / open surgical instrument to assist surgeon in applying surgical clips to patient’s body tissue and blood vessel during surgical processes. The new clip delivery {{system is designed}} to better the clip’s distal advance through internal clip channel, <b>jaw</b> <b>guiding</b> track, and all other transition areas to keep surgical clip from accidental shooting out during clip’s distal move into jaws. Currently the clip distal move in normal surgical instrument is usually driven by compression springs and some complains of clip accidental drop-off were recorded in surgical procedures. Because higher request of dimensional tolerance and better component surface quality are needed in case the compression springs are used as driven force, a little dimensional devia-tion or less qualified part surface produced from manufacturing processes will potentially cause surgical clip device malfunction or misfiring of the clips. It is clearly known that the jaws can seriously sever or damage patient’s blood ves-sel or body tissue {{if there is no}} clip inside the jaws due to accidental clip drop-off, when surgeons close instrument handles. The improved internal system design in this new open surgical instrument can prevent clip from accidental drop-off because of well guided and controlled clip distal move through internal clip channel and track. Besides the operational force to fully form clip is lower than existing surgical clip devices due to better mechanical advantage in this new instrument design. In addition to the above, manufacturing and product cost can be decreased since lower requirement of dimensional tolerance and surface quality of instrumental parts is allowed in this new surgical instrument design. This new instrumental prototype is build upon the analysis of computer aided modeling and simulation to prove its good mechanical advantage, feasible function, reliable performance. The preliminary results of instrument fir-ing force from both computer aided modeling and prototype testing are very close to each other, and preliminary prototype testing shows no accidental clip drop-off in this new biomedical / surgical clip instrument...|$|R
50|$|Wilson {{was born}} near Almonte, Ontario to Robert and Jane Wilson. He {{received}} his education in Carleton County and, with his family, homesteaded on Beaver Creek near Hanley in 1883. The family had bought 190 {{acres of land}} in Beaver Creek. After leaving home, Wilson worked in Moose <b>Jaw,</b> as <b>guide</b> for the transport department during the North-West Rebellion {{and served as a}} railway contractor along with his brother from 1884 to 1885. Wilson started merchandising in dray in 1883. From 1893 to 1896, he traded in food and livery along with H. McDonald. Wilson and his brothers sold the property after their parents moved to Saskatoon in 1899. After selling their property Wilson continued his business in partnership with his brother Archibald. The two brothers started Wilson Bros., a livery business; they later sold the company and began trading in carriages, harnesses and automobiles. In 1908, he married Ida Dunham of Brockville. Wilson served {{as the director of the}} Saskatoon Milling Company (later sold to Quaker Oats), and the Northwestern Telephone Company. He also served on the Soldier Land Settlement Board in 1919, and on Saskatoon's city council from 1923 to 1925.|$|R
