However, the <b>hierarchical</b> <b>top</b> to down structure of the military organizations, culturally prevent it from being successfully performed. Detailed command, {{which is the most}} traditional and common method of military management, should be melted with a new kind of method towards mission command. In this study, a new management approach, ‘servant leadership’ is applied to the detailed command to melt down the harsh and distant structure. Ultimately, a new term is introduces to the literature, ‘devoted command ’ as the military version of the ‘servant command. ’ With the devoted command, the military bodies will simply create the social and task coherence, form a positive climate for mutual understanding, and the subordinates will have a better apprehension of the commander’s intent that will help mission command naturally activate...|$|E

For ambiguous queries, user intent space actually forms a <b>hierarchical</b> <b>top</b> down ar-chitecture: from senses to subtopics, rather than a flat struc-ture. This paper presents the CNU system in NTCIR- 11 IMine task. Our method constructs the hierarchical struc-ture by exploiting global semantic representation and expan-sion. The highlights include: 1) We use word semantic vec-tors and propose a query dependent semantic composition for representing query aspect phrases. Our target is to allevi-ate the term-mismatch and data sparseness problems, which shallow lexical matching and co-occurrence based local se-mantics are ineffective to overcome. 2) We expand query subtopics by introducing new words according to global se-mantic relatedness and cluster these words for query sense induction.

40|$|In this paper, a two-layer {{approach}} {{is presented to}} guarantee the stable behavior of bilateral telemanipulation sys- tems {{in the presence of}} time-varying destabilizing factors such as hard contacts, relaxed user grasps, stiff control settings, and/or communication delays. The approach splits the control architec- ture into two separate layers. The <b>hierarchical</b> <b>top</b> layer is used to implement a strategy that addresses the desired transparency, and the lower layer ensures that no “virtual” energy is generated. This means that any bilateral controller can be implemented in a passive manner. Separate communication channels connect the layers at the slave and master sides so that information related to exchanged energy is completely separated from information about the desired behavior. Furthermore, the proposed implementation does not depend on any type of assumption about the time delay in the communication channel. By complete separation of the proper- ties of passivity and transparency, each layer can accommodate any number of different implementations that allow for almost inde- pendent optimization. Experimental results are presented, which highlight the benefit of the proposed framework...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe paper {{investigates the}} problem of {{managing}} multiple encryption keys generation overhead issues in scalable video coding (H. 264 /SVC) and proposes a <b>hierarchical</b> <b>top</b> down keys generation and distribution system by using a standard key management protocol MIKEY (Multimedia Internet Keying Protocol). The research goal is two-fold; (1) prevention of information leakage by the selective encryption of network abstraction layer (NAL) units with AES-CTR block cipher algorithm, and (2) reduction of multiple layer encryption keys overhead for scalable video distribution. We combine a MIKEY with the digital rights management (DRM) techniques to derive a mechanism in which every entitled user of each layer has only one encryption key to use, but this key will transparently open the doors of all layers below. The timing results are calculated for the encryption/decryption and the key generation processes relative to encoding/decoding time of test video files, which are noticeably negligible. The scheme is enormously suitable for video distribution to users who have subscribed to various video qualities regarding their desire or constraints on their devices and helps in preventing the loss of revenue of paid services...|$|E
40|$|Worldwide, {{nations are}} {{implementing}} National Spatial Data Infrastructures development policies. In most countries national governments are spearheading this process. The predominant {{view is that}} a hierarchical approach following administrative jurisdictions is most effective; hereby the SDI policy is implemented at a national level first, and then dependent provincial governments and municipalities harmonize their policies with the national ones. The result would be a seamless spatial data management and sharing practice across vertical jurisdictions, whereby national level policy can support uniform NSDI standards and foster interoperability at lower levels of government. Reality provides however a contrasting picture. Smaller jurisdictions may be innovating faster than national government bodies {{and may not be}} mirror images of the SDI design from ‘above’. This research takes a closer look at what appears to be an alternative SDI development paradigm.

The method has been applied on five sets of cerebral artery locations with aneurysms in order to evaluate their post invasive structural changes. The algorithm works in a semi-automatic manner where the bifurcation zone has been selected as the reference zone. This landmark matching approach works {{as the basis of}} the initial stage, coarse affine transformation. The non-rigid intermediate stage is optional and is dependent on the difference of the comparative angular orientation of the models in three dimensional space. Afterward, a third stage of iterative affine transformation is applied for finer adjustments if there is scope for any. Once registered with limiting boundaries, the branch by branch structural comparisons are interpreted quantitatively with box and whisker plots. In order to verify the proposed method, overlapping for one of the fifteen branch sets has also been evaluated with dice similarity indices. The resulting comparison gives a good support in favour of the proposed method. General Terms Medical image registration, 3 D volume registration, skeleton based registration...|$|E

This helps in the monitoring and management of marine systems and coastal resources over large areas. The objective {{of this research is}} to utilized a 4 band (Red, Green, Blue, NIR) WorldView- 2 satellite image of Guiuan, Eastern Samar to produce a benthic habitat map using object-based image analysis. The image had undergone two major steps: pre-processing and classification. The pre-processing comprised of several steps essential to correct the raw satellite image file for benthic habitat mapping. First, the image’s reflected radiance was calibrated and corrected from water surface and atmospheric scattering. Then, land and cloud masking was performed. Next, Hedley’s deglinting formula was applied to remove the effects of sun glint in the image by utilizing the NIR band of the dark pixels. The water column correction was adapted from Lyzenga to remove the effects of the absorption and scattering of photons in the water. A depth invariant matrix was calculated and applied to the band pairs of good water reflectors. The inputs for the multi-scale classification were the pre-processed WorldView- 2 satellite image, and color transformation outputs from RGB to HSV and RGB to HLS outputted into 3 layers using Prinicipal Component Analysis. For the classification, a multiscale segmentation was applied using a <b>hierarchical</b> <b>top</b> to bottom scheme.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the seemingly inespacable tension between two dominant approaches to governance that are implemented {{with regard to}} the planning, design and development of infrastructure networks, such as roads and railways. Roughly, these approaches can be framed in two styles of governance, the hierarchical and the consensual style (Smits, 1995). In today’s (western) societies, hierarchical approaches to governance seem to become more and more obsolete. This is especially the case with regard to ´problematic situations´ that have a large spatial and environmental impact. For example, the planning, design and development of infrastructure networks have such a widespread, trans-sectoral impact, that a top down approach is considered to be no longer viable. The impact of large scale projects (such as the Betuwelijn, the development of the Tweede Maasvlakte or the High Speed Train Network) spreads into spatial, environmental, financial, legal, economic (with regard to exploitation and maintenance) and social aspects of everyday life. As a consequence, it is more and more to be considered as ´a normal procedure´ to at least consult the stakeholders concerned. The almost inevitable involvement of large groups of stakeholders with different characteristics cannot be achieved with hierarchical approaches to governance. Top down is assumed to be inappropriate and thus, un-called for in these types of policy processes. Following this widely accepted assumption, consensual approaches are designed and implemented, under various appealing banners, such as co-production, open planning processes and participatory policy making. These appealing names lead to innovative forms of interaction and participation of stakeholders. Stakeholders are enticed to participate in design workshops, brainstorms, coffee table talks, internet based discussions and surveys and market consultations. Stakeholders are invited to information centres and travelling exhibitions. All these efforts are undertaken {{based on the assumption that}} (this time) ´government will really listen and make effective use of all ideas, concerns and energy´. The question arises how effective and efficient these participatory efforts have been thus far. Is a consensual style of governance a solution for the ever increasing complexity of the impact of large scale infrastructural projects? Or has the hierarchical style still have some value for this type of policy processes? And if so, what kind value is this? And in addition, can hierarchical and consensual styles of governance simultaneously be helpful in planning, design and development of infrastructural networks, and if so, how and to what extend? Or must they be considered to be ´natural enemies´ with regard to designing and implementing policy processes? In this paper these questions will be addressed by assessing a (virtual) case study, the further advancement of the road infrastructure network around the city of Rotterdam (also known as the Rotterdamse Ruit). Subsequently we will discuss the two dominant styles of governance, the hierarchical and consensual style. Second, we will describe the role and value of <b>hierarchical</b> (<b>top</b> down) and consensual (bottom up) approaches in planning, designing and development of (road) infrastructural networks and projects. Third, we will make an attempt to combine both approaches, into a hybrid, cross over like, approach that incorporates both hierarchical and consensual approaches in governance. And fourth, we will apply (test) our hybrid, cross over approach to our (virtual) case study, thus proposing an approach for future governance to support the further advancement of the (road) infrastructure network in and around Rotterdam. ...|$|E

By classifying TFs in the yeast regulatory network into three <b>hierarchical</b> layers (<b>top,</b> core, and bottom) and integrating diverse genome-scale datasets, we find that the TFs have static and dynamic properties that are similar within a layer and different across layers. At the protein level, the top-layer TFs are relatively abundant, long-lived, and noisy compared with the core- and bottom-layer TFs. Although variability in expression of top-layer TFs might confer a selective advantage, as this permits at least some members in a clonal cell population to initiate a response to changing conditions, tight regulation of the core- and bottom-layer TFs may minimize noise propagation and ensure fidelity in regulation. We propose that the interplay between network organization and TF dynamics could permit differential utilization of the same underlying network by distinct members of a clonal cell population...|$|R

Increasing {{evidence indicates that}} these `transcriptional regulatory networks' (TRNs) in bacteria have an inherently hierarchical architecture, although the design principles and the specific advantages offered by this type of organization {{have not yet been}} fully elucidated. In this study, we focussed on the hierarchical structure of the TRN of the gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis and performed a comparative analysis with the TRN of the gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli. Using a graph-theoretic approach, we organized the transcription factors (TFs) and sigma-factors in the TRNs of B. subtilis and E. coli into three <b>hierarchical</b> levels (<b>Top,</b> Middle and Bottom) and studied several structural and functional properties across them. In addition to many similarities, we found also specific differences, explaining the majority of them with variations in the distribution of s-factors across the hierarchical levels in the two organisms. We then investigated the control of target metabolic genes by transcriptional regulators to characterize the differential regulation of three distinct metabolic subsystems (catabolism, anabolism and central energy metabolism). These results suggest that the hierarchical architecture that we observed in B. subtilis represents an effective organization of its TRN to achieve flexibility in response {{to a wide range of}} diverse stimuli...|$|R

We need systems which can organize this information and present it in a coherent fashion. These systems should also be flexible, enabling the user to tailor the results to his or her own needs. Current solutions such as summarization are static and lack coherent organization. Even structured solutions such as timelines are inflexible. These problems become increasingly important as the size of the information grows. I propose a new approach to scaling up summarization called hierarchical summarization, which emphasizes organization and flexibility. In a <b>hierarchical</b> summary, the <b>top</b> level gives the most general overview of the information, and each subsequent level gives more detail. Hierarchical summarization allows the user to understand at a high level the most important information, and then explore what is most interesting to him or her without being overwhelmed by information. In this work, I formalize the characteristics necessary for good hierarchical summaries and provide algorithms to generate them. I perform user studies which demonstrate the value of hierarchical summaries over competing methods on datasets much larger than used for traditional summarization...|$|R
