5|$|Non-surgical {{treatment}} is rarely an option {{as the ability}} for articular cartilage to heal is limited. As a result, even moderate cases require some form of surgery. When possible, non-operative forms of management such as protected reduced or non-weight bearing and <b>immobilization</b> are used. Surgical treatment includes arthroscopic drilling of intact lesions, securing of cartilage flap lesions with pins or screws, drilling and replacement of cartilage plugs, stem cell transplantation, and joint replacement. After surgery rehabilitation is usually a two-stage process of <b>immobilization</b> and physical therapy. Most rehabilitation programs combine efforts to protect the joint with muscle strengthening and range of motion. During the <b>immobilization</b> period, isometric exercises, such as straight leg raises, are commonly used to restore muscle loss without disturbing the cartilage of the affected joint. Once the <b>immobilization</b> period has ended, physical therapy involves continuous passive motion (CPM) and/or low impact activities, such as walking or swimming.|$|E
5|$|A {{diagnosis}} of rhabdomyolysis may be suspected in {{anyone who has}} suffered trauma, crush injury or prolonged <b>immobilization,</b> {{but it may also}} be identified at a later stage due to deteriorating kidney function (abnormally raised or increasing creatinine and urea levels, falling urine output) or reddish-brown discoloration of the urine.|$|E
5|$|A {{rehabilitation}} program often involves {{protection of the}} compromised articular surface and underlying subchondral bone combined with maintenance of strength and range of motion. Post-operative analgesics, namely a mix of opioids and NSAIDs, are usually required to control pain, inflammation and swelling. Straight leg raising and other isometric exercises are encouraged during the post-operative or <b>immobilization</b> period. A six to eight-week home or formal physical therapy program is usually instituted once the <b>immobilization</b> period has ended, incorporating range of motion, stretching, progressive strengthening, and functional or sport-specific training. During this time, patients are advised to avoid running and jumping, but are permitted to perform low impact activities, such as walking or swimming. If patients return to activity before the cartilage has become firm, they will typically complain of pain during maneuvers such as squatting or jumping.|$|E
5|$|Candidates for non-operative {{treatment}} {{are limited to}} skeletally immature teenagers with a relatively small, intact lesion {{and the absence of}} loose bodies. Non-operative management may include activity modification, protected weight bearing (partial or non-weight bearing), and <b>immobilization.</b> The goal of non-operative intervention is to promote healing in the subchondral bone and prevent potential chondral collapse, subsequent fracture, and crater formation.|$|E
5|$|Emergency medical {{technician}} â€“ Also known as Ambulance Technician. Technicians are usually {{able to perform}} {{a wide range of}} emergency care skills, such as defibrillation, spinal <b>immobilization,</b> bleeding control, splinting of suspected fractures, assisting the patient with certain medications, and oxygen therapy. Some countries split this term into levels (such as in the US, where there is EMT-Basic and EMT-Intermediate).|$|E
5|$|Founded in 2015, Donecle, a Toulouse {{start-up}} company, {{has also}} launched a drone approach which was initially specialized in {{the detection of}} lightning strikes on aeroplanes. Performed by five people equipped with harnesses and platforms, this inspection usually takes about eight hours. The <b>immobilization</b> of the aircraft and the staff are costly for the airlines, estimated at $10 000 per hour. The solution proposed by the start-up lasts twenty minutes.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{care in the}} hospital, as in the prehospital setting, aims {{to ensure}} {{adequate}} airway, breathing, cardiovascular function, and spinal <b>immobilization.</b> Imaging of the spine to ascertain presence of SCI may need to wait if emergency surgery is needed to stabilize a life-threatening injury. Acute SCI merits treatment in an intensive care unit, especially injuries to the cervival spinal cord. Patients with SCI need repeated neurological assessments and treatment by neurosurgeons.|$|E
5|$|Some {{risk factors}} {{influence}} {{the location of}} DVT within the body. In isolated distal DVT, the profile of risk factors appears distinct from proximal DVT. Transient factors, such as surgery and <b>immobilization,</b> appear to dominate, whereas thrombophilias and age {{do not seem to}} increase risk. In upper-extremity DVT, the most important risk factor is having a central venous catheter, and thoracic outlet syndrome also increases risk.|$|E
25|$|An E.U. {{contract}} for <b>immobilization</b> a polluted area of 20.000 m3 in BAKAR Croatia based on Solidification/Stabilization with ImmoCem {{is currently in}} progress. After 3 years of intensive research by the Croatian government the E.U. funded the <b>immobilization</b> project in BAKAR. The area is contaminated with large amounts of TPH, PAH and metals. For the <b>immobilization</b> the contractor chose to use the mix-in-plant procedure.|$|E
25|$|The {{object of}} {{pressure}} <b>immobilization</b> is to contain venom within a bitten limb and {{prevent it from}} moving through the lymphatic system to the vital organs. This therapy has two components: pressure to prevent lymphatic drainage, and <b>immobilization</b> of the bitten limb to prevent the pumping action of the skeletal muscles.|$|E
25|$|In general, <b>immobilization</b> causes {{bone loss}} (following the 'use it or lose it' rule). For example, {{localized}} osteoporosis can occur after prolonged <b>immobilization</b> of a fractured limb in a cast. This {{is also more}} common in active people with a high bone turn-over (for example, athletes). Other examples include bone loss during space flight or in people who are bedridden or use wheelchairs for various reasons.|$|E
25|$|As of 2008, {{clinical}} evidence for pressure <b>immobilization</b> via {{the use of}} an elastic bandage is limited. It is recommended for snakebites that have occurred in Australia (due to elapids which are neurotoxic). It is not recommended for bites from non-neurotoxic snakes such as those found in North America and other regions of the world. The British military recommends pressure <b>immobilization</b> in all cases where the type of snake is unknown.|$|E
25|$|Regardless {{of which}} {{approach}} is employed (nonsurgical, CRPP, or ORIF), <b>immobilization</b> {{in a cast}} or thumb spica splint is required for four to six weeks.|$|E
25|$|Snakebite {{first aid}} {{recommendations}} vary, {{in part because}} different snakes have different types of venom. Some have little local effect, but life-threatening systemic effects, in which case containing the venom {{in the region of}} the bite by pressure <b>immobilization</b> is desirable. Other venoms instigate localized tissue damage around the bitten area, and <b>immobilization</b> may increase the severity of the damage in this area, but also reduce the total area affected; whether this trade-off is desirable remains a point of controversy. Because snakes vary from one country to another, first aid methods also vary.|$|E
25|$|Most hip {{fractures}} {{are treated}} surgically by implanting an orthosis. Surgical treatment outweighs {{the risks of}} nonsurgical treatment which requires extensive bedrest. Prolonged <b>immobilization</b> increases risk of thromboembolism, pneumonia, deconditioning, and decubitus ulcers. Regardless, the surgery is a major stress, particularly in the elderly. Pain is also significant, and can also result in <b>immobilization,</b> so patients are encouraged to become mobile as soon as possible, often {{with the assistance of}} physical therapy. Skeletal traction pending surgery is not supported by the evidence. Regional nerve blocks are useful for pain management in hip fractures.|$|E
25|$|Prolonged <b>immobilization</b> and {{difficulty}} moving {{make it hard}} to avoid pressure sores on the sacrum and heels of patients with hip fractures. Whenever possible, early mobilization is advocated; otherwise, alternating pressure mattresses should be used.|$|E
25|$|Snake venom {{is highly}} {{modified}} saliva containing zootoxins which facilitates the <b>immobilization</b> and digestion of prey, and defends against threats. It is injected by unique fangs after a bite, and some species are {{also able to}} spit.|$|E
25|$|In {{the most}} minor cases of Bennett fracture, {{there may be}} only small {{avulsion}} fractures, relatively little joint instability, and minimal subluxation of the CMC joint (less than 1mm). In such cases, closed reduction followed by <b>immobilization</b> in a thumb spica cast and serial radiography may be all that is required for effective treatment.|$|E
25|$|Treatment of bone {{fractures}} are broadly {{classified as}} surgical or conservative, the latter basically referring to any non-surgical procedure, such as pain management, <b>immobilization</b> or other non-surgical stabilization. A similar classification is open versus closed treatment, in which open treatment refers to any treatment {{in which the}} fracture site is opened surgically, {{regardless of whether the}} fracture is an open or closed fracture.|$|E
25|$|Males of {{some species}} {{are able to}} {{immobilize}} females and force copulation. In pigs and boars, males grab females and maneuver the pelvis to lift the vaginal opening and facilitate copulation. The stimulation following intromission causes the female to be immobilized. The male can then freely continue copulation without worrying about the female escaping. <b>Immobilization</b> of the female also occurs in muscovy ducks.|$|E
25|$|By {{integrating}} {{synthetic biology}} approaches with materials sciences, {{it would be}} possible to envision cells as microscopic molecular foundries to produce materials with properties that can be genetically encoded. Recent advances towards this include the re-engineering of curli fibers, the amyloid component of extracellular material of biofilms, as a platform for programmable nanomaterial. These nanofibers have been genetically constructed for specific functions, including: adhesion to substrates; nanoparticle templating; and protein <b>immobilization.</b>|$|E
25|$|From late April 2005 {{to early}} June of that year, Opportunity was perilously lodged in a sand dune, with several wheels {{buried in the}} sand. Over a six-week period Earth-based {{physical}} simulations were performed to decide how best to extract the rover from its position without risking a permanent <b>immobilization</b> of the valuable vehicle. Successful maneuvering a few centimeters at a time eventually freed the rover, which resumed its travels.|$|E
25|$|Builds soil {{organic matter}} {{at the expense of}} plant productivity. In the absence of tillage, and in soils with {{depleted}} organic matter, crops with large root systems may build up organic matter to the point that nearly all of the soil nitrogen and phosphorus is immobilized. When this happens, productivity may decline until either the organic matter builds up to a level where equilibrium is reached between nutrient mineralization and nutrient <b>immobilization</b> or fertilizer is added to the system.|$|E
25|$|During her German tour, {{she began}} to suffer agonizing pain in her right knee, {{probably}} connected with a fall she had suffered on stage during her tour in South America. She was forced to reduce her movements in L'Aiglon. A German doctor recommended that she halt the tour immediately and have surgery, followed by six months of complete <b>immobilization</b> of her leg. Bernhardt promised {{to see a doctor}} when she returned to Paris, but continued the tour.|$|E
25|$|Routine {{treatment}} {{should include}} <b>immobilization</b> {{of the affected}} limb, application of ice, local wound care, and tetanus prophylaxis. Many other therapies have been used {{with varying degrees of}} success, including hyperbaric oxygen, dapsone, antihistamines (e.g., cyproheptadine), antibiotics, dextran, glucocorticoids, vasodilators, heparin, nitroglycerin, electric shock, curettage, surgical excision, and antivenom. None of these treatments have been subjected to randomized controlled trials to conclusively show benefit. In almost all cases, bites are self-limited and typically heal without any medical intervention.|$|E
25|$|Ioannis Tsoukalas of Stockholm University has {{hypothesized}} that REM sleep is an evolutionary transformation of a well-known defensive mechanism, the tonic immobility reflex. This reflex, {{also known as}} animal hypnosis or death feigning, functions as {{the last line of}} defense against an attacking predator and consists of the total <b>immobilization</b> of the animal so that it appears dead. Tsoukalas argues that the neurophysiology and phenomenology of this reaction shows striking similarities to REM sleep; for example, both reactions exhibit brainstem control, paralysis, hypocampal theta rhythm, and thermoregulatory changes.|$|E
25|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{origin of}} theory of mind remains obscure. While many theories make claims about {{its role in}} the development of human language and social cognition few of them specify in detail any evolutionary neurophysiological precursors. A recent theory claims that ToM has its roots in two defensive reactions, namely <b>immobilization</b> stress and tonic immobility, which are implicated in the handling of stressful encounters and also figure prominently in mammalian childrearing practices (Tsoukalas, 2017). Their combined effect seems capable of producing many of the hallmarks of theory of mind, e.g., eye-contact, gaze-following, inhibitory control and intentional attributions.|$|E
25|$|After the biceps-to-triceps surgery the patientâ€™s arm is immobilized for 3,5 {{weeks in}} slight flexion, this only counts for patient who could fully extend their arm before the operation. Otherwise {{the patient is}} immobilized in maximum {{extension}} and casted. This stays on for 10â€“14 days and a second cast is applied in further extension. After the <b>immobilization</b> the patient is given a protective polyaxial brace, which allows the patient to begin active limited flexion and still keep the full extension. This brace is worn by day and at night the patient wears a semi-firm splint that keeps the arm in maximal extension.|$|E
25|$|The androgenic:anabolic {{ratio of}} an AAS is an {{important}} factor when determining the clinical application of these compounds. Compounds with a high ratio of androgenic to an anabolic effects are the drug of choice in androgen-replacement therapy (e.g., treating hypogonadism in males), whereas compounds with a reduced androgenic:anabolic ratio are preferred for anemia and osteoporosis, and to reverse protein loss following trauma, surgery, or prolonged <b>immobilization.</b> Determination of androgenic:anabolic ratio is typically performed in animal studies, which has led to the marketing of some compounds claimed to have anabolic activity with weak androgenic effects. This disassociation is less marked in humans, where all AAS have significant androgenic effects.|$|E
25|$|In {{almost all}} cases, recluse bites are self-limited and {{typically}} heal without any medical intervention. Recommendations {{to limit the}} extent of damage include elevation and <b>immobilization</b> of the affected limb, application of ice. Both local wound care, and tetanus prophylaxis are simple standards. There is no established treatment for more extensive necrosis. Many therapies have been used including hyperbaric oxygen, dapsone, antihistamines (e.g., cyproheptadine), antibiotics, dextran, glucocorticoids, vasodilators, heparin, nitroglycerin, electric shock, curettage, surgical excision, and antivenom. None of these treatments conclusively show benefit. Studies have shown surgical intervention is ineffective and may worsen outcome. Excision may delay wound healing, cause abscesses, and lead to objectionable scarring.|$|E
25|$|Primary {{fermentation}} {{usually takes}} 2856 days, {{after which the}} must is placed in a secondary fermentation vessel for 6â€“9 months of aging. Durations of primary and secondary fermentation producing satisfactory mead may vary considerably according to numerous factors, such as floral origin of the honey and its natural sugar and microorganism contents, must water percentage, pH, additives used, and strain of yeast, among others. Although supplementation of the must with nitrogen, salt or vitamins has been tested to improve mead qualities, {{there is no evidence}} that adding nutrients reduced fermentation time or improved quality. Cell <b>immobilization</b> methods, however, proved effective for enhancing mead quality.|$|E
25|$|Currently, {{neurotrophic}} {{factors are}} being intensely studied {{for use in}} bioartificial nerve conduits because they are necessary in vivo for directing axon growth and regeneration. In studies, neurotrophic factors are normally {{used in conjunction with}} other techniques such as biological and physical cues created by the addition of cells and specific topographies. The neurotrophic factors {{may or may not be}} immobilized to the scaffold structure, though <b>immobilization</b> is preferred because it allows for the creation of permanent, controllable gradients. In some cases, such as neural drug delivery systems, they are loosely immobilized such that they can be selectively released at specified times and in specified amounts. Drug delivery is the next step beyond the basic addition of growth factors to nerve guidance conduits.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the large}} size and extreme <b>immobilization</b> some casts, {{particularly}} {{those used in}} or before the 1970s, the popular term full body cast {{is something of a}} misnomer. The popular and media-driven conception of a massive cast encasing all four limbs, the trunk, and the head â€“ sometimes leaving only small slits for the eyes, nose, and mouth â€“ is a true rarity in recorded medical history, and this type of large scale cast appears more commonly in various Hollywood movies and on television shows. The term body cast (or full body cast) is sometimes casually used by laymen to describe any of a number of body and/or spica casts, from a simple body jacket to a more extensive hip spica.|$|E
25|$|Proof of {{improved}} survival benefit from {{either of these}} two techniques over conventional radiation therapy (2DXRT) is growing for many tumor sites, but the ability to reduce toxicity is generally accepted. This is particularly the case for head and neck cancers {{in a series of}} pivotal trials performed by Professor Christopher Nutting of the Royal Marsden Hospital. Both techniques enable dose escalation, potentially increasing usefulness. There has been some concern, particularly with IMRT, about increased exposure of normal tissue to radiation and the consequent potential for secondary malignancy. Overconfidence in the accuracy of imaging may increase the chance of missing lesions that are invisible on the planning scans (and therefore not included in the treatment plan) or that move between or during a treatment (for example, due to respiration or inadequate patient <b>immobilization).</b> New techniques are being developed to better control this uncertaintyâ€”for example, real-time imaging combined with real-time adjustment of the therapeutic beams. This new technology is called image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) or four-dimensional radiation therapy.|$|E
25|$|While {{dealing with}} crisis, both {{personal}} and societal, there are five basic principles outlined for intervention. Victims are initially {{at high risk for}} maladaptive coping or <b>immobilization.</b> Intervening as quickly as possible is imperative. Resource mobilization should be immediately enacted in order to provide victims with the tools they need to return to some sort of order and normalcy, in addition to enable eventual independent functioning. The next step is to facilitate understanding of the event by processing the situation or trauma. This is done in order to help the victim {{gain a better understanding of}} what has occurred and allowing him or her to express feeling about the experience. Additionally, the counselor should assist the victim(s) in problem solving within the context of their situation and feelings. This is necessary for developing self-efficacy and self-reliance. Helping the victim get back to being able to function independently by actively facilitating problem solving, assisting in developing appropriate strategies for addressing those concerns, and in helping putting those strategies into action. This is done in hopes of assisting the victim to become self-reliant.|$|E
25|$|Although these {{bandages}} were {{an improvement}} over Larreyâ€™s method, they were far from ideal. They required {{a long time to}} apply and dry and there was often shrinkage and distortion. A great deal of interest had been aroused in Europe around 1800 by a British diplomat, consul William Eton, who described a method of treating fractures that he had observed in Turkey. He noted that gypsum plaster (plaster of Paris) was moulded around the patientâ€™s leg to cause <b>immobilization.</b> If the cast became loose due to atrophy or a reduction in swelling, then additional gypsum plaster was added to fill the space. Adapting the use of plaster of Paris for use in hospitals, however, took some time. In 1828, doctors in Berlin were treating leg fractures by aligning the bones in a long narrow box which was then filled with moist sand. The substitution of plaster of Paris for the sand was the next logical step. Such plaster casts did not succeed however as the patient was confined to bed due to the casts being heavy and cumbersome.|$|E
