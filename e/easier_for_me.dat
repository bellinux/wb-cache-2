500|$|Stevenson {{described}} {{the character of}} Marion as [...] "cranky, stubborn and lonely", saying that living alone has made her [...] "become quite idiotic and eccentric". When the character of April arrives, Stevenson explains that [...] "Marion has to go from nought to 80 in terms of parenting. There are lots of reasons she wouldn't get it right" [...] which leads on to the guilt and anxiety that Marion suffers when April runs away. Stevenson compared her own difficulties of parenting to Marion's, saying [...] "it is <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> than someone like Marion because I have had 14 years experience". Richards spoke {{of the character of}} April, saying that [...] "the residential schools and children's homes were completely different from my life.

500|$|On 24 June, Pirlo {{produced}} a Man of the Match {{performance in the}} quarter-finals against England, as Italy won 4–2 on penalties after the game had finished 0–0 in extra time. Pirlo scored in the shoot-out with an audacious chipped penalty down {{the centre of the}} goal, also known as a Panenka. Following the match Pirlo spoke of his eloquent penalty, stating, [...] "At the moment I saw the goalkeeper making strange movements, so I waited for him to move and hit it like that... It was <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to chip it at that stage. Maybe my effort put some pressure on England." [...] Pirlo completed more passes than the entire England midfield, as he managed 131 passes, the most of any player during the match, and the second most in a single match {{in the history of the}} European Championship, behind Xavi, with an 87% pass completion rate, as Italy finished the match with 63% ball possession. He also ran 11.58 kilometres throughout the match, covering more distance than any England player.|$|E
500|$|Debbage comments, [...] "One {{strength}} of Bradley Joseph {{as an artist}} has been his keen ability to write inspiring music with appropriately titled songs that express that thought non-verbally". [...] Joseph explained to Janus that, [...] "Through instrumental music, I'm allowed {{to come up with}} musical ideas that allow the listener to create their own impression of my song. If you add lyrics about a girl in the song, the listener doesn't have a choice of what the song is about, it's told to them. My musical writings allow me to express anything. [...] It's <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to tell a story of something I've encountered this way than to verbalize it. [...] And my feelings are explored more in my compositions compared to what I could ever say in a few sentences." [...] He believes that [...] "music allows a person to express their deepest thoughts, thoughts that cannot be expressed with just words." [...] He also believes that the spiritual aspect of creating is to [...] "find something deep within yourself that can only be created by you"..."Your spiritual self cannot be copied and that's why it's so significant in life and music", he says. [...] Parsons goes on to say, [...] "The influence of years of touring with Yanni is apparent in the richness of Joseph's sound, but his musical voice is his own." [...] Yanni once said, [...] "Bradley, your extreme sensitivity is your greatest gift". Joseph later realized what Yanni meant was that he needed that as a composer, that it was a crucial component [...] "to be sensitive to what you see {{and to be able to}} apply that to music".|$|E

2500|$|Rodríguez co-directed Sin City (2005), an {{adaptation}} of the Frank Miller Sin City comic books; Quentin Tarantino guest-directed a scene. During production in 2004, Rodríguez insisted Miller to be credited as co-director, because he considered the visual style of Miller's comic art {{to be just as}} important as his own in the film. However, the Directors Guild of America would not allow it, citing that only [...] "legitimate teams", e.g., the Wachowskis, could share the director's credit. Rodríguez chose to resign from the DGA, stating, [...] "It was <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to quietly resign before shooting because otherwise I'd be forced to make compromises I was unwilling to make or set a precedent that might hurt the guild later on." [...] By resigning from the DGA, Rodríguez was forced to relinquish his director's seat on the film John Carter of Mars for Paramount Pictures. Rodríguez had already signed on and had been announced as director of that film, planning to begin filming soon after completing Sin City.|$|E
