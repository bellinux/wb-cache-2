Few countries permit their corporations to choose among two or more sets of competing standards; monopoly is the reigning norm. This paper examines regulatory competition {{as a model for}} writing and implementing corporate financial standards. Under this model, two or more approved standard-setting bodies are allowed to compete for the allegiance of the reporting entities. Each corporation can choose which of the two or more sets of competing standards it wishes to use in preparing its financial reports. Corporations must choose an entire set of standards in toto, clearly mark the reports with the set of standards used to prepare them, and pay a fee to the body who wrote the standards. We examine the consequences of such regulatory competition for the quality and efficiency of standards, quality of information provided to shareholders and other interested parties, and the efficiency of corporate governance...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} dominant conventions of architectural {{practice in the}} United States between 1919 and 1933. It proceeds from two assumptions: first, that by the 1900 s, both the American Institute of Architects (AlA) and the numerous professional journals available to architects across the country solidified the profession nationally and yielded a coherent field within which practitioners could debate {{the content of their}} professional service; second, that within the context of its national discourse, the architecture profession drew inspiration for its effort to identify a social <b>function</b> <b>for</b> <b>itself</b> from the White City Movement which forged a link between the architect and a national political, industrial and cultural leadership drawn together by American Progressivism. The study focuses on the period following the demise of the White City Movement during which American architects cast off their allegiance to its traditional aesthetic formulae but retained the aspiration to associate themselves and their work with prevailing trends in a national political and social milieu. It demonstrates that in their efforts to redefine the terms of their professional service, American architects invoked the popular terminology of Scientific Management, Technocracy, Fordism, and the nostrums of the 'New Era' and promised 'efficiency' in their work and in the industries they presumed to manage. It reveals that within these efforts of professional redefinition, the professional ideology supporting the architect's aspirations for work converged with a modernist idealism espousing the value of technical expertise as a medium of social emancipation and progress. By giving evidence of a widespread and indigenous modernism that perceived a social benefit in the architect's capacity to utilize industrial technology, this project amends the dominant historical view which attributes the re-emergence of an American Modem Movement in the 1930 s to the 'diaspora' of European artists and intellectuals before to WW II. This study has two parts. In Part One, it examines first the canons of Beaux-Arts Classicism and their gradual dissolution after World War I under the pressure of criticism from writers such as Ralph Adams Cram, Louis Sullivan and Lewis Mumford and through the work of the AlA's PostWar Committee; and second, the institutional structure of the AlA and its organizational ideologies in the 1920 s. In Part Two, it looks more closely at the evolving conventions of professional service, demonstrating that American architects reached a consensus about the necessity of a 'new' architecture which identified itself in three areas: first, in its rejection of the Beaux-Arts method of interpreting a building program through a stylistic rendition of its social 'character' in favor of design strategies that maximized usable space; second, in its abandonment of the visual paradigm of the White City in favor of the expansionist rhetoric of Regional Planning; and third, in its disavowal of stylistic conventions based on historical precedent in favor of styles that both demonstrated a discontinuity with the past and celebrated an evolving consumerist 'utopia' populated by industrial commodities. by Paul Louis Bentel.

What introduces us novel educational systems as a modern educational technology rather than a challenge in an educational system is the effects of these technologies in employing teaching aids in classrooms with the aim of reinforcement of the students’ learning, which has been confirmed by numerous studies. Through elucidation of student-oriented approach as a modern approach in educational system, the present paper studies the shift from traditional education to modern education and explains the existing barriers as well as the studies carried out so far.

Each {{has the ability to}} create and control other virtual machines which run in parallel with it. A number of special processes called supervisors exist within the system solely to perform job control functions up to the point at which a new virtual machine is created. After this point the user process, running in the new virtual machine, performs most job control <b>functions</b> <b>for</b> <b>itself.</b> The design is such that job control requirements may be expressed in any programming language supported by the system, so that no job control language is actually necessary.

These MLPG weak forms {{provide the most}} general basis for the nu-merical solution of the non-hyper-singular displacement and traction BIEs [given in Han, and Atluri (2003) ], which are simply derived by using the gradients of {{the displacement}}s of the fundamental solutions [Okada, Ra-jiyah, and Atluri (1989 a,b) ]. By employing {{the various types of}} test functions, in the MLPG-type weak-forms of the non-hyper-singular dBIE and tBIE over the local sub-boundary surfaces, several types of MLPG/BIEs are for-mulated, while also using several types of non-element meshless interpolations <b>for</b> trial <b>functions</b> over the sur-face of the solid. Three specific types of MLPG/BIEs are formulated in the present study, according to three different types of test functions assumed over a local sub-boundary surface, as: a) the weight function in the MLS, for formulating the MLPG/BIE 1; b) a Dirac delta <b>function</b> <b>for</b> formulating the collocation method (MLPG/BIE 2); c) the trial <b>function</b> <b>itself,</b> <b>for</b> formulat-ing the MLPG/BIE 6.

40|$|Toll-like receptors (TLRs) mediate host {{responses}} to bacterial gene products. As the airway epithelium is potentially exposed to many diverse inhaled bacteria, TLRs involved {{in defense of}} the airways must be broadly responsive, available at the exposed apical surface of the cells, and highly regulated to prevent activation following trivial encounters with bacteria. We demonstrate that TLR 2 is enriched in caveolin- 1 –associated lipid raft microdomains presented on the apical surface of airway epithelial cells after bacterial infection. These receptor complexes include myeloid differentiation protein (MyD 88), interleukin- 1 receptor–activated kinase- 1, and TNF receptor–associated factor 6. The signaling capabilities of TLR 2 are amplified through its association with the asialoganglioside gangliotetraosylceramide (Galβ 1, 2 GalNAcβ 1, 4 Galβ 1, 4 Glcβ 1, 1 Cer), which has receptor <b>function</b> <b>itself</b> <b>for</b> many pulmonary pathogens. Ligation of either TLR 2 or asialoGM 1 by ligands with specificity for either receptor, by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, or by Staphylococcus aureus stimulates IL- 8 production through activation of NF-κB, as mediated by TLR 2 and MyD 88. Thus, TLR 2 in association with asialo-glycolipids presented within the context of lipid rafts provides a broadly responsive signaling complex at the apical surfaces of airway cells to initiate the host response to potential bacterial infection...|$|R
