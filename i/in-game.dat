The game uses a free-to-play gaming model: while the game can be downloaded and played for free, players {{have the option of}} spending money on <b>in-game</b> items. The characters' base is a room in a small village: in the room, players can check messages, and set their current equipment and weapons.

Upon leveling up or mastering a piece of equipment, players gain attribute points that can be allotted towards four character attributes: health, attack, shield power, or magic. Each point can only be allocated once and is a permanent upgrade to the character. Players can purchase new equipment using <b>in-game</b> money from sacks and treasure chests found throughout the castle, defeated enemies, and sales of unused equipment. <b>In-game</b> money can be purchased with real money within the game.|$|E
5|$|<b>In-game</b> {{characters}} {{were inspired by}} illustrations from adventure and pirate stories such as Captain Blood (1922), the work of Charles Dana Gibson, and mugshots from Edwardian London and Australia.

Mitton established defining groups for characters such as rich, poor, and hostile with specific anatomy and posture designs, and animators created stylized movements for each social class and specific characters to help convey emotions. The city guards, for example, have small heads, low shoulders, and big hands, with animations that blend human and monkey movements. Antonov and Mitton employed a textile carpet designer in Russia to design and paint some of the <b>in-game</b> art.|$|E
