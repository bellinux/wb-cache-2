50|$|The {{proportion}} of wax esters in the spermaceti organ increases with {{the age of}} the whale: 38-51% in calves, 58-87% in adult females, and 71-94% in adult males. Spermaceti wax is extracted from sperm oil by crystallisation at 6 C, when treated by pressure and a chemical solution of caustic alkali. Spermaceti forms brilliant white crystals that are hard but oily to the touch, and are devoid of taste or smell, making it very useful as an ingredient in cosmetics, leatherworking, and lubricants. The substance was also used in making candles of a standard photometric value, in the <b>dressing</b> <b>of</b> <b>fabrics,</b> and as a pharmaceutical excipient, especially in cerates and ointments. Candlepower, a photometric unit defined in the United Kingdom Act of Parliament Metropolitan Gas Act 1860 and adopted at the International Electrotechnical Conference of 1883, was based on the light produced by a pure spermaceti candle.|$|E
