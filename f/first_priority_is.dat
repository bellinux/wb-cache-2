25|$|Together {{with the}} Doctor, Jamie {{encounters}} Cybermen, Daleks, the Yeti in the London Underground, the Ice Warriors, {{and many other}} dangers. Jamie is particularly fond and protective of Victoria, {{due in part to}} her being an elegant Victorian lady. For example, in The Ice Warriors Jamie's <b>first</b> <b>priority</b> <b>is</b> to rescue Victoria despite being injured {{to the point where he}} can't walk. Jamie is heartbroken when Victoria decides to stay with the Harris family at the end of Fury from the Deep, to the point of even being briefly angry with the Doctor for allowing her to leave (The Wheel in Space). Jamie initially finds Zoe's more modern attitudes and bossy nature irritating, but eventually adopts the same protective attitude disguised by the same bantering he engages in with the Doctor. Often Jamie's simple common sense beats Zoe's strict logic, such as in The Dominators where Jamie realises that the erupting volcano is going to threaten the TARDIS, while the Doctor and Zoe are still congratulating themselves on defeating their enemies.|$|E
