50|$|A {{common theme}} {{of these early}} routes was that rock was climbed to reach <b>free</b> <b>hanging</b> ice falls—ice falls that do not touch the ground. Protection was also mostly {{traditional}} hand placed pegs, nuts and ice screws. This reflects the influences of alpine climbing, mixed climbing, ice climbing of the early innovators.|$|E
5000|$|Cold Steel {{is known}} for their graphic {{marketing}} videos and DVDs (entitled [...] "PROOF") which demonstrate their products' strength, sharpness, edge retention and durability. Featured tests include piercing car hoods, using folding knives as monkey bars, slicing through large free-hanging pieces of meat and bone, and shearing <b>free</b> <b>hanging</b> rope with a single stroke.|$|E
50|$|Onset of {{symptoms}} may be {{after just a}} few minutes, but usually occurs after at least 20 minutes of <b>free</b> <b>hanging.</b> Typical symptoms are pallor, sweating, shortness of breath, blurred vision, dizziness, nausea, hypotension and numbness of the legs. Eventually it leads to fainting, which may result in death due to oxygen deprivation of the brain.|$|E

50|$|The tāniko {{technique}} {{does not}} require a loom, although one can be used. Traditionally <b>free</b> <b>hanging</b> warps were suspended between two weaving pegs and the process involved twining downward. The traditional weaving material is muka, fibre prepared from the New Zealand flax (Phormium tenax) by scraping, pounding and washing. The muka fibre was dyed using natural dyes.|$|E
50|$|The {{structure}} architecturally {{presents a}} monumental appearance {{with a tall}} superstructure, dominating tower, large windows, baluster and wide granite stairs. It has a clean, puritanical appearance with few decorations and an open tower with <b>free</b> <b>hanging</b> bells. The church interior is minimalist with few decorations, a wide hall in the nave and a small elevation to the baptismal font.|$|E
50|$|Very tight {{weight and}} {{dimensional}} tolerances {{can be obtained}} on wheel equipment, as the parison is captured on both ends. It is pinched in the preceding mold on the leading end, and positioned by the stationary flowhead die on the other end. In shuttle machinery and reciprocating screw machinery multiple parisons are extruded and are <b>free</b> <b>hanging.</b> Because there is always some variation in the parison length on these machines, bottle weight and tolerance consistencies are not as tight as on rotary wheel machinery.|$|E

Najada is the 3rd runner-up of the first season of Big Brother Albania.|$|R
50|$|It is {{distinct}} from the mustard plants which belong to the genus Brassica. S. officinale is similar to other Sisymbrium, but differs in its tall, erect stems with tiny flowers and fruits that are compacted parallel to the stem instead of <b>hanging</b> <b>free.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Unsurprisingly {{the rise}} in {{standards}} was reflected in a surge of interest in competitions on purpose built climbing structures. These competitions mixed ice climbing with dry tooling on artificial features such as resin climbing holds, <b>free</b> <b>hanging</b> wooden logs/ ice bollards and even bicycle frames. Each year The Ice Climbing World Cup is held {{at a number of}} venues around the world from Switzerland to Russia. What was claimed to be the [...] "World's First Indoor Dry Tooling Competition" [...] was held in Glasgow, Scotland in March, 2003.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} tubes, {{like the}} Deforest Spherical Audion from c. 1911, used the typical light bulb Edison socket for the heater, and flying leads {{for the other}} elements. Other tubes directly used flying leads for all of their contacts, like the Cunningham AudioTron from 1915, or the Deforest Oscillion. Type C6A xenon thyratrons, used in servos for the U.S. Navy Stable Element Mark 6, had a mogul screw base and L-shaped stiff wires at the top for grid and anode connections. Mating connectors were machined pairs of brass blocks with clamping screws, attached to flying leads (<b>free</b> <b>hanging).</b>|$|E
50|$|Arisaema thunbergii subsp. urashima is a {{herbaceous}} perennial plant. It {{is widespread}} through the woodlands of Japan, especially near the coast. The plant {{has a very}} curious inflorescence, and is popular in horticulture. As with all arisaemas, the inflorescence consists of a spathe tube enclosing a spadix appendix. In the case of A. thunbergi subsp. urashima, the spadix appendix is elongated into a <b>free</b> <b>hanging</b> thread of 45 to 60 cm. The underground tuber often produces offsets, which can be removed and grown on. The foliage dies down by summer, leaving the fruiting spike to ripen in autumn. The red berries contain high amounts of oxalic acid, and can cause painful irritation to the skin. All parts of the plant should be considered poisonous.|$|E
60|$|Encouraged {{by these}} cries, the young aristocrat {{advanced}} upon his man. The smith never moved, but his mouth set grim and hard, while his tufted brows came {{down over his}} keen, grey eyes. The tongs had fallen, and his hands were <b>hanging</b> <b>free.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A good {{golf swing}} starts with proper posture. Having a proper posture means {{standing}} upright {{with a relatively}} straight back and slightly bent knees. When a golfer takes the stance, {{the width of the}} stance should be about shoulder wide and arms should be <b>hanging</b> <b>free.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Simon Holmes, {{played by}} Justin Shenkarow, is Marshall’s best friend. Due to the {{constant}} arguing between Simon’s parents, he chooses {{to spend most of}} his <b>free</b> time <b>hanging</b> out with Marshall. Prior to Marshall's arrival, Simon was a lonely child, as most of his peers in Eerie shun him. Similar to Marshall, Simon believes that something is afoul in Eerie. In the episode [...] "America's Scariest Home Video", it is revealed that Simon has a younger brother, Harley Schwarzenegger Holmes, who was never mentioned before and never appears again.|$|R
50|$|Knud Friis {{owned the}} {{architect}} firm Friis & Moltke {{with his partner}} Elmar Moltke and they collaborated on most of their projects including their private residences in the Aarhus area. In 1957 Knud Friis and his wife bought a 3000 m2 parcel of land {{on top of a}} hill overlooking Brabrand Lake and decided to build their new home there. The original house was built in 1958 and consisted of two parallel wings oriented north to south and connected by two walls that isolates a paved courtyard between the structures. The structure of the main building is formed by the two white garden walls which carry the 1st floor concrete walls which appear like <b>free</b> <b>hanging</b> beams along the width of the garden.|$|E
5000|$|Peter Mollica {{received}} his formal training making traditional Gothic Style {{stained glass windows}} during an apprenticeship to the Chris Rufo Studio in Somerville, MA (1964-1968). [...] In 1968 he relocated to Berkeley, California and opened his own studio. In 1979 the studio moved to Oakland. He has fabricated windows for the National Cathedral in Washington, D.C. and The Oakland Federal Building and both designed and fabricated works for west coast libraries, churches and homes. His <b>free</b> <b>hanging</b> glass panels have been widely exhibited and collected. He {{is the author of}} Stained Glass Primer, an authoritative how-to guide to stained glass technique, used widely by hobbyists and professionals since first published in 1971. Mollica has regularly taught design workshops in the San Francisco Bay Area, Mendocino, CA, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada and Nagano City, Japan.|$|E
50|$|Leen van Zandvliet, Feyenoord's {{president}} in the 1930s, {{came up with the}} idea of building an entirely new stadium, unlike any other on the continent, with two <b>free</b> <b>hanging</b> tiers and no obstacles blocking the view. Contemporary examples were Highbury, where the West and East stands had been recently built as a double deck, and Yankee Stadium in New York. Johannes Brinkman and Leendert van der Vlugt, the famous designers of the van Nelle factories in Rotterdam were asked to design a stadium out of glass, concrete and steel, cheap materials at that time. In fact, De Kuip acted as an example for many of the greatest stadia we know today, e.g. Camp Nou. The stadium was co-financed by the billionaire Daniël George van Beuningen, who made his fortune in World War I, exporting coal from Germany to Britain through neutral Netherlands.|$|E
50|$|The wool of the Teeswater {{should be}} fine, long-stapled with high lustre with each lock <b>hanging</b> <b>free</b> {{and with no}} {{tendency}} to felt. There should be no dark fibers in the fleece, which should be uniform in texture over the whole body. The Teeswater produces a kemp free fleece, a characteristic it passes on.|$|R
50|$|The {{salamander}} has {{a prolonged}} breeding season and may breed throughout the year. An average of 109 eggs are laid {{alone or in}} clusters of two to five on the undersides of root, branches, and rocks, <b>hanging</b> <b>free</b> in the current. Eggs are pigmented, measure 9.9 mm, and are encased in three capsules, including a thick outer capsule.|$|R
50|$|The Kopassus (RPKAD) {{military}} freefall wing insignia, {{designed by}} HH.Djajadiningrat and first issued in 1962 depicts a <b>free</b> fall paratrooper <b>hanging</b> under a circle consisting of small parachutes. Stated {{by the first}} free fall instructors of the Yugoslavia: Mladen Milicetic, Stoyan Jovic and Dobel Stanej in Bandung during the first free fall graduation ceremony of Kopassus (RPKAD) in October 26, 1962.|$|R
5000|$|In some {{contexts}} {{the term}} [...] "simple suspension bridge" [...] refers not {{to this type}} of bridge but rather to a suspended deck bridge that is [...] "simple" [...] in that its deck is not stiffened. [...] Although simple suspension bridges and [...] "simple" [...] suspended deck bridges are similar in many respects, they differ in their physics. On a simple suspension bridge, the main cables (or chains) follow a hyperbolic curve, the catenary. This is because the main cables are <b>free</b> <b>hanging.</b> In contrast, on a suspended deck bridge (whether [...] "simple" [...] or not) the main cables follow a parabolic curve. This is because the main cables are tied at uniform intervals to the bridge deck below (see suspension bridge curve). The differences between these two curves was a question of importance in the 17th century, worked on by Isaac Newton among others.|$|E
50|$|In plan, a broad un-paneled off-center {{front hall}} is lighted {{from the window}} {{to the right of the}} front (north) door. The fully paneled stair hall at the rear is {{narrower}} on axis. In this rear hall is an exceptionally fine carved walnut staircase, with scrolled step ends and handrail, winding around an offset newel post in the bottom. Paneling on the wall echoes the contour of its gracefully curved banister and fluted end posts. A visual separation between front and rear hall is achieved by an unusual double arch without a supporting post in the middle. The <b>free</b> <b>hanging</b> impost of the arches is adorned by a tulip ornament and hanging candle light, not unlike the carved pendant in a similar position in Gunston Hall, Virginia, designed b William Buckland at this sale time. To the right of the stair is a very fine corner cupboard with a large carved shell ornament. To the right of the front hall is a small un-paneled reception room and in the rear, also to the right of the stair hall, is a larger un-paneled dining room. These two rooms are connected by a small passage from which, against the interior chimney, arises an extremely narrow service stair, as at Stenton.|$|E
5000|$|At the New York Knife Show in 1981, {{the first}} Master bladesmith ratings were awarded to: Bill Bagwell, Jimmy Fikes, Don Fogg, Don Hastings, Bill Moran, and James Schmidt. Years later, tests were {{established}} for a maker {{to attain a}} rating of [...] "Master smith." [...] The tests for Master smith include using a forged Damascus steel blade {{with a minimum of}} 300 layers and fashioned as a [...] "stick tang knife" [...] (as opposed to a full-tang) to cut a <b>free</b> <b>hanging</b> rope, chop through 2 2X4" [...] pieces of lumber, and retain an edge capable of shaving hair. Lastly, the knife is placed into a vise and flexed for 90 degrees. The knife must spring back without breaking, must remain functional, and must not slip from the handle. Once the performance test is passed, the applicant must submit 5 knives to a panel of judges, all knives are judged on balance, beauty, and symmetry, but one must be either an [...] "Art Knife" [...] or a [...] "European style" [...] dagger. The first smith to receive the Master title under these requirements was Wayne Goddard. Wyoming knifemaker Audra Draper became the first woman to hold a Master smith title in 1999. Knifemakers who have attained this title frequently use the suffix [...] "MS" [...] when informing the public about their knives.|$|E
40|$|Some genetically {{determined}} traits, such as ear lobes, finger {{hair and}} hairy car were studied in 89 schizophrenic patients and compared with normals. The proportion of schizophrenic males having earlobes <b>hanging</b> <b>free</b> {{was much less}} than the control group. This difference is highly significant statistically (p <. 0001). Similar was our observation in schizophrenic females (p<. 05). Further more number of schizophrenic females had finger hair compared to their normal counter parts which was statistically significant.

A lovely girl, with a frank face, and {{wonderful}} eyes; so large, so soft, so bright, set to such perfection in her kind good head. She was round and fresh and dimpled and spoilt, {{and there was}} in Pet an air of timidity and dependence which was the best weakness in the world, and gave her the only crowning charm a girl so pretty and pleasant could have been without.|$|R
5000|$|In a 1981 {{conversation}} with Hunter Davies, {{who had written}} a biography of the Beatles in 1968, McCartney responded to a Yoko Ono interview where she said McCartney had hurt Lennon more than anyone else, by saying, [...] "No one ever goes on about the times John hurt me ... Could I have hurt him more than the person who ran down his mother in his car?" [...] He then brought up Lennon's comments about [...] "Why Don't We Do It in the Road?": [...] "There's only one incident I can think of that John has mentioned publicly. It was when I went off with Ringo and did 'Why Don't We Do It in the Road'. It wasn't a deliberate thing. John and George were tied up finishing something and me and Ringo were <b>free,</b> just <b>hanging</b> around, so I said to Ringo, 'Let's go and do this.'" ...|$|R
