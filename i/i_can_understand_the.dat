25|$|In {{the opinion}} of Sasha Sokolov:It seems he was only really {{appreciated}} by professionals. Living here and now, in Tel-Aviv, I remember our few meetings and frequently walk along Ben Yehuda Street, past his house... Sasha is difficult. He's not only difficult stylistically, but also philosophically. He offers up his immense knowledge without thinking of the reader, without glancing back at him – a knowledge of art, science, philology, naturally. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> value of his texts, but I don't understand how they were made.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked if}} {{religion}} {{plays a part}} in her life in 2009, Streep replied: [...] "I follow no doctrine. I don't belong to a church or a temple or a synagogue or an ashram." [...] In an interview in December 2008, she also alluded to her lack of religious belief when she said: [...] "So I've always been really, deeply interested, because I think <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> solace that's available in the whole construct of religion. But I really don't believe {{in the power of}} prayer, or things would have been avoided that have happened, that are awful. So it's a horrible position as an intelligent, emotional, yearning human being to sit outside of the available comfort there. But I just can't go there." ...|$|E
2500|$|Carr was [...] "fascinated {{with the}} {{psychology}} of killers, who were subliminally acting out the pain of being controlled by monstrous parents by controlling and killing victims, seeking a release that would never come." [...] As he explains, [...] "For me it began in New York with the Son of Sam killings while I was in college...I think I can {{understand some of the}} kind of rage that's behind what they do. I can't understand the major portion of it because that's what leads to the violence they commit. But <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> germ of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{certainly}} seems," [...] the Colonel admitted, [...] "to {{have covered}} up his traces with admirable skill. I have read {{every word of}} the evidence at <b>the</b> inquest, and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> that <b>the</b> police are completely confused." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> quite <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> {{aggravation}} of Daisy {{happening to}} be right; {{but you must}} really be man enough to mind your own conscience, even if Daisy is imprudent enough to enforce it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{even when}} he was trying to kill us," [...] she said to her lover, [...] "I felt for him down in the bottom of my mind. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> all <b>the</b> horrible things, the humiliation--the humiliation! he went through." ...|$|R
2500|$|William Boyd-Carpenter {{corresponded with}} the last empress of Russia, Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse). [...] "In early 1895 she wrote to William Boyd-Carpenter, who as Bishop of Ripon was also court {{chaplain}} to her grandmother Queen Victoria, that she was trying hard {{to come to terms}} with external trappings of her new faith. ‘Now that I am more used to hear the Russian language <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> service so much better, and many things have become clear to me and comprehensible which at first rather startled me. [...] The singing is most beautiful and edifying, only I miss the sermons, which are never preached in the Imperial chapels..." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{the fifth}} season {{received}} a Best Drama Series nomination at the 69th Primetime Emmy Awards, Brian Grubb of Uproxx wrote: House of Cards {{has not been}} very good for multiple seasons now, if it was ever that good. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> original excitement about it. Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright were on television. And not even [...] "television," [...] really. They were on a big budget series that was made for and by a streaming service. David Fincher was involved and even directed a few episodes. This was a borderline revolutionary development. [...] I don't see how anyone who watched it can think it deserves {{a place in the}} best six or seven dramas on television.|$|E
2500|$|... "With full {{affection for}} the flag which I have been born under, and the flag I represent, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> {{sentiment}} and feeling of a republican who has created his independence, and values that before all; but I can say fairly that I believe {{in the future that}} I can assimilate the system, which I have been connected with, with the Cape Colony, and it is not an impossible idea that the neighbouring republics, retaining their independence, should share with us as to certain general principles. If I might put it to you, I would say the principles of tariffs, the principle of railway connection, the principle of appeal in law, the principle of coinage, and in fact all those principles which exist at the present moment in the United States, irrespective of the local assemblies which exist in each separate state in that country." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How he {{can live}} in the same house with that Mr Peters, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> never <b>understand.</b> <b>The</b> quarrels between him and his {{daughter}} are so incessant that poor Mr Stumfold is unable to conceal them from the public." ...|$|R
5000|$|Sehdev later apologized, {{stating that}} he used the term [...] "Sikh Taliban" [...] "as a metaphor", and that he {{understood}} it had caused offence for [...] "some Sikhs". He continued, [...] "On reflection <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand,</b> given <b>the</b> broader context and history, why that term is an offensive one." ...|$|R
6000|$|Corliss {{found his}} thought {{following}} hers, and answered, [...] "These battlers of frost and fighters of hunger! <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> how <b>the</b> dominant races {{have come down}} out of the north to empire. Strong to venture, strong to endure, with infinite faith and infinite patience, is it to be wondered at?" ...|$|R
2500|$|During {{his visit}} to the Palestinian Territories in October 1996, a visit {{organized}} by the Consulate General of France in Jerusalem, President Jacques Chirac addressed the Palestinian Legislative Council in Ramallah, [...] the first foreign President to do so. On this occasion, he reiterated the position of France on Jerusalem and the conflict: [...] "The whole world has its eyes on Jerusalem, the thrice Holy City. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> passions it inspires. Its holiness, for the Muslims and the Christians, as for the Jews, cannot be dissociated from its existence as a city. That means that in order to retain its unique identity, its plurality must be preserved. The solution for Jerusalem cannot be solely religious, or solely national. It is necessary that freedom of access for the faithful, all the faithful, be guaranteed everywhere. And any idea of sovereignty, from whatever quarter, must be fitted into the framework of the negotiated compromise planned by the Oslo agreements." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You really aren't {{responsible}} in the least," [...] Jessie declared. [...] "Still, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> idea troubling you. Would {{you like me}} to help you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> miracle," [...] the Doctor said, [...] "for I {{believe that}} fellow could take {{you through the}} air and carry you through stone walls with a wave of his hand." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'So far as <b>I</b> <b>can</b> yet <b>understand,</b> <b>the</b> {{family and}} kin have {{gathered}} for the marriage of his sister, the Lady Anne--the red-cheeked maiden in the rose-coloured kirtle--to the young Sir Richard Nevil, the same who gave his hand to thee, Annis--the son of my Lord of Salisbury.' ...|$|R
60|$|The {{weather is}} a thing that is beyond me altogether. <b>I</b> never <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> it. <b>The</b> {{barometer}} is useless: it is as misleading as the newspaper forecast.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{certainly}} extraordinary," [...] the lady said; [...] "but {{it does not}} seem to me by any means impossible, for I have heard that in these terrible cyclones houses have been taken up and carried long distances, and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> quite <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> same thing happening to a boat." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{exactly what}} I mean. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> kind of curator's {{interest}} an Oriental finds in shepherding a large establishment, but {{to spend my}} days looking after one person who {{ought to be able}} to look after herself--" ...|$|E
60|$|Hence {{the mistake}} into which I unwittingly fell. I {{am proud to}} correct it and do full justice to the acuteness and {{accuracy}} which, as far as <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> subjects, M. Ampère carries into all the branches of philosophy which he investigates.|$|E
6000|$|... “He {{would not}} be much good to anybody but myself. One has got to know a good deal {{beforehand}} {{to make use of}} a man like that. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> sort of hint he can give. And when I want a hint he can generally furnish it to me.” ...|$|E
50|$|He (Paul Dempsey) got a {{few words}} wrong, but that's OK, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand!</b> Actually, <b>the</b> first time I heard it was live, at Pushover. It was great. That's the first time we'd ever heard a band play one of our songs. It was such a buzz. And {{the fact that they}} did it so well was even cooler.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{never knew}} anybody yet that {{was proud of}} his friends. I like him well enough, but <b>I</b> <b>can</b> quite <b>understand</b> that <b>the</b> {{governor}} should object." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] he said, as he perused the document, {{and glanced}} at the midshipmen, [...] "if these are British officers, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> {{scarcely}} <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> trouble they are giving us. They are mere boys. I thought their uniform was red. The soldiers who were brought here a month ago were all in red." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Bridget Bolster {{is now in}} {{the next}} room, and as far as <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>{{understand}}</b> <b>the</b> case at present, she would be the witness on whom your case, Mr. Mason, would most depend. The man Kenneby I have not yet seen; but from what I understand he is less likely to prove a willing witness than Mrs. Bolster." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> French position," [...] {{said the}} girl, reflectively. [...] "These Germans are very obstinate, and much as I admire Lieutenant Elbl I feel sure that were he able he would fight the French again to-morrow. After his {{recovery}} {{he might even}} {{get one of those}} mechanical feet and be back on the firing line." ...|$|E
60|$|We heard {{yesterday}} {{from the}} editor of the 'Examiner,' Mr. Forster, who expects some terrible consequence of present circumstances in England, as far as <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand.</b> <b>The</b> alliance with France is full of consolation. There seems to be a real heart-union between the peoples. What a grand thing the Napoleon loan is! It has struck the English with admiration.|$|E
6000|$|... "You wouldn't marry any one but a squatter? <b>I</b> <b>can</b> quite <b>understand</b> that. <b>The</b> squatters {{here are}} what the lords {{and the country}} gentlemen are at home." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wait a moment, Lady Mason. I was angry;--or rather {{sorry and}} vexed {{to hear of}} that which I did not approve. But your letter has removed that feeling. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> now <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> manner in which this {{engagement}} was forced upon you; and I understand also--do I not?--that the engagement will not be carried out?" ...|$|R
3000|$|... “They have {{no right}} to what is {{absolutely}} not, but yes, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> that they think that why should my country to receive you and you will be part of my society and my society will support you and your family and you should as well go and do criminal things, and so on and not, absolutely not contribute to society? So <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> that <b>the</b> mind arises of Swedes then.” [...]...|$|R
60|$|Possibly you {{and dear}} Mr. Martin think more just now of America than of this country, which <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand.</b> <b>The</b> crisis has come earlier than anyone expected. It is a crisis; {{and if the}} north accepts such a {{compromise}} as has been proposed the nation perishes morally, which would be sadder than the mere dissolution of States, however sad. It {{is the difference between}} the death of the soul and of the body.|$|E
6000|$|If Mr. Gladstone's latest {{information}} on these matters {{is derived from the}} famous discourse prefixed to the [...] "Ossemens Fossiles," [...] <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> position he has taken up; if he has ever opened a respectable modern manual of palaeontology, or geology, I cannot. For the facts which demolish his whole argument are of the commonest notoriety. But before proceeding to consider the evidence for this assertion we must be clear about the meaning of the phraseology employed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why {{he chose}} Mr. Allen's name," [...] she said, [...] "is {{absolutely}} beyond my guessing. Unless {{there is some}} purpose behind the choice, which I do not for an instant believe, it was a foolish thing to do, and one very apt to lead to difficulties. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> rest. He {{has a reputation for}} eccentricity which he feels he must keep up, and this notion of assuming a name evidently appealed to him as an inspiration." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hush, hush, my dear!" [...] he said. [...] "Between ourselves, Burton {{has been}} going it a bit lately. There's no doubt that he's had a drop {{too much to drink}} this afternoon. Don't take any notice of him. He'll come round all right. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> what's <b>the</b> matter with him. You mark my words, in two or three days he'll be just his old self." ...|$|R
60|$|FRANK. Never see her again! Hang it all, be reasonable. I shall {{come along}} {{as often as}} possible, and be her brother. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> not <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> absurd {{consequences}} you romantic people expect from the most ordinary transactions. [A knock at the door]. I wonder who this is. Would you mind opening the door? If it's a client it will look more respectable than if I appeared.|$|R
500|$|Brad Park and Frank Mahovlich {{also criticized}} the booing. According to Park: [...] "We get nothing — not a dime for this. Brother, I'm sick". Other players were more sanguine. Dryden didn't lash {{out at the}} fans. [...] "I'm disappointed, but <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> it. <b>The</b> fans wanted us to do real good, and they're {{frustrated}} we didn't. I didn't think I deserved to be booed. Tretiak frustrated us, but I guess I didn't frustrate them enough." ...|$|R
