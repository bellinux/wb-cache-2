5|$|Jonathan Del Arco had {{no concept}} of what a Borg was prior to the audition. He {{received}} his script on the evening prior to meeting with the producers and felt that {{it gave him a}} decent sense of the character. Instead, Del Arco later explained that he was deliberately anti-social towards the other actors at the audition in order to get into Hugh's mindset. When he performed for the producers, someone else read the lines assigned to Picard and La Forge, and he <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> immediately got a positive result. He received a call back, and returned to audition once more.|$|E
5|$|In 1972, Applewhite met Bonnie Nettles, a nurse with an {{interest}} in theosophy and Biblical prophecy. The two quickly became close friends; he later recalled that he <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> had known her {{for a long time and}} concluded that they had met in a past life. She told him their meeting had been foretold to her by extraterrestrials, persuading him that he had a divine assignment. By that time, he had begun to investigate alternatives to traditional Christian doctrine, including astrology. He also had had several visions, including one in which he was told that he was chosen for a role like that of Jesus. In her 2005 profile of Applewhite, Susan Raine speculates that he had a schizophrenic episode around this time.|$|E

5000|$|On 6 July 2015, Lika {{returned}} to Tirana after three seasons abstence, signing a one-year contract. Before the transfer, the media's started to speculating that Lika will not move to Tirana if the capital club {{will not pay}} {{more than half of}} the €30,000 debt that the club had not paid during the last time that Lika was part of Tirana. During his presentation in Thursday, Lika said that [...] "Tirana is his second home after Shkodra", by adding that [...] "with this return, <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>he's</b> returning home".|$|R

5|$|Sam Jones III was {{the last}} of the season one series regulars to be cast–being hired just four days before filming for the pilot episode began. Jones, who is African American, was also cast against the Superman mythology where Pete Ross is Caucasian. Jones has stated that he would have {{understood}} if the producers had simply created a black character for him to portray, but the fact that they chose to go with him, even though the character has always been white, gave him more honor {{to be a part of}} the show. During the first season, Jones <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> should have more screen time, but later conceded that the show was about Clark's journey and that the other characters are there to help his story move along.|$|E

25|$|In 2006, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences awarded Altman an Academy Honorary Award for Lifetime Achievement. During his {{acceptance}} speech, he {{revealed that he}} had received a heart transplant approximately ten or eleven years earlier. The director then quipped that perhaps the Academy had acted prematurely in recognizing the body of his work, as he <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> might have four more decades of life ahead of him.|$|E

25|$|After {{having worked}} {{with members of}} 27 as guest musicians on {{previous}} full-length Oceanic, for Panopticon Isis turned to Justin Chancellor, bassist of tour-mates Tool. According to Turner, “he {{was one of the}} first names on the list. He's in a band that we all mutually respect and we <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> was a person that understood what we were doing and could maintain a focus on what we were trying to attain. But he also has some interesting facets of his own musical personality that we thought would blend well with our style.” Wavering Radiant, Isis' 2009 final album, features Adam Jones, also of Tool, as a guest musician.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 2016, André Gomes and Paco Alcácer were both sold to Barcelona and Shkodran Mustafi was sold to Arsenal, while Ezequiel Garay and former Manchester United player Nani were brought in. Pako Ayestarán was sacked on 21 September 2016 after four-straight defeats at the {{beginning}} of the 2016–17 season. Former Italy national team head coach Cesare Prandelli was hired as his replacement on 28 September. However, he resigned after just three months on 30 December, claiming the club had made him false transfer promises. Days later, on 7 January 2017, Valencia sporting director Jesús García Pitarch also resigned, saying he <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> was being used as a shield for criticism by the club and that he could not defend something he no longer believed in. Voro was named caretaker manager for the fifth time until the end of season, with Valencia in 17th position and in danger of relegation. However, results improved under Voro and he steered Valencia clear off relegation, ultimately finishing the season in 13th place. On 27 March, Mateu Alemany was named the new director general of Valencia.|$|E
25|$|On {{hearing this}} Duryodhana closed all the fingers and rested. Duryodhana {{concluded}} that these 3 factors should have surely brought him victory. Had {{he built a}} fort around Hastinapur, he could have totally avoided {{the war in the}} first place. If Vidura had fought on his side, he would have had the best strategist, even better than Krishna. At last, Duryodhana {{came to the conclusion that}} Krishna was in fact the avatar of Lord Vishnu. If Duryodhana had named Ashwatthama the commander of the army after the death of Drona, victory would have surely be his as Ashwatthama was the avatar of Lord Shiva. No one can handle a 'furious' Ashwatthama, the part incarnate of Lord Shiva. All Duryodhana need to do to win the war was to make Ashwatthama furious. The remorse about under-utilizing Ashwatthama prompted Duryodhana to rethink and make Ashwatthama the commander of his army after the war, after his defeat. These events led to the complete destruction of the Pandavas' army. After the night raid of Ashwatthama on the Pandava camp, Duryodhana <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> had won the war, as the Pandavas lost everything and everyone they cared about.|$|E
60|$|Girk lost {{no time in}} {{following}} up the advantage thus gained, {{and by the time}} Dick <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> rising <b>he</b> found his hands bound behind him and a gag of knotted cloth stuffed into his mouth.

25|$|Meanwhile, late {{at night}} on Tuesday, May 7, a 45-year-old black man named Herbert Thomas was flagged down by a {{hitchhiker}} in Kilgore. The man said that he needed a ride to Henderson because his mother was seriously ill and offered $5. Thomas {{said that he would}} not have given the man a ride but <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> needed to because the man told such a sad story. When they neared Henderson, the man pulled out a pistol and told Thomas to keep driving or he would kill him like the five people he killed in Texarkana, mentioning Paul Martin and Betty Jo Booker by name. The man told Thomas that he was not done killing and was planning on killing more. He {{said he was going to}} return to Texarkana and kill Martin's father. The suspect apparently did not know that Martin's father was already dead. The man then made Thomas stop in Lufkin and told him to drive back to Kilgore and that if he followed him, he would trail him and kill him. The man stole back the $5 as well as an additional $3. Thomas drove back to Kilgore and reported the incident to the police. Thomas described the man as being 5'8, about 130pounds, approximately 27 or 28 years old, with red hair and wore khaki trousers and a GI jacket.|$|E
25|$|Sehwag, however, {{was caught}} by Lou Vincent for 75, and that started a flurry of wickets for New Zealand. Rahul Dravid, who had had a poor series with only 64 runs in four innings, {{continued}} on that vein of form as he was deceived by a quick arm ball from Daniel Vettori for a two-ball 0 – Vettori's second wicket of the innings. Astle, Mills and Vettori tied down the batsmen, as no boundaries were given {{up in the next}} eight overs, and Yuvraj <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> had to attack. He got away with a lofted shot through midwicket for four on the second ball of a Mills over, but shortly afterwards he had a feel at a short ball which landed in Shane Bond's hands – and Yuvraj was gone for a stifled 20. Kaif was still in, but he ran out of partners, as no one could help him keep the run rate up. Jacob Oram got three wickets to redeem his figures, ending with four for 58, although the latter three came in the last ten overs – one of them was Yadav, who gave a simple leading edge to the wicket-keeper McCullum, and the last was a straight drive from Pathan which fell short of the boundary and into Lou Vincent's hands. With Dhoni adjudged lbw to a ball that struck him in the stomach as well, India were all out for 276, Kaif left stranded on 93 not out after taking a single on the first ball of the over.|$|E
25|$|In February 2012, Schuyler Yancey {{was cast}} {{in the role of}} Dr. Cameron Davis. Yancey made his debut on the April 5, 2012 episode.

However, the producers refused to comment on the role Owens would be playing. The actor himself later confirmed through his own personal Facebook that he had been cast in the role of Cameron. Owens's Instagram message about the casting was believed to be an accident. Soaps In Depth later confirmed that Owens would make his first appearance on the December 21 as a replacement for Yancey. However, due to news coverage of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, Davis first air date was postponed to December 24, 2012. Owens found out about the role through his manager. In an interview, Owens revealed that he went out for the role of Rodney. He worked with casting director, Marnie Saitta and went through several tests. Owens admitted that he had a good feeling about the casting because he was given several opportunities to go over the material. Saitta called him back shortly after his test and told Owens to come back in a few days. He went back and forth a few times before he met with the producers and tested with Kate Mansi who portrayed Abigail. Owens signed on to play Cameron and beat out 15 other actors for the role. Owens admitted to being hesitant about replacing someone, though Yancey was only in the role {{for a short period of}} time, people had already gotten used to him, and Owens said that he <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> was under a magnifying glass when he started, and that the potential critics made him a bit nervous. On September 21, 2013, at Kate Mansi's birthday party, Owens announced his departure from the series and revealed that he would last air in November.|$|E

500|$|His view on {{the album}} soured as the years passed.

500|$|Simon Leng admires [...] "Circles" [...] as [...] "one of [...] composer's {{most complex}} pieces" [...] and pairs the song with [...] "Beware of Darkness", as [...] "a study in Harrison's unique {{harmonic}} sense".

6000|$|Almost {{immediately}} {{he called}} his young second officer over to him. This was not done in displeasure. The glance he fastened on Mr Powell conveyed a sort of approving wonder. He engaged him in desultory conversation {{as if for the}} only purpose of keeping a man who could provoke such a sound, near his person. Mr Powell <b>felt</b> himself <b>liked.</b> <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> it. <b>Liked</b> by that haggard, restless man who threw at him disconnected phrases to which his answers were, [...] "Yes, sir", [...] "No, sir," [...] "Oh, certainly", [...] "I suppose so, sir,"--and might have been clearly anything else for all the other cared.|$|R
500|$|In Planica, Herzog quoted Steiner {{as having}} said that he <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> was in an arena with 50,000 people waiting to see him crash.

500|$|According to Ausmus, Hoffman {{wanted his}} teams {{to feel like}} a family. He <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> let his family down if he did not do his job on a {{particular}} night. Still, he was accessible and held himself accountable on the rare occasions that he failed. Hoffman was more accommodating for interviews after blown saves than he was after successful ones. [...] "The people asking the questions are not responsible for the ball flying out of the park", he explained. Both Towers and Black best remember Hoffman for his accountability after his blown save in the 2007 Wild Card tie-breaker.|$|E
60|$|O'Hara {{could hear}} them groping their way past him. He waited no longer. It is {{difficult}} to tell where sound comes from in the dark. He plunged forward at a venture.
