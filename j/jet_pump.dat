40|$|Abstract — The {{experiment}} {{was about to}} study of water <b>jet</b> <b>pumps</b> with different diameters and nozzle-to-throat area ratios. Most experimental studies on water <b>jet</b> <b>pumps</b> mainly carried out to assess the maximum efficiency. But maximum efficiency occurs when the suction lift is relatively small for a given head loss through the pump, which implies, when the suction flow rate is maximum. However, suction lift is inversely proportional to flow rate. But {{in the field of}} application there are many cases (such as drainage, dredging, well-pumping and other systems) where suction lift is more important factor than any other for water <b>jet</b> <b>pumps,</b> which gives importance to the assessment of depending factor of suction lift of water <b>jet</b> <b>pumps.</b> Six different <b>jet</b> <b>pumps</b> of two different nominal diameter each of three different nozzle to throat area ratio were made to carry out this experiment. The results revealed that the nozzle-to-throat area ratio was an important parameter to characterize the suction lift of the <b>jet</b> <b>pumps,</b> but nominal diameter had a negligible play role...|$|R

50|$|A {{submersible}} pump (or sub pump, electric {{submersible pump}} (ESP)) is a device {{which has a}} hermetically sealed motor close-coupled to the pump body. The whole assembly is submerged in the fluid to be pumped. The main advantage {{of this type of}} pump is that it prevents pump cavitation, a problem associated with a high elevation difference between pump and the fluid surface. Submersible pumps push fluid to the surface as opposed to <b>jet</b> <b>pumps</b> having to pull fluids. Submersibles are more efficient than <b>jet</b> <b>pumps.</b>|$|R

50|$|Jet {{pumps are}} {{commonly}} used to extract water from water wells. The main pump, often a centrifugal pump, is powered and installed at ground level. Its discharge is split, with {{the greater part of}} the flow leaving the system, while a portion of the flow is returned to the <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> installed below ground in the well. This recirculated part of the pumped fluid is used to power the jet. At the <b>jet</b> <b>pump,</b> the high-energy, low-mass returned flow drives more fluid from the well, becoming a low-energy, high-mass flow which is then piped to the inlet of the main pump.|$|E

40|$|AbstractNuclotron is {{the first}} fast cycling superconducting {{synchrotron}} intended for the acceleration of high-energy nuclei and heavy ions. Its cryogenic system includes two helium refrigerators with a total capacity of 4000 W at 4. 5 K. The 251. 5 m long accelerator ring consists of 144 superconducting dipole and quadruple magnets. The magnets connected in parallel are refrigerated by a two-phase flow of boiling helium. In order to increase liquid helium flow directed to the superconducting magnets, <b>jet</b> <b>pumps</b> are used.

5000|$|Although {{the flow}} rate for a water well pumpjack {{is lower than}} that from a <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> and the lifted water is not pressurised, the beam pumping unit has the option of hand pumping in an emergency, by hand-rotating the pumpjack cam to its lowest position, and {{attaching}} a manual handle {{to the top of}} the wellhead rod. Or in larger pumpjacks powered by engines, the engine can run off fuel stored in a reservoir or from natural gas delivered from the nearest gas grid. In some cases, this type of pump consumes less power than a <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> and is therefore cheaper to run.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a numerical simulations of oscillating flow in a constricted duct and compares the results with experimental and theoretical data. The numerical simulations were performed using the {{computational fluid dynamics}} (CFD) code CFX 4. 2. The numerical model simulates an experimental oscillating flow facility {{that was designed to}} test the properties and characteristics of oscillating flow in tapered ducts, also known as <b>jet</b> <b>pumps.</b> <b>Jet</b> <b>pumps</b> are useful devices in thermoacoustic machinery because they produce a secondary pressure that can counteract an unwanted effect called streaming, and significantly enhance engine efficiency. The simulations revealed that CFX could accurately model velocity, shear stress and pressure variations in laminar oscillating flow. The numerical results were compared to experimental data and theoretical predictions with varying success. The least accurate numerical results were obtained when laminar flow approached transition to turbulent flow...|$|R

50|$|Between 1951 and 1955 Cessna used {{modifications}} of the 170 and its derivative, the U.S. Army L-19, as test beds for Boundary layer control research, {{under contract to}} the Office of Naval Research and the Army Transportation Corps,designating them as the models 309 and 319. The project was done {{in conjunction with the}} University of Wichita which conducted extensive wind tunnel tests of the concept. The model 309 utilized the German World War II Arado lift-increasing system in which a <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> inside the wing sucked in stagnant air from the flap area, energized it and blew the higher-speed air over the ailerons. Various chemicals and enhancements were used to power the <b>jet</b> <b>pump.</b> Better results were obtained by departing from the Arado <b>jet</b> <b>pump</b> method and using an engine-driven generator to power electric motors driving axial fans to move the internal air. This concept was adopted on the Model 319 but substituted an engine-driven hydraulic pump to drive hydraulic-powered axial fans. This model was more successful and resulted in the highest lift capacity, as measured by the maximum lift coefficient recorded up to that time. The 319 demonstrated the capability of taking off in 190 ft, landing in 160 ft and clearing a 50 ft obstacle in 450 ft. The aircraft had a stall speed of 28 kn.The 309 and 319 were meant to be research aircraft only, and no plans were developed to incorporate boundary layer control technology in then-current Cessna models. An adaptation of the concept, used only to improve landing performance, was incorporated in U.S. Cold War fighter aircraft like the United States Air Force Lockheed F-104 Starfighter and the multi-service McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II.|$|E

50|$|Deep well {{pumps are}} those in which the jet {{is located at the}} bottom of the well.

The major advantage of <b>jet</b> <b>pumps</b> for deep well installations is the ability to situate all mechanical parts (e.g., electric/petrol motor, rotating impellers) at the ground surface for easy maintenance. The advent of the electrical submersible pump has partly replaced the need for <b>jet</b> type well <b>pumps,</b> except for driven point wells or surface water intakes.|$|R
