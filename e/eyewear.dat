25|$|Potential best {{vision loss}} may occur {{a year after}} the surgery {{regardless}} of the use of <b>eyewear.</b>|$|E
25|$|In the 1970s, fashionable glasses {{started to}} become {{available}} through manufacturers, {{and the government}} also recognized the demand for stylized <b>eyewear.</b>|$|E
25|$|Polarized {{sunglasses}} are protective <b>eyewear</b> which incorporate oscillated lenses {{shifting the}} sun's rays {{in the opposite}} direction. Polarized sunglasses were invented in 1937 by Edwin Land.|$|E
25|$|Some {{have complained}} about {{technical}} errors {{and lack of}} proper safety practices in the programme, especially the absence of protective <b>eyewear.</b> However, in later episodes, Bob is seen using safety glasses.|$|E

25|$|Brinkley has {{designed}} clothing patterns for Simplicity Pattern and in March 1994 helped design, for brand Nouveau <b>Eyewear,</b> her line of prescription glasses and sunglasses called Christie Brinkley Perspectives with worldwide sales. In Spring 1998 she released her own signature fragrance, Believe. Her jewelry collection is manufactured by Swank.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, Moritz von Rohr and Zeiss (with the {{assistance}} of H. Boegehold and A. Sonnefeld), developed the Zeiss Punktal spherical point-focus lenses that dominated the eyeglass lens field for many years. In 2008, Joshua Silver designed <b>eyewear</b> with adjustable corrective glasses. They work by silicone liquid, a syringe, and a pressure mechanism.|$|E
25|$|Proper {{protection}} such as {{welding goggles}} should be worn at all times, including {{to protect the}} eyes against glare and flying sparks. Special safety <b>eyewear</b> must be used—both to protect the welder {{and to provide a}} clear view through the yellow-orange flare given off by the incandescing flux. In the 1940s cobalt melters’ glasses were borrowed from steel foundries and were still available until the 1980s. However, the lack of protection from impact, ultra-violet, infrared and blue light caused severe eyestrain and eye damage. Didymium <b>eyewear,</b> developed for glassblowers in the 1960s, was also borrowed—until many complained of eye problems from excessive infrared, blue light, and insufficient shading. Today very good eye protection can be found designed especially for gas-welding aluminum that cuts the sodium orange flare completely and provides the necessary protection from ultraviolet, infrared, blue light and impact, according to ANSI Z87-1989 safety standards for a Special Purpose Lens.|$|E
25|$|Protective <b>eyewear</b> is {{beneficial}} to those exposed to ultraviolet radiation. Since light {{can reach the}} eyes from the sides, full-coverage eye protection is usually warranted {{if there is an}} increased risk of exposure, as in high-altitude mountaineering. Mountaineers are exposed to higher-than-ordinary levels of UV radiation, both because there is less atmospheric filtering and because of reflection from snow and ice.|$|E
25|$|The Mounted Soldier System {{would protect}} crew members from ballistic, thermal, and CBRN threats. The Mounted Soldier System {{incorporated}} fire retardant {{systems such as}} the Improved Combat Vehicle Crewman Coverall and undergarments, facewear, gloves, and footwear. Ballistic protection would come from the Combat Vehicle Crewman Helmet, <b>eyewear,</b> a maxillofacial shield, and improvements to body armor. A secondary squad egress was {{to be provided for}} the squad to exit in emergencies.|$|E
25|$|Sunglasses or sun {{glasses are}} a visual aid which feature lenses that are {{coloured}} or darkened to prevent strong light {{from reaching the}} eyes. For centuries, Chinese judges had routinely worn smoke-colored quartz lenses to conceal their eye expressions in court. However, these were not intended for blocking sunlight from eyes. It wasn't until the 20th century that what is now considered to be sunglasses were invented. In 1929, Sam Foster invented and mass-produced the first tinted <b>eyewear</b> pieces solely intended to block out sunlight.|$|E
25|$|As an officer, Castro was not {{required}} to personally provide fire support to fellow soldiers in the exposed housetop position. Nonetheless, he volunteered for the mission and was accompanied by Sergeant Ralph Porras and Private First Class Justin Dreese. A mortar round landed {{a few feet away}} from him, killing Sergeant Porras and PFC Dreese and severely wounding Castro. Shrapnel tore through his body, damaging a shoulder, breaking an arm, fracturing facial bones and collapsing his lungs. The blast also drove the frame of his protective <b>eyewear</b> into his face.|$|E
25|$|Lasers in {{this class}} may cause damage if the beam enters the eye directly. This {{generally}} applies to lasers powered from 5–500mW. Lasers in this category can cause permanent eye damage with exposures of 1/100th of a second or more depending {{on the strength of}} the laser. A diffuse reflection is generally not hazardous but specular reflections can be just as dangerous as direct exposures. Protective <b>eyewear</b> is recommended when direct beam viewing of ClassIIIb lasers may occur. Lasers at the high power end of this class may also present a fire hazard and can lightly burn skin.|$|E
25|$|Roddick {{also uses}} Babolat Propulse III tennis shoes, which are his {{signature}} gear. From 2000 to 2005, Roddick wore Reebok apparel. After Reebok {{announced it would}} not renew its contract with Roddick, Roddick signed a five-year, $25 million endorsement deal with Lacoste in April 2005. In November, he signed an agreement to endorse Lacoste <b>eyewear</b> for four years worth between $750,000 and $1 million. In June 2013, Roddick became an investor and brand ambassador to TravisMathew Apparel. Roddick, as well as fellow former American tennis players James Blake and Mardy Fish, wear TravisMathew's TM Red headwear, shirts and shorts during matches.|$|E
25|$|A Class 3B laser is {{hazardous}} if the eye {{is exposed}} directly, but diffuse reflections such as those from paper or other matte surfaces are not harmful. The AEL for continuous lasers in the wavelength range from 315nm to far infrared is 0.5W. For pulsed lasers between 400 and 700nm, the limit is 30mJ. Other limits apply to other wavelengths and to ultrashort pulsed lasers. Protective <b>eyewear</b> is typically required where direct viewing of a class3B laser beam may occur. Class-3B lasers must be equipped with a key switch and a safety interlock. Class3B lasers are used inside CD and DVD writers, although the writer unit itself is class1 because the laser light cannot leave the unit.|$|E
25|$|Tie-in {{products}} were also released for the game. Sony Mobile Communications released special edition Walkman, Xperia Z4, Xperia Z3 Tablet Compact, and Xperia J Compact devices, each featuring Outer Heaven emblems, soundtrack audio, and wallpapers. Watch manufacturer Seiko released a digital watch, resembling Venom Snake's {{watch from the}} game. Eyeglasses maker JF Rey produced themed <b>eyewear</b> patterned after what Kaz and Ocelot are wearing in the game. Japanese toy company Sentinel, which previously made an iDroid casing for the iPhone 5 and 5S, produced a transformable figure of the Sahelanthropus, while Kotobukiya readied a 1/100 scale kit of the unit. Sports apparel company Puma joined the project through a line of sports jackets, T-shirts, and footwear, including Snake's sneaking boots.|$|E
25|$|People {{choose to}} wear contact lenses for many reasons. Aesthetics and {{cosmetics}} {{are the main}} motivating factors {{for people who want}} to avoid wearing glasses or to change the appearance of their eyes. Others wear contact lenses for functional or optical reasons. When compared with spectacles, contact lenses typically provide better peripheral vision, and do not collect moisture (from rain, snow, condensation etc.) or perspiration. This can make them preferable for sports and other outdoor activities. Contact lens wearers can also wear sunglasses, goggles, or other <b>eyewear</b> of their choice without having to fit them with prescription lenses or worry about compatibility with glasses. Additionally, there are conditions such as keratoconus and aniseikonia that are typically corrected better with contact lenses than with glasses.|$|E
25|$|On 14 June 2007, Beckham {{launched}} dvb Denim {{collection in}} New York at Saks Fifth Avenue, along with unveiling her <b>eyewear</b> {{range in the}} United States for the first time. In the same month, Beckham made her first appearance at London's annual Graduate Fashion Week as a judge alongside Glenda Bailey (editor-in-chief of Harper's Bazaar) and Lanvin's Alber Elbaz, to choose {{the winner of the}} River Island Gold Award, worth £20,000. In August 2007, Intimately Beckham perfume was launched into US stores, one of more than 20 perfumes she and David Beckham have introduced over the years. In September 2007 her cosmetics line V-Sculpt was launched in Tokyo. In a 2007 appearance at an LA Galaxy press conference, Beckham is credited with having popularised Roland Mouret's 'moon dress' and his brand, and Beckham was also the face of Marc Jacobs for his Spring 2008 collection.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the American version's success, on January 29, 2009 Paris Hilton's British Best Friend debuted on ITV2 in England; Hilton began to film the show in October 2008. The series was successful; its first episode was watched by 428,000 viewers, and 605,000 viewers watched its finale. The second season of Paris Hilton's My New BFF premiered on June 2, 2009. The British series' runner-up, Kat McKenzie, died on July 3, 2009 from a {{suspected}} drug overdose. In June Hilton shot Paris Hilton's Dubai BFF, which was finally broadcast in 2011. She appeared in the fifth episode of Supernaturals fifth season. In July 2009 Hilton's sixth fragrance for women, Siren, was introduced and she won the Female Celebrity Fragrance of the Year Award at the 2009 Fifi Awards. Hilton was involved {{in the creation of a}} sunglass line by Gripping <b>Eyewear.</b> She introduced the line on October 7, 2009, and the collection became available in stores in March 2010. The following month, Hilton introduced a hair-and-beauty-products line which included shampoos, conditioners and hair vitamins. That year, she began dating The Hills star Doug Reinhardt; they broke up in April 2010, when she became concerned that he was using her to further his career.|$|E
25|$|Originally Edwin {{planned to}} launch five stores in key cities like London, but {{although}} they signed an initial deal on 4 June 1990 that was ratified that October, Edwin did not {{gain control of}} the Fiorucci assets until May 1992. In fact they would later lose the rights to the Fiorucci name in Canada on the grounds of disuse. However, one of Edwin's first acts was a deal with Coles Myer that would see 68 Fiorucci concessions in stores across Australia. They opened a new store in Piazza San Babila, Milan in early 1993, that included a variety of branded boutiques. It took them longer to get things going in North America, after a 1993 deal with Mary Ann Wheaton of Wheaton International fell through. In 1995 they licensed the rights for <b>eyewear</b> in the US to Swan International Optical, and then opened a US office in September 1997. However, the strategy of their licensee, Stephen Budd, to sell the brand into US department stores didn't work out so in 1999 they announced a plan to open a New York store once again. The initial plan was to open in time for Christmas 1999, but the store on lower Broadway finally opened its doors in June 2001. Commentators such as Kim Hastreiter were sceptical that it could recapture the buzz of times past, given the increased competition in mass-market clubbing gear from the likes of H and The Limited.|$|E

500|$|Jabara {{joined the}} Boy Scouts, {{eventually}} becoming an Eagle Scout. At an early age, {{he was set}} on becoming a pilot, [...] "I used to read articles about [...] Rickenbacker and all these novels you read about air combat, and I guess from the sixth grade it was my ambition to be a fighter pilot." [...] He worked at his parents' grocery store and graduated from Wichita North High School in Wichita, Kansas in May 1942. Standing five feet, five inches (165cm) tall, Jabara was short for a potential fighter pilot (and was reportedly required to wear corrective <b>eyewear),</b> but this did not prevent him from immediately enlisting as an aviation cadet of the United States Army Air Corps at Fort Riley, Kansas. In an attempt to improve his eyesight for flying, he ate 20 carrots {{a day in the}} mistaken belief that this would improve his vision. After attending four flying schools in Texas, he received his pilot's wings and a commission as second lieutenant at Moore Field, Texas in October 1943. Jabara with his wife, Nina, had four children: James William (b. 1949), Carol Ann (b. 1950), Cathy (b. 1952), and Jeanne (b. 1957).|$|E
2500|$|Protective <b>eyewear</b> in {{the form}} of {{spectacles}} or goggles with appropriately filtering optics can protect the eyes from the reflected or scattered laser light with a hazardous beam power, as well as from direct exposure to a laser beam. <b>Eyewear</b> must be selected for the specific type of laser, to block or attenuate in the appropriate wavelength range. For example, <b>eyewear</b> absorbing 532nm typically has an orange appearance (although one should never rely solely on the lens color when selecting laser eye protection), transmitting wavelengths larger than 550nm. Such <b>eyewear</b> would be useless as protection against a laser emitting at 800nm. Furthermore, some lasers emit more than one wavelength of light, and this may be a particular problem with some less expensive frequency-doubled lasers, such as 532nm [...] "green laser pointers" [...] which are commonly pumped by 808nm infrared laser diodes, and also generate the fundamental 1064nm laser beam which is used to produce the final 532nm output. If the IR radiation is allowed into the beam, which happens in some green laser pointers, it will in general not be blocked by regular red or orange colored protective <b>eyewear</b> designed for pure green or already IR-filtered beam. Special YAG laser and dual-frequency <b>eyewear</b> is available for work with frequency-doubled YAG and other IR lasers which have a visible beam, but it is more expensive, and IR-pumped green laser products do not always specify whether such extra protection is needed.|$|E
