5|$|The {{success of}} OPP <b>did</b> <b>come</b> {{at a cost}} for Dr Khan as his liberal views and {{self-help}} initiatives were questioned and criticized by certain interest groups. At two occasions, {{he was accused of}} blasphemy. However, all allegations against him were acquitted by the courts of law and cleared by independent religious scholars.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the famous}} Modernist writers who {{spent time in}} Paris, Ernest Hemingway never made an {{appearance}} at the salon. James Joyce came once or twice but didn't care for it. Marcel Proust never attended a Friday, though he <b>did</b> <b>come</b> to 20, Rue Jacob once to talk with Barney about lesbian culture whilst doing research for In Search of Lost Time. His visit was delayed repeatedly owing to his poor health, and when the meeting finally did happen he was too nervous {{to bring up the}} subject he had come to talk about.|$|E
5|$|Serevi did {{not play}} for Fiji in the 1997 season, but <b>did</b> <b>come</b> on against Scotland in Fiji's 51–26 win at Suva in 1998. He was {{continually}} selected throughout 1998, and played Tests against France, USA, Australia, Tonga and Samoa. The following year he again played for Fiji; including consecutive wins over Spain, Uruguay, and Italy. Fiji qualified for the 1999 Rugby World Cup in France, with Serevi playing in three of Fiji's matches – including wins over Namibia and Canada.|$|E

5|$|This {{beautiful}} and stylish player was unlucky to emerge {{on the horizon}} of big cricket {{at a time when}} NSW had virtually an international side for its State XI. When his opportunity <b>did</b> <b>come,</b> Alan proved a real stalwart. In addition, his Trumperian style must have influenced for good vast numbers of young boys. Unquestionably, the line of Trumper and Kippax {{has much to do with}} the grace and elegance which is more frequently associated with players from NSW than from other States.|$|E
5|$|After Prince died in 1899 he was {{replaced}} by the Reverend John Hugh Smyth-Pigott. Around 1890, Smyth-Pigott again started leading meetings of the community and recruited 50 young female followers to supplement the ageing population of Agapemonites. He took Ruth Anne Preece as his second wife and she had three children, named Glory, Power and Hallelujah. By 1902 his fame had spread as far as India, from where Mirza Ghulam Ahmad warned him of his false teachings and made a death prophecy against him stating that he would die within Mirza's lifetime, if he will claim that he was a god another time, which <b>did</b> <b>come</b> true as in the life time of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad he stopped claiming being a god. After the death of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad he claimed again being god and was sentenced to death and died.|$|E
5|$|His first {{goals of}} the new year came on, on 4 January, as he scored twice against Dundee United. However, this was not enough for a victory and the match {{finished}} 2–2. Although he did not start in the League Cup Final due to poor form, he <b>did</b> <b>come</b> on as a substitute as Celtic beat Rangers 2–0 and won the trophy. Samaras scored twice on 4 April, as Celtic beat Hamilton Academical 4–0. Celtic lost the title {{on the last day of}} the season. Samaras scored 17 goals, with 15 of them coming in the SPL. This made him the third top scorer behind Kris Boyd and team mate Scott McDonald.|$|E

5|$|On {{the death}} in office of Governor Sir James Harrison in 1971, Dunstan finally {{had the chance}} to appoint the {{governor}} of his choosing: Sir Mark Oliphant, a physicist who had worked on the Manhattan Project. Dunstan had never been happy that governors were usually British ex-servicemen; it was a personal goal of his to see an active and notable South Australian take on the role. Although the post was ceremonial, Oliphant brought energy to the role, and he used his stature to decry damage to the environment caused by deforestation, excessive open-cut mining and pollution. Oliphant's tenure was successful and held in high regard, although he <b>did</b> <b>come</b> into conflict with the premier at times as both men were outspoken and strong-willed.|$|E
5|$|The Seditionista raid on Ojo de Agua had a vast {{impact on}} American {{military}} {{strategy in the}} area. The severity of the raid led the commanding American general in the region, General Frederick Funston, to reinforce the Texas–Mexico border region with troops and to contact Washington with demands that he be allowed to give no quarter to any Mexican raiders who attacked the United States in the future. Although Washington denied General Funston his request, the raids <b>did</b> <b>come</b> to an end when Washington finally gave diplomatic recognition to the Mexican government under Carranza. Wishing to maintain {{good relations with the}} American government, Carranza ordered the Seditionista commanders to cease their raiding activities. Without support from the Mexican federal government the Plan of San Diego movement fell apart and there were no further Mexican invasions of the United States until the Villistas raids began in 1916.|$|E
5|$|While {{only a few}} Arabians were {{exported}} {{from behind}} the Iron Curtain during the Cold War, those who <b>did</b> <b>come</b> to the west {{caught the eye of}} breeders worldwide. Improved international relations between eastern Europe and the west led to major imports of Polish and Russian-bred Arabian horses to western Europe and the United States in the 1970s and 1980s. The collapse of the former Soviet Union in 1991, greater political stability in Egypt, {{and the rise of the}} European Union all increased international trade in Arabian horses. Organizations such as the World Arabian Horse Association (WAHO) created consistent standards for transferring the registration of Arabian horses between different nations. Today, Arabian horses are traded all over the world.|$|E

5|$|McCudden joined No. 20 Squadron on 8 July 1916. The {{unit was}} {{equipped}} with Royal Aircraft Factory F.E.2 and flew from Clairmarais, near Saint-Omer. He flew his first operational sortie two days later and continued as the Battle of the Somme raged. The Squadron was ordered to intercept and shoot down German reconnaissance aircraft. He patrolled the Ypres and Roulers region. He did not spot any enemy reconnaissance machines but <b>did</b> <b>come</b> into contact with a single Fokker near Lille. Flying in formation, the British were well placed to deal with lone German fighters since they could use their gunners to form a formidable defence screen. This particular German would climb above the British, make a diving attack at the rear-most aircraft and dive away {{if he did not}} score a decisive hit. Two days later McCudden ran out of fuel in the Lille district. Disorientated because of heavy mist, he force-landed in Allied territory, crashing and coming to halt in the garden of a French farmhouse. Little damage was done to the machine. On 2 August he took part in an operation to bomb the Zeppelin sheds at Brussels. The flight was unmolested, though the familiar lone Fokker made an appearance and then withdrew without attacking.|$|E
5|$|On {{the grand}} {{strategic}} level Marlborough had a rare {{grasp of the}} broad issues involved, and was able {{from the start of}} the Spanish Succession war to see the conflict in its entirety. He was one of the few influences working towards genuine unity within the Grand Alliance, but the extension of the war aims to include the replacement of PhilipV as King of Spain was a fatal mistake. Marlborough stands accused – possibly for political and diplomatic reasons – of not pressing his private doubts about reinforcing failure. Spain proved a continuous drain of men and resources, and ultimately hampered his chances of complete success in Flanders, the war's main theatre. The Allies <b>did</b> <b>come</b> close to a complete victory on several occasions, but the increasingly severe conditions imposed upon LouisXIV forestalled an early end to hostilities. Although the Duke lost his political influence in the latter stages of the war he still possessed vast prestige abroad, yet his failure to communicate his innermost convictions to his allies or political masters means he must bear some responsibility for the continuance of the war beyond its logical conclusion.|$|E
5|$|There {{was little}} warning in New Richmond. The tornado was {{completely}} illuminated by lightning, {{but it was}} visible {{for only a few}} minutes before it reached the town, as the view was largely obstructed by buildings and large trees. Initially, several of the town's residents recalled hearing a faint rumble in the distance which many mistook for the sound of a passing train. Before long the tornado became more visible, and those who <b>did</b> <b>come</b> to realize the danger approaching began to alert those around them, and panic ensued in the streets as people scrambled to take shelter. Despite the best efforts of the storm's early spotters, a great many of the town's residents were not fully aware of the oncoming storm until it was almost upon them. Shortly after 6 PM, the tornado tore into the southwest corner of the city. This neighborhood was where many of the town's wealthiest and most influential residents lived, many of them having first come to the area as pioneers from New England in the 1850s. They included the owners of some of New Richmond's most prominent businesses, residing in stately homes built in styles derived from those seen back east. Within a few moments, as many as fifty homes were leveled in this area.|$|E

It was expected that this area could be fished profitably, {{and it was not}} {{under the control of the}} existing Virginia government.|$|E
