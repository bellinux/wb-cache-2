50|$|The {{primary use}} of phthalic {{anhydride}} is as a chemical intermediate {{in the production}} of plastics from vinyl chloride. Phthalate esters, which function as plasticizers, are derived from Phthalic Anhydride. Phthalate plasticizers are used for the production of flexible PVC products such as cables, pipes and <b>hoses,</b> <b>leather</b> cloth, shoes, film for packaging etc. Phthalic anhydride has another major use {{in the production of}} polyester resins and other minor uses in the production of alkyd resins used in paints and lacquers; certain dyes (anthraquinone, phthalein, rhodamine, phthalocyanine, fluorescin, and xanthene dyes); insect repellents; and polyester polyols for polyurethanes. It is also utilized as a rubber scorch inhibitor and retarder.|$|R
50|$|In Amsterdam in the Dutch Republic, the Superintendent of the Fire Brigade, Jan van der Heyden, {{and his son}} Nicholaas took {{firefighting}} to {{its next}} step with the fashioning of the first fire hose in 1673. These 50 ft lengths of leather were sewn together like a boot leg. Even with the limitations of pressure, the attachment of the hose to the gooseneck nozzle allowed closer approaches and more accurate water application. Van der Heyden was also credited with {{an early version of}} a suction hose using wire to keep it rigid. In the United States, the fire hose was introduced in Philadelphia in 1794. This canvas hose proved insufficiently durable, and sewn <b>leather</b> <b>hose</b> was then used. The sewn <b>leather</b> <b>hose</b> tended to burst, so a <b>hose</b> fabricated of <b>leather</b> fastened together with copper rivets and washers was invented by members of Philadelphia's Humane Hose Company.|$|R
50|$|Following the {{invention}} of the vulcanization process as a means of curing raw soft rubber into a harder, more useful product, the fire service slowly made the transition from bulky and unreliable <b>leather</b> <b>hose</b> to the unlined linen hose, then to a multi-layer, rubber lined and coated hose with interior fabric reinforcement. This rubber hose was as bulky, heavy, and stiff as a <b>leather</b> <b>hose,</b> but was not prone to leaking. It also proved more durable than unlined linen hose. Its wrapped construction resembled some hoses used today by industry, for example, fuel delivery hoses used to service airliners.|$|R
50|$|Mr Milson, North Shore, has cut a cistern in {{the solid}} rock capable of {{containing}} 100 tons {{of water is}} supplied from an excellent spring constructed so as to fill, {{by means of a}} <b>leather</b> <b>hose</b> conductor, ship's boats along the beach where the water is of sufficient depth to float a ship of the line.|$|R
50|$|Instead of copper, brass, and {{low quality}} alloys, {{manufacturers}} increasingly use stainless steel and aluminium. Silicone rubber compounds {{are used for}} hookah <b>hoses</b> instead of <b>leather</b> and wire. New materials make modern hookahs more durable, eliminate odors while smoking and allow washing without risks of corrosion or bacterial decay. New technologies and modern design trends are changing the appearance of hookahs.|$|R
50|$|Men of {{all classes}} wore short braies or breeches, a loose undergarment, usually made of linen, {{which was held}} up by a belt. Hose or chausses made out of wool were used to cover the legs, and were {{generally}} brightly colored. Early <b>hose</b> sometimes had <b>leather</b> soles and were worn without shoes or boots. Hose were generally tied to the breech belt, or to the breeches themselves, or to a doublet.|$|R
50|$|In 1830, {{a patent}} {{was awarded to}} Charles Anthony Deane, which was for a device {{comprised}} a copper helmet with an attached flexible collar and garment. A long <b>leather</b> <b>hose</b> attached {{to the rear of}} the helmet was to be used to supply air, the original concept being that it would be pumped using a double bellows. A short pipe allowed breathed air to escape. The garment was to be constructed from leather or airtight cloth, secured by straps.|$|R
50|$|According a story, Goodrich {{had seen}} a friend's home burn to the ground, with firefighters {{rendered}} helpless because their <b>leather</b> <b>hoses</b> had frozen and cracked. Once settled in Akron, Goodrich ordered his company to begin producing cotton-wrapped rubber hose that would resist freezing. A few years later Goodrich started selling garden hoses (allowing bucketless garden watering) and bicycle tires. Still, the company teetered near bankruptcy and went through numerous name changes, its success still uncertain when Goodrich {{died at the age}} of 46 in 1888.|$|R
50|$|Around 1890, unlined {{fire hoses}} made of {{circular}} woven linen yarns began to replace <b>leather</b> <b>hoses.</b> They were certainly much lighter. As the hose fibers, made of flax, became wet, they swelled up and tightened the weave, causing the hose to become watertight. Unlined hoses, {{because of their}} lack of durability, were rapidly replaced with rubber hoses in municipal fire service use. They continued {{to be used for}} use on interior hose lines and hose racks until the 1960s, and are still used in some areas for forestry applications.|$|R
5000|$|Abraham L. Pennock and James Sellers in 1811 invented [...] "an {{improvement}} in making <b>leather</b> <b>hose</b> or tubes for conveying water and other fluids; {{and they are}} constructed by lapping their edges over, and fastening them by metallic rivets and burs, {{so as to be}} rendered water proof, and capable of resisting a heavy pressure of that fluid." [...] In 1818 they obtained a patent, but in the period before they applied for the patent they caused upwards of 13,000 feet of fire hose to be made and sold by a licensee Jenkins.|$|R
5000|$|The early {{prosperity}} of the town was {{largely due to the}} nearby quarries of slate, whose abundant use for the roofs of Angers led to its sobriquet as the [...] "Black City". In the mid-19th century, the principal manufactures were goods for sailing ships (sailcloth and rope), linen and <b>hose,</b> sugar, <b>leather,</b> wax, and oil, as well as agricultural products (mainly wheat, wine, and fruit). By the time of the First World War, Cointreau had developed the distillation of liqueurs from the area's fruit to an industrial level. The work for sailing ships was still carried on but steamships had greatly reduced demand. Instead, local companies produced cables, wires, and thread and increased production of footwear, umbrellas, and parasols. The area's vineyards focused on sparkling wine and fruit was increasingly preserved for sale elsewhere. The area had also developed a small-scale textile industry and begun producing machines, as well as commercial-scale production of hemp and flowers.|$|R
5000|$|Consequently, a well-equipped {{fire station}} was located nearby. In 1820, [...] "Congress {{authorized}} the covering {{of the building}} with a slate roof and {{the purchase of a}} fire engine for its protection against fires." [...] Unfortunately, the volunteer fire department lost its sense of purpose and was disbanded. In fact, a complete firehouse equipped with a fire engine was just down the street. Although equipped with a forcing pump and with riveted <b>leather</b> <b>hose</b> 1,000 feet (300 m) long (all purchased 16 years earlier by Act of Congress), there were no firefighters. Running a bucket brigade to put out the building blaze was totally ineffective.|$|R
2500|$|The first {{successful}} diving helmets were {{produced by the}} brothers Charles and John Deane in the 1820s. Inspired by a fire accident he witnessed in a stable in England, he designed and patented a [...] "Smoke Helmet" [...] {{to be used by}} firemen in smoke-filled areas in 1823. The apparatus comprised a copper helmet with an attached flexible collar and garment. A long <b>leather</b> <b>hose</b> attached {{to the rear of the}} helmet was to be used to supply air - the original concept being that it would be pumped using a double bellows. A short pipe allowed excess air to escape. The garment was constructed from leather or airtight cloth, secured by straps.|$|R
50|$|According to White's History, Gazetteer and Directory of Suffolk {{published}} in 1885 the village had 1,174 inhabitants at the 1881 census, although this does include Combs Ford, which nowadays {{is regarded as}} being a suburb of Stowmarket. White's also notes that {{at that time the}} Combs Tannery was owned by Messrs. Webb and Sons and carried on the tanning of leather and manufacture of glove and gaiter leather,leather machine bands and <b>leather</b> <b>hose.</b> At that time in 1885 the Tannery employed 150 persons. It also states that an artesian well had been sunk on the site at a depth of 895 ft and a diameter of ten inches (254 mm) at the surface. Many interesting geological specimens were extracted and deposited in Ipswich Museum.|$|R
60|$|His puritanic hat, {{the emblem}} of that of Ralpho in the prints to Hudibras, or, as he called it, his felt umbrella, was set most knowingly {{on one side of}} the head, as if it had been a Spanish hat and feather; his {{straight}} square-caped sad-coloured cloak was flung gaily upon one shoulder, as if it had been of three-plied taffeta, lined with crimson silk; and he paraded his huge calf-skin boots, as if they had been silken <b>hose</b> and Spanish <b>leather</b> shoes, with roses on the instep. In short, the airs which he gave himself, of a most thorough-paced wild gallant and cavalier, joined to a glistening of self-satisfaction in his eye, and an inimitable swagger in his gait, which completely announced his thoughtless, conceited, and reckless character, formed a most ridiculous contrast to his gravity of attire.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1820s John Deane {{was present}} in England when horses were trapped by fire in a stable. To get through the smoke and fire fumes {{he put on a}} medieval knight-in-armor helmet air-pumped by hose from a fire brigade water pump, and rescued all the horses. In 1823 he {{patented}} a [...] "Smoke Helmet" [...] to be used by firemen in smoke-filled areas; the full title is given as [...] "Apparatus or Machines to be worn by Persons entering Rooms or other places filled with Smoke of other Vapour, for the purpose of extinguishing Fire, or extricating Persons or Property therein". The apparatus comprised a copper helmet with an attached flexible collar and garment. A long <b>leather</b> <b>hose</b> attached {{to the rear of the}} helmet was to be used to supply air, the original concept being that it would be pumped using a double bellows. A short pipe allowed breathed air to escape. The garment was to be constructed from leather or airtight cloth, secured by straps.|$|R
50|$|The fire {{began in}} Eduard Cohen's cigar factory at Deichstraße 42 or 44 {{early in the}} morning of May 5, 1842; a {{neighbor}} alerted the night watch at about 1 a.m. It quickly spread to number 25, across the street. The weather had been unusually dry, and the wind was strong and changeable. Hamburg had fire lookouts on church towers, known as Türmer, in addition to night watchmen who had horns to sound to report a fire, and a code by which church bells reported the location and severity of fires. Volunteer teams of firefighters competed to earn a premium by being first to reach a fire. However, the city was dense with wooden and half-timbered houses, which tended to be tall and narrow, reflecting the shape of the building plots, and merchants operated their businesses out of their houses, so that many included warehouses containing flammables such as rubber and shellac. In addition the provision of water for firefighting, from the Elbe and canals, was inefficient: low water made pumping difficult, and the <b>leather</b> <b>hoses</b> would not slide on ladders, so that water could not be pumped above ground level. By daybreak much of the Altstadt was on fire.|$|R
5000|$|The Talmud {{speaks of}} many {{articles}} made of skins (...) and, as tanning was practiced in Talmudic times, {{it is possible}} that such articles, or at least some of them, were of leather. The strap ("reẓu'ah")is mentioned as serving various purposes. Asses were hobbled with straps; and cows were led by means of straps tied to the horns (Shab. 54b). Women used to tie their hair with leather straps (ib. 57a); and by similar means shoes and sandals were fastened to the feet (Neg. xi. 11), and the tefillin to the head and arm (Men. 35b). Flagellation ("malḳut") was performed by means of three straps—one of calfskin and two of ass'skin (Mak. 22b); straps are frequently mentioned as instruments of punishment, especially of children (Yer. Giṭ. i. 43d, et passim). It would appear that straps were used to tie up certain objects, as the untying of the strap is often used to designate relaxation (Yer. Bik. i. 64a, et passim). It is very probable that sandals generally were made of thick hide; for wooden sandals are indicated as such (Yeb. 101a, et passim). Besides shoes, the Talmud speaks of <b>leather</b> <b>hose</b> ("anpilia"), and of a kind of glove and foot-wear of skin for a cripple who was compelled to use his hands in order to move from place to place (ib. 102b).|$|R
50|$|The primary garment {{consisted}} of a knee-length woollen tunic. For the poorer theow, {{this would be the}} only clothing worn, although some may have been given woolen trousers and shoes to wear. A gebur would be able to afford woollen trousers and leather shoes, and would also carry a knife (called a seax), which signified their freedom in the eyes of medieval Anglo-Saxon society. A linen undertunic (worn under the outer woollen tunic) and linen braies (reaching to the ankle or knee) would be worn by richer peasants and nobility, along with woollen hose which would be held up by garters or decorative embroidery around the top. During the 11th century, the length of the braies decreased and the length of the hose increased, eventually resulting in a garment which somewhat resembled modern shorts. Geneatas and thegns would often have cross-gartering on their <b>hose,</b> along with <b>leather</b> turnshoes.Over the tunic, a cloak would be worn, which was held together by a brooch or, later on, a ring (functional buttons not being invented until the 13th century). There are several illustrations of warriorlike persons wearing headgear similar to Phrygian caps or helmets found in 10th and 11th century Anglo-Saxon manuscripts. It is possible, though, that these images do not depict any actual fashion of the period, but rather copies of much older Byzantine or Roman originals, little understood by the copyist.Hoods would also be worn.|$|R
60|$|The way {{was crowded}} with Laguneros, {{conspicuous}} in straw-hats; cloth jackets, red waistcoats embroidered at the back; bright crimson sashes; white knickerbockers, with black velveteen overalls, looking as if 'pointed' before and behind; brown <b>hose</b> or long <b>leather</b> gaiters ornamented with colours, and untanned shoes. Despite the heat many wore the Guanche cloak, a blanket (English) with a running string round the neck. The women covered their graceful heads with a half-square of white stuff, and deformed the coiffure by a hideous black billycock, an unpleasant memory of Wales. Some hundreds of men, women, and children {{were working on the}} road, and we were surprised by the beauty of the race, its classical outlines, oval contours, straight profiles, magnificent hair, and blue-grey eyes with black lashes. This is not the result of Guanche blood, as a town on the south-western part of the island presently showed me. Also an orderly of Guanche breed from the parts about Arico, who had served for years at the palace, was pointed out as a type. He stood six feet four, with proportional breadth; his face was somewhat lozenge-shaped, his hair straight, black like a Hindu's, and his tawny skin looked only a little darker than that of Portuguese Algarves. The beauty of the islanders results from a mixture of Irish blood. During the Catholic persecution before 1823 many fled the Emerald Isle to Tenerife, and especially to Orotava. The women's figures in youth are charming, tall, straight, and pliant as their own pine-trees. All remark their graceful gait.|$|R
