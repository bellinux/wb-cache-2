5|$|A Wing Coaster {{is a type}} {{of steel}} roller coaster {{manufactured}} by Bolliger & Mabillard where pairs of riders sit on <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> roller coaster track in which nothing is above or below the riders. Development of the Wing Coaster began between 2007 and 2008 leading to the opening of Raptor at Gardaland, the world's first Wing Coaster, on 1 April 2011. There are currently eight Wing Coasters operating worldwide.|$|E
5|$|The Staten Island Railway {{originally}} {{consisted of}} three lines, but of the three, only the north-south Main Line is in passenger service. The terminal station at St. George provides a direct connection to the Staten Island Ferry. At St. George there are twelve tracks, only ten of which are presently used for service. At Tottenville, there is a three track yard, with two tracks on <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> concrete station platform.|$|E

5|$|Mir was {{authorized}} on a 17 February 1976 decree, to design an improved {{model of the}} Salyut DOS-17K space stations. Four Salyut space stations had been launched since 1971, with three more being launched during Mirs development. It was planned that the station's core module (DOS-7 and the backup DOS-8) would be equipped {{with a total of}} four docking ports; two {{at either end of the}} station as with the Salyut stations, and an additional two ports on <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> docking sphere at the front of the station to enable further modules to expand the station's capabilities. By August 1978, this had evolved to the final configuration of one aft port and five ports in a spherical compartment at the forward end of the station.|$|E
5|$|Rebound is a two-player sports arcade game {{developed}} by Atari, Inc. and released in February 1974. In the game, two players each control paddles on <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> volleyball net, {{with a ball}} dropped {{from the top of}} the screen. The players bounce the ball back and forth across the net with the goal of scoring points by having the ball reach the bottom or side of the other player's half of the screen, with the trajectory of the ball dependent on where it strikes the paddle. The winner is the first player to reach eleven or fifteen points, depending on the game settings.|$|E
5|$|Rebound is a two-player volleyball sports game {{in which}} the players, each {{controlling}} a paddle representing a person on <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> volleyball net, attempt to score points. The horizontal paddles are moved by the players left and right on {{their side of the}} net, represented by a short dashed line. The ball, represented by a square dot, is dropped {{from the top of the}} screen in a parabolic arc; if it hits a player's paddle, it bounces in another arc according to where on the paddle it hit. Bounces from closer to the center are more vertical, while those towards the sides move mostly horizontally. This method of changing the angle of deflection is similar to the mechanics of Pong (1972), Atari's first arcade game.|$|E

5|$|Structure E4 is a {{platform}} located behind Pyramid E1 and encloses {{the eastern side}} of the Group E plaza. It faces west onto the plaza and has two access stairways, both flanked by ramps built from small slabs of stone and with cornices at the top. The platform walls are of fine workmanship, being built with well-cut and carefully fitted pumice. The front portion of the upper platform was paved with stone slabs, and a bench ran the entire length of the back of the platform. The clay floor between the paving and the bench was found to have been burnt. An offering was excavated from the central axis of the platform's base, it consisted of two ring-shaped clubs placed on <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> stone ball.|$|E

The U.N. observer team, which would be set up by the former UN Congo commander, Swedish Major General Carl von Horn. His disengagement agreement called for (1) Establishment of a demilitarized zone extending twenty kilometers on <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> demarcated Saudi Arabian Yemen border, from which all military equipment was to be excluded; (2) Stationing of UN observers within this zone {{on both sides of the}} border to observe, report and prevent any continued attempt by the Saudis to supply royalist forces.|$|E

The smaller pilasters are <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> large doorway, and are topped by a pediment. The double wooden doors have six panels, and are fronted by six steps which are almost the same width as the building. On {{the southern}} side of the building, more Ionic pilasters rise the height of the building, spread between four large windows.|$|E

5|$|The Reuleaux {{triangle}} is {{the least}} symmetric curve of constant width according to two different measures of central asymmetry, the Kovner–Besicovitch measure (ratio of area to the largest centrally symmetric shape enclosed by the curve) and the Estermann measure (ratio of area to the smallest centrally symmetric shape enclosing the curve). For the Reuleaux triangle, the two centrally symmetric shapes that determine the measures of asymmetry are both hexagonal, although the inner one has curved sides. The Reuleaux triangle has diameters that split its area more unevenly than any other curve of constant width. That is, the maximum ratio of areas on <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> diameter, another measure of asymmetry, is bigger for the Reuleaux triangle than for other curves of constant width.|$|E
5|$|The Stella power {{stations}} were {{a pair of}} now-demolished coal-fired {{power stations}} in the North East of England that were a landmark in the Tyne valley for over 40years. The stations stood on <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bend of the River Tyne: Stella South power station, the larger, near Blaydon in Gateshead, and Stella North power station near Lemington in Newcastle. Their name originated from the nearby Stella Hall, a manor house close to Stella South {{that by the time}} of their construction had been demolished and replaced by a housing estate. They operated from shortly after the nationalisation of the British electrical supply industry until two years after the Electricity Act of 1989, when the industry passed into the private sector.|$|E
5|$|The {{gatehouse}} {{and associated}} entry complex was constructed between 1854 and 1855 using convict labour. It {{was designed by}} Royal Engineer and Comptroller General Edmund Henderson, and constructed out of limestone. The gatehouse has two towers <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> narrow gate, reminiscent of those found in 13th century English castles or walled cities. Iron that had been scavenged from shipwrecks was {{used to make the}} gate, while the clock {{at the top of the}} structure was imported from England. As the main entrance, the gatehouse has remained a significant feature and landmark; since the closure of the prison, it has housed a café and office areas. Restoration was carried out in 2005, preserving the original stone facade and removing non-original rendering.|$|E

5|$|Because of Southern Rhodesia's {{small size}} {{and lack of}} major controversies, its unicameral {{parliament}} then sat only twice a year, for about three months in total, holding discussions in the afternoons <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> half-hour break for tea on the lawn. Smith's early parliamentary commitments in Salisbury therefore did not detract greatly from his ranching. His maiden speech to the Legislative Assembly, in November 1948, concerned the Union of South Africa Trade Agreement Bill, then at its second reading. He was slow {{to make an impact}} in parliament—most of his early contributions related to farming and mining—but his exertions within the party won him Stockil's respect and confidence. Janet ran Gwenoro during Smith's absences, and gave birth to his only biological child, Alec, in Gwelo on 20 May 1949.|$|E
5|$|By 1972, Pink Floyd had {{recorded}} the soundtracks to the films The Committee (1968) and More (1969), and to part of Zabriskie Point (1970). On {{the back of}} Mores success, its director Barbet Schroeder asked the band to record the soundtrack of his next major project as and when it arrived. The new film, La Vallée, featured two travellers on a spiritual quest in New Guinea, and Schroeder thought Pink Floyd would be suitable to provide the music. The group had already started working on another album, The Dark Side of the Moon, including some basic recording and live performances, but took two breaks to Strawberry Studios, Château d'Hérouville, France, <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Japanese tour, to write and record music for the film. The album was then mixed from 4–6 April at Morgan Sound Studios in London.|$|E
5|$|Each driver {{cell in the}} LIFE {{baseline}} design contained two of the high-density diode arrays {{arranged on}} <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> large slab of laser glass. The arrays were provided cooling via hook-up pipes {{at either end of}} the module. The initial laser pulse was provided by a preamplifier module similar to the one from the NIF, the output of which was switched into the main beamline via a mirror and Pockel's cell optical switch. To maximize the energy deposited into the beam from the laser glass, optical switches were used to send the beam to mirrors to reflect the light through the glass four times, in a fashion similar to NIF. Finally, focussing and optical cleanup was provided by optics on either side of the glass, before the beam exited the system through a frequency converter at one end.|$|E

5|$|Hunter's {{direction}} in some scenes {{was inspired by}} Otto Preminger's work on the 1945 film noir Fallen Angel. That film featured several scenes shot in tight spaces with a very small mise en scène; Hunter found himself using several of Preminger's techniques {{to make the most}} out of several of the episode's smaller sets such as the RR Diner. Several scenes in the episode were also shot using a split diopter lens, allowing for a greater depth of field. For example, a scene featuring Sherilyn Fenn and Richard Beymer talking had the actors at <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> room; the split diopter lens allowed for both of them to still be in sharp focus. The episode ends with a shot featuring a Dutch angle; Hunter was the only director on the series who Frost and Lynch allowed to use this shot, which was otherwise forbidden.|$|E
5|$|The book is {{illustrated}} with 82 monochrome plates and 17 maps or plans, all uncredited {{except for some}} use of Ordnance Survey maps, and so apparently the work of Hoskins himself. These are closely integrated into the text; for example, the text in chapter 1 {{is accompanied by a}} pair of diagrams showing how a holloway ('hollow way') could be formed by the digging of a 'double ditch', i.e. a pair of raised earth banks <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> ditch to mark the boundary of two estates, and supported by a photograph (Plate 13) of a sunken lane in Devon, explained by Hoskins as a boundary, from probably the seventh century, between the Saxon estates of (royal) Silverton and Exeter Abbey. The photograph shows high hedgebanks in bright sunshine, dwarfing the figure of a woman in the middle distance.|$|E
5|$|The castle is now {{entered through}} the 13th-century {{southern}} gatehouse, which faces towards the former deer park. This entrance was once {{protected by a}} 14th-century fortified bridge, also called a barbican, but only one set of stone arches remain, showing two surviving arrow slits in arched recesses. The south gatehouse has two drum towers on <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> gateway, protected by a portcullis, and would have had three floors, linked to a wall walk around the castle. It would originally have been faced with dressed stonework, which has since been removed. The north gatehouse on the opposite site of the bailey originally led into the town of Launceston. The {{first floor of the}} building was probably first used as the porter's room, then by the castle's constable, and finally later as a prison.|$|E
50|$|The {{boundaries}} of the administrative counties changed considerably over time. The reasons for this were threefold: the growth <b>of</b> towns on <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> existing boundary, the creation and extension of county boroughs {{and the elimination of}} outlying exclaves and other anomalies.|$|R
