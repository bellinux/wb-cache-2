40|$|Extract] Over 4 days in October 2004, up to 16 ectoparasite-laden Giant Sunfishes (Mola Mola) were {{observed}} off Nusa Lembongan, Indonesia, confirming indigenous reports of annual Mola agregations at a short stretch of coral reef slope. An 'assembly line' of five coral reef species cleaning separate Mola body regions was documented. Butterflyfish species (Chaetodon kleinii and Heniochus diphreutes) cleaned the ventral and head areas respectively, while wrasses (Labroides dimidiatus and Thalasoma lunare) covered flank regions. Surprisingly, of 37 observed cleaning events, ~ 40 % {{were dominated by}} large <b>Emperor</b> <b>angelfishes,</b> Pomacanthus imperator (n≤ 12;total length< 55 cm) ...|$|R
50|$|At dusk, {{a pair of}} <b>emperor</b> <b>angelfish</b> will rush to the surface, {{away from}} the reef, to mate in area where fertilized eggs can be taken away on currents, and then they then scurry {{back down to the}} reef. This {{mechanism}} not only prevents egg-eating predators from seeing their release, but the eggs are now able to disperse in areas where new populations of <b>emperor</b> <b>angelfish</b> can form. This trade-off between parental investment and fecundity allows for maximum fitness of this species.|$|E
50|$|<b>Emperor</b> <b>angelfish</b> are omnivorous, {{feeding on}} both small {{invertebrates}} and plants. Sponges and algae are their primary diet. They have bulky, strong jaws that {{are able to}} chew up the sponges, which are made up of tiny, needle-like pieces of silica (this would be the equivalent of a human chewing on small shards of glass). The digestive tract of an <b>emperor</b> <b>angelfish</b> coats its food with a layer of mucus in order to further protect itself from the sharp silica.|$|E
50|$|About 90 {{species of}} fish live {{in the waters of}} the park, among them being the <b>emperor</b> <b>angelfish,</b> Almaco jack, spotted seahorse, bluestripe snapper, pinkish basslet and two-lined monocle bream. The species of mollusc include the giant clam, horned helmet shells, {{chambered}} nautilus, and ascidians.|$|E
50|$|The Rainbow Reef {{features}} {{animals from}} the Indo-Pacific water regions {{and is the}} most colourful gallery in the exhibit, hence its name. Some of the species in this exhibit include: Picasso triggerfish, humbug dascyllus, <b>emperor</b> <b>angelfish,</b> pajama cardinalfish, unicorn surgeonfish. The exhibit also features an interactive dive show.|$|E
50|$|It bears a {{considerable}} {{resemblance to the}} <b>Emperor</b> <b>Angelfish</b> in that it undergoes changes in coloring in its development from youth to maturity. The young of the blue ring angelfish are at first a dark blue, almost black, with broad turquoise and white vertical stripes. Adults will exhibit a violet coloring with semicircular marks on {{the middle of the}} body.|$|E
50|$|SeaQuarium is the park's aquarium, {{containing}} {{a wide variety}} of exotic fish. This is also the park's chain attraction. Some of the animals here include Asian arowana, Bermuda blue angelfish, chocolate chip star, clownfish, common carp, <b>emperor</b> <b>angelfish,</b> gold-spotted spinefoot, honeycomb moray, long-spine porcupinefish, orangespine, unicornfish, orbicular batfish, pangas catfish, queen coris , red-bellied pacu, red-bellied piranha, Red Sea sailfin tang, redtail catfish, redtoothed triggerfish, reef stonefish, Siberian sturgeon, small-spotted catshark, snowflake moray, spotted sailfin suckermouth catfish, spotted unicornfish, tambaqui, Vlamingii tang, white-spotted puffer and zebra moray.|$|E
5000|$|Juveniles {{are dark}} blue with {{electric}} {{blue and white}} rings; adults have yellow and blue stripes, with black around the eyes. It takes about 24 to 30 months for an <b>emperor</b> <b>angelfish</b> to acquire its adult coloring. They grow to 40 cm (15.75 in) in length.Juvenile to adult transition may not fully occur in an aquarium. [...] Not only does their coloration change with maturity, but during mating events as well. The mask of a male will turn a dark blue, almost black, while the female will turn a bland color.|$|E
50|$|<b>Emperor</b> <b>angelfish</b> {{dwell in}} reef-associated areas at depths ranging from 1-100 m. Juveniles live alone and inhabit outer lagoon patch reefs or semi-protected exposed {{channels}} and reef flats. They tend {{to hang out}} at shrimp cleaning stations, feeding off parasites and dead skin of larger fish species. Subadults move to reef front holes and surge channels, while mature adults are found in caves in areas of rich coral growth on clear lagoon, seaward, or channel reefs. Males are territorial and will defend their habitat {{as well as the}} females living with them. An angelfish territory can be as large as 10,760 square feet. Adults are also known for making a low-frequency “knocking” sound if disturbed or threatened by divers.|$|E
50|$|The <b>emperor</b> <b>angelfish</b> (Pomacanthus imperator) is {{a species}} of marine angelfish. It is a reef-associated fish, native to the Indian and Pacific Oceans, from the Red Sea to Hawaii and the Austral Islands. It ranges from coastal East Africa and the Red Sea in the west, to the Tuamotu Islands and Line Islands. Some populations have been {{observed}} as far as southern Japan to the Great Barrier Reef in Australia, New Caledonia, and the Austral Islands. Rare sightings have been recorded in the Hawaiian Islands, Puerto Rico, and Florida. These appearances are most likely due to aquarium release. From 2010 {{there have been reports}} that the species is colonizing the southeast Mediterranean, most likely as an invader via the Suez Canal. This species is generally associated with stable populations and faces no major threats of extinction. It is a favorite among photographers, artists, and aquarists because of its unique, brilliant pattern of coloration.|$|E
