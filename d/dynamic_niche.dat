40|$|Increasingly, {{technological}} innovation creates markets for {{new products and}} services. To survive, firms must respond to these new markets. How do firms develop the capabilities necessary to succeed in such changing conditions? Some suggest that experience with previous entry builds such capabilities. Others suggest that capabilities arise from experience producing and selling to existing markets. The role of managers is also debated. Some argue that experience with existing markets causes managers to miss entry opportunities. Others argue that managers enter new markets when their firm possesses the experience needed to compete effectively. In this paper, we explore these issues by investigating entry patterns in the disk-drive industry. We investigate the effect of experience in existing markets and experience with previous market entry. We find that experience in previous markets increased {{the probability that a}} firm would enter a new market. We show that this experience had greater value if the firm entered the new market. We infer that managers chose to enter these markets to obtain this increase in value.

The progress in this field will depend crucially on the proper exploitation of stem cell technologies. Understanding the processes governing stem cell differentiation towards a desired phenotype and subsequent maturation in an organotypic manner will be key to ultimately providing realistic tissue models or therapeutics. Cardiogenesis is controlled by milieu factors that collectively constitute a so-called cardiogenic niche. The components of the cardiogenic niche are not yet fully defined but include paracrine factors and instructive extracellular matrix. Both are provided by supportive stromal cells under strict spatial and temporal control.

Pluripotent stem cells are promising cell candidates {{for the development of}} regenerative medicine therapies as they have the ability to self-renew and commit towards numerous cell types. In vivo, stem cells reside in a <b>dynamic</b> <b>niche,</b> a stem cell-specific microenvironment that possesses chemical, biological and mechanical cues, which drive the stem cell fate and renewal. The connection between stem cells and their niche is a two-way relationship consisting of both cell–cell interac‐tion and cell–extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions.

Cross-sectional analyses, based on observations from twelve Western European countries from 1984 - 1998, are presented that suggest the answer is 'yes'. By contrast, these analyses strongly suggest that for mainstream parties, policy radicalism depresses popular support. The implication of these findings is that for niche parties, it is the distinctiveness of their left-right positions that enhances their competitiveness in democratic elections.

40|$|Sustainability under a {{changing}} climate requires transitioning away from institutionalised processes, norms and cultures that underpin and reproduce unsustainable practices and development. The volume {{and diversity of}} actors, and the closeness and density of interactions and interrelationships, make urban transitions complex, contested and dynamic, challenging established management practices, institutions and governance. Therefore, enabling sustainability transitions requires social processes of adaptive, if not transformative, change and learning, facilitated by improved capacities for working across diverse forms of jurisdiction, scale, knowledge, organisations, landscapes and institutions.

40|$|The {{ecological}} {{principle of}} limiting similarity dictates that species similar in resource requirements will compete, with the superior eventually excluding the inferior competitor from the community. The observation that nonetheless apparently similar species comprise {{a significant proportion}} of the diversity in any given community has led to suggestions that competition may not in fact be an important regulator of community structure and assembly. Here we apply a recently introduced metric of species interaction, fractional (relative) abundance, to tree species of the tropical wet forest of Barro Colorado Island, Panamá, the particular community that inspired the original model of non-niche or 'neutral' community dynamics 9. We show a distribution of fractional abundances between pairs of most closely related congeneric tree species differing from that expected of competitive exclusion, but also inconsistent with expectations of simple similarity, whether such species interchangeability (a fundamental requirement of neutrality) is inferred at the community or the pair level. Similar evidence from a strikingly different dry forest has been linked to the focused, stable competition of a temporal <b>niche</b> <b>dynamic.</b> Taken together with these earlier findings, the results reported here establish a potentially widespread and important role for species interaction in the diversity and maintenance of natural communities that must be considered when inferring process from pattern.

This study was undertaken to assess the effects due to the soil application of an endophytic bacterium with multiple pathogen antagonistic potential on native bacterial community and its sustenance in agricultural soil. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was employed as a model system considering its frequent isolation as an endophyte, wide antagonistic effects reported against different phytopathogens and soil pests, and that the species is a known human pathogen which makes its usage in agriculture precarious. Employing the strain ‘GNS. 13. 2 a’ from banana, its survival in field soil and the effects upon soil inoculation were investigated by monitoring total culturable bacterial fraction as the representative indicator of soil microbial community. Serial dilution plating of uninoculated control versus P. aeruginosa inoculated soil from banana rhizosphere indicated a significant reduction in native bacterial cfu soon after inoculation compared with control soil as assessed on cetrimide- nalidixic acid selective medium against nutrient agar. Sampling on day- 4 showed a significant reduction in P. aeruginosa cfu in inoculated soil and a continuous dip thereafter registering > 99 % reduction within one week while the native bacterial population resurged with cfu restoration on par with control. This was validated in contained trials with banana plants. Conversely, P. aeruginosa showed static cfu or proliferation in axenic-soil. Lateral introduction of soil microbiome in P. aeruginosa established soil under axenic conditions or its co-incubation with soil microbiota in suspension indicated significant adverse effects by native microbial community. Direct agar-plate challenge assays with individual environmental bacterial isolates displayed varying interactive or antagonistic effects. In effect, the application of P. aeruginosa in rhizospheric soil did not serve any net benefit in terms of sustained survival. Conversely, it caused a disturbance to the native soil bacterial community. The findings highlight the need for monitoring the bio-inoculant(s) in field-soil and assessing the interactive effects with native microbial community before commercial recommendation...|$|R

40|$|SummaryHematopoietic {{stem and}} {{progenitor}} cells (HSPCs) can reconstitute and sustain the entire blood system. We generated a highly specific transgenic reporter of HSPCs in zebrafish. This {{allowed us to}} perform high-resolution live imaging on endogenous HSPCs not currently possible in mammalian bone marrow. Using this system, we have uncovered distinct interactions between single HSPCs and their niche. When an HSPC arrives in the perivascular niche, a group of endothelial cells remodel to form a surrounding pocket. This structure appears conserved in mouse fetal liver. Correlative light and electron microscopy revealed that endothelial cells surround a single HSPC attached to a single mesenchymal stromal cell. Live imaging showed that mesenchymal stromal cells anchor HSPCs and orient their divisions. A chemical genetic screen found that the compound lycorine promotes HSPC-niche interactions during development and ultimately expands the stem cell pool into adulthood.

40|$|Hematopoietic {{stem cells}} (HSCs) reside in bone marrow (BM) {{microenvironment}} / niche to self-renew and generate {{all types of}} mature blood cells in postnatal life. This process is called hematopoiesis. Normal hematopoiesis is tightly regulated by both intrinsic signaling in HSCs and extrinsic signals from BM niche. Despite the involvement of BM niche in normal and malignant hematopoiesis has been reported, how different BM cellular niche contribute to leukemia progression and how leukemia cells affect their BM niche remain largely unknown. The overall aim of this thesis {{was to determine the}} roles of BM niche cells in the regulation of different myeloid malignancies, and understand the underlying mechanisms. In study I, by taking advantage of Sipa 1 -/- mouse model, we revealed that the loss of Sipa 1 in mice led to BM niche alterations before the onset of MDS/MPN, and confirmed that the loss of Sipa 1 in BM niche, but not in hematopoietic cells led to the MDS/MPN. Moreover, we detected abnormal inflammatory cytokines and growth factors in the BM stromal cells of the disease-free young adult Sipa 1 -/- mice, which could contribute to the pathogenesis of the MDS/MPN in aged Sipa 1 -/- mice. This study provides evidence for BM niche-induced MDS/MPN and the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms. Given the distinct pathogenesis of different types of myeloid malignancies, we further investigated the contributions of BM niche to AML progression using MLL-AF 9 + AML mouse model in study II. We detected alterations of BM niche cells in symptomatic AML mice, and confirmed similar alterations of BM stromal cells in the NSG mice engrafted with primary patient AML cells. Furthermore, BM niche cells in the AML mice produced altered growth factors, cytokines, and matrix proteins. <b>Dynamic</b> BM <b>niche</b> cell analysis and gene expression assay revealed that the BM niche alterations correlated with AML burden. We next functionally determined the roles of BM MSCs marked by Ebf 2 expression in AML progression. We demonstrated that the Ebf 2 + cells participated in AML BM niche formation. Notably, the depletion of Ebf 2 + cells accelerated AML development in mice, indicating the suppressive roles of native BM niche to AML development. This study indicated that AML cells educated normal BM niche into a reinforcing AML BM niche contributing to AML progression. In study III, we found that BM MSCs altered their phenotype with reduced SCA 1 expression in non-adherent culture, emphasizing culture-related alterations of BM MSC immunophenotype. In study IV, by using LTC-IC assay and single cell PCR, we revealed diverse expressions of leukotriene signaling molecules and minor effects of ALOX 5 and CYSLT 1 antagonists on CML LSC growth, particularly in the presence of BM stromal cells in vitro. All together, we phenotypically, molecularly, and functionally characterized leukemic BM niche and determined the niche contributions to different myeloid malignancies.

40|$|Adult {{neurogenesis}} adds {{an entirely}} new level of plasticity to the brain and raises hope to use stem cell therapy to repair damaged nervous tissue. To understand the role of neurogenesis in the adult brain and to harness its potential it is of utmost importance to understand the regulation of the stem cell niches. Our group previously showed that the endozepine DBI is expressed in neuronal progenitors in the SVZ and that it reduces GABA signalling in these cells. Via this mechanism, DBI promotes the proliferation of fast dividing progenitors {{which leads to a}} strong increase in neurogenesis. Here I investigated the presence of DBI in other neurogenic niches and its role in regulating postnatal and adult neurogenesis. I found that DBI is strongly expressed in the SGZ and in the walls of the 3 rd ventricle both postnatally and in adult mice. Furthermore, I showed that DBI is present in RG cells during embryonic development. I found that DBI is expressed not only in all mouse postnatal and adult neurogenic niches but also across species in the SGZ of the Rhesus monkey and in humans. High expression levels of DBI were detected in all stem cells and in the early population of amplifying progenitors, suggesting that this protein could be considered as an indicator for stemness in the nervous tissue. Focusing on the SGZ, I showed that DBI negatively modulates the activity of the GABAA receptor in stem cells, thereby increasing their proliferation, self-renewal and astrocyte production. In summary, DBI together with GABA regulate the balance between preserving the stem cell pool and neuronal production. External factors such as environmental enrichment and physical exercise strongly enhance neurogenesis. I found in this study that DBI is essential for the pro-proliferative and pro-neurogenic effects of enriched environment and exercise. Therefore, DBI and GABA regulate SGZ neurogenesis in a close partnership enabling multiple levels of control which makes the <b>niche</b> <b>dynamic</b> and capable of reacting promptly to changes in the environment...|$|R
40|$|Environmental change {{presents}} {{the greatest challenges}} to biodiversity conservation. From climate changes to land cover conversion and pollution effects, global biodiversity faces many threats. Though conservation actions have been put into place to halt the loss of biodiversity, recent studies suggest that conservation actions have largely failed to do this. Hence, understanding the links between species responses, environmental pressures {{and the role of}} species characteristics in conferring resilience to these environmental pressures would be fundamental to develop adequate conservation measures. This thesis focuses on a range of approaches to investigate the impacts of well-known environmental pressures on the passerine community in the UK to try to uncover mechanisms underpinning species responses to environmental change. Furthermore, considering that bird species are currently been used as biodiversity indicators, it would be of great use to identify new venues to measure and monitor species responses to environmental change that would help improve the current set of indicators. Examining multiple pressures within the same analytical framework was valuable for demonstrating that land cover and pollution drivers are of equivalent importance to climate in structuring bird communities at a broad scale in the UK. Both community and niche studies revealed that winter conditions and pollution were key in structuring passerine communities together with pollution at this broad scale. In terms of colonisation and extinction processes the spatial structure of the species occupancy appeared to have a dominant role in driving the observed dynamics as well as again, climate change in terms of warming winter temperatures. Throughout this thesis, the above mentioned ecological responses were linked to species ecological traits with the aim of gaining a greater understanding of the mechanisms underpinning species’ differential responses to environmental change and identifying those trait groups that may be most vulnerable or most valuable as indicators. A significant group of characteristics that consistently appeared to be linked to species resilience to observed environmental pressures (particularly climate change) was phenological traits. Species with earlier laying dates and/or longer laying periods were associated with increasing population trends, larger colonisation rates and smaller extinction rates. Also analysis of species niches in relation to environmental pressures not only revealed the <b>dynamic</b> nature of <b>niche</b> parameters, confirming niche evolution and niche tracking in some species but also confirmed their relationship with both species characteristics and current conservation categories. Finally this study reiterated the fact that relationships between species characteristics and environmental pressures involve complex interactions that significantly affect and transform species responses to environmental pressures. For example the interaction between migratory behaviour and phenological traits (i. e. earlier laying dates and longer laying periods) meant that migrant species were less likely to have declining populations or that warming winter temperatures were associated with increased colonisation for migrants or species with more annual broods were less likely to show extinction in cells with temperature increase. All these results not only confirm the suitability of birds and particularly passerine species as indicators of environmental use and their potential and importance as part of indices and monitoring programmes but also highlights the importance of updating the next generation of indicators with measurements that can take into account important species characteristics associated with resilience to environmental pressures (i. e. phenological traits) ...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents a}} novel Bi-objective Multi-population Genetic Algorithm (BMPGA) for multimodal optimization problems. BMPGA is distinguished by {{its use of}} two separate but complementary fitness objectives designed to enhance {{the diversity of the}} overall population and exploration of the search space. This is coupled with a multi-population strategy and a clustering scheme, both of which together focus selection pressure within sub-populations, resulting in improved exploitation of promising optimum areas as well as effective identification and retention of potential optima. The practical value of BMPGA is demonstrated in several applications. In optimization of benchmark multimodal functions, it shows clear superiority over other typical multimodal GAs: Multinational GA [1], <b>Dynamic</b> <b>Niche</b> Clustering [2] and Clearing [3], with respect to overall effectiveness, general applicability and reliability. In the application of imagery ellipses detection, BMPGA is compared with both widely used Randomized Hough Transform (RHT) [4] and Sharing Genetic Algorithm (SGA) [5]. In thorough and fair experimental tests, utilizing both synthetic and real-world images, BMPGA exhibits solid advantages over RHT and SGA in terms of accuracy of recognition - even in the presence of noise or/and multiple imperfect ellipses in an image - and speed of computation. Finally, we successfully extend BMPGA to the segmentation of microscopic cells, which is a necessary first step of many automated biomedical image processing procedure...|$|E

One example is {{an abundance of}} the wild rabbit Orytolagus cuniculus in the Mediterranean zone, which contrasts with the Eurosiberian zone, where the rabbit is scarce. The feeding resource partitioning among four sympatric predators (red fox Vulpes vulpes, wild cat Felis silvestris, genet Genetta genetta and stone marten Martes foina) was analysed in the Peneda-Gerês National Park (north-west Portugal), located in the Eurosiberian region. Data on the spatial distribution of three important prey species (Apodemus sylvaticus, Microtus lusitanicus and Talpa occidentalis) were also collected to investigate their possible relationships with the feeding habits of each predator. Rodents are the staple prey for this guild of carnivores. Predators are able to supplement their diets {{with one or two}} secondary prey types: rabbits and arthropods by the largest carnivores (the red fox and the wild cat); insectivores by the small predators (the genet and the stone marten).

40|$|Aim While niche {{models are}} {{typically}} {{used to assess}} the vulnerability of species to climate change, they have been criticized for their limited assessment of threats other than climate change. We attempt to evaluate this limitation by combining niche models with life-history models to investigate the relative influence of climate change and a range of fire regimes on the viability of a long-lived plant population. Specifically, we investigate whether range shift due to climate change is a greater threat to an obligate seeding fire-prone shrub than altered fire frequency and how these two threatening processes might interact. Location Australian sclerophyll woodland and heathland. Methods The study species is Leucopogon setiger, an obligate seeding fire-prone shrub. A spatially explicit stochastic matrix model was constructed for this species and linked with a <b>dynamic</b> <b>niche</b> model and fire risk functions representing a suite of average fire return intervals. We compared scenarios with a variety of hypothetical patches, a patch framework based upon current habitat suitability and one with dynamic habitat suitability based on climate change scenarios A 1 FI and A 2. Results Leucopogon setiger was found to be sensitive to fire frequency, with shorter intervals reducing expected minimum abundances (EMAs). Spatial decoupling of fires across the landscape reduced the vulnerability of the species to shortened fire frequencies. Shifting habitat, while reducing EMAs, was less of a threat to the species than frequent fire. Main conclusions Altered fire regime, in particular more frequent fires relative to the historical regime, was predicted to be a strong threat to this species, which may reflect a vulnerability of obligate seeders in general. Range shifts induced by climate change were a secondary threat when habitat reductions were predicted. Incorporating life-history traits into habitat suitability models by linking species distribution models with population models allowed for the population-level evaluation of multiple stressors that affect population dynamics and habitat, ultimately providing a greater understanding of the impacts of global change than would be gained by niche models alone. Further investigations of this type could elucidate how particular bioecological factors can affect certain types of species under global change. ?? 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd...|$|E
