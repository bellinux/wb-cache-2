There is a significant learning gap between students from different socio-economic backgrounds, {{those who live in}} rural areas and those who belong to indigenous and Afro-descendant groups.

In mathematics, the probability differs between 10% and 48%.

Although {{relatively}} simple dichotomies of American cities, {{such as the}} Sunbelt/Snowbelt and the large-city/small-city distinctions, {{have been used to}} explain and predict other facets of urban life, more elaborate typologies, such as those produced by Duncan and others (1960) and by Nelson (1955), have remained wallflowers of urban research.

Second Regional Comparative and <b>Explanatory</b> <b>Study</b> (SERCE) data indicate that, on average, 3rd and 6th grade students have access to only three books per student in the school library. Students from lower socioeconomic status have access {{to an average of}} one book per student, while students from higher socioeconomic status have access to eight books per student. A school's location is a high determinant of the amount of books that a student will have, benefitting urban schools over rural schools. With regards to educational technologies, while there has been an increase in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) access for Latin American children and adolescents in the last decade, along with a widespeard interest in One-to-One (1-1) computing models in the past 4 years, its access and use is still too limited to produce sufficient changes in the educational practices of teachers and students. Students in the region are reaching a rate of 100 students per computer, indicating that each student has access to a few minutes of computer time a week.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{participatory}} action research <b>study,</b> using an <b>explanatory</b> case <b>study</b> design, was to conduct an intrinsic examination {{of the factors that}} contribute to the formulation of a community of scholars among “practitioner” faculty at a local satellite campus of a large University. Elliot (2009) supported that action research provides opportunities to build on social capital in education environments. As explained by Creswell (2008), participatory action research has the potential to “empower, transform, and emancipate individuals in educational settings” (p. 605). The researcher’s participation in the study makes the study social, practical, collaborative, and with intentionality to offer ideas for changes or improvements in practices (Creswell, 2008). In this presentation, we will discuss both the process and the outcomes of this study. Yin (1994) documents the use of <b>explanatory</b> case <b>study</b> approach for theory building. When coupled with Elliot’s (1991) action research model, it allows the researcher to begin with active reconnaissance of the rich archived records concerning the development of this community of scholarship. <b>Explanatory</b> case <b>study</b> designs are particularly useful when the researcher seeks to focus on a contemporary phenomenon like building a community of scholarship. This approach complements the action research focus and provides the framework for data collection and analysis. The theory generating capacity of <b>explanatory</b> case <b>study</b> designs coupled with the generation and flow of data stemming from Elliott’s action research model yielded a theoretical position concerning the building and sustaining a vibrant community of scholarship...|$|R

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND:Prognostic {{research}} studies in anesthesiology aim to identify {{risk factors for}} an outcome (<b>explanatory</b> <b>studies)</b> or calculate the risk of this outcome {{on the basis of}} patients' risk factors (predictive studies). Multivariable models express the relationship between predictors and an outcome and are used in both <b>explanatory</b> and predictive <b>studies.</b> Model development demands a strict methodology and a clear reporting to assess its reliability. In this methodological descriptive review, we critically assessed the reporting and methodology of multivariable analysis used in observational prognostic studies published in anesthesiology journals. METHODS:A systematic search was conducted on Medline through Web of Knowledge, PubMed, and journal websites to identify observational prognostic studies with multivariable analysis published in Anesthesiology, Anesthesia & Analgesia, The British Journal of Anaesthesia, and Anaesthesia in 2010 and 2011. Data were extracted by 2 independent readers. First, studies were analyzed with respect to reporting of outcomes, design, size, methods of analysis, model performance (discrimination and calibration), model validation, clinical usefulness, and STROBE (i. e., Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) checklist. A reporting rate was calculated on the basis of 21 items of the aforementioned points. Second, they were analyzed with respect to some predefined methodological points. RESULTS:Eighty-six studies were included: 87. 2 % were explanatory and 80. 2 % investigated a postoperative event. The reporting was fairly good, with a median reporting rate of 79 % (75 % in <b>explanatory</b> <b>studies</b> and 100 % in predictive studies). Six items had a reporting rate < 36 % (i. e., the 25 th percentile), with some of them not identified in the STROBE checklist: blinded evaluation of the outcome (11. 9 %), reason for sample size (15. 1 %), handling of missing data (36. 0 %), assessment of colinearity (17. 4 %), assessment of interactions (13. 9 %), and calibration (34. 9 %). When reported, a few methodological shortcomings were observed, both in <b>explanatory</b> and predictive <b>studies,</b> such as an insufficient number of events of the outcome (44. 6 %), exclusion of cases with missing data (93. 6 %), or categorization of continuous variables (65. 1 %.). CONCLUSIONS:The reporting of multivariable analysis was fairly good and could be further improved by checking reporting guidelines and EQUATOR Network website. Limiting the number of candidate variables, including cases with missing data, and not arbitrarily categorizing continuous variables should be encouraged...|$|R

40|$|Purpose - This {{paper is}} an {{extension}} to a previous empirical study that modeled the process of innovation diffusion in Australian architectural and engineering design (AED) firms. The present <b>study</b> utilised <b>explanatory</b> case <b>studies</b> {{to assist in the}} verification of this empirical model, which depicted pathways that explain the role of enabling 'climate for innovation' constructs in determining the level of innovation diffusion outcomes, and subsequent business performance in Australian AED firms. Design/methodology/approach - This paper presents the latter of a two-stage sequential mixed method research design: (1) quantitative empirical study; and (2) qualitative <b>explanatory</b> case <b>studies.</b> Specifically, this stage extracted findings from five <b>explanatory</b> case <b>studies</b> using a qualitative pattern matching analysis technique. Interview-based data collected from the case studies were analysed to formulate the relationship patterns between constructs, which were then compared with those predicted by the empirical model. This approach afforded a determination {{on the extent to which}} the case-based findings (i. e. work-setting phenomena) explained (i. e. validated) the empirical model. Findings - The results of the case studies on five Australian AED firms indicated that the model could be adequately explained by the actual phenomena. This was evident in four of the cases providing a good to perfect match, and one showing a partial match, to the predicted patterns of relationships between the model constructs. Thus, the paper presents verified empirical pathways for AED firms, which suggested that, by increasing the level of leadership for innovation, the level of team climate and organisational culture for innovation can be improved. The improved culture for innovation would then heighten the level of innovation diffusion outcomes, which could, in turn, result in an enhanced business performance. Originality/value - This paper expanded and improved upon the current understanding of how the diffusion of innovation can be accelerated within the AED firm context. By focusing on the socio-psychological processes, the paper depicts the pathways to improved innovation diffusion outcomes and business performance, through fostering a robust climate for innovation. These pathways have been constructed empirically and were verified in this paper under real-work settings. Based on the validated model and the specific insights derived from the <b>explanatory</b> case <b>studies,</b> the paper also highlights a number of strategic implications for AED firms seeking to enhance their business performance through improving innovation diffusion practices.
