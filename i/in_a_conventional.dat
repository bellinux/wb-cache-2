Boundary layer turbines are also known as cohesion-type turbine, bladeless turbine, and Prandtl layer turbine (after Ludwig Prandtl).|$|E
5|$|As {{indicated}} above, it {{was through}} the writings of Dares the Phrygian that the portrayal of Troilus as an important warrior was transmitted to medieval times. However, some authors {{have argued that the}} tradition of Troilus as a warrior may be older. The passage from the Iliad described above is read by Boitani as implying that Priam put Troilus {{on a par with the}} very best of his warrior sons. The description of him in that passage as hippiocharmên is rendered by some authorities as meaning a warrior charioteer rather than merely someone who delights in horses. The many missing and partial literary sources might include such a hero. Yet only the one ancient vase shows Troilus as a warrior falling <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>conventional</b> battle.|$|E
5|$|Australia's lower order batted the {{tourists}} into {{control on the}} second morning. Despite the loss of Lindwall for 15 at 8/275, Tallon kept on batting <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>conventional</b> manner, supported by Johnston and Ernie Toshack, who scored their highest Test scores. Both tail-enders threw the bat at the ball, which often went in vastly different directions to where they had aimed their shots. Tallon put on 45 with Johnstonwho scored 29 before holing out for 53. Ending at 350, the Australians had regained the momentum, taking 92 runs from 66 minutes of hitting in the morning.|$|E

5|$|Saint-Saëns wrote {{more than}} forty chamber works between the 1840s and his last years. One {{of the first of}} his major works in the genre was the Piano Quintet (1855). It is a straightforward, {{confident}} piece, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>conventional</b> structure with lively outer movements and a central movement containing two slow themes, one chorale-like and the other cantabile. The Septet (1880), for the unusual combination of trumpet, two violins, viola, cello, double bass and piano, is a neoclassical work that draws on 17th-century French dance forms. At the time of its composition Saint-Saëns was preparing new editions of the works of baroque composers including Rameau and Lully.|$|E
5|$|The {{aviation}} industry {{had been studying}} this problem for some time. From the mid-1940s, there was much interest in using nuclear-powered aircraft in the bomber role. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>conventional</b> jet engine, thrust is provided by heating air using jet fuel and accelerating it out a nozzle. In a nuclear engine, heat is supplied by a reactor, whose consumables last for months instead of hours. Most designs also carried {{a small amount of}} jet fuel for use during high-power portions of flight—take-off and high-speed dashes.|$|E

5|$|The {{conventional}} {{level of}} moral reasoning {{is typical of}} adolescents and adults. To reason <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>conventional</b> way is to judge the morality of actions by comparing them to society's views and expectations. The conventional level consists of {{the third and fourth}} stages of moral development. Conventional morality is characterized by an acceptance of society's conventions concerning right and wrong. At this level an individual obeys rules and follows society's norms even when there are no consequences for obedience or disobedience. Adherence to rules and conventions is somewhat rigid, however, and a rule's appropriateness or fairness is seldom questioned.|$|E
5|$|Trough systems {{convert the}} heat from the sun into electricity. Because of their {{parabolic}} shape, trough collectors can focus the sun at 30-60 times its normal intensity on a receiver pipe located along the focal line of the trough. Synthetic oil circulates through the pipe and captures this heat, reaching temperatures of 390°C (735°F). The hot oil is pumped to a generating station and routed through a heat exchanger to produce steam. Finally, electricity is produced <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>conventional</b> steam turbine. The SEGS plants operate on natural gas on cloudy days or after dark, and natural gas provides 25% of the total output.|$|E
5|$|Before 1914, Southern Rhodesia's {{police force}} was the British South Africa Police (BSAP), first raised in 1889 and reconstituted {{into a more}} {{permanent}} form in 1896. This paramilitary, mounted infantry force was theoretically also the country's standing army. Organised along military lines, it served in the First and Second Matabele Wars of the 1890s, operated on Britain's side in the Anglo-Boer War of 1899–1902 (alongside the specially-raised Rhodesia Regiment), and by 1914 comprised about 1,150 men (including officers). Reserves existed {{in the form of}} the Southern Rhodesia Volunteers, an all-white amateur force with a paper strength of 2,000 intended for mobilisation against local uprisings. Few doubted the Volunteers' enthusiasm, but they were not extensively trained or equipped; though perhaps useful in a Rhodesian bush skirmish, most observers agreed they would be no match for professional soldiers <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>conventional</b> war. In any case, the Volunteers' enlistment contracts bound them for domestic service only.|$|E

5|$|The next day, the English crowd {{filled the}} ground early, anticipating a strong showing {{from the home}} team after their {{promising}} start on the first day, but Australia's lower order batted their team into control on the second morning. Tallon and Lindwall batted confidently {{from the start of}} the play, and the latter hit two cover drives for four from Bedser after the new ball was taken. O'Reilly said Lindwall was playing in the same manner as when he made his maiden Test century in the last Ashes series, but he then played around a straight ball from Bedser, and was bowled for 15 to leave the score at 275/8. Tallon kept on batting <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>conventional</b> manner, while Johnston and Toshack played adventurously, registering the highest Test scores of their careers. Both Johnston and Toshack swung hard at the ball, which often went in vastly different directions to where they had aimed their shots. Australia's wicket-keeper put on 45 with Johnstonwho scored 29before becoming Bedser's second victim of the morning, holing out to Yardley for 53. Toshack came out to join Johnston with the score at 320/9 and the last pair put on 30 more runs before the latter was stumped from Wright's leg spin, having overbalanced while leaning onto the front foot and trying to hit a ball for six. The Australians had regained the momentum, adding 92 runs in 66 minutes of hitting in the morning. One sequence of two overs from Edrich was taken for 28 runs, with many balls being unintentionally spooned over the slips or the covers from mishits. Both Johnston and Toshacknot known for their batting abilityplayed without inhibitions, joyfully revelling in their luck. Yardley was later criticised for not bringing Wright into the attack at an earlier stage, as the Australian tail was dealing efficiently with the English pacemen. Bedser was the most successful of the bowlers, ending with 4/100 from 43 overs, while debutant Coxon took 2/90 from 35 overs. The off spin of Laker was used sparingly, accounting for only seven overs, whereas the part-time medium pace of Edrich and Yardley had combined for 23 overs.|$|E
25|$|<b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>conventional</b> {{mechanically}} agitated cell, {{the void}} fraction is low (5–10%) and the bubble size is large (2–3mm), {{which results in}} a low interfacial area with a low probability of particle–bubble contact. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>conventional</b> flotation column, the void fraction is similarly low, and so the probability of particle–bubble contact is increased by increasing {{the height of the}} column to provide greater residence time.|$|E
