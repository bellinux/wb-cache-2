5|$|The carvings at {{the east}} {{entrance}} are battered and blurry. One in {{the southeast corner of}} the mandapa (see 2 on plan) depicts Shiva and Parvati in Mount Kailash in the Himalayas, and the shows the Umamaheshvara story. The scene includes rocky terrain and clouds layered horizontally. On top of a rock sit the four-armed Shiva and Parvati by his side. Nandi stands below her, while celestial apsaras float on the clouds above. There are traces of a crown and a disc behind Shiva, but it is all damaged. The scene <b>is</b> <b>crowded</b> with accessory figures, which may be because the eastern entrance was meant to have a devotional focus.|$|E
5|$|While the Slaying of Goliath is a {{relatively}} simple composition with the two protagonists centrally placed and the only other figures being dimly seen observers, the Brazen Serpent picture <b>is</b> <b>crowded</b> with figures and separate incidents as the various individuals who have been attacked by snakes struggle and die or turn toward the icon that will save them. This is the most Mannerist of Michelangelo's earlier compositions at the Sistine Chapel, picking up the theme of human distress begun in the Great Flood scene and carrying it forward into the torment of lost souls in the Last Judgement, which was later painted below.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to examine the effect of government expenditure on private domestic investment in Indonesia. Based on the previous studies, there is no clear justification whether government expenditure <b>is</b> <b>crowding</b> in or crowding out the private investment. Using quarterly time series data during period 1985 to 2012, the empirical results show that government expenditure (total) <b>is</b> <b>crowding</b> out private domestic investment in both short term and long term. Specifically, government expenditure for public service <b>is</b> <b>crowding</b> out the private investment in both short term and long term. Unlike public services, the economic expenditure <b>is</b> <b>crowding</b> in the private investment in the long term. Moreover, health expenditure <b>is</b> <b>crowding</b> out the private investment in the short term while education expenditure <b>is</b> <b>crowding</b> out in the short term and crowding in in the long term...|$|R

25|$|Rochester's East End district, located downtown, is {{well known}} {{as the center of}} the city's nightlife. It is the {{stopping}} point for East Avenue, which along with the surrounding streets <b>is</b> <b>crowded</b> with nightclubs, lounges, coffee shops, bars, and high-end restaurants. The Eastman School of Music, one of the top musical institutes in the nation, and its auditorium are also located within the neighborhood. The Eastman Theatre now plays host to the Rochester Philharmonic Orchestra and other musical/drama events.|$|E
25|$|The space <b>is</b> <b>crowded</b> {{and it is}} to be {{expected}} that the wall spaces would be divided by pilasters of low projection. But Michelangelo has chosen to use paired columns, which, instead of standing out boldly from the wall, he has sunk deep into recesses within the wall itself. In San Lorenzo's church nearby, Brunelleschi used little scrolling console brackets to break the strongly horizontal line of the course above the arcade. Michelangelo has borrowed Brunelleschi’s motifs and stood each pair of sunken columns on a pair of twin console brackets. Pevsner says the “Laurenziana... reveals Mannerism in its most sublime architectural form”.|$|E

25|$|Originally air {{turbulence}} {{was kept}} to a minimum by keeping all signage flat to the tunnel walls. Now the ventilation space above head height <b>is</b> <b>crowded</b> with ducting, conduits, cameras, speakers and equipment acting as a baffle plates with predictable reductions in flow. Often electronic signs have their flat surface at right angles to the main air flow, causing choked flow. Temporary sign boards that stand at the top of escalators also maximise turbulence. The alterations to the ventilation system are important, not only to heat exchange, but also the quality of the air at platform level, particularly given its asbestos content.|$|E
25|$|The church's cloister {{is now the}} Museo Regional (Regional Museum). Built between 1660 and 1698,(elcima) {{the monastery}} it houses {{was the first in}} the city, built by Franciscans to evangelize the native populations here. The {{architecture}} is representative of Franciscan style, with simple lines and decoration. The museum exhibits artifacts from the pre-Hispanic, colonial and post-Independence eras of this region's history. The Plaza de la Constitución and Jardin Zenea plaza (named after liberal governor Benito Zenea) were part of the atrium of the church and monastery. This area <b>is</b> <b>crowded</b> every night and all day on Sunday, when the municipal band plays dance music from the 1940s to the 1960s.|$|E

This also includes rides on a Bullock cart, an Auto rikshaw, and the public bus which is world-famous for ornamental art on the outside as well as the inside.

25|$|Following the {{dissolution}} of the Soviet Union in 1991, Yalta has struggled economically. Many of the nouveaux riches of ex-Soviet citizens began going to other European holiday resorts, now that they had the freedom and money to travel; conversely, the impoverishment of many ex-Soviet citizens meant that they could no longer afford to go to Yalta. The town's transport links have been significantly reduced with the end of almost all passenger traffic by sea. The longest trolleybus line in Europe goes from the train station in Simferopol to Yalta (almost 90km). Yalta <b>is</b> <b>crowded</b> in the vacation season (July–August) and prices for accommodation are very high. Most of the tourists are from countries of the former Soviet Union; in 2013, about 12% of tourists to the Crimea were Westerners from more than 200 cruise ships.|$|E
25|$|Michelangelo {{takes all}} Brunelleschi’s {{components}} and bends {{them to his}} will. The Library is upstairs. It is a long low building with an ornate wooden ceiling, a matching floor and crowded with corrals finished by his successors to Michelangelo’s design. But it is a light room, the natural lighting streaming through a long row of windows that appear positively crammed between the order of pilasters that march along the wall. The vestibule, on the other hand, is tall, taller than it is wide and <b>is</b> <b>crowded</b> by a large staircase that pours out of the library in what Pevsner refers to as a “flow of lava”, and bursts in three directions when it meets the balustrade of the landing. It is an intimidating staircase, {{made all the more}} so because the rise of the stairs at the center is steeper than at the two sides, fitting only eight steps into the space of nine.|$|E
25|$|Much of the state’s {{economic}} activity {{is related to}} its border with the United States state of Arizona. People from both countries regularly cross the border to shop. The border crossings are essential {{to many of the}} communities that straddle the border, not only in the main crossings in Nogales and Agua Prieta, but also in the smaller ones such as Naco. On each side of the border, there is a fifteen km strip, which is designated as a commercial trade zone, where both Mexicans and United States citizens can enter with limited visa requirements. Many Arizonans travel and cross one of the crossings to eat and shop, mostly to experience something different from doing the same at home. Most spend only the day. The most popular of these border crossings is Nogales, which is just over an hour south from Tucson by highway. The main shopping street in Nogales is Avenida Obregón, which <b>is</b> <b>crowded</b> with pharmacies with lower prices than in the United States, stores selling knock offs of designer names such as Louis Vuitton, Cuban cigars, tequila, cheaper cigarettes and Mexican handcrafts, including some of the best work from artisans from Puebla, Guadalajara, Michoacán and Oaxaca. Although these stores cater mostly to Americans crossing the border, it is still possible to negotiate prices. Many of these communities on the Mexican side also have bars close to the port of entry, taking advantage of Mexico’s lower drinking age of 18.|$|E

25|$|To Spain and the Teutonic {{countries}} of Europe {{we look for}} the most important object of church decoration, the retable; the Reformation accounting for the absence in England of any work of this iec kind. The magnificent altar-piece in Schleswig cathedral was carved by Hans Bruggerman, and consists, like many others, {{of a number of}} panels filled with figures standing some four or five deep. The figures in the foremost rows are carved entirely separate, and stand out by themselves, while the background is composed of figure work and architecture, etc., in diminishing perspective. The panels are grouped together under canopy work forming one harmonious whole. The genius of this great carver shows itself in the large variety of the facial expression of those wonderful figures all instinct with life and movement, In France few retables exist outside the museums. In the little church of Marissel, not far from Beauvais, there is a retable consisting of eleven panels, the crucifixion being, of course, the principal subject. And there is a beautiful example from Antwerp in the Muse Cluny, Paris; the pierced tracery work which decorates the upper part being {{a good example of the}} style composed of interlacing segments of circles so common on the Continent during late Gothic times and but seldom practised in England. ln Spain the cathedral of Valladolid was famous for its retable, and Alonso Cano and other sculptors frequently used wood for large statuary, which was painted in a very realistic way with the most startlingly lifelike effect. Denmark also possessed a school of able wood-carvers who imitated the great altar-pieces of Germany. A very large and well-carved example still exists in the cathedral of Roskilde. But besides these great altarpieces tiny little models were carved on a scale the minuteness of which staggers the beholder. Triptychs and shrines, etc., measuring but a few inches were filled in with tracery and figures that excite the utmost wonder. In the British Museum there is such a triptych (Flemish, I 511); the center panel, measuring an inch or two square, <b>is</b> <b>crowded</b> with figures in full relief and in diminishing perspective, after the custom of this period. This rests on a semicircular base which is carved with the Lord's Supper, and is further ornamented with figures and animals. The whole thing inclusive measures about 9 in. high, and, with the triptych wings open, 5 in. wide. The extraordinary delicacy and minuteness of detail of this microscopic work baffle description. There is another such a piece, also Flemish, in the Wallace collection, which rivals that just referred to in rni& applied talent. For, marvellous as these works of art are, they fail to satisfy. They make ones eyes ache, they worry one as to how the result could ever have been obtained, and after the first astonishment one must ever feel that the same work of art on a scale large enough for a cathedral could have been carved with half the labor.|$|E

However, Elijah's role as a prophet was one marked by accusation and warnings to repent, and the purpose of his translation into Heaven was traditionally seen as so that he might stand before God to condemn Israel for its sins. In four of the five most highly finished [...] "medallions" [...] the space <b>is</b> <b>crowded</b> with figures in violent action, similar to Michelangelo's cartoon for the Battle of Cascina.|$|E

500|$|Regarding Shakespeare's weaving {{together}} of the story's threads, Hazlitt marvels at the [...] "ease and conscious unconcern" [...] with which [...] "he most straggling and seemingly casual incidents are contrived [...] {{in such a}} manner as to lead at last to the most complete developement of the catastrophe." [...] Again, he broadens the discussion and argues against the view of Dr. Johnson [...] "that Shakespear was generally inattentive to the winding-up of his plots. We think the contrary is true; and we might cite in proof of this remark not only the present play, but the conclusion of Lear, of Romeo and Juliet, of Macbeth, of Othello, even of Hamlet, and of other plays of less moment, in which the last act <b>is</b> <b>crowded</b> with decisive events brought about by natural means." ...|$|E
500|$|Writing for The Columbian, Angela Allen {{commented that}} {{the first issue of}} the {{magazine}} [...] "shows attitude and literary writing, tosses off lots of names, does a terrific fall culture calendar and digs into a couple of issues, including the Trail Blazers", but was also critical, noting: [...] "Its design <b>is</b> <b>crowded</b> and the type is too small to read for most of us without wearing a pair of 'reader' specs." [...] Tom Boyer of The Seattle Times described the magazine as [...] "a smart mix of reader-friendly features and award-winning journalism". Writing in The Oregonian, Steve Duin commented that he appreciated the lists published in the magazine: [...] "Because I'm addicted to lists -- and the bigger the better -- the best part of my month is the morning that copy of Portland Monthly lands like a wounded halibut on my desk." ...|$|E
500|$|Dostoyevsky's Petersburg is {{the city}} of unrelieved poverty; [...] "magnificence {{has no place in}} it, because magnificence is external, formal abstract, cold". Dostoyevsky connects the city's {{problems}} to Raskolnikov's thoughts and subsequent actions. The crowded streets and squares, the shabby houses and taverns, the noise and stench, all are transformed by Dostoyevsky into a rich store of metaphors for states of mind. Donald Fanger asserts that [...] "the real city ... rendered with a striking concreteness, is also a city of the mind in the way that its atmosphere answers Raskolnikov's state and almost symbolizes it. It <b>is</b> <b>crowded,</b> stifling, and parched." [...] The inner turmoil suffered by Raskolnikov can also be perceived as a Shakespearean pathetic fallacy. For example, the great storm in Shakespeare's King Lear reflects the state of the titular character's mind, much like the chaos, disorder and noise of St. Petersburg reflects the state of Raskolnikov's mind.|$|E
