40|$|Abstract—Streamlined {{switching}} between computational {{resources in}} order to select the most suitable computational environment for an application execution is a crucial component of utility-like computing. However, heterogeneity obstructs multitarget deployment for complex and multi-dependency scientific and engineering codes and makes this goal intractable. In this paper, we describe {{a proposal for a}} metadeployment toolkit, called ADAPT, based on reusable recipes that address appropriate match-up between an application and an execution platform. Our research aims at exploring challenges posed by transparent application deployment with all its prerequisites on heterogeneous resources. As some IaaS clouds and grids accept customized OS images, we explore application-oriented <b>image</b> <b>assembly</b> to further improve deployment for these specific targets.

40|$|The manual {{execution}} of reassembling a fragmented image is very difficult. To overcome this difficulty {{a new technique}} {{was introduced in the}} existing system called “The novel integrated color based image fragments reassembly technique”. This technique is divided into four steps, which is based on color. Initially, the spatial adjacent image fragment is discovered. The second operation is to discovery of matching contour segments of adjacent image fragments. The next step is to find the appropriate geometrical transformation for an image fragments contour alignment. Finally the overall <b>image</b> <b>assembly</b> is done via novel based algorithms. In proposing system, the same reassembly technique is applied but additionally the shape alignment algorithm is used to utilize the shape of the fragment contours in order to perform matching. This will produce very satisfactory reassembly results and also it can lead to more efficient, significant reduction in human effort.

From the NST/Halpha and the SDO/AIA~ 304 A observations we found that each flare developed a jet structure that evolved {{in a manner similar}} to evolution of the blowout jet : 1) an inverted-Y shape jet appeared and drifted away from its initial position; 2) jets formed a curtain-like structure that consisted of many fine threads accompanied with subsequent brightenings near the footpoints of the fine threads; and finally 3) the jet showed a twisted structure visible near the flare maximum. Analysis of the HMI data showed that both the negative magnetic flux and the magnetic helicity have been gradually increasing in the positive polarity region indicating the continuous injection of magnetic twist before and during the series of flares. Based on these results, we suggest that the continuous emergence of twisted magnetic flux played an important role in producing a successive flares and developing a series of blowout jets.

The coronal loops then undergo an apparent slipping motion following the same path of R 3, after a ∼ 80 min delay. To understand the underlying physics, we investigate the magnetic configuration and the thermal structure of the flaring region. Our results are in favor of a slipping-type reconnection followed by the thermodynamic evolution of coronal loops. In comparison with those previously reported slipping reconnection events, this one proceeds across a particularly long distance (∼ 60 Mm) {{over a long period of}} time (∼ 50 min), and shows two clearly distinguished phases: the propagation of the footpoint brightening driven by nonthermal particle injection and the apparent slippage of loops governed by plasma heating and subsequent cooling...|$|E

40|$|X-ray {{crystallography}} {{has been}} around for 100 years and remains the preferred technique for solving molecular structures today. However, its reliance on the production of sufficiently large crystals is limiting, considering that crystallization cannot be achieved for a vast range of biomolecules. A promising way of circumventing this problem is the method of serial femtosecond imaging of single-molecules or nanocrystals utilizing an X-ray free-electron laser. In such an approach, X-ray pulses brief enough to outrun radiation damage and intense enough to provide usable diffraction signals are employed. This way accurate snapshots can be collected one at a time, despite the sample molecule exploding immediately following the pulse due to extreme ionization. But as opposed to in conventional crystallography, the spatial orientation of the molecule at the time of X-ray exposure is generally unknown. Consequentially, assembling the snapshots to form a three-dimensional representation of the structure of interest is cumbersome, and normally tackled using algorithms to analyze the diffraction patterns. Here we explore the idea that the explosion data can provide useful insights regarding the orientation of ubiquitin, a eukaryotic regulatory protein. Through two series of molecular dynamics simulations totaling 588 unique explosions, we found {{that a majority of the}} carbon atoms prevalent in ubiquitin are directionally limited in their respective escape paths. As such we conclude it to be theoretically possible to orient a sample with known structure based on its explosion pattern.

High resolution imaging of the chromospheric H-alpha 656. 28 nm spectral line core and wings can, under certain circumstances, allow one to deduce the topology of the local magnetic environment of the solar atmosphere where its observed.

We identify, through analysis of three datasets, large-scale catastrophic cooling in coronal loop-tops and the existence of multi-thermal, multi-stranded sub-structures. Many cool strands even extend fully-intact from loop-top to foot-point. We discover that coronal loop fine-scale strands can appear bunched with as many as 8 parallel strands, within an AIA coronal loop cross-section.

The instant period was found to decrease from 240 to 120 s, and {{the speed of the}} wavefronts was in the range of ~ 664 – 1416 km s− 1. Almost simultaneously, quasi-periodic bursts with similar instant periods, ~ 70 and ~ 140 s, occur in the microwave emission and in decimetric type IV and type III radio bursts, and in the soft X-ray emission. The magnetic field configuration of the flare site was consistent with a breakout topology, i. e., a quadrupolar field along with a magnetic null point. The quasi-periodic rapidly propagating wavefronts of the EUV emission are interpreted as a fast magnetoacoustic wave train. The observations suggest that the fast-mode waves are generated during the quasi-periodic magnetic reconnection in the cusp region above the flare arcade loops. For the first time, we provide evidence of a tadpole wavelet signature at about 70 – 140 s in decimetric (245 / 610 MHz) radio bursts, along with the direct observation of a coronal fast-mode wave train in EUV.

A critical issue in double-sided assemblies is the thermal cycling reliability performance of the device-to-board level attachment. In this paper, the effects of components placed {{on both sides of}} the test board were studied. The components included CSPs, BGAs, QFPs and chip capacitors. To assess the assembly flexural stiffness, a three-point bending measurement was performed and the stiffness used as a parameter for investigating the effect of assembly stiffness on the thermal cycling reliability. Cyclesto-failure were documented for all assemblies and the data were used to calculate the characteristic life. In addition, moiré interferometry was used to study the displacement distribution in the solder joints at specific locations in the packages. Data from the reliability and moiré measurements were correlated with predictions generated from three-dimensional finite element models of the assemblies. The models incorporated nonlinear and time-temperature dependent solder material properties and they were used to estimate the fatigue life of the solder joints and to obtain an estimate of the overall package reliability using Darveaux’s crack propagation method.
