50|$|The <b>Daurian</b> <b>redstart</b> (Phoenicurus auroreus) {{is a small}} {{passerine}} bird from temperate Asia. In Japan, it {{is known}} as jōbitaki (ジョウビタキ).|$|E
50|$|The {{region has}} given {{its name to}} various animal species {{including}} Daurian hedgehog, and the following birds: Asian brown flycatcher (Muscicapa daurica), Daurian jackdaw, Daurian partridge, <b>Daurian</b> <b>redstart,</b> Daurian starling, Daurian shrike and the red-rumped swallow (Hirundo daurica). The Mongolian wild ass (Equus hemionus hemionus) is regionally extinct from the region.|$|E
50|$|The black {{redstart}} {{is a member}} of a Eurasian clade which also includes the <b>Daurian</b> <b>redstart,</b> Hodgsons redstart, the white-winged redstart, and maybe Przevalskis redstart. The present species ancestors diverged from about 3 million years ago (mya) (Late Pliocene) onwards and spread throughout much of Eurasia from 1.5 mya onward. It is not very closely related to the common redstart. As these are separated by different behaviour and ecological requirements and have not evolved fertilisation barriers, the two European species can nonetheless produce apparently fertile and viable hybrids.|$|E
50|$|<b>Daurian</b> <b>redstarts</b> favour open forests, forest edges, {{agricultural}} margins, and {{are also}} commonly found in parks and urban gardens. They are reasonably confiding and often allow humans to approach quite closely before moving off. It breeds in the summer months, with a mated pair of the nominate subspecies having been encountered in early May.|$|R
40|$|A list of {{breeding}} birds for Tsetserleg and its surroundings is {{given for the}} first time, and additions are noted for the Khor go-T erkhiin Tsagaan Nuur National Park The presence of Eurasian Grif fons and Lammer geiers in the Khangai mountains is confirmed, and Black-headed Gulls suspected {{of breeding}} near Tsagaan Nuur, a new locality. An apparent marked increase in breeding/summering numbers of Tufted Duck and Velvet Scoter and a possible range expansion of <b>Daurian</b> <b>Redstarts</b> was noted. Mass mortality was observed in House Sparrows from eating moths...|$|R
50|$|Two {{subspecies}} are accepted. The nominate P. p. phoenicurus {{is found}} all over Europe and reaches into Siberia. To the southeast, subspecies P. p. samamisicus is found from the Crimean Peninsula through Turkey, the Middle East, and into Central Asia. It is slightly smaller than P. p. phoenicurus and in adult males has white outer webs in the remiges to some extent, forming a pale to whitish wing-patch {{similar to the}} one seen in black redstart and <b>Daurian</b> <b>redstart.</b> This patch is also present but less conspicuous in immature males, and sometimes in adult females. The subspecies intergrade widely in Turkey and the southern Balkans.|$|E
