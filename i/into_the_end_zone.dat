5|$|Georgia's punt rolled <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>zone</b> for a touchback, {{and with}} 1:28 {{remaining}} in the game, Virginia Tech began the final drive on its own 20-yard line. Any tension was soon defused by the Georgia defense, which forced threeincompletions and a sack. Glennon's attempt at a Hail Mary pass fell short, giving Georgia the win with a final score of 31–24.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech {{began its}} first full drive {{of the fourth}} quarter at its 41-yard line with 10:21 {{remaining}} in the game. Tech transitioned into a running strategy, maximizing {{the amount of time}} used off the game clock between each play. On the drive's first play, Stith was tackled for a one-yard loss. On its second play, Stith regained the lost yard. The third-down play was an incomplete pass by Clark, and the Hokies punted after going three and out. The kick rolled <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>zone</b> for a touchback, and Alabama's offense began at its 20-yard line. Alexander was tackled for a two-yard loss, then Zow threw an interception to Anthony Midget, who returned the ball all the way <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>zone</b> for a Virginia Tech defensive touchdown. The extra point was good, and Tech extended its lead to 387 with 7:33 remaining in the game.|$|E
5|$|Following Florida State's kickoff and a 38-yard return, Virginia Tech's offense {{began work}} at its 45-yard line. On the second {{play of the}} drive, Noel {{completed}} a 55-yard pass to Andre Davis, who ran <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>zone</b> for Virginia Tech's second touchdown of the game. The extra point kick was good, and Virginia Tech regained the lead, 1713, with 40seconds remaining in the quarter.|$|E

50|$|A {{touchdown}} is a {{means of}} scoring in both American and Canadian football. Whether running, passing, returning a kickoff or punt, or recovering a turnover, a team scores a touchdown by advancing <b>the</b> ball <b>into</b> <b>the</b> opponent's <b>end</b> <b>zone.</b>|$|R
5|$|In {{the second}} half, defense {{continued}} to dominate as Tech built a lead. The Hokies scored the only points {{of a third}} quarter as running back Lee Suggs ran <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>zone</b> from one yard out, allowing Tech to take a 17–10 lead into the fourth quarter. The Falcons didn't give up easily, however. Air Force kicker Joey Ashcroft cut into the Tech lead with a 21-yard field goal. Tech matched the score later in the quarter to restore the one-touchdown lead. As time ran down, Air Force had one final chance {{to tie the game}} and send it into overtime. Beginning at its own 18-yard line with 4:11 left to play, the Falcons drove deep into Tech territory. With seven seconds remaining, Air Force quarterback Chance Harridge tried to scramble <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>zone,</b> but was stopped before the goal line by Tech cornerback Ronyell Whitaker. The defensive stop preserved the 20–13 Hokie victory, and Tech quarterback Bryan Randall was named the game's most valuable player.|$|E
5|$|Maryland first scored with a halfback option, when Chris Turner {{pitched to}} Da'Rel Scott, who {{connected}} with Darrius Heyward-Bey for a nine-yard pass <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>zone.</b> In {{the second and}} third quarters, Maryland placekicker Obi Egekeze made fourfield goals. In the final quarter, Danny Oquendo brought down a short pass from Turner and ran it in past two defenders for a touchdown totaling 50yards.|$|E
5|$|On {{the ensuing}} kickoff, Egekeze {{attempted}} {{to kick the}} ball as it fell off the tee. This resulted in an unintentional squib that was returned 36yards to the Terps' nine-yard line. Nevada's Kaepernick attempted to rush but was stopped for no gain. On the next play, he threw the ball <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>zone,</b> but it was intercepted by Maryland safety Kenny Tate, resulting in a touchback. The Terps started on their own 20-yard line, and running back Davin Meggett rushed for 13yards and a first down. Turner then linked up with freshman receiver Ronnie Tyler for another first down at the Maryland 49-yard line. After a false start penalty, the Terps were unable to gain a first down and punted the ball away. The ball rolled <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>zone</b> for a touchback, and Nevada started the final drive of the quarter at its 20-yard line. Kaepernick then passed for two first downs, picked up another due to a pass interference call against Maryland, and scrambled for yet another. He then handed off to Taua, who rushed 17yards for a touchdown. Nevada re-took the lead, 14–13, with 46 seconds remaining in the quarter.|$|E
5000|$|The Cycledrome was an American {{football}} stadium and velodrome located in Providence, Rhode Island. [...] Its name derived from its intended {{use as a}} bicycle racing stadium (velodrome) when {{it was built in}} 1925 by sports promoter Pete Laudati. The stadium was home to the Providence Steam Roller of the National Football League (NFL) from 1925 to 1933, who played their games in the infield of the velodrome. The football field was snugly surrounded by a wooden track with steeply-banked ends, which cut sharply <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>zones</b> and reduced them to just five yards in depth. During football games, temporary seating was permitted on the straight-away portion of the track, which was so close to the field that players, after being tackled, often found themselves in the stands.|$|R
50|$|In {{football}} CTF the map {{contains a}} football {{in the middle}} of a map instead of a flag. Maps are usually designed similar to that of a football field. Both teams battle to carry <b>the</b> football <b>into</b> <b>the</b> opposite <b>end</b> <b>zone</b> (capture zone) of the map to score. The winning team is the team that reaches the score limit first or has the highest score within the time limit of the game.|$|R
5000|$|Under {{college and}} NFL rules, if the {{defensive}} team gains possession and advances the ball {{the length of}} <b>the</b> field <b>into</b> <b>the</b> opposite <b>end</b> <b>zone</b> on <b>the</b> try (for example by an interception or a fumble recovery, or by blocking a kick and legally recovering the ball), they score two points. This is officially recorded as a touchdown scored by the defense. The NCAA adopted this rule in 1988; the NFL added this in 2015.|$|R
5|$|The {{fourth quarter}} began with Florida State in {{possession}} of the ball and facing a third down and five yards. On the first play of the quarter, Rix {{was hit by a}} Virginia Tech defender, but not before he released a 77-yard pass to Walker, who ran <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>zone</b> for a touchdown. The extra point try was good, and Florida State regained the lead, 2017, with 14:48 remaining in the game.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{outcome was}} in doubt {{until the final}} minute of play. With 19seconds left on the game clock, Vince Young ran for a {{touchdown}} and regained the lead for the Longhorns. He followed up by running the ball <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>zone</b> for a two-point conversion. Leinart had time to attempt one pass but his pass fell out of bounds as time expired; UT beat USC by the score of 41–38.|$|E
5|$|The kick bounced out {{of bounds}} at the Clemson 44-yard line, and Virginia Tech's offense {{returned}} to the field. On the first play, Vick attempted a pass <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>zone.</b> The throw was intercepted by Clemson defender Robert Carswell, who downed {{the ball in the}} end zone for a touchback. The interception was the final play of the third quarter, which ended with Virginia Tech in the lead, 3413.|$|E
50|$|Seattle headed on {{the road}} for the final game of the season, as they faced the Philadelphia Eagles on a cold day at Veterans Stadium. The Eagles entered the game with a 3-10-0 record. Philadelphia scored the lone {{touchdown}} in the first quarter, as Tom Sullivan had a four-yard rush <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Seahawks' <b>end</b> <b>zone</b> to give <b>the</b> Eagles a 7-0 lead. In the second quarter, Sullivan rushed for his second touchdown, this time a one-yard rush at the goal line, as Philadelphia took a 14-0 lead. The Seahawks got on the scoreboard when John Leypoldt connected for a 24-yard field goal, as the score was 14-3 for the Eagles at halftime. The Eagles took a 17-3 lead in the third quarter as Horst Muhlmann had a 33-yard field goal, then Philadelphia took a 24-3 lead as Charlie Smith rushed for three yards <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Seattle <b>end</b> <b>zone.</b> In <b>the</b> fourth quarter, Muhlmann had his second field goal of the game, making the score 27-3 for Philadelphia. The Seahawks cut the lead to 27-10, as Steve Largent caught a nine-yard touchdown pass from Jim Zorn for the final score of the game.|$|R
50|$|While the {{opposing}} team has possession, the defense attempts to prevent the offense from advancing the ball and scoring. If an offensive player loses the ball during play (a fumble) or the ball is caught by a defensive player while still in the air (an interception), the defense may attempt to run <b>into</b> <b>the</b> offense's <b>end</b> <b>zone</b> for a touchdown. The defense may also score points by tackling the ball carrier in <b>the</b> offense's own <b>end</b> <b>zone,</b> called a safety (which is worth two points).|$|R
50|$|The Posse {{started with}} wins over the Sacramento Gold Miners and Saskatchewan Roughriders, but things quickly went downhill. Part {{of the problem}} was lack of {{familiarity}} with the Canadian game. For instance, during a game against the B.C. Lions, Vanover signaled for a fair catch--not knowing that there is no fair catch in Canadian football. <b>The</b> ball rolled <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Posse <b>end</b> <b>zone,</b> and <b>the</b> Lions recovered it for a touchdown. Players openly complained about the apathy of their coaches and teammates.|$|R
5|$|The {{second quarter}} began with Georgia Tech facing first down, in {{possession}} of the ball at the Clemson 18-yard line. On the first play of the quarter, Dwyer gained 10 yards and a first down with a running play to the Clemson eight-yard line. Three plays later, Dwyer completed the Yellow Jackets' scoring drive with a run <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>zone.</b> The touchdown and extra point gave Georgia Tech its first lead of the game, 10–7, with 13:30 remaining.|$|E
5|$|Trailing by 11, {{and with}} time running down, Texas needed to score quickly. Brown threw an {{incomplete}} pass, then was sacked by the Virginia Tech defense. During the sack, Brown fumbled, {{and the ball}} {{was picked up by}} Virginia Tech's Jim Baron who returned it <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>zone</b> for a Virginia Tech defensive touchdown. The extra point was good, and Tech expanded its lead to 2810 with 5:06 remaining in the game.|$|E
5|$|After Virginia Tech's post-score kickoff {{and a short}} return, Tennessee's offense {{started from}} its 31-yard line. A five-yard penalty against Virginia Tech was {{followed}} by a five-yard first-down run by Hardesty. Tennessee attempted to move its offense quickly in order to maximize the chances of closing Virginia Tech's lead by scoring fast. Crompton completed an 18-yard pass, advancing the Volunteers into Tech territory, but he was sacked by the Tech defense and Tennessee committed a five-yard false start penalty, forcing the Volunteers to punt. The kick rolled <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>zone</b> for a touchback, and Tech's offense returned to the field at its 20-yard line.|$|E
5|$|The quickest {{score in}} NFL history {{occurred}} on September 8, 2013, in the Steelers season opener against the Tennessee Titans, when the Steelers scored a safety {{on the opening}} kickoff three seconds <b>into</b> <b>the</b> game. Darius Reynaud of the Titans fielded the kickoff and took a short step backwards (<b>into</b> <b>the</b> south <b>end</b> <b>zone)</b> for what was ruled to be a safety, not a touchback, because the ball was not in <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>zone</b> when it was fielded. The Steelers, however, lost the game 16-9, which was also their first home opener loss since Heinz Field opened.|$|R
5000|$|On offense, {{points are}} scored by {{advancing}} <b>the</b> ball <b>into</b> <b>the</b> opponent's <b>end</b> <b>zone</b> {{for a touchdown}} (worth six points), or by kicking the ball from the playing field through the raised vertical posts (the goal posts) which are most commonly situated on <b>the</b> <b>end</b> line of <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>zone</b> for a field goal (worth three points). After scoring a touchdown, the offense is given an additional opportunity from the 2-yard line (3-yard line in amateur football) to attempt to score (in the NFL, 15-yard line on 1-point conversions). Conversion attempts are used to score 1 or 2 points as follows: ...|$|R
50|$|The Seahawks {{returned}} to the Kingdome for the eleventh week of the season, where they hosted the New Orleans Saints, who came <b>into</b> <b>the</b> game with a 3-7-0 record. Seattle opened the scoring when Sherman Smith had a one-yard rush <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Saints' <b>end</b> <b>zone,</b> however, <b>the</b> extra point failed, as the Seahawks had a 6-0 lead. New Orleans cut the Seahawks lead in half when kicker Rich Szaro had a 46-yard field goal, making the score 6-3 for Seattle. The Saints took full control {{of the game in}} the second quarter, as Bobby Douglass had two rushing touchdowns, followed by another field goal by Szaro, as the Saints scored 17 unanswered points to take a 20-6 lead. New Orleans kept coming on strong in the third quarter, as Chuck Muncie had a three-yard rushing touchdown to make it 27-6 for the Saints. Seattle cut <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Saints lead when Steve Largent caught an 11-yard pass from quarterback Bill Munson, making the score 27-13 for New Orleans. The Saints responded with three touchdowns before <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of <b>the</b> quarter, two of them on Seahawks turnovers. The Saints Tom Myers returned a 20-yard fumble <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Seattle <b>end</b> <b>zone</b> to make <b>the</b> score 34-13 for New Orleans. Elex Price then had a 23-yard interception return for a touchdown to give the Saints a 41-13 lead, followed by a Tony Galbreath three-yard run <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Seahawks' <b>end</b> <b>zone</b> to give New Orleans a 48-13 lead after three quarters. In the fourth, the Seahawks Sherman Smith rushed for his second touchdown of the game, as the score was 48-20 for New Orleans. The Saints Rich Szaro kicked his third field goal of the game, this time from 21 yards, as New Orleans went ahead 51-20. Seahawks quarterback Jim Zorn had a seven-yard touchdown rush late in the game, making the final score 51-27 for the Saints.|$|R
5|$|After the kickoff, Florida State went three-and-out and punted back to Virginia Tech. The Hokies {{began their}} second {{possession}} of the quarter at their 39-yard line and started the drive with five consecutive running plays, advancing 28 yards in the process. Tech then switched to its passing offense, throwing four consecutive passes. Three were complete, and the final one, a 21-yard toss from Taylor to Wilson, ended with the running back carrying the ball <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>zone.</b> The score capped a nine-play, 61-yard drive that grew the Hokies' advantage to 18 points, 35–17.|$|E
5|$|As in the {{previous}} two drives, Virginia Tech relied upon its rushing offense: The first five plays of the drive were runs by David Wilson, who gained 26 yards. The Hokies then switched gears, surprising Tennessee, whose defense allowed a 30-yard pass completion from Taylor to Boykin. Tech reverted to running plays, but Tennessee again allowed a long gain, as Roberts advanced 21 yards on a run, then Wilson ran three yards <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>zone.</b> The touchdown and extra point gave Virginia Tech a 34-14 lead with 5:14 remaining in the game.|$|E
5|$|Because Clemson {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the game, Georgia Tech {{received the}} ball to begin the second half. Chris Tanner returned the kickoff to the Tech 29-yard line, and the Yellow Jackets began the first offensive drive of the half. Jones opened the drive with a 16-yard run, then the Yellow Jackets converted a fourth down to continue down the field. Six plays after the fourth-down conversion, Tech quarterback Nesbitt ran <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>zone</b> for a touchdown. The following extra point gave Tech a 23–13 lead with 9:12 remaining.|$|E
5000|$|The game is {{a fantasy}} version of American football, played between two teams of up to 16 players, each team fielding up to 11 players at a time. Touchdowns are scored by taking <b>the</b> ball <b>into</b> <b>the</b> opposition's <b>end</b> <b>zone,</b> and a team can win either by scoring the most touchdowns, or by violently {{eliminating}} the other team's entire roster. The game has both real-time and turn-based strategy modes. Players may choose {{to play the game}} in either mode. [...] The Special Play cards are not included in the main game.|$|R
50|$|For their eighth {{game of the}} season, Houston {{traveled}} to meet Marshall. The Thundering Herd scored first with a field goal, and never relinquished the lead. In the third quarter, Houston quarterback Blake Joseph threw a long pass <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Marshall <b>end</b> <b>zone.</b> His intended receiver, Edwards, {{in pursuit of the}} pass, ran {{out of the back of}} <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>zone.</b> Just beyond <b>the</b> boundary, he collided with a motorized cart. Running at full speed, Edwards' right leg impacted the object and he flipped over due to the momentum. He suffered a compound fracture of the leg. The cart was one of several that were parked just outside the field's boundary and held equipment for the Marshall band.|$|R
50|$|The Seahawks were on {{the road}} for their tenth game of the season, as they headed to Metropolitan Stadium in Bloomington, Minnesota to face the Minnesota Vikings. It was a very cold day, as the {{temperature}} at kickoff was 24 degrees, 16 with <b>the</b> windchill. Heading <b>into</b> <b>the</b> game, the Vikings had a 7-1-1 record. Minnesota took a 7-0 lead in the first quarter when Brent McClanahan rushed for a yard <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Seahawks' <b>end</b> <b>zone.</b> Seattle responded and tied the game at 7-7 when quarterback Jim Zorn rushed 12 yards <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Vikings' <b>end</b> <b>zone.</b> Minnesota re-took <b>the</b> lead in the second quarter when Sammy White caught a 29-yard pass for a touchdown from Fran Tarkenton, giving the Vikings a 14-7 into halftime. Seattle tied the game early in the third quarter, when Jim Zorn threw an 80-yard pass to Steve Raible, making the score 14-14. Vikings kicker Fred Cox broke the tie with a 43-yard field goal to give Minnesota a 17-14 lead, and then connected on a 39-yard attempt before <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of <b>the</b> quarter as the Vikings led the game 20-14. Seattle took their first lead of the game in the fourth quarter when Sam McCullum caught a seven-yard pass from Zorn, as the Seahawks took the lead 21-20. The Vikings avoided the upset though, as Stu Voigt caught a five-yard pass from Tarkenton, giving the Vikings the victory by a score of 27-21.|$|R
5|$|Beginning {{at their}} own 20-yard line, the Virginia Tech offense marched down the field. Running back Branden Ore ran 11yards for a first down, and two long passes from Sean Glennon to wide {{receiver}} Eddie Royal put the Hokies into scoring position. After failing to gain first downs with short runs, Virginia Tech was forced to use its timeouts to stop the clock and the first half from ending before {{they had a chance}} to score. On a 3rd-and-7 from the Boston College 13-yard line, Glennon finally connected with wide receiver Josh Hyman, who crossed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>zone</b> for a touchdown. The extra point tied the game, 1616.|$|E
5|$|Connecticut fumbled {{the ball}} for the sixth time on the next possession; this time Donald Brown was {{responsible}} for dropping the ball. Buffalo recovered for the fifth time, {{but was unable to}} score, punting to ball back to UConn with 4:37 left in the half. Brown made up for his earlier mistake by breaking off a 75-yard run before being caught from behind. On the next play Tyler Lorenzen ran the ball <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>zone</b> from 13yards out. Neither team scored {{for the remainder of the}} first half, making the score 20–17 Buffalo going into halftime.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the kickoff}} and return, backup Virginia Tech quarterback Jim Druckenmiller entered {{the game to}} guide the Hokies' offense. The first play of the drive, however, was a run by backup running back Ken Oxendine, who gained five yards. Two more runs by Oxendine failed to gain a first down, however, and Virginia Tech punted. Tennessee's Sean Summers {{returned}} the kick to the Volunteers' 40-yard line, and the Volunteers continued trying to run out the clock. Tennessee failed to gain a first down, and the resulting punt rolled <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>zone</b> for a touchback.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the play, the Packers {{were leading}} the Seahawks 12–7. With eight {{seconds left in}} the fourth quarter, the Seahawks had {{possession}} of the ball at the Packers' 24-yard line with a fourth down-and-10 situation. On the final play of the game, Seattle quarterback Russell Wilson unleashed a Hail Mary pass <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Packers <b>end</b> <b>zone.</b> Several Packers and Seahawks leaped to catch the ball. As the players jumped, Packers safety M. D. Jennings and Seahawks wide receiver Golden Tate both jumped up for the ball, and both maintained some amount of contact with the ball in the air and upon landing on the ground.|$|R
50|$|The first {{score of}} the game came from Houston, when running back Harold Lewis made a 2-yard dive <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Hurricane <b>end</b> <b>zone</b> in <b>the</b> first quarter. Tulsa {{answered}} with their own rushing touchdown in the second quarter. However, the game was decided late in the fourth quarter, when a holding call was made against Tulsa, and {{they were forced to}} give up fifteen yards. This eventually resulted in Houston's senior halfback Gene Ward scoring another touchdown from a pass by quarterback Don Brown. With a win against Tulsa, Houston improved its all-time series record against the Golden Hurricane to a tie at 4-4.|$|R
50|$|If {{the team}} in {{possession}} of the ball, at any time, advances (either by carrying or catching) <b>the</b> ball <b>into</b> <b>the</b> opponent's <b>end</b> <b>zone,</b> it is a touchdown, and the team scores six points and a free play known as a try. In a try, a team attempts to score one or two points (rules vary by each league, but under standard rules, a field goal on a try is worth one point while another touchdown is worth two). At the college and professional levels, the defense can also score on a try, but only on the same scale (thus a botched try the defense returns for a touchdown scores only two points and not six).|$|R
