2500|$|In January 2010, Swans' re-formation was heralded with a {{new song}} posted on the Young God Records' MySpace, and officially {{confirmed}} by a post on the Young God Records Facebook and MySpace accounts. Gira decided to bring back Swans during an Angels of Light show five years prior. In the middle of performing the song The Provider onstage utilizing [...] "large chords that were very sustained and swaying, {{in this sort of}} slave-ship rhythm," [...] he felt [...] "a nascent urge right then to re-form or reinvigorate Swans because <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>how</b> elevating and intense that experience was". To help raise money for the upcoming new Swans album, Gira released a new solo album, I Am Not Insane, via his Young God Records website. LAS Magazine posted an article entitled [...] "Kickstart My Art" [...] on alternative financing in [...] "a cash-strapped music industry, unable to rely on record label financing, [...] is positioning its own quid pro quo: fan dollars to fund projects in exchange for exclusive material and a sense of involvement" [...] that cites Swans selling out of the 1,000 signed and numbered copies of I Am Not Insane as an example of reverse financing where proceeds from one project are rolled over to finance the next.|$|E
6000|$|I was in despair. Then, suddenly, <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>how</b> one fright {{could destroy}} another fright, and I frowned {{up at him}} and shouted sternly: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Pity I hadn't brought mine--I do so {{well with}} it,' I said, and I laughed as <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>how</b> I aimed at Joe and hurt myself.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> {{she looked}} at me, expectantly, yet timidly, almost fearfully. I kissed her.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>how,</b> {{when we had}} drunk, {{she raised}} her goblet--a {{beautiful}} chaste cup of solid gold--and drank, herself, in acknowledgment; and <b>I</b> <b>remember,</b> too, <b>how,</b> chancing to move my head, I caught a most singular, ill-omened smile upon the coarse lips of Messer Ramiro.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no--but <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>how,</b> {{about our}} having, in our benighted innocence, no position, you quite crushed me with your explanation." ...|$|R
60|$|All {{this might}} have been very true, but <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>how</b> I had sat and walked and thought and worried about Rectus, and his {{explanation}} did me no good.|$|E
6000|$|She thought {{like one}} inspired, and <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>how</b> Corvick {{had told me}} long before that her face was interesting. [...] "Perhaps it won't go in a letter if it's 'immense.'" ...|$|E
60|$|And then <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>how</b> {{the artistic}} critics have always praised the grave tints and the grim {{shadows of the}} {{crumbling}} cloisters and abbey towers, and how they themselves often dress up like Gothic ruins in the sombre tones of dim grey walls or dark green ivy. <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>how</b> they hated almost all primary things, but especially primary colours. I knew they were appreciating much more delicately and truly than I the sublime skeleton and the mighty fungoids of the dead Glastonbury. But I stood for an instant alive in the living Glastonbury, gay with gold and coloured like the toy-book of a child.|$|E
60|$|The {{room was}} a {{pleasant}} one, {{at the top of}} the house, overlooking the sea, on which the moon was shining brilliantly. After I had said my prayers, and the candle had burnt out, <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> still sat looking at the moonlight on the water, as if I could hope to read my fortune in it, as in a bright book; or to see my mother with her child, coming from Heaven, along that shining path, to look upon me as she had looked when I last saw her sweet face. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> the solemn feeling with which at length I turned my eyes away, yielded to the sensation of gratitude and rest which the sight of the white-curtained bed--and how much more the lying softly down upon it, nestling in the snow-white sheets!--inspired. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> thought of all the solitary places under the night sky where I had slept, and how I prayed that I never might be houseless any more, and never might forget the houseless. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> seemed to float, then, down the melancholy glory of that track upon the sea, away into the world of dreams.|$|R
50|$|<b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> {{still the}} room became when we {{stumbled}} upon it. It felt like something special then {{and it does}} now too.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>how,</b> {{after our}} third bout of talking, I walked {{back through the}} streets of Utopian London to rejoin the {{botanist}} at our hotel.|$|R
60|$|Captain Dan {{was in his}} element. He saw victory perched {{upon the}} mast of the Leta D. He moved with a {{celerity}} that amazed me, when <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>how</b> exasperatingly slow he could be, fooling with kites. This was Captain Dan's game.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{too late}} to talk like that," [...] I replied, smiling as <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>how</b> eager my partner had been to go as a soldier when I was hanging back. [...] "We're like to see an hundred times worse than this before we're many hours older." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>how</b> I had fainted Christmas morning, and how gladly I had regained {{consciousness}} in the protecting {{presence of the}} little Mother. I knew that the Do√±a Maria would gain strength and courage before the shrine of her implicit faith, and my own heart hungered for a touch of palpable comfort.|$|E
6000|$|... 'And revenge,' added Mrs. Brown-Smith. 'I {{have heard}} of his bragging, the monster. He has talked about me. And <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> he treated Violet Lebas.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Are you married, Jack?' says <b>I,</b> <b>remembering</b> <b>how</b> consumedly in love he {{was with}} his cousin Letty Lovelace, when the Cuttykilts were {{quartered}} at Strathbungo some twenty years ago.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>I</b> will. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> pretty she is," [...] said Dorothea, into whose mind every {{impression}} about Rosamond had cut deep. [...] "I {{hope she}} will like me." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{hollow of}} the arch gave back Learoyd's broken whisper in a bass boom. Mulvaney {{looked at me}} hopelessly, but <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>how</b> the madness of despair had once fallen upon Ortheris, that weary, weary {{afternoon}} in {{the banks of the}} Khemi River, and how it had been exorcised by the skilful magician Mulvaney.|$|E
60|$|They were {{pointing}} {{to the ground as}} though they examined spoor in the sand. I heard the man say something about the dogs not daring to enter the territory of the Mountain, a remark which came back to my mind again after Leo had told me his dream. Then <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>how</b> we were placed.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Why, then, take no note of him, but let him go; and {{presently}} {{call the}} rest of the watch together, and thank God you are rid of a knave.' When <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>how</b> Lady Georgina had hob-nobbed with the Count from Ostend to Malines, I agreed to a great extent both with her and with Dogberry.|$|E
6000|$|... "In great form. I {{forgot to}} ask what you called him; I've named him Hotspur--he'll never be steady at his fences. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> he pulled with you that day." ...|$|R
60|$|The barking of the {{vigilant}} dogs {{had drawn}} me instantly to the door, and <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> positively certain <b>I</b> then felt that Sidney had kissed Mariposilla during her groundward journey.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> you {{afterwards}} {{put it to}} me. Though it {{was nothing}} more," [...] Susie did herself the justice to observe, [...] "than what I too had quite felt." ...|$|R
60|$|Across {{the marsh}} {{was a tiny}} square of orange-coloured light, from the farm-house with the low, {{spreading}} roof. <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>how</b> {{the man and his}} wife and the children worked on till dark, silent and intent, carrying the hay in their arms out of the streaming thunder-rain into the shed, working silent in the soaking rain.|$|E
6000|$|... "Like a bull moose," [...] said Lister with a frown. [...] "I {{ought to}} have kept cool, used caution, and frozen him off by a few short {{arguments}}. You can picture Cartwright's putting across the job! After all, however, I don't know the arguments I could have used, and <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>how</b> the fellow had injured you--" ...|$|E
60|$|My astonishment {{somewhat}} prevented me from replying to this, too. Was {{it possible}} that Mr. Wharton meant to sue the General? I reflected while he paused. <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>how</b> inconspicuous he had named me, and hope died. Mr. Wharton {{did not look at}} me, but stared into the fire, for he was plainly not a man to rail and rant.|$|E
60|$|As we {{surveyed}} this, Lady Tarvrille appeared, back from some party, a slender, white-cloaked, satin-footed figure with amazed blue eyes beneath her golden hair. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> stupidly we {{laughed at her}} surprise.|$|R
60|$|COOK. Ah! <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> {{he used to}} {{fall down}} when he was little--he would go about with {{his head in the}} air. But he always picked himself up like a little man.|$|R
5000|$|... "Say to General Santa Anna {{that when}} <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> ardent an {{advocate}} {{he was of}} liberty ten years ago, I have no sympathy for him now, that he has gotten what he deserves." ...|$|R
6000|$|I wandered {{far that}} night, very far. Some girl accosted me, a thin-faced ruined child younger by {{a year or}} so than myself. <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>how</b> I talked to her, foolish {{rambling}} talk. [...] "If you loved a man, and he was poor, you'd wait," [...] I said, [...] "you'd stick to him. You'd not leave him just to get married to a richer man." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{led me to}} {{our common}} sleeping-place, where, among many snoring men-at- arms in a great bare hall, a pallet was laid for me, and my flesh crept as <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>how</b> this was the couch of him whom I had slain. Howbeit, being well weary, despite the strangeness of the place, after brief orisons I slept sound till a trumpet called us in the morning.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, ay, I thought it; {{and would}} have said it, captain; but <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>how</b> your grand'ther used to love to look upon the face of her he led away for a wife, {{in the days of}} his youth and his happiness. 'Tis natur', 'tis natur', and 'tis wiser to give way a little before its feelings, than to try to stop a current that will have its course." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am heartily glad, for {{you were}} very useful. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> Cantrip almost cried {{when he told me}} you were going to leave him. He had been rather put upon, I fancy, before." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{always loved}} her, Harry. Oh, dear, <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> unhappy {{that made me}} once, and I was so afraid that Hugh would suspect it. She would never have done for you; would she, Harry?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, {{she read}} it to father and me down by the cove," [...] said Sally, [...] "the {{afternoon}} that you {{came home from the}} Banks; <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> we saw you coming in; don't you, Mara?" ...|$|R
