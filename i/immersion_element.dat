40|$|This inquiry {{examines}} observations made by nine former {{participants in}} the 1996 Dalhousie University Summer Language Bursary Program (SLBP) in Halifax, Nova Scotia. The SLBP is a five-week residential total second language immersion characterized by its intensity. In individual interviews, the informants were encouraged to explore whether {{and to what extent}} they had perceived changes in themselves {{as a result of their}} participation in the immersion program. These changes were not related to target-language proficiency. Rather, they focused primarily on aspects of the informants' self-perceived or other-perceived identities, which are conceived of as contextual, multiple, fluid and dynamic. Analysis of these observations indicates that changes to identity may indeed be an important byproduct of intensive second language <b>immersion.</b> <b>Elements</b> of such personal growth include perceived increases in participants' senses of resourcefulness, self-confidence, wanderlust, autonomy, open-mindedness, and sociability. Informants also enumerate the SLBP's unique factors which promote changes in self-perception. Changes in participants' perspectives on identity are not viewed simply as incidental immersion outcomes. Rather, they are viewed as components of 'personal competence', both as factors in and results of successful participation in residential total second language immersion...|$|R

40|$|A {{theory is}} {{presented}} which describes the mechanisms involved in concrete pressures on formwork in wide sections. The main {{value of the}} theory is in providing a framework for analysing site data and indicating areas in which potential economies in design might be made. The horizontal pressure of concrete on formwork comprises two components whose magnitude depends -on {{the proportion of the}} vertical load taken by the particle structure and the pore water pressure. In normal formwork, the pore water pressure provides the major contribution to the maximum horizontal pressure and therefore any factor which increases the rate of load transfer from the pore water pressure onto the particle structure, will decrease the maximum pressure. For example, porous formwork will give lower horizontal pressures than impermeable formwork and the re-analysis of existing site data supports this prediction. Normal internal vibration does not have such a significant' affect on the maximum horizontal pressure as previously reported, but it can fluidify concrete to the depth of poker <b>immersion.</b> The <b>elements</b> of the theory are supported by an experimental programme, re-analysis of existing site data and new site measurements. These site measurements have shown that during underwater concreting a rapidly falling tide can cause the horizontal pressure to exceed the vertical pressure...|$|R

40|$|There is no Western {{equivalent}} {{to the practice of}} calligraphy in pre-modern China, an aesthetic form which does not resolve itself into a literary object or a visual one. Calligraphy was sustained by a rich and complex body of thought that can fully rival art criticism and theory in the West. To undertake this project, I immersed myself in the study of both key works of calligraphy and the aesthetic that sustained it during the Northern Song dynasty (960 - 1127) in China—not in order to practice calligraphy but to transform my own understanding of art and make contemporary Western paintings out of that <b>immersion.</b> Various <b>elements</b> of that aesthetic are studied. Among them are the relation of the Chinese writing system to the natural world; the belief that calligraphy displays the writer’s character; the role of calligraphy in sustaining social relationships; calligraphy’s particular temporality; its political role during the Northern Song; the belief that the different arts of the brush could be transmuted into each other; and its relation to the past. After outlining the Northern Song aesthetic, I examine two canonical works of calligraphy: Su Shi’s scroll, Rain on the Festival of Cold Food, and Huang Tingjian’s Scroll for Zhang Datong. Following this, my own practice is examined in one recent painting, The Declining Year at Hangzhou. This leads into a wider, fragmentary discussion of the influence of the Northern Song aesthetic in relation to contemporary practice. As a result of this immersion, art is understood as a form of conduct rather than as a subjective expression...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel fisheye-lens-based photoacoustic (PA) system. In conventional PA systems, mechanical motors are utilized {{to obtain the}} target information due to the small fields of view of such systems. The use of such motors introduces mechanical noise, which is difficult to remove when processing the echo signals. A fisheye lens system offering a wide field of view would effectively reduce the motor effects (i. e., the noise) and enable the system to have a wide field of view. Therefore, in this work, we propose a novel fisheye lens scheme and describe a PA system based on the developed lens scheme. In addition, to confirm the feasibility of the fisheye-lens-based PA system, we present the typical pulse-echo responses obtained using a 20 MHz single <b>element</b> <b>immersion</b> transducer and the echo signals measured from bull’s eye tissue samples separated by approximately 4, 6, 8, and 10 cm diagonally and 2 cm vertically from the fisheye lens. The experimental results demonstrate that the echo signal amplitudes, their center frequencies, and the − 6 dB bandwidths obtained using red, green, and blue lights and a fisheye lens are acceptable when the fisheye lens is separated from a sample both diagonally and vertically. Therefore, fisheye-lens-based PA systems could be a potential method of achieving wide fields of view while reducing the mechanical motor effects...|$|R

40|$|Electric {{hot water}} tanks play {{a pivotal role}} as demand {{response}} assets within the UK's energy system by storing heat when energy is inexpensive and delivering domestic hot water when it is required. This role will become increasingly important if non-dispatchable renewable energy sources are to play a bigger part in the energy mix. Historically, the design standards relating to hot water tanks have focused primarily on minimising heat losses. However, in addition to preserving energy, a hot water tank should preserve the availability of heat above a useful temperature {{for as long as}} possible to avoid energy usage during peak times when it is costly or carbon intensive. To do this, thermal stratification within hot water tanks must be promoted. Unfortunately, thermal stratification leads to conditions that are conducive to bacterial growth due to the hospitable temperatures that arise during operation. For this reason, question marks have arisen over the extent to which more flexible control strategies, designed to allow for increasing penetrations of intermittent renewable energy sources, might lead to the growth of pathogenic bacteria within hot water tanks. The objective of the work discussed in this thesis was to understand the extent to which there is a conflict between thermal stratification and bacterial growth in practice, whether this conflict can be resolved and the potential implications for electric hot water tanks operating on a time of use tariff. A small field study demonstrated that there is prolific bacterial growth within conventional electric cylinders and that this can be attributed to thermal stratification with a confidence of (P< 0. 01). Fitting a de-stratification pump, to enhance sanitary performance, resulted in a 19 % decrease in the recovery of useable hot water above 43 °C. Given that the tanks tested during the field study were made of copper, the consequences of alternative material choices on thermal performance were explored. It was found that the rate of useable hot water loss, due to de-stratification associated with thermal diffusion across the thermocline, could be reduced by a factor of 2. 7 by making the tank liner wall from stainless steel instead of copper. Further numerical work indicated that this improvement in stratifying performance was most significant for small tanks with high aspect ratios. In addition to de-stratification that arises due to vertical conduction, de-stratification due to inlet mixing was reduced by up to 30 % by installing a spiral diffuser into the base of a test cylinder. In addition, by lowering the <b>immersion</b> heating <b>element</b> to ensure there is sufficient heat transfer to the base of the cylinder, sterilising temperatures could be attained throughout the stored volume of water in the tank during heating. This showed that the conflict between thermal and sanitary performance within electric tanks could potentially be resolved. A bespoke tank, made from stainless steel and fitted with a diffuser, was built and subjected to typical draw cycles that reflect real world operation. These tests showed that more useable hot water could be delivered in comparison to a commercial off the shelf copper tank and consequently the utilisation of the Economy 7 time of use tariff would be enhanced. </p...|$|R
6000|$|All of which, on Mrs. Stringham's part, {{sharpened}} {{his sense}} of <b>immersion</b> in an <b>element</b> rather more strangely than agreeably warm--a sense that was moreover, {{during the next two}} or three hours, to be fed to satiety by several other impressions. Milly came down after dinner, half a dozen friends--objects of interest mainly, it appeared, to the ladies of Lancaster Gate--having by that time arrived; and with this call on her attention, the further call of her musicians ushered by Eugenio, but personally and separately welcomed, and the supreme opportunity offered in the arrival of the great doctor, who came last of all, he felt her diffuse in wide warm waves the spell of a general, a beatific mildness. There was a deeper depth of it, doubtless, for some than for others; what he in particular knew of it was that he seemed to stand in it up to his neck. He moved about in it and it made no plash; he floated, he noiselessly swam in it, and they were all together, for that matter, like fishes in a crystal pool. The effect of the place, the beauty of the scene, had probably much to do with it; the golden grace of the high rooms, chambers of art in themselves, took care, as an influence, of the general manner, and made people bland without making them solemn. They were only people, as Mrs. Stringham had said, staying for the week or two at the inns, people who during the day had fingered their Baedekers, gaped at their frescoes and differed, over fractions of francs, with their gondoliers. But Milly, let loose among them in a wonderful white dress, brought them somehow into relation with something that made them more finely genial; so that if the Veronese picture of which he had talked with Mrs. Stringham was not quite constituted, the comparative prose of the previous hours, the traces of insensibility qualified by [...] "beating down," [...] were at last almost nobly disowned. There was perhaps something for him in the accident of his seeing her for the first time in white, but she hadn't yet had occasion--circulating with a clearness intensified--to strike him as so happily pervasive. She was different, younger, fairer, with the colour of her braided hair more than ever a not altogether lucky challenge to attention; yet he was loth wholly to explain it by her having quitted this once, for some obscure yet doubtless charming reason, her almost monastic, her hitherto inveterate black. Much as the change did for the value of her presence, she had never yet, when all was said, made it for him; and he was not to fail of the further amusement of judging her determined in the matter by Sir Luke Strett's visit. If he could in this connexion have felt jealous of Sir Luke Strett, whose strong face and type, less assimilated by the scene perhaps than any others, he was anon to study from the other side of the saloon, that would doubtless have been most amusing of all. But he couldn't be invidious, even to profit by so high a tide; he felt himself too much [...] "in" [...] it, as he might have said: a moment's reflexion put him more in than any one. The way Milly neglected him for other cares while Kate and Mrs. Lowder, without so much as the attenuation of a joke, introduced him to English ladies--that was itself a proof; for nothing really of so close a communion had up to this time passed between them as the single bright look and the three gay words (all ostensibly of the last lightness) with which her confessed consciousness brushed by him.|$|R
40|$|Immersed tunnel {{elements}} are prefabricated {{in the construction}} yard and then transported to the construction site to {{be integrated into the}} tunnel. During the transportation and immersion, the floating tunnel element is connected via cables to the immersion barges/pontoons. In this study, the hydrodynamical behavior of a floating tunnel element during construction has been modeled. The motional characteristics and stability of a floating tunnel element and twin barges during the installation are investigated. This study aimed to investigate, how the stability of the system can be improved to make it possible to immerse a large number of tunnel elements in relatively short span of time in offshore conditions. The hydrodynamical behavior of the system and the related forces in different construction stages are analyzed. The focus of the study was on the determination of the influence of the pontoon configuration on the systems stability, the related forces, and operability. For this study, Fehmrnbelt Fixed Link tunnel project has been taken as a case study. The calculations are performed for two different pontoon configurations, namely: - Catamaran (conventionally applied pontoon for the <b>immersion</b> of tunnel <b>elements)</b> - Semi-submersible (platform used in offshore industry) In the analysis, first, the main dimensions of the two pontoons are determined. The pontoons form the main piece of the immersion equipment. Subsequently, during the transport, the forces and moments on the floating element are evaluated. Two main type hydraulic external forces have been taken into consideration in the model, namely current and wave force. For different positions along transport route, the forces and moments are calculated for finite water depth and different values of flow velocity. From the analysis, it appears that the wave-induced motions of a floating tunnel element are negligible. The relatively small waves are not able to bring the massive tunnel element into motions. The lowest natural periods of the floating tunnel element appears for roll degree of freedom, and it is about 8 s. The significant current forces and moments occur during the fitting out. The stability of a floating element during transport is primary determined by the towing velocity. During immersion, the systems stability due to waves and current forces is being analyzed. To assess the stability of the system for different current conditions, the vortex shedding periods are calculated. Then the natural frequencies of the system have been evaluated for different pontoon configurations and tunnel element length. It appears that an immersion system with Catamaran pontoons seems to be less sensitive to vortex shedding period in contrast to the Semi-submersible barge. A Semi-submersible barge can only be used in 80 % of current conditions in Fehmarnbelt. A Catamaran pontoon can be applied in 95 % of the occurring current conditions. Also, during the immersion, the wave-induced motions of the tunnel element can be ignored, provided that the wavelengths and wave periods are not too large. On the other hand, the relatively light pontoons are sensitive to wave loadings. The motions of the barges are prevented by the element, which leads to significant force fluctuations in suspension cables. In the analysis, the coupling between surge, sway, heave, roll, pitch and yaw degrees of freedom are considered. The calculations are performed for the first order responses that are valid in relatively low wave heights. Hydrodynamic effects caused by the nonlinearities are disregarded in the calculations. The pontoons were considered as a hybrid structure. That means, concerning the horizontal degrees of freedom the pontoon structure is regarded as it is compliant and it behaves like a floating structure. While concerning the vertical degrees of freedom, it is stiff and resembles as a fixed structure, and it is not allowed to float freely. The contribution of the mooring lines to the first order response is considered of minor importance, and it is disregarded. Numerical studies are conducted to compare the dynamical behavior of the Catamaran pontoon with that of the Semi-submersible. The results of this study reveal that:  - The contribution of the first order wave force to the pontoons motions in soft degrees (surge, sway, and yaw) is limited - The motions in stiff degrees of freedom (heave, pitch, and roll) are normative for the immersion operation. When the tunnel element is immersed in wave conditions T> 5 s and H > 1 m, then there is a significant danger that one of the suspension cables will break when applying a Catamaran pontoon. If a Semi-submersible barge is used, then the tunnel element can be immersed in wave conditions T < 6. 5 s and H < 1. 8 m. - Semi-submersible pontoon has larger natural frequencies than Catamaran pontoon. The natural periods of the Semi-submersible barge are approximately a factor 1. 4 larger than the natural periods of the Catamaran pontoon. - A Semi-submersible pontoon is more sensitive to the force fluctuation in the suspension cables than the Catamaran pontoon concerning the static stability and floating capacity. Especially the floating capacity became problematic if the force fluctuations become large and therefore the pontoon can be pulled under water. - The heave motions mainly affect the force fluctuations in suspension cables, and they can be considered as normative. - Both barges are sensitive to the increasing wave height and period. However, the effect on Catamaran pontoon is larger. In total, a Semi-submersible barge has favorable operability in the waves and current conditions in Fehmarnbelt. Therefore, if the workability is the primary objective, then it is better to apply a Semi-submersible pontoon. Then in 77 % of environmental conditions, the tunnel elements can be immersed.
