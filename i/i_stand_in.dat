500|$|After Charles's death, Lucinda Dalton {{applied to}} cancel her temple sealing to Charles in 1884: [...] "though I {{know he had}} many imperfections... now the brethren say he is unworthy, (though I know not who {{appointed}} them to judge him,) they urge that <b>I</b> <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> a very insecure position, and that for my children's sake, {{as well as my}} own, I ought to marry again." [...] Dalton feared that by remaining sealed to Charles, she would forfeit her claim to her children. Perhaps because Charles was a drinker, her [...] "brethren" [...] considered him unworthy of his sealing. Her sealing cancellation was approved in 1887 and then revoked after her death in 1931.|$|E
500|$|In [...] "Masterpiece", Madonna sings {{about the}} pain of being {{in love with someone}} who is a great work of art, with the lyrics {{including}} [...] "If you were the Mona Lisa, You'd be hanging in the Louvre, Everyone would come to see you, You'd be impossible to move." [...] Madonna said the song describes Wallis Simpson and is [...] "about a woman who has fallen in love with this untouchable thing, this man that was raised to be king. One of the lines of the song 'it must be so hard to always be the chosen one.' At {{the end of the day}} nothing is indestructible, no matter how high you might rise in the world you are still a human being." [...] Marc Schneider from Billboard described [...] "Masterpiece" [...] as a slowed-down, moody ballad that showcases strong execution of vocals from Madonna. He described the production as [...] "simple, direct and reminiscent of her sound in the 1990s". The lyrics were described as emotional, and was comparable to the film's love story, with the chorus as follows: [...] "And I'm right by your side, Like a thief in the night, <b>I</b> <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> front of a masterpiece. And I can't tell you why it hurts so much to be in love with a masterpiece. 'Cause after all, nothing's indestructible".|$|E
2500|$|The {{second half}} of the album breaks from the pop/rock theme and {{switches}} into a more generic, idol, sound with songs such as: [...] "Water Drop", [...] "Freedom Rion", and [...] "Kagayakeru Butai e". Singles, [...] "Yellow Pansy Street", [...] "Tsubusa ni Koi", [...] "My Home" [...] serve as breaks in-between the album originals before the album closes with the ballad, [...] "wander", a lyrically heavy song that is filled emotional encouragement. [...] " [...] Give me the reason, I want to hold on to it/As <b>I</b> <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> a field I trust/I breath out as I continue on this path/Holding my head up proudly/As beautiful flowers bloom from my footprints/Where to wonder? I want to send true love [...] ", they sing in the final chorus.|$|E
