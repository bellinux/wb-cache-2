5|$|Development of Thracia 776 started {{around the}} {{beginning}} of 1998, with the initial plan being for a compact side project to <b>Genealogy</b> of the Holy War. Development was also supposed to end a considerable time prior to its eventual release date, but as the game evolved, the staff {{felt the need to}} keep going and create a full Fire Emblem title. This in turn caused difficulties with keeping the game within the world of <b>Genealogy</b> of the Holy War, with Kaga commenting {{that it would have been}} simpler to create a completely original title if they had known how big the project would become. Characters were intentionally given little buildup or backstory, leaving their individual personalities for players to imagine. As the strategic war simulation elements of <b>Genealogy</b> of the Holy War had suffered due to the goal of creating an intricate story, Kaga this time switched his focus to the gameplay. The basic structure was taken from , with additional elements such as branching pathways within maps and variations in unit movement. This was achieved by giving each map a different algorithm to work with. The fatigue system was introduced to challenge players further.|$|E
50|$|The Harleian <b>genealogies</b> are a {{collection}} of Old Welsh <b>genealogies</b> preserved in British Library, Harleian MS 3859. Part of the Harleian Library, the manuscript, which also contains the Annales Cambriae (Recension A) and {{a version of the}} Historia Brittonum, has been dated to c. 1100, although a date of c.1200 is also possible. Since the <b>genealogies</b> begin with the paternal and maternal pedigrees of Owain ap Hywel Dda (d. 988), the material was probably compiled during his reign. The collection also traces the lineages of less prominent rulers of Wales and the Hen Ogledd. Some of the <b>genealogies</b> reappear in the <b>genealogies</b> from Jesus College MS 20.|$|R

5|$|In {{a feature}} {{on the five}} best Fire Emblem titles up until 2013, Chris Carter of Destructoid {{included}} <b>Genealogy</b> of the Holy War among them due to the many lasting features it introduced to the series.

In a different feature for RPGamer, writer Cassandra Ramos called the game the entry she most wished to see released overseas due to its scale and quality when compared to other entries from the period. Both noted that <b>Genealogy</b> of the Holy War was a suitable subject for a remake {{in the wake of the}} international success of more recent titles in the series.|$|E

The manuscript was compiled in the late 14th century, but many <b>genealogies</b> are thought to be considerably older. The latest pedigrees to have been included in the tract are those of Llywelyn ab Iorwerth (d. 1240) and Rhys Gryg (d. 1234). It shares some material with the earlier Harleian <b>genealogies.</b>|$|R

5|$|A {{key element}} in combat since <b>Genealogy</b> of the Holy War is the Weapon Triangle, a system {{governing}} {{the strengths and weaknesses}} certain weapons and types of magic have against each other in a Scissors, Paper, Rock fashion. For weapons, lances are stronger than swords, swords are stronger than axes, and axes are stronger than lances. In magic, fire is stronger than wind, wind is stronger than thunder, and thunder is stronger than fire. For Fates, the Weapon Triangle relationships add other weapons in the following way: swords and tomes are stronger than axes and bows, axes and bows were stronger than lances and shuriken, lances and shuriken are stronger than swords and tomes, and so on. Several games use a Weapon Durability system: after being used a certain number of times, a character's weapon will break. Different entries have various systems related to character weapons: in <b>Genealogy</b> of the Holy War, weapons can be repaired at special shops; in Path of Radiance and future games, weapons can be bought and upgraded, while the durability system is replaced in Fates with a system where more powerful weapons weaken some of a wielder's stats.|$|E
