25|$|The {{power sector}} in Brazil was {{essentially}} in government's hands {{until the early}} 1990s. The sector had seen remarkable development in the 1970s. However, by the late 1980s, the state-ownership model {{was on the verge}} of collapse. This delicate situation was the result of heavily subsidized tariffs and a revenue shortfall in the sector of about US$35 billion, which led to the delay in the construction of about 15 large hydro plants due to lack of funds for investment. Efforts to address the deterioration of the sector were not successful, a situation that further intensified the need for deep reforms. A major commitment was made by President Cardoso to carry out a substantial reform of the Brazilian electricity sector. The first reforms introduced in the power sector were aimed to allow the participation of private capital and also to <b>improve</b> <b>its</b> <b>economic</b> situation.|$|E
25|$|Arguably {{the most}} {{noteworthy}} chapter in Ball's business career was his {{battle against the}} railroad unions in the Florida East Coast Railway strike of 1963 to 1977. In {{order to try to}} save the railroad from its three decades-long state of bankruptcy, which if allowed to continue would have threatened the railroad with physical deterioration and even partial abandonment, Ball fought for the company's right to engage in its own contract negotiations with the railroad unions rather than accept an industrywide settlement that Ball thought would include featherbedding and wasteful work rules. His use of replacement workers to keep the railroad running during the strike led to violence by strikers that included shootings and bombings. Eventually, Federal intervention helped quell the violence, and the railroad's right to operate during the strike with replacement workers was affirmed by the United States Supreme Court. As the strike continued, the Florida East Coast took numerous steps to improve its physical plant, install various forms of automation, and drastically cut labor costs, all to an extent that most other railroads would not succeed in matching until years later. Ball therefore was a pioneer in the American railroad industry's struggle, beginning in the 1960s, to <b>improve</b> <b>its</b> <b>economic</b> efficiency.|$|E

Vazgen Sargsyan, who quickly denounced the proposal, became the de facto leader of the opposing group within the government. He was joined by the two Karabakh Armenians in the government: Prime Minister Kocharyan and Interior and National Security Minister Serzh Sargsyan. These three politicians were referred to as [...] "hardliners" [...] in the Western media for their perceived nationalistic stance. They argued that [...] "Armenia should try to <b>improve</b> <b>its</b> <b>economic</b> performance," [...] while Ter-Petrosyan insisted that Armenia [...] "could only achieve marginal improvements insufficient to address the fear of relative decline and economic exclusion." [...] The Kocharyan cabinet, where Vazgen Sargsyan was a leading figure, called for a [...] "package" [...] deal, [...] "involving a single framework accord on all contentious issues." [...] On 21 October 1997, ten members of the Republic bloc in the parliament left the faction and shifted their support to Vazgen Sargsyan. Ter-Petrosyan's bloc in the parliament was left with a majority of two seats. Despite the great public and political opposition, the Pan-Armenian National Movement voted in favor of Ter-Petrosyan's foreign policy.|$|E
