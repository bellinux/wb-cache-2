40|$|The {{reaction}} of hydroxyl radicals with toluene {{in a large}} excess of O 2 or N 2 has been studied in a Fast Flow Reactor at a pressure of 15 Torr. OH radicals have been detected by resonance fluorescence, formation of products has been observed by Laser Induced Fluorescence. LIF signals increased strongly when N 2 was replaced by O 2, indicating a reaction between the OH adduct and oxygen. LIF signals have been, after various tests, assigned {{to the formation of}} cresols. The yield of cresol formation relative to the initial OH-concentration {{has been found to be}} (0. 2 ± 0. 1), in good agreement with recent smog chamber studies. 2. Aims of the research Though having been the subject of many investigations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> recent <b>period</b> (<b>f.</b> e. Klotz et. al. 1998, Moschonas et. al. 1999, Smith et. al. 1998, Bohn et. al. 1999), the mechanism of tropospheric oxidation of aromatic hydrocarbons, initiated by OH radicals, is still controversial. Taking the example of toluene, the initial reaction channel is essentially the formation of an adduct by addition of OH radicals to the ring; the other channel, formation of the benzyl radicals by H-atom abstraction, represents only 10 % of the total rate. The subsequent fate of the OH-adduct is mainly a reaction with O 2 : adduct + O 2 ↔ adduct-O 2 → cresol (mainly ortho) + HO 2 → ring opening products The branching ratio between these three channels is still disputed. We have therefore performed a kinetic investigation of the reactive system OH/toluene/O 2 by the discharge flow technique at a total pressure of 15 Torr...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Postthyroidectomy voice {{changes are}} common even without {{apparent}} laryngeal nerve injury. Our study evaluated {{the impact of}} open cervical thyroidectomy on five acoustic voice parameters <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early (< 3 months) and late (≥ 3 months) postoperative periods. METHODS: A systematic review was performed to identify studies that quantitatively assessed voice quality by acoustic voice analysis before and after thyroidectomy. Parameters included average fundamental frequency (F 0, Hz), jitter (%), shimmer (%), noise-to-harmonic ratio (NHR), and maximum phonation time (MPT) (in secs). Meta-analysis was performed using both fixed- and random-effects models. RESULTS: A total of 896 patients were analyzed. Relative to baseline, F 0 significantly worsened <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early <b>period</b> (from 194. 9 [*]±[*] 34. 9 Hz to 188. 0 [*]±[*] 34. 0 Hz, P[*]=[*] 0. 001). This was equivalent to a quarter-tone loss (P[*]=[*] 0. 004). Shimmer (from 3. 15 [*]±[*] 1. 59 % to 3. 19 [*]±[*] 1. 70 %, P[*]=[*] 0. 040) and MPT (from 17. 9 secs to 16. 7 secs, P[*]=[*] 0. 046) also worsened <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early <b>period,</b> whereas jitter and NHR remained unchanged <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early and late periods. Males suffered greater deterioration in F 0 (from 120. 6 [*]±[*] 18. 8 Hz to 111. 0 [*]±[*] 18. 5 Hz, P[*]=[*] 0. 048) and in NHR (from 0. 12 [*]±[*] 0. 02 to 0. 16 [*]±[*] 0. 03, P[*]=[*] 0. 019) than females <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early <b>period.</b> Four of <b>the</b> five acoustic parameters (F 0, jitter, shimmer, and NHR) significantly worsened after total thyroidectomy (TT) and not after lesser resection.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} a causal {{analysis}} {{is made of}} {{a comparison of the}} structure of society in De Ronde Venen and on the old land along the southern course of the river Vecht over <b>the</b> <b>period</b> 953 - 1528. The structure of society is identified by looking at the distribution among <b>the</b> different groups <b>in</b> society of <b>the</b> property of land and of the instruments with which income from surplus from land could be collected. These two regions shared many similarities <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>period</b> of research, <b>f.</b> e.; they are situated merely 15 kilometres from each other, <b>in</b> both regions <b>the</b> bishop of Utrecht was the main landlord and in both regions chapters and ministeriales played an important role. However, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> course of the 600 years studied, structurally different relationships between <b>the</b> groups <b>in</b> society developed in De Ronde Venen and along the river Vecht. The main difference the thesis comes across is that in De Ronde Venen peasants were landholders, enjoyed personal freedom and influence on local administration, while the relationships on the old land along the southern course of the river Vecht throughout <b>the</b> <b>period</b> continued to be characterized by lords owning land and instruments to control surplus-extraction while peasants (until the thirteenth century as mancipia and subsequently as tenants) had no access to this kind of ownership.

40|$|Many {{people in}} our modern civilized society sleep later on free days {{compared}} to work days. This discrepancy in sleep timing will lead to so-called 'social jetlag' on work days with negative consequences for performance and health. Light therapy <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning is often proposed as the most effective method to advance the circadian rhythm and sleep phase. However, most studies focus on direct effects on the circadian system and not on posttreatment effects on sleep phase and sleep integrity. In this placebo-controlled home study we investigated if blue light, rather than amber light therapy, can phase shift the sleep phase along with the circadian rhythm with preservation of sleep integrity and performance. We selected 42 participants who suffered from 'social jetlag' on workdays. Participants {{were randomly assigned to}} either high-intensity blue light exposure or amber light exposure (placebo) with similar photopic illuminance. The protocol consisted of 14 baseline days without sleep restrictions, 9 treatment days with either 30 -min blue light pulses or 30 -min amber light pulses <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning along with a sleep advancing scheme and 7 posttreatment days without sleep restrictions. Melatonin samples were taken at days 1, 7, 14 (baseline), day 23 (effect treatment), and day 30 (posttreatment). Light exposure was recorded continuously. Sleep was monitored through actigraphy. Performance was measured with a reaction time task. As expected, the phase advance of the melatonin rhythm from day 14 to day 23 was significantly larger <b>in</b> <b>the</b> blue light exposure group, compared to the amber light group (84 min ± 51 (SD) and 48 min ± 47 (SD) respectively; t 36 [*]=[*] 2. 23, p[*]<[*] 0. 05). Wake-up time during the posttreatment days was slightly earlier compared to baseline <b>in</b> <b>the</b> blue light group compared to slightly later <b>in</b> <b>the</b> amber light group (- 21 min ± 33 (SD) and + 12 min ± 33 (SD) respectively; F 1, 35 [*]=[*] 9. 20, p[*]<[*] 0. 01). The number of sleep bouts was significantly higher <b>in</b> <b>the</b> amber light group compared to the blue light group during sleep <b>in</b> <b>the</b> treatment <b>period</b> (<b>F</b> 1, 32 [*]=[*] 4. 40, p[*]<[*] 0. 05). Performance was significantly worse compared to baseline at all times during (F 1, 13 [*]=[*] 10. 1, p[*]<[*] 0. 01) and after amber light treatment (F 1, 13 [*]=[*] 17. 1, p[*]<[*] 0. 01), while only <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning during posttreatment <b>in</b> <b>the</b> blue light condition (F 1, 10 [*]=[*] 9. 8, p[*]<[*] 0. 05). The data support the conclusion that blue light was able to compensate for the sleep integrity reduction and to a large extent for the performance decrement that was observed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> amber light condition, both probably {{as a consequence of the}} advancing sleep schedule. This study shows that blue light therapy <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning, applied <b>in</b> a home setting, supports a sleep advancing protocol by phase advancing the circadian rhythm as well as sleep timing...|$|R

The main conclusions drawn from data analysis are: (a) the catchable stock is mostly made up of juvenile individuals; (b) females are larger than males in l ength and weight at the expense of a bigger tail size; (c) <b>the</b> sex-ratio is, <b>in</b> general, ignificantly favorable to females, but the reverse is true in some months; (d) spawning of penaeid species takes place <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>period</b> February-July; (e) <b>the</b> re cruitment of penaeid species is concentrated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>period</b> September-February; (<b>f)</b> <b>the</b> interspecific relationship, <b>in</b> numbers, was as follows: P. brasiliensis (28. 1 %), P. subtilis (26. 5 %), T. constrictus (22. 2 %), X. kroyeri (12. 5 %) and P. schmitti (10. 7 %); (g) the total annual yield was 28, 881 kg, obtained by a fishing effort of 19, 221 hours, and a CPUE of 1. 40 kg/hour; (h) the annual potential production reache d a value of 5, 638 kg; (i) <b>the</b> peak harvest <b>period</b> occurs <b>in</b> April-August; (j) <b>the</b> working hypothesis was not confirmed, that is, both recruiting juveniles and re productive females are found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> coastal zone; (k) the by-catch/shrimp ratio was estimated at 3. 28 : 1, broken down to 0. 93 : 1 (28. 6 %) for the usable species and 2. 34 : 1 (71. 4 %) for the xvii discarded ones; (l) the by-catch was comprised of 9 8 fish species, out of which fourteen accounted for 90. 4 % of total numbers; (m) the by-catch ecological diversity was determined: specific diversity, Hâ = 2. 610; equitability, E = 0. 568; species richness, D = 8. 353; (n) there was found to exist a decreasing trend, with a geometrical dependence, between species numbers a nd their numerical abundance; (o) fishing management should be enforce d through the following measures: a closed season in March-April...|$|R

Up to 1949 l i terature on this subject was formed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> major i ty of cases by contributions dealing mainly with {{the elements of the}} skeleton which were more accessible. A more detailed discussion is given of studies carried out <b>in</b> <b>the</b> European Bison Research Centre attached to the Department of Animal Anatomy, Warsaw Agricultural University. Studies made during <b>the</b> <b>period</b> <b>f</b> rom 1960 — 1966 are presented, including those not hi therto published dealing with the blood-vascular system, the inte-gumentary system and the spinal nerves. Studies on the alimentary tract and the urogenital system are nearing completion. The results of these studies will be used for a monographic elaboration of the anatomy of the European bison.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{evaluate}} the applicability of surface electromyography (EMG) for evaluation of training related changes in muscle contractile properties. Eight nationally ranked junior tennis players participated in a six weeks training program designed to increase speed and explosiveness. Their physical characteristics were evaluated before and after <b>the</b> training <b>period</b> by: tennis-specific field tests, measuring isometric twitch contraction of the medial gastrocnemius muscle, and by monitoring the frequency spectrum of the EMG at 50 % of the maximal voluntary contraction. All the players improved the results of tennis specific field tests after <b>the</b> training <b>period,</b> but only three players were recognized to increase contractile speed of the medial gastrocnemius muscle expressed by shorter twitch contraction times after <b>the</b> training <b>period.</b> <b>The</b> same three players exhibited higher characteristic frequency (defined as the mean frequency lying between the sixth and ninth decile of the spectral distribution function) and a wider EMG amplitude spectrum after <b>the</b> training <b>period.</b> A good correlation was found between the number of the parameters of the isometric twitch contraction that were improved by more than 2 % after <b>the</b> training <b>period</b> (N P) and the ratio between characteristic frequency after <b>the</b> training <b>period</b> (<b>f</b> A) and characteristic frequency before <b>the</b> training <b>period</b> (<b>f</b> B) (f A /f B) (p = 0. 0065), as well as between N P and the slope of the linear approximation of the dependence between decile frequencies of the EMG signal after <b>the</b> training <b>period</b> (dAf) and decile frequencies of the EMG signal before <b>the</b> training <b>period</b> (dBf) (dAf = f(dBf)) (p = 0. 0035).
