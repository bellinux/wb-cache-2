50|$|One {{noteworthy}} {{event in}} which the failure {{was a result of}} LCF was the 1994 Northridge earthquake. Many buildings and bridges collapsed, and as a result over 9,000 people were injured. Researchers at the University of Southern California analyzed the main areas of a ten-story building that were subjected to low-cycle fatigue. Unfortunately, there was limited experimental data available to directly construct a S-N curve for low-cycle fatigue, so most of the analysis consisted of plotting the high-cycle fatigue behavior on a S-N curve and extending the line for that graph to create the portion of the low-cycle <b>fatigue</b> <b>curve</b> using the Palmgren-Miner method. Ultimately, this data was used to more accurately predict and analyze similar types of damage that the ten-story steel building in Northridge faced.|$|E

Argonne National Laboratory has developed interim <b>fatigue</b> <b>curves</b> based on test data simulating LWR conditions, and published them in NUREG/CR- 5999.

In addition, there are older vintage plants where components of the reactor coolant pressure boundary were designed to codes that did not require an explicit fatigue analysis of the components. In order to assess the fatigue resistance of the older vintage plants, an evaluation was also conducted on selected components of three of these plants.

40|$|Abstract The {{design of}} welded {{aluminium}} structures subjected to fatigue loading is usually {{carried out on}} the basis of reference <b>fatigue</b> <b>curves</b> published in design codes. The reference curves are usually relevant to dynamic loading in ambient air and make provision for the presence of a corrosive environment by downgrading the detail category for a particular joint type.

Comparison between experimentally determined <b>fatigue</b> <b>curves</b> and reference <b>fatigue</b> design <b>curves</b> published in Eurocode 9 confirms that 5083 -H 111 welds display significantly lower reference fatigue strengths than unwelded base material.

40|$|Fibre {{composites}} {{existence in}} civil infrastructure and transportation is relatively new. Originally developed for aerospace, defence force and marine industries, composite materials {{did not make}} an appearance into large civil structures until the first legal road bridge was constructed in 2002. They have many advantages over conventional materials such as improved durability and high strength to weight ratio {{just to name a}} few. The behaviour of pultruded fibre composites has been studied to help the design engineer to better understand the long term performance of composite structures. This research project seeks to investigate the fatigue behaviour of pultruded fibre composites to help develop the <b>fatigue</b> <b>curve</b> or better known as the fatigue life of a material. Firstly a literature review was undertaken to help better understand the theory behind fibre composites and secondly a series of small scale (coupons) and large scale (Composite bridge girder) testing was done to prove these theories. This project also aimed to determine whether small scale testing can predict the fatigue life of large scale composite structures. Fatigue testing is a lengthy process with many researchers spending years just to develop one <b>fatigue</b> <b>curve.</b> Testing a particular sample to one million cycles at one hertz for example takes roughly 12 days to complete, and this does not including setup time. It may seem like the results obtained throughout this research project are quite small, however that one <b>fatigue</b> <b>curve</b> that is obtained is extremely important for the long term performance of pultruded fibre composites. By applying a prediction model to the small scale experimental data, the <b>fatigue</b> <b>curve</b> was developed. Initial results were not quite what were expected, however they did provide an insight into the fatigue performance of coupon testing as this was something that had never been done before on these products. There are minor flaws in the coupon testing, however these did not become apparent until final tests were completed. Further research into the use of coupons for fatigue testing purposes would be recommended.

The pipes were fatigued by alternately pumping hot and cold low oxygen water every four minutes through 304 stainless teel pipes. The rapid change in water temperature imparted a thermal shock to the inner wall of the pipe. The pipes were stepped to f ur different thicknesses to give four different values of thermal shock stress depending on thickness. The pipes were pressurized to 17. 2 MPa (2500 psi) and the temperature cycled between 38 °C (100 °F) and 343 °C (650 °F) in three seconds. This was followed by holding at 343 °C for 237 seconds and then quenching to 38 °C in three seconds followed by another 237 second hold period. Thermal cycling continued until significant cracking was detected on the inside surface of the pipes. Measurements of fatigue striation spacing on the fracture surfaces allowed determination f cycles to the initiation of defects 0. 254 mm (0. 01 inch) deep. Alternating stresses and strains were calculated using both elastic and elastic-plastic finite element analyses (FEA).

The characteristic length, relating to the fatigue behaviour of the material, was considered constant for the fatigue lifetime. In order to confirm the proposed method, new experimental data were obtained, relating to axisymmetric notched specimens loaded with nominal stress ratio R = - 1 and R = 0.

These specimens were subjected to alternating hot and cold forced flow, low oxygenated water every three minutes so that rapid changes in water temperature impart a thermal shock event to the inner wall of the girth butt welds. Thermal and structural piping analyses were conducted using the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code Section III NB- 3600 piping analysis methods and a series of current and proposed design <b>fatigue</b> <b>curves</b> for 304 stainless steel that include water environment effects.

EBM is a methodology able to process metallic powders layer-by-layer. Pedicle screw-produced by the EBM process by the MT Ortho (VS), and commercial screws (VC and VT) were examined. VS screws showed lower resistance to pull-out tests than VC and VT screws. This behavior can be attributed to a lower sharpness and a lower depth of thread. These features, which may be negative from the point of view of the resistance to pull-out tests, could have positive effects from the point of view of stress concentration on bone. To analyze these effects, fatigue pull-out tests were also carried out and the different screw-bone interface behavior was evaluated using photoelasticity and finite element analysis. The results obtained by numerical simulation confirm what was previously stated, a thread with a geometry less sharpened ensures a better distribution of the loads and reduces the notch effect, allowing a balance of the disadvantage due to the lower primary stabilization.
