500|$|... "A Streetcar Named Marge" [...] posed a {{challenge}} to the show's animation directors. The episode contains many long set pieces, especially during the third and final act, which includes the end of the Maggie subplot and the performance of the musical. Several scenes required the animators to draw dozens of background characters. Rich Moore, the head director, initially feared the episode would not be completed in time. David Silverman, the supervising director, also had doubts; according to Martin, Moore sent back a cartoon of himself reading the script with his eyes popping out and his <b>jaw</b> <b>dropped.</b> Producer Al Jean said that Moore [...] "worked himself to death" [...] to produce the episode's most elaborate sequences.|$|E
500|$|Morgan Jeffery of Digital Spy {{called the}} episode [...] "a fantastic launch {{for the sixth}} series," [...] adding [...] "the Doctor Who team's US {{location}} shooting has certainly paid off, lending these early scenes a grand scale that the series could scarcely have expected to achieve in 2005, let alone in 1963." [...] Commenting on the future-Doctor's death, Jeffery said [...] "seven minutes in, a nation's collective <b>jaw</b> <b>dropped</b> as The Doctor— this show's lead— is mercilessly gunned down. This plot twist is simply stunning, and it's difficult to imagine even casual viewers not sitting up to pay attention at this point." [...] Jeffery also believed that the series regulars were on [...] "top form," [...] adding [...] "the more abrasive aspects of Amy Pond's personality {{seem to have been}} toned down this year, and Karen Gillan responds with her best, most sympathetic performance to date. Arthur Darvill also lives up to his recent promotion to full-time companion. His comic timing is simply superb, but he excels too in the episode's darker moments." [...] Jeffery rated the episode five stars out of five.|$|E
