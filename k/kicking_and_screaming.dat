5|$|Mulder {{telephones}} Scully {{and tries}} to explain that he's the real Mulder. Scully does not believe him and asks Fletcher—in Mulder's body—to pick up {{and listen to the}} conversation. Fletcher decides they should immediately report this incident, which further confuses Scully. She goes to Mulder’s apartment (where Fletcher is having a tryst with Kersh's assistant) and tells Fletcher that they traced the telephone call to a pay phone near Area 51 and she suspects it is Mulder's informant. Fletcher is indifferent to this news and Scully yells at him, sensing that his behavior is very strange and his lack of concern for the X-Files is completely out of character. Scully decides to investigate, and drives through the desert towards Area 51. She stops at a burned out gas station and finds a penny and a dime merged. Later, when Scully arrives at Fletcher's house, Mulder tries desperately to convince Scully that he is really Mulder. Scully remains skeptical and thinks that any information Mulder describes could be obtained in other ways. Mulder tells Scully that he will bring proof of the defect of the UFO and the resultant problems that night, but Fletcher, having eavesdropped on the conversation, calls his old office posing as Mulder to inform them of the source of the leak—Mulder posing as Fletcher. Military police arrive at the appointed hour, and Mulder is dragged away, <b>kicking</b> <b>and</b> <b>screaming,</b> desperately trying to convince Scully. Mulder asks if he would turn in an informant to the authorities in this manner as he is carried away, and Scully begins to realize that Mulder may be telling the truth.|$|E

[...] "In Which we Meet Mr. Jones" [...] is what Fringe promised it would be from the beginning, a suspense driven procedural that probes deep into our technological phobias. With this new formulation of Fringe, we get the challenge of a sophisticated crime drama mixed with sad sack characters that tempt the everyman into the game, while blowing us away with a level of wordplay and pseudo science that CSI or Alias could only have dreamed of." [...] The A.V. Club's Noel Murray enjoyed the episode, giving it a B+, while Television Without Pity gave the episode a B-.|$|E

Mulroney {{makes the case}} that his once-radical policies {{on the economy and}} free trade were not reversed by subsequent governments, and regards this as vindication. His Deputy Prime Minister Don Mazankowski said that his greatest accomplishment will be seen as, [...] "Dragging Canada <b>kicking</b> <b>and</b> <b>screaming</b> into the 21st century."

Their numbers have dwindled to 63 due to {{conflict}} with the community called Ice Nation and they accept Kane's offer to come to Arkadia, where the other Sky People live. Part of the group continue to search for Clarke, who has been on the run for three months due to now being a legend and subsequent target because of her defeat of the Mountain Men after Lexa's betrayal. This has earned her the nickname [...] "Wanheda" [...] (commander of death). Indra, one of Lexa's best and most trusted warriors, warns Lexa that the Ice Nation is marching on her; Indra is there when bounty hunter Roan (the banished Ice Nation prince) brings Clarke to Lexa, who sought to capture Clarke before members of Ice Nation did. Still angry at Lexa for her betrayal, Clarke is dragged out <b>kicking</b> <b>and</b> <b>screaming</b> while vowing revenge on Lexa.|$|E

The studio has brought Halos mechanics <b>kicking</b> <b>and</b> <b>screaming</b> into the modern era, while providing the most bombastic, co-op-driven campaign in Halo history." [...] GameSpots Mike Mahardy agreed that 343 had produced some of the best iterations of the game series' facets with Halo 5. IGN's Brian Albert opined that 343 Industries had created an even bigger game than previous entries, with [...] "the strongest combat Halo has ever seen". Destructoids Chris Carter felt that Halo 5 failed to grab him {{in the same way as}} previous games had, [...] "but those of you who are still content with Master Chief and his wacky adventures across the galaxy will likely walk away satisfied." [...] More critically, the reviewers of GamesTM felt that Halo 5 was [...] "sheepish and safe" [...] and represented a series low.|$|E

She smiled, {{accomplished}} that feat steadily, and Norman continuing the operation, Aubrey guided Gertrude in handing round the slices. George did full justice thereto, {{as well as to}} the more solid viands. Flora could taste nothing, but she contrived to smile and say it was too early. She was in haste to have it over now, and, as soon as George had finished, she rose up, still composed and resolved, the last kisses were given--Gertrude was lifted up to her, after she was in the carriage for the very last, when George proposed to run away with her also, whereupon Daisy <b>kicked</b> <b>and</b> <b>screamed,</b> <b>and</b> was taken back in haste. The door was shut, and they drove off, bound for the Continent, and then Mary, as if the contingency of losing Flora had only for the first time occurred to her as the consequence of the wedding, broke out into a piteous fit of sobbing--rather too unrestrained, considering her fourteen years.|$|R
40|$|Moving on from {{euthanasia}} It {{is time to}} move on {{from the}} euthana-sia debate. 1 Let’s also move on from “physician-assisted suicide. ” Rationally, if a society legalizes the killing of sick people, it should use the group that is most efficient, legal, trained and, at times, paid to kill: the Armed Forces. Want to die? Fill out a chit, and the sniper takes you out from 100 yards. No pain; indeed, you will never even hear the shot. Still in the hospital? Perhaps nerve gas in the oxy-gen line. Very effective. Some options are a bit messy, and therein lies the rub. The hypocrites want everything all “nice ” and sanitized.

50|$|Then, she and {{her sister}} were taken up to the platform. The executioner asked his helpers to take her first for the sake of order, as her sister was quiet and passive. He told them to hold her firmly, to {{preserve}} his reputation. She <b>kicked</b> <b>and</b> <b>screamed</b> about vengeance, <b>and</b> cursed and fought every step of the way. It finally took four men just to get her up to the platform. On the platform, three men sat on her to hold her down, a fourth pulled her hair to expose her neck, and a fifth struggled to press her head down to get her neck in place. The executioner aimed and struck. The audience cheered at a perfect strike as her head fell to the ground. Her sister was quickly dealt with, and then the corpse of Anna Månsdotter was decapitated. The three heads and bodies were nailed onto ladders and dropped onto the stakes.|$|R

All had been a scheme laid amongst them for defrauding her poor fatherless child, driving him away, and taking up this beggarly brat. She had seen through the little baggage from the first, and she pitied Master Headley. Rage was utterly ungovernable in those days, and she actually was flying to attack Dennet with her nails when the alderman caught her by the wrists; {{and she would have}} been almost too much for him, had not Kit Smallbones come to his assistance, and carried her, <b>kicking</b> <b>and</b> <b>screaming</b> like a naughty child, into the house.

Coleridge, or Coley, to give him the {{abbreviation}} by which he was known not only through childhood but through life, was a fair little fellow, with bright deep-blue eyes, inheriting much of his nature from her and her family, but not by any means a model boy. He was, indeed, deeply and warmly affectionate, but troublesome through outbreaks of will and temper, showing all the ordinary instinct of trying how far the authorities for the time being will endure resistance; sufficiently indolent of mind to use his excellent abilities to save exertion of intellect; passionate to <b>kicking</b> <b>and</b> <b>screaming</b> pitch, and at times showing the doggedness which is such a trial of patience to the parent.

60|$|It {{got into}} Ann Veronica's nights at last {{and kept her}} awake, the perplexing {{contrast}} between the advanced thought and the advanced thinker. The general propositions of Socialism, for example, struck her as admirable, but she certainly did not extend her admiration to any of its exponents. She was still more stirred {{by the idea of}} the equal citizenship of men and women, by the realization that a big and growing organization of women were giving form and a generalized expression to just that personal pride, that aspiration for personal freedom and respect which had brought her to London; but when she heard Miss Miniver discoursing on {{the next step in the}} suffrage campaign, or read of women badgering Cabinet Ministers, padlocked to railings, or getting up in a public meeting to pipe out a demand for votes and be carried out <b>kicking</b> <b>and</b> <b>screaming,</b> her soul revolted.
