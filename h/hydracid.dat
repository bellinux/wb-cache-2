If for the oxacid a <b>hydracid</b> be {{substituted}} (927.),--as one {{analogous to the}} muriatic, for instance,--then the state of things changes altogether, and a current due to the chemical action of the acid on the base is possible. But now both the bodies act as electrolytes, for it is only one principle of each which combine mutually,--as, for instance, the chlorine with the metal,--and the hydrogen of the acid and the oxygen of the base are ready to traverse with the chlorine of the acid and the metal of the base in conformity with the current {{and according to the}} general principles already so fully laid down.|$|E
40|$|The {{reaction}} of CH 2 OO, the smallest carbonyl oxide (Criegee intermediate, CI), with several acids was investigated using the CCSD(T) /aug-cc-pVTZ//M 06 - 2 X/aug-cc-pVTZ quantum chemical method, {{as well as}} microvariational transition state theory and RRKM master equation theoretical kinetic methodologies. For oxoacids HNO 3 and HCOOH, a 1, 4 -insertion mechanism allows for barrierless reactions with high rate coefficients, in agreement with literature experimental data. This mechanism relies {{on the presence of}} a double bond in the α-position to the acidic OH group. We predict that reactions of CI with enols will likewise have high rate coefficients, proceeding through a similar mechanism. The <b>hydracid</b> HCl was found to react through a less favorable 1, 2 -insertion reaction, leading to lower rate coefficients, again in good agreement with the literature. We conclude that the reaction mechanism is the main indicator for the reaction rate for CH 2 OO + acid reactions, with acidity only of secondary influence. At room temperature and 1 atm the main product for all reactions was found to be the thermalized hydroperoxide initial adduct, with minor yields of fragmentation products. One of the product channels characterized is a novel reaction path involving intramolecular H-abstraction after a roaming reaction in the OH + product radical complex formed by the dissociation of the hydroperoxide adduct; this channel is the lowest fragmentation route for some of the reactions studied...|$|E

Without {{speaking}} with the same confidence, yet from the experiments described, and many others not described, relating to hydro-fluoric, hydro-cyanic, ferro-cyanic, and sulpho-cyanic acids (770. 771. 772.), and from the close analogy which holds between these bodies and the <b>hydracids</b> of chlorine, iodine, bromine, &c., I consider these also as coming under subjection to the law, and assisting to prove its truth.|$|R
40|$|The {{electrical}} properties of ice doped with {{the series of}} <b>hydracids</b> from HF to HI, with NH 3 and with NH 3 and HF in different ratios were studied. In most cases the,DC conductivity was measured. The similarity of the results obtained under these conditions for ice doped with different <b>hydracids</b> indicates that these monovalent anions play a similar role in the ~;ystal lattice {{in spite of their}} different diameters. A comparison of the behaviour of the ice+HF+NH 3 system with that of ice+HF and ice+NH 3 shows that, as a first approximation, the general laws of electrolytes may be applied to doped ice. An estimation is obtained of the dissociation constants involved and of the ratio p_Ip+ between the mobility of OH- and H 30 + ions. Ice doped with NH 3 and, in a few cases, ice doped with NH 4 F were also studied by an AC method. The results indicate that the concentration in the lattice of Bjerrum defects of D type is slightly increased by the presence of NH 3. An estimation was obtained of the corresponding dis-sociation constants and of the ratio PDI PL, between the mobility of D and L defects. The estimation shows that PDI PL < 1. This may be caus~d by the higher formation energy of the D defects than that of the L defects. I...|$|R
30|$|Starting from 2010, on {{the west}} coast of Salento area (Lecce province, {{southern}} Italy), symptoms of the so-called CoDiRO “Olive Quick Decline Syndrome” were observed (i.e., leaf scorching, twig and branch wilting, tree die-back) [1]. Subsequently, the syndrome spread over many hectares of olive trees causing dramatic effects and currently it represents a serious local emergence [2]. Xylella fastidiosa is a Gram-negative bacterium member of the Xanthomonadaceae (γ-proteobacteria) which colonizes the xylem of host plants and the foreguts of insect vectors [3]. This plant pathogen was recently found associated with the CoDiRO [4, 5]. X. fastidiosa infects a wide range of host plants, such as grapevine, almond, blueberry, cherry, peach, coffee, and citrus trees, causing great economic losses mainly in North, Central and South America [6]. The pathogen is also known to infect landscape and ornamental trees such as oak, maple, and oleander [4]. The introduction of latently infected ornamental plants from Central America was reported as the venue for the subsequent spread of the pathogen in Salento [7]. The main symptoms associated with infections of X. fastidiosa are the marginal and or apical leaf scorching, twig and branch die-back and plant death [3]. The symptoms have been attributed to prolonged water stress caused by bacterium growth and biofilm formation in the xylem vessels [8]. The negative socioeconomic impact of X. fastidiosa infection in North and South America (i.e., USA and Brazil) and now in Italy is well known. In the latter case, the negative impact is due not only to relevant economic losses, but also to the dramatic effect on the typical cultural heritage represented by olive trees. Apulian 1000 -year-old olive trees are protected as local patrimony and considered a symbol of the local identity, also for their massive presence in the territory. Moreover, six over a number of 60  mln of olive trees were classified as monumental, as resulted from the first olive tree census in the whole Apulia region [9]. For these reasons, when implementing a specific control method in order to contain the further disease spread, it is important to study also its social and cultural acceptability as well as its socioeconomic impact [10]. Therefore, the need to adopt specific agronomic and phytosanitary measures to improve the vegetative state of the plants has been recently raised. For these reasons, the study of the CoDiRO effects on symptomatic olive trees by using the NMR-based metabolomics approach was carried out. In this study, we analyzed the effects of a CE approved fertilizer, known as DENTAMET® (i.e., a mixture of zinc and copper complex with <b>hydracids</b> of citric acid [11]) sprayed on symptomatic olive trees located in Salento. This fertilizer can be considered as a product with a dual action formulation by which the correction of Zn and Cu deficiencies occurs very quickly, as well as a resistance is induced by the cyclic peptide resembling the chemical structure of several antimicrobial substances released from the plant in response to different stresses. Thanks to the low environmental impact and few restrictions on its use, DENTAMET® is allowed for organic farming and commercialized in more than 30 countries in the world [11].|$|R
