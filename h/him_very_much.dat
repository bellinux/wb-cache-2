25|$|My dad was not {{the monster}} my lying brother said he was; he was strict, but my father never beat us black and blue, and my brother Gary was a vicious, no-good liar for saying so. I have nothing but fond {{memories}} of Dad, going to studios with him, family vacations at our cabin in Idaho, boating and fishing with him. To my dying day, I'll hate Gary for dragging Dad's name through the mud. He wrote Going My Own Way out of greed. He wanted to make money and knew that humiliating our father and blackening his name {{was the only way}} he could do it. He knew it would generate a lot of publicity. That was {{the only way he could}} get his ugly, no-talent face on television and in the newspapers. My dad was my hero. I loved <b>him</b> <b>very</b> <b>much.</b> He loved all of us too, including Gary. He was a great father.|$|E
500|$|His {{outspokenness}} {{about the}} issues facing the Armenian population annoyed not only the Ottoman authorities {{but some of the}} Armenian wealthy elite as well. According to Gerard Libaridian, the promotion of rights of provincial Armenians [...] "made him an enemy of many influential Armenians in Istanbul." [...] He was compelled to resign by the Ottoman government in 1873. Armayis Vartooguian wrote in 1896 that Khrimian [...] "could have held the post of Patriarch of Constantinople for life had he not been driven to resign by the intrigues of the Turkish Government, which disliked <b>him</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> because of his zeal for the well-being of his flock." ...|$|E

[...] He {{turned to}} our guide and smiled, {{and pointed to}} the machine, and pointed again, and then to his head, and then to the machine. By some defect of {{reasoning}} he seemed to imagine that broken English might help these gestures. [...] "Me look 'im," [...] he said, [...] "me think <b>'im</b> <b>very</b> <b>much.</b> Yes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You have no conjecture, then? I wish to find <b>him,</b> <b>much,</b> <b>very</b> <b>much,</b> but cannot {{put myself}} upon his trail. He is {{so what you}} call {{peculiar}} that he writes no letters, leaves no address, and roves here and there like a born gitano." ...|$|R
500|$|In 2007, Gene Wilder said {{he chose}} not to see the film. [...] "The thing that put me off ... I like Johnny Depp, I like him, as an actor I like <b>him</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> ... but when I saw little pieces in the {{promotion}} of what he was doing, I said I don't want to see the film, because I don't want to be disappointed in him." [...] In 2013, when Wilder was asked about the Burton remake, he said [...] "I think it's an insult. It's probably Warner Bros.' insult." [...] He also criticized the choices that Burton made as a director, saying [...] "I don't care for that director. He's a talented man, but I don't care for him doing stuff like he did." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite {{criticism}} {{following the}} arrival of the French New Wave, career retrospectives of Clouzot's work have been positive. Twenty years after his death, film critic Noël Herpe wrote in the French film journal Positif that [...] "Les Diaboliques (just like Les Espions and La Verite) reveals a sterile and increasingly exaggerated urge to experiment with the powers of fiction". Film historian Philipe Pilard wrote, [...] "There is no doubt that if Clouzot had worked for Hollywood and applied the formulas of U.S. studios, today he would be lauded by the very critics who choose to ignore him". Clouzot today is generally known for his thriller films The Wages of Fear and Diabolique. Clouzot's ability in the genre led to comparisons with Alfred Hitchcock. Clouzot respected Hitchcock's work, stating, [...] "I admire <b>him</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> and am flattered when anyone compares a film of mine to his".|$|E
500|$|In the episode, the {{character}} of Sheriff Graham was killed off, something that actor Jamie Dornan had known would happen since ABC picked up the pilot. It {{was the first major}} death of the series. In an interview with E! reporter Kristin Dos Santos, Dornan hinted that while his counterpart in Storybrooke has died, the huntsman could return at some point, as Dornan is still a regular on the series. As much of the episode involves Graham discovering his fairytale past, the writers designed the episode to mislead viewers by having them invest in {{the character}}. Kitsis and Horowitz commented that while the death made them [...] "sad," [...] the battle between Emma and Regina requires [...] "stakes and unfortunately, sometimes stakes are people's lives." [...] They also decided to kill the character relatively early in the series in order to show viewers that [...] "it's real. It's not in Henry's head." [...] Kitsis continued, [...] "It’s interesting, but part of the intent was to make you love him and we loved <b>him</b> <b>very</b> <b>much.</b> And the fact that the audience seems to have loved him means a lot to us, in that we feel like we succeeded on that front. If you don’t feel sad, then it was a failure of the execution of the story." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although Smuts was {{not alone}} in his views, his support of Kruger had brought <b>him</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> to the President’s notice. [...] Smuts’s {{brilliant}} academic record and excellent reputation, all combined with his Cape origins, attracted Kruger still further. [...] On 8 June 1898 Smuts, at 28 years of age, was granted second-class citizenship of the Transvaal; enabling Kruger to appoint him to the post of State Attorney the same day.|$|E
2500|$|A fellow gentleman rider – Arthur Yates – {{was quoted}} as saying of Baird, [...] "I liked <b>him</b> <b>very</b> <b>much,</b> but {{unfortunately}} he did not choose his friends wisely, and the results were disastrous. None of his companions, however, came with him to Bishop Sutton, for he knew I would not tolerate any of them, and thus I always saw the best side of his nature, which was, at bottom, very gentle and pleasant." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Let me go!' she cried. 'Let me go! Let me go!' He {{held her}} in bewilderment and terror. She thrust {{her hands in}} his chest and pushed him apart.

2500|$|WCW {{commentator}} Tony Schiavone acknowledged Marella's {{death on}} the October 11, 1999, episode of WCW Monday Nitro. Bobby Heenan insisted on doing a tribute to Marella, even though Marella never worked for WCW. Heenan said on-air: [...] "Gorilla will be sadly missed. Now he was one big tough man. He was a decent honest man. And we're all gonna miss <b>him</b> <b>very</b> <b>much.</b> And you know the pearly gates in heaven? It's now gonna be called 'the Gorilla position.' Goodbye, my friend." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1518, Juan de Grijalva {{arrived in}} Yokot'an lands, and {{was greeted with}} hostility. The next year, Cortés's {{expedition}} reached Tabasco, and he met with Tabscoob and other chiefs, who supplied him the translator who later became known as Doña Marina or La Malinche. According to Díaz, [...] "Before we left, Cortés won the chiefs by his many kind words, telling them how our master, the Emperor, had many grand lords who gave him obedience {{and that they should}} also obey him that whatever they might need we would give them. All the chiefs thanked <b>him</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> and declared themselves vassals of our great emperor, the first in New Spain to give obedience to His Majesty.|$|E
2500|$|Holden's first {{starring}} role was in Golden Boy (1939), costarring Barbara Stanwyck, {{in which he}} played a violinist-turned-boxer. He was still an unknown actor at the time, while Stanwyck was already a film star. She liked Holden and went {{out of her way}} to help him succeed, devoting her personal time to coaching and encouraging him, which made them into lifelong friends. When she received her Honorary Oscar at the 1982 Academy Award ceremony, Holden had died in an accident just a few months prior. At the end of her acceptance speech, she paid him a personal tribute: [...] "I loved <b>him</b> <b>very</b> <b>much,</b> and I miss him. He always wished that I would get an Oscar. And so tonight, my golden boy, you got your wish".|$|E
6000|$|... "That is {{the worst}} part of it all, Lucy. If I did not like him I should not mind it half so much. It is just because I like <b>him</b> so <b>very</b> <b>much</b> that I am so very unhappy. His hair is just the colour of Aunt Emmeline's big shawl." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{must have}} been a brave man for a foreigner,--to have {{attacked}} Mr. Bonteen all alone in the street, when any one might have seen him.

60|$|Nevis had {{reasons for}} believing {{that it would}} be more {{difficult}} than she seemed to anticipate, but he talked about something else, and then, finding that his companion did not favor <b>him</b> with <b>very</b> <b>much</b> attention, he took his leave. When he was getting into his buggy Hunter came up and stopped him.|$|R
2500|$|Shortly afterwards, Tony begins dating Jeanne Benoit (Scottie Thompson) and {{is shown}} {{to be on the}} verge of a serious {{commitment}} for the first time within the series. His romance with Jeanne continues to progress throughout the year, and he remains tight-lipped about it when his colleagues notice the change in his behavior. When questioned about the effects this would have on Tony and Ziva's relationship, de Pablo commented, [...] "Am I just being jealous? I don't know. I still love <b>him</b> <b>very</b> <b>much,</b> but I've sort of thrown away that possibility because I think he's really struggling with some immense feelings for somebody else." [...] In an interview with Chicago Tribune, she clarified that Ziva [...] "does have feelings for DiNozzo," [...] but that she was uncertain that this would be addressed.|$|E
2500|$|William Holden and Stanwyck {{were friends}} of long standing. [...] When Stanwyck and Holden were {{presenting}} the Best Sound Oscar for 1977, Holden paused {{to pay a}} special tribute to her for saving his career when Holden was cast in the lead for Golden Boy (1939). After a series of unsteady daily performances, {{he was about to}} be fired, but Stanwyck staunchly defended him, successfully standing up to the film producers. Shortly after Holden's death, Stanwyck recalled the moment when receiving her honorary Oscar: [...] "A few years ago I stood on this stage with William Holden as a presenter. I loved <b>him</b> <b>very</b> <b>much,</b> and I miss him. He always wished that I would get an Oscar. And so tonight, my golden boy, you got your wish." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1802 the Edgeworths {{toured the}} English midlands. They then {{travelled}} to the continent, first to Brussels {{and then to}} Consulate France (during the Peace of Amiens, a brief lull in the Napoleonic Wars). They met all the notables, and Maria received a marriage proposal from a Swedish courtier, Count Edelcrantz. Her letter on the subject seems very cool, but her stepmother assures us in the Augustus Hare Life and Letters that Maria loved <b>him</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> and did not get over the affair quickly. [...] They came home to Ireland in 1803 {{on the eve of}} the resumption of the wars and Maria returned to writing. Tales of Fashionable Life, The Absentee and Ormond are novels of Irish life. Edgeworth was an extremely popular author who was compared with her contemporary writers Jane Austen and Sir Walter Scott. She initially earned more than them, and used her income to help her siblings.|$|E

2500|$|Although many {{consider}} him {{not a part}} of the Battle of the Little Bighorn that is still up for debate. Most of Red Shirt's history has been written down. Living family members of his tell of his bravery in battle. Buffalo Bill Cody was impressed with Red Shirt. “Among the prominent chiefs thus engaged was Red Shirt, a redoubtable warrior and second only in influence to Sitting Bull himself. A short while before his engagement with us he had quelled an uprising among his people, instigated by a pretender to the chieftainship of the tribe, by invading the pretender's camp with only two of his followers and shooting the leader dead before the eyes of his affrighted wife. This fearless act had served to elevate <b>him</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> in the eyes of his people, who thereafter accepted him as a leader. When, therefore, he decided to join the Wild West show, under the flattering offers I made him, his influence aided us very much in procuring our complement of Indians, not only from his own tribe, but from others as well.” ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to his tutoring and lecturing, Gaskell campaigned for better education for the working classes, co-founding the Lancashire Public Schools Association in 1847. He served on the committee of the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society, which gave public lectures and campaigned for social change; in 1849, he became the Chairman of the Portico Library, a subscription lending library. In 1861, he helped to organise {{a meeting of the}} British Association for the Advancement of Science which brought scientists from across the world to Manchester. [...] Gaskell seemed to relish the immense teaching burden he accumulated in later life. Elizabeth Gaskell complained that 'you might as well ask St Pauls to tumble down, as entreat him to give up this piece of work; which does interest <b>him</b> <b>very</b> <b>much,</b> & which no one could do so well certainly...' Though she was referring specifically to his Owens College lectures, he seems to have diligently pursued all his various projects, and found excuses to avoid giving up any obligation he had once started.|$|E
2500|$|Very {{little is}} known of Ouranos's origin, his early years or his family, and the chronicles {{represent}} <b>him</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> as a [...] "new man". A prōtospatharios and asēkrētis Basil Ouranos, possibly an elder relative, is attested, and we know from Nikephoros's letters {{that he had a}} brother named Michael. Nikephoros Ouranos himself first enters history in the early 980s, during negotiations between Byzantium and the Emir of Baghdad for the return of the renegade rebel general Bardas Skleros. After a first Byzantine embassy in 980, an Arab embassy under Ibn Shahram visited Constantinople in 982, and Ouranos is mentioned in its report as a confidante of the young Basil II, holding the high court position of epi tou kanikleiou (keeper of the kanikleion, the imperial inkstand). Ibn Shahram further mentioned that Ouranos's close association with the emperor made him an enemy to the powerful eunuch parakoimomenos, Basil Lekapenos, who had supervised the affairs of state for decades. During the negotiations, Ouranos functioned as the intermediary between the Arabs and the emperor, and he was subsequently chosen by the parakoimomenos to head a Byzantine delegation to Baghdad, which would take custody of Skleros.|$|E
