40|$|Polymer {{insulators}} {{are widely}} used now a day in high voltage transmission lines to replace porcelain and toughened glass insulators due to their better service performance in polluted environment. Despite this advantage, the major cause of polymeric insulator failure {{is due to the}} polymer material aging and degradation which is caused by electrical stress on the high voltage terminal of the insulator. In this project, three techniques for optimising electric field on outdoor polymeric are simulated using COMSOL Multiphysics along the insulator profile. The techniques are by i) improve insulator weather shed shape, ii) corona ring <b>installation</b> <b>optimisation</b> location and iii) adding microvaristor compound as filler. An 11 kV polymeric insulator model in clean and dry condition is used in the simulation and the results from the simulation shown all these three techniques can improve the electric field stress on the insulator. In the first technique, a parametric study is done by adjusting the weather shed shape to obtain the best result. From the study, it is shown the weather shed diameter can reduce 70 % of the electric stress near the high voltage terminal of the insulator. As for corona ring optimisation installation, the corona ring and tube diameter, and distance from insulator is important in improving the electric field stress. By installing corona ring, the electric field has 37 % improvement. In the third techniques, Zinc Oxide with cone shape is used as microvaristor compound filler in the insulator and the improvement is 38 %...|$|E
40|$|Countries {{are pushing}} {{for the use of}} local, {{renewable}} energy sources {{in order to reduce the}} dependence on fossil fuels for energy supply. One of the main problems with several renewable energy sources is their variability, which can be solved with energy storage. With buildings representing an important share of energy consumption, and given the growing capacity of distributed generation, distributed energy storage in buildings is expected to become increasingly present. In this context, the optimal dimensioning of home installations of photovoltaics and lithium-ion batteries, and the impact of such installations on the grid, is of the utmost importance. While there have been developments on this field, some important handicaps remain, notably the independent treatment of <b>installation</b> <b>optimisation</b> and grid impact and the substantial result differences between studies. In this paper, photovoltaics and lithium-ion storage installations are optimised through the use of real, high-resolution data from several individual households, based on realistic cost figures, and through well-defined metrics that correctly grasp the problem at hand. The impact on the grid as well as possible mitigation measures are also analysed. Results show that up to about 30 % of electricity self-sufficiency can be obtained using only PV and close to grid parity. Above 40 % self-sufficiency, energy storage must be used, strongly increasing the cost of such installations. Economies of scale play an important role suggesting a preferential implementation for larger users or at a community-scale. Feed-in limits seem to be a good solution to attenuate grid impact. On the other hand, a higher share of a capacity-based component on the grid tariff strongly affects the economic viability of such installations for the average household. These results are important for studies on distributed photovoltaics and energy storage as well as for energy policy. Also, the large range of results made available, calculated on a free market perspective using a simple control mechanism, provide a much-needed benchmark for further comparable studies. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|Designing a {{rock bolt}} {{reinforcement}} system for underground excavation involves determining bolt pattern, spacing, and size. In this paper, a topology optimisation technique is presented and employed to simultaneously optimise these design variables. To improve rock bolt design, the proposed technique minimises a displacement based function around the opening after bolt <b>installation.</b> This <b>optimisation</b> technique {{is independent of}} the material model and can be easily applied to any material model for rock and bolts. It is also extremely flexible in {{that it can be}} applied to any mechanical analysis method. To illustrate the capabilities of this method, numerical examples with non-linear material models and discontinuities in the host rock are presented. It is shown that the complexity of systems optimised using this approach is only restricted by limitations of the method used to analyse mechanical system responses...|$|R

The furnace may be run with PNG / LPG as an alternative fuel by making small changes in combustion system only. The furnace has an overall combustion Volume of 44. 4 m. It is fitted with a chimney {{to allow for the}} escape of combustion flue gases. The combustion air blower discharge air into the furnace at the rate of 1400 m/hr with an air fuel ratio 11 : 1. This furnace was designed to consume 100 litters of LDO per Hour fuel with a rating of 40000 BTU / liter which is required to raise the temperature of 16 Ton MS round plate to 1050 ºC. These MS plates are then forged in the press to manufacture the dish end of pressure vessel. The theoretical efficiency of the furnace is considered to be 30 % for design calculations.

40|$|The {{main goal}} of the {{researches}} {{is the development of}} new approaches, algorithms and numerical techniques for multi-objective optimisation of design of industrial induction heating <b>installations.</b> A multi-objective <b>optimisation</b> problem is mathematically formulated in terms of the typical optimisation criteria, e. g., maximum heating accuracy and minimum energy consumption. Various mathematical methods and algorithms for multi-objective optimisation, such as Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) and optimal control alternance method, have been implemented and integrated in a user-friendly automated optimal design package. Several optimisation procedures have been tested and investigated for a problem-oriented mathematical model in a number of comparative case studies. A general comparison of the design solutions based on NSGA-II and alternance method leads to their good agreement in all investigated cases. The methodology developed is planned to be applied to more complex real-life problems of the optimal design and control of different induction heating systems...|$|R
40|$|With {{a typical}} {{investment}} of {{in excess of}} £ 100 million for each project, the installation phase of offshore wind farms {{is an area where}} substantial cost-reductions can be achieved; however, to-date there have been relatively few studies exploring this. In this paper, we develop a mixed-method framework which exploits the complementary strengths of two decision-support methods: discrete-event simulation and robust optimisation. The simulation component allows developers to estimate the impact of user-defined asset selections on the likely cost and duration of the full or partial completion of the <b>installation</b> process. The <b>optimisation</b> component provides developers with an installation schedule that is robust to changes in operation durations due to weather uncertainties. The combined framework provides a decision-support tool which enhances the individual capability of both models by feedback channels between the two, and provides a mechanism to address current OWF installation projects. The combined tool, verified and validated by external experts, was applied to an installation case study to illustrate the application of the combined approach. An installation schedule was identified which accounted for seasonal uncertainties and optimised the ordering of activities...|$|R
