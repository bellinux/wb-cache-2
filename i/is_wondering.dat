5|$|Mark Brennan (Scott McGregor) waits nervously for {{an answer}} from his girlfriend, Kate Ramsay (Ashleigh Brewer), about going into witness {{protection}} with him. He states {{that it is too}} dangerous for him to stay in Erinsborough and that she can bring her younger sister, Sophie (Kaiya Jones), with them. Kate tells Mark that she does not want to lose him and agrees to go. Mark reveals that they only have half an hour and heads over to his house to pack. Sophie returns home and Kate tells her that they are leaving town that night. An upset Sophie explains that she cannot pack her life up in a bag and refuses to go. Kate tells her the decision has already been made and they are leaving. As Mark <b>is</b> <b>wondering</b> whether to call his parents, his housemate, Jade Mitchell (Gemma Pranita), arrives home unexpectedly. When she enquires about his bag, he tells her he needs a change of clothes for a double shift. Kate finds Mark and asks for more time, but Mark tells her they do not have any. He gives her the details of the meeting point and they kiss, before Kate leaves him.|$|E

2500|$|Australia's Rod Marsh blamed England coach Keith Fletcher for {{the poor}} {{performances}} and for a negative attitude towards the series, criticising the coach's press conference comments in Adelaide. [...] "A team must always, always, play to win {{and even if you}} think that way you should never say it," [...] he told radio listeners. [...] "'The best we can do is an honourable draw' – what a load of codswallop. If anyone <b>is</b> <b>wondering</b> why England have had such a hard time in Australia, there lies the answer", but Fletcher refused to quit, citing a string of injuries and illnesses that had hampered the tour as the main cause of the team's lack of success and defending the inclusion of Gooch and Gatting, noting that [...] "indsight is a brilliant thing, but there was not one person who would have left Graham at home {{at the start of the}} tour." ...|$|E

2500|$|A third {{recurring}} {{image is}} that of the lion. This is introduced by Rutland in Act 1, Scene 3; [...] "So looks the pent-up lion o'er the wretch" [...] (l.174). Later, Richard, speaking of York, says [...] "Methought he bore him in the thickest troop/As doth a lion in a herd of neat" [...] (2.1.13–14). As Clifford chastises Henry for disinheriting Prince Edward, he asks [...] "To whom do lions cast their gentle looks?/Not to the beast that would usurp the den" [...] (2.2.11–12). Lions are then mentioned in conjunction with lambs during the Battle of Tewkesbury; [...] "While lions roar and battle for their dens/Poor harmless lambs abide their enmity" [...] (2.5.74–75). Lions and lambs are again combined when, just before his second capture, Henry <b>is</b> <b>wondering</b> why the people prefer Edward to him; [...] "And when the lion fawns upon the lamb,/The lamb will never cease to follow him" [...] (4.8.49–50). Warwick later combines lions and birds during his death speech, [...] "I must yield my body to the earth/And by my fall, the conquest to my foe./Thus yields the cedar to the axe's edge,/Whose arms gave shelter to the princely eagle,/Under whose shade the ramping lion slept" [...] (5.2.9–13).|$|E
2500|$|Vocalist Ronnie Radke {{had been}} hinting on Twitter {{that the group}} {{had been working on}} the band's second album, with tweets such as [...] "You guys don't {{understand}} how many light years my next album is from the last one". He and bandmate Ron Ficarro tweeted pictures of them in the studio with Ryan Ogren working on some new music. Ronnie had said {{a little bit about the}} new album to Marshal Music News. He said that, [...] "The last record was so vengeful and bitter and spiteful - so everyone <b>is</b> <b>wondering</b> what I'm gonna sing about next. And I'm just not quite ready to let people know. I'm sorry. When people hear the new stuff though I promise you they will lose their mind. It's light years ahead of my last album. We're demoing new songs right now, as we speak, and I'm telling you, people are seriously gonna lose their mind." [...] During the band's performance at Dirt Fest 2012 in Birch Run Michigan, Radke announced to the crowd that it would be the group's last show before returning to the studio for the band's second album. Ronnie also said in an interview that the band would be in the studio late 2012 with demos already and hoping for an early 2013 release. In issue number 1442 of Kerrang! Magazine, Ronnie Radke announced in an interview that [...] "The record's finished! That's what we did after the Warped Tour. We just didn't tell anybody!" [...] He also said [...] " [...] early next year !" ...|$|E
2500|$|The persuasive {{power of}} {{language}} is first alluded to by Charles, who tells Joan after she has assured him she can end {{the siege of}} Orléans, [...] "Thou hast astonished me with thy high terms" [...] (1.2.93). This sense is repeated when the Countess of Auvergne <b>is</b> <b>wondering</b> about Talbot and says to her servant, [...] "Great is the rumour of this dreadful knight,/And his achievements of no less account./Fain would mine eyes be witness with mine ears,/To give their censure of these rare reports" [...] (2.3.7–10). Like Charles, Auvergne has been astonished with the 'high terms' bestowed on Talbot, and now she wishes {{to see if the}} report and the reality conflate. Later in the play, the persuasive power of language becomes important for Joan, as she uses it as a subterfuge to sneak into Rouen, telling her men, [...] "Be wary how you place your words;/Talk like the vulgar sort of market men/That come to gather money for their corn" [...] (3.2.3.5). Later, she uses language to persuade Burgundy to join with the Dauphin against the English. As Burgundy realises he is succumbing to her rhetoric, he muses to himself, [...] "Either she hath bewitched me with her words,/Or nature makes me suddenly relent" [...] (3.3.58–59). Here, language is shown to be so powerful as to act on Burgundy the same way Nature itself would act, {{to the point where he}} is unsure if he has been persuaded by a natural occurrence or by Joan's words. Language is thus presented as capable of transforming ideology. As Joan finishes her speech, Burgundy again attests to the power of her language, [...] "I am vanquish'd. These haughty words of hers/Have battered me like roaring canon-shot,/And made me almost yield upon my knees" [...] (3.3.78–80). Later, something similar happens with Henry, who agrees to marry Margaret merely because of Suffolk's description of her. In a line that echoes Burgundy's, Henry queries what it is that has prompted him to agree to Suffolk's suggestion: [...] "Whether it be through force of your report,/My noble lord of Suffolk, or for that/My tender youth was never yet attaint/With any passion of inflaming love, I cannot tell" [...] (5.6.79–83). Here, again, the power of language is shown to be so strong as to be confused with a natural phenomenon.|$|E
