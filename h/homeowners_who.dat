The total cost of paving the trail {{was expected to be}} $750,000, though it eventually ballooned to $1.5 million. The decision to pave the trail was vehemently opposed by horseback riders who felt it would endanger them, and protested at several public meetings by the Mid-Hudson Horse Trails Association.

25|$|The city of Bell {{assessed}} {{property owners}} for sewer fees without getting the mandated voter approval. The Times acquired {{a letter to}} the city in which Controller John Chiang stated that property owners overpaid $621,737 in fees that were illegally increased since 2007. The extra tax added about $20 per parcel for each of the last three years’ tax bills. After the salary scandal surfaced in July 2010, about a hundred residents protested at City Council meetings, saying they believed that their taxes were too high. Many residents said they had noticed assessments on their tax bills that they were never informed of and did not understand. ABC News announced that Bell <b>homeowners</b> <b>who</b> had overpaid their property taxes {{over the last three years}} would be refunded the funds that were collected illegally. In September 2010, Lieutenant Governor Maldonado signed Assembly Bill 900, which returned $3,000,000 collected from 4,000 residents.|$|E
25|$|By 1970, central Jamaica Plain was {{considered}} to be in a state of decline. The intrusion of the Southwest Corridor coupled with and possibly contributing to a decision by Boston banks to cut back mortgage lending (redline) there began a cycle of disinvestment which led to the deterioration of the housing stock, slumlording and abandonment particularly in the central neighborhood along the edges of the corridor. In some cases, <b>homeowners</b> <b>who</b> could not sell {{due to a lack of}} buyer financing simply walked away from older homes along the corridor's periphery. Urban Edge, founded as a non-profit real estate firm in 1974, found it necessary to recruit volunteer tenants to physically take possession of empty properties to prevent vandalism and arson. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the average life span of an abandoned building was approximately one week. Windows were broken, copper plumbing was stripped out, and buildings were torched.|$|E

500|$|Community leaders {{supported}} the project {{because of its}} connections to the Jamaica and Howard Beach station. However, {{almost all of the}} civic groups along the Jamaica branch's route opposed that branch due to concerns about nuisance, noise, and traffic. There were multiple protests against the AirTrain project; during one such protest in 2000, a crane caught fire in a suspected arson. Homeowners in the vicinity believed that the concrete supports would lower the prices of their houses. Residents were also concerned about the noise that an elevated structure would create, which was a main factor in the cancellation of the LaGuardia Airport connection. According to a 2012 study, the vast majority of residents' complaints were due to [...] "nuisance violations." [...] The Port Authority responded to residents' concerns by imposing strict rules regarding disruptive or loud construction activity and implementing a streamlined damage claim process which quickly compensated <b>homeowners</b> <b>who</b> suffered damage to their homes {{as a result of the}} construction. Through 2002, there were 550 nuisance complaints about the AirTrain's construction, of which 98% had been resolved by April of that year. On the other hand, at least one community board—Queens Community Board 12, which includes South Jamaica along the AirTrain's route—recorded few complaints regarding AirTrain construction.|$|E
500|$|The Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) {{abandoned}} the Rockaway Beach Branch in 1962, {{and ever since}} it has been sought after for reactivation for train service. The line hasn't been reactivated due to local opposition, specifically the <b>homeowners</b> <b>who</b> live along the right-of-way. One group wants the line's reactivation for transit service. A second group would use the right-of-way as a linear park, known as the Queensway, a proposal inspired {{by the success of}} the High Line in Manhattan. The final group involving homeowners would have nothing done, keeping the line as is. Most plans call for the line to be used for subway service, with the line being connected to the south with the IND Rockaway Line. Talks of reactivating the line were publicly endorsed in February 2012 by Assemblymen Phillip Goldfeder and Michael G. Miller. Goldfeder commented [...] "The commute for people here is only going to go from bad to worse. You can’t talk about a convention center without talking about transportation." [...] Goldfeder and Miller said they are not opposed to turning sections of the line into a park, but said {{people who live in the}} Rockaways, Ozone Park and other areas have no quick or easy way to get into Manhattan. The Genting Group, which operates Resorts World casino and have been asked to construct the convention center, are evaluating several plans to increase transportation access. Genting is committed to paying for part of the transportation improvements. Advocates of the Queensway, a proposed public park along the branch's route, are against resumption of rail service, stating that current bus service fills current transportation needs in the area. Congressmen Hakeem Jeffries and Gregory Meeks added their support for the project in March 2013. Both representatives will push to allocate federal transportation subsidies to study a plan for restored passenger service.|$|E

40|$|The {{uncertainty}} {{with regard}} to the sale price of a home {{may be one of the}} most risky aspects of owning a home. This uncertainty can be measured by the volatility of house price returns. This paper investigates the extent and development of this volatility across market segments, time, and municipalities in the Netherlands. The empirical results are based on the administrative transaction prices of all existing homes sold in the Netherlands over the period 1995 - 2008. The results in this paper indicate that the uncertainty in house prices can be substantial. Nevertheless, types of houses that are sold frequently have the lowest return volatility. In addition, the risk per unit of return is especially high during an economic bust. Moreover, (the volatility of) returns show a clear core-periphery pattern. Finally, a <b>homeowner</b> <b>who</b> moves has a cross-location hedging opportunity against sale price risk if he buys a new home at another location. Instead, a <b>homeowner</b> <b>who</b> moves to a rental house may only have been intertemporally hedged against price changes.
