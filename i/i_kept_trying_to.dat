500|$|Wider {{recognition}} came to Murphy in 2005 when he starred as Dr. Jonathan Crane in Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins. Originally {{asked to}} audition {{for the role of}} Bruce Wayne/Batman in Batman Begins, Murphy never saw himself as having the right physique for the superhero, but leapt at the chance to connect with director Christopher Nolan. Though the lead went to Christian Bale, Nolan was so impressed with Murphy that he gave him the supporting role of Dr. Jonathan Crane, whose alter ego is supervillain Scarecrow. Nolan told Spin, [...] "He has the most extraordinary eyes, and <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> invent excuses for him to take his glasses off in close-ups." [...] Murphy achieved further mainstream success that year by portraying operative Jackson Rippner who terrorises Rachel McAdams on an overnight flight in Wes Craven's thriller, Red Eye. New York Times film critic Manohla Dargis asserted that Murphy made [...] "a picture-perfect villain" [...] and that his [...] "baby blues look cold enough to freeze water and his wolfish leer suggests its own terrors". The film was favourably reviewed and earned almost $100 million worldwide.|$|E

5000|$|Like most {{abstract}} expressionists, Newman {{worked with}} large-scale canvasses {{in an attempt}} to make a large impact on viewers. As art historian Dr Beth Harris put it, the painting produces in the viewer a feeling of being drawn and overcome by it. Vir Heroicus Sublimis was his largest attempt yet at the time he released it, at 7’ 11⅜" [...] tall by 17’ 9¼" [...] wide. Like his other works, Vir Heroicus Sublimis consists of a single, slightly modulated color field separated by vertical, narrow bands called [...] "zips." [...] Newman explained that the function of the zips was to give the work scale and serve as a contrast to the massive color field; however, they were not to be viewed as separate entities.

[...] In his adolescent years however, Stevens was severely teased about his condition: [...] "When I had got sick when I was younger of course it affected my lip skin, so coming up in school I had very dark lips and my eyes were low. I had to wear shades and shit. So I was quite peculiar. People teased me about my lips, and say I look high. I didn't even start smoking weed, until after I graduated from high school." ...|$|R

Kandiah Arulanandan, or Arul as {{he was known to}} us, was my friend despite the age difference. Arul had the ability to adjust his age towards the younger side. My first impression of him when I came to UC Davis as a young Assistant Professor was that he never knocks on the door before he enters. Later I understood that this was part of his infusing personality. He literally forced me to deal with soil mechanics, for which I am grateful to this day. I still remember him storming into my office during the first years of our acquaintance waving a bunch of papers on soil fabric studies and experiments he wanted me to work on. And I happily did, until days later I was finding a paper missing which Arul had it but of course he forgot to give it to me at first place, costing both of us many lost hours.

40|$|Here’s the thing. While I have my asthma {{under control}} and my {{sleeping}} is no worse than usual, I am still near the uaigh. That’s the word for grave in Irish, and it’s {{also part of the}} word for loneliness. I’m near one or the other, or both. There was a time when my health was the only thing I talked about, and my friends from that time ask me now, and I remember that that was the person I was; when health was a fear, because pain was my first language. But what’s really bothering me is the way I use the possessive when it comes to my asthma, my insomnia, my thinning hair, my symptoms. It makes me think I think I am these things. Am I? I wilt therefore I am? If they are me, where will I go if I lose them? I remember when I learned the word ontology – the study of the nature of being. If I am sad, is sad me? If sad is me then what happens when someone treats my sadness? If we were all speaking Irish we would say that sadness is on me. But we’re not. Because when I was five I asked where English came from and my parents introduced me to stair. If we all spoke Irish we would say stair instead of history. But we speak English, mostly, and so stair is relegated to something we use to get up or down, never a story. Did you know that I carry my people’s history in my bones? People didn’t believe me when I said that but then scientists wrote about it, and discovered what was already there — inherited in the blood, the bones, the DNA, the genomes, the chromosomes, like thinning curly hair, like weak lungs, like poetry, like insomnia — and it’s all the rage now, that codified stairstory inside us. Once when I was waiting on a trolley <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> on <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> get up even though I knew I’d fall down. So they put an orderly to mind me. Well, he was there to restrain me, but I didn’t mind. He was young and eager to be seen to be good with patients. I asked him how long his shift had been and he said it was his first. After a bit of this and a bit of that he told me he wasn’t sure he’d come back for a second. I said Ah Son. I said it because I felt it even though I don’t have any sons. All of his need was raw in front of him. And my words, out of my mouth, were more surprising than anything else I heard that day. Turns out, I was happy to wait with him. He has tattoos all over his skin — quotes and quotes from poems. Stories written on the body, like a skinscripture. Just like all of us. ...|$|R

After completing this course we are sent to more advanced training or to an Officers Candidate School. It is a very good program and it will be useful to us during the war and after. Of course I still intend to finish where I left off at Bryant. I want to be what I set out for—being an accountant. Again I want to thank the Service Club for its work.

[Transcription begins]:Saturday My darling, Just got all {{parked in}} my little old {{hospital}} bed. Had to wait for hours because they forgot all about me. Honey, I love you so. Last night after we left you Mother 2 ̆ 6 I went to some restaurant {{and as soon as}} we got there they played “Making Believe. ” Lord, I’m so lonesome 2 ̆ 6 miss you so much. Gee, honey, I love you so. Just ran out of ink. I hope that you’ll be able to read this, hon—I know that pencil smears. Mother just managed to get me some more ink. They’re trying to starve me to death here, honey. The nurses are walking down the hall with trays of food but they won’t bring me any. Still haven’t seen the doctor so haven’t any idea when they’ll operate or anything. Gee darling it was so hard to leave you yesterday. I miss you so, honey. It’s terrific! You looked so adorable last night. Of course you always do but I just couldn’t believe that you were leaving for the old South. I actually expect to see you next weekend the way I used to. Golly, honey, who ever would have thought on that first night when you called me that we would get engaged and be married before another year. Everything happened so fast but it doesn’t seem that way at all. It seems as we’d always gone around together in a way. As though there’d never been another boy that I went out with. (There goes my English again). Sweetheart, I don’t know how to write you really. There are so many millions of things that I want to tell you but somehow I just can’t find the words for. The only thing I can say is I love you. That seems so inadequate. I want to tell you how very much I love you, honey, but there just aren’t words enough. All the way down to this dump (hope the nurses can’t read) I thought about you and getting married 2 ̆ 6 how wonderful things will be. Just think, next time you’re home we’ll be married. Golly, that sounds marvelous. Wish you were coming home this weekend. Wonder if you’ll get tight that night. Suppose some of the fellers get home 2 ̆ 6 want you to have a few drinks with them. Just don’t get too tight. That will be too important a night. Honey, this week sure changed me. Remember how I wanted to get tight at the reception. Well, you’ve certainly changed my mind about that 2 ̆ 6 everything. You can’t imagine how I felt before but now everything is wonderful. Some intern just came in and took my blood pressure. I hope they don’t say anything to mother about it’s [sic] being low. I almost drove him crazy telling him all the things I had when I was a kid. They’re arguing now about whether I’m going to be operated on at one or not. What a place. They were all set to prepare me for the operation 2 ̆ 6 <b>I</b> <b>kept</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> tell them that I hadn’t even seen a doctor yet. It’s a madhouse. Don’t know when the doctor’s coming but it’s three minutes of one 2 ̆ 6 they have me scheduled to be operated on at one. Oh, well, nothing ever happens to me. This is really some place. They brought me up to the sixth floor and left me sitting in a waiting room. Said they’d be right back. That right back turned out to be three quarters of an hour 2 ̆ 6 finally I said something to one of the nurses who was roaming around. She had forgotten all about me. Great place. Golly, honey, I hope that they don’t give me ether because there’s no telling what I’ll say. That would be bad! Called Woody today 2 ̆ 6 she hadn’t mailed the letter. I hope she remembers to today because that has to pay part of the doctor’s bill. Honey, I miss you so much. It sure has been perfect being with you so much. This was an almost perfect week. There was only one thing it needed to be complete. Of course you wouldn’t know what that was. We really should have gotten married, Sweetheart. It was so wonderful to be with you almost every minute. Can you imagine what we’ll be like after we’re married? It will really be pityful [sic] then. We certainly won’t have any friends. Maybe we’ll change but I sure hope not. You’re still on the train, now, darling. Gee, I wish you were here with me. Honey, everything was so nice this week. It was almost as though we were married. It was the funniest feeling that night at Nanny’s when we got lost and went to New York, remember[?] To come upstairs with you 2 ̆ 6 be staying at the same house—It will be so nice to be married. Nice is putting it rather mildly. But think how convenient it’s going to be. People won’t have to worry about conventions any more. Gee, honey this isn’t the type of letter I planned to write you. This certainly isn’t a very romantic atmosphere to write in but I sure love you. I hate to leave you last night. It was so awful to go home without you. And this morning it was even worse when you weren’t there to kiss me as soon as I woke up. That was awful. That was such a beautiful way to wake up at your house. I love you so, honey. Gee, being married to you {{is going to be the}} most wonderful thing that ever happened. It would have to be because you’re the most wonderful man in the whole world. Honestly, Judd, whenever I think of any of the other boys I ever went out with I wonder how I ever lived without you. You have everything I’ve ever admired in a man and more. Besides being so darned good looking 2 ̆ 6 so nice 2 ̆ 6 manish [sic] you’re so[,] I guess[,] versatile is the word—maybe convertable [sic]. Anyway, honey, you’re just perfect. Of course you’re stubborn but I love you more for it. You’re nice and tall. Just exactly right and sensative [sic] and sweet 2 ̆ 6 thoughtful. You’re a musician and a marvelous one at that. Wish I could tell you how much I admire you 2 ̆ 6 respect you. As long as I’ve known you I’ve [crossed-out word] you (wrong word) idolized [you] and you’ve been my ideal (my secret love). Honey, guess what—since the last line I’ve had my tonsils out! The nurse came 2 ̆ 6 said the doctor wanted to look at me 2 ̆ 6 they got me all bandaged up in those hospital rags 2 ̆ 6 before I know it my tonsils were out. I feel fine. My writing is a little shaky because they have so much junk on the table. Honey, it’s so funny—my mouth feels as though I had millions of marbles 2 ̆ 6 about four times it’s [sic] normal size. The whole thing didn’t take more than ten minutes. It was all very disappointing. You know in the movies how it’s all so dramatic—well, the movies are crazy. This wasn’t. He sat me in a chair. Well, first of all, there was a lovely build up. The nurse came in 2 ̆ 6 dressed me in real sanitary stuff. You could almost feel the germlessness. So then she wrapped my feet in big booties. All white and tied a rag around my hair. It was all nice 2 ̆ 6 dramatic because they were hurrying like a movie 2 ̆ 6 I couldn’t get the back of the thing buttoned—more fun. Then a guy came with a wheelchair 2 ̆ 6 wrapped me in a white sheet—sarong style. Then they threw me in the wheel chair cause the sarong was so tight around me [sic] knees. Well, he pushed me down the hall 2 ̆ 6 I felt real sharp 2 ̆ 6 like I was impressing everyone with the seriousness of my condition. We rode up to the seventh floor and there were loads of rooms with tables in them 2 ̆ 6 lights over them 2 ̆ 6 instruments hanging all around. Well, that was fine. I began to feel mighty important and sorry for myself. Thinking how glad I was he was only going to look at my throat. Well, I got into his office after passing about five rooms with all the tables 2 ̆ 6 gagets [sic] in them. It had a chair like the dentist’s office and they put me in it. The doctor was nice. There was a nurse with a thing around her nose 2 ̆ 6 mouth. That all added to the impression. So far it was all good. He looks down my throat 2 ̆ 6 says it’s not bad—inflamed or anything. So he gets out the huge needle. Honestly, honey it was miles long 2 ̆ 6 stabs my throat with it. He jabed [sic] around half a dozen times 2 ̆ 6 I was chatting merrily away to him about whether it was going to hurt or not. Then he told me to listen that my voice would go away. It did 2 ̆ 6 you should hear me. I’m much worse than Kenneth ever was. Honestly, hon, it’s a riot. I began to laugh 2 ̆ 6 he had to laugh with me. Well, it’s beginning to hurt like the devil now. Have to stop writing now. [Transcription ends...|$|E
