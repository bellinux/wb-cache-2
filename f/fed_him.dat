5|$|After {{falling asleep}} that night, Sam is visited {{in a dream}} by Azazel, who reveals that he has brought them all {{together}} {{so that they can}} fight to the death, with the sole survivor becoming the leader of his army of demons. Admitting that he killed Sam's girlfriend Jessica because he believed she was holding him back from returning to his old life of hunting supernatural creatures, the demon then shows him the night of his mother's death. Azazel had come into Sam's nursery and <b>fed</b> <b>him</b> his blood, with Mary Winchester (Samantha Smith) walking in and recognizing the demon.|$|E
5|$|Bart and Lisa {{begin to}} hear strange noises {{coming from the}} attic. Homer claims not {{to know what they}} are talking about, even though he is seen heading into the attic with a bucket of fish heads. Bart and Lisa investigate, and {{discover}} there really is a monster. Homer and Marge go into the attic, and discover that the creature has escaped, prompting Marge to call Dr. Hibbert. He explains that Bart has a twin brother named Hugo. The two were separated at birth, but it was discovered that Hugo was too evil to live in society, so the Simpsons kept him chained in the attic, where Homer <b>fed</b> <b>him</b> a bucket of fish heads once a week. The rest of the family leaves to find Hugo, leaving Bart behind, but he discovers that Hugo never left the house. Hugo takes Bart to the attic and ties him up, so that he can reattach himself, but Dr. Hibbert bursts in and knocks out Hugo. He then realizes that Hugo's scar is on the wrong side, and Bart is the evil twin. In an attempt to correct their wrong, Dr. Hibbert and the Simpson family sit down to a turkey dinner with Hugo, leaving Bart locked in the attic.|$|E
5|$|In {{only his}} second NHL season, Kennedy {{finished}} the 1944–45 regular season leading {{the team in}} goals and points with 29 goals and 25 assists. In the last {{game of the season}} against the New York Rangers, Kennedy's line-mates <b>fed</b> <b>him</b> pass after pass attempting to get him to 30 goals. The Maple Leafs finished in third place and faceed the Montreal Canadiens in the opening round of the playoffs. The Montreal Canadiens of 1944–45 were a record-breaking, powerhouse hockey team. Going into the playoffs the coach of Montreal, Dick Irvin, declared them as the greatest team to have ever played in the NHL. The Montreal club had the top three point leaders in the league, placed 5 of the 6 positions on the First All-Star team, Maurice Richard had scored his famous 50 goals in 50 games, Montreal had finished 28 points ahead of Toronto and scored almost a goal-per-game more. As of 2009, Montreal's regular season winning percentage for 1944–45 is the fifth highest in NHL history and the year previously they had achieved the second highest in history and won the Stanley Cup. The Leafs were given little chance of winning the series.|$|E

5|$|Magi sacrifices {{herself to}} give the fairies a chance, and she tells Crysta to {{remember}} everything she's learned. Zak manages to stop the machine, depriving Hexxus {{the source of his}} power, but he manifests himself within the oil in the machine and begins to ignite the forest ablaze. Crysta seemingly sacrifices herself by allowing herself to be devoured by Hexxus and all seems lost, until he begins to sprout limbs and leaves like a tree. Pips {{and the rest of the}} fairies rally to the powers they have been given, which causes the seed that Crysta <b>fed</b> <b>him</b> to start growing wildly. Hexxus is imprisoned by the newly grown tree at the very border of FernGully which bursts into bloom. Crysta appears after the fight, having survived her ordeal and successfully succeeded Magi as a magical fairy. She gives Zak a seed, begging him to remember everything that has transpired and she sadly restores him to his human size. Remembering the seed in his hand, Zak promises to remember his adventure, and buries the seed in the soil before telling Tony and Ralph that things need to change as they leave the forest behind. The seed sprouts new growth for FernGully, as Crysta follows Pips with Batty behind her.|$|E

25|$|The children's song Mors lilla Olle by Alice Tegnér {{is set in}} {{the forests}} of Fulufjället. Its story is {{inspired}} by a real event: during the winter of 1850–1851, four children were playing in the forest. One of them, Jon, was just one and a half. They met a bear and its cub. Jon crawled to the bear, who caressed him and <b>fed</b> <b>him</b> berries. When the toddler's mother arrived, she screamed, which made the bears flee. The little boy had thought that the bears were big black dogs.|$|E

25|$|The Tequesta {{gathered}} many plant foods, including {{saw palmetto}} (Serenoa repens) berries, cocoplums (Chrysobalanus icaco), sea grapes (Coccoloba uvifera), prickly pear (nopal) fruits (Opuntia spp.), gopher apples (Licania micbauxii), pigeon plums (Cocoloba diversifolia), palm nuts, false mastic seeds, cabbage palm (Sabal palmetto), and hog plum (Ximenia americana). The roots of certain plants, such as Smilax spp. and coontie (Zamia integrifolia), were edible when ground into flour, processed to remove toxins (in {{the case of}} coontie), and made into a type of unleavened bread. (Archaeologists have commented, however, {{on the lack of}} evidence for coontie use in excavated sites.) Briton Hammond, the sole survivor of an English sloop that was attacked by Tequestas after grounding off Key Biscayne in 1748, reported that the Tequestas <b>fed</b> <b>him</b> boil'd corn.|$|E
25|$|The gangsters drove Kilroy {{through the}} back {{streets of the city}} and past an {{industrial}} area. The number of bars and vendor stands in the street began to thin out as they drove Kilroy through a highway in the city's outskirts. The gangsters then turned to a dirt road that stretched between two corn fields. When they got to the private ranch known as Santa Elena, they left Kilroy inside the car overnight. Shortly after dawn, the ranch's caretaker went to see Kilroy and <b>fed</b> <b>him</b> bread, eggs, and water. About twelve hours after Kilroy was kidnapped, Contanzo and his men came to see him. They wrapped his face and mouth with duct tape and walked him through a field to a storage cabin with his hands still tied around his back.|$|E
25|$|While Charles was in Paris, Marie {{wrote to}} him passionate love letters {{and sent him}} her picture, {{as well as a}} Christmas cake {{in the spirit of the}} season. He ate a piece of it and {{suddenly}} became violently ill soon after. As cholera-like symptoms were common in those days, he did not think about consulting with a physician, but threw the cake away, thinking that it became spoiled in transit. When he returned to Le Glandier, having raised some money, he still felt ill. Marie put him to bed and <b>fed</b> <b>him</b> venison and truffles. Almost immediately, Charles was again afflicted with la maladie parisienne. The family physician, Dr. Bardon, agreed with its cholera-like symptoms and was not suspicious when Marie asked him for a prescription for arsenic, in order to kill the rats that disturbed her husband during the evening.|$|E

25|$|The Penguins won game three, 4–2, {{cutting their}} {{deficit in the}} series in half. Pittsburgh {{got off to a}} strong {{offensive}} start and scored first at 4:48 of the opening period when Evgeni Malkin set up Max Talbot, who fired a one-timed snapshot. Detroit answered less than two minutes later with a Henrik Zetterberg goal at 6:19 in the period. Zetterberg scored on a rebound after Ville Leino's wrap-around attempt was stopped by Marc-Andre Fleury. After Pittsburgh's Brooks Orpik was called for interference, Johan Franzen responding by scoring a goal at 11:33 with under ten seconds left in the penalty. Franzen's score was a one-timer that resulted after Zetterberg <b>fed</b> <b>him</b> a pass around the goal crease. While Detroit dominated the middle of the first period, at one point firing nine straight shots, the Penguins caught a break when the officials missed a penalty for too many men when Pittsburgh had inadvertently created their own powerplay, and played with six men for nearly thirty seconds. Pittsburgh then used a late holding call on Dan Cleary to set up a game tying power play goal. Defenceman Kris Letang fanned on a one-time attempt as he took a pass from Malkin, but regained control of the puck and fired a wrist shot into the net.|$|E
25|$|On the January 4, 2010, live-three-hour, Monday night {{edition of}} Impact! Sting {{returned}} to the Impact! Zone appearing in the rafters of the arena. Sting reappeared two months later on March 8, appearing as {{he was going to}} help a bloodied Hulk Hogan and Abyss during a match {{at the beginning of the}} show against A.J. Styles and Ric Flair. Instead he swung his baseball bat on Hogan and Abyss, turning heel as a result. He was later defeated by the debuting Rob Van Dam. Sting would continuously attack Van Dam with his bat after the match, completing his heel turn by attacking security guards and Hulk Hogan. On the March 22 edition of Impact! Sting was announced as the captain of Team Flair in the annual Lethal Lockdown match, where they would meet Team Hogan, captained by Abyss. At Lockdown Team Flair (Sting, Desmond Wolfe, Robert Roode and James Storm) were defeated by Team Hogan (Abyss, Jeff Jarrett, Rob Van Dam and Jeff Hardy). On May 3, Sting explained his actions to Hogan and was later attacked from behind by Jeff Jarrett. At Sacrifice Sting assaulted Jarrett prior to their match and then dragged him in to the ring, where he managed to score a pinfall in seconds over his bloodied opponent, leaving him injured. On the following edition of Impact! the TNA Championship Committee ranked Sting number one in the rankings and as a result he was granted a shot at Rob Van Dam's World Heavyweight Championship at Slammiversary VIII. Sting then attacked Eric Bischoff with his baseball bat, biting the hand that <b>fed</b> <b>him.</b> Sting later promised that he would reveal the motives behind his actions after winning the World Heavyweight Championship. At Slammiversary VIII Jeff Jarrett made his return and cost Sting his title match against Rob Van Dam.|$|E
25|$|The ardu was a slave, his master's chattel, {{and formed}} a very {{numerous}} class. He could acquire property and even own other slaves. His master clothed and <b>fed</b> <b>him</b> and paid his doctor's fees, but took all compensation paid for injury done to him. His master usually found him a slave girl for a wife (the children were then born slaves), often set him up in a house (with farm or business) and simply took an annual rent of him. Otherwise, he might marry a free woman (the children were then free), who might bring him a dower that his master could not touch, and at his death, one-half of his property passed to his master as his heir. He could acquire his freedom by purchase from his master, or might be freed and dedicated to a temple, or even adopted, when he became an amelu and not a mushkenu. Slaves were recruited by purchase abroad, from captives taken in war, or by freemen degraded for debt or crime. A slave often ran away; if caught, the captor was bound to restore him to his master, and the Code fixes a reward of two shekels that the owner must pay the captor. It was about one-tenth of the average value of a slave. To detain or harbour a slave was punishable by death. So was aiding him to escape the city gates. A slave bore an identification mark, removable only by a surgical operation, that later consisted of his owner's name tattooed or branded on the arm. On the other hand, on the great estates in Assyria and its subject provinces there were many serfs, mostly of subject race, settled captives, or quondam slaves; tied to the soil they cultivated and sold with the estate, yet capable of possessing land and property of their own. There is little trace of serfs in Babylonia, unless the mushkenu is really a serf.|$|E
