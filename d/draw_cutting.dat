50|$|Florida's defense {{continued}} to stifle Georgia throughout the second half, {{until late in}} the third quarter. After a Chris Leak interception, true freshman quarterback Matthew Stafford led the Bulldogs to a touchdown which he capped off on a 13-yard touchdown run off a quarterback <b>draw,</b> <b>cutting</b> the deficit to fourteen points. Florida's offense was stuffed on the following drive but got a muffed punt by Georgia to regain the ball. However, Florida was unable to capitalize on the turnover, as Chris Hetland again missed a field goal. Georgia was unable to score on the following drive, but freshman Tim Tebow fumbled on Florida's 10-yard line to give Georgia a shot at drawing within seven points. On third down from the 5-yard line, running back Kregg Lumpkin took a draw play and fought his way for a Georgia touchdown to bring the Bulldogs to within seven points. The Gators and the Bulldogs traded possessions, with the Gators getting the ball back with a little over three minutes in the game. Florida needed a first down on third and five to seal their victory and elected to give Andre Caldwell a carry off a reverse. The play was stopped well short, but Georgia was called for a controversial face mask penalty which gave Florida a first down. Running back DeShawn Wynn, who saw limited action in the game, was able to pick up another first down to seal Florida's seventh win of the season. The Gators have now won fifteen of the last eighteen against their hated rivals from Georgia. The win also moved the Gators into fourth place in the BCS rankings.|$|E

To increase {{the quality of}} the product and minimize the cost of process, we should know the physical phenomena which exist during the process. The phenomena on a typical incremental step were described using a step-by-step incremental procedure, with an updated Lagrange's formulation. The technological processes are considered as geometrical and physical non-linear initial and boundary problems. The finite element method (FEM) and the dynamic explicit method (DEM) were used to obtain the solution. The application was developed in the ANSYS/LS-DYNA system, which makes possible a complex time analysis of the physical phenomena: states of displacements, strains and stresses. Numerical computations of the strain and stress have been conducted with the use of methodology which requires a proper definition of the contact zone, without the necessity to introduce boundary conditions.

40|$|The {{improvement}} of wear and adhesion resistance {{is an important}} requirement for a cost-efficient forming process of high strength sheet materials made of steel or non-iron metal alloys by deep <b>drawing</b> and <b>cutting.</b> As forming tools are exposed to complex stress, specific material-concepts are required. High hardness of the rim, which is combined with a low friction coefficient and a tough core are important for deep <b>drawing</b> and <b>cutting</b> tools to withstand high stresses without crack or adhesion. Wear resistant rims made of hard materials and ceramics modified by gas boronizing or ion implantation were characterised by tribological and topological methods. Gas phase boronized hard metals and ion implanted hard metals and ceramics are wear resistant under conditions of mixed friction in contact with austenitic steel. To avoid adhesion during forming of aluminium, the tool surfaces should be protected by carbon layers. © TEMA</a...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{cholinergic}} neurotransmission {{within the}} human mesenteric lymphatic vessels has been poorly studied. Therefore, our {{aim is to}} analyse the cholinergic nerve fibres of lymphatic vessels using the traditional enzymatic techniques of staining, plus the biochemical modifications of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Specimens obtained from human mesenteric lymphatic vessels were subjected to the following experimental procedures: 1) <b>drawing,</b> <b>cutting</b> and staining of tissues; 2) staining of total nerve fibres; 3) enzymatic staining of cholinergic nerve fibres; 4) homogenisation of tissues; 5) biochemical amount of proteins; 6) biochemical amount of AChE activity; 6) quantitative analysis of images; 7) statistical analysis of data. RESULTS: The mesenteric lymphatic vessels show many AChE positive nerve fibres around their wall with an almost plexiform distribution. The incubation time was performed at 1 h (partial activity) and 6 h (total activity). Moreover, biochemical dosage of the same enzymatic activity confirms the results obtained with morphological methods. CONCLUSIONS: The homogenates of the studied tissues contain strong AChE activity. In our study, the lymphatic vessels appeared to contain few cholinergic nerve fibres. Therefore, {{it is expected that}} perivascular nerve stimulation stimulates cholinergic nerves innervating the mesenteric arteries to release the neurotransmitter AChE, which activates muscarinic or nicotinic receptors to modulate adrenergic neurotransmission. These results strongly suggest, that perivascular cholinergic nerves have little or no effect on the adrenergic nerve function in mesenteric arteries. The cholinergic nerves innervating mesenteric arteries do not mediate direct vascular responses...|$|R
