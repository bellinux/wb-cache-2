5|$|Stela 114 {{dates to}} AD 435, in the Early Classic. It was moved in antiquity to be reset <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> of Structure 2. The stela {{has a long}} hieroglyphic text that has {{resisted}} translation but probably commemorates a royal enthronement in 411.|$|E
5|$|The {{main base}} was then {{subjected}} to an intense mortar and rocket barrage. Hundreds of mortar rounds and 122mm rockets slammed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>base,</b> leveling {{most of the}} above-ground structures. One of the first enemy shells set off {{an explosion in the}} main ammunition dump. Many of the artillery and mortar rounds stored in the dump were thrown into the air and detonated on impact within the base. Soon after another shell hit a cache of tear gas, which saturated the entire area. Hours after the bombardment ceased, the base was still in danger. At around 10:00, the fire ignited a large quantity of C-4 and other explosives, rocking the base with another series of detonations.|$|E
5|$|English castles, {{including}} Kenilworth, did {{not play}} a decisive role during the Wars of the Roses (1455–85), which were fought primarily {{in the form of}} pitched battles between the rival factions of the Lancastrians and the Yorkists. With the mental collapse of King Henry VI, Queen Margaret used the Duchy of Lancaster lands in the Midlands, including Kenilworth, as one of her key bases of military support. Margaret removed Henry from London in 1456 for his own safety and until 1461, Henry's court divided almost all its time among Kenilworth, Leicester and Tutbury Castle for the purposes of protection. Kenilworth remained an important Lancastrian stronghold {{for the rest of the}} war, often acting as a military balance to the nearby castle of Warwick. With the victory of Henry VII at Bosworth, Kenilworth again received royal attention; Henry visited frequently and had a tennis court constructed at the castle for his use. His son, Henry VIII, decided that Kenilworth should be maintained as a royal castle. He abandoned the Pleasance and had part of the timber construction moved <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> court of the castle.|$|E

5|$|If {{the player}} follows Gail, they go after an unknown man, but end up losing him. Rick then tells Regina that Tom's dead. If the player follows Rick, they come across Tom, badly injured and near death. Rick takes {{him to the}} medical room, however a Velociraptor attacks them, but Tom sacrifices himself to kill it and save Rick. Later, Regina and the team manage to locate Kirk and {{apprehend}} him. As they are preparing to leave via helicopter, the T. rex returns and destroys the helicopter, forcing them to flee back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> while Kirk manages to escape. Regina and Rick flee into the facility and locate keys to a watercraft, but find a vortex {{in the way of}} getting to it. Rick speculates this is the spacetime distortion that brought the dinosaurs back. The two split up to find an alternate route off the island, and Regina ends up being held at gunpoint by Dr. Kirk. He is about to kill her when the gun is shot out of his hand by Gail, and they arrest him again.|$|E
5|$|The frigate Africaine {{had been}} sent from Rochefort early in 1801 with more than 400 {{soldiers}} for the Egyptian garrison, and by February had reached the Mediterranean Sea, Commodore Saulnier seeking to pass along the North African coast to avoid patrolling Royal Navy warships. On the afternoon of 19 February however the overladen French warship was discovered by the British HMS Phoebe and rapidly chased down and brought to action. In an engagement lasting two hours, the French ship {{was reduced to a}} wallowing wreck as broadsides from Phoebe tore through the hull, rigging and the soldiers packed on the decks: by the time Africaine surrendered, 200 men were dead and another 143 wounded. The captured ship was brought <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> at Port Mahon in Menorca and subsequently served in the Royal Navy.|$|E
5|$|The two tiered mosque has a {{rectangular}} plan. The Ottoman prayer hall faces towards the south. It has a flat paved roof topped with 27 sliding domes on square bases. Holes pierced <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> of each dome illuminate the interior. The roof {{is also used}} for prayer during peak times, when the domes slide out on metal tracks to shade areas of the roof, creating light wells for the prayer hall. At these times, {{the courtyard of the}} Ottoman mosque is also shaded with umbrellas affixed to freestanding columns. The roof is accessed by stairs and escalators. The paved area around the mosque is also used for prayer, equipped with umbrella tents. Sliding Domes and retractable umbrella-like canopies are designed by the German architect Mahmoud Bodo Rasch and his firm SL Rasch GmbH and Buro Happold.|$|E

5|$|Indonesian {{artillery}} fire continued to rain {{down on the}} camp, wounding several men and sending the defenders into disarray. Sergeant-Major Williams rushed to the headquarters to order the artillery officer to bombard the taken positions before attempting to organise a counterattack himself. Whilst under heavy Indonesian fire, Williams gathered a section of defenders who had taken refuge in a slit trench and led them towards the captured outer positions. A shell landed among the group and wounded half of them, but Williams and the remainder engaged at least thirty Indonesian infantry who had been firing <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> from the trench in vicious hand-to-hand combat and managed to push them from it with minor casualties. Williams them looked to secure the perimeter, but seeing that the Indonesians were massing for a second attack, {{he sat down in}} a vacated machine gun nest and sprayed the new wave of attackers, who attempted to seize the command bunker, with fire. This was not without cost, and Williams was fortunate to have escaped with a single head wound, which nevertheless blinded him in one eye, though he did not notice this in the heat of battle. Williams then began to receive supporting rifle fire from other British troops in nearby trenches, as well bombardment from the single remaining mortar and some 105mm artillery emplacements from a nearby camp.|$|E
5|$|Magpies {{have a long}} {{breeding}} season which varies {{in different parts of}} the country; in northern parts of Australia they will breed between June and September, but not commence until August or September in cooler regions, and may continue until January in some alpine areas. The nest is a bowl-shaped structure made of sticks and lined with softer material such as grass and bark. Near human habitation, synthetic material may be incorporated. Nests are built exclusively by females and generally placed high up in a tree fork, often in an exposed position. The trees used are most commonly eucalypts, although a variety of other native trees as well as introduced pine, Crataegus, and elm have been recorded. Other bird species, such as the yellow-rumped thornbill (Acanthiza chrysorrhoa), willie wagtail (Rhipidura leucophrys), southern whiteface (Aphelocephala leucopsis), and (less commonly) noisy miner (Manorina melanocephala), often nest in the same tree as the magpie. The first two species may even locate their nest directly beneath a magpie nest, while the diminutive striated pardalote (Pardalotus striatus) has been known to make a burrow for breeding <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> of the magpie nest itself. These incursions are all tolerated by the magpies. The channel-billed cuckoo (Scythrops novaehollandiae) is a notable brood parasite in eastern Australia; magpies will raise cuckoo young, which eventually outcompete the magpie nestlings.|$|E
5|$|Methods of euthanizing {{laboratory}} {{animals are}} chosen to induce rapid unconsciousness and death without pain or distress. The methods that are preferred are those published by councils of veterinarians. The animal {{can be made}} to inhale a gas, such as carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, by being placed in a chamber, or by use of a face mask, with or without prior sedation or anesthesia. Sedatives or anesthetics such as barbiturates can be given intravenously, or inhalant anesthetics may be used. Amphibians and fish may be immersed in water containing an anesthetic such as tricaine. Physical methods are also used, with or without sedation or anesthesia depending on the method. Recommended methods include decapitation (beheading) for small rodents or rabbits. Cervical dislocation (breaking the neck or spine) may be used for birds, mice, and immature rats and rabbits. Maceration (grinding into small pieces) is used on 1 day old chicks. High-intensity microwave irradiation of the brain can preserve brain tissue and induce death in less than 1 second, but this is currently only used on rodents. Captive bolts may be used, typically on dogs, ruminants, horses, pigs and rabbits. It causes death by a concussion to the brain. Gunshot may be used, but only in cases where a penetrating captive bolt may not be used. Some physical methods are only acceptable after the animal is unconscious. Electrocution may be used for cattle, sheep, swine, foxes, and mink after the animals are unconscious, often by a prior electrical stun. Pithing (inserting a tool <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> of the brain) is usable on animals already unconscious. Slow or rapid freezing, or inducing air embolism are acceptable only with prior anesthesia to induce unconsciousness.|$|E

The species of Cerambycidae and Syrphidae often stayed on an inflorescence for about 1  min, when crawling and stretching their mouthparts <b>into</b> <b>the</b> flower <b>base</b> for foraging nectar. In contrast, the insects of Vespidae and Apidae usually flew around the inflorescence, and only stayed briefly to stretch their mouthparts <b>into</b> <b>the</b> flower <b>base</b> for foraging nectar, and then quickly flew to another inflorescence.|$|R
50|$|The tendon of the tibialis {{posterior}} muscle (sometimes {{called the}} posterior tibial tendon) descends posterior to the medial malleolus and terminates by dividing into plantar, main, and recurrent components. The plantar portion inserts <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bases</b> of <b>the</b> second, {{third and fourth}} metatarsals, the intermediate and lateral cuneiforms and the cuboid. The main portion inserts <b>into</b> <b>the</b> tuberosity of the navicular and the plantar surface of the medial cuneiform.

5|$|The Spanish party {{retreated from}} the lake shore and regrouped on open ground where they were {{surrounded}} by about 2,000 Itza warriors who attempted to disarm them; the Itzas managed to seize another Spaniard and immediately struck off his head. At this point about 10,000 Itza archers appeared from canoes concealed among the lakeside mangroves, and Zubiaur ordered his men to fire a volley that killed between 30 and 40 Itzas. Realising that they were hopelessly outnumbered, the Spanish retreated towards Chuntuki, abandoning their captured companions to their fate. A Christian Maya musketeer and six other Indians fled {{at the start of}} the battle and took news to García that the entire expedition had been slaughtered; Zubiaur and the survivors of his expedition marched back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>base</b> camp at Chuntuki two days later. Ursúa later reported that the Spanish prisoners were taken back to Nojpetén where they were all killed; this was also confirmed by AjChan at a later date. The bones of the dead were said to have been found by the Spanish after the final assault on Nojpetén in 1697; AjK'in Kan Ek', the Itza high priest, later reported that he had bound San Buenaventura and his companion into cross shapes and cut out their hearts.|$|E
