5|$|Independence {{talks between}} Britain and Rhodesia {{continued}} for a fortnight without major {{reference to the}} Reedman appointment, with Britain more concerned with discussing a possible Rhodesian unilateral declaration of independence (UDI). Smith delivered an openly defiant speech to his parliament on 30 June, attacking Britain for its handling of the Commonwealth's newer members, which he said were unduly influencing British policy in Africa. Britain was desperate to avoid the international humiliation that would accompany the organisation's break-up, he claimed, and was therefore attempting to <b>hold</b> <b>it</b> <b>together</b> by appeasing the less prominent members. While making clear his disdain, the Prime Minister pledged {{to go on with}} negotiations, saying that he did not believe Britain truly endorsed its professed line.|$|E
5|$|When airways are damaged, air {{can escape}} {{from them and}} be trapped in the {{surrounding}} tissues in the neck (subcutaneous emphysema) and mediastinum (pneumomediastinum); if it builds up to high enough pressures there, it can compress the airways. Massive air leaks from a ruptured airway can also compromise the circulation by preventing blood from returning to the heart from the head and lower body; this causes a potentially deadly reduction {{in the amount of}} blood the heart is able to pump out. Blood and other fluids can build up in the airways, and the injury can interfere with the patency of the airway and interfere with its continuity. However, even if the trachea is completely transected, the tissues surrounding it may <b>hold</b> <b>it</b> <b>together</b> enough for adequate air exchange to occur, at least at first.|$|E
5|$|Byzantium looked {{impressive}} when Manuel died in 1180, {{having just}} celebrated the betrothal {{of his son}} Alexios II to {{the daughter of the}} king of France. Thanks to the diplomacy and campaigning of Alexios, John, and Manuel, the empire was a great power, economically prosperous, and secure on its frontiers; but there were serious problems as well. Internally, the Byzantine court required a strong leader to <b>hold</b> <b>it</b> <b>together,</b> and after Manuel's death stability was seriously endangered from within. Some of the foreign enemies of the Empire were lurking on the flanks, waiting for a chance to attack, in particular the Turks in Anatolia, whom Manuel had ultimately failed to defeat, and the Normans in Sicily, who had already tried but failed to invade the Empire on several occasions. Even the Venetians, the single most important western ally of Byzantium, were on bad terms with the empire at Manuel's death in 1180. Given this situation, it would have taken a strong Emperor to secure the Empire against the foreign threats it now faced, and to rebuild the depleted Imperial Treasury. But Manuel's son was a minor, and his unpopular regency government was overthrown in a violent coup d'état. This troubled succession weakened the dynastic continuity and solidarity on which the strength of the Byzantine state had come to rely.|$|E

25|$|While the {{caliphate}} {{continued its}} rapid expansion, Umar laid {{the foundations of}} a political structure that could <b>hold</b> <b>it</b> <b>together.</b> He created the Diwan, a bureau for transacting government affairs. The military was brought directly under state control and into its pay. Crucially, in conquered lands, Umar did not require that non-Muslim populations convert to Islam, nor did he try to centralize government. Instead, he allowed subject populations to retain their religion, language and customs, and he left their government relatively untouched, imposing only a governor (amir) and a financial officer called an amil. These new posts were integral to the efficient network of taxation that financed the empire.|$|E
500|$|By {{inserting}} her authorial {{voice in}} the tale's epilogue, Potter reveals her uncertainty about the believability of her fantasy, and her uncertainty mars the narrative line which, Kutzer remarks, is analogous to a [...] "comedy sketch that should have stayed at joke length, but is unwisely stretched into ten minutes of tepid comedy." [...] The notion of having animals shed their skins for laundering provides opportunities for amusing illustrations, but the tale {{does not have a}} strong narrative line to <b>hold</b> <b>it</b> <b>together</b> or to grip the reader's attention. The tale is held together solely by the quaint language and work of the charming central character.|$|E

He said that public interest in the singer's lifestyle did not make her lifestyle newsworthy. Rod McKenzie, editor of the BBC Radio One programme Newsbeat, replied: [...] "If you play [...] music to a certain demographic, those same {{people want to know}} what's happening in her private life. If you don't cover it, you're insulting young licence fee payers." [...] In The Scotsman, British singer and songwriter Lily Allen was quoted to have said – [...] "I know Amy Winehouse very well. And she is very different to what people portray her as being. Yes, she does get out of her mind on drugs sometimes, but she is also a very clever, intelligent, witty, funny person who can <b>hold</b> <b>it</b> <b>together.</b> You just don't see that side." ...|$|E

500|$|The process {{used by the}} {{character}} Watney to produce water was accurate and is being used by NASA for a planned Martian rover. The radioisotope thermoelectric generator was also appropriately used for heat. When his rations begin to run low, Watney builds an improvised garden using Martian soil and the crew's feces as a fertilizer. [...] "We could probably grow something on Mars", said Michael Shara, curator, Department of Astrophysics, Division of Physical Sciences at the American Museum of Natural History.

500|$|Chrissie {{entered the}} show as the estranged wife of [...] "one of the most iconic {{characters}} in soap history", Den Watts, and was deliberately presented as [...] "very different to the first Mrs. Watts." [...] When EastEnders began in 1985 viewers had watched Den's affairs and manipulation gradually take their toll on his wife, Angie, who was unable {{to compete in the}} games he played. Chrissie was intended to be a contrast to her predecessor; where Angie turned to alcohol, Chrissie was more Den's [...] "equal" [...] and could be just as devious and calculating, with Oberman observing how [...] "Angie was all knee-jerk reaction, but Chrissie is more of a plotter and schemer – just like Den." [...] Comparing Den's two wives, Oberman remarked: [...] "Chrissie's much cooler than Angie. Her motto is, 'revenge is a dish best served cold'. She's tougher than Angie and she can <b>hold</b> <b>it</b> <b>together</b> much better." [...] Indeed, according to Oberman, producers deliberately wanted to take Den's second marriage down a different path to his first; whereas the relationship between Den and Angie had been likened to Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor, that between Den and Chrissie was modelled on Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn. Like Den, Chrissie had an acerbic tongue and their relationship was marked by verbal fencing in the manner of Hepburn and Tracy: [...] "What's great is that they've written Den an equal", Oberman noted, [...] "It'll be interesting to see their little sparring matches." [...] The attraction was intended to be mutual, unlike Den's one-sided marriage to Angie. Trying to win Chrissie around into giving their marriage another try, Den declared: [...] "I know we've got a great relationship even when we're tearing lumps out of each other, you give as good as you get and that's the sort of marriage I've always wanted".

500|$|The novel's first 100 pages {{deal with}} the bridge's {{construction}} and the remaining 200 revolve around the Austro-Hungarian period. Andrić himself characterized The Bridge on the Drina as a chronicle rather than a novel. In the introduction to his English-language translation, Edwards also declined to classify it as a novel, for [...] "its scope is too vast, its characters too numerous, its period of action too long." [...] Literary scholar Annabel Patterson writes: [...] "There is no hero or heroine to <b>hold</b> <b>it</b> <b>together,</b> nor even a family or dynasty. In place of these there is the bridge, whose birth we attend, whose stability we come to count on." [...] Patterson hesitates to characterize The Bridge on the Drina as a historical novel {{because most of the}} events described in it actually occurred as opposed to having been fictionalized. She notes that other scholars have classified it as a [...] "non-fiction novel", a term she considers superfluous. [...] "If we wish for simplicity," [...] she writes, [...] "we can call The Bridge on the Drina a novel to distinguish it from Andrić's collections of short stories. But if we wish for precision, The Bridge on the Drina can best be classified as {{a collection of short stories}} of peasant life held together by a bridge." [...] The book deviates from other texts that have been described as chronicles in that the narrator observes events itinerantly and retrospectively. The style of storytelling Andrić employs is often likened to a transcendent historical monologue. Literary scholar Guido Snel believes that such a stylistic interpretation neglects the novel's dialogic properties and its ability to act as a back-and-forth between the narrator and reader, drawing a connection between the past described in the novel and the reader's present. This has caused Serb scholars to uphold Andrić's narrative authority, Snel writes, and Muslim scholars to challenge and reject it.|$|E

2500|$|A {{butt joint}} is a {{technique}} in which two pieces of wood [...] are joined by simply placing their ends together without any special shaping. The name 'butt joint' comes {{from the way the}} wood is joint together.

It is also the weakest because unless some form of reinforcement is used (see below) it relies upon glue alone to <b>hold</b> <b>it</b> <b>together.</b> Because the orientation of the wood usually presents only one end to long grain gluing surface, the resulting joint is inherently weak.|$|E

2500|$|First noticed as {{something}} unusual in {{images of the}} center of the Milky Way in 2002, the gas cloud G2, which has a mass about three times that of Earth, was confirmed to be likely on a course taking it into the accretion zone of Sgr A* in a paper published in Nature in 2012. Predictions of its orbit suggested it would make its closest approach to the black hole (a perinigricon) in early 2014, when the cloud was at a distance of just over 3000 times the radius of the event horizon (or ≈260 AU, 36 light-hours) from the black hole. G2 has been observed to be disrupting since 2009, and was predicted by some to be completely destroyed by the encounter, which could have led to a significant brightening of X-ray and other emission from the black hole. Other astronomers suggested the gas cloud could be hiding a dim star, or a binary star merger product, which would <b>hold</b> <b>it</b> <b>together</b> against the tidal forces of Sgr A*, allowing the ensemble to pass by without any effect. [...] In addition to the tidal effects on the cloud itself, it was proposed in May 2013 that, prior to its perinigricon, G2 might experience multiple close encounters with members of the black-hole and neutron-star populations thought to orbit near the Galactic Center, offering some insight into the region surrounding the supermassive black hole {{at the center of the}} Milky Way.|$|E

Essentially it is an adventure of the British spirit, sanguine, discursive, and beyond comparison insubordinate, adaptable, and originating. It has been made by odd and irregular means by trading companies, pioneers, explorers, unauthorised seamen, adventurers like Clive, eccentrics like Gordon, invalids like Rhodes. It has been made, in spite of authority and officialdom, as no other empire was ever made. The nominal rulers of Britain never planned it. It happened almost in spite of them. Their chief contribution to its history has been the loss of the United States. It is a living thing that has arisen, not a dead thing put together. Beneath the thin legal and administrative ties that <b>hold</b> <b>it</b> <b>together</b> lies the far more vital bond of a traditional free spontaneous activity. It has a common medium of expression in the English tongue, a unity of liberal and tolerant purpose amidst its enormous variety of localised life and colour.
