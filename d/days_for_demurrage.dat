50|$|In business, {{demurrage}} is a {{delay in}} delivery of a product via delivery truck. When a delay occurs with product delivery, the delivery party can elect to claim a no fault delay by submitting a <b>demurrage</b> charge. Criteria <b>for</b> allowable <b>demurrage,</b> payment conditions, and payment terms <b>for</b> <b>demurrage</b> are typically prenegotiated and accepted by the vendor via contract prior to conduct of business. Some vendors allow free no-cost time for limited hour(s) when demurrage occurs, others do not allow free time <b>for</b> delays. The <b>demurrage</b> charge is normally an hourly rate. Unforeseeable until delivery, costs of delays are sometimes separately invoiced from the cost of deliverable.|$|R

50|$|The {{bill of lading}} {{sometimes}} {{contains a}} clause as to the shipowner's lien. Without any express provision for it, the shipowner has by common law a lien for freight. If it is desired to give the shipowner a lien <b>for</b> <b>demurrage</b> or other charges, it must be expressly provided for. The lien is {{the right of the}} shipowner to retain the goods carried until paid the freight charges, demurrage, or other charge for which a lien has been given. The lien may be waived, and ends with delivery of the goods, or by any dealing with the consignee inconsistent with a right of the shipowner to retain possession of the goods until payment has been made. The shipowner may preserve his lien by landing the goods and retaining them in his own warehouse, or by storing them in a public warehouse, subject to the conditions required by the Merchant Shipping Act (1894).|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{enhancing}} the performance utilization of locos by uncovering the non-value adding activities in raw material unloading yard (RMUY) {{of an integrated}} steel plant. JSW Steel Ltd, Vijayanagar works is the India’s first 10 MTPA steel plant at single location, “the fastest growing steel plant in India”. The capacity expansion of steel industry involves expansion of the production capacity {{at different stages of}} steel making like Raw material handling system, Treatment plants, Iron making, Steel making, Casting, & Rolling mills. At present Cold Rolling Mill- 2 and Steel Making Shop- 3 are going to be commissioned shortly. Hence with the expansion of the steel plant, the demand for raw materi-als will increase which will increase the number of inbound rakes arriving at RMUY. The increase in number of rakes arriving at RMUY causes congestion at the tracks causing bottlenecks for the unloading facilities and limits the rake movements within RMUY. The external railway agency providing the rail service, charges <b>for</b> <b>demurrage</b> (delay in return of rakes beyond 8 hr of free unloading time). Thus such bottlenecks not only adversely affect the unloading capabilities of the yard, but also increase the demurrage costs. Using Work Measurement Technique, 24 hr Time study has been conducted in raw material unloading yard of JSW Steel Ltd, to estimate the existing utilization of nine locos simultaneously three shifts per day. Process chart is drawn to identify the separate steps or events that occur during a series of actionscarried out by loco in RMUY and activity chart is draw...|$|R

50|$|Some clauses {{specify the}} amount of freight to pay and the manner and time of payment. A clause may specify the length of time, usually {{described}} as lay <b>days,</b> <b>for</b> loading and discharging, and <b>for</b> the <b>demurrage</b> to pay if the vessel is detained beyond the lay days. There is usually also a clause that requires that the merchant bear the risk and expense to bring the cargo to the ship and collect it on delivery. Another clause specifies that the master must sign bills of lading for the cargo, either {{at the same rate}} payable under the charter-party, or commonly at any rate of freight (with a stipulation that, if the total bill of lading freight is less than the total freight payable under the charter-party, the charterers pay the difference to the master before the vessel sails). There is usually what is called the cesser clause, by which the charterer's liability under the charter-party ceases on shipment of the cargo, the shipowner taking a lien on the cargo for freight, dead freight, and demurrage. The charter-party is subject to exceptions similar to those in bills of lading. Typically, other clauses provide for commissions paid to the brokers on signing the charter-party, the address commission paid to the agents for the Vessel at the port of discharge, and other details. Clauses in charter-parties vary, but the above outlines what is typical.|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{measure and}} compare the {{duration}} of action of abobotulinumtoxinA and onabotulinumtoxinA. Design: Randomized, double-blind, contralateral (split-face) study. Setting: Two United States clinical sites. Participants: Twenty subjects with severe frontalis lines at maximum elevation. Measurements: Subjects randomly received equal volumes of abobotulinumtoxinA or onabotulinumtoxinA (0. 2 mL) in five injection points on contralateral sides of the frontalis (N= 40) using a dose ratio of 2. 5 : 1. 0 (total 25 U abobotulinumtoxinA: 10 U onabotulinumtoxinA), respectively. Subjects were evaluated using a 4 -point Frontalis Rating Scale and a new objective Frontalis Activity Measurement Standard <b>for</b> 210 <b>days</b> using predefined endpoints for efficacy. Results: Using the Frontalis Activity Measurement Standard, the median duration of “complete efficacy” was 72 <b>days</b> <b>for</b> abobotulinumtoxinA and 56 <b>days</b> <b>for</b> onabotulinumtoxinA (p= 0. 01), “full efficacy” was 103 <b>days</b> <b>for</b> abobotulinumtoxinA and 87 <b>days</b> <b>for</b> onabotulinumtoxinA (p< 0. 003), and “partial efficacy” was 105 <b>days</b> <b>for</b> abobotulinumtoxinA and 99 <b>days</b> <b>for</b> onabotulinumtoxinA (p= 0. 006). Using the Frontalis Rating Scale, the median duration of “complete efficacy” was 63 <b>days</b> <b>for</b> abobotulinumtoxinA and 44 <b>days</b> <b>for</b> onabotulinumtoxinA (p= 0. 006), “full efficacy” was 119 <b>days</b> <b>for</b> abobotulinumtoxinA and 77 <b>days</b> <b>for</b> onabotulinumtoxinA (p= 0. 005), and “partial efficacy” was 160 <b>days</b> <b>for</b> abobotulinumtoxinA and 145 <b>days</b> <b>for</b> onabotulinumtoxinA (p=NS). Adverse events included local bruising and occasional headache, but no significant inter-group differences. Conclusion: The contralateral Frontalis Activity Measurement Standard is well-suited for assessing the pharmacodynamic and clinical attributes of botulinum toxin type A {{and can be used}} to measure differences in the clinical properties of abobotulinumtoxinA and onabotulinumtoxinA. Using a dose ratio of 2. 5 : 1. 0, abobotulinumtoxinA displayed significantly longer duration of action than onabotulinumtoxinA...|$|R
