40|$|Title: 'The Mode of Extemporization' The Role of Informality in Reconstituting Formal Urban Spaces: The Case of Nakuru, Kenya Researcher: Lawrence Esho, Promoted by: Prof. Han Verschure, Prof. Jef Van Den Broeck Amongst {{the many}} {{challenges}} of urbanization, {{the phenomenon of}} informali ty is today {{perhaps one of the}} most enduring realities confronting citie s in developing contexts. It is therefore unsurprising that its purporte d discovery in the early 1970 s aroused a zealous institutional and sch olarly interest, the objects being to elucidate its nature, explicate fa ctors responsible for its emergence and propagation and deliberate its i mplications for development policy. Consequently, the emergent discourse depicts the phenomenon as a corollary of complex and highly contradicto ry processes involving the articulation and colligation of historical, c ultural, political, socio-economic forces and spatial conditions. The de bate is elaborate, but only in respect of the socio-economic dimension o f informality. It however, remains vague on spatial aspects, and in spit e of there being consensus on the impacts of informal activities and app ropriative spatial practices on processes of contemporary urban morphoge nesis, much overemphasis is placed on the formers alleged degrading imp ort on urban spatial structures. This study queries the plausibility of such a stance, particularly in view of the fact that the real essence of such practices is yet to be determined in this regard. Additionally, th ere is as yet, no compelling account relating the informal dynamic to th e spatial frame of cities. Specifically, the possible agency of spatial- structural-institutional aspects of urbanity in the emergence and propag ation of informal urbanities is a subject that has remained largely unex plored. Consequently, the ensuing inquiry seeks to reorient the current debate on informality away from the international development and local macro and micro/socio-economic focus by exploring the theme within the m ore specific and substantive area of space theory and spatial planning. By critically exploring the interface between informality, urban space a nd spatial planning practice, the study not only seeks to foster underst anding on the subject in general, but more specifically, to explicate th e urban space allocation/appropriation mismatch that characterizes spati al scenes in Sub-Saharan African urban context. The exploration begins by revisiting the century-old history of urbaniza tion in Africa. Here, in addition to shedding light on historical underp innings of salient aspects of African urbanization and urbanity, it trac es the emergence of informality as a distinct residential, professional/ occupational, and social urban category to the advent in the continent, of western capitalism and modern urbanization. Likewise, it implicates e xclusionary planning principles and spatial frames introduced in the col onial era, and further perpetuated by urban managers and planners in the post-colonial era, in the propagation of informal space appropriation p ractices in the African city. This proposition is further explored throu gh a specific urban case, the city of Nakuru in Kenya. Here, an explorat ory analysis in respect of existing spatial patterns of appropriation co nfirms a positive correlation between spatial structure and the emergent pattern of localization. The relationship is not only symbiotic but dia lectical, meaning that whereas the urban anchorage of informal practices depends to a large extent on the urban underlayments structural proper ties, the former exerts a reconstitutive influence in relation to the la tter. This suggests that informal practices, even while promoting a mode of appropriation that seemingly borders on the eclectic, nevertheless p artially submit to the regimented command of contrived spatial structure s (i. e., the formal urban spatial grid). However, while so doing, they i nstigate a process of adapting these formal structures to their unique a ppropriative disposition in relation to space. These, as well as the stu dys other insights are of significant import, particularly as they chal lenge claims of aberrancy and degeneracy attributed to informal practice s and associated spatial patterns of appropriation. The two perspectives have long underpinned the ambivalent and sometimes inimical relationshi p between actuators of the informal dynamic and the formal planning and plan enforcement regimes. Most significantly, the findings underscore th e inevitability of a planning paradigm shift in relation to the phenomen on of informality. Subsequently, the dissertation advocates not only for approaches that recognize informally as a durable element of Africa urb anity, but which also endeavour to employ the synergy inherent in the fo rmal/informal dynamic to frame structures that will more readily effectu ate a harmonious, equitable, and sustainable urban development.

In the arm-chair sat the broad-faced genial man who had called on Henchard on a memorable morning between one and two years before this time, and whom the latter had seen mount the coach and depart within half-an-hour of his arrival. It was Richard Newson. The meeting with the light-hearted father from whom she had been {{separated}} half-a-dozen years, as if by death, need hardly be detailed. It was an affecting one, apart from the question of paternity. Henchard's departure was in a moment explained. When the true facts came to be handled the difficulty of restoring her to her old belief in Newson was not so great as might have seemed likely, for Henchard's conduct itself was a proof that those facts were true. Moreover, she had grown up under Newson's paternal care; and even had Henchard been her father in nature, this father in early <b>domiciliation</b> might almost have carried the point against him, when the incidents of her parting with Henchard had a little worn off.|$|E
60|$|He {{had always}} fancied that {{his later years}} should {{be a time of}} repose in the faiths, loves, and joys through which he {{realized}} himself. But nothing apparently was farther from the fact. Such length of thoughts as he had, such abiding pleasures, such persistent hopes, were from his youth; and the later sort were as the leaves of the tree to the tree itself. He put them forth at the beginning of an epoch, a season, and they dropped from him at the close. In as great bitterness as is consonant with his temperament he has asked us why youth should ever have been deemed fickle and age constant when so precisely the contrary is true. Youth, he owns, is indeed full of vain endeavors and of enterprises that come to nothing, but it is far more fixed than age in its aspirations. His aspirations change now with such rapidity that they seem different not only from year to year, but from month to month, from day to day. He has not merely discarded his old ideals, he loathes them. He used to like going out to dinner, above all things; and he was fond of lunches, even of afternoon teas; but in a day, in an hour, such delights became wearinesses and vexations of spirit. Formerly he enjoyed travel with all its necessary concomitants. It amused him to check his baggage and depart from stations, to arrive at hotels and settle himself in new rooms; the very <b>domiciliation</b> in sleeping-cars or the domestication in diners had a charm which was apparently perennial; a trip in a river-boat was rapture; an ocean voyage was ecstasy. The succession of strange faces, new minds, was an unfailing interest, and there was no occurrence, in or out of the ordinary, which did not give him release from self and form a true recreation. The theatre does not amuse him now, though the time has been, and lately, for the curtain, when it rose on a play, new or old, to lift his spirit with it and to hold him entranced till its fall. As for the circus, he once rejoiced in all its feats; performing elephants could not bore him, nor acts of horsemanship stale its infinite variety. But the time has come abruptly when the smell of the sawdust, or the odor of the trodden weed, mixed with the aroma of ice-cold lemonade, is a stench in his nostrils.|$|E

40|$|International audienceChagas disease {{prevention}} remains mostly based on triatomine vector control {{to reduce or}} eliminate house infestation with these bugs. The level of adaptation of triatomines to human housing is {{a key part of}} vector competence and needs to be precisely evaluated to allow for the design of effective vector control strategies. In this review, we examine how the domiciliation/intrusion level of different triatomine species/populations has been defined and measured and discuss how these concepts may be improved for a better understanding of their ecology and evolution, {{as well as for the}} design of more effective control strategies against a large variety of triatomine species. We suggest that a major limitation of current criteria for classifying triatomines into sylvatic, intrusive, domiciliary and domestic species is that these are essentially qualitative and do not rely on quantitative variables measuring population sustainability and fitness in their different habitats. However, such assessments may be derived from further analysis and modelling of field data. Such approaches can shed new light on the <b>domiciliation</b> process of triatomines and may represent a key tool for decision-making and the design of vector control interventions. Chagas disease is a major public health problem in the Americas, where it affects seven-eight million people (WHO 2014). The pathogenic agent is a protozoan parasite, Trypanosoma cruzi, mainly transmitted to humans and other mammals through the contaminated faeces of blood-sucking insects called triatomines (Hemiptera: Redu-viidae), also known as " kissing bugs ". Control of Chagas disease relies on the treatment of infected patients and prevention of transmission is based mainly on vector control. Currently, more than 140 species of triatomines are recognised. Over half of them have been shown to be naturally or experimentally infected with T. cruzi, but all are suspected to be able to transmit the parasite (or " serve as vectors ") (Bargues et al. 2010). Nevertheless, not all the triatomine species are considered important vectors of T. cruzi. Vector competence varies considerably between the different species/populations of triatomines and depends on multiple criterions. Among these, the level of <b>domiciliation,</b> which is understood as the level of adaptation to human and its domestic environment, is one of the most important, as it defines the level of human-vector contacts (Dujardin et al. 2002). Indeed, species highly adapted to and able to colonise human dwellings are more likely to actively contribute to the transmission of T. cruzi to humans than species that are only found in sylvatic environment. While the <b>domiciliation</b> of triatomine spe-cies/populations is clearly a gradual evolutionary process (Schofield et al. 1999), it has important implications for the design and efficacy of vector control interventions. To date, vector control is mainly achieved through indoor residual insecticide spraying, initially designed to target triatomine species living inside human dwellings and highly adapted to the domestic environment (i. e. domicil-iated or domesticated). However, it is becoming increasingly clear that triatomine species presenting lower levels of <b>domiciliation</b> are also playing an important role in T. cruzi transmission to humans and thus need to be taken into account by vector control programs in many regions. The efficacy of conventional insecticide spraying may indeed be directly affected by the level of <b>domiciliation</b> of triatomines and alternative control strategies thus need to be considered against nondomiciliated species/popula-tions. These populations are a potential source of continuous house infestation and post-spraying re-infestation, making the control by insecticide spraying unsustainable, even in areas where transmission is primarily due to highly domiciliated vectors. The level of domiciliation/intru-sion of triatomine species thus needs to be clearly defined in operative terms to allow for its precise evaluation and the design of effective vector control interventions. In this review, we examine how the domiciliation/ intrusion level of different triatomine species/popula-tions has been defined and measured and discuss how these concepts may be improved for a better understanding of their ecology and evolution, as well as for the design of more effective control strategies against a large variety of triatomine species...|$|E

Following tissue ischemia, progenitor cells are mobilized from their bone marrow or peripheral niches into circulation, adhere at sites of vascular lesion and differentiate {{into a variety of}} mature cell types according to their origin and the local environment. Impairment in this pathophysiological process due to either low numbers of circulating progenitor cells or dysfunctional progenitor cells leads to inadequate vascular repair and upon co-existence with different cardiovascular risk factors to vascular injury and atherosclerosis. Vascular repair is a complex process which includes mobilization, chemotaxis, adhesion, proliferation and differentiation of progenitor cells. The common cardiovascular risk factors can impair this process resulting into inhibition of vascular healing and enhancement of inflammatory pathways which ultimately leads to atherosclerosis. Although homing of progenitor cells into bone marrow has been extensively studied, <b>domiciliation</b> of precursor cells into peripheral tissues and differentiation into mature cells are poorly understood so far. Recently, the role of platelets in <b>domiciliation</b> and subsequent differentiation of progenitor cells has been highlighted. Adherent platelets recruit circulating progenitor cells in vitro and in vivo and induce differentiation of the latter into endothelial cells or macrophages and foam cells. Although further studies are needed to describe the mechanisms that lie underneath these observations, it seems that platelet interaction with progenitor cells is an essential step in both vascular regeneration and injury. Key words: progenitor cells, platelets, regeneration, atherosclerosi...|$|E

In this paper, we use data from Lloyd's Register Fairplay (2009) on 45, 456 vessels belonging to 9, 580 different shipowners to investigate the extent of outsourcing in shipping and to identify key factors affecting the likelihood of outsourcing. The results of our econometric analysis indicate that ship-owners' decisions to outsource are explained by {{the characteristics of the}} vessels in question (age, type, size) and the characteristics of the ship-owner (country of <b>domiciliation,</b> number of vessels). In addition, a specific country effect is identified for Greek ship-owners, which is in line with the findings of previous studies. ...|$|E
40|$|Using two {{approaches}} to panel data, Granger causality analysis with semi-asymptotic tests, and a structural approach based on entropies measured on sequences of multi-period ratings and returns, we specify {{the relationship between}} a fund’s performance and both Morningstar and Europerformance ratings. We conclude on the Europerformance agency forecasting ability for the Luxembourg funds, and the Morningstar agency for the French funds. Indeed, we find two groups of funds depending on their <b>domiciliation</b> and appropriated rating. The results of this paper have implications for the management of fund portfolios, and the structural approach, more robust to our data, must be a first process for forecast models on the basis of similar funds, minor uncertainty or risk measure, and appropriated rating...|$|E
40|$|The {{debate about}} the {{amalgamation}} of local government units (thereafter LGUs for simplicity – in Switzerland: “communes” or “Gemeinden”) usually {{stems from the fact that}} LGUs’ political borders (the institutional territory) do no longer coincide with the economic boundaries required for an efficient provision of most local public services (the functional territory). And both do not correspond with the relational territory which arises out of the private and professional activities of LGUs’ residents as they commute daily or periodically for work, shopping and leisure (Dafflon and Ruegg, 2003 : 890). Additional problems are the openness of economic activities and the emergence of industrial clusters which largely overlap local boundaries. Finally, urban areas and agglomerations usually regroup several neighbouring LGUs whereas the needs for specific public services are identical in each of them and require horizontal cooperation. The core question of this paper is how to reform the institutional and functional territories in such a way that public services are delivered efficiently, according to local preferences and in a way that responds to the needs expressed in the larger relational territory. For the local public sector, the main concern is the reorganisation in a new, coherent public institution of the three circles of deciders, beneficiaries and payers, that is: -the residents in the commune that vote the provision of a public service (admittedly, corporate business and business units have no vote), -the users whose residence or <b>domiciliation</b> can be in but also outside the territory of the LGU which provides the service and -the taxpayers when according to the principle of origin, taxation is attributed to the commune of residence of individuals or legal <b>domiciliation</b> of business companie...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Triatoma infestans, {{the main}} vector of Chagas disease, has nearly been {{eliminated}} from Brazil. Nevertheless, other triatominae species {{are involved in}} the <b>domiciliation</b> process, including Triatoma rubrovaria in Rio Grande do Sul State (RS). Previous studies showed that 1. 6 % of the T. rubrovaria specimens collected at the rural district of Quaraí, RS, were naturally infected by Trypanosoma cruzi. In this study, five T. cruzi isolates obtained from infected triatomines were characterized molecularly and biologically. Genotyping of the T. cruzi isolates showed that they belong to lineage IIc of T. cruzi (TCIIc). Biological characterization showed miotropism and myositis during acute and chronic phases of infection, respectively. Virulence and mortality rates were variable among isolates. To our knowledge, this study corresponds to the first characterization of T. cruzi isolates from T. rubrovaria and the first description of TCII...|$|E
40|$|Along 24 {{consecutive}} months, from January 1984 to December 1986, mosquito captures {{were performed}} {{in a rural area}} of said municipality. Aiming to evaluate the comparative frequency of the mosquito species inside houses and in the immediate vicinity and far from houses, the captures were made in two types of domiciles - one permanently and the other only sporadically inhabited - as well as in surrounding woods. Variations in temperature, relative humidity and rainfall were locally recorded. A tendency for <b>domiciliation</b> became evident by the presence of Aedes scapularis in the human domiciles, mainly in those permantely inhabited. Culex quinquefasciatus showed to be adapted to live with humans also in rural areas, in which, in some instances, insecticides had to be used to keep in under control. Such observations, mainly in terms of Ae. scapularis, reinforce the possibility of those mosquitoes, under favourable conditions, becoming carries of arboviroses to humans in rural environments...|$|E
40|$|Chagas disease {{remains a}} public health concern in Brazil and other Latin American countries, mainly due to the {{potential}} <b>domiciliation</b> of native triatomine species. We analyzed the genetic variability of Triatoma pseudomaculata in sylvatic and peridomestic ecotopes throughout three localities in the northeastern state of Bahia, Brazil. We studied polymorphisms generated by random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and isoenzyme electrophoresis analyses. Based on RAPD analysis, each specimen was {{assigned to one of}} three genetic clusters. Although all sylvatic specimens from one locality were grouped into the same cluster, sylvatic and peridomestic specimens from the other two localities were broadly distributed between the remaining two clusters, suggesting that geographic population structuring was not occurring. Furthermore, isoenzyme analysis suggested that distinct populations were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Low statistical values for Wright's Fst index also supported the absence of population structuring and suggested the occurrence of panmixia. We conclude that genetic flow occurs between sylvatic and peridomestic T. pseudomaculata populations, probably as a consequence of passive and active dispersion of the insects, associated with deforestation and anthropic transformations...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} assay the triatomine {{infestation}} and <b>domiciliation</b> {{in the rural}} area of Jaguaruana district, state of Ceará, Brazil, we studied, from November 2000 to April 2002, 4 localities comprising 158 domiciles as a whole, {{with an average of}} 4 inhabitants/house, who are dwelling in there for more than 7 years. Most houses have tile-covered roofs and the walls built with plaster-covered bricks (57 %), followed by bricks without plaster (33 %), and mud walls (7. 5 %). A total of 3082 triatomines were captured from different locations, according to the following capture plan: (a) intradomiciles: 238 Triatoma brasiliensis, 6 T. pseudomaculata, 9 Rhodnius nasutus, and 2 Panstrongylus lutzi; (b) peridomiciles (annexes) : 2069 T. brasiliensis, 223 T. pseudomaculata, 121 R. nasutus, and 1 P. lutzi; (c) wild, in carnauba palms (Copernicia prunifera) : 413 R. nasutus. From the captured triatomines, 1773 (57. 5 %) were examined. The natural index of Trypanosoma cruzi infection ranged from 10. 8 % to 30. 2 % (average of 17 %), depending on the species and the location from where the triatomines were captured...|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} about T. sordida {{in the natural}} environment in two {{different regions of the}} state of Minas Gerais: Itapagipe (Triângulo), an area of cerrado modified by the formation of fields of pasture and agriculture, and Mato Verde (north) an area of transition between caatinga and cerrado with profound deforestation in the last years due to the expansion of cotton cultivation. In both regions the principal ecotopes identified were hollow trees and the bark of live or dead trees, where the occurrence of a food source is not frequent. In this environment, the triatomines utilize various food sources; opposums appear to represent an important source of infection. In the north of Minas, a greater concentration of reservoirs and vectors was observed than in the Triángulo which could explain the higher level of infection of the triatomines in the north. Close attention to the process of <b>domiciliation</b> of T. sordida in the north of Minas is recommended where an extensive intervention by man in the natural environment has occurred and where a rise in the population of triatomines in the peridomestic environment has been observed in recent years...|$|E
40|$|Chagas disease {{prevention}} remains mostly based on triatomine vector control {{to reduce or}} eliminate house infestation with these bugs. The level of adaptation of triatomines to human housing is {{a key part of}} vector competence and needs to be precisely evaluated to allow for the design of effective vector control strategies. In this review, we examine how the domiciliation/intrusion level of different triatomine species/populations has been defined and measured and discuss how these concepts may be improved for a better understanding of their ecology and evolution, {{as well as for the}} design of more effective control strategies against a large variety of triatomine species. We suggest that a major limitation of current criteria for classifying triatomines into sylvatic, intrusive, domiciliary and domestic species is that these are essentially qualitative and do not rely on quantitative variables measuring population sustainability and fitness in their different habitats. However, such assessments may be derived from further analysis and modelling of field data. Such approaches can shed new light on the <b>domiciliation</b> process of triatomines and may represent a key tool for decision-making and the design of vector control interventions...|$|E
