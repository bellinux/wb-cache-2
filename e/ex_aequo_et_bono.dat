One distinguished authority says: Praefectus turmae equitum Hispanorum, cum proelio tuba caneret, unum ex equitibus suae turmae obvium habuit; qui questus est quod paucis ante diebus equum suum in certamine amiserat, propter quod non poterat imminenti proelio interesse; unde jussit Praefectus ut unum ex suis equis conscenderet et ipsum comitaretur. Miles, equo conscenso, inter fugandum hostes, incidit in ipsum ducem hostilis exercitus, quem cepit et consignavit Duci exercitus Hispani, qui a captivo vicena aureorum millia est consequutus. Dicebat Praefectus partem pretii hujus redemptionis sibi debere, quod miles equo suo dimicaverat, qui alias proelio interesse non potuit. Petrinus Bellus affirmat se, cum esset Bruxellis in curia Hispaniarum Regis de hac quaestione consultum, et censuisse, pro Praefecto facere aequitatem quae praecipue respicitur inter milites, quorum controversiae <b>ex</b> <b>aequo</b> <b>et</b> <b>bono</b> dirimendae sunt; unde ultra conventa quis obligatur ad id quod alterum alteri prasstare oportet.'

In particular, he discussed the condictiones from D. 12, 1. Stephanus introduced a specific name for the condictio from D. 12, 1, 32, namely ó κονδικτικιο& sigmav; απο καλον και δικαιον (condictio <b>ex</b> <b>bono</b> <b>et</b> <b>aequo).</b> This name refers to the facts of the casus. Only the plaintiff as former owner can apply ó κονδ ικτικιος απ ο καλον και δικαιον against a possessor in good faith who has acquired ownership. It always concerns an enrichment of a third person with whom the plaintiff has not any juridical relation. It appears that in other Digest fragments this specific condictio is also recognized on the basis of substantive grounds. Stephanus used the condictio <b>ex</b> <b>bono</b> <b>et</b> <b>aequo</b> from D. 12, 6, 66 as technical juridical term and gave it a forensic meaning. © 2012 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden...|$|R

5000|$|Lex mercatoria (from the Latin for [...] "merchant law"), often {{referred}} to as [...] "the Law Merchant" [...] in English, is the body of commercial law used by merchants throughout Europe during the medieval period. It evolved similar to English common law as a system of custom and best practice, which was enforced through a system of merchant courts along the main trade routes. It functioned as the international law of commerce. It emphasised contractual freedom and alienability of property, while shunning legal technicalities and deciding cases <b>ex</b> <b>aequo</b> <b>et</b> <b>bono.</b> A distinct feature was the reliance by merchants on a legal system developed and administered by them. States or local authorities seldom interfered, and did not interfere a lot in internal domestic trade. Under lex mercatoria trade flourished and states took in large amounts of taxation.|$|E
50|$|That is to say, a court {{comes to}} the {{conclusion}} that the situation engaged in a case has no answer from the governing system of law. This is of particular relevance to international law since international courts, be it the International Court of Justice or ad hoc tribunals, cannot invent law to redress a lacuna. As has now become the practice, the last resort that can be taken recourse to in deciding contentious cases is the widely accepted law of civilized nations (see generally Barcelona Traction, as accepting the doctrine of estoppel as part of international law). The <b>ex</b> <b>aequo</b> <b>et</b> <b>bono</b> jurisdiction has to date never been accepted by states, and it is believed that states would never accept it. Thus, absence of determinable international law leads to the court declaring something non liquet. But it has been argued by many that invoking of the non liquet doctrine is opposed to the notion of law being a complete (and autonomous) system. Note that municipal courts enforcing international law are not constrained to declare an area non liquet.|$|E

But it lies for money paid by mistake; or upon a consideration which happens to fail; or for money got through imposition, (express or implied) or extortion; or oppression; or an undue advantage taken of the plaintiff's situation, contrary to laws made for the protection of persons under those circumstances.

Rijetko su kada sudionici tih rasprava iskazivali poznavanje međunarodne sudske i arbitražne prakse o morskim razgraničenjima, iako su jedni tu mogućnost rješenja spora otklanjali, a drugi su je zagovarali. U svemu tome još je manje bilo raspravljanja o ulozi pravde, pravičnosti i međunarodnoga prava u toj oblasti, ali se napose Slovenija počesto poziva na “pravičnost“ i prije je predlagala sudsko rješavanje <b>ex</b> <b>aequo</b> <b>et</b> <b>bono</b> umjesto po pravu. Ovaj tekst ima napose za cilj da razjasni neka pitanja iz Sporazuma o arbitraži dviju država od 4. studenoga 2009. godine. The {{disagreement}} over the maritime delimitation between Slovenia and Croatia in the North Adriatic is {{the topic of}} heated debates {{in both of these}} countries among politicians, journalists and some lawyers. There are, however, few participants in these debates who displayed the knowledge of the case law of international courts and tribunals in maritime delimitations. That is {{in spite of the fact}} that some of these participants vigorously oppose, and others advocate the judicial settlement of this dispute. In all of that there was the least discussion about the role of justice, equity and law in this domain, although Slovenia in particular often refers to equitable solution of this dispute instead of that based on law. Slovenia previously advocated the procedure before the International Court of Justice <b>ex</b> <b>aequo</b> <b>et</b> <b>bono</b> as provided in Article 38 (2) of its Statute. This paper has as its aim to elucidate these problems, and especially to construe some provisions in the Arbitration Agreement between two States of 4 November 2009. According to the Lalande’s Vocabulary of Philosophy, equity is but a “sentiment sûr et spontané du juste et de l’injuste, en tant surtout qu’il se manifeste dans l’appréciation d’un cas concret et particulier”. 14 This concept is quite separate from the rules of Equity in Anglo-Saxon law. On the other hand, it was proved in practice that there are no “equitable principles” which could replace the rules of positive international law, even in maritime delimitations. Equity (aequitas) in the above meaning is tobe considered in correlation with law (jus) and justice (justicia) taken as an end, especially in judicial and arbitral settlement. In this sense equity appears infra legem, praeter legem and contra legem. (i) Equity infra legem or accessory equity is normally resorted by a judge in his application of law, for which he needs not to be authorized by parties. He will inspire himself by equity especially if the law leaves to him a margin of discretionary power, such as in assessment of damage and of compensation for loss, in fixing the interest on the sum awarded, in apportionment of coasts of the suit before the court, etc. In addition, the judge is guided by equity in assessment of proofs, or when resorting to the concept of abuse of law. And when the ambiguous meaning of a treaty leaves several interpretations possible, he will choose that which seems the most equitable to him. However, this kind of equity does not empower the judge to undermine the clear sense of a legal text to be applied, nor can he through equity remove paucities in law or correct its unjust consequences. He must apply the law in good faith such as it is in force. (ii) Equity praeter legem is that to which a judge must resort in cases of lacunae or gaps in law, in order to avoid declaring non liquet. Especially in settlement of disputes on land and maritime delimitations between States, a judge or arbitrator can have a large power in deciding some issues on equity praeter legem. At the same time he has a large responsibility in doing justice to the disputing parties. The agreement by which the parties seek the final settlement of their dispute should be interpreted as their indirect authorization given to the court to decide their case on the basis of equity in absence of applicable legal rules in force. The matter is for instance of the identification of relevant coasts abutting upon the area to be delimited. In this area a provisional line of equidistance is posited as a hypothesis, which should be adjusted in the light of relevant circumstances (if any) in order to achieve an equitable result. The latest task belongs to the equity infra legem. Besides this, the parties can empower a judge or arbitrator to prescribe by his judgment a special legal regime of navigation in their territorial waters, or to set down measures for protection of fishing resources or for preservation of the marine environment. Equity praeter legem plays important role in performing of all these functions by a judge. (iii) Equity contra legem is usually connected with the special power of the judge, agreed by all parties, to decide their case <b>ex</b> <b>aequo</b> <b>et</b> <b>bono,</b> as provided in Article 38, paragraph 2 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice. However, this is not precisely the case because the judge is even in this function bound by many important legal limits. The power to decide a case <b>ex</b> <b>aequo</b> <b>et</b> <b>bono</b> is in fact the power endowed to the court to exercise a genuine legislative function for parties. Nevertheless, while the parties themselves can by their direct agreements make extra-legal compromises based on expediency in order to establish their new legal regime, a judge is in performing this function much more limited. He must prove to the utmost his impartiality before the conflicting claims of all disputing parties. His justice excludes arbitrariness, caprices, and motives of political opportunity or power relations between parties. Besides that, even in accomplishing its quasi-legislative function, the court is bound to observe peremptory norms of general international law (jus cogens), from which the parties themselves cannot decline when making treaties. The court is equally obliged to respect all legal rights of third States to the dispute, because they did not empower it to decide the case and even less to settle it <b>ex</b> <b>aequo</b> <b>et</b> <b>bono.</b> In performing this function of establishing a new legal regime a court could to a certain extent revise subjective rights of both parties. However, even in this function it cannot change the existing inter-State boundaries, boundary regimes or demarcation lines. This can do only the parties by their free agreement. The (Badinter) Arbitration Commission has ruled in its Opinion No. 3 of 11 January 1992 that all external frontiers of newly created States as a consequence of dissolution of the predecessor State, must be respected. The boundaries between territorial entities of the former federation which acquired independence, “may not be altered except by agreement freely arrived at”. Finally, except where otherwise agreed (by the parties themselves), “the former boundaries become frontiers protected by international law”. It is possible to imagine only in abstract terms that the respective new States transfer on a judiciary body the task to trace their new common frontiers. In such a case there should not be a demarcation, but entirely new delimitation. However, for performing of this quite exceptional duty the authorization given to the court to decide a case <b>ex</b> <b>aequo</b> <b>et</b> <b>bono</b> should not suffice. For all the above reasons it is the most appropriate not to link the authorization to a judge or arbitrator to deal <b>ex</b> <b>aequo</b> <b>et</b> <b>bono</b> with the equity contra legem. It is even more important to stress that in the practice of the two Hague Courts since 1922 no judgment on this bases has ever been rendered. [...] In the practice of The Hague Court and arbitral tribunals on maritime delimitations there was much oscillation in respect of the role of equity and “equitable principles”. However, the Arbitral Award in the Barbados/Trinidad and Tobago case of 2006 made a successful attempt in accomplishing a synthesis of principles, rules, criteria, factors and practical methods, articulating them in the context of a consistent process of maritime delimitations to be followed in practice. 15 This synthesis can be helpful to parties to a dispute which are willing to observe all their legal commitments in good faith, including customary rules as enshrined in the 1982 UN Law of the Sea Convention, in order to find a just solution in direct negotiations, instead of resorting to a third impartial body. However, all Slovenia’s claims in the present dispute with Croatia are in contradiction with the basic legal principle that the land dominates the sea. It claims part of the sea far away its coast, in which it does not enjoy any legal entitlement. Previously, it strongly insisted on a political solution based on its considerations of equity contra legem to the detriment of legal rights and interests of Croatia. In order to stop Slovenia’s blockade to the entry of Croatia into the full membership of the European Union, both countries were convinced to agree on the Arbitration Agreement for the final settlement of their dispute. The Agreement was signed on 4 November 2009 in Stockholm. Nevertheless, the agreed text remained the subject matter of continuous misunderstandings in the public opinion in both countries. Equitable solution is again the matter of the dispute, especially in respect of “Slovenia’s junction to the High Sea”, as provided in Article 3 -(1) -(b) of the Agreement. The matter is of a term which does not belong to the legal terminology but to which the Arbitral Tribunal will give a legal interpretation in its Award. In the view of this author the disputed term should be understood in functional and not in territorial context. The respective provision does not empower the Tribunal to render its award <b>ex</b> <b>aequo</b> <b>et</b> <b>bono,</b> and still less to base it on an equity contra legem. Article 3 -(1) -(a) of the Agreement provides that the Arbitral Tribunal shall determine: “the course of the maritime and land boundary between the Republic of Croatia and the Republic of Slovenia”. According to Article 4 on Applicable Law, the Tribunal shall apply: “the rules and principles of international law for the determination referred to in Article 3 (1) (a) ”, i. e. strictly on a legal basis. According to Article 3 -(1) under (b) and (c), the Tribunal shall determine in addition: “Slovenia’s junction to the High Sea”, and “the regime for the use of relevant maritime areas”. Only in respect to these two other functions the “Applicable Law” as provided in Article 4 is different than for the previous task. The Arbitral Tribunal shall apply here: “international law, equity and principles of good neighbourly relations in order to achieve a fair and just result by taking into account all relevant circumstances for the determination referred in Article 3 (1) (b) and (c) ”. This means the application in these domains of rules of international law, including previous practice of States and case law. Only in absence of such rules, standards and practices, the Tribunal shall exercise its equity praeter legem, as well as other considerations “in order to achieve a fair and just result”. It is likely that Slovenia will not be successful in this arbitral procedure in its territorial claims which are devoid of legal ground. That can however be proved as correct only if Croatia is represented in this procedure by experts in knowledge of all these complicated issues...|$|E

40|$|The {{content of}} an {{arbitration}} agreement {{is of great}} practical importance, given the effect its provisions may have on the rights and interests of the parties in the arbitration proceedings. Beside the mandatory elements, an arbitration agreement may include numerous facultative provisions, where parties express their contractual freedom, limited only by the imperative law and institutional arbitration rules. Even in cases when contractual provisions are contrary to the imperative law, in many states, the policy of maintaining arbitration agreement would result in ignoring the problematic provisions. The list of facultative elements of an arbitration agreement is practically limitless; among other elements, it may include: time limitations on the validity of an arbitration agreement; determinations referring to {{the composition of the}} arbitration tribunal; detailed rules pertaining to the procedure, decision-making processes and content of the arbitration award as well as its annulment; provisions on the choice of law; the right of third parties to intervene; joinder, consolidation and the authority of arbitration tribunal to decide as amiable compositeur or <b>ex</b> <b>aequo</b> <b>et</b> <b>bono.</b> The development of international commerce as well as arbitration legislature and practice, featuring transactions of ever-increasing complexity, have brought about the need to establish dispute resolution mechanisms modulated according to their specific characteristics. The customary practice of concluding arbitration agreements in the form of standardized and simple clauses is being challenged by the growing complexity of international trade. Therefore, not only should a modern arbitration agreement clearly demonstrate the parties' intent to submit a dispute to arbitration but it should also conform the arbitration procedure (as much as possible] to the content of the parties' relationship and the dispute that has emerged or may arise thereof...|$|E
40|$|This essay {{intends to}} discuss the four facets of the {{application}} of the law to the merits in arbitration. The first and more classic one is a conflict of laws issue. What law (or laws) or rules (or sets of rules) should, or can, the arbitrator apply to the merits of the dispute? The second is that of how, having identified the applicable law or set of rules, arbitrators go about ascertaining the content of the law or rules to be applied to the merits. The third facet is how arbitrators should actually apply the law and rules to the merits, once they have identified them and ascertained their content. The fourth facet, which straddles the others, is that of mandatory rules: when, why and how should arbitrators apply mandatory rules and which ones should they apply? Specific legal rules exist only in relation to the first of these facets, and even those leave a great discretion to arbitrators. An inquiry into the criteria for the exercise of that discretion in relation to all the aspects of the application of substantive law – and the relevance of ethics in this context – is therefore fundamental to determine the proper conduct of arbitrators {{as well as for the}} outcome of the arbitral process. Indeed, except in the marginal case of <b>ex</b> <b>aequo</b> <b>et</b> <b>bono</b> arbitration, together with the assessment of the facts the identification and application of the rules applicable to the merits is the most crucial aspect of an arbitration, the aim of which is the settlement of the dispute by application of the law. For the purposes of the present discussion, the term ethics is not used in its technical and philosophical sense of rules of behavior based on ideas about what is morally good and bad. It is used in the mundane sense in which it used in arbitration, as shorthand for the unwritten duties of the participants in the arbitral process, particularly arbitrators, with regard to the fair and efficient conduct of the arbitration in the absence of enforceable legal obligations. Also with regard to {{the application of the}} law to the merits ethics can be seen to encompass the duty of the arbitrators to “do a good job” as arbitrators. Spelled out, this is the duty to conform to the legitimate expectations of the parties and to standards of predictability, render a just and enforceable decision, avoid arbitrariness and respect general interests...|$|E
