In 1956, a Civil Engineering Department was formed under Lehigh University graduate Robert L. Ketter, {{who went on to}} become Dean of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, and later President of the University. In 1959, WBFO was launched as an AM radio station by UB's School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, and run by UB's students. The station has since become the launching pad of two modern National Public Radio personalities: Terri Gross and <b>Ira</b> <b>Flatow.</b> <b>In</b> 1961, the Western New York nuclear research program was created. This program installed a miniature, active nuclear fission reactor on the University's South (Main Street) Campus. This program was not particularly active, nor could it compete with other government-run research labs, consequently, the programs performed in this facility were abandoned somewhat shortly after its inception. This reactor was decommissioned in 2005 with little fanfare due to material security concerns.|$|R

50|$|Science Friday (known as SciFri for short) is {{a weekly}} call-in talk show that {{broadcasts}} each Friday on public radio stations, distributed by PRI. SciFri is hosted by award-winning science journalist <b>Ira</b> <b>Flatow</b> and was created and {{is produced by}} ScienceFriday, Inc. The program is divided into two, one-hour programs, with each hour ending with a complete sign-off. The focus of each program is news and information on nature, science, and technology. For most of its existence, Science Friday was a sub-program within Talk of the Nation; it was spun off as a series {{in its own right}} when Talk of the Nation was canceled in June 2013.|$|R
5000|$|The show {{uses the}} number three in its title {{instead of the}} letter [...] "e".

[...] Dr. Gary Lorden, a California Institute of Technology mathematics professor who served as the show's mathematics consultant, told NPR's <b>Ira</b> <b>Flatow</b> that it was created on a normal computer keyboard. Lorden also mentioned that the use of the number three in the title can serve as a restriction in Internet searches about the series.|$|R
50|$|In 1963, William Siemering {{became the}} first {{professional}} general manager of WBFO, the student radio station at the State University of New York (SUNY) at Buffalo. He was hired by Richard Siggelkow, a former faculty member at UW, who was now the Dean of Students. Siggelkow protected the journalistic integrity of the station and gave the new manager total freedom to transform it. Like most college radio stations at the time, WBFO had been a student club limited to evening hours during the academic year. By the end of Siemerling’s eight-year tenure, however, the station had substantially expanded its hours of operations and the professionalism of its staff. Howard Arenstein, <b>Ira</b> <b>Flatow,</b> Clifford Stoll and Henry Tenenbaum are among WBFO’s notable alums.|$|R
50|$|In an {{interview}} with <b>Ira</b> <b>Flatow</b> of Science Friday with NPR News, Phelps explained her study on extinction of memory, and how she hopes {{it can be used}} to treat people with fearful memories (e.g., phobias, PTSD, anxiety disorders). Phelps paired colored squares and mild shocks to participants' wrist to create a fear memory. She then examined the extinction of the fear memory by incorporating extinction training (showing the colored square without shocks) to one group of participants when the memory was vulnerable, and observed that the group no longer showed signs of fear. The second group received the same extinction training but outside of the memory vulnerability window, and still expressed fear. Repeated extinction training helps remove the fearful memory.|$|R

5000|$|Markel's An Anatomy of Addiction: Sigmund Freud, William Halsted, and the Miracle Drug Cocaine {{explores the}} lives and careers of Freud and Halsted through their {{relationship}} to cocaine. Sherwin Nuland's front page New York Times book review described An Anatomy of Addiction as [...] "a tour de force of scientific and social history, one that helps illuminate a unique period in the long story of medical discovery". Having treated patients suffering from various forms of substance abuse, Markel thought that sharing Freud and Halsted's struggles (both personal and scientific) with cocaine would raise awareness of the perniciousness of addiction while illuminating an important chapter in medical history. Discussing his work with Science Friday's <b>Ira</b> <b>Flatow,</b> Markel said [...] "they were so compelling, and I thought using {{their lives and their}} struggles I could really put a human face on this terrible disease." [...] PBS Newshour and C-SPAN also broadcast discussions of his work.

500|$|Events {{covered a}} wide variety of {{scientific}} topics, and combined talks, demonstrations, video presentations and panel discussions. A number of events addressed [...] "big questions". For example, a roster of scientists including physicist William Phillips, philosopher Patricia Churchland, neuroscientist Antonio Damasio, philosopher Daniel Dennett, cognitive scientist Marvin Minsky, and cancer researcher Harold Varmus, debated [...] "What It Means to Be Human" [...] in a panel discussion moderated by Charlie Rose. A recurring theme was the wider implications of scientific results, as exemplified by a discussion on the promises and consequences of personal genomics involving biochemist Paul Nurse, sociologist Nikolas Rose, and human genome project leader Francis Collins. A number of events explored the interface between science and the arts; for instance, a panel including psychologist Nancy C. Andreasen, choreographer and dancer Bill T. Jones, and actor and writer Michael York focused on the scientific study of creativity. Other audiences saw physicists Lawrence Krauss and radio host <b>Ira</b> <b>Flatow</b> presenting modern cosmology, paleontologist Richard Leakey exploring the sixth extinction, and chemist F. Sherwood Rowland and Rensselaer Polytechnic president Shirley Ann Jackson discussing new ways of satisfying humanity's energy needs. A number of events were co-productions with the festival's partners, such as a discussion between Robert Krulwich and neurologist and author Oliver Sacks on perception, held at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and musician Mark Oliver Everett's exploration of the scientific legacy of his father, Hugh Everett, at the Museum of Modern Art.|$|R

5000|$|In 2009, Gail Vance Civille, {{along with}} David Kessler, {{was interviewed by}} <b>Ira</b> <b>Flatow</b> for the NPR [...] program Science Friday in a segment {{entitled}} [...] "How Tasty Foods Change the Brain". In discussing Dr. Kessler's book [...] "The End of Overeating: Taking Control of the Insatiable American Appetite", Civille commented {{to the people who}} want to lose weight to take a product in the mouth and think about what the sensory properties are; what is the smell, what is the taste, what are the aromatics, what are the textural characteristics. She proposes that if they think hard and long about what they actually perceive, they will be less inclined to just go with the joy ride of the kick of the food and through thinking about what is perceived, they might actually eat less. [...] "We used to have foods that we chewed for 15, 20 or 30 times before we swallowed; it took more work to eat." [...] Today she says [...] "There is rarely a food out there, outside of a sweet chewy candy, you have to chew more than 12 times and it is gone; so, you're in for the next hit to get more pleasure." [...] She directed the radio audience to the value of the texture experience in food and the connection it has in the overall satisfaction of the consumer. In conclusion, she suggested [...] "eating fruits and vegetables in reasonable amounts because it's a good way to start losing weight; they are filling, they're satisfying and they're not going to give you the fat, sugar, salt hit over and over again." ...|$|R
