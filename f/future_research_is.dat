25|$|Guard cells {{also provide}} an {{excellent}} model for basic studies {{on how a}} cell integrates numerous kinds of input signals to produce a response (stomatal opening or closing).

25|$|C. rufifacies is {{of primary}} {{forensic}} {{importance in the}} field of medicocriminal entomology and aids in establishing post mortem intervals. The species will become more significant ecologically, medically, and forensically as it displaces other native species and becomes a dominant blow fly. <b>Future</b> <b>research</b> <b>is</b> directed toward examining the potential effects of the widespread distribution of this species. C. rufifacies competes with the native Cochliomyia macellaria species and may cause the latter to become extinct. The fly has been successful in competing with other species in many regions of the world. This newly achieved success will require close monitoring of the species to examine its ecological effects and determine any serious involvement in myiasis.

2500|$|Since {{there are}} very few {{treatment}} methods focused on managing megalencephaly, <b>future</b> <b>research</b> <b>is</b> targeted at inhibiting mutation of the pathway.

The genetic coding that initiates a single mutation is sporadic and patterns are hard to detect in many cases.|$|E
2500|$|Several random {{controlled}} trials (RCTs) comparing DBT {{to other}} forms of cognitive-behavioral treatments have favored the use of DBT to treat borderline patients. Specifically, DBT has been found to significantly reduce self-injury, suicidal behavior, impulsivity, self-rated anger and the use of crisis services among borderline patients. These reductions have been found even when controlling for other treatment factors such as therapist experience, affordability of treatment, gender of therapist and the number of hours spent in individual therapy. In a meta-analysis it was found that DBT was moderately effective. However, none of the studied therapies (including CBT) [...] "fulfilled the criteria for empirically supported treatment." [...] The additional efficacy in the overall treatment of BPD is less clear; <b>future</b> <b>research</b> <b>is</b> needed to isolate the specific components of DBT that are most effective in treating BPD. Furthermore, little research has examined the efficacy of DBT in treating male and minority patients with BPD. Training nurses in the use of DBT has been found to replace a therapeutic pessimism with a more optimistic understanding and outlook.|$|E

2500|$|Water stress (drought {{and salt}} stress) {{is one of}} the major {{environmental}} problems causing severe losses in agriculture and in nature. Drought tolerance of plants is mediated by several mechanisms that work together, including stabilizing and protecting the plant from damage caused by desiccation and also controlling how much water plants lose through the stomatal pores during drought. A plant hormone, abscisic acid (ABA), is produced in response to drought. A major type of ABA receptor has been identified. <b>Future</b> <b>research</b> <b>is</b> needed to test if these receptors can be used to engineer drought tolerance in plants. The plant hormone ABA causes the stomatal pores to close in response to drought, which reduces plant water loss via transpiration to the atmosphere and allows plants to avoid or slow down water loss during droughts. The use of drought tolerant crop plants would lead to a reduction in crop losses during droughts. [...] Since guard cells control water loss of plants, the investigation on how stomatal opening and closure are regulated could lead to the development of plants with improved avoidance or slowing of desiccation and better water use efficiency.|$|E

30|$|The {{founding}} {{years of}} <b>futures</b> <b>research</b> <b>were</b> turbulent.

The different approaches to thinking about, forecasting and planning the future shared the conviction that many possible futures existed to be investigated and created. And they shared the perception of technological and social acceleration derived from the techno-scientific developments that had occurred since 1945, which had to be steered by using modern and “rational” methods and techniques mostly originating from US think tanks.|$|R
