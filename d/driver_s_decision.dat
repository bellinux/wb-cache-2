Through historical analysis of public documents and oral testimonies, the investigation identified ten factors and issues that influenced the board 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> key <b>decisions</b> in what was ultimately a dismissal of the superintendent. ^ The public documents included board minutes, newspaper articles, and editorials. Oral testimonies were obtained from the six former board members, including the researcher, who made the decisions; the former assistant superintendent; and three community members who participated in the public debate about the board 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>decisions.</b> ^ There were three interpretive questions. First, what were the board 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> key <b>decisions?</b> Two key decisions were identified: (1) the board 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>decision</b> to delay action until after the court verdict; and (2) the board 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>decision</b> to allow the superintendent to take 2 ̆ 2 early retirement. 2 ̆ 2 Second, what factors and issues influenced the board 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> key <b>decisions?</b> Ten factors and issues influencing the board 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> key <b>decisions</b> were identified: (1) Belief in the superintendent 2 ̆ 7 s innocence (2) Legal factors and issues (3) Personal relationships (4) Access to information (5) Economic factors (6) Community influence (7) School board culture (8) Political factors (9) Social issues (10) Welfare of students. ^ The third interpretive question was, how can the board 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> key <b>decisions</b> be explained? Two explanatory frameworks for exploring the interaction of the factors and issues were presented: (1) a multivariate political model for analyzing 2 ̆ 2 who governs 2 ̆ 2 education at the local level; and (2) the constraints model of policymaking processes.

Section III focuses on local reaction to the decision to reintroduce the grizzly bear, and in particular, the strong rhetoric of the Idaho congressional delegation opposing the reintroduction. Section IV brings new light on the subsequent legal challenge brought by Governor Dirk Kempthorne and the Republican legislative leadership of the State of Idaho to bar the grizzly bear reintroduction.
