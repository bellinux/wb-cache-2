40|$|A {{criterion}} for selecting a coating for an energy pipeline {{is that the}} coating should have a suitable flexibility to meet the high strain demand during hydrostatic testing and during field bending. This requires knowledge {{of the level of}} strain demand for the pipeline, and also the maximum strain that could be tolerated by the coating system. Whereas average strains imposed during manufacturing and construction are reasonably well predicted, there is insufficient understanding on the factors leading to localised deformation of the pipe. Significant work has been carried out in the past to develop tests for assessing the coatings’ ability to handle a certain amount of strain based on bend testing, tensile testing and burst testing. However, there is a concern as to whether these tests properly represent localised micro-strains associated with construction activities including field bending and pressure testing, particularly pressure testing of pipelines designed for operation at 80 % of specified minimum yield strength (SMYS). Consequently coatings considered "suitable" for modern pipelines may fail. The first issue discussed in this paper is main factors affecting strain localisation. The non-deterministic distributions of heterogeneities over the pipe provide a ground to consider the mechanisms of localisation as a stochastic process. An approach is proposed to quantify the maximum localised strain demand through cold field bending and hydrostatic experiments. Another issue discussed in this paper is the experimental assessment of coating flexibility under the effects of localised strains. Preliminary <b>mandrel</b> <b>tests</b> have been carried out to assess the uniformity of the imposed strain. Although <b>mandrel</b> <b>testing</b> {{has been shown to be}} a useful method for relative comparison of coating flexibility, it has several weaknesses that could significantly affect the reliability and reproducibility of the results...|$|R

A chamfered specimen is designed with four flats on the outer diameter {{for the purpose of}} creating sectors of variable wall thickness which establishes a more nearly plane strain state in the thinnest-gauge sections. Ramp-hold tests conducted in 40 MPa of iodine at 32 S’C show that at a measured diametral strain of 0. 88, chamfered specimens fail while regular tubing specimens require diametral strains of 2 % or greater for failure. Calculations made with a two-dimensional, finite elements code show that at a measured diametral strain of 0. 84, the local strains in the clad ID over the segment interfaces are nearly identical for the regular and chamfered samples while the local stress in the chamfered sample is 1. 5 % greater. Results suggest that the smaller diametral failure strain of the chamfered specimen at low measured diametral strains is mainly due to its near plane strain condition and the higher hoop stresses resulting therefrom. 1...|$|R

Thirteen laboratories have been working on peel test methods in ESIS TC 4 since 1997 and their activities are ongoing. The aim of the work is to develop robust and credible test methods for the determination of adhesive fracture toughness by peel tests. Several geometric configurations have been used, namely, multi-angle fixed arm peel, T-peel, and roller assisted peel {{in the form of a}} <b>mandrel</b> <b>test.</b> The starting point of their work is an established analysis of a peel method that is often developed from a global energy approach. The adopted analysis is combined with an experimental approach in order to resolve ambiguities in the determination of adhesive fracture toughness (G A). The test methods involve the measurement of peel strength in order to calculate the total input energy for peel (G) and the calculation of the plastic bending energy (G P) during peel. The latter is often obtained from a measurement of the tensile behaviour of the peel arm. Adhesive fracture toughness is then G – G P. Four ESIS TC 4 projects are described. The first relates to fixed arm peel whilst the second and third involve both fixed arm and T-peel. The fourth project combines mandrel peel and fixed arm peel. Each project uses different types of polymeric adhesives in the form of quite different laminate systems.

40|$|Variable angle fixed arm {{peel and}} <b>mandrel</b> peel <b>tests</b> were {{performed}} on four metal-polymer laminate systems. In total, four polymeric adhesives and three grades of aluminium alloy (AA) substrates were used, enabling {{a wide range of}} material properties to be encompassed in the study. <b>Mandrel</b> peel <b>tests</b> provided a direct determination of the plastic bending energy (Gp) and adhesive fracture toughness (Ga). For the fixed arm tests, a global energy-balance analysis (ICPeel software) was used to determine Ga and Gp analytically. This was done via the calculation of the maximum curvature of the peel arm (1 /R 0) and the root rotation angle (θ 0) from a beam on elastic foundation model. In order to investigate the accuracy of the analytical approach, an experimental method based on high resolution digital photography enabled 1 /R 0 and θ 0 to be measured independently. It was then possible to compare these parameters by measurement and by analytical approach (ICPeel software). θ 0 and R 0 relate to the slope and curvature of the peel arm at the debonding front, respectively. In order to measure these parameters, the coordinates of the edge of the peel arm were extracted from each digital photograph, and the slope and curvature were calculated numerically from these curves. The crack tip was then defined as the point of maximum curvature 1 /R 0, in accordance with traditional beam theory. It was found that the smoothing in the calculation of first and second derivatives could generate significant errors in the value of θ 0. On the other hand, R 0 was found to be a more robust measurement, with little dependence on smoothing. Nevertheless, on most occasions, the measured values of θ 0 and R 0, as well as the resulting Ga were shown to be in good agreement with the analytical model. Since the peel fractures were generally cohesive, Ga was compared with the cohesive fracture toughness (Gc) obtained from Tapered Double Cantilever Beam (TDCB) tests with a fracture mechanics analysis. Good agreement was observed, confirming that Ga {{is likely to be a}} geometry-independent fracture parameter...|$|R

40|$|Fastener free metal-carbon fibre {{reinforced}} {{thermoplastic composite}} hybrid joints show {{a potential for}} application in aerospace structures. In comparison with fastened hybrid joints, fastener free hybrid joints exhibit advantages in terms of joint weight reduction and a more uniformly distributed stress field within the joint. The metal-thermoplastic composite co-consolidation technique shows potential for manufacturing those fastener free hybrid joints in an economic manner. In this technique, the metal parts are essentially co-consolidated with fibre reinforced thermoplastic composite prepreg. The thermoplastic resin present in the prepreg is thus used for bonding and no additional adhesives are employed. However, there is far less understanding {{of the performance of}} metal-thermoplastic composite interfaces as a crucial factor affecting the strength of the entire co-consolidated metal-thermoplastic composite hybrid joint. The performance of the metal-thermoplastic composite interface is governed by a variety of factors, which are promoted by introducing various bonding mechanisms: mechanical interlocking between metal and thermoplastic composite, physical attraction between metal and thermoplastic composite, and chemical bonding between metal and thermoplastic composite. In addition, the thermal residual stress in adherends generated during the consolidation process can impair the interfacial performance. Therefore, with a view to optimising the performance of the interface, the investigation of the effectiveness of these governing factors is significant. The metal-thermoplastic composite hybrid joints studied in this thesis employ grade 5 titanium (Ti- 6 Al- 4 V) as the metal component, while the composite components are from the carbon fibre reinforced polyaryletherketone (C/PAEK) family. In this thesis, the Ti-C/PAEK interfacial performance and the governing factors between titanium and C/PAEK are investigated in the following aspects: • Suitable experimental approaches to evaluate the Ti-C/PAEK interfacial performance, namely <b>mandrel</b> peel <b>test,</b> have been developed and critically assessed. • The <b>mandrel</b> peel <b>test</b> is subsequently employed {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} factors governing the Ti-C/PAEK interfacial performance. Furthermore, the bonding mechanisms activated by these factors are elaborately investigated by experimental approaches. • The aforementioned experimental approach shows that the mechanical interlocking between titanium and thermoplastic composite is an important factor in the interfacial performance. Therefore a theoretical study, including analytical and numerical models, is carried out to enhance the understanding of the effectiveness of mechanical interlocking on the interfacial performance. In order to apply the co-consolidation technique in practice, the effectiveness of the interfacial performance governing factors on the strength of co-consolidated Ti-C/PAEK joints is further studied. Finally, a guideline for fabricating Ti-C/PAEK hybrid joints by the co-consolidation technique, focusing in particular on optimising the Ti-C/PAEK interfacial performance of the hybrid joints, is proposed at the end of this thesis...|$|R

The candidate coating formulations, based on this binder with TiO 2 pigment, were optimized via a detailed series of sprayed test panels that included the parameters of binder/pigment ratio, ethanol content, pigment particle size, coating thickness and cure conditions. A typical optimized coating was prepared by acetic acid catalyzed hydrolysis of methyltriethoxysilane with 3. 25 mol-equivalents of water over a 24 hour period at room temperature.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an assessment of}} the segmented expanding <b>mandrel</b> (SEM) <b>test</b> for material characterization and structural integrity assessment of nuclear fuel claddings. The loading is induced by expanding segments, which are placed inside a cladding tube, radially to simulate cracked fuel that expands thermally. Experimental results are presented for zircaloy- 2 cladding tubes for different number of segments. The tests are analysed with semi-analytical models and two-dimensional finite element models. A complex stress field with stress concentrations occurs {{at the edge of the}} segments, which simulates pellet cladding interaction. The variation of the stresses and the strength of the stress and strain concentrations increases with fewer segments and increases strongly with higher friction coefficient between segments and the cladding tube. By increasing the number of segments and ensuring a low friction coefficient, the deformation is close to axi-symmetric and the SEM can be used to determine qualitatively the material properties such as fracture criteria and stress¿strain curves, but the test is more appropriate for assessment of how defects and microstructure affect ductility. For simulation of mechanical pellet-cladding interaction it is important that the friction coefficient is representative. The resulting stress concentrations promote failure at lower loads and need to be taken into account for the integrity assessment. The SEM test can then be used as a relatively simple test for assessment of pellet fuel cladding interaction. JRC. DDG. F. 5 -Safety of present nuclear reactor...|$|R

The objective was to investigate systematically and in greater detail the most significant findings of previous research into the mechanical characterization of composite paint layers with different media on canvas substrates. First, testing of layered alkyds and acrylics indicates that at low strains the mechanical properties of the composites can be predicted by combining {{the properties of the}} individual layers in proportion to their thickness. However, at higher strains this is not the case. After the failure of an alkyd layer, the stiffness is higher than what would be predicted assuming the load was taken by the acrylic layer only. Second, acrylic primings reduce the amount of cracking in the alkyd top layers, appearing to retard their normal brittle behavior. Conversely, failure of alkyd primings occurs but the acrylic top layer remains visually intact. Samples consist of commercially available oil, alkyd, and acrylic primings with subsequent paint layers of different pigments in oil, acrylic, and alkyd media. The priming and paint layers were prepared as composites on canvas and as free films. <b>Mandrel</b> and fold <b>tests</b> were performed to measure flexibility; the tensile force needed to detach the upper paint layer from a composite was used to measure adhesion.

40|$|Laser-assisted tape {{placement}} is {{an attractive}} manufacturing technology for the aerospace industry as it combines high productivity with low energy consumption. It comprises the automated deposition of fiber reinforced thermoplastic tapes to incrementally build up a structure. The process {{can also be used}} to tailor the properties of conventionally manufactured woven fabric reinforced components by locally reinforcing these with unidirectionally reinforced tapes. This thesis focuses on the weld strength between the tape and the woven fabric reinforced component. The principal objective is to develop an in situ processing strategy, combining high productivity and energy efﬁciency with high weld strength. For this purpose, the important bonding mechanisms, processing parameters and material properties are identiﬁed through a combination of experimental work and physical modeling. The interlaminar bonding process comprises the development of intimate contact followed by the interdiffusion of polymer chains. Both mechanisms depend strongly on the interface temperature. A thermal process model is, therefore, proposed speciﬁcally taking into account the optical aspects of laser heating. The model is validated experimentally. Based on the developed model, the important processing paramaters and material properties are identiﬁed. A <b>mandrel</b> peel <b>test</b> is introduced to quantify the interfacial fracture toughness between the tape and the laminate. The applicability and validity of the method is successfully demonstrated by comparing it to standardized fracture mechanics tests. The interfacial fracture toughness does not only depend on the degree of interlaminar bonding. The crystallinity and structural morphology of the interface also play an important role. This is demonstrated by a comparison between the (fast) tape placement process and a (slow) press-molding process. The tape-placed specimens outperform the press-molded specimens in terms of fracture toughness by almost a factor of two. This is attributed to the high cooling rates and short bonding time during the tape placement process. The former results in a low crystallinity, while the latter prevents the migration of tape fibers into the resin pockets of the laminate and thereby minimizes the fiber–fiber contact. Both the low crystallinity and the presence of resin pockets improve the interfacial fracture toughness. Finally, a processing strategy is proposed, which maximizes productivity and energy efﬁciency. The strategy involves the distribution of all laser power to the tape. Although the proposed strategy should be tested in practice, the work in this thesis suggests that an excellent weld strength will be achieved...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{proposes a}} methodology for accelerated {{testing in the}} area of high-temperature creep and oxidation resistance for thin-gauge superalloy materials. Traditional long-term creep (stress-relaxation) and oxidation tests are completed to establish a baseline. The temperature range used in this study is between 1200 and 1700 °F. The alloys investigated are Incoloy MA 956, Waspaloy, Haynes 214, Haynes 242, Haynes 230, and Incoloy 718. The traditional creep test involves loading the specimens to a constant <b>test</b> <b>mandrel</b> radius of curvature, and measuring the retained radius of curvature as a function of time. The accelerated creep test uses a servohydraulic test machine to conduct single specimen, variable strain-rate load relaxation experiments. Standard metallographic evaluations are used to determine extent and morphology of attack in the traditional oxidation tests, while the accelerated oxidation test utilizes thermogravimetric analysis to obtain oxidation rate data. The traditional long-term creep testing indicates that the mechanically-alloyed material Incoloy MA 956 and Haynes alloy 214 may be suitable for long-term, high-temperature (above 1400 °F) structural applications. The accelerated creep test produced a continuous linear function of log stress versus strain rate which can be used to calculate creep rate. The long-term and traditional oxidation tests indicate that Al 2 O 3 scale formers such as Incoloy MA 956 and Haynes 214 are much more resistant to high-temperature oxidation than Cr 2 O 3 scale formers such as Waspaloy. Both accelerated tests can be completed within roughly one day, and can evaluate multiple test temperatures using standardized single specimens. These simple experiments can be correlated with traditional long-term tests which require years to complete. ...|$|R
40|$|Finite Element Analysis (FEA) {{is used as}} {{a design}} tool within {{engineering}} industries due to the capability for rapid summative analysis accompanied by the visual aid. However, to represent realistic behaviour, FEA relies heavily on input parameters which must ideally be based on true figures such as data from experimental testing which sometimes requires time-consuming testing regimes. In the case of machine tool assemblies where complex structural joints and linkages are present, access to those areas can be a primary constraint to obtaining related boundary parameters such as heat flow across joints, for which, assumptions are incorporated to the FEA model which in effect increase the uncertainty in the FEA predictions. Similarly, in the case of thermal error modelling, simplifications are made when representing thermal boundary conditions such as the application of a uniform convection parameter to an assembly with parts assembled in both horizontal and vertical orientations. This research work aims {{to reduce the number of}} assumptions by providing experimentally obtained thermal boundary condition parameters. This work acknowledges experimental regimes that focus on obtaining thermal parameters related to the conduction across assembly joints (Thermal Contact Conductance-TCC) and measures the convection around areas such as belt drives and rotating parts to obtain convection parameters as inputs to the FEA. It provides TCC parameters for variable interfacial behaviour based on the varying contact pressure and the heat flow through dry and oiled contacts such as the conduction from spindle bearings to the surrounding housing and conduction from guideways into the associated assembly through carriages and contact bearings. It provides convection parameters across the <b>test</b> <b>mandrel</b> rotating at different speeds and around stationary structures such as convection parameters observed during TCC tests. It also provide details on the methods used to obtain all these parameters such as the use of thermal imaging, sensors placements and methods to obtain these boundary condition parameters. The significance of this work is to improve dramatically FEA thermal predictions, which are a critical part of engineering design. Although the focus is on machine tool design, the process and parameters can equally be applied to other areas of thermodynamic behaviour...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} {{is the study of}} the {{resistance}} of different organic coatings containing volatile corrosion inhibitors environmentally friendly and their anti corrosive performance when applied to steel surfaces in sea environment. In the context of this paper, studied 7 coatings systems of 2 categories: a.) organic solvent (SB) and especially 4 coating systems (SB 1,SB 2,SB 3,SB 4) with different density in anticorrosion pigment and 1 system of organic coating with volatile corrosion inhibitor (VCI) and b.) water soluble (WB) especially 2 systems of organic coatings (WB 1,WB 2) containing resin with anticorrosive properties. Coatings in the first category contained two types of anti-corrosive pigments, oxyaminophosphate salt of magnesium and zinc phosphate pigment. As well as these systems contain volatile corrosion inhibitors. Zinc phosphate (Zn 3 (PO 4) 2 * 2 - 4 H 2 O) was the first and most important alternative "green" phosphate pigment was used in place of chromate pigments. Magnesium pigments are ecological anticorrosive pigments as they do not contain any evidence to be responsible for toxicity. Even though these pigments are manufactured at high temperatures they show high thermal stability. The anticorrosive coatings contain corrosion inhibitors in ionic form under the name of "volatile inhibitors", creating a protective layer of ions at the steel surface that stops the electrolytic action between anode and cathode regions. The volatile corrosion inhibitors are defined as compounds or mixtures of compounds (usually organic amine base-soluble in water) with high vapor pressure (107 - 10 - 2 mmHg) that can prevent general corrosion of metallic materials. In the field of organic coatings the use of corrosion inhibitors makes it possible to prepare organic coatings friendlier to the environment with the possibility of better corrosion protection and the ability to heal itself. The requirement {{for the protection of the}} environment impose on paint industries, to produce paints with lower content in volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Thus one way to reduce these, is the steady reduction in the use of organic solvents and the creation of new coatings in which we use water as solvent which as a dispersion medium allows to avoid pollution problems by solvent evaporation. The second category of waterborne coatings,which are studied, contains acrylic resin with anticorrosive properties. The anticorrosive properties of these products are based on the fact that almost no water or vapor will migrate through the polymer membrane, since no water or oxygen can penetrate into the metal substrate, so therefore there is no corrosion. Because of this unique feature, the aqueous dispersion requires no filling or anticorrosive pigment for optimum performance. This means that it is possible to deliver very high gloss in pigmented coatings with superior anticorrosive properties. The degree of corrosion protection of the coatings was estimated by determining the density of the corrosion current icorr, linear polarization resistance Rp and the corrosion rate CR as a function of exposure time of the coated specimens in a sea enironment NaCl 3, 5 % w/w. In addition to this we examine the change in the corrosion potential of the coated samples according to the exposure time in the corrosive environment. The durability of organic coatings was studied by assessing their physicochemical properties. For this study used the following methods:  Estimation of coating system adhesion by the cross cut test  Estimation of coating system adhesion by the pull-off test  Estimation of coating system flexibility by the Conical <b>mandrel</b> bending <b>test</b> Summarizing the main outcomes from this thesis it is concluded that: The coatings contain volatile inhibitors (VpCI) have very good anti-corrosion properties in the coating but lose their mechanical properties and adhesion. Moreover both anticorrosive,adhesion and mechanical properties are very good in organic coatings (SB). On the contrary,huge disadvantage is the environmental pollution due to the organic solvent. In the end,in coatings with water-soluble resins (WB) we observe changes in the anticorrosive properties by changing the composition of the coating. Generally, WB coatings do not exhibit good electrochemical properties. Adhesion is increased when the emulsion of the resin increases. The mechanical properties vary and can be placed between the mechanical properties of the two previous categories of organic coatings. ΚΥΡΙΑΚΟΣ ΣΟΛΟΜΩΝΙΔΗΣ 172 σ.
