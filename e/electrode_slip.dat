40|$|M. Ing. The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the use of computer vision techniques to measure the <b>electrode</b> <b>slip.</b> The study investigates a potential location for camera placement in the furnace housing, as well as the use of computer vision algorithms that could be used to solve the problem. A slip measurement algorithm is then designed, implemented and tested. The implemented slip measurement algorithm is based on the manual slip measurement technique, by measuring relative electrode and slip arm displacement between the electrode and the slip arm. The algorithm uses SURF invariant features to extract the electrode features and slip arm features in one frame, and match these features to the next frame SURF. Scene calibration is then used to relate the pixel slip measurement to a metric distance measurement. The experimental results proved that there is scope for applying computer vision techniques to address the slip measurement problem, using a single HD camera. However, there is room for improvement and the recommendations and future work are also discussed...|$|E
40|$|Electroencephalography (EEG) {{is widely}} used in {{hospitals}} to monitor brain activities which include sleep disorders. Currently, most of the measuring processes use mainly wet <b>electrodes.</b> These <b>electrodes</b> <b>slip</b> off the patientâ€™s head easily {{and at the end}} of the recording session, cleaning must be carried out. As a result, EEG recording process becomes cumbersome. Thus, the main objective of this study is to attempt to alleviate or solve this problem by designing a dry EEG electrode and selecting the appropriate materials. 1...|$|R
40|$|Records of {{spontaneous}} discharge of nerve impulses, {{similar to that}} previously described in catfish and in trout, have been obtained from lateral-line nerves of goldfish and perch, {{by the use of}} concentric micro <b>electrodes</b> <b>slipped</b> under the nerve in situ. These impulses have been followed into the central nervous system. They enter the tuberculum acusticum and thence apparently spread diffusely through the cerebellum. Cutting the lateral-line nerve on one side silences the ipsilateral tuberculum acusticum, but only reduces the intensity of ipsilateral cerebellar activity. Cutting the remaining lateral-line nerve silences activity throughout the tuberculum acusticum and the cerebellum. The maintenance of tonic activity in the tuberculum acusticum by way of lateral-line discharge may account for the inhibitory effects of the lateral-line system on auditory responses...|$|R
40|$|The net flow of {{electrolyte}} {{induced by}} an ac electric potential applied to {{an array of}} asymmetric pairs of microelectrodes has recently been reported. The interaction between the oscillating electric field and the oscillating induced charge at the diffuse double layer on the electrodes results in a steady electro-osmotic velocity distribution {{on top of the}} <b>electrodes.</b> This <b>slip</b> velocity distribution is anisotropic and produces a net flow of fluid. This paper presents a theoretical analysis of the pumping phenomena based upon an electro osmotic model in ac fields. The electrical equations are solved numerically using the charge simulation method. The bulk flow generated by the electro-osmotic slip velocity is calculated. The dependence of the fluid flow on voltage and frequency is described and compared to experiment...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 96 - 100). A {{preliminary investigation}} into the powder production of a novel hybrid titanium neural electrode for EEG is presented. The rheological behavior of titanium powder suspensions using sodium alginate as a dispersant are examined for optimal <b>slip</b> casting conditions. <b>Electrodes</b> were <b>slip</b> cast and sintered at 950 ??C for 1 hr, 1000 ??C for 1, 3, and 6 hrs, and 1050 ??C for 1 hr. Residual porosities from sintering are characterized using Archimedes' technique and image analysis. The pore network is gel impregnated by submerging the electrodes in electrically conductive gel and placing them in a chamber under vacuum. Gel evaporation of the impregnated electrodes is examined. Electrodes are characterized in the dry and gelled states using impedance spectrometry and compared to a standard silver- silver chloride electrode. Power spectral densities for the sensors in the dry and gelled state are also compared. Residual porosities for the sintered specimens were between 50. 59...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The insect-trapping {{movement}} of the plant Dionaea muscipula (Venus's fly-trap) is mediated by the stimulation of mechanosensory hairs located {{on the surface of}} the trap. It is known that stimulation of the hairs is followed by action potentials which are propagated over the surface of the trap. It has been reported that action potentials always precede trap closure, The occurrence of non-propagated receptor potentials is reported here. Receptor potentials always precede the action potentials. The receptor potential appears to couple the mechanical stimulation step to the action potential step of the preying sequence. Receptor potentials elicited by mechanical stimulation of a sensory hair were measured by using the hair as an integral part of the currentmeasuring path. The tip of the hair was cut off exposing the medullary tissue; this provided a natural extension of the measuring electrode into the receptor region at the base of the hair. A measuring pipette <b>electrode</b> was <b>slipped</b> over the cut tip of the hair. Positive and negative receptor potentials were measured. Evidence is presented which supports the hypothesis that the positive an...|$|R

Evidence is presented which supports the hypothesis that the positive and negative receptor potentials originate from independent sources. An analysis is made of (a) the relation of the parameters of mechanical stimuli to the magnitude of the receptor potential, and (b) the relation of the receptor potentials to the action potential. The hypothesis that the positive receptor potential is the generator of the action potential is consistent with these data...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: In certain chronic neuropathic pain (CNP) conditions, {{extradural}} electrode implantation {{is preferred}} to a subdural location for motor cortex stimulation (MCS) therapy, but {{the rationale for}} this preference remains debatable. We provide documented long-term results of subdural MCS in CNP. METHODS: Our eight consecutive patients (five men, three women; age range, 45 - 81 yr) had either central or peripheral CNP. We localized the central sulcus using anatomic landmarks and three-dimensional neuronavigation and by detecting the N 20 wave inversion. We then created an elongated craniotomy (3 cm long x 1 cm wide), followed by a linear incision of the dura. An eight-polar plate <b>electrode</b> was <b>slipped</b> in subdurally. We used motor-evoked potentials to choose the optimal electrode position before fixing the electrode to the dura. RESULTS: Six patients had favorable outcomes, and two had poor outcomes {{at the time of}} the last assessment (mean, 54 mo; range, 19 - 69 mo). Three patients experienced five transient complications, each having an episode of partial motor seizure, one that evolved into a secondary generalized seizure. Seizures were related to an abrupt increase in stimulation intensity. Two of these three patients also had hardware infections that required system replacement, with the electrode implanted extradurally at the second implantation in one case because of severe arachnoiditis. This change necessitated a greater intensity and a longer duration of stimulation to deliver a therapeutic effect equivalent to that with subdural MCS. CONCLUSION: In this small series, subdural MCS seemed a tolerable approach in the long term for CNP patients. In addition, subdural MCS provided a therapeutic effect comparable to that obtained with extradural placement...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} our {{technique of}} implanting subdural grids by linear craniectomy under computer-assisted navigation for invasive electroencephalography in medically refractory epilepsy. Material and method: We report results from our first 38 consecutive patients with medically refractory epilepsy who underwent subdural grids implantation by linear craniectomy. For each case, a preoperative MRI was performed for navigation {{followed by a}} postoperative MRI for localization control of the intracranial electrode contacts. A linear skin incision, adapted to the depth and type of subdural electrode (strip or grid) and compatible with possible subsequent therapeutic surgery, was carried out. One or two linear craniectomies (maximal length 6. cm, width 1. cm) were then drilled with a bevel. The dura mater was incised under microscopic guidance to avoid opening the arachnoid. The required subdural <b>electrodes</b> were then <b>slipped</b> subdurally through each linear craniectomy (letter-box technique). Results: Forty-one invasive electroencephalographies were performed with 28 (68 %) bilateral. For all invasive electroencephalographies, at least one subdural grid was implanted. Sixty-one subdural grids were implanted in total, 52 with 20 contacts and nine with 32 contacts. No cerebrospinal fluid leakage, no infection, no neurological deficit and no permanent complications were observed. Three subdural grids (5 %) were not positioned exactly as planned but this had no consequence for the invasive electroencephalography analysis. Conclusion: The implantation of 61 consecutive subdural grids for invasive electroencephalography through linear craniectomies was associated with no transient or permanent complications in this population. This letter-box technique appears to be practical and safe without limiting explorative efficac...|$|R
