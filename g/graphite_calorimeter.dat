40|$|Abstract: The {{standard}} of absorbed dose to water for Co- 60 gamma rays at INMRI-ENEA {{is based on}} graphite calorimetry and on ionometric transfer system (thick-walled graphite ionization chamber). The <b>graphite</b> <b>calorimeter</b> is of the Domen type and absorbed-dose-to-graphite measurements can be performed both in the quasi-adiabatic and in the quasi-isothermal calorimeter mode of operation. Recent improvements in absorbed-dose-to-water standard regard the determination of some correction factors, i. e. the correction for the vacuum gaps in the <b>graphite</b> <b>calorimeter</b> and the correction for the photon fluence perturbation occurring in the procedure adopted to transfer the dose from graphite to water. These correction factors have been re-determined by Monte Carlo simulations based on the EGSnrc code. The calculated values of the correction factors are compared with the values, experimentally determined, so far adopted. Other improvements to the absorbed-dose-to-water standard are presented, regarding a new PC-based data acquisition system and the positioning system of the transfer ionization chamber in the scaled water phantom used for determining the absorbed dose to water. The new revised uncertainty budget on the INMRI-ENEA {{standard of}} absorbed dose to water for Co- 60 gamma rays is discussed. 1.

40|$|The current primary {{standards}} at NPL for {{the measurement of}} absorbed dose to water in high energy photon and electron beams are <b>graphite</b> <b>calorimeters.</b> However, the quantity of interest in radiation dosimetry is absorbed dose to water. Therefore, a new absorbed dose to water standard based on water calorimetry has been developed for use in high energy photon and electron beams. The calorimeter operates at 4 deg C, with temperature control being provided by liquid cooling. The sealed glass inner vessel of the calorimeter was designed to minimise the effect of non-water materials on the measurement of absorbed dose. The temperature sensing thermistor probes were designed and constructed so that glass is the only material in contact with high purity water inside the vessel. Initial measurements of absorbed dose to water made in 6, 10, and 19 MV photons, and 16 MeV electrons agreed, within the measurement uncertainties of approximately 1. 5 % (95 % c. l.), with those determined by graphite calorimetry. These measurements confirmed the feasibility of the calorimeter design. Significant improvements {{have been made to}} the temperature measurement system, the water phantom and its temperature controlled enclosure since these measurements were performed, reducing the estimated uncertainty on the measurement of absorbed dose to water to 1 % (95 % c.

This thesis describes the first measurements carried out with the calorimeter in proton pencil beams as well as well as an analysis of the calorimeter data in scanned proton beams. In doing this analysis, a greater understanding of the response and heat flows within the calorimeter was achieved. These measurement results are compared to simulations carried out using COMSOL MultiphysicsÂ®, a finite-element simulation software package. A model of the calorimeter was built in TOPAS, a Monte Carlo platform which wraps and extends the GEANT- 4 simulation toolkit. This model was used to calculate two correction factors: the gap correction factor, which increased with energy from 1. 00064 (08) at 60 MeV to 1. 00359 (15) at 230 MeV; and the volume averaging correction factor which was 0. 99936 (44) at 60 MeV and 1. 00515 (154) at 230 MeV. TOPAS was also used to build a model of the Clatterbridge beamline, producing Bragg peak and modulated depth-dose curves for the 62 MeV proton beam.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to present the {{numerical}} design optimization, construction, and experimental proof of concept of a <b>graphite</b> probe <b>calorimeter</b> (GPC) conceived for dose measurement in the clinical environment (U. S. provisional patent 61 / 652, 540). A finite element method (FEM) based numerical heat transfer study was conducted using a commercial software package to explore the feasibility of the GPC and to optimize the shape, dimensions, and materials used in its design. A functioning prototype was constructed inhouse and used to perform dose to water measurements under a 6 MV photon beam at 400 and 1000 MU/min, in a thermally insulated water phantom. Heat loss correction factors were determined using FEM analysis while the radiation field perturbation and the graphite to water absorbed dose conversion factors were calculated using Monte Carlo simulations. The difference in the average measured dose to water for the 400 and 1000 MU/min runs using the TG- 51 protocol and the GPC was 0. 2 % and 1. 2 %, respectively. Heat loss correction factors ranged from 1. 001 to 1. 002, while {{the product of the}} perturbation and dose conversion factors was calculated to be 1. 130. The combined relative uncertainty was estimated to be 1. 4 %, with the largest contributors being the specific heat capacity of the graphite (type B, 0. 8 %) and the reproducibility, defined as the standard deviation of the mean measured dose (type A, 0. 6 %). By establishing the feasibility of using the GPC as a practical clinical absolute photon dosimeter, this work lays the foundation for further device enhancements, including the development of an isothermal mode of operation and an overall miniaturization, making it potentially suitable for use in small and composite radiation fields. It is anticipated that, through the incorporation of isothermal stabilization provided by temperature controllers, a subpercent overall uncertainty will be achieved.

40|$|The fluence {{correction}} factor, {{which accounts}} {{for the loss of}} primary protons and the production of secondary particles due to different non-elastic nuclear interactions at water equivalent depths in different phantom materials compared to water is an important parameter for the dose conversion in clinical proton dosimetry between any phantom material and water. Non-elastic nuclear interactions introduce uncertainties in the standard absorbed dose-to- water in radiotherapy. This thesis is part of an ongoing project at the UK National Physical Laboratory. (NPL) focussed on the development of <b>graphite</b> <b>calorimeters</b> for proton dosimetry. The fluence correction factor was investigated to give accurate dose conversions from dose- to-graphite in a graphite phantom to dose-to-water in a water phantom. The fluence correction factors at water equivalent depths have been studied for various dosimetric materials including A-ISO tissue equivalent, polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), aluminium and copper with respect to water and with respect to graphite. The water equivalence of materials such as Plastic Water (PW), Plastic Water Diagnostic Therapy (PWDT) and solid water (WTl) phantoms was evaluated using a 60 MeV proton beam at the Clatterbridge Centre for Oncology. Plastic-water phantoms are widely used in radiotherapy as a substitute for water, in particular for non-reference dosimetry. However, while they are usually made 'water equivalent' for a particular beam type, they are not universally water equivalent due to their different elemental composition and associated different proton interaction cross sections (compared to water). Numerous studies of the water equivalence of plastic-water phantoms have been reported for photon and electron beams, but none with clinical proton beams. In the latter, non-elastic nuclear interactions take place which could potentially influence the water equivalence. This thesis evaluates the fluence correction factor at equivalent depths for proton energies of 60 Me V and 200 Me V, with respect to both water and graphite. This work was performed using analytical model calculations (which incorporate the ICRU- 49 (1993) stopping power data tables and ICRU- 63 (2000) for the total nuclear interaction cross sections); Monte Carlo simulations using the FLUKA 2008. 3 code; and also experimental work at the Clatterbridge Centre for Oncology (CCO) 60 Me V with both modulated and un- modulated proton beams. The analytical calculations for primary protons indicate an increase in the fluence correction at both low and high energies compared to the Monte Carlo simulations. When the secondary charged particle were considered in the calculation, the fluence correction factor with respect to water was in general close to the unity for graphite, A-I 50, PMMA, aluminium and plastic-water materials in 60 MeV mono-energetic beam. For proton energies of 200 Me V, the fluence correction was found to increase to a the order of a IV Fluence correction (actor (or various materails in clinical poroton dosimetrv Abstract few percent. The experimental finding for modulated and un-modulated 60 MeV protons showed that the fluence correction factor with respect to water is close to unity for graphite and PWDT with an uncertainty of 0. 2 % at la. The derived fluence correction with respect to graphite was also close to the unity for A-ISO and plastic-water materials, however, it was found to increase with depth to approximately 4 % and 6 % for aluminium and copper respectively (in modulated beam). In general, the experimental results for modulated and un- modulated 60 MeV proton beams show good agreement with the Monte Carlo simulations for modulated and un-modulated beams, yielding small fluence corrections, within the statistical uncertainty. For 200 MeV protons, the Monte Carlo simulations showed that the correction with respect to water increased with penetration depth giving values of up to 4 % for graphite and 1. 5 % for A-ISO, PMMA, aluminium, copper and plastic-water materials. The fluence correction with respect to graphite was found to vary with penetration depth and hence it can be concluded that fluence correction factors need to be applied to ensure accurate dosimetry for all of the materials used in the current work with a 200 MeV proton beam.

It was observed that 532 nm laser pulses were more effective than 1064 nm pulses in gas generation and both were nonlinearly correlated {{with respect to the}} laser energy density. Mainly hydrogen (H 2) and carbon monoxide (CO) were observed.

This uncertainty is dominated by the beam quality correction factors, kQ,Q 0, mainly due to the mean energy to produce one ion pair in air, wair.

40|$|As {{an agent}} of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, the Australian Atomic Energy Commission (AAEC) is {{responsible}} for the maintenance of the Australian Commonwealth standard of absorbed dose. A <b>graphite</b> <b>calorimeter</b> was designed and built at the AAEC Research Establishment to provide such a standard for the dose absorbed in carbon from y- and X-ray beams with maximum photon energies above 500 keV. The calorimeter measures the dose averaged over the volume of a thermally insulated absorber disc of diameter 20 mm, thickness 3 mm and mass 1. 7 g. The absorber and associated adiabatic and temperature controlled jackets are contained within a small graphite phantom of diameter 15 cm. The depth to the centre of the absorber is adjustable between 2. 1 and 10 cm. By using a modified vacuum chamber window, the minimum depth can be reduced to 5 mm for use with high energy electron beams.

40|$|The {{absolute}} dose {{delivered to}} a dynamically scanned sample in the Imaging and Medical Beamline (IMBL) on the Australian Synchrotron {{was measured with}} a <b>graphite</b> <b>calorimeter</b> anticipated to be established as a primary standard for synchrotron dosimetry. The calorimetry was compared to measurements using a free-air chamber (FAC), a PTW 31014 Pinpoint ionization chamber, and a PTW 34001 Roos ionization chamber. The IMBL beam height is limited to approximately 2 mm. To produce clinically useful beams of a few centimetres the beam must be scanned in the vertical direction. In practice it is the patient/detector that is scanned and the scanning velocity defines the dose that is delivered. The calorimeter, FAC, and Roos chamber measure the dose area product which is then converted to central axis dose with the scanned beam area derived from Monte Carlo (MC) simulations and film measurements. The Pinpoint chamber measures the central axis dose directly and does not require beam area measurements. The calorimeter and FAC measure dose from first principles. The calorimetry requires conversion of the measured absorbed dose to graphite to absorbed dose to water using MC calculations with the EGSnrc code. Air kerma measurements from the free air chamber were converted to absorbed dose to water using the AAPM TG- 61 protocol. The two ionization chambers are secondary standards requiring calibration with kilovoltage x-ray tubes. The Roos and Pinpoint chambers were calibrated against the Australian primary standard for air kerma at the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency (ARPANSA).

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis is to analyze the standard procedure for the accurate determination of absorbed dose to water at electron and photon clinical beams with energy up to 25 MeV. To this aim a number of cavity chambers of cylindrical and plane-parallel types were used. Emphasis is directed towards {{the analysis of the}} internal consistency of the Italian AIFB dosimetry protocol when applied to different types of ionization chambers. Some comparative measurement by a <b>graphite</b> <b>calorimeter</b> was also made to have an absolute and independent determination of the absorbed dose values. Measurements at photon and electron beams by cylindrical chambers give consistent results. At electron beams plane-parallel chambers show some appreciable deviations in the absorbed dose values. In this case it is likely that the electron fluence perturbation factors, currently assumed equal to unity, differ from unity for the chambers and at the energies involved. Final results are discussed as far as chamber characteristics and protocol consistency are concerned. A review of the various national and international dosimetry protocol for the determination of absorbed dose to water in high energy electron and photon beam is also presented in this thesis. To develop standard procedures for the calibration of plane parallel chambers using Co- 60 gamma-ray beam free in air, the influence of various build-up materials is studied and the composite correction factor kpp determined.

40|$|The {{conversion}} of absorbed dose-to-graphite in a graphite phantom to absorbed dose-to-water {{in a water}} phantom is performed by water to graphite stopping power ratios. If, however, the charged particle fluence is not equal at equivalent depths in graphite and water, a fluence correction factor, k fl, is required as well. This is particularly relevant to the derivation of absorbed dose-to-water, the quantity of interest in radiotherapy, from a measurement of absorbed dose-to-graphite obtained with a <b>graphite</b> <b>calorimeter.</b> In this work, fluence correction factors for the conversion from dose-to-graphite in a graphite phantom to dose-to-water in a water phantom for 60 MeV mono-energetic protons were calculated using an analytical model and five different Monte Carlo codes (Geant 4, FLUKA, MCNPX, SHIELD-HIT and McPTRAN. MEDIA). In general the fluence correction factors {{are found to be}} close to unity and the analytical and Monte Carlo codes give consistent values when considering the differences in secondary particle transport. When considering only protons the fluence correction factors are unity at the surface and increase with depth by 0. 5 % to 1. 5 % depending on the code. When the fluence of all charged particles is considered, the fluence correction factor is about 0. 5 % lower than unity at shallow depths predominantly due to the contributions from alpha particles and increases to values above unity near the Bragg peak. Fluence correction factors directly derived from the fluence distributions differential in energy at equivalent depths in water and graphite can be described by k fl = 0. 9964 + 0. 0024 á¹¡ z w-eq with a relative standard uncertainty of 0. 2 %. Fluence correction factors derived from a ratio of calculated doses at equivalent depths in water and graphite can be described by k fl = 0. 9947 + 0. 0024 á¹¡ z w-eq with a relative standard uncertainty of 0. 3 %. These results are of direct relevance to graphite calorimetry in low-energy protons but given that the fluence correction factor is almost solely influenced by non-elastic nuclear interactions the results are also relevant for plastic phantoms that consist of carbon, oxygen and hydrogen atoms as well as for soft tissues.

40|$|Based on {{experiments}} and numerical simulations, a study {{is carried out}} pertaining to the conversion of dose-to-graphite to dose-to-water in a carbon ion beam. This conversion is needed to establish graphite calorimeters as primary standards of absorbed dose in these beams. It is governed by the water-to-graphite mass collision stopping power ratio and fluence correction factors, which depend on the particle fluence distributions {{in each of the}} two media. The paper focuses on the experimental and numerical determination of this fluence correction factor for an 80 MeV/A carbon ion beam. Measurements have been performed in the nuclear physics laboratory INFN-LNS in Catania (Sicily, Italy). The numerical simulations have been made with a Geant 4 Monte Carlo code through the GATE simulation platform. The experimental data are in good agreement with the simulated results for the fluence correction factors and are found to be close to unity. The experimental values increase with depth reaching 1. 010 before the Bragg peak region. They have been determined with an uncertainty of 0. 25 %. Different numerical results are obtained depending on the level of approximation made in calculating the fluence correction factors. When considering carbon ions only, the difference between measured and calculated values is maximal just before the Bragg peak, but its value is less than 1. 005. The numerical value is close to unity at the surface and increases to 1. 005 near the Bragg peak. When the fluence of all charged particles is considered, the fluence correction factors are lower than unity at the surface and increase with depth up to 1. 025 before the Bragg peak. Besides carbon ions, secondary particles created due to nuclear interactions have {{to be included in the}} analysis: boron ions (10 B and 11 B), beryllium ions (7 Be), alpha particles and protons. At the conclusion of this work, we have the conversion of dose-to-graphite to dose-to-water to apply to the response of a <b>graphite</b> <b>calorimeter</b> in an 80 MeV/A carbon ion beam. This conversion consists of the product of two contributions: the water-to-graphite electronic mass collision stopping power ratio, which is equal to 1. 115, and the fluence correction factor which varies linearly with depth, as kfl, all = 0. 9995 + 0. 0048 zw-eq.

40|$|Radiotherapy {{treatment}} {{entails the}} delivery of large radiation doses to malignant tissues in the human body. These doses must be accurate in order to balance tumour control and damage to healthy tissues. The first step in accurate dosimetry is the calibration of radiation dosemeters by the national primary standards laboratory. Any uncertainties in this fundamental step will {{be passed on to}} every radiotherapy patient in Australia. Absorbed dose to water is the quantity used for the calibration of linear accelerator (linac) beams and many treatment planning systems. The work in this thesis is devoted to the establishment of the Australian primary standard of absorbed dose with clinically used high energy photon beams, and in particular to the Monte Carlo methods employed. The work described occurs in three stages: modelling of the accelerator head, modelling of the <b>graphite</b> <b>calorimeter</b> and water phantom in order to determine absorbed dose to water, and validation of the Australian primary standard of absorbed dose to water by comparison with international primary standards laboratories. The EGSnrc user codes BEAMnrc and DOSXYZnrc have been used for this work. The linac model is built using BEAMnrc component modules to match the components inside the real linac head. Validation of the linac model is performed by comparison of modelled PDDs and profiles with their measured counterparts. The ARPANSA measurement of absorbed dose to water is the basis for all absorbed dose calibrations performed in Australia. The determination of absorbed dose to water by ARPANSA begins with a measurement of absorbed dose to graphite. A <b>graphite</b> <b>calorimeter</b> is used to measure the heating caused by irradiation {{in order to determine the}} absorbed dose to graphite. The measured dose to graphite is converted to absorbed dose to water by a factor evaluated by Monte Carlo calculations. The conversion factor is calculated as the ratio of two components: the modelled dose to water at the reference depth in the absence of an ionisation chamber and the modelled dose to the core (the sensitive element) of the calorimeter. The calorimeter is modelled to replicate the device used with all Mylar coatings and air and vacuum gaps included. The physical calorimeter geometry is confirmed by kilovoltage imaging and gap corrections are calculated and compared to similar calorimeters in the literature for added confidence in the calorimeter model. The final stage of method validation involves comparisons with measurements performed by other researchers. Primarily this is done by comparing the determination of absorbed dose to water with other primary standards laboratories. This thesis presents a direct comparison performed in the ARPANSA linac beams and two indirect comparisons with measurements by the other participants completed at their respective laboratories. In all cases the ARPANSA measurement was lower than comparison participant. The difference between the ARPANSA measurement and that of the other participant was 0. 02 to 0. 46 % at 6 MV, 0. 41 to 0. 76 % at 10 MV and 0. 68 to 0. 80 % at 18 MV. All results for the 6 MV beam agreed within 1 Ï. At 10 MV one measurement agreed within 1 Ï. The remaining 10 MV comparisons and all comparisons at 18 MV differed by between 1 Ï and 2 Ï. In addition to the validation methods, a detailed assessment of the uncertainties in the Monte Carlo conversion factor and the resulting calibration of an ionisation chamber are presented. The uncertainty in the calibration coefficient of an ionisation chamber after interpolation to the clinical beam energy is between 0. 6 and 0. 7 %. The resulting quantity of absorbed dose to water is used to determine the calibration factor, ND,w [D, w subscript], of an ionisation chamber. The ratio of calibration factors measured in a linac beam and in â¶â°Co is the measured energy correction factor, kQ [Q subscript], at the linac beam quality. In addition to comparisons of absorbed dose to water, the measured kQ [Q subscript] values for commonly used ionisation chambers have been compared to measured and modelled values of kQ [Q subscript] published elsewhere. An important consideration in changing from using the IAEA kQ [Q subscript] values published in the TRS- 398 Code of Practice to directly measured kQ [Q subscript] values at megavoltage energies is the shift caused in chamber ND,w [D, w subscript] factors. This varies with chamber type and beam quality. In this thesis four chamber types were considered: the NE 2571 Farmer chamber, and the NE 2611 A, PTW 30013 and IBA FC 65 -G Farmer-type chambers. At 6 MV the expected shift in ND,w [D, w subscript] ranges from - 0. 2 % to - 0. 9 % across the four chamber types. For the 10 MV beam quality the expected shift is - 0. 8 % to - 1. 3 % and at 18 MV - 1. 1 % to - 1. 4 % is expected. The reason for these differences is twofold. The IAEA kQ [Q subscript] values are typically higher than measured kQ [Q subscript] values published by many authors. In addition to this, the ARPANSA measured kQ [Q subscript] values tend to be low compared to the average of many measured kQ [Q subscript] values. Regardless of the reasons, the shift has an impact on the beam calibration of clinical linacs and the implications of this effect are discussed. Thesis (M. Sc. (Med. Phy.))

40|$|To {{facilitate}} a national improvement in therapeutic dosimetry, ARPANSA has installed a clinical linear accelerator (linac) to provide chamber calibrations at the user beam quality. The ARPANSA reference linac is an Elekta Synergy platform linac, {{which can be}} tuned to mimic the beam qualities available in Australian clinics, such as those produced by the Varian linac platforms. Monte Carlo models of a Varian and matched Elekta accelerator have been developed and commissioned. They accurately predict the measured percentage depth dose and profiles, but show significantly different energy spectra, resulting mainly from differences in target thickness between the two accelerators. The critical question is if the spectral difference between the Varian and the matched Elekta will cause any significant change in a chamber calibration factor. This work calculates the error introduced when using a calibration factor obtained from this Elekta Synergy Platform linac on a Varian high energy platform beam at 6 MV. To determine the answer a two stage modelling approach was applied. Firstly the <b>graphite</b> <b>calorimeter</b> that is the Australian primary standard of absorbed dose was modelled. Using the commissioned linac models, the calorimetry measurements of absorbed dose to graphite {{can be converted to}} absorbed dose to water in a direct Monte Carlo conversion. Using the direct MC conversion removes from the calorimeter response any dependence on the source spectrum. The ionisation chamber calibration factor is then only dependant on the chamber response. The direct MC conversion without a transfer chamber in graphite is also a novel method of realising absorbed dose to water from graphite calorimetry measurements. The second stage was to model a secondary standard chamber type NE 2561. The modelling of the energy correction factor kQ of a secondary standard NE 2561 chamber shows a difference of 0. 4 % between the Varian and Varian-matched Elekta beams. Although small, this is a significant discrepancy for primary standard calibrations. Ionisation chambers calibrated on the ARPANSA 6 MV beam may be in error by 0. 4 % when used on a Varian 6 MV beam. Similar variations may occur with other manufacturers. The work has also investigated the design of a custom flattening filter to precisely match the energy spectrum of the Varian beam on the Elekta platform. The Monte-Carlo investigation of the kQ of the secondary standard NE 2561 chamber was extended to consider the response with the new flattening filter free (FFF) modality. The kQ from a modelled Varian FFF beam showed a difference of 0. 8 % compared to the 6 MV Elekta with the same beam quality index, TPR 20, 10, (Tissue phantom ratio in water at depths of 20 and 10 cm), and the Elekta FFF beam showed a difference of 0. 6 %. The magnitude of the discrepancy between the Varian FFF beam and the ARPANSA Elekta beam demonstates that TPR 20, 10 is not sufficient as the sole beam quality specifier to derive calibration factors for flattening filter free beams, and even with standard clinical beams the use of TPR 20, 10 alone can introduce errors of 0. 4 %...|$|E
40|$|Absorbed dose {{to water}} {{calibrations}} of NE Technology Type 2561 chambers {{are carried out}} at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) in both X-radiation from 4 - 19 MV and in " 6 " 0 Co #gamma#-radiation. Secondary standard ion chambers are calibrated against the primary standard <b>graphite</b> <b>calorimeter</b> by inserting these chambers at reference depths in a water phantom. The {{first part of this}} report describes the work which was undertaken in an attempt to reproduce the measured absorbed dose calibration factors for a secondary standard NE 2561 ion chamber for a range of NPL photon qualities under standard calibration conditions. This calculated data did not reproduce the observed variation in calibration factor with beam filtration in the measured results. However, had this data been reproducible, in particular at 4 and 6 MV, then the possible causes of the observed variation in the measured results such as effects on the calibration due to chamber components would have been investigated. By comparing calibration factors and depth dose curves for NPL X-ray beams with a simulated clinical quality the practical impact on clinical dosimetry of these observed differences will be looked at. The majority of this work was carried out using Monte Carlo techniques based on the EGS 4 code system. The simulations were validated in several ways. Firstly, comparisons of calculated and measured depth dose curves in water were made at energies from 4 - 19 MV and in " 6 " 0 Co #gamma#-radiation. Then, data calculated with codes used in this work was compared with data produced by more well tested and well-established codes. The final validation method involved calculating the air kerma calibration factor of a NE 2561 ion chamber in 2 MV X-rays and then comparing the calculated ratio of 2 MV air kerma calibration factor to " 6 " 0 Co absorbed dose calibration factor with the measured value. The calculated normalised absorbed dose to water calibrations were found to agree with measured values of k_Q, the ratio of absorbed dose calibration in quality Q to that in " 6 " 0 Co, to within 1. 0 % (which corresponds to 2 #sigma# in the total uncertainty). The observed discrepancies were primarily random in nature. However, {{it was not possible to}} distinguish between the results for light and heavy filtration. This could have been due to large uncertainties on the calculated absorbed dose to water calibrations or to an undetected problem in the calculations or measurements. It was therefore not possible at this stage to investigate the observed change in calibration factor with beam filtration. The calculated calibration factor for a 6 MV X-ray beam from a Varian 2100 C does, however, lie close to the NPL curve for heavily filtered beams (with a TPR_ 2 _ 0 _/_ 1 _ 0 and depth dose curve similar to that of a NPL 6 MV (H) photon quality). The calculated and measured ratio of 2 MV air kerma. calibration factor to " 6 " 0 Co absorbed dose calibration factor agreed within 0. 66 % (which corresponds to less than 2 #sigma# in the total random uncertainty).

40|$|Trends in {{mortality}} rates from colorectal cancer {{during the second}} half of the 20 th century were analysed for 21 European countries and grouped in three broad European regions. For each gender, age-standardised (world standard population) {{mortality rates}} were computed by the direct method, and joinpoint analysis was used to identify significant changes in rates. A favourable pattern in colorectal cancer mortality for both genders was observed in most European countries from the 1990 s onwards. Colorectal cancer mortality rates were still in the upward direction in some Eastern European countries, as well as in some Mediterranean countries. Mortality rates tended to converge at around 20 / 100000 in men and around 11 / 100000 in women. This converging pattern is even clearer when colorectal mortality rates are examined in three broad European regions. Similar mortality rates over recent calendar years have been reached by countries where mortality has been decreasing in recent decades and in those countries (mainly Eastern European and Mediterranean countries) which have experienced a recent levelling-off and decrease. If recent trends are maintained, colorectal cancer mortality is likely to decline further in Europe in the current decade.

O. info:eu-repo/semantics/article article 2009 Medical Physics 3693891 - 3896 <![CDATA[PURPOSE: A helical tomotherapy accelerator presents a dosimetric challenge because, to this day, there is no internationally accepted protocol for the determination of the absolute dose. Because of this reality, we investigated the different alternatives for characterizing and measuring the absolute dose of such an accelerator. We tested several dosimetric techniques with various metrological traceabilities as well as using a number of phantoms in static and helical modes. METHODS: Firstly, the relationship between the reading of ionization chambers and the absorbed dose is dependent on the beam quality value of the photon beam. For high energy photons, the beam quality is specified by the tissue phantom ratio (TPR 20, 10) and it is therefore necessary to know the TPR 20, 10 to calculate the dose delivered by a given accelerator. This parameter is obtained through the ratio of the absorbed dose at 20 and 10 cm depths in water and was measured in the particular conditions of the tomotherapy accelerator. Afterward, measurements were performed using the ionization chamber (model A 1 SL) delivered as a reference instrument by the vendor. This chamber is traceable in absorbed dose to water in a Co- 60 beam to a water calorimeter of the American metrology institute (NIST). Similarly, in Switzerland, each radiotherapy department is directly traceable to the Swiss metrology institute (METAS) in absorbed dose to water based on a water calorimeter. For our research, this traceability was obtained by using an ionization chamber traceable to METAS (model NE 2611 A), which is the secondary standard of our institute. Furthermore, in order to have another fully independent measurement method, we determined the dose using alanine dosimeters provided by and traceable to the British metrology institute (NPL); they are calibrated in absorbed dose to water using a <b>graphite</b> <b>calorimeter.</b> And finally, we wanted to take into account the type of chamber routinely used in clinical practice and therefore measured the dose using a Farmer-type instrument (model NE 2571) as well. RESULTS: We found the tomotherapy TPR 20, 10 value to be around 0. 629, which is close to a 4 MV conventional linear accelerator value. During static irradiation, the secondary standard and the alanine dosimeters were compatible within 0. 5 %. The A 1 SL relative deviation to the secondary standard was 1. 2 % and the NE 2571 relative deviation to the secondary standard was - 1. 7 %. The measurement in dynamic helical mode found the different dosimeters compatible within 1. 4 % and the alanine dosimeters and the secondary standard were even found under 0. 2 %. CONCLUSIONS: We found that the different methods are all within uncertainties as well as globally coherent, and the specific limitations of the various dosimeters are discussed in order to help the medical physicist design an independent reference system. We demonstrated that, taking into account the particular reference conditions, one can use an ionization chamber calibrated for conventional linear accelerators to assert the absolute dose delivered by a tomotherapy accelerator...|$|E
