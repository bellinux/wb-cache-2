5000|$|The term may {{refer to}} markets in things of value other than securities. For example, {{the ability to}} buy and sell {{intellectual}} property such as patents, or rights to musical compositions, is considered a secondary market because it allows the owner to freely resell property entitlements issued by the government. [...] Similarly, secondary markets can be said to exist in some real estate contexts as well (e.g. ownership shares of time-share vacation homes are bought and sold outside of the official <b>exchange</b> <b>set</b> up by the timeshare issuers). These have very similar functions as secondary stock and bond markets in allowing for speculation, providing liquidity, and financing through securitization. It facilitates liquidity and marketability of the long term instrument. It also provides instant valuation of securities caused by changes in the environment.|$|E
5000|$|The coal {{industry}} in Wales has {{played an important}} role in the Industrial Revolution in Wales. Coal mining expanded in the eighteenth century to provide fuel for the blast furnaces of the iron and copper industries that were expanding in South Wales. The industry had reached large proportions by the end of that century, and then further expanded to supply steam-coal for the steam vessels that were beginning to trade around the world. The Cardiff Coal <b>Exchange</b> <b>set</b> the world price for steam-coal and Cardiff became a major coal-exporting port. The South Wales Coalfield was at its peak in 1913 and was one of the largest coalfields in the world. It remained the largest coalfield in Britain until 1925. The supply of coal dwindled, and pits closed in spite of a UK-wide strike against closures. The last deep mine in Wales, Tower Colliery, closed in 2008, after thirteen years as a co-operative owned by its miners.|$|E

5000|$|In 1964 on the {{occasion}} of the 50th anniversary of the Goethe University Frankfurt, some banks, in particular private bankers and the Frankfurt Stock <b>Exchange,</b> <b>set</b> up a fund for establishing a research institute. 1967 the institute was founded under the name Institut für Kapitalmarktforschung (IFK). The institute is, still today, financed by the Gesellschaft für Kapitalmarktforschung e.V. (GfK) which was founded in the same year. Among the more than 80 members of GfK are banks, insurances, consultancy companies and industrial enterprises. The institute was the first research institute in Germany dedicated solely to capital market issues. 1996 the institute was given the additional name Center for Financial Studies to reflect the increasingly international orientation of its research activities. Since 2001 this has become its sole name. In 2005 the CFS in cooperation with Goethe University Frankfurt for the first time awarded [...] "The Deutsche Bank Prize in Financial Economics" [...] to an internationally renowned researcher. In 2006 the former Chief Economist of the European Central Bank, Otmar Issing, became president of the CFS.|$|E
5000|$|Gold {{trading was}} {{significant}} for the U.S.'s foreign trade, {{but the majority of}} trading on the Exchange was speculative. Historian John Steele Gordon notes that [...] "hundreds of pure speculators" [...] traded at Gilpin's, but that [...] "respectable merchants who needed gold for business purposes or to hedge against fluctuations in the price of greenbacks" [...] also traded there. Business historian Robert Sobel has called the gold exchange [...] "the most informal and certainly the wildest market in American history" [...] because of its wild profit and loss swings, its high rate of bankruptcy and frequent occurrences of [...] "short-changing, adulteration, and late delivery" [...] of gold. After a series of robberies of gold, brokers at the <b>exchange</b> <b>set</b> up a system of private certificates which could be drawn upon deposits at the Bank of New York. As a result of the arrangement, the Bank of New York became the second-largest holder of gold in the nation, after the U.S. federal government. In 1865, however, E. B. Ketchum of Ketchum, Son & Co. forged more than $1.5 million certificates and then fled; this and other such episodes prompted the establishment of a Gold Exchange Bank, with daily account reserve statements and other anti-fraud measures.|$|E

40|$|Pricing {{the default}} risk {{is a hot}} {{challenge}} for every risk manager. The problem is tackled {{in the framework of}} the zero-utility principle. According to Pratt (1964), an approximation of the risk premium should be proportional to the Arrow-Pratt absolute risk aversion coefficient and the variance. Is that still true as a default risk is concerned? The answer appears to be negative, because the variance does not look to be an appropriate tool for asymmetrical risk. On the other hand, fear of ruin coefficient and probability of default are proved to be well-tailored tools for a preliminary pricing.
