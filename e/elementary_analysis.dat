In {{case you}} cannot gather a fleur-de-lys leaf, I have drawn for you, in Plate VI., {{a cluster of}} such leaves, which are as pretty as any, and so small that, missing the points of a few, I can draw them of their actual size. You see the pretty {{alternate}} interlacing at the bottom, {{and if you can}} draw at all, and will try to outline their curves, you will find what subtle lines they are. I did not know this name for the strong-edged grass leaves when I wrote the pieces about shield and sword leaves in 'Modern Painters'; I wish I had chanced in those passages on some other similitude, but I can't alter them now, and my trustful pupils may avoid all confusion of thought by putting gladius for ensis, and translating it by the word 'scymitar,' which is also more accurate in expressing the curvature blade. So we will call the ensatæ, instead, 'gladiolæ,' translating, 'scymitar-grasses.' And having {164} now got at some clear idea of the distinction between outlaid and inlaid growth in the stem, the reader will find the <b>elementary</b> <b>analysis</b> of forms resulting from outlaid growth in 'Modern Painters'; and I mean to republish it in the sequel of this book, but must go on to other matters here. The growth of the inlaid stem we will follow as far as we need, for English plants, in examining the glasses.|$|E

While {{all of the}} other left groups {{identified}} with various communist countries, the Soviet Union, China, Albania, Cuba, etc., the CLP insisted on being politically independent and developing their own analysis of the economic and political situation. In the Political Resolution at this Congress it stated, [...] "The struggle within the socialist camp is increasingly taking a national form - a form that makes ever more difficult the militant expressions of solidarity of the revolutionary proletariat within the socialist sector.” And, [...] "Our Party … does not choose national sides in this ... struggle that is taking place within the socialist camp.

50|$|Nutrient status (mineral {{nutrient}} {{and trace}} element composition, also called ionome and nutrient profile) of plants are commonly portrayed by tissue <b>elementary</b> <b>analysis.</b> Interpretation {{of the results}} of such studies, however, has been controversial. During the last decades the nearly two-century-old “law of minimum” or “Liebig's law” (that states that plant growth is controlled not by the total amount of resources available, but by the scarcest resource) has been replaced by several mathematical approaches that use different models in order to take the interactions between the individual nutrients into account. The latest developments in this field are {{based on the fact that}} the nutrient elements (and compounds) do not act independently from each other; Baxter, 2015, because there may be direct chemical interactions between them or they may influence each other’s uptake, translocation, and biological action via a number of mechanisms as exemplified for the case of ammonia.|$|E

The importance of certain network components has been demonstrated in Systems Biology, but there are opportunities for all disciplines using network-based approaches to identify which parts of systems (networks) are particularly important. In Systems Biology <b>elementary</b> mode <b>analysis</b> is used to decompose complex metabolic networks into simpler units that perform a coherent function (Stelling et al., 2002), for example, the minimal set of enzymes that can support steady-state operation of cellular metabolism.

40|$|Could <b>{{elementary}}</b> complex <b>analysis,</b> {{which covers}} the {{topics such as}} algebra of complex numbers, elementary complex functions, complex differentiation and integration, series expansions of complex functions, residues and singularities, and introduction to conformal mappings, be made more elementary? In this paper we demonstrate that a little reorientation of existing <b>elementary</b> complex <b>analysis</b> brings a lot of benefits, including operating with single-valued logarithmic and power functions, making the Cauchy integral formula {{as a part of}} fundamental theorem of calculus, removal of residues and singularities, etc. Implicitly, this reorientation consists of resolving the multivalued nature of complex logarithm by considering its Riemann surface. But instead of the advanced mathematical concepts such as manifolds, differential forms, integration on manifolds, etc, which are necessary for introducing complex analysis in Riemann surfaces, we use rather elementary methods of multiplicative calculus. We think that such a reoriented <b>elementary</b> complex <b>analysis</b> could be especially successful as a first course in complex analysis for the students of engineering, physics, even applied mathematics programs who indeed do not see a second and more advanced course in complex analysis. It would be beneficial for the students of pure mathematics programs as well because it is more appropriate introduction to complex analysis on Riemann surfaces rather than the existing one.
