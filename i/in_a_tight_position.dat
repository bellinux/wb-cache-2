Movement was usually single file; the leading section rotated but was organised with two lead scouts, followed by its commander and then the remainder in a fire support group.

Poor maps meant navigation was important; however, the local knowledge of the Border Scouts in Borneo compensated for the poor maps. so tracks were sometimes used unless ambush was considered possible, or there was the possibility of mines.

5000|$|As a rule, {{the leader}} mostly {{stays in the}} slot, leaving it only {{to make room for}} the {{follower}} to pass by. The leader almost never makes the follower circle around when passing by; they may go into a common rotational figure when the follower happens to come close, but such figures are usually <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>tight</b> <b>position</b> and do not change the overall [...] "slotted" [...] appearance.|$|E
5000|$|In the Prehistoric Egypt, {{bodies were}} buried in deserts because they would {{naturally}} be preserved by dehydration. The [...] "graves" [...] were small oval or rectangular pits dug in the sand. They could give {{the body of the}} deceased <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>tight</b> <b>position</b> on its left side alongside a few jars of food and drink and slate palettes with magical religious spells. The size of graves eventually increased but according to status and wealth. The dry, desert conditions were a benefit in ancient Egypt for burials of the poor, who could not afford the complex burial preparations that the wealthy had.|$|E
50|$|The Conservatives had {{not really}} had time to prepare their campaign, {{although}} it was more professional than previously. There had been little time for Heath to become well known among the British public, having led the party for just eight months before the election. For the Liberals, money was an issue: two elections {{in the space of}} just two years had left the party <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>tight</b> financial <b>position.</b>|$|R

50|$|Murray {{had married}} again in 1860, fathering two more {{children}} (see below). He {{was never a}} conspicuously prudent caretaker of his personal finances, and he continued to live beyond his means after his remarriage. His financial position worsened during the mid-1860s when disease devastated his sheep flocks, and {{he was forced to}} auction the contents of Winderradeen's library to pay off debts. At one point, Murray's creditors had bailiffs dispatched to Winderradeen to seize valuable items from the homestead. In fact, Murray was only saved from bankruptcy (and automatic removal from his seat in parliament) by the generosity of a few of his colleagues, who loaned him money. He would remain, however, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>tight</b> fiscal <b>position</b> {{for the rest of his}} life, even though the trustees of Winderradeen finally consented to the sale of the property at the end of the 1860s, when an acceptable offer was made for it.|$|R
50|$|Though Nuremberg was {{successful}} in placing the ban, the city took it too far by trying to urge all powers in Germany to support the ban and assist with its execution. This put the nobles <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>tight</b> <b>position,</b> as it would give too much power to the city. Because of this, a move was made to lift the ban and {{was successful}} despite the city's attempt to stop the nobles. After the ban was appealed {{and the rest of}} the empire looked away, Schott went back and attacked the villages that were under Nuremberg's protection, which caused Schott's reputation to drop to deeper depths.|$|E

5000|$|The Islanders {{were later}} matched up against {{regional}} powerhouse L.D. Alajuelense of Costa Rica in the preliminary {{round of the}} CONCACAF Champions League. The first leg of the series was played on August 27, 2008 in the Alajuelense home ground, the Estadio Alejandro Morera Soto {{and in front of}} 900 spectators, the game ended with a hard fought 1:1 draw. The second leg was played on September 3, and it took the Islanders two late goals to come from behind and win the game 2-1; with an aggregate of 3:2, the Islanders advanced to the group stage, being placed in Group D, which included Club Santos Laguna, Tauro F.C., and C.S.D. Municipal. In the first game of this round, the team defeated Tauro F.C. by one goal, with a final score of 2:1. On September 23, the Islanders defeated Santos Laguna, 3:1. In the third game, the team tied with Municipal with two goals each. On the return matches, the team lost to Santos FC 3:0 in Torreón, Mexico playing with their [...] "bench" [...] team preparing for their respective USL semi-finals matches. After in a close game back in Puerto Rico it was C.S.D. Municipal's turn in a 0:1 loss with a goal {{near the end of the}} match. These two losses had the team <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>tight</b> <b>position</b> as they were also going through their USL finals match. It was a must win situation for the last match against Tauro F.C. in Panama or at least a tie in order to qualify for the next stage in the tournament. On October 29, 2008 Islanders FC vs Tauro F.C. ended in a battled 2:2 match which resulted in favor of Islanders FC and qualified them for the final eight of the CONCACAF Champions League. On December 10, 2008, the Islanders were paired against C.D. Marathón in the final eight draft. On February 26, 2009, the team defeated C.D. Marathón 2:1, playing at Juan Ramón Loubriel Stadium. In the second date of this stage, they pulled off a last-minute victory, one goal to none, in a game that took place at San Pedro Sula. On March 17, 2009, The Islanders defeated Cruz Azul, two goals to none, in the first leg of the semifinals in Bayamón. On the second leg, played on April 7, 2009, Cruz Azul won 2:0 and drove the game into extra time, where it ended 3:1, the away goal not being a tie breaker because the away goals rule do not apply in extra time in CONCACAF. The game was decided on penalties and ended 4:2 in favor of Cruz Azul.|$|E
50|$|The 2009 {{season was}} one of great upheaval. <b>In</b> <b>an</b> {{increasingly}} <b>tight</b> economic <b>position,</b> LSK sold or released 11 players {{before and during the}} season, with Berg also restructuring the squad and bringing in new talent. Enormous injury problems also made the start to the season a difficult one for Berg's charges. After 9 games, LSK had won none and drawn four and seemed destined for relegation. An impressive comeback saw Lillestrøm deliver a strong second half to the season, eventually finishing 11th. Newcomer Nosa Igiebor had an especially impressive first season in the Lillestrøm jersey.|$|R
25|$|However, New England retook {{the lead}} on their next drive, {{advancing}} 68 yards {{with the aid of}} a pair of completions from Brady to Givens for gains of 18 and 25 yards. Once again the Patriots were faced with third down and goal, but this time they scored with Brady's 1-yard pass to Vrabel, who had lined up <b>in</b> <b>an</b> eligible <b>tight</b> end <b>position.</b> Then on a two-point conversion attempt, running back Kevin Faulk took a direct snap and ran into the end zone to make the score 29–22. Despite amassing over 1,000 combined yards, Faulk's two-point conversion constituted the only points he scored all season.|$|R
50|$|In the 62nd minute, Billy Bremner {{was denied}} from five metres by a reflex of Sepp Maier in the Bayern goal. Less {{than a minute}} later a goal by Peter Lorimer was disallowed, due to Bremner being <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>tight</b> passive offside <b>position</b> <b>in</b> front of the goal at the six-yard box. Referee Michel Kitabdjian {{initially}} pointed to the centre circle (indicating a goal) and then Beckenbauer convinced him to consult with the linesman who had run back to the halfway line and had not raised his flag. Thereupon, the referee incorrectly indicated offside against Bremner. This decision caused riots to break out as 'people realised that they were really being cheated'.|$|R
40|$|Radical {{changes during}} the past century not only {{effected}} the broad global society, but also church life. Dwindeling numbers of membership and lesser church attendance show that worldwide secularization has put the church <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>tight</b> <b>position.</b> On the other hand, there is currently renewed interest in spiritual life. This tendency gives Christianity and the church as such the opportunity {{to come forward with}} new and creative ways to convey the message of the gospel. One of the focus points should be to rediscover and renew the worship service, as it is still the main function of the church. Post modern ways of life and thinking should together with the eternal Word of God be the prime factors of rethinking worship. With mainly these arguments in mind, this study attempts to develop a design by which creative and effective worship services can be planned. Because the Bible as Gods Word is central in reformed theological thinking {{as well as in the}} whole spectrum of such church life, that will be the basis. As far as the worship service is concerned, the text for the sermon is held to be not only the focus point but actually the source from which all the liturgical elements develop. The study starts off with an overview of current tendencies. Chapter 2 deals with the research work being an empirical survey as well as a literature study. Results of the empirical survey is dealt with throughout the study. Chapter 3 discusses the whole issue of the presence of God in the church service. After an overview of this phenomenon in different eras of church history, it concludes with the outcome that God’s presence is firstly a historical fact and secondly a means of communication during a certain event. This can be experienced because the worshiper is a person with a certain human makup who lives in a particular time and space. In Chapter 4 the issue of the hermeneutical process comes into view. It deals with the Word in context and feels in the end at home in the presence of the textual communicative approach of a person such as Paul Ricoeur. The tendencies of the post modern time is also discussed. Chapter 5 focuses on liturgy itself and leads to the point where liturgy is actually the merging of Gods message with the message of the congregation. The final chapter develops the liturgical model which we can call the liturgical design where the text for the sermon is the viewpoint. Dissertation (MA(Teologie)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2007.

Despite amassing over 1,000 combined yards, Kevin Faulk's two-point conversion constituted the only points he scored all season. The Panthers countered on their next possession. Foster started the drive with a 9-yard run and a 7-yard reception. After that, Delhomme completed a 19-yard pass to Muhammad, followed by a 31-yard completion to receiver Ricky Proehl. Ironically, Proehl, who caught the fourth quarter game-tying touchdown pass against the Patriots in Super Bowl XXXVI 2 years earlier for the St. Louis Rams, finished the drive with a 12-yard touchdown reception. Kasay's ensuing extra point tied the game, 29-29, with 1:08 to play in regulation and it appeared that the game would be the first Super Bowl ever to go into overtime.|$|R

50|$|Because {{of diverse}} {{positions}} and sorts of power {{inside of a}} line-and-staff association, rivalry {{in the middle of}} line and staff faculty is practically unpreventable. Though insignificant clash because of contrasts in perspectives is characteristic, clash with respect to line and staff faculty can upset a whole association. There is a large number of possible reasons for a conflict between the Line and Staff Function. Poor human relations, covering power and obligation, and abuse of staff faculty by top administration are all essential explanations behind sentiments of hatred in the middle of line and staff work force. This hatred can bring about different divisions seeing the association from <b>a</b> <b>tight</b> <b>position</b> as opposed to taking a gander at the association overall.|$|R

The Confederates won the day on March 31 at Dinwiddie Court House by pushing the Union cavalry into <b>a</b> <b>tight</b> <b>position.</b> But when Warren {{heard the sound of}} the distant battle receding toward Dinwiddie Court House, he sent Brigadier General Joseph J. Bartlett's brigade of Griffin's division to reinforce Sheridan and attack Pickett's force on its flank.
