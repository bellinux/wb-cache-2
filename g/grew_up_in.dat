50|$|There is {{consensus}} in the literature about {{the negative consequences of}} <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> single-parent homes on educational attainment and success. Children <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> single-parent homes are more likely to not finish school and generally obtain fewer years of schooling than those in two-parent homes. Specifically, boys <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> homes with only their mothers are more likely to receive poorer grades and display behavioral problems.|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} we {{investigate}} {{whether there are differences}} between adolescents who <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> single-parent families and those who <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> nucleus families. We have decided that there are no differences in the physical development between the adolescents who are <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> single parent families and those <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> nucleus families. There is no difference in the self-concept between these two groups, except in the ethical and moral self-image of adolescents living with one parent. Adolescents living in single-parent families have a weaker moral self-image. It can thus be concluded that physical development and positive self-concept (a favorable image of oneself) in adolescents do not depend on whether an adolescent is <b>growing</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a single-parent or a nucleus family, but on the different characteristics of parents and their relationship with children, whether they are married or not. For the children development the best is healthy marriage of their parents...|$|R
