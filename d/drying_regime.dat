40|$|Particulate {{coatings}} {{are commonly}} used for applications such as paper coatings and functional layers in fuel cells and batteries. The properties and performance of particulate coatings depend on their microstructure. Hence, characterizing the particle distribution through the thickness of a coating during drying leads to useful information for microstructure design. Past researchers have modeled the competitive effects of evaporation and diffusion, and evaporation, diffusion and convection induced by Marangoni effects {{on the distribution of}} particles during drying. 1, 2 In this research, the 1 D conservation equation for the drying of particulate coatings, including diffusion, evaporation, and sedimentation, is used and solved using COMSOL. The effect of particle concentration on diffusion and sedimentation 3, 4 is included. From the results, <b>drying</b> <b>regime</b> maps are constructed. To draw <b>drying</b> <b>regime</b> maps, two dimensionless variables, Pe, and Gr, are used, and accumulation zones are noted. The Peclet number, Pe, describes the strength of evaporation vs. diffusion of the particle, and the gravity number, Gr, is the rate of sedimentation divided by the rate of evaporation. A <b>drying</b> <b>regime</b> map is divided into three parts – evaporation, sedimentation, and diffusion dominant regions. As Gr is increased, at constant high Pe, there is...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Collapse-type {{shrinkage}} is {{the greatest}} obstacle to prevent planted eucalypts from being used for solid wood products. In {{order to make the}} suitable drying schedules for high effective utilization of eucalypt wood, the total shrinkage and collapse on two species of difficult-to-dry E. urophylla and E. grandis wood under continuous and intermittent drying regimes were measured. The results show that total shrinkage and collapse in both eucalypts exhibited higher values for continuous drying than intermittent drying. With increasing drying temperature, total shrinkage and collapse increase in both drying regimes, while the increasing magnitude of both parameters becomes apparently larger for continuous drying than intermittent <b>drying</b> <b>regime,</b> in particular higher temperature condition. Properly elevating drying temperature {{to make up for the}} intermittent-waiting time may be allowed for intermittent <b>drying</b> <b>regime.</b> Drying duration at each intermittent drying period has a greater effect on total shrinkage and collapse of eucalypt wood. When more than a drying duration of 6 hours at an intermittent drying period is used, the differences in shrinkage and collapse between both drying regimes are very slight. Intermittent duration at an intermittent drying period has a comparatively larger effect on total shrinkage and collapse. Accordingly, we may draw a conclusion that intermittent <b>drying</b> <b>regime</b> is very likely to be a potential drying one suitable for collapse-prone lower-density plantation-grown eucalypt wood...|$|E
40|$|The use {{of digital}} {{tensiometers}} {{to control the}} irrigation of nursery stock in containers was studied over a three year period. Over this time the tensiometers performed satisfactorily and successfully automated the irrigation of the plants. The results indicate the feasibility of using them to control nursery stock irrigation under Irish conditions. An irrigation tension of 50 hPa to trigger an irrigation period resulted in larger plants than those grown under <b>drier</b> <b>regimes</b> with irrigation tensions of 100 and 200 hPa. Measurements of stomatal resistance indicated that the plants in the <b>drier</b> <b>regimes</b> were growing under greater moisture stress. The <b>drier</b> <b>regimes</b> {{reduced the number of}} irrigations and also the overall usage of water. They reduced plant size but did not impair plant appearance. It may be possible to use this approach in the future to control plant growth. There was no difference in performance between plants gown with ebb and flood irrigation and those irrigated via overhead spraylines.

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{study is}} carried out to investigate the influence of multistage <b>drying</b> <b>regimes</b> on the <b>drying</b> kinematics of a porous material. In particular the effects of varying {{the conditions of the}} drying medium are studied. The drying model for the solid is developed based on the continuum approach. A series of simulations of the drying behaviour of a rectangular brick with varying temperature, heat transfer coefficient and relative humidity of the drying medium are undertaken. It is found that the total drying time is mainly dependent on the relative humidity of the drying medium. Also condensation is predicted {{on the surface of the}} brick, with the quantity of condensation being directly linked to the relative humidity and temperature of the drying medium. Overall it is concluded that multistage <b>drying</b> <b>regimes</b> are useful in reducing the overall drying time whilst avoiding detrimental shrinkage during the constant drying period...|$|R

40|$|Mycotoxin {{producing}} fungi {{are natural}} contaminants of cereals and their toxins are harmful to humans and animals. Ochratoxin A (OTA) {{is among the}} most important. Heat treatment by drum drying does not eliminate already formed mycotoxins but the technique can reduce the number of viable fungi on the grain. The aim {{of this study was to}} establish a <b>drying</b> <b>regime</b> that kills fungal propagules on rye without reducing its quality for baking. Special attention was paid to some important mycotoxin producing species. As drying temperatures and retention time in the drum are essential, the drum drier must be equipped with an effective control unit. Two different control systems were tested. The results showed that fungi colonising the grain can be much more efficiently and precisely reduced by controlling the maximum grain temperature (MGT) than the fixed constant drying air temperature (FAT). Drum drying very efficiently reduced the fungal propagules colonising the grain, including the mycotoxin producing Penicillium verrucosum, Fusarium avenaceum, F. culmorum, F. poae, F. sporotrichioides and F. tricinctum. Both temperature and retention time in the drum affected survival rate of the fungi. Using MGT, a retention time of 10. 5 min and a temperature of 64 ºC killed 99 % of the yeast propagules and 98 % of the filamentous fungi. Moisture contents were reduced to about 12 %. A similar <b>drying</b> <b>regime</b> in a supplementary trial reduced the number of P. verrucosum contaminated kernels from more than 70 % to 12 % but confirmed that drum drying did not destroy already formed OTA. The combination of a high drying capacity and a short but efficient heat treatment was obtained by drum drying as opposed to on-floor, batch and ordinary continuous flow drying, and it reduced the risk of mould deterioration to almost zero when the grain was properly stored afterwards. At the same time a high quality for baking was maintained. The highest baking quality in rye was obtained at grain temperatures of about 62 °C and only at grain temperatures above 70 °C visual quality changes were detected...|$|E

40|$|A hidden state Markov (HSM) {{model is}} {{developed}} as a new approach for generating hydroclimatic time series with long-term persistence. The two-state HSM model is motivated {{by the fact that}} the interaction of global climatic mechanisms produces alternating wet and <b>dry</b> <b>regimes</b> in Australian hydroclimatic time series. The HSM model provides an explicit mechanism to stochastically simulate these quasi-cyclic wet and dry periods. This is conceptually sounder than the current stochastic models used for hydroclimatic time series simulation. Models such as the lag-one autoregressive (AR(1)) model have no explicit mechanism for simulating the wet and <b>dry</b> <b>regimes.</b> In this study the HSM model was calibrated to four long-term Australian hydroclimatic data sets. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo method known as the Gibbs sampler was used for model calibration. The results showed that the locations significantly influenced by tropical weather systems supported the assumptions of the HSM modeling framework and indicated a strong persistence structure. In contrast, the calibration of the AR(1) model to these data sets produced no statistically significant evidence of persistence...|$|R

40|$|The Western US states Washington (WA), Oregon (OR) and California (CA) {{experienced}} {{extremely high}} temperatures in June 2015. The temperature anomalies were so extreme that they cannot be explained with global warming alone. We investigate {{the hypothesis that}} soil moisture {{played an important role}} as well. We use a land surface model and a large ensemble from the weather@home modelling effort to investigate the coupling between soil moisture and temperature in a warming world. Both models show that May was anomalously dry, satisfying a prerequisite for the extreme heat wave, and they indicate that WA and OR are in a wet-to-dry transitional soil moisture regime. We use two different land surface–atmosphere coupling metrics to show that there was strong coupling between temperature, latent heat flux and the effect of soil moisture deficits on the energy balance in June 2015 in WA and OR. June temperature anomalies conditioned on wet/dry conditions show that both the mean and extreme temperatures become hotter for dry soils, especially in WA and OR. Fitting a Gaussian model to temperatures using soil moisture as a covariate shows that the June 2015 temperature values fit well in the extrapolated empirical temperature/drought lines. The high temperature anomalies in WA and OR are thus to be expected, given the dry soil moisture conditions and that those regions are in the transition from a wet to a <b>dry</b> <b>regime.</b> CA is already in the <b>dry</b> <b>regime</b> and therefore the necessity of taking soil moisture into account is of lower importance. </p...|$|R

The study was conducted with clayey acid sulphate soil under controlled conditions with treatments lasting up to 24 weeks and measurements made in the top 0 – 60 mm of soil. pH profiles in the soil were strongly dependent on soil moisture and the pattern of irrigation. When bare soil was allowed to dry down without further irrigation, there was very little acidification of either the surface or subsurface layers. Planting of Phragmites accelerated soil drying and caused extensive cracking and acidification of the subsoil under simulated drought conditions.

Also, a number of field studies of two of the Rana species’ were analysed for the same aspect. The U-shaped pattern was much rarer but it did occur. A positive linear slope, rather than a negative one, was also found occasionally. A large number of factors affect the growth and development rates in tadpoles, adaptively and non-adaptively, and thus determine their size at the time of metamorphosis. How these can contribute to the found metamorphosis patterns is discussed...|$|E

Breeding nitrogen efficient cultivars without sacrificing rice yield potential, improving grain fill in later-flowering inferior spikelets and enhancing harvest index are three important approaches to achieving the dual goal of high grain yield and high resource use efficiency.

Enhancing sink activity through increasing sugar-spikelet ratio at the heading time and enhancing the conversion efficiency from sucrose to starch though increasing the ratio of abscisic acid to ethylene in grains during grain fill could effectively improve grain fill in inferior spikelets. Several practices, such as post-anthesis controlled soil drying, an alternate wetting and moderate soil <b>drying</b> <b>regime</b> during the whole growing season, and non-flooded straw mulching cultivation, could substantially increase grain yield and water use efficiency, mainly via enhanced remobilization of stored carbon from vegetative tissues to grains and improved harvest index.

The capillary rise and drying experiments reveal complex moisture movement over time and space. Under conditions of constant moisture supply, accelerated drying results in maintained or enhanced capillary rise.

The ultimate {{aim of this study}} was to form calcium phosphate (CaP) based matrices as bone grafts for medical applications. Amongst CaP based materials, CaP gels made by the sol-gel process have attracted much interest since they can be processed at room temperature allowing the incorporation of environmentally sensitive molecules such as growth factors. CaP gels can be engineered by changing process conditions. There is little previous work however on the effect of <b>drying</b> <b>regimes</b> on the CaP materials formed using the sol-gel process. The objectives of this research were to investigate the influence of drying conditions on the physicochemical properties of CaP gels and the effect of the resultant structures of CaP gels on the function of the incorporated therapeutic molecules. In addition, surface modification of the CaP gels was investigated as a means to enhance biological interaction and also a potential way of creating primary bonds between apatite crystals enabling mechanical reinforcement of the material, which is currently too weak to bear load. This work has confirmed that different <b>drying</b> <b>regimes</b> have a significant influence on the formation of the gel pore structure, with the storage of gel in humid conditions, enabling reprecipitation of an apatitic phase. This variation in pore structure has a significant influence on the catalytic of encapsulated enzymes.

Particle size, dynamic light scattering, differential scanning calorimetry, SEM–energy dispersive X-ray, and spectrophotometric methods were used for MP characterization. C–Pd-loaded MP were optimized preliminarily by experimental design and compared with Ofx–Pd-loaded MP investigated in our previous work. Morphology of feedstock particles had a dominant role in determining MP morphology. The Charlesworth and Marshall theory was used to explain such behavior. The smaller and homogeneous C–Pd microparticulates favored MP inflation and buckling by forming a thick and nonporous shell. A percolation effect was proposed for the larger and irregular Ofx–Pd particles that produced smaller MP with a more porous shell. Increasing feedstock concentration led to higher particle loss. A tentative descriptive scheme of MP formation according to feedstock particle arrangement was proposed. This work suggested that spray-drying of drug dispersions should carefully consider the morphology of feedstock particles as a major parameter influencing final MP properties...|$|E

One {{of the main}} advantages of microwave technology is the volumetric principle of {{energy transfer}}. Based on this fact, the gradients of moisture content and temperature are identical and when the wood is dried it helps transport moisture from porous material and it also helps and transport free water whit lumen of cells.

The specimens are subjected to cyclic wetting and <b>drying</b> <b>regime</b> for eight weeks. In wet cycle the specimens are immersed in water containing 3. 5 % (by wt.) NaCl salt for four days, while in dry cycle the specimens are placed in open air for three days. The corrosion activity is monitored by measuring the copper/copper sulphate (Cu/CuSO 4) half-cell potential according to ASTM C- 876. The chloride penetration depth and sorptivity of all seven concretes are also measured. Results show that the geopolymer concretes exhibited better corrosion resistance than OPC concrete. The higher the amount of Na 2 SiO 3 and higher the concentration of NaOH solutions, the better the corrosion resistance of geopolymer concrete is. Similar behaviour is also observed in sorptivity and chloride penetration depth measurements. Generally, the geopolymer concretes exhibited lower sorptivity and chloride penetration depth than that of OPC concrete...|$|E
40|$|Monitoring {{continued}} on weight changes in marble and limestone briquettes {{exposed to the}} outdoor environment at sites in the eastern US. This report presents data for the exposure period 1988 - 1992 and summarizes results for the entire period from 1984. Since 1989, only three exposure sites have remained active, but briquettes from pre-exposed material were added at those sites. A linear relationship was found between cumulative gravimetric losses and exposure period. These losses resulted in an average recession rate of 11 to 21 micrometers/yr for marble and 21 to 45 micrometers/yr for limestone. The recession rates are site-dependent and can be described with respect to rain depth and other atmospheric conditions, {{as evidenced by the}} very low rates at the Ohio site on the movable rack, <b>dry</b> <b>regime.</b> Weight monitoring is continuing in a planned 10 -year program...|$|R
40|$|Population {{size and}} sex ratios of Pratylenchus alleni in {{soybeans}} were studied trader two different moisture regimes in Hagener loamy fine sand. Soil moisture was maintained from field capacity to 50 % below field {{capacity in the}} <b>dry</b> <b>regime</b> and from field capacity to 25 % above field capacity in the wet regime. The initial peak of colonization of soybeans by P. alleni was in the top 5 -cm of taproot 14 days after seeding. There were more P. alleni per unit length of taproot in the dry than in the wet regime during the first 7 days, and this trend continued in the top 5 -cm of the taproot for 21 days. Nematode density was greater in taproots than in fibrous roots. The ratio of males to females recovered from roots was significantly higher in the dry than in the wet regime...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a study performed to develop a computational model of cooling ceiling systems. This one has to be used in situ, as diagnosis tool in commissioning process {{in order to determine the}} main operating conditions of the system in cooling mode. The model considers the cooling ceiling as a fin. Only the <b>dry</b> <b>regime</b> is considered. From ceiling and room dimensions, material description of the cooling ceiling and measurement of supply water mass flow rate and air and water temperatures, the model calculates the cooling ceiling capacity, ceiling surface average temperature and water exhaust temperature. Fin efficiency, mixed convection close to the cooling ceiling (generated by the ventilation system) and panel perforations influence are studied. A series of experimental results (Laboratory test conditions) got on four types of cooling ceilings are used in order to validate the model...|$|R
