This can be physical damage, as in St Helen's Smelting Co v Tipping, or discomfort and inconvenience. The test for remoteness of damage in nuisance is reasonable foreseeability, as established in Cambridge Water Co Ltd v Eastern Counties Leather plc; if the defendant was using their land unreasonably and causing a nuisance, the defendant is liable even if they used reasonable care to avoid creating a nuisance. The test <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> nuisance was reasonably foreseeable; if it was, the defendant is expected to avoid it.|$|E

Medical specialty professional organizations recommend against the use of PET scans, CT scans, or bone scans when a physician stages early prostate cancer with low risk for metastasis. Those tests would be appropriate in such cases as when a CT scan evaluates spread within the pelvis, a bone scan look for spread to the bones, and endorectal coil magnetic resonance imaging to closely evaluate the prostatic capsule and the seminal vesicles. Bone scans should reveal osteoblastic appearance due to increased bone density in the areas of bone metastasis—opposite to what is found in many other cancers that metastasize.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the major}} {{concerns}} with same sex marriage <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> children of these families will grow up positively and have similar lives compared to children with heterosexual parents. The {{purpose of this article}} was to understand how undergraduate students perceived and understood the idea of same-sex families. Each student was given a scenario of a family birthday party, except the couple in one scenario was same sex oriented while the other was not. The scenarios depicted that there was a fight between the parents and grandparents, and gave little information about what the fight was about. The experiment resulted in students believing that the fight was related to the sexual orientation of the same-sex couple. All in all, the conductors of the experiment found no correlation between specific variables conducted in the study such as relationships between family and peers. The conductors of the experiment also found in their results that the children of same sex families grow into adulthood just as happy and optimistic as children with heterosexual parents do. This study depicts a positive response regarding the concern of the well being of same sex families.|$|E

Brown, however, rejected his overtures, saying Motley should instead look for work at a steel mill – the very career football was his ticket out of. Unable to find coaching opportunities in the NFL, {{he worked as a}} whisky salesman in the early 1960s. He got occasional scouting assignments from the Browns, but as the Civil Rights Movement began to coalesce in 1965, he issued a statement saying he had been refused a permanent coaching position by the team numerous times. He applied for a coaching job in 1964, he wrote, and was told that there were no vacancies. The Browns then hired Bob Nussbaumer as an assistant.

2500|$|There {{are several}} active {{research}} areas involving the neutrino. International scientific collaborations install large neutrino detectors near nuclear reactors or in neutrino beams from particle accelerators to better constrain the neutrino masses {{and the values}} for the magnitude and rates of oscillations between neutrino flavors. These experiments are thereby searching {{for the existence of}} CP violation in the neutrino sector; that <b>is,</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> laws of physics treat neutrinos and antineutrinos differently. The KATRIN experiment in Germany will begin to acquire data in 2017 to determine the value of the mass of the electron neutrino, with other approaches to this problem in the planning stages. Other efforts search for evidence of a sterile neutrino, a fourth neutrino flavor that does not interact with matter like the three known neutrino flavors. There are also experiments searching for neutrinoless double-beta decay, which, if it exists, would violate lepton number conservation, and imply a minuscule splitting or difference between the physical masses of what are now conventionally called a “neutrino” and corresponding “antineutrino”, with opposite signs of lepton number. Thus, they could no longer be mutual antiparticles, and each of the resulting six distinct neutrinos would have no distinct antiparticle partner. Cosmic ray neutrino experiments detect neutrinos from space to study both the nature of neutrinos and the cosmic sources producing them. Despite their tiny masses, neutrinos are so numerous that their gravitational force can influence other matter in the universe. [...] The three known neutrino flavors are the only established elementary particle candidates for dark matter, specifically hot dark matter, although that possibility appears to be largely ruled out by observations of the cosmic microwave background. [...] If heavier sterile neutrinos exist, they might serve as warm dark matter, which still seems plausible.|$|E

2500|$|The finds at Ayub Cave in South Cotabato again {{verified}} {{the great}} pottery {{tradition of the}} Philippines. In terms of quantity and quality, these artifacts have no match in Southeast Asia for such an early time period. One interesting question <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> Philippines ever developed an export industry for pottery. Generally {{it is known that}} the Thais had developed quite a flourishing industry, which is sometimes considered unique in SE Asia. However, it is well documented that the Philippines was in fact a major destination of pottery buyers from the islands of Japan at least. Japanese texts mention trading expeditions to the island of Rusun (Luzon) going well back before the Spanish period. What they sought were the highly prized Rusun and Namban jars. In fact, these jars were far more precious than gold to the Japanese because of their ability to act as tea canisters. Japanese texts were very specific about these jars being made in Luzon. The Tokiko, for example, calls the Rusun and Namban jars, Ru-sun tsukuru or Lu-sung ch'i (Chinese), which means simply [...] "made in Luzon." [...] In the Tokiko it mentions that all Rusun jars had this marking known as the rokuru (wheel mark). Those familiar with Philippine ethnography will know that this spiral is commonly used by many of the Philippine tribes. The following symbols were used to identify which kiln was used to make the jar: identified [...] "Imbe" [...] jars, meant jars coming from Bizen kiln, and mark three times meant a canister from the same oven. A jar with this mark is said to be made of Namban clay. This marking corresponds to the syllable la in Pampanga; Tagbanua for ka ("Chinese Pottery," [...] Field Museum of Natural History-Anth., vol.xii, Jul.1912) Of course, the symbol for la can also be the same as that for lu, and so this might correspond to the symbol said to stand for Lu in Rusun-no kokuji (Luzon national writing). According to the Tokiko, certain types of Rusun jars were distinguished by this character. De Morga mentions that Japanese traders were still coming in large numbers for these jars during his time, and that they were willing to spend great sums for them. Apparently work on these jars continued in the North, possibly among the unconquered Igorots, for De Morga had no knowledge of such current production. Later, the knowledge may have again trickled down to Vigan, where a flourishing industry of Burnay jar manufacture survives to this day. Although the Japanese described very high quality jars coming from the Philippines, not all were of elegant nature. In fact, De Morga had some disdain for some of the jars that the Japanese were buying, so they could have been similar to the well-known balanga and other jars in use today. These jars are generally handed down as heirlooms and are noted for their qualities in enhancing the fermentation process. Possibly one of the Japanese uses for the Rusun jars was fermentation of products like Kombucha and Umeboshi plums. Indeed, a Japanese acquaintance stated that their family in rural Japan used old Rusun jars for exactly this purpose up to this day. The Filipinos were skilled in all types of fishing and fisheries. In the south, the basnig, a Viking-like ship, was and is the vessel of choice among the Bisayans for ocean fishing. The salambao is a type of raft that utilizes a large fishing net which is lowered into the water via a type of lever made of two criss-crossed poles. Night fishing was accomplished with the help of candles similar to the copal of Mexico. These candles were made from a particular type of resin. Fish corrals, like the ones still used today, were also employed by the ancient Filipino. However, the area in which the Filipino most astonished Westerners was in their advanced aquaculture: ...|$|E
