We compare the distributions of annual mean significant wave height, mean wave <b>energy</b> <b>period</b> and wave power density in a present-day (1981 – 2010) and future (2040 – 2069) period, using a high resolution (8 km∼ 8 km) wave model driven by a perturbed physics ensemble of dynamically downscaled regional climate model simulations. The five ensemble members were chosen (from a pool of  11) to sample the range of uncertainty in climate sensitivity, under an A 1 B emissions scenario. The present-day wave climate simulations were found to systematically overestimate wave energy periods when compared to an observation-based wave hindcast. There was more similarity in the wave heights, although some members still differed significantly. We tested {{for changes in the}} annual-mean wave parameters in the 2050 s period. The ensemble member with the highest climate sensitivity showed a statistically significant reduction in mean significant wave height, but this was not seen in the other members. No member showed a significant change in wave <b>energy</b> <b>period</b> or wave power density. The climate change-induced differences in the wave parameters are smaller than the uncertainty of the wave climate projections, and the interannual variability of the wave climate itself, in both periods. Therefore characterising the interannual variability at these sites remains at least as important as {{the impact of}} climate change for assessing wave power output around Britain out to the 2050 s...|$|E

Not only does the level of stored nectar affect {{the temperature of the}} colony, but deficiencies in nectar cause a significant change in behavior due to low energy of the bees. When energy abundant colonies are threatened by predators, they assume the natural defense behavior, moving about loudly to deter the predator. However, low energy colonies will remain still in their colonies. Although temporary low <b>energy</b> <b>periods</b> do not affect the survivability of the larvae, it increases the colonies’ susceptibility to predators and increases the time of development for the larvae.|$|R

40|$|As {{wave energy}} moves towards a {{commercial}} stage, {{the need for}} accurate and reliable resource assessment becomes greater. Traditional tools such as surface following wave buoys are well established, but are subject to certain limitations, leading researchers to look to other more novel technologies when measuring surface waves. To assess {{the performance of the}} Teledyne RDI Workhorse with Waves ADCP, the Oceanor Seawatch Mini II wave buoy and the WERA HF (High Frequency) radar for the purpose of wave resource assessment, a comparison of data recorded over the period 13 / 03 / 2012 – 12 / 05 / 2012 in the waters surrounding the Wave Hub development is presented here. Comparisons of spectral significant wave height (Hm 0), <b>energy</b> <b>period</b> (Te), wave power and directional wave spectra (where available) as measured by each instrument are made. In situ measurements showed the strongest agreement, returning realistic measurements across the height and <b>energy</b> <b>period</b> range. However there were two periods during which the buoy failed to return accurate measurements, giving way to a total data return of 91. 6 %. Conversely the ADCP showed 100 % data return across the measurement period. There was some discrepancy between in situ and WERA measurements. This was most prominent during low sea states, when the echo-Doppler spectrum had a low SNR and was contaminated by Radio Frequency Interference and antenna side lobes giving way to an overestimation in significant wave height. Furthermore, data reliability from the WERA HF radar installation was questionable, with a maximum of 51. 66 %. It is therefore recommended that researchers make use of a combination of the discussed instruments, allowing for a comprehensive and validated dataset...|$|E
40|$|Accurate {{predictions}} of the annual energy yield from wave energy converters {{are essential to the}} development of the wave industry. The current method based on power matrices uses only a small part of the data available from sea state estimations and it is consequently prone to inaccuracies. The research presented in this work investigates the issue of energy yield prediction and questions the power matrix method. This is accomplished by quantifying the influence of several directional sea states parameters on the performances of wave energy converters. The approach taken was to test several wave energy converters in the Edinburgh Curved tank with a large set of sea states. The selected wave energy converters are a fix OWC, a set of two OWCs acting as a weak directional device and the desalination duck model. Uni-modal and bi-modal sea states were used. For the uni-modal sea states, parameters related to the wave system shape were considered. For the bi-modal sea states, the relative position of the wave system peaks was investigated and the uni-modality index was introduced to quantify the degree to which sea states could be considered bi-modal. For all sea states, the significant wave height was kept constant. The experimental work required good spectral estimates. The MLM and MMLM were adapted to deterministic waves to improve their stability and accuracy. A routine to isolate wave systems was also developed in order to estimate parameters with respect to each wave systems. For uni-modal spectra, parametric models of the observed performances of the devices could be devised. The frequency spreading and its interaction with the <b>energy</b> <b>period</b> proved to be as important as the <b>energy</b> <b>period</b> itself, which suggests that the frequency spreading should be used for energy production prediction. For bi-modal spectra, evidence of the duck sensitivity to directionality was found while the OWCs were not affected...|$|E
