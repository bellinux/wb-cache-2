50|$|In optical {{mineralogy}} an <b>interference</b> <b>colour</b> chart, {{first developed}} by Auguste Michel-Lévy, {{is a tool}} to identify minerals in thin section using a petrographic microscope. With a known thickness of the thin section, minerals have specific and predictable colours in cross-polarized light, and this chart can help identify minerals. The colours are produced by the difference in speed in the fast and slow rays, also known as birefringence.|$|E

40|$|Orientation {{measurements}} {{are important in}} many branches of geosciences in both field and laboratory studies. For fine-grained especially clayey samples, particulate and other physical methods are unsuitable. This is because numerous individual {{measurements are}} needed for a desirable level of accuracy, and sophisticated sample preparations and equipment are required. Existing photometric techniques were evaluated. They fail to deliver circular vectorial data (both magnitude and direction) for preferred orientation, and cannot detect bimodal or polymodal patterns. A modified method is developed to overcome these pitfalls. The pertinent principles related to clay orientation in thin sections, relative retardation and interferece colours are reviewed. Spectral distributions of <b>interference</b> <b>colours</b> are calculated and plotted to facilitate {{the selection of a}} suitable wavelength to winnow the light. A sensitive-tint plate of gypsum is used to alter the relative retardation and hence the <b>interference</b> <b>colours</b> of oriented clay in thin sections. The <b>interference</b> <b>colours</b> of unlike vibration direction are separated from those of alike vibration and isotopic components (including voids) by a monochromatic filter at a chosen wavelength, and detected by a photoelectric sensor (selenium photocell). Circular-polarized light was employed to eliminate the extinction phenomenon which was regarded as unwanted noise. Details on calibration, equipment setup and procedures are given. The application of circular statistics to the orientation data is described and illustrated with results of selected specimens. © 1988. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Raman Spectroscopy was {{employed}} to confirm the presence of hydrogrossular, rather than vesuvianite, in rodingites of the Othrys ophiolite suite, central Greece. The Raman spectra obtained from the fine-grained, weakly birefringent minerals, with anomalous bluish-grey <b>interference</b> <b>colours</b> documented the presence of hydrogrossular by its characteristic bands at ~ 360 - 362, 534 - 537, 817 - 819, 870 - 872 and 3600 cm- 1. No Raman spectra indicative of vesuvianite were obtained precluding the exis-tence of this phase. The absence of vesuvianite implies that the metasomatising fluid phase was rather rich in CO 2, an observation which is also verified by the abundance of calcite and assists in further stud-ying the evolution of these rocks...|$|R

Vertical dip-and-withdraw produces tapered layers, with one end thicker (surface coverage > 0. 85) than the other, whilst horizontal dip-and-withdraw produces much more uniform layers over the core region. The propagation of induced fracturing over the core region during drying is overcome using a simple protrusion of the inner cladding. Thick coatings are discernible through thin film <b>interference</b> <b>colouring,</b> but thinner coatings require scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging.

40|$|A {{circular}} polarizer is {{used for}} the first time to image coccoliths without the extinction pattern of crossed polarized light at maximum <b>interference</b> <b>colour.</b> The combination of a circular polarizer with retardation measurements based on grey values derived from theoretical calculations allows for the first time accurate calculations of the weight of single coccoliths thinner than 1. 37 μm. The weight estimates of 364 Holocene coccoliths using this new method are in good agreement with published volumetric estimates. A robust calibration method based on the measurement of a calibration target of known retardation enables the comparison of data between different imaging systems. Therefore, the new method overcomes the shortcomings of the error prone empirical calibration procedure of a previously reported method based on birefringence of calcite. Furthermore, it greatly simplifies the identification of coccolithophore species on the light microscope as well as the calculation of the area and thus weight of a coccolith...|$|E

40|$|Interference coloration, {{in which}} the {{perceived}} colour varies predictably with the angle of illumination or observation, is extremely widespread across animal groups. However, despite considerable advances {{in our understanding of}} the mechanistic basis of interference coloration in animals, we still have a poor understanding of its function. Here, I show, using avian predators hunting dynamic virtual prey, that the presence of interference coloration can significantly reduce a predator's attack success. Predators required more pecks to successfully catch interference-coloured prey compared with otherwise identical prey items that lacked interference coloration, and attacks against prey with <b>interference</b> <b>colours</b> were less accurate, suggesting that changes in colour or brightness caused by prey movement hindered a predator's ability to pinpoint their exact location.

40|$|Weak {{polyelectrolyte}} brushes exhibit pH-responsive swelling behaviour, tuneable surface energy, {{and some}} promise as “smart” responsive coatings. In this paper, we demonstrate {{the growth of}} two weak polybase brushes by surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerisation (SI-ATRP) using electrostatically adsorbed polyelectrolyte macro-initiators. Poly[2 -(diethylamino) ethyl methacrylate] (PDEA) and poly[2 -(diisopropylamino) ethyl methacrylate] (PDPA) brushes of 150 and 170 nm thickness respectively were grown within 22 h at 20 °C. Using in situellipsometry an acid-induced swelling transition was observed at pH 7. 4 for PDEA and pH 6. 5 for PDPA, similar to the pKa values reported for the corresponding free polymer chains. The kinetics of brush swelling involves an initially fast regime followed by a subsequent slower regime. Reversible surface energy switching with pH modulation was also demonstrated by contact angle goniometry. Finally, it was demonstrated that PDPA brushes respond {{to the presence of}} acidic vapours.

Alumoåkermanite is light brown in colour; it is transparent, with a {{vitreous}} lustre and the streak is white. Cleavages or partings are not observed. The mineral is brittle with an uneven fracture. The measured density is 2. 96 (2) g/cm³. The Mohs hardness is ∼ 4. 5 - 6. Alumoåkermanite is uniaxial (-) with ω = 1. 635 (1) and ε = 1. 624 - 1. 626 (1).

40|$|Since 1962, a {{photographic}} invention by Gabriel Lippmann (1845 - 1921), his Nobel Prize winning <b>interference</b> <b>colour</b> photograph of 1891, {{has been cited}} by physicals as the antecedent of the three-dimensional hologram. However, Dennis Gabor (1900 - 1979) in his original publications on the hologram of 1948 and 1949 did not cite Lippmann’s work. This thesis explores how the hologram that featured in Gabor’s original theory, as an imaging technique to improve the electron-microscope, was {{significantly different from the}} hologram for which Gabor was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1971. The citation of Lippmann’s work as the antecedent to the hologram confirmed that the hologram was {{to be seen as a}} three-dimensional photograph, and attempted to give the invention a progressive historical lineage that would conform to photography’s existing history. This popular narrative, as demonstrated in this text, could overlook the pursuit of the hologram for Cold War surveillance by researchers at the University of Michigan on behalf of the United States military. This technology was, from 1955, engaged with aerial radar image processing, a significant application that was classified and hidden from the public, and initially from Gabor himself. Two researchers at the University of Michigan, Emmett Leith (1927 -) and Juris Upatnieks (1936 -) attracted the attention of the popular press for their development of a three-dimensional laser hologram. This thesis reveals the fragmented nature of the new discipline as the peak of holography’s popularity. This analysis explores some of the historical traits between the two Nobel Prize winning inventions, the Lippmann photograph and the hologram, and were exploited to promote a new imaging medium to the public. In presenting these techniques as images the text also reviews devices and papers – some cited within the popular Lippman-to Gabor historical narrative – by father and son Frederic (1856 - 1937) and Herbert Ives (1882 - 1953), that have competed to produce a three-dimensional full-colour image.

40|$|One {{main problem}} {{for the use of}} the {{controlled}} fusion as possible energy source for the future is the interaction between of the hot fusion plasma with the surrounding wall components of the vacuum vessel. To reduce these negative effects it is indispensable to condition the vessel walls regular by deposition of thin, oxygen gettering layers using reactive gases like silane (SiH_ 4) or diborane (B_ 2 H_ 6) and to remove accumulated impurities. These methods have been mainly developed at the experimental device TEXTOR at the research centre Juelich and are successfully practised at many fusion devices by using glow discharges. The implementation of superconducting field coils in future fusion devices will lead to significant extended discharge duration but will also require new techniques for the wall conditioning, because glow discharges are not compatible with the permanent magnetic fields. Therefore, this thesis is dedicated to the investigation of microwave generated plasmas in a toroidal magnetic field. In the first part the discharge is characterised in dependence on the selectable parameters magnetic field strength, neutral gas pressure and microwave input power. Spatial measurements of the electron density and temperature were done for different process gases to allow an extrapolation of the results on the plasma parameter during the layer deposition in reactive gaseous like methane (CH_ 4) or acetylene (C_ 2 H_ 2). As a result of the application of various diagnostics the spatial distribution of the film thickness on the wall of the vacuum vessel could be distinguished. Further on the composition of the layers by carbon and hydrogen could by analysed and the thermal stability of the films was investigated ex-situ. The results of these measurements leads to an improved understanding on the mechanism of the film growth and the influence of neutral radicals and charged hydrocarbons on it. In addition the erosion of the deposited layers by discharges in hydrogen, deuterium and oxygen has been characterised by mass spectrometry and investigation of the layer thickness by <b>interference</b> <b>colour</b> analysis.

40|$|The {{morphology}} {{of green}} and blue feathers of the Rose-faced Lovebird (Agapomis roseicollis) is described from light-, fluorescence-, and electron microscopical findings and discussed in relation to earlier works. The description is intended to {{provide a basis for}} future comparative studies. Special attention is given to the colour-producing elements (pigments and the short-wave reflecting spongy structure ('Blaustruktur', 'cloudy medium') of specialized medullary barb cells (spongy cells, box cells)), and the findings are correlated with macro- and microspectrophotometric measurements. Green barbs differ from those of blue ba rbs in having their cortex yellow pigmented, but are further distinguished by their spongy structure which is denser (wider keratin rods and correspondingly narrower air-filled channels) than that of blue barbs. This difference corresponds to the wave-length of maximum reflectance being shifted c. 30 nm towards longer wave-lengths compared to that of blue barbs. Thus green barbs {{are not the same as}} blue barbs only with a yellow pigmented instead of an unpigmented cortex, as usually stated. Dark green hack feathers reflect approximately half as much light throughout the visible spectrum as do green belly feathers. This difference is due to variations in yellow and black pigmentation of the barbules. These variations are described quantitatively and the importance of barbules for the resulting feather colour is stressed. Variation in size and shape of barbs and barbules are discussed, principally in relation to their optical efIects and the presumed functions of the colours. The colour produced by the spongy structure cannot be explained by Tyndall (Rayleigh) scattering as is usually done. This follows from the shapes of the barb reflectance spectra which are not in agreement with the Rayleigh equation (scattering inversely proportional to lambda 4). A new model for colour production is forwarded. It is based on a model of the spongy structure in which this is considered to consist of short hollow keratin cylinders (diameter 0. 3 - 0. 35 ft) with air-filled cores. Backscattering from these cylinders is considered responsible for colour production and good agreement is obtained between values of lambda max calculated from the model and those measured spectrophotometrically. The backscattering from the Individual cylinders can be regarded as an Interference phenomenon. The colour of the spongy structure thus is an <b>interference</b> <b>colour.</b> That it appears diffuse and not iridescent, as is generally the case for interference colours in feathers, is due to the presence of many hollow cylinders oriented in all directions in the spongy structure...|$|E

40|$|Bird plumage is {{coloured}} both by pigments and by spectrally selective {{interference in}} the light reflected from feather barbs. These barbs are composites of high- and low-refractive-index materials, and light is reflected at refractive index boundaries. The spatial structure determines the wavelengths where constructive interference occurs and, hence, the spectral tuning. The spectral tuning of <b>interference</b> <b>colours</b> often varies with angles of illumination and reflection, which produces iridescence. Iridescence and other optical effects mean that interference coloration looks different from pigmentation and is visually striking. To study the optical and visual properties of structural plumage colours, we recorded the reflectance spectra of feathers and in particular their directional properties. A fixed spot on a feather was viewed from a fixed position, whilst the feather orientation and the angle of illumination were varied. We recognise two main types of coloration, `directional' and `diffuse'. Within these types, there is considerable variation, and five examples illustrate some features of structural plumage colours and suggest how their optical and visual properties can be measured and described...|$|R

40|$|Polycrystalline diamond (PCD) {{films have}} been grown on silicon {{substrates}} by thermally activated (hot filament) {{chemical vapour deposition}} (CVD) and microwave plasma-assisted CVD. In addition, freestanding PCD wafers have been prepared by removing the substrate. A requirement for optical applications of these films is a relatively smooth surface, i. e. a small surface roughness {{as compared to the}} optical wavelength. A reduction of surface roughness of thin PCD films has been achieved by increasing the nucleation density to above 10 (exp 10) cm(exp - 2) using an appropriate substrate pretreatment. This high nucleation density allows the deposition of thin films with thicknesses between 0. 1 and 0. 6 mu m showing intense <b>interference</b> <b>colours.</b> By moving silicon wafers 3 in (7. 6 cm) in diameter under the hot filament during the deposition process, large area diamond coatings with very uniform film thicknesses were obtained. The roughness of thick PCD films (thickness greater than 1 mu m) cou ld be reduced by enforcing secondary nucleation. However, the resulting nanocrystalline films have considerable amounts of nondiamond phases. Using microwave plasma-assisted CVD, relatively smooth PCD films with a surface consisting of (100) faces oriented parallel to the substrate were prepared. These films exhibit a pronounced 100 texture...|$|R
30|$|As for {{the origin}} of the calcium and iron phosphate, the change in the burial environment, {{particularly}} the more oxidising condition and the interaction with Ca-rich circulating ground water, promoted the transformation of vivianite into a hydrated calcium and iron phosphate. Mitridatite is in these samples not crystalline since it formed through an Ostwald step sequence after vivianite. In such situation, the transformation stopped at a higher Gibbs energy, with the amorphous particles characterised by a lower superficial energy than if the mitridatite were in crystalline form. Therefore, the transformation determined the formation of an amorphous phase with a chemical composition consistent with that of mitridatite, which could in fact eventually evolve to crystalline mitridatite. Both thermodynamic and kinetic factors influenced the transformation and inhibited the crystallization of mitridatite. The amorphous state of this secondary phase can be also observed from its optical behaviour (Fig.  2 a, b) under a petrographic microscope, as the lack of <b>interference</b> <b>colours</b> is compatible with a cubic or, as it is the case, an amorphous phase. It is important to remark that the bulk mineralogical composition of the pottery obtained using conventional XRPD bearing these secondary phases does not comprise any phosphate [6], due to their low content and to the fact that only part of them (vivianite) is crystalline.|$|R
40|$|An {{analysis}} of the crystallographic orientation of polycristalline silicon ingots, obtained by a directional solidification in carbon crucible according to Bridgman method using no seed crystal, is described. The grain growth, in alignment with the higher temperature gradient, produces different crystallized zones in the ingot : an axially columnar structure {{in the middle and}} a radial dentritic structure on the edges. At first the usual methods of X-ray diffraction by reflection are used (back reflection Laue photographs, Debye-Scherrer method). The neutron diffraction by transmission was used to complete the precedent results. The preferred orientations vary in the different parts of the ingot : [211] and [111] orientations in the middle, [111] and [331] orientations on the edges. Lattice constant deviations (≈ 15. 10 - 4 Å) have been observed between the different crystalline zones. These previous rafined methods take a long time over controls in an industrial elaboration. Therefore an electrochemical method using the anodic dissolution of silicon has been developped. The deposit thus obtained was investigated by X-ray diffraction and S. I. M. S.; a correlation between the film thickness and the reticular density of the etched surface was obtained. So the solidification texture can be shown, without a great precision but very rapidly by a coloured card with <b>interference</b> <b>colours</b> of the thin anodic layer. This method suits well cantrol of an industrial preparation...|$|R
