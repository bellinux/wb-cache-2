5|$|Diving beetles, {{such as the}} Dytiscidae, carry {{a bubble}} of air {{with them when they}} dive. Such a bubble may be {{contained}} under the elytra or against the body by specialized hydrophobic hairs. The bubble covers {{at least some of the}} spiracles, permitting air to enter the tracheae. The function of the bubble <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> contain a store of air, but to act as a physical gill. The air that it traps is in contact with oxygenated water, so as the animal's consumption depletes the oxygen in the bubble, more oxygen can diffuse in to replenish it. Carbon dioxide is more soluble in water than either oxygen or nitrogen, so it readily diffuses out faster than in. Nitrogen is the most plentiful gas in the bubble, and the least soluble, so it constitutes a relatively static component of the bubble and acts as a stable medium for respiratory gases to accumulate in and pass through. Occasional visits to the surface are sufficient for the beetle to re-establish the constitution of the bubble.|$|E

The academy is composed of eleven youth selections, ranging from U7 to U19. Totally, there are over 210 youth players in the system who are trained by professional staff within the club. The vision of the club and its youth system <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> produce new players but also to prepare young children for the future and life without football. Therefore, each child {{who wants to be a}} member of the academy must also be successful not only on the football field, but also in the field of education. The club has also spread the football school activities to primary schools in the city of Maribor and the surrounding area, where around 500 of the youngest footballers train as part of the Children's Football School.|$|E

25|$|The court {{looked at}} the {{language}} of section 32 {{and found that it}} does not limit to only positive acts. It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> protect against encroachment on rights or the excessive exercise of authority, as McClung suggested, rather it is a tool for citizens to challenge the law in all its forms. The legislature's silence on an issue does not constitute neutrality with first assessing the application of section 15.|$|E
25|$|Muscle {{action that}} moves the axial {{skeleton}} work over a joint with an origin and insertion {{of the muscle}} on respective side. The insertion is on the bone deemed to move towards the origin during muscle contraction. Muscles are often present that engage in several actions of the joint; able to perform for example both flexion and extension of the forearm as in the biceps and triceps respectively. This <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> be able to revert actions of muscles, but also brings on stability of the actions though muscle coactivation.|$|E

Wade surprises Evans and nearly strangles him, but relents when Evans reveals that delivering Wade to the train <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> provide for his family, but to restore his own sense of honor, and give his sons something good to remember him for. Wade then admits he has already been to Yuma Prison and escaped twice, and agrees to board the train, allowing Evans' contract to be fulfilled.|$|E
25|$|The School {{provides}} {{courses of}} study in the disciplines of, Dance, Theatre Arts, Painting and Sculpture and Communication.

An inter-disciplinary approach is incorporated in the syllabus. Apart from the core faculty, experts in various fields and guest faculty of national and international repute teach courses in the School.|$|E
25|$|Performance appraisals, {{also known}} as {{performance}} evaluations, are assessments that many organizations use to measure individuals' productivity, ability and talent in their respective job positions. The goal of these appraisals <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> measure each person's performance, but also to align all of the employee's values, goals and motivations and become a better performing organization as a whole. While the implementation of performance evaluations has been characterized as beneficial and even essential for organizational success, many of these performance evaluations have also become more ineffective over time due to both the excessive number of evaluation measures and employee reactivity to these evaluations.|$|E

Common met the pair during his tour in the UK earlier on in the year. It is speculated that the deal <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> bring the UK and US hip hop genres together but that to rival Syco Music's cross-Atlantic success with Leona Lewis. He also has a deal with Zune mp3 players. In 2008 Common made an estimated 12 million dollars, making him equal in earnings to Eminem and Akon, tied for the 13th highest grossing Hip-Hop artist.|$|E
25|$|The {{main purpose}} of using AVL <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> locate the vehicles, but also to obtain {{information}} about engine data, fuel consumption, driver data and sensor data from i.e. doors, freezer room on trucks or air pressure. Such data can be obtained via the CAN-bus, via direct connections to AVL systems or via open bus systems such as UFDEX that both sends and receives data via SMS or GPRS in pure ASCII text format. Because most AVL consists of two parts, GPS and GSM modem with additional embedded AVL software contained in a microcontroller, most AVL systems are fixed for its purposes unless they connect to an open bus system for expansion possibilities.|$|E
25|$|The goal {{of these}} {{missions}} <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> detect Earth-sized planets, {{but also to}} directly detect light from the planet so {{that it may be}} studied spectroscopically. By examining planetary spectra, {{it would be possible to}} determine the basic composition of an extrasolar planet's atmosphere and/or surface. Given this knowledge, it may be possible to assess the likelihood of life being found on that planet. A NASA research group, the Virtual Planet Laboratory, is using computer modeling to generate a wide variety of virtual planets to see what they would look like if viewed by TPF or Darwin. It is hoped that once these missions come online, their spectra can be cross-checked with these virtual planetary spectra for features that might indicate the presence of life.|$|E

500|$|The role {{of uniform}} <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> hide each soldier, {{but also to}} {{identify}} friend from foe. Issue of the [...] "Frogskin" [...] uniforms to US troops in Europe during the Second World War was halted as it was too often mistaken for the disruptively patterned German uniform worn by the Waffen-SS. Camouflage uniforms {{need to be made}} and distributed to a large number of soldiers.

500|$|The [...] "rest" [...] {{that the}} Holy Spirit waits for and finally finds in the Son {{is also found}} in gnostic speculations. The wisdom chain-saying which {{describes}} the progression of seeking, marveling, and finding salvation, is similar to the Hermetic conception of salvation found in the Alexandrian Corpus Hermetica. [...] "Rest" [...] <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> be understood as the ultimate goal of the seeker after truth, which leads to salvation; it is also descriptive of a unity with the wisdom which {{lies at the heart of}} the Godhead. The [...] "resting" [...] of the Holy Spirit at the moment of Jesus' Baptism may also be understood in this timeless sense, as the union and rest of the pre-existent Son with his Father, in keeping with the gnostic conception of [...] "rest" [...] as the highest gift of salvation.|$|E
500|$|Locke dedicates {{the bulk}} of Some Thoughts Concerning Education to {{explaining}} how to instill virtue in children. He defines virtue as a combination of self-denial and rationality: [...] "that a man is able to deny himself his own desires, cross his own inclinations, and purely follow what reason directs as best, though the appetite lean the other way" [...] (Locke's emphasis). Future virtuous adults must be able not only to practice self-denial but also to see the rational path. Locke was convinced that children could reason early in life and that parents should address them as reasoning beings. Moreover, he argues that parents should, above all, {{attempt to create a}} [...] "habit" [...] of thinking rationally in their children. Locke continually emphasises habit over rule—children should internalise the habit of reasoning rather than memorise a complex set of prohibitions. This focus on rationality and habit corresponds to two of Locke's concerns in the Essay Concerning Human Understanding. Throughout the Essay, Locke bemoans the irrationality of the majority and their inability, because of the authority of custom, to change or forfeit long-held beliefs. His attempt to solve this problem <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>to</b> treat children as rational beings but also to create a disciplinary system founded on esteem and disgrace rather than on rewards and punishments. For Locke, rewards such as sweets and punishments such as beatings turn children into sensualists rather than rationalists; such sensations arouse passions rather than reason. He argues that [...] "such a sort of slavish discipline makes a slavish temper" [...] (Locke's emphasis).|$|E
