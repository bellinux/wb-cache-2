5000|$|Polyolefins (PO) (polyethylene (usually LDPE {{but also}} HDPE; HDPE has higher melting point and better {{temperature}} resistance), atactic polypropylene (PP or APP), polybutene-1, oxidized polyethylene, etc.), low-performance, for difficult-to-bond plastics. Very good adhesion to polypropylene, good moisture barrier, chemical resistance against polar solvents and solutions of acids, bases, and alcohols. Longer open time {{in comparison with}} EVA and polyamides. Polyolefins have low surface energy and provide good wetting of most metals and polymers. Polyolefins made by metallocene catalyzed synthesis have narrow distribution of molecular weight and correspondingly narrow melting temperature range. Due to the relatively high crystallinity, polyethylene-based glues tend to be opaque and, depending on additives, white or yellowish. Polyethylene hot melts have high pot life stability, are not prone to charring, and are suitable for moderate temperature ranges and on porous non-flexible substrates. Nitrogen or carbon dioxide can be introduced into the melt, forming a foam which increases spreading and open time and decreases transfer of heat to the substrate, allowing use of more heat-sensitive substrates; polyethylene-based HMAs are usually used. Foamable HMAs {{are available on the}} market since 1981. Amorphous polypropylene HMAs have good dielectric properties, making them suitable for use at high frequencies. PE and APP are usually used on their own or with just a small amount of tackifiers (usually hydrocarbons) and waxes (usually paraffins or microcrystalline waxes, for lower cost, improved anti-blocking, and altered open time and softening temperature). The molecular weight of the polymer is usually lower. Lower molecular weights provide better low-temperature performance and higher flexibility, higher molecular weights increase the seal strength, <b>hot</b> <b>tack,</b> and melt viscosity.|$|E
5000|$|Ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) copolymers, low-performance, the {{low-cost}} {{and most}} common {{material for the}} glue sticks (e.g., the light amber colored Thermogrip GS51, GS52, and GS53). They provide sufficient strength between 30 and 50 °C but are limited to use below 60-80 °C and have low creep resistance under load. The vinyl acetate monomer content is about 18-29 percent by weight of the polymer. High amounts of tackifiers and waxes are often used; an example composition is 30-40% of EVA copolymer (provides strength and toughness), 30-40% of tackifier resin (improves wetting and tack), 20-30% of wax (usually paraffin-based; reduces viscosity, alters setting speed, reduces cost), and 0.5-1% of stabilizers. Fillers can be added for special applications. Can be formulated for service temperatures ranging from −40 to +80 °C, and for both short and long open times and {{a wide range of}} melt viscosities. High stability at elevated temperatures and resistance to ultraviolet radiation, which can be further enhanced with suitable stabilizers. High vinylacetate content can serve for formulating a hot-melt pressure-sensitive adhesive (HMPSA). EVA formulations are compatible with paraffin. EVA was the base for the original hot melt composition. The composition of the copolymer influences its properties; increased content of ethylene promotes adhesion to nonpolar substrates such as polyethylene, while increased content of vinyl acetate promotes adhesion to polar substrates such as paper. Higher ethylene content also increases mechanical strength, block resistance, and paraffin solubility. Higher vinyl acetate content provides higher flexibility, adhesion, <b>hot</b> <b>tack,</b> and better low-temperature performance. Adhesive grade EVA usually contains 14-35% vinyl acetate. Lower molecular weight chains provide lower melt viscosity, better wetting, and better adhesion to porous surfaces. Higher molecular weights provide better cohesion at elevated temperatures and better low-temperature behavior. Increased ratio of vinyl acetate lowers the crystallinity of the material, improves optical clarity, flexibility and toughness, and worsens resistance to solvents. EVA can be crosslinked by, e.g., peroxides, yielding a thermosetting material. EVAs can be compounded with aromatic hydrocarbon resins. Grafting butadiene to EVA improves its adhesion. Its dielectric properties are poor due to high content of polar groups, the dielectric loss is moderately high. Polypropylene HMAs are a better choice for high-frequency electronics. EVAs are optically clearer and more gas and vapor permeable than polyolefins. Nearly half of EVA HMAs is used in packaging applications. Cryogenic grinding of EVAs can provide small, water-dispersible particles for heat-seal applications. EVA can degrade primarily by loss of acetic acid and formation of a double bond in the chain, and by oxidative degradation. EVA can be compounded into a wide range of HMAs, from soft pressure-sensitive adhesives to rigid structural adhesives for furniture construction.|$|E

40|$|Interest in {{polyethylene}} and polypropylene bonding {{has increased}} in the last years. However, adhesive joints with adherends which are of low surface energy and which are chemically inert present several difficulties. Generally, their high degree of chemical resistance to solvents and dissimilar solubility parameters limit the usefulness of solvent bonding as a viable assembly technique. One successful approach to adhesive bonding of these materials involves proper selection of surface pre-treatment prior to bonding. With the correct pre-treatment {{it is possible to}} glue these materials with one or more of several adhesives required by the applications involved. A second approach is the use of adhesives without surface pre-treatment, such as <b>hot</b> melts, high <b>tack</b> pressure-sensitive adhesives, solvent-based specialty adhesives and, more recently, structural acrylic adhesives as such 3 M DP- 8005 ® and Loctite 3030 ®. In this paper, the shear strengths of two acrylic adhesives were evaluated using the lap shear test method ASTM D 3163 and the block shear test method ASTM D 4501. Two different industrial polyolefins (polyethylene and polypropylene) were used for adherends. However, the focus {{of this study was to}} measure the shear strength of polyethylene joints with acrylic adhesives. The effect of abrasion was also studied. Some test specimens were manually abraded using 180 and 320 grade abrasive paper. An additional goal of this work was to examine the effect of temperature and moisture on mechanical strength of adhesive joints...|$|R
40|$|Multilayer {{films of}} a {{conventional}} linear low-density poly(ethylene/α-octene) (LLDPE) and a metallocene linear low-density poly(ethylene/α-hexene) (mLLDPE) copolymers were produced by cast co-extrusion process. Coextruded films were obtained by varying the position and the relative thicknesses of the two polymers. Mechanical (tensile and impact) tests, permeability, haze and <b>hot</b> <b>tack</b> measurements were carried out on the produced films in order to verify the effect of layer composition and position on the performances of the coextruded samples. Thermal and atomic force microscopy characterizations of the three-layer structures were also performed to correlate the resulting morphology with the film properties. The experiments demonstrated that, at fixed composition, the structures having the mLLDPE copolymer as external layers exhibit generally better mechanical performances and a widening in the sealability temperature window due to a lowering of 5 °C in the seal-initiation temperature, with only a small increase (max 3. 5 %) in the film haze percentages. The oxygen permeability values {{do not seem to}} be significantly affected by the structure composition and layout...|$|E
40|$|Filmes base PELBD + PEBD contendo 5 % de sorbato de potássio (SK) foram preparados por extrusão plana. Os filmes com e sem SK foram caracterizados por calorimetria exploratória diferencial (DSC) e fluorescência de Raios X por dispersão de comprimento de onda (WDXRF). O perfil de migração do SK foi acompanhado por FTIR/ATR e UV-Vis e sua influência na curva de selagem (<b>hot</b> <b>tack)</b> dos filmes foi determinada. A adição de SK não causou alteração nas propriedades térmicas do polietileno na concentração estudada, porém a migração do SK para a superfície do filme interferiu na curva de selabilidade, atuando como uma impureza, causando diminuição da força de selagem em faixa de temperaturas mais baixas. Films {{produced}} with blends of linear {{low density polyethylene}} and low density polyethylene (LLDPE + LDPE) containing 5 wt % of potassium sorbate (KS) were prepared by flat film extrusion. These films were characterized by differential scanning calorimetry and wavelength dispersive X-ray fluorescence. The migration profile of KS was followed by Attenuated Total Reflection-Fourier Transform Infrared and Ultraviolet spectroscopies and its effect on the sealing curve was determined. The addition of 5 % of KS showed no effect in the thermal properties of polyethylene. However, the sealing properties were slightly affected by KS migration, acting as an impurity in the sealed area, which needed a higher sealing force at lower temperatures...|$|E
40|$|Electrostatic corona {{pretreatment}} {{has traditionally}} been a very cost-efficient treatment method to optimize adhesion levels during the extrusion coating and lamination process. While it is cost-effective, the residence times may be insufficient to permit penetration of the active species that effect change into the surfaces of web materials. Low-pressure plasmas {{have been used for}} many years to surface treat three-dimensional plastic objects and polymer films, therefore, the benefits of plasma treatment are well recognized: reduced degradation of surface morphology, higher treatment (dyne) levels, elimination of backside treatment, and extended life of treatment over time. However, the complexity, slow speed and high cost of these contained plasma systems make them impractical for all but the most esoteric applications. Now a system has been developed that allows plasmas to be sustained at atmospheric pressure in a way that permits the surface treatment of substrates to enhance adhesion strength and <b>hot</b> <b>tack</b> in the extrusion coating and lamination processes on a continuous web handling system similar to a corona treating system. The Atmospheric Plasma Treatment (APT) process allows treatment in a broad range of reactive chemistries and has been successfully tested on various films, foils, nonwovens and metals. Further, depending upon the dyne level required and type of material, line speeds in excess of 400 fpm are practical and beyond 1, 000 fpm have been achieved. Specialty applications requiring stringent surface morphology specifications, specific surface modification such as hydrophilicity, precise surface coating or tightly controlled electrical characteristics will find the APT system especially attractive and useful...|$|E
40|$|The coating {{technology}} is a strategic solution to improve the properties of flexible packaging films. Indeed, additional functional layers are often designed and added as coating on the substrate, {{in order to improve}} the characteristic of the flexible packaging and to meet the requirements for the desired gas or vapour barrier, for adhesion and sealing, or for improving the film printability, its aesthetics and durability. Moreover, this technology allows to functionalize a polymeric substrate applying materials with different chemistry, rheology, thermal and structural characteristics. BOPET films are widely used for food packaging applications thanks to their good gas barrier and mechanical properties, high transparency and for the excellent printability. In regard to sealing performance, BOPET films show poor sealing properties so they are mostly submitted to lamination processes with polyethylene. Nevertheless, this solution compromises the PET recyclability and influences the gas permeability of the multilayer PET based structures. The aim of this work is to investigate on the effect of nanocomposite biodegradable coatings for BOPET substrates in enhancing the heat sealing strength of eco-compatible PET/PLA films. At this regards, different percentages of Cloisite C 30 B (0 %, 2 % and 4 %wt/wt) have been added to PLA by solution intercalation technique and the nanocomposite biodegradable materials produced have been applied on BOPET commercial films by casting. The BOPET coated films have been characterized in order to evaluate the heat sealing strength and the mechanical, gas permeability and surface properties. The results have shown that the addition of nanoclay in PLA coating significantly enhance the <b>hot</b> <b>tack</b> properties of the PET/PLA system produced, while the oxygen and water vapour permeability are slightly increased if compared to pure BOPET films...|$|E
40|$|Low-density {{polyethylene}} (LDPE) and polypropylene (PP) {{are widely}} used polymers in packaging industry. These polymers differ to one and other by their polymer structures: LPDE has long branched body, when PP is a linear polymer. Branched structure gives LDPE flexibility that PP lacks due to its high level of crystallization. The aim {{of this research was}} to compare these polymers in extrusion coating and find out if there are certain procedures in surface treatments that could improve PP’s properties in post-coating stage. For instance PP has high melting temperature and low surface energy that prevents its use in extrusion coating. In extrusion coating a thin film of the molten polymer is extruded though a flat tie and then pressed towards the substrate. The substrate in this study was paper and the studied treatments were flame, corona, and plasma focusing on heat sealing, <b>hot</b> <b>tack,</b> surface energy and water vapour transmission (WVTR). The study was divided into four different case studies: 1. The effect of flame treatment, 2. The barrier effect of plasma and corona, 3. The effect of the treatment combination, 4. The influence of time and conditions. In the results, it was shown that PP has better water vapour transfer resistance throughout the study points and in comparison to LDPE it also reacted more on the surface treatments in case of WVTR. LDPE had higher surface energy in nearly every study point despite the surface treatment and its reaction on treatments was greater. LDPE’s and PP’s heat sealability temperatures were relatively close to each other in treated study points, though LDPE’s reference value was remarkably lower. If flame treatment is combined with plasma or corona, the best results for both used polymers took place in the treatment order where the flame treatment was performed first: sealing temperature, surface energy and WVTR enhanced. In the study of time condition contact angles grow in logarithmic scale in both studied polymers and the highest growth happens in hotter and humid conditions. LDPE’s and PP’s sealing temperatures follow relatively similar curve in function of time. /Kir 1...|$|E
