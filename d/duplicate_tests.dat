Authors undertook a retrospective review of <b>duplicate</b> <b>testing</b> on patients receiving coordinated care across two institutions, {{each with its own}} electronic medical record system. In order to determine whether <b>duplicate</b> <b>testing</b> occurred and if such testing was clinically indicated, authors analyzed records of 85 patients transferred from one site to the other between January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2007. Duplication of testing (repeat within 12  hours) was found in 32 % of the cases examined; 20 % of cases had at least one <b>duplicate</b> <b>test</b> not clinically indicated. While previous studies document that inaccessibility of paper records leads to <b>duplicate</b> <b>testing</b> when patients are transferred between care facilities, the current study suggests that incomplete electronic record transfer among incompatible electronic medical record systems can also lead to potentially costly <b>duplicate</b> <b>testing</b> behaviors.

40|$|Background. The {{electronic}} {{health record}} (EHR) {{has been promoted}} {{as a tool to}} improve quality of patient care, reduce costs, and improve efficiency. There is little data to confirm that the use of EHR has reduced <b>duplicate</b> <b>testing.</b> We sought to evaluate the rate of performance of repeat transthoracic echocardiograms before and after the adoption of EHR. Methods. We retrospectively examined the rates of repeat echocardiograms performed before and after the implementation of an EHR system. Results. The baseline rate of repeat testing before EHR was 4. 6 % at six months and 7. 6 % at twelve months. In the first year following implementation of EHR, 6. 6 % of patients underwent a repeat study within 6 months, and 12. 9 % within twelve months. In the most recent year of EHR usage, 5. 7 % of patients underwent repeat echocardiography at six months and 11. 9 % within twelve months. All rates of <b>duplicate</b> <b>testing</b> were significantly higher than their respective pre-EHR rates (p< 0. 01 for all). Conclusion. Our study failed to demonstrate a reduction in the rate of <b>duplicate</b> echocardiography <b>testing</b> after the implementation of an EHR system.

40|$|The EPA radon {{measurement}} device protocols recommend duplicate measurements for 10 % of devices deployed or {{a maximum of}} 50 per month. In addition, {{one of the three}} options for real estate testing calls for simultaneous, side-by-side measurements. While these side-by-side measurements are not identified as such, they are actually <b>duplicate</b> <b>tests.</b> Since most testers will choose the side-by-side option (rather than sequential or continuous testing) and since most testing is currently done for real estate transactions, we can expect a large increase in the overall number of <b>duplicate</b> <b>tests</b> conducted in the future. Some radon testers have applauded this approach as a big improvement in the confidence of real estate testing results. We contend that this is not necessarily true. Unfortunately, when duplicate measurements yield similar values, this shows that the devices are able to provide reproducible results, but it does not say that either measurement is accurate with respect to the true radon level. In other words, duplicate measurements can lead to unjustified confidence in results. Furthermore, the interpretation of duplicate measurements represents one of the most difficult, and often most misunderstood, of any radon measurements. To properly evaluate duplicate results requires some understanding of radiation statistics. Many radon testers, and essentially all homeowners, have very little understanding of statistics.

40|$|Abstract Background Electronic health {{information}} systems, such as picture archiving communication systems (PACS), are commonly believed {{to reduce the}} need for <b>duplicate</b> <b>testing.</b> However, empirical data to support this belief are not available. Methods Before-after study using administrative claims data from the Ontario Health Insurance Plan to determine whether the introduction of PACS at 10 hospitals in the Thames Valley region of southwestern Ontario, Canada between June 2004 and December 2005 reduced the frequency of duplicate imaging examinations. The imaging modalities studied were: chest and abdominal X-ray; computed tomography of the abdomen/pelvis, head, and chest. The frequency of <b>duplicate</b> <b>testing</b> was examined at 3 different time frames: 7 days, 30 days, and 60 days after a given index test. Results Overall frequencies of duplicate imaging were: 2. 7 % within 7 days of an index imaging test, 6. 7 % within 30 days, and 9. 8 % within 60 days. Comparing the 12 months before and 12 months after PACS, absolute reductions in the frequency of duplicate X-rays using 7 -day, 30 -day, and 60 -day time frames were: 0. 2 % (P = 0. 01), 0. 6 % (P increases in the frequency of duplicate CT scans after PACS of 0. 0 % (P = 0. 92), 0. 5 % (P = 0. 01), and 0. 5 % (P = 0. 01), respectively. Conclusion The frequency of duplicate imaging is relatively low and we did not find large reductions in duplicate imaging after the introduction of PACS. Independent evaluation of electronic medical systems should be conducted to confirm widely held beliefs of their potential benefits. </p...|$|R
40|$|Adaptive random testing (ART) {{has been}} {{proposed}} as an enhancement to random testing for situations where failure-causing inputs are clustered together. The basic idea of ART is to evenly spread test cases throughout the input domain. It has been shown by simulations and empirical analysis that ART frequently outperforms random testing. However, there are some outstanding issues on the cost-effectiveness and practicality of ART, which are the main foci of this thesis. Firstly, this thesis examines the basic factors that {{have an impact on}} the faultdetection effectiveness of adaptive random testing, and identifies favourable and unfavourable conditions for ART. Our study concludes that favourable conditions for ART occur more frequently than unfavourable conditions. Secondly, since all previous studies allow <b>duplicate</b> <b>test</b> cases, there has been a concern whether adaptive random testing performs better than random testing because ART uses fewer <b>duplicate</b> <b>test</b> cases. This thesis confirms that it is the even spread rather than less duplication of test cases which makes ART perform better than RT. Given that the even spread is the main pillar of the success of ART, an investigation has been conducted to study the relevance and appropriateness of several existing metrics of even spreading. Thirdly, the practicality of ART has been challenged for nonnumeric or high dimensional input domains. This thesis provides solutions that address these concerns. Finally, a new problem solving technique, namely, mirroring, has been developed. The integration of mirroring with adaptive random testing has been empirically shown to significantly increase the cost-effectiveness of ART. In summary, this thesis significantly contributes to both the foundation and the practical applications of adaptive random testing...|$|R

30|$|The {{significant}} {{errors that}} could influence {{the accuracy of}} the experimental data can be classified into two groups: systematic errors and random errors. While systematic errors are minimized with careful experimentation and the calibration operations, the precision error can be treated statistically.

It is important to note that, in order to check the repeatability of the experiments, <b>duplicate</b> <b>tests</b> were performed for certain operating conditions, and the measured temperatures were found virtually identical within the measurement uncertainties.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Health {{information}} exchange (HIE) {{is a key}} component of health care reform that enables clinical data sharing between providers, patients, and health care organizations. The value of HIE rests in the promise that more efficient and effective access to clinical data will improve patients ’ condition-specific outcomes relative to the costs. For example, improvements in outcomes may result from fewer medical errors and improved adherence to evidence-based recommendations, whereas reductions in costs may result from fewer <b>duplicate</b> <b>tests</b> and improved care coordination. However, even though health care reform efforts promote HIE as a way to improve care and curb costs, few studies demonstrate these results.
