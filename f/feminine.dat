5|$|Cal also {{exhibits}} <b>feminine</b> characteristics, {{which allows}} Dr. Luce to classify her as possessing a female gender identity. In a home video taken when Cal was a child, his mother {{gives him a}} doll and he nurses it with a milk bottle. Luce carefully observes Callie's actions and diagnoses them as <b>feminine,</b> which causes him to determine that Callie has a <b>feminine</b> gender identity. Luce then concludes that gender identity is nurtured and etched into children at their young ages.|$|E

These arose due to La Croisee des Chemins (Crossroads), a lodge under la Grande Loge <b>féminine</b> de Belgique formed to spread Freemasonry amongst the women of other countries.|$|E

5|$|Shaktism's {{focus on}} the Divine <b>Feminine</b> does not imply a {{rejection}} of masculine. It rejects male-female, soul-body, transcendent-immanent dualism, considering nature as divine. Devi {{is considered to be}} the cosmos itself – she is the embodiment of energy, matter and soul, the motivating force behind all action and existence in the material universe. Yet in Shaktism, states C. MacKenzie Brown, the masculine and the <b>feminine</b> are aspects of the divine, transcendent reality. In Hindu iconography, the cosmic dynamic of masculine-feminine interdependence and equivalence, is expressed in the half-Shakti, half-Shiva deity known as Ardhanari.|$|E

5|$|Similarly, in the second-singular, {{inherited}} *-ta -ti {{competed with}} lengthened *-tā -tī for masculine and <b>feminine</b> forms. The expected {{result would be}} -t or -tā for masculine, -t or -tī for <b>feminine,</b> and in fact both variants of both forms {{are found in the}} Bible (with -h marking the long -ā and -y marking the long -ī). The situation appears to have been quite fluid for several centuries, with -t and -tā/tī forms found in competition both in writing and in speech (cf. the Secunda (Hexapla) of Origen, which records both pronunciations, although quite often in disagreement with the written form as passed down to us). Ultimately, writing stabilized on the shorter -t for both genders, while speech choose <b>feminine</b> -t but masculine tā. This is the reason for the unexpected qamatz vowel written under the final letter of such words.|$|E
5|$|The Old Norse <b>feminine</b> proper noun Hel is {{identical}} to the name of the location over which she rules, Old Norse Hel. The word has cognates in all branches of the Germanic languages, including Old English hell (and thus Modern English hell), Old Frisian helle, Old Saxon hellia, Old High German hella, and Gothic halja. All forms ultimately derive from the reconstructed Proto-Germanic <b>feminine</b> noun *xaljō or *haljō ('concealed place, the underworld'). In turn, the Proto-Germanic form derives from the o-grade form of the Proto-Indo-European root *kel-, *kol-: 'to cover, conceal, save'.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 16, Nécib was {{promoted}} to the senior team by coach Yohan Silvy {{in the latter part}} of the 2002–03 season. While at the club, Nécib was teammates with future national teammate Caroline Pizzala. In the 2003–04 season, Nécib flourished and helped the club reach the Division 3 <b>Féminine</b> league final where they faced the women's team of professional men's club Le Mans. In the tie, Nécib started and played the full match as Celtic cruised to a 4–1 victory. The result promoted the club to the Division 2 <b>Féminine,</b> the second division of French women's football. Nécib's performance that season attracted numerous attention, which resulted in her being nicknamed Titou as homage to Zinedine Zidane, who is nicknamed Zizou.|$|E

5|$|Proto-Germanic *xalja-wītjan (or *halja-wītjan) is reconstructed from Old Norse hel-víti 'hell', Old English helle-wíte 'hell-torment, hell', Old Saxon helli-wīti 'hell', and the Middle High German <b>feminine</b> noun helle-wīze. The {{compound}} is {{a compound}} of *xaljō (discussed above) and *wītjan (reconstructed from forms such as Old English witt 'right mind, wits', Old Saxon gewit 'understanding', and Gothic un-witi 'foolishness, understanding').|$|E

5|$|There {{are several}} {{interpretations of the}} {{symbolism}} behind the commonly represented image of Kaali standing on Shiva's supine form.

5|$|Women in Plymouth Colony {{had more}} {{extensive}} legal and social rights compared to 17th-century European norms.

5|$|Ardhanarishvara {{represents}} {{the synthesis of}} masculine and <b>feminine</b> energies of the universe (Purusha and Prakriti) and illustrates how Shakti, the female principle of God, is inseparable from (or the same as, according to some interpretations) Shiva, the male principle of God.

5|$|Early Old Swedish was {{markedly}} {{different from the}} modern language in {{that it had a}} more complex case structure and also retained the original Germanic three-gender system. Nouns, adjectives, pronouns and certain numerals were inflected in four cases; besides the extant nominative, there were also the genitive (later possessive), dative and accusative. The gender system resembled that of modern German, having masculine, <b>feminine</b> and neuter genders. The masculine and <b>feminine</b> genders were later merged into a common gender with the definite suffix -en and the definite article den, in contrast with the neuter gender equivalents -et and det. The verb system was also more complex: it included subjunctive and imperative moods and verbs were conjugated according to person as well as number. By the 16th century, the case and gender systems of the colloquial spoken language and the profane literature had been largely reduced to the two cases and two genders of modern Swedish.|$|E
