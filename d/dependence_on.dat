5|$|Biodiesel (in its pure form) is a non-toxic, {{biodegradable}} form {{of diesel}} fuel made from vegetable oil, usually soybean oil or recycled restaurant grease.

40|$|The {{interaction}} energy between mesogenic molecules (diphenyl, pentylbiphenyl and 4 -n-octyl- 4 ′-cyanebiphanyl) and the graphite and PE surface has been calculated using atom-atom potentials method. Polar and azimuthal anchoring energies are obtained and their <b>dependences</b> <b>on</b> the order parameter were derived.

30|$|We {{have studied}} the {{capacitance}} effect on the oscillation characteristics and the switching characteristics of the spin torque oscillators (STOs). We found that when the external field is applied, the STO oscillation frequency exhibits various <b>dependences</b> <b>on</b> the capacitance for injected current ranging from 8 to 20 mA. The switching characteristic is featured with the emerging of the canted region; the canted region increases with the capacitance. When the external field is absent, the STO free-layer switching time exhibits different <b>dependences</b> <b>on</b> the capacitance for different injected current. These results help to establish the foundation for capacitance-involved STO modeling.|$|R
40|$|Two {{fundamental}} {{restrictions that}} {{limit the amount}} of instructionlevel parallelism extracted from sequential programs are control flow and data flow. TLSP (Thread-Level Speculative Parallel processing) architecture gains high parallelism using three techniques (speculation with branch prediction, control dependence analysis, executing multiple flows of control) which relax constraints due to control dependences. In this paper, we evaluate the effects of three techniques (memory disambiguation, renaming, value prediction) which relax constraints due to data <b>dependences</b> <b>on</b> TLSP architecture. We have two major results. First, parallelism for TLSP architecture is restricted by enormous output and anti <b>dependences</b> <b>on</b> memory. Second, value prediciton has large effects on TLSP architecture. 1...|$|R

5|$|After its {{introduction}} from South America to Spain {{in the late}} 1500s, the potato became a staple crop throughout Europe by the late 1700s. The potato allowed farmers to produce more food, and initially added variety to the European diet. The increased supply of food reduced disease, increased births and reduced mortality, causing a population boom throughout the British Empire, the US and Europe. The introduction of the potato also brought about the first intensive use of fertilizer, {{in the form of}} guano imported to Europe from Peru, and the first artificial pesticide, {{in the form of an}} arsenic compound used to fight Colorado potato beetles. Before the adoption of the potato as a major crop, the <b>dependence</b> <b>on</b> grain had caused repetitive regional and national famines when the crops failed, including 17 major famines in England between 1523 and 1623. The resulting <b>dependence</b> <b>on</b> the potato however caused the European Potato Failure, a disastrous crop failure from disease that resulted in widespread famine and the death of over one million people in Ireland alone.|$|E
5|$|Alcoholism is characterised by an {{increased}} tolerance to alcohol–which means {{that an individual}} can consume more alcohol–and physical <b>dependence</b> <b>on</b> alcohol, which {{makes it hard for}} an individual to control their consumption. The physical dependency caused by alcohol can lead to an affected individual having a very strong urge to drink alcohol. These characteristics play a role decreasing an alcoholic's ability to stop drinking. Alcoholism can have adverse effects on mental health, causing psychiatric disorders and increasing the risk of suicide. A depressed mood is a common symptom of heavy alcohol drinkers.|$|E

40|$|Relative and {{absolute}} populations of 19 levels in beam-foil-excited neutral helium at 0. 275 MeV have been measured. The singlet angular-momentum sequences show <b>dependences</b> <b>on</b> {{principal quantum number}} consistent with n to the - 3 rd power, but the triplet sequences do not. Singlet and triplet angular-momentum sequences show similar <b>dependences</b> <b>on</b> level excitation energy. Excitation functions for six representative levels were measured {{in the range from}} 0. 160 to 0. 500 MeV. The absolute level populations increase with energy, whereas the neutral fraction of the beam decreases with energy. Further, the P angular-momentum levels are found to be overpopulated with respect to the S and D levels. The overpopulation decreases with increasing principal quantum number...|$|R

The melting point of actinides {{does not have}} a clear <b>dependence</b> <b>on</b> the number of f-electrons. The unusually low melting point of neptunium and plutonium (~640°C) is explained by hybridization of 5f and 6d orbitals and the formation of directional bonds in these metals.|$|E

40|$|The three-point {{function}} in Fourier space is evaluated for an ensemble of 2 D numerical simulations with nine initial power spectra distinguished by spectral index and cutoff. To remove the main <b>dependences</b> <b>on</b> scale and time, {{results are presented}} as the reduced amplitude Q in the hierarchical model. To lowest nonvanishing order in perturbation theory, Q is a constant, independent of length scale, of time, and of initial spectrum. The results show that in the nonlinear regime of evolution, normalizing to Q does remove the main variations, but systematic <b>dependences</b> <b>on</b> spectral index and cutoff remain at late times that depend on properties of the initial spectrum. Models with initial power cut off {{on a scale that}} has been evolved far into the nonlinear regime are indistinguishable from models with no cutoff...|$|R

5|$|Between 1975 and 1990, real {{per capita}} income fell by more than 20%, wiping out almost three decades of {{economic}} development. The manufacturing industry, which had experienced a period of uninterrupted growth until the mid-1970s, began a process of continuous decline. The extreme <b>dependence</b> <b>on</b> state support of the many protected industries exacerbated the sharp fall of the industrial output.

A consortium of three Sydney businesses offered an alternative. They devised a two-year contract whereby Bradman wrote for Associated Newspapers, broadcast on Radio 2UE and promoted the menswear retailing chain FJ Palmer and Son. However, the contract increased Bradman's <b>dependence</b> <b>on</b> his public profile, making it more difficult to maintain the privacy that he ardently desired.|$|E

We report molecular dynamics investigation of potassium chloride solution at low dilution in water at several pressures between 1 bar and 2 kbar. Two different potential models have been employed. One of the models successfully reproduces the experimentally observed trend in ionic conductivity of K + ions in water over the 0. 001 – 2 kbar range. We also propose a theoretical explanation, albeit at a qualitative level, to account for the dependence of ionic conductivity on pressure in terms of the previously studied Levitation Effect. It also provides a microscopic picture in terms of the pore network in liquid water...|$|R
