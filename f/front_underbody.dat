50|$|CMF {{is aimed}} at {{reducing}} manufacturing costs and competing with similar previous concepts as Volkswagen Group's MQB. It consists of five groups of interchangeable, compatible modules: engine bay, cockpit, <b>front</b> <b>underbody,</b> rear underbody and electrical/electronic. According to the companies involved in the development, CMF is not a conventional platform but rather a manufacturing system which {{can be applied to}} different vehicles. The actual platforms are built combining a limited set of common modules: a single module can be used for different platforms, covering different classes of vehicles, and so allowing a greater standardisation of components between both Nissan and Renault. Renault-Nissan announced various variants developed using CMF: CMF-CD for large and mid-sized vehicles (examples are the third-generation Nissan X-Trail and the second-generation Nissan Qashqai), CMF-B for subcompacts/superminis and CMF-A for smaller vehicles. The CMF will initially be used in approximately 14 vehicle models worldwide with an estimated production of 1.6 million units annually. The first CMF vehicles were introduced through 2013 with Nissan's CMF-CD models. The first CMF-A car, the Renault Kwid, was launched into the Indian market in September 2015. The first CMF-B model would be the second-generation Nissan Juke.|$|E

Kodiaq Scout ground clearance {{has gone up}} from 187mm to 194mm, and there have some design changes. These changes include <b>front</b> and rear <b>underbody</b> protection with bumper trim, silver mirror caps, and badging on the front wing and the glove compartment.|$|R

This article presents a method to generate feasible assembly sequences and an approach to select an assembly process that reduces the existing plant modification cost. Assembly sequence design space is combinatorial in nature. Mathematical models to solve the effects of constraints on these spaces and algorithms to efficiently enumerate feasible spaces are explored in this research. Algorithms to search the feasible space to identify assembly process that can reduce the modification cost of the existing assembly plant can help increase utilization of existing resources. A software application that implements the method and algorithms has been developed. The algorithms use the concept of recursive partitioning of set of components to generate assembly sequence space. The assembly processes are then evaluated to determine the process that maximizes resource utilization for new platforms. The application of the proposed approach is demonstrated using automotive <b>underbody</b> <b>front</b> structure family. Key Words: assembly reasoning, assembly sequence design space, assembly resource utilization. 1...|$|R
5000|$|The aft {{part of a}} car {{underbody}} {{is where}} a diffuser is usually located. It works by accelerating the velocity of the airflow underneath the car. The pressure under the car {{is affected by the}} diffuser so that it can expand back to ambient in the diffuser, as the car moves through the air. It uses Bernoulli's principle, such that the pressure decreases while the velocity increases. Since the pressure below the car is lower than on the side and above the car, downforce is produced if implemented correctly. The diffuser [...] "drives" [...] the underbody, which produces the downforce. Front diffusers also exist (especially on Le Mans Prototypes or similar cars); however, they generate downforce purely from momentum exchange with the air, as there is nothing ahead of them to drive. A poorly designed front diffuser can create a low pressure region {{toward the front of the}} car which slows the air behind it down and reduces the effectiveness of the rest of the <b>underbody.</b> <b>Front</b> diffusers usually route air away from the car so that it doesn't affect the rest of the underbody. The air can be vented through a channel or expelled near the front wheels.|$|R
2500|$|The 1966 lineup {{remained}} essentially unchanged from 1965. One {{change of}} note {{was a new}} four-speed synchromesh transmission using the standard Saginaw gear set with 3.11:1 first gear ratio used by other GM 6-cylinder vehicles. The steering column was changed to a two-piece design with universal joint, lessening the danger of intrusion during a front-end collision (actually a mid-1965 running change). [...] A plastic air dam was installed below the front valence panel to conceal the <b>front</b> suspension and <b>underbody,</b> and lessen crosswind sensitivity. In front, The [...] "lock door" [...] emblem (covering the lockset for the trunk lock) was changed from red to blue and featured a shorter bar. Air conditioned cars received a new condenser that was mounted {{in front of the}} engine, eliminating previous efficient but huge, awkward condenser that was mounted atop the engine, requiring its removal out of the way for most underhood servicing. The Corvair script nameplate was moved from atop the trunk lid to a position next to the driver's side headlight bezel. Sales began a decline as a result of Nader's book and the new Mustang that offered V8s up to [...] compared to Corvair's [...] top powertrain. and rumors of the upcoming [...] "Panther'-the code name for the forthcoming Camaro, slated as a direct competitor for the Mustang. A decision was made to discontinue further development of the Corvair. Production for the model year was down to 103,743.|$|R
