5|$|The Firebrand is an 1987 {{historical}} fantasy {{novel by}} American author Marion Zimmer Bradley. Set {{in the ancient}} city of Troy, the novel is a re-telling of Homer's epic poem, the Iliad. The Firebrand is written {{from the point of}} view of Kassandra, the prophet daughter of King Priam of Troy, and also features other prominent characters from Greek mythology. As in the Iliad, Kassandra <b>foresees</b> catastrophe for her city but few pay heed to her warnings. In Bradley's story, Kassandra is presented as a strong and insightful woman, rather than as a sufferer of insanity.|$|E
5|$|UNPROFOR was {{tasked with}} {{creating}} buffer zones between the belligerents, disarming the Croatian Serb Territorial Defence Force troops, overseeing the JNA and HV {{withdrawal from the}} UNPAs, {{and the return of}} refugees to those areas. United Nations Security Council Resolution 743 of 21 February 1992 described the legal basis of the UN mission, requested and agreed upon in November 1991, with no explicit reference to Chapter VI or Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter. Instead, the resolution referred to Chapter VIII of the United Nations Charter, which <b>foresees</b> enforcement through regional arrangements or agencies after further authorization by the UN Security Council.|$|E
5000|$|On June 7, 2011 <b>Foresee</b> Results {{filed for}} declaratory {{judgment}} against Lodsys in northern Illinois, related to Lodsys claims against Adidas, Best Buy and WE Energies. <b>Foresee</b> {{is represented by}} McDermott Will & Emery. The claim by <b>Foresee</b> alleges that several Lodsys patents are invalid. The venue of Northern Illinois was chosen because <b>Foresee</b> asserts that Lodsys actually is doing business there rather than their published Texas location. [...] "..this Court has personal jurisdiction over Lodsys because Lodsys' chief executive officer and sole employee resides in, and conducts business from, this judicial district." [...] Michael Shanahan of McDermott says that the patents at issue (the same as the iPhone lawsuits) are actually invalid. <b>Foresee</b> Results published a press release on November 23, 2011 stating that they had reached a settlement with Lodsys that resolves all outstanding litigation claims between <b>ForeSee</b> and Lodsys and terminates all pending litigation with Lodsys related to <b>ForeSee's</b> products and services, including all such claims against <b>ForeSee's</b> customers.|$|R

At their memorial, Grampa <b>foresees</b> {{the destruction of}} the town, but only Marge takes this seriously. Later that day, Homer dares his son Bart to skateboard naked to Krusty Burger and Bart is arrested by Chief Wiggum. Bart considers their neighbor Ned Flanders a better father figure after Homer refuses {{to take responsibility for the}} incident. Lisa and a new Irish friend named Colin convince the entire town to clean their lake.|$|E
5|$|In 1660 the {{population}} of the town (only including the urban parts of the parish) has been estimated at 1,800, which made it the 10th largest town in Devon and Cornwall. The town's population grew to 2,750 by 1750 (meaning it was the 8th largest town) but it then fell rapidly so that it was only 2,275 by 1805 - only the 23rd largest town in Devon and Cornwall. This fall in population, in a period when many other towns grew rapidly, was probably due to the decline in the importance of the cloth trade in this period. The population of the parish changed little {{from the start of the}} 19th century until the 1970s, remaining at around 3,000 (see chart). However it increased rapidly in the last part of the 20th century and the start of the 21st. Cullompton's population growth looks set to continue as Mid Devon's core strategy <b>foresees</b> 95 new dwellings being built per year in the period to 2026.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} famous legends is about Shishman's final battle. The Ottomans camped at Kostenets, near the origins of the Maritsa river, while the Bulgarians were near Samokov, on a hill. After a fierce battle, Ivan Shishman was wounded seven times and retreated to the fortress, where he died; on the {{battlefield}} seven springs appeared, one for each of the emperor's wounds. He is also said to have fought in the Balkan mountains at Shishkin grad ("Shishman's town"), between Sliven and Kazanlak, where he killed 10,000 janissaries in a huge battle. The 18th century Bulgarian enlightener Paisius of Hilendar wrote in his Istoriya Slavyanobolgarskaya that during the siege of Tarnovo Ivan Shishman managed to reach Sofia with his boyars. He hid his treasury in the Iskar gorge and fought against the Turks for seven years before dying in battle. Some versions suggest that Kokalyanski Urvich remained the last fortress to fall and before Shishman died he buried treasure under the castle and tried to escape by cutting a passage through the mountain. The repeating motif of the treasure is a sacral symbol of the Bulgarian statehood and the usual locations of the imperial jewellery are monasteries, lakes or hideouts under rivers. Being undiscovered by the invaders, the treasure symbolises the sovereignty and power of the Bulgarian Empire and its inevitable resurrection. There are also a number of parallels between the legends about Ivan Shishman and the hagiography of saints, especially John of Rila, including the almost identical route of the emperor, Tarnovo-Sofia-Samokov in Rila, and the route of the return of the relics of Saint John of Rila to the Rila Monastery in 15th century – Tarnovo-Sofia-Rila, and also the motif of the immortal rulers who <b>foresees</b> the restoration of the country.|$|E

40|$|AbstractUsing {{expected}} utility {{theory to}} choose the best decision presumes that the decision maker can specify the utility of various alternative decisions {{for each of the}} possible events that might occur. Since decision makers can rarely <b>foresee</b> all possible eventualities, extending Bayesian probability theory to treat unforeseen events is essential to applying expected utility theory to certain problems. We propose that Bayesian theory accommodate unforeseen events by classifying them as similar to sets of <b>foreseen</b> events using similarity templates. The resulting extension of the individual's subjective probabilities to the space of <b>foreseen</b> and unforeseen redefines subjective probabilities over the power set of the set of all <b>foreseen</b> events. This leads to a new probability function over the space of <b>foreseen</b> events-which is the pignistic probability from the transferable belief model...|$|R

40|$|Increasing market {{pressure}} is forcing manufacturing companies to improve product lead times and quality at reduced cost. An important approach aimed at tackling these problems is to generate manufacturing/assembly system models concurrently {{with the design}} solutions of a component. A designer can therefore make product design decisions while having access to, and interacting with, the evolving 'virtual' manufacturing system models. This allows designers to <b>foresee</b> any potential manufacturing problems caused by design decisions. This paper presents an approach that proactively supports designers in making informed design decisions, through the timely revelation of knowledge about manufacturing and assembly processes. Such knowledge, when provided early in the design process, allows designers to avoid negative implications and to use positive ones. Based on this approach, a knowledge-intensive computer aided design (KICAD) prototype tool, named <b>FORESEE,</b> has been developed. <b>FORESEE</b> is a proof-of-concept system and allows designers to <b>foresee</b> and explore manufacturing and assembly consequences caused by design decisions, as {{the design of a}} mechanical component evolves. The paper presents an outline of the KICAD approach, together with a brief description of <b>FORESEE's</b> architecture and implementation. The application of <b>FORESEE</b> is demonstrated through a thermoplastic component design case study. <b>FORESEE</b> has been evaluated by practising designers. Evaluation results indicate that the approach has the potential proactively to support component design...|$|R
