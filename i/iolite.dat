By the 17th century, increasing exploration and trade led to increased availability {{of a wide variety of}} gemstones as well as exposure to the art of other cultures. Whereas prior to this the working of gold and precious metal had been at the forefront of jewellery, this period saw increasing dominance of gemstones and their settings. An example of this is the Cheapside Hoard, the stock of a jeweller hidden in London during the Commonwealth period and not found again until 1912. It contained Colombian emerald, topaz, amazonite from Brazil, spinel, <b>iolite,</b> and chrysoberyl from Sri Lanka, ruby from India, Afghan lapis lazuli, Persian turquoise, Red Sea peridot, as well as Bohemian and Hungarian opal, garnet, and amethyst. Large stones were frequently set in box-bezels on enamelled rings. Notable among merchants of the period was Jean-Baptiste Tavernier, who brought the precursor stone of the Hope Diamond to France in the 1660s.|$|E

30|$|The {{quantitative}} distribution maps of {{trace elements}} in two agate samples were acquired {{by a series}} of equally long line scan and a subsequent merging of line scans with <b>Iolite</b> software. These maps have particularly shown the fluctuations and concentrations of trace elements in the agate samples which cannot be visualized by conventional spot analysis. The colorful agate sample showed a variation of trace elements from Fe-rich inner half to Mn-rich outer half. The quantitative maps of the blue agate sample showed a correlative distribution relationship between Al and Ti, but an antithetic distribution relationship between Al and Fe. The distribution patterns resulted mainly from alternating microcrystalline quartz-rich and chalcedony bands. The detection limits of quantitative maps in the study were estimated as several parts per million levels with the RSD values of ca. 10  %, whereas those of X-ray qualitative maps as 100 – 200  ppm. These results clearly demonstrate that LA-ICP-MS can provide valuable data for interpretations of compositional variations in association with microstructures, chemical/physical phase boundaries, and geological and environmental heterogeneous samples.|$|E

We {{summarize}} {{here the}} occurrence {{of a number of}} semiprecious stones within a major gemstone belt in the Palghat-Cauvery shear zone system close to the northern margin of the Madurai Granulite Block, southern India. The gem mineralization in this belt includes different varieties of corundum (star ruby, sapphire), cordierite (<b>iolite),</b> feldspar (moonstones and sunstone of various hues), beryl (emerald, aquamarine), chrysoberyl (alexandrite), kornerupine, topaz, spinel, crystal quartz and amethyst, among others. Gem mineralisation has not been directly dated, but is associated with pegmatites that crosscut rocks metamorphosed in late Neoproterozoic/Early Cambrian times. Similar aged gem mineralization occurs south of the Achankovil Shear Zone in southern India, as well as in Sri Lanka and Madagascar and strengthen the view of a broad late Neoproterozoic-early Cambrian gemstone province in central Gondwana. The ruby mineralization within this belt can be correlated with similar occurrences in eastern Madagascar, supporting a correlation between the Malagasy Betsimisaraka suture zone and the Palghat-Cauvery shear zone system in southern India.

40|$|In situ laser {{ablation}} quadrupole {{inductively coupled plasma}} mass spectrometry {{was used to measure}} Pb isotopes in galena. Data acquisition was optimized by adjusting spot size, energy density, and ablation time to obtain near steady-state low relative standard deviation (%RSD) signals. Standard-sample bracketing using in-house Broken Hill galena as external reference standard was used and offline data reduction was carried out using VizualAge for <b>Iolite</b> 3. Using this methodology, galena grain in polished thin sections from selected massive sulphide deposits of the Bathurst Mining Camp, Canada, were tested and compared to previously published data. Absolute values and errors on the weighted mean of ~ 20 individual analyses from each sample compared favourably with whole-rock Pb-Pb isotope data. This approach provides a mean to obtain rapid, accurate, and moderately (0. 1 % 2 σ) precise Pb isotope measurements in galena and is particularly well suited for exploratory or reconnaissance studies. Further refinement of this approach may be useful in exploration for volcanogenic massive sulphides deposits and might be a useful vectoring tool when complemented with other conventional exploration techniques...|$|E
40|$|Several {{diffusion}} {{experiments were}} conducted in a piston cylinder device {{across a range of}} oxygen fugacities (FMQ- 3 FMQ- 1. 2, FMQ+ 6) at 1 GPa and 1300 C. This was done to explore the effects of oxygen fugacity (fO 2) on diffusivity of redox sensitive trace elements. This allows investigation of how these elements diffuse across the fO 2 range encountered in different reservoirs on planets and moons in our solar system. The University of Rochester LA-ICP-MS system was used for analysis of samples. Analyses were conducted using an Agilent 7900 quadrupole mass spectrometer connected to a Photon Machines 193 nm G 2 laser ablation (LA) system equipped with a HelEx 2 -volume sample chamber.

40|$|Precise and {{accurate}} U?Pb LA-ICPMS dating of many U-bearing accessory minerals (e. g. apatite, allanite, titanite and rutile) is often compromised by common Pb. LA-ICPMS dating of these U-bearing accessory phases typically requires a matrix-matched standard, and data reduction is often complicated by variable incorporation of common Pb not only into the unknowns but particularly into the reference material. We present here a general approach to common Pb correction in U?Pb LA-ICP-MS dating using {{a modified version}} of the VizualAge U-Pb data reduction package for <b>Iolite</b> (VizualAge_UcomPbine). The key feature of the method is that it can correct for variable amounts of common Pb in any U-Pb accessory mineral standard as long as the standard is concordant in the U/Pb (and Th/Pb) systems following common Pb correction. Common Pb correction of the age standard can be undertaken using either the 204 Pb, 207 Pb or 208 Pb(no Th) methods, and the approach can be applied to raw data files from all widely used modern multi-collector and single-collector ICPMS instruments. VizualAge_UcomPbine first applies a common Pb correction to the user-selected age standard integrations and then fits session-wide ?model? U-Pb fractionation curves to the time-resolved U-Pb standard data. This downhole fractionation model is applied to the unknowns and sample-standard bracketing (using a user-specified interpolation method) is used to calculate final isotopic ratios and ages. 204 Pb- and 208 Pb(no Th) -corrected concordia diagrams and 204 Pb-, 207 Pb- and 208 Pb(no Th) -corrected age channels can be calculated for user-specified initial Pb ratio(s). All other conventional common Pb correction methods (e. g. intercept or isochron methods on co-genetic analyses) can be performed offline. The approach was tested on apatite and titanite age standards (for which there are independent constraints on the U-Pb crystallization age) using a Thermo Scientific iCAP-Qc (Q-ICP-MS) coupled to a Photon Machines Analyte Excite 193 nm ArF Excimer laser. Madagascar apatite, OLT 1 titanite and R 10 rutile were used as primary standards and were corrected for variable common Pb using the new VizualAge_UcomPbine DRS. The secondary Durango (31. 44 ? 0. 18 Ma) apatite standard yielded a U-Pb TW concordia intercept age of 31. 97 ? 0. 59 Ma (MSWD = 1. 09; primary standard corrected by the 207 Pb-method) and a U-Pb concordia age of 31. 82 ? 0. 40 Ma (MSWD = 1. 4; primary standard corrected by the 204 Pb-method). McClure Mountain (523. 51 ? 1. 47 Ma) yielded a U-Pb TW concordia intercept age of 524. 5 ? 3. 7 Ma (MSWD = 0. 72) while the Fish Canyon Tuff (28. 201 ? 0. 046 Ma) and Khan (522. 2 ? 2. 2 Ma) titanite standards yielded U-Pb TW concordia intercept ages of 28. 78 ? 0. 41 Ma (MSWD = 1. 4) and 520. 9 ? 3. 9 Ma (MSWD = 4. 2) respectively. The suitability of the 208 Pb(no Th) -correction is demonstrated by the agreement between a U-Pb TW concordia intercept age of 452. 6 ? 4. 7 Ma (MSWD = 0. 89) and a 208 Pb(no Th) -corrected TW concordia age of 448. 6 ? 4. 5 Ma (MSWD = 1. 4) on a c. 450 Ma rutile which exhibits variable incorporation of common Pb. A range of LA-ICPMS U-Pb dating applications are presented and include U-Pb dating of apatite from > 3. 8 Ga gneisses from Akilia, SW Greenland. These apatites host 13 C-depleted graphite inclusions that are interpreted as biogenic in origin and representing the oldest indications of life on Earth. The U-Pb age profiles on single apatite grains presented here are characteristic of Pb loss by volume diffusion with core-rim age differences of up to 300 Ma. These data explain the scatter and poor precision of earlier U-Pb apatite age determinations on Akilia apatite. Other LA-ICPMS dating applications include U-Pb apatite dating as a rapid method for determining the age of mafic intrusions, U-Pb titanite and apatite dating of ash fall tuffs, determining temperature-time histories using multiple U-Pb thermochronometers and improving concordance in LA-ICPMS primary zircon standard datasets by analysing young, common Pb-bearing primary zircon standards that have not accumulated significant radiation damage...|$|E
