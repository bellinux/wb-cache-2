40|$|Background: Patients without {{adequate}} abdominal-wall transillumination {{are at a}} high risk of developing complications after PEG. Objective: We evaluated the feasibility and utility of EUS to <b>guide</b> <b>PEG</b> in patients lacking abdominal-wall transillumination. Design: Single-center case series. Setting: Tertiary-referral center. Patients: Six patients who lacked adequate abdominal-wall transillumination and 2 patients with a large laparotomy scar deemed to be at high risk of developing complications after PEG. Interventions: Patients underwent EUS-guided PEG and deployment of a standard enteral feeding tube. Main Outcome Measurements: Technical success and complication rates. Results: PEG was Successful Under EUS guidance in 5 of 8 patients. Causes of failure included all inadequate EUS window because of a prior Billroth 1 gastrectomy in one and suspected bowel interposition in 2 patients. There were no complications. Limitations: A small number of patients, uncontrolled study, and short follow-up period. Conclusions: This technique may facilitate deployment of PEG in patients who lack adequate abdominal-wall transillumination...|$|E
40|$|Background: Enteral feeding {{should be}} {{considered}} for patients with an intact and functional gastrointestinal tract. Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement is indicated in patients requiring medium to long term enteral feeding (> 30 days) and with impaired swallowing. Previously placed PEG tube can dislodge or be inadvertently removed, blocked, or damaged. Gastrostomy tube replacement is not infrequently performed. Patients and methods: In this video manuscript, the author demonstrates step-by-step PEG tube replacement in several clinical scenarios: standard gastrostomy feeding tube (with internal retention balloon or with internal collapsible bumper) removal and replacement; low-profile feeding tube replacement; and feeding tube replacement over a wire <b>guide.</b> Conclusions: <b>PEG</b> tube replacement can be easily replaced at bed-side in most cases. Occasionally, in difficult cases gastrostomy feeding tube replacement needs endoscopic guidance and assistance...|$|R
40|$|We {{review the}} radio very long {{baseline}} interferometry (VLBI) {{observations of the}} <b>guide</b> star, IM <b>Peg,</b> and three compact extragalactic reference sources, made {{in support of the}} NASA/Stanford gyroscope relativity mission, Gravity Probe B (GP-B). The main goal of the observations was the determination of the proper motion of IM Peg relative to the distant Universe. VLBI observations made between 1997 and 2005 yield a proper motion of IM Peg of 1 0. 09 mas yr- 1 in 3 ̆b 1 and 1 0. 09 mas yr- 1 in 3 ̆b 4 in a celestial reference frame of extragalactic radio galaxies and quasars virtually identical to the International Celestial Reference Frame 2 (ICRF 2). They also yield a parallax for IM Peg of 10. 37 1 0. 07 mas, corresponding to a distance of 96. 4 1 0. 7 pc. The uncertainties are standard errors with statistical and estimated systematic contributions added in quadrature. These results met the pre-launch requirements of the GP-B mission to not discernibly degrade the estimates of the geodetic and frame-dragging effects. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
40|$|In the U. S., about 200, 000 {{people are}} {{currently}} living with {{spinal cord injury}} (SCI). An estimated of 50 %– 70 % of all SCI cases occurs in the range of ages between 15 – 35 years old. The destructive neurotrauma results in the majority of adult disability, even after patients suffering with SCI survived from the acute death. There are two stages involved in the progression of SCI, the primary stage and the secondary stage. The primary stage is mainly the mechanical damage to the central nervous system. The rapid collapse of the integrity of cell membrane and tissue is often one of the initial onsets. Centered by the cascade of biochemical disruption, such as aldehyde toxins, the secondary injury is responsible for the major clinical deficits in sensory and motor functions. Available pharmacological treatment for SCI includes high doses of steroids. However, the side effects of steroid therapy leave patients more susceptible for complications, such as infections, chronic pain and blood clots. The absence of “standard of care” have triggered waves of intense research leading to “finding a cure for SCI”. Based on our previous successful explorations of the neuroprotection by chitosan and chitosan nanoparticles (Chi-NPs) in SCI related cell and tissue studies, we further investigated the neuroprotective effects based on two major characteristics of chitosan: (1) molecular weight (MW) and (2) degree of acetylation (DA). Our results demonstrated that chitosan polymer blocked the random exchange of a probe, tetramethyl-rodamine (TMR) and an endogenous protein, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), across mechanically compromised cell membrane, while a significant difference of the membrane “sealing” effect was not suggested among different MWs and DAs of chitosan polymer. A similar affinity of FITC-chitosan polymer at intact and injured spinal tissues was also suggested. To push the use of chitosan a step towards clinical tests, we incorporated the advantage of nanomedicine with our “promising chitosan material”. Different factors were investigated during the formation and the storage of Chi F-NPs. Two types of Chi-NPs (chitosan-triphosphate, Chi-TPPNPs and chitosan-dextran sulfate, Chi-DSNPs) were synthesized, with a range of size at 100 – 300 nm and zeta-potentials of 30. 65 mV and - 47. 4 mV, based on an ionic gelation method. Chi-DSNPs were shown to rescue necrotic BV- 2 cells induced by a short incubation of hydrogen peroxide at 5. 5 mM. In addition, the conduction of somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) through the lesion produced by the compression injury was partially restored after 1 week of the subcutaneous administration of Chi-DSNPs. We also found that polyethylene glycol (PEG) -coated silica NPs were significantly accumulated at the compression injured spinal tissues. The affinity of NPs at severed cell membranes was <b>guided</b> by <b>PEG.</b> Our experimental findings suggested that chitosan and Chi-NPs provided neuroprotective effects using both in vitro and in vivo models. ...|$|R
