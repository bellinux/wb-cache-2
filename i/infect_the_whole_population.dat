40|$|We {{present an}} {{approach}} {{to the question of}} evaluating worm defenses against future, yet unseen and possibly defense-aware worm behavior. Our scheme employs model checking to produce worm propagation sequences that defeat a worm defense of interest. We demonstrate this approach using an exemplar collaborative worm defense, in which LANs share alerts about encountered infections. Through model checking experiments, we then generate propagation sequences that are able to <b>infect</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>population</b> in the modeled network. We discuss these experimental results and also identify open problems in applying formal methods more generally in the context of worm quarantine research. ...|$|E
40|$|Amyloodinium {{infection}} of rabbit fish Siganus javus in the mini-hatchery recirculation system appeared suddenly causing high mortality. The parasite developed {{rapidly in the}} closed system and might <b>infect</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> fish <b>population</b> within short period with subsequent mortality to <b>the</b> <b>infected</b> fish. Under stereomicroscope, gills of fish were seen infected by massive amount of trophont stage of the parasite. Histopathological analysis of infected tissues showed that parasite caused hyperplasia to almost entire gills, fusion of lamella and eventually disrupting and degeneration of heavy infected tissues. Infection of monogenean Haliotrema sp were also recorded but no significant pathological changes caused by this parasite was observed, The parasite can tolerate wide range of salinity from 20 to 40 ppt, but completely undeveloped in freshwater and very low salinity. In vitro test showed interference of tested chemicals {{to the development of}} tomont in high concentration and length of exposure. Strategy to control this parasite should be combination of chemicals, applied regularly, and other prophylaxis methods...|$|R
