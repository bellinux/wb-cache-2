By then, it had flown over 222 hours in Finnish service.|$|E

She wrote in a style that combined secondary sources, memoir, anecdote, and her own opinions. Her political views are most obvious in the Italian Lives, where she supports the Italian independence movement and promotes republicanism; in the French Lives she portrays women sympathetically, explaining their political and social restrictions and arguing that women can be productive members of society if given the proper educational and social opportunities.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{his success}} with the Brewers, the team was {{struggling}} and not likely to make a playoff run. When talks on a contract extension broke down, the team traded Greinke to the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim on July 27 in exchange for top infield prospect Jean Segura and pitchers Ariel Peña and Johnny Hellweg. Brewers General Manager Doug Melvin remarked {{that it was one}} of the tougher decisions he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> because he was very fond of Greinke.|$|E

The following day, flying his Messerschmitt Bf 109, Geißhardt <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> an emergency landing behind Polish lines. After several hours in Polish captivity, he escaped during the confusion caused by a German Stuka (Dive Bomber) attack. He reached German lines after walking for five days.|$|E

5|$|Harold Godwinson's {{victory was}} short-lived, {{as only a}} few weeks later he was {{defeated}} by William the Conqueror at the Battle of Hastings. The fact that Harold <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a forced march to fight Hardrada at Stamford Bridge and then move at utmost speed south to meet the Norman invasion, all in less than three weeks, is widely seen as a primary factor in William's victory at Hastings.|$|E
5|$|In a 1979 {{interview}} in The Videophile newsletter, Muntz revealed {{the biggest problem}} for the Stereo-Pak business was returned merchandise. He explained that when reproducing the work of major artists like The Beatles, the Stereo-Pak plant <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> {{hundreds of thousands of}} cartridges. But once a popular album became less popular, retailers would return the unsold cartridges, expecting credit towards new titles. Muntz was unprepared for the returns and said the huge cost of unsold merchandise eventually made his Stereo-Pak business unprofitable.|$|E

5|$|Indiana Jones is {{distributed}} by one entity, Paramount, but owned by another, Lucasfilm. The pre-production arrangement {{between the two}} organizations granted Paramount 12.5% of the film's revenue. As the $185 million budget was larger than the original $125 million estimate, Lucas, Spielberg and Ford turned down large upfront salaries so Paramount could cover the film's costs. In order for Paramount to see a profit beyond its distribution fee, the film <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> over $400 million. At that point, Lucas, Spielberg, Ford and those with smaller profit-sharing deals would also begin to collect their cut.|$|E

Like many women artists in the nineteenth century, Louise <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> do with training intended for industrial designers and art teachers rather than fine artists.

5|$|Mary {{had always}} {{rejected}} the break with Rome instituted {{by her father}} {{and the establishment of}} Protestantism by her brother's regents.

By the end of 1554, the pope had approved the deal, and the Heresy Acts were revived.|$|E
