5|$|The {{flora and}} fauna of Stroma {{are similar to those}} of the mainland. The island is treeless; its {{vegetation}} consists primarily of grasses, heather and small flowers. Seals are plentiful along its shores and are sometimes found inland during the breeding season. Both grey seals and harbour seals are present, with around 650 <b>grey</b> <b>seal</b> pups being born each year. Otters may also be present, as in other parts of mainland Caithness. The western cliffs are the site of colonies of terns, guillemots, fulmars and eider ducks. The cliffs are designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest within the North Caithness Cliffs Special Protection Area. The waters off Stroma support a number of cetacean species including minke whale, white-beaked dolphin and harbour porpoise.|$|E
5|$|Two {{wild animal}} taxa {{are unique to}} St Kilda: the St Kilda wren (Troglodytes troglodytes hirtensis), which is a {{subspecies}} of the Eurasian wren, and a subspecies of wood mouse known as the St Kilda field mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus hirtensis). A third taxon endemic to St Kilda, a subspecies of house mouse known as the St Kilda house mouse (Mus musculus muralis), vanished completely after the departure of human inhabitants, as it was strictly associated with settlements and buildings. It {{had a number of}} traits in common with a sub-species (Mus musculus mykinessiensis) found on Mykines island in the Faroe Islands. The <b>grey</b> <b>seal</b> (Halichoerus grypus) now breeds on Hirta but did not do so before the 1930 evacuation.|$|E
40|$|Since tagging of <b>grey</b> <b>seals</b> in Great Britain was {{initiated}} in 1951, {{a total of}} 61 seals has been recovered in coastal Norwegian waters. Most of the recovered seals had been tagged at the Orkney (35 recoveries) and the Farne Islands (17 recoveries) and captured in fishing gear on the southwestern coast of Norway. Recovery rates are highest from the Orkney and Shetland breeding stocks (about 12 and 10 per thousand). Among the total of 61 recoveries, 58 were recovered within six months after tagging, two after three years and one after five years. We assume that after arriving in coastal Norwegian waters, the British <b>grey</b> <b>seals</b> are equally vulnerable to recovery as Norwegian <b>grey</b> <b>seals</b> of the same age. Using a known recovery rate of Norwegian <b>grey</b> <b>seals,</b> the total immigration from Great Britain {{is estimated to be}} about 14300 seals through the period 1960 - 1981 with an average of about 650 seals per year.

5|$|Lek {{systems are}} known to exist among some populations of walruses. These males cluster around females and try to attract them with {{elaborate}} courtship displays and vocalizations. Lekking may also exist among California sea lions, South American fur seals, New Zealand sea lions and harbor seals. In some species, including elephant seals and grey seals, males will try to lay claim to the desired females and defend them from rivals. Elephant seal males establish dominance hierarchies with the highest ranking males—the alpha males—maintaining harems {{of as many as}} 30–100 females. These males commonly disrupt the copulations of their subordinates while they themselves can mount without inference. They will, however, break off mating to chase off a rival. <b>Grey</b> <b>seal</b> males usually claim a location among a cluster of females whose members may change over time. Male harp seals, crabeater seals and hooded seals follow and defend lactating females in their vicinity—usually one or two at a time,—and wait for them to reach estrus.|$|E
5|$|Mountain hare (apparently {{absent from}} Skye in the 18th century) and rabbit are now {{abundant}} and predated on by wild cat and pine marten. Red deer are common {{on the hills}} and the <b>grey</b> <b>seal</b> and common seal are present around the coasts of Scotland in internationally important numbers, with colonies of the former found on Oronsay and the Treshnish Isles and the latter most abundant in the Firth of Lorn. The rich fresh water streams contain brown trout, Atlantic salmon and water shrew. Offshore minke whales, killer whales, basking sharks, porpoises and dolphins are among the sea life {{that can be seen}} and edible crab and oyster are also found, in for example, the Sound of Scalpay. There are nationally important horse mussel and brittlestar beds in the sea lochs.|$|E
5|$|Lundy {{is home to}} {{an unusual}} range of mammals, almost all introduced, {{including}} a distinct breed of wild pony, the Lundy pony. Until recently, Lundy and the Shiant Isles in the Hebrides {{were the only two}} places in the UK where the black rat (Rattus rattus) could be found regularly. In the rest of the United Kingdom they have largely been replaced by brown rats except for occasional sightings in port towns and the Thames Estuary. It has since been eradicated on the island, {{in order to protect the}} nesting seabirds. Other species which have made the island their home include the <b>grey</b> <b>seal</b> (Halichoerus grypus), Sika deer (Cervus nippon), pygmy shrew (Sorex minutus) and feral goats (Capra aegagrus hircus). Unusually, 20% of the rabbits (Leporidae) on the island are melanistic compared with 4% which is typical in the UK. In mid-2006 the rabbit population was devastated by myxomatosis, leaving only 60 pairs from the previous 15–20,000 individuals. Soay sheep (Ovis aries) on the island have been shown to vary their behaviours according to nutritional requirements, the distribution of food and the risk of predation.|$|E

40|$|The Seal Rehabilitation and Research Centre (SRRC) in Pieterburen, The Netherlands, rehabilitates seals {{from the}} waters of the Wadden Sea, North Sea and Southwest Delta area. Incidental {{observations}} of albinism and melanism in common and <b>grey</b> <b>seals</b> are known from countries surrounding the North Sea. However, observations on colour aberrations have not been systematically recorded. To obtain the frequency of occurrence of these colour aberrations, we analysed data of all seals admitted to our centre over the past 38 years. In the period 1971 - 2008, 3000 common seals (Phoca vitulina) were rehabilitated, as well as 1200 <b>grey</b> <b>seals</b> (Halichoerus grypus). A total of five albinistic common seals and four melanistic <b>grey</b> <b>seals</b> were identified. This results in an estimated incidence of albinism in common seals of approximately 1 / 600, and of melanism in <b>grey</b> <b>seals</b> of approximately 1 / 300. The seals displayed normal behaviour, although in the albinistic animals, a photophobic reaction was observed in daylight. (C) Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2010...|$|R
25|$|The {{ice cover}} {{is the main}} habitat for two large mammals, the <b>grey</b> <b>seal</b> (Halichoerus grypus) and the Baltic ringed seal (Pusa hispida botnica), both of which feed {{underneath}} the ice and breed on its surface. Of these two seals, only the Baltic ringed seal suffers when there is not adequate ice in the Baltic Sea, as it feeds its young only while on ice. The <b>grey</b> <b>seal</b> is adapted to reproducing also with no ice in the sea. The sea ice also harbours several species of algae {{that live in the}} bottom and inside unfrozen brine pockets in the ice.|$|E
25|$|The seals are the ringed seal, {{the harp}} seal and the <b>grey</b> <b>seal.</b> These animals {{for the most}} part were common in the Littorina Sea but are not found in the Baltic Sea now. Again, they could have been taken on land or in the shallows.|$|E

40|$|Between 2007 and 2015, we {{recorded}} three cases of asphyxiation of <b>grey</b> <b>seals</b> Halichoerus grypus caused by fish {{lodged in the}} respiratory tract. In all cases, the fish involved was a common sole Solea solea, and it had {{found its way to}} the trachea of the unfortunate seal, completely blocking it. That this fish species was involved, is not surprising: it has a very agile body, with a spectacular ability to bend longitudinally into a circular shape, as well as laterally into the form of a cigar – the way it was found in the gluttonous <b>grey</b> <b>seals.</b> The common sole currently occurs abundantly in coastal waters of the southern North Sea, and it constitutes an important prey for <b>grey</b> <b>seals.</b> Asphyxiation due to fish has been described in odontocetes, including in harbour porpoise Phocoena phocoena, bottlenose dolphin Tursiops truncatus, and very recently in long-finned pilot whale Globicephala melas. To our knowledge however, this cause of death has not been described before in <b>grey</b> <b>seals.</b> Furthermore, the significance of this cause of mortality in a single population has not been documented, with in particular aspects of prey abundance, seal behaviour and the limited number of stranded adult <b>grey</b> <b>seals</b> that are being investigated to be considered...|$|R
40|$|The {{project was}} carried out from the {{beginning}} of May to the beginning of July 1994, at Seal Sands, in the Tees estuary. The study aimed to examine (i) ecological and (ii) behavioural aspects of two species of seals, common seals (Phoca vitulina) and <b>grey</b> <b>seals</b> (Halichoerus grypus). The aims of the study were (i) : (a) to document the seasonal fluctuation in number of seals using haul-out sites during May and June, (b) To compare activities between day and night time, (c) To examine possible factors influencing the proportion of the Tees population of common and <b>grey</b> <b>seals</b> hauling-out at Seal Sands, and factors conditioning haul- out site choice, (ii) : (a) To examine distribution on haul-out sites and haul-out site fidelity, group and individual behaviour, (b) To determine vigilance behaviour in common and <b>grey</b> <b>seals</b> in relation to time of the day and group size. The number of seals hauled-out at Seal Sands, varied from day to day and night to night, and between successive low tides. The common seal number hauling-out, varied from a minimum of 13 to a maximum of 39, at day time, and from 9 to 15 at night time, these number increased gradually during the study period. The number of <b>grey</b> <b>seals</b> varied from nil on two occasions to 27 at daytime, and from 2 to 26 at night time. Both high and low number of common and <b>grey</b> <b>seals</b> tended to occur on the same days. The number of animals hauling out could be influenced by both environmental factors and population size at Teesmouth. Numbers of common seals at site C during day time was significantly and inversely related to the tide level at low water. The numbers of <b>grey</b> <b>seals</b> at site C at night time were inversely related to wind speed and positively related to maximum temperature. The changes in sites use are discussed in relation to physical characteristics of the sites and tide levels. Common and <b>grey</b> <b>seals</b> were observed to haul-out in restricted areas, although space availability was not a limiting factor. Common seals showed site fidelity both as individuals and as a group. <b>Grey</b> <b>seals,</b> show site fidelity as a group. Vigilance behaviour varied considerably within the two species of seals. In relation to the time of the day, the percentage of common seals alert, tended to decrease progressively after low tide. The percentage of <b>grey</b> <b>seals</b> alert was lower than in common seals with few peaks caused by sudden disturbance. Common seals show a strong negative correlation between the percentage of individuals alert and group size, whereas <b>grey</b> <b>seals</b> did not show any relation {{to the size of the}} group...|$|R

25|$|Toxicants {{may also}} cause {{endocrine}} disruption through {{interacting with the}} estrogen receptor. This mechanism has been well-studied with PCBs. These chemicals {{have been used as}} coolants and lubricants in transformers and other electrical equipment due to their insulating properties. A purely anthropogenic substance, PCBs are no longer in production in the United States due to the adverse health effects associated with exposure, but they are highly persistent and are still widespread in the environment. PCBs are a xenoestrogen, which elicit an enhancing (rather than inhibiting) response, and are mediated by the estrogen receptor. These are often referred to as estrogen mimics because they mimic the effects of estrogen. PCBs often build up in sediments and bioaccumulate in organisms. These chemicals diffuse into the nucleus and bind to the estrogen receptor. The estrogen receptor is kept in an inactive conformation through interactions with proteins such as heat shock proteins 59, 70, and 90. After the toxicant binding occurs, the estrogen receptor is activated and forms a homodimer complex which seeks out estrogen response elements in the DNA. The binding of the complex to these elements causes a rearrangement of the chromatin and transcription of the gene, resulting in production of a specific protein. In doing this, PCBs elicit an estrogenic response which can affect numerous functions within the organism. These effects are observed in various aquatic species. The levels of PCBs in marine mammals are often very high as a result of bioaccumulation. Studies have demonstrated that PCBs are responsible for reproductive impairment in the harbor seal (Phoca vitulina). Similar effects have been found in the <b>grey</b> <b>seal</b> (Halichoerus grypus), the ringed seal (Pusa hispida) and the California sea lion (Zalophys californinus). In the grey seals and ringed seals, uterine occlusions and stenosis were found which led to sterility. If exposed to a xenoestrogen such as PCBs, male fish have also been seen to produce vitellogenin. Vitellogenin is an egg protein female fish normally produce but is not usually present in males except at very low concentrations. This is often used as a biomarker for EDCs.|$|E
