However, in this case, very good control of the reference speed of the shaft was maintained in spite <b>of</b> the <b>gear</b> <b>backlash.</b> The problem was that the commanded torques were excessively large and threatened to damage the gear box. This problem motivated a complete analysis of the systems dynamics including the development of a model to better understand the response and allow the identification of external loads on the system. It was found that the method of sensing the shaft position (resolvers) was a major factor as well as the upgrading of the motor which was over responding to disturbances in the shaft. The model was validated using several torque limiting experiments and gave accurate prediction of the machine’s major dynamics.

40|$|In this dissertation, {{the concept}} of {{transmission}} lines for topological synthesis <b>of</b> articulated <b>gear</b> mechanisms is introduced. It is shown that the structure matrix, which related input displacements to the joint angles of a multi-degree-of- freedom articulated gear mechanisms, can be derived using {{the concept of}} transmission lines. Applying {{the characteristics of the}} structure matrix, a new methodology for the topological synthesis <b>of</b> articulated <b>gear</b> mechanisms has been established. All the basic admissible structure matrices of conventional, three-DOF (degree-of-freedom), geared robotic mechanisms have been enumerated. Furthermore, an innovative concept for the control <b>of</b> <b>gear</b> <b>backlash</b> in robotic mechanisms has been conceived. The concept utilizes redundant unidirectional drives to assure positive coupling <b>of</b> <b>gear</b> meshes at all time. It is shown that, through proper arrangement <b>of</b> <b>gear</b> trains, <b>backlash</b> <b>of</b> an N-DOF robotic mechanism can be completely eliminated by a minimum of (N + 1) unidirectional drives. A methodology for the enumeration of admissible RBR (Redundant-drive Backlash-free Robotic) mechanisms has been established. This class of mechanisms also has the fail-safe advantage in that, unless there is loss of backlash control, the mechanisms can continue to function whenever any one of its actuators fails. The actuator sizing has been studied for a general class of N-DOF RBR mechanisms. The actuator torques are given in term of either the joint torques or the end-effector dynamical performance requirement. The methodology for the determination of actuator size can also be applied to tendon-driven robotic mechanisms. Frictional forces in gear-coupled robotic mechanisms can have significant effect on the manipulator dynamics and control and are therefore also included in this study. Gearing efficiency for various gear drives, e. g., two mating gears, N mating gears with a common carrier, and gear trains, has been investigated. As an example, the frictional effect has been demonstrated where it involves the dynamics of a two-DOF RBR arm. In order to demonstrate this concept, a two- DOF experimental RBR arm has been constructed. A computed torque with PD control scheme is implemented in the experimental RBR robot. An experiment using a laser tracking system to verify the improvement of repeatability was conducted. In order to compare the performance difference, two control algorithms, one with redundant drives and the other without, were used in this experiment. The result of this experiment has shown that use of redundant drives greatly improves the repeatability...|$|R

40|$|To {{increase}} {{reliability and}} efficiency, standard aircraft components are being replaced with more electric subsystems aimed to reduce weight, conserve space, and improve energy management. One {{application of this}} process replaces standard hydraulic actuators used in flap or aileron movements with electromechanical actuators powered by an external generator. During different types of return movements, the electromechanical actuator will produce regenerative power that flows back through the generator and pulses into the engine-gearbox subsystem. The regenerative power, defined by characteristic amplitude, frequency, and other pulse attributes, coupled with the driving force produced by the engine may dramatically impact the performance and life of the gearbox. Steady state and transient subsystem models have been developed in the MATLAB/Simulink® environment to simulate gearbox behavior subject to incurred engine loads, regenerative power loads, and other dynamic phenomena such as backlash present in the gear interactions. Employing a lumped inertia approach, derived equations of motion incorporate damping and stiffness parameters pertaining to bearings, shafts, and gear mesh interactions. Particularly sensitive {{to the amount of}} damping acting at the gear mesh, the contact force and inter-gear dynamics are modeled by three separate methods of contact force calculation. The models and development process utilized in this study can be used as practical gearbox design and scaling tools for other gearbox systems. Application of regenerative energy causes instantaneous oscillations of the angular velocity and transient torque profiles of the gearbox components and connecting shafts. Several shafts experience high stress fluctuations and absolute reversal of rotation that possibly act as sources leading to accelerated fatigue failure. Depending on the applied method of contact force calculation, instances <b>of</b> <b>gear</b> <b>backlash</b> at engine start-up conditions are experienced.

40|$|A {{development}} {{platform for}} low-frequency magnetic testing techniques, which allows {{a reduction of}} development efforts and costs from prototyping to final solution, has been designed. The specification states the requirements for the development platform. To determine the application capability for flux leakage inspections, different sensors have been evaluated and GMR and Hall sensors have been selected as fundamental magnetic flux sensors. The principle differences between magnetic particle testing and sensor-based flux leakage technique have been identified and a comparison between the different techniques, including their limitations has been provided. When conventional magnetic particle methods are applied, a complete, 100 % coverage of the test area can often not be achieved, for example gear tooth systems. Magnetic particle <b>inspection</b> <b>of</b> <b>gear</b> tooth systems is generally possible but in certain cases leads to the accumulation of the test fluids (wet bath) in the root <b>of</b> the <b>gear</b> tooth {{in such a way}} that it masks potential flaw (crack) indications. Under these circumstances, automated magnetic particle inspection systems and conventional manual magnetic particle inspection personal are often overburdened, due to the poor visibility (contrast) of the flaw indication. This thesis has demonstrated that the sensor-based magnetic flux leakage technique is applicable for the detection of heat-treatment cracking in gear tooth system parts and components. The sensitivity of the sensor-based magnetic flux leakage technique has been determined experimentally, applying the development platform, as well as numerically. A mathematical interrelation for the computation of detection limits for crack indications relative to crack depth and sensor lift-off was established. To satisfy increasing inspection speeds, required by manufacturing, different scanning techniques have been developed and were implemented into practical applications. Different nondestructive inspection systems have been designed by implementing this development platform.

Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers. Part K, Journal of Multi-body Dynamics, 231 (3), pp. 504 - 518. Copyright © 2017 Institution of Mechanical Engineers. Reprinted by permission of SAGE Publications. A planetary gearbox model comprising five spur gears (sun, ring and three planets) and the carrier has been developed and analysed. The influence <b>of</b> <b>gear</b> teeth <b>backlash</b> and friction during mixed regime of lubrication has been taken into consideration. Greenwood and Tripp model is employed, while viscous friction is calculated analytically using the functions of Evans and Johnson. A combined tribodynamics modeling approach has been implemented and modal analysis is performed in order to predict the coupled mechanism of tribological and dynamic behavior, subjected to backlash and excited at the gear meshing frequency. The software used for the simulations is ADAMS MSc (Student Edition), where the model variables (concerning gear geometry and forcing functions) have been added in a parametric way. The results showed that small variations of the dynamic transmission error affect notably the viscous friction through changing the contact load between the engaged teeth pairs. Also, higher values of the Stribeck oil parameter due to higher film thickness or lower surface roughness in the mixed lubrication regime lead to reduction of the boundary friction, whereas a reduction of the total generated friction occurs when increasing the angular velocity <b>of</b> the input <b>gear</b> body (due to higher film thickness and smaller asperity interactions).
