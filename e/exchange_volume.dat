50|$|Avian {{hearts are}} {{generally}} larger than mammalian hearts {{when compared to}} body mass. This adaptation allows more blood to be pumped to meet the high metabolic need associated with flight. Birds, like the flamingo, have a very efficient system for diffusing oxygen into the blood; birds have a ten times greater surface area to gas <b>exchange</b> <b>volume</b> than mammals. As a result, birds have more blood in their capillaries per unit of volume of lung than a mammal. The American flamingo's four-chambered heart is myogenic, meaning that all the muscle cells and fibers {{have the ability to}} contract rhythmically. The rhythm of contraction is controlled by the pace maker cells which have a lower threshold for depolarization. The wave of electrical depolarization initiated here is what physically starts the heart's contractions and begins pumping blood. Pumping blood creates variations in blood pressure and as a result, creates different thicknesses of blood vessels. The Law of LaPlace can be used to explain why arteries are relatively thick and veins are thin.|$|E

Special emphasis is directed in reference to behavior pat terns in these indicators before fluctuations in the Dow-Jones Industrial Average of 5 % or greater. The writings of experts in the field of the clinical analysis are examined to determine what to expect in the behavior patterns of these indicators and it is determined that many of their "rules of use" are insufficient when working on the shorter term basis. This results in the establishment of five and eleven week trends in each indicator and these are examined before each 5 % fluctuation in the Dow for the period, 1960 - 1967. The forecasting ability of the trend line of each indicator is noted by comparing their successes before these fluctuations in the Dow and they are ranked accordingly.

40|$|The {{article is}} focused on the issue of trade {{exchange}} between European Union member states. The trade <b>exchange</b> <b>volume</b> noted an increase after the new members had joined the European Union. That may be observed while analysing statistical data on the trade <b>exchange</b> <b>volume</b> in speci fi c states {{as well as in the}} whole of the European Union. A simple index analysis of the trade volume enables researchers to observe changes over time; however, it neglects the causes of these changes. With a view to identifying theses causes, an econometric tool – the panel gravity model – was used for the purposes of the present paper. The research objective of the paper is to evaluate the impact of selected factors on the development of bilateral trade in the European Union in the years 1999 – 2010. The group of potential factors describing the size of trade exchange includes the following: the Gross Domestic Product per capita, foreign direct investment per capita and the geographical distance between trading partners. The research outcome enabled us to draw a conclusion on a positive dependence between a member state’s GDP and its export and import volume.

The {{aim of this}} study was to compare two different on-line, post-dilution hemodiafiltration (HDF) treatments with regard to achieved convective volume and middle-molecule dialysis efficiency: standard volume control (sOL-HDF) and automated control of the transmembrane pressure (TMP) (UC-HDF). Methods: We enrolled 30 ESRD patients (55. 9 +/- 14. 0 years, 20 / 10 M/F) in a randomized, prospective, crossover study The patients received a 3 -month period of sOL-HDF followed by UC-HDF for a further 3 months, or vice versa, using the same dialysis machine. In sOL-HDF, fixed <b>exchange</b> <b>volumes</b> were set according to a filtration fraction greater than or equal to 25 %. In UC-HDF therapy, the <b>exchanged</b> <b>volume</b> was driven by a biofeedback system controlling the TMP and its set point in a double loop.

Results: Greater convective volumes were achieved in UC-HDF than in sOL-HDF (23. 8 +/- 3. 9 vs. 19. 8 +/- 4. 8 L; p< 0. 001) with high pre-dialysis Ht value (sOL-HDF 34. 0 +/- 4. 5 % and UC-HDF 34. 0 +/- 4. 4 %; p = 0. 91).
