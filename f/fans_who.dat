The club states that its worldwide fan base includes more than 200officially recognised Club of the LFC Official Supporters Clubs in at least 50 countries. Notable groups include Spirit of Shankly and Reclaim The Kop. The club takes advantage of this support through its worldwide summer tours. Liverpool fans often refer to themselves as Kopites, a reference to the <b>fans</b> <b>who</b> once stood, and now sit, on the Kop at Anfield. In 2008 a group of fans decided to form a splinter club, A.F.C. Liverpool, to play matches for <b>fans</b> <b>who</b> had been priced out of watching Premier League football.|$|E

5|$|An Australian version {{titled the}} Adult Swim Meat Tray Collection was {{released}} on November 28, 2012; a Region 2 version of Adult Swim in a Box had been released a year earlier. Critical reception for Adult Swim in a Box was mixed, with some reviewers confused as to the selection of content or recommending <b>fans</b> <b>who</b> have already purchased the shows on the set passing it on.|$|E
5|$|As he {{was escorted}} {{to the locker}} room, Blount confronted Boise State <b>fans</b> <b>who</b> were jeering at him after seeing the video replay. Blount says that one Boise State fan brandished a chair at him and another punched him. Two police {{officers}} and Oregon assistant coach Scott Frost restrained Blount and escorted him into the locker room. Video of the incident spread rapidly on the Internet.|$|E
50|$|Even more {{remarkable}} than the game's length, perhaps, {{is the fact}} that the <b>fan</b> <b>who</b> caught Chris Burke's walk-off homer in the eighteenth was the same <b>fan</b> <b>who</b> had caught Lance Berkman's grand slam in the eighth (Section 102, Row 2, Seat 15); the fan later donated both balls to the Baseball Hall of Fame.|$|R

5|$|As late as December 31, neither {{team had}} sold its entire {{allotment}} of 17,500 tickets. Cincinnati fans had bought 13,000 tickets, while Virginia Tech fans bought fewer than 5,000 tickets from the school's allotment. Countering Virginia Tech's low direct ticket sales were {{large numbers of}} <b>fans</b> <b>who</b> avoided paying face value for tickets—US$125—by buying them on the secondary market, often {{for as little as}} 99 cents.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{winning the}} Jack Adams Award as top coach and being {{popular with the}} Sabres fanbase, Nolan was only offered a one-year {{contract}} extension by replacement GM Darcy Regier. He rejected this under {{the grounds that it}} was too short, and decided to part ways with the franchise. This upset many <b>fans,</b> <b>who</b> blamed Nolan's departure on Hašek's alleged attempt to rid him.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the closure}} of the weekly title in 1993, the strip {{appeared}} in a relaunched monthly publication in September that year, with grittier storylines intended to attract teen and young adult <b>fans</b> <b>who</b> had read the weekly comic in their youth. Between January 1994 and January 1995, the monthly strips were mirrored by a weekly edition in Shoot magazine, which had in the late 1980s published a parody called Ray of the Rangers.|$|E

5|$|Hermética {{remained}} a popular {{band in the}} Argentine heavy metal scene, even among the younger <b>fans</b> <b>who</b> {{had never seen the}} band live. Since their disbandment, the band's members have not attempted any reunion.

5|$|The Notre Dame Fighting Irish {{provide much}} of the sports action for the South Bend locale. Football Saturdays have become a major event for the city, {{attracting}} <b>fans</b> <b>who</b> come to watch the game and have tailgate parties. Notre Dame basketball games are also popular, along with other university sports. The College Football Hall of Fame was moved from Kings Mills, Ohio, to downtown South Bend in 1995, though the Hall of Fame relocated to Atlanta, Georgia in 2014.|$|E

5000|$|Fans of {{professional}} wrestling {{can be divided}} into two groups: marks and smarks. Derived from the same term for the prey of conmen, a mark is a <b>fan</b> <b>who</b> believes that everything associated with professional wrestling is real. In contrast, a [...] "smark" [...] is a <b>fan</b> <b>who</b> recognizes that they are witnessing a stage-managed work ("kayfabe"), but appreciates it nonetheless, including its backstage aspects.|$|R
5|$|The Red Sox's defeat {{disappointed}} Boston <b>fans,</b> <b>who</b> {{had been}} rooting {{the entire season}} for an All-Boston World Series. Prior to the October 4 game, the oddsmakers gave the Red Sox the advantage, meaning that an all-Boston World Series was likely. The Red Sox did not make another playoff appearance until 1967, when the St. Louis Cardinals defeated them in the 1967 World Series.|$|E
5|$|The {{attendance}} at the event was 19,121. In addition, the event was seen by over one million viewers through closed-circuit television, making it the largest event on closed-circuit television in the United States at the time. A technical glitch ended the closed circuit broadcast early into the showing at the Civic Arena in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. To appease angry <b>fans</b> <b>who</b> pelted the screen with garbage, WrestleMania was broadcast in its entirety on local ABC affiliate WTAE-TV two weeks later.|$|E
5|$|The {{attendance}} for {{the event}} was 6,500 <b>fans,</b> <b>who</b> paid a total of $80,000 in admission. This is the lowest attendance figure for a King of the Ring event.

The PPV buyrate was 1.1, which was the highest buyrate in King of the Ring history until the 1999 event.|$|E

5|$|The {{compilation}} received generally {{mixed reviews}} from music critics; {{the album was}} recommended for <b>fans</b> <b>who</b> were awaiting the release of Rihanna's next studio album. Good Girl Gone Bad: The Remixes peaked at number 106 on the Billboard 200 and number four on the Dance/Electronic Albums chart. It was ranked as the 22nd best-selling album of 2009 on the latter chart, and it has sold 49,000 copies in the US to date.|$|E
5|$|The {{event was}} {{attended}} by 16,891 <b>fans,</b> <b>who</b> paid a total of $1,100,000 in admission fees. This represents less {{than one-third of the}} number of fans at WrestleMania VIII, which had an attendance of 62,167. The pay-per-view drew a 2.3 buyrate, which was lower than the previous year's 2.8 buyrate. It was higher, however, than the buyrates for any of the following four WrestleManias.|$|E
5|$|Tickets for {{the match}} had been selling for £500 {{in the lead}} up to the game.
