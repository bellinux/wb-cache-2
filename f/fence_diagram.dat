40|$|In 2011, the British Geological Survey (BGS) {{decided to}} begin the {{assembly}} of a National Geological Model (NGM) from its existing and on-going geological framework models comprising integrated national crustal, bedrock, and Quaternary models. The bedrock component is the most advanced of these themes and comprises both the calculated models and a complementary network of cross sections that provide a <b>fence</b> <b>diagram</b> for the bedrock geology of Great Britain. This <b>fence</b> <b>diagram,</b> the GB 3 D_v 2012 dataset, {{is the subject of}} this article and is available in a variety of formats from the BGS website (www. bgs. ac. uk) as free downloads. It complements the existing 1 : 625 000 scale map sheets published by BGS utilizing the same colour schema and geological classification. The 121 component cross sections extend to depths between 1. 5 and 6 km; they have an aggregate length of over 20 000 km, and they are snapped together at their intersections to ensure total consistency. The sections are guided by the existing BGS geological framework models where they cut through them; they also take account of the vast wealth of published data on the subsurface structure of Britain both from BGS and in the literature. Much of this is in the form of cross sections, contour maps of surfaces, and thicknesses (isopachs). The <b>fence</b> <b>diagram</b> has been built in the Geological Surveying and Investigation in 3 D (GSI 3 D) software. Utilizing the cross sections and the coverages of the geological units simple 3 D volumes can be calculated for the less deformed sedimentary strata.

30|$|To {{represent}} spatial {{objects in}} three-dimensional space, the related three-dimensional model or data structures have been investigated, such as grid system, linear octree, <b>fence</b> <b>diagram,</b> and tetrahedron network (TEN) (Pilout et al. 1994; Chen et al. 1995; Houlding 1994; Martinez et al. 2017). There are many varieties of geological models generated from different modeling methods and geologists (Soubeyrand 2017; Mery et al. 2017). Geological modeling often refers to raster-based or vector -based models, {{both of which}} have its own features and applicability. The description of 3 D objects is aimed at skeleton modeling, surface modeling, inner modeling, and property modeling, and thus geological data need to be considered as much as possible (González-Garcia and Jessell 2016), including cores, outcrops, logs, seismic data, test data, boreholes, maps, and so on (Bourdeau et al. 2017). Meanwhile, <b>fence</b> <b>diagram</b> and profiles which can represent the inner structure of a geological body are the two issues of crucial importance (Lemon and Jones 2003; Turner and Gable 2003), as this allows a geologist to understand the geological interior structure and optimize development schema accordingly.

40|$|This {{report is}} {{available}} for download on the BGS UK 3 D web page to allow the reader {{to better understand the}} context and development of UK 3 D, a national network, or ‘fence diagram model’, of bedrock geology cross-sections. It also explains the development of the metadata underpinning the model and therefore supports use and understanding of UK 3 D. The pre-existing BGS GB 3 D model provided the only nationally consistent representation of the bedrock geology of Great Britain to depths of at least 1 km. The latest version of this model was released in 2014 as the GB 3 D_v 2014 and accompanying report (Mathers et al. 2014 b). However, the existing GB 3 D_v 2014 model lacked equivalent scale presentation of a <b>fence</b> <b>diagram</b> model for Northern Ireland. It was recognised that in order to provide comparable geological information across the United Kingdom it was necessary to upgrade the model to a UK 3 D <b>fence</b> <b>diagram</b> model incorporating Northern Ireland, with rigorous peer review performed to enable an enhanced dataset. The objective of this study was therefore to further develop the GB 3 D model, outlined by Mathers et al. (2014 a and b), into a UK 3 D model by the incorporation of 36 deep boreholes and a framework of 15 cross-sections for Northern Ireland. The appropriate applications for the revised model are for geoscience communication and education to illustrate the national and regional bedrock geology of the United Kingdom to a depth of at least 1 km with an intended resolution of use in the 1 : 250 000 to 1 : 1 million scale range. Limitations inherent in the model preclude such applications as detailed geological assessments, resource-reserve estimation and exploration, and any representation or use outside the intended resolution range. The new model produced by this study UK 3 D_v 2015 supersedes the earlier 2014 version for England and Wales, for which areas of the fence diagrams remain the same. The Scottish portion of the model remains unchanged from the earlier 2012 version. The new dataset is a wholly owned BGS product and as with its forerunners it is freely available from the BGS website [URL] as downloads in a variety of formats. ...|$|E

Geologists interpret their sections based partly on factual information where the borehole information and correlation is secure and partly on geological experience-the shape ’looks right’. This ’looks right‘ element pulls on the modellers ' wealth of understanding of geological processes and knowledge gathered over a career in geology. For example, something observed in sediments at the margin of a glacier in Iceland might well influence the way a geologist draws the base of a till unit on a geological section in Scotland.

The model was not intended to be a structural geological representation; rather, a lithostratigraphic visualisation 'normalised' to an arbitrary horizon related to the (near) time-plane represented by the A. vanderbeckei Marine Band. This is a common concept in 2 -D stratigraphic crosssections and <b>fence</b> <b>diagrams,</b> but an unusual application for the Vulcan 3 -D modelling software. Once complete, the model would allow fully interactive rotation, visualisation and dynamic cross-sectional slicing in any orientation. The Vulcan model was developed in three versions from interpretations of borehole geophysical logs. Initially 8 boreholes were used, but as digitised geophysical logs from additional boreholes became available, successive Vulcan models were developed using 13, and finally, 26 boreholes.

40|$|Saltwater {{intrusion}} {{is generally}} related to seawater-level rise or induced intrusion due to excessive groundwater extraction in coastal aquifers. However, the hydrogeological heterogeneity of the subsurface {{plays an important}} role in (non-) intrusion as well. Local hydrogeological conditions for recharge and saltwater intrusion are studied in a coastal groundwater system in Vietnam where geological formations exhibit highly heterogeneous lithologies. A three-dimensional (3 D) hydrostratigraphical solid model of the study area is constructed by way of a recursive classification procedure. The procedure includes a cluster analysis which uses as parameters geological formation, lithological composition, distribution depth and thickness of each lithologically distinctive drilling interval of 47 boreholes, to distinguish and map well-log intervals of similar lithological properties in different geological formations. A 3 D hydrostratigraphical <b>fence</b> <b>diagram</b> is then generated from the constructed solid model and is used as a tool to evaluate recharge paths and saltwater intrusion to the groundwater system.

40|$|Background The {{original}} {{objective of}} this work was to a ssemble a 1 : 50 000 (50 k) resolution 3 D Geological Framework Model for an area south of Ammanfor d. The model was to have two main purposes: 1. To {{form the basis for}} a communication tool to present the 3 D geological understanding of the area to a range of stakeholders; and 2. To support the reinterpretation of th e geological succession mapped at surface. This study specifically excludes the further development of th e Framework Model to include hydrogeology, hydrochemistry or rock mechanics and does not include any consideration of potentially suitable resources such as Coal Bed Methane. This report provides the explanation of the me thodology and how this model was generated. Additional outputs of the study include: 1. An ArcGIS project containing the da ta used to compile the model; and 2. Surface observations of the geology collected foll owing Sigma workflows, held in a GIS. Development of a 3 D geological framework model A 1 : 50 000 resolution 3 D geological framework model was successfully constructed for the study area using the Geological Surveying and Investigation in 3 D (GSI 3 D) software package, developed partly in house at BGS, which can be used readily by geologists to construct a series of cross-sections that can more clearly display the geological succession. Models of this type have the potential to be accessible to members of the public and used by geologists to assess the potential location of resources, not evident from traditi onal 2 D geological maps. The approach followed was to construct a <b>fence</b> <b>diagram</b> of 12 cross-sections using GSI 3 D.

40|$|The Campania Volcanic Zone (CVZ), {{located on}} the eastern margin of the Tyrrhenian Sea, is a region {{characterized}} by active tectonics and large ignimbrite eruptions starting from 290 ka. A reconstruction of the three-dimensional architecture of the ignimbrite deposits and faults of the CVZ (Campania Plain and Bay of Naples) was made {{by means of the}} interpretation of an integrated geological geophysical database. This reconstruction, based on several geological sections combined into two <b>fence</b> <b>diagrams</b> and isopach maps showing the distribution of ignimbrites, reveals: (i) a regional fault pattern characterized by NE-SW, NNE-SSW, NW-SE and E-W structures active over the last 290 ka during ignimbrite eruptions; (ii) a location of the ignimbrite vents over the whole CVZ in correspondence to NE-SW and NW-SE faults; (iii) volcano-tectonic subsidence along normal separation faults that produced asymmetric basins. Furthermore, we have established the tectonic evolution of the CVZ from the emplacement of the ignimbrite deposits, and infer the presence of a WNW-ESE trending extension associated with NNE-SSW normal faults, E-W transfer faults and the reactivation, as transtensional faults, of the NE-SW and the NW-SE structures.

40|$|Six major {{generations of}} {{dolomite}} are present within the Cambrian Langston Formation in the Wellsville Mountains and Bear River Range of northern Utah. Identification of dolomite generations and delineation of their relative sequences {{are based on}} normal light petrography, cathodoluminescence, staining, chemistry, inferred burial history, and deformation features. The earliest stage {{is believed to be}} Middle to Late Cambrian in age. The presence of dolomite rhombs and dolomitized echinoid fragments and peloids suggests that this stage probably formed under sabkha reflux conditions. Extensive nonferroan, polymodal, nonplanar (2 ̆ 2 xenotopic 2 ̆ 2) dolomite formed next under confined mixing zone conditions. A succeeding generation of pervasive ferroan, polymodal, nonplanar dolomite formed upon exposure to evolved confined mixing zone waters or fluids derived from basin compaction. Subsequent neomorphism of these two nonplanar stages to nonferroan and ferroan saddle dolomites occurred with increased burial. The final stage of dolomitization is confined to dolomite-filled veins and an orthodolospar probably fanned from fluids associated with Tertiary Basin and Range faulting. Thus, there are at least six major types of dolomite within the Langston Formation. Spatial distribution and intensity of the early-formed dolomite facies, as revealed by <b>fence</b> <b>diagrams,</b> are postulated to be functions of changes in permeability, hydrodynamic dispersion, water chemistry, and concomitant variations in length of the induction ix stages...|$|R
40|$|In {{its role}} as a {{national}} geological survey the British Geological Survey (BGS) has produced paper maps of Britain’s geology at a series of scales for the past 170 years. Geological maps often require another geologist to understand them fully; the surveyors’ spatial ideas, models and concepts can never be properly represented in a 2 D map output, and so, to-date, much knowledge has been lost to the science and to the users. In 1815 William Smith was already addressing the need to present the third dimension of the geology as well as the surface arrangement of units. Over time, cross-section drawing became more refined, resulting in outputs such as <b>fence</b> <b>diagrams,</b> ribbon diagrams and block diagrams to reveal the 3 D structure, while contoured surfaces were used to show the spatial position of individual horizons such as major unconformities or the thickness variations of units or sequences (isopach maps) BGS has recently captured and published national coverage of geological map data as 2 -D digital maps of Britain (DiGMapGB) at 1 : 50, 000 scale.

Zones Two and Three are delineated according to analytical or numerical techniques, {{which are based on}} hydrogeological and time-of-travel data, as well as recharge information, accumulated through the use of hydrogeologic and hydrochemical techniques. The primary conclusions of this research are: 1) A <b>fence</b> <b>diagram</b> and site hydrostratigraphic diagram show that the hydrogeology is more complex than previously has been thought. The principal aquifer at the target well site comprises a sequence of mostly coarse-grained units interspersed with thinner fine-grained units. The supposedly unconfined shallow aquifer is confined {{in most parts of the}} valley, including the target well site. 2) The recovery rate of water levels in the monitor wells in response to pumping of the target well indicates that horizontal groundwater flow velocities are low at the target well site. X 3) Interpretation of major ions relative to the depth of uppermost open interval of the various sample wells indicates that the deeper of the three major water-bearing zones (below 300 to 350 feet [91 to 107 meters]) is not well connected to the upper two zones. 4) The chemical evolution of the water along the westernmost of three discrete flowpaths indicates a change from young calcium bicarbonate water to moderately mature sodium-sulfate water. 5) Sample waters recharged from the northern Wasatch Mountains have higher total-dissolved-solids (TDS) contents then sample waters recharged from the southern Wasatch Mountains. 6) The discrepancy between many of the δ 18 O, δD, and tritium data as to the probable recharge area(s) indicate that the sample wells must be evaluated on an individual basis regarding the source of recharge water. 7) The tritium data demonstrate that those wells located farthest out into the valley or having the deepest uppermost open interval furnish the lowest tritium values. 8) Based on the 14 C dating technique, the groundwater at the target well site appears to be between 1300 and 5300 years old. 9) There is little risk of contamination at the target well site, in terns of the 15 -year time-of-travel DWSP zone (Zone 3) ...|$|E
40|$|Research {{in the top}} few metres of {{the ground}} beneath our feet has {{traditionally}} been split between soil science, geology and several sub-disciplines. This has lead to different working practices, classifications and boundaries as well as inconsistent approaches to databasing and modelling. A significant uncertainty lies within the “transition zone” between the pedosphere and geosphere. The British Geological Survey (BGS) set out to investigate this zone through multidisciplinary field surveys at both a site specific and catchment scale in representative soil-geoscapes across the UK. The spatial 3 D soil-geology model is developed by the combination of spatial soil and geoscientific findings. Whilst undertaking these studies the BGS were particularly interested in investigating whether technologies developed to map geology in 3 D {{can be used to}} routinely develop spatial models of the soil-geology environment, and if technologies used in digital soil mapping can assist in reducing uncertainties associated with such models at a variety of scales. The presented soil-geology model is an example of recent work carried out on an area of approximately 2 km 2 near Shelford, Nottinghamshire, UK. The site lies on the River Trent floodplain and an adjacent gentle slope of Triassic mudstone. The whole site is underlain by typical red mudstones of the Triassic Mercia Mudstone Group with some interbedded greenish grey siltstones and sandstones. This is overlain by up to 5 m of Pleistocene and Holocene river terrace deposits, varying from sand to coarse gravels and Holocene alluvial and colluvial deposits. Fieldwork was orientated along several parallel traverses running from the hilltop, downslope towards the River Trent. The study of the survey area comprised of two main stages. Firstly a field survey which included techniques such as a detailed soil and geological survey, pitting and drilling, installation of piezometres, soil moisture tests, high-resolution electrical mapping, electrical resistivity tomography, ground penetrating radar, magnetic susceptibility, gamma spectrometry, remote sensing and terrain analysis. The second stage involved the digital assembly of data, processing, and the development of the 3 D soil-geology model. Each survey delivered its own results in form of maps, tables and property models which were collated into one software package (GSI 3 D by INSIGHT GmbH). Developing a solid 3 D soil-geology model in GSI 3 D utilizes a Digital Terrain Model, mapped geological and soil line work, downhole borehole and augerhole data, and geophysical data. This enables the geoscientist to construct regularly spaced intersecting cross-sections by correlating boreholes and the outcrops-subcrops of units to produce a <b>fence</b> <b>diagram</b> of the area. Mathematical interpolation between the nodes along the sections and the limits of the units or horizons produces a solid model comprising of a series of stacked triangulated volume objects. The final 3 D model shows several top- and subsoil horizons in conjunction with the underlying Holocene, Pleistocene and red Triassic Mercia Mudstone parent materials. These models can aid studies of near surface processes including the movement of water, dissolved agricultural nutrients and associated eroded soil particles...|$|E

40|$|Pebbly fluvio-deltaic {{sandstones}} of the Brimham Grit (Kinderscoutian, northern England) form {{a complex}} array of Millstone Grit tor outcrops, which enable 3 -D lithofacies architecture {{to be determined}} in detail whereby relationships between adjacent sand-bodies representing a range of channel, barform, dune and sheet-like elements {{can be used to}} reconstruct the flow behavior of a braided channel network. Although the depositional paleoenvironment was supplied with sediment delivered from a range of provenances, the dominant supply was from eroded remnants of Scottish and Norwegian Caledonian Mountains located ~ 450 and ~ 950 km towards the north and northeast, respectively. Previous studies suggest that the system evolved from a shelf-edge- to slope-ramp delta, which ultimately delivered sediment to a series of submarine fans developing in the deep-water depocenter of the Craven Basin. A detailed depositional model depicting the fluvial processes responsible for generating the preserved stratigraphic architecture has been developed through high-resolution architectural analysis utilizing 1 D sedimentary logs, 2 -D architectural panels, pseudo- 3 -D <b>fence</b> <b>diagrams</b> and paleocurrent rose diagrams. Sedimentary lithofacies include trough- and planar cross-bedded sets, compound co-sets of cross-strata, planarbedded sandstones and gravel beds, collectively organized to define a variety of architectural elements including single-story, multilateral- and multi-story channel elements, downstream- and laterally-accreting macroforms. Architectural elements are typified internally by distinctive lithofacies arrangements with highly variable paleocurrent distributions that are indicative of barforms that systematically changed from lateral to downstream accretion, with accumulation occurring in a poorly-confined network of fluvial channels allied with major sandy barforms, indicative of a frequently avulsing braided fluvial system in an upper-delta plain setting. The presence of plant fossils (e. g. calamites stem remnants) implies local swamp-like conditions adjacent to active channel belts and a degree of channel-bank stability. Data from this study are contributing to a broader research program investigating the linkage of fluvio-deltaic successions from shelf-edge deltas to slope and submarine-fan successions, with a focus on the influence of basin morphology on sediment delivery mechanisms in the Craven, South Pennine and North Staffordshire Basins of the UK...|$|R

40|$|The British Geological Survey (BGS) is {{undertaking}} {{a holistic}} multi-disciplinary {{study of a}} small upland catchment near Talla Linnfoots in the Southern Uplands, Scotland. The site, which covers about 3. 5 km 2, {{is located on the}} interfluve between two major public water supply reservoirs northeast of Moffat. One of the aims is to develop an integrated 3 -dimensional (3 D) earth model of the site, which will lead to understanding landscape evolution within the catchment, in response to environmental changes during the past 12. 000 years. Geologically, the Talla catchment is dominated by glacial and periglacial deposits overlying resistant Ordovician greywacke bedrock. The valley fill comprises undulating moraines and blanket peat bogs, as well as narrow spreads of alluvium along Talla Water and its headwater tributaries. The lower valley sides are covered with thin colluvium mantling glacial till deposits; steeper rock slopes are mantled in scree. The study consisted of three phases. The first comprised geological, geomorphological and soil surveys. These were followed by multidisciplinary site investigation of the shallow subsurface using several geophysical, geotechnical and intrusive techniques. This was followed by interpretation of the results and development of an attributed 3 D geological model. Characterising the ground was achieved using traditional site investigation methods such as geological and soil surveying, trial pitting and borehole drilling, as well as light-weight penetrometer traverses. This was combined with an array of shallow geophysical techniques, including Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) and Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT). These were applied on traverses between boreholes and pits, to gain additional continuous information on lateral extent and thickness of the geology to rockhead and provided a rapid, accurate representation of the shallow subsurface structure, where intrusive data was sparse. The catchment 3 D geological model was constructed using “Geological Surveying and Investigation in 3 D” (GSI 3 DTM) software. This utilizes a high resolution (1 m cell size) Digital Terrain Model (DTM), created by terrestrial LiDAR survey, linked with mapped geology, borehole, auger hole and geophysical data, to form slices and sections. This approach enabled the geoscientists to construct regularly spaced intersecting cross-sections by correlating boreholes and the outcrops-subcrops of geological units to produce <b>fence</b> <b>diagrams</b> of the area. These can then be variably attributed eg by sediment type, chemical composition, geotechnical properties and permeability etc. Mathematical interpolation between the nodes along the sections and the limits of the units produces a solid model comprising a series of stacked triangulated volume objects. Geophysical sections were used as an additional data source, which enabled the interpretation of measurements in their true 3 D positions and improved the accuracy of the model along these traverses. On-going studies at Talla include monitoring of shallow groundwater heads and water chemistry in instrumented shallow boreholes. The eventual aim is to establish a linked model of shallow-groundwater movement and surface drainage through time. Adoption of this type of novel 3 D geospatial modelling approach allows geoscientists to visualise, explore and interrogate the landscape evolution of small catchments, such as Talla in three dimensions. It can form an unrivalled template for catchment monitoring. ...|$|R
