25|$|Rhodizonic {{acid and}} the rhodizonate anion can lose {{one of the}} CO units to yield croconic acid (CO)3(COH)2 and the croconate anion C5O52, respectively, by {{mechanisms}} that are still imperfectly known. In basic solutions (pH > 10), rhodizonic acid quickly converts to the THBQ anion (CO)64 {{in the absence of}} oxygen, and to croconic acid <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>presence.</b> At pH 8.3 and exposure to light, solutions are stable for days in the absence of oxygen, and decompose to croconic acid and other products (possibly including cyclohexanehexone or dodecahydroxycyclohexane) <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>presence.</b>|$|E

25|$|Presence {{or absence}} of {{functional}} sex-lethal proteins now go on to affect the transcription of another protein known as doublesex. In the absence of sex-lethal, doublesex will have the fourth exon removed and be translated {{up to and including}} exon 6 (DSX-M), while <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>presence</b> the fourth exon which encodes a stop codon will produce a truncated version of the protein (DSX-F). DSX-F causes transcription of Yolk proteins 1 and 2 in somatic cells, which will be pumped into the oocyte on its production.|$|E
25|$|Another {{possible}} modification is {{to insert}} a methylene between hydroxyl and lactone on the E-ring yielding a seven membered β-hydroxylactone group, so-called homocamptothecin (hCPT). The hCPT’s hydroxyl has less inductive {{effect on the}} carboxyl group which makes the lactone very reactive. This enhances {{the interaction of the}} free hydroxyl group optimally with topo I and the covalent complex that forms <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>presence</b> are more stable. The E-ring of hCPT opens more slowly and the opening is irreversible. hCPTs exhibit enhanced human plasma stability because of decreased protein binding and more affinity for red blood cells than CPT.|$|E
25|$|In the legend, Afonso Henriques is visited {{before the}} battle {{by an old}} man who saw in a dream that Henriques would be victorious because God would {{intervene}} in his favour.

Riding off he was surprised by a ray of light that showed him (in one interpretation) {{the sign of the cross}} and Jesus Christ on a crucifix.

2500|$|The Ich-Es ("I‑It") {{relationship}} is nearly {{the opposite of}} Ich‑Du. Whereas in Ich‑Du the two beings encounter one another, in an Ich‑Es relationship the beings do not actually meet. Instead, the [...] "I" [...] confronts and qualifies an idea, or conceptualization, of the being <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>presence</b> and treats that being as an object. All such objects are considered merely mental representations, created and sustained by the individual mind. This is based partly on Kant's theory of phenomenon, in that these objects reside in the cognitive agent’s mind, existing only as thoughts. Therefore, the Ich‑Es {{relationship is}} in fact a relationship with oneself; it is not a dialogue, but a monologue.|$|E
2500|$|Although he {{does not}} want to kill the {{elephant}} now that it seems peaceful, the narrator feels pressured by the demand of the crowd for the act to be carried out. After inquiring as to the elephant's behavior and delaying for some time, he shoots the elephant several times, wounding it but unable to kill it. The narrator then leaves the beast, unable to be <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>presence</b> as it continues to suffer. He later learns that it was stripped, nearly to the bone, within hours. His elderly colleagues agree that killing the elephant was the best thing to do, but the younger ones believe that it was worth more than the Indian it killed. The narrator then wonders if they will ever understand that he did it [...] "solely to avoid looking a fool." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Ainu revered {{the wolf}} as the deity Horkew Kamuy ("howling god"), in {{recognition}} of the animal's similar hunting habits. Wolves were sacrificed in [...] "sending-away" [...] iomante ceremonies, and some Ainu communities, such as those in Tokachi and Hidaka, held origin myths linking the birth of the Ainu to a coupling between a white wolf and a goddess. Ainu hunters would leave portions of their kills for wolves, and it was believed that hunters could share a wolf's kill if they politely cleared their throats <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>presence.</b> Because of the wolf's special status in Ainu culture, hunters were forbidden from killing wolves with poison arrows or firearms, and wasting the pelt and meat of a wolf was thought to provoke wolves into killing the hunter responsible. The Ainu did not differentiate wolves from their domestic dogs, and would strive to reproduce wolf traits in their dogs by allowing dogs in heat to roam freely in wolf-inhabited areas in order to produce hybrid offspring.|$|E

In general, the coral is used as shelter, and many species can only survive <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>presence.</b> The bottom-dwelling species are territorial, occupying and defending {{a portion of the}} reef, often centred around an area of shelter. By keeping away other species of fish, some pomacentrids encourage the growth of thick mats of algae within their territories, leading to the common name farmerfish. Different species display a wide range of colours, although some are relatively drab. Pomacentrids are omnivorous or herbivorous, feeding off algae, plankton, and small bottom-dwelling crustaceans. A small number eat coral.|$|E
