50|$|The twin tunnels are 15 m {{wide with}} 12 cross-passages and <b>emergency</b> <b>walkways,</b> and a portal {{building}} at each end. They were formed by blasting through granite and volcanic rocks.|$|R
25|$|Eight-car AE100 series trains were {{introduced}} in 1990. These trains were designed with emergency exits at each end, {{under the assumption that}} the trains would eventually be used for limited express service between Narita Airport and Haneda Airport: the Toei Asakusa Line has no <b>emergency</b> <b>walkways</b> along its sides, so it was necessary to allow evacuation from the ends of the train. Following the introduction of the AE100s, the seven six-car AE series trains were rearranged to form five eight-car trains. In June 1993, the older AE series trains were withdrawn from service.|$|R
500|$|The tunnel is [...] {{in length}} and {{consists}} of two bores, each carrying one rail line flanked by a maintenance <b>walkway</b> and an <b>emergency</b> evacuation <b>walkway.</b> The two bores are connected every [...] by an interconnecting passage. The tunnel has been built for a maximum speed of — in commercial operation. It will be remotely monitored from the SNCF Réseau command center at Pagny-sur-Moselle.|$|R
50|$|The {{evacuation}} {{system is}} based on an independent stationary Diesel emergency drive that would pull a stranded train back to the station, eliminating the need for an <b>emergency</b> <b>walkway.</b> Trains like these can be also used for different purposes, such as moving trailers and barge loaders.|$|E

5000|$|The {{original}} 1960s-built tunnel was slated as {{of one of}} {{the least}} safe in Europe in 2000, according to a study. Inspectors visited 25 major tunnels around Europe after fire devastated the Mont Blanc Tunnel under the Alps between France and Italy. The Tyne Tunnel was officially rated as [...] "poor" [...] and languished {{near the bottom of the}} European league table. The inspectors found it had no automatic fire alarm system, poor lighting, no laybys or hard shoulder, and an <b>emergency</b> <b>walkway</b> that could be reached only by able-bodied people. They also criticised its smoke extraction system. These deficiencies were addressed during the refurbishment of the original road tunnel in 2011.|$|E
30|$|Mass {{transit systems}} {{must be able}} to attract people away from {{existing}} inefficient modes of transport, providing not only reliable high capacity transportation, but also visually enhancing the community. The key to attracting ridership is the need to provide a transit system with efficient and reliable service through fully automated driverless operation, which not only provides enhanced reliability but also operational flexibility, reduced energy consumption and increased passenger safety. As with any elevated mass transit system, passenger safety must be a key consideration through specified mass transit industry safety standards including specification of <b>emergency</b> evacuation <b>walkway</b> along the entire elevated guideway.|$|R

5000|$|In May 1996, {{construction}} {{began on}} an automated people mover to connect Wellington Station with the Mystic Center (later [...] "Station Landing") office complex and park and ride. Completed in October 1997 {{at a cost}} of $2.9 million, the 760 ft [...] "horizontal elevator" [...] was designed to carry 1,000 commuters a day at speeds up to 25 mph taking about 55 seconds to travel end to end.Constructed by Poma-Otis Transportation Systems, a joint venture of Poma and the Otis Elevator Company, the people mover consisted of a pair of independent cable-hauled cars on two parallel tracks. Unlike other Otis-built people movers, which float on a cushion of air, the Wellington people mover was the first by Otis to run on steel rails. Each eight-seat glass sided car could carry up to 45 passengers or 7200 lb resulting in a maximum capacity of 1,600 people per hour per direction. [...] Riders entered and exited from pairs of sliding doors on the ends of the carriages, with a third door providing access to the <b>emergency</b> <b>walkway</b> between the two tracks.|$|E
30|$|Including {{requirements}} for an <b>emergency</b> <b>walkway</b> {{in the initial}} contract helps avoid contractual disputes with costly budget overruns and compromise solutions that either are marginally effective (walkway not easily accessible from the vehicle) or visually intrusive.|$|E
30|$|As {{with any}} {{elevated}} transit system, a safe {{means of evacuation}} is required to be available at any point along the alignment. Existing standards such as NFPA 130 recommend {{the use of an}} <b>emergency</b> <b>walkway</b> or equally safe means of evacuation; it must also demonstrate a safe evacuate the entire fully loaded train within 15  min. Many independent studies show that the only reliable fail-safe means of evacuation that is able to meet this requirement is an <b>emergency</b> <b>walkway</b> along the entire alignment. All other means of evacuation fail to achieve the required evacuation time in all locations or in all anticipated conditions of failure or hazard.|$|E
30|$|Monorail systems today must employ {{international}} {{mass transit}} standards {{in all aspects}} of vehicle and system design to provide durable and safe operations. As with any elevated transit system, monorail systems are no exception, requiring <b>emergency</b> <b>walkway</b> to provide assured means of evacuation.|$|E
