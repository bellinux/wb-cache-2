40|$|Three {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} investigate the ischiorectal fossa (IRF) as a route for the administration of prostaglandin F 2 α (<b>dinoprost)</b> in cattle. In Experiment 1, 21 nonlactating Holstein cows were given 100 μg of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH), intramuscularly (IM), and, 7 d later, 25 mg of <b>dinoprost</b> into the IRF. Sixteen cows had serum progesterone concentrations ≥ 1. 0 ng/mL {{at the time of}} <b>dinoprost</b> treatment, and all of these had rapid and complete luteolysis; the other 5 cows were not considered to have a functional corpus luteum (CL) at the time of treatment. There were minimal adverse behavioral reactions to the IRF injections and no visible or palpable tissue reactions at the injection site. In Experiment 2, 74 Holstein heifers were given 25 mg of <b>dinoprost</b> by IRF injection. Luteolysis occurred in 84. 3 % of the heifers with a functional CL (as determined by the serum progesterone concentration at the time of treatment). Of the heifers bred by either natural service or artificial insemination, 61. 8 % became pregnant. In Experiment 3, 48 beef heifers received <b>dinoprost</b> 7 d after ovulation, as follows: 25 mg, IM (n = 9); 25 mg, IRF (n = 10); 10 mg, IRF (n = 10); 10 mg, subcutaneously (SC) (n = 10); or 10 mg, intravulvosubmucosally (IVSM) (n = 9). Fewer heifers (P < 0. 05) were found to be in estrus or ovulating in the 10 mg IVSM group (0 % and 11 %, respectively) than in the 25 mg IM group (100 % and 100 %), the 25 mg IRF group (90 % and 100 %, respectively), or the 10 mg IRF group (80 % and 80 %). The rates of estrus (50 %) and ovulation (50 %) were intermediate in the 10 mg SC group. In summary, 25 mg of <b>dinoprost</b> injected into the IRF caused minimal behavioral or tissue response and induced luteolysis and fertile estrus. In addition, 10 mg of <b>dinoprost</b> injected into the IRF was as efficacious as 25 mg given either IM or into the IRF in inducing estrus and ovulation...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe intravulvosubmucosal (IVSM) route {{has been}} used to reduce the dose of {{prostaglandin}} F 2 α (PGF 2 α), a luteolytic agent used in estrus synchronization programs. To validate the effectiveness of PGF 2 α administered via IVSM, the estrus rate was monitored in 1937 beef cows for 5 days (25. 6 % of estrus). The cows that did not show signs of estrus by day 5 received 5 mg of <b>dinoprost</b> IVSM (1 / 5 of the standard dose; n= 1440). By day 10, 68. 2 % of the cows were in estrus. In a second trial, using the same synchronization protocol, the proportion of heifers in estrus after receiving 5 mg <b>dinoprost</b> at day 5 via IVSM (47. 4 %; n= 97) or via an intramuscular injection (IM; 54. 7 %; n= 95) did not differ (P> 0. 05). The occurrence of luteolysis (serum progesterone concentrations below 1 ng/mL) was dependent on the period of the estrous cycle in which the cows were treated with 5 mg of <b>dinoprost</b> via IM or IVSM. Luteolysis was observed in 5 out of 10 cows treated at day 10 but was not observed in any cows treated at day 5 of the estrous cycle. Luteolysis occurred in all animals treated with 25 mg <b>dinoprost</b> independent of the estrous cycle period (day 5 or 10). After IVSM injection, the PGF 2 α concentration did not differ in the uterine and jugular veins. This was further confirmed by measuring the concentration of 13, 14 -dihydro- 15 -keto-PGF 2 α (PGFM) after the injection of 5 mg of <b>dinoprost</b> via the IM or IVSM route. <b>Dinoprost</b> IM and IVSM injections resulted in a similar PGFM serum pattern over time, indicating the same rate of absorption into the systemic circulation. Taking the results together, we concluded that PGF 2 α IVSM injections reached the systemic circulation before reaching the ovary, and the effectiveness of low doses of PGF 2 α was dependent on the period of the estrous cycle and not on the route of administration...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{was to investigate the}} influence of the the day of farrowing induction on the number of newborn piglets (live born and dead born), body mass and mortality of neonatal pigs in litter by the tenth day of age. For the investigation purpose, there were chosen 167 pregnant animals, 34 gilts and 133 sows, divided into 3 groups each, according to the day of pregnancy when prostaglandin analogue, dinoprost-tromethamine, was applied (from 112 th to 114 th day). Fastest- induced parturition was in gilts which were administered <b>dinoprost</b> on the 113 th day of pregnancy, (34, 30 ± 6, 23) h after application, that is, in sows which were administered prostaglandin on the 114 th day of pregnancy, (29, 57 ± 4, 14) h after application of <b>dinoprost.</b> Most gilts (75 %) and sows (90, 91 %) started farrowing 24 - 36 h after <b>dinoprost</b> application, when it was given on the 113 th day of pregnancy. During daily twelve-hour working time (7 - 19 h), 67, 07 % out of all the treated animals started farrowing. When farrowing was induced on the 112 th day of pregnancy, 17 sows (12, 78 %) needed obstetric assistance for dystocia, while 47 (35, 34 %) sows had troublesome farrowing. Along with the delayed induction, body mass of newborn pigs increased, and the largest recorded weight was 1, 27 kg in sows, that is 1, 38 kg in gilts, which were given <b>dinoprost</b> on the 114 th day of pregnancy, with the lowest number of live born pigs of body mass less than 1 kg (23, 76 %). In this experiment there was determined the connection between the body mass and vitality of newborn piglets, so the lowest mortality rate of the pigs by the 10 th day of age was noticed in sows and gilts which were given <b>dinoprost</b> on the 114 th day of pregnancy (11, 05 %), in regard to the pigs born of sows and gilts which were given <b>dinoprost</b> on the 112 th day of pregnancy (15, 39 %) ...|$|E

40|$|Ziel der vorliegenden Arbeit war es, die Auswirkungen verschiedener Prostaglandinpräparate auf die Motilität boviner Spermien {{in vitro}} zu untersuchen. Für die Analysen wurden handelsübliche Minipailletten mit kryokonserviertem bovinem Ejakulat von 10 Bullen der Rasse Deutsche Holstein verwendet. Unmittelbar nach dem Auftauen wurden Einzelproben mit jeweils drei unterschiedlichen Konzentrationen eines PGF 2 alpha-Präparates versetzt. Zum Einsatz kamen die Wirkstoffe <b>Dinoprost,</b> das Cloprostenol-Racemat und das Cloprostenol-Enantiomer. Anschließend wurden mit dem computergestützten System SpermVision® insgesamt 13 Motilitätsparameter erfasst. Die Messungen wurden nach 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 und 24 Stunden Lagerung bei 24 °C im Wärmeschrank wiederholt. Als Kontrollen dienten jeweils Proben ohne jeglichen Zusatz. Es wurden folgende Resultate erzielt: -	Der Anteil beweglicher Spermien wurde sowohl mit dem Cloprostenol-Racemat (p = 0, 0010) als auch dem Cloprostenol-Enantiomer (p = 0, 0003) signifikant reduziert. -	Der Anteil vorwärtsbeweglicher Spermien an der Gesamtzahl beweglicher Spermien verringerte sich ebenfalls signifikant nach Zusatz von Cloprostenol als Racemat (p = 0, 0021) und als Enantiomer (p = 0, 0013). -	Der tatsächlich zurückgelegte Weg (DCL) nahm nach Zusatz von <b>Dinoprost</b> signifikant zu (p = 0, 0028). Mit den synthetischen Prostaglandinen nahm die tatsächliche Weglänge initial ebenfalls zu (p < 0, 0001). -	Die Länge einer geglätteten Linie (DAP) wurde mit <b>Dinoprost</b> in der hohen Konzentration signifikant reduziert (p = 0, 034). Die synthetischen Prostaglandine Cloprostenol-Racemat (p = 0, 011) und Cloprostenol-Enantiomer (p = 0, 013) bewirkten ebenfalls eine Verkürzung der DAP in der jeweils hohen Konzentration. Der Effekt des Cloprostenols trat jedoch frühestens nach 8 Stunden Lagerzeit auf. -	Die Strecke zwischen Start- und Endpunkt (DSL) wurde durch Zugabe der hohen Konzentration <b>Dinoprost</b> signifikant verkürzt (p < 0, 0001). Die beiden Cloprostenolpräparate bewirkten in der hohen Konzentration ebenfalls eine Reduktion der DSL (p = 0, 0001). Initial war jedoch kein Unterschied zur Kontrolle vorhanden. -	Die Kurvolineare Geschwindigkeit (VCL) wurde nach Zugabe der drei Konzentrationen <b>Dinoprost</b> initial signifikant gesteigert (p < 0, 0001). Mit zunehmender Lagerzeit nahm der Konzentrationseinfluss jedoch ab. Das Cloprostenol bewirkte direkt nach dem Auftauen und nach 2 Stunden Lagerzeit sowohl als Racemat (p < 0, 0001) als auch als Enantiomer (p < 0, 0001) eine signifikante Steigerung der VCL. Diese Effekte reduzierten sich im Laufe der Versuchsdauer. -	Die Mittlere Geschwindigkeit (VAP) wurde mit <b>Dinoprost</b> in der hohen Konzentration signifikant verringert (p = 0, 014). Die synthetischen Prostaglandine bewirkten ebenfalls einen Rückgang in der hohen Konzentration Racemat (p = 0, 0033) und Enantiomer (p = 0, 0036) ab einer Lagerzeit von {{mindestens}} 4 Stunden. -	Die Lineare Geschwindigkeit (VSL) war nach Zusatz der hohen Konzentration <b>Dinoprost</b> signifikant kleiner als die der Kontrolle (p < 0, 0001). Die jeweils hohe Konzentration der synthetischen Präparate hatte die gleiche Wirkung (p < 0, 0001), wenngleich der Effekt frühestens nach 2 Stunden Lagerung eintrat. -	Die Linearität (LIN) und die Auslenkung (WOB) der Spermienbewegung, sowie die Geradlinigkeit des durchschnittlichen Bewegungsablaufes (STR) wurden durch die Zugabe der drei Konzentrationen <b>Dinoprost</b> signifikant reduziert (p < 0, 0001). Die Cloprostenolpräparate bewirkten in den hohen Konzentrationen ebenfalls eine Reduktion der drei Parameter LIN, WOB und STR (p < 0, 0001). -	Die Frequenz und die Amplitude der lateralen Kopfbewegungen änderten sich gegensätzlich: mit steigender Konzentration aller Prostaglandine nahmen die Frequenzen signifikant ab (p < 0, 0001), die Amplituden zu. Mit <b>Dinoprost</b> stiegen die Amplituden am deutlichsten (p < 0, 0001), mit dem Racemat (p = 0, 0001) und dem Enantiomer (p = 0, 0010) etwas weniger. Fazit der Untersuchungen ist, dass der Zusatz von Prostaglandinen in hohen Konzentrationen zu aufgetauten bovinen Samenzellen in vitro einen negativen Einfluss auf die Spermienbewegung hat. Niedrige Konzentrationen haben hingegen keinen oder wenig Einfluss auf die Motilitätsparameter. Der tatsächlich zurückgelegte Weg (DCL) und die Kurvolineare Geschwindigkeit (VCL) sind die einzigen Parameter, welche in den vorliegenden Untersuchungen mit Prostaglandinzusatz signifikant gesteigert werden konnten. Ob eine solche Steigerung auch in vivo von Vorteil ist, müsste in weiteren Studien untersucht werden. The {{aim of this}} study was to analyze the in vitro effects of various prostaglandin preparations on the motility of bovine sperm. For the analyses cryoconserved bovine ejaculate from 10 bulls of the race German Holstein was used in commercially available insemination portions. Immediately after thawing, the individual samples were treated each with three different concentrations of a PGF 2 alpha preparation. The active substances <b>dinoprost,</b> the cloprostenol-racemate and the cloprostenol-enantiomer were used. Afterwards, a total of 13 different motility parameters were measured using the computer-assisted sperm analyser SpermVision®. The measurements were repeated after 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 24 hours of storage at 24 °C. Control samples were measured without the addition of active substances. The following results were obtained: - 	The percentage of total motility was significantly reduced by the addition of the cloprostenol-racemate (p = 0. 0010), as well as the cloprostenol-enantiomer (p = 0. 0003). -	The percentage of progressive motility was also significantly reduced by the addition of cloprostenol, both as a racemate (p = 0. 0021) and as an enantiomer (p = 0. 0013). -	The distance curved line (DCL) significantly increased after addition of <b>dinoprost</b> (p = 0. 0028). The same results were initially obtained for the synthetic prostaglandins (p < 0. 0001). -	The distance average path (DAP) was significantly reduced by the addition of the high concentration of <b>dinoprost</b> (p = 0. 034). The synthetic prostaglandins cloprostenol-racemate (p = 0. 011) and cloprostenol-enantiomer (p = 0. 013) also reduced the DAP when using the high concentrations. However, the effect caused by the cloprostenols only appeared at the earliest after 8 hours of storage time. -	The distance straight line (DSL) was significantly shortened by the addition of the high concentration of <b>dinoprost</b> (p < 0. 0001). Both cloprostenol preparations, used in the high concentration, also led to a reduction of the DSL (p = 0. 0001). Initially however, no difference could be seen in comparison to the control. -	The curvilinear velocity (VCL) was initially increased after the addition of the three different concentrations of <b>dinoprost</b> (p < 0. 0001). However, the effect caused by the <b>dinoprost</b> decreased with prolonged storage time. Immediately after thawing and after two hours of storage time the cloprostenol-racemate (p < 0. 0001) as well as the enantiomer (p < 0. 0001) provoked a significant increase of the VCL. This effect decreased over the time course of the experiment. -	The average path velocity (VAP) was significantly reduced (p = 0, 014) in the presence of the high concentration of <b>dinoprost.</b> The addition of the high concentration of the synthetic prostaglandins, cloprostenol-racemate (p = 0. 0033) and cloprostenol-enantiomer (p = 0. 0036), also resulted in a decline, beginning after a storage time of at least four hours. -	The straight line velocity (VSL) was significantly smaller after the addition of the high concentration <b>dinoprost</b> in comparison to the control (p < 0. 0001). The high concentration of both synthetic preparations had the same effect (p < 0. 0001), although the effect was visible after two hours of storage at the earliest. -	The linearity (LIN) and the wobble (WOB) of the sperm motility as well as the straightness (STR) were significantly reduced by the addition of the three different <b>dinoprost</b> concentrations (p < 0. 0001). The high concentrations of both cloprostenol preparations also provoked a reduction of the three parameters LIN, WOB and STR (p < 0. 0001). -	The beat cross frequency (BCF) and the amplitude of lateral head displacement (ALH) changed contrarily: The BCF decreased significantly (p < 0. 0001) with rising concentrations of all prostaglandins, whereas the ALH increased. The amplitudes rose most prominently in the presence of <b>dinoprost</b> (p < 0. 0001), slightly less in the presence of the racemate (p = 0. 0001) and least with the enantiomer (p = 0, 0010). The results of this study demonstrate that the in vitro addition of highly concentrated prostaglandins to thawed bovine sperm cells has a negative influence on sperm motility. Lower concentrations however have no or little impact on the motility parameters. The distance curved line (DCL) and the curvilinear velocity (VCL) are the only parameters in this study which could be significantly increased by the addition of prostaglandins. Further studies would have to analyze whether such an enhancement would also be beneficial in vivo...|$|E

Cyclooxygenase inhibition with indomethacin displaced the dose-response curve to AA {{to the right}} but did not prevent the relaxant effects of the fatty acid. SKF- 525 A, an inhibitor of cytochrome P- 450 -dependent enzymes, also attenuated the response to AA although the combination of SKF- 525 A and indomethacin prevented any relaxant effect. Induction of cytochrome P- 450 -dependent enzymes in the coronary artery with 3 -methylcholanthrene and beta-naphthoflavone given in vivo (40 mg/kg/day for 3 days) or depletion of these enzymes with cobalt chloride (24 mg/kg/day for 2 days) resulted in an enhancement or diminution, respectively, of AA-induced endothelial-dependent relaxations. These results implicate a cytochrome P- 450 -dependent mixed function oxidase in the endothelial-dependent relaxations to AA in the canine coronary artery. Precontraction of coronary arteries with U 46619 in contrast to <b>dinoprost</b> failed to display endothelial-dependent relaxations to AA, whereas the responses to bradykinin and acetylcholine were also partially attenuated.

40|$|Na década de 60, começaram a ser utilizadas técnicas e sincronização do estro, e durante os últimos trinta anos tem sido despertado o interesse do desenvolvimento de métodos para sincronizar o estro de ovelhas. Na maioria das vezes a IA está associada à um protocolo de sincronização do estro podendo assim ser realizada a Inseminação Artificial em Tempo Fixo (IATF). Três experimentos foram realizados com objetivo de avaliar a influência do efeito macho e tipos de rufião, reutilização do dispositivo e o método de inseminação utilizado, na sincronização do estro através do uso de dispositivos intra-vaginais (CIDR®- Control Internal Drog Release), associado com a aplicação {{intramuscular}} de eCG e PGF 2, sobre a taxa detecção e tempo médio para aparecimento do estro, taxa de prenhez na IATF e no primeiro estro após a sincronização. Exp. I: Foram utilizadas 270 ovelhas, separadas em três tratamentos: SM = (controle) sem rufiões; DL= recebeu rufiões com Desvio lateral peniano e o VS= recebeu rufiões vasectomizados. Os tratamentos foram submetidos ao mesmo protocolo, CIDR® por 7 d, aplicação de 300 UI de eCG e 6, 71 mg de <b>Dinoprost</b> trometamina, na retirada do CIDR.

O delineamento utilizado foi de blocos incompletos ao acaso, analisados pelo teste do Qui-quadrado e Tukey (estro). A taxa de detecção de estro no tratamento IATF (exp. III) foi de 59, 7 % sendo menor que os demais tratamentos (P 0, 05). O efeito macho e o tipo de macho não apresentaram diferença na IATF. O protocolo de 11 dias, mostrou-se eficiente em induzir o estro em 79 % das ovelhas sincronizadas. A IA realizada 12 h após o estro propiciou, índice de prenhez semelhante à monta natural, proveniente do estro sincronizado. In the 60 s, estrus synchronization techniques {{began to}} be used, and during the last 30 years has attracted the interest of developing new methods to synchronize estrus in ewes. Three experiments were performed to determine: I) influence of male effect and type of teaser; II) Effect of new and used CIDR® (Control Internal Drug Release) with different time of implant; III) Different time to perform IA after CIDR removal and comparison of laparoscopy method with natural breed, on heat detection and onset of estrus and pregnancy rate of ewes. Exp. I: 270 ewes were used, divided into three treatments: SM = (control) without teaser; DL = teaser with lateral penis deviation and VS = vasectomized teaser. All ewes were subjected to the same protocol: CIDR® for 7 days and received im. 300 UI of eCG plus 6. 71 mg tromethamine <b>dinoprost</b> at CIDR withdrawal. Ewes were artificially inseminated by transcervical method, 55 h after CIDR removal. There was no difference on onset of estrus for LD (55. 7 %) and VS (50. 5 %). Similarly, the distribution of estrus was similar (P> 0. 05) between treatments, where the averages were of 45 : 01 ± 14 : 30 h for LD 12 : 10 h and 44 : 00 ± 12 : 10 h for VS. Pregnancy rate did not differ (P> 0. 05) among treatments and was 34. 0, 34. 4 and 35. 0 % for LD, VS and SM, respectively. The male effect showed no influence on pregnancy rate when fixed-time artificial insemination was used. EXP. II: 275 ewes were used and divided into 4 treatments: 7 N = 7 d with new CIDR; 7 U = 7 d with already used CIDR for 7 d; 11 N = 11 d with new CIDR; 11 U = 11 d with CIDR already used for 7 d. On {{the withdrawal of the}} CIDR (D 7 or D 11) ewes received im. 300 IU of eCG plus 6. 71 mg tromethamine <b>dinoprost</b> at the time of CIDR removal. Ewes were submitted to FTAI, using the transcervical method, 49 h after CIDR withdrawal. Total pregnancy rate in treatment 11 N was higher (86. 6 %, P = 0. 03) as compared with treatment 7 U (71. 4 %). The protocols for estrus synchronization of 7 and 11 d were effective in inducing the expression of estrus. The reuse of CIDR did not influence the rate of onset and average time to onset of estrus and pregnancy rate in the FTAI. Exp. III: 247 ewes were used and divided in four treatments: MN = ewes were synchronized and exposed to males during 20 d; IATF = ewes were synchronized and inseminated by laparoscopy 48 h after CIDR removal; AITF+GnRH= ewes were synchronized and inseminated by laparoscopy using 0. 05 mg gonadorelin, when 50 % of the ewes showed signs of estrus; AI = ewes received im. 300 IU of eCG plus 6. 71 mg tromethamine <b>dinoprost</b> at the time of CIDR removal and were inseminated by laparoscopy, 12 h after the onset of signs of estrus.

Similarmente, os períodos estacionais não interferiram sobre os dias de emergência para as ondas 1, 2, 3, 4 e 5, respectivamente (Anestro: 2, 01 ± 0, 46, 5, 11 ± 0, 47, 9, 33 ± 0, 45, 12, 27 ± 0, 40 e 13, 50 ± 0, 40; Transição: 2, 12 ± 0, 51, 5, 95 ± 0, 52, 10, 32 ± 0, 51, 11, 16 ± 0, 78 e 11, 61 ± 0, 50; e Ciclicidade: 1, 99 ± 0, 42, 5, 95 ± 0, 42, 10, 14 ± 0, 42 e 12, 08 ± 0, 43; P> 0, 05). Na estação de ciclicidade, nenhuma ovelha apresentou cinco ondas. No segundo experimento, foram utilizadas 60 novas fêmeas, sendo 20 para cada período [...] . Two {{experiments}} were conducted, in the first, 70 ewes were submitted {{to one of}} two synchronization protocols in three seasons (Factorial 2 x 3; Non-breeding: G- 1 CIDR, n= 12 and G- 2 CIDR, n= 11; Transition: G- 1 CIDR, n= 12 and G- 2 CIDR, n= 12; Breeding: G- 1 CIDR, n= 11 and G- 2 CIDR, n= 12). On D 0 (randomized day of estrus cycle), the estrus were synchronized with a P 4 device (CIDR) for 14 days. However, in G- 2 CIDR, the CIDR was replaced by a new one on D 7. On D 0 and D 14, 2. 5 mg of a PGF 2 analogue (<b>dinoprost),</b> i. m., were administered, and on D 14, all ewes received 300 IU of eCG (Novormon™, Syntex- Argentina). Ultrasonographic exam was performed daily between D 0 and D 14 and, every 8 hours until D 19. Data were analyzed by GLIMMIX using the SAS (P 0. 05). Similarly, there were no effect of seasons on these variables (Nonbreeding: 2. 01 ± 0. 46, 5. 11 ± 0. 47, 9. 33 ± 0. 45, 12. 27 ± 0. 40 and 13. 50 ± 0. 40; Transition: 2. 12 ± 0. 51, 5. 95 ± 0. 52, 10. 32 ± 0. 51, 11. 61 ± 0. 50 and 11. 16 ± 0. 78 and; Breeding: 1. 99 ± 0. 42, 5. 95 ± 0. 42, 10. 14 ± 0. 42 and 12. 08 ± 0. 43 days for waves 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, respectively, P> 0. 05). In Breeding season no ewes showed five waves. In the second experiment, were used 60 new females, 20 for each season (breeding, transition and non-breeding) and 10 for each group that received one of two superovulatory protocols according to the time that FSH treatment were initiated (G-FirstWave and G-LastWave). Ewes were [...] . (Complete abstract click electronic access below...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} and use of non-invasive techniques would reduce risks of surgery sequels on the same animal and use of the donor could be optimized. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the accuracy of ultrasonography performed prior to embryo collection to estimate superovulation response in sheep. Fifteen pluriparous Santa Inês sheep, 2 to 5 year old, with an average body weight of 46. 79 ± 6. 00 kg and body condition score of 2. 96 ± 0. 32 (1 to 5 scale) were allocated into 3 groups (GI, GII, GIII) in a cross-over design. In GI, intravaginal sponges (60 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate; Progespon®, Schering Plough Animal Health, São Paulo, Brazil) were inserted (Day 0) and maintained for 14 days, and the superovulatory (SOV) protocol started on Day 12. In GII and GIII, intravaginal sponges were inserted (Day 0) and maintained for 6 days. On Day 5, the animals were treated with 300 IU of eCG (Novormon 5000 ®, Schering Plough Animal Health) and 5 mg of <b>dinoprost</b> (Lutalyse® Pfizer Animal Health, São Paulo, Brazil) i. m. Animals in GIII received 0. 025 mg of gonadorelin acetate (Gestran-Plus®, Tecnopec, São Paulo, Brazil) i. m. 12 h after sponge withdrawal. In GII and GIII, the SOV protocol started 48 h after sponge removal and a new sponge was inserted immediately after its removal. The SOV protocol in all groups consisted of 200 mg of pFSH (Folltropin-V®, Tecnopec) administered in 6 decreasing doses given every 12 h (50 / 50, 30 / 30, and 20 / 20 mg). At the time of the fifth dose of pFSH, 5 mg of <b>dinoprost</b> was administered i. m. and the sponges were removed. Animals were bred by a sexually mature ram twice a day until the end of estrus. Prior to embryo collection, an ultrasonographic evaluation (5 MHz, Aloka SSD- 500, Tokyo, Japan) was performed to determine the number of CL present on both ovaries. The number of CL was further evaluated by laparoscopy, when it was possible to detect poor responders or even non-ovulating animals. Statistical analysis was performed using all tests at the 95 % confidence interval by SAEG program. Results are presented as mean ± SE. The number of CL was not different among all groups. The total number (GI, GII, and GIII) of CL determined by ultrasonography (9. 09 ± 5. 01) was not different (P > 0. 05) from that observed by laparoscopy (8. 87 ± 5. 25). A significant correlation (r = 0. 56, P < 0. 0005) between evaluation performed by ultrasonography and laparoscopy was observed. These results suggest that ultrasonography can be used to determine the response to the superovulatory protocol. As embryo collection in sheep is performed mainly by surgical techniques, the implementation of non-invasive techniques such as ultrasonography could avoid unnecessary surgeries on animals that did not respond to the SOV protocol, therefore preventing early culling of embryo donors.

40|$|Abstract Background Rates of labour {{induction}} are increasing. We conducted this {{systematic review}} {{to assess the}} evidence supporting use of each method of labour induction. Methods We listed methods of labour induction then reviewed the evidence supporting each. We searched MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library between 1980 and November 2010 using multiple terms and combinations, including labor, induced/or induction of labor, prostaglandin or prostaglandins, misoprostol, Cytotec, 16, 16,-dimethylprostaglandin E 2 or E 2, dinoprostone; Prepidil, Cervidil, <b>Dinoprost,</b> Carboprost or hemabate; prostin, oxytocin, misoprostol, membrane sweeping or membrane stripping, amniotomy, balloon catheter or Foley catheter, hygroscopic dilators, laminaria, dilapan, saline injection, nipple stimulation, intercourse, acupuncture, castor oil, herbs. We performed a best evidence {{review of the literature}} supporting each method. We identified 2048 abstracts and reviewed 283 full text articles. We preferentially included high quality systematic reviews or large randomised trials. Where no such studies existed, we included the best evidence available from smaller randomised or quasi-randomised trials. Results We included 46 full text articles. We assigned a quality rating to each included article and a strength of evidence rating to each body of literature. Prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) and vaginal misoprostol were more effective than oxytocin in bringing about vaginal delivery within 24 hours but were associated with more uterine hyperstimulation. Mechanical methods reduced uterine hyperstimulation compared with PGE 2 and misoprostol, but increased maternal and neonatal infectious morbidity compared with other methods. Membrane sweeping reduced post-term gestations. Most included studies were too small to evaluate risk for rare adverse outcomes. Conclusions Research is needed to determine benefits and harms of many induction methods. </p...|$|E
