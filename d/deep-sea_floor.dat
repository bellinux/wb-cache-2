40|$|The marine {{environment}} covers almost {{three quarters of}} the planet and is where evolution took its first steps. Extremophile microorganisms are found in several extreme {{marine environment}}s, such as hydrothermal vents, hot springs, salty lakes and <b>deep-sea</b> <b>floors.</b> The ability of these microorganisms to support extremes of temperature, salinity and pressure demonstrates their great potential for biotechnological processes. Hydrolases including amylases, cellulases, peptidases and lipases from hyperthermophiles, psychrophiles, halophiles and piezophiles have been investigated for these reasons. Extremozymes are adapted to work in harsh physical-chemical conditions and their use in various industrial applications such as the biofuel, pharmaceutical, fine chemicals and food industries has increased. The understanding of the specific factors that confer the ability to withstand extreme habitats on such enzymes has become a priority for their biotechnological use.

40|$|<b>Deep-sea</b> <b>floors</b> {{represent}} one of {{the largest}} and most complex ecosystems on Earth but remain essentially unexplored. The vastness and remoteness of this ecosystem make deep-sea sampling difficult, hampering traditional taxonomic observations and diversity assessment. This problem is particularly true in the case of the deep-sea meiofauna, which largely comprises small-sized, fragile, and difficult-to-identify metazoans and protists. Here, we introduce an ultra-deep sequencing-based metagenetic approach to examine the richness of benthic foraminifera, a principal component of deep-sea meiofauna. We used Illumina sequencing technology to assess foraminiferal richness in 31 unsieved deep-sea sediment samples from five distinct oceanic regions. We sequenced an extremely short fragment (36 bases) of the small subunit ribosomal DNA hypervariable region 37 f, which has been shown to accurately distinguish foraminiferal species. In total, we obtained 495, 978 unique sequences that were grouped into 1, 643 operational taxonomic units, of which about half (841) could be reliably assigned to foraminifera. The vast majority of the operational taxonomic units (nearly 90 %) were either assigned to early (ancient) lineages of soft-walled, single-chambered (monothalamous) foraminifera or remained undetermined and yet possibly belong to unknown early lineages. Contrasting with the classical view of multichambered taxa dominating foraminiferal assemblages, our work reflects an unexpected diversity of monothalamous lineages that are as yet unknown using conventional micropaleontological observations. Although we can only speculate about their morphology, the immense richness of deep-sea phylotypes revealed by this study suggests that ultra-deep sequencing can improve understanding of deep-sea benthic diversity considered until now as unknowable based on a traditional taxonomic approach...|$|R

50|$|The {{benthic region}} of the ocean begins at the shore line (intertidal or eulittoral zone) and extends {{downward}} along {{the surface of the}} continental shelf out to sea. The continental shelf is a gently sloping benthic region that extends away from the land mass. At the continental shelf edge, usually about 200 meters deep, the gradient greatly increases and is known as the continental slope. The continental slope drops down to the deep sea floor. The <b>deep-sea</b> <b>floor</b> is called the abyssal plain and is usually about 4,000 meters deep.

40|$|<b>Deep-sea</b> <b>floors</b> are diverse {{environments that}} range from {{permanently}} cold (desert-like plains) to hot systems (hydrothermal vents). In hot systems, primary productivity is performed by microbial communities which use chemical energy generated by geological processes (lithotrophy). This energy transfer from mantle to the ocean is as yet poorly understood, and the diversity and activity of microbes at these sites is therefore an interesting target for microbial ecologists. However, {{the vast majority of}} all globally distributed deep-sea sediments is permanently cold. The distribution of microorganisms in <b>deep-sea</b> <b>floors</b> and the factors controlling it at small and large scales are important for the understanding of the mechanisms that regulate biodiversity. During this thesis, hydrothermally influenced sediments of the peridotite-hosted Logatchev hydrothermal vent field were investigated in an interdisciplinary study to reveal the diversity and activity of the associated microbial communities. In situ microprofiles showed that these sediments were controlled by diffusive transport, instead of previously reported advective processes. White mats on top of these sediments resemble Beggiatoa-mats from the basalt- hosted field in the Guaymas Basin. However, fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed that the overlying sulfur-mats were dominated by filamentous Epsilonproteobacteria or a vibrioid Arcobacter-type. The microbial community of the surface layer was predominantly composed of Epsilonproteobacteria (7 - 21 %), Deltaproteobacteria (20 - 21 %), and Bacteroidetes (19 - 20 %). Comparative 16 S rRNA gene sequence analyses identified various bacteria related to those found in basaltic systems. The presence of an active microbial community in these sediment surface layers was confirmed by high oxygen consumption rates. Geochemical analyses detected metal-sulfides in the sediments, elemental sulfur in the mats and an intensive sulfide flux from below. Ex situ incubations and turnover rate experiments revealed that sulfide is consumed and that sulfate-reduction is performed by the surface sediment microbial community. This was consistent with the detection of aprA-genes and soxB-genes, which are both key genes of the sulfur cycle. Further metabolic capabilities such as denitrification and CO 2 -fixation were indicated by primary analysis of metagenomic data retrieved by pyrosequencing. So far, our analyses suggest that sulfur cycling is one of the driving forces for primary production and biomass formation in surface sediments of the ultramafic-hosted Logatchev hydrothermal vent fields. Therefore, major differences in microbial composition between basalt- and peridotite-hosted fields were not detected. Hydrothermally influenced sediments from the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and permanently cold sediments from three basins of the eastern South Atlantic Ocean were investigated to examine the ability of microorganisms to disperse in the deep-sea. Besides spatial distance, the structuring effect of the physical barrier Walvis Ridge, which separates the Cape Basin from the other two basins, was determined. The analysis of 16 S rRNA gene sequences of the deep- sea sediments revealed phylotypes affiliated with Gammaproteobacteria, Deltaproteobacteria and Acidobacteria, which were present in all three basins. The distribution of these shared phylotypes seemed to be influenced neither by the Walvis Ridge nor by different deep water masses, suggesting a high dispersal capability, as also indicated by low distance decay relationships. In contrast, the comparison of the total bacterial diversity of the cold sediments {{as well as of the}} hydrothermally influenced sediments revealed significant differences between the microbial communities. Within the Logatchev field and therefore for small distances (3000 km), both factors influenced bacterial diversity, indicating a complex interplay of local contemporary environmental effects and dispersal limitation...|$|R
50|$|Only about 2% {{of known}} marine species inhabit the pelagic environment. This {{means that they}} live in the water column as opposed to the benthic organisms that live in or on the sea <b>floor.</b> <b>Deep-sea</b> organisms {{generally}} inhabit bathypelagic (1000-4000m deep) and abyssopelagic (4000-6000m deep) zones. However, characteristics of deep-sea organisms, such as bioluminescence {{can be seen in the}} mesopelagic (200-1000m deep) zone as well. The mesopelagic zone is the disphotic zone, meaning light there is minimal but still measurable. The oxygen minimum layer exists somewhere between a depth of 700m and 1000m deep depending on the place in the ocean. This area is also where nutrients are most abundant. The bathypelagic and abyssopelagic zones are aphotic, meaning that no light penetrates this area of the ocean. These zones make up about 75% of the inhabitable ocean space.|$|R
40|$|Turbidity {{currents}} are {{a variety}} of subaqueous sediment-gravity flows, in which the suspension of sediment by water turbulence produces a water-sediment mixture that is denser than the ambient water and hence flows due to gravity along a topographic gradient. This type of sediment gravity flow is the most important mechanism for the dispersal and deposition of sand on <b>deep-sea</b> <b>floors,</b> {{as well as on the}} underwater slopes of many deltas and lakes. The hydrodynamics of turbidity currents are difficult to study in the natural environments, whereas laboratory experiments are limited to small-scale flows, time-consuming and not necessarily easier when it comes to the measuring of flow properties and establishing of the relationships between the turbulent flow structure and the transport and deposition of sediment. Mathematical models of turbidity current, integrated by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and realized as numerical simulations, can be used to obviate these difficulties, and also to upscale laboratory datasets and to integrate the data from nature and experiments. The concept CFD refers to the numerical solution, by computational methods, of the governing equations describing fluid flow: the set of Navier-Stokes equations and the multi-phase fluid dynamics. CFD is widely used in the engineering branches of fluid mechanics, but is a relatively new numerical approach in the field of sedimentological research. In the present study, a three-dimensional model has been constructed by using the CFD software Flow- 3 D™ to simulate the flow of turbidity currents, including their internal hydraulic characteristics as well as sediment erosion and deposition. The Flow- 3 D™ model employs finite difference and finite volume methods and the turbidity current is being simulated by a range of physical models: 1) the turbulent flow structure is simulated by a turbulence model based on renormalization group theory that employs statistical methods to calculate turbulence quantities; 2) the water-sediment mixture is calculated by a drift-flux technique that describes the relative flow of two miscible fluids with different densities; 3) interactions between the continuous fluid and the dispersed mass particles are calculated by the particle model; and 4) the erosion and deposition of sediment are calculated by the sediment scour model. Simulations of small-scale turbidity currents imitating particular laboratory flows have shown that the results of Flow- 3 D™ are realistic and reliable. Similar series of flow simulations have been used further: 1) to display in a flow-parallel axial section the main hydraulic characteristics (bulk density, shear-strain rate, dynamic viscosity, velocity magnitude and its x-y-z components) of a channelconfined current; 2) to display of the shear stress, sediment concentration and velocity magnitude for several ‘probing stations’ in a channel-confined current expanding abruptly on an open-space flat floor; 3) to study the responses of the confined and unconfined parts of a current (in terms of its velocity magnitude, shear stress and sediment concentration) to changes in such principal controlling parameters as the channel slope angle, sediment grain size, floor roughness and initial sediment concentration; 4) to display sediment grain-size segregation in a current (using a flow run with polysized sediment suspension); 5) to display the velocity time series for a surge-type and a sustained turbidity current; and 6) to show the responses of turbidity current to various obstacles and to a hydraulic jump at the channel outlet. Two large-scale simulations of ‘real-life’ turbidity currents have been performed, one imitating modern flow events in the Soquel and Monterey canyons, offshore California, and another pertaining to the deposition of the Egga reservoir unit in the Ormen Lange field, Mid-Norway Continental Shelf. The present study has evaluated Flow- 3 D™ as a possible means of simulating hydrodynamic behaviour of turbidity currents. The comparison of numerical and flume data indicates that the CFDbased Flow- 3 D™ models can give realistic results and serve as an attractive alternative to laboratory flume experiments. The use of a CFD software, such as the Flow- 3 D™, has several great advantages: 1) it allows a much wider range of flow parameters to be determined and continuously monitored with a relatively high accuracy; 2) it permits the response and relative importance of the individual flow parameters to be assessed with respect to changes in the initial conditions; 3) it allows turbidity currents to be up-scaled to natural conditions; and 4) it provides an unprecedented insight in the detailed hydrodynamic aspects of turbidity current. The study indicates that our understanding of turbidites and their variability can be significantly improved by this type of experimental research...|$|R

40|$|Understanding {{biodiversity}} and its patterns across space, time and environmental gradients is central {{in order to}} assess the functioning of natural systems and their resilience to external perturbations. To date, the <b>deep-sea</b> <b>floor</b> and its associated ecosystems remain one of least explored environments on Earth, hence, little is known about their biodiversity, and especially that of microbes. Here we investigated the biogeochemical activity and associated bacterial biodiversity of two hotspot ecosystems in the deep-sea, the cold seeps and wood falls. Cold seeps and wood falls are peculiar ecosystems at the <b>deep-sea</b> <b>floor,</b> at which unique sources of energy such as methane and wood-derived cellulose fuel high biomasses of faunal communities with special diversity, typically not encountered at the <b>deep-sea</b> <b>floor.</b> In this study we specifically focused on the investigation of microbial communities since on one hand their diversity patterns are the least understood, and also because their capabilities to utilize methane and cellulose are crucial for the supply of energy to these ecosystems. Cold seeps and wood falls are isolated and fractured ecosystems with only small areal coverage, which poses a challenge for the dispersal of their associated communities and maintenance of their populations. The interconnectivity of these isolated ecosystems and the biodiversity patterns of microbes across different spatial scales are largely unknown. The combination of molecular fingerprinting and geochemical approaches used in this study helped to understand how microbial communities of seep and wood falls are connected over different spatial scales and identify the main environmental factors shaping their diversity. In Chapter I the local-scale patterns of bacterial community structure and their relation to the sediment heterogeneity was investigated at the REGAB cold seep pockmark. Strong variations in the sediment geochemistry and the core biogeochemical processes were detected between different reduced habitats, which were related to differences in the methane effluxes that ranged over two orders of magnitude. Variation in the structure of bacterial communities was linked to local sediment heterogeneity. Methane, the main energy source at cold seeps, was identified as the most important factor that shaped the seep bacterial community structure and distributions of chemosynthetic megafauna. The link between the relative abundance of symbiotic bacteria in the gills of a cold seep chemosynthetic mussel and their energy sources was investigated in Chapter II. Mussels inhabiting gassy sediments laden with methane had relatively higher abundance of methanotrophic symbionts that take up methane, in comparison to thiotrophic symbionts that rely on sulfide as their source of energy. In addition, the abundances of methanotrophs seemed to be linked to variations in methane concentrations in the bottom water, and were correlated with the content of methane-derived carbon in the mussel biomass. The results presented in Chapter III reveal how seep bacterial communities vary on local and regional scales, within and between cold seep sites. Variation in the seep bacterial community was not correlated to geographic distance, and instead communities displayed patchy structure reflecting on the variability in the sulfide content, as their main energy source. Highest bacterial turnover, with > 50 % replacement with new bacterial types was evident between reduced habitats, separated by few meters to hundreds of meters. This result suggest that small reduced habitats, not more than few meters in diameter, represent biodiversity hotspots and contribute substantially to the overall diversity of the <b>deep-sea</b> <b>floor.</b> In the last chapter (IV) the temporal and spatial variations of communities associated to wood falls were investigated using experimental wood deployments. The {{results of this study suggest}} that biogeography plays an important role for the composition of both bacteria and fauna of wood-associated communities. Temporal succession of bacterial and faunal communities occurred within a period of 1 to 2 y. During the whole immersion period the bacterial communities associated to the wood fall remained distinct from the surrounding background sediments, indicating that wood falls represent an important source of diversity in the <b>deep-sea</b> <b>floor...</b>|$|E

Smectite increases with depth in box cores from 26 to 39 % and from 53 to 66 % in the easternmost and westernmost areas respectively, and with distance seaward from the Amer-icas from 26 to 53 % in surface deposits. The change {{in the amount of}} smectite relative to other clay minerals is due to dilution by terrigenous debris; smectite probably forms at a uniform rate over much of the North Pacific <b>deep-sea</b> <b>floor.</b> The 6018 value for the smectite is + 29. 6 % 0 which suggests hat it formed authigen-ically at a temperature characteristic of the <b>deep-sea</b> <b>floor.</b> The smectite isan Fe-rich montmorillonite that probably forms by the low-temperature chemical combination ofFe hydroxides and silica.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{deep sea}} floor is {{considered}} one of the most diverse ecosystems on Earth. Recent environmental DNA surveys based on clone libraries of rRNA genes confirm this observation and reveal a high diversity of eukaryotes present in deep-sea sediment samples. However, environmental clone-library surveys yield only a modest number of sequences with which to evaluate the diversity of abyssal eukaryotes. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we examined the richness of eukaryotic DNA in deep Arctic and Southern Ocean samples using massively parallel sequencing of the 18 S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) V 9 hypervariable region. In very small volumes of sediments, ranging from 0. 35 to 0. 7 g, we recovered up to 7, 499 unique sequences per sample. By clustering sequences having up to 3 differences, we observed from 942 to 1756 Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) per sample. Taxonomic analyses of these OTUs showed that DNA of all major groups of eukaryotes is represented at the <b>deep-sea</b> <b>floor.</b> The dinoflagellates, cercozoans, ciliates, and euglenozoans predominate, contributing to 17 %, 16 %, 10 %, and 8 % of all assigned OTUs, respectively. Interestingly, many sequences represent photosynthetic taxa or are similar to those reported from the environmental surveys of surface waters. Moreover, each sample contained from 31 to 71 different metazoan OTUs despite the small sample volume collected. This indicates that a significant faction of the eukaryotic DNA sequences likely do not belong to living organisms, but represent either free, extracellular DNA or remains and resting stages of planktonic species. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: In view of our study, the <b>deep-sea</b> <b>floor</b> appears as a global DNA repository, which preserves genetic information about organisms living in the sediment, as well as in the water column above it. This information can be used for future monitoring of past and present environmental changes...|$|E
40|$|The Artic polar deep-sea {{is one of}} {{the least}} {{explored}} ecosystems of the world. With the help of camera surveys, more information is being collected on the composition of megafauna, as well as the environmental factors on the <b>deep-sea</b> <b>floor.</b> The megafauna {{play an important role in}} contributing to the benthic biomass and the environmental factors shape this habitat, e. g. through large stones or other hard substrate which animals can settle on. In this thesis, two stations, which are influenced by different water masses, are compared to see how different the communities are. The first station is HAUSGARTEN IV, which is influenced through the warmer West Spitsbergen Current. The second station is east Greenland IV, which is influenced through the colder East Greenland current. Both are 2. 500 m deep and run at comparable latitude. HAUSGARTEN is part of a Long-Term-Ecological Research project in the eastern Fram Strait run by the Alfred-Wegener-Institute Bremerhaven. The east Greenland station was established in the western Fram Strait in 2014. This is also the year the images from this thesis were taken during a research cruise of the ice breaker Polarstern. At east Greenland IV the megafauna densities (20. 67 ± 0. 011 individuals/m²) were significantly higher than at HAUSGARTEN IV (15. 67 ± 0. 040 individuals/m²). This study also focused more closely on the composition at east Greenland IV, as it was the first time this transect was analysed. No significant differences were found between the three sub-sections at east Greenland. While comparing both the stations among each other as well as comparing the three sub-sections, the key species, which caused differences in composition were determined as well as the composition of the megafauna on the <b>deep-sea</b> <b>floor.</b> Environmental factors as well as ice-coverage and the biogeochemistry data of the sea floor were analysed, to see if they influenced the species composition...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT We report herein the {{occurrence}} of the infraorder Polychelida in Potiguar Basin, northeastern Brazil. Specimens were collected by the project "Avaliação da Biota Bentônica e Planctônica na porção offshore das Bacias Potiguar e Ceará", developed by the Brazilian Oil Company (PETROBRAS). Three species were recorded {{for the first time}} in this region: Pentacheles validus A. Milne-Edwards, 1880, Polycheles typhlops Heller, 1862, and Stereomastis sculpta (Smith, 1880) at 2000 m, 400 m and 2057 m depth, respectively. The Brazilian <b>deep-sea</b> <b>floor</b> remains poorly known, but progress has been made as a result of collections obtained by oceanographic expeditions and research projects developed by PETROBRAS in Campos Basin (Rio de Janeiro) and Potiguar Basin (Rio Grande do Norte), expanding the knowledge of the distribution area of Polychelidae in Brazilian deep sea waters...|$|E
40|$|Surface {{productivity}} is {{correlated with the}} rate of accumulation of benthic foraminifera on the <b>deep-sea</b> <b>floor.</b> As a rule of thumb, for each 1 mg of organic carbon arriving at the sea floor, one benthic foram shell > 150 µm is deposited. The correlation {{can be used to}} reconstruct organic flux to the sea floor in the past, and hence the productivity of past oceans. Applying the appropriate equations to box core data from the Ontong Java Plateau in the western equatorial Pacific, we found that productivity during the last glacial maximum exceeded present productivity by a factor of between 1. 5 and 2. 0, with intermediate values for the mid-transition period. Accumulation of benthic foraminifera was depressed on top of the plateau during the glacial and transitional period, presumably because increased winnowing removed part of the food supply...|$|E
