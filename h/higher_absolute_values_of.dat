The inclusion criteria were first-time hospitalization and without administration of systemic drug therapy or exposure to phototherapy for psoriasis for at least 1 month. Detailed systemic indexes were mainly evaluated. Results: The abnormality rates of blood routine examination, urine examination, blood biochemical examination and chest X-ray of 43 psoriatic patients were significantly higher than those of 44 non-psoriasis controls, and psoriasis patients significantly had <b>higher</b> <b>absolute</b> <b>values</b> <b>of</b> leukocytes and neutrophils, and significantly lower values of lymphocytes.

40|$|We {{present results}} from N-body + magnetohydrodynamical {{simulations}} of merging clusters of galaxies. We find that cluster mergers cause various characteristic magnetic field structures {{because of the}} strong bulk flows in the intracluster medium. The moving substructures result in cool regions surrounded by the magnetic field. These will be recognized as magnetized cold fronts in the observational point of view. A relatively ordered magnetic field structure is generated just behind the moving substructure. Eddy-like field configurations are also formed by Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities. These features are similarly seen even in off-center mergers though the detailed structures change slightly. The above-mentioned characteristic magnetic field structures are partly recognized in Faraday rotation measure maps. The <b>higher</b> <b>absolute</b> <b>values</b> <b>of</b> the rotation measure are expected when observed along the collision axis, because of the elongated density distribution and relatively ordered field structure along the axis.

30|$|In general, <b>higher</b> <b>absolute</b> <b>values</b> <b>of</b> mean {{rotation}} during pivoting {{are measured}} {{in our study}} compared to other authors (28.5 ° (Table  2) vs. 15.3 ° (Tsarouhas) and 22.5 ° (Ristanis)) (Ristanis et al., 2006, Tsarouhas et al., 2011). These differences might be attributed to different definitions of neutral position (i.e., 0 ° knee rotation). Therefore, in our study, a neutral rotational position {{was defined as a}} knee angle five frames before foot contact, while others most often used a standing trial to define the neutral position (Ristanis et al., 2006, Tsarouhas et al., 2010, Tsarouhas et al., 2011, Webster et al., 2010). Thus, this neutral position was chosen to ensure that no external moment affected the limb, forcing zero rotation to correspond to zero moment, which makes sense mechanically because rotation is caused by moments. This furthermore provided us with two sets of corresponding moment-rotation values, enabling us to calculate rotational stiffness, defined as change in moment divided by change in rotation. However, absolute values are of lesser importance in studies where the outcome variable is a difference between absolute values (in our case, absolute ACLD and ACLI rotation angle values).|$|E

Methods: A sample of 1035 adolescents aged 12 – 20 years (565 girls and 470 boys) was used in the study. BMI was calculated through the quotient of weight (kg) /height squared (m) 2, and MetS was defined according to the criteria of the International Diabetes Federation.

Results: The three diagnostic criteria showed <b>higher</b> <b>absolute</b> <b>values</b> <b>of</b> sensitivity and specificity for predicting MetS in boys and older adolescents.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the relationship between VO(2 PEAK) and body fat measurements in young children at a population-based level. Methods. Cross-sectional study of 225 children (128 boys and 97 girls) aged 8 - 11 years, recruited from a population-based cohort. Total lean body mass (LBM), total fat mass (TBF), and abdominal fat mass (AFM) were measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Body fat was also calculated as a percentage of body mass (BF%) and body fat distribution as AFM/TBF. VO(2 PEAK) was assessed by indirect calorimetry during maximal exercise test. Results. Significant relationships existed between body fat measurements and VO(2 PEAK) in both boys and girls, with Pearson correlation coefficients for absolute values of VO(2 PEAK) (0. 22 - 0. 36, P< 0. 05), and for VO(2 PEAK) scaled by body mass (- 0. 38 - - 0. 70, P< 0. 05).

RF (13. 56 MHz) energy was applied using capacitive coupling via flexible pillows perfused with cooled 6 % saline (Griffiths et al., 1983 a). Temperatures in tumour and normal tissue were monitored with multi-junction, copper-constantan thermocouples inserted into nylon catheters implanted in the tissue by the standard technique for iridium implants (Paine, 1972). Temperature measurements were intrinsically accurate to + 0. 1 °C. Twelve patients were treated on a total of 29 occasions, and during treatment similar decreases in temperature were observed.

40|$|We {{explore the}} {{degeneracy}} and discreteness {{problems in the}} standard cosmological model (Λ CDM). We use the Observational Hubble Data (OHD) and the type Ia supernova (SNe Ia) data to study this issue. In order to describe the discreteness in fitting of data, we define a factor G to test the influence from each single data point and analyze the goodness of G. Our results indicate that a <b>higher</b> <b>absolute</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> G shows a better capability of distinguishing models, which means the parameters are restricted into smaller confidence intervals with a larger figure of merit evaluation. Consequently, we claim that the factor G is an effective way in model differentiation when using different models to fit the observational data.

The <b>higher</b> the <b>absolute</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> the {{beta coefficient}}, the stronger the effect. The result revealed that the number of completed quizzes (β=. 230), the mid course point (β=. 231), and irregularity of study interval (β=−[*]. 158) were the most important predictor variables.|$|R
