40|$|This {{article is}} {{concerned}} with two aspects of the NLRB reinstatement remedy as applied in the famous Kohler case: (1) how effective the remedy was, particularly {{in terms of the}} number of employees who returned to Kohler under its protection, and (2) what factors, in order of significance, affected a worker 2 ̆ 7 s decision to return. The authors find the remedy was effective, since about 40 percent of those workers who received reinstatement offers accepted them. Regression and discriminant analyses of the variables affecting the decision to return confirm the thinking of labor market economists that the most <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>worker</b> (lower paid, older, less educated, less skilled, married, with children and with a nonworking wife) was most likely to return to a Kohler job. Recommendations are offered for improving the efficacy of the reinstatement remedy, with emphasis on adding a penalty cost to its back-pay feature...|$|E
40|$|Despite low open unemployment, {{labor market}} {{outcomes}} are unsatisfactory in Moldova. Employment {{is low and}} job opportunities are scarce. The author examines labor market performance in Moldova by focusing on firm dynamics. He finds that {{the low level of}} employment in Moldova is due to the low rate of firm entry and the low rate of job creation in existing firms. Although the rate of job destruction is high, this is typical of transition economies, and is a problem only because it is not coupled with a commensurate rate of job creation. Firm exit is limited and thus is not an important factor behind job losses. The only sector of the economy that creates jobs on a net basis is that consisting of de novo private and small firms. However, in Moldova this sector is significantly smaller than in the most successful transition economies. The author argues that the primary factor behind the small size of the employment generating sector is the high cost of doing business in Moldova. These include numerous administrative barriers, intrusive and costly inspections, and associated corruption. These costs-extremely high even by regional standards-lower the expected returns to business activity and thus discourage firm formation and growth. The author hence recommends improvements in the investment climate as a primary policy aimed at increasing productive employment and lowering unemployment. Priority should be given to fostering job creation through facilitating the formation of new firms and to reducing the constraints on the expansion of existing firms. The government should avoid measures aimed at forestalling the destruction of unviable jobs and firm exit as these are not conducive to long-run productivity and employment growth. Enhancing labor market flexibility is a further priority, as currently the apparently stringent provisions of the Labor Code are not complied with and enforced. Given the unsatisfactory business environment, active labor market programs are unlikely to be effective unless carefully targeted at the most <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>worker</b> groups.

40|$|The Invisibility Hypothesis {{holds that}} the job skills of <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>workers</b> are not easily {{discovered}} by potential new employers, but that promotion enhances visibility and alleviates this problem.

These modifications can be seen through two significant features: firstly the introduction of new list of <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>workers</b> and secondly the adoption of a new approach in the definition of severely <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>workers.</b> The several significant changes regard also the aid for the recruitment of <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>workers</b> in the form of wage subsidies (in particular concerning an incentive effect and the obligation to ensure continuous employment for a minimum period) and the introduction of a specific provision for aid for compensating the costs of assistance provided to <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>workers.</b> Finally we focus on the criteria for the staff headcount and we highlight their implications on employment law...|$|R
40|$|We use {{data from}} surveys of {{employers}} and households in four metropolitan areas {{to predict the}} degree of job availability for various types of <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>workers,</b> such as minorities, high school dropouts, and welfare recipients.

We conclude that <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>workers</b> face quite limited job availability, {{at least in the short}} run. The wages and benefits for jobs available to these workers are also quite low. ...|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{revitalization}} of non-agricultural self-employment among men, and especially among women, since 1970, little research has examined sex differences in self-employment participation and outcomes using national longitudinal probability samples. In addition, even less research has examined how these sex differences vary by occupational status. Using data from each census between 1940 and 1990, along with data from the 1979 [...] 1998 waves of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, this dissertation examines sex differences in the historical context of and trends in self-employment, factors that affect the likelihood of self-employment entrance, and earnings returns to self-employment. Analyses are run separately for non-professional and professional workers. Sex differences in the effects of human capital and labor supply, occupational and industrial sex segregation, job characteristics, family factors, and demographic characteristics on self-employment participation and earnings are explored. General theories of self-employment participation, based on the experiences of men, are tested {{to see if they}} can explain women's self-employment experiences as well. These theories include three versions of the <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>worker</b> theory [...] that workers with fewer employable skills, workers in bad jobs, and workers that face employer discrimination will turn to and benefit from self-employment. Two gendered theories that take women's structural position in the economy and the family are also examined. These theories argue that women whose family responsibilities conflict with work obligations and highly skilled women who are trying to circumvent employer discrimination will turn to and benefit from self-employment. Findings show support for the gender-neutral discouraged worker and the gendered work and family conflict theories. Workers in bad jobs are more likely to become self-employed, as are married women and mothers. Less support is found for the glass ceiling breaker theory. Female childless professionals are the only group of women who benefit equally from self-employment, compared with men. All other women face earnings penalties for being self-employed. However, the benefits of self-employment, such as lower child care costs, greater flexibility in work schedules, and control over the intensity of work may compensate for the self-employment penalty mothers incur...|$|E

This led to less pay to <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>workers</b> in lower-level positions even when they otherwise had the same education and ability as their more advantaged co-workers.

40|$|Despite Australia enjoying {{unprecedented}} growth {{since the}} early 1990 s, pockets of socio-demographic and regional disadvantage persist.

At the aggregate level, high growth regions appear to have had more equitable rates of growth across occupations relative to low or medium growth regions. However growth in the late 1990 s has not significantly altered the structure of labour market disadvantage and the gap in the relative probabilities of unemployment between disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged participants persists.

40|$|This {{paper is}} a brief for the {{introduction}} of a subsidy to any qualified firm for its use of low-wage employees as a means to reduce the unemployment and raise the pay of <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>workers.</b> There would be a case for such a wage subsidy in all the advanced market economies, and certainly the American one, regardless of recent trends. The case has grown stronger, however, with the worsening of the relative wages and especially the unemployment rates of low-age workers. The globalization of investment and the bias of technical progress are the causes most often suggested. I would add the growth of the welfare system—the public entitlements to hospitalization, to retirement and disability insurance, and to the benefits labeled "welfare" in the narrow sense. Since this factor tends to be overlooked, I devote Section I to it. Section II proceeds to the case for a low-wage employment subsidy. It will be clear that the beneficial effects of the subsidy on <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>workers</b> are the mirror opposite of the harmful side effects of the welfare system, side effects that the subsidy would counteract...|$|R

30|$|In {{order to}} enhance their cost-effectiveness, hiring {{subsidies}} can be targeted at <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>workers,</b> for example long-term unemployed workers. As highlighted by Martin and Grubb (2001) and Neumark (2013), tight targeting can raise net employment impact by 20 – 30 percent, but it needs to balance still being attractive for employers to take up as well to avoiding stigmatization. A study by Fay (1996) on a smallscale British project for long-term unemployed people concluded that the deadweight loss amounted {{to no more than}} between 15 and 20 percent 79. Employers may be asked to reimburse a share of the subsidy if the worker is dismissed within a certain period, which would also decrease churning and increase transition effects 80. Documentation and reporting requirements may however create cost-intensive monitoring or bureaucratic procedures, thereby reducing employer take-up 81. Recent evidence by Moczal (2013) on German wage subsidies for hard to place welfare recipients confirms low deadweight costs but also low take-up of tight targeting. Stigmatization results from too tight targeting of very <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>workers,</b> since workers participating in the program may then be perceived as signaling low productivity. Thus, too tight targeting can result in employers refraining from hiring workers, stigmatizing workers and effectively reducing their future employment. Evidence for this effect has also been widely documented 82.|$|R

30|$|In this paper, {{we attempt}} {{to fill the gap}} by {{providing}} evidence of the effectiveness of an ALMP called Interventi di Coesione Sociale (Interventions for Social Cohesion, or ICS), which was recently implemented in the Southern Italian region of Sardinia. 4 The main aim of this ALMP was to improve employment probabilities and income for <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>workers</b> using a set of interventions comprising, among other tactics, counseling, employment subsidies and matching services. At first, this ALMP was considered as a pilot study of the Italian national program for labor market policies. However, its primary intervention consisted of a temporary employment subsidy paid to private firms hiring eligible workers. Like most ALMPs, even the ICS program was not specifically targeted by gender but was more broadly targeted to <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>workers.</b> However, eligibility conditions were different depending on gender: women needed only be unemployed, whereas men had to fulfill stricter conditions. As a result, 75 % of our sample (and of program participants) are women. This is hardly surprising because Sardinia is among Italy’s least-developed regions, {{and in terms of the}} labor market gender differential, LFS data indicate that Sardinia’s female labor market participation rates are quite low (50 % in 2010).|$|R
