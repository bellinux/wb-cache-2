500|$|We {{would have}} little family talks. They began at first with Malcolm telling me what he {{expected}} of a wife. But the first time <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>what</b> I expected {{of him as a}} husband it came as a shock. After dinner one night he said, [...] "Boy, Betty, something you said hit me like a ton of bricks. Here I've been going along having our little workshops with me doing all the talking and you doing all the listening." [...] He concluded our marriage should be a mutual exchange.|$|E
2500|$|The {{syllogism}} was {{too much}} for Ted. He collapsed and fell on his umbrella which, though the night was hot, he had carried with him for hours neatly rolled up, and he broke it into two equal halves. We then, the sergeant and I, put him to bed, the sergeant all the time solicitously muttering, 'I bror 'im home. Jus' a l'il drunk, tha's all, pore f'ler.' Next morning Ted came down to breakfast fresh as a daisy and saw the broken halves of his umbrella which Mrs. Rodenhurst had carefully laid on the sofa. 'What the 'ell,' said Ted blankly. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>what</b> had occurred the night before. Ted reflected; 'Ah remember as far as commin' out of t' King's Arms wi' t' sergeant and gettin' as far as t' Royal Oak, An' Ah remembers nowt else.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|One night I went to Q-Tip's {{solo album}} release party {{and at some}} point in the night, I ran into the guy everyone's been telling me is behind the bootleg. So I {{approached}} him. When <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>what</b> I suspected, to my surprise, he got real loud with me right there in the middle of the club. It was strange. We separated and I went over to the bar. I was sitting there like, [...] "No the fuck this nigga did not....." [...] I was talking to people, but I was really talking to myself out loud, just in a state of shock. Before I even realized what I was doing, I headed back over to him, but this time I was blacking out with anger. The next thing I knew, all hell had broken loose in the club. That night the guy went straight to the police and I was indicted...|$|E
6000|$|... "I won’t deceive you, Joe, I ’ave not," [...] {{replied the}} old man. [...] "He’ll {{have to stay}} down here of a daytime, an’ only come on deck of a night when it’s our watch. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>’im</b> <b>what</b> a lot of good-’arted chaps you was, and how—" ...|$|R
60|$|At {{these words}} Oros showed neither curiosity nor surprise; {{it was as}} though <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> only <b>what</b> he knew.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> in <b>what</b> light <b>I</b> saw his conduct; {{he walked}} a little off, I {{following}} to upbraid him; {{and at last}} he stopped me with his hand.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>what</b> {{had passed}} between Rankeillor and myself {{before the house}} of Shaws.|$|E
60|$|In a {{few words}} <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>what</b> had happened. The lawyer was much surprised.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>what</b> Wood had said, {{adding that}} I also was uneasy; I {{did not know}} why.|$|E
6000|$|... "Had another wrangle with Jason Sparr," [...] {{explained}} Phil, {{after the}} meal. [...] "He followed me {{to one of}} the stores, and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> just <b>what</b> <b>I</b> thought of him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not quite," [...] John replied. [...] "He {{asked me}} what concern it was of mine, and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> exactly <b>what</b> my concern was. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> hoped that some day you would be my wife." ...|$|R
60|$|We parted. <b>I</b> had <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>what</b> {{was on my}} mind. I {{could do}} no more. After all, it might be quite {{possible}} that his view was the right one, and mine the wrong.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>what</b> had happened, and how I had {{contrived}} {{to put off}} {{the inevitable}} disclosure for a time.|$|E
6000|$|... "Listen, then! Three {{nights ago}} I lifted that curtain, {{by the side}} of one who has left you for ever, and I saw you in his arms. I {{followed}} him out of the house; I walked by his side to Vaux Abbey, and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>what</b> I have told you. I wasted no time in idle threats. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>what</b> power was mine, and I said 'Choose!' He was silent!" ...|$|E
60|$|P. 362. Burnet. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him,</b> <b>what</b> {{afterwards}} happened, {{that most}} of these would make their own terms, and leave him in the lurch.--Swift. True sublime.|$|E
60|$|I shrugged my shoulders, {{but did not}} speak. I had {{no sympathy}} for Blanche Stroeve, but {{knew that it would}} only pain poor Dirk if <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> exactly <b>what</b> <b>I</b> thought of her.|$|R
60|$|As I {{drove to}} the house <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> of <b>what</b> had passed, and of how my own diary {{had come to be}} of some use through Mrs. Harker's suggestion, at which the Professor {{interrupted}} me.|$|R
6000|$|... 'There {{are only}} two persons {{in this country who}} know {{anything}} of me,' replied the prisoner. 'One is a plain Liddesdale sheep-farmer, called Dinmont of Charlie's Hope; but he knows nothing more of me than <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him,</b> and <b>what</b> <b>I</b> now tell you.' ...|$|R
60|$|In a {{few words}} <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>what</b> I wanted, stating that I wished to hear {{whatever}} the trio in the cabin {{had to say about}} me.|$|E
6000|$|... "I couldn't stand {{any more}} of this an' ran into our room where my husband was. When <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>what</b> had happened, he was real sorry.|$|E
6000|$|... "Neither did I," [...] I remarked grimly, [...] "until last night." [...] And then <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>what</b> had {{happened}} to me. He listened eagerly to my story.|$|E
6000|$|... "Knows?" [...] I laughed. [...] "In the {{excitement}} of these other matters you have forgotten to ask how I come to be at liberty. I {{have been to the}} King, monsieur, and <b>I</b> have <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>what</b> has taken place here at Toulouse, and how I was to have gone to the block tomorrow!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Personally," [...] Barrington continued, [...] "I {{could see}} no object {{whatever}} in my visit. I {{have nothing to say}} to him, nor, I should think, he to me. I am sorry for him, of course, but he'd never believe me if <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> so. <b>What</b> happened to <b>him</b> was partly my fault, and unless he's changed, he's not likely to forget it." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> {{all about}} <b>what</b> <b>I</b> had been doing, where I had gone, and {{everything}} I {{could think of}} likely to amuse him, and {{was still in the}} middle of my story when Miss Harmer came in.|$|R
60|$|He had {{not changed}} much except to get a bit fatter and more prosperous- looking. Of course, we talked about her ladyship, and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>what</b> she said.|$|E
6000|$|... 'They are gone!' said I, {{and in a}} few curt words <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>what</b> had happened. His {{face was}} calm, but I saw the {{compasses}} quiver in his hand.|$|E
6000|$|... "Blodgett {{was driving}} {{in some of}} Tyner's calves, and I caught him. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>what</b> I thought of him, and he shot at me through his pocket. That was all." ...|$|E
60|$|He now {{looked like}} a friend: that indescribable smile and sparkle were gone; those {{formidable}} arched curves of lip, nostril, eyebrow, were depressed; repose marked his attitude--attention sobered his aspect. Won to confidence, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> exactly <b>what</b> <b>I</b> had seen: ere now I had narrated to him {{the legend of the}} house--whiling away with that narrative an hour of a certain mild October afternoon, when he and I rode through Bois l'Etang.|$|R
60|$|Cecil {{looked as}} though he thought <b>I</b> might have <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>what</b> the idea was, but he said nothing. In a few minutes he pulled up outside a neat, red-brick house, which, as a shining brass plate indicated, was Dr. Schofield's abode.|$|R
60|$|LORD LOAM. My dear, that is {{the volcano}} to which I was referring. (He has evidently {{something}} to communicate.) It's all Mary's fault. She said to me yesterday that she would break her engagement with Brocklehurst unless <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> about--you know <b>what.</b>|$|R
60|$|He drove rapidly off as {{the clock}} struck six, and an uneasy glance he gave the upper windows did not escape me. When Farrar appeared, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>what</b> had happened.|$|E
6000|$|... "I know it," [...] I answered, [...] "but, son, {{there is}} still work {{to do if you}} want to save your wife----" [...] and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>what</b> I had learned.|$|E
6000|$|... '"Alas!" [...] said I, [...] "then my Manor {{is already}} forfeit. I am under vow not {{to enter the}} Great Hall." [...] And <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>what</b> I had sworn to the Lady Ælueva.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'He shall not, {{through any}} act of mine, come back wi' the unmerited reproach of being brought back. He shall come {{back of his}} own accord to clear himself, and put all those that have injured his good character, and he not here for its defence, to shame. <b>I</b> have <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>what</b> has been done against him,' said Rachael, {{throwing}} off all distrust as a rock throws of the sea, 'and he will be here, at furthest, in two days.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Stop! You don't come in here,' said Mr Snawley's better-half, {{interposing}} her person, {{which was}} a robust one, in the doorway. 'You have said {{more than enough to}} him on business, before now. <b>I</b> always <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>what</b> dealing with you and working out your schemes would come to. It was either you or the schoolmaster--one of you, or the two between you--that got the forged letter done; remember that! That wasn't his doing, so don't lay it at his door.' ...|$|R
60|$|After {{breaking}} {{out in that}} way, he abstained from speaking again until he had composed himself. We walked silently, side by side, {{for a minute or}} two, and then he asked me what had become of Sergeant Cuff. It was impossible to put Mr. Franklin off with the excuse of the Sergeant being in my room, composing his mind. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> exactly <b>what</b> had happened, mentioning particularly what my lady's maid and the house-maid had said about Rosanna Spearman.|$|R
