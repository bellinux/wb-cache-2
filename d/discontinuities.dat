5|$|A related {{issue to}} the classic horizon problem arises because in most {{standard}} cosmological inflation models, inflation ceases well before electroweak symmetry breaking occurs, so inflation should {{not be able to}} prevent large-scale <b>discontinuities</b> in the electroweak vacuum since distant parts of the observable universe were causally separate when the electroweak epoch ended.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} {{component}} forms {{used to construct}} distributed element filters, but all have the common property of causing a discontinuity on the transmission line.

5|$|Philosophy of {{psychiatry}} explores philosophical questions relating to psychiatry and mental illness. The philosopher {{of science and}} medicine Dominic Murphy identifies three areas of exploration in the philosophy {{of psychiatry}}. The first concerns the examination of psychiatry as a science, using the tools of the philosophy of science more broadly. The second entails the examination of the concepts employed in discussion of mental illness, including the experience of mental illness, and the normative questions it raises. The third area concerns the links and <b>discontinuities</b> between the philosophy of mind and psychopathology.|$|E
50|$|A non-persistent <b>discontinuity</b> ends in intact soil or rock. Before {{movement}} of the material {{on both sides of}} a non-persistent <b>discontinuity</b> is possible, the <b>discontinuity</b> has to extend and break through intact material. As intact material has virtually always far higher shear strength than the <b>discontinuity,</b> a non-persistent <b>discontinuity</b> will have larger shear strength than a persistent <b>discontinuity.</b>|$|R
50|$|The shear {{strength}} along a <b>discontinuity</b> in a soil or rock mass in geotechnical engineering {{is governed by}} {{the persistence of the}} <b>discontinuity,</b> roughness of <b>discontinuity</b> surfaces, infill material in the <b>discontinuity,</b> presence and pressure of gasses and fluids (e.g. water, oil), and possible solution (e.g. karst) and cementation along the <b>discontinuity.</b> Further the {{shear strength}} is dependent on whether the <b>discontinuity</b> has moved before in the geological history (i.e. are the asperities on opposing walls of the <b>discontinuity</b> fitting or non-fitting, or have the asperities been sheared off).|$|R
50|$|A {{cemented}} <b>discontinuity</b> or a <b>discontinuity</b> with cemented infill has higher {{shear strength}} than a non-cemented <b>discontinuity</b> if the cement or cemented infill is bonded to both <b>discontinuity</b> walls. Note that cement and cement bounds that {{are stronger than}} the surrounding intact rock ceases the <b>discontinuity</b> to be a mechanical plane of weakness, and, hence, the 'sliding-angle' has no validity.|$|R
5|$|Skorokhod {{function}} {{spaces are}} frequently {{used in the}} theory of stochastic processes because it often assumed that the sample functions of continuous-time stochastic processes belong to a Skorokhod space. Such spaces contain continuous functions, which correspond to sample functions of the Wiener process. But the space also has functions with <b>discontinuities,</b> which means that the sample functions of stochastic processes with jumps, such as the Poisson process (on the real line), are also members of this space.|$|E
5|$|The {{boundary}} of the south polar region {{is marked by a}} pattern of parallel, Y- and V-shaped ridges and valleys. The shape, orientation, and location of these features suggest they are caused by changes in the overall shape of Enceladus. As of 2006 there were two theories for what could cause such a shift in shape: the orbit of Enceladus may have migrated inward, leading to an increase in Enceladus's rotation rate. Such a shift would lead to a more oblate shape; or a rising mass of warm, low-density material in Enceladus's interior may have led to a shift in the position of the current south polar terrain from Enceladus's southern mid-latitudes to its south pole. Consequently, the moon's ellipsoid shape would have adjusted to match the new orientation. One problem of the polar flattening hypothesis is that both polar regions should have similar tectonic deformation histories. However, the north polar region is densely cratered, and has a much older surface age than the south pole. Thickness variations in Enceladus's lithosphere is one explanation for this discrepancy. Variations in lithospheric thickness are supported by the correlation between the Y-shaped <b>discontinuities</b> and the V-shaped cusps along the south polar terrain margin and the relative surface age of the adjacent non-south polar terrain regions. The Y-shaped <b>discontinuities,</b> and the north-south trending tension fractures into which they lead, are correlated with younger terrain with presumably thinner lithospheres. The V-shaped cusps are adjacent to older, more heavily cratered terrains.|$|E
5|$|The {{high-pressure}} injection {{leads to}} a quick fill of the die, which is required so the entire cavity fills before {{any part of the}} casting solidifies. In this way, <b>discontinuities</b> are avoided, even if the shape requires difficult-to-fill thin sections. This creates the problem of air entrapment, because when the mold is filled quickly there is little time for the air to escape. This problem is minimized by including vents along the parting lines, however, even in a highly refined process there will still be some porosity {{in the center of the}} casting.|$|E

50|$|The {{triaxial}} test {{can be used}} to determine the shear strength of a <b>discontinuity.</b> A homogeneous and isotropic sample fails due to shear stresses in the sample. If a sample with a <b>discontinuity</b> is orientated such that the <b>discontinuity</b> is about parallel to the plane in which maximum shear stress will be developed during the test, the sample will fail due to shear displacement along the <b>discontinuity,</b> and hence, the shear strength of a <b>discontinuity</b> can be calculated.|$|R
5|$|In 1828 Alexandre Brongniart's son, the {{botanist}} Adolphe Brongniart, {{published the}} introduction to a longer work {{on the history of}} fossil plants. Adolphe Brongniart concluded that the history of plants could roughly be divided into four parts. The first period was characterized by cryptogams. The second period was characterized by the appearance of the conifers. The third period brought emergence of the cycads, and the fourth by the development of the flowering plants (such as the dicotyledons). The transitions between each of these periods was marked by sharp <b>discontinuities</b> in the fossil record, with more gradual changes within the periods. Brongniart's work is the foundation of paleobotany and reinforced the theory that life on earth had a long and complex history, and different groups of plants and animals made their appearances in successive order. It also supported the idea that the Earth's climate had changed over time as Brongniart concluded that plant fossils showed that during the Carboniferous the climate of Northern Europe must have been tropical.|$|E
5|$|Weaker tornadoes, and {{at times}} even {{stronger}} tornadoes, can occasionally lift, meaning their circulation ceases to affect the ground. The result is an erratic and discontinuous linear damage path, leading to the term skipping tornado. These <b>discontinuities</b> tend to occur over areas larger than the small neighborhoods where the house-skipping effect is observed, except possibly {{at the time of}} the birth and organization of the tornado. This situation is not commonly observed and the term is now rarely applied. Typically, when one tornado weakens and another forms, the process of successive parent mesocyclones forming and decaying is known as cyclic tornadogenesis, thus leading to a series of tornadoes spawned by the same supercell. This series of tornadoes is known as a tornado family.|$|E
5|$|When {{creating}} {{the look of}} the Infected, the art team cycled through various iterations. Some early ideas included the Infected looking like aliens or zombies. The final design was chosen when lead character artist Michael Knowland incorporated images of diseases and fungal growth onto a human. He expressed the difficulty in changing the art from 2D to 3D, which would allow viewing from different angles. The process of sending completed concept art to the lighting and visual effects artists, who re-create the art within the game's engine. Due to the lack of artificial light sources in the game's world, the team was forced to work with natural light. To achieve high quality lighting, they used lightmaps. The use of lightmaps led to various problems, such as the <b>discontinuities</b> in the lighting; this was fixed by slightly modifying the texel intensities. When characters were added to scenes, they initially looked out of place; the addition of a shadow generally fixed this.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{mechanical}} properties of <b>discontinuity</b> {{are different from}} those of a whole rock. And the shear strength of <b>discontinuity</b> is closely related to its morphological characteristics. The study of the mechanism of failure of jointed rock mass under shear stress is to reveal its mechanical behavior and its mechanism of failure. This paper presents a fundamental research in the {{mechanical properties}} of the regular jugged <b>discontinuity</b> under various normal stresses in the shear test. And it describes the mechanical properties of the regular jugged <b>discontinuity</b> under shear stress and their principal regularities. The strength and roughness of <b>discontinuity</b> under shear stress are investigated by the analysis of the data obtained. And this paper study the calculation of shear stiffness of <b>discontinuity</b> and proposed an empirical formula between the slope ratio and roughness coefficient of <b>discontinuity.</b> Also the changing regularity of the parameters of the shear strength of <b>discontinuity</b> under shear stress is investigated, and an empirical formula is developed to evaluate the shear strength of <b>discontinuity</b> in this paper...|$|R

40|$|The {{available}} {{experimental data}} and steady-state calculations {{make it difficult}} to explain the M <b>discontinuity</b> beneath both oceans and continents {{on the basis of the}} same phase change. The oceanic M <b>discontinuity</b> may be a chemical <b>discontinuity</b> between basalt and peridotite, and a similar chemical <b>discontinuity</b> may thus be expected beneath the continents. Since available experimental data place the basalt-eclogite phase change at about the same depth as the continental M <b>discontinuity,</b> intersections may exist between a zone of chemical <b>discontinuity</b> and a phase transition zone, the transition being either basalt-eclogite or feldspathic peridotite-garnet peridotite. Detection of the latter transition by seismic techniques may be difficult. The M <b>discontinuity</b> could therefore represent the basalt-eclogite phase change in some localities (e. g. mountain belts) and the chemical <b>discontinuity</b> in others (e. g. oceans and continental shields). Variations in the depth to the chemical <b>discontinuity</b> and in the positions of geoisotherms produce great flexibility in orogenetic models. Intersections between the two zones at depth could be reflected at the surface by major fault zones separating large structural blocks of different elevations...|$|R

This has several consequences: For example, the unambiguous relation between energy and momentum of an electronic state is broken and an electronic band structure is formed.

Hence, an ACAR measurement on a solid with completely filled bands (i.e. on an insulator) gives a continuous distribution. An ACAR measurement on a metal has <b>discontinuities</b> where bands cross the Fermi level in all Brillouin zones in reciprocal space.
