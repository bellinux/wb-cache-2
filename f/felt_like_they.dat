25|$|Another {{experiment}} {{involved an}} electronic ouija board where the device's movements were manipulated by the experimenter, while {{the participant was}} led to believe they were entirely self-conducted. The experimenter stopped the device on occasions and asked the participant how much they themselves <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> wanted to stop. The participant also listened to words in headphones; and {{it was found that}} if experimenter stopped next to an object that came through the headphones {{they were more likely to}} say they wanted to stop there. If the participant perceived having the thought at the time of the action, then it was assigned as intentional. It was concluded that a strong illusion of perception of causality requires; priority (we assume the thought must precede the action), consistency (the thought is about the action), and exclusivity (no other apparent causes or alternative hypotheses).|$|E
500|$|During the {{flashing}} scene, Carell told Flannery that he [...] "wasn't staring at" [...] her breasts, rather, {{he was looking}} at her clavicle. Despite what it appears on camera, Flannery was not completely topless, as she was wearing pasties. The scene was shot several times; Flannery admitted that the shooting was excruiating and it <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> had been shooting the one scene for [...] "14 hours". To preserve Flannery's modesty, the series' monitors were shut off and the memory card for the digital camera was removed. Carell actually took pictures during the Christmas party shoot. All of the photos were released online.|$|E
500|$|The film's {{effects were}} conflictingly appraised. Schickel {{wrote that the}} effects were [...] "technically adroit" [...] and {{occasionally}} [...] "witty", and Ebert singled out the Bird of Prey as a [...] "great-looking" [...] ship. Sterritt felt that the settings always <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> were on soundstages rather than out in space, and Denby wrote that more {{could have been done}} with Genesis, and that while it was an interesting concept its special effects execution was lacking. Kempley appreciated the sets' low values, writing that [...] "the fakier the sets", the closer the film felt to its television origins.|$|E

500|$|His {{portrayal}} in The Movie {{has also}} received praise: IGN's Andy Patrizio said that Spike [...] "opens up his soul a little" [...] during the film, while Chris Beveridge of Mania.com found Spike more likable {{in the film}} than {{in some parts of}} the series, comparing him to Lupin III and praising the moments where he could be himself and show more of his inner self. Carlos Ross of THEM Anime Review said that Spike's portrayal was one of the things that worked in the film, and DVD Talk's Neil Lumbard, alongside general praise of the characters, positively noted the further exploration of his personality. Anime News Network's Mike Crandol was less enthusiastic, saying that while Spike was the only one who got much attention during the film, some sequences <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> could work without him.|$|E

50|$|An unwelcome side-effect of {{the modern}} {{lightweight}} materials used on these and all later models was that the handsets were too light. Not only did they not reliably hold down the tiny micro-switch, which now served as the switchhook, but users {{did not like the}} feel of them. <b>They</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> 'toys'. <b>They</b> lacked 'gravitas'. This was addressed by the simple inclusion of a steel bar in the handle of the handset to give it weight and make it feel a 'serious' piece of equipment. The telephones could be desk or wall mounted without any modification.|$|R
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Freedom" [...] was {{directed}} by Sean De Sparengo, and filmed in London in July 2011. It took one day to film, and is primarily set in an underground club with red lighting, reminiscent of that featured in the group's 2002 single [...] "Freak like Me". De Sparengo commented on the concept and visual attributes of the video, saying: [...] "One {{of the interesting things}} for the concept for this video is that we knew we had to make everything look incredibly beautiful. It was about making a video where the Sugababes <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> were {{at the top of their}} game." [...] The video made its premiere in August 2011. A [...] clip was uploaded to the Sugababes official VEVO channel on YouTube. Daily Mirror praised the band's appearance in the video.|$|E

500|$|Although Atkinson {{initially}} gave {{a public}} apology, {{and stated that}} the declaration was [...] "wholly indefensible", he later suggested that he thought Somerset were victims of a kangaroo court, and that the meeting had happened at a point when the topic was still very emotive and people were [...] "baying for blood". Kerslake, the chairman, offered to resign, while Rose considered similar, but ultimately both continued in their roles. The Somerset players, who <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> were being treated like criminals by the press, were concerned about what sort of reception they would get at their next match; a home fixture against Hampshire. They need not have worried; the team were cheered onto the pitch, while Rose was given an individual standing ovation when he batted. A few supporters at the match hung out a banner stating [...] "It's Brian Rose I do declare!".|$|E
50|$|The {{previous}} {{representation of}} the LGBT community in Vietnam was almost non-existent and Maika {{wanted to make sure}} they were depicted as real people.

60|$|Thus, {{at various}} points {{along the coast of}} New England, there were {{communities}} of Englishmen.

Perhaps their feelings of brotherhood were the stronger because different nations had formed settlements to the north and to the south. In Canada and Nova Scotia were colonies of French.

The band chose Danton Supple, who mixed the bulk of A Rush of Blood to the Head, to oversee the {{production}} of X. When January went, the band had to finish the album; they were conscious of the pressure as [...] "expectations for the record grew larger" [...] and [...] "completing it became tougher and tougher". Finally, the band was settled with the song [...] "Square One", which Martin has described as [...] "a call to arms" [...] and a [...] "plea" [...] {{to each of them}} [...] "not to be intimidated by anything or anyone else".

These included many locations throughout the United States and also included China. [...] "It was a lot of travel in a very short period of time. And they had to get this thing edited and cut starting in January, and ready to screen in May. That’s like a seriously tight schedule.

500|$|Gabe Graziani of GameSpy {{praised the}} presentation, {{saying that it}} {{contained}} a [...] "stunning amount of graphical flair" [...] {{as well as a}} smooth framerate, and summarised that it updated the PSP titles Wipeout Pure and Wipeout Pulse to HD [...] "magnificently". Jesse Costantino of Game Revolution said that Wipeout HD [...] "joins an elite class of current-gen racers" [...] due to its 1080p visuals and a nearly constant 60 frames per second. Costantino also praised the richly detailed environments of the race tracks, stating that he <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> [...] "exist in a real world". Frédéric Goyon of Jeuxvideo.com said Wipeout HD was atypically a [...] "high flying achievement" [...] regarding its visuals, and also thought the combined colour choices made it a visually unique racing game. Ryan Davis from Giant Bomb praised the game's transition to HD, stating that he wondered how the Wipeout series [...] "made do" [...] without 1080p visuals prior to the release of Wipeout HD. In addition, Davis also commended the ship design and [...] "rock solid" [...] framerate. Terry Terrones of GamePro said that the game was visually stunning, but also implied that it was [...] "essentially a pig with lipstick".|$|E

500|$|HitFix writer Alan Sepinwall {{declared}} [...] "Flu Season" [...] the {{one episode}} he would suggest to newcomers seeking {{to become familiar}} with Parks and Recreation because it spotlights so many different characters, includes both warm and comedic moments, and includes commentary on small town government. He praised the performances of Lowe and Poehler, the latter of whom was especially effective because there were real stakes to Leslie making her presentation. Matt Fowler of IGN also said Lowe's character, which he feared would get old fast, had proven to be a strong asset to the show, and Ann's character was at her strongest opposite him. But Fowler also said [...] "Flu Season" [...] was a strong ensemble with great character moments for everyone, including Ron and Andy's bonding and Ben's admiration of Leslie. The A.V. Club writer Steve Heisler said [...] "Flu Season" [...] gave the entire cast the chance to be a bit sillier than usual and demonstrate their wide comedic ranges. Heisler said Ben and Chris <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> belonged among the other characters, and he praised the performance of Aubrey Plaza, claiming April's character seemed more fleshed out than in past episodes.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the major}} criticisms of the game stemmed from a {{disparity}} between the emotional thrust {{of the story and}} the actions of the player, with GameTrailers' Justin Speer pointing out that while the story attempted to characterise Lara Croft as vulnerable and uncomfortable with killing, the player was encouraged to engage enemies aggressively and use brutal tactics to earn more experience points. Speer felt that this paradoxical approach ultimately let the game down as it undermined Lara's character {{to the point where he}} found it difficult to identify with her at all. IGN's Keza MacDonald also highlighted the issue, but was less critical of it than Speer, pointing out that both Lara and the player had to adapt quickly to killing in order to survive. However, Game Informers Matt Miller noted that the game offered the player several options for progressing through its combat situations, and that the player could avoid open conflict entirely if they chose to do so. He also praised the behaviour and presence of the enemies for the way they <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> had actual tasks to perform on the island, rather than being clusters of polygons whose only function was to be killed by the player in order for them to progress. While on the subject of character development, GamesRadar's Ryan Taljonick expressed that the supporting characters were underdeveloped relative to Lara Croft, describing them as [...] "pretty generic characters who, while rarely annoying, just aren't memorable".|$|E
500|$|Sunsoft was not {{interested}} in the game for PC, and was instead focused on the video game console market. At the time, consoles had no hard drives and small memory buffers, meaning the game had to be designed around these technical constraints. To solve this issue, they compartmentalized parts of the game's environments into the different Ages. The Millers decided that most people did not like puzzles. Thus, a good puzzle would feel familiar and part of the world—not like a puzzle, but something for players to figure out like a circuit breaker in their house, using observation and common sense. Cyan did not have fans to please, and did not know exactly who the game would appeal to; Robyn <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> did not have to second-guess their choices and could [...] "explore the world as we were designing" [...] and build a game for themselves. In a 2016 interview, Rand Miller stated that they strived to design the puzzles in Myst and their subsequent games by trying to balance three aspects: the puzzles themselves, the environment, and the story. Rand also stated they {{wanted to make sure that}} clues to the solutions to puzzles were apparent and presented to the player in a manner for these connections to be made: [...] "once the player finds the solution, if they blame us, then we haven’t done a good job. But if they blame themselves, then we have." ...|$|E

There are some people who the same things happen to them again and again. They never learn [...] When I left, there was all that rubbish about it getting too much for me [...] I stopped because I wasn't being used very much. I thought, 'It's a part-time job'. It wasn't being written properly. Instead of finding the gossip and passing it on, [...] [...] was living on a reputation. [...] said to me, 'I loved it when [...] had [...] varicose veins.' I thought: 'What?! That was in 1985, it's 1993!'. I was getting so tetchy, so I thought I'd go. I'd had enough. They were a bit shocked, because apparently there were some good stories coming up." [...] Expanding on this in 2008, Brown stated that she [...] "didn’t like what they were doing with Dot– she was meant to spread the gossip. Originally she was a fountain of knowledge then next thing I know, people are telling Dot what had been happening and I thought, ‘No, this just won’t do’. I was very annoyed, I <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> had completely changed my character."

This younger-skewing content was continued with the comedy series Marvel's New Warriors ordered in April 2017, with Freeform executive Karey Burke saying, Marvel [...] "started to see our strength with young adults and together we could create a pipeline for content that was specific to our audience that felt younger than what they're doing at the other channels... It was important {{to both of us}} to find the right characters that <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> would speak directly to Freeform's audience. The Avengers wouldn't work here but the about-to-be-Avengers works here." [...] Loeb noted that it was [...] "exciting" [...] to Marvel [...] "to be able to explore the world of the hero and how it affects someone who {{is trying to figure out}} who they are as opposed to already knows who they are and now their whole life has to take a left. That's the journey we're going on with these kinds of characters" [...] in Cloak & Dagger, New Warriors and Hulu's Runaways.

500|$|Alpha {{was reached}} in December 2000. Multiplayer mode nearly {{had to be}} dropped for this to happen, but the {{problems}} were fixed just in time. Electronic Arts {{became involved in the}} production; testers were employed (they found three thousand bugs), localisations were checked, and a marketing campaign was launched. Fearing the bugs could kill the game, lists were sent to every member of the team, who had a chart, updated daily. The biggest problem was the final set, and fixing them created more bugs. Molyneux commented that [...] "It was as if the game just didn't want to be finished and perfected", and remarked that the team <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> had run a marathon after fixing the bugs. The end product was so large that they [...] "almost felt lost within the code" [...] which consisted of over a million lines, and took over an hour to compile. The music, dialogue, and sound effects were compressed to fit on one CD, as they took five times as much space as the game. People not involved with the game's development began playing it and were extremely impressed. The release date was then set at 23 February 2001. Electronic Arts complained that the age at which the villagers were reproducing was below the age of consent for some countries, so this had to be changed. Lionhead announced that the game went gold (became ready to be released) on 16 March 2001. Molyneux credited fans for making the hardest times worthwhile. Because players encountered technical issues, rumours that Electronic Arts had shipped beta versions circulated; Lionhead denied them. Molyneux said Black & White was the most important and difficult game he had made. In June, a patch that fixed bugs was released. The Japanese version was released on 24 May 2001, and re-released as Black & White Special Edition under the EA Best Selections branding on 18 March 2004. Another patch was released, which would allow the Hand to be controlled by an Essential Reality P5 Glove, a virtual reality glove.|$|E
