5|$|By {{contrast}} the Russian forces' morale was extremely high. The Russian commanders had ample experience in siege operations; Paskevich <b>himself</b> <b>had</b> captured {{at least six}} fortified cities in his career, including the capture of Erevan and Abbas-Abbad Fortress in the Russo-Persian War of 1826 and the battle of Akhalzic and siege of Kars during the Russo-Turkish War of 1828.|$|E
5|$|Dazzle {{attracted}} {{the notice of}} artists such as Picasso, who claimed that Cubists like <b>himself</b> <b>had</b> invented it. Edward Wadsworth, who supervised the camouflaging of over 2,000 ships during the First World War, painted a series of canvases of dazzle ships after the war, based on his wartime work. Arthur Lismer similarly painted a series of dazzle ship canvases.|$|E

5|$|Gandhi {{seemed to}} have {{influenced}} him with certain moral principles, though Gandhi <b>himself</b> <b>had</b> been influenced by The Kingdom of God Is Within You, a nonviolent classic written by Christian anarchist Leo Tolstoy. In turn, both Gandhi and Martin Luther King had read Tolstoy, and King, Gandhi and Tolstoy had been strongly influenced by Jesus' Sermon on the Mount. King quoted Tolstoy's War and Peace in 1959.|$|E
5|$|In May 1366, {{as a final}} sign {{of royal}} gratitude, King Edward had Edington elected Archbishop of Canterbury. Edington, however, {{declined}} {{on the grounds of}} failing health.

5|$|Ludwig Metzger {{had been}} trying to promote his {{proposal}} for a film on the life of Joseph Süß Oppenheimer since as early as 1921 but without any success. The publication of Feuchtwanger's book and Mendes' film adaptation of it irritated Metzger because he <b>himself</b> <b>had</b> been incubating the idea for many years.|$|E
5|$|Saint Francis of Assisi is {{credited}} with creating the first live nativity scene in 1223 in order to cultivate the worship of Christ.

The scene's popularity inspired communities throughout Catholic countries to stage similar pantomimes.|$|E

5|$|The {{area that}} is now Providence was first settled in June 1636 by Roger Williams {{and was one of}} the {{original}} Thirteen Colonies of the United States.

5|$|After eight years, Fetter {{returned}} to academia and finally completed his B.A. in 1891. In 1892, Jeremiah W. Jenks—who had taught Fetter at Indiana University—acquired a teaching position at Cornell University {{at the new}} President White School of History and Political Science and subsequently secured a fellowship for Fetter at that institution. Fetter completed his Master of Philosophy degree the same year. Jenks then convinced Fetter to study, as Jenks <b>himself</b> <b>had,</b> under Johannes Conrad at the Sorbonne in Paris, France. Fetter earned his Ph.D. in 1894 from the University of Halle in Germany, where he wrote his doctoral dissertation, a critique of Malthusian population theory.|$|E

5|$|After {{returning}} from his war service, Keenor met Muriel Griffiths, a church organist from Swansea {{who had worked}} in a munitions factory during the First World War. They were married soon after they met, on 11 November 1919, and they had their first child, Frederick, in May 1920. The couple {{would go on to}} have seven children together, their final child Graham being born in 1931. He settled his family in Whitchurch, Cardiff, in a house that he <b>himself</b> <b>had</b> designed and helped build, and became a keen gardener, growing his own vegetables in the garden.|$|E
5|$|Although Jordan <b>himself</b> <b>had</b> promised only {{a single}} book, {{according}} to Sanderson neither Jordan's widow nor Doherty believed he could achieve this. Sanderson claimed {{that he could not}} do the story and characters justice with a single volume, so a split was inevitable. The decision was made to split the final book into three separate volumes, rather than two, so that a reasonably sized and unfractured volume could be released at the promised November 2009 date. Sanderson has stated that had the book remained as a single volume, {{it would not have been}} able to be released before November 2011, and likely would have been so large (around 2,000 pages) that it would be unpublishable.|$|E
5|$|By 1990, Moffat {{had written}} two series of Press Gang, but the programme's high cost along with {{organisational}} changes at Central cast its future in doubt. As Moffat wondered {{what to do}} next and worried about his future employment, Bob Spiers, Press Gangs primary director, suggested that he meet with producer Andre Ptaszynski to discuss writing a sitcom. Moffat's father had been a headteacher and Moffat <b>himself</b> <b>had</b> taught English before writing Press Gang, so his initial proposal was a programme similar to what would become Chalk, a series that eventually aired in 1997.|$|E

5|$|Edward did {{not have}} much to do with any of this; after around 1375 he played a limited role in the {{government}} of the realm. Around 29 September 1376 he fell ill with a large abscess. After a brief period of recovery in February 1377, the king died of a stroke at Sheen on 21 June. He was succeeded by his ten-year-old grandson, King Richard II, son of the Black Prince, since the Black Prince <b>himself</b> <b>had</b> died on 8 June 1376.|$|E
5|$|Ferb was {{originally}} {{going to be}} voiced by actor Mitchel Musso. However, when Phineas and Ferb was picked up as a full series, Povenmire and Marsh chose to make Ferb British and cast Thomas Sangster as his voice. However, they enjoyed Musso to a level that they recast him {{as the voice of}} the character Jeremy Johnson; although Musso no longer voices a title character, his new role allows him more lines. Sangster himself is a British actor and was among several cast members hired that hailed from England. Marsh <b>himself</b> <b>had</b> lived in the country for seven years and developed a fondness for the culture and people.|$|E
