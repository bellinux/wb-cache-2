5|$|En Liten Hushålls-Cateches {{came out}} in 1800 and was only 43 pages long. In her last book Rückerschöld {{repeated}} her previous stances {{about the importance of}} knowing household skills, and that girls should be allowed to partake in household work from an early age rather than being pampered and taught impractical skills. While stressing that a woman's God-given station was in the home and that she should be accustomed to humility and obedience, she also encouraged women to take matters in their own hands; the lack of household education could only be alleviated by sharing information and passing on knowledge <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>generation</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other.|$|E
5|$|In {{her book}} {{column for the}} Detroit Free Press, Marta Salij said that Cal's {{identity}} crisis resembles Odysseus's fate. Whereas the mythical hero is troubled by Poseidon and succored by Athena, the intersex protagonist is affected by his chromosomes in a similar manner. John Sykes, professor of English and religion education, noted another Greek-hero reference. In {{a manner similar to}} Oedipus's fulfillment of Pythia's prophecy to slay his father and marry his mother, Callie validates the prediction her grandmother made before her birth by adopting a male identity. Eugenides also used the allusions to Greek mythology and modern pop music to show the passing of familial traits and idiosyncrasies <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>generation</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> next.|$|E
5|$|Nomadic {{hunter-gatherer}} societies passed on, by oral tradition, {{what they}} knew (their empirical observations) about {{the different kinds of}} plants that they used for food, shelter, poisons, medicines, for ceremonies and rituals etc. The uses of plants by these pre-literate societies influenced the way the plants were named and classifiedtheir uses were embedded in folk-taxonomies, the way they were grouped according to use in everyday communication. The nomadic life-style was drastically changed when settled communities were established in about twelve centres around the world during the Neolithic Revolution which extended from about 10,000 to 2500 years ago depending on the region. With these communities came the development of the technology and skills needed for the domestication of plants and animals and the emergence of the written word provided evidence for the passing of systematic knowledge and culture <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>generation</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> next.|$|E

5|$|An {{association}} with the folliculin (FLCN) gene was first reported in 2002. This 14-exon gene {{is located on the}} short arm of chromosome 17 (17p11.2) and has a cytosine-rich region in exon 11 particularly susceptible to mutation. The most common mutation in this region is the insertion or deletion of a cytosine residue, found in 53% of Birt–Hogg–Dubé families. There is {{no significant difference in the}} symptoms experienced by families with an insertion at that location compared to those who have a deletion. However, mutations in FLCN associated with Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome are heterogeneous, and are often nonsense mutations or frameshift mutations that cause early truncation of the protein product at the carboxy-terminus. Very rarely, missense mutations are observed. Mutations are often passed <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>generation</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> next in an autosomal dominant fashion but can occur as a new mutation in an individual with no prior family history (a de novo mutation). The children of an affected parent each have a 50% chance of having the disease. Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome has very high penetrance. A correlation between different FLCN genotypes and phenotypes has not been discovered.|$|E
5|$|Heritable {{traits are}} passed <b>from</b> <b>one</b> <b>generation</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> next via DNA, a {{molecule}} that encodes genetic information. DNA {{is a long}} biopolymer composed of four types of bases. The sequence of bases along a particular DNA molecule specify the genetic information, {{in a manner similar}} to a sequence of letters spelling out a sentence. Before a cell divides, the DNA is copied, so that each of the resulting two cells will inherit the DNA sequence. Portions of a DNA molecule that specify a single functional unit are called genes; different genes have different sequences of bases. Within cells, the long strands of DNA form condensed structures called chromosomes. The specific location of a DNA sequence within a chromosome is known as a locus. If the DNA sequence at a locus varies between individuals, the different forms of this sequence are called alleles. DNA sequences can change through mutations, producing new alleles. If a mutation occurs within a gene, the new allele may affect the trait that the gene controls, altering the phenotype of the organism. However, while this simple correspondence between an allele and a trait works in some cases, most traits are more complex and are controlled by quantitative trait loci (multiple interacting genes).|$|E

25|$|Studies of Paramecium {{have contributed}} to our {{understanding}} of the function of meiosis. Like all ciliates, Paramecium has a polyploid macronucleus, and one or more diploid micronuclei.
