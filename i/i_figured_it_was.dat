500|$|In June 2000, Killswitch Engage {{released}} {{their debut}} album, titled Killswitch Engage through Ferret Records. The band got its recording deal {{as a favor}} for the artwork bassist Mike D'Antonio created for Ferret. The label's CEO, Carl Severson signed the band without a contract simply to get the album {{out to the public}} because he thought the album [...] "ruled", and stated [...] "I had a one-off deal and when I knew they wanted to go someplace bigger, <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> in my best interest, as their friend, to make the best thing happen for them." [...] After the album was released, Severson showed it to Roadrunner Records A man, Mike Gitter.|$|E
500|$|Eve was {{contracted}} {{to appear in}} two episodes of Glee, having been offered the role of Grace after Whitney Houston declined to appear. Discussing her casting, Eve stated: [...] "I got asked and I'd heard the buzz about the show. When the first pilot episode came out, <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> something different and something we haven't seen on TV before. I didn't want to turn it down!" [...] She commented {{that she would have}} loved to have seen Whitney Houston appear in the show, explaining: [...] "I think it would've been different in a sense because she's an original diva. She would've brought a whole other energy, which would've been amazing." [...] Comparing her character Grace to McKinley High glee director Will, Eve explained: [...] "For me especially, I come from a harder place. I'm the teacher of a reform school. I'm used to being very strict." [...] Asked if she would return to the show in the future, she replied: [...] "If I'm asked to do it, I definitely would. It's just a really well-made, smart show." [...] Though she does not sing in [...] "Hairography", Eve commented that she would like to do so if she returned to Glee in the future, naming [...] "Sweet Dreams" [...] by Eurythmics as her ideal song choice.|$|E
500|$|In June 2003, Gravel gave {{a speech}} on direct {{democracy}} at a conference hosted by the American Free Press. The event was cosponsored by the Barnes Review, a journal that endorses Holocaust denial. In the wake of criticism for his appearance, Gravel has said repeatedly {{that he does not}} share such a view, stating, [...] "You better believe I know that six million Jews were killed. I've been to the Holocaust Museum. I've seen the footage of General Eisenhower touring one of the camps. They're [...] nutty as loons if they don't think it happened". The newspaper had intended to interview Gravel about the National Initiative. Gravel later recounted the background to the event:"He [...] liked the idea of the National Initiative. <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> an opportunity to discuss it. Whether it is the far right, far left, whatever, I'll make my pitch to them. They gave me a free subscription to American Free Press. They still send it to me today. I flip through it sometimes. It has some extreme views, {{and a lot of the}} ads in it are even more extreme and make me want to upchuck. Anyways, sometime later, Carto contacted me to speak at that Barnes Review Conference. I had never heard of the Barnes Review, didn't know anything about it or what they stood for. I was just coming to give a presentation about the National Initiative. I was there maybe 30 minutes. I could tell from the people in the room (mainly some very old men) that they were pretty extreme. I gave my speech, answered some questions and left. I never saw the agenda for the day or listened to any of the other presentations." ...|$|E

2500|$|The show {{became known}} as [...] "Jiggle TV" [...] and [...] "T TV" [...] (or [...] "Tits & Ass Television") by critics who {{believed}} that the show had no intelligence or substance. These characterizations stemmed {{from the fact that}} the lead actresses frequently dressed scantily or provocatively as part of their undercover characters (including roller derby girl, beauty pageant contestant, maid, female prisoner, or just bikini-clad), and the belief that their clothing was a means of attracting viewers. Farrah Fawcett once attributed the show's success to this fact: [...] "When the show was number three, <b>I</b> <b>figured</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> our acting. When it got to be number one, I decided it could only be because none of us wears a bra." ...|$|E

5000|$|On August 31, 2004 {{the second}} volume titled Volume 2: Progressive Stupidity was released, and like Volume 1, {{contains}} two discs (labelled discs 3 and 4).
