50|$|The CFDT's main role is {{to market}} Chad's cotton on the world market, while private banks provide the credits {{necessary}} to Cotontchad and to the peasants to finance the opening of each planting season and especially to provide capital for the import and <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>fertilisers</b> and insecticides. Originally the producers were protected from market fluctuations by the Cotton Price Stabilization Board (Caisse de Stabilisation des Prix du Coton or CSPC), created in 1968, whose task was to stabilise prices paid to peasant producers by funding operating losses incurred by Cotontchad. Assuring a constant price to the producer not only helped maintain {{a certain level of}} production for Cotontchad but also limited costs to the company by holding down producer prices. But the recession that hit the cotton market between 1991 and 1993 drastically reduced the activities of the company and led to the abolition of the CSPC in 1993 and the decision to let the prices of the cotton bought by the producers fluctuate freely, following the market. Notwithstanding, economic difficulties have continued to hamper the company to the point that its privatisation is often discussed.|$|E

The <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> the mass flow has been studied for three fertilisers. Our findings show that the horizontal and vertical <b>distributions</b> <b>of</b> the mass flow are similar for ammonium nitrate and NPK, while they are different for KCl. For each fertiliser, the horizontal distributions deduced from impact records are in accordance with results deduced from a traditional compartmented ring.

40|$|Chemical {{fertilisers}} are {{key element}} of modern technology and have {{played an important role}} in agricultural productivity growth in India. However, the demand-supply gap <b>of</b> <b>fertilisers</b> in India has increased in recent times, thereby leading to increased dependency on imports. Indian imports, which were about 2 million tonnes in early part of 2000, increased to 10. 2 million tonnes <b>of</b> <b>fertilisers</b> in 2008 - 09. In view <b>of</b> importance <b>of</b> <b>fertilisers</b> in agricultural growth and the possibility of an emerging demand-supply gap, there is need to forecast future demand. The paper begins with an overview <b>of</b> <b>fertiliser</b> consumption trends and then identifies important determinants <b>of</b> <b>fertiliser</b> demand and develops projects demand scenarios for fertilisers in India in 2020 - 21. India is the second largest consumer <b>of</b> <b>fertilisers</b> in the world after China, consuming about 26. 5 million tonnes. However, average intensity <b>of</b> <b>fertiliser</b> use in India remains much lower than most countries in the world but is highly skewed, with wide inter-regional, inter-state, and inter-district variations. The results show that non-price factors such as irrigation, high yielding varieties, were more important than price factors in influencing demand for <b>fertilisers.</b> <b>Of</b> the two price policy instruments, affordable fertiliser prices and higher agricultural commodity prices, the former is more powerful in influencing fertiliser demand. The paper suggests that in order to ensure self-sufficiency in agricultural production in the country, availability <b>of</b> <b>fertilisers</b> at affordable prices should be prioritized over higher output prices. By 2020, fertiliser demand in the country is projected to increase to about 41. 6 million tones and is expected to grow at a faster rate in eastern and southern region compared with north and west. To meet the increasing <b>fertiliser</b> requirements <b>of</b> the country, a conducive and stable policy environment, availability of raw materials, capital resources, and price incentives will play a critical role. ...|$|R

40|$|Greater use of {{technology}} to assist aerial application <b>of</b> <b>fertiliser</b> will be <b>of</b> benefit to the topdressing industry and farmers. Benefits arise through automating the fertiliser flow control system; reducing off target fertiliser application, and managing fertiliser inputs based on the potential outputs of the farmland; thus increasing the profitability of hill country farming systems. A case for technology assisted application is developed by investigating the field performance of conventional and enhanced flow control systems {{and the effect of}} variable rate application on hill country pasture production. A single particle model that predicts flight trajectory from the particle force balance based on the aircraft groundspeed, axial and tangential propeller wash, wind characteristics and particle properties including sphericity was developed. Model predictions were compared to predictions from AGDISP 8. 15. Results and trends were similar. The single particle ballistics model described above was extended to predict the lateral <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>fertiliser</b> after release from an aircraft. To achieve this, two parameters are important, the transverse flow profile of material leaving the hopper gatebox and the sphericity of the particles. Techniques for measuring these parameters are described and experimental results are presented for superphosphate. These data were used in the model to predict the lateral distribution pattern from a Gippsland Aeronautics 200 C for a known discharge mass, which was compared to a measured pattern from the same aircraft for the same discharge mass. Good agreement between the shapes <b>of</b> the two <b>distributions</b> was found. The transverse distribution model provides a practical tool for optimising the design of spreaders, or optimum particle characteristics for a given spreader. It has the ability to predict the <b>distribution</b> profile <b>of</b> any particle size distribution from each, or all, of the spreader ducts. Culmination of the single particle and transverse distribution models {{led to the development of}} a deposition footprint model that was capable of predicting field application within a 25 ha trial site. The deposition footprint model was embedded inside a geographical information system and comparisons were made between the actual and predicted deposition across a series of transect lines. Good agreement was found. Following this, a comparison of the predicted field performance between an automated and manual control system were made. Economic benefits for a single application of superphosphate were identified through using automated control, where 10 % less fertiliser was applied outside of the application zone when compared to the manually operated system. This equated to a net benefit of NZD $ 2800 for a 1500 ha hill country farming system. The value of improving the performance of a topdressing aircraft, on an industry level, was also examined. Cost/benefit analysis between a manual and automated system revealed a benefit of NZD $ 111, 700 yr- 1 for a single topdressing aircraft using the automated system. The economic impact of Variable Rate Application Technology (VRAT) is examined, using Limestone Downs as an example. The spatially explicit decision tree modelling technique was used to predict the annual pasture production over the entire Limestone Downs property. The resulting decision tree classes tended to follow the farm's digital elevation model. A series <b>of</b> six different <b>fertiliser</b> application scenarios were developed for comparison to a base line scenario using conventional aerial application techniques. VRAT outperformed the fixed rate applications in terms of pasture production and fertiliser utilisation. Full variable rate application and a model optimised prescription map, produced the highest annual pasture yield. Variable rate techniques were predicted to increase annual production and the spatial variability of that production. An economic analysis of the six production scenarios was undertaken. Farm cash surplus was calculated for each scenario and clearly revealed the benefits of using variable rate application technology. VRAT was found to be the most efficient and highest returning application method per hectare. Additional costs and increased charge-out rates were likely to occur under VRAT; nevertheless, the analysis indicated that significant financial incentives were available to the farmer. A sensitivity analysis revealed that even with a 20 % increase in charge-out rate associated with VRAT, the farm's annual cash position varied by only $ 4500 (0. 4 %), suggesting the cost of implementing such a system is not prohibitive and would allow aircraft operators to add value to their services...|$|R

40|$|The study {{examines}} how {{a combination of}} socio-economic and household factors influences farm household decisions on soil nutrient management and on crop production in two regions of Kenya (Kiambu and Vihiga). It further examines how these decisions impact on household objectives and on productivity. Emphasis {{is given to the}} use <b>of</b> inorganic <b>fertilisers</b> because {{this is one of the}} major sources of nutrients that hold considerable potential for increased productivity. A cross-sectional household level data set collected through a formal survey using pre-tested structured questionnaires is used for the investigations. Various methodological approaches are employed including descriptive statistics, cluster analysis, the dual and primal approach to analysing the farm production, and mathematical programming. Cluster analysis yielded three household types in each of the two regions, and these household types form the basis for further analysis. The most important crops to the households in Kiambu are maize, potatoes and kale, as identified through farmer perception and restricted activity profit ranking. In Vihiga maize and beans remains the sole most important combination. Demand for fertiliser is price elastic with own price elasticity of - 2. 44 in Kiambu and - 1. 88 in Vihiga. Output prices of maize and of kale in Kiambu, and of maize in Vihiga also significantly influence the demand for <b>fertiliser</b> with elasticities <b>of</b> 0. 90, 0. 28 and 1. 58 respectively. In Kiambu, fertiliser price has very low elasticities on crop outputs, particularly of kale, which would seem to imply that fertiliser does not have a big impact on crop production. However, results fiom the primal approach show that currently labour is the constraining factor, particularly in kale production, making the impact <b>of</b> <b>fertiliser</b> obscure. In fact, increasing the level <b>of</b> <b>fertiliser</b> use will have a substantial impact on the output of all the crops analysed, in both the regions. The results confirm previous observations that households are using much lower levels <b>of</b> <b>fertiliser</b> than is optimal. If the market price <b>of</b> <b>fertiliser</b> and <b>of</b> the outputs is considered, the results show that households could profitably increase their level <b>of</b> <b>fertiliser</b> use on all the crops examined. However, the households' shadow price <b>of</b> <b>fertiliser</b> is much higher than the market price implying that households consider other costs that we do not observe e. g. credit constraints. ResuIts fiom mathematical programming confirm that households are liquidity constrained. The level of the credit constraint varies across the different household types based on the level of their extemal remittances relative to farm size.
