We looked at them and they looked at us. They were just kids, 19 years old, like us. But in uniform. Like our boys in Vietnam.|$|E
500|$|At the {{suggestion}} of manager Lenny Poncher and Hassinger, The Electric Prunes agreed to record a concept album that integrated Gregorian music into psychedelic pop, with the belief it would launch them into commercial success. Poncher recruited David Axelrod, a formally neo-classically trained musician, to compose all of the material for the project. The result, Mass in F Minor, was a complex arrangement of religious-based rock, which was sung entirely in Latin. Although the band did record the songs [...] "Kyrie Eleison", [...] "Gloria", and [...] "Credo", the intricate orchestration proved to be too difficult and time-consuming for the group. As a consequence, Hassinger enlisted the Canadian group, The Collectors, among other session musicians, in completing the album, although Lowe, Tulin, and Weakley did contribute to every track. Mass in F Minor was released in January 1968 and reached number 135 on the Billboard 200. An eerie version of the opening track, [...] "Kyrie Eleison", became somewhat of an underground favorite when it appeared in the soundtrack for the counterculture film, Easy Rider. The Electric Prunes performed with the new songs in concert just once, at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium, which Tulin described: [...] "From the outset the performance was a disaster. We missed the intro on the first song and it never got any better. Amp speakers blew, charts fell off music stands and everyone was, in general, in a complete state of confusion. Ended up each song turned into one long jam. I think we were, at times, {{all in the same}} key. <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> over to the four celli and four French horns and told them to 'jam in E.' Somehow we would hit a break and James would manage a vocal". As a result of financial and musical issues, Weakley and Lowe left the group in early 1968. Tulin and Williams finished a tour with a line-up that also included Kenny Loggins and Jeremy Stuart, but by mid-1968 they too departed the group.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> out and was {{presently}} walking rather aimlessly {{through the}} outer lobby.|$|E
6000|$|... "Am I right? Yes; {{this is the}} East room. My dear Miss Price, I {{beg your}} pardon, but <b>I</b> have <b>made</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> to you on purpose to entreat your help." ...|$|R
60|$|It was a {{staggering}} thought. I could not but dwell upon it often as <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>my</b> lonely <b>way</b> through this virgin world. Then, quite suddenly, one day I {{stepped out of}} the peace of manless primality into the presence of man--and peace was gone.|$|R
6000|$|... "No {{man-of-war}} {{has touched}} here," [...] said Dickory, [...] "and I don't belong to one. I wear these clothes because I am compelled to do so, having no others. Yesterday afternoon I escaped from some pirates who stopped for water, and since leaving them <b>I</b> have <b>made</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> to this spot." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> {{back to the}} carriage, and lit my pipe in a glow of emotion.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> back, {{and was not}} {{a little}} disgusted to find my chair {{occupied}} by the unconscionable Chevenix.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> to Mr. Waterbrook, and said, that I {{believed}} I had {{the pleasure}} of seeing an old schoolfellow there.|$|E
60|$|The dressing-bell {{rang out}} and we hurried off to our rooms, for Dr. Randall, easy-going enough in some things, was {{strictness}} itself with regard to our punctuality at dinner-time. But no sooner had I seen de Cartienne safely in his room than <b>I</b> softly <b>made</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> downstairs again and crossed the yard to the stables.|$|R
6000|$|But I was too wary to be caught. [...] "Later on," [...] I would {{reply to}} him; [...] "when <b>I</b> have <b>made</b> <b>my</b> <b>way,</b> when <b>I</b> am {{stronger}} to withstand your wheedling. Then I {{will go with}} you, if you are still in existence, my sentimental little friend. We will dream again the old impractical, foolish dreams--and laugh at them." ...|$|R
6000|$|Oh! I {{have been}} dilatory and dumb; <b>I</b> should have <b>made</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> {{straight}} to you long ago; I should have blabbed nothing but you, I should have chanted nothing but [...] you.|$|R
60|$|With {{no great}} {{difficulty}} <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> through the scrub {{and climbed the}} eminence of tumbled rocks that shut in the view.|$|E
60|$|Service over, <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> through {{crowds of}} children, who stood {{staring at the}} {{marvelous}} stranger, and resumed my stroll along the London Road.|$|E
60|$|As <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> {{through the}} grounds I saw Audrey in the distance, walking with the Nugget. I avoided them {{and went on}} into the house.|$|E
60|$|And then I {{awoke to}} reality, and found I {{had been sitting}} in my chair longer than I had intended. The band-stand was empty, the sun had set; <b>I</b> rose and <b>made</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> home through the {{scattered}} crowd.|$|R
6000|$|Then Sir Launcelot laughed, and he said: [...] "Messire, {{how will}} you stay me against my will?" [...] The Green Knight said: [...] "We will stay you by force of our numbers." [...] "Well," [...] quoth Sir Launcelot, [...] "for the matter of that, <b>I</b> have <b>made</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> against greater odds than those I now see before me. So your peril will be of your own devising, if you seek to stay me." ...|$|R
6000|$|But I was not {{inclined}} to let her off so easily. <b>I</b> presently <b>made</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> to her side. [...] "Your uncle was complimentary enough to consult me as {{to the meaning of}} the appearance of a certain exuberant Spanish visitor at his house the other night." [...] I looked into her brown eyes, but my own slipped off her velvety pupils without retaining anything. Then she reinforced her gaze with a pince-nez, and said carelessly: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "After that <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> to {{my little}} camp, which, fortunately, the {{elephants}} had not walked over, and wrapping myself up in a blanket, was soon fast asleep.|$|E
6000|$|Reeling, <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> {{through the}} smoke that now seemed to fill my lungs, to where I knew the door to be. Oh, horror! it was closed and secured! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hugh, {{you ought}} to get married. I'll have to find a nice girl for you," [...] he said. With an elation not unmingled with awe <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> homeward.|$|E
6000|$|Both of our {{loves to}} your sister and yourself. As for me, if I am here and happy, I know to whom I owe it; <b>I</b> know who <b>made</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> {{for me in}} life, if that were all, and I remain, with love, your {{faithful}} friend, ...|$|R
60|$|The orgy {{was taking}} place {{in one of the}} ground-floor rooms which had French windows opening on to the drive, and it was to these French windows that <b>I</b> now <b>made</b> <b>my</b> <b>way.</b> An {{orchestra}} was playing something with a good deal of zip to it, and under happier conditions I dare say my feet would have started twitching in time to the melody. But I had sterner work before me than to stand hoofing it by myself on gravel drives.|$|R
60|$|For {{an instant}} I paused, my ear {{close to the}} panel, to learn if he had {{suspected}} aught, but as no sound of pursuit came from within <b>I</b> wheeled and <b>made</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> along the new corridor, following the rope, which I coiled and brought with me as I advanced.|$|R
60|$|Thence <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> to Mr. Robbie's, where I {{rang the}} bell. A servant {{answered}} the summons, {{and told me}} the lawyer was engaged, as I had half expected.|$|E
60|$|Wiping the {{perspiration}} from my face, <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> to {{the forward}} deck. But few people were on board, and quite undisturbed, I {{leaned against the}} railing to review the situation.|$|E
6000|$|... "For life or death, I {{care not}} which, {{so long as}} I am with you!" [...] I said, as I moved off. Descending the Jacob's ladder, <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> down the rock-hewn passage.|$|E
60|$|It {{appeared}} that <b>I</b> had <b>made</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> into {{the centre of}} an ancient asylum for superannuated tradesmen and decayed householders, with which was connected a school for {{a limited number of}} boys. It was founded upwards of two centuries since on an old monastic establishment, and retained somewhat of the conventual air and character. The shadowy line of old men in black mantles who had passed before me in the hall, and whom I had elevated into magi, {{turned out to be the}} pensioners returning from morning, service in the chapel.|$|R
60|$|She took a {{candlestick}} {{from the}} table, lighted the candle, {{and handed it}} me with a courtesy. <b>I</b> bowed, and <b>made</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> along the gallery above the deserted court-yard. Entering my room and closing the door after me, I drew the miniature from my pocket and stood gazing at it for I know not how long.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am of {{the belief}} {{that we have made}} what you might call a tunnel {{straight}} through, and within a dozen inches of the surface," [...] he replied. [...] "I had no means of guessing as to the distance, except by taking the flooring of the building as being well on the level, and from that I feel positive <b>I</b> had <b>made</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> upward to a point equal in height to the last rung of the ladder. The question that bothers me is, how we can break through the crust of earth without leaving behind token of what has been done?" ...|$|R
60|$|Amidst {{these dreams}} came evening, and then Martha brought a light; with her aid I was quickly dressed, and {{stronger}} {{now than in}} the morning, <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> down to the blue saloon unassisted.|$|E
6000|$|It was now my turn. With {{a beating}} heart <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> to the robber chieftain, and sank at his feet. [...] "O sir, I am {{nothing but a}} poor governess, pray let me go." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> {{into the}} house and entered the morning room as the cab drove off. Mr. Bundercombe and Eve were waltzing. Mr. Bundercombe paused at my {{entrance}} and wiped his forehead. He was very hot.|$|E
60|$|No more low, wet grounds, no more dikes and sluices, no more {{of these}} grazing cattle,--though they seemed, in their dull manner, to wear a more respectful air now, and to face round, in order that they might stare as long as {{possible}} at the possessor of such great expectations,--farewell, monotonous acquaintances of my childhood, henceforth I was for London and greatness; not for smith's work in general, and for you! <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>my</b> exultant <b>way</b> to the old Battery, and, lying down there to consider the question whether Miss Havisham intended me for Estella, fell asleep.|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} items have been assembled from some notes <b>I</b> <b>made</b> while working <b>my</b> <b>way</b> through the Budworm Model.

40|$|T his is {{my final}} letter {{to you as}} the SMRT President. It really doesn’t seem possible. The last year {{has been one of}} the best and busiest of my life.
