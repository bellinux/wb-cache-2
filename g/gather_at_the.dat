If the principes could not break the enemy they would retire behind the triarii, who would then engage the enemy.|$|E

5|$|The ascetic, Vedic and Tantric sub-traditions {{related to}} Shiva, {{such as those}} that became ascetic warriors during the Islamic rule period of India, {{celebrate}} the Kumbha Mela festival. This festival cycles every 12 years, in four pilgrimage sites within India, with the event moving to the next site after a gap of three years. The biggest is in Prayaga (renamed Allahabad during the Mughal rule era), where millions of Hindus of different traditions <b>gather</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> confluence of rivers Ganges and Yamuna.

5|$|Although {{freshwater}} invertebrates inhabiting and comprising {{algae and}} periphyton make {{the foundation of}} food webs {{in the middle and}} lower basin, zooplankton and phytoplankton take that role in the estuarine habitat. Mollusks <b>gather</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> St. Johns estuary in large numbers, feeding {{on the bottom of the}} river and ocean floors. The abundance and importance of oysters (Crassostrea virginica) is apparent in the many middens left by the Timucua in mounds many feet high. Oysters and other mollusks serve as the primary food source of shorebirds. The large trees that line the river from its source to south of Jacksonville begin to transition into salt marshes east of the city. Mayport is home to approximately 20 shrimping vessels that use the mouth of the St. Johns to access the Atlantic Ocean.|$|E

Pitched battles were conducted in a similar fashion; the velites would <b>gather</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> front and fling javelins to cover the advance of the hastati. If the hastati failed to break the enemy, they would fall back on the principes, who had also been re-armed with swords. If the principes could not break them, they would retire behind the triarii, who would then engage the enemy.|$|E

5|$|Those {{men of the}} 1st Parachute Brigade {{that landed}} on the {{southern}} drop zone were well within range of the 1st Fallschirmjäger Machine Gun Battalion. In the darkness, the Germans initially thought that the paratroopers were their own reinforcements landing, but they soon realised their mistake and opened fire. Some of those who escaped the machine gun fire were rounded up on the drop zone, and about 100of them became prisoners of war {{as soon as they}} had touched ground. In the confusion of the landing, 50 men of the 1st Parachute Battalion had assembled, assaulted and managed to capture the bridge before the 50 Italian defenders could destroy it with the attached demolition charges. The Italians were taken prisoner, just as a second group of 40 paratroopers led by Brigadier Lathbury arrived at the bridge. Lathbury organised the safe removal of the demolition charges and set up a defensive perimeter. More paratroopers continued to <b>gather</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> bridge, and soon they numbered around 120men, who dug in to the north and south.|$|E
