5|$|Apart {{from his}} operas, Wagner {{composed}} relatively <b>few</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> music. These include a symphony in C major (written {{at the age}} of 19), the Faust Overture (the only completed part of an intended symphony on the subject), some overtures, and choral and piano pieces. His most commonly performed work that is not an extract from an opera is the Siegfried Idyll for chamber orchestra, which has several motifs in common with the Ring cycle. The Wesendonck Lieder are also often performed, either in the original piano version, or with orchestral accompaniment. More rarely performed are the American Centennial March (1876), and Das Liebesmahl der Apostel (The Love Feast of the Apostles), a piece for male choruses and orchestra composed in 1843 for the city of Dresden.|$|E
5|$|In August 2001, an {{expedition}} {{headed by the}} marine archaeologist and author Clive Cussler announced that they had found {{the remains of a}} ship embedded in the Rochelois reef. Only a <b>few</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> timber and some metal artifacts could be salvaged, the remainder of the wreckage being lost within the coral. Initial tests on the wood indicated that it was the type extensively used in New York shipyards at the time of Mary Celestes 1872 refit, and it seemed the remains of the Mary Celeste had been found. However, dendrochronological tests carried out by Scott St George of the Geological Survey of Canada showed that the wood came from trees, most probably from the US state of Georgia, that would still have been growing in 1894, about ten years after the Mary Celestes demise.|$|E
5|$|Sandgrouse are monogamous. The {{breeding}} season usually coincides with {{a crop of}} seeds after the local rainy season and at this time, the feeding flocks tend to break up into pairs. The nesting site is a slight depression in the ground, sometimes lined with a <b>few</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> dry foliage. Most typically, three cryptic eggs are laid, though occasionally there may be two or four. Incubation duties are shared and in most species, the males incubate at night while the females sit on the eggs during the day. The eggs usually hatch after 20–25 days. The precocial chicks are covered with down and leave the nest {{as soon as the}} last hatchling has dried out. The parents do not provide them with food and they learn, with parental guidance, what is edible and what is not. The chicks obtain their water from the soaked downy feathers on the adults breasts. At first the chicks are too small and young to thermoregulate, and are provided with shade during the hottest part of the day and brooded at night. They remain with their parents, as a family group, for several months.|$|E

50|$|Some current {{prolific}} carvers are converting from quantity to quality, making <b>fewer</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> high artistic quality (as {{the market}} is flooded with lower quality quickly-made carvings). Modern carvings of superior quality sell for about the same prices as classic old original carvings of equal quality by unknown artists.|$|R
50|$|In Burroughs's description, Jetan is won when {{either a}} Chief captures the {{opposing}} Chief, or when any piece captures the opposing Princess.

5|$|The {{most famous}} {{of the very few}} chairs which have come down from a remote antiquity is the reputed Chair of Saint Peter in St Peter's Basilica at Rome. The wooden {{portions}} are much decayed, but it would appear to be Byzantine work of the 6th century, and to be really an ancient sedia gestatoria. It has ivory carvings representing the labours of Hercules. A <b>few</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> an earlier oaken chair have been let in; the existing one, Gregorovius says, is of acacia wood. The legend that this was the curile chair of the senator Pudens is necessarily apocryphal. It is not, as is popularly supposed, enclosed in Gian Lorenzo Bernini's bronze chair, but is kept under triple lock and exhibited only once in a century. Byzantium, like Greece and Rome, affected the curule form of chair, and in addition to lions’ heads and winged figures of Victory (or Nike) and dolphin-shaped arms used also the lyre-back which has been made familiar by the pseudo-classical revival {{of the end of the}} 18th century.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, the Japanese army {{captured}} the Forbidden City in Beijing, but were {{only able to}} remove a few large bronze tubs and a <b>few</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> cannon. Most of these were recovered after the war, in Tianjin.|$|E
25|$|An {{inventory}} of White House furnishings taken on May 26, 1865, showed that {{nearly the entire}} buff band china service had survived. It appeared to be inferior or roughly handled, however, {{and much of it}} broke over the next two years. An inventory dated February 28, 1867, indicated that only a <b>few</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> this set remained.|$|E
5000|$|Although this chapel {{contains}} <b>fewer</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> Guayasamín's {{art than}} the nearby foundation and museum, the building he designed provides an atmosphere specific to his artwork to view his paintings. The Capilla del Hombre exhibits Guayasamín's {{work as a}} history of human suffering and violence in Latin America and the world. It includes sculptures and murals and integrates the surroundings into an artistic interpretation of the subject.|$|R

50|$|By tradition, skycaps are tipped {{for their}} {{services}}. Generally tips are offered per <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> luggage or item; in the United States, tips of $1-3 US per item are common, with higher tips being offered for extra {{services such as}} checking overweight or excess bags or getting passengers in front of long lines. Skycaps are found at major or international airports in Canada, where the average charge is $10 for 3 or <b>fewer</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> baggage and $2 per additional item.|$|R
25|$|Wernher von Braun was an {{accomplished}} amateur pianist who could play Beethoven and Bach from memory. He {{learned to play}} both the cello and the piano {{at an early age}} and at one time wanted to become a composer. He took lessons from the composer Paul Hindemith. The <b>few</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> von Braun’s youthful compositions that exist are reminiscent of Hindemith's style.|$|E
25|$|In the 19th century people {{theorized that}} {{the camp was}} built by the ancient Britons (a theory {{supported}} by its being adjacent {{to the line of}} Ryknild Street) which runs through the area, others proposed that it was built by the Danes although no factual evidence supports this theory. Some <b>few</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> ancient weapons, such as swords and battle axes, and portions of bucklers have been found at the site.|$|E
25|$|Colonel Ranabir Singh Thapa, {{brother of}} Bhimsen Thapa, {{was to be}} the Sector Commander of Makawanpur-Hariharpur axis. He was given a very large {{fortress}} and about 4,000 troops with old rifles and a <b>few</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> cannons. But the British could not move forward from the border. Colonel Ranabir Singh Thapa had been trying to lure the enemies to his selected killing area. But Major General Wood would not venture forward from Bara Gadhi and he eventually fell back to Betiya.|$|E

50|$|Some {{unconventional}} {{approaches are}} also proposed. One such method is a PSP method proposed by Mike Oehler. The PSP method uses wooden posts, plastic sheeting and non-conventional ideas that allow more windows and ventilation. This design also reduces some runoff {{problems associated with}} conventional designs. The method uses wood posts, a frame that acts like a rib to distribute settling forces, specific construction methods which rely on <b>fewer</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> heavy equipment, plastic sheeting, and earth floors with plastic and carpeting.|$|R
25|$|In 1996 {{the team}} of Robert V. Fletcher and Terry L. Cameron (under the {{supervision}} of the Ohio Historical Society's Bradley T. Lepper) reopened a trench created by Frederic Ward Putnam of Harvard over 100 years before. They found a <b>few</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> charcoal in what was believed to be an undisturbed portion of the Serpent Mound. However, bioturbation, including burrowing animals, frost cracks, etc., can reverse the structural timeline of an earthen mound such as Serpent Mound. It can shift carbon left by a later culture on the surface to areas deep within the structure, making the earthwork appear younger.|$|E
25|$|Taishi Ci {{was famous}} for his archery skills. There was one notable {{incident}} when he accompanied Sun Ce to attack rebels in Mabao (麻保). The rebel leader stood at the viewing platform above the gate, with his hand resting against a wooden pillar, and hurled verbal abuse at Sun Ce. Taishi Ci took aim and fired an arrow at him. The arrow pierced through both the pillar and the rebel's hand. Everyone was awed by Taishi Ci's skill. When the warlord Cao Cao heard about Taishi Ci, {{he wrote a letter}} to him and put it inside a box containing a <b>few</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> danggui.|$|E
25|$|In 1865, Arnold {{published}} Essays in Criticism: First Series. Essays in Criticism: Second Series {{would not}} appear until November 1888, {{shortly after his}} untimely death. In 1866, he published Thyrsis, his elegy to Clough {{who had died in}} 1861. Culture and Anarchy, Arnold's major work in social criticism (and one of the <b>few</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> his prose work currently in print) was published in 1869. Literature and Dogma, Arnold's major work in religious criticism appeared in 1873. In 1883 and 1884, Arnold toured the United States and Canada delivering lectures on education, democracy and Ralph Waldo Emerson. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1883.|$|E

5000|$|Kehlmann’s early “Compositions” {{are made}} with {{traditional}} lead came and colored glass. Glass forms protrude from the background surface, whimsically frolicking with and redefining underlying blocks of color and lead scribbles. [...] Explaining the absence of transparent glass in these works, he wrote: “I don’t want people looking through my windows. What lies behind the compositions, aside from a source of light, has no relevance to my design.” Kehlmann rejected the medium’s seductive colors and Tiffany-like approach “plagued” by “small multi-colored <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> glass,” insisting that the artist has “greater control” with fewer colors and <b>fewer</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> glass.|$|R
25|$|From 1630 Ronsard was {{not again}} reprinted {{for more than}} two centuries. Just before the close of the second, however, Sainte-Beuve printed a {{selection}} of his poems to accompany the above-mentioned Tableau (1828). There are also selections, Choix de poésies - publiées par A. Noël (in the Collection Didot) and Becq de Fouquières. In 1857 Prosper Blanchemain, who had previously published a volume of Œuvres inédites de Ronsard, undertook a complete edition for the Bibliothèque Elzévirienne, in eight volumes. It is practically complete; a <b>few</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> a somewhat free character which are ascribed with some certainty to the poet are, however, excluded. A later and better edition still is that of Marty-Laveaux (1887–1893), and another that of Benjamin Pifteau (1891).|$|E
25|$|The Romans built a stone-walled fort in AD150 {{to protect}} the river {{crossing}} which was {{at the foot of}} the Tyne Gorge, and this took the name of the bridge so that the whole settlement was known as 'Pons Aelius'. The fort was situated on a rocky outcrop overlooking the new bridge, on the site of the present Castle Keep. Pons Aelius is last mentioned in AD400, in a Roman document listing all of the Roman military outposts. It is likely that nestling in the shadow of the fort would be a small vicus, or village. Unfortunately, no buildings have been detected; only a <b>few</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> flagging. It is believed that there was a Roman cemetery near Clavering Place, behind the Central station, as a number of Roman coffins have been unearthed there.|$|E
25|$|Apparently the {{earliest}} of the Rollright Stones, the Whispering Knights are {{the remains of}} the burial chamber of an Early or Middle Neolithic portal dolmen lying 400metres east of the King's Men. Four standing stones survive, forming a chamber about twosquare metres in area around a fifth recumbent stone, probably the collapsed roof capstone. Although archaeologists and antiquarians had been speculating and debating the nature of the Whispering Knights for centuries, more about the monument was only revealed following the excavations carried out around the stones by George Lambrick and his team during the 1980s. They revealed that the portal dolmen had never been a part of a longer cairn, as had been suggested by some earlier investigators, and uncovered a <b>few</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> Neolithic pottery around the monument.|$|E

50|$|Like {{many other}} {{residents}} in northern Laos, Lao Loum families in Ban Yang still practice the traditional rotational shifting cultivation. This method is translated into practice as xong pi ham, xam pi khop, meaning that, production in one specific {{plot of land}} for one year is equivalent to {{two years of the}} fallow for recovering soil fertility and vegetation. Depending on the need for foods, availability of labor forces and natural resources capital, that each family would decide whether more or <b>fewer</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> land be included this method of traditional agriculture.|$|R
