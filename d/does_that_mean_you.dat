2500|$|In 219, when Sun Quan's general Lü Meng {{proposed}} {{a plan to}} defeat a rival general Guan Yu and seize control of southern Jing Province, Sun Quan sought Shi Yi's opinion on Lü Meng's plan. Shi Yi agreed with Lü Meng's plan and advised Sun Quan to adopt it. Sun Quan then commissioned Shi Yi as a Colonel of Loyalty and Righteousness (忠義校尉) and ordered him to accompany Lü Meng on the campaign. When Shi Yi thanked Sun Quan for his trust in him, the latter said, [...] "I {{may not be a}} Viscount Jian of Zhao, but <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>mean</b> <b>you</b> can't be a Zhou She?" ...|$|E

30|$|With {{improved}} gaming skills, older {{players are}} able to negotiate game strategies when facing a problem. Example 5 immediately follows the ending of a game session {{in which the two}} players had failed a game task. In line 1, the younger player is expressing her disappointment about losing the game. The older player’s soft uttered response (“°I couldn’t done it.°”) indicates her disappointment with her game performance. Then, she notices the emerging information on the game screen, and asks, “What is strong arm? A type of strong arm?”, which is the FPP of a question-answer sequence that directs the talk to another turn-taking sequence. The younger player’s response (“Strong arm and left turner”) is the SPP. The older player further asks, “What <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>mean?</b> <b>You</b> have to have strong arms?” These two utterances display an understanding problem (or a repair initiation). In lines 6 – 8, the younger player explains that the on-screen information means she “had a strong arm” and the older player “turned left a lot”. However, the older player misunderstands the interpretation, believing that the younger player worked very well but her left arm did not do a good job (lines 9 – 10). This misunderstanding is the initiator of another round of repair and the younger player’s previous repair is the trouble source. The younger player immediately emphasizes “left turn” is not a bad thing, and explains it means the older player was “on the left side more than the right.” To address the older player’s misunderstanding, the younger player repeats the utterance, “But, that {{does not necessarily mean that}} is a bad thing.” The younger player’s second round of repair is effective because the older player verbalizes acceptance of her younger partner’s explanation (“Okay”) and thus confirms the repair. She then suggests that for the coming new game task they should be on the each side of the canoe (lines 15 – 16). The younger player says, “I start in the middle and then I come down right or left”, indicating she respects the older player’s opinion and accepts the side the older player chooses for her, but also improves the strategy by mentioning she will change the side later based on the situation. The older player accepts her younger partner’s strategy and turns the talk to next sequence by asking whether they should play again. This is how the two players with different levels of game skills participate in the negotiation of game strategies and respect each other’s views.|$|E
