In May 2012, he purchased the [...] $2.5 million former house of Heath Ledger in Laurel Canyon in the Hollywood Hills, a small ranch built in 1951. He professes that his fame {{has not changed}} him as a person, stating, [...] "I love my job {{more than anything in}} the world and I could never imagine <b>doing</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else.</b> So this whole thing is a very small price to pay compared to someone who has to go to an office to work." ...|$|E

She had previously covered the Isley Brothers' single [...] "At Your Best (You Are Love)". By 2001, Aaliyah had enjoyed her now seven-year career and {{felt a sense of}} accomplishment.

[...] "I breathe to perform, to entertain, I can't imagine myself <b>doing</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else.</b> I'm just a really happy girl right now. I honestly love every aspect of this business. I really do. I feel very fulfilled and complete." ...|$|E

Matt Stone stated [...] "If they hadn't put this episode back on the air, we'd have had serious issues, and we wouldn't be <b>doing</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> with them." [...] After the episode was {{scheduled}} to be rebroadcast, Trey Parker and Matt Stone were interviewed on CNN's Showbiz Tonight, where they stated that all of the controversy increased publicity for the episode. Parker was quoted: [...] "But it's really like a publicist couldn't have orchestrated this any better for us. You know what I mean? It's like it's been phenomenal. Tom Cruise has done more for South Park than anyone I think in the world." ...|$|E

It follows that photon 2 possesses an element of physical reality: that of having a vertical polarization.|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked why}} he writes, King responds: [...] "The {{answer to that is}} fairly simple—there was nothing else I was made to do. I was made to write stories and I love to write stories. That's why I do it. I really can't imagine <b>doing</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> and I can't imagine not doing what I do." [...] He is also often {{asked why he}} writes such terrifying stories and he answers with another question: [...] "Why do you assume I have a choice?" [...] King usually begins the story {{creation}} process by imagining a [...] "what if" [...] scenario, such as what would happen if a writer is kidnapped by a sadistic nurse in Colorado.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{currently}} no plans for Absolutely Fabulous {{to return to}} television for a new series, specials, nor film as the planned sequel to the 2016 feature film was cancelled. Although the series was intended to end in 1995 following the third series, an official finale, [...] "The Last Shout", which was broadcast in 1996 and marked a closure for the series. However, it was revived in 2001. It was again mentioned that the series would not return following the 2004 Christmas special, [...] "White Box", but three 20th Anniversary specials were screened some time later with speculation that a new series would be broadcast in the future. On 28 November 2016, {{it was announced that}} Absolutely Fabulous was finished, as Jennifer Saunders said that [...] "I'm not doing anything more with Ab Fab. That's it, it's over now.

It was a horrible position for you, but you really couldn't <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else,</b> that I can see. You told your story simply and like a man. But wait. There is one thing I can't understand. Those shares--were they not {{to be part of}} that poor man's vengeance.

2500|$|In around 1806 Peacock {{left his}} job {{in the city and}} during the year made a solitary walking tour of Scotland. The annuity left by his father expired in October 1806. In 1807 he {{returned}} to live at his mother's house at Chertsey. He was briefly engaged to Fanny Faulkner, but it was broken off through the interference of her relations. [...] His friends, as he hints, thought it wrong that so clever a man should be earning so little money. In the autumn of 1808 he became private secretary to Sir Home Popham, commanding the fleet before Flushing. By {{the end of the year}} he was serving Captain Andrew King aboard [...] in the Downs. [...] His preconceived affection for the sea did not reconcile him to nautical realities. [...] "Writing poetry", he says, [...] "or <b>doing</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> that is rational, in this floating inferno, is next to a moral impossibility. I would give the world to be at home and devote the winter to the composition of a comedy". He did write prologues and addresses for dramatic performances on board HMS Venerable. His dramatic taste then and for the next nine years resulted in attempts at comedies and lighter pieces, all of which lacked ease of dialogue and suffered from over-elaborated incident and humour. He left HMS Venerable in March 1809 at Deal and walked around Ramsgate in Kent before returning home to Chertsey. He had sent his publisher Edward Hookham a little poem of the River Thames which he expanded during the year into [...] "The Genius of the Thames". On 29 May he set out on a two-week expedition to trace the course of the Thames from its source to Chertsey and spent two or three days staying in Oxford.|$|E
