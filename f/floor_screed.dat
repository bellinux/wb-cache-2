Sand-cement floors are levelled manually and anhydrite floors are self-levelling and therefore differences in work demands and prevalences of musculoskeletal complaints might occur. The objective was to assess among SF layers and AF layers (1) the prevalence of musculoskeletal complaints and (2) the physical work demands, energetic workload, perceived workload and discomfort. A questionnaire survey and an observational field study were performed. Compared with AF layers (n = 35), SF layers (n = 203) had higher, however, not statistically significant different, prevalences of neck (20 % vs. 7 %), shoulder (27 % vs. 13 %), low back (39 % vs. 26 %) and ankles/feet (9 % vs. 0 %) complaints. Sand-cement-bound <b>screed</b> <b>floor</b> layers (n = 18) bent and kneeled significantly longer (Δ 77 min and Δ 94 min; respectively), whereas AF layers (n = 18) stood significantly longer (Δ 60 min). The work demands of SF layers exceeded exposure criteria for low back and knee complaints and therefore new working measures should be developed and implemented. In comparison with anhydrite-bound <b>screed</b> <b>floor</b> layers, sand-cement-bound <b>screed</b> <b>floor</b> layers exceeded exposure criteria for work-related low back and knee complaints.

Consequently they can look very similar to a sand/cement screed Flow screeds are often {{preferred}} to traditional cement based screeds as they are faster to install and provide a similar finish. Flow screed is most often used in combination with underfloor heating installation as the reduced thickness provides for more effective and efficient heat transfer. One of the main advantages of liquid flow screed is that, it offers few additional benefits compared to sand and cement. It is anything but difficult to pour, with fluid properties that consider an expedient application and quicker drying time. There aren't any bigger advantages of this product than when combined with underfloor heatingsystem, a lesser thickness of liquid <b>flooring</b> <b>screed,</b> when compared with conventional screeds, minimises heat storage leading to a floor that reacts quickly to user requirement hence raising the efficacy of your underfloor heating method.|$|R

An observational intervention study among 10 floor layers {{was performed to}} assess the differences between a self-propelled and a manually moved machine. The outcome measures were work demands, production time, perceived load, discomfort and applicability. Compared to the self-propelled machine, the duration of kneeling (∆ 13 min; p = 0. 003) and trunk flexion (∆ 12 min; p < 0. 001) was shorter using the manually moved machine, and the duration of pushing and pulling increased (∆ 39 min; p < 0. 001). No significant or relevant differences were found for production time, perceived load and discomfort. Nine out of ten floor layers found the manually moved machine applicable and three out of ten found the self-propelled machine applicable.

40|$|Construction and {{demolition}} waste (C&DW) {{represents one of}} the EU’s largest waste streams. According to the Directive 2008 / 98 /EC on waste, at least 70 percent (by weight) of non-hazardous C&DW must be recuperated by 2020. Eurostat estimates an annual C&DW generation of 970 Mton in EU- 27, representing an average value of almost 2. 0 ton per inhabitant, with an average recovery rate of 47 %. A case study in the Port of Antwerp (PoA) demonstrated new high grade recycling options for purified material fractions from C&DW. C&DW from the selective demolition of an office building was used {{for the construction of a}} new waste collection center. Recovery focused on the mineral fraction of C&DW. This selectively collected mineral fraction was crushed for the production of mixed recycled aggregates (MRA). Currently, MRA are used almost exclusively in low-grade unbound applications like (sub) foundations. However, this market is getting increasingly saturated. Therefore, the development of more high-grade applications is needed to assure a market for the stony fraction of C&DW. The use in these high-grade applications requires recycled aggregates with a higher purity, to guarantee optimal technical and environmental performance. In order to obtain this higher purity, MRA were treated by advanced automated sorting technologies. Near Infrared (NIR) sorting was used to strongly reduce the content of problematic fractions (e. g. organics, gypsum). These materials can lead to expansive compounds, delays in hardening and a lack of bonding strength in cement-based materials. As a result of the NIR sorting, the technical and environmental quality of the MRA was significantly improved. Subsequently, the purified MRA were treated by color (UV-VIS) sorting. This sorting technique allows the separation of a grey (concrete) fraction and a red (ceramic) fraction. The concrete fraction was then reprocessed into new concrete products that were used for the production of foundation concrete and polished concrete floors, both inside and outside the building. The latter application in particular can be considered as very high level, demonstrating the technical possibilities of pure recycled concrete aggregates. During the case study, a high-grade recycling option for autoclaved aerated concrete (AAC) was also demonstrated. The major challenge for AAC recycling is sulfate leaching, causing both environmental and technical problems. A strong reduction in sulfate leaching from AAC recycling products was obtained via immobilization. Recycled AAC was used in the case study as a sand replacement in an insulating <b>flooring</b> <b>screed.</b> This case study illustrates the possible added value of selective demolition and advanced sorting techniques for the creation of high-grade recycling options. Additionally, a recycling pathway for one of the more problematic C&DW types (AAC) was demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{development}} and availability of ergonomic measures in the construction industry, the number of construction workers reporting high physical work demands remains high. A reduction of the high physical work demands {{can be achieved by}} using ergonomic measures. However, these ergonomic measures must be effective and implemented. In the first part, the effect of ergonomic measures on the physical work demands and workload was evaluated in two highly demanding construction jobs: <b>screed</b> <b>floor</b> layers and ironworkers. It was found that a different working method and electrical screed levelling machines are effective in significantly reducing the exposure to physically high work demands of floor layers, but not for the workload. For ironworkers, allowing 100 -kg four-worker lifts instead of 50 -kg two-worker lifts did not result in differences in physical work demands, but reduced the biomechanical workload of the low back. The second part described and evaluated two guidance strategies of a Participatory Ergonomics intervention to implement ergonomic measures in construction companies. In the first strategy, the companies were guided by means of face-to-face contacts with an ergonomic consultant. In the second strategy, the guidance was offered through email contacts (e-guidance). The e-guidance influenced the use of ergonomic measures the most compared to the fact-to-face guidance, although the intervention was better delivered to the companies in the face-to-face guidance strategy...|$|R

This study evaluates the characteristics of concrete produced with Atlantic ocean and Lagoon water. Concrete produced with tap water (regarded as potable drinking water) serves as the control experiment. Compressive strength, workability and density were used to evaluate the characteristics of concrete specimens. All the concrete samples have true shnnp with Lagoon water concrete having low workability and both tap and Atlantic ocean water concrete having medilllll workability. The concrete specimens produced with the three types of water fall into the category of normal weight concrete as their densities lie within the range of 2200 - 2600 kg m- 3 specified. The 28 th day compressive strength of concrete specimens produced with Atlantic ocean, tap and Lagoon water are 25. 0 and 33. 5 N mm- 2, 17. 9 and 28. 6 N mm- 2 as well as 15. 1 and 19. 4 N mm- 2 for mix ratios 1 : 3 : 6 and 1 : 2 : 4, respectively.

40|$|Purpose – To {{evaluate}} manufacturers' {{claims that}} structural polypropylene fibres provide satisfactory {{crack control reinforcement}} and compare the findings against steel fabric used as crack control in screeds where tensile forces are likely to occur. Design/methodology/approach – The procedure used to provide load, deflection data, toughness indices and residual strength factors was compliant with ASTM C 1018 - 97 and in part ASTM C 78 - 02 to define first crack toughness and first crack strength. Findings – A 142 steel fabric reinforcement as used in screeds was more effective in producing toughness and residual strength when directly compared {{with the performance of}} structural polypropylene fibre reinforced concrete. Where polypropylene fibre reinforced concrete did have an advantage over the steel reinforced concrete was when I 20 was exceeded and the deflection and crack width was excessive. Steel fabric tended to fail and/or the screed material failed either prior to or in excess of I 20, whereas the fibre reinforced concrete held together albeit at a very much reduced load transfer when compared with steel fabric. Practical implications – If the forces to be encountered through expansion or contraction are small, then, due to the small distances between the fibres redistributing the stress and minimising the cracks within the concrete matrix, polypropylene fibres may be suitable for crack control when directly compared with A 142 fabric reinforcement. The use of fibres has benefits to the <b>floor</b> <b>screed</b> companies, using screed-laying machines as the process avoids laying steel on which the screed machine will have to operate. Originality/value – There is a general lack of research coverage examining crack control in screed floor finishing materials...|$|E

It is established that in the process of increase of specific surface of fine ground quartz filler naturally there is an increase in the total number of active centers, but their number does not change per unit of surface. The calorimetric method of analysis established that the mechanical activation increases the reactivity centers. This is the result of chemical reactions occurring on the surface, for example, under the influence of water present in the air. The authors observed hydration of surface groups and change in their reactivity. A method of regulation of rheological characteristics of pastes with plasticizing additives in the system ”cement - quartz sand - graphite“ was developed, which was aimed to reduce the ultimate shear stress up to 0. 5 [...] . 1. 3 PA and water-composite relationship of a sand mix by 15 [...] . 25 % while maintaining the viscosity of the paste that provides a uniform application of the composite in <b>screed</b> <b>floors</b> technology possessing electrical conductivity. Polycarboxylate is an efficient plasticizing additive which maintains self-levelling effect of the mixture at optimum water-cement ratio. It was determined that the threshold concentration of electrical current flow in the studied system is 0. 15 (wt.), at which the aggregation of contacting graphite particles with the formation of a continuous three-dimensional mesh a conducting current is observed {{in the structure of the}} composite. The change in the concentration of the graphite allows ensuring the stability of the electrophysical parameters of the resistive materials and structures based on them. In order to increase the electrical conductivity of graphite dispersions in a model system a plasticizer was added, which reduces water-composite ratio in the formation of pastes. Chemical-based plasticizer has no significant effect on the magnitude of the threshold concentration. The increase in activation time of silica sand leads to the increased resistance of the prototypes and to the reduction of specific electrical conductivity of graphite dispersions in the system under study from 9. 8 Om - 1 ·m - 1 to 0. 018 Om - 1 ·m - 1.

Elevation 960 masl. ** Number and dimensions of quarries: Four main groups of quarries on two hills. Three groups on Gâvuröreni Tepe cover ca. 0. 5 km 2; single group on Göz Tepe (0. 75 km to west) covers 0. 25 km 2. On Gâvuröreni Tepe, at least 20 small to medium-sized quarries and additional small pits are configured {{in a straight line}} below one another, connected by slipway paths. Modern quarrying is confined to the crest of the hill, with limited additional prospection and drilling at the base. Extensive modern quarrying on Göz Tepe. The three medium-sized and 17 small quarries are bowl-shaped quarries with discernible faces and sides or simple pits. ** Geological age, grain size, and color: Mesozoic. Medium to coarse grained. Primarily white marble but with varying intervals of gray, mottling, a translucent bluish white and tan breccia. ** Modern quarrying: Extensive modern intrusion. In June 2008, Bes Mer from Izmir was active on the southeast slope of Gâvuröreni Tepe, and abandoned workers' lodging is on top of the hill. According to local informants from Ören, marble companies had destroyed several ancient structures, including a tower and several vaulted chambers. Modern wastage blocks scar the landscape and are visible from any vantage point in the western Morsynus river valley. ** Joints and quality of marble: Joint spacing is more generous here than in the other Southern Quarries, which explains why this area was worked more heavily. Area between joints varies in height from 3. 0 m to 6. 0 m and in width from 2. 5 m to 4. 0 m. Marble quality is high enough to have yielded some of the longest white blocks used in the city. ** Quarry organization and evidence for extraction: Ören Quarries took advantage of natural contours to obtain a greater supply of large blocks and to facilitate their transport out of the quarry. ** Of the five pit quarries at top of Gâvuröreni Tepe (Quarries 11 – 16), some grew to be quite wide; Quarry 14, the largest, measures 9. 9 m high, 43 m wide, and 12 m deep. In Quarry 11, a handful of blocks with ancient pickmarks line the uppermost, lateral, and bottom portions of the perimeter; it is impossible to determine the ancient extent though (modern capacity ca. 300, 000 m 3) because of extensive intrusion from modern quarrying. ** Quarry 10 lies below and west of the upper quarries and is medium sized. Modern quarrying has destroyed the lower levels, while the ancient quarry face and the original floor are preserved in the upper portion. On the upper face, joints are spaced widely enough for extraction of large blocks; after exposing a joint 4. 0 m wide, quarrymen dug down 6. 5 m, working in steps as they removed a succession of blocks from the thick marble beds. Quarry floor preserves four excavation trenches with traces of pickmarks and wedge holes. ** A third group of quarries lies 175 m below and west of Quarry 10. This area comprises nine different ancient quarries (Quarries 1 – 9), all connected by visible slipways. At the end of one slipway, a graffito of a bird was scrawled on a block that was once part of an ancient quarry face but has since been removed from its original location by modern quarriers. ** Quarry 4 is a medium-sized, bowl-shaped quarry. Two separating channels, 2. 5 m long and 1. 25 m wide, are partially exposed on the floor. ** Quarry 6 preserves a shallow, stepped face and wide working floor, filled with spoil. A series of nine wedge holes, spaced 0. 15 m apart, runs along the base of a separating channel, along natural fractures in the marble; the intent was to extract two blocks, each 1. 0 m long. ** Quarry 7 is bilevel with numerous worked <b>floors.</b> The <b>scree</b> that typically accumulates over time and obscures the original extent of a quarry has been removed by modern quarriers. Ancient quarry floors, or bottoms of separating trenches, are well preserved. The upper level was exploited first. After a nearly vertical north–south and east–west joint was exposed at floor level, quarriers followed it downward to what became the lower level. The pattern of trenches on the floor shows that quarrymen extracted standardized blocks, in three different widths— 0. 62 m, 0. 90 m, and 1. 50 m—and in varying lengths over 1. 0 m. Separating trenches were placed in alternating directions, parallel and perpendicular to natural north –south and east–west joints. In one well-preserved section, separating trenches 0. 25 m wide are on either side of a block 0. 66 m wide and 3. 50 m long; a regular line of tool fine-point chisel marks, 1 cm apart, is seen on three sides of the trench, indicating the intended bottom of the block. These marks scored the bottom of a block so that when pressure was applied, the block would break away along an even line. ** A slipway leading out of Quarry 9 ends at a level area surrounded by three low stone walls, which was possibly a staging ground for cutting blocks or area of shelter for workmen. ** Quarries 17 – 20 are on Göz Tepe, with traces of ancient pickmarks preserved in each. A single slipway, clearly visible in satellite images, connects the Göz Tepe and Gâvuröreni Tepe quarries {{at the foot of the}} hills. ** Blocks: Small worked block lies among abandoned modern blocks in Göz Tepe quarr...|$|R

Ömer Lütfü Lülü House used for different functions over the years and it was seen some interventions. Additional building was built on the south facade of the house in the  first half of the 20. century. It is considered that the additional building which has wc, bath and kitchen in it, was built because of requirements of the house owners. The bearing system was interfered in the second half of the 20. century. Therefore, there is structural problems in the house today. Changes on original plan typology was made by interventions on the walls, door and windows. The house is also exposed to external conditions beside user interventions. The damages of the house are classified as material damages, structural damages, biological damages and damages occured by user interventions. Chronological analyses is maded before restitution work. First period which is the original situation of the house is worked as restitution. It is used signs from building, typologic study and source study. Original plan typology of the building, original facades and original details were analyzed.   It is used  traces of building and typologic analyses while restitution project. It could nort reached  any visual material but oral sources was used. It was enough traces of building and typologic analyses while restitution of Ömer Lütfü Lülü House. However, itcould not said strong conclusion on the restitution of garden because of less of source about Antalya houses' gardens. The garden of Ömer Lütfü Lülü House is also different from other houses' gardens.   It is classified functional suggestions and  repairment suggestions while restoration project. Social balance was changed where the house is located, because of  the tourism. It is considered that Ömer Lütfü Lülü House could not maintain original function anymore because Kaleiçi region has tourism function. First, it is considered that the function of house can be a museum. Because of existence of other buildings which has museum function, the idea was given up. Most of old buildings' function is changed as otel in Kaleiçi because of tourism. Ömer Lütfü Lülü House's function also changed as otel on restoration decisions. Our ambition is being a good instance for old building otel projects.  It is also offered long term repairment and continuous maintenance of building.   The house is documented with surveying, material and damage analyses were made, restitution and restoration projects of the house were prepared. The problems because of wrong interventions, damages on structural elements and material threaten existence of the building. Therefore, it is offered suitable intervention which does not affect original properties. The building, which is unused nowadays, remains the original details. Preparing restoration project of Ömer Lütfü Lülü House which has remarkable appearance of the region, according to the principles of contemporary restoration is the main target of thesis.
