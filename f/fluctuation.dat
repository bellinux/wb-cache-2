Also, noting the local intensity of the dipole field (or its <b>fluctuation)</b> is insufficient to characterize Earth's magnetic field as a whole, as it is not strictly a dipole field. The dipole component of Earth's field can diminish even while the total magnetic field remains the same or increases.|$|E

Besides the well-known initial eccentricity <b>fluctuations,</b> several {{other sources of}} dynamical <b>fluctuations</b> are identified.

The magnitudes of these <b>fluctuations</b> are investigated relative to eccentricity <b>fluctuations</b> and average flow magnitude.

40|$|Theory of non-local {{transport}} {{has been}} developed, {{taking an example}} of zonal flows (ZFs), the radial correlation length of which is longer than those for microscopic <b>fluctuations.</b> ZF, which is driven by <b>fluctuations</b> at one radius, can suppress <b>fluctuations</b> at distant radii. This mechanism induces new non-local interactions in turbulent transport. That is, strong <b>fluctuations</b> at particular radius can suppress <b>fluctuations</b> at different radius, via induction of ZFs.

In the a. c. short-circuit situation, <b>fluctuations</b> across the intrinsic region result in voltage <b>fluctuations</b> {{across the two}} space-charge regions and consequently {{in the number of}} injected carriers. This coupling between mobility and carrier concentrations is found to be very weak for diodes with a short intrinsic region.

40|$|Standard {{results for}} the <b>fluctuations</b> of {{thermodynamic}} quantities are derived under the assumption of sampling identical systems that are in different, not fully equilibrated states.

When many identically prepared - but not identical - systems are studied, mesoscopic <b>fluctuations</b> due to variations from sample to sample contribute to the <b>fluctuations</b> of thermodynamic quantities. We study the combined effect of mesoscopic <b>fluctuations</b> and <b>fluctuations</b> of thermal occupancy.

5|$|Before its scandal, Enron was lauded for its {{sophisticated}} {{financial risk}} management tools. Risk management was crucial to Enron {{not only because of}} its regulatory environment, but also because of its business plan. Enron established long-term fixed commitments which needed to be hedged to prepare for the invariable <b>fluctuation</b> of future energy prices. Enron's bankruptcy downfall was attributed to its reckless use of derivatives and special purpose entities. By hedging its risks with special purpose entities which it owned, Enron retained the risks associated with the transactions. This arrangement had Enron implementing hedges with itself.|$|E
