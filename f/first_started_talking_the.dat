50|$|Day Without Immigrants (or A Day Without Immigrants) was {{a protest}} and boycott {{that took place}} on February 16, 2017, to {{demonstrate}} the importance of immigration, and to protest President Donald Trump's {{plans to build a}} border wall and to potentially deport millions of illegal immigrants. The strike called for immigrants not to go to work, to avoid spending money, and keep children home from school. People took part to show the importance of immigrants to the economy and also to protest possible racial profiling of U.S. citizens by immigration enforcement. The strike was planned on social media. People <b>first</b> <b>started</b> <b>talking</b> about <b>the</b> strike after the Women's March, and as the idea gained momentum, important people in the restaurant industry helped boost exposure.|$|R
5000|$|Wilma Mankiller, former Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation, is a {{good example}} of the Indian {{professional}} middle class raised in an urban area. Mankiller relocated with her parents in the 1950s to the San Francisco Bay Area. She states in her autobiography, [...] "We were not forced to do anything [...] [...] [...] our poverty had prompted the move. In 1955, my father <b>first</b> <b>started</b> <b>talking</b> to <b>the</b> Bureau of Indian Affairs officials about the various forms of assistance for Cherokees. Relocation was a possibility." [...] (p. 68-69) Relocation was difficult for the young Wilma, but she later attended San Francisco State College and learned techniques of community organization in the political climate of the Bay Area in the 1970s. She took these skills back to the Cherokee Nation in Oklahoma and has assisted with revitalization there.|$|R
5000|$|Bell also {{discussed}} the end tag of the episode, where Simmons is {{consumed by the}} Kree Monolith weapon, saying [...] "When we <b>first</b> <b>started</b> <b>talking</b> about <b>the</b> Monolith, we knew that it needed to present a threat and we needed to demonstrate some of that threat {{and the promise of}} more story, because — this is gonna shock you — we want more people to watch next year, because we like when people watch our show. It’s easy to kill a character for shock value or whatever, and we did have a number of deaths this season, but I don’t think they were so much for shock value as the hopefully understandable logic of the characters and the stories. We prefer to leave you with something to talk about, to walk away with. This is something that came up in <b>the</b> room, we <b>talked</b> about what it meant… The idea of getting Fitz and Simmons — who had been one person — to become two whole people, come back together, agree to go on a date, and then have this happen, felt beautifully poetic and promises some really intriguing stories next season, which is really what it’s all about." ...|$|R
5000|$|With both Andrew Farriss and Hutchence {{living in}} London, <b>the</b> pair <b>first</b> <b>started</b> <b>talking</b> about <b>the</b> project over the phone. After {{spending}} months talking about new ideas, Farriss and Hutchence finally {{got together and}} began working on new material. Using 24-track reels and ADAT (Alesis Digital Audio Tape) recorders the pair put together a handful of demo tapes, which included {{an early version of}} the song [...] "Searching". The remaining members of INXS later flew out to meet Farriss and Hutchence in London. When the entire group finally got together, they began rehearsing the material that Farriss and Hutchence previously recorded. The rehearsals began in April 1996. While visiting friends Bono and Larry Mullen Jr. from U2 in Dublin during the summer of 1996, Farriss and Hutchence rented a small studio where they continued working on the album. They put the finishing touches on the existing demo tapes, as well as composing new recordings. One of the first songs to be completed during these sessions was [...] "Searching". The band first previewed the song live at the Australian ARIA Music Awards in September 1996.|$|R
500|$|After {{the season}} finale, Bell talked about Coulson losing his arm, saying that [...] "he paid a price—that was {{important}} to us. You don't mess with {{the forces of nature}} without getting bitten, {{and the fact that he}} literally saved everyone on the ship by that crystal not shattering was a wonderful, heroic thing and showed you that at heart, Coulson is a heroic man whose actions back up his words." [...] Bell also <b>talked</b> about <b>the</b> cliffhanger involving Simmons being absorbed by a Kree monolith: [...] "When we <b>first</b> <b>started</b> <b>talking</b> about <b>the</b> Monolith, we knew that it needed to present a threat and we needed to demonstrate some of that threat and the promise of more story... It's easy to kill a character for shock value or whatever, and we did have a number of deaths this season, but ... we prefer to leave you with something to talk about, to walk away with. This is something that came up in <b>the</b> room, we <b>talked</b> about what it meant ... The idea of getting Fitz and Simmons—who had been one person—to become two whole people, come back together, agree to go on a date, and then have this happen, felt beautifully poetic".|$|R
