Her ears are ugly and rough; her breasts hang <b>down.</b> <b>In</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> her trembling hands, she holds a winnowing basket, while the other makes a boon-conferring gesture (varada-mudra) or knowledge-giving gesture (cinmudra). She rides in a horseless chariot bearing an emblem of a crow and a banner. She is astute and crafty, though. Always hungry and thirsty, Dhumavati initiates quarrels and invokes fear.|$|E
25|$|In 1790, Stewart {{was elected}} as a Member of the Irish Parliament for <b>Down</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the most {{expensive}} elections in Irish history. Though for a time he {{was associated with the}} Northern Whig Club, he entered the Irish House of Commons as an Independent. He ran on a platform supporting Whig principles of electoral reform and opposing the Irish policies of the British Government. But even from the outset of his career, he was a personal supporter of the Prime Minister, William Pitt. Stewart was a lifelong advocate of Catholic concessions, though his position on the specific issue of Catholic Emancipation varied depending on his assessment of the potential repercussions on other policy priorities.|$|E

2500|$|Iraq {{quickly found}} itself bogged <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> {{the longest and}} most {{destructive}} wars of attrition of the 20th century. During the war, Iraq used chemical weapons against Iranian forces fighting on the southern front and Kurdish separatists who were attempting {{to open up a}} northern front in Iraq with the help of Iran. These chemical weapons were developed by Iraq from materials and technology supplied primarily by West German companies as well as using dual-use technology imported following the Reagan administration's lifting of export restrictions. The United States also supplied Iraq with [...] "satellite photos showing Iranian deployments". In a US bid to open full diplomatic relations with Iraq, the country was removed from the US list of State Sponsors of Terrorism. Ostensibly, this was because of improvement in the regime's record, although former United States Assistant Secretary of Defense Noel Koch later stated, [...] "No one had any doubts about [...] continued involvement in terrorism ... The real reason was to help them succeed in the war against Iran." [...] The Soviet Union, France, and China together accounted for over 90% of the value of Iraq's arms imports between 1980 and 1988.|$|E

[...] if she falls <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> her disguises. And, if big guys throw her, she tells them to do it [...] "gently!" [...] In addition, when she disapproves of something, she exclaims [...] "Gotta go!" [...] When she makes an appearance on Cory in the House, her father exclaims, [...] "You didn't get kicked out of design school because they don't give out refunds!", which shows she is attending design school.
