40|$|We have {{analysed}} {{the mechanism}} of action for induction of apoptosis by N-substituted benzamides using <b>declopramide</b> as a lead compound. We show here that <b>declopramide</b> at doses above 250 [*]μM in the mouse 70 Z/ 3 pre-B cell line or in the human promyeolocytic cancer cell line HL 60 induced cytochrome c release into the cytosol and caspase- 9 activation. The broad spectrum caspase inhibitor zVADfmk and caspase- 9 inhibitor zLEDHfmk inhibited apoptosis and improved cell viability when administrated to cells 1 [*]h before exposure to <b>declopramide,</b> whereas the caspase- 8 inhibitor zIEDHfmk had less effect. Also, the over expression of Bcl- 2 by transfection in 70 Z/ 3 cells inhibited declopramide-induced apoptosis. Prior to the induction of apoptosis, a G 2 /M cell cycle block was induced by <b>declopramide.</b> The cell cycle block was also observed {{in the presence of}} broad spectrum caspase inhibitor zVADfmk and in a transfectant expressing high levels of Bcl- 2. Furthermore, while p 53 was induced in 70 Z/ 3 cells by <b>declopramide,</b> neither the apoptotic mechanism nor the G 2 /M cell cycle block were dependent on p 53 activation since both effects were also seen in p 53 deficient HL 60 cells after addition of <b>declopramide...</b>|$|E
40|$|Benzamides {{have been}} in {{clinical}} use {{for many years in}} treatment against various disorders. A recent application is that as a sensitizer for radio- or chemotherapies. We have here analysed the mechanism of action of N-substituted benzamides using an in vitro system. We found that while procainamide was biologically inert in our system, the addition of a chloride in the 3 ′ position of the benzamide ring created a compound (<b>declopramide)</b> that induced rapid apoptosis. Furthermore, <b>declopramide</b> also inhibited NFκB activation by inhibition of IκBβ breakdown. An acetylated variant of <b>declopramide,</b> N-acetyl <b>declopramide,</b> showed no effect with regard to rapid apoptosis induction but was a potent inhibitor of NFκB activation. In fact, the addition of an acetyl group to procainamide in the 4 ′ position was sufficient to convert this biologically inactive substance to a potent inhibitor of NFκB activation. These findings suggest two potential mechanisms, induction of early apoptosis and inhibition of NFκB mediated salvage from apoptosis, for the biological effect of N-substituted benzamides as radio- and chemo-sensitizers. In addition it suggests that N-substituted benzamides are potential candidates for the development of anti-inflammatory compounds using NFκB as a drug target. © 1999 Cancer Research Campaig...|$|E
