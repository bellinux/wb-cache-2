50|$|In the meanwhile, however, {{there was}} a {{dramatic}} change in the system. In 1763 one of the sitting MPs, Strutt's friend Bamber Gascoyne, was appointed to the Board of Trade and therefore had to stand for re-election at Maldon. Gascoyne's opponent, John Huske, accused him of threatening that any freemen working in the customs house who did not vote for him would be dismissed (which, by that time, would have been an <b>illegal</b> <b>threat).</b> Although the Prime Minister, George Grenville, denied having authorised Gascoyne to make any such threat and Gascoyne denied having made it, it seems clear it was believed in Maldon and the corporation sided with Huske, creating enough new freemen to ensure Gascoyne was defeated. Both sides started actions for bribery, but Gascoyne had decided on more drastic action. He took out a writ against the Corporation, and the Courts ordered the ousting of the majority of members; eventually, in 1768, the Corporation was dissolved by judicial order.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Violence risk {{assessment}} in schizophrenia {{relies heavily on}} criminal history factors. AIMS: To investigate which criminal history factors are most strongly associated with violent crime in schizophrenia. METHOD: A total of 13806 individuals (8891 men and 4915 women) with two or more hospital admissions for schizophrenia were followed up for violent convictions. Multivariate hazard ratios for 15 criminal history factors included in different {{risk assessment}} tools were calculated. The incremental predictive validity of these factors was estimated using tests of discrimination, calibration and reclassification. RESULTS: Over a mean follow-up of 12. 0 years, 17. 3 % of men (n = 1535) and 5. 7 % of women (n = 281) were convicted of a violent offence. Criminal history factors most strongly associated with subsequent violence {{for both men and}} women were a previous conviction for a violent offence; for assault, <b>illegal</b> <b>threats</b> and/or intimidation; and imprisonment.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} and describe online interpersonal victimization (OIPV) in terms of gender differences and the association between such victimization and online behavior of active social media users in a Swedish sample. Since social media has become such a big part of our world it is of importance to study OIPV in this forum. Previous research has found that OIPV is a rather common phenomenon, that there are gender differences included and that certain online behaviors are risk factors. OIPV by itself is not a crime but rather an umbrella term including the legal terms <b>illegal</b> <b>threat,</b> slander, insult, harassment, sexual harassment, stalking and crimes against the personal data act or the copyright act. The cyberlifestyle–routine activities theory was used in this study to understand which online behaviors were risk factors in our sample. To answer the aim a survey was made and answered by 338 participants. The answers were tested with chi-square tests (χ²) and Mann-Whitney U tests in order to examine differences in gender regarding victimization and to find differences between the victimized and non-victimized group regarding their online behaviors. The results showed a high prevalence of OIPV and that women were more likely to be victims of OIPV, especially of harassment, sexual harassment, threats of sexual violence and stalking. The online behaviors that were significant risk factors in our sample were the use of a profile picture of themselves and number of hours spent on social media every day. This combined indicated that social media may not be a completely gender equal place and that online behaviors may not indicate the risk of being victimized equally well for both genders. 2016 - 06 - 01 </p...|$|E

40|$|Background: Epilepsy and {{traumatic}} brain injury are common neurological conditions, with general population prevalence estimates around 0. 5 % and 0. 3 %, respectively. Although both illnesses are associated with various adverse outcomes, and expert opinion has suggested increased criminality, links with violent behaviour remain uncertain. Methods and Findings: We combined Swedish population registers from 1973 to 2009, and examined associations of epilepsy (n = 22, 947) and {{traumatic brain}} injury (n = 22, 914) with subsequent violent crime (defined as convictions for homicide, assault, robbery, arson, any sexual offense, or <b>illegal</b> <b>threats</b> or intimidation). Each case was age and gender matched with ten general population controls, and analysed using conditional logistic regression with adjustment for sociodemographic factors. In addition, we compared cases with unaffected siblings. Among the {{traumatic brain injury}} cases, 2, 011 individuals (8. 8 %) committed violent crime after diagnosis, which, compared with population controls (n = 229, 118), corresponded to a substantially increased risk (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 3. 3, 95 % CI: 3. 1 – 3. 5); this risk was attenuated when cases were compared with unaffected siblings (aOR = 2. 0, 1. 8 – 2. 3).

40|$|CONTEXT: Although bipolar {{disorder}} {{is associated with}} various adverse health outcomes, the relationship with violent crime is uncertain. OBJECTIVES: To determine the risk of violent crime in {{bipolar disorder}} and to contextualize the findings with a systematic review. DESIGN: Longitudinal investigations using general population and unaffected sibling control individuals. SETTING: Population-based registers of hospital discharge diagnoses, sociodemographic information, and violent crime in Sweden from January 1, 1973, through December 31, 2004. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals with 2 or more discharge diagnoses of bipolar disorder (n = 3743), general population controls (n = 37 429), and unaffected full siblings of individuals with bipolar disorder (n = 4059). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Violent crime (actions resulting in convictions for homicide, assault, robbery, arson, any sexual offense, <b>illegal</b> <b>threats,</b> or intimidation). RESULTS: During follow-up, 314 individuals with bipolar disorder (8. 4 %) committed violent crime compared with 1312 general population controls (3. 5 %) (adjusted odds ratio, 2. 3; 95 % confidence interval, 2. 0 - 2. 6). The risk was mostly confined to patients with substance abuse comorbidity (adjusted odds ratio, 6. 4; 95 % confidence interval, 5. 1 - 8. 1). The risk increase was minimal in patients without substance abuse comorbidity (adjusted odds ratio, 1. 3; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 0 - 1. 5), which was further attenuated when unaffected full siblings of individuals with bipolar disorder were used as controls (1. 1; 0. 7 - 1. 6). We found no differences in rates of violent crime by clinical subgroups (manic vs depressive or psychotic vs nonpsychotic). The systematic review identified 8 previous studies (n = 6383), with high heterogeneity between studies. Odds ratio for violence risk ranged from 2 to 9. CONCLUSION: Although current guidelines {{for the management of}} individuals with bipolar disorder do not recommend routine risk assessment for violence, this assertion may need review in patients with comorbid substance abuse...|$|R

40|$|CONTEXT: Persons with {{schizophrenia}} {{are thought}} to be at increased risk of committing violent crime 4 to 6 times the level of general population individuals without this disorder. However, risk estimates vary substantially across studies, and considerable uncertainty exists as to what mediates this elevated risk. Despite this uncertainty, current guidelines recommend that violence risk assessment should be conducted for all patients with schizophrenia. OBJECTIVE: To determine the risk of violent crime among patients diagnosed as having schizophrenia and the role of substance abuse in mediating this risk. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Longitudinal designs were used to link data from nationwide Swedish registers of hospital admissions and criminal convictions in 1973 - 2006. Risk of violent crime in patients after diagnosis of schizophrenia (n = 8003) was compared with that among general population controls (n = 80 025). Potential confounders (age, sex, income, and marital and immigrant status) and mediators (substance abuse comorbidity) were measured at baseline. To study familial confounding, we also investigated risk of violence among unaffected siblings (n = 8123) of patients with schizophrenia. Information on treatment was not available. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Violent crime (any criminal conviction for homicide, assault, robbery, arson, any sexual offense, <b>illegal</b> <b>threats,</b> or intimidation). RESULTS: In patients with schizophrenia, 1054 (13. 2 %) had at least 1 violent offense compared with 4276 (5. 3 %) of general population controls (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 2. 0; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 8 - 2. 2). The risk was mostly confined to patients with substance abuse comorbidity (of whom 27. 6 % committed an offense), yielding an increased risk of violent crime among such patients (adjusted OR, 4. 4; 95 % CI, 3. 9 - 5. 0), whereas the risk increase was small in schizophrenia patients without substance abuse comorbidity (8. 5 % of whom had at least 1 violent offense; adjusted OR, 1. 2; 95 % CI, 1. 1 - 1. 4; P<. 001 for interaction). The risk increase among those with substance abuse comorbidity was significantly less pronounced when unaffected siblings were used as controls (28. 3 % of those with schizophrenia had a violent offense compared with 17. 9 % of their unaffected siblings; adjusted OR, 1. 8; 95 % CI, 1. 4 - 2. 4; P<. 001 for interaction), suggesting significant familial (genetic or early environmental) confounding of the association between schizophrenia and violence. CONCLUSIONS: Schizophrenia was associated with an increased risk of violent crime in this longitudinal study. This association was attenuated by adjustment for substance abuse, suggesting a mediating effect.

40|$|During Reconstruction the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments {{were added}} to the Constitution. The {{circumstances}} under which the Reconstruction amendments were proposed and ratified were extremely unusual, and at the time serious objections were raised to the legality of the proceedings. Although for practical purposes that controversy is long over, the amendments 2 ̆ 7 lawfulness remains a nagging problem. There are two important lines of objection to the amendments 2 ̆ 7 adoption. One is that {{some or all of the}} southern state governments that participated in ratifying them were not legally competent to do so because of the irregular fashion in which those governments had been created. The other objection is that some or all of the southern ratifications were extorted from the states through unlawful federal threats. This Article reviews the relevant history and discusses legal rationales under which the constitutional amendments were valid even if there were serious illegalities in the creation of the southern state governments. According to one such rationale, southern ratifications were unnecessary because the ex-Confederate states were excluded from the denominator on which the Article V super-majority is calculated. The Article concludes that this thesis is plausible but ultimately unpersuasive. Another theory is that the identification of a state 2 ̆ 7 s lawful government is a political question to be decided by the political branches of the national government and ultimately by Congress, and that Congress endorsed the ratifying southern governments, thereby binding all other actors to treat those governments as lawful. The Article reviews the arguments for and against this version of the political question doctrine and regards the issue as an open one. Finally, the southern ratifications may have been effective, despite legal defects in the ratifying governments, because those governments had de facto authority and hence were able to bind their states. The legal authority of de facto governments is a familiar principle of international law that has been followed in American constitutional practice, and the Article endorses it in this context. Either the political question or the de facto government thesis must confront the argument that southern ratifications were invalid because extorted through unlawful federal threats. The Article maintains that it is doubtful whether the ratifications were so extorted, and claims that in any event Article V of the Constitution does not implicitly invalidate ratifications made in the face of <b>illegal</b> <b>threats.</b> The conclusion argues that this result, under which constitutional amendments can be validly ratified even when principles of state autonomy are violated, is nevertheless consistent with the purpose of Article V and the constitutional system in general. Certainty as to the text of the Constitution is more fundamental than more substantive considerations...|$|R
