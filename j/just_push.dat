5|$|The {{developers}} {{attempted to}} recreate {{as many of}} historical venues within the game. For example, to fulfill Joe Perry's request that they recreate Max's Kansas City in New York, the developers used old photographs and YouTube videos of the club during the 1970s, to a highly accurate degree, as claimed by those that had attended the club during that period. Within these venues, set decorations are inspired from Aerosmith album covers. Five that were confirmed are Pump, Toys in the Attic, <b>Just</b> <b>Push</b> Play, Get Your Wings, and Nine Lives.|$|E
25|$|At {{this point}} of time three results were {{possible}} (India win, Australia win and a Tie). Mitchell Johnson then strayed a delivery on to the leg side and Ojha did well to <b>just</b> <b>push</b> it past the wicket keeper. The Indian batsmen ran a couple and had won the match. VVS Laxman top scored in the second innings with an unbeaten 73 and once again proved himself a nemesis to Australia turning certain defeat into glorious victory similar to Kolkata 2001, Adelaide 2003 and Perth 2008.|$|E

25|$|The car {{stayed on}} the lead lap, until a minor safety-car hiccup saw it go down a lap, and {{seemingly}} out of race contention. New co-driver Russell Ingall {{was told by the}} team to not worry about the car, and <b>just</b> <b>push</b> 110% {{for the rest of the}} day - to spare nothing. When the leading Richards/Skaife Commodore retired with a failed diff, Ingall scrambled the car back onto the lead lap. Between them, Perkins and Ingall spent the rest of the race gradually whittling back the gap to the leaders.|$|E
500|$|In March 2001, {{the band}} {{released}} their 13th studio album <b>Just</b> <b>Push</b> Play, which quickly went platinum, {{fueled by the}} Top 10 single [...] "Jaded" [...] {{and the appearance of}} the title track in Dodge commercials. They were inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame soon after their album was released, in late March 2001. Aerosmith is the only band to be inducted to the Hall of Fame with a song active in the charts ("Jaded"). Later that year, the band performed as part of the [...] benefit concert in Washington D.C. for 9/11 victims and their families. The band flew back to Indianapolis for a show the same night, as part of their <b>Just</b> <b>Push</b> Play Tour.|$|E
500|$|Going Commando {{received}} critical acclaim. 1UP.com {{said that}} [...] "Everything that Ratchet & Clank did, Going Commando does better, and the tweaks and additions <b>just</b> <b>push</b> it further over the top." [...] Game Informers Andy McNamara {{said that the}} game has [...] "the best and most compelling content [...] has put out to date." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{show was}} a {{financial}} success for Comedy Central and helped the network transform into [...] "a cable industry power almost overnight". Despite this, critics gave the season mixed reviews. Parents Television Council rated it so offensive that it [...] "shouldn't have been made": [...] "it doesn't <b>just</b> <b>push</b> the envelope; it knocks it off the table", while another critic {{thought of it as}} [...] "coming pretty damn close" [...] to being a [...] "perfect" [...] television series season.|$|E
500|$|Lead artist Arnold Tsang recounted {{that the}} body size, {{as well as the}} running pose of a character, were both {{characteristics}} that were considered during character design in order to make each one identifiable. Tracer, for instance, has a wild running animation, in addition to a unique trail of blue light, which follows behind her. Nathan Grayson of Kotaku commented that her jump animation appears [...] "hyper-exaggerated and kinda goofy looking". This {{is a result of the}} smear frame, combined with squash and stretch animation techniques, implemented in Overwatch. With respect to Tracer, Blizzard senior animator David Gibson pointed out frames from her jump animation, stating, [...] "we're trying to <b>just</b> <b>push</b> it a little further than normal. Something as simple as stretching the torso out, having her hang [...] just a little bit longer than normal. Really squashing her when she lands. Her head is tucking in. Everything is supporting this basic principle of squash and stretch in a gameplay asset." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe", {{the first}} episode of the series, {{received}} generally negative reviews after airing. Brent Bozell, founder and then-president of the Parents Television Council, gave an unfavorable review to the episode, stating that the show [...] "is so offensive that it shouldn't have been made. It doesn't <b>just</b> <b>push</b> the envelope; it knocks it off the table." [...] Bruce Fretts of Entertainment Weekly thought poorly of the writing and characters, lampooning that [...] "if only the kids' jokes were as fresh as their mouths" [...] and that [...] "it might help if the South Park kids had personalities, but they're as one-dimensional as the show's cut-and-paste animation." [...] Calling the series [...] "sophomoric, gross, and unfunny," [...] Hal Boedeker of the Orlando Sentinel reckoned that the episode made [...] "such a bad impression that it's hard {{to get on the}} show's strange wavelength." [...] Tom Shales of The Washington Post considered that [...] "most of the alleged humor on the premiere is self-conscious and self-congratulatory in its vulgarity: flatulence jokes, repeated use of the word 'dildo' (in the literal as well as pejorative sense), and a general air of malicious unpleasantness." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then here he is." [...] Our host, all unprepared, his {{latchkey}} {{still in}} his hand, had <b>just</b> <b>pushed</b> open the door and, startled at finding us, turned a frightened look {{from one to the}} other, wondering what disaster we were there to announce or avert.|$|R
50|$|Roma Victor {{featured}} real-time combat, {{which was}} largely decided by character skills {{similar to the}} character 'levels' found in most MMOs. However, unlike some other games, there were several tricks that were harder to pull off than <b>just</b> <b>pushing</b> a button. Timing and tactics also played {{a big role in}} your character's survival.|$|R
25|$|There {{was more}} action as both Ukyo Katayama and then Rubens Barrichello passed Wendlinger {{to get into}} the points. Both then stopped, with Barrichello getting ahead. Senna had reduced the gap to Schumacher to 5 seconds, but then spun off on lap 56, <b>just</b> <b>pushing</b> too hard. He was out. Schumacher won ahead of Hill, Alesi, Barrichello, Katayama and Wendlinger.|$|R
500|$|The band started 2002 by {{ending the}} <b>Just</b> <b>Push</b> Play tour, and {{simultaneously}} recording segments for their Behind the Music special on VH1, {{which not only}} chronicled the band's history but also the band's current activities and touring. The special {{was one of the}} few Behind the Musics to run two hours in length. In May, Aerosmith covered the [...] "Theme from Spider-Man" [...] for the soundtrack of the 2002 film of the same name. On June 27, the band performed at the official FIFA World Cup concert at Tokyo Stadium which took place during the 2002 FIFA World Cup held in Japan/Korea. In July 2002, Aerosmith released a two-disc career-spanning compilation O, Yeah! Ultimate Aerosmith Hits, which featured the new single [...] "Girls of Summer" [...] and embarked on the Girls of Summer Tour with Kid Rock and Run–D.M.C. opening. O, Yeah! has since been certified double platinum. MTV honored Aerosmith with their mtvICON award in 2002. Performances included Pink covering [...] "Janie's Got a Gun". Shakira performed [...] "Dude (Looks Like a Lady)", Kid Rock played [...] "Mama Kin" [...] and [...] "Last Child", Train performed [...] "Dream On" [...] and Papa Roach covered [...] "Sweet Emotion". In addition, testimonials featured surprise guests Metallica, as well as Janet Jackson, Limp Bizkit singer Fred Durst, Alicia Silverstone and Mila Kunis.|$|E
500|$|A few {{hard rock}} bands from the 1970s and 1980s managed to sustain highly {{successful}} recording careers. Bon Jovi were {{still able to}} achieve a commercial hit with [...] "It's My Life" [...] from their double platinum-certified album Crush (2000). and AC/DC released the platinum-certified Stiff Upper Lip (2000) Aerosmith released a number two platinum album, <b>Just</b> <b>Push</b> Play (2001), which saw the band foray further into pop with the Top 10 hit [...] "Jaded", and a blues cover album, Honkin' on Bobo, which reached number five in 2004. Heart achieved their first Top 10 album since the early 90s with Red Velvet Car in 2010, becoming the first female-led hard rock band to earn Top 10 albums spanning five decades. [...] There were reunions and subsequent tours from Van Halen (with Hagar in 2004 and then Roth in 2007), The Who (delayed in 2002 {{by the death of}} bassist John Entwistle until 2006) and Black Sabbath (with Osbourne 1997–2006 and Dio 2006–2010) and even a one off performance by Led Zeppelin (2007), renewing the interest in previous eras. Additionally, hard rock supergroups, such as Audioslave (with former members of Rage Against the Machine and Soundgarden) and Velvet Revolver (with former members of Guns N' Roses, punk band Wasted Youth and Stone Temple Pilots singer Scott Weiland), emerged and experienced some success. However, these bands were short-lived, ending in 2007 and 2008, respectively. The long-awaited Guns N' Roses album Chinese Democracy was finally released in 2008, but only went platinum and failed to come close {{to the success of the}} band's late 1980s and early 1990s material. More successfully, AC/DC released the double platinum-certified Black Ice (2008). Bon Jovi continued to enjoy success, branching into country music with [...] "Who Says You Can't Go Home", which reached number one on the Hot Country Singles chart in 2006, and the rock/country album Lost Highway, which reached number one in 2007. In 2009, Bon Jovi released another number one album, The Circle, which marked a return to their hard rock sound.|$|E
2500|$|In 2001, Aerosmith {{played at}} the Super Bowl XXXV halftime show and was {{inducted}} into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The band released the album <b>Just</b> <b>Push</b> Play, which featured the top-10 hit [...] "Jaded". At the 2001 Indianapolis 500, Tyler sang the National Anthem in traditional Aerosmith style – complete with a raspy voice, bluesy swagger, and a hard rocker yell. When Tyler sang the National Anthem, he changed the words which caused a public outcry. Instead of singing [...] "Land of the free and the home of the brave", he changed the words to [...] "Land of the free and the home of the Indianapolis 500." [...] This received negative reactions from veterans and fans, leading Tyler to issue a public apology. Aerosmith embarked on the 8-month-long <b>Just</b> <b>Push</b> Play Tour in June 2001, and has toured every year since, except 2008. After the September 11 attacks, the band performed at the benefit concert [...] in Washington, DC. Tyler donned a full-length jacket featuring the American flag, and the band performed a brief set including [...] "Livin' on the Edge", [...] "I Don't Want to Miss a Thing", [...] "Just Push Play", and [...] "Walk This Way". The band flew back to Indianapolis to perform a show that same night.|$|E

I ain't used to going round alone." ...|$|R
2500|$|Bjelland {{has been}} noted by music critics for her unique {{screaming}} vocals. Journalist Richard Cromelin noted in a 1992 Los Angeles Times profile that [...] "She retches her enraged lyrics, her screams skid across the beat and collide with the blunt riffs. Her voice erupts into laughs and gargles, then croons down low with eerie detachment." [...] Commenting on her musical aspirations, Bjelland said: [...] "It should sound like nothing that you've heard before. That's my intention... Like my singing, all I {{try to do is}} I <b>just</b> <b>push</b> myself into things where I think I can't reach notes and stuff. Sometimes it sounds really ridiculous, but then you just kind of work on it." [...] In Babes in Toyland, Bjelland's instrumentation and songwriting have been described as [...] "ugly, crunching post-punk," [...] supplemented by [...] "rudimentary" [...] guitar chords.|$|E

6000|$|It {{was with}} these {{considerations}} that his present attention was charged--they perfectly availed {{to make what}} he saw portentous. He couldn't, by any lapse, have blocked that aperture; and if he hadn't, if it was unthinkable, why what else was clear but {{that there had been}} another agent? Another agent?--he had been catching, as he felt, a moment back, the very breath of him; but when had he been so close as in this simple, this logical, this completely personal act? It was so logical, that is, that one might have taken it for personal; yet for what did Brydon take it, he asked himself, while, softly panting, he felt his eyes almost leave their sockets. Ah this time at last they were, the two, the opposed projections of him, in presence; and this time, as much as one would, the question of danger loomed. With it rose, as not before, the question of courage--for what he knew the blank face of the door to say to him was [...] "Show us how much you have!" [...] It stared, it glared back at him with that challenge; it put to him the two alternatives: should he <b>just</b> <b>push</b> it open or not? Oh to have this consciousness was to think--and to think, Brydon knew, as he stood there, was, with the lapsing moments, not to have acted! Not to have acted--that was the misery and the pang--was even still not to act; was in fact all to feel the thing in another, in a new and terrible way. How long did he pause and how long did he debate? There was presently nothing to measure it; for his vibration had already changed--as just by the effect of its intensity. Shut up there, at bay, defiant, and with the prodigy of the thing palpably proveably done, thus giving notice like some stark signboard--under that accession of accent the situation itself had turned; and Brydon at last remarkably made up his mind on what it had turned to.|$|E
