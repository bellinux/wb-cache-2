40|$|The {{determination}} of the maximum dynamic responses of a multidegree of freedom mechanical system under earthquake type excitation using mode superposition methods is the general problem considered. The experimental work was carried out using a special purpose <b>electronic</b> <b>differential</b> <b>analyzer</b> involving a three degree of freedom system, or a three mode approximation to a larger system. The results indicate that a suitably weighted average of {{the sum of the}} absolute values and the square root of the sum of the squares of the individual mode contributions gives a practical design criterion for the base shear forces. For critical designs this weighted average reduces to the absolute sum of the modes, which will be close to the true value for a significantly high percentage of the cases. The base moment may be more accurately approximated than the base shear by use of the first mode alone...|$|E
40|$|The {{subject of}} {{transients}} in polyphase induction motors and synchronous machines {{has been studied}} in very great detail by several investigators, but no published literature exists dealing exclusively with {{the analysis of the}} problem of transients in single-phase induction motors. This particular problem has been studied in this paper by applying the Laplace transform. The results of actual computation of the currents and developed electrical torque are compared with the data obtained by setting up the integro-differential equations of the machine on an <b>electronic</b> <b>differential</b> <b>analyzer.</b> It is shown that if the motor is switched on to the supply when the potential passes through its zero value, there is a pulsating fundamental frequency torque superimposed on the average steady-state unidirectional torque. If, on the other hand, the switch is closed when the applied potential passes through its maximum value, the developed electrical torque settles down to its final steady-state value during the first cycle of the supply voltage...|$|E
40|$|An <b>electronic</b> <b>differential</b> <b>analyzer</b> {{capable of}} solving {{ordinary}} differential equations of orders through the sixth, both linear and nonlinear, is described. This analyzer {{has a high}} speed of operation and is extremely flexible with regard to equation parameters and initial conditions. This flexibility permits rapid investigation of wide ranges of equation solutions with regard to periodicity, instabil-ity, and discontinuities. It renders practicable the solution of end-point boundary-value problems, that is, problems in which the final rather than initial values are specified. Two new computing elements, an electronic function generator and an electronic multiplier, are employed in this differential analyzer. A diode clamping circuit permits the use of a-c coupled amplifiers. A number of representative differential equations of the linear and nonlinear types have been solved. Comparison of observed and calculated solutions reveals an accuracy of from 1 to 5 per cent, while the precision (or repeatibility) of the solutions ranges from 0. 002 to 0. 1 per cent. An analysis of the errors introduced into the differen-tial-equation solutions by the frequency limitations of the computing elements, such as the integrators and adders, has been made, {{and the results of}} this analysis have been verified experimentally...|$|E

40|$|This Report, {{the thirteenth}} {{in a series}} of {{quarterly}} progress reports issued by the Research Laboratory of Electronics, contains a review of the research activities of the Laboratory during the three-month period ending March 31, 1949. Since this is a preliminary report only, no results should be considered final. Since the last report was issued, the following interesting or significant results have been obtained. The first ten-centimeter high-power magnetron has operated at almost five megawatts for a period of approximately 50 hours before heater failure. The <b>electronic</b> <b>differential</b> <b>analyzer</b> has been used extensively for the solutions of problems for this Laboratory; of particular interest is the solution of the starting-transient equation of a synchronized magnetron. By the use of magnetic cooling, we have obtained a temperature of 0. 0240 K, a preliminary figure. Plans are being made to move the low-temperature equipment to more suitable quarters in Wing D of Building 20. Meanwhile, the linear accelerator is being transferred to its final position in the same wing, where adequate shielding has been provided. Coincident with this, new improvements are being made in the operation of the Van de Graaff generator and the tuning mechanism for the discharge tube. In the general field of communications research, we have used the auto-correlator for the detection of signals and were able to effect improvements of the order of 30 db in signal-noise ratio - this for signals well below the noise level. A study is being made of the possible use of correlator devices for electro-medical studies. The equipment for the study of conditional probabilities has been completed and the work on pulse-modulation interference has been finished. Contains cover page and an introduction...|$|E

5|$|Starting in 1927, Bush {{constructed}} a <b>differential</b> <b>analyzer,</b> an analog computer that could solve differential equations {{with as many}} as 18 independent variables. This invention arose from previous work performed by Herbert R. Stewart, one of Bush's masters students, who at Bush's suggestion created the integraph, a device for solving first-order differential equations, in 1925. Another student, Harold Hazen, proposed extending the device to handle second-order differential equations. Bush immediately realized the potential of such an invention, for these were much more difficult to solve, but also quite common in physics. Under Bush's supervision, Hazen was able to construct the <b>differential</b> <b>analyzer,</b> a table-like array of shafts and pens that mechanically simulated and plotted the desired equation. Unlike earlier designs that were purely mechanical, the <b>differential</b> <b>analyzer</b> had both electrical and mechanical components. Among the engineers who made use of the <b>differential</b> <b>analyzer</b> was General Electric's Edith Clarke, who used it to solve problems relating to electric power transmission. For developing the <b>differential</b> <b>analyzer,</b> Bush was awarded the Franklin Institute's Louis E. Levy Medal in 1928.|$|R
