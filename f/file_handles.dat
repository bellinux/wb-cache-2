The system transaction hold limit sets the number of system transactions performed during write operations for shared files.|$|E
25|$|The Offline Files feature, which {{maintains}} a client-side cache of files shared over a network, has been significantly improved. When synchronizing {{the changes in}} the cached copy to the remote version, the Bitmap Differential Transfer protocol is used so that only the changed blocks in the cached version are transferred, but when retrieving changes from the remote copy, the entire file is downloaded. are synchronized on a per-share basis and encrypted on a per-user basis and users can force Windows to work in offline mode or online mode or sync manually from the Sync Center. The Sync Center can also report sync errors and resolve sync conflicts. Also, if network connectivity is restored, <b>file</b> <b>handles</b> are redirected to the remote share transparently.|$|E

50|$|Files are {{accessed}} by applications in Windows by using <b>file</b> <b>handles.</b> These <b>file</b> <b>handles</b> can be explored with the Process Explorer utility. This utility {{can also be}} used to force-close handles without needing to terminate the application holding them. This can cause an undefined behavior, since the program will receive an unexpected error when using the force-closed handle and may even operate on an unexpected file since the handle number may be recycled.|$|E

50|$|Prior to AmigaOS 3.5, AmigaDOS <b>file</b> <b>handles</b> {{maintained}} a 32-bit wide offset parameter (unsigned), telling {{where to start}} the next read or write operation. The biggest size for any single Amiga file under these operating systems therefore comes to 232 = 4 GiB. After Amiga OS 3.5, <b>file</b> <b>handles</b> may reference 264 = 16 EiB files. However, OFS-formatted disks continue to retain the 32-bit limitations, for that is an intrinsic limitation of the format as recorded on the media.|$|E

For each open <b>file</b> <b>handle,</b> DOS stores the index into the System File Table (SFT). A <b>file</b> <b>handle</b> that is returned by open, _open and other similar functions is simply an index into the JFT where DOS stored the SFT entry index for the file or device that the program opened.|$|R

A <b>file</b> <b>handle</b> is generally either an opaque data type or an integer, it was introduced in around 1961 by the ALGOL-based Burroughs MCP running on the Burroughs B5000 but is now ubiquitous.|$|R
