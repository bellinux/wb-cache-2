40|$|AbstractThe {{increasing}} of both {{industrialization and}} motorization {{of the world}} has led to a sharp rise in the demand for fossil fuels. Concern about the environmental impact caused by burning of these fuels has involved researchers that became engaged in assessing the damages of pollution not only to environment, but also to human health. In this study, carbonyl compounds (CC) were measured in vapor samples from a place impacted by <b>heavy-duty</b> <b>vehicles</b> (Bus Station) fuelled with diesel/biodiesel fuel blend (B 5) in Salvador, Brazil. Among them, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde and propanone were the most abundant quantified compounds. Concentration levels (ppbV) for major CC detected during the sampling period ranged from 28. 45 to 287. 3 (formaldehyde), 24. 91 to 171. 3 (acetaldehyde) and 5. 835 to 72. 29 (propanone). The obtained data in this site was compared to formaldehyde and acetaldehyde concentrations found in other sites impacted by <b>heavy-duty</b> <b>vehicles</b> fuelled with pure diesel and diesel/biodiesel blends. All data were used to make a possible correlation with formaldehyde/acetaldehyde ratio and the relationship with the kind of fuel used by these vehicles. PCA was used to verify possible grouping among 19 sites impacted by <b>heavy-duty</b> <b>vehicles</b> and showed two major groups, one characterized by being strongly impacted and the other with a low contribution of <b>heavy-duty</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Thus, the addition of higher concentrations of biodiesel to diesel showed an improvement in the carbonyl concentration profile at places with high circulation of <b>heavy-duty</b> <b>vehicles,</b> which had similar profile to those found for sites less impacted by these kind of vehicles...|$|R

The same year, it was renamed Weifang Diesel Engine Works and started research, development and production of diesel engines. From 1955, the Czech 6160 diesel engine was successfully trial-manufactured and became the dominant engine model for China’s coastal fishing and inland shipping. Ten years later, Weichai was {{named one of the}} seventy “Daqing-Type” enterprises, a famous national denomination in terms of industrial production. In 1968, the 6200 marine diesel engine was developed and manufactured for light fishing vessels.In 1970, the National Defense Industry requested Weichai to develop and produce the 8V160 type tank engine. Weichai R&D team successfully developed an 800 hp tank engine and won, in 1978, the National Science Conference Prize. In 1984, the Austrian <b>heavy-duty</b> <b>vehicle</b> engine Steyr WD615 was introduced.

40|$|Particulate matter {{emissions}} from the California in-use vehicle fleet were measured as 37 [*] 500 vehicles traveled through two bores of the Caldecott Tunnel {{located in the}} San Francisco Bay area. Microorifice cascade impactors and filter-based samplers {{were used to determine}} the particle chemical composition as a function of particle size. Ammonia {{emissions from}} the vehicle fleet were measured as well. Concentrations of aerosol mass, organic carbon, elemental carbon, sulfate ion, nitrate ion, and ammonium ion, as well as 13 elements are reported. The particle mass distribution peaks in the particle size range 0. 1 − 0. 18 μm aerodynamic diameter (D_a). Elemental carbon and organic matter were the largest components of particle mass in all the size ranges studied. The Caldecott Tunnel bores studied include one which carries light-duty vehicle traffic and one which carries a mixture of light- and <b>heavy-duty</b> <b>vehicle</b> traffic. From experiments conducted in both bores, estimates are made of the size distribution and chemical composition of particulate matter emissions extrapolated to the 100 % light-duty and 100 % <b>heavy-duty</b> <b>vehicle</b> fleets. The <b>heavy-duty</b> <b>vehicle</b> fleet emitted 1285 ± 237 mg of fine particulate matter (D_a < 1. 9 μm) /kg of C contained in the fuel burned (corresponding to approximately 430 ± 79 mg/km driven). Light-duty vehicles emitted less than 85 ± 6 mg/kg of C in the fuel burned (corresponding to less than approximately 5. 5 ± 0. 4 mg/km driven). Emissions of gas-phase ammonia in the Caldecott Tunnel were measured to be 194 and 267 mg/L of gasoline-equivalent fuel burned in the tunnel. The ammonia emissions are attributed to automobiles that were equipped with 3 -way catalysts and operating fuel rich...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Vehicle {{platooning}} {{is important}} for <b>heavy-duty</b> <b>vehicle</b> manufacturers, due to the reduced aerodynamic drag for the follower vehicles, which gives an overall lower fuel consumption. <b>Heavy-duty</b> <b>vehicle</b> drivers are aware this fact and sometimes drive close to other heavy-duty vehicles. However, it is not currently well known how many vehicles are actually driving in such spontaneous platoons today. This paper studies the platooning rate of 1, 800 heavy-duty vehicles by analyzing sparse vehicle position data from a region in Europe during one day. Map-matching and path-inference algorithms are used to determine which paths the vehicles took. The spontaneous platooning rate {{is found to be}} 1. 2 %, which corresponds to a total fuel saving of 0. 07 % compared to if none of the vehicles were platooning. Furthermore, we introduce several virtual coordination schemes. We show that coordinations can increase the platooning rate and fuel saving with a factor of ten with minor adjustments from the current travel schedule. The platooning rate and fuel savings can be significantly greater if higher flexibility is allowed. I...|$|E

40|$|Heavy-duty {{vehicles}} {{have been}} considered a large fraction of emissions from on-road vehicles, but have become of greater interest, as the light-duty emissions have been controlled {{to a greater extent}} than heavy-duty vehicles. Because a <b>heavy-duty</b> <b>vehicle</b> can produce 10 to 100 times the emissions (of NOx and PM emissions especially) of a light-duty vehicle, <b>heavy-duty</b> <b>vehicle</b> activity needs to be better understood and characterized. One of the key uncertainties with the use of MOBILE 6 includes the fraction of heavy-duty vehicles on all types of roadways at all times of day. This paper describes the analysis of extensive automatic traffic recorder (ATR) data collected by State Departments of Transportation to investigate overall and temporal (hour of day, day of week, and month of year) patterns of vehicle mix by roadway type. A method is described and used to cross-reference the vehicle types identified by ATR data into MOBILE 6 vehicle types and used to estimate fleet emissions. Comparisons will be provided that show the differences in the spatial and temporal emissions estimates by roadway type compared with estimates using the national average fleet mix...|$|E

40|$|A {{parametric}} {{study and}} optimization approaches of a thermoelectric generator (TEG) for {{the recovery of}} energy from the exhaust gas in Diesel vehicles used in freight transport is reported. The TEG is installed in the tailpipe of a commercial vehicle (3. 5 tonnes) and a <b>heavy-duty</b> <b>vehicle</b> (40 tonnes). The exhaust gas is used as the heat source and the cooling water as the heat sink. Two different heat exchanger configurations are considered: plain fins and offset strip fins. The influence of the height, length and spacing of the fins on the electrical and net power is analysed for the fixed width and length of the TEG. The influence of the length and width of the TEG and of {{the height of the}} thermocouple legs is also investigated. According to the criteria used in this study, plain fins are the best choice, yielding a maximum electrical power of 188 W for the commercial vehicle and 886 W for the <b>heavy-duty</b> <b>vehicle.</b> The best recovery efficiency is about 2 %, with an average thermoelectric material efficiency of approximately 4. 4 %, for the light-duty vehicle.
