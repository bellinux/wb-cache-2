50|$|Once {{dedicated}} to repressing all evidence {{of opposition to}} the Franco regime, {{the police and the}} Civil Guard were expected to tolerate forms of conduct previously banned and to protect individual rights conferred by the 1978 Constitution and by subsequent legislation. Members of the Civil Guard continued to be <b>implicated</b> <b>in</b> cases of mistreatment and <b>brutality</b> <b>in</b> the campaign against Basque terrorism. The authorities had, however, prosecuted many guardsmen for such infractions, with the result that by 1988 fewer violations of legal norms were being recorded.|$|R

5000|$|Lars Göran Petrov (born 17 February 1972), often {{abbreviated}} to LG Petrov, is a Swedish singer of Macedonian origin. He {{is best known}} for his work with the band Entombed. In 1991 he was forced to quit Entombed, due to Petrov [...] "making an ill-advised pass" [...] at the girlfriend of Entombed drummer Nicke Andersson. He contributed the vocals for fellow Swedish death metal band Comecon's debut album Megatrends <b>in</b> <b>Brutality.</b> <b>In</b> 1992, he returned to Entombed. He also played drums in Morbid, which featured Mayhem vocalist Per Yngve [...] "Dead" [...] Ohlin in its original line up.|$|R
50|$|Cholinergic {{systems are}} <b>implicated</b> <b>in</b> {{numerous}} neurologic functions. Alteration in some cholinergic neurons {{may account for}} the disturbances of Alzheimer disease. The protein encoded by this gene synthesizes the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Acetylcholine acts at two classes of receptors in the central nervous system - muscarinic and nicotinic - which are each <b>implicated</b> <b>in</b> different physiological responses. The role of acetylcholine at the nicotinic receptor is still under investigation. It is likely <b>implicated</b> <b>in</b> the reward/reinforcement pathways, as indicated by the addictive nature of nicotine, which also binds to the nicotinic receptor. The muscarinic action of acetylcholine in the CNS is <b>implicated</b> <b>in</b> learning and memory. The loss of cholinergic innervation in the neocortex has been associated with memory loss, as is evidenced in advanced cases of Alzheimer's disease. In the peripheral nervous system, cholinergic neurons are <b>implicated</b> <b>in</b> the control of visceral functions such as, but not limited to, cardiac muscle contraction and gastrointestinal tract function.|$|R
