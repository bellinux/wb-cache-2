Stairs lead up to the first floor {{at each end of the}} building. These stairs incorporate heavy timber treads and <b>fine</b> <b>steel</b> sections, which run vertically from floor to ceiling and act as a screen and a support for the balustrade. The end of one of the staircases is expressed to form a decorative zigzag pattern. The first floor ceiling lining follows the zigzag line of the roof, exposing the steel roof structure. This floor contains the original steel framed hopper windows and fixed glass panels along the south wall. The flooring is of mixed hardwood. An elevated link joins this building to the neighbouring Commerce Building and Meat Hall.|$|E

Groats are sized and separated using screens, shakers and indent screens. After the whole oat groats are separated, the remaining broken groats get sized {{again into the}} three groups (coarse, regular, fine), and then stored. [...] "Steel cut" [...] refers to all sized or cut groats. When not enough broken groats are available to size for further processing, whole oat groats are sent to a cutting unit with steel blades that evenly cut groats into the three sizes above.|$|E

Then the evaluation of corrosion resistance property to <b>fine</b> grain <b>steel</b> is very important. In this study, Stress Corrosion Cracking test was done on specimens of the <b>fine</b> grain <b>steel</b> and conventional steel. Afterwards fracture surfaces were observed with SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope) and the residual stresses under the fracture surfaces were measured by X-ray stress measurement. The difference of stress corrosion resistance property between <b>fine</b> grain <b>steel</b> and conventional steel was clarified...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Recently, {{the study}} of <b>fine</b> grain <b>steels</b> aimed at {{achieving}} into high strength has become active. Welding {{is one of the}} most effective methods for connecting the structural components. For those cases, the negative influence of any residual tensile stress induced during the welding process must be considered. It has been proved that shot-peening can effectively solve this problem. However, the influence of the Shot-Peening process on <b>fine</b> grain <b>steels</b> after welding has only been briefly reported up to now. In this study, <b>fine</b> grain <b>steels</b> were used, and specimens were obtained after heat treatment. Residual stress distributions near the surface of the <b>fine</b> grain <b>steel</b> after shot-peening were measured by X-ray diffraction technology. Moreover, the effect of hardness on distributions near the shot-peened surface was also estimated...|$|R
