5|$|Texas' post-score kickoff was {{returned}} to the Tech four-yard line. A two-yard run was followed by an 11-yard carry by Ken Oxendine who earned a <b>first</b> <b>down</b> at the Tech 17-yard line. After the <b>first</b> <b>down,</b> Oxendine earned another six yards. Druckenmiller then completed a 13-yard pass to tight end Bryan Jennings for a <b>first</b> <b>down</b> at the Tech 35-yard line. Texas committed a five-yard offsides penalty, then a long pass downfield fell incomplete. Two more plays failed to gain a <b>first</b> <b>down,</b> and the Hokies punted.|$|E
5|$|After a short gain on <b>first</b> <b>down,</b> Druckenmiller {{completed}} a 13-yard pass to fullback Brian Edmonds. The play {{resulted in a}} <b>first</b> <b>down</b> at the Tech 34-yard line. Two short plays resulted in six yards, setting up a third down and four yards. Rather than attempt a conversion prior {{to the end of}} the quarter, the Hokies let the clock roll down with the Longhorns in the lead, 70.|$|E
5|$|After the missed kick, Cincinnati's offense took to {{the field}} at their 20-yard line. The Bearcats {{were not able to}} gain a <b>first</b> <b>down,</b> however, and went three and out before punting back to Virginia Tech. Following the kick, the Hokies started at their 16-yard line. Tech's first play of the drive was a 14-yard pass from Taylor to wide {{receiver}} Jarrett Boykin for a <b>first</b> <b>down,</b> but the Hokies were unable to gain another <b>first</b> <b>down.</b> Tech punted back to Cincinnati, and the ball rolled out of bounds at the Cincinnati 30-yard line. The first play of the drive resulted in a short loss, but on the second play, Pike completed a 39-yard pass to Gilyard. The play advanced the Bearcats deep into Virginia Tech territory and gave them a <b>first</b> <b>down.</b> Despite the long play, Cincinnati was unable to gain another <b>first</b> <b>down,</b> and Rogers entered the game to attempt a 44-yard field goal. The kick was partially blocked and fell short, denying the Bearcats three points. With 3:07 remaining in the quarter, Cincinnati still held a 7â€“0 lead.|$|E

5|$|After the turnover, North Carolina had a <b>first</b> <b>down</b> at the Tech 34-yard line. Keldorf {{threw an}} eight-yard pass to Crumpler, North Carolina, was {{stopped for a}} one-yard loss on a running play, then the Tar Heels earned a <b>first</b> <b>down</b> with a four-yard run by Geter. On <b>first</b> <b>down,</b> Keldorf threw an {{incomplete}} pass. Second down resulted in a 15-yard gain and a <b>first</b> <b>down</b> on a run by Geter along {{the left side of}} the field. Now at the Tech eight-yard line, Geter ran straight ahead for a five-yard gain. Geter was stopped for a two-yard loss on the next play, but North Carolina recovered from the loss with a five-yard pass from Keldorf to Carrick for a touchdown. The extra point kick was blocked, but a penalty against Virginia Tech allowed Carolina kicker Josh McGee another chance at the extra point. The second attempt was successful, and the kick gave the Tar Heels a 423 lead with 5:01 remaining in the game.|$|E
5|$|Florida State {{began the}} fourth quarter in {{possession}} of the ball and facing a third down, needing three yards for a <b>first</b> <b>down.</b> Weinke completed a pass for {{just short of the}} needed three yards. Instead of punting the ball away, Florida State head coach Bobby Bowden ordered the team to attempt to convert the <b>first</b> <b>down.</b> He brought backup quarterback Marcus Outzen into the game as a misdirection move, and instead of running a quarterback sneak as anticipated, Outzen tossed the ball to Minor, who ran for 16yards and a <b>first</b> <b>down.</b> During the play, Virginia Tech committed a 15-yard personal foul penalty that advanced the ball further and gave Florida State a <b>first</b> <b>down</b> at the Virginia Tech 23-yard line. Weinke returned to the game and threw a 10-yard pass to Chaney for another <b>first</b> <b>down.</b> Weinke threw an incomplete pass, then Tech stopped a rush up the middle for no gain. On third down, Weinke connected on a touchdown pass to Dugans, returning the lead to Florida State. The Seminoles, as had Virginia Tech before them, elected to attempt a two-point conversion. Unlike Virginia Tech's failed two-point conversions, the Seminoles successfully earned two points with a pass to Warrick, and the scores gave Florida State a 3629 lead with 12:59 remaining.|$|E
5|$|Florida State's kickoff was fielded {{inside the}} Virginia Tech five-yard line and {{returned}} to the Tech eight-yard line. Tech gained five yards on two running plays, then Noel completed a 15-yard pass to Davis for a <b>first</b> <b>down</b> at the Tech 28-yard line. Noel and Jones each carried the ball, together gaining enough for a <b>first</b> <b>down</b> at the Tech 39-yard line. A completed pass and a short run by Jones resulted in another <b>first</b> <b>down,</b> this time at the 50-yard line. Florida State committed a five-yard offsides penalty, but the Hokies were unable to gain a <b>first</b> <b>down</b> on the Seminoles' side of the field. Rather than attempt to convert another fourth down, the Hokies punted the ball.|$|E

5|$|Florida State's post-score kickoff {{sailed through}} the end zone for a touchback, and Tech's offense began its first drive of the quarter from its 20-yard line. Tech's first play of the quarter was a 15-yard {{completed}} pass by Noel for a <b>first</b> <b>down.</b> That was followed by an 11-yard run by Jones for another <b>first</b> <b>down.</b> After an incomplete pass, Noel ran for a <b>first</b> <b>down</b> at the State 41-yard line. Inside Florida State territory, gaining ground became much more difficult. The next three plays netted Tech only nine yards, setting up a critical fourth-and-one play. With Virginia Tech outside field goal range and trailing, the Hokies needed another <b>first</b> <b>down</b> to move within potential scoring range. But on fourth down, Jones was stopped for no gain on a running play, and the Hokies turned the ball over on downs. The play later was cited as the game's turning point.|$|E
5|$|Following Georgia Tech's post-score kickoff, Wake Forest {{received}} the ball, {{but failed to}} gain a <b>first</b> <b>down.</b> The Deacons' offense went three and out {{and was forced to}} punt. On Tech's next possession, they too had difficulty moving the football on offense. Though they picked up a <b>first</b> <b>down</b> off of a penalty on Wake Forest, they were unable to gain a <b>first</b> <b>down</b> by their own devices and were forced to punt the ball away.|$|E
5|$|Following Tennessee's post-touchdown kickoff {{and a short}} kick return, the Virginia Tech offense {{began at}} its 24-yard line. The first Tech play of the quarter, a run up the middle by Edmonds, {{resulted}} in a 17-yard gain and a <b>first</b> <b>down.</b> Dwayne Thomas followed Edmonds' run {{with one of his}} own, advancing the ball to the 50-yard line. He pushed into Tennessee territory on the next play, a five-yard run that gave the Hokies a <b>first</b> <b>down</b> at the Tennessee 45-yard line. DeShazo then ran nine yards, and Tech gained a <b>first</b> <b>down</b> on the next play. Inside the Tennessee 35-yard line, however, the Volunteers' defense stiffened. DeShazo passed for a seven-yard gain, but the Hokies were unable to gain a <b>first</b> <b>down</b> until DeShazo scrambled for a 13-yard gain on fourth down. The run kept the Tech drive alive as the Hokies now had a <b>first</b> <b>down</b> at the Tennessee 14-yard line. Tennessee forced another third-down play, but the Hokies gained a <b>first</b> <b>down</b> at the Tennessee three-yard line with a pass from DeShazo to Thomas. Four plays later, the Hokies scored their first points of the game as Thomas dove across the goal line on fourth down. The subsequent extra point was good, and the Hokies cut Tennessee's lead to 217 with 5:17 remaining in the first half.|$|E
25|$|Tech's line held Alabama's Cecil Creen {{in check}} {{throughout}} as it won 130. The Tide gained just 60 {{yards and two}} <b>first</b> <b>downs,</b> while Tech gained 20 <b>first</b> <b>downs</b> and 270 yards.|$|R
50|$|Alabama gained 303 yards {{total yards}} (166 passing and 137 rushing) and {{converted}} 17 <b>first</b> <b>downs.</b> The Warhawks picked up 83 yards {{through the air}} and nine on the ground, along with gaining 10 <b>first</b> <b>downs.</b>|$|R

5|$|Following Tennessee's touchdown, the {{two teams}} traded possessions, each going three and out. Virginia Tech regained the ball after a Tennessee punt to its 20-yard line with 7:31 {{remaining}} in the quarter. After a Tech fumble that was recovered by the Hokies, Tech running back Dwayne Thomas ran nine yards for the first Tech <b>first</b> <b>down</b> of the game. After an incomplete pass, DeShazo and Thomas connected on an eight-yard pass before Thomas broke free for an 11-yard run and another <b>first</b> <b>down.</b> Thomas continued advancing the ball, picking up eight yards on two rushing plays. DeShazo then completed a four-yard pass for a <b>first</b> <b>down</b> at the Tennessee 39-yard line. There, however, Tennessee's defense stiffened and did not allow the Hokies another <b>first</b> <b>down.</b> The Tech punt was downed at the Tennessee 7-yard line, where the Volunteers began their third possession of the game.|$|E
5|$|Following the Florida State kickoff, Virginia Tech {{attempted}} to answer Florida State's kick-return touchdown {{with one of}} its own. Kendrick fielded the ball at the Virginia Tech goal line and returned it 63 yards, {{all the way to}} the Florida State 37-yard line, where the Hokie offense began work. Despite the good field position, Tech was unable to gain a <b>first</b> <b>down.</b> Tech kicker Shayne Graham was sent into the game, seemingly to attempt a 51-yard field goal. Instead of kicking the ball, Graham {{attempted to}} run the ball for a <b>first</b> <b>down.</b> Graham fumbled short of the <b>first</b> <b>down,</b> and Florida State took over on offense with 9:43 remaining in the first half.|$|E
5|$|Following the turnover, Clemson {{received}} {{the ball at}} its 28-yard line. Simmons ran the ball straight ahead for an eight-yard gain, gained one yard on a run, then Kelly ran for a <b>first</b> <b>down</b> at the 40-yard line. On <b>first</b> <b>down,</b> Simmons completed an 18-yard pass to Gardner at the Tech 42-yard line. Simmons then completed a six-yard pass before throwing a shovel pass to Kelly for a <b>first</b> <b>down</b> at the Tech 32-yard line. An incomplete pass was followed by six-yard toss and a pass to Watts at the 12-yard line. Simmons ran out of bounds for a two-yard loss, then completed a touchdown pass to Gardner. The extra point kick was good, and Clemson closed Virginia Tech's lead to 3420 with 7:19 remaining.|$|E
50|$|Friends {{accumulated}} 630 {{yards of}} total offense with 27 <b>first</b> <b>downs</b> and held Kansas Wesleyan to 148 yards and 4 <b>first</b> <b>downs.</b> Friends {{also managed to}} convert 3 for 3 on fourth down attempts. The final score was 63-26.|$|R

5|$|Following the turnover, Indiana's offense {{began work}} at its 32-yard line. Despite the {{opportunity}} {{presented by the}} interception, the Hoosiers were unable to gain a <b>first</b> <b>down</b> and punted back to Virginia Tech. Tech's Steve Sanders returned the kick to the Tech 27-yard line, and Tech's offense returned to the field. The Hokie offense was no more successful than Indiana's had been, and Tech punted after going three and out. Following the kick and a short return, the Hoosiers began work at their 41-yard line. After being stopped for no gain on two consecutive plays, Paci completed a long pass to Tech's 40-yard line for the Hoosiers' first <b>first</b> <b>down</b> of the second half. Indiana continued advancing the ball via short passes, but came up oneyard short of a <b>first</b> <b>down.</b> Instead of punting on fourth down, Indiana attempted to gain the <b>first</b> <b>down</b> via a rush up the middle. Tech's defense held fast, and Indiana turned the ball over after failing to gain the needed yard.|$|E
5|$|Indiana's defense {{also held}} fast {{on the next}} possession, and Tech was unable to gain a <b>first</b> <b>down</b> {{following}} the turnover. Tech's punt was returned to the Indiana 38-yard line, where the Hoosier offense returned to the field. At first, the Hoosiers were successful moving the ball as they picked up a <b>first</b> <b>down</b> in Tech territory via a pass from Paci. The success was short-lived, however, as the Hoosiers were unable to gain a <b>first</b> <b>down</b> once on the Tech {{side of the field}} and had to punt. Sanders returned the kick to the Tech 21-yard line, where Tech began its third possession of the second half. Tech picked up a <b>first</b> <b>down</b> via two DeShazo passes, but couldn't gain another. Tech's punt was downed at the Indiana 20-yard line, and Indiana's offense began work with 3:02 remaining in the quarter.|$|E
5|$|Linton ran {{for nine}} yards, {{then picked up}} a <b>first</b> <b>down</b> with a five-yard gain on second down. Keldorf {{completed}} a 12-yard pass to Barnes for a <b>first</b> <b>down,</b> Linton ran seven yards to the Carolina 43-yard line, then gained another <b>first</b> <b>down</b> with a run to the 50-yard line. From midfield, Keldorf attempted a deep pass on <b>first</b> <b>down,</b> but the ball fell incomplete. On second down, Keldorf completed a four-yard pass to Linton but was sacked on third down by the Virginia Tech defense. The sack forced Carolina to punt {{for the second time}} in the game, and the ball rolled out of bounds at the Virginia Tech 11-yard line.|$|E
50|$|Saint Xavier {{posted on}} 408 yards of total offense and 22 <b>first</b> <b>downs</b> while holding MidAmerica Nazarene to just 281 yards and 12 <b>first</b> <b>downs.</b> Saint Xavier scored 16 {{points in the}} final quarter towards the final score of 29 - 14.|$|R

5|$|Stanford {{returned}} the game's opening kickoff to its 24-yard line, where the Cardinal offense began the game's first possession. On the game's first play, Stanford quarterback Andrew Luck ran 11yards through the Virginia Tech defense for a <b>first</b> <b>down.</b> The success was short-lived, however, as Stanford's next three plays did not gain enough ground for another <b>first</b> <b>down,</b> {{and the team}} punted from its 37-yard line. Virginia Tech's first possession was no more successful than Stanford's had been. The Hokies' offense entered the game at its 31-yard line after the punt, but went three-and-out after failing to gain a <b>first</b> <b>down.</b>|$|E
5|$|Tech's post-touchdown kickoff bounced to the Clemson two-yard line {{before it}} was {{returned}} to the Clemson 12-yard line. An incomplete pass on <b>first</b> <b>down</b> {{was followed by a}} first-down pass to Gardner at the 22-yard line. Dantzler then completed a pass to Watts at the 34-yard line for another <b>first</b> <b>down.</b> After an incomplete pass, Dantzler scrambled for a <b>first</b> <b>down</b> at the Clemson 47-yard line, where he completed a 17-yard pass to Robinson as time ticked below one minute remaining. From the Tech 36-yard line, Dantzler completed a pass to Gardner at the Tech 29-yard line. After a time out with 33 seconds remaining, Dantzler threw an incomplete pass. This was followed by another incomplete pass, and Clemson converted the <b>first</b> <b>down</b> with a pass to the Tech 24-yard line. An incomplete pass on <b>first</b> <b>down</b> was followed by another on second down. Following the play, there was only eight seconds left on the clock, and coach Bowden ordered Hunt into the game to attempt a 41-yard field goal. The kick was short and to the right, and Clemson turned the ball over with two seconds remaining. Vick took a knee to run the final seconds off the clock, and Virginia Tech entered halftime with a 2110 lead.|$|E
5|$|Tennessee {{attempted}} to answer Tech's score in its following possession. The Hokies' kickoff {{resulted in a}} touchback, so the Volunteers began from their 20-yard line. Montario Hardesty gained a <b>first</b> <b>down</b> with a 10-yard run, then Crompton gained another <b>first</b> <b>down</b> with an 11-yard pass. Tennessee continued to advance on running plays and a 14-yard pass by Crompton, pushing the ball inside the Tech 30-yard line. Once there, however, the Hokies rallied by sacking Crompton for a seven-yard loss. A two-yard run and an incomplete pass kept Tennessee from gaining another <b>first</b> <b>down,</b> setting up a fourth down. Rather than try an offensive play and possibly gain a <b>first</b> <b>down</b> or turn the ball over on downs, Tennessee punted, forcing Virginia Tech's offense to start from its 11-yard line.|$|E
50|$|McPherson's 523 {{yards of}} total offense {{helped them to}} achieve 31 <b>first</b> <b>downs</b> and succeed at 8 out 15 third down conversions.
