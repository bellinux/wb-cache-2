Near Le Touquet at 15:15 and around 20,000 feet, Johnson's section was bounced by 30 Bf 109s. Johnson broke and turned in and behind a Bf 109F. Approaching from a quarter astern and slightly below, Johnson fired closing from 200 to 70 yards. Pilot Officer Smith of Johnson's section observed the pilot bail out. Pursued by several enemy aircraft, Johnson dived to ground level. About 10 miles off Le Touquet, other Bf 109s attacked. Allowing the Germans to close within range, Johnson turned into a steep left-hand turn. It took him onto {{the tail of a}} Bf 109. Johnson fired and broke away at 50 yards. The Bf 109 was hit, stalled and crashed into the sea. Johnson was pursued until 10 miles south of Dover. The two victories made Johnson's total to six destroyed, which now meant he was an official flying ace. In winter 1941, Johnson and 616 Squadron moved to training duties.

However, garbage collection (GC) in SSD introduces significant latencies and large performance variations, which renders widespread adoption of SSDs difficult. To address this issue, we present a novel garbage collection strategy, consisting of two components, called Advanced Garbage Collection (AGC) and Delayed Garbage Collection (DGC), that operate collectively to migrate GC operations from busy <b>periods</b> to <b>idle</b> <b>periods.</b> More specifically, AGC is employed to defer GC operations to <b>idle</b> <b>periods</b> in advance, based on the type of the <b>idle</b> <b>periods</b> and on-demand GC needs, whereas DGC complements AGC by handling the collections that could not be handled by AGC. Our comprehensive experimental analysis reveals that the proposed strategies provide stable SSD performance by significantly reducing GC overheads.

The incorporation of these I/O devices has increased the overall power envelope of these platforms.

Since battery technologies alone have been unable to provide the lifetimes required by many platforms, in order to conserve energy, most devices provide the ability to transition into low power states during <b>idle</b> <b>periods.</b> The resulting energy savings are heavily dependent upon the lengths and number of <b>idle</b> <b>periods</b> experienced by a device.

40|$|Abstract. The power {{consumption}} of peripheral devices {{is a significant}} portion of the overall energy usage of a mobile platform. To take advantage of idle times, most devices offer the ability to transition into low power states.

This paper describes a new process scheduling algorithm which accumulates device usage information in the form of device windows to make power a first class resource: it attempts to increase the burstiness of both device accesses and <b>idle</b> <b>periods,</b> and it provides enhanced behavior for timeout-based sleep mechanisms. An initial implementation based on the default Linux scheduler demonstrates the algorithm’s and approach’s ability to reduce the average {{power consumption}} of devices by increasing device sleep times and reducing transition overheads. ...|$|R
