25|$|In 1949 Djerassi became {{associate}} {{director of research at}} Syntex in Mexico City and remained there through 1951. He has said that one factor influencing him to choose Syntex was that they had a DU spectrophotometer. He worked on a new synthesis of cortisone based on <b>diosgenin,</b> a steroid sapogenin derived from a Mexican wild yam. His team later synthesized norethisterone (norethindrone), the first highly active progestin analogue that was effective when taken by mouth. This became part of one of the first successful combined oral contraceptive pills, known colloquially as the birth-control pill, or simply, the Pill. From 1952–1959 he was professor of chemistry at Wayne State University in Detroit.|$|E
25|$|In 1939, Russell Marker, a {{professor}} of organic chemistry at Pennsylvania State University, developed a method of synthesizing progesterone from plant steroid sapogenins, initially using sarsapogenin from sarsaparilla, which proved too expensive. After three years of extensive botanical research, he discovered a much better starting material, the saponin from inedible Mexican yams (Dioscorea mexicana and Dioscorea composita) found in the rain forests of Veracruz near Orizaba. The saponin could be converted in the lab to its aglycone moiety <b>diosgenin.</b> Unable to interest his research sponsor Parke-Davis in the commercial potential of synthesizing progesterone from Mexican yams, Marker left Penn State and in 1944 co-founded Syntex with two partners in Mexico City. When he left Syntex a year later the trade of the barbasco yam had started and {{the period of the}} heyday of the Mexican steroid industry had been started. Syntex broke the monopoly of European pharmaceutical companies on steroid hormones, reducing the price of progesterone almost 200-fold over the next eight years.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{unregulated}} topical progesterone products contain [...] "wild yam extract" [...] {{derived from}} Dioscorea villosa, {{but there is}} no evidence that the human body can convert its active ingredient (<b>diosgenin,</b> the plant steroid that is chemically converted to produce progesterone industrially) into progesterone.|$|E
2500|$|Because of {{its high}} {{biodiversity}} Mexico {{has also been a}} frequent site of bioprospecting by international research bodies. The first highly successful instance being the discovery in 1947 of the tuber [...] "Barbasco" [...] (Dioscorea composita) which has a high content of <b>diosgenin,</b> revolutionizing the production of synthetic hormones in the 1950s and 1960s and eventually leading to the invention of combined oral contraceptive pills.|$|E
2500|$|Manufacturing - both bioidentical and nonbioidentical hormones are {{synthesized}} {{using the}} same chemical precursors; <b>diosgenin</b> is extracted from soy or yam plants, converted into progesterone and used as a hormone chemical precursor to create the final product. [...] "Natural" [...] {{is also used to}} promote the idea of being unmodified, and containing the [...] "goodness" [...] of a pure substance. However, this argument simultaneously draws upon a scientific discourse and methodology; even hormones called [...] "bioidentical" [...] have been heavily processed and converted in a pharmaceutical lab. [...] Premarin (conjugated estrogens extracted from the urine of pregnant horses) contains the only truly [...] "natural" [...] hormonesnatural in the sense of being completely unmodified beyond blending the estrogens to achieve a specific ratio.|$|E

50|$|At the {{processing}} plants the tuber is inspected, washed and chopped up, and mixed {{with water to}} produce a thick paste. The paste is then put into fermentation vats where it remains several days, after which it is taken out and sun dried on a concrete floor where it is turned by workers using rakes. In the process of drying the paste crystallizes into <b>diosgenin</b> granules, also called flour. The flour is then bagged and sent to laboratories where the <b>diosgenin</b> content is measured and the price {{is calculated based on}} the <b>diosgenin</b> percentage, which varies from 4%-6%.|$|E
50|$|The tubers {{of certain}} wild yam, {{a variant of}} kokoro yam and other species of Dioscorea, such as Dioscorea nipponica, are a source for the {{extraction}} of <b>diosgenin,</b> a steroid sapogenin.

5000|$|Dioscorea mexicana {{ranges from}} the state of San Luis Potosí in northeastern Mexico south to Panama. [...] It is notable for its {{production}} of <b>diosgenin,</b> which is a precursor for the synthesis of hormones such as progesterone. Russell Marker developed the extraction and manufacture of hormones from D. mexicana at Syntex. Later the Mexican barbasco trade focused instead on Dioscorea composita instead, as this variety has a higher <b>diosgenin</b> content.|$|E
5000|$|Sarsasapogenin was too {{expensive}} to be a commercial precursor to other steroids, so Marker set about looking for richer sources of sapogenins which were {{more closely related to}} progesterone. He identified one candidate in Trillium erectum ("Beth root" [...] or [...] "Wake-robin"), a sapogenin called <b>diosgenin</b> which had previously been found in Japanese yams (Dioscorea tokoro). Marker showed that both sarsasapogenin and <b>diosgenin</b> could be converted into both progesterone and other steroid hormones. The quantities of <b>diosgenin</b> that could be extracted from T. erectum were still unsatisfactory, so Marker looked for richer sources. He eventually hit upon another species of Dioscorea, a Mexican yam known locally as cabeza de negro, whose tubers were reported to grow up to 100 kg (220 lbs) in weight.|$|E
50|$|Many other Dioscorea {{species of}} the yam family contain steroidal {{substances}} from which progesterone can be produced. Among the more notable of these are Dioscorea villosa and Dioscorea polygonoides. One study showed that the Dioscorea villosa contains 3.5% <b>diosgenin.</b> Dioscorea polygonoides {{has been found to}} contain 2.64% <b>diosgenin</b> as shown by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Many of the Dioscorea species that originate from the yam family grow in countries that have tropical and subtropical climates.|$|E
50|$|In {{at least}} one plant, Juglans regia, {{progesterone}} has been detected. In addition, progesterone-like steroids are found in Dioscorea mexicana. Dioscorea mexicana is a plant {{that is part of}} the yam family native to Mexico. It contains a steroid called <b>diosgenin</b> that is taken from the plant and is converted into progesterone. <b>Diosgenin</b> and progesterone are also found in other Dioscorea species, as well as in other plants that are not closely related, such as fenugreek.|$|E

50|$|<b>Diosgenin,</b> a steroidal sapogenin, is {{reported}} from S. menispermoidea. Other active compounds reported from various greenbrier species are parillin (also sarsaparillin or smilacin), sarsapic acid, sarsapogenin and sarsaponin.|$|E
50|$|Dioscorea composita, or barbasco, is {{a species}} of yam in the genus Dioscorea, native to Mexico. It is notable for {{its role in the}} {{production}} of <b>diosgenin,</b> which is a precursor for the synthesis of hormones such as progesterone. Russell Marker developed the extraction and manufacture of hormones from D. mexicana at Syntex, starting the trade of D. composita in Mexico. Marker also discovered that the composita variety had a much higher content of <b>diosgenin</b> than the mexicana variety, and therefore it came to replace the latter in the production of synthetic hormones.|$|E
50|$|Syntex chemists {{synthesized}} cortisone from <b>diosgenin,</b> a phytosteroid {{contained in}} Mexican yams. This synthesis was more economical {{than the previous}} Merck & Co. synthesis, which started with bile acids.|$|E
50|$|Dioscorea zingiberensis, is {{a species}} of yam, a {{tuberous}} root vegetable. It has been cultivated in China {{for the production of}} <b>diosgenin,</b> an important pharmaceutical intermediate for the synthesis of steroid hormones.|$|E
50|$|The seed {{contains}} 30-48% fixed (non-volatile) oil, {{like the}} leaves, fruit pulp, bark and roots, and contains the sapogenins <b>diosgenin</b> and yamogenin. Saponins likewise {{occur in the}} roots, bark wood and fruit.|$|E
50|$|Phytosteroids, {{also known}} as plant steroids, are {{naturally}} occurring steroids that are found in plants. Examples include digoxin, digitoxin, <b>diosgenin,</b> and guggulsterone, as well as phytosterols like β-sitosterol and other phytoestrogens like isoflavones.|$|E
50|$|Anubis baboons (Papio anubis) and hamadryas baboons (Papio hamadryas) in Ethiopia use {{fruits and}} leaves of Balanites aegyptiaca to control schistosomiasis. Its fruits contain <b>diosgenin,</b> a hormone {{precursor}} that presumably hinders {{the development of}} schistosomes.|$|E
50|$|Another {{plant that}} {{contains}} substances readily convertible to progesterone is Dioscorea pseudojaponica native to Taiwan. Research {{has shown that}} the Taiwanese yam contains saponins — steroids that can be converted to <b>diosgenin</b> and thence to progesterone.|$|E
50|$|<b>Diosgenin</b> is a {{precursor}} for several hormones, {{starting with the}} Marker degradation process. This includes progesterone which in turn was used in early combined oral contraceptive pills. The unmodified steroid has estrogenic activity and can reduce the level of serum cholesterol.|$|E
50|$|The semisynthesis {{of steroids}} often begins from {{precursors}} such as cholesterol, phytosterols, or sapogenins. The efforts of Syntex, a company {{involved in the}} Mexican barbasco trade, used Dioscorea mexicana to produce the sapogenin <b>diosgenin</b> {{in the early days}} of the synthetic steroid pharmaceutical industry.|$|E
50|$|Marker {{was able}} to convert sarsasapogenin into pregane-3,20-diol (a {{progesterone}} analogue) and testosterone. However, for large scale production of steroid hormones, it proved more convenient to use <b>diosgenin</b> (extracted from the Mexican yam Dioscorea mexicana) as the starting material, as it contains a double bond in the steroid nucleus.|$|E
50|$|Corticosteroids {{have been}} used as drug {{treatment}} for some time. Lewis Sarett of Merck & Co. was the first to synthesize cortisone, using a complicated 36-step process that started with deoxycholic acid, which was extracted from ox bile. The low efficiency of converting deoxycholic acid into cortisone led to a cost of US $200 per gram. Russell Marker, at Syntex, discovered a much cheaper and more convenient starting material, <b>diosgenin</b> from wild Mexican yams. His conversion of <b>diosgenin</b> into progesterone by a four-step process now known as Marker degradation was an important step in mass production of all steroidal hormones, including cortisone and chemicals used in hormonal contraception. In 1952, D.H. Peterson and H.C. Murray of Upjohn developed a process that used Rhizopus mold to oxidize progesterone into a compound that was readily converted to cortisone. The ability to cheaply synthesize large quantities of cortisone from the <b>diosgenin</b> in yams resulted in a rapid drop in price to US $6 per gram, falling to $0.46 per gram by 1980. Percy Julian's research also aided progress in the field. The exact nature of cortisone's anti-inflammatory action remained a mystery for years after, however, until the leukocyte adhesion cascade and the role of phospholipase A2 in the production of prostaglandins and leukotrienes was fully understood in the early 1980s.|$|E
