40|$|Abstract—Brain {{consists}} of {{left and right}} cerebral hemispheres. Left cerebral hemisphere controls {{right side of the}} body and right cerebral hemisphere controls left side of the body. Brain affects learning greatly; it's the control center of the body. There are three types of learning styles: visual, auditory, and kinesthetic. Visual learners learn by seeing things, auditory learners learn by hearing things, and kinesthetic learners learn by doing things. These bring to the question: is there a correlation between brain <b>dominations</b> <b>and</b> learning styles? This research establishes an efficient, reliable passage to determine human's learning style and presents the correlation between the two factors, brain <b>dominations</b> <b>and</b> learning styles...|$|R

5|$|The Ottoman–Russian {{occupation}} prolonged itself until 1851, {{while the}} 1849 Convention of Balta Liman awarded the Wallachian crown to Barbu Dimitrie Știrbei. In {{contrast to the}} 18481849 setbacks, the period inaugurated by the Crimean War disestablished both Russian <b>domination</b> <b>and</b> the Regulamentul Organic regime, and, within the space of one generation, brought about the fulfillment of virtually all revolutionary projects. The common actions of Moldavians and Wallachians, in pace {{with the presence of}} Wallachian activists in Transylvania, helped circulate the ideal of national unity, with the ultimate goal of reuniting all majority-Romanian territories within one state.|$|E
5|$|After {{defeating}} Sicumba, Alvarado led {{his army}} to the Indian village of Choloma, {{in the general}} region of Puerto de Caballos. On 27 June 1536, Pedro de Alvarado founded a Spanish town beside the Indian settlement, {{with the name of}} Villa de Señor San Pedro de Puerto Caballos (modern San Pedro Sula). The new town had 35 Spanish citizens, and Alvarado allocated 200 of his slaves to help build the new town and work the surrounding fields. He sent out expeditions into outlying regions to secure the new town, extend the area of Spanish <b>domination,</b> <b>and</b> commandeer supplies. Alvarado annulled all encomienda rights established in the area under Cerezeda, and reassigned the villages to the citizens of San Pedro.|$|E
40|$|Today, {{uncontrolled}} {{exploitation of}} ground water has doubled water scarcity problem, while proper control {{and management of}} these resources can solve water shortage problem to some extent. One of the approaches for managing groundwater resources is artificial recharging of groundwater and determining the best location for this. This study aimed at ranking Shahroud–Bastam watershed using ELECTRE and linear assignment methods {{and the results of}} these two methods are compared. These two models are of multiple-criteria decision making compensation and coordinated subgroup models. The findings indicate that among the seven zones in ELECTRE method mentioned above, zones (3, 4, 5) with four <b>dominations</b> <b>and</b> 2 defeats and 2 points are in the first ranking and are the most suitable zones for artificial recharge. Zone (1) with six defeats <b>and</b> no <b>dominations</b> <b>and</b> (- 6) points is in the last ranking and is not suitable for artificial recharge of ground water. Zones (2, 6, 7) respectively with (2, 2, 1) <b>dominations</b> <b>and</b> (4, 4, 5) defeats and with (- 2,- 2,- 4) points are in the next rankings respectively. Zones (1, 2, 6, 7) must be removed because the number of their defeats is more than the number of their <b>dominations</b> <b>and</b> have negative points. In linear assignment method, among 7 zones, zone 3 has the first rank and is the best zone for artificial recharge and zone 7 is in the last ranking and is not suitable for artificial recharge.

5|$|During {{the rule}} of the {{succeeding}} Hanoverian dynasty, power was gradually exercised more by parliament and the government. The first Hanoverian monarch, George I, relied on his ministers {{to a greater extent than}} had previous monarchs. Later Hanoverian monarchs attempted to restore royal control over legislation: George III and George IV both openly opposed Catholic Emancipation and asserted that to grant assent to a Catholic emancipation bill would violate the Coronation Oath, which required the sovereign to preserve and protect the established Church of England from Papal <b>domination,</b> <b>and</b> would grant rights to individuals who were in league with a foreign power which did not recognise their legitimacy. However, George IV reluctantly granted his assent upon the advice of his ministers. Thus, as the concept of ministerial responsibility has evolved, the power to withhold royal assent has fallen into disuse, both in the United Kingdom and in the other Commonwealth realms.|$|E
5|$|In {{a speech}} at the Berlin Geographical Society in 1919, Detzner claimed that the natives of New Guinea had opposed Australian <b>domination</b> <b>and</b> {{resisted}} a military recruitment that amounted to slavery, that even the English plantation holders wished to remain independent of Australia, and that the natives were collecting money to build a war memorial for the Germans. The report on Detzner's speech, transmitted from a news agency in London, caused a small flutter in Australian government circles, but generally was dismissed; an earlier report by the Australian judiciary had absolved the Australian force of improper recruiting or treatment of the New Guineans. An angry letter to the editor from another Australian source, who claimed to have been in service in Morobe from 1914–1915, received little attention.|$|E
5|$|Montejo the Younger next {{sent his}} cousin to Chauaca {{where most of}} the eastern lords greeted him in peace. The Cochua Maya {{resisted}} fiercely but were soon defeated by the Spanish. The Cupul Maya also rose up against the newly imposed Spanish <b>domination,</b> <b>and</b> also their opposition was quickly put down. Montejo continued to the eastern Ekab province, reaching the east coast at Pole. Stormy weather prevented the Spanish from crossing to Cozumel, and nine Spaniards drowned in the attempted crossing. Another Spanish conquistador was killed by hostile Maya. Rumours of this setback grew in the telling and both the Cupul and Cochua provinces once again rose up against their would-be European overlords. The Spanish hold on the eastern portion of the peninsula remained tenuous and a number of Maya polities remained independent, including Chetumal, Cochua, Cupul, Sotuta and the Tazes.|$|E

5|$|The battle-damaged Temeraire {{was almost}} {{immediately}} dry-docked in Portsmouth to undergo substantial repairs, which eventually lasted sixteen months and cost £25,352. She finally left the dockyard in mid-1807, {{now under the}} command of Captain Sir Charles Hamilton. Having fitted her for sea, Hamilton sailed to the Mediterranean in September and joined the fleet blockading the French in Toulon. The service was largely uneventful, and Temeraire returned to Britain in April 1808 to undergo repairs at Plymouth. During her time in Britain the strategic situation in Europe changed as Spain rebelled against French <b>domination</b> <b>and</b> entered the war against France. Temeraire sailed in June to join naval forces operating off the Spanish coast in support of anti-French forces in the Peninsular War.|$|E
5|$|The team {{began work}} on the {{expansion}} in summer 1998, but the task became complicated by Epic's organizational structure. During the development of Unreal, the team members at Digital Extremes were working in Ontario, Canada, while the members at Epic were based in North Carolina, United States, requiring regular travel to Ontario. To remedy this, Epic decided to centralize the teams in Raleigh, North Carolina, and by September, work on the expansion could begin. Lead programmer Steve Polge set about laying the foundations for the new game types, such as Capture the Flag and <b>Domination,</b> <b>and</b> level designers created {{the first round of}} maps for testing. The content grew quickly, and soon the team realized that it had underestimated the task. In November, after a meeting with publisher GT Interactive, Mark Rein suggested releasing the work as a standalone game instead of an expansion. The team was reticent at first, but soon accepted the idea, and in December the game became known internally as Unreal: Tournament Edition.|$|E
5|$|When {{drafting}} the Belarus Constitution, the Supreme Soviet deputies {{were influenced by}} the constitutions of various countries, including Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Sweden, and the United States. Internally, the Constitution {{was influenced by the}} period of Soviet <b>domination</b> <b>and</b> a desire to bring back traditions brushed aside by the Soviet Government. The structure of the Constitution is similar to the Russian Federation: for example, the office of the President has powers analogous to those granted to the President of Russia. Overall, the Constitution sought to preserve the statehood of Belarus from pro-Russian unity movements, provide a strong head of state that could cure the ailments Belarus would endure in the post-Soviet era, and lay out a compromise between the political factions in Belarus.|$|E

5|$|At {{the urging}} of both Yeesha and Esher, the player travels across four Ages, {{collecting}} four slates that unlock the tablet's power. Esher occasionally appears in the Ages to offer his counsel, or reveal the histories of his people and the worlds the player explores. Once all four slates are collected, Esher requests that the player bring the tablet {{to him in the}} now-unlocked Age of Myst. The player is then returned to K'veer, where they have four possible choices. Travelling to Myst without the tablet will cause Esher to angrily abandon the player with no way out. If Esher is given the tablet, he will explain he wishes to use the tablet for <b>domination,</b> <b>and</b> will also leave the player trapped. If the player gives the tablet to Yeesha, the tablet simply slips through her hands and disappears into the ground; she walks away, disappointed, leaving the player trapped in D'ni. The only good ending involves giving the Bahro the tablet, ending their enslavement. Arriving at Releeshahn, the new home Age of the D'ni, Yeesha and Atrus thank the player and speak of a new chapter for the D'ni people; Esher is handed over to the Bahro to be punished for his crimes. The game ends on a visit to Releeshahn.|$|E
5|$|In the Islamic East, the Caliph {{was forced}} to {{acknowledge}} {{the reality of the}} Saffarids' <b>domination</b> <b>and</b> established a modus vivendi with them, perhaps hoping, according to Hugh Kennedy, to harness them in a partnership analogous to that which the Tahirids had enjoyed in previous decades. Consequently, the Saffarids were recognized in their possession of Khurasan and eastern Persia as well as Fars, while the Abbasids were to exercise direct control over western Persia, namely Jibal, Rayy and Isfahan. This policy gave the Caliph a free hand to recover the territories of the Dulafids, another semi-independent local dynasty that was centred on Isfahan and Nihavand. When the Dulafid Ahmad ibn Abd al-Aziz ibn Abi Dulaf died in 893, al-Mu'tadid moved swiftly to install his son al-Muktafi as governor in Rayy, Qazvin, Qum and Hamadan. The Dulafids were confined to their core region around Karaj and Isfahan, before being deposed outright in 896. Nevertheless, the Abbasid hold over these territories remained precarious, especially due to the proximity of the Zaydi emirate in Tabaristan, and in 897 Rayy was handed over to Saffarid control.|$|E
