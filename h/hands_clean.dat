25|$|Pontifical gloves are liturgical {{ornaments}} {{used primarily}} by the pope, the cardinals, and bishops. They may be worn only at the celebration of mass. The liturgical use of gloves has not been traced beyond {{the beginning of the}} 10th century, and their introduction may have been due to a simple desire to keep the <b>hands</b> <b>clean</b> for the holy mysteries, but others suggest that they were adopted as part of the increasing pomp with which the Carolingian bishops were surrounding themselves. From the Frankish kingdom the custom spread to Rome, where liturgical gloves are first heard of in the earlier half of the 11th century.|$|E

40|$|One of the {{earliest}} formulations, and a broadly accepted expression, of the <b>clean</b> <b>hands</b> maxim in the law of equity is that in Dering v Earl of Winchelsea [1775 - 1802] All ER Rep 140; (1787) 1 Cox Eq Cas 318; 29 ER 1184, where it was held: "[A] man must come into a court of equity with <b>clean</b> <b>hands,</b> but when this is said it does not refer to a general depravity; it must have an immediate and necessary connection to the equity sued for; {{it must be a}} depravity in a legal as well as in a moral sense. " As equity has matured, and the body of equitable precedent has developed, numerous inclusionary and exclusionary sub-rules and interpretations have been expressed that purport to refine and constrain the circumstances in which the <b>clean</b> <b>hands</b> maxim will apply. An analysis of the sub-rules and interpretations reveals that they are frequently too restrictive, and at times inconsistent with the principle underlying the <b>clean</b> <b>hands</b> maxim. Further, it is apparent that the framework that has been built around the Dering formulation does not adequately house all aspects of <b>clean</b> <b>hands.</b> This thesis proposes that the Dering formulation is not suitable as a complete expression of <b>clean</b> <b>hands</b> and that many of the sub-rules and interpretations are of limited value, if any, in guiding judicial decision making. This thesis further proposes a more modern formulation of circumstances in which <b>clean</b> <b>hands</b> applies that is consistent with the discretionary nature of the defence, the variety of circumstances in which <b>clean</b> <b>hands</b> applies, and the maxims’ underlying principle...|$|R
