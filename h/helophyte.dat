Flumes, designed to simulate intermittent river conditions, were planted {{with three different}} species of helophytes widely used in river restoration around the water-stressed regions of Europe. Different species of vegetation had different capabilities to reduce the invertebrates negative reaction on inundation, related mostly to rhizosphere density. Of the three <b>helophyte</b> species tested, only one, Lysimachia vulgaris, showed significant capabilities to reduce invertebrate negative reaction on inundation. Species richness of invertebrates {{before and after the}} inundation did not change in any of the flumes, while species density significantly declined in all flumes except one planted with L. vulgaris. This <b>helophyte</b> species was associated with high densities of the Culicidae larvae (common mosquitos) which has severe implications for river restoration and vector management in the region.

Relationships between species composition of gastropod assemblages and environmental variables (water and sediment characteristics) were assessed at the between-pool level. With 18 aquatic gastropod species recorded, the present study, although relatively limited in its scope (70 individual samples taken once), encompassed nearly 70 % of the gastropod species available in this wetland and half of those of Switzerland. Significant differences were observed at all three spatial levels considered, in terms of species richness and individual species abundances. However, the habitat level seemed to be a major source of heterogeneity in the assemblages. <b>Helophyte</b> stands had denser and richer gastropod assemblages.

Wastewater {{treatment}} plant (WWTP) effluents are sources of {{dissolved organic carbon}} (DOC) and inorganic nitrogen (DIN) to receiving streams, which can eventually become saturated by excess of DIN. Aquatic plants (i. e., <b>helophytes)</b> can modify subsurface water flowpaths as well as assimilate nutrients and enhance microbial activity in the rhizosphere, yet their ability to increase DIN transformation and removal in WWTP-influenced streams is poorly understood. We examined the influence of <b>helophytes</b> on DIN removal along subsurface water flowpaths and how this was associated with DOC removal and labile C availability. To do so, we used a set of 12 flow-through flumes fed with water from aWWTP effluent. The flumes contained solely sediments or sediments with <b>helophytes.</b> Presence of <b>helophytes</b> in the flumes enhanced both DIN and DOC removal. Experimental addition of a labile C source into the flumes resulted in a high removal of the added C within the first meter of the flumes. Yet, no concomitant increases in DIN removal were observed. Moreover, results from laboratory assays showed significant increases in the potential denitrifying enzymeactivity of sediment biofilms from the flumes when labile C was added; suggesting denitrification was limited by C quality. Together {{these results suggest that}} lack of DIN removal response to the labile C addition in flumeswas likely because potential increases in denitrification by biofilms from sediments were counterbalanced by high rates of mineralization of dissolved organic matter. Our results highlight that <b>helophytes</b> can enhance DIN removal in streams receiving inputs from WWTP effluents; and thus, they can become a relevant bioremediation tool inWWTP-influenced streams.

40|$|Phytoplankton {{production}} (PP) in wetlands is not {{measured as}} often as that of macrophytes. A three year-study {{during a period of}} sustained high flooding was undertaken in a central Spanish floodplain wetland (Las Tablas de Daimiel National Park) to determine net PP, its spatial heterogeneity and controlling factors, and compare it with primary production in macrophyte communities. This enabled us to estimate carbon budgets for each community. All PP variables showed high spatial and temporal variability among sites, resulting in low coherence even when flooding connected all sites. Net PP corresponded to 25 - 36 % of submerged plant production and 3 - 10 % of <b>helophyte</b> production. Net PP was controlled by different size fractions of phytoplankton biomass at different wetland sites. Neither nutrients nor zooplankton affected net PP or productivity. A high spatiotemporal variability of PP in wetlands occurs arising from complex processes that affect the underwater light field. Carbon budgets of phytoplankton often exceeded those of submerged macrophytes and attained between 4 and 37 % of <b>helophyte</b> budgets. Although usually considered to be marginal, our study shows that PP in the open water of wetlands should be taken into account for determining accurate wetland carbon budgets, mostly in periods of high flooding, which often result in changing the carbon budget of primary producers.

50|$|The {{distinction}} between an aquatic plant and a terrestrial plant is often blurred {{because of the}} tendency for many aquatic species to have both submersed and emersed forms and because many terrestrial plants are able to tolerate periodic submersion. There are relatively few obligate submersed aquatic plants, (i.e. species that cannot tolerate emersion for even relatively short periods) but some examples include members of Hydrocharitaceae and Cabombaceae, Ceratophyllum, and Aldrovanda and most macroalgae (e.g. Chara and Nitella). Most aquatic plants can, or prefer to, grow in the emersed form, and most only flower in that form.

A field experiment was conducted in a Phragmites australis dominated littoral zone to investigate nutrient retention {{and its effect on}} surface water quality. Measurements were done in mesocosms where water levels could be manipulated. Nutrient status was investigated along a gradient perpendicular to the shore during two growing seasons, one with a stable water level and one with a gradually decreasing water level. Nutrient concentrations in sediment, soil pore water and surface water were significantly lower in the vegetated than in the unvegetated zone. The negative correlations of nutrients in sediment and water, with nutrient contents of the vegetation suggest a direct effect of the vegetation. Nutrient uptake and biomass of the vegetation was higher in continuously flooded soils than in seasonally emerging sediments higher along the littoral gradient, probably due to the increased salinity in drained zones. Denitrification rate was highest in the unvegetated zone and was positively related to water level. Flooded littoral zones did result in a higher nutrient retention than drained zones. On small scale, for an optimal nutrient retention a fluctuating regime is not necessarily better suited than a stable water level, but on a larger scale it can substantially increase the width of the vegetated zone.

In more extreme situations only a part of the series is developed, and in the most extreme case only the elodeïd-phases occur. The submerged stages of nymphaeids, <b>helophytes</b> and stratiotids show ’transitions’ to elodeids in an ecological sense...|$|R
40|$|In September 2001 Stuckenia (Potamogeton) filiformis was {{discovered}} in 8 dune lakes on the Isle of Texel, the Netherlands. Six of these dune pools {{were the result of}} recent turf-stripping operations in wet dune slacks, but in the two remaining dune lakes the plant most probably has been overlooked for many years. S. filiformis usually grows in an open vegetation with <b>helophytes</b> like Eleocharis palustris and stoneworts, notably Chara aspera, the latter being typical of sandy, shallow and wind-exposed shores of dune-lakes. The author follows the recent subdivision of Potamogeton s. l. in three genera, viz. Potamogeton, Stuckenia and Groenlandia...|$|R
40|$|The lake of Posta Fibreno (S Latium, C. Italy), is a biotope {{where some}} {{outstanding}} anomalies in the flora and vegetation of the wetlands of peninsular Italy are concentrated. Here the southernmost Italian populations of Sphagnum palustre {{occur on the}} small surface of a floating island, a cup-formed core of Sphagnum peat and rhizomes of <b>Helophytes,</b> erratically floating on the water-body of a submerged doline, annexed to the easternmost edge of the lake, characterised by the extension of a large reed bed. A strong correlation between characteristics of the physical environment {{and the structure of}} the vegetation on the island, points out the descriptive ability of the communities recorded in the site to reconstruc the genesis of the biotope...|$|R
