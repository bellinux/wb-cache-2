40|$|Abstract Background The genome {{sequence}} of the protistan parasite Trypanosoma brucei contains many tandem <b>gene</b> <b>arrays.</b> <b>Gene</b> duplicates are created through tandem duplication and are expressed through polycistronic transcription, suggesting that {{the primary purpose of}} long, tandem arrays is to increase gene dosage in an environment where individual gene promoters are absent. This report presents the first account of the tandem <b>gene</b> <b>arrays</b> in the T. brucei genome, employing several related genome sequences to establish how variation is created and removed. Results A systematic survey of tandem <b>gene</b> <b>arrays</b> showed that substantial sequence variation existed across the genome; variation from different regions of an array often produced inconsistent phylogenetic affinities. Phylogenetic relationships of gene duplicates were consistent with concerted evolution being a widespread homogenising force. However, tandem duplicates were not usually identical; therefore, any homogenising effect was coincident with divergence among duplicates. Allelic gene conversion was detected using various criteria and was apparently able to both remove and introduce sequence variation. Tandem arrays containing structural heterogeneity demonstrated how sequence homogenisation and differentiation can occur within a single locus. Conclusion The use of multiple genome sequences in a comparative analysis of tandem <b>gene</b> <b>arrays</b> identified substantial sequence variation among gene duplicates. The distribution of sequence variation is determined by a dynamic balance of conservative and innovative evolutionary forces. Gene trees from various species showed that intraspecific duplicates evolve in concert, perhaps through frequent gene conversion, although this does not prevent sequence divergence, especially where structural heterogeneity physically separates a duplicate from its neighbours. In describing dynamics of sequence variation that have consequences beyond gene dosage, this survey provides a basis for uncovering the hidden functionality within tandem <b>gene</b> <b>arrays</b> in trypanosomatids. </p...|$|R

The {{mammary gland}} {{actively}} concentrates iodine into milk {{for the benefit}} of the developing infant, and may develop a goiter-like hyperplasia, sometimes manifesting as fibrocystic breast disease, when iodine level is low. Studies indicate that iodine deficiency, either dietary or pharmacologic, can lead to breast atypia and increased incidence of malignancy in animal models, while iodine treatment can reverse dysplasia, with elemental iodine (I2) having been found to be more effective in reducing ductal hyperplasias and perilobular fibrosis in iodine-deficient rats than iodide (I&minus;). On the observation that Japanese women who consume iodine-rich seaweed have a relatively low rate of breast cancer, iodine is suggested as a protection against breast cancer. Iodine is known to induce apoptosis in breast cancer cells. Laboratory evidence has demonstrated an effect of iodine on breast cancer that is in part independent of thyroid function, with iodine inhibiting cancer through modulation of the estrogen pathway. <b>Gene</b> <b>array</b> profiling of the estrogen responsive breast cancer cell line shows that the combination of iodine and iodide alters gene expression and inhibits the estrogen response through up-regulating proteins involved in estrogen metabolism. Whether iodine/iodide will be useful as an adjuvant therapy in the pharmacologic manipulation of the estrogen pathway in women with breast cancer has not been determined clinically.* Iodine and stomach cancer. Some researchers have found an epidemiologic correlation between iodine deficiency, iodine-deficient goitre, and gastric cancer; a decrease in the death incidence from stomach cancer after iodine-prophylaxis.

5000|$|Dry eye is {{the most}} common eye disease, {{affecting}} 5 - 6% of the population. Prevalence rises to 6 - 9.8% in postmenopausal women, and as high as 34% in the elderly. [...] Tears lubricate the lid and are important for the refraction of light. Tears also promote epithelial health. Only {{a small fraction of the}} estimated 1543 proteins in tears are differentially deficient or upregulated in dry eye. Analysis of lacritin requires 1D or 2D SDS PAGE to differentiate monomer from tissue transglutaminase inactivated polymer. Accordingly, lacritin monomer was reported to be differentially downregulated in mild to severe aqueous deficient dry eye, and in contact lens-related dry eye. In a larger trial, 95% of tears from patients with aqueous deficient dry eye were lacritin monomer deficient. In Sjogren's syndrome dry eye, lacritin monomer deficiency appears to be linked with corneal staining and nerve pathology. Two studies that did not differentiate monomer from multimer did note any change of lacritin in dry eye. Topical treatment of eyes of dry eye mice (Aire knockout mouse model of dry eye) restored tearing, and suppressed both corneal staining and the size of inflammatory foci in lacrimal glands. Lacritin monomer deficiency in tears of patients with blepharitis was also reported. [...] Blepharitis is an inflammation of the eyelid often associated with dry eye. In climatic droplet keratopathy, N119 appears to be un-glycosylated. Also a normal breast cancer localization reported by some has not been replicated in Unigene (the 'mammary gland' hit is for breast cancer) and <b>gene</b> <b>array</b> studies, but some breast cancers appear to display elevated expression or LACRT gene amplification. iTRAQ analysis of tears from diabetics at different stages of disease detected relatively more lacritin, lysozyme, lipophilin A, lipocalin 1, immunoglobulin lambda chain and lactotransferrin in tears of patients with diabetic retinopathy. The analysis did not distinguish lacritin monomer from polymer, and proposed the application of all as biomarkers. Tear lacritin monomer is barely detectable in the initial stage of infection by Fusarium solani in fungal keratitis. [...] Also down regulated are tear lipocalin-1 and cystatin S. [...] Fungal keratitis accounts for half of all corneal ulcers in Africa and India - the primary source of blindness in these countries.A double-masked, randomized, multicenter phase 2 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of 'LacripepTM' in dry eye subjects with Sjogren's syndrome is currently underway at 27 US sites. 'LacripepTM' is a synthetic peptide derived from the C-terminus of lacritin where all known activities reside.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{emergence}} of isoform-sensitive microarrays has helped fuel in-depth {{studies of the}} human transcriptome. The Affymetrix GeneChip Human Exon 1. 0 ST Array (Exon Array) has been previously shown {{to be effective in}} profiling gene expression at the isoform level. More recently, the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Gene 1. 0 ST Array (<b>Gene</b> <b>Array)</b> has been released for measuring gene expression and interestingly contains a large subset of probes from the Exon Array. Here, we explore the potential of using <b>Gene</b> <b>Array</b> probes to assess expression variation at the sub-transcript level. Utilizing datasets of the high quality Microarray Quality Control (MAQC) RNA samples previously assayed on the Exon Array and <b>Gene</b> <b>Array,</b> we compare the expression measurements of the two platforms to determine the performance of the <b>Gene</b> <b>Array</b> in detecting isoform variations. Results Overall, we show that the <b>Gene</b> <b>Array</b> is comparable to the Exon Array in making gene expression calls. Moreover, to examine expression of different isoforms, we modify the <b>Gene</b> <b>Array</b> probe set definition file to enable summarization of probe intensity values at the exon level and show that the expression profiles between the two platforms are also highly correlated. Next, expression calls of previously known differentially spliced genes were compared and also show concordant results. Splicing index analysis, representing estimates of exon inclusion levels, shows a lower but good correlation between platforms. As the <b>Gene</b> <b>Array</b> contains a significant subset of probes from the Exon Array, we note that, in comparison, the <b>Gene</b> <b>Array</b> overlaps with fewer but still a high proportion of splicing events annotated in the Known Alt Events UCSC track, with abundant coverage of cassette exons. We discuss the ability of the <b>Gene</b> <b>Array</b> to detect alternative splicing and isoform variation and address its limitations. Conclusion The <b>Gene</b> <b>Array</b> is an effective expression profiling tool at gene and exon expression level, the latter made possible by probe set annotation modifications. We demonstrate that the <b>Gene</b> <b>Array</b> is capable of detecting alternative splicing and isoform variation. As expected, in comparison to the Exon Array, it is limited by reduced gene content coverage and is not able to detect as wide a range of alternative splicing events. However, for the events that can be monitored by both platforms, we estimate that the selectivity and sensitivity levels are comparable. We hope our findings will shed light on the potential extension of the <b>Gene</b> <b>Array</b> to detect alternative splicing. It should be particularly suitable for researchers primarily interested in gene expression analysis, but who may be willing to look for splicing and isoform differences within their dataset. However, we do not suggest it to be an equivalent substitute to the more comprehensive Exon Array. </p...|$|E

40|$|A {{computational}} method {{was developed for}} delineating connected gene neighborhoods in bacterial and archaeal genomes. These gene neighborhoods are not typically present, in their entirety, in any single genome, but are held together by overlapping, partially conserved <b>gene</b> <b>arrays.</b> The procedure was applied to comparing the orders of orthologous genes, which were extracted from the database of Clusters of Orthologous Groups of proteins (COGs), in 31 prokaryotic genomes and resulted {{in the identification of}} 188 clusters of <b>gene</b> <b>arrays,</b> which included 1001 of 2890 COGs. These clusters were projected onto actual genomes to produce extended neighborhoods including additional genes, which are adjacent to the genes from the clusters and are transcribed in the same direction, which resulted in a total of 2387 COGs being included in the neighborhoods. Most of the neighborhoods consist predominantly of genes united by a coherent functional theme, but also include a minority of genes without an obvious functional connection to the main theme. We hypothesize that although some of the latter genes might have unsuspected roles, others are maintained within <b>gene</b> <b>arrays</b> because of the advantage of expression at a level that is typical of the given neighborhood. We designate this phenomenon ‘genomic hitchhiking’. The largest neighborhood includes 79 genes (COGs) and consists of overlapping, rearranged ribosomal protein superoperons; apparent genome hitchhiking is particularly typical of this neighborhood and other neighborhoods that consist of genes coding for translation machinery components. Several neighborhoods involve previously undetected connections between genes, allowing new functional predictions. Gene neighborhoods appear to evolve via complex rearrangement, with different combinations of genes from a neighborhood fixed in different lineages...|$|R
