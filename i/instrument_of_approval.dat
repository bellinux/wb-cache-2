The UCH Convention, akin to the LOSC, is likewise a compromise package of solutions to a delicate issue of indisputable global significance. Hence, despite its flaws, it should be regarded no less as a monumental international instrument for providing a wider scope of protection for underwater cultural heritage. The fact that the UCH Convention was adopted was success enough. In accordance with its Article 27, the UCH Convention entered into force on 2 January 2009 for States which have deposited their respective <b>instruments</b> <b>of</b> ratification, acceptance, <b>approval</b> or accession on or before 2 October 2008. It shall enter into force for any other State three months after the deposit by that State <b>of</b> its <b>instrument</b> <b>of</b> ratification, acceptance, <b>approval</b> or accession. This paper will examine the international legal framework on the protection of underwater cultural heritage with particular emphasis on the protective regimes under the UCH Convention and the LOSC. This paper aims to: first, provide an overview of the theoretical and historical antecedents of the UCH Convention and its relation to the LOSC; second, discuss the salient provisions of the UCH Convention; third, compare the protective regimes afforded to underwater cultural heritage within the differe. t maritime zones under both the LOSC and the UNESCO Convention· and fourth, identity the promises of the UNESCO Convention 2 ̆ 7 framework as well as issues and gaps that need to be addressed...|$|R

40|$|Prolonged {{exposure}} to radiation from radionuclei used in medical research can cause DNA damage and mutation, which lead to several diseases including cancer. Radioactivity-based experiments are expensive and associated with specialized training, dedication <b>of</b> <b>instruments,</b> <b>approvals,</b> and cleanup with potential hazardous waste. The objective {{of this study was}} to find an alternative to the use of radioactivity in medical research using nucleic acid chemistry. FITC-labeled oligonucleotides that contain wild-type (wt) and modified base (8 -oxo-G) at the same position and their complementary unlabeled strand were synthesized. Purified DNA repair enzyme, OGG 1, and nuclear lysates from MCF- 7 breast cancer cells were incubated with double-stranded FITC-labeled wt and 8 -oxo-G oligonucleotide to demonstrate the OGG 1 incision assay. We found that FITC-coupled oligonucleotides do not impose a steric hindrance during duplex formation, and the fluorescence intensity of the oligonucleotide is comparable with the intensity of the radioactive oligonucleotide. Moreover, we have seen that the OGG 1 incision assay can be performed using these fluorescence oligonucleotides, replacing conventional use of radiolabeled oligonucleotides in the assay. Although the use of fluorescent-labeled oligonucleotides was described in detail for incision assays, the technique can be applied to replace a broad range of experiments, where radioactive oligonucleotides are used, eliminating the hazardous consequences of radiation...|$|R
