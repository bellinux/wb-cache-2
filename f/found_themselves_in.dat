5|$|By the 18th century, the Royal Audiencia of Quito {{began to}} have {{economic}} problems; a lack of roads led to limited communications. Obrajes—a type of textile factory—had provided jobs, but now <b>found</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>in</b> decline, mainly due to a crackdown on smuggled European cloths {{and a series of}} natural disasters. Obrajes were replaced by haciendas, and the dominant groups continued to exploit the indigenous population.|$|E
5|$|In the First Council of Dvin (506), the Armenian Church {{broke off}} from the rest of Christianity by rejecting the dual nature of Christ, which was agreed upon in the Council of Chalcedon of 451. Thus the Armenians <b>found</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>in</b> direct {{confrontation}} with the Byzantine Empire. Emperor Justinian I persecuted the Monophysite Armenians, forcing them to leave Jerusalem.|$|E
5|$|On 18 December 1944 Massachusetts and {{the other}} ships of TF 38 {{unexpectedly}} <b>found</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>in</b> a fight for their lives when Typhoon Cobra overtook the force.

5|$|The Dakota were {{hunters and}} gatherers and soon <b>found</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>in</b> debt to fur traders. Pressed by a {{whooping}} cough outbreak, loss of buffalo, deer, and bear, {{and loss of}} forests to logging, in 1851 in the Treaty of Traverse des Sioux, the Mdewakanton sold the remaining land west of the river, allowing settlement in 1852.|$|E
5|$|The French {{followed}} after Kutuzov, {{but soon}} <b>found</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>in</b> a difficult position. Prussian intentions were unknown {{and could be}} hostile, the Russian and Austrian armies had converged, and French lines of communication were extremely long, requiring strong garrisons to keep them open. Napoleon realized that {{to capitalize on the}} success at Ulm, he had to force the Allies to battle and defeat them.|$|E
5|$|There {{was a lot}} {{of popular}} and {{government}} interest at the time in quantum mechanics – the American government was financing research at SRI into telepathy – and physicists able to understand it <b>found</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>in</b> demand. The Fundamental Fysiks Group used ideas from quantum physics, particularly Bell's theorem and quantum entanglement, to explore issues such as action at a distance, clairvoyance, precognition, remote viewing and psychokinesis.|$|E

5|$|Zelda {{continued}} writing, selling several {{short stories}} and articles. She helped Scott write the play The Vegetable, but when it flopped the Fitzgeralds <b>found</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>in</b> debt. Scott wrote short stories furiously to pay the bills, but became burned out and depressed. In April 1924, they left for Paris.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, Hammond {{resigned}} from Marsham's; {{his wife was}} homesick, leading Hammond to plan a business in South Africa with a partner. However, after moving to Durban, they realised they had insufficient money. He took a job with Denham Motors in Durban, where {{he was forced to}} work much harder than in England. He lost his job in 1959 when the firm went out of business, and the Hammond family again <b>found</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>in</b> financial trouble.|$|E
5|$|Jimmy Nicholl of Raith Rovers was {{appointed}} as McCarthy's replacement, {{but could not}} reverse the slump in form which saw Millwall relegated {{at the end of}} the 1995–96 season in 22nd place. Just five months earlier they had been top of Division One, but now Millwall <b>found</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>in</b> the third tier for the 1996–97 season. The club experienced severe financial difficulties that resulted in them being placed in financial administration for a short time. Nicholl was relieved of his duties and John Docherty returned on a short-term basis to stabilise the club.|$|E

5|$|Legislators <b>found</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>in</b> {{an unusual}} and uncomfortable situation. Nuclear weapons were terrifying, {{and the nature}} of nuclear energy was not widely understood. Because it was so new, there were no {{policies}} or precedents to guide legislators, and traditional party alignments were absent. The scientists who had developed the new technology had never been vocal before, but suddenly were now. The victorious conclusion of World War II gave the armed forces enormous prestige, but there still remained the long-standing American distrust of standing armies, and the tradition of civilian control of the military.|$|E
5|$|The 1990–91 Lakers {{failed to}} win the Pacific Division {{for the first time}} in 10 years, but still {{finished}} with a 58–24 record. After cruising through the Western Conference playoffs, the Lakers <b>found</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>in</b> the NBA Finals once again, their ninth trip to the Finals in 12 years. The 1991 Finals represented a changing of the guard as the Lakers were defeated in five games by the Chicago Bulls, led by superstar Michael Jordan.|$|E
5|$|The 3rd Battalion, 34th Infantry {{set up a}} {{defensive}} perimeter north of the city, and by nightfall was engaged in combat with superior numbers of North Korean troops and tanks. American forces, unable to repulse North Korean armor, soon <b>found</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>in</b> an intense urban fight as columns of North Korean troops, spearheaded by T-34 tanks, entered the town from two directions, cutting off U.S. forces. The fight resulted in the near destruction of the 3rd Battalion, 34th Infantry {{as well as the}} death of the 34th Infantry Regiment's new commander, Colonel Robert R. Martin.|$|E
50|$|During the First World War however both North American states <b>found</b> <b>themselves</b> {{fighting}} <b>in</b> Europe and {{engrossed in}} European politics. President Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points helped to redraw {{the map of}} Europe.|$|R

5|$|The French and British ambassadors had set {{themselves}} up at Poros and invited Constantinople {{to send a}} diplomat there so as to pursue negotiations over the status of Greece. The Porte persisted in refusing to participate in conferences. Hence, the French suggested continuing military operations and extending them into Attica and Euboea. The British opposed this plan. Thus {{it was left to}} the Greeks to drive out the Ottomans from these territories, with the understanding that the French army would only intervene if the Greeks <b>found</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>in</b> trouble.|$|E
5|$|The Muslims <b>found</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>in</b> greater {{difficulties}} by day. Food {{was running}} short, and nights were colder. The {{lack of sleep}} made matters worse. So tense was the situation that, for the first time, the canonical daily prayers were neglected by the Muslim community. Only at night, when the attacks stopped due to darkness, could they resume their regular worship. According to Ibn Ishaq, the situation became serious and fear was everywhere.|$|E
5|$|The {{general strike}} of 1950 {{began in the}} coal mining centres of Hainaut and quickly spread. Workers were soon on strike across Wallonia, Brussels, and, to a lesser extent, Flanders. The port of Antwerp {{was one of the}} key sites {{affected}} and the country was virtually paralysed. On 30 July, four workers were shot dead by the Gendarmerie at Grâce-Berleur, near Liège and the violence intensified. Staunch Leopoldists in the Government called for a stronger stance but <b>found</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>in</b> a minority, even in the PSC–CVP. Frustrated at the lack of progress, the Government threatened to resign en masse.|$|E

5|$|Albion {{had spent}} the {{majority}} of their history in the top-flight of English football, but when the FA Premier League was founded in 1992 the club <b>found</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>in</b> the third tier, which had been renamed Division Two. In 1992–93, Albion finished fourth and entered the playoffs for the first time, having just missed out the previous year. Albion's first appearance at Wembley for over 20 years – and their last ever at the original stadium – saw them beat Port Vale 3–0 to return to the second level – now renamed the First Division. Manager Ossie Ardiles then joined Tottenham Hotspur, however, and a succession of managers over the next few seasons saw Albion consolidate their Division One status without ever mounting a serious promotion challenge.|$|E
5|$|At night, Reshef {{moved with}} his {{remaining}} forces {{north along the}} canal bank. Bypassing the 16th Brigade's positions, the Israelis soon <b>found</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>in</b> {{the center of a}} huge administrative area and vehicle park. Reshef's brigade had stumbled into the command and supply bases of the Egyptian 16th and 21st Divisions. The base was located near the canal on the assumption that it was the safest location from Israeli attacks, which was expected to come from the east, where the defenses were the strongest, not from the south, where they were the weakest. Both sides immediately opened fire, inadvertently leading to the destruction of supply trucks and SAM launchers. The Egyptians managed to organize a counterattack by units of the 21st Division; a battalion of the 14th Brigade and a battalion (less one company) of the 18th Brigade. The tanks repelled the Israelis, who sustained significant losses from vastly overwhelming opposing forces.|$|E
5|$|Faced {{with the}} sudden {{appearance}} of the overwhelming Chinese forces, the ROK 1st Infantry Division tried to establish defensive positions by capturing the hills around Unsan. The South Koreans soon <b>found</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>in</b> a seesaw battle with the PVA 360th Regiment during the night of 25 October. The next day, the PVA 39th Corps arrived at the west of Unsan while cutting the road between Unsan and Yongsan-dong, completely surrounding the ROK 1st Infantry Division. Aided by airdrops, the US 6th Medium Tank Battalion and the US 10th Anti-Aircraft Artillery Group, the ROK 1st Infantry Division reopened the road on 27 October. Several more attempts to advance north by the Koreans made little progress, and the fighting stopped by 28 October.|$|E
