5|$|Although Charles II's anti-French Parliament {{had forced}} England to {{withdraw}} from the Franco-Dutch War in 1674, some English regiments remained in French service. In April Churchill was appointed the colonelcy of one such regiment, thereafter serving with, and learning <b>from,</b> <b>the</b> <b>great</b> Marshal Turenne. Churchill was present at the hard-fought battles of Sinsheim in June 1674, and Enzheim in October; he may also have been present at Sasbach in July 1675, where Turenne was killed.|$|E
5|$|Among {{professional}} economists {{the revival}} of Keynesian economics has been even more divisive. Although many economists, such as George Akerlof, Paul Krugman, Robert Shiller, and Joseph Stiglitz, supported Keynesian stimulus, others did not believe higher government spending would help the United States economy recover <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> Recession. Some economists, such as Robert Lucas, questioned the theoretical basis for stimulus packages. Others, like Robert Barro and Gary Becker, say that empirical evidence for beneficial effects from Keynesian stimulus does not exist. However, {{there is a growing}} academic literature that shows that fiscal expansion helps an economy grow in the near term, and that certain types of fiscal stimulus are particularly effective.|$|E

Negru Vodă that up until then had drawn only a neighborhood crowd. He filled out his cast <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>great</b> pool of Jewish vocal talent: synagogue cantors. He also recruited two eminently respectable classically trained prima donnas, the sisters Margaretta and Annetta Schwartz.|$|E

5|$|As {{with the}} first {{sequence}} of pictures, the three panels concerning Noah, taken from the sixth to ninth chapters of Genesis are thematic rather than chronological. In the first scene is shown the sacrifice of a sheep. Vasari, in writing about this scene mistakes it for the sacrifices by Cain and Abel, in which Abel's sacrifice was acceptable to God and Cain's was not. What this image almost certainly depicts is the sacrifice made by the family of Noah, after their safe deliverance <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> Flood which destroyed the rest of Humankind.|$|E
5|$|At the Port of San Francisco, Steilberg {{inspected}} each {{shipment of}} stones, several thousand crates in all. The Haslett warehouse, between Fisherman's Wharf and the Hyde Street Pier, {{was used for}} storage. With groundbreaking set for July 1931 and the last freighter carrying stones still in transit, Hearst stopped his grand plan for Wyntoon because his fortunes were too far reduced <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> Depression. The stones stayed in the warehouse, incurring annual storage fees of $15,000 in 1930s dollars.|$|E
5|$|Between World WarI and World WarII Australia {{suffered}} greatly <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> Depression {{which started}} in 1929. This limited Australian defence expenditure {{and led to a}} decline in the size and effectiveness of the armed forces during the 1930s. In 1931, the Statute of Westminster granted the Australian government independence in foreign affairs and defence. Nevertheless, from the mid-1930s, Australian governments generally followed British policy towards Nazi Germany, supporting first the appeasement of Hitler and the British guarantee of Polish independence.|$|E
