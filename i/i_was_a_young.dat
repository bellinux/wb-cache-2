25|$|It's {{tougher to}} {{be a young}} writer today than when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> writer. I don't think my first novel would have been {{published}} today as I submitted it. I don't think an editor would have read 50 pages of it. It was very overdone and shaggy, but two young editors saw something that seemed worth pursuing and eventually we all did some work on the book and it was published. I don't think publishers {{have that kind of}} tolerance these days, and I guess possibly as a result, more writers go to writing class now than then. I think first, fiction, and second, novels, are much more refined in terms of language, but they may tend to be too well behaved, almost in response to the narrower market.|$|E

[...] In mid-1978, the economy began to recover and opinion polls showed Labour in the lead, with a general election being expected later that year and a Labour win a serious possibility. Now Prime Minister, Callaghan surprised many by announcing on 7 September {{that there would be no}} general election that year and he would wait until 1979 before going to the polls. Thatcher reacted to this by branding the Labour government [...] "chickens", and Liberal Party leader David Steel joined in, criticising Labour for [...] "running scared".|$|R

Skyler and Bliss presents tectonic plates based on satellite images of the Arctic. Working in a hot and humid Hong Kong where mushrooms grow ferociously, a city artificially refrigerated by climate control, this series provides a conceptual image of a imaginary typographic map for survival.

40|$|Do any folk {{remedies}} or herbals help induce labor? Evidence-based answer Yes, some do. Breast stimulation and electroacupuncture help, {{while other}} common remedies {{that have been}} studied are ineffective, possibly unsafe, or both. Unilateral breast stimulation shortens the time until the onset of labor in women at term (strength of recommendation [SOR]: A, systematic review). Electroacupuncture also may stimulate the onset of labor (SOR: C, observational studies). Sexual intercourse doesn’t appear to ripen the cervix or stimulate labor (SOR: C, 1 observational study). Castor oil universally produces nausea and doesn’t promote labor (SOR: C, low-quality case-control study). Red raspberry leaf is likely safe but ineffective (SOR: B, 1 small randomized controlled trial); evening primrose oil is ineffective and possibly unsafe (SOR: B, 1 small retrospective cohort study); black cohosh and blue cohosh lack evidence of effi cacy and may be unsafe (SOR: C, expert opinion and case reports). Clinical commentary So many remedies, so little knowledge Obstetrics seems to have more folk remedies than any other area of medicine— castor oil, teas, magnets, exercises, herbs, incantations, moxibustion, and so on. When <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>younger</b> doctor, 5 of my patients tried castor oil to induce labor at term. Four had the baby within 2 days, but all were so sick with nausea and diarrhea that they swore off castor oil for future pregnancies. Therein lies the rub with many folk remedies—not only do we know little about their benefi ts, but we don’t know their harms either. As {{a result of this}} review, I can now prescribe breast stimulation in good faith, and I’ll continue to advise against castor oil...|$|R
