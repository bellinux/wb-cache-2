50|$|The {{floor plan}} of the gopuram base block is {{rectangular}} and is bisected by an <b>entrance</b> <b>passageway.</b> The <b>entrance</b> contains a pair of very large double-leaf timber doors.

The doors are studded with small gold bells arranged in a grid pattern, which devotees are supposed to ring as they move through. Footwear is also stored around the entrance area, as it is not allowed within Hindu temples as a sign of respect.|$|R
