5|$|Sandor Clegane, {{otherwise}} known as the Hound, is revealed to have survived his wounds, and is now living among {{a small band of}} villagers. Their leader, a warrior turned septon named Ray, talks with Sandor, and recounts how he found Sandor on the verge of death and nursed him back to health. However, Sandor still feels guilt over his past sins, feeling <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> punished for them. At a gathering, a trio of men from the Brotherhood Without Banners arrives and attempts to extort the villagers, but upon finding out that they have no worthwhile possessions, they leave. Sandor warns Ray that the Brotherhood will return, but Ray refuses to prepare for a confrontation with them.

2500|$|Maalin {{worked as}} a cook at the {{hospital}} in the port-town of Merca in southern Somalia, {{as well as an}} occasional vaccinator for a WHO smallpox eradication team. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> successfully vaccinated, even though smallpox vaccination was obligatory for hospital employees. According to CDC epidemiologist Jason Weisfeld, {{one of the people who}} led the later containment effort in Merca, Maalin had received the smallpox vaccine but it had failed to take, and <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> protected. Other sources state that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> vaccinated. In an interview in 2007, Maalin said that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> vaccinated, explaining: [...] "I was scared of being vaccinated then. It looked like the shot hurt." ...|$|R

5|$|Henry's {{life was}} {{depicted}} {{in a series}} of contemporary illustrations sketched and water-coloured by the chronicler Matthew Paris, mostly drawn in the margins of the Chronica majora. Paris first met Henry in 1236 and enjoyed an extended relationship with the King, although Paris disliked many of Henry's actions and the illustrations are frequently unflattering. Henry was also shown in the poetry of his Italian contemporary Dante, who depicted Henry in the Divine Comedy {{as an example of a}} negligent ruler, sitting alone in Purgatory to one side of the other failed kings. It is unclear why he is shown separately from his contemporaries; possible explanations include that this is a code by Dante to show that England was not part of the Holy Roman Empire, or that it is a favourable comment on Henry himself, highlighting his unusual piety. Unlike many other medieval kings, Henry did not feature significantly in the works of William Shakespeare, and in the modern period <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> a prominent subject for films, theatre or television, having only a minimal role in modern popular culture.|$|E

The two meet Professor Oubier, who is talking to the chief of police, Raoul 'The General' Grasiento, about a mysterious chart. George confronts Oubier about his girlfriend's abduction, but the professor claims he knows nothing, and that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> in Paris recently. George decides to help a CIA agent, Duane, free a local agitator, Miguel, from jail by distracting General Grasiento. Afterwards, he prepares to detonate the jail wall but is arrested in the process.

However, the boat sinks after being attacked by a helicopter.|$|E
