40|$|The {{transport}} sector {{and in particular}} inland waterway transport, is increasing the use of information and communication technology (ICT). The use of ICT can improve this mode of transport eg efficiency and the competition with road transport. An ICT concept, called RIS, River Information Services, is developed during the last years for the exchange of information with inland vessels {{for a number of}} applications. To bring this concept alive, a research project, INDRIS (Inland Navigation Demonstrator for River lnformation Services), was defined to establish standards for the information flows in terms of data elements, protocols and communication means as well as to demonstrate the principles of the concept. INDRIS is carried out by governmental bodies, transport industry, shipping industry and research institutes in The Netherlands, Austria, Germany, Belgium and France. The RIS concept covers navigation, safety and logist√¨c applications. For this reason it was necessary to define data communication and communication systems for time critical applications (real time), such as navigation and safety related data exchange, and not time critical applications eg reporting, gathering fairway information, weather reports and planning. For time critical data communication the Automatic Identification System, AIS, is chosen. This paper describes <b>Inland</b> <b>AIS</b> as demonstrated in INDRIS...|$|E
50|$|An AIS {{transceiver}} normally {{works in}} an autonomous and continuous mode, {{regardless of whether}} it is operating in the open seas or coastal or <b>inland</b> areas. <b>AIS</b> transceivers use two different frequencies, VHF maritime channels 87B (161.975 MHz) and 88B (162.025 MHz), and use 9.6 kbit/s Gaussian minimum shift keying (GMSK) modulation over 25 kHz channels using the High-level Data Link Control (HDLC) packet protocol. Although only one radio channel is necessary, each station transmits and receives over two radio channels to avoid interference problems, and to allow channels to be shifted without communications loss from other ships. The system provides for automatic contention resolution between itself and other stations, and communications integrity is maintained even in overload situations.|$|R
