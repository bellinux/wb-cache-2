50|$|Tub boat lifts {{consisted}} of a moveable <b>hoist</b> <b>travelling</b> on four toothed wheels engaging with two toothed wooden rails, one mounted on each supporting wall. The hoist possessed two drums around which the lifting cables were wound. The lifting ropes passed through pulley blocks before being attached to lifting eyes on the boats to make the lift easier. Four men would wind the hoist when lifting a full 2.5 to 3 tonne tub boat until it was high enough to pass over the dam of the upper canal.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an input shaping control system for overhead crane operations involving simultaneous <b>hoist</b> and <b>travel</b> maneuvers. The control system utilizes model-based partial feedback linearization with frequency modulation. Traditional input shaping controllers target specific system frequencies. Therefore, they {{are incapable of}} accommodating the time dependant frequency associated with simultaneous <b>hoist</b> and <b>travel</b> crane maneuvers. Frequency modulation is used to tune the time-dependent system frequency to the design frequency of a primary input shaping controller. Partial feedback linearization is used to eliminate the time-dependent damping of the system. The primary input shaper frequency is based on lowest operating frequency of the system associated with the longest hoisting cable length operation. Simulations results, using primary zero-vibration (ZV) and zero-vibration-derivative (ZVD) input shapers, are presented. General arbitrary input <b>travel</b> and <b>hoist</b> commands are simulated. Results demonstrate {{the ability of the}} proposed control system to eliminate residual oscillations in all simulated cases...|$|R

50|$|Hoist (winch) motors {{are either}} fixed speed or {{variable}} speed. Fixed speed motors are used at heavy-load and/or slow-speed line sets (e.g., electrics and orchestra shell line sets).

25|$|The winding {{engine was}} the source of power for hauling miners, {{equipment}} and coal up and down the shaft in a cage, the top of the shaft being in the adjacent heapstead, which encloses the frame holding the wheel around which the <b>hoist</b> cable <b>travels.</b> Inside the Heapstead, tubs of coal from the shaft were weighed on a weighbridge, then tipped onto jigging screens, which sifted the solid lumps from small particles and dust - these were then sent along the picking belt, where pickers, often women, elderly or disabled people or young boys (i.e. workers incapable of mining), would separate out unwanted stone, wood and rubbish. Finally, the coal was tipped onto waiting railway wagons below, while the unwanted waste sent to the adjacent heap by an external conveyor.|$|R

40|$|As {{near surface}} {{deposits}} are depleted, it becomes increasingly apparent {{that we will}} have to mine deeper in order to meet future world demand for metals. Along with deeper mining comes its associated challenges: increased stresses and seismicity, increased heat load and increased inefficiencies due to <b>hoisting</b> constraints and <b>travel</b> time. All of these challenges, and more, contribute to safety concerns, higher initial capital costs and higher operating costs, which combined, can make deep reserves uneconomic. In order to meet these challenges, we must closely examine present deep mining infrastructures and operating practices with a view to learn and enhance upon "Best Practices". This thesis will examine the challenges of providing ventilation within deep, hot mines. Specifically, we will examine Inco Limited's Creighton Mine. A current expansion at Creighton will see mining progress to the 7660 level within the next few years. A key issue, which arises, is the question as to whether Creighton will need a refrigeration system or can it continue to rely on its natural heat exchange capacity...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MEng (Civil Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2007. The {{failure rate}} of {{electric}} {{overhead travelling crane}} supporting structures across the world is unacceptably high. Failures occur even when the supporting structures are designed within the relevant design codes. This demonstrates {{a lack of understanding}} of the dynamic behaviour of cranes in many design codes. The current South African loading code is simplistic with respect to crane supporting structure design, relying on empirical factors to determine the correct loads. While these factors lead to predicted forces in the correct range of values, the Eurocode’s methods are more scientifically based. In recognition of this the draft South African code predominantly incorporates the methods used by the Eurocode to calculate design forces for crane supporting structures. The purpose of this thesis was to use an existing numerical model to determine the wheel loads induced by a crane into the crane supporting structure through <b>hoisting,</b> normal longitudinal <b>travel,</b> skewing and rail misalignment. The numerically obtained forces were then compared with the design forces estimated in the current South African code and the Eurocode, in order to determine whether the factors and methods used in the codes are accurate. The current empirically based South African code was found to be highly conservative. In contrast the scientifically based design forces from the Eurocode were close to the numerically calculated forces, only failing to predict the behaviour of the crane in the case of skewing. Further work needs to be completed in the estimation of forces induced during this load case. Once this is achieved it is hoped that the better understanding of the crane forces adapted from the Eurocode into the draft South African code will lead to a reduction in failures of electric overhead travelling crane supporting structures...|$|R
