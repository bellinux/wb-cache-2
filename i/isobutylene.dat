2500|$|Carbonylation is {{versatile}} method when {{coupled to}} {{the addition of}} water. This method is effective for alkenes that generate secondary and tertiary carbocations, e.g. <b>isobutylene</b> to pivalic acid. In the Koch reaction, the addition of water and carbon monoxide to alkenes is catalyzed by strong acids. Acetic acid and formic acid are produced by the carbonylation of methanol, conducted with iodide and alkoxide promoters, respectively, and often with high pressures of carbon monoxide, usually involving additional hydrolytic steps.

2500|$|Sulfuric acid is {{used for}} a variety of other {{purposes}} in the chemical industry. For example, it is the usual acid catalyst for the conversion of cyclohexanone oxime to caprolactam, used for making nylon. It {{is used for}} making hydrochloric acid from salt via the Mannheim process. Much [...] is used in petroleum refining, for example as a catalyst for the reaction of isobutane with <b>isobutylene</b> to give isooctane, a compound that raises the octane rating of gasoline (petrol). Sulfuric acid is also often used as a dehydrating or oxidising agent in industrial reactions, such as the dehydration of various sugars to form solid carbon.|$|E
50|$|<b>Isobutylene</b> {{is used as}} an {{intermediate}} {{in the production of}} a variety of products. It is reacted with methanol and ethanol in the manufacture of the gasoline oxygenates methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) and ethyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE), respectively. Alkylation with butane produces isooctane, another fuel additive. <b>Isobutylene</b> is also used in the production of methacrolein. Polymerization of <b>isobutylene</b> produces butyl rubber (polyisobutylene). Antioxidants such as butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) are produced by Friedel-Crafts alkylation of phenols using <b>isobutylene.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Polymer and {{chemical}} grade <b>isobutylene</b> is typically obtained by dehydrating {{tertiary butyl alcohol}} or catalytic dehydrogenation of isobutane. [...] Gasoline oxygenates MTBE and ETBE are generally produced by reacting methanol or ethanol with <b>isobutylene</b> contained in butene streams from olefin steam crackers or refineries. <b>Isobutylene</b> is not isolated before the reaction as separating the ethers from the remaining butenes is simpler.|$|E
5000|$|Butyl rubber is a {{synthetic}} rubber, a copolymer of <b>isobutylene</b> with isoprene. The abbreviation IIR stands for <b>isobutylene</b> isoprene rubber. Polyisobutylene, {{also known as}} [...] "PIB" [...] or polyisobutene, (C4H8)n, is the homopolymer of <b>isobutylene,</b> or 2-methyl-1-propene, on which butyl rubber is based. Butyl rubber is produced by polymerization of about 98% of <b>isobutylene</b> with about 2% of isoprene. Structurally, polyisobutylene resembles polypropylene, having two methyl groups substituted on every other carbon atom. Polyisobutylene is a colorless to light yellow viscoelastic material. It is generally odorless and tasteless, though it may exhibit a slight characteristic odor.|$|E
50|$|Isooctane is {{produced}} {{on a massive}} scale in the petroleum industry, usually as a mixture with related hydrocarbons.

50|$|Because of {{the double}} bonds, these 4-carbon alkenes can act as {{monomers}} {{in the formation of}} polymers, as well as having other uses as petrochemical intermediates. They are used in the production of synthetic rubber. But-1-ene is a linear or normal alpha-olefin and <b>isobutylene</b> is a branched alpha-olefin. In a rather low percentage, but-1-ene is used as one of the comonomers, along with other alpha-olefins, in the production of high-density polyethylene and linear low-density polyethylene. Butyl rubber is made by cationic polymerisation of <b>isobutylene</b> with about 2 - 7% isoprene. <b>Isobutylene</b> is also used for the production of methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) and isooctane, both of which improve the combustion of gasoline.|$|E
50|$|Polybutene {{is similar}} to but {{different}} from polyisobutylene (PIB). Polybutene is typically made from cat cracker mixed C4s (after the stream is Merox treated to remove sulfur and amines, and contain 1-butene, 2-butene, and <b>isobutylene.</b> Ethylene steam cracker C4s are also used as supplemental feed for polybutene. On the other hand, PIB is produced from essentially pure <b>isobutylene</b> made in a C4 complex of a major refinery. The presence of isomers other than <b>isobutylene</b> can have several effects including: 1) lower reactivity due to steric hindrance at the terminal carbon in, e.g., manufacture of polyisobutenyl succinic anhydride (PIBSA) dispersant manufacture; 2) the molecular weightâ€”viscosity relationships of the two materials may also be somewhat different.|$|E

50|$|Isoamylene is one {{of three}} main {{byproducts}} of deep catalytic cracking (DCC), a relatively new concept that is very similar to the operation of the fluid catalytic cracking (FCC). The DCC uses vacuum gas oil (VGO) as a feedstock to produce primarily propylene, <b>isobutylene,</b> and isoamylene. The rise in demand for polypropylene has encouraged the growth of the DCCU, which is operated very much like an FCCU. <b>Isobutylene</b> and isoamylene are feedstocks necessary for the production of the much debated gasoline blending components methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) and tert-amyl methyl ether (TAME).|$|E
