Iron precipitation during both {{crystal growth and}} following phosphorus diffusion gettering (PDG) are simulated and compared to experimental results as the iron precipitate density after these processes is essential in the modeling of <b>intrinsic</b> <b>gettering</b> in multicrystalline silicon solar cell processing. The PDG decreases the density of iron precipitates compared to the as-grown state and as expected the effect is larger at lower initial iron concentrations. Due to this effect the iron precipitation is significantly reduced almost throughout the whole ingot height {{and it can be}} concluded that <b>intrinsic</b> <b>gettering</b> has a beneficial effect only in the case of high initial iron concentration, in accordance with the experimental results.

Interfacial structure was studied by cross-section transmission electron microscopy. Our studies show that for successful implementation of thin film backside gettering, good control of interactions between <b>intrinsic</b> <b>gettering</b> and thin film backside gettering during device processing cycles is critical. Thin film deposition generally increases oxygen precipitation. No extended defects propagate toward the bulk silicon. The structural and electrical quality of a denuded zone is found important.

40|$|AbstractIn {{the present}} study, the {{influence}} of oxygen precipitates in the bottom part of multicrystalline silicon ingots on the metal diffusion has been studied. According to the well known haze test, an experimental setup for the measurement of diffusion velocity at 700 °C was developed, in which the copper was detected using Total Reflection X-ray Fluorescence. Differences in the diffusion velocity and the gettering amount for copper in samples with low-oxygen and high-oxygen were observed. Thus gettering efficiency seems {{to be dependent on}} oxygen content. Metal precipitates detected were found to contain Si, O and Cu. Since these precipitates appear along grain boundaries, it is assumed that grain boundaries act as a diffusion channel. As a consequence, oxygen precipitates located at the grain boundary should be most effective for <b>intrinsic</b> <b>gettering.</b> The results of these studies are encouraging since they imply that an optimized oxygen precipitate concentration in the bottom zone of a multicrystalline silicon ingot can be used as an effective intrinsic diffusion barrier...|$|E
40|$|The {{properties}} of the early transistors were determined by the minority-carrier lifetime, as is the silicon photovoltaic solar cell. Most of the devices on the modern integrated circuits are majority carrier devices, in part to avoid this lifetime dependence. The micro-electronics industry typically starts with wafers with a minority-carrier lifetime of 1000 micro-seconds, but during device fabrication this lifetime is reduced to beflow 1 micro-second, in spite of extraordinary cleanliness and precautions. Process-induced defects (PID) include point defects, defect complexes, line defects, and bulk precipitates. One of the aspects {{that needs to be}} better understood is the nature of minority carrier recombination at line defects and at precipitates. Some of the PIDs are known {{to be related to the}} fast-diffusers of the iron-series transition elements. One of the common techniques of dealing with these elements is <b>intrinsic</b> <b>gettering</b> by the oxygen precipitates. But even in the gettered state, there may be a residual effect on the lifetime. Oxygen is an almost ubiquitous impurity in silicon and plays an important role in both integrated circuits and solar cells. The isolated oxygen interstitial is electrically inactive, but in its various aggregated forms it has a variety of electrical activities. The agglomeration and precipitation of oxygen, including impurity gettering and the complicating role of carbon, is discussed...|$|E
40|$|<b>Intrinsic</b> <b>gettering</b> {{of gold in}} Czochralski {{single-crystal}} silicon was evaluated using neutron activation analysis and electron beam microprobe analysis. Silicon wafers were subjected to oxygen denuding and heat-treatment cycles which produced adefect structure, adjacent to a defect-free r gion, of either oxide particles, oxide particles and stacking faults at mixed ratios, or stacking faults alone. These were produced to evaluate the possibility of gettering of gold from the defect-free region by mechanisms of dislocation-metal interactions, dislocations associated with stacking faults, stacking faults, or interstitial-metal interactions. None of these mechanisms were found to cause gettering [...] the only evidence of active gettering seen was the high concentration ofgold observed at free surfaces, {{which appears to be}} attracted by high vacancy concentrations at such a location. Terminal solid solubility of gold was determined to verify the accuracy of the activation technique. It was found that gold distributed homogeneously throughout the wafer {{at the level of the}} solubility limit and that preferential precipitation of gold at oxide particles or stacking faults did not occur. The neutron activation techniques were successful in duplicating published values of solubility of gold in silicon over the temperature range used. Aside from surface effects, the concentration of gold in the wafer was not significantly enhanced by the intrinsic defect struc-tures produced.

40|$|Program for New Century Excellent Talents in Fujian Province University; Nation Natural Science Foundation of China [50902116, 50832006]; State Key Laboratory of Silicon Materials [SKL 2009 - 11]The {{influence}} of nickel precipitation on {{the formation of}} denuded zone (DZ) in Czochralski silicon (Cz Si) was systematically investigated by means of Scanning Infrared Microscopy (SIRM) and optical microscopy (OM). It was found that, for conventional high-low-high annealing (CFA), the DZ can be obtained in all specimens contaminated by nickel impurity at different steps of the heat treatment, indicating that no nickel precipitates generated in the region just below the surface. Additionally, {{the width of the}} DZ is nearly the same in all specimens although the contamination sequence is different, indicating that the contamination temperature, that is, the corresponding equilibrium concentration of interstitial nickel in the silicon doesn't influence significantly the thermodynamics and kinetics process of the formation of nickel precipitates. For Rapid thermal annealing (RTA) -low-high annealing, the tendency remained unchanged. On the basis of the experimental results, it is supposed that the formation of DZ is strongly influenced by the segregation gettering and <b>intrinsic</b> <b>gettering</b> of the nickel atoms, which were caused by the formation of nickel-silicon (Ni-Si) alloys close to the surface, oxygen precipitates and extended defects in the bulk, respectively.

40|$|Transition metal {{impurities}} {{are well}} known to cause detrimental effects when present in the active regions of Si devices. Their presence degrades minority carrier lifetime, provides recombination-generation centers, increases junction leakage current and reduces gate oxide integrity. Thus, gettering processes are used to reduce the available metal impurities from the active region of microelectronic circuits. Gettering processes are usually divided into intrinsic (or internal) and extrinsic (or external) categories. Intrinsic refers to processing the Si wafer {{in a way to}} make available internal gettering sites, whereas extrinsic implies externally introduced gettering sites. Special concerns have been raised for <b>intrinsic</b> <b>gettering.</b> Not only will the formation of the precipitated oxide and denuded zone be difficult to achieve with the lower thermal budgets, but another inherent limit may set in. In this or any process which relies on the precipitation of metal silicides the impurity concentration can only be reduced as low as the solid solubility limit. However, the solubilities of transition metals relative to silicide formation are typically found to be {approx_gt} 10 {sup 12 }/cm{sup 3 } at temperatures of 800 C and above, and thus inadequate to getter to the needed concentration levels. It is thus anticipated that future microelectronic device processing will require {{one or more of the}} following advances in gettering technology: (1) new and more effective gettering mechanisms; (2) quantitative models of gettering to allow process optimization at low process thermal budgets and metal impurity concentrations, and/or (3) development of front side gettering methods to allow for more efficient gettering close to device regions. These trend-driven needs provide a driving force for qualitatively new approaches to gettering and provide possible new opportunities for the use of ion implantation in microelectronics processing...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1988 The refresh {{times of}} all dynamic charge storage devices, best {{characterized}} by the generation lifetime at roan temperature and the recombination lifetime at higher device operating temperatures (T> 70 °C), strongly influence the efficient and successful operation of dynamic charge storage devices such as DRAM's and CCD's. Both recombination and generation lifetime characteristics of p/p⁺ epitaxial silicon wafers are investigated. Extremely high generation lifetimes {{on the order of}} 20 - 30 msec are observed on p-type epitaxial layers which are correlated by DLTS measurements where no significant trap levels with concentrations higher than 3 x 10 ¹¹cm⁻³ are observed. Schroder's [1] simple technique for the determination of recombination lifetimes of materials using a pulsed MOS capacitor technique at elevated temperatures ignores the lateral quasi-neutral bulk generation for short base width devices such as thin epitaxial layers. Consequently, calculations using Schroder's technique indicate that the recombination lifetime of a given material is a function of MOS capacitor diameter. A simple one dimensional approach was developed [2] for the measurement of recombination lifetimes in which quasi-neutral bulk generation in the lateral area of MOS capacitors and the time dependence of the width of space-charge region are taken into consideration for short-base-width devices. The apparent recombination lifetime of thin p-type epitaxial layers were limited to 2 psec by the lower lifetime of the epitaxial layer - p⁺ substrate interface. Investigation of wafers with various epitaxial layer thickness revealed that the actual recombination lifetime of the bulk epitaxial material is an order of magnitude higher than the apparent values. Precipitates at the epitaxial layer - substrate interface were suspected as the main limiting factor causing a localized degradation of recombination lifetimes at the epitaxial layer - substrate interface in p/p⁺ epitaxial wafers. Application of an <b>intrinsic</b> <b>gettering</b> cycle and G 4 JS simulation heat treatments suggests up to three fold improvement of apparent recombination lifetimes...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1988 The {{major goal}} of this {{research}} work was to develop better electrical measurements {{for the evaluation of}} silicon material quality. The first approach investigated was the Zerbst generation lifetime measurement technique. It was demonstrated that the error in the estimation of the generation lifetime obtained with this technique could be as high as two orders of magnitude due to the neglect of lateral surface generation effects. A procedure was developed to evaluate the generation lifetimes accurately. It includes the use of oxide annealing to reduce surface generation, the employment of an acid-free backside contact process to minimize oxide surface irregularities, and the use of devices of various sizes to extract the actual generation lifetimes. Very high lifetimes of about 50 msec were obtained using this procedure. The second approach investigated was evaluation of the dielectric strength of Si 0 ₂ films thermally grown on silicon material. It was found that oxide annealing did not affect the measured dielectric strength results when the breakdown criterion was set at the catastrophic breakdown current level in the voltage ramp-up technique and when the electrons were injected from the silicon/Si 0 ₂ interface in the constant current technique. A supplemental {{goal of this}} research work was to use the developed generation lifetime measurement procedure to investigate the effect of pre-epitaxial deposition nucleation cycles on the generation lifetimes of silicon wafers from different parts of a silicon ingot. It was found that when a 650 °C nucleation heat treatment cycle was inserted before the depositon of the epitaxial layer, followed by a typical <b>intrinsic</b> <b>gettering</b> process, the generation lifetimes of wafers became independent of their origin in the ingot and were very high, about 35 msec. A relationship between the dielectric strength of Si 0 ₂ films and the density of bulk microdefects was also investigated. The dielectric strength of Si 0 ₂ films was found to increase with the bulk stacking fault density, not with the bulk precipitate density. This indicates that the formation of bulk stacking faults may be the key element responsible, for gettering heavy metal contaminants away from the front surface of the wafer...|$|E
30|$|Due to {{the high}} price of fossil energy source and huge {{pollution}} of environmental issue, in the recent years, the development of renewable energy has regained our attention. The development of the solar energy industry {{is one of the most}} popular technologies in renewable energy. The majority of solar cells are made from crystalline silicon; more than half of the crystalline silicon solar cell production is based on multicrystalline silicon (mc-Si). The quality of multicrystalline silicon (mc-Si) wafers may become worse in the future for several reasons; the main reason is that lower-quality feedstock will probably be used for cost reduction and availability reasons [1]. Improving conversion efficiency using a low-cost material development is the main research activity in the photovoltaic field [2, 3]. Several experiments demonstrated that the electrical properties of crystalline silicon solar cells can be improved by coating the n[*]+[*]emitter region with a porous silicon layer [2 – 5], and many technologies have been used for this purpose [6 – 8], such as using vanadium oxide as an antireflection coating [9]. The possibility of improving the electrical properties of silicon wafers, by extracting impurities from them, using thermal treatment under oxygen atmosphere, or phosphorus diffusion, is well known [10 – 13]. Besides, the porous silicon (PS) layer may be used as an efficient sacrificial layer for gettering metallic impurities [11, 14]. There are two general classifications of gettering, namely extrinsic and intrinsic. Extrinsic gettering refers to gettering that employs external means to create the damage or stress in the silicon lattice in such a way that extended defects needed for trapping impurities are formed. These chemically reactive trapping sites are usually located at the wafer surfaces, away from the bulk. <b>Intrinsic</b> <b>gettering</b> is using oxygen to enforce precipitation of metallic impurities, such as copper, not at the wafer surface but in its bulk. A preparatory step in this case is a thermal treatment causing precipitation of the excess oxygen which, for a variety of reasons related to the specific properties of oxygen in silicon, forms oxygen precipitates in the bulk of the wafer rather than at its surface. Those oxygen precipitates then act as gettering sites for metallic impurities. PS may also be used as an excellent antireflective coating or as a passivating layer on the emitter of crystalline silicon [15]. Most often, the formation of PS can create defects in the surface of the Si substrate that may enhance the gettering effect as extrinsic gettering effect. A phosphorus gettering model was proposed [16], which stated that the gettering speed is controlled by two steps. The first step is to limit the gettering temperature by releasing diffusion of metal impurities, and the second step is to control the best gettering temperature by the segregation function. Other authors [17] proposed that silicon self-interstitial current generated during phosphorus (P) diffusion is an essential factor of the gettering mechanism, and also found that Fermi level-enhanced solubility in the P diffused layer contributes to the gettering effect. The use of an infrared (IR) furnace for the fabrication of p-n junction [18, 19] and gettering impurity through the porous silicon layer [20] is one of the processes that may be used to reach this goal. In this work, we will investigate the increase of carrier lifetime and the conversion efficiency of multicrystalline silicon solar cells gettered by a phosphorous gettering process using a sacrificial porous silicon layer in which the impurities will be trapped.|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the simulation of the contrast in X-ray section topographs due to the strains induced in silicon single crystals by various types of technologically relevant crystal defect. A general introduction to the field of X- ray topography is presented, illustrating that this technique is well suited to the characterisation of defect induced strain in highly perfect crystals. A review of X-ray dynamical theory is given, culminating in Takagi's equations for a crystal containing a defect. Techniques for simulating X-ray section topographs, based on Takagi's equations, are discussed. Computer simulation of section topographs has been used throughout this work to deduce the microscopic strains from the X-ray topographic images. The volume of oxygen precipitates in MCZ silicon was found to increase linearly as lnT, where T is the annealing temperature of the sample. Results suggest {{that the vast majority of}} precipitates which survive to maturity are nucleated at approximately the same time, subsequently growing at the same rate. An industrial role for simulation in conjunction with experiment is proposed, in the evaluation of the precipitate depth and the deformation parameter, C, representing the precipitate strain magnitude. The technological relevance of these two quantities is discussed. The effect of surface relaxation on the structure of images due to precipitates has been investigated. The critical depth (_z(_crit)) at which the effect of surface relaxation became negligible was found to increase linearly with lnC. Simulations have been generated for crystals containing oxygen precipitate distributions, with denuded zones. Characteristic image features have been discussed. Studies on precipitate resolvability revealed that the critical separation for two precipitates to be just resolved increases linearly as lnC. An extensive study of <b>intrinsic</b> <b>gettering</b> has been undertaken, in terms of decorated dislocations. The strain distribution due to precipitate decoration was modelled by the cylindrical inclusion model. It was shown that even for very low precipitate strains, precipitate decoration is distinguishable from the associated dislocation by section topography. Hence, an industrial role is proposed for simulation, in conjunction with experiment, in the parameterisation of the strain induced by decorated dislocations. To fully explore the use of the cylindrical inclusion model in this way, the variation in the inclusion strain magnitude was determined as a function of the precipitate strain and density, and the size of the precipitate distribution. It was found that the strain magnitude of the equivalent cylindrical inclusion must increase more rapidly relative to the precipitate deformation parameter for low-order reflections than for high-order reflections. Decorated dislocations have been shown to be resolvable by section topography even in the most dislocation-rich sihcon samples. The industrial usefulness of this characteristic is discussed. A study was made of the critical deformation parameter, C(_crit), for decorated dislocations to be just resolved, as a function of the separation, k, of the dislocations. For k greater than about 45 µm, the variation of In(C(_crit) with k was linear. For smaller separations, the linearity breaks down because of the increasingly important strain contribution due to the dislocations. The strains induced by oxide films and devices in the silicon substrates onto which they are formed have been investigated. Experimental section topographs of oxide edge regions and devices on silicon have been simulated, and the visibility of the extra set of fringes found in simulations by another worker has been examined. The variation in image structure with device position on the entrance and exit surfaces has been investigated. An absolute minimum on device width detectable by section topography of lµm has been found. However, this minimum was found to depend on device-induced strain, and for values of strain characteristic of contemporary devices, the minimum detectable device width was found to be at least 3. 5 µm. This is above the limits set by the geometric and other constraints of the experimental technique. A thorough study has been made of the cancellation of opposing strains due to opposite edges of a device. The total distortion induced by the device was found to be minimised by reducing the device width and increasing the force per unit length, 5, along the device edges. Quantitative information has been obtained on this process. It was found that the fractional increase in lattice parameter at a fixed point, due to device-induced strain, increases linearly with S, with increasing gradient for increasing device width. It was shown that the narrower the device, the faster the relative fall-off in fractional increase in lattice parameter with increasing displacement from one edge of the device...|$|E
