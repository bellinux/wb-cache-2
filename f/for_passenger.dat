5|$|Birmingham New Street is {{the busiest}} railway {{station in the}} United Kingdom outside London, both <b>for</b> <b>passenger</b> entries and exits and <b>for</b> <b>passenger</b> interchanges. It is the {{national}} hub for CrossCountry, the most extensive long-distance train network in Britain, and a major destination for Virgin Trains services from London Euston, Glasgow Central and Edinburgh Waverley. Birmingham Moor Street and Birmingham Snow Hill form the northern termini for Chiltern Railways express trains running from London Marylebone. Local and regional services are operated from all of Birmingham's stations by London Midland. Curzon Street railway station is planned to be the northern terminus for phase 1 of the High Speed 2 rail link from London, due to open in 2026.|$|E
50|$|Since December 2010, Oresundtrains use the City Tunnel in Malmö, {{with its}} {{stations}} at Hyllie and Triangeln, thereby saving one minute <b>for</b> <b>passengers</b> to Malmö C and about 15 to 20 minutes <b>for</b> <b>passengers</b> to Triangeln.|$|R
25|$|There {{was little}} outside deck space <b>for</b> <b>passengers.</b> The {{existing}} ferries had large decks, {{and it was}} common <b>for</b> <b>passengers</b> to spend the entire sailing circling the decks of the ship or sunbathing on the lifejacket containers.|$|R
50|$|Crush loads in {{transport}} vehicles {{can result}} in many secondary issues, such as petty theft and pickpocketing, extreme discomfort <b>for</b> <b>passengers,</b> sexual harassment, and an inability <b>for</b> <b>passengers</b> to board and alight vehicles in a timely manner.|$|R
5|$|By 1870, a track {{had been}} added to the east of the station and two sidings {{had been added}} to the west; one of the western sidings was a bay {{platform}} <b>for</b> <b>passenger</b> trains, which was accessed from the platform adjoining the upper floor. Interlocking signalling was in use at Herne Hill by 1880.|$|E
5|$|Extensions to both Metro {{lines are}} planned as of September 2017. The Blue Line {{extension}} will branch northward from the Target Field station, adding 11 stations to the line: two more in Minneapolis, two in Golden Valley, one each in Robbinsdale and Crystal, and five in Brooklyn Park. The Green Line extension will branch west from Target Field station and include 15 new stations: five in Minneapolis, three each in Saint Louis Park and Hopkins, one in Minnetonka, and three in Eden Prairie. The Metropolitan Council estimated in 2017 that the Green Line extension {{will be open}} <b>for</b> <b>passenger</b> service in 2021 and the Blue Line extension will be ready <b>for</b> <b>passenger</b> service the following year.|$|E
5|$|In 1861, the New London Northern Railroad succeeded the New London, Willimantic, and Palmer. That year, the {{railroad}} constructed a freight depot and steamboat wharf (likely also used <b>for</b> <b>passenger</b> trains) along Water Street. The depot burned on May 8, 1864, but was rebuilt {{on the same}} site.|$|E

5000|$|The {{station has}} both entrances {{from inside the}} railway station <b>for</b> <b>passengers</b> {{transferring}} to or from National Rail services, and entrances from the street outside to allow easy access and egress <b>for</b> <b>passengers</b> not using the rail system.|$|R
25|$|Passenger {{rates from}} Portland to Oregon City on Gazelle were $2 each way; {{additional}} fares were charged for upriver travel, starting with $1 <b>for</b> <b>passengers</b> bound <b>for</b> Butteville and Champoeg, {{going up to}} $5 <b>for</b> <b>passengers</b> going to Corvallis.|$|R
5|$|TfL {{has also}} {{suggested}} {{there may be}} potential for the turnback siding adjacent to Milkwood Road to be converted <b>for</b> <b>passenger</b> use. This would require substantial changes to the station {{as there is no}} direct access to the platforms from Milkwood Road and the current subway for accessing the platforms does not extend east of the southbound platform.|$|E
5|$|The SS Christopher Columbus was an American {{excursion}} liner on the Great Lakes, {{in service}} between 1893 and 1933. She {{was the only}} whaleback ship ever built <b>for</b> <b>passenger</b> service. The ship was designed by Alexander McDougall, the developer and promoter of the whaleback design.|$|E
5|$|The {{designation}} {{for standard}} locomotives fitted with ETH and therefore used <b>for</b> <b>passenger,</b> mail and parcels use. 133 locomotives had been fitted {{by the time}} renumbering occurred, and shortly afterwards the sub-class had settled down to 154 locomotives, numbered 47401-47547 and 47549-47555. Later, further class 47/0s were converted to class 47/4s and renumbered into the series from 47556 onwards, which eventually reached 47665.|$|E
50|$|In late 2014, Hawaiian Airlines began {{offering}} Extra Comfort seating, {{as a new}} service class on its Airbus A330-200 aircraft.

50|$|In early 2008, {{the airline}} {{introduced}} an express check-in service at Ercan <b>for</b> <b>passengers</b> {{who were not}} checking any bags.

5000|$|The station & railway {{here first}} opened in 1869 for goods and 1870 <b>for</b> <b>passengers,</b> {{on the line}} from [...] to West Cheshire Junction (near Helsby); the {{extension}} line from here to Chester was added in November 1874 (1 May 1875 <b>for</b> <b>passengers).</b>|$|R
5|$|The first {{takeover}} of another airline {{took place on}} 28 July 2006: Air Greenland acquired the Danish carrier Air Alpha's Greenland subsidiary. Air Alpha Greenland had operated helicopter flights in Disko Bay and in eastern Greenland. Since the takeover, the acquired Bell 222 helicopters have been used <b>for</b> <b>passenger</b> transfers between Nerlerit Inaat Airport and Ittoqqortoormiit Heliport.|$|E
5|$|The {{line has}} six steam {{locomotives}} <b>for</b> <b>passenger</b> trains and four diesel locomotives, which are primarily used for shunting and to haul works trains. It is unusual for all steam locomotives to be operable {{at the same}} time, as at least one is normally scheduled for overhaul. The railway also owns 23carriages and vans, including all of the original carriages and the brake van built for the railway.|$|E
5|$|The pier's {{secondary}} role {{was as a}} public pier, where pleasure craft were allowed to dock. Tour boats offering {{a view of the}} Kowloon side of the harbour used the pier <b>for</b> <b>passenger</b> boarding. Up to 1978, it was the finishing line for the annual cross-harbour swimming race. As the ceremonies declined, the pier's secondary purpose became the main one: people met and strolled in the area, and others fished.|$|E

5000|$|YRT does NOT issue paper {{transfers}} <b>for</b> <b>passengers</b> paying by Presto card (even if {{they plan}} to transfer between YRT and TTC routes operating within York Region); this means a separate fare is required <b>for</b> <b>passengers</b> wishing to transfer to routes operated by the TTC.|$|R

5|$|The {{platforms}} {{are numbered}} 1 to 15 but passenger trains {{are confined to}} just eight tracks. Most platforms are numbered separately at each end, with odd numbers at the east end and even numbers at the west. Platform 2 is not signalled <b>for</b> <b>passenger</b> trains, {{and there is no}} platform 14.|$|E
5|$|The {{second issue}} was {{that both the}} Glasgow and Ayr {{stations}} were awkward. The Glasgow station, at Bridge Street, was on {{the south of the}} Clyde (and Glasgow Bridge carried a toll at the time). The Ayr station was north of the River Ayr, and although not inconvenient <b>for</b> <b>passenger</b> access to the town, the location prevented southward railway extension.|$|E
5|$|Winnipeg is {{a railway}} hub and {{is served by}} Via Rail at Union Station <b>for</b> <b>passenger</b> rail, and Canadian National Railway, Canadian Pacific Railway, Burlington Northern Santa Fe Manitoba, and the Central Manitoba Railway for freight rail.
