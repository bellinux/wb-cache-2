5|$|The {{requirements}} for the priesthood differed over time and among the cults of different gods. Although detailed theological knowledge was involved in priestly offices, {{little is known about}} what knowledge or training may have been required of the officeholders. Priests were required to observe strict standards of ritual purity in the sacred space. They shaved their heads and bodies, washed several times a day, and wore only clean linen clothing. They were not required to be celibate, but sexual intercourse rendered them unclean until they underwent further purification. The cults of specific gods might impose further restrictions related to that god's mythology, such as rules against eating the meat of an animal that represented the god. The acceptance of women into the priesthood was variable. In the Old Kingdom many women served as priests, but their presence in clergies declined drastically in the Middle Kingdom before increasing in the Third Intermediate Period. Lesser positions, such as that of musician in ceremonies, remained open to women <b>in</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> restrictive periods, as did the special role of ceremonial consort of the god. This latter role was highly influential, and {{the most important of these}} consorts, the God's Wife of Amun, even supplanted the High Priest of Amun during the Late Period.|$|E

25|$|Bands {{formed in}} Manchester during the Madchester era {{included}} the Chemical Brothers, The Verve, Sub Sub (who {{would later become}} the Doves) and Oasis (Noel Gallagher had been a roadie for the Inspiral Carpets). More generally, the Madchester scene brought together electronic dance music and alternative rock, in particular {{the combination of the}} types of drumming found in funk and disco music (and sampled in '80s hip-hop music) with jingle-jangle guitar. In the 1990s, this became a commonplace formula, found frequently <b>in</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> commercial music.|$|E

25|$|Landry's and Lombardi's paths crossed in 1954 {{with the}} New York Giants when Lombardi became the {{offensive}} coordinator and Landry, the left cornerback for the Giants, {{took on the}} added role of defensive coordinator. Landry was the best defensive mind of his era and Lombardi was the best offensive coach of his era. From a personality standpoint, Landry and Lombardi were the antithesis of each other. Lombardi was a vociferously demanding coach who would respond with the greatest elation to success and tremendous sadness to the slightest setback. Landry was stoic and calm <b>in</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> tense situations.|$|E
25|$|The manus and carpus {{are among}} the few areas of the Protoavis {{material}} which are well preserved, and they are astonishingly non-avian. The distal carpals, while long, are in no way similar to those observed in the urvogel or other archaic birds. There is no semilunate element, {{and the structure of}} the radiale and ulnare would have limited the flexibility of the wrist joint. The manus is not tridactyl, and metacarpal V is present. <b>In</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> basal avialian, Archaeopteryx, there is no vestige of the fifth metacarpal and its presence in Protoavis seems incongruous with the claim that it is a bird, let alone one more derived than Archaeopteryx.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{political}} environment was tense across Europe, with terrorist attacks and riots <b>in</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> developed countries, {{the situation was}} more critical in Portugal, with economic and financial havoc. This {{was a time of}} upheavals, locally and nationally. The old Republican Party would not survive the creation of the Republic; factions quickly developed between groups within the party and formed new organizations. There was a succession of general strikes (now legal), demonstrations, gunfire exchanges, and even bombings in the streets of Lisbon; the Republican political class was divided on how to handle the situation. In 1912 the monarchists exploited discontent with liberal laws imposed by the Republicans in the north, and launched a coup that failed. In 1916, after Portugal interned German ships in Lisbon, Germany declared war on Portugal.|$|E

500|$|The play is {{centered}} on sociopolitical themes such as Islamophobia and the self-identity of Muslim-American citizens. It focuses on a dinner party between four people with very different backgrounds. As discussion turns to politics and religion, the mood quickly becomes heated. Described as a [...] "combustible powder keg of identity politics," [...] the play depicts racial and ethnic prejudices that [...] "secretly persist <b>in</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> progressive cultural circles."

Additionally, as the windows are the most fragile parts of a house, in a significant tornado flying debris will likely break enough windows to equalize any pressure difference fairly quickly. Regardless of any pressure drop, the direct effects of a tornado's winds are enough to cause damage to a house in all but the weakest tornadoes.|$|E

Commenting on the song's lyrics, Chris Ryan of MTV Buzzworthy stated that, [...] "Its over-abundance of hooks ('we don't buyyyy no drinks at the bar' being a personal favorite) makes it pretty hard to dislike. And the verse from Brooklyn's Fabolous will bring <b>in</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> hardened of fun-haters."

500|$|The album's {{themes are}} about heartbreak and love, {{while most of}} the {{material}} chosen by Charles were ballads as well. The concept which had originally attracted the interest of Charles to this style of music was the strength he admired in writing such a ballad's somber or melancholy lyrics and then performing the ballad beautifully and with emotional stability; an element he had found to be common <b>in</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> diverse musical genres. Writer Daniel Cooper said of Charles's adaptation of country elements, [...] "His country forays play like a series of intricate variations or like one long meditation on the expansive qualities of music commonly described as the white man's blues." [...] Allmusic's Stephen Cook writes that [...] "Charles intones the sleepy-blue nuances of country crooners while still giving the songs a needed kick with his gospel outbursts." ...|$|E
500|$|David Charlesworth, Abbot of Buckfast Abbey in Devon, England, {{commissioned}} Torbay-based {{theater company}} Unleashed Productions {{to adapt the}} book's stories for the stage. Neil Pugmire wrote the play and incorporated stories about apartheid, Gordon Wilson's daughter's death in the Remembrance Day bombing, and Holocaust survivor Simon Wiesenthal. He also included a dramatization of the chapter [...] "The Lovesick Father". Simon Zimmerman wrote the score for the play, which has a cast of nearly forty actors. The play, which took {{the name of the}} book, was successfully produced outdoors by Buckfast Abbey in 2010. These outdoor performances were well-attended. According to the Western Morning News, the play is [...] "by turns shocking, humorous and moving, [...] explores how forgiveness and grace can be found <b>in</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> testing circumstances". A Herald Express reviewer called the play inspiring and probably the most unique and unusual in South Devon that summer.|$|E

[...] Andrew Shelton from Anime Meta explains that [...] "The character of the girls is extremely well brought out. The superb observation, and ability to capture expression, makes the anime incredibly fun to watch in addition to meeting the story requirements.

500|$|The album has {{received}} generally positive reviews from critics. Fraser McAlpine of the BBC wrote: [...] "At its best, it's a loving homage; at worst it's like the re-made pop music retailers play in shops {{to avoid paying}} proper royalties." [...] He felt that: [...] "As they are essentially photocopies of the originals, the songs depend on {{the context of the}} show to make sense. So listening to the album on musical merits alone is close to pointless." [...] AllMusic's Andrew Leahey rated the album 3.5/5, writing: [...] "It's a short release, but it also holds its ground against the two albums that preceded it, namely because the material is so compatible with the show itself. Madonna's music has always thrived on drama, and it lends itself well to Glee theater-pop approach, which tends to bring out the cheese <b>in</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> serious of songs." [...] Nick Levine of Digital Spy rated the EP 4/5, praising the [...] "imaginative reworking" [...] of [...] "What It Feels Like For a Girl", and noting: [...] "if the Glee treatment encourages a few younger pop fans to invest in Madonna's stellar recent hits collection, it can only be viewed as a good thing. And for those in the know, hearing five members of this thoroughly likable cast trilling [...] "Like A Virgin" [...] in harmony is so downright gleeful, well, it's almost like being touched for the very first time." ...|$|E

[...] He calls the plot [...] "a most important and intriguing episode of World War II. Yet, it has been barely mentioned <b>in</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> comprehensive history books about the war. And what has been reported is treated as inconsequential rumor".
