5|$|In 1968, Arthur C. Clarke and Stanley Kubrick had <b>imagined</b> <b>that</b> by {{the year}} , a machine would exist with an {{intelligence}} that matched or exceeded the capability of human beings. The character they created, HAL 9000, {{was based on a}} belief shared by many leading AI researchers that such a machine would exist {{by the year}} 2001.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept of}} a {{constellation}} was known to exist during the Babylonian period. Ancient sky watchers <b>imagined</b> <b>that</b> prominent arrangements of stars formed patterns, and they associated these with particular aspects of nature or their myths. Twelve of these formations lay along the band of the ecliptic and these became the basis of astrology. Many of the more prominent individual stars were also given names, particularly with Arabic or Latin designations.|$|E

30|$|The {{simple answer}} {{is that we are}} humans and we need to tell stories. We need to tell stories that glorify the human estate. We need heroes. We need to <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> human actions made a difference. Leaders are part of the classic story by which we come to <b>imagine</b> <b>that.</b> We tell stories about leaders and leaders tell stories about {{themselves}} that allow us to <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> we control an uncontrollable world. That’s very good. I think, if you could just imagine – suppose you had a choice, a world that’s uncontrollable – would you rather <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> you could control it, or give up? For me, the human being who imagines he or she can control it is a more attractive human being.|$|R
5|$|The studio {{initially}} <b>imagined</b> <b>that</b> {{the film}} would center around a clone {{of the character}} Newt from Aliens, as the Ellen Ripley character had died {{at the end of}} Alien 3. Whedon composed a thirty-page treatment surrounding this idea before being informed that the studio, though impressed with his script, now intended to base the story on a clone of Ripley, whom they saw as the anchor of the series. Whedon had to rewrite the script {{in a way that would}} bring back the Ripley character, a task he found difficult. The idea of cloning was suggested by producers David Giler and Walter Hill, who opposed the production of Alien Resurrection, as they thought it would ruin the franchise.|$|E
5|$|Sundaram's {{mother is}} pleased with her son's {{popularity}} but misses his presence due to Sundaram's busy acting career. She expresses to Sundaram her desire that she should die in his arms. When Raghavan believes that Sundaram will gradually forget Radha so that he and Radha can get married, he discovers that Sundaram's love for Radha is stronger. Raghavan then informs Radha that she should marry Sundaram, as Raghavan {{does not want to}} backstab his friend. Radha instead decides to personally express her feelings to Sundaram. When Sundaram expresses his love to Radha, she tells him that she never <b>imagined</b> <b>that</b> he would assume her friendly affection towards him as love and that Raghavan is her fiancé. Sundaram, shattered on losing his love, is also happy on hearing that Raghavan would marry her and congratulates Raghavan.|$|E
5|$|During World War II in Yugoslavia, the United States {{initially}} {{supported the}} royal government of Yugoslavia. When the Nazis invaded Yugoslavia {{in the spring}} of 1941, the United States decisively supported the Chetniks {{in the first years of}} the war. This support took place in the form of extensive clandestine relations between the Office of Strategic Services and Chetniks with William Donovan's administration. Such cooperation was highlighted by complex operations such as Operation Halyard, in which several hundred American pilots were rescued by Chetniks. However, OSS support for the Chetniks was compromised by the United Kingdom's MI6 policy of favoring the Yugoslav Partisans over the Chetniks. In 1943, the US government's support for the Chetniks over the Yugoslav Partisans was such that president Franklin D. Roosevelt discussed with Winston Churchill in a private conversation that he <b>imagined</b> <b>that</b> Yugoslavia's boundaries would be completely redrawn into three separate states, with Peter Karađorđević Jr. being the monarch of an independent Serbian kingdom at the end of the war. The USAF and the British RAF began bombing Belgrade indiscriminately in April 1944 when they thought that Nazi occupation could not be removed by home-grown resistance alone. The United States intelligence circles gradually conceded its influence on Yugoslav guerrilla operations to the British. At the end of the war, President Harry S. Truman dedicated a Legion of Merit to Chetnik leader Draža Mihailović, but the award wasn't revealed publicly until 2005.|$|E

25|$|The reformers <b>imagined</b> <b>that</b> the {{elimination}} of the orthodox and Ṣūfī religious establishments, along with traditional religious education, and their replacement with a system in which the original sources were available to all in the vernacular language, would pave the way for a new vision of Islam open to progress and modernity and usher in a society guided by modernity.|$|E
25|$|The railway mania was a {{phenomenon}} {{in which a}} huge number of railway schemes were put forward, when investors <b>imagined</b> <b>that</b> huge gains on investment were certain. Investors overcommitted themselves, and many lost substantial sums; money became scarce even for respectable schemes as subscribers simply had no money to pay calls on their shares. At the same time labour and material prices escalated substantially.|$|E

In retirement, Wilson harbored hopes for a White House run in 1924 despite the absence of substantial support.|$|E
25|$|Born in Moscow, Alexander Nikolaevich was {{the eldest}} son of Nicholas I of Russia and of Charlotte of Prussia (daughter of Frederick William III of Prussia and of Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz).

25|$|Properly, {{the mystery}} of Baptism is {{administered}} by bishops and priests; however, in emergencies any Orthodox Christian can baptize.

This is not considered to be a second baptism, nor is it <b>imagined</b> <b>that</b> the person is not already Orthodox, but rather it is a fulfillment of the proper form.|$|E

25|$|France's {{imposition}} of a head tax in 1900 to support the colony in a public works program provoked unexpected protests. Many Ivoirians viewed the tax {{as a violation of}} the terms of the protectorate treaties because they <b>imagined</b> <b>that</b> France was demanding the equivalent of a coutume from the local kings, rather than the reverse. Many of the population, especially in the interior, considered the tax a humiliating symbol of submission. In 1905, the French officially abolished slavery in most of French West Africa.|$|E

Users of this service were even warned if their query was likely to produce more than 50 results per search.|$|E
25|$|There {{were two}} {{views on the}} role the IMF should assume as a global {{economic}} institution. American delegate Harry Dexter White foresaw an IMF that functioned more like a bank, making sure that borrowing states could repay their debts on time. Most of White's plan was incorporated into the final acts adopted at Bretton Woods. British economist John Maynard Keynes <b>imagined</b> <b>that</b> the IMF would be a cooperative fund upon which member states could draw to maintain economic activity and employment through periodic crises. This view suggested an IMF that helped governments and to act as the United States government had during the New Deal in response to World War II.|$|E
