Mayenne opened the assembly with a symbolically <b>empty</b> <b>chair</b> beside him. The influence of Spain on the assembly soon proved problematic. Spain sought the election of the Infanta Isabella Clara Eugenia of Spain, the daughter of Philip II of Spain and the granddaughter of Catherine de' Medici. The Spanish urged the Estates-General to repeal the Salic Law, which prevented the rule of a queen regnant; but in this, they failed to grasp a fundamental principle of the French royal succession.|$|E
25|$|During the {{establishment}} of the European Community, de Gaulle helped precipitate one of the greatest crises {{in the history of the}} EEC, the <b>Empty</b> <b>Chair</b> Crisis. It involved the financing of the Common Agricultural Policy, but almost more importantly the use of qualified majority voting in the EC (as opposed to unanimity). In June 1965, after France and the other five members could not agree, de Gaulle withdrew France's representatives from the EC. Their absence left the organisation essentially unable to run its affairs until the Luxembourg compromise was reached in January 1966. De Gaulle succeeded in influencing the decision-making mechanism written into the Treaty of Rome by insisting on solidarity founded on mutual understanding. He vetoed Britain's entry into the EEC a second time, in June 1967.|$|E

25|$|De Gaulle had {{not been}} {{instrumental}} in setting up the new organization and, from the start, he opposed efforts by fellow EEC member countries to move toward some form of political integration that, in de Gaulle's thinking, would impinge on the sovereignty of France, both internally and externally. To counter those supranational tendencies that he disparaged, he put forward in 1961 the so-called Fouchet Plan that maintained all decision-making powers {{in the hands of}} governments, reducing the projected European parliamentary assembly to a mere consultative assembly. As expected, the plan was rejected by France's partners. In July 1965 de Gaulle provoked a major six-month crisis when he ordered the boycott of EEC institutions (see <b>Empty</b> <b>chair</b> crisis below) until his demands – the withdrawal of a European Commission proposal to reinforce the community institutions to the detriment of national sovereignty, and the acceptance of France's proposal regarding the financing of the newly established Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) – were met with the Luxembourg compromise.|$|E

Liu's award marks the third occasion that the Prize has been bestowed upon a person in prison or detention, after Carl von Ossietzky (1935) and Aung San Suu Kyi (1991); Liu and Ossietzky were the only ones not to be present or represented by close family at the awards ceremony.

500|$|The Secretary General of Amnesty International, said: [...] "the Chinese {{government}} might see {{this is as}} a victory, but they would be mistaken...

[...] On the other hand, in an article appearing in China Daily, David Gosset of the China Europe International Business School said the award was [...] "a sad paradox, a prize without any real winner, which generates mistrust and perplexity when understanding and clarity are most needed". Gosset believed that only citizens were able to define the exact terms and pace of democratisation in their own country, and lamented the [...] "fallacy" [...] of implicitly associating the PRC with German Nazism or South African apartheid, and emphasised that China, a developing country with a per capita GDP of $3,700, could hardly adopt the socio-political standards of the developed world without attenuating its development. He also argued that the choice of Liu was divisive in view of China's memory of Western imperialism, and of Alfred Nobel's dying wish to reward a person [...] "who shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations". Professor Sidney Rittenberg said: [...] "One does not have to approve of Mr Liu's imprisonment in order to disapprove of his choice as a Nobel laureate... Not only have courageous, intelligent individuals like Mr Liu made no tangible contribution to China's advance, not only have their activities and his choice for a Nobel Prize made life more difficult for China's dissidents—but the main point is that his advocacy of a multiparty system for the China of today would almost certainly lead to disaster, if carried out. To wit, Iran after the overthrow of the shah." ...|$|E

I didn't agree with him on a lot of stuff." [...] On August 3, 2012, he attended a fundraiser for Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, suggesting that Romney would boost the country and [...] "restore a decent tax system... so that there's a fairness and people are not pitted against one another as [...] who's paying taxes and who isn't." [...] During a speech at the 2012 Republican National Convention, Eastwood talked to an <b>empty</b> <b>chair</b> as if President Barack Obama were sitting in it. The speech was met with a huge response by the media with both praise and criticism. Eastwood, who said he came up with the speech 5 seconds before he gave it, said that if he could do it again he would say something different. [...] "My only message was [...] I wanted people to take the idolizing factor out of every contestant out there. Just look at the work, look at the background, and then make a judgment on that. I was just trying to say that, and did it in kind of a roundabout way which took a lot more time, I suppose, than they would have liked. I'd probably say something else but I'd try to get the same message across so that people don't have to kiss up to politicians. No matter what party they're in, you should evaluate their work and make your judgments accordingly.
