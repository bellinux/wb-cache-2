50|$|Stereolithography, digital imaging, and 3D inkjet {{printing}} {{are just a}} few 3D imaging technologies that make use of photopolymers. 3D imaging usually proceeds with CAD-CAM software, which creates a 3D image to be translated into a 3D plastic object. The image is cut in slices, where each slice is reconstructed through radiation curing of the liquid polymer,converting the image into a solid object. Photopolymers used in 3D imaging processes must be designed to have a low volume shrinkage upon polymerization in order to avoid distortion of the solid object. Common monomers utilized for 3D imaging include multifunctional acrylates and methacrylates combined with a non-polymeric component in order to reduce volume shrinkage. A competing composite mixture of <b>epoxide</b> <b>resins</b> with cationic photoinitiators is becoming increasingly used since their volume shrinkage upon ring-opening polymerization is significantly below those of acrylates and methacrylates. Free-radical and cationic polymerizations composed of both epoxide and acrylate monomers have also been employed, gaining the high rate of polymerization from the acryilic monomer, and better mechanical properties from the epoxy matrix.|$|E

In the work reported here, some conditions for the effective use of epoxides in tanning systems have been studied and identified based on hide powder trials. Few commercial aromatic epoxides are found to be water-soluble, and also have relatively low reaction rates, proving another disadvantage. In a series of screening tests, it has been found that an epoxide with aromatic groups in its backbone, used to treat collagen, produces higher hydrothermal stability than that treated with aliphatic epoxide. However, of the commercial aliphatic <b>epoxide</b> <b>resins</b> examined in this research, the water-soluble, tetra-functional pentaerythritol polyglycidyl ether, (e. g.

The removal of loosely bound or weakly adsorbed contamination from surfaces can usually be achieved using conventional cleaning methods such as solvents or proprietory aqueous-based cleaning solutions. However, the removal of fully crosslinked material which might be strongly adsorbed or chemisorbed onto surfaces, such as paints or adhesives, presents a much greater challenge. Similarly, residual <b>epoxide</b> <b>resins</b> remaining on the inside surfaces of resin transfer mould (RTM) tooling post curing are strongly adhered to the mould surface and need to be removed so that the mould can be reused. The mould materials are typically steel or nickel but may be compositebased. Conventional methods cannot fully remove residual epoxide material without the use of hazardous chemicals and mechanical removal can easily result in damage to the underlying mould which may compromise its reuse. Therefore, a number of novel cleaning solutions have been investigated to address the challenging problem of how to remove fully crosslinked <b>epoxide</b> <b>resins</b> from RTM mould surfaces...|$|E

Tensile dilatometry indicated that the toughening mechanism, when present, is similar to the mechanisms found for the piperidine cured epoxies in Part 1. SEM and OM corroborate this finding. Dynamic mechanical studies were conducted to shed light on the toughenability of the epoxies. The time-dependent small strain behavior of these epoxies were separated into their bulk and shear components. The bulk component is related to brittle fracture, whereas the shear component is related to yielding. It can be shown that the rates of shear and bulk strain energy buildup for a given stress are uniquely determined by the values of Poisson's ratio, nu. It was found that nu increases as the monomer molecular weight of the epoxide resin used increases. This increase in nu can be associated with the low temperature beta relaxation. The effect of increasing cross-link density is to shift the beta relaxation to higher temperatures and to decrease the magnitude of the beta relaxation. Thus, increasing cross-link density decreases nu and increases the tendency towards brittle fracture...|$|E
