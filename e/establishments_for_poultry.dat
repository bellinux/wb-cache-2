To accomplish the given aim, the diploma thesis is divided into two main sections. The first section is a literary overview and the second one is a practical section. The literary overview introduces the ecological agriculture in the Czech Republic discussing plant and animal production. In the section concerning plant production is dealt with basic conditions which must be observed to lead to good yield. Animal production focuses on breeding of poultry in ecological agriculture and analyses main specifics of their breeding. The practical part of the diploma thesis was created on the basis of ascertained information from poultry breeders and specialized literature materials. Gained information were evaluated. The result of the practical should be: 1. availability of ecological feed materials <b>for</b> <b>poultry</b> bred in ecological agriculture in the Czech Republic 2. suggestion of possible measures leading for ensuring of organic food sufficiency <b>for</b> <b>poultry</b> 3. suggestion of alternatives for shortage feed materials in organic food Contribution of the diploma thesis is in findings of necessity of new agricultural areas for ensuring of feed material base <b>for</b> <b>poultry</b> as dynamically developing sector of ecological agriculture...|$|R

The extraction procedure {{was based on a}} QuEChERS approach. A liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method was developed using the selected reaction monitoring mode (SRM) and ESI+ ionization. All of the validated figures of merit were evaluated as satisfactory. Accuracy was assessed by recovery studies, varying from 82. 7 to 115. 5 % for porcine kidney and from 91. 5 to 110. 4 % <b>for</b> <b>poultry</b> kidney. Relative standard deviations were lower than 25. 5 % for porcine kidney, and 29. 8 % <b>for</b> <b>poultry</b> kidney. Decision limits (CC&# 945;) comprised values from 10. 37 to 3298. 43 µg kg- 1 for porcine kidney and 10. 08 to 3176. 59 µg kg- 1 <b>for</b> <b>poultry</b> kidney. Detection capabilities (CC&# 946;) varied from 10. 73 to 3396. 86 µg kg- 1 for porcine kidney and 10. 67 to 3253. 19 µg kg- 1 <b>for</b> <b>poultry</b> kidney.

40|$|In the Netherlands, {{measures}} for mitigation of Particulate Matter (PM) emissions are needed <b>for</b> <b>poultry</b> houses {{to lower their}} contribution to elevated ambient PM concentrations. In this study, we 1) investigated whether on-farm drying systems (DS) <b>for</b> <b>poultry</b> manure can remove PM from the exhaust air flow, and 2) evaluated the contribution of DS to ammonia emissions. At two layer facilities, a total of twelve 24 -hour measurements were carried out of temperature, relative humidity, ventilation rate, PM and ammonia between December 2009 and February 2010. A substantial removal of inhalable dust (69 % for house 1), PM 10 (83 % for house 1; 33 % for house 2) and PM 2. 5 (57 % for house 1; 32 % for house 2) was found. Concentrations of ammonia however, increased by a factor 5. 0 (house 1) and 3. 6 (house 2) over the manure layer. This study shows that DS <b>for</b> <b>poultry</b> manure show good ability to remove PM, but further research is necessary to avoid problem swapping by elevating emissions of other pollutants...|$|R
