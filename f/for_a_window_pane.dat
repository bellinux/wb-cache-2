The resulting model {{is intended for}} direct implementation into zone-type computer fire codes. The developed model has been implemented into the WPI/Fire Code, {{and the results of}} this model’s implementation and validation are presented...|$|R
50|$|On July 16, 2008, a man demanded {{access to}} KPFT's studios. After being rebuffed, he punched out <b>a</b> <b>window</b> <b>pane</b> {{on the back}} door with a knife. The man was apprehended without resistance, and was {{promptly}} arrested.|$|R
5000|$|The oldest {{house in}} the town is Castle House, which has a {{marriage}} stone dated 1683. Robert Burns stayed there {{in the summer of}} 1787 and inscribed this verse on <b>a</b> <b>window</b> <b>pane,</b> now in <b>a</b> Vancouver museum: ...|$|R

60|$|And the schooner's {{head was}} laid for that elusive glimmer in the sky, which began already to pale in lustre and {{diminish}} in size, as the stain of breath vanishes from <b>a</b> <b>window</b> <b>pane.</b> At {{the same time}} she was reefed close down.|$|R

The <b>window</b> <b>pane</b> may be configured {{to contact}} a sealing system. The retention frame may be configured {{to contact the}} sealing system and hold the <b>window</b> <b>pane</b> against the support frame. The biasing system may be configured to bias the retention frame toward the support frame while the support frame and the retention frame are in a configuration that holds the <b>window</b> <b>pane.</b> Removal of the biasing system may cause the retention frame and the <b>window</b> <b>pane</b> to be removable...|$|R
5000|$|Kirkliston {{is often}} given the {{nickname}} of [...] "Cheesetown". One {{theory is that}} this because of an inscription mentioning cheese inscribed by Burns on <b>a</b> <b>window</b> <b>pane</b> of Castle House, formerly <b>an</b> inn. The <b>window</b> <b>pane</b> in question was put on show in the late 19th century at Broxburn in the Strathbock Inn. No satisfactory explanation has been given for Burns stopping here {{at the start of}} his Highland Tour and the poet himself has left no record of the event and the details of the whereabouts of the pane itself has been lost.|$|R
50|$|From 1780 to 1797 James McMurdo was the chamberlain to the Duke of Queensberry {{and was a}} {{good friend}} of Robert Burns, who wrote a poem in tribute to McMurdo. Burns is {{recorded}} to have etched a verse from this tribute onto <b>a</b> <b>window</b> <b>pane</b> at McMurdo's dwelling on the estate.|$|R

60|$|The {{leader of}} the Wheelers hesitated to give this order, so Tiktok shook him as a terrier dog does a rat, until the Wheeler's teeth rattled {{together}} with a noise like hailstones on <b>a</b> <b>window</b> <b>pane.</b> Then, {{as soon as the}} creature could get its breath, it shouted to the others to roll away, which they immediately did.|$|R
5000|$|In {{a letter}} to Signe Læssøe from July 1836, Hans Christian Andersen {{mentions}} how he once, when staying in Norske Løve, looked <b>for</b> <b>an</b> inscription in <b>a</b> <b>window</b> <b>pane</b> which he had heard about reading [...] "Oh God Oh God in Køge". When {{he was unable to}} find it, he engraved the words himself, so that others would not have to search for it in vain. Both inscriptions are now on display in Køge Museum but whether they are authentic is unclear.|$|R
500|$|In {{the early}} 15th century, Mary held a central {{position}} in Christian iconography and was often portrayed {{as the one}} in whom the [...] "Word was made flesh", {{a direct result of the}} work of the divine light. During the medieval period, light acted as <b>a</b> visual symbol <b>for</b> both the immaculate conception and Christ's birth; it was believed that he was made manifest by God's light passing through Mary's body, just as light shines through <b>a</b> <b>window</b> <b>pane.</b>|$|R
50|$|Grant gained {{entry to}} the homes of his victims from the side or the rear, either through open windows or by {{removing}} <b>a</b> <b>window</b> <b>pane</b> entirely. He had been known to use tools stolen from the victim's own garden shed to remove the window beading. He ripped out the telephone wires, either before entering the property, or after gaining access. He then disabled the lights either by switching off the electricity at the meter or by unscrewing lightbulbs from their sockets.|$|R
50|$|In early 2007, school {{officials}} said they worry that a child might be seriously injured in an accident involving the school's many large glass windows, {{some of which are}} floor-to-ceiling and not shatter-resistant. The windows of the building, which was constructed in 1963, are often made of single panes of glass instead of more modern double- or triple-panes that insulate better. A few years before 2007, a student leaning back in his chair accidentally struck <b>a</b> <b>window</b> <b>pane</b> which then shattered.|$|R
50|$|Henry and Ann, {{who made}} an {{unsuccessful}} suicide attempt and now hover {{in a sort}} of limbo between life and death, have not quite crossed over. Scrubby, the ship's steward, has already been condemned to sail the ship for eternity, having previously committed suicide himself. Henry is eventually saved from asphyxiation by gas poisoning when his dog breaks <b>a</b> <b>window</b> <b>pane.</b> He calls to Ann, she revives, and together they are rescued by neighbors and taken away in an ambulance.|$|R
50|$|Patrick Miller {{sold the}} farm {{outright}} for £1900 to John Morin of Laggan, the adjacent property. In 1805 Morin sold Ellisland to a Mr Taylor who dismantled and remodelled the steading, although the farmhouse is {{much as it}} was in Burns's time. The parlour is thought to have remained unchanged. Burns's favourite line from Pope An honest man's the noblest work of God, was engraved on <b>a</b> <b>window</b> <b>pane,</b> although this was vandalised with a piece of flint about March 1876. Ellisland was farmed until 1921.|$|R
5000|$|Olga Printzlau (December 13, 1891 [...] - [...] July 8, 1962) was an American screenwriter. She {{wrote for}} 69 films between 1915 and 1933. She also wrote <b>a</b> play, <b>Window</b> <b>Panes,</b> which was staged in Los Angeles in 1928, and won praise from the Los Angeles Times.|$|R
5000|$|In 1918 Jesuit Superiors {{decided to}} close the College {{division}} in order to focus more attention on other Universities in the Northeast. It remained closed until 1930; during this time, however, the Preparatory division remained open. The College division reopened in another location in 1930 and in 1936 settled at its current location. The College and Preparatory departments were officially incorporated separately on February 10, 1955. Although Saint Peter's College has not been located at 144 Grand for over eighty years, at an entrance to the original building, Shalloe Hall, <b>a</b> <b>window</b> <b>pane</b> above the door still reads [...] "Saint Peter's College." ...|$|R
50|$|In 1787 Burns {{toured the}} Highlands with Willie Nicol as a {{companion}} and visited Falkirk en route {{where he is}} said to have inscribed <b>a</b> glass <b>window</b> <b>pane</b> of the Cross Keys Inn with 4 lines beginning - 'Sound be his sleep and blithe his morn'; dated 25th. August 1787.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} {{became a}} {{concern in the}} interest of public safety in November 2007, after <b>a</b> <b>window</b> <b>pane</b> fell from the building's 27th storey and landed on the road below. The pane shattered before it hit the ground, narrowly missing pedestrians and cars. The pane is one of more than 200 of which that have fallen from Waterfront Place since 1990, due to an impurity of nickel sulfate in the glass, which causes the glass to expand and shatter when it gets hot. In the mid-1990s, more than 300 windows containing the impurity were replaced in the building, however it is understood that there are still more windows with the defect. Following the 2007 incident, additional awnings were constructed across Felix Street to prevent falling <b>window</b> <b>panes</b> from landing on vehicles and pedestrians, and the marina in the Brisbane River has been dismantled.|$|R
60|$|We stared {{with all}} our eyes, and there, yes, there, far ahead of us, was a faint, glimmering spot, no larger than <b>a</b> cottage <b>window</b> <b>pane.</b> It was so faint that I doubt if any eyes, except those which, like ours, had for days seen nothing but blackness, could have {{perceived}} it at all.|$|R
5000|$|... "Hey Grandpa! What's for supper?"—Grandpa Jones is {{cleaning}} <b>a</b> <b>window</b> <b>pane</b> (with no {{glass in}} it, {{as evidenced by}} Jones' hand dangling through the <b>window</b> <b>pane</b> as he recites the menu) and when the entire cast (off-camera) asks, [...] "Hey, Grandpa, what's for supper," [...] he recites a dinner menu in poetic verse. Often, he describes a delicious, country-style meal (e.g., chicken and biscuits smothered in rich gravy, and collard greens), and the cast would reply approvingly, [...] "yum-m yum-m!" [...] Sometimes he would serve a less than spectacular meal (thawed out TV dinners), to which the cast would reply, [...] "yuck!" [...] One notable run-through of the routine had Grandpa saying [...] "Ah ain't got nuthin'," [...] which {{would be one of}} the few times he ever got booed during this routine. The second time was when he offered [...] "a big fresh roast of good moose meat." ...|$|R
50|$|The film {{concentrates}} more on {{the period}} spent in hospital than the original novel, and emphasizes {{the horror of the}} friends' injuries. On Adrien's arrival at the ward, all the mirrors are removed and staff are instructed not to give any to him, but we see from the expressions on the faces of others just how bad the damage is. Adrien becomes increasingly desperate to see the damage done to his face, even asking a visitor to draw a picture of him. Dupeyron ensures that we do not see the horrifying extent of Adrien's injuries until the moment that he himself does - by looking at his reflection in <b>a</b> <b>window</b> <b>pane.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Macdonald {{explained}} that the film [...] "doesnt have a traditional story or a traditional narrative, but it has thematic movement…and ... recurring characters." [...] He praised certain specific contributions, including [...] "the most technically amazing skydiving shot I have ever seen in any film" [...] and [...] "a hand going up to <b>a</b> <b>window</b> <b>pane</b> and picking <b>a</b> fly off and filming the hand walking {{through the house and}} letting the fly go—and you see the fly take off in the distance." [...] Asked if there any particular submission crystallized the films theme, Macdonald cited [...] "the family who had been going through cancer." [...] More generally, Macdonald praised the immediacy that a handycam permits.|$|R
5000|$|Éponine, now ragged and emaciated, visits Marius at his {{apartment}} to beg for money. To impress him, she tries to prove her literacy by reading aloud from a book and by writing [...] "The Cops Are Here" [...] {{on a sheet of}} paper. Marius pities her and gives her some money. After Éponine leaves, Marius observes the [...] "Jondrettes" [...] in their apartment through a crack in the wall. Éponine comes in and announces that a philanthropist and his daughter are arriving to visit them. In order to look poorer, Thénardier puts out the fire and breaks a chair. He also orders Azelma to punch out <b>a</b> <b>window</b> <b>pane,</b> which she does, resulting in cutting her hand (as Thénardier had hoped).|$|R
60|$|You must {{figure the}} street full of running figures, of doors {{slamming}} and fights for hiding-places. You must figure the tumult suddenly striking on the unstable equilibrium of old Fletcher's planks and two chairs--with cataclysmic results. You must figure an appalled couple caught dismally in a swing. And {{then the whole}} tumultuous rush has passed and the Iping street with its gauds and flags is deserted save for the still raging unseen, and littered with cocoanuts, overthrown canvas screens, and the scattered stock in trade of a sweetstuff stall. Everywhere there is a sound of closing shutters and shoving bolts, and the only visible humanity is an occasional flitting eye under a raised eyebrow {{in the corner of}} <b>a</b> <b>window</b> <b>pane.</b>|$|R
50|$|During the 1980s, the Cathedral's {{stained glass}} was {{replaced}} and parishioners invited to purchase <b>a</b> commemorative <b>window</b> <b>pane</b> {{in honour of}} a deceased relative and to help defray the $100,000 cost. In 1989, to mark the centenary of the opening of St Patrick's, a new bell tower was constructed by Bill Walsh and the Toowoomba City Council donated 35 trees for the cathedral's grounds as a civic gift.|$|R
5000|$|White's early {{electronic}} art consisted mostly of gridded installations of light bulbs controlled by contemporary-vintage digital logic circuits. Like {{most of his}} art, these displays were concerned more with communicating internal rules and behaviours than simple visual appeal. For example, White's first major electronic work, [...] "First Tighten Up on the Drums" [...] (1969), generated shimmering light patterns through the unpredictable interaction of many interconnected circuits computing simple logical questions independently. The work illustrated how complex behaviours - for example, patterns akin to swirling clouds or rain on <b>a</b> <b>window</b> <b>pane</b> - can emerge from simple principles. In retrospect, White recognizes this first project as an early cellular automata experiment. He constructed approximately a dozen similar light machines during the early 1970s, culminating in [...] "Splish Splash 2" [...] (1975), a large light mural commissioned for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's Vancouver offices.|$|R
60|$|At length {{they came}} within full {{sight of the}} palace, which proved to be very large and lofty, with {{a great number of}} airy pinnacles upon its roof. Though it was midday, and the sun shone brightly over the marble front, yet its snowy whiteness, and its fantastic style of architecture, made it look unreal, like the frost work on <b>a</b> <b>window</b> <b>pane,</b> or like the shapes of castles which one sees among the clouds by moonlight. But, just then, a puff of wind brought down the smoke of the kitchen chimney among them, and caused each man to smell the odor of the dish that he liked best; and, after scenting it, they thought {{everything}} else moonshine, and nothing real save this palace, and save the banquet that was evidently ready to be served up in it.|$|R
60|$|Everybody turned. The {{speaker was}} a woman, gazing {{down upon the}} group from <b>an</b> upper <b>window,</b> whose <b>panes</b> blazed in the ruddy glare from the west. Her lips were parted and she {{appeared}} for the moment to forget where she was.|$|R
50|$|The Jondrettes support {{themselves}} by sending letters begging {{for money to}} well-known philanthropists. Éponine comes in the apartment in a rush and announces that a philanthropist and his daughter are arriving any minute to visit them. In order to look poorer, M. Jondrette puts out their fire and breaks a chair. He then orders Azelma to punch out <b>a</b> <b>window</b> <b>pane.</b> Although hesitant, she does so, resulting in cutting her hand. M. Jondrette is pleased, for he had hoped for that result. The philanthropist and his daughter then come into their apartment; they {{turn out to be}} Valjean and Cosette. Marius, observing the Jondrettes through a crack in the wall, recognizes Cosette as the girl he met in the Luxembourg Garden. After their visit, M. Jondrette arranges with Valjean to meet again, but after recognizing Valjean, he plots to rob him upon his arrival with the aid of the street gang Patron-Minette.|$|R
60|$|There was <b>a</b> <b>window</b> {{with small}} <b>panes</b> of glass close at hand, {{and going to}} this the two youths peered into the cottage. To their {{surprise}} they could see nobody. Both lower rooms of the old building seemed to be unoccupied.|$|R
60|$|Robinson trotted off, and Welch and Tony {{made their}} way to the Pavilion. There, sure enough, was the window, or rather the absence of <b>window.</b> <b>A</b> <b>pane</b> had been neatly removed, evidently in the {{orthodox}} way by means of a diamond.|$|R
60|$|The next {{who saw the}} Strange Bird was a solicitor's {{clerk at}} Iping Hanger, who was {{climbing}} the hill before breakfast, to see the sunrise. Save <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few dissolving wisps of cloud the sky had been blown clear in the night. At first {{he thought it was}} an eagle he saw. It was near the zenith, and incredibly remote, a mere bright speck above the pink cirri, and it seemed as if it fluttered and beat itself against the sky, as an imprisoned swallow might do against <b>a</b> <b>window</b> <b>pane.</b> Then down it came into the shadow of the earth, sweeping in a great curve towards Portburdock and round over the Hanger, and so vanishing behind the woods of Siddermorton Park. It seemed larger than a man. Just before it was hidden, the light of the rising sun smote {{over the edge of the}} downs and touched its wings, and they flashed with the brightness of flames and the colour of precious stones, and so passed, leaving the witness agape.|$|R
40|$|The noise {{reduction}} characteristics of general-aviation-type, dual-pane windows in various configurations have been experimentally investigated. The effects of {{inner and outer}} pane thickness, spacing between the panes, edge conditions, inclination of the inner pane and depressurization of the air in between the panes are presented. The space in between the two <b>window</b> <b>panes</b> is sealed airtight in all cases. Results show that increasing the mass of <b>a</b> 'floating' <b>window</b> <b>pane</b> does not increase the {{noise reduction}} below the fundamental resonance frequency. It is concluded {{that the concept of}} depressurization of the air between thin (1 / 8 in) Plexiglas panes and application of multiple-freedom edge conditions for the inner pane are promising to reduce noise levels in general aviation airplanes...|$|R
500|$|The video {{begins with}} Scherzinger hiding out from police, evading capture and disguising herself with some aviator shades and a studded hoodie. As {{she is being}} {{surveyed}} by security camera, Scherzinger begins to dance athletically and acrobatically. Jenna Hally Rubenstein of MTV Buzzworthy believed that part of Scherzinger's dance contained old Navajo rain dance moves. Scherzinger than alternates outfits to a black leather - corset top, high-waisted shorts and thigh-high boots, as scenes of Scherzinger singing behind <b>a</b> <b>window</b> <b>pane</b> while it’s raining are interlaced into the clip. Scherzinger, accompanied {{by a group of}} female dancers, than enter an indoor swimming pool were men are seen spraying graffiti into the wall. Scherzinger and her back-up dancers than begin to dance in the emptied concrete pool, as the men begin to soak Scherzinger with hoses. As the police enter the building, Scherzinger is warned by a man acting as a lookout. Scherzinger and all her companions escape, only to leave the police discovering a spray-painted message of [...] "Wet".|$|R
