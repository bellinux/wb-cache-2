5|$|Two {{types of}} central forces—those that {{increase}} linearly with distance, F = Cr, such as Hooke's law, and inverse-square forces, , such as Newton's law of universal gravitation and Coulomb's law—have {{a very unusual}} property. A particle moving under either type of force always returns to its starting place with its <b>initial</b> <b>velocity,</b> provided that it lacks sufficient energy to move out to infinity. In other words, {{the path of a}} bound particle is always closed and its motion repeats indefinitely, no matter what its initial position or velocity. As shown by Bertrand's theorem, this property is not true for other types of forces; in general, a particle will not return to its starting point with the same velocity.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, the Soviets {{unveiled}} the T-26 mod. 1933. The Model 1933, {{with a new}} single cylindrical turret carrying one 45mm cannon L46 (length in calibers, which meant quite high <b>initial</b> <b>velocity,</b> over 700–800m/s depending on ammunition) and one 7.62 mm machine gun, became the most common T-26 variant. The 45mm 20K tank gun {{was based on the}} Soviet 45 mm anti-tank gun M1932 (19-K) {{and it was one of}} the most powerful anti-tank guns of its time. Actually, few, if any, western tanks existed with similar guns. The T-26 could carry up to three secondary DT 7.62mm machine guns in coaxial, rear, and anti-aircraft mounts. This increased firepower was intended to aid crews in defeating dedicated anti-tank teams, as the original machine gun armament had been found insufficient. The turret rear ball mounting for the additional DT tank machine gun was installed on the T-26 tanks from the end of 1935 until 1939.|$|E
5|$|The Mk 8 Rangekeeper was an {{electromechanical}} {{analog computer}} whose function was to continuously calculate the gun's bearing and elevation, Line-Of-Fire (LOF), {{to hit a}} future position of the target. It did this by automatically receiving information from the director (LOS), the FC Radar (range), the ship's gyrocompass (true ship's course), the ship's Pitometer log (ship's speed), the Stable Vertical (ship's roll and pitch), and the ship's anemometer (relative wind speed and direction). Also, before the surface action started, the FTs made manual inputs for the average <b>initial</b> <b>velocity</b> of the projectiles fired out of the battery's gun barrels, and air density. With all this information, the Rangekeeper calculated the relative motion between the ship and the target. It then could calculate an offset angle and change of range between the target's present position (LOS) and future position {{at the end of}} the projectile's time of flight. To this bearing and range offset, it added corrections for gravity, wind, Magnus effect of the spinning projectile, earth's curvature, and coriolis effect. The result was the turret's bearing and elevation orders (LOF). During the surface action, range and deflection Spots and target altitude (not zero during Gun Fire Support) were manually entered.|$|E
40|$|Standard {{particle}} swarm optimization cannot guarantee convergence to {{the global}} optimum in multi-modal search spaces, so multiple swarms can be useful. The multiple swarms all need initial positions and <b>initial</b> <b>velocities</b> for their particles. Several simple strategies to select initial positions and <b>initial</b> <b>velocities</b> are presented. A series of experiments isolates {{the effects of these}} selected <b>initial</b> positions and <b>velocities</b> compared to random <b>initial</b> positions and <b>velocities.</b> A first set of experiments shows how locust swarms benefit from 'scouting' for initial positions and the use of <b>initial</b> <b>velocities</b> that 'launch away' from the previous optimum. A second set of experiments show that the performance of WoSP (Waves of Swarm Particles) can be improved by using new search strategies to select the initial positions and <b>initial</b> <b>velocities</b> for the particles in its sub-swarms...|$|R

25|$|The {{other problem}} in {{duplicating}} the experimental conditions {{is the problem}} of maintaining fixed charge density in the two baths. This problem is treated by maintaining the specified density in two buffer regions extending from the boundary plane toward the membrane. The number of ions needed to maintain the density in the two buffer regions is calculated {{at the start of the}} simulations. The count of the ions in these buffers is sampled throughout the simulation and an ion is injected whenever a deficit is observed. The <b>initial</b> <b>velocity</b> of the injected particle is decided according to Maxwellian distribution. It should be noted that the ions can leave the system only by exiting through the two Dirichlet boundary planes and an ion is not removed artificially from these buffer regions. The reflections from the Neumann boundary planes are treated as elastic reflections.|$|E
500|$|For most {{practical}} non-mounted archery purposes, composite construction offers no advantage; [...] "the <b>initial</b> <b>velocity</b> {{is about the}} same for all types of bow... within certain limits, the design parameters... appear to be less important than is often claimed." [...] However, they are superior for horsemen and in the specialized art of flight archery: [...] "A combination of many technical factors made the composite flight bow better for flight shooting." [...] The higher arrow velocity is only for well-designed composite bows of high draw-weight. At the weights more usual for modern amateurs, the greater density of horn and sinew compared to wood usually cancels any advantage.|$|E
500|$|However, Newton's theorem {{shows that}} an inverse-cubic force may {{be applied to}} a {{particle}} moving under a linear or inverse-square force such that its orbit remains closed, provided that k equals a rational number. (A number is called [...] "rational" [...] {{if it can be}} written as a fraction m/n, where m and n are integers.) In such cases, the addition of the inverse-cubic force causes the particle to complete m rotations about the center of force in {{the same time that the}} original particle completes n rotations. This method for producing closed orbits does not violate Bertrand's theorem, because the added inverse-cubic force depends on the <b>initial</b> <b>velocity</b> of the particle.|$|E

50|$|A {{distinctive}} feature of sub-swarms {{is that their}} initial positions and <b>initial</b> <b>velocities</b> are not randomly selected as in normal swarms. Instead, they maintain some information from the previous trajectories of the particles. In general, the development of multi-swarm systems leads to design decisions which did not exist during the original development of particle swarm optimization, such {{as the number of}} particles to use in each sub-swarm, the optimal value for the constriction factor and the effects of non-random initial positions and <b>initial</b> <b>velocities.</b> These design decisions have been thoroughly studied and have well-established guidelines - e.g. the use of non-random initial positions and <b>initial</b> <b>velocities</b> leads to improved results in multi-swarm systems, which is not the case for single-swarms. Other design decisions, such as which diversification method to use or which specific search strategy will select the initial positions and <b>initial</b> <b>velocities</b> of a sub-swarm, have less established guidelines and constitute open questions in the field of multi-swarm systems.|$|R

40|$|A {{new method}} is {{described}} for estimating <b>initial</b> <b>velocities</b> of enzyme-catalysed reactions. It is simple to apply either graphically or numerically, and is particularly appropriate for experiments {{in which the}} initial straight part of the progress curve is very short or non-existent. It requires no more knowledge than is readily available about the details ofthe system, such as the extent ofreaction at equilibrium, the rate ofenzyme inactivation, the nature of product inhibition etc., unlike some other methods of analysing progress curves, which are often invalidated by small errors in the defining assumptions. The direct linear plot (Eisenthal & Cornish-Bowden, 1974) provides a simple method ofanalysing <b>initial</b> <b>velocities</b> measured in enzyme kinetic experi-ments, and its statistical treatment (Cornish-Bowden & Eisenthal, 1974) is both easier to understand and less dependent on arbitrary assumptions than the widely used method of least squares. But effective analysis of <b>initial</b> <b>velocities</b> satisfies only one-half of the problem, because it presupposes a reliable method of estimating <b>initial</b> <b>velocities</b> from progress curves. This is difficult to do accurately {{unless there is a}} significant linear period {{at the beginning of each}} curve, and any systematic error that results from subjective bias is unlikely to be detected by subsequent statistical treatment.
