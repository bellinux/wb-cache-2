5|$|He gave a {{magnificent}} speech. He {{is one of}} the cleverest speakers I have ever heard. The questions on the Mundt-Nixon bill, his views on the loyalty oath, and the problem of international communism were just what he was waiting for. Indeed, he was so skillful—and, I might add, cagey—that those who came indifferent were sold, and even many of those who came to heckle went away with doubts... If he is only a fraction as effective as he was <b>here</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> a formidable opponent on your hands.|$|E
25|$|When Reish Lakish {{would see}} Jews from the Exile {{gathering}} in the marketplace in the Land of Israel {{he would say to}} them, 'Scatter yourselves.' He said to them: 'When you ascended you did not do so as a wall, and <b>here</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> come to make a wall.|$|E
500|$|The album {{also takes}} aim at small {{companies}} {{put out of}} business by giant corporations. Cool made an example out of record shops closing when a national retailer makes it to town. [...] "It's like there's just one voice you can hear," [...] he said. [...] "Not {{to sound like a}} preachy person, but it's getting towards the Big Brother of George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four— except <b>here</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> two or three corporations running everything." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Beg pardon, yes--you're always begging pardon. Look <b>here,</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> better {{bring your}} wife and have dinner in the servants' hall to-day, and drink a glass of port." ...|$|R

500|$|At the fort, Moultrie {{ordered his}} men to {{concentrate}} their fire on the two large man-of-war ships, Bristol and Experiment, which took hit after hit from the fort's guns. Chain shot fired at Bristol eventually destroyed much of her rigging and severely damaged both the main- and mizzenmasts. One round hit her quarterdeck, slightly wounding Parker in the knee and thigh. The shot also tore off part of his britches, leaving his backside exposed. By mid-afternoon, the defenders were running out of gunpowder, and their fire was briefly suspended. However, Lee sent more ammunition and gunpowder over from the mainland, and the defenders resumed firing at the British ships; Lee even briefly visited the fort late in the day, telling Colonel Moultrie, [...] "I see you are doing very well <b>here,</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> no occasion for me, I will {{go up to the}} town again." [...] Admiral Parker eventually sought to destroy the fort's walls with persistent broadside cannonades. This strategy failed due to the spongy nature of the palmetto wood used in its constructions; the structure would quiver, and it absorbed the cannonballs rather than splintering. [...] The exchange continued until around 9:00 pm, when darkness forced a cessation of hostilities, and the fleet finally withdrew out of range.|$|E
2500|$|... "I don't mind {{going on}} record as saying that {{he is one of}} the few instinctively funny men on our stage," [...] wrote {{reviewer}} Charles Darnton in the New York Evening World. [...] "Everything he touches turns to fun. To watch him is to marvel at his humorous vitality. He is the old-time minstrel man turned to modern account. With a song, a word, or even a suggestion he calls forth spontaneous laughter. And <b>here</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> the definition of a born comedian." ...|$|E
2500|$|Brad Keselowski {{held off}} a hard-charging Ryan Newman and Matt Kenseth {{to win the}} GEICO 500. “I can’t believe it,” Keselowski said. “Talladega is such a wild card {{and to be able}} to win <b>here</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to catch breaks and make your own breaks, a little of both. I can’t believe we won at Talladega. This race is the scariest of the three in the bracket. To be able to win here is really a privilege, it really is.” Kyle Busch, Dale Earnhardt, Jr., Kasey Kahne and Jimmie Johnson were the four drivers who were eliminated. [...] "We had a real good car most of the day," [...] Earnhardt said. [...] "Got real loose, kind of shuffled out. ... It's just hard racing. That's the way it goes at the end of these races. We weren't in good position." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Now that you're <b>here</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> {{better make}} sure of a bargain while <b>you</b> <b>have</b> a chance," [...] he said. [...] "Say, {{as a matter of}} {{friendship}} I'll put them in at five per cent. under your best offer from Winnipeg." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, I tell <b>you</b> what. Look <b>here.</b> <b>You</b> <b>had</b> better try the Secretarial Department,' {{he said at}} last, sidling to {{the bell}} and ringing it. 'Jenkinson,' to the mashed {{potatoes}} messenger, 'Mr Wobbler!' ...|$|R
2500|$|In 2015, Tasmanian Archbishop Julius Porteous {{distributed}} {{a booklet}} outlining the Catholic Church's position on marriage, titled [...] "Don't mess with Marriage". It encouraged parents to lobby parliamentarians against same-sex marriage. An application {{was made by}} Martine Delaney, a Hobart transgender activist and Greens candidate, to Tasmania’s Anti-Discrimination Commission over the booklet. John Roskam, writing in the Australian Financial Review has said, [...] "A vote in a plebiscite or referendum, in which one side {{is not allowed to}} present its case, is not a legitimate vote. That's why both supporters and opponents of same-sex marriage should be concerned by the complaint against Archbishop Porteous and the Catholic Church. Freedom of speech is fundamental to liberal democracy. Freedom of speech confers legitimacy on political outcomes". [...] The Anti-Discrimination Commission subsequently upheld the complaint. Senator Eric Abetz said that the church’s right to [...] "teach its flock" [...] its beliefs on marriage were being [...] "shut down". Janet Albrechtsen, writing in The Australian says, [...] "This is not one of those thorny cases of conflicting rights where you have to come down on one side or another. It’s not a case of either supporting same-sex marriage or supporting free speech. <b>Here</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> the luxury of both. [...] This is not about defending the Catholic bishops. The real issue is the emergence of yet another orthodoxy that is strangling free speech".|$|E
