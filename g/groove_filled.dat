60|$|The scapula {{resembles that}} of the {{cetacean}} Hyperoodon, but the supra- spinous fossa is larger and more seal-like; as is the humerus, which {{differs from that of}} the Cetacea in presenting true articular surfaces for the free jointing of the bones of the fore-arm. In the apparently complete absence of hinder limbs, and in the characters of the vertebral column, the Zeuglodon lies on the cetacean side of the boundary line; so that upon the whole, the Zeuglodonts, transitional as they are, are conveniently retained in the cetacean order. And the publication, in 1864, of M. Van Beneden's memoir on the Miocene and Pliocene Squalodon, furnished much better means than anatomists previously possessed of fitting in another link of the chain which connects the existing Cetacea with Zeuglodon. The teeth are much more numerous, although the molars exhibit the zeuglodont double fang; the nasal bones are very short, and the upper surface of the rostrum presents the <b>groove,</b> <b>filled</b> up during life by the prolongation of the ethmoidal cartilage, which is so characteristic {{of the majority of the}} Cetacea.|$|E

30|$|Holes filling method gives {{possibility}} to introduce more quantity of powder {{compared with that}} of <b>groove</b> <b>filling</b> method.

Similarly, holes filling and closing method gives more control over the particle incorporation compared with that of <b>groove</b> <b>filling</b> and holes filling methods but requires more operations. For applications, where more quantity is not necessary but slight modification is enough to alter the surface properties, simple <b>groove</b> <b>filling</b> method or <b>groove</b> <b>filling</b> and closing method can be adapted. <b>Groove</b> <b>filling</b> method is also appropriate to obtain thick composite layers compared with other processes as shown in Table  1. Of course, the thickness of a composite layer depends on the FSP tool pin dimensions and processing parameters. Where applications demand more amount of secondary phase at the surface, holes filling or holes filling and closing method can be chosen.|$|R
30|$|<b>Groove</b> <b>filling</b> was {{the first}} method {{proposed}} in the literature to produce a composite by FSP (Mishra et al. 2003). It is simple and requires less machining. A straight groove can be produced on the workpiece using ordinary milling cutter. Recently, Gandra et al. (2011) has studied {{the position of the}} groove with respect to the tool pin and demonstrated that if the groove is placed under the pin, the powder distribution is found to be more compared with placing the groove outside the pin interaction area (advancing or retrieving). Another strategy was proposed by Heydarian et al. (2014) in <b>groove</b> <b>filling</b> method in which parallel grooves with gradient groove depths were produced and FSP was carried out. Compared with single groove, composite produced from the gradient grooves was found to have uniform distribution of the powder. Whereas the <b>groove</b> <b>filling</b> and closing method needs additional tools such as pin-less FSP tool, and also the process involves two cycles; one to close the groove, and the second to produce the composite. The amount of secondary phase that can be introduced into the workpiece is more in <b>groove</b> <b>filling</b> and closing method compared with simple <b>groove</b> <b>filling</b> method because it prevents the escape of filled particles during FSP.|$|R

40|$|The endothelial protein C {{receptor}} (EPCR) {{plays an}} important role in cardiovascular disease by binding protein C/activated protein C (APC). EPCR structure contains a hydrophobic <b>groove</b> <b>filled</b> with an unknown phospholipid needed to perform its function. It has not been established whether lipid exchange takes place in EPCR as a regulatory mechanism of its activity. Our objective was to identify this phospholipid and to explore the possibility of lipid exchange as a regulatory mechanism of EPCR activity driven by the endothelially expressed secretory group V phospholipase A 2 (sPLA 2 -V). We identified phosphatidylcholine (PCh) as the major phospholipid bound to human soluble EPCR (sEPCR). PCh in EPCR could be exchanged for lysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPCh) and platelet activating factor (PAF). Remarkably, lysoPCh and PAF impaired the protein C binding ability of sEPCR. Inhibition of sPLA 2 -V, responsible for lysoPCh and PAF generation, improved APC binding to endothelial cells. EPCR-dependent protein C activation and APC antiapoptotic effect were thus significantly enhanced. In contrast, endothelial cell supplementation with sPLA 2 -V inhibited both APC generation and its antiapoptotic effects. We conclude that APC generation and function can be modulated by changes in phospholipid occupancy of its endothelial cell receptor...|$|E
40|$|Recently it {{has been}} found that stable and {{accurate}} molecular dynamics (MD) of B-DNA duplexes can be obtained in relatively inexpensive computational conditions with the bulk solvent represented implicitly, but the minor <b>groove</b> <b>filled</b> with explicit water (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998, 120, 10928). The present paper further explores these simulation conditions {{in order to understand the}} main factors responsible for the observed surprisingly good agreement with experimental data. It appears that in the case of the EcoRI dodecamer certain sequence specific hydration patterns in the minor groove earlier known from experimental data are formed spontaneously in the course of MD simulations. The effect is reliably reproduced in several independent computational experiments in different simulation conditions. With all major groove water removed, closely similar results are obtained, with even better reproducibility. On the other hand, without explicit hydration, metastable dynamics around a B-DNA like state can be obtained which, however, only poorly compares with experimental data. It appears, therefore, that a right-handed DNA helix with explicitly hydrated minor groove is a minimal model system where the experimental properties of B-DNA can be reproduced with non-trivial sequence-dependent effects. Its small size makes possible virtually exhaustive sampling, which is a major advantage with respect to alternative approaches.

40|$|Rubber covered {{cylinders}} in {{rolling contact}} are studied in two cases; rolling over {{a flat surface}} and rolling over a groove. In the first case, two different finite element procedures are compared {{for the purpose of}} investigating if computational savings can be made when taking amplitude dependent effects into account by using a modified viscoelastic steady state rolling procedure. This procedure is compared with using a more expensive overlay method with an elastoplastic-viscoelastic material model. The two procedures and material models are shown two give equal results in the flat surface case. For the case of rolling over a groove, it is shown how the non-linear dynamic material characteristics of the rubber layer influence the rolling contact. The <b>groove</b> <b>filling</b> capacity of the rubber is shown to be strongly dependent on the material model.

Also, it reduces the necessity of using additional tool (without pin) to close the groove or holes before FSP. As reported by Faraji et al.

But making the secondary phase into the form of layers or laminas is difficult particularly with hard and brittle ceramic materials. Also, the secondary phase may present in the matrix {{in the form of}} large particles after FSP as there is no control over the breakdown of the layers during the process. There are a few studies clearly demonstrated that if the dispersing particle size is reduced, the surface properties were found to be improved (Liu et al. 2013; Morisada et al. 2007; Sabbaghian et al. 2014; Ratna Sunil et al. 2014 a; Ratna Sunil et al. 2014 b; Miranda et al. 2013).
