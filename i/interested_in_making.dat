5|$|The game {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} upon release. Critics praised the game's colourful visuals, boss battles and special effects, but most cited its poor control schemes, aesthetics and general gameplay as major flaws.

5|$|By 1930, {{the wine}} {{industry}} had weakened {{due to the}} Great Depression and Prohibition. Many vineyards that survived by supplying the home market were located in California's Central Valley, a non-optimal environment for growing quality Zinfandel. Thus, the end of Prohibition left a shortage of quality wine grapes, and Zinfandel sank into obscurity as most was blended into undistinguished fortified wines. However, some producers remained <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>making</b> single varietal red wines.|$|E

5|$|Valve {{struggled}} to find a publisher, as many believed the game was too ambitious for a first-time developer. Sierra On-Line signed Valve for a one-game deal as it was <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>making</b> a 3D action game, especially one based on the Quake engine. Valve first showed Half-Life in early 1997; it was a success at Electronic Entertainment Expo that year, where Valve demonstrated the game's animation and artificial intelligence.|$|E
5|$|Nearby Sierra Nevada Brewing Company {{partnered with}} the monks of New Clairvaux {{to make a}} series of Belgian-style beers under the Ovila Abbey brand. In late 2010, the beer {{producer}} launched a website to tell about {{the making of the}} beer product line and the story of the restoration of the stones. Sierra Nevada founder Ken Grossman said he had long been <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>making</b> a line of Belgian beers, and the abbey's project provided a good opportunity. The first product, a Dubbel, was released in March 2011, followed in July by a Saison and in November by a Quadrupel. Sierra Nevada has dedicated a percentage of the beer sales to assist in funding the rebuilding project.|$|E
5|$|Rise Against {{was formed}} in 1999 after the {{dissolution}} of the Chicago punk rock band 88 Fingers Louie. Bassist Joe Principe and guitarist Dan Wleklinski were still <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>making</b> music, and decided to start a new band. The two recruited drummer Toni Tintari, guitarist Kevin White, and lead vocalist Tim McIlrath, the former lead vocalist of the punk band Baxter. They called themselves Transistor Revolt, and released the extended play Transistor Revolt in 2000. Transistor Revolt garnered the attention of Fat Mike, the co-founder of the independent record label Fat Wreck Chords. He signed the band to a recording contract in 2000, with the stipulation that they change their name; the band members ultimately decided on Rise Against.|$|E

5|$|The {{idea for}} The Beginning or the End {{originated}} in October 1945 with actress Donna Reed, and {{her high school}} science teacher, Edward R. Tompkins, a chemist at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. According to The Hollywood Reporter issues of December 1945 and January 1946, MGM, Paramount and 20th Century-Fox were all <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>making</b> a film about the Manhattan Project. Paramount's Hal B. Wallis was already working on his own version, titled Top Secret, but agreed to merge his project with MGM's and hand over his story and research, offering {{to serve as an}} adviser on the MGM treatment in return for a fixed fee and a percentage of the box office gross.|$|E
5|$|Bart and Milhouse {{convince}} Comic Book Guy {{to publish}} a comic book he wrote titled Everyman, in which the title character can absorb superpowers from the characters of comic book he touches. The comic becomes an instant hit, and many Hollywood studios become <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>making</b> it into a movie. Comic Book Guy agrees to let Everyman become a movie, but only if he can pick the star. When Comic Book Guy sees Homer, he considers Homer perfect for the role, as he wants Everyman to be played by a middle-aged fat man. But the studio executives realize that audiences want a physically fit actor for the role, so they hire celebrity fitness trainer Lyle McCarthy to get Homer into shape. After a month, Homer becomes fit and the movie begins production.|$|E
5|$|Nickelodeon Movies {{purchased}} the film {{rights of the}} A Series of Unfortunate Events novel series in May 2000. Paramount Pictures, owner of Nickelodeon Movies, agreed to co-finance, along with Scott Rudin. Various directors, including Terry Gilliam and Roman Polanski, were <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>making</b> the film. One of author Daniel Handler's favorite candidates was Guy Maddin. In June 2002, Barry Sonnenfeld was hired to direct. He was chosen because he previously collaborated with Rudin and because of his black comedy directing style from The Addams Family, Addams Family Values and Get Shorty. Sonnenfeld referred to the Lemony Snicket novels as his favorite children's stories. The director hired Handler to write the script {{with the intention of}} making Lemony Snicket as a musical, and cast Jim Carrey as Count Olaf in September 2002.|$|E

5|$|Steven Soderbergh {{had been}} <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>making</b> {{a film about}} the drug wars for some time but {{did not want to}} make one about addicts. Producer Laura Bickford {{obtained}} the rights to the United Kingdom mini-series Traffik (1989) and liked its structure. Soderbergh, who had seen the mini-series in 1990, started looking for a screenwriter to adapt it into a film. They read a script by Stephen Gaghan called Havoc, about upper-class white kids in Palisades High School doing drugs and getting involved with gangs. Soderbergh approached Gaghan to work on his film, but found he was already working for producer/director Edward Zwick. Bickford and Soderbergh approached Zwick, who agreed to merge the two projects and come aboard as a producer.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} their first to receive public appreciation. Boxleiter first {{understood}} its potential when publishers fought for the bid to the game. At the time, it was solely designed for Flash and not iOS, though they were <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>making</b> bigger games outside the Flash market. They announced the game in mid August 2010, where they revealed that the game would release on Flash (through Kongregate) and iOS simultaneously, which happened on August 29, 2010. Joe Bergeron, a programmer who had previously worked on Dinowaurs with Mikengreg, helped with the iOS version of the game. Solipskier made around $70,000 in its first two months (as compared to $15,000 from the Flash release), which let them work in other non-Flash mediums in the future. They released an Android version three months later.|$|E
5|$|Both Berman and Piller {{sought to}} have Forbes {{sign on to}} portray Ro as a main {{character}} in the series, but she turned them down. She liked making occasional appearances on The Next Generation, but {{did not want to}} tie herself down to a five- to six-year main cast contract at that point in her career. She was also apprehensive about the types of demands fan appearances made on the stars of that series, {{and did not want to}} undertake the level of appearances that would be expected of a main cast member in Deep Space Nine. The producers of Deep Space Nine decided to create a new character to fit a similar mould, which resulted in the creation of Kira Nerys, who was played by Nana Visitor. This was designed to require as minimal a change as possible in the premise of the pilot at that time, which was already under production. During the course of the series, Forbes told interviewers that she was <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>making</b> one-off appearances in the series if she liked the story and role.|$|E

5|$|Professor Bernard Quatermass {{was first}} {{introduced}} to audiences in two BBC television serials, The Quatermass Experiment (1953) and Quatermass II (1955), written by Nigel Kneale. The rights to both these serials were acquired by Hammer Film Productions, and the film adaptations – The Quatermass Xperiment and Quatermass 2, both directed by Val Guest and starring Brian Donlevy as Quatermass – were released in 1955 and 1957 respectively. Kneale went on to write a third Quatermass serial – Quatermass and the Pit – for the BBC, which was broadcast in December 1958 and January 1959. Hammer were once again <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>making</b> a film adaptation, and Kneale, who had by then left the BBC and {{was working as a}} freelance screenwriter, completed a script in 1961. It was intended that Val Guest would once again direct and Brian Donlevy would reprise the role of Quatermass, with production to commence in 1963. However, securing finance for the new Quatermass film proved problematic. In 1957 Hammer had struck a deal with Columbia Pictures to distribute their pictures, and the two companies would go on to collaborate on thirty films between 1957 and 1964. Columbia, who were not interested in Quatermass, passed on the script and production went into limbo for several years. In 1964 Kneale and Anthony Hinds submitted a revised, lower-budget script to Columbia; but by this time the relationship between Hammer and Columbia had begun to sour, and the script was once again rejected. In 1966 Hammer entered into a new distribution deal with Seven Arts, ABPC and Twentieth Century Fox, and Quatermass and the Pit finally entered production.|$|E
