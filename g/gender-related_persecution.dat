40|$|The {{question}} of non-governmental or <b>gender-related</b> <b>persecution</b> has been tackled {{in a very}} narrow sample of asylum cases in Italy, and often in an indirect and unconscious way. Consequently, the Italian report does not answer, if not in a limited manner, for the numberless examples of situations which can amount to non-governmental or <b>gender-related</b> <b>persecution.</b> It is arguable that the main problem arises when the two considered situations - non-governmental persecution and <b>gender-related</b> <b>persecution</b> - overlap, e. g. where women face a real risk of serious harm {{at the hands of}} a non-State actor namely their husband, male relatives, etc. In most of these cases, little room is left for grounding the claim on the Geneva Convention definition of refugee...|$|E
40|$|This Article {{explains}} the particular difficulties that female asylum seekers and survivors of <b>gender-related</b> <b>persecution</b> face, reaffirming {{the need for}} the practical and sensitive application of international and domestic gender guidelines. Extensive research into client files and interviews with key decision makers prove that, despite scholarship suggesting that women may be advantaged in asylum proceedings, a focus on gender is still needed in the South African context. While there are undoubtedly problematic elements of the 1998 Refugees Act warranting its revision, the addition of gender as an additional category under the refugee definition, as proposed by the recent Refugees Amendment Bill, is not a solution to the hardships faced by female asylum seekers and survivors of <b>gender-related</b> <b>persecution</b> navigating the South African system...|$|E
40|$|Since the 1980 s some feminist legal {{scholars}} have challenged the gender-neutral facade of international laws. The Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees (1951) {{has not been}} enforced functionally enough {{in the case of}} women asylum-seekers who need protection from <b>gender-related</b> <b>persecution.</b> In order to correct the male-centered interpretation of the definition of refugee, the immigration authorities of some countries have produced gender guidelines on women refugee claimants. While the production of gender guidelines is commendable, in that they serve to provide protection to more women asylum-seekers suffering <b>gender-related</b> <b>persecution,</b> there are serious concerns about politics of gender guidelines when the political climate around refugees is drastically changing. This study is meant to be a critical and productive examination of the gender guideline at the turn of century, when industrialized countries are constructing fortresses to keep out refugees from developing countries...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{focuses on}} the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada's Guidelines on Women Refugee Claimants Fearing <b>Gender-Related</b> <b>Persecution,</b> {{released}} in 1993. The guidelines were designed to address a perceived shortcoming in international refugee law and its domestic applications, namely, the omission of gender-based persecution from {{the protection of the}} 1951 United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. The omission of gender from the UN Convention had resulted in gender inequalities in the evaluation of asylum claims, inequalities the Canadian guidelines were designed to correct. However, since the inception of the guidelines, critics have dismissed the directives as numerically ineffective, pointing to the low numbers of women requesting asylum on the basis of <b>gender-related</b> <b>persecution.</b> While such a numerical analysis may be useful, the thesis argues it is incomplete. The thesis centres instead on the vital consciousness-raising role played by the guidelines, both domestically and abroad, and on the concrete results engendered by this function in the international realm of women's human rights...|$|E
40|$|Questions {{of gender}} have {{strongly}} influenced {{the development of}} international refugee law {{over the last few}} decades. This volume assesses the progress towards appropriate recognition of <b>gender-related</b> <b>persecution</b> in refugee law. It documents the advances made following intense advocacy around the world in the 1990 s, and evaluates the extent to which gender has been successfully integrated into refugee law. Evaluating the research and advocacy agendas for gender in refugee law ten years beyond the 2002 UNHCR Gender Guidelines, the book investigates the current status of gender in refugee law. It examines <b>gender-related</b> <b>persecution</b> claims of both women and men, including those based on sexual orientation and gender identity, and explores how the development of an anti-refugee agenda in many Western states exponentially increases vulnerability for refugees making gendered claims. The volume includes contributions from scholars and members of the advocacy community that allow the book to examine conceptual and doctrinal themes arising at the intersection of gender and refugee law, and specific case studies across major Western refugee-receiving nations...|$|E
40|$|The gender {{guidelines}} for asylum determination are the legal instrument expected {{to compensate for}} silence concerning <b>gender-related</b> <b>persecution</b> in the Refugee Convention. This paper focuses on Canadian and US decisions concerning gender-related asylum cases {{in order to examine}} the effects and functions of these guidelines. My argument centers on the cases of Muslim women who sought asylum from <b>gender-related</b> <b>persecution,</b> supposedly caused by their 'oppositional' or 'unfavorable' attitudes or opinions towards the code of dressing, conduct or ethics of Muslim societies. By studying the description of these women refugees in asylum decisions, I show how they are defined as 'victims of Islam' and how their image as vicims is then used to convey a negative image of Islam. The case of Nada, an asylum seeker to Canada, is especially striking, because the media portrayal of Nadia's case was effectively controlled by the host country, while the Nadia's own view of Islam was both ignored and denied. Muslim websites and Muslim feminist writers persuasively expose the problematic issues that arise from such cases. This investigation leads me to raise questions about the humanitarian effects and functions of the gender guidelines. Indeed, the guidelines may have a detrimental function by fostering negative stereotypes of Islam...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Women {{claiming}} {{refugee status}} in Canada must demonstrate to the Immigration and Refugee Board [IRB] that their claim is valid and plausible. Canada’s legislative framework acknowledges that <b>gender-related</b> <b>persecution</b> can {{qualify as a}} ground for refugee status under the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees [Refugee Convention]. Specifically, the IRB’s Chairperson’s Guideline 4 – Women Refugee Claimants Fearing <b>Gender-Related</b> <b>Persecution</b> [Gender Guidelines] assist IRB decision-makers in deciding gender-related refugee claims by offering options for procedural accommodation and analytical guidance in the evaluation of gender-related claims. The Gender Guidelines aim to ensure decision-makers have “the degree of knowledge, understanding, and sensitivity” needed to make a “fair and correct judgment” of gender-related claims (Griffith v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [1999] FCJ No 1142 (QL)). The purpose of this research is to critically examine the use of the Gender Guidelines in IRB decisions on gender-related refugee claims and Federal Court judicial reviews of those claims. Looking at 166 Federal Court of Canada judicial reviews of gender-related claims of persecution previously rejected at the IRB level from 2003 to 2013, I used a grounded theory methodological basis and content analysis approach informed by Michel Foucault’s insights on power relationships and Judith Butler’s insights on performativity to examine discursive deployment of gender in refugee determinations through the treatment of the Gender Guidelines. I examined four legal standards used in these judicial reviews of gender-related claim determination—credibility assessments, plausibility assessments, availability of state protection, and the availability of an internal flight alternative [IFA]. I analyzed the application of these standards and looked at how variables such as country of origin or type of persecution or extrajudicial factors such as Canadian political discourse and rigid understandings of gender identity result in inconsistent application of the Gender Guidelines, thereby violating women refugee claimants’ right to procedural fairness. Several recommendations are made for changes at both the IRB and Federal Court level to correct identified barriers and to ensure all claims related to <b>gender-related</b> <b>persecution</b> have a full and fair opportunity to provide evidence and have it considered on its merits...|$|E
40|$|The Geneva Convention {{regarding}} the Status of Refugees (1951) protects whoever {{can be considered}} a refugee internationally. Even though there is little doubt trafficked persons suffer harm on account of this criminal business, the applicability of the Convention in these cases is problematic since persons at risk cannot easily fulfil the criteria set up in Art. 1 A(2) of the Refugee Convention. Challenges are faced both in relation to the concept of persecution and in linking the harm to a Convention ground. Development in the field of gender-specific and <b>gender-related</b> <b>persecution</b> has however provided for limited opportunities to claim refugee status when fearing trafficking, which can be seen in case law and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees Guidelines on the Application of the refugee Convention to People who have been Trafficked. However, it may sometimes prove more fruitful to claim complementary protection under the European Union Refugee Qualification Directive or Art. 3 European Convention of Human Rights...|$|E
40|$|Forms {{of oppression}} {{affecting}} specific social {{groups such as}} women and people with disabilities are demanding international address and rights protection for those deemed persecuted and oppressed. In 1951, the United Nations developed the Refugee Convention, which has remained largely unchanged since its inception and has neglected to incorporate protection of newly recognized social groups. Recently, Canadian immigration and refugee laws have begun to develop legislation to address these issues, specifically in regards to <b>gender-related</b> <b>persecution.</b> By examining Canadian federal amendments to refugee and immigration law and United Nations documents developed by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, this paper will argue that an amendment protecting persons facing disability-related oppression {{is in keeping with}} current Canadian values and means. Supportive documents emphasize the legal benefits of people with disabilities identifying as members of a unique social group that would then require the recognition of the widespread international incidence of disability-specific oppression and persecution. Implementation of a disability-related amendment to the 1951 Refugee Convention would not only create asylum opportunities for those fleeing regimes that practise or propagate disability persecution and oppression, but would create further awareness of the international community's intolerance of such practices...|$|E
40|$|While {{claims of}} forced {{marriage}} or pressure to marry represent {{only a tiny}} portion of refugee claims overall, they provide an illuminating sliver reflecting the major recurring themes in gender and sexuality claims from recent decades. Refusal to marry is a flashpoint for expressing non-conformity with expected gender roles for heterosexual women, lesbians and gay men. This paper presents results from our study of 168 refugee decisions from Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States where part of the claim for refugee protection concerned actual or threatened forced marriage. In the present discussion, we highlight our findings from the cases from the United States while detailed findings regarding the broader international data set are published elsewhere. We find that the United States is far behind Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom in terms of analyzing <b>gender-related</b> <b>persecution.</b> In addition to not finding a single case with a straightforward holding that forced marriage {{in and of itself}} could constitute persecution, we also did not find any engagement with international human rights standards. Of the few cases that were successful on a substantive basis, we found that the underlying facts reflect an extreme exoticization of the women involved...|$|E
40|$|A gender {{revolution}} {{has transformed the}} institution of asylum in the United States. The introduction of gender-based persecution laws and policies {{in the past decade}} ushered in a new era of politics in asylum decisions. Facilitated by recent laws and policies, immigrant women may gain asylum and legal entry into the U. S. by claiming they are persecuted based on factors such as female circumcision, honor killings, domestic violence, coercive family planning, forced marriage, or repressive social norms. Immigrant advocates have championed these laws and policies as reflecting the canonical feminist declaration that women's rights are human rights. The legal recognition that certain human rights abuses are gendered because they overwhelmingly happen to women has emerged as the benchmark for gendered equality in asylum adjudication. However, legal recognition of <b>gender-related</b> <b>persecution</b> is only half the story. A study of the implementation of gender-based persecution laws and policies makes visible certain assumptions about femininity, masculinity, sexuality, race, class, and nation in which asylum seekers, immigration attorneys, service providers, immigration judges, and asylum officers engage when making, preparing, and adjudicating asylum claims. In this dissertation, I offer empirical evidence of how gender structures the legal institution of asylum in the United States...|$|E
40|$|Session: Gender and Violence across National BordersThis paper {{considers}} {{the relevance of}} international human rights law {{as a framework for}} ensuring greater protection for women refugees in Asia, especially in states not bound by the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees or its 1967 Protocol (Refugee Convention) (the main instruments that comprise the international refugee protection framework). Most Asian states have not acceded to these instruments and as a result some commentators have lamented the lack of relevant legal standards in a region that hosts approximately one third of the world’s refugees. Although express refugee norms may not apply, all Asian states have ratified {{at least two of the}} core international human rights treaties including the Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW). CEDAW elaborates the nature of state obligations to eliminate discrimination against women, a concept that includes gender-based violence. Of particular importance for efforts to secure better refugee protection in the region, this paper examines whether CEDAW contains an implicit duty on state parties not to return (refoule) individual women to places where they risk facing <b>gender-related</b> <b>persecution.</b> In the absence of explicit refugee protection obligations, recognition of such a duty would strengthen CEDAW’s capacity as a legal and advocacy tool to protect women refugees. At the same time, the paper identifies possible gaps in any protection regime based solely on international human rights standards and reflects on the continuing value and relevance of the Refugee Convention...|$|E
40|$|Despite often making `conventional claims’ {{for asylum}} {{based on their}} {{political}} opinion, race, nationality or religion, many women also claim asylum in the United Kingdom (UK) {{on the basis that}} they fear persecution because of their gender. To be recognised as refugees, women asylum seekers must therefore often demonstrate that they fear persecution on account of their membership of a Particular Social Group (PSG). In the UK, the Refugee Convention ground of PSG is the most litigated, and women asylum seekers may face many obstacles to benefitting from the protection they require. This paper explores the development of the interpretation of the PSG ground in the context of gender-related claims for asylum and assesses its implication for the protection of women who fear <b>gender-related</b> <b>persecution.</b> In particular, it sets out a critical analysis of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal’s determination in SB (Moldova) 1 in light of the House of Lords’ decision in Fornah. 2 The paper demonstrates the Tribunal’s failure to follow the decision of the majority in Fornah that the two limbs of article 10 (1) (d) Qualification Directive, setting out the definition of a PSG, are alternatives and not cumulative and why this determination is flawed. The paper also concludes that the Tribunal has developed a more rigorous test for the definition of PSG where the group is gender-based despite the absence of domestic and international jurisprudence and rules of interpretation that would support this approach. The analysis highlights the discriminatory approach by the Tribunal and demonstrates that this approach cannot stand...|$|E
40|$|Canada's 1993 refugee policy Guidelines for Women Refugees Fearing <b>Gender-Related</b> <b>Persecution</b> reinterpret the 1951 UN Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees to radically expand state-responsibilities for women's human rights. The {{evolution}} of this novel inter-state responsibility departed from established models of policy-making in some important respects. This study explores how asylum seekers challenged Canada to align domestic policies on {{violence against women}} with humanitarian responsibilities in refugee policy, shaping their own eligibility criteria and rights to state protection. These stateless persons and foreign nationals drew upon both human rights and Canadian citizenship rights {{in order to make}} claims upon the state and influence policy. Their influence has implications not only for women's rights to inter-state protection, but for non-citizen participation in policy-making. The participation of non-citizens in policy-making has been neglected in academic social policy. Here their role in policy-advocacy networks is explored through an analytic framework that draws on migration system theory and collective action theories. This illuminates the inter-state structural context, interactions between grassroots actors and government, and the interplay of national and supranational identity and rights issues. The study then identifies the structural context and key political opportunities that opened up for women seeking asylum and challenging refugee policy. Case studies are analysed to describe how emerging opportunities were used by the particular asylum seekers and their core network of supporters between 1991 and 1997, and to what effect. Insight is provided into: how refugee policy-making involves asylum seekers whose roles are expanding in complicated and dynamic relationships with receiving-states; why a new international migration flow based on age-old structural persecution emerged {{in the late twentieth century}} and who these asylum seekers really are; the ways they influenced policy; and the extent and implications of their influence, for policy and policy-making. The thesis suggests that academic social policy may need to rethink nationally bound policy and policy-change frameworks and their traditional basis in citizenship, which globalisation is calling into question. It suggests that citizenship and human rights discourses and state-responsibilities are merging through the influence of stateless persons and foreign- nationals who make expressly political use of new policy advocacy opportunities, both institutional and extra-institutional, and through transnational identity and rights issues of which feminism is a strong example. It indicates that Canada's policy guidelines are not the end of the road - refugee policy needs to move in a direction that recognises both 'gender- related' and 'sex' persecution at the heart of asylum seekers' claims...|$|E
