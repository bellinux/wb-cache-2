5000|$|The {{relationship}} between {{sex differences in}} the brain and human behavior is a subject of controversy in psychology and society at large. Many females tend to have a higher ratio of gray matter in the left hemisphere of the brain in comparison to males. Males on average have larger brains than females, however when adjusted for total brain volume the gray matter differences between sexes is almost nonexistent. Thus, the percentage of gray matter appears to be more related to brain size than it is to sex. Differences in brain physiology between sexes do not necessarily relate to differences in intellect. Haier et al. found in a 2004 study that [...] "men and women apparently achieve similar IQ results with different brain regions, suggesting that there is no singular underlying neuroanatomical structure to general intelligence and that different types of brain designs may manifest equivalent intellectual performance". (See the sex and intelligence article for more on this subject.) Strict graph-theoretical analysis of the human brain connections revealed [...] that in numerous graph-theoretical parameters (e.g., minimum bipartition width, <b>edge</b> <b>number,</b> the expander graph property, minimum vertex cover), the structural connectome of women are significantly [...] "better" [...] connected than the connectome of men. It was shown that the graph-theoretical differences are due to the sex and not to the differences in the cerebral volume, by analyzing the data of 36 females and 36 males, where the brain volume of each man in the group was smaller than the brain volume of each woman in the group.|$|E

ABSTRACT: An edge {{geodetic}} set of a {{connected graph}} G of order p ≥ 2 {{is a set}} [formula] such that every edge of G is contained in a geodesic joining some pair of vertices in S. The <b>edge</b> geodetic <b>number</b> g 1 (G) of G is the minimum cardinality of its edge geodetic sets and any edge geodetic set of cardinality g 1 (G) is a minimum edge geodetic set of G or an edge geodetic basis of G. An edge geodetic set S in a connected graph G is a minimal edge geodetic set if no proper subset of S is an edge geodetic set of G. The upper <b>edge</b> geodetic <b>number</b> g 1 +(G) of G is the maximum cardinality of a minimal edge geodetic set of G. The upper <b>edge</b> geodetic <b>number</b> of certain classes of graphs are determined. It is shown that for every two integers a and b such that 2 ≤ a ≤ b, there exists a connected graph G with g 1 (G) = a and g 1 +(G) = b. For an edge geodetic basis S of G, a subset [formula] is called a forcing subset for S if S is the unique edge geodetic basis containing T. A forcing subset for S of minimum cardinality is a minimum forcing subset of S. The forcing <b>edge</b> geodetic <b>number</b> of S denoted by ƒ 1 (S), is the cardinality of a minimum forcing subset of S. The forcing <b>edge</b> geodetic <b>number</b> of G, denoted by ƒ 1 (G), is ƒ 1 (G) = min{ ƒ 1 (S) }, where the minimum is taken over all edge geodetic bases S in G. Some general properties satisfied by this concept are studied. The forcing <b>edge</b> geodetic <b>number</b> of certain classes of graphs are determined. It is shown that for every pair a, b of integers with 0 ≤ a b and b ≥ 2, there exists a connected graph G such thatƒ 1 (G) = a and g 1 (G) = b.
