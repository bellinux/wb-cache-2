5|$|Hamilton was {{the colonel}} of the 15th Regiment of Foot from 22 August 1792 to 1794, {{during which he}} {{took part in the}} 1790s West Indies Campaign. The 15th <b>Foot</b> <b>was</b> awarded the battle honour Martinique 1794 (5 February – 25 March). During the battle, the 15th <b>Foot</b> <b>was</b> a part of the First Brigade, which {{consisted}} of the 39th and 43rd Regiment of Foot and was led by Sir C. Gordon.|$|E
5|$|The Clevelands {{had five}} children: Ruth (1891–1904), Esther (1893–1980), Marion (1895–1977), Richard (1897–1974), and Francis Grover (1903–1995). British philosopher Philippa <b>Foot</b> <b>was</b> their granddaughter.|$|E
5|$|The North Staffordshire Regiment (Prince of Wales's) {{was a line}} {{infantry}} regiment of the British Army, {{which was}} in existence between 1881 and 1959. The 64th (2nd Staffordshire) Regiment of <b>Foot</b> <b>was</b> created on 21 April 1758 from the 2nd Battalion of the 11th Regiment of Foot. In 1881, under the Childers Reforms, the 64th Regiment of <b>Foot</b> <b>was</b> merged with the 98th (Prince of Wales's) Regiment of Foot (originally raised in 1824) to form the Prince of Wales's (North Staffordshire Regiment). In 1921 the regimental title was altered to the North Staffordshire Regiment (Prince of Wales's).|$|E

5000|$|The <b>foot</b> <b>is</b> usually dislocated medially (80%) and superiorly, {{which occurs}} when the <b>foot</b> <b>is</b> plantar flexed and inverted.|$|R
5|$|Appealing to {{a diverse}} {{audience}} {{was a key}} factor in the show's writing. The character of Frieda the <b>foot</b> <b>was</b> introduced specifically to highlight acceptance among children. Positive critical reception for the racially diverse cast of characters led to several episodes centered on the topic of tolerance.|$|E
5|$|During summer 1797, Coleridge {{spent time}} with many of his friends, {{including}} John Thelwall, William and Dorothy Wordsworth, Charles Lamb, Thomas Poole, and his wife Sara Fricker. During this time, he suffered an accident in which his <b>foot</b> <b>was</b> burned. As a result, he was left alone at Poole's property underneath a lime tree, while Lamb, the Wordsworths and his wife went on a journey across the Quantocks.|$|E
5|$|In 1945, Plymouth-born Michael <b>Foot</b> <b>was</b> elected Labour MP for the war-torn {{constituency}} of Plymouth Devonport {{and after}} serving as Secretary of State for Education and responsible for the 1974 Health and Safety at Work Act, {{went on to become}} one of the most distinguished leaders of the Labour party.|$|E
5000|$|In this example, {{the first}} and second <b>feet</b> <b>are</b> dactyls; their first syllables, [...] "Ar" [...] and [...] "rum" [...] respectively, contain short vowels, but count as long because the vowels are both {{followed}} by two consonants. The third and fourth <b>feet</b> <b>are</b> spondees, the first of which is divided by the main caesura of the verse. The fifth <b>foot</b> <b>is</b> a dactyl, as is nearly always the case. The final <b>foot</b> <b>is</b> a spondee.|$|R
50|$|One <b>foot</b> <b>is</b> {{placed in}} front of the other so that the heel of the front <b>foot</b> <b>is</b> near the arch.|$|R
50|$|Most {{flexible}} flat <b>feet</b> <b>are</b> asymptomatic, and do {{not cause}} pain. In these cases, there is usually no cause for concern. Flat <b>feet</b> <b>were</b> formerly a physical-health reason for service-rejection in many militaries. However, three military studies on asymptomatic adults (see section below), suggest that persons with asymptomatic flat <b>feet</b> <b>are</b> at least as tolerant of foot stress as the population with various grades of arch. Asymptomatic flat <b>feet</b> <b>are</b> no longer a service disqualification in the U.S. military.|$|R
5|$|In {{the land}} {{adjacent}} to Carthy's Castle is Orlagh House {{which has been}} owned by the Augustinian Order since the mid-nineteenth century and is a retreat and conference centre run by the friars. It was built in 1790 by Mr Lundy Foot, a wealthy snuff merchant, who named the house Footmount. He was also a magistrate and was instrumental in condemning {{three members of the}} Kearney family to death for the murder of John Kinlan, the gamekeeper at Friarstown, near Bohernabreena, in 1816. <b>Foot</b> <b>was</b> subsequently murdered in 1835, an act that was attributed to relatives of the Kearneys. In fact, <b>Foot</b> <b>was</b> killed by James Murphy, the son of an evicted tenant farmer whose land Foot had bought following the eviction.|$|E
5|$|In {{the period}} {{directly}} after Napoleon's surrender after Waterloo (18 June 1815), the town's own 53rd (Shropshire) Regiment of <b>Foot</b> <b>was</b> sent to guard {{him in his}} exile on St Helena. A locket containing a lock of the emperor's hair (presented to {{an officer of the}} 53rd) remains to this day in the collections of the Shropshire Regimental Museum at Shrewsbury Castle.|$|E
5|$|MacGregor {{joined the}} British Army at 16, the {{youngest}} age {{it was possible}} for him to do so, in April 1803. His family purchased him a commission as an ensign in the 57th (West Middlesex) Regiment of Foot, probably for around £450. MacGregor's entrance to the military coincided with the start of the Napoleonic Wars following the breakdown of the Treaty of Amiens. Southern England was fortified to defend against a possible French invasion; the 57th <b>Foot</b> <b>was</b> at Ashford, Kent. In February 1804, after less than a year in training, MacGregor was promoted without purchase to lieutenant—an advancement that usually took up to three years. Later that year, after MacGregor had spent some months in Guernsey with the regiment's 1st Battalion, the 57th <b>Foot</b> <b>was</b> posted to Gibraltar.|$|E
5000|$|In the Philippines, chicken <b>feet</b> <b>are</b> {{marinated in}} a mixture of calamansi, spices and brown sugar before being grilled.

5000|$|There are {{two types}} of fourth position: open and closed. In both cases, one <b>foot</b> <b>is</b> placed {{approximately}} twelve inches in front of the other. In open fourth position the heels are aligned, while in closed fourth position the heel of the front <b>foot</b> <b>is</b> aligned with the toe of the back <b>foot.</b> There <b>are</b> two variations of each type of fourth position, determined by which <b>foot</b> <b>is</b> in front.|$|R
50|$|Additionally, many prosodists divide a {{line into}} feet—the minimal {{repeated}} units—using the pipe symbol (|). When <b>feet</b> <b>are</b> thus designated, words that span <b>feet</b> <b>are</b> divided without hyphens, and any punctuation that occurs at a <b>foot</b> break <b>is</b> typically omitted.|$|R
5|$|California Chrome {{returned}} to Los Alamitos, where Sherman's crew treated the wound for about 10 days. After that, they sent California Chrome to Harris Farms {{where he was}} turned out on pasture. By early July, his <b>foot</b> <b>was</b> fully healed, he had gained weight, and Sherman was pleased enough with his recovery that he brought the colt back to Los Alamitos to resume training on July 17, two weeks earlier than anticipated.|$|E
5|$|In 1893 Nansen {{had driven}} his ship Fram into the Arctic pack ice off the {{northern}} Siberian coast and {{allowed it to}} drift in the ice towards Greenland, hoping that this route would cross the North Pole. In the event, the drift did not approach the pole, and an attempt by Nansen and Hjalmar Johansen to reach it on <b>foot</b> <b>was</b> likewise unsuccessful. Nevertheless, Nansen's strategy became the basis of Amundsen's own Arctic plans. He reasoned that if he entered the Arctic Ocean via the Bering Strait, well {{to the east of}} Nansen's starting point, his ship would achieve a more northerly drift and pass near or through the pole.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} {{to the opening of}} the American branch, various trade arrangements were made with other film companies, including American Mutoscope and Biograph, the Warwick Trading Company, the Charles Urban Trading Co., Robert W. Paul's studio, and Gaumont. In these negotiations, a print sale price of 0.15 per <b>foot</b> <b>was</b> standardized across the American market, which proved useful to Méliès. However, later price standardizations by the Motion Picture Patents Company in 1908 hastened Méliès's financial ruin, as his films were impractically expensive under the new standards. In addition, in the years following 1908 his films suffered from the fashions of the time, as the fanciful magic films he made were no longer in vogue.|$|E
25|$|The girl's broken feet {{required}} {{a great deal}} of care and attention, and they would be unbound regularly. Each time the <b>feet</b> <b>were</b> unbound, they were washed, the toes carefully checked for injury, and the nails carefully and meticulously trimmed. When unbound, the broken <b>feet</b> <b>were</b> also kneaded to soften them and the soles of the girl's <b>feet</b> <b>were</b> often beaten to make the joints and broken bones more flexible. The <b>feet</b> <b>were</b> also soaked in a concoction that caused any necrotic flesh to fall off.|$|R
5000|$|If both <b>feet</b> <b>are</b> off {{the floor}} and the player lands on both feet simultaneously, the moment one <b>foot</b> <b>is</b> lifted, the other foot becomes the pivot foot.|$|R
5000|$|A Russian pivot turn, as {{described}} by Bessie and May Evans, is performed as follows. The right <b>foot</b> <b>is</b> placed flat and the left <b>foot</b> <b>is</b> placed with the toe by the right heel and the left heel raised and this relative position basically maintained during the turning. The turn starts with the right foot raised from the floor. While continuously revolving, on each strong beat (downbeat) the right <b>foot</b> <b>is</b> stepped flat and on each weak beat (upbeat) the left <b>foot</b> <b>is</b> stepped on the ball (by the right heel).|$|R
5|$|In the mid-1990s, Bradbury accidentally hit his leg while {{chopping}} firewood. Gangrene set in, and {{his right}} leg was amputated below the knee. It spread to his left leg, and part of his left <b>foot</b> <b>was</b> amputated, leaving him in a wheelchair. The disease eventually proved fatal, and he died on 20 August 1997. He was {{survived by his wife}} Lois, who died in January 1998, and his three sons. A funeral service was held in Los Alamos, and he was buried at Guaje Pines Cemetery in Los Alamos.|$|E
5|$|James Livingston had {{advanced}} to Montgomery {{the idea of}} taking Fort Chambly, near where his militia was encamped. One of Livingston's captains, Jeremy Duggan, had, on September 13, floated two nine-pound guns past St. Jean, and these guns were put to use to that end. Chambly, which was garrisoned by only 82 men, mostly from the 7th <b>Foot,</b> <b>was</b> surrendered on October 18 by its commander, Major Joseph Stopford, after two days of bombardment. Most seriously, Stopford failed to destroy supplies that were vitally useful to the Americans, primarily gunpowder, but also winter provisions. Six tons of powder, 6,500 musket cartridges, 125 muskets, 80 barrels of flour and 272 barrels of foodstuff were captured.|$|E
5|$|John Cena and The Great Khali also {{continued}} to feud over the WWE Championship. Following the controversial ending to their match at Judgment Day, where Cena forced Khali to submit while his <b>foot</b> <b>was</b> underneath the bottom rope, meaning Cena should have released the hold, Khali challenged Cena to a Falls Count Anywhere match for One Night Stand. Cena accepted, and Khali attacked him, performing a Chokebomb. At One Night Stand, Cena retained his title by pinning Khali after performing an FU off a crane.|$|E
50|$|What is the due of a {{king who}} is always in {{residence}} {{at the head of}} his tuath? Seven score feet of perfect <b>feet</b> <b>are</b> the measure of his stockade on every side. Seven <b>feet</b> <b>are</b> the thickness of its earthwork, and twelve feet its depth. It is then that he is a king, when ramparts of vassalage surround him. What is the rampart of vassalage? Twelve <b>feet</b> <b>are</b> the breadth of its opening and its depth and its measure towards the stockade. Thirty <b>feet</b> <b>are</b> its measure outwardly.|$|R

5|$|Next was {{the main}} event, which saw John Cena defend the WWE Championship against The Great Khali. Khali {{attacked}} Cena early in the match, but Cena countered and gained the advantage. Cena performed a diving legdrop bulldog and followed by putting Khali in the STFU. Cena forced Khali {{to submit to the}} hold, but Khali's <b>foot</b> <b>was</b> under the rope, meaning Cena should have broken the hold. The referee, however, did not see this and declared Cena the winner. Cena retained the WWE Championship and gained possession of the belt, which Khali had kayfabe stolen prior to the event.|$|E
5|$|Teller left Hungary in 1926, {{partly due}} to the discriminatory numerus clausus rule under Miklós Horthy's regime. The {{political}} climate and revolutions in Hungary during his youth instilled a lingering animosity for both Communism and Fascism in Teller. When he was a young student, his right <b>foot</b> <b>was</b> severed in a streetcar accident in Munich, requiring him to wear a prosthetic foot, and leaving him with a lifelong limp. Werner Heisenberg said that it was the hardiness of Teller's spirit, rather than stoicism, that allowed him to cope so well with the accident.|$|E
5|$|The 64th Regiment of <b>Foot</b> <b>was</b> {{originally}} {{raised in}} 1756 as the 2nd Battalion of the 11th (Devonshire) Foot, and was renumbered the 64th in 1758. It {{had a long}} history of overseas service with much less time spent in Europe. It had served in the West Indies during the Seven Years' War, America during the American War of Independence, South America, the West Indies and Canada during the Napoleonic Wars. Subsequent long periods were spent in Ireland and the West Indies before action was seen in India during the Indian Mutiny. At the time of the forming of the amalgamation with the 98th Foot, the 64th was based in Ireland.|$|E
