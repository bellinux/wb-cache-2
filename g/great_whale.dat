5|$|Predation by orcas on whale calves in high productivity, high {{latitude}} areas {{has been}} hypothesised {{to be the}} reason for <b>great</b> <b>whale</b> migrations to low productivity tropical waters, {{to reduce the risk}} of attacks on the highly vulnerable calves due to lower density of orcas in these waters.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the advent}} of {{industrial}} whaling, great whales {{may have been the}} major food source for killer whales. The introduction of modern whaling techniques may have aided killer whales by the sound of exploding harpoons indicating availability of prey to scavenge, and compressed air inflation of whale carcasses causing them to float, thus exposing them to scavenging. However, the toll on <b>great</b> <b>whale</b> populations by unfettered whaling had possibly reduced their availability as prey for killer whales, and caused them to expand their consumption of smaller marine mammals, thus contributing to their decline as well.|$|E

25|$|Hydro-Québec and the Bourassa {{government}} {{had a much}} harder time circumventing the next hurdle in northern Quebec. Robert Bourassa was re-elected in late 1985 after a 9-year hiatus. Shortly after taking office he announced yet another hydro development in the James Bay area. The C$12.6 billion <b>Great</b> <b>Whale</b> Project involved the construction of three new generating stations with a combined capacity of 3,160 megawatts. It was to produce 16.3 terawatt-hours of energy each year {{by the time it}} was completed in 1998–1999.|$|E
25|$|The Crees {{succeeded in}} getting the Canadian federal {{government}} to establish a parallel environmental assessment process in order to delay construction.

Launched {{in the months following}} the failure of the Meech Lake Accord and the Oka Crisis, the campaign prompted a coalition of Quebec-based environmental groups to dissociate themselves from the Cree campaign.|$|E

25|$|The {{moratorium}} on new hydro projects in northern Quebec after the <b>Great</b> <b>Whale</b> cancellation forced the company's management {{to develop new}} sources of electricity to meet increasing demand. In September 2001, Hydro-Québec announced its intention {{to build a new}} combined cycle gas turbine plant—the Centrale du Suroît plant—in Beauharnois, southwest of Montreal, stressing the pressing need to secure additional electricity supply to mitigate against any shortfall in the water cycle of its reservoirs. Hydro's rationale also stressed the cost-effectiveness of the plant {{and the fact that it}} could be built within a two-year period.|$|E
25|$|The European arrival tremendously {{damaged the}} Inuit way of life, causing mass death through new {{diseases}} introduced by whalers and explorers, and enormous social disruptions {{caused by the}} distorting effect of Europeans' material wealth. Nonetheless, Inuit society in the higher latitudes had largely remained in isolation during the 19th century. The Hudson's Bay Company opened trading posts such as <b>Great</b> <b>Whale</b> River (1820), today {{the site of the}} twin villages of Whapmagoostui and Kuujjuarapik, where whale products of the commercial whale hunt were processed and furs traded. The British Naval Expedition of 1821–3 led by Admiral William Edward Parry, which twice over-wintered in Foxe Basin, provided the first informed, sympathetic and well-documented account of the economic, social and religious life of the Inuit. Parry stayed in what is now Igloolik over the second winter. Parry's writings, with pen and ink illustrations of Inuit everyday life, and those of George Francis Lyon, both published in 1824 were widely read. Captain George Comer's Inuit wife Shoofly, known for her sewing skills and elegant attire, was influential in convincing him to acquire more sewing accessories and beads for trade with Inuit.|$|E

Featuring large photo emulsion works on canvas, constructions, large scale paper works, and ceramics. [...] "Compared to earlier work, The Whale of Our Being exhibits a positively baroque complexity, a dizzying assortment of references, sometimes printed in overly saturated, fluorescent colour.

The colour in Summa ranges from Day-Glo yellow-green to orange; the images from Einstein and the Hubble Telescope, and astronaut, and Sitting Bull to and image of the First Nations, and more besides." [...] His imagery had become vast and all inclusive, in The Whale of Our Being [...] "He re-examines the media construction of violence and infamy and the public fascination with celebrity".
