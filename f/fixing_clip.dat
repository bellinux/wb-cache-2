40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{complete}} model handling physical simulation of deformable 1 D objects. We formulate continuous expressions for stretching, bending and twisting energies. These expressions are mechanically rigorous and geometrically exact. Both elastic and plastic deformations are handled to simulate {{a wide range}} of materials. We validate the proposed model on several classical test configurations. The use of geometrical exact energies with dynamic splines provides very accurate results as well as interactive simulation time, which shows the suitability of the proposed model for constrained CAD applications. We illustrate the application potential of the proposed model by describing a virtual system for cable positioning, {{that can be used to}} test compatibility between planned <b>fixing</b> <b>clip</b> positions, and mechanical cable properties...|$|E

40|$|Abstract-Suboptimal {{detection}} schemes, such as list MIMO detection, often {{face the}} challenge of having to "guess " at the decision reliability for some of the detected bits. A simple yet effective way of doing this is to set the maximum magnitudes of the associated log-likelihood-ratios (LLRs) to a certain predefined value: LLR clipping. However, the choice of the clipping level has {{a significant impact on the}} system performance. A majority of prior approaches attempted to determine appropriate clipping levels by manual optimization. In this work we propose to use an SNR-aware approach for calculating the LLR clipping levels in list MIMO detection. The proposed scheme exploits knowledge of the channel state information to determine the instantaneous bit error probability ofthe list detector, and from this an appropriate level for clipping of the LLRs. Simulation results show that this strategy outperforms schemes using a <b>fixed</b> <b>clipping</b> level. I...|$|R

50|$|Hero motors has {{unveiled}} a new sharper, more busy-looking Karizma and ZMR models. A completely redesigned front fairing features twin stacked headlamps that are nestled between the integrated turn indicators. The indicators are also surrounded by LED daytime running lamps. The Karizma R 2014 {{has undergone a}} rather thorough cosmetic overhaul. The fairing on the Karizma is basically a low key version of the new ZMR fairing. Other changes to the fairing include mounted ORVMs, “R Premium Sports” decals and a twin headlamp arrangement. Similarities with previous versions include- the suspension and wheels, fuel tank and a drum brake in the rear. Through the styling too, {{emphasis is on the}} raw power of the bike.The rear end of the motorcycle has also received a much-needed visual weight reduction with a new split seat design and tapering tail section. The brake light and rear turn indicators are now housed in a neat floating tail section that also houses the number plate. The bike now features a set of <b>fixed</b> <b>clip</b> on style bars similar to the outgoing ZMR model and both bikes will ride on wider tyres than the older model.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this project}} is to remove the motion related {{artifacts}} of the current watermarking algorithm, known as the `dirty window problem'. It was observed {{that part of the}} dirty window problem originated from watermark artifacts in still images. Therefore, two possible improvements of the current algorithm are suggested that will lower the visibility of the watermark in still images: adjusting the global depth settings of the four directional watermark patterns, and changing the <b>fixed</b> <b>clipping</b> threshold to a clipping threshold that depends on the luminance value of a pixel. The following model for a motion sensitive watermarking algorithm is proposed, and has subsequently been implemented: 1. use the current algorithm to calculate a watermark for a frame; 2. select areas in the frame that might expose the watermark when they are in motion; 3. estimate the motion in the frame; 4. lower the local strength of the watermark in selected areas that are in motion. In step 2, areas are selected based on the output of the directional filters. In step 3, the Y-prediction block-matcher is used to extract motion information from a video sequence. Finally, a number of improved watermarking algorithms were evaluated in a visibility test, and the robustness of the algorithms to MPEG- 2 compression was determined...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} four novel {{techniques for}} peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) reduction in filter bank multicarrier (FBMC) modulation systems. The approach extends on current PAPR reduction active constellation extension (ACE) methods, {{as used in}} orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), to an FBMC implementation as the main contribution. The four techniques introduced can be split up into two: linear programming optimization ACE-based techniques and smart gradient-project (SGP) ACE techniques. The linear programming (LP) -based techniques compensate for the symbol overlaps by utilizing a frame-based approach and provide a theoretical upper bound on achievable performance for the overlapping ACE techniques. The overlapping ACE techniques {{on the other hand}} can handle symbol by symbol processing. Furthermore, as a result of FBMC properties, the proposed techniques do not require side information transmission. The PAPR performance of the techniques is shown to match, or in some cases improve, on current PAPR techniques for FBMC. Initial analysis of the computational complexity of the SGP techniques indicates that the complexity issues with PAPR reduction in FBMC implementations can be addressed. The out-of-band interference introduced by the techniques is investigated. As a result, it is shown that the interference can be compensated for, whilst still maintaining decent PAPR performance. Additional results are also provided by means of a study of the PAPR reduction of the proposed techniques at a <b>fixed</b> <b>clipping</b> probability. The bit error rate (BER) degradation is investigated to ensure that the trade-off in terms of BER degradation is not too severe. As illustrated by exhaustive simulations, the SGP ACE-based technique proposed are ideal candidates for practical implementation in systems employing the low-complexity polyphase implementation of FBMC modulators. The methods are shown to offer significant PAPR reduction and increase the feasibility of FBMC as a replacement modulation system for OFDM. [URL]...|$|R

The presented scheme combines two well-known techniques, namely selected mapping (SLM) and clipping, in an adaptive way. Allowing an affordable PAPR, which might be exceeded with very small probability, the proposed method aims at minimizing the instantaneous number of clipped peaks per OFDM frame to limit the resulting transmit signal distortion. Using Compressed Sensing based algorithms which account for the potential variation {{of the number of}} clips per frame, this clipping strategy directly translates into an improved receiver-side peak reconstruction compared to choosing a <b>fixed</b> number of <b>clipped</b> peaks.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Surgical {{treatment}} of "Ren Mobilis" {{has historically been}} associated with poor results and fairly high morbidity. We have used a transperitoneal laparoscopic approach {{in order to minimize}} morbidity. The goal {{of this study was to}} evaluate the success rate and to discuss the possible pathogenic mechanism, which has implications for the surgical strategy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seven women with a right mobile kidney were examined by intravenous pyelogram and CT scans. Symptoms were judged to emanate from the mobile kidney. Transperitoneal laparoscopic nephropexy was performed. The surgical treatment consisted of fixing the kidney to the dorsal abdominal wall using tissue glue (Tisseel) after diathermy coagulation of the surfaces to induce fibrosis. The right colon was <b>fixed</b> with <b>clips</b> to the lateral abdominal wall, trapping the kidney in place. RESULTS: In 6 of the cases, there was an incomplete rotation of the ascending colon to the right side, allowing the kidney to move freely. In one case, the kidney moved into a retroperitoneal pocket of the mesocolon. The 6 cases with a lateral passage for the kidney were symptom-free at follow-up (30 - 80 months), but in the 7 th case the patient's kidney quickly loosened and she underwent an open reoperation, after which she was symptom-free. CONCLUSION: Our series demonstrates that good results can be achieved with a transperitoneal laparoscopic approach, but also indicates that there is a common pathogenic mechanism with incomplete rotation of the ascending colon that can be corrected during surgery, which might contribute to the good results...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{a new technique}} for urethrovesical anastomosis that consists of placing three "U" stitches of Monocryl 2 - 0 to connect the bladder neck and urethral stump together. The margins are united by a double passage of the suture, without tying any knots. The sutures are tied on the bladder's surface using Lapra-Ty <b>clips</b> <b>fixed</b> at a certain distance from where to two mucosal margins have been joined. We carried out this technique on 90 patients who underwent laparoscopic extraperitoneal radical prostatectomy. The good joining of the margins, the absence of knots and the minimum trauma to the urethral wall together enable to create an anastomosis that is both "sealed" and "tension free", allowing a quick "welding" of the margins and an early catheter removal. Regarding urinary continence, 56. 6 % (51) of patients were continent at catheter removal, 87. 6 % (78) were continent 3 months later and 98. 9 % (89) were continent after 6 months.

We describe our technique for transperitoneal laparoscopic robotic-assisted nephropexy. The surgery was performed on a 78 -year-old woman with a BMI of 18 and ASA 2. The diagnosis of nephroptosis was preoperatively confirmed by excretory urography in the supine and upright positions. The patient was placed in Trendelemburg position on the left side. The laparoscopic surgery was performed, through a transperitoneal approach, using the daVinci system: the ptosic kidney was fixed using two separated stiches of non-absorbable prolene 2. 0 between the superior surface of the kidney and the quadratus lumborum muscle. The sutures were <b>fixed</b> using Hem-o-lok <b>clips.</b> Intra- or post-operative complications have not occurred.

40|$|Modern {{communication}} systems demand ever-increasing data rates. Meeting this increased demand {{is not easy}} due to regulation and fundamental physical constraints. The utilization {{of more than one}} antenna at both the transmitter and receiver produces a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel, thereby enabling (under certain channel conditions) increased data rates without the need for increased bandwidth or transmission power. Concurrent with this increase in bandwidth is an increase in the receiver's computational complexity which, for a brute-force detector, increases exponentially. For receivers that possess error correcting capabilities, the problem of constructing a detector with low computational complexity that allows for near-exact a posteriori detection is challenging for transmission schemes employing even a modest number of transmit antennas and modulation alphabet sizes. The focus of this dissertation is on the construction of MIMO detection algorithms with low and fixed computational complexity. Specifically, the detection algorithms in this dissertation generate a list of potential transmission vectors resulting in realizable communication receivers with low and fixed computational complexity combined with low error rate performance in both coded and uncoded systems. A key contribution in this dissertation is a breadth-first fixed-complexity algorithm known as the smart-ordered and candidate-adding algorithm that achieves a desirable performance-complexity tradeoff. This algorithm requires only a single pass of a search tree to find its list of transmission vectors. We then construct a framework within which we classify a large class of breadth-first detection algorithms. The design of receiver algorithms for MIMO systems employing space-time codes and error correction is an important area of study. In this dissertation we propose a low and fixed computational complexity algorithm for an increasingly significant algebraic space-time code known as the golden code. The notion of computational complexity is critical in the design of practical MIMO receivers. We provide an analysis of computational complexity in relation to list-based soft-output detection where, in some instances, bounds are placed on the computational complexity of MIMO detection. For this analysis we utilize a metric known as the number of branch metric computations. The value at which the log-likelihood ratio (LLR) of conditional probabilities for a transmitted bit being either a 1 or a 0 is 'clipped' has an impact on a system's error rate performance. We propose a new approach for determining LLR clipping levels that, in contrast to prior approaches which clip to a predetermined <b>fixed</b> LLR <b>clipping</b> level, exploits channel state information to improve the error rate performance of suboptimal detection algorithms. Orthogonal frequency-division (OFDM) multiplexing is an effective technique for combating frequency-selective wideband communication channels. It is common practice for MIMO-OFDM detectors to implement the same detector at each subcarrier, in which case the overall performance is dominated by the weakest subcarrier. We propose a hard-output list detection receiver strategy for MIMO-OFDM channels called nonuniform computational complexity allocation, whereby the receiver adapts the computational resources of the MIMO detector at each subcarrier to match a metric of the corresponding channel quality. The proposed nonuniform algorithm improves performance over uniform allocation. Ph. D.

5000|$|In 2002 Robert Chicken {{patented}} a {{sheet to}} tiller {{system in the}} UK, known as The Steersman. It consists of two swinging platforms fitted on to the cockpit coamings {{either side of the}} boat,. The normal jib sheet winches are moved from their normal position and then re-bolted down on to the top of these platforms.With the sails set, the leeward jib sheet is cleated to the winch in the normal way, and the wind pressure in the jib, transmitted through the jib sheet, swings the platform forward. To balance this movement, a shock cord spring tensioned between the platform and a point at the stern of the boat, keeps the platform in a central neutral position. Once set, any slight changes in wind strength or direction, causes the platform to swing forwards or backwards. A simple linkage then transmits this movement to the helm to keep the boat on course.The pressure in the sails can vary hugely depending on the wind strength and the direction that the boat is travelling relative to the wind. To accommodate this, the spring is arranged in a ‘block-and-tackle’ form with a double block fitted to the stern of the boat, and a single block clipped to the platform. The fixed end, and tail end are also attached to the platform; the <b>fixed</b> end is <b>clipped,</b> and the tail end passes through a jamb cleat for fine adjustment. With this in place, the maximum spring tension is now made up of four lengths of shock cord. For a lower wind pressure in the jib, the fixed end, and the single block can be re-clipped to an attachment point on the base of the platform. This then gives a range of spring strengths from one to four shock cord lengths. For very light wind pressures, a single lighter length of shock cord is used instead.The claimed benefit of this design over a windvane system that it [...] "is far more sensitive because it uses the larger jib area to sense any changes in the wind" [...] is questionable. When the jib is in laminar flow, i.e. optimally trimmed and delivers maximum propulsion, the force at the sheet is biggest and decreases to both sides of course deviation from this optimum. Concluding from that, the ship must be sailed with sub-optimal sail trim in order to have the proper steering correction at the tiller. Its position in the cockpit area however leaves the stern of the boat clear for other purposes such as dinghy davits, stern ladders etc. In 2012, the invention won the Haven Academy Award in the UK. The chairman of the judging committee was Sir Robin Knox-Johnston, the first person to complete a circumnavigation non-stop, single handed.|$|R
