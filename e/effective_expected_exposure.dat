40|$|This {{work will}} study {{different}} methods to estimate counterparty credit risk, where the methods represent both analytical approximation and simulation based method. The somewhat more analytical approximation {{that will be}} used is the current exposure method from the Bank for International Settlements and is based on simple add-on factor to the current market value. In the simulation part, Monte Carlo methods will be used. The paper will show that Monte Carlo methods enable estimation of the full exposure distribution as a function of time. From that distribution two measures of exposure will be used. The first use the peak at the 95 % percentile and the second uses the concept of <b>effective</b> <b>expected</b> <b>exposure.</b> Those three alternative measures will be tested on six different portfolios. The portfolios are based on real data and represent both private persons, small companies, life insurance, investment bank and some of more academic interest. The estimate of exposure in those portfolios will be estimated with and without the establishment of netting agreements in order to see how that affects the exposure. The numerical results indicate that netting results in reduced exposure. In the comparisons between the different exposure measures the results show that the simulation based method in general estimates a lower exposure, but it depends intently on the construction of the portfolio. Based on those observations the main conclusion is that a simulation based approach is preferable since it enables better risk control within the firm as a consequence of enabling anatomizes of the evolution of exposure through time.

40|$|Counterparty {{credit risk}} (CCR), a key {{driver of the}} 2007 - 08 credit crisis, has become one of the main focuses of the major global and U. S. {{regulatory}} standards. Financial institutions invest large amounts of resources employing Monte Carlo simulation to measure and price their counterparty credit risk. We develop efficient Monte Carlo CCR frameworks by focusing on {{the most widely used}} and regulatory-driven CCR measures: expected positive exposure (EPE), credit value adjustment (CVA), and <b>effective</b> <b>expected</b> positive <b>exposure</b> (eEPE). Our numerical examples illustrate that our proposed efficient Monte Carlo estimators outperform the existing crude estimators of these CCR measures substantially in terms of mean square error (MSE). We also demonstrate that the two widely used sampling methods, the so-called Path Dependent Simulation (PDS) and Direct Jump to Simulation date (DJS), are not equivalent in that they lead to Monte Carlo CCR estimators which are drastically different in terms of their MSE...|$|R

40|$|Counterparty {{credit risk}} {{management}} {{has become an}} important issue for financial institutions since the Basel III framework was introduced. <b>Expected</b> <b>exposure</b> (EE) {{is defined as the}} average (positive) exposure at a future date, it is an essential component in the measurement of counterparty credit risk. This thesis aims to develop an efficient Monte Carlo method to calculate the <b>expected</b> <b>exposures</b> for Asian and barrier options. These options are path-dependent in that their payoffs depend on the historical prices of the underlying assets. Since analytical solutions are generally not available to path-dependent options, the evaluation of the <b>expected</b> <b>exposures</b> has to rely on numerical methods. Monte Carlo method is considered to be more efficient than other methods in particular for high dimension problems. We briefly introduce the concepts and terms regarding credit exposures in the Basel III framework. Then, we introduce Asian and barrier options as well as some basic pricing models. Next, we will extend the optimized least squares Monte Carlo (OLSM) method to calculate the credit exposures for Asian and barrier options and present our numerical results...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the relationship between glove use and acute traumatic occupational hand injury. We used a case-crossover, within-subject study design to control for differences between individuals such as occupation, injury history, age, gender, risk-taking behavior, manual dexterity, and muscle strength. A total of 1166 hand-injured workers were interviewed regarding the use of gloves at the time of the injury. The self-reported average duration of glove use in the previous work month was the measure of <b>expected</b> <b>exposure</b> to wearing gloves. Nineteen percent of subjects reported wearing gloves at the time of the injury. The <b>expected</b> <b>exposure</b> to glove use in the past work month was 27. 9 %.

40|$|In this paper, we derive {{a forward}} {{analytical}} formula for computing the <b>expected</b> <b>exposure</b> of financial derivatives. Under general {{assumptions about the}} underlying diffusion process, we give a convenient decomposition of the exposure into two terms: The first term is an intrinsic value part which is directly deduced from the term structure of the forward mark-to-market. The second term expresses the variability of the future mark-to-market and represents the time value part. Abstract In the spirit of Dupire's equation for local volatility, our representation establishes a differential equation {{for the evolution of}} the <b>expected</b> <b>exposure</b> with respect to the observation dates. Our results are twofold: First, we derive analytically an integral formula for the exposure's expectation and we highlight straightforward links with local times and the co-area formula. Second, we show that from a numerical perspective, our solution can be significantly efficient when compared to standard numerical methods. The accuracy and time-efficiency of the forward representation are of special interest in benchmarking XVA valuation adjustments at the trade level...|$|R

40|$|Aim To {{investigate}} {{the quality of}} periapical radiographic images produced by two digital dental radiography systems, a charge-coupled device (CCD) and a photostimulable phosphor (PSP) image plate system, and to examine the overall radiation exposure when using these systems in a clinical setting. Methodology Patients were randomly allocated to both systems and the resultant radiographs rated for quality. The <b>expected</b> radiation <b>exposure</b> for an investigation was calculated. Results Overall, 98 images were acquired using the CCD system and 108 with the PSP system. The PSP system produced significantly higher quality (P < 0. 001) periapical images compared with the CCD system. The CCD system required significantly more (P < 0. 001) repeat exposures to obtain a diagnostic image than the PSP system but at a lower <b>expected</b> radiation <b>exposure.</b> Conclusions The image quality was superior using the phosphor plate system. Although more repeat radiographs were required using the CCD system, the images were produced with a lower <b>expected</b> radiation <b>exposure...</b>|$|R

The smaller margin for mAbs appears justified because the exposure in the female partner is more predictable than for small molecules, given the more generalizable PK of mAbs.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a numerically accurate and computationally fast approximation to {{the prices of}} European options on coupon-bearing instruments that is applicable to the entire family of affine term structure models. Exploiting the typical shapes of the conditional distributions of the risk factors in affine diffusions, we show that one can reliably compute the relevant probabilities needed for pricing options on coupon-bearing instruments by the same Fourier inversion methods used in the pricing of options on zero-coupon bonds. We apply our theoretical results to the pricing of options on coupon bonds and swaptions, and the calculation of "expected exposures" on swap books. As an empirical illustration, we compute the <b>expected</b> <b>exposures</b> implied by several affine term structure models fit to historical swap yields.

40|$|The {{electromagnetic}} field leakage levels of nonionizing radiation from {{a microwave oven}} have been estimated within a complex indoor scenario. By employing a hybrid simulation technique, based on coupling full wave simulation with an in-house developed deterministic 3 D ray launching code, estimations of the observed electric field values can be obtained for the complete indoor scenario. The microwave oven can be modeled as a time- and frequency-dependent radiating source, in which leakage, basically from the microwave oven door, is propagated along the complete indoor scenario interacting {{with all of the}} elements present in it.

Derived from the activity data, data about sleep efficiency and sleep latency could be obtained. The subjects also filled out the PSQI questionnaire, rating whether they are good or bad sleepers. Due to the Dutch climate, it was <b>expected</b> that <b>exposure</b> to daylight would be lower in winter than in summer. Consequently, {{it was expected that}} sleep quality would be worse in winter. However, the sleep quality measures did not differ significantly between summer and winter. The results did show a positive correlation between sleep efficiency and exposure duration to high intensity light, meaning that more light is related to efficient sleep.

We find that the <b>expected</b> <b>exposure</b> time for detection is> 1 Ms for aimpoint observations for both HRC-I and HRC-S, and therefore recommend discontinuing them. We also find that the predicted count rate due to the UV/optical flux is sufficient to have already resulted in a detection for observations carried out over the thin filter regions at large off-axis angles of the HRC-S. The non-detections therefore suggest that the out-of-band response must be decreased, by a factor < 0 : 3. We also recommend consolidating the observations over the outer wing plate into a single one at an off-axis angle of − 250. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{address the}} problem of allocating the counterparty-level credit {{valuation}} adjustment (CVA) to the individual trades composing the portfolio.

We propose a methodology for calculating conditional EE contributions for both collateralized and non-collateralized counterparties. Calculation of EE contributions can be easily incorporated into exposure simulation processes that already exist in a financial institution. We also derive closed-form expressions for EE contributions under the assumption that trade values are normally distributed. Analytical results are obtained for the case when the trade values and the counterparty's credit quality are independent as well as when there is a dependence between them (wrong-way risk).
