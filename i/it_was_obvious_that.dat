5|$|In 1858, Louis Faidherbe, the {{governor}} of Senegal, inaugurated the Bouteville boat that was capable of transporting 150 passengers, animals {{and all kinds of}} goods. The boat made ten crosses every day and the fares differed: five centimes for a person, 50 centimes for a horse, cow or camel, and two francs for a carriage. In less than a year <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>obvious</b> <b>that</b> this system was overrun and a second boat was introduced but with no success.|$|E
5|$|The {{preceding}} German large cruiser design, , was {{an incremental}} increase over previous armored cruisers. Blücher was armed with twelve 21cm(8.3in) guns, {{and designed to}} counter what the Germans knew about the British , which were assumed to be larger iterations of the basic armored cruiser type. Once sufficient information about the new British cruisers became available, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>obvious</b> <b>that</b> they were not simply an enlargement on previous designs but a whole new type of warship—the battlecruiser—to which Blücher was quite inferior. However, there were insufficient funds to alter Blüchers layout, so the cruiser assigned for 1907 {{would have to be}} an entirely new design.|$|E
5|$|The French {{squadron}} {{had become}} disorganised in its initial pursuit the British, with Manche, under Captain Jean Dornal de Guy, falling substantially to leeward of the flagship. Seeing this, Stewart realised {{that the best}} hope his convoy had of survival was to unite and attack Manche together. The combined batteries of the East Indiamen could be deployed en masse, hopefully inflicting enough damage to drive Manche away and discourage Hamelin in Vénus from attacking alone. Signalling his intentions to the captains of Charlton and United Kingdom, Stewart turned towards Vénus and bore down on her. Hamelin, realising the threat his scattered squadron faced, signalled for his ships to join up. With the wind against him however, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>obvious</b> <b>that</b> Windham would reach Manche first.|$|E

5|$|A police {{investigation}} was initiated in October 1971 to uncover any criminal action {{taken by the}} company. Tjøntveit announced in December 1971 that he had established a new airline—Norwegian Overseas Airways (NOA)—which intended to operate freight routes using the Lockheed L-100 Hercules. The {{police investigation}} quickly established that there were shortcomings in Trans Polar's bookkeeping {{and that there were}} several violations of aviation regulations. However, they police had difficulty establishing who was responsible in the company. As Tjøntveit was no longer a Norwegian citizen, he was prohibited from holding management and board positions in the airline. Still, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>obvious</b> <b>that</b> he had been calling the shots. Because NOA could not obtain Scandinavian operating permits, it moved its operations to Bangladesh—hindering the police from interviewing Tjøntveit and other central managers in Trans Polar who had joined the new airline. The police also stated that the investigation took too long because they had too few investigators with expertise in financial crime.|$|E
5|$|Attempts {{were made}} to {{photograph}} the corpse for the naval identity card Martin would have to carry, but the results were unsatisfactory, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>obvious</b> <b>that</b> the images were of a cadaver. Montagu and Cholmondeley conducted a search for people who resembled the corpse, finding Captain Ronnie Reed of MI5; Reed agreed to be photographed for the identity card, wearing Royal Marine uniform. As the three cards and passes needed looked too new for a long-serving officer, they were issued as recent replacements for lost originals. Montagu spent {{the next few weeks}} rubbing all three cards on his trousers to provide a used sheen to them. To provide a used look to the uniform, it was worn by Cholmondeley, who was about the same build. The only non-issue part to the uniform was the underwear, which was in short supply in war-rationed Britain, so a pair of good-quality woollen underwear, owned by the late Herbert Fisher, the Warden of New College, Oxford, was used.|$|E
5|$|The SWAPO {{incursion}} {{became a}} complex political issue, {{and led to}} a week of tense negotiations. The UN considered emergency airlifts to bring more peacekeepers into the territory, and the United States offered aid. On 9 April 1989 an agreement was reached at Mount Etjo (the Mount Etjo Declaration), calling for the rapid deployment of UNTAG forces and outlining a withdrawal procedure for PLAN soldiers (Operation Safe Passage) under which they would leave the country. Operation Piddock was the name for the Australian part of the operation. Horner wrote that if UNTAG were to play any role in ending the fighting, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>obvious</b> <b>that</b> the Australians would be the key component. This was complex, and required authorisation from Gration and Defence Minister Kim Beazley for Australian troops to supervise the withdrawal of insurgent forces. It required the Australian Army engineers and British signallers to work as infantry, manning border and internal-assembly points. At the time, these were the only units which could be redeployed quickly to northern Namibia.|$|E

25|$|Total {{length of}} the British {{railways}} at 1 January 1923 was 19,585 route miles (31,336km). From {{the end of the}} 1920s, when <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>obvious</b> <b>that</b> the motor vehicle was in the ascendancy, dozens of little-used branch lines began to close: some to passenger traffic, many completely.|$|E
25|$|The {{next year}} Williams lost the Renault engine instead using a rebranded version called Mecachrome, they also lost Adrian Newey to McLaren and found {{themselves}} on the back foot. Nevertheless, Frentzen started well finishing third in the opening race. However the might of McLaren and Ferrari shone through and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>obvious</b> <b>that</b> Williams would struggle to keep pace.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the arrival}} of the Jubilee line, London's Docklands had {{suffered}} from relatively poor public transport. Although the Docklands Light Railway station at Canary Wharf had been operating since 1987, by 1990 <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>obvious</b> <b>that</b> the DLR's capacity would soon be reached. The Jubilee line's routing through Canary Wharf was intended to relieve some of this pressure.|$|E

25|$|Rae {{found it}} more {{difficult}} to garner support than he had in the last leadership contest, with his 2006 campaign co-chair now supporting Ignatieff. As <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>obvious</b> <b>that</b> Ignatieff had lined up enough support to become the party's leader, Rae withdrew on December 9, 2008. He has since criticized Ignatieff's decision to withdraw from the coalition with the NDP.|$|E
25|$|Work {{started on}} 25 October 1865, {{but less than}} a year later <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>obvious</b> <b>that</b> the capital was grossly inadequate. Authority for {{extension}} of time and raising more capital was obtained, but by then few investors had any confidence that their investment would pay. In 1868 a further extension was granted, but little further work was done, and nearly all the money had gone.|$|E
25|$|By March 1920, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>obvious</b> <b>that</b> the {{economic}} and political situation in the ADR had reached a crucial point. In accordance with the analysis made by the Bolsheviks the ADR government received weak support from the people and this should have provided success to the operation.

25|$|Thus, by {{the evening}} of the 26th, the {{uprising}} had resulted in a stalemate. The Emperor and Sugiyama's opposition had prevented the achievement of its primary goal: the appointment of a military-dominated cabinet centered around Mazaki. Although they had managed to achieve a degree of official recognition for their actions, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>obvious</b> <b>that</b> they could not occupy their positions indefinitely. Their presence was their strongest bargaining chip, but even their supporters felt that it needed to end.|$|E
25|$|From the beginning, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>obvious</b> <b>that</b> {{incorporating}} Tibet into Communist China {{would bring}} two opposite social systems face-to-face. In Tibet, however, the Chinese Communists {{opted not to}} place social reform as an immediate priority. On the contrary, from 1951 to 1959, traditional Tibetan society with its lords and manorial estates continued to function unchanged. Despite the presence of twenty thousand Chinese soldiers in Central Tibet, the Dalai Lama's government was permitted to maintain important symbols from its de facto independence period.|$|E
25|$|In May 2002, Swedish {{newspaper}} Expressen {{reported that}} Victoria {{had a new}} boyfriend, her personal trainer at Master Training, Daniel Westling.
