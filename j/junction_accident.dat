Given the recent advancements in {{autonomous}} driving functions, {{one of the}} main challenges is safe and efficient operation in complex traffic situations such as road junctions. There is a need for comprehensive testing, either in virtual simulation environments or on real-world test tracks. This paper presents a novel data analysis method including the preparation, analysis and visualization of car crash data, to identify the critical pre-crash scenarios at T- and four-legged junctions as a basis for testing the safety of automated driving systems. The presented method employs k-medoids to cluster historical junction crash data into distinct partitions and then applies the association rules algorithm to each cluster to specify the driving scenarios in more detail. The dataset used consists of 1056 junction crashes in the UK, which were exported from the in-depth “On-the-Spot” database. The study resulted in thirteen crash clusters for T-junctions, and six crash clusters for crossroads. Association rules revealed common crash characteristics, which were the basis for the scenario descriptions.

50|$|Together {{with the}} Wooton bridge {{collapse}} {{the following year}} in 1861, {{there should have been}} some concern within the railway companies about the number of cast iron girders used as under-bridges on railway lines. Engineers would also have been aware of the problems of cast iron in railway bridges after the failure of the Dee bridge in 1847. Whether or not such structures were inspected is unknown; it seems not, as several more collapses occurred some years later, at the Inverythan crash and the Norwood <b>Junction</b> rail <b>accident</b> in 1891. Thereafter, the vast majority of cast-iron underbridges on the rail network were eventually replaced by wrought iron or steel structures, although some cast-iron underbridges remain today, i.e. Robert Stephenson's High Level Bridge in Newcastle.|$|R

The most serious accident occurred in 1879 with the Tay Bridge disaster when the centre part of the bridge collapsed in a storm as an express train was passing over.

40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to develop}} Hierarchical Bayesian models for road accident counts that {{take account of}} the spatial dependency in the neighbouring areas or sites. The Poisson log-linear model is extended by introducing a second level of random variation that includes a conditional autoregressive (CAR) component. Both models for accidents at the area level and models for accidents on a road network are developed. Areal models are fitted using data for counties and districts in England covering two different periods and data for wards in the West Midlands region in 200 l. Network models are fitted to link data for the MI motorway and to junction data for the city of Coventry. Results show that, in most cases, adding a spatial (CAR) component to conventional models produces better estimates of the expected number of accidents in an area or at a site. Signs of the coefficients for explanatory variables, including level of traffic and road characteristics, are consistent with expectation. Levels of the spatial effects in a CAR model reflect the relative influence of the unknown or unmeasurable explanatory variables on the expected number of accidents. Results from models at the local authority level in the 2000 s show that spatial effects are positive in London boroughs and are negative in most metropolitan districts. For accidents at the ward level in the West Midlands, the performance of the CAR model {{is similar to that of}} the non-CAR model which includes log-normal random effects and metropolitan county effects. For models of accidents on the MI, several links are identified to have positive and fairly large spatial effects. For Coventry <b>junction</b> <b>accidents,</b> the CAR model does not perform better than the non-CAR model. Approaches to including temporal effects in spatial models when data cover two or more periods and jointly modelling different types of accidents are also proposed and examined. Two applications of the CAR models developed in this research are introduced. The first application is about predicting the number of accidents in a local authority in a new year based on previous years' data. One advantage of using the CAR model is that it produces more precise predictions than the non-CAR model. The second application of the CAR model is a new approach for site ranking. The sites selected by such a criterion are those with high risks caused by some unknown or unmeasured factors for instance, curvature or gradient of roads) which are spatially correlated. Further on-site investigation will be needed to identify such factors...|$|R

50|$|It is memorable {{for coming}} after the Dee bridge {{disaster}} of 1847, when another cast iron bridge had failed. Cast iron {{should not have}} been used in this safety-critical application, and the design seems very strange, using cast iron where timber baulks would have sufficed. The bridge had been built in 1844, well before the Dee accident, and patched with the angle iron in 1853. The discovery of the cracked girder should have alerted engineers to the problem, and all should have been replaced entirely. Cast iron failures remained a problem for many years, culminating in the fall of the Tay Rail Bridge in December, 1879 with over 75 casualties in the passenger express passing over the viaduct at the time the cast iron columns collapsed. The problem did not end there, however, because so much cast iron had been used on the rail network. A cast iron under-bridge failed suddenly under a train during the Inverythan crash in 1882, killing 5 passengers on the train. The event which really focused minds occurred in 1891, when another girder failed under the Brighton express. Although no-one was killed, the furore caused by the Norwood <b>Junction</b> rail <b>accident</b> led to a survey of all under-bridges. Several thousand were eventually found, and ultimately strengthened or replaced.|$|R

40|$|The overall {{purpose of}} the ASSESS project {{is to develop a}} {{relevant}} and standardised set of test and assessment methods and associated tools for integrated vehicle safety systems, primarily focussing on currently available pre-crash sensing systems. The first stage of the project was to define casualty relevant accident scenarios so that the test scenarios will be developed based on accident scenarios which currently result in the greatest injury outcome, measured by a combination of casualty severity and casualty frequency. The first analysis stage was completed using data from a range of accident databases, including those which were nationally representative (STATS 19, UK and STRADA, SE) and in-depth sources which provided more detailed parameters to characterise the accident scenarios (GIDAS, DE and OTS, UK). A common analysis method was developed in order to compare the data from these different sources, and while the data sets were not completely compatible, the majority of the data was aligned {{in such a way that}} allowed a useful comparison to be made. As the ASSESS project focuses on pre-crash sensing systems fitted to passenger cars, the data selected for the analysis was “injury accidents which involved at least one passenger car”. The accident data analysis yielded the following ranked list of most relevant accident scenarios: Rank Accident scenario 1 Driving accident - single vehicle loss of control 2 Accidents in longitudinal traffic (same and opposite directions) 3 Accidents with turning vehicle(s) or crossing paths in <b>junctions</b> 4 <b>Accidents</b> involving pedestrians The ranked list highlights the relatively large role played by ‘accidents in longitudinal traffic’, and ‘accidents with turning vehicle(s) or crossing paths in junctions’ (the second and third most prevalent accident scenarios, respectively).

This indicates that the ASSESS project is highly relevant to the current casualty crash problem.

40|$|The "Road Infrastructure Safety Management Evaluation Tools (RISMET) " project targets {{objective}} A (Development {{of evaluation}} tools) of the Joint Call for Proposals for Safety at the Heart of Road Design ("The Call"). This project aims at developing suitable road safety engineering evaluation tools that {{will support the}} aims of the Call as described in the Guide for Applicants (GfA) and furthermore those of the Directive for Road Infrastructure Safety Management (2008). These evaluation tools allow the easy identification of both unsafe (from accidents or related indicators) and potentially unsafe (from design and other criteria) locations in a road network. With such evaluation tools estimates of potential benefits at the local and the network level can be calculated and potential effects on aspects such as driver behaviour can be estimated. Such tools empower road authorities to improve their decision making and to implement (ameliorative) measures to improve the road safety situation on the roads. Since evaluation tools rely on good quality data, RISMET aims at reviewing available data sources for effective road infrastructure safety management in EU-countries, linked to a quick scan and assessment of current practices. Furthermore, RISMET aims at exploiting results related to the development and use of Accident Prediction Models (APMs) in road safety management. The present deliverable provides APMs for data collected at junctions from the rural road networks of Austria, Norway, Portugal and Holland. For the first three countries it was possible to obtain accident prediction models for each country individually. For Holland, however, and due to restrictions on the dimension of the data set, it was only possible to analyse these data together with the other countries data, i. e. analysing aggregated data sets. The data consists, per <b>junction,</b> of injury <b>accident</b> counts, type of junction, traffic control, speed limit and annual average daily traffics entering from the major and the minor road. The regression models had the injury accident frequencies as the dependent variable and the remaining variables as explanatory and were fitted using Bayesian statistical techniques with vague or non-informative prior and hyper-prior distributions. These models consisted on the Poisson regression model, hierarchical Poisson-Gamma and Poisson Log-Normal hierarchical regression model. The Poisson regression model was found to be not appropriate to model the junction data in any of the data sets due to not being able to capture variations and attributes of the data, namely the over-dispersion. The Poisson-Gamma and the Poisson Log-Normal models obtained similar results and in general performed equally well. It was found that <b>accidents</b> occurring at <b>junctions</b> in all countries depend on the junction’s entering traffic volume {{as well as the other}} explanatory variables considered.

40|$|This report {{proceeds}} on {{the report}} “ITS and traffic safety, Intelligent Transport Systems” (RA-MOW- 2008 - 007) and expands on the possibilities of ITS systems for the enhancement of traffic safety around intersections equipped with traffic lights. It seems quite obvious {{that there is a}} higher risk for traffic <b>accidents</b> at <b>junctions</b> then on other road segments, since road users cross at <b>junctions.</b> Based on <b>accident</b> statistics, this report proves that enhancing safety around intersections indeed has a strong positive impact on the global traffic safety. It also introduces the use of Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) as a mean to enhance safety around crossroads equipped with traffic lights. A detailed technical description is given of the communication techniques supporting such systems, and an extensive overview is given of the state-of-the-art in the most relevant related research projects. Accident statistics prove that an important portion of both fatal and non-fatal accidents occur at intersections. In the EU- 13 this represents 5. 476 casualties or 21. 3 % of all traffic casualties. In Belgium 19. 3 % of all traffic casualties are the consequence of incidents at intersections. When the absolute figures are divided per million inhabitants, Belgium has the fifth highest number of deaths at intersections in Europe (after Italy, Hungary, Estonia and Poland). This Belgian number, 20 lethal accidents per million inhabitants, is higher then the average EU- 13 (18. 1) and EU- 16 (19) numbers. In the Intersafe project (performed within the PReVENT project) several accident scenarios where studied, and among others the percentage of intersection fatalities within the total of traffic casualties were determined for France, Great-Brittan and Germany. Junctions are responsible for 30 to 60 % of the incidents with wounded, and 16 to 36 % of the fatal incidents. When examining the analyses of red light negation, it can be concluded that the critical situation can be avoided if the driver is informed and warned earlier. However, it has to be guaranteed that this information and warnings do not lead to an even more dangerous risky behaviour where they are interpreted as “if I drive faster I will be able to just catch the green light”. This would create an even higher risk of serious accidents, therefore enough attention should be given to this issue. The above numbers and analyses prove that enhancing safety around intersections should be a priority in traffic policy. Extra attention should be given to preventing red light negation, since this is {{a major part of the}} dangerous traffic violations. Research focusing on accidents on intersections proved that there is a connection between the type of intersection and the degree of traffic safety on that junction. A study was found that provides a quantitative evaluation of traffic safety around different types of intersections, expressed as the number of registered incidents with wounded per million passing vehicles. This number is the highest for intersections with traffic lights (0. 11), followed by junctions on a main road (0. 09), junctions with right of way (0. 09), roundabouts (0. 07) and junctions without right of way (0. 06). The average number of wounded per accident decrease in the following order: traffic lights, main road, right of way, no right of way (respectively 1. 22, 1. 18, 1. 11, 1. 09). The seriousness of accidents, expressed as the number of hospitalizations rather increases in that order (respectively 17, 16, 18, 18). This means that rearranging intersections can be beneficial. An American study investigated what the effect would be if the junctions in North Virginia were rearranged. It was concluded that delays would be lowered with 62 to 74 % (according to junction type), meaning a reduction of 300. 000 lost hours per year. The annual saving in fuel consumption would be 200. 000 gallons (757. 000 litres). Traffic safety would increase drastically: reforming junctions into roundabouts would result in 62 less accidents and 42 less wounded (comparison between 1993 en 2003 with five crossroads for which accident statistics were available). Therefore a logical measure to enhance traffic safety is to rearrange intersections equipped with traffic lights or to transform them into roundabouts. Other possible measures can be related to traffic lights regulation, road layout (canalization, slopes, facilities for vulnerable road users, etc), improvement of visibility, driving education, speed management around intersections, enforcement (camera’s), road surface, etc. These measures are already applied in Flanders today. But a technique that is almost entirely neglected is the employment of Intelligent Transport Systems to increase traffic safety around intersections. This approach is further elaborated in this report. When traffic control infrastructure at crossroads is extended with intelligent software and possibly sensors and means to communicate with neighbouring vehicles, applications can be developed with a positive impact on different domains. The three most important ones are traffic safety, traffic circulation and the environment. Many studies focusing on intelligent intersections aim to enhance traffic circulation. Self-organizing traffic lights divide traffic into platoons by counting (e. g. using counter loops in the road surface) the number of vehicles waiting at the traffic lights, and adjusting the switching times accordingly. This technique was applied in a traffic simulator to the Wetstraat in Brussels, where it would lower the total travel times approximately 25 %. In other research a system was developed where every vehicle can vote for switching of the lights. For this it communicates it’s identity, direction, position and place in the queue to the traffic light. Using this information of all the neighbouring vehicles, the light can calculate which light switch will result into the greatest total profit for all vehicles. Results showed an enhancement in average waiting times from 30 to 50 %. In the domain of positive effects on traffic safety, developments are taking place in a number of European research projects such as PReVENT, Safespot and VII. Frequent scenarios that are being tackled are avoiding of or warning for red light negation, avoiding accidents with vulnerable road users and coordination of turning left with oncoming traffic. Also, applications that aim for an enhancement in traffic circulation imply an enhancement in traffic safety. Less research can be found aiming at environmental benefits, but again applications focusing on enhancement of traffic circulation imply positive effects on the environment. A common aspect of many of these applications is the fact that they rely on communication technology. This can be divided into three major groups: local short-range communication, cellular data networks and digital broadcast technologies. When they are studied in the scope of intelligent intersection control, then both broadcast- and cellular technologies do not qualify as a possible supporting technology. This because of the one-way communication character of broadcasting, and the higher delays and end user cost of cellular data networks. This limits the choice to local communication media, more specific CEN DSRC, IEEE 802. 11 p, CALM-M 5, CALM-IR and IEEE 802. 15. 4. When taking a closer look at their parameters, they indeed seem to be very suitable: they are interactive, free to use, can offer a high bandwidth and are not dependent of network operator coverage. An extensive technical description of these communication technologies is given in this report. CEN DSRC is typically used for Electronic Toll Collect (such as Télépéage in France). However it is not suitable for the implementation of intelligent traffic lights because it only supports one-way communication. IEEE 802. 11 p is an amendment to the well-known IEEE 802. 11 Wireless LAN technology (also known under the Wi-Fi hallmark) for use in vehicular environments. This technology is also not suitable for intelligent traffic lights in Flanders since it operates on the ITS frequency bands of the US. CALM-M 5 however is the European derivate of IEEE 802. 11 p, and this technology indeed is greatly suitable. But just like IEEE 802. 11 p it will suffer van scalability issues, meaning that more research regarding scalable routing protocols has to be conducted before it can be used in a real rollout. In the field of directional communication both European standards CALM-IR and CALM-MM qualify as an implementation candidate. CALM-IR is a communication standard based on infrared light, en is very good in sharply defining communication zones. CALM-MM operates on frequencies similar to radar, and can provide very high bandwidths. On short to medium term CALM-IR has the advantage that it is already much further developed then CALM-MM. IEEE 802. 15. 4 is a communication technology used in wireless sensor networks. Its main characteristics are energy efficiency and scalability. This technology is most suited for application in mobile devices, thus for including vulnerable road users in the intelligent intersection. However this requires that the (typically SANET) routing protocols on top of this technology support mobility. This demands further research. To conclude, on short to medium term three communication technologies qualify for the implementation of intelligent traffic lights: CALM-M 5, CALM-IR and IEEE 802. 15. 4. CALM-M 5 is suitable for omnidirectional communication with vehicles, CALM-IR for directional communication with vehicles and IEEE 802. 15. 4 for omnidirectional communication with vulnerable road users. Further research is needed regarding suitable routing protocols before CALM-M 5 and IEEE 802. 15. 4 can be successfully applied in intelligent intersections. Based on these technological developments, several research projects already investigate intelligent intersections. INTERSAFE is a subproject of the PReVENT project. Goal is to inform and/or warn the driver about traffic lights; this information/warning contains information regarding the time and the proper speed to safely cross or exit the intersection. The idea is to avoid conflicts at junctions with these information/warnings. These conflicts can be caused by absent-mindedness (not noticing the traffic light or the state of the lights), by maladjusted driving behaviour in function of the expected red- or green cycle, or by an inadequate insight in the traffic lights installation. Finally, it is expected that this information/warning will stimulate the driver to adjust his driving behaviour, reducing the risk for conflicts. This adjustment of the driving behaviour mainly is related to a decrease in speed, this can be performed gradually, but can bend to severe braking if the information/warning is not taken into account on time. Two demonstration vehicles were designed for testing this technique. A visual and auditive warning was used to give speed advice. Complying with this speed implies that the intersection can be safely crossed. Demonstrations at Versailles proved that this systems works well on the test roads from a technical point of view. However, the nature of the provided information and the voluntary character of the system imply that the safety on these intelligent intersections is highly dependent of they way the driver translates the information/warning into adjusted driving behaviour. From this research project, it appears that if some specific technical enhancements are conducted, supporting driving behaviour at intersections can improve traffic safety. IRIS is a sub-project of the Safespot project. IRIS uses vehicle-infrastructure communication to analyze the movements of all individual vehicles, and laser scanners to identify vulnerable road users. Based on these inputs, the system can assess dangerous situations on time and take necessary measures to avoid accidents (such as adjusting switching times of the lights or sending warning messages to human-machine interfaces in the vehicles using wireless communication). The IRIS system focuses on three scenarios responsible for a major part of the accidents at intersections: red light negation, turning left (conflict with oncoming traffic) and turning right (conflict with vulnerable road users). In the project experiments are performed in a driving simulator. Simulation makes it possible to perform a more systematic and extensive analysis of the applications and their possible variations. Early during development simulation can be useful to study the timing of the applications, derive optimal parameter settings and assess the potential impact of the applications if validation in the real world is not possible. In parallel with the simulation work, a real IRIS system is built and tested in the project. In May 2009 a first public demonstration of this system will be given Helmond, The Netherlands. Aiming to improve traffic circulation and to reduce consumption and emissions, the project Tovergroen was set up in The Netherlands. Tovergroen is a system to detect trucks and give them priority if possible by prolonging their green phase. However, the detection system performed inadequate, not recognizing trucks or recognizing the wrong vehicles as trucks (campers, cars with trailers, etc). Despites these problems Tovergroen increases the chance that trucks do not have to stop with 5 to 10 %. Tovergroen decreases red light negation of heavy traffic with approximately 30 %. It is expected that the positive effect will be even greater using a more reliable detection system. In cooperation with the Technical University of Munich, Inglostadt en GEVAS software, Audi has developed Travolution. Aim is to inform drivers regarding the appropriate speed to maintain to cross the intersection without stopping. Using wireless communication, the intelligent traffic light sends the duration of the red light to the in-vehicle system. The in-vehicle system then calculates the appropriate speed to catch the green light and informs the driver. In Inglostadt 46 intersections were equipped with this system, and two test vehicles were used. In the next phase, this experiment will be extended with 20 cars and an additional 50 intersections. Goal is to investigate how the optimization of traffic light controllers in urban areas can decrease pollution and travel times. At the ITS World congress in New York, several other applications were demonstrated where information is communicated from traffic lights to vehicles. Although there is almost no information available regarding these demonstrated applications, a short description is included in this report...|$|R
