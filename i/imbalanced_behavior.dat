While there, Jerry calls his manager {{to find out that}} NBC has offered them $13,000 for the pilot. George is insulted by this. He then glances out the window and thinks he sees Crazy Joe Davola outside. This makes Jerry and George afraid to leave the cafe. Jerry attempts to enlist the help of a policeman in getting out; however, the policeman decides to order a sandwich and refuses to escort them out until he has eaten. Elaine's psychiatrist realizes that he did not leave an extra prescription for Joe Davola for the time while he would be on vacation, thus explaining Joe's <b>imbalanced</b> <b>behavior.</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The WTC–deafness Kyoto (dfk) rat {{is a new}} mutant {{characterized}} by deafness and abnormal, <b>imbalanced</b> <b>behavior.</b> WTC-dfk rats carry an intragenic deletion at the Kcnq 1 gene; KCNQ 1 {{plays an important role}} in K+ homeostasis, and the mutation of Kcnq 1 causes a cardiac long QT syndrome in humans. Here, we studied stomach lesions in these WTC-dfk rats. The most characteristic pathologic feature in the stomach was the appearance of hypertrophic gastric glands in the stomach body. The hypertrophic cells had many eosinophilic granules in their cytoplasm, and these granules were stained red with Azan stain; stained positively for trypsinogen, amylase, and chymotrypsin; and did not stain positively for pepsinogen when using immunohistochemical analysis. These staining results suggested a metaplasia toward a pancreatic acinar cells. Extensive fibrosis was found in the bottom part of the mucosa of 34 -week-old WTC-dfk rats, suggesting a progression of stomach lesions with aging. Although cells that were positive for proliferating cell nuclear antigen were restricted in the area of the glandular neck in WTC control rats, positive cells in WTC-dfk rats were scattered throughout the mucosa. The parietal cells in WTC-dfk rats were negative for KCNQ 1 immunohistochemical analysis. These findings indicate that a deficiency in rat Kcnq 1 provokes an abnormal proliferation and differentiation of gastric glandular cells.

40|$|The mesostriatal dopaminergic system, which {{comprises}} the mesolimbic and the nigrostriatal pathways, {{plays a major}} role in neural processing underlying motor and limbic functions. Multiple reports suggest that these processes are influenced by hemispheric differences in striatal dopamine (DA) levels, DA turnover and its receptor activity. Here, we review studies which measured the concentration of DA and its metabolites to examine the relationship between DA <b>imbalance</b> and animal <b>behavior</b> under different conditions. Specifically, we assess evidence in support of endogenous, inter-hemispheric DA imbalance; determine whether the known anatomy provides a suitable substrate for this imbalance; examine the relationship between DA imbalance and animal behavior; and characterize the symmetry of the observed inter-hemispheric laterality in the nigrostriatal and the mesolimbic DA systems. We conclude that many studies provide supporting evidence for the occurrence of experience-dependent endogenous DA imbalance which is controlled by a dedicated regulatory/compensatory mechanism. Additionally, it seems that the link between DA <b>imbalance</b> and animal <b>behavior</b> is better characterized in the nigrostriatal than in the mesolimbic system. Nonetheless, a variety of brain and behavioral manipulations demonstrate that the nigrostriatal system displays symmetrical laterality whereas the mesolimbic system displays asymmetrical laterality which supports hemispheric specialization in rodents. The reciprocity of the relationship between DA <b>imbalance</b> and animal <b>behavior</b> (i. e. the capacity of animal training to alter DA imbalance for prolonged time periods) remains controversial, however, if confirmed, may provide a valuable noninvasive therapeutic means for treating abnormal DA imbalance...|$|R
40|$|Big {{data have}} contributed to deepen our {{understanding}} in regards to many human systems, particularly human mobility patterns and the structure and functioning of transportation systems. Resonating the recent call for 'open big data,' big data from various sources {{on a range of}} scales have become increasingly accessible to the public. However, open big data relevant to travelers within public transit tools remain scarce, hindering any further in-depth study on human mobility patterns. Here, we explore ticketing-website derived data that are publically available but have been largely neglected. We demonstrate the power, potential and limitations of this open big data, using the Chinese high-speed rail (HSR) system as an example. Using an application programming interface, we automatically collected the data on the remaining tickets (RTD) for scheduled trains at the last second before departure in order to retrieve information on unused transit capacity, occupancy rate of trains, and passenger flux at stations. We show that this information is highly useful in characterizing the spatiotemporal patterns of traveling behaviors on the Chinese HSR, such as weekend traveling <b>behavior,</b> <b>imbalanced</b> commuting <b>behavior,</b> and station functionality. Our work facilitates the understanding of human traveling patterns along the Chinese HSR, and the functionality of the largest HSR system in the world. We expect our work to attract attention regarding this unique open big data source for the study of analogous transportation systems...|$|R

In PACS these rods produce a damping torque and reduce the satellite angular momentum and angular velocity. In this paper, a spin satellite was investigated which utilizes a passive magnetic damper consisting of magnetic hysteresis rods aligned with principal axis or spin axis of satellite and de-tumbling of the satellite, and the pure spin was achieved. An analytical model was presented to analyze hysteresis damper and a numerical simulation was performed to obtain dynamic properties of the spin attitude. In addition, assuming a dynamic <b>imbalance,</b> attitude <b>behavior</b> and damper effect on the spin rate of satellite were analyzed.

40|$|For the {{objective}} measurement of animal behavior from video, automated recognition systems are frequently employed. These systems rely on action models learned from labeled example videos. Manually labeling videos of animal behavior however is time consuming and error-prone. We propose {{to reduce the}} labeling effort by selecting suitable training instances from the unlabeled corpus and learn the action models iteratively in interaction with the user. Due to the typical <b>imbalance</b> of <b>behavior</b> datasets, a greedy selection strategy would fail to select enough minority class samples. To address the imbalance we first find potential action prototypes by clustering the unlabeled data using a Dirichlet Process Gaussian Mixture Model. We then sample instances from the prototypes and obtain a more balanced training set. We evaluate our system on two rat interaction datasets with different class priors and demonstrate a learning rate that is superior to the baseline...|$|R

Tagging {{is in fact a}} sharply skewed process in which a small minority of "supertagger" users generate an overwhelming majority of the annotations. Using data from three large-scale social tagging platforms, we explore (a) how to best quantify the <b>imbalance</b> in tagging <b>behavior</b> and formally define a supertagger, (b) how supertaggers differ from other users in their tagging patterns, and (c) if effects of motivation and expertise inform our understanding of what makes a supertagger. Our results indicate that such prolific users not only tag more than their counterparts, but in quantifiably different ways. Specifically, we find that supertaggers are more likely to label content in the long tail of less popular items, that they show differences in patterns of content tagged and terms utilized, and are measurably different with respect to tagging expertise and motivation. These findings suggest we should question the extent to which folksonomies achieve crowdsourced classification via the "wisdom of the crowd", especially for broad folksonomies like Last. fm as opposed to narrow folksonomies like Flickr.

40|$|Abstract: The {{oxidative}} imbalance {{appears to}} {{have an important role}} in anxiety development. Studies in both humans and animals have shown a strong correlation between anxiety and oxidative stress. In humans, for example, the increased malondialdehyde levels and discrepancies in antioxidant enzymes in erythrocytes have been observed. In animals, several studies also show that anxiety-like behavior is related to the oxidative <b>imbalance.</b> Moreover, anxiety-like <b>behavior</b> can be caused by pharmacological-induced oxidative stress. Studies using knockout or overexpression of antioxidant enzymes have shown a relationship between anxiety-like behavior and oxidative stress. Related factors of oxidative stress that could influence anxious behavior are revised, including impaired function of different mitochondrial proteins, inflammatory cytokines, and neurotrophic factors. It has been suggested that a therapy specifically focus in reducing reactive species production may have a beneficial effect in reducing anxiety. However, the neurobiological pathways underlying the effect of oxidative stress on anxiety symptoms are not fully comprehended. The challenge now is to identify the oxidative stress mechanisms likely {{to be involved in the}} induction of anxiety symptoms. Understanding these pathways could help to clarify the neurobiology of the anxiety disorder and provide tools for new discovery in therapies and preventive strategies...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} role {{of public and private}} <b>imbalances</b> in the <b>behavior</b> of the current account balance in the United States {{in the context of an}} intertemporal model. The {{estimation}} evaluates the effects of public and private imbalances on the dynamics of the current account. Correlation coefficients support the Ricardian equivalence. Higher budget deficit correlates with a reduction in private consumption and an increase in private savings. Government saving does not vary significantly with macroeconomic variables in the short or in the long-run. In contrast, fluctuations in government investment vary significantly with a number of economic variables in the long and in the short-run. Accordingly, fluctuations in the budget deficit are likely to be driven by fluctuations in public investment. In contrast to government savings, private savings vary significantly with macro variables in the long and in the short-run. Fluctuations in private investment appear less evident compared to that in private savings. Overall, fluctuations in the current account balance appear to be more tied to movements in the budget deficit. Nonetheless, fluctuations in the budget deficit are moderated by an increase in private savings and a reduction in private investment, moderating fluctuations in the current account balance.

The early childhood samples consisted of 123 Turkish and 128 Dutch mothers (mean age for children was 4. 9 years). In the late childhood samples, self-report {{data were collected from}} 124 Indian and 129 Dutch children (mean age 10. 9 years). In the adolescent samples self-report data were collected from 165 ethnic Moroccan and 165 ethnic Dutch adolescents (mean age 15. 2 years). In all studies, questionnaire data on sibling power imbalance and internalizing and externalizing problems were collected. Results showed only one significant cross-cultural difference in sibling power imbalance: The Indian sample reported more sibling power imbalance than the Dutch. Links between sibling power <b>imbalance</b> and problem <b>behavior</b> were highly similar between the different cultural samples. The only significant difference was a stronger impact of sibling power imbalance on externalizing problems for the Dutch compared to the Turkish sample. Concluding, few cross-cultural differences were found in sibling power imbalance.

40|$|The {{level of}} {{excitation}} {{in the brain}} is kept under control through inhibitory signals mainly exerted by GABA neurons. However, the molecular machinery that regulates the balance between excitation and inhibition (E/I) remains unclear. Candidate molecules implicated in this process are neuroligin (NL) adhesion molecules, which are differentially enriched at either excitatory or inhibitory contacts. In this study, we use transgenic mouse models expressing NL 1 or NL 2 to examine whether enhanced expression of specific NLs results in synaptic imbalance and altered neuronal excitability and animal behavior. Our analysis reveals several abnormalities selectively manifested in transgenic mice with enhanced expression of NL 2 but not NL 1. A small change in NL 2 expression results in enlarged synaptic contact size and vesicle reserve pool in frontal cortex synapses and an overall reduction in the E/I ratio. The frequency of miniature inhibitory synaptic currents was also found to be increased in the frontal cortex of transgenic NL 2 mice. These animals also manifested stereotyped jumping behavior, anxiety, impaired social interactions, and enhanced incidence of spike-wave discharges, as depicted by EEG analysis in freely moving animals. These findings may provide the neural basis for E/I <b>imbalance</b> and altered <b>behavior</b> associated with neurodevelopmental disorders.

40|$|The morphology, {{growth and}} {{physiology}} of oil palms (Elaeis guineensis Jacq., Deli x Nigeria variety) was characterized {{at different stages}} of development of the condition known as ‘dry spear’ or FS (for ‘flecha seca’ in Spanish), and some morpho-physiological indicators associated with a predisposition for the disorder were identified. In Costa Rica, ‘FS’ has symptomology very similar to spear rot or PC (pudrición del cogollo), as it was described in South America. ‘PC’ is a dynamic disorder of complex etiology that affects the development and physiology of palms. The symptomology (‘yellowing’, drying and rotting/) occurs in young leaves and in tissues near the meristem. The aerial symptoms are associated with a deteriorated fine root system. During the initial stages of the disorder in the season with the least precipitation (3. 8 - 73 mm/month), the palms presented low water potential in the leaves, increases in stomatic conductance, reduction in foliage temperature, higher chlorophyll content and reduction of vegetative development. The loss of the fine root system was possibly the cause of the interruption of hormonal ‘signals’ toward the aerial part; which caused the loss of stomatic control of transpiration that led to a hydric, nutritional and energetic <b>imbalance.</b> The anomalous <b>behavior</b> of stomatic conductance and other variables (root density and petiole cross-section), described in a previous article (this journal), is an indicator that could signal conditions of predisposition to a syndrome like PC.

Shown by recent polls {{to be one of the}} most unpopular cases in U. S. history, Citizens United v. FEC promises to set the tone for the Roberts Court’s treatment of money-in-politics cases. This article shows that Citizens’ holding and reasoning flow directly from neoclassical economic theory, which assumes a perfect (political) market and resists government intervention aimed at correcting power <b>imbalances</b> and anti-competitive <b>behavior.</b> This laissez-faire stance is not new to the Court, but it had been in decline during Chief Justice Rehnquist’s long tenure. Citizens resuscitates a line of neoclassical jurisprudence that traces back to the mid 1970 s, in particular to Buckley v. Valeo and First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti. After summarizing the neoclassical assumptions of Citizens, this Article provides a thorough explanation and critique of these past cases which, in essence, imported economic theory to determine the meaning of democracy. Justice Stevens’ dissenting opinion in Citizens, and alternatives to neoclassical ideology more generally, are discussed in conclusion. In sum, this Article offers two basic contributions to the literature, the first descriptive and the second normative: It explains the neoclassical underpinnings of the line of cases that culminate in Citizens, thus offering a new way to understand the dominant ideology on the Roberts Court; and it provides an argument, rooted in institutional economic theory and separatist philosophy, that the market sphere should not govern the political sphere...|$|R
40|$|A bulk of typological and crosslinguistic {{evidence}} on the internal structure of motion events has shown that Goals and Sources behave asymmetrically. This asymmetry exhibits several morphosyntactic and semantic realizations: Goal markers are morphologically simpler than Source markers; there {{tend to be more}} fine-grained semantic distinctions within the Goal domain than within the Source domain, leading to higher numbers of markers for the encoding of Goal than of Source (type level); Goals are more frequently zero-marked than Sources; and, Goal relations are encoded more frequently in discourse (token level). In this chapter, we report similar <b>imbalances</b> in the <b>behavior</b> of Sources and Goals in inner Asia Minor Greek. We find that Goal markers are more numerous than markers denoting Source and that Goal paths are more often explicitly expressed in discourse. Additionally, we test the diachronic validity of these findings, which have been reached on the basis of mostly synchronic investigations, by examining the historical developments that the Modern Greek dialects of inner Asia Minor underwent in the formal expression of Goal and Source. We analyze the (a) symmetrical relations that hold between the two locative roles as evidenced by the qualitative and quantitative use of the prepositions se ‘to, at’, os ‘up to, until’, tʃax/tʃáus ‘up to, until’, and apó ‘from’, focusing specifically on the implications that the diachronic loss of se, the most frequent Goal marker, had for the spatial system of inner Asia Minor Greek. Our analysis shows that Goal markers remain morphologically less complex than Source markers across diachronic stages; and, that the overt Goal marker develops into a zero marker earlier than the Source marker. These findings support the Goal-over-Source predominance hypothesis. However, our analysis also indicates that the asymmetry could under certain circumstances work in the opposite direction...|$|R
40|$|Background and Hypothesis: Over {{the past}} 30 years, {{childhood}} obesity in the US has nearly doubled, while obesity has tripled among adolescents. Non-homeostatic eating, influenced by impulsivity and inhibition, may undermine successful long-term weight loss. We hypothesized that unhealthy eating habits and adiposity among children {{are associated with}} functional connectivity between brain regions associated with impulsivity, response inhibition, and reward. Methods: We analyzed resting state functional magnetic resonance images from 38 children, ages 8 – 13. Using seed-based resting state functional connectivity, we quantified connectivity between brain regions associated with response inhibition (inferior parietal lobe [IPL]), impulsivity (frontal pole), and reward (nucleus accumbens [NAc]). We assessed the relationship of resting state functional connectivity with adiposity, quantified by BMI z-score, and eating behaviors, {{as measured by the}} Child Eating Behaviour Questionnaire (CEBQ). We computed an imbalance measure—the difference between [frontal pole:NAC] and [ipl:nac] functional connectivity—and investigated the relationship of this <b>imbalance</b> with eating <b>behaviors</b> and adiposity. Results: As functional connectivity imbalance is increasingly biased toward impulsivity, adiposity increases. Similarly, as impulsivity-biased imbalance increases, food approach behaviors increase and food avoidance behaviors decrease. Increased adiposity is associated with increased food approach behaviors and decreased food avoidance behaviors. Conclusions: In the absence of any explicit eating-related stimuli, the developing brain is primed toward food approach and away from food avoidance behavior with increasing adiposity. Imbalance in resting state functional connectivity that is associated with non-homeostatic eating develops during childhood, as early as 8 – 13 years of age. Our results indicate the importance of identifying children at risk for obesity for earlier intervention. In addition to changing eating habits and physical activity, strategies that normalize neural functional connectivity imbalance are needed to maintain healthy weight. Mindfulness may be one such approach as it is associated with increased response inhibition and decreased impulsivity...|$|R

The result of this research is concluded that Salman Mosque has fulfilled the activity needs, however, the capacity of the mosque has not been able to accommodate the number of users at the busiest time. The physical state of the mosque has an impact on the behavior of the user, such as complying the flow of circulation in accordance to the space organization, such as gathering in an open area that has better air circulation. That kind of behavior is making influence on the environment itself, for instance its addition on the facility outside the original concept of the mosque.

40|$|Background and Aim: Iran has {{experienced}} a great variation in women's status in recent years. There is a little knowledge on how and why advancing gender equality and equity and the empowerment of women {{play a role in}} recent fertility reduction in the country. This study was conducted to gain insight into the role of gender beliefs and women's empowerment in the couples 'experiences of fertility in Mashhad, Iran in 2011 - 2012. Methods: In this exploratory qualitative study in-depth interviews were conducted with 54 purposefully selected eligible male and female participants and some key informants who lived in urban society of Mashhad. Data was collected until saturation was happened and analyzed adopting conventional content analysis approach through giving analytical codes and identification of categories using MAXqda software. Study rigor verified via prolonged engagement, thick description and validation of anlysis through member check. Results:Findings from data analysis demonstrated three major categories about the influence of women’s empowerment and gender role on fertility experiences including: 1) The couple’s understanding of gender roles 2) Women’s empowerment and changing gender roles 3) Couple’s interactions in complementary or parallel roles and 4) Fulfillment of fertility goals based on role division. Some aspects of couples' interaction including equal roles in fertility decisions, choosing and using best fit family planning method and participative child care influenced couples' fertility behavior. Women’s empowerment together with balanced gender role in the family resulted in success in attaining couple’s fertility desire. Conclusion: Managing fertility behaviors needs to understand the roles of spouses in their mutual interaction in fertility decision making and related <b>behaviors.</b> <b>Imbalanced</b> gender role in family acts as an obstacle to reach the fertility goals and leads to lower than desired fertility. Reproductive health policy makers and family planning counselors could apply {{the findings of this study}} in order to publicize proper fertility behaviors through making the couples aware of the risks of gender role imbalance. ...|$|R
40|$|In drug users, drug-related cues {{alone can}} induce {{dopamine}} release in the dorsal striatum. Instructive cues activate inputs to the striatum from both dopaminergic and cholinergic neurons, which {{are thought to}} work together to support motor learning and motivated <b>behaviors.</b> <b>Imbalances</b> in these neuromodulatory influences can impair normal action selection and might thus contribute to pathologically repetitive and compulsive behaviors such as drug addiction. Dopamine and acetylcholine can have either antagonistic or synergistic effects on behavior, depending {{on the state of the}} animal and the receptor signaling systems at play. Semi-synchronized activation of cholinergic interneurons in the dorsal striatum drives dopamine release via presynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors located on dopamine terminals. Nicotinic receptor blockade is known to diminish abnormal repetitive behaviors (stereotypies) induced by psychomotor stimulants. By contrast, blockade of postsynaptic acetylcholine muscarinic receptors in the dorsomedial striatum exacerbates drug-induced stereotypy, exemplifying how different acetylcholine receptors can also have opposing effects. Although acetylcholine release is known to be altered in animal models of drug addiction, predicting whether these changes will augment or diminish drug-induced behaviors thus remains a challenge. Here, we measured amphetamine-induced stereotypy in BAC transgenic mice that have been shown to overexpress the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) with consequent increased acetylcholine release. We found that drug-induced stereotypies, consisting of confined sniffing and licking behaviors, were greatly increased in the transgenic mice relative to sibling controls, as was striatal VAChT protein. These findings suggest that VAChT-mediated increases in acetylcholine could be critical in exacerbating drug-induced stereotypic behaviors and promoting exaggerated behavioral fixity.

40|$|The {{recognition}} of partner abuse between lesbian intimates has gained {{attention in the}} literature only within the last few decades. The current research indicates that physical and psychological abuse is occurring between lesbian partners {{at about the same}} rate as their heterosexual counterparts. The theoretical explanations for lesbian partner abuse share similarities with the heterosexual paradigm. However, significant differences in gender make-up and the patriarchal issues of power and control do not fit within the lesbian framework and the unique issues of attachment in lesbian relationships and the issue of homophobia are cause for another perspective. This study shifts the focus from gender differences to explain abusive behavior, to another paradigm examining both the individual characteristics of the abuser as well as the particular dimensions of the relationship. This research sought to measure whether a lesbian’s sex role identity is associated with her abusive behavior toward an intimate female partner, focusing specifically on whether the dimensions o f masculinity and femininity help to explain abusive behavior. Additionally, building on existing research in the field of lesbian partner abuse, this study examined to what extent the relationship factors o f dependency, jealousy, and power imbalance are related to abusive behavior. There were four purposes o f this study 1) to investigate to what extent partner abuse exists among lesbian intimates; 2) to examine the nature o f this abusive behavior; 3) to examine whether there is an association between sex role identity and abusive behavior; and 4) to investigate {{the extent to which the}} relationship factors o f dependency, jealousy, and power imbalance are related to abusive behavior in lesbian relationships. This study addresses existing gaps in the research on lesbian partner abuse by combining intra-individual, social-psychological, and socio-cultural ideologies by making use o f a cross-sectional convenience sample o f 105 lesbians who frequent the New York City Lesbian and Gay Community Services Center. Participants, who were self-identified lesbians currently in a relationship for at least six months, completed the Bern Sex Role Inventory Scale (BSRI), the Abusive Behavior Inventory (ABI), and a Relationship Factor Scale containing items that measure dependency, jealousy, and power imbalance in the relationship. The results show that, when abuse is broadly defined, a sizable minority is classified as exhibiting high rates of physical and psychological abuse at some time during their current relationship, although the abuse is such that it would not cause serious physical injury to the victim. The findings also indicate that sex role identity is neither positively nor negatively correlated with abusive behavior. The findings failed to show an association between dependency and abusive <b>behavior</b> or power <b>imbalance</b> and abusive <b>behavior.</b> As a group, masculinity, femininity, dependency, jealousy, and power imbalance only explain 18 % o f the variance in overall abuse and 17 % of the variance in psychological abuse. The findings further indicate that jealousy was significantly associated with overall abuse, psychological abuse, and physical abuse. Jealousy was also the strongest predictor o f abuse when all other variables were held constant. The implications of these findings underscore the need for social workers to recognize lesbian partner abuse and its unique factors. Further the findings indicate the importance for the social work profession to enhance delivery of services to battered lesbians, expanded intervention programs for lesbian batterers, and develop preventative initiatives designed to adequately address the issue o f partner abuse in lesbian relationships. Additionally, since the results o f this study suggest that jealousy may be associated to abusive behavior, issues surrounding jealousy can be included in educational programs for lesbians designed to promote healthy and non-abusive relationships...|$|R
