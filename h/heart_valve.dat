40|$|Abstract. Artificial <b>heart</b> <b>valves</b> are {{engineered}} devices {{used for}} replacing dis-eased or damaged natural <b>valves</b> of the <b>heart.</b> Most commonly used for replace-ment are mechanical <b>heart</b> <b>valves</b> and biological valves. This paper briefly outlines the evolution, designs employed, materials being used,. and important {{factors that affect}} the performance of mechanical <b>heart</b> <b>valves.</b> The clinical performance of mechanical <b>heart</b> <b>valves</b> is also addressed. Efforts made in India {{in the development of}} mechanical <b>heart</b> <b>valves</b> are also discussed...|$|R
50|$|Note {{that during}} isovolumetric/isovolumic {{contraction}} and relaxation, all the <b>heart</b> <b>valves</b> are closed. At no time {{are all the}} <b>heart</b> <b>valves</b> open.|$|R
50|$|Valvular {{heart disease}} is {{diagnosed}} by echocardiography, which {{is a form of}} ultrasound. Damaged and defective <b>heart</b> <b>valves</b> can be repaired, or replaced with artificial <b>heart</b> <b>valves.</b> Infectious causes may also require treatment with antibiotics.|$|R
5|$|After the {{completion}} of the opera Britten went into the National Heart Hospital and was operated on in May 1973 to replace a failing <b>heart</b> <b>valve.</b> The replacement was successful, but he suffered a slight stroke, affecting his right hand. This brought his career as a performer to an end. While in hospital Britten became friendly with a senior nursing sister, Rita Thomson; she moved to Aldeburgh in 1974 and looked after him until his death.|$|E
5|$|Five {{medications}} {{have evidence}} for long-term use orlistat, lorcaserin, liraglutide, phentermine–topiramate, and naltrexone–bupropion. They result in weight loss {{after one year}} ranged from 3.0 to 6.7kg over placebo. Orlistat, liraglutide, and naltrexone–bupropion are available in both the United States and Europe, whereas lorcaserin and phentermine–topiramate are available only in the United States. European regulatory authorities rejected the latter two drugs {{in part because of}} associations of <b>heart</b> <b>valve</b> problems with lorcaserin and more general heart and blood vessel problems with phentermine–topiramate. Orlistat use is associated with high rates of gastrointestinal side effects and concerns have been raised about negative effects on the kidneys. There is no information on how these drugs affect longer-term complications of obesity such as cardiovascular disease or death.|$|E
5|$|Glenn was in {{good health}} {{for most of his}} life. He {{retained}} a private pilot's license well into his 80s, eventually quitting flying {{when he and his wife}} found it too difficult to get into the cockpit due to knee problems. In June 2014, Glenn underwent successful <b>heart</b> <b>valve</b> replacement surgery at the Cleveland Clinic. In early December 2016, he was hospitalized at the James Cancer Hospital of Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center in Columbus. According to a family source, Glenn had been in declining health, and his condition was grave; his wife and their children and grandchildren were at the hospital.|$|E
40|$|There are {{two types}} of {{artificial}} <b>heart</b> <b>valves,</b> namely, (i) biological valves and (ii) mechanical <b>valves.</b> biological <b>heart</b> <b>valves</b> are made from tissue taken from animals or human cadavers. They are treated with preservatives and sterilized for human implantation. On the other hand, mechanical <b>heart</b> <b>valves</b> are made of man-made materials. The advantage of mechanical valves over biological valves is that they normally last for a comparatively longer lifetime. The biological valves exhibit a shorter lifetime and tend to wear out with time in service. This chapter discusses mechanical <b>heart</b> <b>valves</b> and highlights the underlying problems faced with biomaterials used in the manufacture of such valves.

5|$|Sanford's {{opponent}} in the 1992 election was Lauch Faircloth, a former Democrat turned Republican who had served as state Highway Commissioner in Sanford's gubernatorial administration. Enjoying substantial backing from Sanford's Senate colleague, Jesse Helms, Faircloth accused Sanford of being a tax-and-spend liberal bound to special interests. While initial polls showed that Sanford had a comfortable lead over his rival, he lost supporters after an operation for an infected <b>heart</b> <b>valve</b> kept him from campaigning for much of October and raised doubts {{as to whether he}} was capable of serving another term. On November 3, 1992, Faircloth won the election by a 100,000-vote margin.|$|E
25|$|Valves are {{integral}} to the normal physiological functioning of the human heart. Natural heart valves are evolved to forms that perform the functional requirement of inducing unidirectional blood flow through the valve structure from one chamber of the heart to another. Natural heart valves become dysfunctional {{for a variety of}} pathological causes. Some pathologies may require complete surgical replacement of the natural <b>heart</b> <b>valve</b> with a <b>heart</b> <b>valve</b> prosthesis.|$|E

40|$|AbstractCollagen and elastin are {{two major}} {{components}} of the extracellular matrix of <b>heart</b> <b>valves.</b> This work examines bi-layer scaffolds made of collagen and elastin for potential use in the tissue engineering of <b>heart</b> <b>valves,</b> by investigating {{the effects of the}} layered structure on the mechanical and biological properties. The scaffolds showed anisotropic bending moduli depending on the loading directions (lower when with curvature than against curvature), which mimicked the characteristic behaviour of the native <b>heart</b> <b>valves.</b> The interaction of cardiosphere-drived cells with the scaffolds was characterized by scanning electron microscopy and multiphoton microscopy, and an asymmetrical cell distribution was observed. The bi-layer scaffolds have represented a forwarding step to the tri-layer scaffolds that more closely resemble the native <b>heart</b> <b>valves...</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>heart</b> <b>valves</b> and the {{chambers}} {{are lined with}} endocardium. <b>Heart</b> <b>valves</b> separate the atria from the ventricles, or the ventricles from a blood vessel. <b>Heart</b> <b>valves</b> are situated around the fibrous rings of the cardiac skeleton. The valves incorporate leaflets or cusps, which are pushed open to allow blood flow and which then close together to seal and prevent backflow. The mitral valve has two cusps, whereas the others have three. There are nodules at {{the tips of the}} cusps that make the seal tighter.|$|R
25|$|Schwarzenegger {{was born}} with a {{bicuspid}} aortic valve, an aortic valve with only two leaflets (a normal aortic valve has three leaflets). Schwarzenegger opted in 1997 for a replacement <b>heart</b> <b>valve</b> made of his own transplanted tissue; medical experts predicted he would require <b>heart</b> <b>valve</b> replacement surgery in the following two to eight years as his valve would progressively degrade. Schwarzenegger apparently opted against a mechanical valve, the only permanent solution available {{at the time of his}} surgery, because it would have sharply limited his physical activity and capacity to exercise.|$|E

25|$|An {{artificial}} <b>heart</b> <b>valve</b> is {{a device}} {{implanted in the}} heart of a patient with valvular heart disease.

40|$|Background and ObjectivesMetastatic {{calcification}} {{is usually}} found {{in patients with}} chronic renal failure and hemodialyzed patients. Heart calcification becomes worse in hemodialyzed patients due to several factors. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate relationship between Calcium, Phosphorous and Parathoromone(PTH) with calcification of <b>heart</b> <b>valves</b> in dialyzed patients. MethodsThis study is a Case- series study. 71 patients with calcification of <b>heart</b> <b>valves</b> who have referred for dialysis to Kamkar and Valiasr hospitals in Qom were selected as study population through echocardiography. Levels of Calcium, Phosphorous and PTH in the patients were assayed by suitable methods. ResultsOur results showed that in % 17 / 5 of study population the level of calcium was higher than 10. 4 mg/dl, in % 75. 1 the level of PTH was higher than 70 um/lit and finally the level of Phosphorous in % 54. 2 was higher than 4. 5 mg/dl. We concluded that there are a meaningful relationship between calcification of <b>heart</b> <b>valves</b> and levels of calcium, Phosphorous and PTH. ConclusionMeasurement of serum calcium, Phosphorous and PTH and performing echocardiography for prevention of calcification of <b>heart</b> <b>valves</b> are necessary in individuals who are dialyzed.
