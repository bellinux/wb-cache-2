40|$|The C-HU Andrew System is a {{well-known}} result of a <b>joint</b> <b>study</b> <b>project</b> sponsored by IBM at Carnegie-Mellon University. This paper discusses a related project {{referred to as the}} "PC Server". The PC Server permits access to the Andrew network, and a subset of its services, from the entire family of IBM personal computers. The PC Server provides a mapping of the PC-DOS file system onto the Andrew network's VICE file system, such that existing PC software can transparently access files using the campus network. This extends to PC users the advantages of a large, centrally managed, shared file system that is functionally indistinguishable from an ordinary local disk drive. The PC Server also provides peripheral capabilities for synchronizing the time in the local machine with the campus network, changing account passwords, and accessing the Andrew printing, mail, and bulletin board subsystems. This paper discusses the rationale behind the PC Server and describes the organization and structure of its major components, as well as the interfaces and protocols used among them.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{highlight}} the constraints on participatory rural development in Sri Lanka, and formulate an alternative participatory approach to resource poor villages through literature surveys on main participatory projects of the country, and intensive village studies and my experiences from the University of Colombo-Japan International Cooperation Agency (UC-JICA) <b>Joint</b> <b>Study</b> <b>Project</b> on Participatory Rural Development and several field studies conducted in Japan. Under the UC-JICA Project, constraints on participation and other information were received from the project activities but also my experiences as the Field Manager especially from the participatory research activities, which were carried out by me in the project villages. In addition, the above constraints and other information were received not only from the mid and final evaluations carried out by JICA but also from the several evaluations were carried out by me. According to the above objectives, this paper has two sections. Section one summarizes the constraints on participatory rural development while Section two presents an alternative approach to participation and sustainable rural development...|$|E

40|$|The European Radiation Research Programme refocused {{some of its}} {{research}} effort within EU countries to consider the environmental consequences of the Chernobyl accident within the third framework period from 1985 to 1989. A gradual improvement in contacts with the Soviet Union occurred from 1990 and allowed the development of research collaboration between EC and Soviet scientists. In response, a programme of Experimental Collaborative <b>Projects</b> (ECP) and <b>Joint</b> <b>Study</b> <b>Projects</b> (JSP) were launched by the EC-DGXII’s Radiation Protection Research Action. Within these projects, Western European and Eastern European scientists collaborated on assessing {{the consequences of the}} accident, considering remedial actions and acquiring much basic scientific information on the behaviour of radionuclides in the contaminated territories in Ukraine, Belarus and the Russian Federation. The major goal of all these studies was to provide practical and theoretical assistance to the relevant authorities, based on a fundamental approach of understanding the environmental factors which control the different exposure rates to both the urban and rural populations living in the contaminated areas. The scientific results of the radioecological projects have been summarised at the First International Conference on the Radiological consequences of the Chernobyl accident. This Conference was organised by the European Commission and the Belarus, Russian and Ukrainian Ministries on Chernobyl affairs, Emergency Situations and Health. This paper summarises the achievements of the radioecological programme...|$|R
40|$|Preliminary results {{obtained}} from the JAWS (<b>Joint</b> Airport Weather <b>Studies)</b> <b>Project</b> near Denver, Colorado {{in the spring and}} summer of 1982 using Doppler radar, PAM, and aerial photography are presented. The definitions of the microburst phenomenon are discussed, and statistics comparing NIMROD (Northern Illinois Meteorological Research On Downbursts) for the Midwest region are compared with JAWS for the High Plains region. Possible parent clouds of the microburst are considered, and an analysis of a macroburst/microburst event on July 14, 1982 is presented...|$|R

40|$|Organization, equipment, and {{the current}} status of the <b>Joint</b> Airport Weather <b>Studies</b> <b>project</b> {{initiated}} in relation to the microburst phenomenon are summarized. Some data collection techniques and preliminary statistics on microburst events recorded by Doppler radar are discussed as well. Radar studies show that microbursts occur much more often than expected, with majority of the events being potentially dangerous to landing or departing aircraft. Seventy events were registered, with the differential velocities ranging from 10 to 48 m/s; headwind/tailwind velocity differentials over 20 m/s are considered seriously hazardous. It is noted that a correlation is yet to be established between the velocity differential and incoherent radar reflectivity...|$|R
40|$|Documentation is {{furnished}} for {{the clear}} air mesocyclone that propagated through {{the network of}} the <b>Joint</b> Airport Weather <b>Studies</b> <b>project</b> near Denver, CO, on June 5, 1982. Despite present classification as a mesocyclone, the analyses here reported have revealed two separate features affecting the area: a mesocirculation, defined by the kinematics of the wind field, and a mesolow, determined {{on the basis of}} the pressure field. The occurrence of these two conditions in the Denver area, in relation to the synoptic scale environment, raises a question as to whether this phenomenon is an example of cyclogenesis in the lee of a large mountain range...|$|R
40|$|The {{principal}} {{objective of the}} <b>Joint</b> Airport Weather <b>Studies</b> <b>Project</b> was to obtain high-resolution velocity, turbulence, and thermodynamic data on a convective outflow called a microburst, an intense downdraft and resulting horizontal outflow near the surface. Data collection occurred {{during the summer of}} 1982 near Denver, CO. Data sensors included three pulsed-microwave Doppler and two pulsed CO 2 lidar radars, along with 27 Portable Automated Mesonet surface weather stations, the FAA's low-level-wind-shear alert system (LLWSAS), and five instrumented research aircraft. Convective storms occurred on 75 of 91 operational days, with Doppler data being collected on at least 70 microbursts. Analyses reported included a thorough examination of microburst-climatology statistics, the capability of the LLWSAS to detect adequately and accurately the presence of low-altitude wind shear danger to aircraft, the capability of a terminal Doppler radar system development to provide improved wind-shear detection and warning, and progress toward improved wind-shear training for pilots...|$|R

40|$|The {{traditional}} multi joint mechanical serial {{parallel structure}} biomimetic fish has lower propulsive efficiency, more energy transmission loss, more complicated mechanical design and control algorithms because of more mechanical joints. While the flexible body has infinite degrees of freedom, {{and the energy}} in it is stored by elasticity and inertia, it is more viscous than that of multi <b>joints.</b> This <b>project</b> <b>studies</b> the principle of carangidae fish in carangidae carp, takes it as the bionic object, and designs a biomimetic fish with a flexible body tail structure to improve propulsive efficiency. This study explores the biomimetic fish propulsion speed and caudal aspect ratio, caudal oscillation frequency, modal distribution curve, and optimizes a parameter set of fish tail that can achieve effective promotion. So {{it is good for}} the exploration of the development of high speed, high efficiency, high maneuverability of bionic propeller swing on theoretical basis and practical aspects...|$|R
40|$|The {{awareness}} of the environmental impact of buildings concerning their CO 2 emissions, their energy and resource consumption has raised the challenges on building design, construction and operation. Building service systems are among the main contributors to building related emissions. Their consideration already in design is therefore of growing importance. Distributed service systems represent a new paradigm towards the supply of a building with energy and matter. Being small, efficient and networked, they can be distributed within the building fabric to allow an efficiently supply of the building space. Their employment, however, affects the spatial layout, construction and resulting building performance. In order to capture the resulting complex dependencies, a strategy to integrate such systems into the architectural design process is necessary. In this work a design process is proposed, that integrates distributed service systems into building design, dissolving the classical divide between architectural design and service systems layout. Digital modelling and computational methods are employed to create and analyse design solutions, visualize performance criteria and provide the relevant data for the intended digital fabrication process. The process is exemplified using a <b>joint</b> university-industry case <b>study</b> <b>project</b> focusing on parametric faÃ§ade modules, developed in a seamless digital process from concept to fabrication...|$|R
