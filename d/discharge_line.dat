This alarm, along with higher than normal temperatures on the pilot-operated relief valve <b>discharge</b> <b>line</b> and unusually high containment building temperatures and pressures, were clear indications {{that there was an}} ongoing loss-of-coolant accident, but these indications were initially ignored by operators. At 4:15am, the relief diaphragm of the pressurizer relief tank ruptured, and radioactive coolant began to leak out into the general containment building. This radioactive coolant was pumped from the containment building sump to an auxiliary building, outside the main containment, until the sump pumps were stopped at 4:39am.|$|E
50|$|When {{examining}} a sump pump and cleaning it, dirt, gravel, sand, and other debris {{should be removed}} to increase efficiency and {{extend the life of}} the pump. These obstructions can also decrease the pump's ability to drain the sump, and can allow the sump to overflow. The check valve can also jam from the debris. Examine the <b>discharge</b> <b>line</b> opening, when applicable, to ensure there are no obstructions in the line. Even a partially obstructed <b>discharge</b> <b>line</b> can force a sump pump to work harder and increase its chance of overheating and failure.|$|E

50|$|There are 14 4-stage 80,000-horsepower {{centrifugal}} pumps that push the {{water up to}} the top of the mountain. Each motor-pump unit stands 65-feet high and weighs 420 tons. The pumps themselves extend downward six floors. Each unit discharges water into a manifold that connects to the main <b>discharge</b> <b>lines.</b> The two main <b>discharge</b> <b>lines</b> stairstep up the mountain in an 8400-foot long tunnel. They are 12.5 feet in diameter for the first half and 14-feet in diameter for the last half. They each contain 8.5 million gallons of water at all times. At full capacity, the pumps can fling nearly 2 million gallons per minute up over the Tehachapis. At the top of mountain, there’s a 68-feet high, 50-foot diameter surge tank. This prevents tunnel damage when the valves to the pumps are suddenly open or closed. Near the top of the lift there are valves which can close the <b>discharge</b> <b>lines</b> to prevent backflow into the pumping plant below in event of a rupture.|$|R

50|$|An OCM takes {{a trickle}} sample from the OWS {{overboard}} <b>discharge</b> <b>line</b> and shines a {{light through the}} sample to an optical sensor. Since small oil droplets will diffract and diffuse light, a change in signal at the sensor will indicate the presence of oil. At a certain signal setting that is roughly equivalent to 15 ppm, the sensor will conclude that {{there is too much}} oil going though the <b>discharge</b> <b>line.</b> This calibration generally takes place in a lab, but can be tested by use of a three-sample liquid aboard the vessel. If the OCM ends up sampling a certain amount of heavy oil, the OCM will be fouled and it will need to be flushed or cleaned.The cleaning can be done by running fresh water through the OCM via a permanent connection or can be performed by opening the OCM sample area and scrubbing the sample area with a bottle brush.|$|E

50|$|Discharge {{pressure}} (also called {{high side}} pressure or head pressure) is the pressure generated on the output {{side of a}} gas compressor in a refrigeration or air conditioning system. The discharge pressure is affected by several factors: size and speed of the condenser fan, condition and cleanliness of the condenser coil, {{and the size of}} the <b>discharge</b> <b>line.</b> An extremely high discharge pressure coupled with an extremely low suction pressure is an indicator of a refrigerant restriction.|$|E

The pressure and flow rate fluctuations for the determination of the dynamic transfer matrix have been obtained from unsteady pressure measurements at suitable locations on the inlet/outlet lines of the inducer. Two loop configurations with different inlet/outlet impedances to/from the test inducer have been used in order to obtain at each excitation frequency a set of four linearly independent measurements for the detetermination of the four elements of the dynamic transfer matrix.

An Acoustic Digital Current Meter mounted on a measurement platform is {{used to measure the}} velocities over the full cross-section for establishing the measurement method. The proposed method primarily employs Chiu’s Equation which is based on entropy to establish a constant ratio the relation between the maximum and mean velocities in an irrigation canal, and compute the maximum velocity by the observed velocity profile. In consequence, the mean velocity of the lined canal can be rapidly determined by the maximum velocity and the constant ratio. The cross-sectional area of the artificial irrigation canal can be calculated for the water stage. Finally, the <b>discharge</b> in the <b>lined</b> canal can be efficiently determined by the estimated mean velocity and the cross-sectional area. Using the data of discharges and stages collected in the Wan-Dan Canal, the correlation of stage and discharge is also developed for remote real-time monitoring and estimating discharge from the pumping station.

50|$|The OCM {{continuously}} monitors {{how much}} oil {{is in the}} water that is pumped out the <b>discharge</b> <b>line</b> of the OWS system. The OCM will not allow the oil concentration of the exiting water to be above the Marpol standard of 15 ppm. This standard was first adopted in 1977 with Resolution A.393(X) which was published by IMO. These standards were updated various but the most current resolution is MEPC 107(49). The oil content meter will sound an alarm if the liquid leaving the system has an unsatisfactory amount {{of oil in the}} mixture. If it is still above that standard, then the bilge water will be reentered into the system until it meets the required criteria. The OCM uses light beams to determine how oily the water in the system is. The system will then gauge the oil concentration based on a light intensity meter. Modern oil content meters also have a data logging system that can store oil concentration measurements for more than 18 months.If the OCM determines that there is far too much of a type of oil, the OCM may be fouled and needs to be flushed out. Running clean water through the OCM sensor cell is one way it can be cleaned. Also scrubbing the sensor area with a bottle brush is another effective method. The new MEPC 107(49) regulations have set out stringent actions that require the OCM to be tamper proof and also the OCM needs to have an alarm that sounds whenever the OCM is being cleaned. When the alarm goes off, the OCM functionality will be checked by crew members.|$|E

40|$|It is {{standard}} practice to provide anechoic termination {{in order to}} obtain consistent gas pulsation measurement data for the positive displacement machinery in the compressor industry [1]. The same holds for the measurement of acoustic power generated by fans or compressors. The underlying idea is to eliminate reflected wave. This prompted several researchers {{to make use of the}} so-called two-microphone method or the transfer function method to decompose the standing wave into the two constituent progressive waves [2] in order to meet the exigencies of the industrial applications where an anechoic termination may not be available. This is particularly true of the refrigeration compressor industry where it is di$cult to control the terminal impedance in the suction or <b>discharge</b> <b>lines</b> of the regular testing facility in the factory environment [3]. However, it is generally not known or appreciated that the forward wave pressure or the associated power in a reflective environment is not equal to that in an anechoic environment. Therefore, extraction of the forward wave pressure from the standing wave pressure field by means of the two-microphone method is inherently falacious. This has been demonstrated by Lai through several tests on a simplified model [3]. The same is sought to be established here in a general way...|$|R
