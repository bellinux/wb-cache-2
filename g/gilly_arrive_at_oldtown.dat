Oldtown remained the family home, although a fire destroyed the original main house and a wing in the 1950s. He also designed Kildrought House in nearby Celbridge.|$|R

Construction on the tunnel began in 1836. Unfortunately for Montgomery, the Irish workers were not skilled at tunnel work, so he obtained English masons, English and Welsh miners, and some [...] "Dutch" [...] German labourers. More unfortunately, this caused ethnic tensions which exploded into violence in 1837 and 1838, specifically between the Irish and everyone else; rioters destroyed the tavern <b>at</b> <b>Oldtown,</b> burned shanties, and the like. There were more riots in 1839 at Little Orleans. Montgomery succeeded in boring the tunnel through on June 5, 1840, at a point 1505 ft from the south portal, but did not finish it.|$|R

He carted the saw for the mill, from Brockville over 55 miles of rough, back-country roads to cut the timber that was harvested from his father's property. Before long, the place known as Gillies Mills became known for producing square cut timber for the Quebec market and sawn lumber that was shipped to the United States via Kingston to Oswego, N.Y. [...] The hamlet became known as a lumbering town, as many other towns, such as Balaclava were in the Ottawa Valley.|$|R
