The second is a distillation residue from refining of cyclohexanol. The first stream, containing adipic, glutaric, and succinic acids, the mixture is referred to as AGS, was found to be very effective in improving the efficiency of 1 imestone scrubbers for removing SO, from coal-fired power plant flue gases. Typically, SO, removal efficiency can be increased from less than 80 % to over 90 %. AGS is currently being used at several public utility plants to bring the existing scrubbers into compliance. The unused portion of AGS is incinerated in the adipic manufacturing plant boilers as a waste <b>disposal</b> <b>and</b> energy <b>recovery</b> enhancement.

We investigate Mesozoic fine-grained sequences to evaluate the nature of sedimentological and structural processes that may control the nature of brittle deformation observed in these sequences. To characterize these fine-grained sequences we {{use a combination of}} data obtained from outcrop, including fracture orientation and density, lithologic stacking patterns, grain-size distributions and mineralogy to predict the potential for fluid bypass. In addition we also use publically available wireline log data to estimate the rock strength of these units in the subsurface. Outcrop observations of the mixed silisiclastic carbonate sequence of the Carmel Formation shows vertically continuous fractures crossing lithologic boundaries and analysis of scan-line and fracture orientation data indicate three discontinuity sets. Sets one and two are a conjugate pair of non-mineralized discontinuities which include faults and fractures, with a mean orientations of 323 °/ 78 ° and 100 °/ 76 ° respectively and discontinuity spacing ranging between 0. 2 - 0. 4 per meter. Set three is a near vertical, mineralized fracture set which is cross-cut by fractures of set one and two, with a mean orientation 31 °/ 80 and a fracture spacing of 0. 2 fractures per meter. Use of publically available wireline log data allows us to estimate rock strength over larger scales than those provided by the local outcrops. The wells selected for analysis are located within a 15 -km radius from the outcrop location. Gamma ray, sonic, and density logs from 7 wells were digitized from scanned originals. The inverse of the sonic log data was taken to obtain a velocity value (Vp), no dipole sonic logs are available therefore shear velocity was calculated using empirical relationships established by other workers. Having both compression and shear velocity as well as bulk density values we are able to empirically determine Poisson’s Ratio and Young’s Modulus. Poisson’s Ratio values for these wells ranges between 0. 18 - 0. 48, and Young’s Modulus results range from 7 GPa- 50 GPa. Most of the results obtained by this data analysis fall within the published ranges for these rock types, but the data show variability, which must be further evaluated to understand if these are related to geology or artifacts associated with the wireline...|$|E
40|$|China {{currently}} {{produces the}} largest quantity of {{municipal solid waste}} (MSW) {{in the world at}} 190, 000, 000 metric tones (World Bank 2005). China faces the continuing challenge of increased waste generation due to population growth, increased income, and increased urbanization. As part of environmental protection initiatives, the central government has issued many policy commitments at the national level to address waste management. In concurrence with the national objectives of addressing the problem of waste management, Hainan province has developed an integrated waste management plan that it hopes to implement by 2020 (The Hainan City Environment and Sanitary Association, in association with Hua Zhong University of Science and Technology of Environmental Science and Engineering, 2005). Organic waste, which accounts for a significant proportion of the waste stream in China, poses both challenges and opportunities in terms of <b>disposal</b> <b>and</b> <b>recovery.</b> While the final disposal of organics may present significant challenges, recovery of organic waste through composting is one alternative. Composting is widely recognized as an effective method of turning organic waste into a useful product. Nevertheless, the implementation of composting as part of a Municipal Solid Waste Management (MSWM) strategy faces challenges. Broadly, these challenges include administrative/policy, human acceptance and participation, management, technological and logistical, and marketing as well as composting process, source separation, contamination, quality of the final product, appropriate composting technologies and final demand and distribution of the final product (Schubeler et al. 1996, Hoornweg et al. 1999). This thesis uses a case study approach in implementing a composting pilot project in cooperation with the local and provincial government in Baisha Hainan China. Labor intensive, low technological, windrow composting is used so as to assess the challenges and potential of implementing composting as part of a municipal solid waste management strategy in Baisha Hainan China. The research uses a participatory action research approach incorporating research methods such as participant observation, key informant interviews (n= 122), and rapid rural appraisals. The research objectives are to understand the current waste management system, understand how implementing composting affects the waste management system entails, understand the barriers to implementation, understand the implications: impact of implementation, potential, and finally to propose recommendations on how to implement composting. The research identified seven necessary key factors that if not given sufficient attention could potentially jeopardize the successful implementation and operation of composting: governmental support must be present, funds must be made available since operating cost of the waste management system will increase, best practices for composting must be established, training for waste workers must be provided, a market (or end use) for the final product must be established, NIMBY needs to be addressed, source separation should be applied...|$|E
40|$|Environmental {{education}} {{can play a}} major role in achieving sustainability. In the context of this research, environmental education is defined as a process to impart and instil knowledge, skills, attitudes, motivations and commitment among the population to work towards environmental solutions, problem prevention and to live sustainably. This research focussed on non-formal environmental education with adults in communities in Sabah, Malaysia. In Sabah, solid waste is a significant problem, and oil palm plantations are one of the main agricultural activities that produce solid agricultural waste or by-products in rural areas. This research focussed on co-constructing an environmental education programme for waste management with villagers, including the independent oil palm smallholders, in local communities in Beaufort, Sabah. This research has elements of both interpretivism and a critical theory approach. It has elements of interpretivism because of the interaction with the local communities to obtain their views and perceptions on waste management practices in their own areas. It was also partially aligned with the critical theory paradigm because it sought to create positive changes among the communities in terms of waste management practices by providing an avenue for discussions, creating empowerment and collaboration. The theoretical principles of community environmental education drawn from the areas of community education and environmental education guided the framing of the research design. Data were collected in two stages. Stage one involved interviews with government officers, a community survey and a focus workshop with two rural communities. This data combined with the theoretical principles of community environmental education guided a co-construction of an educational programme on waste management for the two communities. Stage two involved the programme implementation, and an evaluation process which included a survey, interviews and observation. All closed and scale questions in both surveys were analysed quantitatively. The open-ended data gathered from the questionnaires, interviews, focus workshop and observation were analysed using thematic analysis. This study found that the communities had a genuine concern for the environment and a desire to improve their waste management practices. However, they did not seem to know how to do so, and their knowledge of environmental and waste management issues seemed low. An attitude-behaviour gap in which favourable environmental attitudes were not matched by environmentally-friendly behaviours was also observed. The community members were unaware or uncertain about guidelines that might guide their waste management. It was also reported there was a lack of environmentally-friendly options such as waste <b>disposal</b> <b>and</b> <b>recovery</b> facilities and services, as well as alternatives for proper disposal in their villages. Change in attitudes and behaviour among the community seemed slow to progress, and it was found that changes in waste management practices at a personal level were easier to effect, rather than as a community. The findings of this research indicated a tendency towards pro-environmental behaviour motivated by goals other than environmental; in this case, monetary gains or incentives. The evidence in this research showed that it was possible to co-construct an environmental education programme with local communities. The programme was co-constructed and implemented based on the literature and data on the perceptions, needs and current situation of community waste management through the perspectives of the government officers and local communities. There was clear evidence that the programme made a difference in a short-term; however, long-term outcomes of the programme were not apparent. This study has shown that a model developed from theoretical principles of community environmental education provided useful guidance in practice but that implementation of the model in local contexts has many constraints that need to be considered...|$|E
40|$|The {{production}} of paddy in Malaysia is around 2, 2 million metric tones which rice husk represents 20 % of the weight. Rice mills usually dispose the rice husk through open burning. With the cost increment of fossilized fuel, rice husk {{would have the}} potential to be a cheap source of renewable energy, In addition, rice husk ashes also contained a high content of silica, an important raw material for industries. Previous studies on the fluidized bed technology have shown its potential in waste <b>disposal,</b> <b>and</b> energy <b>recovery</b> from biomass. Spouted bed offers several advantages in comparison with the bubbling fluidized bed such as a better solid mixing and low-pressure drop to maintain the bed fluidization. With the low bulk density of rice husk (100 kgm(- 3)) compared to inert bed material and having a high content of volatile matter (64 %), most of rice husk burn in the freeboard region. It is important to burn the husk in the bed to maintain the bed temperature. Mixing study conducted has shown the preferred sand size in the range of 600 - 800 um with the operating bed height of 1 - 1. 15 Dc. Air velocity of 2 - 3 Ums was not feasible due to the nature of the husk. With conventional spouted bed, circulation of particles slowed down at the dense phase of the bed. With a draft tube, it was seen to improve circulation and burning. This paper reports the difference of rice husk combustion with and without the draft tube in a spouted bed combustor...|$|R

40|$|In the United States an {{estimated}} 140, 000 Class II wells for salt water <b>disposal</b> <b>and</b> enhanced hydrocarbon <b>recovery</b> are presently injecting some 30 {{million barrels of}} brine per day into subsurface formations. While no systematic survey has documented the extent of shallow ground water contamination from these disposal practices, it is recognized as a major potential pollution source in leading hydrocarbon-producing states. The reliability of impact assessment calculations required under Underground Injection Control permit regulations for Class II wells can be improved by the correct application of existing techniques in predicting individual system operational performance. Modifications {{to some of these}} technical indicators include: (a) estimates of radius of endangering influence that require observed initial hydrostatic heads and aquifer hydraulic transmitting properties for the injection interval; and (b) the geochemical characterization of nearby suspected shallow ground water contamination using all major ion concentrations in a trilinear diagram, instead of using only chloride as a brine tracer. A field application demonstrates the relative importance of these and other techniques in characterizing shallow ground water contamination from a salt water disposal well in Oklahoma. Proc. Okla.
