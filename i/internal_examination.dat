Dworkin testified that the doctors in the House of Detention gave her an <b>internal</b> <b>examination</b> which was so rough that she bled for days afterwards. She spoke in public and testified before a grand jury about her experience, and the media {{coverage}} of her testimony made national and international news. The grand jury declined to make an indictment in the case, but Dworkin's testimony contributed to public outrage over the mistreatment of inmates. The prison was closed seven years later.|$|E
5|$|Archaeologist Don Brothwell {{considers}} {{that many of}} the older bodies need re-examining with modern techniques, such as those used in the analysis of Lindow Man. The study of bog bodies, including these found in Lindow Moss, has contributed to a wider understanding of well-preserved human remains, helping to develop new methods in analysis and investigation. The use of sophisticated techniques, such as computer tomography (CT) scans, has marked the investigation of the Lindow bodies as particularly important. Such scans allow the reconstruction of the body and <b>internal</b> <b>examination.</b> Of the 27bodies recovered from lowland raised mires in England and Wales, only those from Lindow Moss and the remains of Worsley Man have survived, together with a shoe from another body. The remains have a date range from the early 1st to the 4thcenturies. Investigation into the other bodies relies on contemporary descriptions of the discovery.|$|E

40|$|Background: This {{pilot study}} {{compared}} performance of University of Calgary students on <b>internal</b> clerkship <b>examinations</b> with corresponding National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) subject examinations. Methods: Between April and October 2007, students completed internal and NBME subject examinations following six mandatory rotations. Local faculty within each discipline set the minimum performance level (MPL) for <b>internal</b> <b>examinations.</b> Two methods of standard setting were considered for NBME exams and a sensitivity analysis was performed. Corresponding <b>internal</b> and NBME <b>examination</b> scores were compared using McNemar’s discordant pair analysis. Results: A significant and unexpected difference in failure rate between <b>internal</b> and external <b>examinations</b> {{was found in}} all clerkships. 1. 4 % of students were below the MPL for <b>internal</b> <b>examinations</b> and 27. 3 % (modified Angoff) or 25. 9 % (mean Hofstee compromise) (p < 0. 001 for both) for the NBME. The proportion of students below MPL for <b>internal</b> <b>examinations</b> was also below the lower limit of the Hofstee compromise (14. 4 %). Conclusion: Possible explanations include leniency bias in internal standard setting, discrepant content validity between local curriculum and NBME examinations, difference in student perception of examinations, an...|$|R
25|$|The {{complete}} {{physical examination}} of the rhinoplasty patient determines {{if he or she}} is physically fit to undergo and tolerate the physiologic stresses of nose surgery. The examination comprehends every existing physical problem, and a consultation with an anaesthesiologist, if warranted by the patient's medical data. Specific facial and nasal evaluations record the patient's skin-type, existing surgical scars, and the symmetry and asymmetry of the aesthetic nasal subunits. The external and internal nasal examination concentrates upon the anatomic thirds of the nose—upper section, middle section, lower section—specifically noting their structures; the measures of the nasal angles (at which the external nose projects from the face); and the physical characteristics of the naso-facial bony and soft tissues. The <b>internal</b> <b>examination</b> evaluates the condition of the nasal septum, the internal and external nasal valves, the turbinates, and the nasal lining, paying special attention to the structure and the form of the nasal dorsum and the tip of the nose.|$|E
