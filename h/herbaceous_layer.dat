25|$|A savanna or savannah {{is a mixed}} {{woodland}} grassland ecosystem characterised by the trees being sufficiently widely spaced so that the canopy does not close. The open canopy allows sufficient light to reach the ground to support an unbroken <b>herbaceous</b> <b>layer</b> consisting primarily of grasses.|$|E
25|$|These {{fires are}} usually {{confined}} to the <b>herbaceous</b> <b>layer</b> and do little long term damage to mature trees. However, these fires either kill or suppress tree seedlings, thus preventing {{the establishment of a}} continuous tree canopy which would prevent further grass growth. Prior to European settlement aboriginal land use practices, including fire, influenced vegetation and may have maintained and modified savanna flora. It has been suggested by many authors that aboriginal burning created a structurally more open savanna landscape. Aboriginal burning certainly created a habitat mosaic that probably increased biodiversity and changed the structure of woodlands and geographic range of numerous woodland species. It has been suggested by many authors that with the removal or alteration of traditional burning regimes many savannas are being replaced by forest and shrub thickets with little <b>herbaceous</b> <b>layer.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{closed forest}} types such as {{broadleaf}} forests and rainforests {{are usually not}} grazed owing to the closed structure precluding grass growth, and hence offering little opportunity for grazing. In contrast the open structure of savannas allows {{the growth of a}} <b>herbaceous</b> <b>layer</b> and are commonly used for grazing domestic livestock. As a result, much of the world's savannas have undergone change as a result of grazing by sheep, goats and cattle, ranging from changes in pasture composition to woody weed encroachment.|$|E

500|$|Ravines {{within the}} Pine Bush contain mixed forests of pine-northern {{hardwoods}} and Appalachian oak-pine. The pine-hardwood forests {{are dominated by}} species such as white pine and yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis), mixed with scattered red maple, a shrub layer dominated by witch-hazel (Hamamelis virginiana), and a <b>herbaceous</b> <b>layer</b> composed {{of a variety of}} herbs, mosses, and lichens. The Appalachian oak-pine forest has a tree canopy of one or more oak species, primarily black oak, white oak, and red oak (Quercus velutina, Quercus alba, and Quercus rubra); these are mixed with pitch pine and some white pine, and a shrub layer dominated by heath shrubs, typically blueberries and black huckleberry. Marshes and wetlands occur along the northern boundary of the Pine Bush and along the bottoms of ravines.

2500|$|Mulga scrub is {{distinctive}} and widespread, with the Mulga Lands of eastern Australia {{defined as a}} specific bioregion. The dominant species in these woodlands is mulga, with poplar box (Eucalyptus populnea) forming an increasingly important codominant in the eastern districts. [...] The extent of ground cover in mulga woodlands varies with canopy density of the overstorey, becoming almost nonexistent in extremely dense stands. In more open stands, the <b>herbaceous</b> <b>layer</b> consists of wire grasses (Aristida spp.), mulga oats (Monocather sp.), mulga mitchell (Thyridolepis sp.), wanderrie (Eriachne spp.), finger grasses (Digitaria spp.) and love grasses (Eragrostis spp.). [...] Various other woody species are also significant in mulga woodlands, particularly hop bushes (Dodonaea spp.), Eremophila and cassia (Senna [...] spp.).|$|E
2500|$|Some {{northern}} hardwoods {{manage to}} survive amidst the spruce–fir ecosystem, namely yellow birch, American mountain ash, and pin cherry, {{the latter being}} especially common in areas damaged by fire.

[...] The spruce–fir <b>herbaceous</b> <b>layer</b> contains ferns such as the mountain wood fern, northern lady fern, and clubmoss, and over 280 species of mosses. [...] Wildflowers include Canada mayflower, blue-bead lily, and mountain wood-sorrel.

40|$|Structure and {{development}} of vegetation has reflected the biological value of the habitat, for vegetation responds to changes in habitat readily; and habitat, in turn, is determined, in its gross characteristics, by climate. However, a uniform climate does not exist even in a small geographical area because the area is modified by peculiar features of soil and physiography. The variety of habitats, e. g., in dissected land surfaces, is {{in direct proportion to}} these modifications of the macroclimate. Such features, while perhaps not affecting the arboreal cover, will determine different accents of the secondary and <b>herbaceous</b> <b>layers</b> as pointed out by Friesner and Potzger...|$|R

Twenty-four permanent plots were installed to monitor fuel loads, overstory, sapling, seedling, shrub and <b>herbaceous</b> <b>layers</b> within bum and control units of Mission Tejas, Tyler and Village Creek state parks. Measurements were taken during the summers of 1999 and 2000. Prescribed burning was conducted between these sampling periods in early spring 2 ooo.

40|$|The {{long-term}} {{conservation of}} viable ecosystems requires a broader {{understanding of the}} ecological processes involved. Because ecosystems react differently to different management practices, {{it is important to}} have a description and classification of the vegetation of an area available.

Ahierarchical classification, vegetation map, description and ecological interpretation of the plant communities of the study area are presented. ATWINSPAN classification, refined by Braun-Blanquet procedures revealed eight distinct plant communities.

30|$|Prescribed fire, cutting, and cutting-fire {{combinations}} {{have been}} {{commonly used to}} control western juniper and restore sagebrush steppe and other plant communities (Bates et al. 2005, 2006, 2011; Coultrap et al. 2008) and reduce wildland fuel loading (Stebleton and Bunting 2009, O’Connor et al. 2013). Late successional woodlands are often treated mechanically because fuel deficiencies (shrub and <b>herbaceous</b> <b>layers)</b> make prescribed burning problematic. Late successional woodlands, termed Phase 3 woodlands, are tree dominated, with shrubs largely eliminated and herbaceous productivity reduced (Miller et al. 2005). In the past, mechanically killed trees were left on site; however, downed trees present a significant fire hazard. Thus, felled trees are commonly burned in place, piled and burned, or used to augment broadcast burning of large areas (Bates et al. 2006, 2013; Bates and Svejcar 2009; O’Connor et al. 2013).|$|R
30|$|Fire {{influences}} {{the structure and}} composition of savanna and woodland ecosystems worldwide (e.g., Higgins et al. 2000, Peterson and Reich 2001, Hoffmann and Solbrig 2003, Bond and Keeley 2005). Past {{research has focused on}} potential mechanisms dictating the distribution and structure of woody and herbaceous vegetation in these ecosystems, most notably, fire (Scholes and Archer 1997, Hoffman 1999, Beckage et al. 2009). Where fire is excluded from woodlands and savannas, substantial changes occur (Grossmann and Mladendoff 2007, Hiers et al. 2007, Peterson et al. 2007). Frequently, increases in woody stem densities and advancement of forest boundaries lead to shading of <b>herbaceous</b> <b>layers</b> (Hoffman et al. 2003, Devine et al. 2007) and development of organic forest floor horizons (Varner et al. 2005, Hiers et al. 2007), two processes that not only threaten biodiversity but alter fuel structure and characteristics of fire regimes.|$|R

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of prescribed fire restoration of forested sites in three state parks in east Texas, USA was studied.

40|$|In Europe, the Bechstein's bat Myotis bechsteinii is a {{rare species}} of large old-growth {{deciduous}} woodlands. The only colony recorded in Limousin - in the north-west of the Massif Central, France - is however located in a mixed landscape where woodlands are young and very fragmented. In spite of this a priori unsuitable environment, close monitoring of the colony has shown an increase of its size by 110 % from 2000 to 2005. In an attempt to explain this apparent contradiction, habitat and prey selection were studied between May and August 2004. Ten bats were radiotracked, and faeces analysed to investigate the diet of the colony. The results confirm the association of the Bechstein's bat with woodlands, and show a positive selection of gaps created by the 1999 storm. These gaps have well-developed shrub and <b>herbaceous</b> <b>layers</b> with high insect abundance and diversity.
