5000|$|Erich Hilgenfeldt, {{who worked}} as office head at the NSV, {{organized}} a charity drive to celebrate Hitler's Birthday on April 20, 1931. Following this move Joseph Goebbels named him {{the leader of the}} NSV. The NSV became established as the single Nazi Party welfare organ in May 1933. On 21 September in the same year Hilgenfeldt was appointed as Reich Commissioner for the Winterhilfswerk (Winter Support Programme). Under Hilgenfeldt the programme was massively expanded, so that the régime deemed it worthy to be called the [...] "greatest social institution in the world." [...] One method of expansion was to absorb, or in NSDAP parlance coordinate, already existing but non-Nazi charity organizations. In 1933 Hitler decreed the banning of all private charity organizations in Germany, ordering NSV chairman Erich Hilgenfeldt to “see to the disbanding of all private welfare institutions,” which provided the National Socialists the means to engage in the social engineering of society through the selection of who could receive government benefits. Hitler had essentially nationalized local municipalities, German federal states and private <b>delivery</b> <b>structures</b> that had provided welfare services to the public.

As a result, there are many multicast routing protocols based on multicast <b>delivery</b> <b>structure</b> in mobile ad hoc networks. In order to improve cross-layer optimization, we propose a collision free multiple access scheme by combining RTS/CTS with scheduling algorithms to support the multicast routing protocol. The benefit of proposed scheme, such as power saving, reliable data transmission and higher channel utilization compared with CSMA or multiple unicast, enables the efficient support of multicast services in mobile ad hoc networks.

40|$|AbstractTwice-yearly {{child health}} weeks are an {{effective}} way of reaching children with essential child survival services in developing countries. In Kenya, child health weeks, or Malezi Bora, were restructured in 2007 from an outreach-based <b>delivery</b> <b>structure</b> to a health facility-based <b>delivery</b> <b>structure</b> to reduce <b>delivery</b> costs and increase sustainability of the events. Administrative data from 2007 to 2011 have demonstrated a decrease in coverage of Malezi Bora services to targeted children. A post-event coverage (PEC) survey was conducted after the May 2012 Malezi Bora to validate coverage of vitamin A supplementation (VAS) and deworming and to inform program strategy. Nine hundred caregivers with children aged 6 – 59 months were interviewed using a randomized, 30 × 30 cluster design. For each cluster, one facility-based health worker and one community-based health worker were also interviewed. Coverage of VAS was 31. 0 % among children aged 6 – 59 months and coverage of deworming was 19. 6 % among children aged 12 – 59 months. Coverage of VAS was significantly higher for children aged 6 – 11 months (45. 7 %, n= 116) than for children aged 12 – 59 months (28. 8 %, n= 772) (p< 0. 01). Eighty-five percent (51 / 60) of health workers reported that Malezi Bora was implemented in their area while 23. 6 % of primary caregivers reported that Malezi Bora occurred in their area. The results of this PEC survey indicate that the existing Malezi Bora programmatic structure needs to be reviewed and reformed to meet WHO guidelines of 80 % coverage with VAS...|$|R

The asynchronous, one-to-many and many-to-many interaction model promoted by event-based systems, renders them particularly suitable for supporting interconnections among loosely-coupled compo-nents. Nevertheless, ubiquitous event systems have to face an increasing number of requirements, e. g., scalability, autonomy and timeliness. To this end, we present a distributed and self-configured event notification system that organises dynamically the nodes into a cluster-based <b>delivery</b> <b>structure.</b> This event notification system is grounded over an hybrid grouping model that handles differences in network topology and perform well under a wide range of conditions...|$|R

The fabricated configurations were characterised by optical microscopy and SEM to evaluate surface morphology. The results clearly demonstrate the successful encapsulation of dexamethasone within a laminated PLGA:PVA structure. The resulting drug release profiles from the structures show a two stage release profile with distinctly different release rates and minimal initial burst release observed. Dexamethasone release was monitored over a 4 -month period. This approach clearly demonstrates that the extrusion printing technique provides a facile and versatile approach to fabrication of novel drug delivery platforms...|$|E
