25|$|Kawasaki began {{design work}} on the Ki-88 in August 1942. The Ki-88 {{was to have a}} 1,117-kW (1,500-hp) Kawasaki Ha-140 engine behind its cockpit, driving a tractor {{propeller}} through an <b>extension</b> <b>shaft.</b> It was to mount a 37-mm cannon in its propeller shaft and two 20-mm cannon in its lower nose.|$|E
25|$|The {{construction}} {{of the first two}} prototypes started in earnest by June 1944, stress calculations were finished by January 1945, and the first prototype was completed in April 1945. The 2,130hp Mitsubishi MK9D (Ha-43) radial engine and its supercharger were installed behind the cockpit and drove a six-bladed propeller via an <b>extension</b> <b>shaft.</b> Engine cooling was to be provided by long, narrow, obliquely mounted intakes {{on the side of the}} fuselage. It was this configuration that caused cooling problems while running the engine while it was still on the ground. This, together with the unavailability of some equipment parts postponed the first flight of the Shinden.|$|E

500|$|The VRDK was a motorjet, a {{rudimentary}} type of jet engine where an external power source drove the engine's compressor. It forced {{air into the}} stainless steel combustion chamber where fuel was sprayed from seven nozzles and ignited to exhaust out the variable rear nozzle. In the I-250 a [...] Klimov VK-107R V-12 piston engine {{was used as the}} primary powerplant. After takeoff a clutch {{at the end of the}} crankshaft could be engaged which drove a step up gearbox with a ratio of 13:21 to an <b>extension</b> <b>shaft</b> that powered the compressor of the VRDK. The air for the compressor was fed through a long duct that ran from the inlet underneath the propeller spinner, thence under the engine and through the belly of the aircraft. This duct also fed air to the oil cooler near the engine, but the water radiator was positioned behind the compressor to maximize airflow over it. A secondary duct led from the main duct to the VK-107's supercharger; when the VRDK was running the secondary duct diverted some of that additional air to the supercharger which boosted the engine's output to [...] at [...] The increased airflow over the engine radiator helped to dump the engine's excess heat into the exhaust stream. However the VRDK was limited to only ten minutes' operating time per sortie, which meant that it was useless weight during the rest of the flight.|$|E
2500|$|The {{aircraft}} is {{made from}} riveted aluminum sheet. Its [...] span wing is mounted well behind the pilot and employs a NASA GA(PC)-1 airfoil. The engine is mounted behind the pilot's seat driving the propeller through an <b>extension</b> <b>shaft.</b> Engines used include the [...] Volkswagen air-cooled engine four-stroke.|$|E
2500|$|Because {{the pilot}} was above the <b>extension</b> <b>shaft,</b> he was placed higher in the {{fuselage}} than in most contemporary fighters, which, in turn gave the pilot a good field of view. Access to the cockpit was via sideways opening [...] "car doors", one on either side. Both had wind-down windows. As only the right-hand door had a handle {{both inside and outside}} this was used as the normal means of access and egress. The left-hand door could be opened only from the outside and was for emergency use, although both doors could be jettisoned. In operational use, as the roof was fixed, the cockpit design made escape difficult in an emergency.|$|E

50|$|The T38-A-1 power {{sections}} each contained 17-stage compressors {{giving a}} pressure ratio of 6.3:1, eight combustion chambers, and four-stage turbines. A combining reduction gearbox was driven via <b>extension</b> <b>shafts</b> {{from the power}} sections. Each transmission shaft incorporated a clutch to allow the power sections to be run independently.|$|R
50|$|It was {{proposed}} that the Fa 269 would adopt a high angle of attack when at rest using extremely long undercarriage units. For vertical take-off, the rotors would be lowered till their plane of rotation was parallel with the ground. For translation to conventional flight following take-off, the <b>extension</b> <b>shafts</b> were to pivot to the rear, the rotors then behaving as pusher propellers.|$|R
2500|$|The XF-84H {{was created}} by modifying a F-84F airframe, {{installing}} a [...] Allison XT40-A-1 turboprop engine in a centrally-located housing behind the cockpit with a long <b>extension</b> <b>shaft</b> to the nose-mounted propeller. The turbine engine also provided thrust through its exhaust; an afterburner which could further increase power to , was installed but never used. Thrust was adjusted by changing the blade pitch of the -diameter Aeroproducts propeller, consisting of three steel, square-tipped blades turning at a constant speed, with the tips traveling at approximately [...] To counter the propeller's torque and [...] "P-factor", the XF-84H was fitted with a fixed dorsal yaw vane. The tail was changed to a T-tail to avoid turbulent airflow flow over the horizontal stabilizer/elevator surfaces from propeller wash.|$|E

50|$|A mid-wing monoplane, the Fa 269 was to {{have been}} powered by a single BMW 801 {{air-cooled}} radial engine buried in the fuselage behind the cockpit, which {{was to have}} driven transverse drive shafts in the leading edges of the fixed wing, the shafts turning three-bladed rotors via synchronised gearboxes.

The military models were V-1710-9, -13, -23, and -41, producing [...] at 2600 rpm. Supercharger ratios were 6.23:1, 8.0:1 or 8.77:1, depending on altitude rating. These engines had the compression ratio increased to 6.65:1. Marvel MC-12 fuel injection, which was unsatisfactory and quickly replaced by a float-type carburetor on -9 and -13 models. Later dash number engines used Bendix pressure carburetors. These engines were being designed {{at the same time}} as the V-3420 engine, and shared many assemblies as they were developed.

5000|$|... "E" [...] series engines were {{designed}} for remote gearbox applications using crankshaft-speed <b>extension</b> <b>shafts</b> and remote 1.8:1 gearboxes with SAE #60 hollow propeller shafts.

Supercharger gear ratios were: 6.44:1, 7.48:1, 8.10:1, 8.80:1 and 9.6:1 depending on altitude rating. These engines were a complete redesign, and did not share many components with the earlier engine series. Almost all components were interchangeable with later series engines and the V-3420, and could be assembled as right hand or left hand turning engines in either pusher or tractor applications.|$|R
2500|$|When the new [...] Benz VI engine became available, {{early in}} 1918, Aviatik (Automobil und Aviatik A.G.) at Leipzig-Heiterblick were tasked with {{integrating}} the new more powerful engine into the R.VI airframe {{due to the}} commitments of the Zeppelin-Staaken factory and Aviatiks experience in building the R.VI under licence. The new engines were installed in the nose positions of the nacelles driving tractor propellers, with 220 hp (164 KW) Benz BzIV engines in the rear positions driving pusher propellers via <b>extension</b> <b>shafts.</b> Three R.XVI (Av)s were built; R 49 was completed in October 1918 but damaged its landing gear during a test flight, evidence that repairs were carried out is not available.

40|$|Based upon {{analysis}} of spatial patterns along east-west and south-north <b>extension</b> <b>shafts</b> in Beijing City, China, the distribution rationality of emergency shelters was evaluated with gradient analysis {{as well as}} landscape index. The results showed that (1) the landscape index method can represent the overall distributional pattern of emergency shelters and its rationality; (2) emergency shelters in the city were generally highly fragmented, but had good connectivity and also had strong edge effects; (3) from the city center to the edges, emergency hedge place coverage did not vary with the change of distance between the shelter and the city center, while small patch quantity ratio, patch quantity, shape index, fragmentation degree and Euclidean nearest neighbor distance were subject to obvious gradient changes; (4) the main factor that influenced the coverage of emergency shelter {{and the distribution of}} patch areas and frequency was the distribution of large-scale patch of park nature. For cities with basically completed emergency hedge place system, under the limitation of area and coverage improvement, the rationality of space structure of the existing emergency shelters can be evaluated through the joint application of gradient analysis and landscape index. These parameters efficiently serve the adjustment and improvement of emergency shelters...|$|R

The tooth cone constitutes the outer conical covering and inner lining of the anterior half of the stylet lumen.
