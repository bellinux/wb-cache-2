5|$|A {{rangefinder}} {{was installed}} on the bridge and her <b>fore</b> <b>and</b> <b>aft</b> holds were refitted as magazines. Half-inch (12.7mm) steel plating was added to protect her steering gear and her interior cabin bulkheads and glass ventilators were removed to reduce damage from splinters. Her furniture was removed {{to make room for}} the mess decks needed to feed large numbers of troops and sailors and an operating room and sickbay were installed amidships.|$|E
5|$|Canada was {{transferred}} to the 1st Battle Squadron on 12 June 1916. In 1917–18, she was fitted with better rangefinders and range dials, and two of the aft 6-inch secondary guns were removed after they suffered blast damage from the middle 14-inch turret. In the latter year, flying-off platforms for aircraft were added atop the superfiring turrets <b>fore</b> <b>and</b> <b>aft.</b> Canada was put into the reserve fleet in March 1919.|$|E
5|$|Pre-dreadnoughts carried guns {{of several}} {{different}} calibres, for different roles in ship-to-ship combat. The main armament was four heavy guns, mounted in two centre-line turrets <b>fore</b> <b>and</b> <b>aft.</b> Very few pre-dreadnoughts deviated from this arrangement. These guns were slow-firing, and initially of limited accuracy; {{but they were}} the only guns heavy enough to penetrate the thick armour which protected the engines, magazines, and main guns of enemy battleships.|$|E
