25|$|The {{pioneer of}} {{lacrosse}} in Victoria (and Australia as a whole) was a Canadian, Lambton L. Mount. He {{came to the}} Victorian goldfields as a fourteen-year-old {{with his family in}} 1853 {{but it was not until}} 1875 that he was moved to revive his early boyhood memories of lacrosse. After watching the football final between Carlton and Melbourne in that year <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> lacrosse was a superior game.|$|E
25|$|Cameron {{quit his}} job as a truck driver to enter the film {{industry}} after seeing Star Wars in 1977. When Cameron read Syd Field's book Screenplay, <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> integrating science and art was possible, and he wrote a 10-minute science-fiction script with two friends, titled Xenogenesis. They raised money, rented camera, lenses, film stock and studio then shot it in 35mm. They dismantled the camera to understand how to operate it and spent the first half-day of the shoot {{trying to figure out how}} to get it running.|$|E
25|$|In 2006 California {{attorney}} and Marshall Islands lobbyist Howard Hills, and Tony Sanchez, a former {{administrator of the}} Guam Superior Court, were indicted for unlawful influence, conspiracy for unlawful influence, theft of property held in trust, and official misconduct for allegedly authorizing 36 payments of $9,000 vis a vis a pre-existing contract between Hills and the Guam Superior Court, each written out to Hills, but funneled to Abramoff. Hills, trusting Sanchez as a court official at face value, assumed {{that this was a}} temporary circumstance and agreed to help facilitate transition for {{what he thought was a}} standard government contract between Abramoff and the court. For this Hills received no compensation. Before indictments or investigations were initiated, Hills halted his temporary contract with Abramoff and reported what he thought was potentially suspicious behavior to public officials when <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> something may be wrong. In 2007, superseding indictments were issued against Hills and Sanchez, and in 2008 further related indictments were handed down against Abramoff and Abramoff's firm at the time, Greenberg Traurig. The charges against both attorney Howard Hills and Greenberg Traurig have since been dismissed.|$|E

60|$|Then he {{went upstairs}} to his wife {{with a cup of}} tea because she was ill, and because <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
60|$|Clement {{had paid}} very little {{attention}} to the man and his troubles, but as he looked down the street at the crowd around the speakers on the corner <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> wonder if they were the fighting evangelists.|$|R
25|$|During a June 2, 1875, {{experiment}} by Bell and {{his assistant}} Thomas Watson, a receiver reed {{failed to respond to}} the intermittent current supplied by an electric battery. Bell told Watson, who was {{at the other end of}} the line, to pluck the reed, thinking it had stuck to the pole of the magnet. Mr. Watson complied, and to his astonishment Bell heard a reed at his end of the line vibrate and emit the same timbre of a plucked reed, although there were no interrupted on-off-on-off currents from a transmitter to make it vibrate. A few more experiments soon showed that his receiver reed had been set in vibration by the magneto-electric currents induced in the line by the motion of the distant receiver reed in the neighborhood of its magnet. The battery current was not causing the vibration but was needed only to supply the magnetic field in which the reeds vibrated. Moreover, when Bell heard the rich overtones of the plucked reed, <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> since the circuit was never broken, all the complex vibrations of speech might be converted into undulating (modulated) currents, which in turn would reproduce the complex timbre, amplitude, and frequencies of speech at a distance.|$|E
2500|$|According to Adams, {{the idea}} for the title {{occurred}} to him while he lay drunk in a field in Innsbruck, Austria, gazing at the stars. He was carrying a copy of the Hitch-hiker's Guide to Europe, and <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> [...] "somebody ought to write a Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy". He later said that the constant repetition of this anecdote had obliterated his memory of the actual event.|$|E
2500|$|Laird {{recalled}} that {{the publication of}} the first issue of his and Eastman's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles comic came about thanks to a loan the two secured from Quentin Eastman, Kevin's uncle. Although the two were able to pay him back swiftly, it led Laird to speculate about what could have been: [...] "if we hadn't gotten that loan from him at that point in our lives, it might have taken us a couple more months to raise that money from other sources, and who knows what might have happened differently {{as a result of that}} delay?" [...] <b>It</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> [...] "there must be so many times where a self-publishing venture can sink or float on the strength of" [...] a relatively small amount of money, so he felt a desire to use some of his [...] "good fortune, in the financial sense, to help people out" [...] (and, in addition to the creators, the Foundation also aids those [...] "involved in charitable organizations").|$|E
6000|$|... "That's a pure accident. He {{was brought}} up to the baking business, and <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> try his hand at these, which he can make without coming out of doors. We call them Christminster cakes. They are a great success." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{laughed at}} <b>him.</b> <b>It</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> suddenly, {{with a little}} pang, {{that he had never}} heard her laugh before. It was like music.|$|R
60|$|Bulan, startled at the question, {{looked up}} from his reverie. The thing must be faced, then, sooner than he thought. How was he to tell her of his intention? <b>It</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> sound her first--possibly she would make no {{objection}} to the plan.|$|R
2500|$|According to Schafer, {{he came up}} {{with the}} idea for Full Throttle while {{listening}} to a traveller's tales about time spent in an Alaskan biker bar. As he listened, <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> [...] "bikers are kind of like pirates â€” like another culture that people don't have a window into most of the time, but [...] has its own rules", and might provide a neat alternative to a fantasy setting. So he began his research into biker culture, reading Hunter S. Thompson's [...] The game originally would have featured an interactive sequence where Ben undergoes a peyote-induced hallucinogenic trip. This was eventually cut from the game, because the developers couldn't get it to [...] "work out" [...] with the publisher. The concept eventually became the basis of Psychonauts. Schafer recalls the reaction from the management at LucasArts as being one of [...] "'We can't believe we paid you to write this.'" [...] "They hated it" [...] he stated. In an interview with Gamasutra, Shafer stated that the biker aesthetics of the game were an appeal to fantasy. He stated the team was depending [...] "on the [...] secret desire to be a biker: big, tough, cool. Riding a huge hog..." [...] On the game's setting he noted that often it was mistaken for a post apocalyptic world, however he clarified that the setting was simply an alternate world which was more desolate than our own. [...] "It was never meant to be post-war or anything like that." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> {{it would}} {{save a lot of}} trouble to destroy the {{advertisement}} there and then.|$|E
60|$|She laughed softly. <b>It</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> {{nothing like}} her laugh {{had ever been}} heard on that gray-walled stretch of {{mountain}} road.|$|E
60|$|He {{never looked}} upon me as {{anything}} but a friend. I don't suppose <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> for an instant that my feeling might possibly be different.|$|R
60|$|Brisbane, {{after leaving}} Streeter that day, {{went home to}} dinner with an awakened curiosity {{to know more about}} this young man in whom the {{department}} had such confidence. Lawson was dining at his table that night, and <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> ask a little more fully about Curtis.|$|R
60|$|Parkson's lodgings {{were now}} near at {{hand to the}} left, and <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> this boredom would be soonest ended if he took Parkson home, Parkson consented mechanically, still discoursing.|$|R
60|$|He {{turned on}} his heel. A row was impossible. <b>It</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> {{a man of the}} world would face such a {{position}} calmly.|$|E
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> it was {{unnecessary}} to explain. He assisted {{me into a}} sitting position, and I could see with my own eyes.|$|E
60|$|Sir Charles did not reply. <b>It</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> Lady Brandon's portrait, {{if nothing}} else were left of her, might be useful in the same way.|$|E
6000|$|... "I doubt I {{might be}} the better," [...] <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> [...] "if I brushed my hair, and smelt a little of perfume. Yes. I'll make a toilet. Where's the boy's bedroom, I wonder?" ...|$|R
6000|$|An Editor who {{was always}} vaunting the purity, enterprise, and fearlessness of his paper was pained to observe that he got no subscribers. One day <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> stop saying that his paper was pure and enterprising and fearless, and make it so. [...] "If these are not good qualities," [...] he reasoned, [...] "it is folly to claim them." ...|$|R
60|$|Mr Milvey smiled again, as {{he remarked}} to himself 'Those {{kings and queens}} were always wishing for children.' <b>It</b> <b>occurring</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> perhaps, {{that if they had}} been Curates, their wishes might have tended in the {{opposite}} direction.|$|R
60|$|Colonel Bishop started up. He was pervaded by {{the first}} pang of uneasiness. <b>It</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> all here {{might not be as}} {{friendly}} as appeared.|$|E
60|$|He saw a clerk {{peering at}} him from the office, and {{suddenly}} <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> the place might get back at him tremendously over the bill.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{not at all}} well," [...] said Morris; and <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that,</b> if {{he could}} only make her pity him enough, he might get off.|$|E
6000|$|<b>It</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> {{suddenly}} {{that he had}} forgotten larches. They, of course, could be heavenly, when you lay under them {{and looked up at}} the sky, as he had that afternoon out there. Then he heard her say: ...|$|R
6000|$|After the lapse {{of about}} ten seconds <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> stand and wave his new bowler hat at {{her over the}} corner of the bus top, and to shout hoarsely, [...] "Goo-bye, Ann! Don' forget me--while I'm away!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What's {{the social}} {{position}} of Mrs. Steuben?" [...] <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> ask while he meditated. He had an earnest artless literal {{way of putting}} such a question as that; you could see from it {{that he was very}} thorough.|$|R
60|$|Here <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> he {{was telling}} his story without that {{attention}} to polite phraseology which a master expects from a boy, so he amended the last sentence.|$|E
6000|$|... "Eh?" [...] There {{was nothing}} Ercole relished less {{than to be}} laughed at. He pondered a moment, and <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> perhaps he was making much of nothing. Then: ...|$|E
60|$|He parted from them, wondering. And it was {{not until}} he had reached the parish house that <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> he was as yet unenlightened as to the young man's name....|$|E
6000|$|... "God forbid," [...] she said, so {{promptly}} {{that she}} never learnt he had a wife, even then. <b>It</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> then for the first time, in the flash of her retort, {{that she did not}} know he was married.|$|R
60|$|He {{went up and}} {{examined}} it, {{and found that it}} rested against the ebony and gold panelling, just like any of the other pictures in the gallery. He was puzzled, {{not knowing what to do}} next, until <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> see if the windows would help him, and, looking at the nearest, he saw a picture of himself lifting the picture from the wall.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{exception}} {{is the story of}} a bhikkhu named Godhika, also beset by illness, who had repeatedly attained temporary liberation of mind but was unable to gain final liberation due to illness. While believing himself again in a state of temporary liberation <b>it</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> cut his own throat, in hopes thus to be reborn in a high realm. The Buddha was said to have stated: ...|$|R
