5|$|An {{equivalent}} {{tournament for}} women's football, the FIFA Women's World Cup, was first held in 1991 in China. The women's tournament is smaller in scale and profile than the men's, but is growing; {{the number of}} entrants for the 2007 tournament was 120, more than <b>double</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> 1991.|$|E
5|$|The initial study {{into the}} system {{suggests}} that a second planet in the inner system is unlikely. The discoverers of GJ 3634 b, however, noted the signal of a secondary body of an unknown nature that most likely orbits GJ 3634 every 200 days with a mass that is at most <b>double</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> Neptune.|$|E
5|$|He {{returned}} {{to play for}} Somerset during the summer break once again in 1884, playing four matches for the county, during which he claimed 24 wickets: more than <b>double</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> the next most prolific Somerset bowler, Charles Winter. His best performance came against Hampshire, against whom he claimed six second innings wickets to help Somerset to their only victory of the season.|$|E

50|$|The four part {{organization}} of the book follows the format of its immediate predecessors. More than 3,000 bridge personalities {{are listed in the}} biographies; the 60 page bibliography <b>doubled</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> the previous edition.|$|R
5|$|Kepler-10c orbits {{its host}} star every forty-five {{days at a}} quarter of the average {{distance}} between the Sun and Earth. It has a radius more than <b>double</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> Earth, but a higher density, suggesting a mainly rocky composition with around 5–20% ices by mass. For comparison, the Earth's oceans represent only 0.02% of our planet's mass, with an additional amount potentially a few times this stored in the mantle.|$|E
5|$|Prior to its introduction, {{a target}} of 24,000 annualised sales were {{predicted}} for the Australian market, <b>double</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> the Avalon's eventual sales rate. A further 8,000 vehicles were forecast to be sent abroad to the Middle East and New Zealand. Starting from 2007, Toyota received a contract to deliver 10,000 export Aurions to the Middle East.|$|E
5|$|Tensions between Edward and the barons {{remained}} high, and the earls {{opposed to}} the King kept their personal armies mobilised late into 1311. By now Edward had become estranged from his cousin, the Earl of Lancaster, who held the earldoms of Lancaster, Leicester, Lincoln, Salisbury and Derby, with an income of around £11,000 a year from his lands, almost <b>double</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> the next wealthiest baron. Backed by the earls of Arundel, Gloucester, Hereford, Pembroke and Warwick, Lancaster led a powerful faction in England, {{but he was not}} personally interested in practical administration, nor was he a particularly imaginative or effective politician.|$|E
50|$|Langley is an {{overspill}} estate, {{created in}} the 1950s for Manchester City Council. Families moved into the new housing from the slum clearance areas of Manchester, the eventual population <b>of</b> about 25,000 <b>doubling</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> Middleton.|$|R
5000|$|This {{tour was}} an even greater success than the first one with {{sell-out}} shows in many cities. [...] In total 411,005 tickets were sold, yielding a gross total of $15,977,802 as reported by Billboard, nearly <b>doubling</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> Season 1 tour.|$|R
2500|$|... 1989: A SAG report reveals <b>that</b> 71% <b>of</b> all {{roles in}} feature films and 64% of all roles in TV went to men. The report said the {{combined}} income of men more than <b>doubled</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> women ($644 million to $296 million).|$|R
5|$|The large centre canvas has {{not been}} {{positively}} identified. However both Koch and Campbell believe that a damaged Crucifixion, now in the Musées royaux des Beaux-Arts, Brussels, was probably the centrepiece. Its size (181×153.5cm) is exactly <b>double</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> the four wing panels. Campbell believes that the altarpiece was painted on commission for export, most likely to Venice. The altarpiece was probably broken up as large religious works {{had fallen out of}} fashion by the 17th century, and would have had more value as single panels.|$|E
5|$|The rate of star {{formation}} in the Milky Way is much higher, with Andromeda Galaxy producing only about one solar mass per year compared to 3–5 solar masses for the Milky Way. The rate of supernovae in the Milky Way is also <b>double</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> Andromeda Galaxy. This suggests that the latter once experienced a great {{star formation}} phase, but {{is now in a}} relative state of quiescence, whereas the Milky Way is experiencing more active star formation. Should this continue, the luminosity in the Milky Way may eventually overtake that of Andromeda Galaxy.|$|E
5|$|Thomas {{attended}} Western High School {{for three}} years before entering a U.S. Naval Academy preparatory school. He sought and secured an appointment to Annapolis from President Theodore Roosevelt, and was asked to take the admission examination. The Navy was undergoing a period of expansion, and the intake of midshipmen was <b>double</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> two years earlier. Of the 350 who took the examination, 283 were admitted. The class was the largest since the Academy had opened in 1845.|$|E
50|$|Every year, between 50 and 100 {{people are}} injured during the run. Not {{all of the}} {{injuries}} require taking the patients to the hospital: in 2013, 50 people were taken by ambulance to Pamplona's hospital, with this number nearly <b>doubling</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> 2012.|$|R

5|$|Though Reagan was a {{controversial}} First Lady, 56% of Americans had a favorable opinion of her {{when her husband}} left office on January 20, 1989, with 18percent having an unfavorable opinion, and the balance not giving an opinion. Compared to fellow First Ladies when their husbands left office, Reagan's approval was {{higher than those of}} Rosalynn Carter and Hillary Clinton. However, she was less popular than Barbara Bush, and her disapproval rating was <b>double</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> Carter's.|$|E
5|$|A later report {{covering}} the use the Tallboy bomb {{was able to}} directly compare {{the performance of the}} Mk. XIV and SABS in similar mission profiles. Eliminating bombs that fell far from the target as gross errors, those that fell near the target were twice as close to it when using SABS. Additionally, the number of gross errors with the Mk. XIV was <b>double</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> the SABS. The report noted that this additional accuracy did not confer any sort of superiority because the Mk. XIV's tactical freedom in terms of manoeuvring offset any advantage when a long bomb run was not possible. They also noted that a mission using SABS to drop bombs on a target marker would not be any more accurate than the Mk. XIV.|$|E
5|$|Central Saint Giles {{provides}} 66,090m² {{of floor}} space – almost <b>double</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> the old St Giles Court – split between two separate buildings. The 15-storey west block is for residential use, providing 109 flats of which 53 are designated as affordable. The much larger horseshoe-shaped eastern block, standing 11 storeys high, encircles a publicly accessible courtyard comprising 27% of the site's area. It provides 37,625m² {{of office space}} with {{by far the largest}} floor plates of any office block in the West End of London, with 4,000m² on all but the top two floors. At ground level, 2,276m² of space is available for retail outlets and restaurants. The block is irregularly shaped with recesses, projections and roof terraces intended to make it look more interesting and to break up its bulk.|$|E
30|$|These {{reactions}} {{can occur}} at low temperatures and additionally, {{all of the}} reactions are exothermic reactions. The heat generation from these reactions <b>doubles</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> coal with the same oxygen (Garcia 1999; Martínez et al. 2009). Thus, the presence of pyrite is a big promoter for the spontaneous combustion of coal.|$|R
50|$|The paper {{began with}} {{exactly the same}} format as its rival, Heimskringla. It was 4 pages long, and the {{subscription}} rate was ½ <b>that</b> <b>of</b> Heimskringla. On January 15, 1890 Lögberg increased its size to 8 pages, <b>doubling</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> Heimskringla. A regular women´s interest column, edited by Ingibjorg Jonsson, was introduced in Lögberg in the 1950s.|$|R
50|$|The galaxy has a half-light {{radius of}} ∼, {{making it the}} fourth largest {{satellite}} of the Milky Way. It has an angular size about <b>double</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> the moon.|$|R
5|$|During {{the flight}} test program, unlike the YF-23, weapon firings and high (60°) {{angle of attack}} (AoA, or high-Alpha) flights were carried out on the YF-22. Though not a requirement, the {{aircraft}} fired AIM-9 Sidewinder and AIM-120 AMRAAM missiles from internal weapon bays. Flight testing also demonstrated that the YF-22 with its thrust vectoring nozzles achieved pitch rates more than <b>double</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> the F-16 at low-speed maneuvering. The first prototype, PAV-1, achieved Mach1.58 in supercruise, while PAV-2 reached a maximum supercruise speed of Mach1.43; maximum speed was in excess of Mach 2.0. Flight testing continued until 28December1990, by which time 74 flights were completed and 91.6 airborne hours were accumulated. Following flight testing, the contractor teams submitted proposals for ATF production.|$|E
5|$|In {{its first}} week of release, Late Registration debuted at {{number one on the}} Billboard 200 and sold 860,000 copies in the United States. This was nearly <b>double</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> The College Dropouts first-week sales. It also debuted at number one on the charts in Canada. In the United Kingdom, the album debuted and peaked at number two on the UK Albums Chart for the issue date of September 5. On the Billboard 200, Late Registration {{remained}} at number one for two consecutive weeks and, by its second week, had reached sales of 1.14 million copies. By June 2013, it had sold 3.1 million copies in the US.|$|E
5|$|Oganesson is {{expected}} to have by far the broadest polarizability of all elements before it in the periodic table, almost <b>double</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> radon. By extrapolating from the other noble gases, it {{is expected}} that oganesson has a boiling point between 320 and 380 K. This {{is very different from the}} previously estimated values of 263K or 247 K. Even given the large uncertainties of the calculations, it seems highly unlikely that oganesson would be a gas under standard conditions, and as the liquid range of the other gases is very narrow, between 2 and 9 kelvins, this element should be solid at standard conditions. If oganesson forms a gas under standard conditions nevertheless, it would be one of the densest gaseous substances at standard conditions, even if it is monatomic like the other noble gases.|$|E
50|$|Guaro {{is at an}} {{altitude}} of 354 metres above sea level near the Sierra de Mijas. The land area is 22 square kilometres. Guaro's main economical activities are olive and almond agriculture, along with other traditional irrigated crops, and oddly-enough, as of 2006 the number of women with work contracts <b>doubled</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> men.|$|R
5000|$|ASN-207 is a {{development}} of ASN-206 {{and share the}} identical design layout. ASN-207 adopts new engine and material during its design and construction, enables it to increase its endurance and payload by <b>doubling</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> original, thanks to the rapid advancement China made in the technological and industrial capability. Range is also significantly increased.|$|R
50|$|Shortly {{after the}} affable Hutcheson {{took over the}} {{presidency}} on August 14, 1945, Japan surrendered to end World War II, and a two-day celebration ensued. When the fall quarter began soon thereafter, enrollment nearly <b>doubled</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> the previous quarter. The new president worked to prepare the campus for the influx of returning veterans as the college moved from wartime to peacetime conditions.|$|R
5|$|The Dutch bid {{to control}} {{southeast}} Asia's spice trade hinged on two principal strategies: the first: {{the first was}} to directly attack Iberian assets in the region, including Portugal's stronghold at Malacca and Spanish shipping between Manila and Acapulco; the second was to forge alliances with local rulers and offer protection in exchange for trading concessions. An important alliance was consolidated in 1603 when Dutch East India Company ships joined forces with the Sultanate of Johor to capture the Santa Catarina, a Portuguese carrack transiting the Singapore Straits. The vessel's pillaged cargo was later sold in Europe for approximately 3.5million florins, equivalent to half the Dutch East India Company's paid capital and <b>double</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> the British East India Company. Soon after this triumph, possibly in 1605, Dutch officers presented the Seri Rambai to Johor's sultan.|$|E
5|$|The German UB II design {{improved}} {{upon the}} design of the UB I boats, which had been ordered in September 1914. In service, the UB I boats were found to be too small and too slow. A major problem was that, because they had a single propeller shaft/engine combo, if either component failed, the U-boat became almost totally disabled. To rectify this flaw, the UB II boats featured twin propeller shafts and twin engines (one shaft for each engine), which also increased the U-boat's top speed. The new design also included more powerful batteries, larger torpedo tubes, and a deck gun. As a UB II boat, U-45 could also carry twice the torpedo load of her UB I counterparts, and nearly ten times as much fuel. To contain all of these changes the hull was larger, and the surface and submerged displacement was more than <b>double</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> the UB I boats.|$|E
5|$|The VE Commodore {{was well}} {{received}} in the Australian market, where it has consistently outsold rivals in the large car segment. Sales at one point were nearly <b>double</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> its closest segment competitor, the Ford Falcon. However, this gap has narrowed since {{the release of a}} new Falcon FG model. VE's position as Australia's outright best selling car was challenged in 2007 and overtaken during some months in 2008 by the Toyota Corolla in the face of increasing petrol prices. However, the release of the Sportwagon in mid-2008 has helped to re-establish its number one sales position by accounting for more than 30percent of total Commodore sales. In 2007 the VE Commodore became the fifth Commodore model to receive the Wheels Car of the Year award.|$|E
50|$|The film {{exceeded}} all expectations by actually outdoing {{the massive}} {{box office success}} of Die Hard. The film had a budget of US$70 million and had a wide release in 2,507 theaters, making $21.7 million on its opening weekend. Die Hard 2 has domestically made $117.5 million and $239.5 million worldwide {{making it one of}} the most profitable Christmas films, almost <b>doubling</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> Die Hard.|$|R
50|$|It was {{the first}} major {{championship}} at the expansive Straits Course, designed by Pete Dye and opened in 1998, which allowed high attendance and was highly profitable for the PGA of America. It set records with over 94,400 tickets sold and an overall attendance of 320,000 for the week. The overall economic impact was $76.9 million, shattering the previous record of $50.4 million in 2002, and nearly <b>doubling</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> 2003.|$|R
5000|$|Aluar {{acquired}} aluminum products maker Camea, a local {{subsidiary of}} Canadian firm Alcan, in 1993, and Alcan's remaining local concern, C&K Aluminio, in 1996. The privatizations drive advanced by President Carlos Menem {{led to the}} 1995 sale of the Futaleufú Dam, whose installed capacity of 472 MW nearly <b>doubled</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> its Trevelín facility, and it expanded further into the intermediate products sector with the 1998 purchase of Uboldi & Compañía.|$|R
