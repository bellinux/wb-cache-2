40|$|Uhde Inventa-Fisher GmbH, Berlin/Germany has {{developed}} a new recycling process for polyethylene terephthalate (PET), which is increasingly being used for beverage packaging. This flake-to-resin process (FTR) allow PET pellets or preforms to be produced in only one process step from the PET prepolymers by melt condensation. Terephtahlic acid and monoethylene glycol are converted into PET prepolymers in a special reactor, and the conventionally washed PET flakes are melted in a multi-screw extruder. The molten post-consumer PET flakes are partially depolymerized by adding ethylene glycol, to achieve {{the level of the}} virgin material prepolymer. The two melts are then blended and polymerized in a reactor, and after filtration, this melt can be processed either into pellets or directly into preforms. This FTR process offers possibilities to produce regulation-compliant <b>food-contact</b> <b>packaging</b> from post-consumer PET flakes...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} chitosan film behavior during microwave heating for 10 different heating times from 0 to 40 min. Chitosan films were produced by casting. Their structure and properties were investigated with several techniques, including Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry, but also by the measurement of the film color and the mechanical properties or by the study of the rheological properties of the rehydrated films. An original technique of gas chromatography (electronic nose) was used to analyze the film odor and highlight the presence of volatile compounds related to the Maillard reaction occurring during film heating. The results show that structural modifications occurred in two steps; this affected the polymer structure, such as the crystallization and chain scission. The appearance of the neoformed compounds was also observed and must be controlled to guarantee the safety of this <b>food-contact</b> <b>packaging</b> material...|$|E
40|$|Packaging {{is used to}} contain, preserve, protect, and {{advertise}} both manufactured {{and natural}} products. In 2013 {{it was reported that}} over thirty percent of solid waste in the United States was from packaging. One way to reduce the impact of packaging on the environment is to create a solution that is edible and sourced from a waste or secondary food product that is not currently being utilized. <b>Food-contact</b> <b>packaging</b> made from recycled materials must meet strict U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations to be utilized as raw material for packaging. Fruit pomace is a candidate material since it may be cross-linked to increase strength and become the base for a multilayer packaging composite. This proof of concept study was designed to determine the ideal composition of fruit pomace and an effective cross-linking process. A pilot study of seven samples compared two different compositions and assessed a first attempt at cross-linking. Our studies showed that one of the compositions was stronger than the other based on tensile strength. This was true for both stress (MPa) and normalized stress (N). A second cross-linking process based on a patented method did not indicate any improvements in strength. The effect of aging was studied through the apple samples produced with a control procedure across multiple trials. While there was no indication of aging effects based on the ultimate tensile strength, there was indication that other factors may have altered strength values. The two suspected factors are the improvement of the rehydration process and the amount of time between preparation (rehydration and strip formation) and processing (cross-linking and dehydration) ...|$|E
40|$|Ba c k g ro u n d: Perfluorinated {{carboxylic}} acids (PFCAs) are {{ubiquitous in}} human sera worldwide. Biotransformation of the polyfluoroalkyl phosphate esters (PAPs) {{is a possible}} source of PFCA exposure, because PAPs are used in <b>food-contact</b> paper <b>packaging</b> and have been observed in human sera. Objectives: We determined pharmacokinetic parameters for the PAP monoesters (monoPAPs) and PAP diesters (diPAPs), as well as biotransformation yields to the PFCAs, using a rat model. Me t h o d s: The animals were dosed intravenously or by oral gavage {{with a mixture of}} 4 : 2, 6 : 2, 8 : 2, and 10 : 2 monoPAP or diPAP chain lengths. Concentrations of the PAPs and PFCAs, as well as metabolic intermediates and phase II metabolites, were monitored over time in blood, urine, and feces. Re s u l t s: The diPAPs were bioavailable, with bioavailability decreasing as the chain length increased from 4 to 10 perfluorinated carbons. The monoPAPs were not absorbed from the gut; however, we found evidence to suggest phosphate-ester cleavage within the gut contents. We observed biotransformation to the PFCAs for both monoPAP and diPAP congeners. Con c l u s i o n s: Using experimentally derived biotransformation yields, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) sera concentrations were predicted from the biotransformation of 8 : 2 diPAP at concentrations observed in human serum. Because of the long human serum half-life of PFOA, biotransformation of diPAP even with low-level exposure could over time result in significant exposure to PFOA. Although humans are exposed directly to PFCAs in food and dust, the pharmacokinetic parameters determined here suggest that PAP exposure should be considered a significant indirect source of human PFCA contamination. Key w o r d s: biotransformation, human exposure, perfluorinated carboxylates, perfluorooctanoic acid, pharmacokinetics, polyfluoroalkyl phosphate esters.
