The biochemical events {{responsible for the}} interconversion of one plastid form into another are poorly documented.

40|$|AbstractThe {{differentiation}} of murine trophoblast giant cells (TGCs) is well characterised {{at the molecular}} level and, to some extent, the cellular level. Currently, there is a rudimentary understanding about factors regulating the cellular {{differentiation of}} secondary TGCs. Using day 8. 5 p. c. -ectoplacental cone (EPC) explant in serum-free culture, we have found parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) to regulate cellular changes during TGC differentiation. PTHrP greatly stimulated the <b>formation</b> <b>and</b> <b>organisation</b> of actin stress fibres and actin expression in trophoblast outgrowth. This coincided with changing cell shape into a flattened/fibroblastic morphology, suppression of E-cadherin expression, and increased cell spreading in culture. PTHrP also increased the nuclear staining of β-catenin and, similar to activator protein- 2 γ (AP- 2 γ), showed microtubule-dependent nuclear localisation in vitro. These cellular and behavioural changes correlated with changes in the expression of RhoGTPases and in both expression and phosphorylation of Eph/Ephrin kinases. The effects of PTHrP on trophoblast cellular differentiation were abolished after blocking its action. In conclusion, PTHrP provides an excellent example of the extrinsic factors that, through their network of activities, {{plays an important role in}} cellular differentiation of secondary TGCs...|$|E

Electron microscopic observations showed that, in the epidermis, {{differentiation of}} chromoplasts started from leucoplasts, while mesophyll chromoplasts originated from chloroplasts. During petal maturation, fibrils accumulated in the plastids, often arranging in a parallel fashion to form compact birefringent bundles. Immediately before flower opening, these fibrillar bundles started to disorganise, and, at anthesis, most chromoplasts contained widely spaced fibrils which were irregularly dispersed through the plastid interior. During chromoplast differentiation, fibrils were commonly observed to protrude from plastoglobules, suggesting the possible site of their formation. Western analysis indicated that a protein antigenically related to fibrillin from pepper chromoplasts participates in the constitution of fibrils in Chelidonium petals...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{development}} of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) confers {{a high risk}} of mortality in primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS) patients, but the sensitivity and specificity of proposed lymphoma predictors are insufficient for practical use. The performance of lymphoid organisation in the form of germinal centre (GC) -like lesions was evaluated in labial salivary gland biopsies taken at pSS diagnosis as a potential lymphoma-predicting biomarker. METHODS: Labial salivary gland tissue biopsies available from two Swedish pSS research cohorts (n= 175) were re-evaluated by light microscopy in a blind study in order to identify GC-like structures as a sign of ectopic lymphoid tissue <b>formation</b> <b>and</b> <b>organisation.</b> A linkage study was performed with the Swedish Cancer Registry for lymphoma identification. The risk of developing NHL in GC-positive patients in comparison with GC-negative patients was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier statistics and log-rank test. Associations between GC-like structures and clinical and/or laboratory disease markers were also determined using χ(2) or Fisher's exact tests. RESULTS: At diagnosis, 25 % of pSS patients had GC-like structures in their salivary glands. Seven of the 175 patients studied (14 % GC+ and 0. 8 % GC-) developed NHL during 1855 patient-years at risk, with a median onset of 7 years following the initial diagnostic salivary gland biopsy. Six of the seven patients had GC-like structures at diagnosis; the remaining patient was GC negative at the time of diagnosis (p= 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: The detection of GC-like structures by light microscopy in pSS diagnostic salivary biopsies is proposed as a highly predictive and easy-to-obtain marker for NHL development. This allows for risk stratification of patients and the possibility to initiate preventive B-cell-directed therapy...|$|E
40|$|Amphipathic alpha-helices {{have been}} {{proposed}} as the general means used by soluble proteins to induce membrane tubulation. Previous studies had shown that the GRA 2 dense granule protein of Toxoplasma gondii would be a crucial protein {{for the formation of}} the intravacuolar membranous nanotubular network (MNN) and that one of the functions of the MNN is to organise the parasites within the parasitophorous vacuole. GRA 2 is a small protein (185 amino acids), predicted to contain three amphipathic alpha-helices (alpha 1 : 70 - 92; alpha 2 : 95 - 110 and alpha 3 : 119 - 139) when using the standard programs of secondary structure prediction. To investigate the respective contribution of each alpha-helix in the GRA 2 functions, we used DeltaGRA 2 -HXGPRT knock-out complementation: eight truncated forms of GRA 2 were expressed in the deleted recipient and the phenotypes of these mutants were analysed. This study showed that: (i) alpha 3, when associated with the N-terminal region (NT) and the C-terminal region (CT), is sufficient to target the protein to the parasite posterior end and to induce formation of membranous vesicles within the vacuole. However, when associated only with CT, alpha 3 is not sufficient to provide the hydrophobicity required for membrane association; (ii) the alpha 1 alpha 2 region is alone not sufficient to induce membrane tubulation within the PV; and (iii) only one mutant, NT-alpha 1 alpha 2 alpha 3, restores most of the biochemical and functional properties of GRA 2, including traffic to the dense granules, secretion into the vacuole, association with vacuolar membranes, induction of the MNN <b>formation</b> <b>and</b> <b>organisation</b> of the parasites within the vacuole...|$|E
40|$|In this work, {{the social}} {{dynamics}} and {{the dynamics of}} coalitionary behaviour observed in a semi-free provisioned group of Cebus apella were used to explore predictions of socio-ecological models regarding the <b>formation</b> <b>and</b> <b>organisation</b> of social groups, and the hypothesis that complexity of social life is pressure to enlarged brain. In accordance to socio-ecological models but in contrast to accepted classification of C. apella, the group was not matrilinally organised, consequence of the prevalence of scramble type of food competition. The group hierarchy had a clear alpha male, an alpha female, and was age-size based {{for the rest of}} the group. The rank of infants did not correlate with the rank of their mothers. Again indicating the non-matrilineal organisation, females did not tend to be closer to each other or to their relatives, but rather the alpha male and dependent infants were most the attractive members of the group. Grooming was defined as a multifunctional behaviour, indicating both tolerance and affiliation for different dyads. Grooming occurred down the hierarchy and the alpha female was the most active groomer. More importantly, amount of grooming exchanged between dyads did not influence coalitionary behaviour. Although infrequent, opportunistic conservative and ambivalent coalitions did occur in conflicts involving adults, suggesting its strategic use. In the Main group, most of third party interference in aggressive events was protective, with the alpha male supporting immatures against other adult males. It is suggested that a mild form of male-male sexual competition influences the social organisation of C. apella, with females clustering around an alpha male to obtain benefits from his protective abilities and tolerance. Finally, it is suggested that for a large brained species with wide dietary variability as C. apella, social organisation may be variable and flexible, and to reflect a continuum rather than discrete categories.

40|$|Focal adhesions are integrin-based protein {{complexes}} {{that form}} at {{the interface between}} cells and the extracellular matrix (ECM). These adhesion structures connect the cell to the adhesive ligands presented on the ECM and serve as signalling hubs to help cells to sense and respond to signals from the ECM. It {{has been shown that}} cells require an average 50 - 70 nm spacing of adhesive ligands for the formation of stable adhesion structures. However, the molecular organisation of ligands and adhesion proteins is less documented. The aim of this project was to produce surfaces with varying spacing of fluorescently-labelled adhesive ligand nano-domains and obtain single-molecule images of both the adhesive ligands and the adhesion proteins to better understand how adhesive ligand distribution influences adhesion organisation. First, the di-block copolymer phase separation method was optimised to produce surfaces with nano-domains with different average inter-domain spacing ranging from 18 to 93 nm (Chapter 3). Next, the nano-domains were functionalised with fluorescently-tagged adhesive ligands to facilitate cell attachment to the surfaces and formation of focal adhesions. Direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM) and quantitative analysis of the fluorescently-labelled adhesive ligands, based on density-based spatial clustering of application with noise (DBSCAN), were successfully combined in order to map the molecular organisation of adhesive ligands on the fabricated surfaces. Then, mouse embryonic Fibroblasts (MEF) were cultured on the surfaces for various time points. Cell attachment was found to be independent of the adhesive ligand nano-domain spacing while cells exhibited different patterns for spreading and adhesion formation on the different surfaces over time. Finally, two-colour single-molecule localisation microscopy (SMLM) was combined with DBSCAN and colocalisation analysis to produce colocalisation maps of adhesion proteins and adhesive ligands on surfaces with different spacings of adhesive ligand nano-domains, and to evaluate the degree of co-localisation between them (Chapter 5). In conclusion, the results presented in this thesis provide new insights on how the nanoscale distribution of adhesive ligand nano-domains influences cell attachment and spreading as well as the <b>formation</b> <b>and</b> <b>organisation</b> of focal adhesions at the molecular level...|$|E
40|$|The {{experimental}} studies {{included in the}} present thesis were performed in dogs and evaluated various aspects of periodontal tissue formation in degree III furcation defects. The third mandibular premolars were used as experimental units and healing was studied in biopsy material sampled at various time intervals following guided tissue regeneration therapy (GTR). In study I, two experiments were performed, a and b. In both experiments, degree III furcation defects were produced and reconstructive surgery was performed. In experiment a, e-PTFE barriers were placed in {{one side of the}} mandible while in the contralateral side no barrier was used. In experiment b, defects of different dimensions were produced. Resorbable Resolut® barriers were placed in one side of the mandible while in the contralateral side, non-resorbable e-PTFE barriers were applied. After 5 months of healing, the animals were sacrificed and biopsies were prepared for histological analyses. The findings showed that GTR, using either non-resorbable or resorbable barriers, had resulted in the resolution of both small and large furcation defects. In study II, the new formation of periodontal tissues at different time intervals (2, 4, 8, 20 weeks) was described. The results suggested that the <b>formation</b> <b>and</b> <b>organisation</b> of the periodontal tissues apparently occurred through an orderly sequence of events. In study III, the tissue which had formed 5 months after reconstructive therapy was analysed and compared with the periodontal tissues of pristine furcations. It was demonstrated that the healed furcations differed in many aspects - such as type of cementum and amount of mineralized bone - from the pristine furcations. Study IV evaluated GTR when different types of resorbable barriers were applied; Resolut® and Guidor®. Healing was allowed for 6 months. It was observed that both barriers allowed the formation of a new attachment. The presence of a granulomatous tissue in the apical part of defects at which a Guidor® barrier was applied, however, prevented bone regrowth at such sites. In study V, the effect of enamel matrix proteins (Emdogain®) in conjunction with GTR was evaluated. Healing was allowed for 4 months. The histological examination revealed that Emdogain®, topically applied on the root surface during surgery, may promote the formation of a new acellular cementum in an apical portion of the furcation defect...|$|E
40|$|The overall aim of {{the study}} is to {{describe}} and explain the <b>formation</b> <b>and</b> <b>organisation</b> of interactive media production in Sweden from the 1990 s to the end of 2003, the period of the so-called IT boom and crash, through the development of a theoretical model and gathering of empirical material. In the theory, interactive media production is conceptualised as a practice in part taking place on a social field structured according to the division and integration of labour within and between firms, and logics and status. It is argued that social fields are formed through the entrepreneurial realisation of opportunity structures resting in pre-existing structural configurations, and through the allocation of resources. The organisational outcome is explained by the structural preconditions, aspects of formation (what, who, how) and firms’ demands for stability and flexibility, creating a set of interrelated positions that firms might occupy. Empirical data has been collected from four firm and one individual level survey aimed at interactive media producers in Sweden, conducted between 1997 and 2003. A second data source consists of 8, 000 news articles and items focussed on IT and interactive media in Sweden. Third, visual analyses of web sites of firms producing interactive media solutions have been conducted. Finally, interviews with people active within the field have been made. The results show that the formation of interactive media production in Sweden should be understood in relation to the Swedish economic crisis of the early 1990 s, visions of IT, and beliefs in a societal transition to a new economy and knowledge society. These ideas contributed to allocating massive resources, e. g. state initiatives, increased demands and investment capital, to those producers of interactive media solutions that came to be symbols of the new economy. The abundance of resources caused a rapid growth of firms engaged in interactive media production and a financialisation that led to a speculative bubble and a stock market crash, eventually making the social field dissolve. The majority of firms that produce interactive media solutions are small and reach flexibility and stability by having a large proportion of permanently employed skilled workers and extensively participating in collaborations with other firms, including customers. The division and integration of labour follows the logics and clusters of activities that structure the social field: techno¬logy, aesthetics and economy. A large proportion of Swedish organisations have further developed inhouse interactive media operations that taken together are larger than the more visible so-called Internet consultants.

"Antonio Gramsci's thought has strongly influenced the fields of IR and IPE through the work of Robert Cox, Stephen Gill, Kees van der Pijl and others, engagements often gathered (not uncontroversially) under the rubric of an ostensibly unified "neo-Gramscian" position or ‘the Italian School’. The emergence of such interventions into IR/IPE has sparked controversy regarding whether Gramsci’s work can be legitimately applied to "the international," both from within IR and in other fields. This article examines the validity of such critiques of "neo-Gramscian IPE," which we argue rely on problematic characterisations and little evidence from Gramsci's writings.

40|$|The main {{aim of this}} {{dissertation}} {{has been}} to examine the creation, organisation and work of the Red Army's Civil War political apparatus and assess its overall contribution to the Bolshevik war effort. To this end the dissertation itself consists of 4 main chapters {{and a number of}} appendices, detailing not only the work of the main political organs of the Red Army, but also the main personalities involved. The first chapter is an introductory chapter, examining the organ, which many Soviet historians have for a long time considered to be the Bolsheviks' first attempt at the creation of a centralised political organ for the Red Army, namely the Organisation-agitation department of the All-Russian Collegiate for the <b>Formation</b> <b>and</b> <b>Organisation</b> of the Red Army. The work carried out for the first chapter then leads to a discussion of the work of arguably the first real attempt by the Bolsheviks to create a properly functioning political organ specifically for the Red Army, namely the All-Russian Bureau of Military Commissars (VBVK). The chapter has been sub-divided into a number of sections, in order to allow a greater detailed examination of the work, personalities and difficulties that the central political apparatus faced in its attempts to exert some sort of control over the various constituent parts of the front political apparatus-the military commissars, the Party cells and the ever-increasing important political departments in the period 1918 - 1919. That VBVK was not to be a crowning success is revealed by the necessity that the Bolsheviks felt towards the beginning of 1919 to abolish VBVK and create arguably the centralised political organ of the Red Army during the Civil War period-the Political Administration of the Revolutionary Military Soviet of the Republic (PUR). Created in May 1919, PUR was to face many of the same problems that had beset VBVK a year or so earlier but, on the whole, coped with them better and political and cultural-educational work in the Red Army proceeded apace. The final, conclusive chapter brings all the threads together and assesses the claims made for the political work carried out in the front-line Red Army units during 1918 - 1920 and, whilst admitting that the Bolsheviks did spend much time on promoting the apparatus in a number of ways, the assertions made by generations of Soviet historians concerning the overall value of the political and cultural-educational work carried out in the Red Army are still too grandiose {{and that there is a}} lack of concrete evidence available, proving the worth of the political work carried out and its positive military consequences...|$|E

Here, we have examined two transgenic murine models probing the role of junctophilin- 2, a membrane-tethering protein crucial for the <b>formation</b> <b>and</b> molecular <b>organisation</b> of sub-microscopic junctions in ventricular muscle cells of the heart. Quantitative single-molecule localisation microscopy showed that junctions in animals producing above-normal levels of junctophilin- 2 were enlarged, allowing the re-organisation of the primary functional protein within it, the ryanodine receptor (RyR; in this paper, we use RyR {{to refer to the}} myocardial isoform RyR 2). Although this change was associated with much enlarged RyR clusters that, due to their size, should be more excitable, functionally it caused a mild inhibition in the Ca 2 + signalling output of the junctions (Ca 2 + sparks). Analysis of the single-molecule densities of both RyR and junctophilin- 2 revealed an ∼ 3 -fold increase in the junctophilin- 2 to RyR ratio. This molecular rearrangement is compatible with direct inhibition of RyR opening by junctophilin- 2 to intrinsically stabilise the Ca 2 + signalling properties of the junction and thus the contractile function of the cell...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE - This {{conceptual}} paper aims {{to explain}} how "project management centres of excellence (CoEs) ", a particular class of knowledge network, {{can be viewed as}} providing great potential for assisting project management (PM) teams to make wise decisions. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH - The paper presents a range of knowledge network types and classifies them into a matrix using dimensions of social capital <b>formation</b> <b>and</b> learning levels. Examples were used of each identified type, drawn from the literature, to illustrate and clarify the capability maturity levels, from ad hoc isolated communities of interest to integrated and strategic CoEs that serve to propagate and transfer knowledge about an organisation&# 039;s advanced project management skills and tools. FINDINGS - The paper presens a useful framework for understanding this evolution and argues that CoEs can optimise, help coordinate and enhance the effectiveness of a range of knowledge networks operating within an inter-organisational or intra-organisational project team. ORIGINALITY/VALUE - The framework: facilitates PM organisational leaders to understand knowledge networks from a social capital <b>formation</b> <b>and</b> learning <b>organisation</b> perspective; highlights limitations of each of the identified knowledge network types from this perspective; and challenges PM leaders to strategically create and maintain a workplace environment that both encourages PM best practice and maximises organic learning development from which knowledge networks spring. PM leaders need to realise that sustaining CoEs is highly corporate resource intensive, however, derived benefits can include reduced wasted effort, poor project outcomes and increase organisational learning that facilitates continual PM process improvement. The framework provided here helps to justify that commitment...|$|R
40|$|The article {{considers}} {{influence of}} factors – reasons of origination of crisis phenomena – upon resource potential {{with the aim}} of study of management <b>and</b> <b>organisation</b> enterprise development. It identifies that correlation of managed and unmanaged processes at an enterprise is achieved only through correct selection of tactical and strategic orientation, which should take into account specific features of various types of crises, and also the process of their deployment and ways of prevention and elimination. The article generalises influence of factors – reasons of origination of crisis phenomena – upon resource potential {{with the aim of}} study of the management <b>and</b> <b>organisation</b> development of an enterprise and building a mechanism. It improves a mechanism of formation of the resource potential of the management <b>and</b> <b>organisation</b> development of an enterprise at tactical and strategic levels. It allowed finding out that managerial impact on <b>formation</b> <b>and</b> maintenance of key factors influences the <b>formation,</b> management <b>and</b> application of the enterprise resource potential...|$|R
