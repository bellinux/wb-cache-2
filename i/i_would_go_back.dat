500|$|Warner Bros. {{decided to}} {{consider}} a live-action Batman Beyond film and an adaptation of Frank Miller's [...] Warner would then produce whichever idea suited them the most. Schumacher felt he [...] "owe the Batman culture a real Batman movie. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to the basics and make a dark portrayal of the Dark Knight."

Aronofsky and Miller developed a Year One script with Aronofsky to direct, but it was ultimately canceled. Christopher Nolan was eventually hired to helm the next Batman film in January 2003, resulting in the rebooted Batman Begins (2005).|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} for MTV upon the album's release, Big Boi explained that most of its material had been finished while at Jive, stating [...] "It's basically the same album. I could have been done, like, a year ago. But being that we were having creative differences — you know, every time they rejected what I was doing, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> {{in the studio and}} work on more stuff. The last two songs, 'You Ain't No DJ' and 'Be Still,' were the last two records, but everything else was already on there". Despite his individual release, OutKast as a group remained signed to Jive. After leaving Jive, Big Boi contacted record executive and Island Def Jam CEO/chairman L.A. Reid, who had originally signed OutKast to LaFace in 1992. He played Reid a track from the album, [...] "Fo Yo Sorrows", which persuaded him to actualize a contract for Big Boi. Following two months of negotiations, Big Boi signed a three-album deal with Def Jam Recordings in March 2010.|$|E
500|$|During {{the filming}} of Batman & Robin, Warner Bros. was {{impressed}} with the dailies, prompting them to immediately hire Joel Schumacher to reprise his directing duties for a third film. Writer Akiva Goldsman, who worked on Batman Forever and Batman & Robin, turned down the chance to write the script. In late 1996, Warner Bros. and Schumacher hired Mark Protosevich to write the script for a fifth Batman film. A projected mid-1999 release date was announced. Titled Batman Unchained but often incorrectly referred to as Batman Triumphant, Protosevich's script had the Scarecrow as the main villain and the Joker would return as a hallucination in Batman's mind caused by the Scarecrow's fear toxin. Harley Quinn appeared as a supporting character, written as the Joker's daughter trying to kill Batman to avenge her father's death. George Clooney, Chris O'Donnell and Alicia Silverstone were set to reprise the roles of Batman, Robin, and Batgirl. Schumacher had also approached Nicolas Cage for the role of Scarecrow. However, when Batman & Robin received negative reviews and failed to outgross any of its predecessors, Warner Bros. was unsure of their plans for Batman Unchained. The studio decided it was best to consider a live-action Batman Beyond film and an adaptation of Frank Miller's [...] Warner Bros. would then greenlight whichever idea suited them the most. Schumacher felt he [...] "owe the Batman culture a real Batman movie. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to the basics and make a dark portrayal of the Dark Knight." [...] He approached Warner Bros. to do Batman: Year One in mid-1998.|$|E

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>would</b> {{not have}} <b>gone</b> <b>back</b> to Joe now, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not have <b>gone</b> <b>back</b> to Biddy now, for any consideration; simply, I suppose, because {{my sense of}} my own {{worthless}} conduct to them was greater than every consideration. No wisdom on earth could have given me the comfort that I should have derived from their simplicity and fidelity; but I could never, never, undo what I had done.|$|R
60|$|LADY WINDERMERE. Yes! he shall. Had he come himself, <b>I</b> admit <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have <b>gone</b> <b>back</b> to {{the life}} of {{degradation}} you and he had prepared for me--I was going back--but to stay himself at home, and to send you as his messenger--oh! it was infamous--infamous.|$|R
6000|$|... "To far-off lands whence I came, a sea-girt land {{which once}} was mine own. My fathers lived there. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> and tell my {{people of all}} that I saw here on Calvary seven years ago." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Did {{you think}} <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> there, Isabel?" [...] asked March, with a haggard look. [...] "Well, {{if you say}} so, I will go back, and do what Dryfoos ordered me to do. I'm {{sufficiently}} cowed between him and you, I can assure you." ...|$|E
6000|$|I felt an {{emptiness}} {{when the}} train pulled out. I did love my family, after all! <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to the deserted house, and I {{could not bear to}} look in at the nursery door, at the little beds with covers flung over them. Why couldn't I appreciate these joys when I had them? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, not to-day," [...] {{said the}} lady, [...] "I think. We {{have had an}} escape, but one feels these things a little more {{afterward}} than at the time. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> rather <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to Oxford and be quiet; {{and there is more}} than one college which you have not yet seen." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{hate that}} woman!" [...] Isobel exclaimed as I entered, [...] "I hate her! <b>I</b> <b>would</b> {{rather die than}} <b>go</b> to her. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> rather <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to the convent. She looks at me as though I were {{something}} to be despised, something which {{should not be allowed}} to go alive upon the earth!" ...|$|R
5000|$|During an {{interview}} with BraveWords in 2015, Anderson selected Stand Up as his favorite Tull album: [...] "I suppose {{if you were to}} really twist my arm, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> probably <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to 1969, with the Stand Up album, because that was my first album of first really original music. It has a special place in my heart." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not they!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "It was {{my friend}} Heron whom they had trussed and gagged, and whom my amiable friend M. Chambertin will find in there to-morrow morning.

6000|$|... "If I thought," [...] he answered, [...] "that {{there was}} the {{slightest}} thing I could do in London which I have not already done, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> by the first train this morning, but, indeed, you must remember what I told you last night. The matter is practically settled. In a few days he will know." ...|$|E
60|$|It was a {{cover for}} his book-table that I {{happened}} to be ornamenting. It had been laid by on the night preceding my sad journey and never resumed. I showed it to him now, and he admired it highly. After I had explained the pattern to him and all the great effects that were to come out by and by, I thought <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to our last theme.|$|E
6000|$|... "No. I've been shadowed {{for a long}} time; {{one gets}} used to that. But then Soames came. By the little Niobe--the same story; <b>would</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to him?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Wadia {{has since}} {{said she would}} return if she was asked by producers, saying: [...] "I miss EastEnders a lot, but after doing it for {{five and a half}} years it was time for me to <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to comedy and have a bit of a change. But if they asked me <b>I</b> <b>would</b> love to <b>go</b> <b>back.</b> <b>I</b> asked to be killed off, because I wanted a big story end. But they didn't want to kill the character, which was much loved by the audience. They didn't want me to go. I love that show and it did a lot to my career. I will always be thankful to EastEnders and if they asked me to, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> {{absolutely}} <b>go</b> <b>back</b> for a bit." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nor, Sir," [...] said he, [...] "do I {{bring my}} mind to this politically, by the {{necessity}} of my circumstances, which some call miserable; but if I know any thing of myself, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not <b>go</b> <b>back,</b> no not though my master, the czar, should call me, and offer to reinstate me in all my former grandeur; <b>I</b> say, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> no more <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to it, than I believe my soul, when it shall be delivered from this prison of the body, and has had {{a taste of the}} glorious state beyond life, would come back to the gaol of flesh and blood it is now enclosed in, and leave Heaven to deal in the dirt and grime of human affairs." ...|$|R
60|$|A {{few days}} after, I went away from Woodbury. I had learned for the moment, I thought, all that Woodbury could teach me: and I longed {{to get free}} again for a while from this pervading {{atmosphere}} of mystery. At Aunt Emma's, at least, all was plain and aboveboard. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to Barton-on-the-Sea, and rest there for a while, among the heathery hills, before proceeding any further on my voyage of discovery.|$|E
6000|$|... "To do as I ask you,--that {{would be}} kind. Oh, Ayala, cannot you {{be kind to}} me?" [...] She shook her head, still {{standing}} in the place which she had occupied from the beginning. [...] "May I come again? Will you give me three months, and then think of it? If you would only say that, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to my work and never leave it." [...] But she still shook her head. [...] "Must I never hope?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Gadzookers, Master Mayor," [...] said, Wildrake, neither {{flattered by}} the magistrate's {{familiarity}} of address, nor captivated by his munificence-- [...] "I wonder who the devil made {{you and me}} fellows? and, besides, do you think <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to Woodstock with your worshipful cods-head, when, by good management, I may get a peep of fair Rosamond, and see whether she was that choice and incomparable piece of ware, which {{the world has been}} told of by rhymers and ballad-makers?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Bottles writhed uneasily in his chair. [...] "Thank you, Eustace; {{but really}} I must ask you--in short, I don't {{want to be}} floated or {{anything}} of the sort. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> rather <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to South Africa and my volunteer corps. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> indeed. <b>I</b> hate strangers, and society, and {{all that sort of}} thing.

6000|$|... "I can't deny," [...] Margaret {{admitted}} with a sigh, [...] "that I {{liked to}} hear you speak in that way, though <b>I</b> knew you <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> on your word. You see, you have changed already." ...|$|R
6000|$|... [Picture: In the Thames] It was bitterly cold. The wind cut like a knife. I thought I {{would not}} throw the water over myself after all. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> {{into the boat}} and dress; and I turned to do so; and, as I turned, the silly branch gave way, and I and the towel went in {{together}} with a tremendous splash, and I was out mid-stream with a gallon of Thames water inside me before I knew what had happened.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} thinking," [...] said the Absolute Fool, [...] "that it is {{perfectly}} ridiculous, and very uncomfortable, to continue this search any longer. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>back,</b> but my master would not suffer me to return without knowing where you are going. I have, therefore, a plan to propose. Give up your useless search for this Prince, who is probably not nearly so handsome and intellectual as I am, and marry me. We will then return, and I will assume the reins of government in your domain." ...|$|E
6000|$|Ottima. Then, Venus' body, had we {{come upon}} [...] My husband Luca Gaddi's murdered corpse [...] Within there, at his couch-foot, covered close-- [...] Would you have pored upon it?

60|$|Fortunate indeed was it, {{so far as}} my {{own good}} name was concerned, that I did not stand there many seconds in the {{darkness}} reflecting upon what might be before me, else had I become so timorous that I believe of a verity <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have <b>gone</b> <b>back</b> to old Mary's cabin, admitting to my comrades that I dare not go further on the venture.|$|R
5000|$|... "I’m {{going back}} to Gate and rejoin the family business. I’m looking forward to that. I told dad (Herb Peyton) that he has {{saved a lot of}} money because he hasn’t had to pay me for eight years. I think my father is very eager to retire. He wasn’t excited about me running for a second term. If it had been his choice, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have <b>gone</b> <b>back</b> Gate sooner." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Burma {{is a bad}} country, master. After {{living with}} the English, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to live under the king's officers, in any case.

60|$|When {{this game}} was played I was always chosen as first ostrich, as at that time I could easily outrun and out-jump any of my gauche playmates, even those who were {{three or four years}} older than myself. Nevertheless, these games--horse-racing, sham fights, and ostrich- hunting, and the like--gave me no abiding satisfaction; they were no sooner over than <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>back,</b> almost with a sense of relief, to my solitary rambles and bird-watching, and to wishing that the day would come when my masterful brother would allow me to use a gun and {{practise}} the one sport of wild-duck shooting I desired.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should have}} felt just the same--that ours {{was not a}} marriage. And <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to Richard without repeating the sacrament, if he asked me.

60|$|Hysterically impulsive, Miss Jillgall seized both my hands, and {{overwhelmed}} me with entreaties that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> {{with her to}} the house. I listened rather absently. The middle-aged lady happened to be nearer to me now than on either of the former occasions on which I had seen her. There was something in the expression of her eyes which seemed to be familiar to me. But the effort of my memory was not helped by what I observed in the other parts of her face. The iron-gray hair, the baggy lower eyelids, the fat cheeks, the coarse complexion, and the double chin, were features, and very disagreeable features, too, which I had never seen at any former time.|$|E
60|$|Curiously enough I have {{completely}} forgotten my mood after {{that for a}} little while, but I know that later, for a minute perhaps, I hung for a time out of the carriage with the door open, contemplating a leap from the train.

60|$|LADY WINDERMERE.

My husband sent you to lure me back that I might serve as a blind to whatever relations exist between you and him.|$|R
