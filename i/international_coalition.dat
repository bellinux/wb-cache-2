After the September 11 attacks on New York, Bush launched the War on Terror, in which the United States military and a small <b>international</b> <b>coalition</b> invaded Afghanistan. In 2003, Bush then launched the invasion of Iraq, searching for Weapons of Mass Destruction, which he described as {{being part of the}} War on Terrorism. Those invasions led to the toppling of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan and the removal of Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq.|$|E

Aimed at increasing awareness, sharing information and co-ordinating responses to reduce the health effects of heat on vulnerable populations, the action plan is the first comprehensive plan in Asia to address the threat of adverse heat on health. It also focuses on community participation, building public awareness of the risks of extreme heat, training medical and community workers to respond to and help prevent heat-related illnesses, and co-ordinating an interagency emergency response effort when heat waves hit.|$|E

5|$|Australia was {{a member}} of the <b>international</b> <b>coalition</b> which contributed {{military}} forces to the 1991 Gulf War, deploying a naval task group of two warships, a support ship and a clearance diving team; in total about 750 personnel. The Australian contribution was the first time Australian personnel were deployed to an active war zone since the establishment of the ADF and the deployment tested its capabilities and command structure. However, the Australian force did not see combat, and instead playing a significant role in enforcing the sanctions put in place against Iraq following the invasion of Kuwait. Some ADF personnel serving on exchange with British and American units did see combat, and a few were later decorated for their actions. Following the war, the Navy regularly deployed a frigate to the Persian Gulf or Red Sea to enforce the trade sanctions which continued to be applied to Iraq. A number of Australian airmen and ground crew posted to or on exchange with US and British air forces subsequently participated in enforcing no-fly zones imposed over Iraq between 1991 and 2003.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} Islamist {{inspired}} {{terrorist attacks in}} New York and Washington on 11 September 2001, Australian forces were committed to the American-led <b>international</b> <b>coalition</b> against terrorism. The ADF's most visible contribution—codenamed Operation Slipper—has been a special forces task group operating in Afghanistan from 2001 to 2002 and again from mid-2005 {{to fight against the}} Taliban. Over time the Australian commitment has grown, with the addition of further ground forces {{in the form of a}} Reconstruction Task Force from 2006 to provide security, reconstruction and to mentor and train the Afghan National Army. Australia has also contributed a frigate and two AP-3C Orion surveillance aircraft and three C-130 Hercules transport aircraft to international operations in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean since 2001, supporting both the operations in Afghanistan and those in Iraq under Operation Catalyst. A detachment of four F/A-18 Hornet fighter-bombers was based at Diego Garcia from late-2001 to mid-2002, while two Boeing 707 air-to-air refuelling aircraft were also based in Manas Air Base in Kyrgyzstan to provide support to coalition aircraft operating in Afghan airspace but were later withdrawn. A Special Operations Task Group was deployed to support the Reconstruction Taskforce in April 2007. In addition to radar crews, logistics and intelligence officers, and security personnel, this brought the number of Australian personnel in Afghanistan to 950 by mid-2007, with further small increases to 1,000 in mid-2008, 1,100 in early 2009 and 1,550 in mid-2009.|$|E

40|$|Today, {{information}} sharing {{is critical to}} almost every institution. There is no more critical need for {{information sharing}} than during an international crisis, when <b>international</b> <b>coalitions</b> dynamically form. In {{the event of a}} crisis, whether it is humanitarian relief, natural disaster, combat operations, or terrorist incidents, <b>international</b> <b>coalitions</b> have an immediate need for information. These coalitions are formed with international cooperation, where each participating country offers whatever resources it can muster to support the given crisis. These situations can occur suddenly, simultaneously, and without warning. Often times, participants are coalition partners in one crisis and adversaries in another, raising difficult security issues with respect to information sharing. Our specific interest is in the Dynamic Coalition Problem (DCP), with an emphasis on the information sharing and security risks when coalitions are formed in response to a crisis. This paper defines the DCP and explores its intricate, challenging, and complex information and resource sharing, and security issues, utilizing real-world situations, which are drawn from a military domain...|$|R

25|$|As an <b>international</b> <b>coalition</b> under United States command {{assembled}} {{in anticipation of}} an invasion of Iraqi-occupied Kuwait, the Iraqi regime decided to destroy as much of Kuwait's oil reserves and infrastructure as possible before withdrawing from that country. As early as December 1990, Iraqi forces placed explosive charges on Kuwaiti oil wells. The wells were systematically sabotaged beginning on January 16, 1991, when the allies commenced air strikes against Iraqi targets. On February 8, satellite images detected the first smoke from burning oil wells. The number of oil fires peaked between February 22 and 24, when the allied ground offensive began.|$|E
