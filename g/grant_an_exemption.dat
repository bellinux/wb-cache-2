2500|$|Some films (those {{made for}} {{educational}} or training purposes, for instance) {{are exempt from}} classification under certain conditions. Film festivals and institutions such as Australian Centre for the Moving Image (ACMI) must apply to the Classification Board to have the films [...] on their proposed program made exempt from classification {{for the purpose of}} screening at a particular film festival or event. If the Classification Board believes an unclassified work, in their estimation would receive an X18+ classification if it were to be classified they will not <b>grant</b> <b>an</b> <b>exemption</b> for public screening as an X18+ cannot be exhibited. Film festivals may be required to age-restrict entrance to a festival or screening.|$|E

2500|$|As Health Secretary, Hewitt lobbied {{hard for}} a {{complete}} ban on smoking in public places, which came into force on 1 July 2007. Her predecessor, John Reid had been in favour of limiting the Government's proposed smoking ban as much as possible, and Labour's 2005 election manifesto had included only a limited pledge, proposing to only ban smoking in places where food was served. Even {{though he had been}} moved to Secretary of State for Defence, Reid was the main opponent of her proposals, and a leading figure in the decision of the Cabinet to <b>grant</b> <b>an</b> <b>exemption</b> for private clubs and pubs that did not serve food. However, the exemption in the Cabinet proposals did not find favour with MPs and the Government gave them a free vote on the issue. Hewitt voted with the rebels to defeat the Cabinet's partial ban, which was replaced by the outright ban which she had always wanted. Sir Liam Donaldson described the ban as [...] "a momentous move which would prevent the deaths of both smokers and non-smokers." [...] In June 2010, it was announced {{that there had been a}} 2.4% decrease in heart attack admissions in the year following the ban. She also called for a tax increase on alcopops, although none ultimately took place. As well as introducing the [...] website.|$|E

50|$|A {{territorial}} prelate exercises quasi-episcopal {{jurisdiction in}} a territory not comprised by any diocese.

50|$|The London Monarchs left Wembley {{for reasons}} of cost, size and availability, and the team's home games were played at Tottenham Hotspur F.C.'s White Hart Lane in the 1995 and 1996 seasons.

5000|$|On September 29, 2011, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled {{unanimously}} in Canada (AG) v PHS Community Services Society that Clement's {{decision to}} withdraw Insite's exemption under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act was [...] "arbitrary, undermining the very {{purposes of the}} CDSA, which include public health and safety. It is also grossly disproportionate: the potential denial of health services and the correlative increase {{in the risk of}} death and disease to injection drug users outweigh any benefit that might be derived from maintaining an absolute prohibition on possession of illegal drugs on Insite’s premises."

A campaign was started to get permission from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) to <b>grant</b> <b>an</b> <b>exemption</b> to the usual cattle movement restrictions in order to send the cows to the Sanctuary in Norfolk. The exemption was not granted despite the involvement of local Member of Parliament, Jim Fitzpatrick (former Minister for Defra).|$|E
