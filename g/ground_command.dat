5|$|On 25 June 1945, Wilson was {{replaced}} as assistant {{chief of staff}} by Major General Hoyt Vandenberg. For his service in the post, Wilson was awarded an oak leaf cluster to his Distinguished Service Medal. He was appointed to command the Air Force Proving <b>Ground</b> <b>Command.</b> At the time, some 22,000 airmen were assigned to this command.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, Wilson {{served as}} Chief of the Personnel Division (G-l) of the War Department General Staff. He became Chief of Staff of the Fifth Air Force in September 1942, before {{returning}} to the United States in 1944 to become Assistant Chief of Staff, United States Army Air Forces for Organization, Commitments and Requirements. For a time he was acting Chief of Staff of Army Air Forces. In February 1945, Wilson was present at the Battle of Iwo Jima as an official Army Air Forces observer. In June 1945, he assumed command of the Air Force Proving <b>Ground</b> <b>Command.</b>|$|E
5|$|Once it {{was clear}} that U.S. {{territory}} was not in danger of being attacked by enemy air units, Saville's expertise in air defense was not needed. In March 1943, he was made director of tactical development at the Army Air Forces School of Applied Tactics (AAFSAT) at Orlando, Florida, where he reorganized the Army Air Forces Board by July 2, 1943. Saville's structure put tactical and strategic development on equal footing, and tied together the efforts of the Chief of Air Staff for Operations, Commitments, and Requirements (OC), the Proving <b>Ground</b> <b>Command</b> and the School of Applied Tactics. Saville charged the AAFSAT with developing air defense doctrines and tactics, and with the testing of air defense equipment and methods.|$|E

50|$|In fortification, a <b>commanding</b> <b>ground</b> is an {{area that}} overlooks any post, or strong place. Of this there were three sorts: first, a front <b>commanding</b> <b>ground,</b> which is a height {{opposite}} to the face of the post, which plays upon its front; second, a reverse <b>commanding</b> <b>ground,</b> which is an eminence that can play upon the back of any place or post; and third, an enfilade <b>commanding</b> <b>ground,</b> or curtain <b>commanding</b> <b>ground,</b> which is a high place, that can with its shot scour all the length of a straight line.|$|R
5|$|In July 2013, the Air Force began a fleet-wide {{technological}} upgrade of its B-52 bombers called Combat Network Communications Technology (CONECT) {{to modernize}} electronics, communications technology, computing, and avionics {{on the flight}} deck. CONECT upgrades include software and hardware such as new computer servers, modems, radios, data-links, receivers, and digital workstations for the crew. One update is the ARC-210 Warrior beyond-line-of-sight software programmable radio able to transmit voice, data, and information in-flight between B-52s and <b>ground</b> <b>command</b> and control centers, allowing the transmission and reception of data with updated intelligence, mapping, and targeting information; previous in-flight target changes required copying down coordinates. The ARC-210 allows machine-to-machine transfer of data, useful on long-endurance missions where targets may have moved {{before the arrival of}} the B-52. The aircraft will be able to receive information through Link-16. CONECT upgrades will cost $1.1 billion overall and take several years. Funding has been secured for 30 B-52s; the Air Force hopes for 10 CONECT upgrades per year, but the rate has yet to be decided.|$|E

40|$|Humans can <b>ground</b> natural {{language}} <b>commands</b> to tasks at both abstract and fine-grained levels of specificity. For instance, a human forklift operator can be instructed {{to perform a}} high-level action, like "grab a pallet" or a lowlevel action like "tilt back a little bit. " While robots are also capable of <b>grounding</b> language <b>commands</b> to tasks, previous methods implicitly assume that all commands and tasks reside at a single, fixed level of abstraction. Additionally, those approaches that do not use abstraction experience inefficient planning and execution times due to the large, intractable state-action spaces, which closely resemble real world complexity. In this work, by <b>grounding</b> <b>commands</b> to all the tasks or subtasks available in a hierarchical planning framework, we arrive at a model capable of interpreting language at multiple levels of specificity ranging from coarse to more granular. We show that {{the accuracy of the}} grounding procedure is improved when simultaneously inferring the degree of abstraction in language used to communicate the task. Leveraging hierarchy also improves efficiency: our proposed approach enables a robot to respond to a command within one second on 90 % of our tasks, while baselines take over twenty seconds on half the tasks. Finally, we demonstrate that a real, physical robot can <b>ground</b> <b>commands</b> at multiple levels of abstraction allowing it to efficiently plan different subtasks within the same planning hierarchy...|$|R
25|$|Six F-100s {{arrived at}} the Air Proving <b>Ground</b> <b>Command,</b> Eglin Air Force Base in August 1954. The Air Force Operational Test Center was {{scheduled}} to use four of the fighters in operational suitability tests {{and the other two}} were to undergo armament tests by the Air Force Armament Center. The Tactical Air Division of AFOTC was conducing the APGC testing under the direction of project office Lieutenant Colonel Henry W. Brown. Initial testing was completed by APGC personnel at Edwards Air Force Base.|$|E
25|$|In 1950, the Air Force Armament Center was {{established}} at Eglin. After {{the start of}} the Korean War, test teams moved to the combat theater for testing in actual combat. In 1957, the Air Force combined the Air Proving <b>Ground</b> <b>Command</b> and the Air Force Armament Center to form the Air Proving Ground Center. In 1968, the Air Proving Ground Center was redesignated the Armament Development and Test Center to centralize responsibility for research, development, test and evaluation, and initial acquisition of nonnuclear munitions for the Air Force.|$|E
25|$|In September 1956, B-57E-MA Canberra, 55-4244, was {{assigned}} to the Air Force Operational Test Center at the Air Proving <b>Ground</b> <b>Command,</b> Eglin AFB, becoming a JB-57E for test missions. In December 1957, it transferred to the Air Proving Ground Center, Air Research and Development Command, at Eglin, reverting to a B-57E in October 1967, and finally to the Armament Development and Test Center of Air Force Systems Command in November 1968. Retired and dropped from the inventory in December 1969, it was sent as an exhibit to what is now the Strategic Air and Space Museum, Ashland, Nebraska.|$|E

25|$|Bids {{for a new}} {{control tower}} to be located near the {{southwest}} end of the old abandoned NE-SW runway at Eglin AFB were announced by Col. Walter W. Woodward, Deputy Chief of Staff for Material, Air Proving <b>Ground</b> <b>Command,</b> to be received by the Mobile District Office, Corps of Engineers, by 15 January 1957. The site is ~2,000 feet N of the center line of the new runway and 2,000 feet W of the existing runway. The height of the observation deck from the ground will be 62 feet, two inches. It was anticipated that the new tower would be completed in late summer or early fall.|$|E
25|$|Testing of {{the first}} B-25 Mitchell armed with 75mm cannon was {{completed}} by the Air Proving <b>Ground</b> <b>Command</b> on 26 March 1943. It had first flown 2 October 1942. B-25C-1, 41-13296, c/n 82-5931, the final airframe of the -1 production block, was modified as the XB-25G prototype, fitted with a 75-mm M4 cannon which was 9 feet 6 inches long. The transparent nose was replaced with a shortened armored solid nose that reduced overall length to 51 feet. The cannon was mounted in a cradle in the lower left-hand side of the nose, which extended underneath the pilot's seat with a spring mechanism forming part of the gun mount {{to take up the}} 21-inch recoil. The cannon-armed Mitchell would enjoy success in the Southwest Pacific theatre.|$|E
25|$|Lt. Col. Ashley C. McKinley, {{because of}} his {{experiences}} in ferrying aircraft to the Soviet Union, suggested in 1943 that all aircraft and equipment be operable at temperatures as low as −65°F (−54°C) and that a refrigerated hangar be erected at Eglin AFB to produce such an environment under controlled conditions. Since testing in Alaska was expensive and had produced only meager results, Col. McKinley reasoned that testing under controlled conditions would be far superior in useful results and up to ten times more economical. Construction of the Climatic Laboratory that allowed the Air Proving <b>Ground</b> <b>Command</b> to simulate virtually all climatic conditions “indoors” was completed 24 May 1947. Initial costs were estimated at nearly $2,000,000. The actual cost, {{at the end of}} construction, had risen to $5,500,000, indicative of the many problems encountered by the designers and builders. Testing began in May 1947. The first items tested included the Fairchild C-82 Packet, Boeing B-29 Superfortress, Lockheed F-80, North American P-51, Lockheed P-38, and the Sikorsky H-5D helicopter.|$|E
