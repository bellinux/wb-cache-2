25|$|When {{the parties}} express a clear {{intention}} in a choice-of-law clause, {{there is a}} rebuttable presumption {{that this is the}} proper law because it reflects the parties' freedom of contract and it produces certainty of outcome. It can only be rebutted when the choice is not bona fide, it produces illegality, or it breaches public policy. For example, the parties may have selected the particular law to evade the operation of otherwise mandatory provisions of the law which has the closest connection with the contract. The parties are not free to put themselves above the law and, in such cases, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> the parties to prove that there is a valid reason for selecting that law other than evasion.|$|E
25|$|It is not {{necessary}} for a trademark owner to take enforcement action against all infringement {{if it can be}} shown that the owner perceived the infringement to be minor and inconsequential. This is designed to prevent owners from continually being tied up in litigation for fear of cancellation. An owner can at any time commence action for infringement against a third party as long as it had not previously notified the third party of its discontent following third party use and then failed to take action within a reasonable period of time (called acquiescence). The owner can always reserve the right to take legal action until a court decides that the third party had gained notoriety which the owner 'must' have been aware of. <b>It</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> the third party to prove their use of the mark is substantial as it is the onus of a company using a mark to check they are not infringing previously registered rights. In the US, owing to the overwhelming number of unregistered rights, trademark applicants are advised to perform searches not just of the trademark register but of local business directories and relevant trade press. Specialized search companies perform such tasks prior to application.|$|E

[...] Internet reviewer James Berardinelli wrote a mixed critique. [...] "George Clooney is eager to show how much he has learned {{at the hands of}} the A-list filmmakers he has toiled under.

[...] In a centenary tribute in The Times Gerald Larner commented that Poulenc's prediction was wrong, and that in 1999 the composer was widely celebrated for both sides of his musical character: [...] "both the fervent Catholic and the naughty boy, for both the Gloria and Les Biches, both Les Dialogues des Carmélites and Les Mamelles de Tirésias." [...] At {{around the same time}} the writer Jessica Duchen described Poulenc as [...] "a fizzing, bubbling mass of Gallic energy who can move you to both laughter and tears within seconds.

500|$|Supported by {{troops from}} the rulers of Sogdia, Shash and Ferghana, the Turgesh {{attacked}} the Umayyad army within the pass, two days after they had left Kish (a Friday), {{at a distance of}} six farsakhs—ca. —from Samarkand. The Turgesh attacked while the Arab army had stopped to take a meal. The Arab vanguard, under Uthman ibn 'Abdallah ibn al-Shikhkhir, was overwhelmed, but Junayd was able to hurriedly deploy the main body of his army, placing his troops according to their tribal affiliations, with the Tamim and Azd on the right, and the Rabi'ah on the left. The Arabs hurriedly erected earthworks in front of their lines, and the initial Turgesh attack, directed against the Arab right, was pushed back. Junayd, who had placed himself in the centre to direct the battle, then joined the ranks of the Azd, who greeted him with hostility: their standard-bearer is reported to have told him [...] "If we win, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>for</b> your benefit; if we perish, you will not weep over us. By my life, if we win and I survive, I will never speak a word to you." [...] Al-Tabari reports that this man and seventeen successive bearers of the same standard were killed during the battle, indicative of the fierceness of the fight. The Arabs initially met the Turgesh attack on horseback, but as their casualties mounted, Junayd's herald ordered them to dismount and fight on foot, crouching down behind the trenches and forming a spear-wall. This measure helped the Muslims hold their ground, and eventually both sides wearied and the battle ceased for the day. The most grievous casualties among the Arabs were suffered by the stragglers and baggage, who gathered under Abdallah ibn Mu'ammar ibn Sumayr al-Yashkuri near Kish: they were attacked by the Turgesh and virtually annihilated.|$|E
