5000|$|Because of {{the cost}} of {{producing}} <b>digital-to-analogue</b> converters ("DACs") {{at the time of its}} production, the CDP-101 features only one DAC, which is used for both the left and right audio channels. There is no sample-and-hold circuitry to delay the first channel until the other is ready, so the left and right channels are out of sync by approximately 11 µs.|$|E
50|$|The {{idea was}} first {{described}} in 1964. In this, the 'ranging' {{was to be}} applied to the analogue signal before the analogue-to-digital converter (ADC) and after the <b>digital-to-analogue</b> converter (DAC). The application of this to broadcasting, in which the companding was to be done entirely digitally after the ADC and before the DAC, was described in a 1972 BBC Research Report.|$|E

50|$|In case of {{analogue}} pay-TV, {{this approach}} avoided {{the need for}} a second remote control. The use of digital television signals in more modern pay-TV schemes requires that decoding take place before the <b>digital-to-analogue</b> conversion step, rendering the video outputs of an analogue SCART connector no longer suitable for interconnection to decryption hardware. Standards such as DVB's Common Interface and ATSC's CableCARD therefore use a PCMCIA-like card inserted as part of the digital signal path as their alternative to a tuner-equipped set-top box.|$|E
5000|$|The {{fourth and}} current [...] "phase", the [...] "digital" [...] era, {{has seen the}} most rapid, {{dramatic}} and far-reaching series {{of changes in the}} history of audio recording. In a period of less than 20 years, all previous recording technologies were rapidly superseded by digital sound encoding, which was perfected by the Japanese electronics corporation Sony in the 1970s. Unlike all previous technologies, which captured a continuous analogue of the sounds being recorded, digital recording captured sound by means of a very dense and rapid series of discrete samples of the sound. When played back through a <b>digital-to-analogue</b> converter, these audio samples are recombined to form a continuous flow of sound. The first all-digitally-recorded popular music album, Ry Cooder's Bop 'Til You Drop, was released in 1979, and from that point, digital sound recording and reproduction quickly became the new standard at every level, from the professional recording studio to the home hi-fi.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} factors affect how precise a signal is, mainly the noise present in the {{original}} signal and the noise added by processing (see signal-to-noise ratio). Fundamental physical limits such as the shot noise in components limits the resolution of analogue signals. In digital electronics additional precision is obtained by using additional digits to represent the signal. The practical limit {{in the number of}} digits is determined by the performance of the analogue-to-digital converter (ADC), since digital operations can usually be performed without loss of precision. The ADC takes an analogue signal and changes it into a series of binary numbers. The ADC may be used in simple digital display devices, e. g., thermometers or light meters but it may also be used in digital sound recording and in data acquisition. However, a <b>digital-to-analogue</b> converter (DAC) is used to change a digital signal to an analogue signal. A DAC takes a series of binary numbers and converts it to an analogue signal. It is common to find a DAC in the gain-control system of an op-amp which in turn may be used to control digital amplifiers and filters.|$|E

40|$|The {{resistor}} ladder (R/ 2 R) <b>digital-to-analogue</b> converter (DAC) {{architecture is}} often used in high performance audio solutions due to its low-noise performance.

It was also suspected that this could improve audio quality in audio systems using R/ 2 R DACs for <b>digital-to-analogue</b> (A/D) conversion. Through the use of models of the resistor ladder architecture a way of characterizing and measuring the faults in the R/ 2 R DAC was created.
