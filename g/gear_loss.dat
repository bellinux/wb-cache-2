Waist harnesses are by far the most popular harnesses among advanced riders, although seat harnesses make it possible to kitesurf with less effort from the rider and vest harnesses provide both flotation and impact protection. Kite harnesses look similar to windsurfing harnesses, but are actually much different; a windsurfing harness used for kiteboarding is likely to break very quickly, which could result in injury and/or <b>gear</b> <b>loss.</b>|$|E

40|$|Substantial ecological, {{economic}} and social problems result from shark interactions in pelagic longline fisheries. Improved understanding of industry attitudes and practices towards shark interactions assists with managing these problems. Information on fisher knowledge and new strategies for shark avoidance may benefit sharks and fishers. A study of 12 pelagic longline fisheries from eight countries shows that incentives to avoid sharks vary along a continuum, based on whether sharks represent an economic disadvantage or advantage. Shark avoidance practices are limited, including avoiding certain areas, moving when shark interaction rates are high, using fish instead of squid for bait and deeper setting. Some conventionally employed fishing gear and methods used to target non-shark species contribute to shark avoidance. Shark repellents hold promise; more research and development is needed. Development of specifically designed equipment to discard sharks could improve shark post release survival prospects, reduce <b>gear</b> <b>loss</b> and improve crew safety.

40|$|The Common Octopus, Octopus vulgaris, is an r-selected mollusk found off {{the coast}} of North Carolina that {{interests}} commercial fishermen because of its market value and the cost-effectiveness of unbaited pots that can catch it. This study sought to: 1) determine those gear and environmental factors that influenced catch rates of octopi, and 2) evaluate the feasibility of small-scale commercial operations for this species. Pots were fished from August 2010 through September 2011 set in strings over hard and sandy bottom in waters from 18 to 30 m deep in Onslow Bay, N. C. Three pot types were fished in each string; octopus pots with- and without lids, and conch pots. Proportional catch was modeled as a function of gear design and environmental factors (location, soak time, bottom type, and sea surface water temperature) using binomially distributed generalized linear models (GLMâ€™s); parsimony of each GLM was assessed with Akaike Information Criteria (AIC). A total of 229 octopi were caught throughout the study. Pots with lids, pots without lids, and conch pots caught an average of 0. 15, 0. 17, and 0. 11 octopi, respectively, with high variability in catch rates for each pot type. The GLM that best fit the data described proportional catch as a function of sea surface temperature, soak time, and station; greatest proportional catches occurred over short soak times, warmest temperatures, and less well known reef areas. Due to operating expenses (fuel, crew time, and maintenance), low catch rates of octopi, and high <b>gear</b> <b>loss,</b> a directed fishery for this species is not economically feasible at the catch rates found in this study. The model fitting to determine factors most influential on catch rates should help fishermen determine seasons and gear soak times that are likely to maximize catch rates. Potting for octopi may be commercially practical as a supplemental activity when targeting demersal fish species that are found in similar habitats and depth ranges in coastal waters off North Carolina...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to develop a design tool for geared actuation systems that experience bidirectional exchange of energy with the environment. Despite the asymmetry of efficiency depending on the direction of power transfer in geared systems, typical dynamic models consider a fixed transmission efficiency for all conditions which can result in significant error depending on specific gear selection and the number of stages. This error can cause issues especially in dynamic legged robots and haptic devices when accurate force control is desired. In this paper we present directional impedance, a characteristic of geared transmissions in which the amount of power loss through the transmission differs according to the direction of power flow. Typical robots use electric motors with high gear reduction which introduces larger impedance when power flows from the output back to the motor than when the power flows from motor to output. To investigate the dependence on power flow direction, friction loss from gear teeth sliding in the gear mesh is modeled by a single gear tooth contact model and dynamic models are presented for each power transfer direction. Combinations of 0. 5 mod gears were tested in experiment over a range of sizes between 16 and 120 teeth to characterize the directional effects over multiple gear selections. The experiments confirmed that for a set of differently sized gears, power loss is greater when the larger gear drives the smaller one than in the reverse case, and the asymmetry was up to 17 % in the 16 and 120 tooth gear set. With a multiple stage gearbox, the difference in loss is further amplified. These findings show that directional loss in gears is a non-negligible effect and must be considered in both dynamic modeling and gear selection of robotic actuators. The <b>gear</b> <b>loss</b> model enables the modeling of motor and gearbox as a single package which can then be optimized for desired performance parameters such as peak torque, torque per mass, and mechanical impedance. by Albert Duan Wang.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} effects of {{development}} projects on traditional natural resource use in three communities in Northeast Thailand, a region known as Isan. I interviewed villagers in each community {{and asked them to}} describe their environmental perceptions, management practices and livelihood strategies. Participants described several subsistence livelihoods that have traditionally been present in Isan. These include rice farming, fishing, community forestry, and wetland use. Residents from the three communities all described various cultural activities, knowledge systems, and religious ceremonies that are closely tied to their local resources. Raising silk worms, making clay pots, and performing rituals for a spirit that presides over their rice fields are all examples of how natural resources play a part in the culture of Isan. Interviewees also noted a traditional community structure shaped by the relationships of trade, communal property, shared labor, and plentiful food sources. Through a series of interviews with elders in each community, the change in resource use and management is described. The results show that development projects over the past fifty years have altered access to resources and the subsistence livelihoods dependent on them. The management of resources, such as forests and rivers, shifted from the community level to the national government, against {{the will of the people}} with whom I spoke. Villagers in all communities expressed a desire to be included in the decision-making process and several of them are currently struggling to regain rights to use their local resources. Development projects discussed include the Green Revolution, the building of dams, and the creation of tree plantations. Although the specifics of each community differ, there was an overall belief that these projects have degraded the environment, the culture, and the communities themselves. Examples of impact on Isan culture include: decreased use of traditional fishing <b>gear,</b> <b>loss</b> of indigenous rice varieties, and the breakdown of traditional community structures. The majority of villagers noted that in the past they were able to sustain themselves almost entirely from their local resources, but that no longer is the case. Urban migration has increased rapidly as rural livelihoods are less successful and young people must go to the city to find work. It is common to find a village of elders and young children, with the majority of the working class living in Bangkok or abroad. I end my paper with a brief summary of a grassroots effort I helped to initiate in an urban community. The project was born from the comments of many Thai elders who expressed concern that their environmental knowledge would die with them. My aim was to re-integrate traditional environmental knowledge in an urban setting. I collaborated with a vibrant group of teachers and community members to plan and create a school garden. This garden now serves as an outdoor classroom where children cultivate Isan staples such as chili peppers, lemongrass, and basil. People of Isan have long been proud of their heritage as farmers, and it is inspiring to know that even for urban families this tradition has proven its resilience...|$|E

The method developed by Anderson & Loewenthal which considers efficiency over part-load conditions is used here to calculate geartrain losses with varying speed, load and temperature conditions in a spur gear type gearbox for motorsport application.

40|$|Long haul trucks spend (almost) 80 % {{of their}} time {{cruising}} from one destination to another. This means that they drive mostly at a constant speed and use their top gear most of the time. Depending on the gearbox, the top gear of long haul trucks is usually direct drive gear. With the direct drive <b>gear</b> <b>losses</b> mainly come from the interaction between lubricant and rotating <b>gear</b> (churning <b>losses).</b> It is obvious that using {{a small amount of}} low viscosity lubricant will reduce the churning losses dramatically. Unfortunately the solution is not as simple as that. This is because, besides lubrication, the lubricant is also there as a cooling agent. Hence, too little oil will affect the heat dissipation and the lifetime of the gear. Studies of oil flow inside the gearbox are needed to find ways to reduce churning losses and good heat dissipation. A simplified version of a gearbox is built to study the flow, due to the complexity of the real gearbox. The new gearbox consists of a gear pair and has transparent rectangular walls to ensure good optical access. Velocity measurements with particle image velocimetry (PIV) are made to get the velocity field around the gear. Flash photography is done, as additional data, to study the flow distribution. Finally, torque measurements are made to measure the losses. It was found in the PIV study that oil flow is dominated by a recirculation region. The recirculation is suspected to be the source of viscous losses. The oil flow inside the gearbox is highly three dimensional. Stereo-PIV has successfully revealed the third components of the flow. PIV measurements also reveal that the squeezing of the oil at the gear contact is considered minor compare to the losses due to recirculation. From flash photography, the splash pattern and oil distribution is studied. The oil distribution inside the gearbox is governed by a gear with a larger diameter. The larger diameter gear splashes more oil compared to the smaller one. This is most probably because the larger diameter gear is more immersed compared to the smaller diameter gear. Hence, the larger diameter gear drags more oil upward. Torque measurements show that the torque is dependent on the rotational speed, the immersion depth, and the oil properties. The oil properties are suspected to be changed when the oil is aerated, resulting in a higher torque reading...|$|R

The investor may enter into such an arrangement and expect the tax benefits (if any) and the capital gain on the investment, when the investment is ultimately disposed of, to exceed the accumulated losses of holding the investment. The investor would take into account the tax treatment of negative gearing, which may generate additional benefits to the investor in the form of tax benefits if the loss on a negatively geared investment is tax-deductible against the investor's other taxable income and if the capital gain on the sale is given a favourable tax treatment.

The electrification process is supported by an improvement of the performance of the CNG engine (the actual average value is about 38 %) : this number is expected to rise by 4 % thanks to the engine control strategy improvement, by 1 % due to the introduction of the water charge air cooler, by 2 % from the reduction of the belt drive and <b>gear</b> <b>losses,</b> by 1 % from the system strategy and management optimization and by 7 % from the exhaust heat recovery (thermo-electric generator plus turbo-generator). This paper presents the details of the new powertrain concept design, the simulation tool developed to support the design and optimize the system and a cost per function tool to perform an economic analysis in the hypothesis to introduce the system in the market. The obtained benefits are expressed in terms of fuel saving for a target real driving cycle and effects related to the new devices are developed and tested. The project is in the design phase and the paper collects a first estimation of results based on the design, strategy and control improvement...|$|R
40|$|Research PaperThe 2004 and 2005 {{hurricane}} seasons {{have been}} particularly devastating to the Gulf Coast region of the U. S. During 2004, hurricanes Charley and Ivan, among others, took dead aim at the Florida Gulf coast and caused excessive structural damage to residences and near-shore structures. These storms in general missed the major commercial and recreational fisheries centers of the state, though near-shore aquaculture operations in Florida were devastated. Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005 took swipes at Florida as they spun off to the north with devastating consequences to the commercial and recreational fishing industries of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. Entire communities, along with their shore-side infrastructure and fleets were virtually eliminated in coastal Louisiana and Mississippi. Almost ignored after the devastation created by earlier storms during 2005 was hurricane Wilma, whose impact was confined to the Florida coast. Hurricane Wilma cut a swath across the lower Florida peninsula, impacting primarily the regions of the state located below Lake Okeechobee. The damages, though severe in certain locations, were less structural in nature, and more disruptive in terms of power outages, road closures, transportation delays, local flooding, etc. However, hurricane Wilma virtually eliminated the trap fishery gear within the Florida Keys. The lobster and stone crab trap fisheries are the most valuable fisheries in the region. Without the gear, and relief funds to replace the gear, the fisheries have almost ceased to operate. This presentation will document the losses estimated for the Florida Keys trap fisheries {{as a result of}} hurricane Wilma. Attempts to achieve recognition of the <b>gear</b> <b>losses</b> by the industry and frustrations with attempted requests for federal assistance will be described. The findings of a recent NOAA/Sea Grant/Industry workshop will be described which provides some insight from outside and within federal/state relief agencies as to how the existing relief system may function on a more effective and timely basis. The presentation will also attempt to compare and contrast the fisheries-related disaster relief efforts attempted by the various states impacted by the 2005 hurricane season...|$|R
