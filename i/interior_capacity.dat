Clues to gut granule function include their acidic <b>interior</b> and <b>capacity</b> for endocytosis, both lysosome-like features (though gut granules are much bigger than normal lysosomes).

This paper is a continuation of a previous work that has been extended so that the optimal scheduler algorithm adapts its steps to the actual estimated <b>interior</b> heat <b>capacity</b> of the refrigerator (which depends on the food quantity, food temperature, etc. in the interior). It is shown that the proposed adaptive MPC based scheduling algorithm gives a better performance (with respect to price) as opposed to the scheduling algorithm having no precise knowledge of the actual load of the refrigerator. Moreover, due to the adaptive behavior it was possible to decrease the running time of the optimal scheduler algorithm compared to the non-adaptive version...|$|R
40|$|The {{practice}} of teleworking, {{established by the}} spread of Information and Communication Technology, has taken on even more importance with the current international economic crisis. Some of the workspace lost from offices because {{of the growth of}} teleworking has been regained {{in the form of the}} so-called SoHo - Small Office Home Office – which is situated within the domestic environment and used either for tele-dependent work or for a Home Based Business. Alternatively this fragmentation of the workplace may also become re-formulated in new formats of space sharing, which evolve from models of co-working. The design of these interiors is often linked to the {{practice of}} adaptive re-use of existing spaces and, therefore, consists of making a transitional arrangement of interiors using objects and furnishings. This approach allows people to continuously reassess the <b>interior’s</b> functional <b>capacity</b> to absorb the consequences of modifications in lifestyle, social relationships and production systems. On a larger scale, teleworking poses a problem for the interplay between the architectural typology and the activities taking place within interior spaces, making it difficult to perceive how the city functions and introducing the need for new tools for investigating and monitoring the way cities work...|$|R

40|$|Techniques for {{determining}} large transbilayer pH gradients (delta pH) and membrane potentials (delta psi) induced {{in response to}} delta pH in large unilamellar vesicle liposomal systems by measuring the transbilayer redistribution of radiolabeled compounds have been examined. For liposomes with acidic interiors, it is shown that protocols using radiolabeled methylamine in conjunction with gel filtration procedures to remove untrapped methylamine provide accurate measures of delta pH in most situations. Exceptions include gel state lipid systems, where transbilayer equilibration processes are slow, and situations where the <b>interior</b> buffering <b>capacity</b> is limited. These problems can be circumvented by incubation at elevated temperatures and by using probes with higher specific activities, respectively. Determination of delta pH in vesicles with a basic interior using weak acid probes such as radiolabeled acetate in conjunction with gel filtration {{was found to be}} less reliable, and an alternative equilibrium centrifugation protocol is described. In the case of determinations of the membrane potentials induced in response to these pH gradients, probes such as tetraphenylphosphonium and thiocyanate provide relatively accurate measures of the delta psi induced. It is shown that the maximum transmembrane pH gradient that can be stably maintained by an egg phosphatidylcholine-cholesterol 100 -nm-diam large unilamellar vesicle is approximately 3. 7 units, corresponding to an induced delta psi of 220 mV or transbilayer electrical field of 5 x 10 (5) V/cm...|$|R

5000|$|Capacity {{is defined}} by the Oxford English Dictionary as [...] "the measure applied to the content of a vessel, and to liquids, grain, or the like, which take the shape of that which holds them". (The word {{capacity}} has other unrelated meanings, as in e.g. capacity management.) Capacity is not identical in meaning to volume, though closely related; the capacity of a container is always the volume in its <b>interior.</b> Units of <b>capacity</b> are the SI litre and its derived units, and Imperial units such as gill, pint, gallon, and others. Units of volume are the cubes of units of length. In SI the units of volume and capacity are closely related: one litre is exactly 1 cubic decimetre, the capacity of a cube with a 10 cm side. In other systems the conversion is not trivial; the capacity of a vehicle's fuel tank is rarely stated in cubic feet, for example, but in gallons (a gallon fills a volume of 0.1605 cu ft).|$|R
