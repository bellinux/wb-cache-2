40|$|The Ball Hogs {{competed in}} Task 2 - Haul <b>Truck</b> <b>Tires</b> in the 2016 Waste-Management Education and Research Consortium (WERC) International Environmental Design Contest. This task {{required}} designing {{a solution to}} recycle discarded haul <b>truck</b> <b>tires</b> from mining sites. Our solution was to use the treads of these haul <b>truck</b> <b>tires</b> to construct liners for ball mills. Recycling haul <b>truck</b> <b>tires</b> in this manner would save the mining companies {{a substantial amount of}} money and would result in a decrease of carbon emissions...|$|R

Their {{aim is to}} flatten <b>truck</b> <b>tires</b> using pea shooters with pins in the peas so that everyone {{can see that the}} trucks are the cause of the traffic problems. One peddler, Frank the Flower, is arrested and falsely confesses that he shot all 18,991 of the <b>truck</b> <b>tires.</b> After his arrest, the peddlers give up the Pea-Shooter Campaign. But soon, inspired by Frank's arrest, children join in the sabotage of <b>truck</b> <b>tires.</b> The movie star, Wenda Gambling, also comes out in support of the peddlers.|$|R

40|$|Using scrap tires as {{construction}} materials in civil engineering is of growing interest. Whole scrap tires {{have been used}} as culverts, retaining walls, and for slope and beach stabilization. Shredded tires {{have been used as}} horizontal drains, ravine crossings, highway embankments, lightweight backfill, and road bed support. The practice of these applications needs the engineering properties of scrap tires. This dissertation involves the quantification of the structural and hydraulic properties of whole <b>truck</b> <b>tires</b> as underground culverts, the derivation of a new stress-strain relationship for low-stiffness flexible pipes and its application to a <b>truck</b> <b>tire</b> culvert, and the investigation and integration of the mechanical properties of shredded tire material.

40|$|Trucking fleets {{and owners}} of {{commercial}} vehicles utilize both new and retread tires on their {{vehicles in the}} United States. Retread tires are used primarily for the cost advantage they provide over a similar new tire. Despite the advantages that retreaded tires may bring, public perception is that retread tires are less safe than new tires {{as evidenced by the}} amount of tire debris frequently found on the sides of U. S. Interstate highways. During summer 2007, the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute (UMTRI) under a subcontract from Virginia Tech Transportation Institute (VTTI) collected and studied <b>truck</b> <b>tire</b> debris and discarded tire casings from five sites in the United States. A random sample (totaling 1, 496 items) of the tire debris/casings collected was analyzed to determine the probable cause of failure and its original equipment or retread status. This report presents the methodology and results from this investigation into the underlying causes of <b>truck</b> <b>tire</b> failures and gives an overview of the crash safety problem associated with heavy-truck tire failures. Also, background information on the manufacture of a <b>truck</b> <b>tire,</b> the <b>truck</b> <b>tire</b> retread industry, tire failure modes, industry stakeholder perspectives, an overview of other previous tire debris studies, conclusions, and recommendations for topics for further research are given...|$|R

50|$|Polybutadiene {{is largely}} used {{in various parts}} of {{automobile}} tires; the manufacture of tires consumes about 70% of the world production of polybutadiene, with a majority of it being high cis. The polybutadiene is used primarily in the sidewall of <b>truck</b> <b>tires,</b> this helps to improve fatigue to failure life due to the continuous flexing during run. As a result, tires will not blow out in extreme service conditions. It is also used in the tread portion of giant <b>truck</b> <b>tires</b> to improve the abrasion, i.e. less wearing, and to run the tire comparatively cool, since the internal heat comes out quickly. Both parts are formed by extrusion.|$|R
