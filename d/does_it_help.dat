[...] "We had a big debate {{about whether or not}} that should go into the film", O'Connor explained. Water continued, [...] "it {{was one of those things}} where to see it, it just gets you. But we had to ask ourselves, <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>help</b> our story? No." [...] Footage that was nearly edited out included a scene where Anwar had to siphon petrol out of the family car for the house's generator. Anwar explained to the camera that he needed to do it because their family was so poor. [...] "That's tough", commented Water, [...] "because that's a dishonour to his family." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to The New York Times, [...] "the {{only real}} {{weakness}} of the book lies in the stringent rationality of Kreizler's investigation. The more his logic makes sense the less threatening his quarry seems, {{at least to the}} reader....The story's fatalism grows tedious....Nor <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>help</b> that throughout most of the story none of the major characters are directly threatened by the killer. Of course, it is deplorable that children are being murdered. But none of them figure strongly enough in the story to arouse the reader's visceral identification." [...] Scott Eyman of The Palm Beach Post was critical of the [...] "flaccid dialogue" [...] and [...] "vague characters". Hary Levins from the St. Louis Post-Dispatch noted that the novel does include a few notable anachronisms. For example, the [...] "heroes display an early (and highly improbable) political correctness toward blacks and homosexuals. And his detective team anticipates the feminist movement by enlisting a tough-minded career woman who's unafraid to pack a pistol and spout a bit of scatological English." ...|$|E

'First of all, {{what has}} to be {{explained}} is not the growing up of a tree from one or the other member of a god or hero, but the total change of a human being or a heroine into a tree, and this under a certain provocation. These two classes of plant-legends must be carefully kept apart. Secondly, what <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>help</b> us to know that people in Mangaia believed in the change of human beings into trees, if we do not know the reason why? This is what we want to know; and without it the mere juxtaposition of stories apparently similar is no more than the old trick of explaining ignotum per ignotius. It leads us to imagine that we have learnt something, when we really are as ignorant as before.|$|E

60|$|I would respectfully demur or suggest delay. Can {{we explain}} an American institution, a fairly world-wide institution, totemism, {{by the local}} peculiarities of belief in {{isolated}} Australia? If, in America, to kill a wolf was to kill Uncas or Chingachgook, I would incline to agree with Mr. Frazer. But no such evidence is adduced. Nor <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>help</b> Mr. Frazer to plead that the killing of an American's nagual or of a Zulu's Ihlozi kills that Zulu or American. For a nagual, as I have shown, is one thing and a totem is another; nor am I aware that Zulus are totemists. The argument of Mr. Frazer is based on analogy and on a special instance. That instance of the Australians is so archaic that it may show totemism in an early form. Mr. Frazer's may be a correct hypothesis, but it needs corroboration. However, Mr. Frazer concludes: 'The totem, if I am right, is simply the receptacle in which a man keeps his life.' Yet he never shows that a Choctaw does keep his life in his totem. Perhaps the Choctaw is afraid to let out so vital a secret. The less reticent Australian blurts it forth. Suppose the hypothesis correct. Men and women keep their lives in their naguals, private sacred beasts. But why, on this score, should a man be afraid {{to make love to}} a woman of the same nagual? Have Red Indian women any naguals? I never heard of them.|$|E

50|$|A {{somewhat}} more sophisticated reasoning about deeper causes of armed conflicts - as e.g. local social struggles, {{cultural and religious}} unrest and differences are completely neglected. Instead Zischka and his followers set up a popular and easy digestible amalgam of pauschalities and combined anti-Americanism, anti-Globalization with a radiating technocratic vision.

50|$|As {{someone who}} teaches {{behavioural}} ecology to biologists, and primate biology {{to social and}} biological anthropologists, I will be strongly recommending this book to all of my advanced undergraduates, masters and PhD students, {{as well as to}} my colleagues. Not only <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>help</b> to resolve debates that have run for many years, but it is also an outstanding example of what can be achieved by immersing oneself in literature from different fields, while retaining an intellectual openness and exercising incisive analysis. Many of us talk enthusiastically about inter- and multi-disciplinarity, but often this is not much more than lip service. This book is a shining example of what can be achieved when excellent scholars engage fully across disciplinary boundaries. There should be more texts like this.|$|E

Her most popular books, Babies, Baby Animals, A to Z Picture Book and Oh!, What A Busy Day!, unfailingly represent a happy, detailed version of childhood. Her joyous illustrations remain sweet and nostalgic, without ever becoming overly saccharine. Her paintings of children are recognizable for round happy faces, rosy cheeks and simple dot eyes. Discussing her respect for her audience, she said: [...] "In illustrating for children, what I relish most is trying to satisfy the constant question {{in the back of}} my mind--will this picture capture a child's imagination?
