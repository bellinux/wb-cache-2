5|$|Due to {{a change}} in {{election}} law approved by Jersey City voters at the end of 2016, mayoral elections will now take place in November, with the next election scheduled for November 2017. Although the mayorship has historically been a four-year term in Jersey City, and although current law prescribes the mayorship as being a four-year term in the future, due to the calendar change in elections, the current mayorship is a four-and-a-half-year term, beginning July 2013 and ending at the end of 2017. The winner of the November 2017 mayoral <b>election</b> <b>will</b> take office January 1, 2018.|$|E

5|$|Since the {{constitutional}} amendments made in 2016, a presidential <b>election</b> <b>will</b> {{be reserved for}} a community in Singapore if no one from that community has been President {{for any of the}} five most recent terms of office of the President. The communities are the Chinese community, the Malay community, and the Indian or other minority communities. Candidates are required to satisfy the usual qualification criteria. The 2017 election was the first reserved election, and was reserved for the Malay community.|$|E
5|$|Elections for {{president}} occur {{every five years}} by a national vote. Candidates, {{as soon as they}} are deemed eligible under Article 80 of the Constitution, are tasked with collecting signatures from eligible voters. After 100,000 signatures are collected and certified, the candidate is declared to be official by the Central Elections Committee. In the voting, the secret ballots are collected directly from eligible voters. During the first round of voting, if a candidate earns fifty percent plus one of the votes, they are declared the President-elect. If no one has achieved that number during the first round, then a run-off <b>election</b> <b>will</b> occur between two candidates who won the most votes. The person who wins the most votes in the run-off is declared the President-elect.|$|E

25|$|The 2017 County Council {{elections}} saw a county-wide wipeout of UKIP. The Conservative Party profited {{most from}} this loss, regaining {{many of the}} seats it had lost at the previous election. Labour, despite a slight rise in {{its share of the}} vote, returned with fewer councillors. The Liberal Democrats also saw a notable revival, but were unable to translate this into seats. The Conservatives retained firm control of the council. The next <b>election</b> <b>will</b> be in 2021.|$|E

25|$|The Twenty-second Amendment prohibits {{anyone from}} being elected {{president}} {{for a third}} term. It also prohibits a person from being elected to the presidency more than once if that person previously had served as president, or acting president, {{for more than two}} years of another person's term as president. In all, 44 individuals have served 45 presidencies (counting Grover Cleveland's two non-consecutive terms separately) spanning 57 full four-year terms. Incumbent Donald Trump was elected on Tuesday, November 8, 2016. The next presidential <b>election</b> <b>will</b> be held on Tuesday, November 3, 2020.|$|E
25|$|Clearly, the September <b>election</b> <b>will</b> be {{determined}} by factors which are {{deeply rooted in the}} political, economic, and social fabric of the Chilean scene and by the campaign abilities of the major contenders. Given the consequences, however, if this major Latin American nation should become the first country in the hemisphere to freely choose an avowed Marxist as its elected president, the Department, CIA, and other agencies have embarked on a major campaign to prevent Allende's election and to support Frei, the only candidate who has a chance of beating him.|$|E
25|$|The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress vote in December 2007 {{to allow}} {{universal}} suffrage by 2017, and full Legislative Council elections by 2020, tempered {{the debate on}} universal suffrage. Wary of political parties, the government sought to defer discussion on other highly sensitive issues until October 2008, {{in the hopes that}} the <b>election</b> <b>will</b> be void of focus. The election was therefore fought over issues regarding the minimum wage, health care reform, Old Age Allowance, and the future of RTHK. Also, the case surrounding former Housing Director Leung Chin-man served to highlight the issue of systematic checks and balances, and the lack of political scrutiny of government actions.|$|E

25|$|The Prime Minister's {{power to}} {{determine}} the election date can give the government some subtle advantages. For example, if governing parties believe that {{a section of the}} population will either vote against them or not at all, they might hold the election in early spring, when the weather may well keep less-committed voters away from the polls. Party strategists take the timing of important rugby union matches into account, partly because a major match in the same weekend of the <b>election</b> <b>will</b> likely lower voting-levels, and partly because of a widespread belief that incumbent governments benefit from a surge of national pride when the All Blacks (the New Zealand national rugby team) win and suffer when they lose.|$|E
25|$|An <b>election</b> <b>will</b> {{also take}} {{place for the}} Committee for Programme and Coordination for three-year terms. The 7 {{outgoing}} members are: Comoros, France, Haiti, Israel, Namibia, Russia and Venezuela.

These were: Botswana and Tanzania (African group); Russia (Eastern European group); Peru (Latin American and Caribbean group); and France (Western Europe and Others group). Another Eastern European and Western Europe and Others members were due to be chosen later. They will join the other states already on the committee: Algeria, Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Belarus, Benin, Brazil, Bulgaria, Cameroon, China, Cuba, Eritrea, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Iran, Italy, Japan, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Pakistan, South Korea, Moldova, Uruguay and Zimbabwe. The new term will begin on 1 January 2013 in accordance with paragraph 7 of the General Assembly resolution 60/251.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{findings}} of the report and Masuzoe's admission, public discontent continued to rise {{in the first half of}} June 2016, with at least 70 per cent of Tokyo residents seeking his resignation. Masuzoe lost the support of his former backers, the LDP and Komeito parties, as they feared negative consequences in the national House of Councillors election to be held on 10 July and the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly election the following year. On the afternoon of 15 June 2016, a no-confidence motion jointly submitted by all parties, including the LDP and Komeito, was to be voted upon in the Metropolitan Assembly. Despite publicly stating his refusal to step down the previous day, citing more time for public consideration, Masuzoe ultimately submitted his resignation effective 21 June to assembly president Shigeo Kawai on the morning of 15 June 2016. Another reason Masuzoe gave for seeking to delay his resignation was the pending Olympic Games in Rio, Brazil, which he was scheduled to attend as the representative of Tokyo, the host of the 2020 Summer Olympics. If the election of his replacement is held in July 2016, then the subsequent <b>election</b> <b>will</b> happen in July 2020, in the middle of the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games.|$|E
