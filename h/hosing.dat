5|$|Unmanned {{boats were}} the first vessels to enter the lagoon. Onboard {{instruments}} allowed remote-controlled radiation measurements to be made. When support ships entered the lagoon for evaluation, decontamination, and salvage activities, they steered clear of lagoon water hot spots detected by the drone boats. The standard for radiation exposure to personnel {{was the same as}} that used by the Manhattan Project: 0.1 roentgens per day. Because of this constraint, only the five most distant target ships could be boarded on the first day. The closer-in ships were hosed down by Navy fireboats using saltwater and flame retardants. The first <b>hosing</b> reduced radioactivity by half, but subsequent hosings were ineffective. For most of the ships, reboarding had to wait until the short-lived radioisotopes decayed; ten days elapsed before the last of the targets could be boarded.|$|E
25|$|Horses with bandage bows usually {{respond to}} sweats or poultices. These {{treatments}} must be applied under a bandage {{that is not}} tightly fitted and the bandage should only be left on for a few hours. Cold <b>hosing,</b> NSAIDs and DMSO may also help.|$|E
25|$|Biofouled nets are {{replaced}} {{after several months}} of service, depending on environmental conditions, in a complicated, costly, and labor-intensive operation that involves divers and specialized personnel. During this process, live fish in nets must be transferred to clean pens, which causes undue stress and asphyxiation that results in some loss of fish. Biofouled nets that can be reused are washed on land via manual brushing and scrubbing or high-pressure water <b>hosing.</b> They are then dried and re-impregnated with antifouling coatings.|$|E

25|$|Horses may acquire cellulitis, usually {{secondarily}} to a wound (which can {{be extremely}} small and superficial) or to a deep-tissue infection, such as an abscess or infected bone, tendon sheath, or joint. Cellulitis from a superficial wound usually creates less lameness (grade 1–2 of 5) than that caused by septic arthritis (grade 4–5). The horse exhibits inflammatory edema, which is hot, painful swelling. This swelling differs from stocking up in that the horse does not display symmetrical swelling in two or four legs, but in only one leg. This swelling begins near the source of infection, but eventually continues down the leg. In some cases, the swelling also travels distally. Treatment includes cleaning the wound and caring for it properly, the administration of NSAIDs, such as phenylbutazone, cold <b>hosing,</b> applying a sweat wrap or a poultice, and mild exercise. Veterinarians may also prescribe antibiotics.|$|E
500|$|Warren also {{observed}} that the radsafe procedures were not being followed correctly. Fire boats got {{too close to the}} target ships they were <b>hosing</b> and drenched their crews with radioactive spray. One fire boat had to be taken out of service. Film badges showed 67 overdoses between August 6 and 9. More than half of the 320 Geiger counters available shorted out and became unavailable. [...] The crews of two target ships, [...] and , moored far from the detonation site, had moved back on board and become overexposed. [...] They were immediately evacuated back to the United States.|$|E
