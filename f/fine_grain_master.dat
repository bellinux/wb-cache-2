50|$|A <b>fine</b> <b>grain</b> <b>master</b> {{positive}} is {{a photographic}} term. It {{is also known}} as a <b>fine</b> <b>grain</b> <b>master</b> or fine grain and is a high-definition black-and-white intermediate positive image generated from a negative for the purpose of creating additional duplicate negatives. This intermediate element is exposed and chemically processed to a photographic gamma that will permit duplicate negatives as close to the original as is possible by a photochemical process.|$|E

40|$|It {{is known}} that <b>fine</b> <b>grain</b> steel {{possesses}} high strength according to Hall-Petch relation and therefor many researchers are examining to use the <b>fine</b> <b>grain</b> steel on civil engineering and architecture fields as next generation's high strength material. Then the evaluation of corrosion resistance property to <b>fine</b> <b>grain</b> steel is very important. In this study, Stress Corrosion Cracking test was done on specimens of the <b>fine</b> <b>grain</b> steel and conventional steel.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the effect of <b>fine</b> <b>grains</b> on creep property of lamellar orientation controlled Ti- 43 mol% Al alloy, compressive creep tests were performed. Uniaxial compression process at αSingle-phase region and related compression process at (α＋γ) two-phase region made the lamellar interface almost parallel to the compression process plane. <b>Fine</b> <b>grains</b> were observed around the orientation controlled lamellar colonies after the process at (α＋γ) two-phase region. Volume fraction of <b>fine</b> <b>grains</b> increased with the decrease in true strain rate during the process. Further, in the same true strain rate, volume fraction of <b>fine</b> <b>grains</b> increased with the increase in true strain. These characteristics were almost the same in the case of dynamic recrystallization at the single-phase alloy. Thus, the formation of <b>fine</b> <b>grains</b> at (α＋γ) two phase region may indicate the occurrence of dynamic recrystallization. Minimum creep rate of the processed material increased with the increase in volume fraction of <b>fine</b> <b>grains.</b> The increase of creep rate of the entire material {{may be due to the}} preferential creep deformation of formed <b>fine</b> <b>grains</b> by a diffusional creep mechanism...|$|R

40|$|The 75 -μm {{particle}} size {{is used to}} discriminate between <b>fine</b> and coarse <b>grains.</b> Further analysis of <b>fine</b> <b>grains</b> is typically based on the plasticity chart.

50|$|The {{film was}} mostly {{forgotten}} to history {{until the early}} 1980s, when the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, which housed the 65mm nitrate original camera negative, wanted to preserve the film but {{found that it was}} too shrunken and fragile to be copied due to lack of real preservation, and that no film lab would touch it. Karl Malkames, a cinematographic specialist and pioneer in film reproduction, restoration, and preservation designed and built a special printer to handle the careful frame-by-frame reproduction of the negative to a 35mm anamorphic CinemaScope <b>fine</b> <b>grain</b> <b>master</b> to duplicate the original 70mm process. The printer copied at a speed of one frame a second, leading to the film's year-long process in preserving its original look.|$|E
5000|$|This {{is a large}} {{collection}} of nitrate negatives and masters, which are still undergoing transfer to acetate stock. Most of the safety film copies exist only in the preservation master stage, limiting accessibility for viewing and duplication. Some years ago, LC obtained 16mm prints (unfortunately, many are television prints, flat in picture quality and occasionally edited) for pre-1950 Warner Bros. features (among {{the most popular of}} all American films). Additional prints {{have been added to the}} collection, ranging from [...] "reject <b>fine</b> <b>grain</b> <b>master</b> positives" [...] (copies made for preservation but deemed inadequate) suitable for reference use, to high-quality 35mm prints reserved for theatrical projection. United Artists also donated 16mm prints of most of the Warner Bros. and Monogram films to the Wisconsin Center for Film and Theater Research, such as My Four Years in Germany (1918), Conductor 1492 (1924), Midnight Lovers (1926) and Joe Palooka in Triple Cross (1951).|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Recently, {{the study}} of <b>fine</b> <b>grain</b> steels aimed at {{achieving}} into high strength has become active. Welding {{is one of the}} most effective methods for connecting the structural components. For those cases, the negative influence of any residual tensile stress induced during the welding process must be considered. It has been proved that shot-peening can effectively solve this problem. However, the influence of the Shot-Peening process on <b>fine</b> <b>grain</b> steels after welding has only been briefly reported up to now. In this study, <b>fine</b> <b>grain</b> steels were used, and specimens were obtained after heat treatment. Residual stress distributions near the surface of the <b>fine</b> <b>grain</b> steel after shot-peening were measured by X-ray diffraction technology. Moreover, the effect of hardness on distributions near the shot-peened surface was also estimated...|$|R
40|$|The {{possibility}} of using middle size grains (diameter equal to 10 - 30 micrometer) in thermoluminescence (TL) dating of pottery was discussed.

The natural TL intensity of the middle grain fraction is found to be twice higher than that of the <b>fine</b> <b>grain</b> fraction for the same sample.

40|$|International audienceThe {{most popular}} Moore's law formulation, which states {{the number of}} {{transistors}} on integrated circuits doubles every 18 months, is said to hold {{for at least another}} two decades.

40|$|AbstractThe {{spatial and}} {{seasonal}} distributions {{of organic matter}} and <b>fine</b> <b>grains</b> were tested as possible determinants of fauna distribution in bed sediment of a Hercynian gravel stream. Invertebrate densities and the amounts of <b>fine</b> <b>grains</b> and organic carbon were assessed in freeze-core samples taken along 70 cm depth profiles at three different positions in the stream channel. Sampling was conducted on five occasions of low discharge over two years. The variability in invertebrate community composition was analysed using Detrended Correspondence Analysis with posterior projection of explanatory variables; Variation Partitioning was used to estimate the independent and shared effects of the explanatory variables. We found that the best predictors of the invertebrate community were spatial variables (depth, position in the channel) and then variables influenced by seasonal patterns (surface water temperature and discharge). The influence of organic matter and <b>fine</b> <b>grain</b> content was significant only after eliminating spatial autocorrelation. High amounts of organic matter, randomly accumulated in the sediment, improved the model by explaining high fauna densities. The <b>fine</b> <b>grain</b> content was not a limiting factor to fauna at our study site. It {{is possible that the}} large amount of mica flakes in the sediment has caused the arrangement of grains with a pore space sufficient for fauna even when <b>fine</b> <b>grain</b> content was high...|$|R
