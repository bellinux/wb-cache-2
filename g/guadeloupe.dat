5|$|The <b>Guadeloupe</b> amazon or <b>Guadeloupe</b> parrot (Amazona violacea) is a {{hypothetical}} extinct species of parrot that {{is thought to}} have been endemic to the Lesser Antillean island region of <b>Guadeloupe.</b> Mentioned and described by 17th and 18th century writers, it received a scientific name in 1789. It was moved to the genus Amazona in 1905, and {{is thought to have}} been related to, or possibly the same as, the extant imperial amazon. A tibiotarsus and an ulna bone from the island of Marie-Galante may belong to the <b>Guadeloupe</b> amazon. In 1905, a species of extinct violet macaw was also claimed to have lived on <b>Guadeloupe,</b> but in 2015 it was suggested to have been based on a description of the <b>Guadeloupe</b> amazon.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, the American ornithologists Matthew Williams and David Steadman {{supported}} {{the idea that}} the early accounts were a solid basis for the <b>Guadeloupe</b> amazon's existence. They also reported a tibiotarsus bone found on the Folle Anse archaeological site on Marie-Galante, an island in the <b>Guadeloupe</b> region, which they found {{similar to that of the}} imperial amazon, but slightly shorter. Since Maria-Galante shares many modern bird species with <b>Guadeloupe,</b> they suggested that the bone belonged to the <b>Guadeloupe</b> amazon, and assigned it to A. cf. violacea (which implies the classification is uncertain). In 2004, Patricia Ottens-Wainright and colleagues pointed out that the early descriptions of the <b>Guadeloupe</b> amazon did not clearly determine whether it was a unique species or the same species as the imperial amazon. Ornithologists Storrs Olson and Edgar Maíz, writing in 2008, felt that the <b>Guadeloupe</b> amazon was probably the same as the imperial amazon. In contrast the English ornithologist Julian P. Hume wrote in 2012 that though the amazon species of <b>Guadeloupe</b> and Martinique were based on accounts rather than physical remains, he found it likely they once existed, having been mentioned by trusted observers, and on zoogeographical grounds. In 2015, the ecologists Monica Gala and Arnaud Lenoble stated that an ulna bone from Maria-Galante, which had been assigned to the extinct Lesser Antillean macaw (Ara guadeloupensis) by Williams and Steadman in 2001 and to the imperial amazon by Olson and Maiz in 2008, instead belonged to the <b>Guadeloupe</b> amazon.|$|E

5|$|The Secretary of State for the French Overseas, Christian Estrosi, visited Martinique {{shortly after}} the {{hurricane}} to inspect the damage. He was joined by French Prime Minister, François Fillon on August 22 and the two surveyed the damaged to <b>Guadeloupe</b> and Martinique, the two hardest hit French colonies. A week after the storm hit 11,000people in Martinique were still without telephone and electricity and in the worst hit parts of southern <b>Guadeloupe</b> the water was still not drinkable. Banana crops in <b>Guadeloupe,</b> 80% of which were destroyed by Dean, will not recover until March, 2008.|$|E
5|$|Comminges {{was called}} up to the <b>Guadeloupe</b> team, ahead of the 2007 Gold Cup. The 2007 edition of the tournament {{was the first time}} the country had participated in the competition. He made his debut in Guadeloupe's opening game of the tournament, playing the whole match in a 1–1 draw with Haiti. He went on to play in one of the two {{remaining}} group matches; starting in a surprise 2–1 victory over group winners Canada, before missing a 1–0 defeat to Costa Rica through suspension. Finishing the group in third place with four points, <b>Guadeloupe</b> qualified as one of the best two third-place finishers. Comminges subsequently started in the quarter-final match, as <b>Guadeloupe</b> defeated Honduras 2–1. Comminges earned his fourth cap in the semi-final, as his country narrowly lost to Mexico by a 1–0 scoreline.|$|E
5|$|Greenway {{suggested}} {{that both the}} French settlers and their slaves ate the <b>Guadeloupe</b> amazon, as well as destroying its habitat. The supposedly related imperial amazon survives in the steep mountain forests of Dominica, whereas <b>Guadeloupe</b> is less mountainous and more suitable for farming, and has a larger population of humans. Because of this, {{there would have been}} a greater pressure on the <b>Guadeloupe</b> amazon, and it appears to have become extinct by the end of the 18th century. The amazons still surviving on the West Indian islands are all endangered since they are trapped for the pet-trade, overhunted for food, and because of destruction of their habitat.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, {{a wave of}} Haitian, mostly musicians, to Dominica and the French Antilles (<b>Guadeloupe</b> and Martinique) {{brought with}} them the kadans, a {{sophisticated}} form of music that quickly swept the island and helped unite all the former French colonies of the Caribbean by combining their cultural influences. These Haitians drew upon previous success from mini-jazz artists like Les Gentlemen, Les Leopards, and Les Vikings de <b>Guadeloupe.</b>|$|E
5|$|Later in 2015, Lenoble {{reviewed}} overlooked historical Spanish and French sources, finding {{references to}} mainly red macaws {{consistent with the}} Lesser Antillean macaw. The writings of the French missionary Raymond Breton (on <b>Guadeloupe</b> from 1635 to 1654) were especially illuminating, as they showed that both he and the native Island Caribs clearly distinguished between the red macaws of <b>Guadeloupe</b> and the scarlet macaws from the mainland, which supports {{the idea that the}} Lesser Antillean macaw represents an independent species. As the Lesser Antillean Carib language had different words reserved for men and women, Breton gave the name of the bird as Kínoulou (♂) and Caarou (♀). Lenoble furthermore concluded that the supposed violet macaw (named Anodorhynchus purpurascens based on accounts of blue parrots from <b>Guadeloupe)</b> was based on misidentified references to the also-extinct <b>Guadeloupe</b> amazon (Amazona violacea), and therefore never existed.|$|E
5|$|On 28 January, Cochrane's fleet at Barbados, {{including}} Jason, Cleopatra and Hazard, sailed for Martinique, arriving {{two days}} later and conducting successful landings at three points on the island. Within a week, all of the French colony was in British hands except for Fort Desaix, which held out for a further three weeks before surrendering after a heavy bombardment. The following month, a major reinforcement fleet arrived from France {{but was unable to}} affect the situation on Martinique and anchored in Îles des Saintes, a small archipelago to the south of <b>Guadeloupe.</b> There they were blockaded and attacked by Cochrane's squadron and in the ensuing Action of 14–17 April 1809 were defeated, with the ship of the line Haupoult captured and the remainder driven back to Europe. Two frigates reached <b>Guadeloupe,</b> but both were later captured. Subsequent attempts to resupply <b>Guadeloupe,</b> the only remaining French position in the West Indies, were made during 1809, and a squadron under Commodore Francois Roquebert managed to capture a British frigate at the Action of 13 December 1809. However, this force was intercepted by a British blockade squadron near <b>Guadeloupe</b> at the Action of 18 December 1809 and defeated, with two frigates destroyed and two others forced to return to Europe without reaching their destination. <b>Guadeloupe</b> was subsequently invaded in January 1810 and captured, ending direct French interest in the Americas during the Napoleonic Wars.|$|E
5|$|Roquebert's {{expedition}} to the Caribbean, was an unsuccessful operation by a French naval squadron to transport supplies to <b>Guadeloupe</b> in December 1809 {{at the height of}} the Napoleonic Wars. Over the previous year, British Royal Navy squadrons had isolated and defeated the French Caribbean colonies one by one, until by the autumn <b>Guadeloupe</b> was the only colony remaining in French hands. Cut off from the rest of the world by British blockade squadrons that intercepted all ships coming to or from the island, <b>Guadeloupe</b> was in a desperate situation, facing economic collapse, food shortages and social upheaval, as well as the impending threat of British invasion. In an effort to reinforce and resupply the colony, the French government sent four vessels to the West Indies in November 1809 under Commodore François Roquebert. Two of the ships were 20-gun flûtes carrying supplies and troops. The two others were 40-gun frigates, ordered to protect the storeships on their journey from the British forces operating off both the French and <b>Guadeloupe</b> coasts.|$|E
5|$|Subsequent French {{attempts}} to supply their one remaining colony on <b>Guadeloupe</b> were minor, {{most of the}} brigs sent were seized without reaching the island. The only significant attempt, launched in November 1809, achieved initial success {{in the destruction of}} the British frigate HMS Junon on 13 December, but ultimately failed when the two armed storeships, Loire and Seine were destroyed on 18 December in a battle with a British squadron off the southern coast of <b>Guadeloupe.</b> During the autumn and winter, British forces were collected from across the Caribbean at Fort Royal, Martinique, under Cochrane and Beckwith for the invasion of <b>Guadeloupe.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Action of 22 January 1809 {{was a minor}} naval {{engagement}} {{fought off}} the Caribbean island of <b>Guadeloupe</b> during the Napoleonic Wars. The action was fought {{as part of the}} blockade of <b>Guadeloupe</b> and neighbouring Martinique by a large British Royal Navy squadron, which was seeking to cut the islands off from contact and supplies from France by preventing the passage of shipping from Europe to the islands. The British blockade was part of their preparation for planned invasions during the next year.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the French attempts to reach the Caribbean ended in failure. Several ships were intercepted in the Bay of Biscay, while others reached the Caribbean, only to be defeated by ships from Cochrane's squadron, which was focused on preparations for the invasion of Martinique, planned for February. Only two ships reached the islands safely, the 40–gun frigates Junon at <b>Guadeloupe</b> and Amphitrite at Martinique. By February 1809, Martinique was under attack, distracting most of the available British ships from the blockade of <b>Guadeloupe.</b> Taking advantage of the temporary absence of enemy shipping, Junon {{slipped out of the}} Îles des Saintes to the south of <b>Guadeloupe</b> on 4 February and sailed north. The French captain, Jean-Baptiste-Augustin Rousseau, had dropped off his military and food supplies and taken on board large quantities of trade goods for sale in France in an effort to revive the <b>Guadeloupe</b> economy.|$|E
5|$|Although Katia passed well {{northeast}} of the Lesser Antilles, a yellow alert was hoisted in <b>Guadeloupe</b> for the potential of 3–5meter (10–16ft) swells. Antigua and Barbuda recorded 21.59millimeters (0.85in) of rainfall between September6 and September7 from an outer band.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{popularity}} of Triple K International, Ncore, and the New generation of bouyon bands who toured the French Antilles, a popular offshoot of bouyon from <b>Guadeloupe</b> is call bouyon gwada.|$|E
5|$|Emerald {{took two}} French sloops in July 1809. Deux Freres, en route for <b>Guadeloupe</b> from Rochelle when {{captured}}, arrived in Plymouth on 26 July. A week later, Emerald captured the French schooner Balance, {{which had been}} sailing to France from <b>Guadeloupe.</b> Both captures carried letters of marque, a government licence authorising the attack and capture of enemy vessels. The first, of four guns, was carrying a small reinforcement for Guadeloupe's garrison. The second, also of four guns, was carrying a cargo of coffee and other colonial produce.|$|E
5|$|In {{the days}} after to storm, some {{residents}} of Martinique, still without electricity, food, water, or telephones, took to looting stores and bakeries. Utility workers from <b>Guadeloupe,</b> French Guiana, and France arrived on August 19 to help restore electricity.|$|E
5|$|In {{the month}} {{following}} {{the capture of}} Junon, <b>Guadeloupe</b> was the only French colony in the Caribbean not under attack; Martinique fell to the British on 24 February and Spanish forces continued their Siege of Santo Domingo. The French did make further attempts to resupply the islands; a major expedition was defeated off <b>Guadeloupe</b> in April, and elements of this force that reached the island were defeated and captured during June and July. With British forces distracted by the ongoing Reconquista in Santo Domingo, {{the focus of the}} campaign moved north, and it was not until a second major expedition arrived in December that significant British forces returned to the Leeward Islands for the final invasion of <b>Guadeloupe.</b> The influx of British reinforcements was too late for HMS Junon; on 13 December she had been cruising alone to the east of Antigua and been surprised by François Roquebert's squadron of four French frigates. Outnumbered and surrounded, Junon fought hard but was eventually forced to surrender after Captain John Shortland was mortally wounded. Reduced to a sinking condition in the engagement, Junon was set on fire and abandoned by Roquebert, whose ships were intercepted five days later off <b>Guadeloupe</b> and defeated: two were destroyed and two others returned to France without landing their supplies.|$|E
5|$|Many {{hypothetical}} extinct macaws {{were based}} only on contemporaneous accounts, but these species are considered dubious today. Several of them were named in the early 20th century by Rothschild, who {{had a tendency to}} name species based on little tangible evidence. Among others, the red-headed macaw (Ara erythrocephala) and the Jamaican red macaw (Ara gossei) were named for accounts of macaws on Jamaica, and the Dominican green-and-yellow macaw (Ara atwoodi) was supposedly from Dominica island. The violet macaw (Anodorhynchus purpurascens), which was named for accounts of blue parrots supposedly from <b>Guadeloupe,</b> is now thought to have been based on references to the <b>Guadeloupe</b> amazon (Amazona violacea).|$|E

5|$|Shortly after Klaus {{attained}} {{tropical storm}} status early on October 4, {{a tropical storm}} warning was issued for the northern Leeward Islands from Saint Martin to Antigua, which was upgraded to a hurricane warning as its quick strengthening became apparent; additionally, the government of France issued a tropical storm warning for <b>Guadeloupe.</b> A hurricane watch was issued for the Virgin Islands, though it was dropped as Klaus began to weaken. In <b>Guadeloupe,</b> officials advised citizens to transport livestock to safer areas, and also to avoid potentially flooded areas. Prior to its arrival, schools were closed in Martinique, Sint Maarten, and Antigua. The VC Bird International Airport was closed during {{the passage of the}} hurricane.|$|E
5|$|The Action of 10 February 1809 {{was a minor}} naval {{engagement}} of the Napoleonic Wars, in which a British Royal Navy squadron chased and captured the French frigate Junon in the Caribbean Sea. Junon was {{on a mission to}} carry trade goods from the Îles des Saintes near <b>Guadeloupe</b> back to France and was part of a succession of French warships sent during 1808 and the early months of 1809 in an effort to break the British blockade of the French Caribbean, which was destroying the economies and morale of the islands. Having landed supplies, Junons return cargo was intended to improve the economic situation on <b>Guadeloupe</b> with much needed oceanic trade.|$|E
5|$|The American {{zoologist}} Austin Hobart Clark {{gave the}} Lesser Antillean macaw its scientific name, Ara guadeloupensis, in 1905, {{based on the}} contemporary accounts, and he also cited a 1765 color plate as possibly depicting this species. He wrote that it was different in several ways from the superficially similar scarlet macaw (A. macao), {{as well as the}} green-winged macaw (A. chloropterus) and the Cuban macaw (A. tricolor). Clark suggested the species might have existed on the islands of Dominica and Martinique, based on accounts of red macaws there, as well as on <b>Guadeloupe.</b> In his 1907 book Extinct Birds, the British zoologist Walter Rothschild instead claimed each island had its own species, and that the Lesser Antillean macaw was confined to <b>Guadeloupe.</b> In 1967, the American ornithologist James Greenway wrote that the macaws reported from <b>Guadeloupe</b> could have been imported to the region from elsewhere by the native population, but this is difficult to prove. Greenway also suggested that the scarlet macaw and the Cuban macaw formed a superspecies with the Lesser Antillean macaw and other hypothetical extinct species suggested for Jamaica and Hispaniola. According to the English paleontologist Julian Hume, the similarity between the Lesser Antillean macaw and the scarlet macaw indicates that they were close relatives, and that the <b>Guadeloupe</b> species may have descended from the mainland macaw.|$|E
5|$|The Lesser Antillean macaw or <b>Guadeloupe</b> macaw (Ara guadeloupensis) is a {{hypothetical}} extinct species of macaw that {{is thought to}} have been endemic to the Lesser Antillean island region of <b>Guadeloupe.</b> In spite of the absence of conserved specimens, many details about the Lesser Antillean macaw are known from several contemporary accounts, and the bird is the subject of some illustrations. Austin Hobart Clark described the species {{on the basis of these}} accounts in 1905. Due to the lack of physical remains, and the possibility that sightings were of macaws from the South American mainland, doubts have been raised about the existence of this species. A phalanx bone from the island of Marie-Galante confirmed the existence of a similar-sized macaw inhabiting the region prior to the arrival of humans, and was correlated with the Lesser Antillean macaw in 2015. Later that year, historical sources distinguishing between the red macaws of <b>Guadeloupe</b> and the scarlet macaw (A. macao) of the mainland were identified, further supporting its validity.|$|E
5|$|Upon first {{becoming}} a tropical cyclone, the depression was located {{to the south}} of the subtropical ridge, resulting in a west-northwest track which brought the center over <b>Guadeloupe.</b> The circulation was initially broad, and dry air temporarily entrained the northwest quadrant of the storm. However, environmental conditions were favorable enough for further development, with a deepening trough to its west providing beneficial flow. Banding features improved around the circulation, and the National Hurricane Center upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Jeanne on September 13 about 135mi (220km) southeast of Saint Croix. While crossing the Lesser Antilles, the storm brought locally heavy rainfall, with a total of 12inches (305mm) reported in <b>Guadeloupe.</b>|$|E
5|$|While {{there may}} have been the {{occasional}} fusion, Bouyon has always maintained a very clear, recognisable and obviously different style from soca. This style of bouyon music was originated in Dominica, but is also very popular in Saint Lucia, <b>Guadeloupe</b> and Martinique.|$|E

5|$|Early in the storm's development, {{forecasting}} Erika's {{motion was}} difficult, with a persistent leftward bias in official forecasts. In response to Erika's threat, {{the government of}} Saint Martin first issued a tropical storm warning late on September 4. The next day, the respective governments of Antigua, Montserrat, Barbuda, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Anguilla, Dominica, <b>Guadeloupe,</b> and Saint Barthélemy issued tropical storm warnings for their islands. When Erika's motion resulted in a path that would take it closer to the islands, all of the aforementioned islands excluding <b>Guadeloupe</b> upgraded the tropical storm warning to a hurricane warning. In addition, a hurricane watch was issued for the British and United States Virgin Islands, as well as Puerto Rico. In public advisories, the National Hurricane Center stated tropical storm conditions {{were likely to be}} experienced in the Azores. Early forecasts anticipated a threat to the island of Bermuda.|$|E
5|$|Emerald {{captured}} the vessel Augusta, which was under American colours, on 22 August {{and sent her}} into Antigua with the cargo of wine {{that she had been}} carrying from Leghorn to <b>Guadeloupe.</b> Emerald left Tortola on 26 October as escort to a convoy of 50 vessels for England but having parted from them in a storm, she put into Madeira in distress on 11 December.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the defeat}} in America, the 64th {{remained}} in Jamaica for two years, returning to England in 1783. Four {{years later the}} regiment was stationed in Ireland, before sailing once more for the West Indies in 1793 at {{the outbreak of the}} Napoleonic Wars. At the end of the Seven Years' War both Martinique and <b>Guadeloupe</b> had been returned to France {{under the terms of the}} Treaty of Paris. From Barbados the 64th Foot took part in the invasion of Martinique in early 1794. As before the flank companies were detached from the rest of the regiment but all three elements were involved in the actions in Martinique. This short but successful campaign earned the regiment its second battle honour, Martinique 1794—although as with the earlier <b>Guadeloupe</b> honour, it was not actually awarded until 1909.|$|E
5|$|French Creole {{music is}} most famously {{associated}} with Martinique and <b>Guadeloupe,</b> though {{the islands of}} Saint Lucia and Dominica are also home to French Antillean music. Creole music {{is characterized by the}} prominence of the quadrille dance, distinct from the French version and related to the Haitian mereng. The quadrille is a potent symbol of French Antillean culture.|$|E
5|$|<b>Guadeloupe</b> {{experienced}} {{moderate to}} extensive damage on Basse-Terre Island. There, the banana crop was completely destroyed, and {{combined with other}} losses, crop damage amounted to $100 million ($280 million in 2005 USD). David caused no deaths, a few injuries, and left several hundred homeless. Nearby, Marie-Galante and Les Saintes reported some extreme damage while Grande-Terre had some moderate damages.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, Comminges {{made three}} {{appearances}} {{for the national}} team, all of which in friendly matches. The following year, he was named in Roger Salnot's 23-man squad for the 2009 Gold Cup. He started in all three group matches, with <b>Guadeloupe</b> finishing in second place with six points {{out of a possible}} nine. Comminges played in his fourth match of the tournament, earning his eleventh cap in the process, as his country fell at the quarter-final stage of the competition courtesy of a 5–1 defeat to Costa Rica. He participated in his third Gold Cup in 2011, playing in two matches as <b>Guadeloupe</b> finished bottom of their group after losing all three matches. To date, Comminges has made 15 appearances for his country.|$|E
