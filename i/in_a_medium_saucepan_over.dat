This study examined whether in vitro the differentiation pattern of gingival fibroblast can be enhanced according to the cultivating media. The 4 th passage gingival fibroblast cells were cultured <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>medium</b> containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum and 1 X antibiotic antimycotic solution. The cells was incubated at 37 °C in 5 % CO 2 and 95 % humidity, and the cultivating media was changed every 2 days. The control gingival fibroblast was cultured <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>medium</b> containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium for 3 months. The experimental group 1 gingival fibroblast was cultured <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>medium</b> containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle <b>medium</b> for <b>a</b> first stage, and cultured <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>medium</b> containing Minimum essential <b>medium</b> for <b>a</b> second stage.

Pyramidalis, Populus maximowiczii×Populus plantierensisの 3 種のポプラの培養細胞について，培地へのNaClの添加量を徐々に増加させた場合の耐性を評価した。NaClを添加した最初の培養では，P. euphratica, P. maximowiczii×P. plantierensisの細胞は， 200 mMのNaCl添加では成長が著しく抑制された。また，P. alba cv. Pyramidalisの細胞では 150 mMのNaCl添加で成長が抑制された。しかし，培養を繰り返すうちに細胞はNaClに対する適応性を発達させ， 6 回目の継代培養終了時には，P. euphraticaの細胞は 200 mM, P. alba cv. Pyramidalisの細胞は 150 mMのNaCl添加培地でも良好な成長が可能になった。しかし，P. maximowiczii×P. plantierensisの細胞は， 100 mMまででしか良好な成長を示さなくなった。高NaCl条件下において種ごとの細胞成長に違いが見られたが，すべての種において 9 回目の継代培養において 200 mMのNaCl条件下での細胞の生存が確認された。また，NaCl 200 mMで培養された細胞は， 5 回から 6 回目の継代培養後でもカルスの再生能力を有していた。特に，P. euphraticaではNaCl 250 mMの条件で培養した細胞からもカルスが再生した。Tolerance for {{gradually}} increasing NaCl {{stress was}} evaluated for the suspension cultured cells of Populus euphratica, Populus alba cv.
