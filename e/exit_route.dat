I-70 meanders through a relatively flat portion of the swell until reaching Spotted Wolf Canyon, which provides the <b>exit</b> <b>route</b> to the swell. The eastern descent features one brake check area and two runaway truck ramps to aid trucks down.

5|$|Whitetip reef sharks hunt {{primarily}} at night, when many fishes are asleep and easily taken. After dusk, groups of sharks methodically scour the reef, often breaking off pieces of coral in their vigorous pursuit of prey. Multiple sharks may target the same prey item, covering every <b>exit</b> <b>route</b> {{from a particular}} coral head. Each shark hunts for itself and in competition with the others in its group. Unlike blacktip reef sharks and grey reef sharks, whitetip reef sharks do not become more excited when feeding in groups and {{are unlikely to be}} stirred into a feeding frenzy. Despite their nocturnal habits, whitetip reef sharks will hunt opportunistically in daytime. Off Borneo, this species gathers around reef drop-offs to feed on food brought up by the rising current. Off Hawaii, they follow Hawaiian monk seals (Monachus schauinslandi) and attempt to steal their catches. A whitetip reef shark can survive for six weeks without food.|$|E

5|$|Almost {{from the}} outset, {{overcrowding}} {{has been a}} constant problem, and there have been numerous improvements to the facilities and below-ground arrangements to deal with this. After much discussion between the then two separate operators, a major reconstruction began in 1912. This entailed a new ticket hall, serving both lines, being built {{in the basement of the}} Bakerloo station, with the Bakerloo lifts removed and new deep-level escalators opened down to the Bakerloo line level. Access to the CLR was by way of existing deep-level subways. The new works came into use on 9 May 1914 with the CLR lifts still available for passengers. By 1923 even this rearrangement was unable to cope, so a second rebuilding began. This involved a second set of escalators being built directly down to the Central line and the CLR station building becoming exit-only. On 2 October 1928, a third escalator leading to the Bakerloo platforms was opened. Unusually, lifts came back into prominence at an Underground station when, in 1942, a set of high-speed lifts came into use, largely used as an <b>exit</b> <b>route</b> from the Central line platforms directly to the Argyll Street exit building.|$|E

25|$|The whitetip reef shark {{is highly}} {{responsive}} to olfactory, acoustic, and electrical cues given off by potential prey. Its visual system is attuned more to movement and/or contrast than to object details. It is especially sensitive to natural and artificial low-frequency {{sounds in the}} 25100Hz range, which evoke struggling fish. They hunt primarily at night, when many fishes are asleep and easily taken. After dusk, a group of sharks may target the same prey item, covering every <b>exit</b> <b>route</b> from a particular coral head. Each shark hunts for itself and in competition with the others in its group. They feed mainly on bony fishes, including eels, squirrelfishes, snappers, damselfishes, parrotfishes, surgeonfishes, triggerfishes, and goatfishes, as well as octopus, spiny lobsters, and crabs. Important predators of the whitetip reef shark include tiger sharks and Galapagos sharks.|$|E

40|$|Purpose. The {{purpose of}} the article is to assess the costs, which are redistributed in the system ¬´shipper‚àírailroad‚àíconsignee¬ª during routing of rail {{transportation}} {{and the development of}} tariff simulation methods of shippers to the <b>exit</b> <b>routes</b> formation. Methodology. Using economic and mathematical analysis the distribution of costs among the various participants of transportation process during the <b>exit</b> <b>routes</b> formation is investigated in the article. Findings. For implementation of the tariff simulation methods of <b>exit</b> <b>routes</b> and retention of the existing tariff structure it is proposed to provide in the ¬´Tariff catalogue for freight transportation by railway transport of Ukraine¬ª the discount, differentiated from haulage distance. A new method for determining the fees amount for cars supply and removal on approach tracks by train locomotives was also offered. Originality. As a result of the research a new method for determination of the exit rout efficiency that, unlike the existing one, takes into account the various interests of the individual participants in the transportation process was proposed. The dependence of the correction factors to the tariff for freight transportation in their own cars by direct <b>exit</b> <b>routes</b> from distance haulage was obtained. Implementation of these coefficients provides an approximation of railway tariffs to the traffic handling costs. A method for determination the rate of fees for cars supply and removal on approach tracks by train locomotives was offered. Practical value. InUkraine creation of the tariff discounts system for freight transportation by <b>exit</b> <b>routes</b> consistent with international practice and allows bringing the tariff to the real traffic handling cost. This change on the one hand will provide stimulation for private capital investments in infrastructure development and shunting means of approach tracks, on the other ‚Äì it will fix the shippers to the railroads and stop their outflow for alternative modes of transport...|$|R

40|$|This paper aims {{to assess}} empirically the {{relative}} size of incentive effects and health for the retirement decision. We specify and estimate a dynamic model for retirement behaviour that explicitly takes account of eligibility conditions and replacement rates of alternative <b>exit</b> <b>routes</b> from the labour force, and health. A range of health instruments are constructed from estimates {{of a model}} for health dynamics and these are {{used to assess the}} effect of reporting errors and of endogeneity of health on the estimates of the retirement model. Our results provide evidence that health and retirement are endogenously related. Health matters but the size of the health effect depends crucially on the health measure used. We find that subjective health measures overstate the effect of health on retirement and that endogeneity of health suppresses the health effect. Incentive effects are relatively insensitive to alternative specifications for health. The incentive effects are strong for Early Retirement schemes. There is evidence that income streams in alternative <b>exit</b> <b>routes</b> are compared in the retirement decision and that alternative <b>exit</b> <b>routes</b> act as substitutes. ...|$|R

By interviewing 19 respondents representing investors and entrepreneurs, the study makes five key findings. 1) Corporate ventures might be especially positioned to invest in collaborative-based companies, being able to substitute specialization for capital; 2) Evidence show collaborative economy might be over-hyped in Norway; 3) Findings suggests there is a technology competence gap in Norwegian PE; 4) The collaborative model has limited <b>exit</b> <b>routes,</b> and; 5) Inconclusive evidence for a pattern {{in the balance of}} user and contractor demand.
