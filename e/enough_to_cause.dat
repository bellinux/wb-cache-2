5|$|In {{order for}} this scheme to be accurate, the time step must be large <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> the curve to move {{by at least}} one pixel even at points of low curvature, but small <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> the radius of {{blurring}} to be less than the minimum radius of curvature. Therefore, the size of a pixel must be , small enough to allow a suitable intermediate time step to be chosen.|$|E
5|$|As Sylvester himself observed, Sylvester's {{sequence}} {{seems to}} be unique in having such quickly growing values, while simultaneously having a series of reciprocals that converges to a rational number. This sequence provides an example showing that double-exponential growth is not <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> an integer sequence to be an irrationality sequence.|$|E

5|$|Later, the {{remnants}} of Josephine moved across Atlantic Canada, where rainfall peaked at 2.76in (70mm) in northern Newfoundland. The strongest winds in the region were 52mph (83km/h), strong <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> ferry service to be canceled or delayed. In Amherst and Fort Lawrence, the storm caused power outages and school closings.|$|E
5|$|This led Rutherford {{to propose}} a {{planetary}} model in which a cloud of electrons surrounded a small, compact nucleus of positive charge. Only such a concentration of charge could produce the electric field strong <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> the heavy deflection.|$|E
5|$|Alterations in the {{autonomic}} {{nervous system}} can lead to orthostatic hypotension (low blood pressure upon standing), oily skin and excessive sweating, urinary incontinence, and altered sexual function. Constipation and impaired stomach emptying (gastric dysmotility) can be severe <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> discomfort and even endanger health. Changes in perception may include an impaired sense of smell, disturbed vision, pain, and paresthesia (tingling and numbness). All of these symptoms can occur years before diagnosis of the disease.|$|E

5|$|By late December 1899, mining had {{compromised}} Joppenbergh's integrity <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> {{a series}} of landslides, followed by a large cave-in on December19. Four collapses occurred that day, beginning at 8AM, and culminating in the 11:30AM collapse of the Black Smoke Mine shaft network. Though it was initially believed that fifteen workers had been killed, the collapse happened while all 150 men were outside of the mountain, eating lunch.|$|E
5|$|Grit {{is often}} mixed with hydrous sodium {{ferrocyanide}} as an anticaking agent which, while harmless {{in its natural}} form, can undergo photodissociation in strong sunlight to produce the extremely toxic chemical hydrogen cyanide. Although sunlight is generally not intense <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> this in polar and temperate regions, salt deposits must kept {{as far as possible}} from waterways to avert the possibility of cyanide-tainted runoff water entering fisheries or farms.|$|E
5|$|In most cases, {{rainfall}} is {{the only}} effect that these cyclones have on California. Sometimes, the rainfall is severe <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> flooding and damage. For example, floods from Hurricane Kathleen devastated Ocotillo, California and killed several people. Precipitation other than rainfall is unusual in tropical cyclones, because of their weak updrafts and lack of supercooled water.|$|E

5|$|Other {{details about}} the {{poisoning}} have always been in dispute. While some argue that Claudius was in Rome, others claim he was in Sinuessa on the night he was poisoned. Whether one ingestion of poison was only <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> Claudius to fall ill and whether a second dose was given to kill him is also debated.|$|E
5|$|Scully {{returns to}} Washington and is congratulated by Mulder {{for being the}} first person to make a second X-File appearance. Ed was brought to a burn center in Philadelphia where the ergot {{chemicals}} were found in his blood; it was also in Scully's blood, but not <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> hallucinations. Mulder wonders if this all happened because of their earlier argument, to which Scully replies that not everything is about him.|$|E
5|$|This was not <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> a {{complete}} fallout {{between the two}} men, though {{from this point on}} Warwick increasingly stayed away from court. The promotion of Warwick's brother George to Archbishop of York shows that the earl was still in favour with the king. In July 1465, when Henry VI was once more captured, it was Warwick who escorted the fallen king to his captivity in the Tower.|$|E

5|$|A severe {{regression}} {{would have}} greatly reduced the continental shelf area, {{which is the}} most species-rich part of the sea, and therefore could have been <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> a marine mass extinction, however, research concludes that this change would have been insufficient to cause the observed level of ammonite extinction. The regression would also have caused climate changes, partly by disrupting winds and ocean currents and partly by reducing the Earth's albedo and therefore, increasing global temperatures.|$|E
5|$|About an {{hour after}} {{fragment}} K entered Jupiter, observers recorded auroral emission near the impact region, {{as well as at}} the antipode of the impact site with respect to Jupiter's strong magnetic field. The cause of these emissions was difficult to establish due to a lack of knowledge of Jupiter's internal magnetic field and of the geometry of the impact sites. One possible explanation was that upwardly accelerating shock waves from the impact accelerated charged particles <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> auroral emission, a phenomenon more typically associated with fast-moving solar wind particles striking a planetary atmosphere near a magnetic pole.|$|E
5|$|Ailanthus {{has been}} used to re-vegetate areas where acid mine {{drainage}} has occurred and it has been shown to tolerate pH levels as low as 4.1 (approximately that of tomato juice). It can withstand very low phosphorus levels and high salinity levels. The drought-tolerance of the tree is strong due to its ability to effectively store water in its root system. It is frequently found in areas where few trees can survive. The roots are also aggressive <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> damage to subterranean sewers and pipes. Along highways it often forms dense thickets in which few other tree species are present, largely due to the toxins it produces to prevent competition.|$|E

Nightcap-Con (Waru Gūsū) uses an ability that can confuse his opponents <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>causes</b> Flint and Talen-Master to fight each other. His Con form {{is dark and}} has a bell for a snout while his Master form is more {{humanoid}} and wears a cape. He was found by the famous author Hans Christian Andersen who used Nightcap to sleep and his characters in his dreams helped Flint and Talen-Master to break free from Nightcap-Con's spell.|$|R

5|$|Although only males {{produce the}} cicadas' {{distinctive}} sound, both sexes have membraneous structures called tympana {{by which they}} detect sounds; the equivalent of having ears. Males disable their own tympana while calling, thereby preventing damage to their hearing; a necessity partly because some cicadas produce sounds up to 120dB (SPL) which is among the loudest of all insect-produced sounds. The song is loud <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> permanent hearing loss in humans should the cicada sing just outside the listener's ear. In contrast, some small species have songs so high in pitch that they are inaudible to humans.|$|E
5|$|Another {{problem with}} the NIF lasers is that the flashtubes create a {{significant}} amount of heat, which warms the laser glass <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> it to deform. This requires a lengthy cooling-off period between shots, on the order of 12 hours. In practice, NIF manages a shot rate of less than one shot per day. To be useful as a power plant, about a dozen shots would have to take place every second, well beyond the capabilities of the NIF lasers.|$|E
5|$|Folklore often {{identifies}} a green {{sky with}} tornadoes, {{and though the}} phenomenon {{may be associated with}} severe weather, there is no evidence linking it specifically with tornadoes. It is often thought that opening windows will lessen the damage caused by the tornado. While there is a large drop in atmospheric pressure inside a strong tornado, {{it is unlikely that the}} pressure drop would be <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>cause</b> the house to explode. Opening windows may actually increase the severity of the tornado's damage. A violent tornado can destroy a house whether its windows are open or closed.|$|E
