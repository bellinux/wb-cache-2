25|$|Hawley Harvey Crippen (September 11, 1862 – November 23, 1910), usually {{known as}} Dr Crippen, was an American homeopath, ear and <b>eye</b> <b>specialist</b> and {{medicine}} dispenser.

25|$|His {{father gave}} up {{practicing}} law {{due to the}} failing eyesight that would eventually afflict his son. In 1914, {{the family moved to}} Geneva, Switzerland, and spent the next decade in Europe. Borges Haslam was treated by a Geneva <b>eye</b> <b>specialist,</b> while Jorge Luis and his sister Norah attended school; there Jorge Luis learned French. He read Thomas Carlyle in English, and he began to read philosophy in German. In 1917, when he was eighteen, he met the writer Maurice Abramowicz and began a literary friendship that would last {{for the rest of his}} life. He received his baccalauréat from the Collège de Genève in 1918. The Borges family decided that, due to political unrest in Argentina, they would remain in Switzerland during the war, staying until 1921. After World War I, the family spent three years living in various cities: Lugano, Barcelona, Majorca, Seville, and Madrid.|$|E
25|$|Dr. David M. Maurice (1922-2002), an <b>eye</b> <b>specialist</b> and semi-retired adjunct {{professor}} at Columbia University, proposed that REM sleep {{was associated with}} oxygen supply to the cornea, and that aqueous humor, the liquid between cornea and iris, was stagnant if not stirred. Among the supportive evidences, he calculated that if aqueous humor was stagnant, oxygen from iris had to reach cornea by diffusion through aqueous humor, which was not sufficient. According to the theory, when the animal is awake, eye movement (or cool environmental temperature) enables the aqueous humor to circulate. When the animal is sleeping, REM provides the much-needed stir to aqueous humor. This theory {{is consistent with the}} observation that fetuses, as well as eye-sealed newborn animals, spend much time in REM sleep, and that during a normal sleep, a person's REM sleep episodes become progressively longer deeper into the night. However, owls have REM sleep, but do not move their head more than in non-REM sleep and is well known that owls' eyes are nearly immobile.|$|E
50|$|The {{effectiveness}} of VRT {{has been a}} controversial topic. Beneficial results have been researched and documented by testing small groups of patients. This has led to skepticism {{by some of the}} scientific community. Even though VRT has been available for a few years now, optometrists, ophthalmologists, and other <b>eye</b> <b>specialists</b> do not regularly recommend VRT for their patients. The primary cause of this is that <b>eye</b> <b>specialists</b> rarely recommend this therapy to other <b>eye</b> <b>specialists.</b> The skepticism of VRT may be the source of the lack of recommendation.|$|R

500|$|In late 1964 {{he began}} to suffer from {{problems}} with his sight, which he attributed to the close analysis of artwork entailed by his job. He consulted <b>eye</b> <b>specialist</b> Patrick Trevor-Roper, who diagnosed a latent squint and recommended that Chatwin take a six-month break from his work at Sotheby's. [...] Trevor-Roper {{had been involved in}} the design of an eye hospital in Addis Ababa, and suggested Chatwin visit East Africa. In February 1965, Chatwin left for Sudan. It was on this trip that Chatwin first encountered a nomadic tribe; their way of life intrigued him. [...] "My nomadic guide," [...] he wrote, [...] "carried a sword, a purse and a pot of scented goat's grease for anointing his hair. He made me feel overburdened and inadequate..." [...] Chatwin would remain fascinated by nomads {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E

60|$|Both Jack and {{the others}} {{would have been more}} {{concerned}} had they known the truth, which was that Ruth had already been placed in the care of an <b>eye</b> <b>specialist</b> and been removed to that physician's private sanitarium. Pressed to tell the exact truth by Mr. Stevenson, the specialist had admitted that Ruth's eyes had suffered exceedingly, and that she was in danger of losing the sight of one of them and that that might possibly affect the other. As Mrs. Stevenson was very nervous already, the doctor had advised her husband to keep the truth to himself for the present and hope for the best.|$|E

60|$|Discussing {{these cases}} with my informants, {{we came to}} the {{conclusion}} that the red light in the human eye is probably always a pathological condition, a danger signal; but it is not perhaps safe to generalize on these few instances, and I must add that all the medical men I have spoken to on the subject shake their heads. One great man, an <b>eye</b> <b>specialist,</b> went so far as to say that it is impossible, that the red light in the eye was not seen by my informants but only imagined. The ophthalmoscope, he said, will show you the crimson at the back of the eye, but the colour is not and cannot be reflected on the surface of the iris.|$|E
60|$|The {{demonstrator}} turned, {{walked slowly}} back past the microtome, {{and left the}} laboratory by the preparation-room door. As he did so, first one, and then several students carrying notebooks entered the laboratory from the lecture theatre, and distributed themselves among the little tables, or stood in a group about the doorway. They were an exceptionally heterogeneous assembly, for while Oxford and Cambridge still recoil from the blushing prospect of mixed classes, the College of Science anticipated America in the matter years ago--mixed socially, too, for {{the prestige of the}} College is high, and its scholarships, free of any age limit, dredge deeper even than do those of the Scotch universities. The class numbered one-and-twenty, but some remained in the theatre questioning the professor, copying the black-board diagrams before they were washed off, or examining the special specimens he had produced to illustrate the day's teaching. Of the nine who had come into the laboratory three were girls, one of whom, a little fair woman, wearing spectacles and dressed in greyish-green, was peering out of the window at the fog, while the other two, both wholesome-looking, plain-faced schoolgirls, unrolled and put on the brown holland aprons they wore while dissecting. Of the men, two went down the laboratory to their places, one a pallid, dark-bearded man, who had once been a tailor; the other a pleasant-featured, ruddy young man of twenty, dressed in a well-fitting brown suit; young Wedderburn, the son of Wedderburn, the <b>eye</b> <b>specialist.</b> The others formed a little knot near the theatre door. One of these, a dwarfed, spectacled figure, with a hunchback, sat on a bent wood stool; two others, one a short, dark youngster, and the other a flaxen-haired, reddish-complexioned young man, stood leaning side by side against the slate sink, while the fourth stood facing them, and maintained the larger share of the conversation.|$|E
