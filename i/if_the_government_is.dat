He said: [...] "We are in danger, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>is</b> not careful, of having a proper sterling collapse, a run on the pound." [...] Labelling Gordon Brown's tactic a [...] "scorched-earth policy" [...] that a future Conservative government would have to clear up, Osborne continued: [...] "His view is he probably won't win the next election.

Rogerson argued that [...] "that there is a political and social will for Cornwall to be recognised as its own nation. Constitutionally, Cornwall {{has the right to}} a level of self-Government. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>Government</b> <b>is</b> going to recognise the right of Scotland and Wales to greater self-determination because of their unique cultural and political positions, then they should recognise ours." ...|$|E

The new police force would promote [...] "civic and moral values." [...] He said that he was committed to increase the salaries and benefits given to law enforcement officials throughout Mexico.

In his column of October 6, 1947, syndicated columnist George Sokolsky wrote: [...] I have among my friends and acquaintances literally dozens {{of men and women who}} during the Hitler-Stalin Alliance were so ashamed of Soviet cynicism that from ardent Communists they became ardent anti-Communists.

If you tax too high, the revenue will yield nothing. If you make the {{criminal}} code sanguinary, juries will not convict.

The true life and satisfactions of man seem to elude the utmost rigors or felicities of condition and to establish themselves with great indifferency under all varieties of circumstances. Under all governments the influence of character remains the same,--in Turkey and in New England about alike. Under the primeval despots of Egypt, history honestly confesses that man must have been as free as culture could make him.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most complex}} special {{capacity}} of the government is when it functions, {{in one way or}} another, as the Subsidizer of the speech in question. As a general rule, the government can itself say whatever it wants to, even if this [...] "favors one viewpoint over another". But, the government may not impose conditions on how subsidy recipients spend money they get from other sources. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>is</b> using the speakers to express its own message, it is constitutional. But this analysis changes <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>is</b> trying to encourage a [...] "diversity of private views indiscriminately".
