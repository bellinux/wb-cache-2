The original single branch generator consisted of a discharge capacitor in series with a solid state closing switch left bracket 1 right bracket operating at 30 kV. In combination with a parallel <b>freewheel</b> <b>diode</b> stack this generator produced a current pulse of 2. 7 mus rise time, 18. 5 kA amplitude and about 1. 8 ms fall time, of which only about 90 mus are needed to dump the beam. The <b>freewheel</b> <b>diode</b> circuit is equipped with a flat top current droop compensation network, consisting of a low voltage, low stray inductance, high current discharge capacitor. Extensive reliability studies have meanwhile suggested to further increase the operational safety of this crucial system by equipping each generator with two parallel branches. This paper presents the re-designed dual branch generator and addresses technical difficulties and approaches related to this design change, as well as further efforts intended to improve the overall reliability of the system. The final magnet current flat top compensation is also discussed, together with the low impedance transmission line between generator and magnet.

40|$|Multiphase machine drives {{are gaining}} {{importance}} in high-reliability applications {{due to their}} fault-tolerance capability {{and their ability to}} cope with the postfault operation without any extra electronic components. Predictive current controllers have been recently proposed for managing postfault operation of these drives when an open-phase fault is considered. However, the faulty situation assumes zero stator current while <b>freewheeling</b> <b>diodes</b> can continue conducting in a noncontrolled mode. This work analyzes the postfault operation of the five-phase drive when the <b>freewheeling</b> <b>diodes</b> of the faulty phase are still conducting.

40|$|Switch Mode Power Supplies (SMPS) {{can operate}} in two {{different}} conduction modes, each one depicting {{the level of the}} current circulating in the power choke when the power switch is turned on. As will be shown, the properties of two black boxes delivering the same power levels but working in different conduction modes, will change dramatically in DC and AC conditions. The stress upon the power elements they are made of will also be affected. This article explains why the vast majority of low-power FLYBACK SMPS (off-line cellular battery chargers, VCRs etc.) operate in the discontinuous area and present a new integrated solution especially dedicated to these particular converters. Defining the mode Figure 1 a and 1 b show the general shape of a current flowing through the converter's coil during a few cycles. In the picture, the current ramps up when the switch is closed (ON time) building magnetic field in the inductor’s core. When the switch opens (OFF time), the magnetic field collapses and, according to LENZ's law, the voltage across the inductance reverses. In that case, the current has {{to find some way to}} continue its flow and start its decrease (in the output network for a FLYBACK, through the <b>freewheel</b> <b>diode</b> in a BUCK etc.) ...|$|E
40|$|A {{semiconductor}} {{solid state}} switch has been constructed and tested in the prototype extraction kicker pulse generator of CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [1]. The switch is made of 10 modified 4. 5 kV, 66 mm symmetric GTO's (also called FHCT-Fast High Current Thyristor), connected in series. It holds off a d. c. voltage of 30 kV and conducts a 5 µs half-sine wave current of 20 kA with an initial di/dt of 10 kA/µs. Major advantages of the switch are the extremely low self-firing hazard, no power consumption during the ready-to-go status, instantaneous availability, simple condition control, very low noise emission during soft turn-on switching and easy maintenance. However, the inherent soft, relatively slow turn-on time is a non negligible part of the required rise time and this involves adaptation of generator components. A dynamic current range of 16 is achieved with variations in rise time, which stay within acceptable limits. Important generator improvements have been made with the series diodes and freewheel diodes. A more efficient droop compensation circuit is being studied. It is directly connected in series with the <b>freewheel</b> <b>diode</b> stack and maintains an acceptable flattop variation of 5 % of the magnet current during 90 µs.

The IC {{is dedicated to}} 100 V (AC) or 120 V (AC) input applications. The main benefits of these products are: • Small Printed-Circuit Board (PCB) footprint, and compact solution • High efficiency (up to 93 %) • High input power factor (> 0. 95); low Total Harmonic Distortion (THD; 0. 7); low ripple (< 5 %); minimum external component count • Enhanced power capability • Low electronic Bill Of Material (BOM) The SSL 5015 TE operates in Boundary Conduction Mode (BCM) with peak current modulation, providing an input power factor correction. The IC is typically configured to a buck converter. It can start up directly from the HV pin using an internal high-voltage current source. When the converter is switching, VCC is supplied through the DVDT pin by a capacitor coupled to the DRAIN pin or by an auxiliary supply. This feature simplifies the VCC supply. It allows a low-cost off-the-shelf inductor to be used, providing flexibility in application design. The IC supply current is 1. 3 mA.

40|$|The {{insulated}} gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) {{is arguably the}} most important device currently used in power conversion at medium to high levels. This thesis presents a detailed analysis of IGBT and <b>freewheel</b> <b>diode</b> operation in the context of inductive switching, which accounts for the majority of power conversion processes. In particular, the consequences of the device behaviour on device and circuit interaction are examined. The behaviour of one device is shown to be tightly coupled to that of the other device and the circuit elements during switching. Performance, reliability, efficiency and cost are all affected by design considerations arising from the interaction of switching devices in power converters. Thus there is an incentive to ensure that the designs of devices and circuits are matched, allowing the requirements of the system as a whole to be satisfied. To achieve this, a formal numerical optimisation technique is used in conjunction with compact device models to offer a novel alternative to design iteration using finite-element simulators. Despite their perceived accuracy, these suffer from severe computational requirements and therefore offer limited ability to explore large areas of device design. The development of compact device models possessing a combination of high simulation speed and predictable accuracy was required, so that practical optimisation may take place. An example of device optimisation has shown that there is indeed insight to be gained in optimising the devices and circuit as a whole. The optimisation has the potential to investigate aspects of device operation, such as active gate drive circuits, in addition to device aspects such as device geometry. A useful example of device optimisation is given in the form of automated parameter extraction, where device parameters are optimised to match simulated results with experimental results. This allows designers to have greater confidence in device models used for converter circuit design. The future potential of optimisation is greater still, considering the advances made in handling multiple objectives and uncertainty in operating conditions. Conclusions are drawn concerning the development of IGBTs, diodes and circuits. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
50|$|The {{advantages}} of the synchronous buck converter do not come without cost. First, the lower switch typically costs more than the <b>freewheeling</b> <b>diode.</b> Second, {{the complexity of the}} converter is vastly increased due to the need for a complementary-output switch driver.|$|R

40|$|In power {{conversion}} of photovoltaic (PV) energy, a hard-switching buck converter always generates some disadvantages. For example, serious electromagnetic interference (EMI), high switching losses, and stresses on an active switch (metal-oxide-semiconductor-field-effect-transistor, MOSFET), and high reverse-recovery losses of a <b>freewheeling</b> <b>diode</b> result in low conversion efficiency.
