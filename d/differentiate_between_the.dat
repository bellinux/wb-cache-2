Outside of the EU, {{the rules and regulations}} of Limousin breed associations do not yet <b>differentiate</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> French Pureblood and Purebred classes, with the Pureblood class remaining the origin of, and standard for, the purest form of Limousin.|$|E
5|$|The Old Poor Law was {{a parish}} based system, there were around 15,000 such parishes {{based upon the}} area around a parish church. The system allowed for despotic {{behavior}} from the Overseers of the Poor but as Overseers of the Poor would know their paupers they were considered able to <b>differentiate</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> deserving and undeserving poor making the system both more humane and initially more efficient. The Elizabethan Poor Law operated {{at a time when}} the population was small enough for everyone to know everyone else, therefore people's circumstances would be known and the idle poor would be unable to claim on the parishes' poor rate. The system provided social stability yet by 1750 needed to be adapted to cope with population increases, greater mobility and regional price variations.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{new ideas}} about the {{treatment}} of alcoholism, the lifetime suspension was downgraded to a 10-year suspension in 1952. DUI prosecutions remained difficult in cases when drivers refused to take a Breathalyzer test, and so in 1966, the state authorized the suspension of a person's driver's license for refusing to submit a breath sample. In 1977, the BAC limit was reduced to 0.10%, but the law was modified to <b>differentiate</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> second and third offenses, with lesser penalties for first and second convictions. In 1983, the state established a per se rule wherein a person over the limit was considered drunk in all cases (that is, not merely a presumption). Nine years later, the 0.01% BAC limit for drivers under 21 was instituted, and in 2003, the 0.10% BAC limit was reduced to 0.08% to comply with federal highway funding requirements.|$|E

5|$|On 23 March 1998, Braathens SAFE {{changed its}} name and {{corporate}} identity to Braathens. It introduced a new livery with a blue bottom, and replaced the Norwegian flag on the tail with an abstract, silver wing, that became the company's new logo. The re-branding {{was an attempt to}} create an international identity, and tone down the Norwegian national symbols that had been on the airplanes since 1946. At the same time, a two-class configuration was introduced: the 'Best' section, accounting for 70% of the planes capacity, received higher seat pitch, complimentary in-flight drinks, meals and newspapers, priority boarding and refundable tickets. The 'Back' section was for discount ticket holders, who received a no-frills service with a smaller seat pitch, and were located {{at the back of the}} aircraft behind a curtain. Best tickets became NOK300 more expensive, while it became easier to purchase discounted tickets. The scheme was, according to Erik G. Braathen, an attempt to <b>differentiate</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> full-fare customers, with whom Braathens was competing with SAS, and the low-fare customers, who Braathens was competing with Ryanair and the to-be established Color Air. The scheme as first introduced on the first 737-700 that was delivered.|$|E
