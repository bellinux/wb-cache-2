5|$|Andrew Johnson {{was born}} <b>in</b> <b>Raleigh,</b> North Carolina, on December 29, 1808, to Jacob Johnson (1778–1812) and Mary ("Polly") McDonough (1783–1856), a laundress. He was of English, Scottish, and Irish ancestry. He {{had a brother}} William, four years his senior, and an older sister Elizabeth, who died in childhood. Johnson's birth in a log cabin was a {{political}} asset in the mid-19th century, and he would frequently remind voters of his humble origins. Jacob Johnson was a poor man, as had been his father, William Johnson, but he became town constable of Raleigh before marrying and starting a family. He died of an apparent heart attack while ringing the town bell, shortly after rescuing three drowning men, when his son Andrew was three. Polly Johnson worked as a washerwoman and became the sole support of her family. Her occupation was then looked down on, as it often took her into other homes unaccompanied. There were even rumors that Andrew, who did not resemble his brother or sister, had been fathered by another man. Polly Johnson eventually remarried, to Turner Doughtry, who was as poor as she was.|$|E

5|$|The team {{began work}} on the {{expansion}} in summer 1998, but the task became complicated by Epic's organizational structure. During the development of Unreal, the team members at Digital Extremes were working in Ontario, Canada, while the members at Epic were based in North Carolina, United States, requiring regular travel to Ontario. To remedy this, Epic decided to centralize the teams <b>in</b> <b>Raleigh,</b> North Carolina, and by September, work on the expansion could begin. Lead programmer Steve Polge set about laying the foundations for the new game types, such as Capture the Flag and Domination, and level designers created {{the first round of}} maps for testing. The content grew quickly, and soon the team realized that it had underestimated the task. In November, after a meeting with publisher GT Interactive, Mark Rein suggested releasing the work as a standalone game instead of an expansion. The team was reticent at first, but soon accepted the idea, and in December the game became known internally as Unreal: Tournament Edition.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{was born}} in poverty <b>in</b> <b>Raleigh,</b> North Carolina. Apprenticed as a tailor, he worked in several {{frontier}} towns before settling in Greeneville, Tennessee. He served as alderman and mayor there before being elected to the Tennessee House of Representatives in 1835. After brief service in the Tennessee Senate, Johnson {{was elected to the}} federal House of Representatives in 1843, where he served five two-year terms. He became Governor of Tennessee for four years, and was elected by the legislature to the US Senate in 1857. In his congressional service, he sought passage of the Homestead Bill, which was enacted soon after he left his Senate seat in 1862. As Southern slave states, including Tennessee, seceded to form the Confederate States of America, Johnson remained firmly with the Union. He was the only sitting senator from a Confederate state who did not resign his seat upon learning of his state's secession. In 1862, Lincoln appointed him as military governor of Tennessee after most of it had been retaken. In 1864, Johnson, as a War Democrat and Southern Unionist, was a logical choice as running mate for Lincoln, who wished to send a message of national unity in his re-election campaign; their ticket easily won. When Johnson was sworn in as vice president in March 1865, he gave a rambling speech, after which he secluded himself to avoid public ridicule. Six weeks later, the assassination of Lincoln made him president.|$|E

At the Armageddon pay-per-view on December 14, Maryse teamed up with Jillian Hall, Victoria and Natalya in a losing effort to McCool, Maria, Kelly Kelly and Mickie James in an Eight-Diva Santa's Little Helper tag team match. On December 19, Maryse pinned Maria to become the number one contender for Michelle McCool's Divas Championship.

She returned to in-ring action on February 20, teaming with Michelle McCool in a win against Maria and Eve Torres, where she pinned Torres.|$|E
5|$|The {{remnants}} of Alberto dropped heavy precipitation across North Carolina, including a nationwide high of 7.16inches (182mm) at the Raleigh National Weather Service Office. Some totals broke previous rainfall records, including the station at Raleigh-Durham International Airport which broke the all-time daily precipitation record for that station. The rainfall led to flooding across the central {{portion of the}} state, with 45flash flood warnings issued by the Raleigh National Weather Service. Police and firefighters in Wake County performed 47water rescues. Additionally, the Raleigh-Wake 9-1-1center received more than 1,076calls for help. Flash flooding occurred throughout the area, which caused the Crabtree Creek <b>in</b> <b>Raleigh</b> to crest at 23.77feet (7.2m); {{this was the second}} highest flood stage on record for the creek. The overflown creek flooded a few cars to their rooftops, and resulted in the closure of the Crabtree Valley Mall. Major flooding was reported elsewhere throughout the region, which closed several roads and damaged some houses. In Franklin County, an eight-year-old boy drowned after getting sucked into a flooded drainage system; the death is considered indirect because the boy was chasing a ball into the drainage system. Near the coast, the storm produced several waterspouts, some of which moved ashore in Dare and Carteret counties. Isolated reports of 60mph (95km/h) wind gusts resulted in downed trees and minor damage.|$|E
5|$|On July 8, 2010, Weber {{was named}} the fifth captain in Nashville Predators history, {{replacing}} Jason Arnott, who {{was traded to the}} New Jersey Devils. He became the youngest captain in franchise history and the only Predators captain to have been drafted by the team. On January 11, 2011, Weber was among 42 players named to the 58th National Hockey League All-Star Game <b>in</b> <b>Raleigh,</b> North Carolina. For {{the first time in its}} history, the NHL used a fantasy draft format to select teams for the All-Star Game, and Weber was selected eighth overall by Team Lidstrom. At the game, Weber recorded four assists and was a +6, finishing the game tied with Loui Eriksson for most points and second to Nicklas Lidström for best plus/minus. Shortly after his All-Star Game appearance, Weber recorded his 200th career NHL pointan assistin a game versus the Detroit Red Wings on February 9, 2011. During his sixth season with the Predators Weber averaged 25:19 in ice time, and set career highs in games played (82), assists (32) and shots on goal (25). Weber also contributed three goals and five points in 12 playoff games as the Predators lost to the Vancouver Canucks after advancing to the Western Conference Semifinals for the first time in their history. At the conclusion of the regular season, Weber was named one of three finalistsalong with Zdeno Chára and Nicklas Lidströmfor the Norris Trophy, the first finalist nomination of his career. He finished second in Norris Trophy voting, losing with 727 voting points to Lidström's 736. Weber also finished 25th in Hart Memorial Trophy voting with two fifth-place votes. For the first time in his career, Weber was voted to the NHL First All-Star Team after receiving 445 voting points, second among defencemen to Lidström's 464. On July 1, 2011, Weber became a restricted free agent; despite this, Weber had stated he wanted to remain with the Predators. To prevent the possibility of other teams signing him to an offer sheet, the Predators filed for salary arbitration with Weber, giving the team and Weber until their hearing to negotiate a new contract. Failing to come to terms on a new contract by their hearing, Weber's case went to arbitration on August 2 – the first time in NHL history that a team-elected arbitration candidate had reached a hearing. The following day, he was awarded a one-year, $7.5 million contract, from which the Predators could not walk away, as they, and not Weber, had elected arbitration.|$|E
