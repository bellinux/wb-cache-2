5|$|Switzerland's {{ecosystems}} can {{be particularly}} fragile, because the many delicate valleys separated by high mountains often form unique ecologies. The mountainous regions themselves are also vulnerable, with a rich range of plants not found at other altitudes, and experience some pressure from visitors and grazing. The climatic, geological and topographical conditions of the alpine region make for a very fragile ecosystem that is particularly sensitive to climate change. Nevertheless, according to the 2014 Environmental Performance Index, Switzerland ranks first among 132 nations in safeguarding the environment, due to its <b>high</b> <b>scores</b> <b>on</b> environmental public health, its heavy reliance on {{renewable sources of energy}} (hydropower and geothermal energy), and its control of greenhouse gas emissions.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{culture of}} medical group {{practices}} is gaining increasing attention {{as one of}} the most important organizational factors influencing the costs and quality of health care. Based on organiza-tional theory, we propose that the culture of the practice differs depending on size, ownership, location, and the number of medical specialties. Methods: A survey was sent to 1223 physicians in 191 clinics in the upper Midwest. The clinic re-sponse rate was 77 %. The survey instrument identifies 9 culture dimensions, each with 3 to 6 measure-ment statements. Results: Smaller clinics had <b>higher</b> <b>scores</b> <b>on</b> 6 of the 9 dimensions. Physician-owned clinics had <b>higher</b> <b>scores</b> <b>on</b> 4 of the 9 dimensions, whereas system-owned clinics had a <b>higher</b> <b>score</b> <b>on</b> only 1 dimension. Only 1 dimension differed among the locations. Single-specialty clinics had <b>higher</b> <b>scores</b> <b>on</b> 4 dimensions and multispecialty clinics had <b>higher</b> <b>scores</b> <b>on</b> 2 dimensions. Conclusion: Our data confirm the contention that the culture of medical group practices varies con-siderably; to a degree, this variance is as predicted by organizational theory. The culture changes as group practices become larger and more complex through diversification into multispecialty practices or become part of larger health care systems.

Reviews for all versions of Fates generated a score of 88/100 based on seventeen reviews. Famitsu, which reviewed both physical versions in tandem, praised them for their drama and characters, despite noting that the inter-character relations of the two versions were complicated, and only playing {{one side of the}} story might leave players unsatisfied.

Martin Robinson of Eurogamer praised the game as a sound continuation of the mechanical improvements of Awakening: he positively noted the grey morality of the characters and story, and singled out Conquest as the [...] "cooler" [...] of the two physical versions due to its challenge and cast. His main criticism was its multi-part release, which he called [...] "needlessly convoluted" [...] and stated might alienate fans attracted to the series by Awakening.
