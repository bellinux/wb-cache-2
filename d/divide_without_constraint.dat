40|$|The {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with time-delay linear fractional systems with multiple delays in the state. A formula for {{the solution of the}} discussed systems is presented and derived using the Laplace transform. Definitions of relative controllability with and <b>without</b> <b>constraints</b> for linear fractional systems with delays in the state are formulated. Relative controllability, both with and <b>without</b> <b>constraints</b> imposed on control values, is discussed. Various types of necessary and sufficient conditions for relative controllability and relative U-controllability are established and proved. Numerical examples illustrate the obtained theoretical results...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} some properties {{regarding the}} Multivariable Generalized Predictive Controller (MGPC) designed in state space. The authors proposed {{the design of}} such a controller {{under the condition that}} it gives the same results as the input/output (I/O) formulation of the GPC proposed originally by Clarke. The main reason for redesigning the controller in state space is the power of the analysis tools available. These tools allow some properties to be treated more easily than under (I/O) formulation. These properties include: stability, robustness, closed loop representation, specifications, etc. This paper presents results related to: observability and controllability of the CARIMA model used, closed loop representation, uniqueness and the existence of control law <b>without</b> <b>constraints</b> and closed loop stability <b>without</b> <b>constraints.</b> Copyright 2002 IFAC Keywords: Predictive control, optimization, stability analysis, Lyapunov function, controllability, observability...|$|R
