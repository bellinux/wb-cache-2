For this, we have realized several thematic maps from the SRTM images, namely: the <b>hypsometric</b> <b>map,</b> the slopes map and their exposures, the sub-basins map, the river system map and its classification. From these thematic maps produced for the watershed studied, several physical characteristics were extracted, such as the surface, the perimeter, the Gravelius compactness index, and the equivalent rectangle.

40|$|A <b>hypsometric</b> <b>map</b> {{is a type}} of map used to {{represent}} topographic characteristics by filling different map areas with diverging colors. The setting of appropriate diverging colors is essential for the map to reveal topographic details. When lunar real environmental exploration programs are performed, large-scale hypsometric maps with a high resolution and greater topographic detail are helpful. Compared to the situation on Earth, fewer lunar exploration objects are available, and the topographic waviness is smaller at a large scale, indicating that presenting the topographic details using traditional hypsometric map-making methods may be difficult. To solve this problem, we employed the Chang’E 2 (CE 2) topographic and imagery data with a resolution of 7 m and developed a new hypsometric map-making method by setting the diverging colors based on information entropy. The resulting map showed that this method is suitable for presenting the topographic details and might be useful for developing {{a better understanding of the}} environment of the lunar surface...|$|E

40|$|With the aim {{of raising}} {{awareness}} on the prevention of landslide disasters, this work develops a methodology that incorporates geomorphological mapping into the mapping of landslide susceptibility using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Multiple Logistic Regression (MLR). In Mexico, some studies have evaluated the stability of hillsides using GIS. However, these studies set a general framework and guidance (that includes basic concepts and explanations of landslide classification, triggering mechanisms, criteria, considerations, and analysis for landslide hazard reconnaissance, etc.) for preparing a landslide atlas at state and city levels. So far, these have not developed a practical and standardized approach incorporating geomorphological maps into the landslide inventory using GIS. This paper describes the analysis conducted to develop an analytical technique and morphometric analysis for a multi-temporal landslide inventory. Three data management levels are used to create GIS thematic layers. For the first level, analogue topographic, geological, land-use, and climate paper are converted to raster format, georeferenced, and incorporated as GIS thematic layers. For the second level, five layers are derived from topographic elevation data: slope angles, slope curvature, contributing area, flow direction, and saturation. For the third level, thematic maps are derived from the previous two levels of data: a <b>hypsometric</b> <b>map</b> (heuristically classified to highlight altimetric levels), a reclassified slope map (allowing to highlight differences in relief), and a morphographic map (derived from a heuristic reclassification of the slope map to highlight volcanic landforms). The theoretical aspects of geomorphological mapping contribute to set the conceptual basis to support landslide mapping. The GIS thematic layers provide context and establish an overall characterization of landslide processes within the watershed. Through the retrieval and on-off switching of layers in the GIS system, a base map is created {{to assist in the}} digitizing of landslides and the modeling of susceptibility. A landslide inventory is created from aerial photographs, field investigations, and all the above GIS thematic layers. El Estado river watershed on the southwestern flank of Pico de Orizaba volcano has been selected as study area. The watershed is located in the southwestern slope of Citlaltepetl or Pico de Orizaba volcano. Geological (the stream channel of El Estado river erodes Tertiary and Quaternary lavas, disjointed volcanoclastic materials such as pyroclastic flows, fall deposits, lahars deposits, and alluvium) and geomorphological factors (steep slopes, energy relief, and vertical erosion) in combination with high seasonal rainfall (annual rainfall averages 1000 - 1100 mm/yr at > 4000 m a. s. l. and 927 mm/yr at < 1500 m a. s. l.), and the high degree of weathering, make the study area susceptible to landslides. To assess landslide susceptibility, a landslide inventory map and geomorphometric cartography (altimetry, slope and geomorphography) were reviewed, and field work was conducted. In the study area, more than one hundred landslides were mapped. Shallow landslides (including debris slides and debris flows) are the predominant type. Shallow landslides predominate on hills capped with ash and pyroclastic deposits. The second major landslide process includes rock falls (which occur where the stream erodes lava flows and lahars) and deep-seated landslides (which occur in ash and pyroclastic deposits where lava flows act as a slip plane). In parallel, the spatial geodatabase of landslides was constructed from standardized GIS datasets. Pertinent attributes are recorded on a geo-dataset. These include 1) mass wasting process, 2) level of certainty of the observation, 3) photo identification date, 4) landslide size, 5) landslide activity, 6) landslide parts (head, evacuation zone, deposit), 7) slope shape, 8) field slope gradient, 9) map gradient measured from the 10 m digital elevation model (DEM), 10) landslide delivery, 11) land use, 12) elevation at which the landslide started, 13) aerial photograph identification number, 14) landslide area, and 15) researcher comments. Each attribute is standardized by the geo-dataset domains in the GIS system. With this information the landslide susceptibility is modeled using MLR within a GIS platform. MLR is used to examine the relation between land sliding and several independent variables (elevation, slope, contributing area, land use, geology, and terrain curvature) to create the susceptibility map. With six independent variables, the multiple logistic model susceptibility map tends to overpredict landslides at a 10 m pixel resolution. However, the model is statistically valid and able to predict 79. 81 % of the existing landslides. The implementation of a landslide inventory and susceptibility mapping techniques demonstrate the feasibility of the method for use in other volcanic areas of Mexico...|$|E

40|$|New {{estimation}} of fundamental geodetic parameters and global and local topography of planets and satellites provide basic coordinate systems for mapping {{as well as}} opportunities for studies of processes on their surfaces. The main targets of our study are Europa, Ganymede, Calisto and Io (satellites of Jupiter), Enceladus (a satellite of Saturn), terrestrial planetary bodies, including Mercury, the Moon and Phobos, one of the Martian satellites. In particular, based on new global shape models derived from three-dimensional control point networks and processing of high-resolution stereo images, we have carried out studies of topography and morphology. As a visual representation of the results, various planetary maps with different scale and thematic direction were created. For example, for Phobos we have produced a new atlas with 43 maps, as well as various wall maps (different from the maps in the atlas by their format and design) : basemap, topography and geomorphological maps. In addition, we compiled geomorphologic maps of Ganymede on local level, and a global <b>hypsometric</b> Enceladus <b>map.</b> Mercury’s topography was represented as a hypsometric globe for the first time. Mapping of the Moon was carried out using new images with super resolution (0. 5 - 1 m/pixel) for activity regions of the first Soviet planetary rovers (Lunokhod- 1 and - 2). New results of planetary mapping have been demonstrated to the scientific community at planetary map exhibitions (Planetary Maps Exhibitions, 2015), organized by MExLab team in frame of the International Map Year, which is celebrated in 2015 - 2016. Cartographic products have multipurpose applications: for example, the Mercury globe is popular for teaching and public outreach, the maps like those for the Moon and Phobos provide cartographic support for Solar system exploration...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Snowmelt runoff {{plays an}} {{important}} role in providing water and agricultural resources, especially in mountainous areas. There are different methods to simulate the process of snowmelt. Inter alia, degree-day model, based on temperature-index is more cited. Snowmelt Runoff Model is a conceptual hydrological model to simulate and predict the daily flow of rivers in the mountainous basins on the basis of comparing the accuracy of AVHRR and TM satellite images to determine snow cover in Karun Basin. Additionally, overestimation of snow-covered area decreased with increasing spatial resolution of satellite data. Studies conducted in the Zayandehrood watershed dam, showed that in the calculation of the snow map cover, changes from MODIS satellite imagery, at the time that the image does not exist, using the digital elevation model and regression analysis can provide to estimate the appropriate data from satellites. In the study of snow cover in eastern Turkey, in the mountainous regions of the Euphrates River, data from five meteorological stations and MODIS images were used with a resolution of 500 m. The results showed that satellite images have a good accuracy in estimating snow cover. In a Watershed in northern Pakistan in the period from 2000 to 2006, SRM model was used to estimate the snow cover using MODIS images. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the snowmelt runoff using remote sensing data and SRM model for flow simulation, based on statistical parameters in the Kardeh dam basin. Materials and Methods: Kardeh dam basin has an area of about 560 square kilometers and is located in the north of Mashhad. This area is in the East of Hezarmasjed – kopehdagh zone that is one of the main basins of Kashafrood. This basin is a mountainous area. About 261 km of the basin is located at above 2000 m. The lowest point of the basin is at the watershed outlet with 1300 meters and the highest point in the basin, in the North West part of the basin with 2962 meters above sea level. Kardeh dam was primarily constructed on the Kardehriver for providing drinking and agriculture water demand with an annual volume rate of 21. 23 million cubic meters. Satellite image: To estimate the level of snow cover, the satellite Landsat ETM+ data at path 35 - 159, rows 34 - 159 over the period 2001 - 2002 were used. Surfaces covered with snow were separated bysnow distinction normalized index (NDSI), But due to the lack of training data for image classification (areas with snow and no snow), the k-means unsupervised classification algorithm was used. Extracting the data from the meteorological and hydrological Since only a gauging station exists at the Kardeh dam site, the daily discharge data recorded at these stations was used. To extract meteorological parameters such as precipitation and temperature data, the records of the three stations Golmakan, Mashhad and Ghouchan, as the stations closest to the dam basin Kardeh were used. The purpose of this study was to simulate snowmelt runoff using SRM hydrological models and to compare the results with the outputs of the neural network models such as the ANN and the ANFIS model. Flow simulation was carried out using SRM, ANN model with the Multilayer Perceptron with back-propagation algorithm, and Sugeno type ANFIS. To evaluate the performance of the models in addition to the standard statistics such as mean square error or mean absolute percentage error, the regression coefficient measures and the difference in volume were used. The results showed that all three models are almost similar in terms of statistical parameters MSE and R and the differences were negligible. SRM model: SRM model is a daily hydrological model. This equation is composed of different components including 14 parameters. The input values were calculated based on the equations of degree-day factor. The evaluation of the model was performed with flow subside factor, coefficient and subtracting volume. Results and Discussion: After determining the study area, the DEM in GIS software was produced and was divided into 4 height classes with 500 meterintervals based on the basin area. Thus, the <b>hypsometric</b> <b>map</b> of the region with slope and aspect maps wasobtained from DEM. The parameters that were entered into the SRM model included area, the average height of DEM and area of slope directions. Weighted average altitude was about 2007 m in the basin. Height classes of 2000 - 1500 comprise about 47 percent of the total area, with the highest frequency. The main slope happens in the southwestern region(SE). The results show that the model has properly simulated the daily flow hydrograph at the time of the study period. Factor subtracting volume was modeled based on daily discharge hydrograph at a 17 -year period. The best x and y values of the simulated hydrograph for watershed dam Kardeh were respectively 0 / 79 and 0 / 084 and finally entered into the model. To evaluate the model for the period of 79 - 80, the subtracting volume was about 0. 21 percent, the regression coefficient was 0. 91, the calculated runoff volume was 4 / 876 million cubic meters and calculated discharge was estimated 0. 212 cubic meters per seconds, that indicated a very good agreement with observed values. In addition, it was shown that between the parameters introduced into the model, change of the snow runoff coefficient and the coefficient of flow subsidence have the highest sensitivity, and then two parameters were accurately calibrated, to reach more conformity with ground truth. The results showed that the use of images with high spatial resolution, results in relatively good results in determination of snow-covered surfaces. These results were in agreement with other studies. SRM model is relatively successful so that changes in daily flow modeling provide a better quality. The comparison of the mean absolute percent error between the three models of ANFIS than the ANN model by 40 percent compared to 15 percent SRM model has reduced the error of the simulation process and the difference in volume between ANN and ANFIS models were better than the SRM model and the value of this parameter for both models are low...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this chapter}} is to provide an {{overview}} of recent developments in the fields of small-scale and multiscale relief <b>mapping.</b> <b>Hypsometric</b> tinting, relief shading, continuous color shading, plan oblique relief and other techniques are widely used for maps covering large territories at small scales. The main difference between these techniques and large-scale terrain cartography is that the representations become highly abstract at the observational scale and thus require a high level of generalization. At very small scales, the terrain is stylized to convey distinctive geographic and morphological features. The positional accuracy of valleys and mountain chains becomes less important, and terrain features are depicted as abstracted symbols at the smallest scales. Thus, two main topics are of interest in this chapter: the automation of representation techniques and the generalization of digital elevation models. We focus on both small-scale and multi-scale mapping, which are interrelated because related generalization techniques are specific to the representation techniques. The following sections first discuss general requirements for digital terrain generalization at small scales, then discuss terrain visualization with (a) traditional relief shading and plan oblique relief, (b) continuous color shading and (c) hypsometric tinting...|$|R
