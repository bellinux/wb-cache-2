She storms the Archministry and reaches a laboratory just as Daxus {{is about to begin}} the dissection. In the ensuing fight, Daxus reveals that he uses enhancements he gained from an accidental exposure to the hemophage virus to aid in his rise to power. Violet kills Daxus and leaves with Six's body. Six later wakes up, having been immunized by the hemophage virus in Violet's tears. It is theorized that Six might, after all, be instrumental in formulating a cure for the hemophages, although <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> for Violet (who is nearing the end of her 12 years).|$|E
2500|$|The {{retreat of}} Army Group North from the {{surroundings}} of Leningrad made the commanders of Finland realise that soon <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> to start {{negotiations with the}} Soviet Union. On 31 January 1944, General Field Marshal Keitel {{sent a letter to}} the Finnish Commander-in-Chief Mannerheim, claiming that the retreat of Army Group North to the Panther Line constituted no danger whatsoever to Finland. Marshal Mannerheim did not share the optimism, expressing his concern that the road in Narva would be open not only to Estonia, but also to Finland. As the German condition worsened in the Narva front, President of Finland Juho Kusti Paasikivi was presented with Stalin's peace terms on 8 February. However, Finland resumed in the war. To separate Finland from Germany and make her defence hopeless, Stalin needed to conquer Estonia. Stalin hoped that a breakthrough at Narva would make Finland sign a peace treaty quickly. The perspective of an invasion to East Prussia through Estonia appealed even more to the Soviet Main Command, as it appeared bringing German resistance to a collapse. Stalin gave a short and clear order to the Leningrad Front on 14 February: ...|$|E

6000|$|He whispered again, however, {{putting his}} purse into the hag's hand. [...] "Take this. Make your own terms {{when they are}} discovered. Only tell me where I must seek them--and speedily, or <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> late." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then we {{must come}} at once," [...] said De Catinat, {{as he listened}} to the cordial message which was {{conveyed}} to his uncle. [...] "To-night the orders will be out, and to-morrow <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> late." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wait and see," [...] Olsen rejoined, [...] "though that plan's expensive, because <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> {{when you}} find out. My {{employers}} don't often back the wrong man and I trust their judgment now. If you'll listen, I'll show you." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. March was herself again directly, {{read the}} message over, and {{stretched}} out her arms to her daughters, saying, in a tone they never forgot, [...] "I shall go at once, but <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>late.</b> Oh, children, children, help me to bear it!" ...|$|E

30|$|Volumetric MR {{quantification}} is {{the best}} approach to assess the LA size, but <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> time-consuming. An area ≧ 15 cm 2 /m 2 and a transverse diameter ≧ 2.8 cm/m 2 in the four-chamber view are valuable alternatives to identify LA enlargement [47].|$|R
50|$|When a {{violation}} {{is the result}} of farming or stat-padding, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> severe of a punishment to suspend or ban players.

50|$|Another {{thing to}} watch out for is the casing width - <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> tight for a plate pintle. If it's narrow and deep, the offset on the hinge will need to be nearly 90* to keep the hinge from binding {{on the corner of the}} structure.|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>be,</b> <b>too,</b> {{that each}} must view the Taj for {{himself with his}} own eyes, working out his own {{interpretation}} of the sight. It is certain that no man can in cold blood and colder ink set down his impressions if {{he has been in}} the least moved.|$|R
5000|$|Determining {{whether a}} {{positive}} or negative violation has occurred can be difficult. When there is no attitude or behavior change <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> concluded that a negative violation has occurred (possibly related to a boomerang effect).

6000|$|And then, {{drawing from}} her bosom {{the other half}} of the talisman, she fitted the two pieces {{together}} again and again, fingering them over, and poring upon them with tear-brimming eyes, till she had satisfied herself that the fracture still fitted exactly; while she murmured to herself from time to time--'Oh, that he were here!

6000|$|If the water-cure {{had done}} nothing more than {{establish}} {{the fact that the}} glow and joyousness of early life are things which may be restored after having been once wasted, it would have done a good work.

And though with us, who have passed to maturity, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> for the blessing, cannot something be done for the children who are yet to come after us? ...|$|E
