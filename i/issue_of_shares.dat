As well as building the canal, the Canal Company could build inclined planes, railways or rollers if required, and could optionally use {{the bed of the}} River Neath. The canal was to run from Glynneath (called Abernant at the time), which was not as far up the valley as Pontneddfechan, to Melincryddan Pill at Neath, where it would join the river. Thomas Dadford was employed as Engineer, and construction started from Neath, northwards towards Glynneath. The canal had reached the River Neath at Ynysbwllog by 1792, when Dadford resigned to take up work on the Monmouthshire Canal. He was replaced by Thomas Sheasby, who failed to complete the canal by the November 1793 deadline given to him, and was arrested in 1794 for irregularities in the accounts of the Glamorganshire Canal. The canal company completed the building work by 1795, using direct labour, although the lock into the river was never built. Rebuilding of locks and other improvements continued to be made for several years afterwards.|$|E

The anti-Communist Union of Democratic Forces (UDF) took office and between 1992 and 1994 the Berov Government carried through the privatisation of land and industry through the <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>shares</b> in government enterprises to all citizens, but these were accompanied by massive unemployment as uncompetitive industries failed and the backward state of Bulgaria's industry and infrastructure were revealed.

500|$|Gedde-Dahl was {{replaced}} by Kristian Åreskjold in March 1988. The company lost NOK15 million in 1987 and budgeted with a deficit of NOK13 million the following year. To cover the losses, the airline issued a private placement for NOK12 million and a public issue of NOK18 million. The airline retained only a single aircraft in operation until late 1989 and the staff of 50 to 60 employees {{was too much for}} the revenue form a single aircraft to cover. The airline planned to acquire a third aircraft in 1990 and budgeted with a profit of NOK7 million in 1989 and NOK32 million in 1990. Sun Tours filed for bankruptcy in late May 1988. However, Åreskjold stated that the bankruptcy [...] "came at a convenient time" [...] as in the short term Norway Airlines would fly back Sun Tours customers {{at the expense of the}} Norwegian Travel Guarantee Fund and that there was a deficit of aircraft on the European charter market. Within a week, Norway Airlines had signed a contract to fly with both aircraft for Britannia Airways out of London Gatwick Airport. A new <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>shares</b> for NOK25 to 30 million took place in June 1988 and the company stated its intent to list itself on the Trondheim Stock Exchange. Nils Erik Christensen had by then been appointed chairman.|$|E

"Stag profit" [...] is a {{situation}} {{in the stock market}} before and immediately after a company's Initial public offering (or any new <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>shares).</b> A [...] "stag" [...] is a party or individual who subscribes to the new issue expecting the price of the stock to rise immediately upon the start of trading.

2500|$|The largest land {{deal that}} he and Barings entered upon was the <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>shares</b> to finance the Louisiana Purchase in 1804, {{more than a year}} after the treaty was signed. He and Barings had been working on the deal for almost a decade, and sent young Alexander Baring as their agent to act in America, where he first {{negotiated}} a large land deal in Maine, then still a part of Massachusetts. While there, Alexander Baring helped settle a treaty with David Cobb. [...] The deal, completed in February 1796, gave Mr. Baring one-half interest in the [...] "Penobscot million" [...] and one-half interest in a third tract of acquired property north of this 1 million-acre (4,000km²) expanse. Baring, to become the first Baron Ashburton, was himself to play a role in both the economic and political history of Maine in general and Down East Maine in particular. Along with Daniel Webster, he negotiated the treaty that resolved the disputes over Maine's northwest boundary (Henry had family in Nova Scotia).|$|E

This <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>shares</b> amounted to 20% of the then issued capital, and they were taken up by existing shareholders. In the same year the company considerably extended its Knott Mill factory, at which time a visitor noted in particular the work in progress on [...] "several exceptionally large engines for iron and steel works" [...] (one had a 45 ton, 24 foot diameter flywheel and a total weight of 230 tons) and also a wood treatment plant for the Northern Wood Haskinising Company (haskinising was a wood preservation technique). There were reports at this time that the company had licensed and was developing Pictet's discovery of an improved method for the production of oxygen gas, although there were suggestions that this may have been as part of a syndicate involving other Manchester businesses. The plan was for Pictet to experiment further at the Galloway works and if the outcome was successful then a new company would be formed.|$|E

The efficiency consequences of this inconsistent treatment arise because of the concessional tax treatment of long-term capital gains.
