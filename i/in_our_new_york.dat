60|$|Such was the {{termination}} of this adventure; one that I have rightly termed memorable. In the end, Jack and Moses came in safe and sound; having probably swum ashore. They {{were found in the}} public road, only a short distance from the town, and were brought in to their master the same day. Every one who took any interest in horses--and what Dutchman does not?--knew Jack and Moses, and there was no difficulty in ascertaining to whom they belonged. What is singular, however, both sleighs were recovered; though at long intervals of time, and under very different circumstances. That of Guert, wolves' skins and all, actually went down the whole length of the river on the ice; passing out to sea through the Narrows. It must have gone by New York in the night, or doubtless it would have been picked up; while the difficulty of reaching it, was its protector on the descent, above the town. Once outside of the Narrows, it was thrown by the tide and winds upon the shore of Staten Island; where it was hauled to land, housed, and, being properly advertised <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> paper, Guert actually got tidings of it in time to receive it, skins and all, by one of the first sloops that ascended the Hudson that year; which was within a fortnight after the river had opened. The year 1758 was one of great activity, on account of the movements of the army, and no time was then unnecessarily lost.|$|E
6000|$|... [1] Mr. Hugh Littlepage {{writes a}} little sharply, {{but there is}} truth in all he says, at the bottom. His tone is {{probably}} produced {{by the fact that}} there is so serious an attempt to deprive him of his old paternal estate, an attempt which is receiving support in high quarters. In addition to this provocation, the Littlepages, as the manuscript shows farther on, are traduced, as one means of effecting the objects of the anti-renters; no man, in any community in which it is necessary to work on public sentiment in order to accomplish such a purpose, ever being wronged without being calumniated. As respects the inns, truth compels me, as an old traveller, to say that Mr. Littlepage has much reason for what he says. I have met with a better bed in the lowest French tavern I ever was compelled to use, and in one instance I slept in an inn frequented by carters, than in the best purely country inn in America. In the way of neatness, however, more is usually to be found <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> village taverns than in the public hotels of Paris itself. As for the hit touching the intelligence of the people, it is merited; for I have myself heard subtle distinctions drawn to show that the [...] "people" [...] of a former generation were not as knowing as the [...] "people" [...] of this, and imputing the covenants of the older leases to that circumstance, instead of imputing them to their true cause, the opinions and practices of the times. Half a century's experience would induce me to say that the [...] "people" [...] were never particularly dull in making a bargain.--EDITOR.|$|E

40|$|AbstractHistoplasma capsulatum is {{the most}} common endemic mycosis worldwide. Although most of the globe's largest urban hubs fall outside this organism's regions of endemicity, clinicians {{practicing}} in a metropolis like New York City or Los Angeles must nevertheless remain vigilant for histoplasmosis because of the large immigrant population that is served by its hospitals. H.  capsulatum infection ranges from asymptomatic pulmonary infection to life-threatening diffuse pneumonia with dissemination. The early years of the AIDS epidemic first introduced U. S. clinicians working in areas previously unfamiliar with histoplasmosis to newly immunocompromised patients from endemic regions presenting with disseminated H.  capsulatum originally acquired in their home countries. Improvement in HIV prevention and therapeutics has reduced the frequency of such cases. Herein we report three cases of histoplasmosis encountered <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> City institution {{over the last three years}} to emphasize that awareness of this infection remains mandatory for the frontline urban clinician...|$|E

40|$|Seismologists {{sometimes}} {{do their work}} of data acquisition and analysis against a tragic background. Usually the context is fieldwork far from home, in an area subjected to the natural but sometimes devastating effects of an earthquake. But {{in the present case}} we are <b>in</b> <b>our</b> own <b>New</b> <b>York</b> City area; that is, the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University, in Palisades, N. Y.; and the context is inhuman actions against people and the fabric of our society. As the appalling events of September 11 unfolded, we found that we had recorded numerous seismic signals from two plane impacts and building collapses from the two World Trade Center (WTC) towers, often at times different than those being reported elsewhere. Collapses of the two WTC towers generated large seismic waves, observed in five states and up to 428 km away. The North Tower collapse was the largest seismic source and had local magnitude ML 2. 3. From this we infer that ground shaking of the WTC towers was not a major contributor to the collapse or damage to surrounding buildings, but unfortunately we also conclude that from the distance at which our own detections were made (the nearest station is 34 km away at Palisades, N. Y.) {{it is not possible to}} infer (with detail sufficient to meet the demands of civil engineers in an emergency situation) just what the near-in ground motions must have been...|$|R
6000|$|I have myself {{little or}} no hope from what is {{technically}} called [...] "Society" [...] <b>in</b> <b>our</b> American cities. <b>New</b> <b>York,</b> of which place I have spoken so sharply, still promises something, in time, out of its tremendous and varied materials, with a certain superiority of intuitions, and the advantage of constant agitation, and ever new and rapid dealings of the cards. Of Boston, with its circles of social mummies, swathed in cerements harder than brass--its bloodless religion, (Unitarianism,) its complacent vanity of scientism and literature, lots of grammatical correctness, mere knowledge, (always wearisome, in itself)--its zealous abstractions, ghosts of reforms--I should say, (ever admitting its business powers, its sharp, almost demoniac, intellect, and no lack, in its own way, of courage and generosity)--there is, at present, little of cheering, satisfying sign. In the West, California, &c., [...] "society" [...] is yet unform'd, puerile, seemingly unconscious of anything above a driving business, or to liberally spend the money made by it, in the usual rounds and shows.|$|R

All have influenced the creation of the new. Six locations are the focus of the six part text. In each section the dialogic interplay of memoir and fiction explores the relevance of the experiential to the writing process. First and third-person voices are also used in the intertwining of the imagined and autobiographical which acts as a frame tale for the third-person fictional sections of the text. This auto-ethnographic approach seeks to reveal the small fissures through which the new emerges and give the reader insight into the creative process, particularly the role of the experiential in the imagined trajectories the writer follows. The intertwining of the two voices also reflects the intertwining of the imagined and researched in the creative-practice research...|$|R

While he was, it was {{occupied}} by his son Smith Thompson and his wife, Ellen King James. Among the visitors who came to the house in the later years was Ellen's young nephew Henry.

A scholarly review in International Journal of Kurdish Studies reported that [...] "such clarity is a welcome and refreshing antidote to the endless obfuscations that emanate from partisans {{on both sides of}} the issue."Also, Muslim journalist Reihan Salam called the book [...] "fascinating", and he has said that he considers it to be one of the most important books of the decade. The <b>New</b> <b>York</b> Review of Books wrote that [...] "one of the achievements of Reza Aslan's book is that it gives Islam as much internal complexity and diversity as the concepts 'the West' and 'America' possess <b>in</b> <b>our</b> eyes".
