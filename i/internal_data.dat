25|$|A {{fundamental}} {{distinction between}} Lisp and other languages {{is that in}} Lisp, the textual representation of a program is simply a human-readable description of the same <b>internal</b> <b>data</b> structures (linked lists, symbols, number, characters, etc.) as would {{be used by the}} underlying Lisp system.|$|E

40|$|The <b>internal</b> burst <b>data</b> {{from the}} EFW {{instrument}} on the Cluster mission have great potential but needs some processing {{before becoming a}} part of the Cluster Active Archive (CAA) where all other viable scientific data from the mission is represented. The aim of this thesis is to create a program that that can correct large quantities of the <b>internal</b> burst <b>data,</b> plot the data comparing it to the normal mode data, and save the results. Previously the data have been corrected on a case-to-case base. There will also be a detailed description how a new program will correct, plot and save these plots in a database for the <b>internal</b> burst <b>data.</b> Matlab is used for the data correction and plotting of the results.

These stress tests should not only consider the relevant <b>internal</b> <b>data</b> of the bank, but also macro-economic factors that might affect {{the accuracy of the}} rating system.|$|E
25|$|After World War II, the folklorist {{and author}} Stetson Kennedy {{infiltrated}} the Klan; he provided <b>internal</b> <b>data</b> to media {{and law enforcement}} agencies. He also provided secret code words to the writers of the Superman radio program, resulting in episodes in which Superman took on the KKK. Kennedy stripped away the Klan's mystique and trivialized its rituals and code words, which {{may have contributed to}} the decline in Klan recruiting and membership. In the 1950s, Kennedy wrote a bestselling book about his experiences, which further damaged the Klan.|$|E
25|$|The {{programmer}} is free {{to choose}} which semantics are more appropriate for each data structure in the application. Larger structures like windows would be defined as classes, allowing them to be passed around as pointers. Smaller structures, like a 2D point, {{can be defined as}} structs, which will be pass-by-value and allow direct access to their <b>internal</b> <b>data</b> with no dereference. The performance improvement inherent to the pass-by-value concept is such that Swift uses these types for almost all common data types, including Int and Double, and types normally represented by objects, like String and Array. Using value types can result in significant performance improvements in user applications also.|$|E

We have verified that this approach works in our sample but do not focus on this adjustment here. We focus on adjustments {{that do not require}} <b>internal</b> validation <b>data.</b> These circumstances arise more often in practice and the consequences of measurement error are more serious in these situations.|$|R
