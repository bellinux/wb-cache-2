50|$|Succeeding {{his father}} and his grandfather, Charles Pinat was the new ironmaster for Allevard {{at the turn of the}} century and former motive power {{engineer}} on the tramway of Lyon and ahead of his time directed the energy supply for his establishments from power generation through falls, dams, and power plants he planned to build along the course of the Breda. In 1917, during the First World War, the Allevard forges passed into the control of the Compagnie des forges et aciéries de la marine et d'Homécourt (Company of marine forges and steelworks and of Homécourt) (FAMH) under the guidance of Théodore Laurent. It was a time of great innovation - new hydro-electric developments on the Breda and concentration of production around springs, magnets, and <b>ferro-alloys.</b> The 1930 crisis significantly affected Allevard and severely restricted its production. In 1940, the defeat and catastrophic floods in the upper valley of Breda and even stopped all production for some time. Liberation marked the renewal of machinery (10,000 tons / year of rolled products) and a steady influx of immigrant workers on three industrial sites: The Gorge of Allevard - Champ Sappey, Saint-Pierre-d'Allevard, and Le Cheylas. Subsequent years would see the adoption of continuous casting and the unfortunate association with Ugine for the manufacture of magnets. In 1973-1974 the completion of the power station of Moulins marked paradoxically the end of the forges from their home since the 15th century.|$|E
5000|$|After the Civil War, {{the area}} {{began to grow}} as coal {{production}} escalated {{in the state of}} West Virginia and abundant water made the generation of power inexpensive. In {{the early part of the}} 1900s, a dam was constructed across the river from Glen Ferris. Trains operated on both sides of the river, carrying passengers as well as coal. In 1917, Union Carbide purchased a small hydro electrice plant in Glen Ferris, the brick remains of which can still be seen on the edge of the Kanawha River and which is being presently renovated. While continuing to operate this small plant, in 1929-30, Carbide built a much larger <b>ferro-alloys</b> plant at Alloy, a few miles downriver from Glen Ferris, which, at that time, was the world's largest <b>ferro-alloys</b> plant, employing some 2800 people, during its heyday from the time of its construction through the early 1960s. In order to generate power for the larger plant by diverting water from the New River, the company had a 3-mile long tunnel built through the mountain at Hawks Nest. The rock through which the tunnel was built consisted of 98% pure silica and caused acute silica poisoning among hundreds of unprotected workers, many of whom died. Many who died were buried close by in mass graves on the property which is now the Hawks Nest Country Club. At the time, the nearby town of Gauley Bridge became known as [...] "the town of the walking dead". The disaster became the focus of Congressional hearings in Washington, D.C., in the mid-thirties, and acute silicosis was identified as an occupational illness for the first time. The town of Glen Ferris followed the pattern already set by mine companies in the area. Union Carbide built a majority of the homes in Glen Ferris, as well as in other towns in the Upper Kanawha Valley and leased them to workers and their families. During its heyday, Union Carbide also provided a recreation hall in the upper end of the village. A post office/general store, an elementary school, a tennis court, a bowling alley, and a playground also served the residents. After the 1950s, as plant production declined, Union Carbide began to sell the houses to their occupants. In the 1970s, several homes were constructed on the mountainside above Glen Ferris in the north end of town; these would be Glen Ferris' largest homes and lead to its continued development as a place where people chose to live, primarily for its scenic views and in contrast to surrounding towns along Route 60. In recent years, several even larger homes have been built on the northern edge of Glen Ferris, close to Gauley Bridge. The elementary school was closed in 1961; the apostolic church stands there now. The town remains a picturesque spot for photographers. Views of the falls at the northern end of town and views of the Kanawha River and Gauley Bridge at the southern end of the village offer exceptionally scenic [...] "photo ops" [...] during every season. Nearby whitewater rafting on the New River Gorge has brought many tourists to the town.|$|E
40|$|The special <b>ferro-alloys</b> are {{the most}} {{important}} ingredients for special alloyed steel. They are much more expensive than basic <b>ferro-alloys</b> and there are fewer producers.

The market for special <b>ferro-alloys</b> depends on the offer of specific metals which form the ferro-alloy, the market for special steel and stainless steels and - sometimes - speculative operations.

40|$|Authorities that {{regulate}} environmental issues pertaining to industrial wastes in South Africa regard landfill disposal {{as the only}} effective environmental management option for slag and other inorganic by-products from the <b>ferro-alloy</b> industry. Metallurgical slags are widely utilised in civil engineering and construction applications in {{other countries in the}} world and in line with the overall philosophy of conserving mineral and other natural resources, these materials should be assessed for the possibility of resource recovery, recycling, reclamation, direct re-use or alternative uses. This presentation describes a risk-based approach for the assessment of by-products from the <b>ferro-alloy</b> industry for alternative use. Once a by-product from an industrial process has been identified for alternative use, its intended use would be defined, but it will not be possible to control its actual use or misuse in society, nor will it be possible to control its fate during the application life cycle. In the interest of protection of human health and the environment, potential risks associated with the handling and uses of a material throughout its life cycle therefore have to be quantified. The assessment has to include both human health and ecological risks and must cover the entire life cycle of a product, from its production up to its end-of-life disposal. The presentation introduces the concept of tiered risk assessment and demonstrates how this applies in the overall assessment of by-products from metallurgical industry sector for safe use in society. 1...|$|R
