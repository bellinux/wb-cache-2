40|$|AbstractThis paper {{compares the}} {{technical}} efficiency and production frontier of dairy processing cooperatives and <b>investor</b> <b>owned</b> firms in six major dairy producing European countries. Two parametric production frontiers are estimated, i. e. for cooperatives and <b>investor</b> <b>owned</b> firms separately, {{which are used}} to evaluate the intra- and inter-type technical efficiency of each firm. The models are estimated using accountancy data from the AMADEUS data base over the years 1995 - 2005. Results show that dairy cooperatives have a more productive technology, but are slightly less efficient than <b>investor</b> <b>owned</b> firms during this period. Differences in production technology and technical efficiency of the cooperatives across countries reflect differences in local market conditions and characteristics of the companies. Both cooperatives and <b>investor</b> <b>owned</b> firms are characterized by decreasing returns to scale. However, returns to scale are on average much smaller for cooperatives, implying that the scale of operation of cooperatives is too large...|$|R

40|$|Cooperative {{business}} {{firms are}} prevalent in agribusiness, yet no concise generalized model exists {{to demonstrate how}} and why cooperative firms differ from, and may be selected over, the more common <b>investor</b> <b>owned</b> business firm. It is shown within a generic transaction game that cooperatives fill both producer and consumer roles as an aggregated player {{that is expected to}} maximize aggregate producer and consumer payoffs rather than maximizing either payoff separately, which contrasts with <b>investor</b> <b>owned</b> firms as essentially two player games between separate and competing producers and consumers where each player seeks to maximize their separate payoff individually. A cardinally valued game theoretic matrix is used to demonstrate the expected differences between these one-player versus two-player games, which clearly demonstrates that cooperatives are expected to achieve greater total payoffs and social welfare relative to <b>investor</b> <b>owned</b> firms, because <b>investor</b> <b>owned</b> firms generate dead weight loss when maximizing producer surpluses as expected under prevailing microeconomic theory. The use of cardinal payoff values rather than ordinal is important because it permits aggregation of payoffs within the model, and because it directly reflects the cardinal payoffs actually used in agribusiness decisions, such as revenue, expense and profit measures. The results may indicate the reason that cooperative firms are selected and have been successful in agribusiness. However, weaknesses of the cooperative model are also discussed, conjecturing that cooperatives may be preferable to <b>investor</b> <b>owned</b> businesses under limited circumstances but because these circumstances occur frequently in agribusiness the cooperative model is observed more frequently there.

40|$|Providing a {{performance}} measure of any firm {{is a crucial}} issue, {{not only for the}} stakeholders of the firm, but also for policy makers, labor unions, and economists. The relevant performance measures should consider the objectives of the firm’s owners. The ownership structure of cooperatives is different from that of <b>investors</b> <b>owned</b> firms, which in principle implies the need of different tools to measure their performance. Typically, however, the performance of cooperatives and <b>investor</b> <b>owned</b> firm is mostly compared using the same approach. In this study, we use Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to compare the performance of dairy cooperatives and <b>investor</b> <b>owned</b> firms in major European dairy producing countries using a traditional approach, which views both types of firms as cost minimizers, and an alternative approach, which considers the objectives of the cooperatives. In the alternatives approach, two hyperbolic models were evaluated, one of them consider the firms to expand both output production and use of material to address the objective of the owners of the cooperatives. The performance of the cooperatives changes across the two approaches form being out performed by IOFs using the traditional approach to outperforming IOFs when using an approach that is in line with the objective of the cooperative.
