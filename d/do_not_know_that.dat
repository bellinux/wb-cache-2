25|$|Tillemont and Le Beau {{regard the}} revolt of Illus {{as an attempt}} to re-establish paganism; but for this view there seems no foundation. We <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> Illus was a pagan, though Pamprepius was one: {{it is more likely that}} Illus was a man of no fixed {{religious}} principles, and that his revolt originated either in ambition, or in a conviction that his only prospect of safety from the intrigues of his enemies and the suspicions of Zeno was the dethronement of the emperor. It is remarkable that Edward Gibbon does not mention the name of Illus, and scarcely notices his revolt.|$|E
25|$|An {{analytic}} proposition is true {{by nature}} {{of the meaning of}} the words in the sentence — we require no further knowledge than a grasp of the language to understand this proposition. On the other hand, a synthetic statement is one that tells us something about the world. The truth or falsehood of synthetic statements derives from something outside their linguistic content. In this instance, weight is not a necessary predicate of the body; until we are told the heaviness of the body we <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> it has weight. In this case, experience of the body is required before its heaviness becomes clear. Before Kant's first Critique, empiricists (cf. Hume) and rationalists (cf. Leibniz) assumed that all synthetic statements required experience to be known.|$|E

25|$|STD may refer only to {{infections that}} are causing diseases, {{or it may}} be used more loosely as a synonym for STI. Most of the time, people <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> they are {{infected}} with an STI until they are tested or start showing symptoms of disease. Moreover, the term sexually transmissible disease is sometimes used since it is less restrictive in consideration of other factors or means of transmission. For instance, meningitis is transmissible by means of sexual contact but is not labeled an STI because sexual contact is not the primary vector for the pathogens that cause meningitis. This discrepancy is addressed by the probability of infection by means other than sexual contact. In general, an STI is an infection that has a negligible probability of transmission by means other than sexual contact, but has a realistic means of transmission by sexual contact (more sophisticated means—blood transfusion, sharing of hypodermic needles—are not taken into account). Thus, one may presume that, if a person is infected with an STI, e.g., chlamydia, gonorrhea, genital herpes, HPV it was transmitted to him/her by means of sexual contact.|$|E
500|$|... many {{medical care}} {{providers}} have a poor understanding of {{key aspects of}} pain management, including assessment, dosing, tolerance, addiction, and side effects, and many <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> pain can be well controlled in most cases. In Canada, for instance, veterinarians get five times more training in pain than do physicians, and three times more training than nurses. Physicians may also undertreat pain {{out of fear of}} being audited by a regulatory body.|$|E
500|$|In Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, the United States Supreme Court {{established}} {{a framework for}} determining whether a suspect's consent is voluntary. The Court noted that historically, when [...] "determining whether a defendant's will was overborne in a particular case, the Court has assessed the totality of all the surrounding circumstances—both {{the characteristics of the}} accused and the details of the interrogation". Consequently, the Court held that voluntariness should be determined [...] "from the totality of all the circumstances". The Court also clarified that judges should examine the [...] "possibly vulnerable subjective state of the person who consents" [...] to determine whether a suspect was coerced into consenting, and [...] "account must be taken of subtly coercive police questions". However, the Court also held that suspects may still give valid consent even if they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> they can refuse to consent to the search.|$|E

500|$|In Longacre's {{first years}} as chief engraver, no {{original}} designs were required for coins. [...] Gobrecht had redesigned every denomination of U.S. coinage between 1835 and 1842, {{and his successor}} had time to learn arts necessary for coin production {{that he had not}} needed as a maker of print engravings. [...] These arts included coin design, making of punches for design elements, and die sinking. Longacre's work in the private sector had involved cutting lines into a copper plate which was then used to print reproductions. Patterson wrote in August 1845 to Treasury Secretary Robert J. Walker that Longacre [...] "is a gentleman of excellent character, highly regarded in this community, and has acquired some celebrity as an engraver of copper; but he is not a Die-Sinker. [...] Indeed I <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> he has ever made an attempt in this art." [...] By December of that year, the Mint director had written to Walker in praise of Longacre, stating that the engraver had [...] "more taste and judgment in making devices for an improved coinage here than have been exhibited by any of his predecessors. [...] He has shown too that he is quite competent to make the required model from his drawings." [...] Taxay attributed Patterson's lavish praise of Longacre to continued attempts by Leonard to gain the post of chief engraver.|$|E
500|$|Perry is the docile pet platypus of the blended Flynn-Fletcher family, who adopted {{him because}} his unfocused gaze {{made it seem}} as if he were looking at both Phineas and Ferb at the same time, as shown in the 2011 movie, [...] Unbeknownst to them, Perry lives a double life as a crime-fighting spy working for the [...] "Organization Without a Cool Acronym"/The OWCA, going by the codename [...] "Agent P." [...] He reports to his superior, Major Monogram, via {{telecast}} in his large, high-tech, underground hideout. Every day, he engages in battles with the evil scientist Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz, who tries using inventions to take over the tri-state area. Perry is always able to foil Doofenshmirtz's plans and in doing so accidentally leads to the destruction of whatever form of contraption his owners, Phineas Flynn and Ferb Fletcher, are building in order to make summer better. Phineas and Ferb are aware that something happens to get rid of their scheme for the day, but <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> Perry is the cause behind it and are largely dismissive of it. Their sister, Candace, also does not know that Perry is behind the destruction and is driven to near insanity trying to figure it out. Throughout the series, Perry is aware of Phineas and Ferb's inventions, but is largely uninterested in them, save whenever he notices that their latest invention may help him thwart Doofenshmirtz.|$|E

2500|$|The {{purpose of}} that {{project is to}} provide {{profiles}} of human development approaches and modes of awareness, and their relationships, as perceived by different beliefs systems, disciplines, religions, and cultures. Much of the material in this section is about the limitations of language in expressing levels of significance beyond that which can be effectively captured by words, so that, seemingly, {{what we need to}} understand may only be expressible in a [...] "language" [...] that we <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know!</b> <b>That</b> paradox is explored in a page entitled Language and the reconstruction of reality.

2500|$|As secession loomed, President James Buchanan was {{concerned}} about the safety of United States property in South Carolina. [...] Miles, returning to Washington for the upcoming session of Congress, was one of the South Carolina delegates who met with Buchanan to discuss this problem. On December 10 Miles and the others presented a letter to the President that assured him that the forts in Charleston would not be molested [...] "provided that no reinforcement should be sent into those forts, and their relative military status" [...] maintained. Buchanan questioned the word “provided” since it appeared to bind him, but the delegates assured him that they were only communicating their understanding based on the status quo. [...] According to both Miles and fellow South Carolina fire-eater Laurence M. Keitt, Buchanan said, [...] "After all, {{this is a matter of}} honor among gentlemen.

[...] "For the Palestinian people, death has become an industry, at which women excel, and so do all the people living on this land. The elderly excel at this, {{and so do the}} mujahideen and the children," [...] Hammad is quoted as saying.

[...] In his review of A Sicilian Idyll, Yeats wrote, [...] "Mrs. Edward Emery (Florence Farr) …won universal praise with her striking beauty and subtle gesture and fine delivery of the verse. Indeed her acting was the feature of the whole performance that struck one most, after the verse itself. I <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> I have any word too strong to express my admiration for its grace and power…I have never heard verse better spoken."
