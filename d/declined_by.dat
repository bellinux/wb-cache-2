An estimate of 40 percent loss in the production of five major groups of agricultural commodities is simulated into the model. The model results show that the State’s economy-wide total production <b>declines</b> <b>by</b> 2. 3 percent. In 2001 - 02 dollar terms this production decline is worth more than $ 2. 5 billion. The gross state product (GSP) for WA <b>declines</b> <b>by</b> more than one percent.

5|$|Angel sharks {{in general}} are highly {{threatened}} by commercial trawl fisheries due to their susceptibility to capture and low rate of reproduction, and angel shark species elsewhere {{are known to have}} declined markedly under fishing pressure. Trawling activity in the Yellow Sea {{and other parts of the}} northwestern Pacific is intense and, coupled with pollution, has had a serious impact on the local ecosystem. The Japanese angelshark population is suspected to have <b>declined</b> <b>by</b> up to 50% or more under these conditions, leading the species to be assessed as Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). It may benefit from a ban on trawling imposed in some areas by the Chinese government, though enforcement is inconsistent.|$|E
