5|$|Supported by {{formation}} of the Committee on the Status of Women in the <b>Economics</b> Profession (CSWEP) in 1972, gender-based critiques of traditional <b>economics</b> appeared in the 1970s and 80s. The subsequent emergence of Development Alternatives with Women for a New Era (DAWN) and the 1992 founding of the International Association for Feminist <b>Economics</b> (IAFFE) along with its journal Feminist <b>Economics</b> in 1994 encouraged {{the rapid growth of}} feminist <b>economics.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Faculty of Social Sciences and <b>Economics</b> was {{established}} in 1975, by the fusion of the Departments of Social Sciences and <b>Economics.</b> Its origins {{can be traced to}} 1958, when the Division of <b>Economics</b> was created. It offers the bachelor's degrees in <b>Economics</b> and Sociology, and the master's degrees by research in Applied <b>Economics,</b> and Sociology.|$|E
5|$|By 1909 Keynes had {{published}} his first professional <b>economics</b> {{article in the}} <b>Economics</b> Journal, {{about the effect of}} a recent global economic downturn on India. He founded the Political Economy Club, a weekly discussion group. Also in 1909, Keynes accepted a lectureship in <b>economics</b> funded personally by Alfred Marshall. Keynes's earnings rose further as he began to take on pupils for private tuition.|$|E
5|$|Feminist <b>economics</b> is the {{critical}} study of <b>economics</b> including its methodology, epistemology, history and empirical research, attempting to overcome androcentric (male and patriarchal) biases. It focuses on topics of particular relevance to women, such as care work or occupational segregation (exclusion of women and minorities from certain fields); deficiencies of economic models, such as disregarding intra-household bargaining; new forms of data collection and measurement such as the Gender Empowerment Measure (GEM), and more gender-aware theories such as the capabilities approach. Feminist <b>economics</b> ultimately seeks to produce a more gender inclusive <b>economics.</b>|$|E
5|$|Feminist <b>economics</b> shares {{many of its}} {{perspectives}} with ecological <b>economics</b> and {{the more}} applied field of green economy, including the focus on sustainability, nature, justice and care values.|$|E

5|$|Having been {{diagnosed}} with tuberculosis and diabetes, Aaronson did not {{serve in the military}} during the First World War. Between 1913 and 1915, and again between 1926 and 1928, he studied <b>economics</b> with a special focus on public administration at the London School of <b>Economics,</b> but never completed his degree.|$|E
5|$|In 1932, Friedman {{graduated}} from Rutgers University, where he specialized {{in mathematics and}} <b>economics</b> and initially intended to become an actuary. During his time at Rutgers, Friedman became influenced by two <b>economics</b> professors, Arthur F. Burns and Homer Jones, who convinced him that modern <b>economics</b> could help end the Great Depression.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, Miliband gained four A Levels—in Mathematics (A), English (A), Further Mathematics (B) and Physics (B)—and {{then read}} Philosophy, Politics and <b>Economics</b> at Corpus Christi College, Oxford. In his first year, {{he was elected}} JCR President, leading a student {{campaign}} against a rise in rent charges. In his second year he dropped philosophy, and was awarded an upper second class Bachelor of Arts degree. He went on to graduate from the London School of <b>Economics</b> with a Master of Science in <b>Economics.</b>|$|E

5|$|Margunn Bjørnholt and Ailsa McKay {{argue that}} the {{financial}} crisis of 2007–08 and the response to it revealed a crisis of ideas in mainstream <b>economics</b> and within the <b>economics</b> profession, and call for a reshaping of both the economy, economic theory and the <b>economics</b> profession. They argue that such a reshaping should include new advances within feminist <b>economics</b> that take as their starting point the socially responsible, sensible and accountable subject in creating an economy and economic theories that fully acknowledge care for each other {{as well as the}} planet.|$|E
5|$|One of Morgan's stated {{interests}} was to lead {{a program}} of research into household practices; {{she did not want}} to teach traditional home <b>economics</b> principles if they could not be supported by science. This meant that her students were required to possess a science background that was more stringent than other U.S. home <b>economics</b> programs. Consequently, her graduates found themselves prepared for roles that had not usually been open to traditional home <b>economics</b> graduates, such as hospital nutrition management and teaching in the basic sciences.|$|E
5|$|The 2008 {{financial}} crisis and subsequent recession highlighted limitations of existing macroeconomic theories, models, and econometrics. The popular press discussed post-Keynesian <b>economics</b> and Austrian <b>economics,</b> two heterodox traditions that have little influence on mainstream <b>economics.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Nobel Prizes {{are awarded}} {{annually}} by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, the Swedish Academy, the Karolinska Institute, and the Norwegian Nobel Committee {{to individuals who}} make outstanding contributions {{in the fields of}} Chemistry, Physics, Literature, Peace, Physiology or Medicine and <b>Economics.</b> All but the <b>economics</b> prize were established by the 1895 will of Alfred Nobel, which dictates that the awards should be administered by the Nobel Foundation. The Nobel prize in <b>Economics,</b> or The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, was established in 1968 by the Sveriges Riksbank, the central bank of Sweden, for outstanding contributions in the field of <b>Economics.</b> Each prize is awarded by a separate committee; the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awards the Prizes in Physics, Chemistry, and <b>Economics,</b> the Swedish Academy awards the Prize in Literature, the Karolinska Institute awards the Prize in Physiology or Medicine, and the Norwegian Nobel Committee awards the Prize in Peace. Each recipient receives a medal, a diploma and a cash prize that has varied throughout the years.|$|E
5|$|The global {{financial}} crisis of 2007–08 led to public {{skepticism about the}} free market consensus even from some on the economic right. In March 2008, Martin Wolf, chief <b>economics</b> commentator at the Financial Times, announced {{the death of the}} dream of global free-market capitalism. In the same month macroeconomist James K. Galbraith used the 25th Annual Milton Friedman Distinguished Lecture to launch a sweeping attack against the consensus for monetarist <b>economics</b> and argued that Keynesian <b>economics</b> were far more relevant for tackling the emerging crises.|$|E
5|$|The {{proposed}} degree would {{consist of}} courses not only in agricultural <b>economics,</b> but also agriculture, land <b>economics,</b> farm management, rural sociology, statistics, mathematics, economic history, and economic policy. After a delay spent obtaining funding for the new program, the faculty was established and began instruction in March 1958. Between 1960 and 1985, 450 students graduated from the program. In 1980, the Commonwealth government named New England as a Key Centre for Advanced Training in Agricultural <b>Economics.</b>|$|E
5|$|Tsakalotos {{was born}} in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, but moved to the United Kingdom at a young age. He went to St Paul's School in London before {{studying}} Philosophy, Politics and <b>Economics</b> at The Queen's College, Oxford. He went on to complete a master's degree at the Institute of Development Studies, attached to the University of Sussex and returned to Oxford to complete a doctorate in <b>economics</b> {{under the supervision of}} Włodzimierz Brus, which he did in 1989. From 1989 to 1993, Tsakalotos worked at the University of Kent, where he met his partner, Heather D. Gibson. He moved to Greece, and taught at the Athens University of <b>Economics</b> and Business from 1994 to 2010, becoming a professor of <b>economics.</b> Since 2010, he has been a professor of <b>economics</b> at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens. He has written a number of books in both Greek and English and has been published in a range of different academic journals.|$|E

5|$|The Austrian School of <b>economics</b> {{began with}} Carl Menger's 1871 Principles of <b>Economics.</b> Menger's {{followers}} formed a distinct group of economists until around the World War II when {{the distinction between}} Austrian <b>economics</b> and other schools of thought had largely broken down. The Austrian tradition survived as a distinct school, however, through the works of Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich Hayek. Present-day Austrians are distinguished by their interest in earlier Austrian works and abstention from standard empirical methodology including econometrics. Austrians also focus on market processes instead of equilibrium. Mainstream economists are generally critical of its methodology.|$|E
25|$|Within {{macroeconomics}} there is, {{in general}} {{order of their}} appearance in the literature; classical <b>economics,</b> Keynesian <b>economics,</b> the neoclassical synthesis, post-Keynesian <b>economics,</b> monetarism, new classical <b>economics,</b> and supply-side <b>economics.</b> Alternative developments include ecological <b>economics,</b> constitutional <b>economics,</b> institutional <b>economics,</b> evolutionary <b>economics,</b> dependency theory, structuralist <b>economics,</b> world systems theory, econophysics, feminist <b>economics</b> and biophysical <b>economics.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Economics</b> is one {{social science}} among several and has fields {{bordering}} on other areas, including economic geography, economic history, public choice, energy <b>economics,</b> , family <b>economics</b> and institutional <b>economics.</b>|$|E
25|$|Among U.S. {{university}} <b>economics</b> programs, in 2010 UCSB {{was ranked}} the 6th for experimental <b>economics,</b> 3rd for environmental <b>economics,</b> and 12th for {{cognitive and behavioral}} <b>economics</b> by RePEc.|$|E
25|$|Neoclassical <b>economics</b> dominates microeconomics, and {{together}} with Keynesian <b>economics</b> forms the neoclassical synthesis which dominates mainstream <b>economics</b> today. Although neoclassical <b>economics</b> has gained widespread acceptance by contemporary economists, {{there have been}} many critiques of neoclassical <b>economics,</b> often incorporated into newer versions of neoclassical theory.|$|E
25|$|Other modern {{schools of}} {{economic}} thought are New Classical <b>economics</b> and New Keynesian <b>economics.</b> New Classical <b>economics</b> {{was developed in}} the 1970s, emphasizing solid microeconomics as the basis for macroeconomic growth. New Keynesian <b>economics</b> was created partially in response to New Classical <b>economics,</b> and deals with how inefficiencies in the market create a need for control by a central bank or government.|$|E
25|$|Klepper {{received}} his B.A. in <b>Economics</b> in 1970; M.A. in <b>Economics</b> in 1972, and Ph.D. in <b>economics</b> in 1975 all from Cornell University.|$|E
25|$|Mainstream <b>economics</b> has {{attempted}} to become a value-free 'hard science', but ecological economists argue that value-free <b>economics</b> is generally not realistic. Ecological <b>economics</b> is more willing to entertain alternative conceptions of utility, efficiency, and cost-benefits such as positional analysis or multi-criteria analysis. Ecological <b>economics</b> is typically viewed as <b>economics</b> for sustainable development, and may have goals similar to green politics.|$|E
25|$|Neo{{classical}}, {{as well as}} classical <b>economics,</b> are not subsumed {{under the}} term happiness <b>economics</b> although the original goal was to increase the happiness of the people. Classical and neoclassical <b>economics</b> are stages {{in the development of}} welfare <b>economics</b> and are characterized by mathematical modeling. Happiness <b>economics</b> represents a radical break with this tradition. The measurement of subjective happiness respectively life satisfaction by means of survey research across nations and time (in addition to objective measures like lifespan, wealth, security etc.) marks the beginning of happiness <b>economics.</b>|$|E
25|$|Neoclassical <b>economics</b> is {{occasionally}} {{referred as}} orthodox <b>economics</b> whether by its critics or sympathizers. Modern mainstream <b>economics</b> builds on neoclassical <b>economics</b> but with many refinements that either supplement or generalize earlier analysis, such as econometrics, game theory, analysis of market failure and imperfect competition, and the neoclassical model {{of economic growth}} for analysing long-run variables affecting national income.|$|E
25|$|It {{was later}} used by John Hicks, George Stigler, {{and others to}} include the work of Carl Menger, William Stanley Jevons, Léon Walras, John Bates Clark, and many others. Today it is usually {{used to refer to}} {{mainstream}} <b>economics,</b> although it has also been used as an umbrella term encompassing a number of other schools of thought, notably excluding institutional <b>economics,</b> various historical schools of <b>economics,</b> and Marxian <b>economics,</b> in addition to various other heterodox approaches to <b>economics.</b>|$|E
