It allows you to imagine you {{yourself}} are not just one person; you're so many. That person has so many stories and memories to draw from, and they all affect your journey profusely. I'm battered quite brutally at the beginning of the video, but at the end, I'm not battered; I'm a bit strange. It's not meant to be an answer video; it's meant to be a profuse number of the question.|$|E

500|$|... 48 {{hours before}} the film got the {{official}} green light from Fox, the studio cut the film's budget by $7–8 million, down to $58 million. This forced a last minute re-write that saw about 9 pages cut from the previously 110 page script. Changes included the removal of a motorcycle chase {{at the end of}} the Twelve Bullets Fight, and having Deadpool forget his bag of guns before the final battle sequence to avoid having a costly gun fight in the third act. Reese said, [...] "It was that last, lean and mean chop that got us to a place where Fox was willing to make it. The script was very efficient and not too long. That was a function of budget more than anything, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> made the movie pace nicely." ...|$|E

500|$|Aronofsky had {{the idea}} for The Wrestler for over a decade. He hired Robert D. Siegal to turn his idea into a script. The actor Nicolas Cage entered {{negotiations}} in October 2007 to star as Randy, the film's protagonist. The following month Cage left the project, and Mickey Rourke replaced him in the lead role. Aronofsky said that Cage {{pulled out of the}} movie because Aronofsky wanted Rourke to star; Aronofsky said, stating that Cage was [...] "a complete gentleman, and he understood that my heart was with Mickey and he stepped aside. I have so much respect for Nic Cage as an actor and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> could have worked with Nic but, you know, Nic was incredibly supportive of Mickey and he is old friends with Mickey and really wanted to help with this opportunity, so he pulled himself out of the race." [...] Cage responded, [...] "I wasn't quote 'dropped' from the movie. I resigned from the movie because I didn't think I had enough time to achieve the look of the wrestler who was on steroids, which I would never do".

The episode {{is only one of}} two season premieres Cherry did not write himself, as he took on a reduced production role for the eighth season in order to develop several new series while Daily was given more creative authority. According to Daily, the series' ending allowed the writers more artistic freedom while developing storylines. [...] "You get to do story lines that you wouldn't otherwise do because you don't {{have to worry about the}} ramifications," [...] he explained. [...] "So people can move, people can die, people can have babies and you don't have to worry about the babies growing up." [...] The episode introduced Bree's blackmail storyline, which recalls the first season's mystery storyline surrounding series narrator Mary Alice's suicide. Daily stated that the similarity between the storylines was intentional: [...] "We’re kind of just diving into the DNA of the series a little bit. Are there any unanswered questions floating around out there? Any characters we need to check in with one more time?" [...] Cherry noted that the [...] "mystery hearkens back to the first season, going back to the roots of Mary Alice [...] This feels right for that mystery to take us out this year." [...] Brenda Strong commented that [...] "It’s the smartest way to end the series, to finish where you began. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>really</b> cements it in the psyche of the audience and gives them a sense of completion." ...|$|E
