The fishermen often face problems due to a giant shark that disrupts their way of life. Shiva asserts that he alone can defeat the shark. After a long battle, Shiva subdues the shark (which is actually Nandi in disguise) and remarries Parvati.|$|E
5|$|In January 2013, a {{privilege}} escalation exploit {{was discovered in}} the Windows kernel that can allow unsigned code to run under Windows RT; the exploit involved {{the use of a}} remote debugging tool (provided by Microsoft to debug WinRT apps on Windows RT devices) to execute code which changes the signing level stored in RAM to allow unsigned code to execute (by default, it is set to a level that only allows code signed by Microsoft to execute). Alongside <b>his</b> <b>explanation</b> of the exploit, the developer also included a personal appeal to Microsoft urging them to remove the restrictions on Windows RT devices, contending that their decision was not for technical reasons, and that the devices would be more valuable if this functionality were available. In a statement, a Microsoft spokesperson applauded the effort, indicating that the exploit does not pose a security threat because it requires administrative access to the device, advanced techniques, and would still require programs to be re-compiled for ARM. However, Microsoft has still indicated that the exploit would be patched in a future update.|$|E

25|$|Isaac Newton (1642–1727) was {{the first}} person to explain tides as the product of the {{gravitational}} attraction of astronomical masses. <b>His</b> <b>explanation</b> of the tides (and many other phenomena) was published in the Principia (1687) and used his theory of universal gravitation to explain the lunar and solar attractions as the origin of the tide-generating forces.|$|E
25|$|Bradley {{eventually}} developed <b>his</b> <b>explanation</b> of aberration {{in about}} September 1728 and this theory {{was presented to}} the Royal Society in mid January the following year.

25|$|Democritus (460 BC) {{thought that}} the {{essential}} characteristic of life is having a soul (psyche).

He elaborates on fire because of the apparent connection between life and heat, and because fire moves.|$|E

25|$|The Kabbalistic account {{explains}} {{this difference}} in terms of the Four Worlds. All prophecy emanates from the divine chokhmah (wisdom) realm of Atziluth.

Isaiah's prophecy saw the Merkabah in the World of Beriah divine understanding, restraining <b>his</b> <b>explanation</b> by realising the inadequacy of description. Ezekiel saw the Merkabah in the lower World of Yetzirah divine emotions, causing him to describe the vision in rapturous detail.|$|E

25|$|Eusebius {{does not}} {{acknowledge}} Origen {{as one of}} his sources for the reference to James in Josephus. However, John Painter states that placing the blame for the siege of Jerusalem on the death of James is perhaps an early Christian invention that predates both Origen and Eusebius and that it likely existed in the traditions to which they were both exposed. Painter states that it is likely that Eusebius may have obtained <b>his</b> <b>explanation</b> of the siege of Jerusalem from Origen.|$|E

25|$|The idea {{of light}} quanta contradicted the wave theory {{of light that}} {{followed}} naturally from James Clerk Maxwell's equations for electromagnetic behavior and, more generally, the assumption of infinite divisibility of energy in physical systems.

However, by 1921, when {{he was awarded the}} Nobel Prize and his work on photoelectricity was mentioned by name in the award citation, most physicists thought that light quanta were possible.
