25|$|Over {{the complex}} numbers the <b>definite</b> <b>integral</b> (for {{negative}} values of n and x) {{can be defined}} via contour integration, but then depends on choice of path, specifically winding number – the geometric issue is that the function defines a covering space with a singularity at0.|$|E
25|$|John Wallis algebrised this method: {{he wrote}} in his Arithmetica Infinitorum (1656) series that we now call the <b>definite</b> <b>integral,</b> and he {{calculated}} their values. Isaac Barrow and James Gregory made further progress: quadratures for some algebraic curves and spirals. Christiaan Huygens successfully performed a quadrature of some Solids of revolution.|$|E
25|$|Further, for {{negative}} fractional (non-integer) values of n, the power x'n is not well-defined, hence the indefinite integral is only defined for positive x. However, for n a negative integer the power x'n is defined for all non-zero x, and the indefinite integrals and definite integrals are defined, {{and can be}} computed via a symmetry argument, replacing x by x, and basing the negative <b>definite</b> <b>integral</b> at1.|$|E

25|$|The {{fundamental}} theorem of calculus {{states that}} differentiation and integration are inverse operations. More precisely, it relates {{the values of}} antiderivatives to definite integrals. Because it is usually easier to compute an antiderivative than to apply {{the definition of a}} <b>definite</b> <b>integral,</b> the fundamental theorem of calculus provides a practical way of computing definite integrals. It can also be interpreted as a precise statement of the fact that differentiation is the inverse of integration.|$|E
25|$|A surface {{integral}} is a <b>definite</b> <b>integral</b> taken over a surface (which {{may be a}} curved set in space); it {{can be thought of}} as the double integral analog of the line integral. The function to be integrated may be a scalar field or a vector field. The value of the {{surface integral}} is the sum of the field at all points on the surface. This can be achieved by splitting the surface into surface elements, which provide the partitioning for Riemann sums.|$|E
25|$|In {{numerical}} analysis, numerical integration {{constitutes a}} broad family of algorithms for calculating the numerical {{value of a}} <b>definite</b> <b>integral,</b> and by extension, the term is also sometimes {{used to describe the}} numerical solution of differential equations. This article focuses on calculation of definite integrals. The term numerical quadrature (often abbreviated to quadrature) is more or less a synonym for numerical integration, especially as applied to one-dimensional integrals. Some authors refer to numerical integration over more than one dimension as cubature; others take quadrature to include higher-dimensional integration.|$|E
