5|$|In 2001, Corzine coauthored (with Bob Graham) a tax-cut {{proposal}} {{aimed at}} lowering the marginal tax bracket from 15% to 10% {{on the first}} $19,000 of taxable income. In 2002, he proposed a tax cut that exempted the first $10,000 of income from the $765 of Social Security taxes for both <b>employers</b> <b>and</b> <b>employees.</b> Corzine also proposed making dividend payments tax deductible to companies {{as a form of}} economic stimulus.|$|E
5|$|In February 1974, President Nixon {{proposed}} {{more comprehensive}} health insurance reform—an employer mandate to offer {{private health insurance}} if employees volunteered to pay 25 percent of premiums, replacement of Medicaid by state-run health insurance plans available to all with income-based premiums and cost sharing, and replacement of Medicare with a new federal program that eliminated the limit on hospital days, added income-based out-of-pocket limits, and added outpatient prescription drug coverage. In April 1974, Kennedy and Mills introduced a bill for near-universal national health insurance with benefits identical to the expanded Nixon plan—but with mandatory participation by <b>employers</b> <b>and</b> <b>employees</b> through payroll taxes—both plans were criticized by labor, consumer, and senior citizen organizations because of their substantial cost sharing. In August 1974, after Nixon's resignation and President Ford's call for health insurance reform, Mills tried to advance a compromise based on Nixon's plan—but with mandatory participation by <b>employers</b> <b>and</b> <b>employees</b> through premiums to private health insurance companies—but gave up when unable to get more than a 13–12 majority of his committee to support his compromise plan.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{research}} was to explore the challenges faced by both <b>employer</b> <b>and</b> <b>employee</b> when the later undergoes active cancer treatment from a systemic perspective. A qualitative research was conducted using {{a case study of}} six sessions with both <b>employer</b> <b>and</b> <b>employee.</b> The study revealed that the <b>employer</b> <b>and</b> <b>employee</b> defined their relationship and boundaries as a system. The research project made a great impact on the researchers’ map regarding cancer or any other symptom, the person with cancer <b>and</b> the <b>employer.</b> In the researcher’s old map, before the research project, cancer implied a very threatening disease which rendered both the <b>employer</b> <b>and</b> the <b>employee</b> helpless <b>and</b> powerless. Through the research project the researcher discovered the significance of not having preconceived ideas as according to this study both the <b>employer</b> <b>and</b> <b>employee</b> had the freedom to punctuate their challenges in relation to the latter undergoing active treatment.

5|$|While in government, Disraeli {{presided over}} a series of social reforms which {{supported}} his one-nation politics and aimed to create a benevolent hierarchy. He appointed a Royal Commission to assess the state of law between <b>employers</b> <b>and</b> <b>employees,</b> the result of which prompted Richard Cross to pass the Employers and Workmen Act of 1875. This act made both sides of industry equal before {{the law and the}} breach of contract a civil offence, rather than criminal. Cross also passed the Conspiracy, and Protection of Property Act in the same year which enshrined the right to strike of workers by ensuring that acts carried out by a workers' group could not be indicted as conspiracy.|$|E
5|$|Strikes and {{industrial}} unrest were frequent {{in the aftermath}} of World War I, arising from discontent over poor conditions and the rise of militant labour organizations like the Communist Party of Australia and the Industrial Workers of the World. The problems were made worse in Australia due to the overlapping system of industrial courts that had evolved since Federation. Although federal arbitration was intended for industrial disputes that impacted upon multiple states or federal employees, courts had through several judgments greatly expanded the potential jurisdiction of federal arbitration, and the system had developed into a duality with both state and federal tribunals weighing into a wide range of industrial disputes. This was exploited by both unions and employers, who pursued matters in the courts they felt most likely to be favourable and switched between different jurisdictions to arrive at the best combination of state and federal conditions. Protracted disputes arose as <b>employers</b> <b>and</b> <b>employees</b> pursued disputes in different courts or refused to recognise the rulings of one in favour of the other. Billy Hughes and several of his predecessors had sought resolution to the problem through greater Commonwealth powers, but all referendums to expand Commonwealth industrial powers had failed at the ballot box.|$|E

40|$|An {{organisational}} {{internet use}} policy (IUP) is a recognised deterrent to manage insider internet misuse. However, IUPs have proven ineffective against this threat, {{perhaps because of}} their neglect of the ethical issues involved. An important part of setting an IUP involves the resolution of key ethical dilemmas when <b>employer</b> <b>and</b> <b>employee</b> perspectives conflict. This paper explores the ethical issues {{that must be addressed}} when developing an organisational IUP. It draws on a conceptual analysis and an interpretive study of five medium-size and large organisations in Australia and North America. The paper provides a set of key ethical issues for an IUP and compares <b>and</b> contrasts the <b>employer</b> <b>and</b> <b>employee</b> perspectives. It highlights the need to balance the <b>employer</b> <b>and</b> <b>employee</b> perspectives when setting an IUP. Other implications for theory and practice are discussed. <br /...|$|R
