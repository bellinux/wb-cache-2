But not Irving Crane." [...] Rudolph Wanderone, a/k/a Minnesota Fats, once opined, [...] "Irv Crane would have been the only guy to notice the horse under Lady Godiva," [...] while professional rival Willie Mosconi who had criticized Crane for his cautious style, stated in his 1993 autobiography, Willie's Game, that [...] "Crane wouldn't take a shot unless his grandmother could make it." ...|$|E
500|$|In December 2006, George W. Bush showed dissatisfaction when he {{was asked}} if he was in denial about the {{situation}} in Iraq (the most Bush had said about the situation was that the increase in attacks was [...] "unsettling"). Bush replied [...] "It's bad in Iraq. Does that help?". He had another run-in with Bush at a press conference at Camp David, when Bush asked him [...] "you still hanging around?". He then suggested to Robinson, with reference to the fact that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>hot</b> day, that [...] "next time you should cover your bald head". As Bush walked away, Robinson replied [...] "I didn't know you cared", to which Bush responded [...] "I don't". Robinson described his quip as a [...] "fatal error" [...] on his blog. In a final encounter in 2008, Bush joked with Robinson about still not wearing his hat.|$|E
500|$|On {{the morning}} of Friday, September 6, 1901, McKinley dressed {{formally}} as usual, then departed the Milburn House for a stroll through the neighborhood. [...] The President nearly slipped away unguarded; when the police and soldiers noticed him leaving, they hurried after him. Czolgosz also rose early {{with the intent of}} lining up for the public reception at the Temple of Music; he reached the Exposition gates at 8:30a.m., {{in time to see the}} President pass in his carriage en route to the train station for the visit to Niagara Falls. [...] The McKinleys traveled by train to Lewiston, where they switched to trolleys to view the Niagara Gorge. [...] When the party reached the municipality of Niagara Falls, they transferred to carriages to see the sights. [...] The party rode halfway across the Honeymoon Bridge overlooking the Falls, though McKinley was careful not to enter Canada for reasons of protocol. [...] <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>hot</b> day, and Ida McKinley felt ill due to the heat; she was driven to the International Hotel to await her husband, who toured Goat Island before joining his wife for lunch. [...] After smoking a cigar on the veranda, the President rode with his wife to the train which now awaited them nearby, and saw her settled there before touring the hydroelectric plant at the Falls. [...] The train then returned to Buffalo so McKinley could attend the reception at the Temple of Music. [...] Ida McKinley had originally intended to accompany her husband to the auditorium, but as she was not fully recovered, she decided to return to the Milburn House to rest. [...] As the time allotted for the reception had been pared down to ten minutes, the President did not expect to be separated from his wife for long. [...] As it was only 3:30p.m., McKinley stopped for refreshments at the Mission Building before proceeding to the Temple of Music.|$|E

2500|$|The {{linotype}} machine ( [...] ) is a [...] "line casting" [...] machine used in printing {{sold by the}} Mergenthaler Linotype Company and related companies. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>hot</b> metal typesetting system that cast blocks of metal type for individual uses. Linotype {{became one of the}} mainstay methods to set type, especially small-size body text, for newspapers, magazines and posters from the late 19thcentury to the 1970s and 1980s, when it was largely replaced by phototypesetting, offset lithography printing and computer typesetting. The name of the machine {{comes from the fact that}} it produces an entire line of metal type at once, hence a line-o'-type, a significant improvement over the previous industry standard, i.e.,manual, letter-by-letter typesetting using a composing stick and drawers of letters.|$|E
2500|$|Even {{though the}} Cessna 206H is {{certified}} as a six-seat aircraft in its country of origin, the Canadian aviation regulator, Transport Canada has certified it to carry only five people in Canada. [...] This {{is due to}} concerns about passenger egress through the rear clamshell door with the flaps extended. [...] Cessna addressed one part of this problem early on, after a flight-test aircraft was damaged when the pilot extended the flaps while taxiing, and his passenger had the clamshell door open (for ventilation; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>hot</b> summer day). [...] A switch {{was added to the}} flap actuation circuit which disabled the flaps when the doors were open. [...] The other {{part of the problem is}} that if the flaps are already down, the passenger must perform the complicated procedure of opening the front part as far as possible (about [...] ) then open the rear door and restow the rear door handle. This then gives enough clearance to open the rear part of the door.|$|E
2500|$|Holt again rose {{early on}} Sunday, 17 December, and after breakfast telephoned his wife. He {{drove to the}} local general store mid-morning, where he bought insect repellant, peanuts, and the weekend newspapers. One of the {{headlines}} in The Australian was [...] "PM advised to swim less", which detailed the latest advice from Holt's doctor; however, it is unclear if Holt bought or read that particular paper. On returning home, Holt made plans {{for the rest of}} the day, which included a visit to Point Nepean, a barbecue lunch, and an afternoon spearfishing trip. At 11:15 a.m., he and four others set out for Point Nepean, where they hoped to watch solo circumnavigator Alec Rose pass through The Rip into Port Phillip Bay. He was accompanied by Marjorie Gillespie, her daughter Vyner, and two family friends of the Gillespies, Martin Simpson and Alan Stewart. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>hot</b> day and Rose's yacht was barely visible, so the group only stayed a short while before leaving.|$|E
