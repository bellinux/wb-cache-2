5|$|A simple case {{of dynamic}} {{equilibrium}} occurs in constant velocity motion across a surface with kinetic friction. In such a situation, a <b>force</b> is {{applied in the}} direction of motion while the kinetic friction <b>force</b> exactly opposes the applied <b>force.</b> This results in zero net <b>force,</b> but since the object started with a non-zero velocity, it continues to move with a non-zero velocity. Aristotle misinterpreted this motion as being caused by the applied <b>force.</b> However, when kinetic friction is taken into consideration it is clear that there is no net <b>force</b> causing constant velocity motion.|$|E

40|$|The {{modal logic}} of <b>forcing</b> arises when one {{considers}} a model of set theory {{in the context of}} all its <b>forcing</b> extensions, interpreting necessity as "in all <b>forcing</b> extensions" and possibility as "in some <b>forcing</b> extension". In this modal language one may easily express sweeping general <b>forcing</b> principles, such as the assertion that every possibly necessary statement is necessarily possible, which is valid for <b>forcing,</b> or the assertion that every possibly necessary statement is true, which is the maximality principle, a <b>forcing</b> axiom independent of but equiconsistent with ZFC (Stavi-Väänänen, Hamkins). Every definable <b>forcing</b> class similarly gives rise to the corresponding <b>forcing</b> modalities, for which one considers extensions only by <b>forcing</b> notions in that class. In previous work, we proved that if ZFC is consistent, then the ZFC-provably valid principles of the class of all <b>forcing</b> are precisely the assertions of the modal theory S 4. 2. In this article, we prove that the provably valid principles of collapse <b>forcing,</b> Cohen <b>forcing</b> and other classes are in each case exactly S 4. 3; the provably valid principles of c. c. c. <b>forcing,</b> proper <b>forcing,</b> and others are each contained within S 4. 3 and do not contain S 4. 2; the provably valid principles of countably closed <b>forcing,</b> CH-preserving <b>forcing</b> and others are each exactly S 4. 2; and the provably valid principles of ω_ 1 -preserving <b>forcing</b> are contained within S 4. tBA. All these results arise from general structural connections we have identified between a <b>forcing</b> class and the modal logic of <b>forcing</b> to which it gives rise, including the connection between various control statements, such as buttons, switches and ratchets, and their corresponding <b>forcing</b> validities. These structural connections therefore support a forcing-only analysis of other diverse <b>forcing</b> classes. Comment: 22 pages. Questions and commentary on this article can be made at [URL]...|$|R

5|$|The {{electrons}} of an atom {{are attracted}} to the protons in an atomic nucleus by this electromagnetic <b>force.</b> The protons and neutrons in the nucleus {{are attracted to}} each other by a different <b>force,</b> the nuclear <b>force,</b> which is usually stronger than the electromagnetic <b>force</b> repelling the positively charged protons from one another.

5|$|The normal <b>force</b> {{is due to}} {{repulsive forces}} of {{interaction}} between atoms at close contact.
