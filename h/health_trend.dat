This article uses a quasi-experimental approach to examine the impact of the recent financial crisis on health in Greece. Methods: Data came from the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions survey for the years 2006 – 09. We applied a difference-in-differences approach that compares <b>health</b> <b>trends</b> before and after the financial crisis in Greece with trends in a control population (Poland) that did not experience a recession and had <b>health</b> <b>trends</b> comparable with Greece before the crisis. We used logistic regression to model the impact of the financial crisis on poor self-rated health, controlling for demographic confounders. Results: Results provide strong evidence of a statistically significant negative effect of the financial crisis on <b>health</b> <b>trends.</b> Relative to the control population, Greece experienced a significantly larger increase in the odds of reporting poor health after the crisis (odds ratio, 1. 16; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 04 – 1. 29). There was no difference in <b>health</b> <b>trends</b> between Poland and Greece before the financial crisis, supporting a causal interpretation of health declines in Greece {{as a result of the}} financial crisis.

Furthermore, they were asked to draw possible future scenarios on fruit consumption. As expected, the most important past trend factor that emerged in all countries was the importance of people¿s health in relation to fruit consumption. Besides the <b>health</b> <b>trend,</b> which is expected to become even more important, convenience is also indicated as an important determinant of fruit consumption in the future. In addition, future scenarios drawn by the experts were concerned with health aspects, convenience and a decreasing impact of economic factors.

40|$|Accumulating {{epidemiological}} {{evidence indicates}} a strong clinical association between obesity {{and an increased}} risk of cancer. The global pandemic of obesity indicates a public <b>health</b> <b>trend</b> towards a substantial increase in cancer incidence and mortality. However, the mechanisms that link obesity to cancer remain incompletely understood. The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster has been increasingly used to model an expanding spectrum of human diseases. Fly models provide a genetically simpler system that is ideal for use as a first step towards dissecting disease interactions. Recently, the combining of fly models of diet-induced obesity with models of cancer has provided a novel model system in which to study the biological mechanisms that underlie the connections between obesity and cancer. In this Review, I summarize recent advances, made using Drosophila, in our understanding of the interplay between diet, obesity, insulin resistance and cancer. I also discuss how the biological mechanisms and therapeutic targets that have been identified in fly studies could be utilized to develop preventative interventions and treatment strategies for obesityassociated cancers...|$|E
40|$|<b>Health</b> <b>trend</b> {{prediction}} {{is critical to}} ensure the safe operation of highly reliable systems. However, complex systems often present complex dynamic behaviors and uncertainty, which {{makes it difficult to}} develop a precise physical prediction model. Therefore, time series is often used for prediction in this case. In this paper, in order to obtain better prediction accuracy in shorter computation time, we propose a new scheme which utilizes multiple relevant time series to enhance the completeness of the information and adopts a prediction model based on least squares support vector regression (LS-SVR) to perform prediction. In the scheme, we apply two innovative ways to overcome the drawbacks of the reported approaches. One is to remove certain support vectors by measuring the linear correlation to increase sparseness of LS-SVR; the other one is to determine the linear combination weights of multiple kernels by calculating the root mean squared error of each basis kernel. The results of prediction experiments indicate preliminarily that the proposed method is an effective approach for its good prediction accuracy and low computation time, and it is a valuable method in applications...|$|E

Conclusion: Support was found for the control factors, specifically a consideration of barriers and self-efficacy, in the context of understanding dental patients’ oral hygiene decisions. Practice implications: Dental professionals should encourage patients’ self-confidence to brush and floss at recommended levels and discuss strategies that combat barriers to performance, rather than emphasising the risks of inaction or the benefits of oral self-care. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the potential of}} community health worker (CHW) programmes, as proposed by the 2008 World Health Organisation (WHO) document Task Shifting to tackle health worker shortages, to contribute to HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment and various Millennium Development Goals in low-income countries. It {{examines the}} WHO proposal through a literature review of factors that have facilitated the success of previous CHW experiences. The WHO has taken account of five key lessons learnt from past CHW programmes (the need for strong management, appropriate selection, suitable training, adequate retention structures and good relationships with other healthcare workers). It has, however, neglected to emphasise {{the importance of a}} sixth lesson, the 'community embeddedness' of CHWs, found to be of critical importance to the success of past CHW programmes. We have no doubt that the WHO plans will increase the number of workers able to perform medically oriented tasks. However, we argue that without community embeddedness, CHWs will be unable to successfully perform the socially oriented tasks assigned to them by the WHO, such as health education and counselling.

As a reaction to this a major <b>health</b> <b>trend</b> has emerged in recent decades. Every day consumers are exposed to information from the media about what is healthy or unhealthy to eat and the recommendations change frequently. There is great interest in healthy food on the Swedish food market, but still healthy foods only represents a small proportion of the total food sales. The essay examines the gap between the current and potential demand for healthy food and if it can be explained by any of the following factors: lack of information, price, taste or cognitive behavioral. To study these questions a quantitative method have been used and 213 questionnaires were collected. The intention is to draw general conclusions about the entire population. We discussed and analyzed the quantitative data together with the frame of reference based on the four factors and the discussion led us to the following conclusions: Price and parts of the cognitive behavior inhibits the consumption of healthy foods on the Swedish food market. The other factors studied can not explain the inhibited consumption. Based on the conclusions we recommend “svenska Livsmedelsverket” to communicate its policies through traditional marketing channels to better reach out to all consumers. We also believe the Swedish food market is ready for a new store concept with only healthy food...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze the trends in labor force {{participation}} and transitions to benefit programs of older workers {{in relation to}} <b>health</b> <b>trends</b> as well as recent Social Security reforms. Our preliminary conclusions are pessimistic regarding the effect of health improvements on the labor market attachment of older workers since we show that despite the large improvements in the mortality rates among older individuals in Spain, the employment rates of individuals older than fifty-five remain lower than the ones observed in the late 1970 s. Some caution should remain in our conclusions as the evidence on <b>health</b> <b>trends</b> is inconclusive. Regarding the effect of Social Security reforms, we find that both the 1997 and the 2002 reform decreased the stock into old-age benefits {{at the cost of}} an increased share of the participation into disability.

If spinach is included in the mix then the juice may contain significant quantities of oxalates and these are not safe to consume regularly in large amounts as they predispose some people to kidney stone formation. MethodsGreen juice, prepared from spinach and other common vegetables using a high speed blender that produced a juice containing all the original fiber of the processed raw vegetables, was compared with a juice produced using a masticating juicer, where the pulp containing most of the fiber was discarded in the process. The oxalate contents of both juices were measured using HPLC chromatography. ResultsTwo juices were prepared using each processing method, one juice contained a high level of spinach, which resulted in a juice containing high levels of total, soluble and insoluble oxalates; the other was a juice mixture made from the same combination of vegetables but containing half the level of spinach, which resulted in a juice containing considerably (P< 0. 001) lower levels of oxalates. Removal of the pulp fraction from the green vegetable juice had resulted in significantly (P< 0. 01) higher levels of oxalates in the remaining juices made from both levels of spinach. ConclusionGreen juices prepared using common vegetables can contain high levels of soluble oxalates, which will vary with the type and proportion of vegetables used and whether or not the pulp fraction was retained during processing...|$|E

The company realised in 1996 {{that the}} standard at which occupational health was conducted neither addressed {{the needs of the}} business environment within which it had to function, nor fulfilled the legal requirements that it had to. The need for an applicable Occupational Health System was born. After an unsuccessful search for a commercially available system, the decision was taken to develop one.

40|$|Background: Despite {{the declining}} trend of {{workplace}} accidents in Republic of Korea, its level is still quite high {{compared with that}} in other developed countries. Factors {{that are responsible for}} high workplace accidents have not been well documented in Republic of Korea. The main {{purpose of this paper is}} to estimate the effects of unions and health and safety committees on workplace accidents in Korean manufacturing firms. We also allow for the interactions between unions and health and safety committees in the analysis. The results obtained in this paper will not only contribute to the literature in this field, but might also be useful for employers and worker representatives who are trying to find an effective way to reduce workplace accidents. Methods: This paper utilizes the 2012 Occupational Safety and <b>Health</b> <b>Trend</b> Survey data, which is a unique data set providing information on workplace injuries and illness as well as other characteristics of participatory firms, representative of the manufacturing industry in Republic of Korea. Results: In estimating the effects of unions and health and safety committees, we build a negative binomial regression model in which the interactions between unions and health and safety committees are permissible in reducing workplace accidents. Conclusion: Health and safety committees were found to reduce the incidence of accidents whereas unionized establishments have higher incidence of accidents than nonunionized establishments. We also found that health and safety committees can more effectively reduce accidents in nonunionized establishments. By contrast, nonexclusive joint committees can more effectively reduce accidents in unionized establishments...|$|E

The health effects of marital status were evaluated in regressions which assessed the relationships between initial marital status and subsequent <b>health</b> <b>trends</b> in each follow-up interval. In the first follow-up interval, never married women tended to have worse <b>health</b> <b>trends</b> than divorced and separated women for physical impairments and for overall health problems. However, there were no differences between never married women and divorced and separated women in <b>health</b> <b>trends</b> for psychosomatic symptoms in either follow-up interval or for any health measure in the second follow-up interval. Our analyses of cross-sectional data showed few significant differences in health between never married women and divorced and separated women. Taken together, the evidence from our study and previous studies suggests that differences between never married women and divorced and separated women may vary by age and/or cohort. Evidence for the 1970 s and 1980 s suggests that, among older women, divorced and separated women may have experienced more harmful health effects than never married women; however, among younger women, this difference may have been absent or possibly reversed. marital status divorce women...|$|R
