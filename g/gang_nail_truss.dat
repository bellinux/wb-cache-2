40|$|Recent roof {{failures}} in South Africa, of multiple ply <b>nail</b> plated <b>trusses,</b> have necessitated a rethink {{about the way}} in which timber trusses are analysed. The authors believe that the relative slip between plies caused by a torsional moment as a result of eccentric loading is a possible reason for some of the failures. The design assumption in South Africa and America is that all the plies share the applied load equally; Eurocode 5 (BS EN 1995 - 1 - 1 : 2004) does not cover the design of multiple ply trusses; and BS 5268 - 3 : 2006 recommends additional load factors to be applied to eccentrically loaded truss components with the outer ply being loaded more than the inner plies, {{as a result of the}} torsion induced by an out-of-plane eccentricity. In this paper, a matrix stiffness method is used to show that, by ignoring the eccentric loading and relative slip between the trusses, the member and plate force may be underestimated by a factor in excess of two for a three ply girder truss. A single three-ply girder truss test is used to illustrate the merits of the method. The required load factors calculated also show that the magnification factors in BS 5268 - 3 : 2006 are lower than they should be. [URL]...|$|R

40|$|Scarcity of wood is {{hindering}} {{the use of}} wood {{materials that}} have large dimension and high quality. Thus, wooden truss {{is expected to be}} a solution for this problem. However, the use of this system is not complemented with adequate research of its strength and behavior. In this study, wooden truss would be examined experimentally. The specimen is a wooden truss joist supporting the floor slab for typical residences with two connection type variations which are nail and glue. These specimens has dimension of 185 cm in length and 36 cm in height with 3 layers of a wooden board in width, and were produced by using Sengon wood with elasticity modulus of 2867 MPa, and specific gravity of 0. 4. Destructive and non-destructive test were performed. From the result, we obtained a higher proportional strength for glue type connection truss which at 1123. 34 kg compared to <b>nail</b> type connection <b>truss</b> which at 767. 07 kg. However, unlike the nail type connection, the glue type connection has a brittle behavior. Moreover, the stiffness connection study resulted with partial fixity value of 0. 07 for nail type and 0. 98 for glue type connection. Furthermore, these results have also been validated using numerical model analysi...|$|R
40|$|The {{structural}} response {{and performance of}} connections are particularly important to assess the vulnerability of timber-framed structures to windstorms. Finite element (FE) analysis using ABAQUS (6. 12 - 3) software is {{used in this study}} to determine the {{structural response}} and uplift capacities of typical roof to wall connections. Results (i. e. force-displacement relationship and failure modes) of the FE model were compared with experimental tests and the model validated from the test results. The FE model accounts for large deformation as well as the contact between nail and timber through the elastic and post-elastic phases up to failure. The dominant failure modes observed are nails and framing anchor bending, and nail pull out. The FE model produced structural responses and uplift capacities that generally agree with the experimental results. Construction defects (i. e. missing nails) in a roof to wall connection influences the design uplift capacity. Nails located near the centre line of the loading action in a triple grip connection (i. e. common roof to wall connection used in the timber-framed house of Australia) significantly affect the stiffness of this connection. The response of these nails dominated the uplift capacity and failure types of triple grip connection to loading. Missing a <b>nail</b> in both <b>truss</b> and top-plate in the triple grip connection reduces the design uplift capacity by 40...|$|R

Among other severities, Ali Pasha, an Albanian-born Ottoman noble who ruled Ioannina, had rebels, criminals, and even the {{descendants}} {{of those who had}} wronged him or his family in the past, impaled and roasted alive. For example, Thomas Smart Hughes, visiting Greece and Albania in 1812-13, says the following about his stay in Ioannina: [...] "Here criminals have been roasted alive over a slow fire, impaled, and skinned alive; others have had their extremities chopped off, and some have been left to perish with the skin of the face stripped over their necks. At first I doubted the truth of these assertions, but they were abundantly confirmed to me by persons of undoubted veracity. Some of the most respectable inhabitants of loannina assured me that they had sometimes conversed with these wretched victims on the very stake, being prevented from yielding to their torturing requests for water by fear of a similar fate themselves. Our own resident, as he was once going into the serai of Litaritza, saw a Greek priest, the leader of a <b>gang</b> of robbers, <b>nailed</b> alive to the outer wall of the palace, in sight of the whole city." ...|$|R
40|$|The roof-to-wall {{connection}} {{in a house}} is designed to transfer the uplift and lateral loads during strong winds by providing a continuous load path from the roof to the foundation. The uplift capacity and failure mode of the connection depends on the number and type of fasteners (nails), timber species, type of framing anchor, and constructions defects. This paper presents experimental results {{that were used to}} assess the uplift capacity variation of typical roof-to-wall connections. Based on tests with two types of connections (triple grip and truss grip) assembled with two types of timber (radiata pine and spruce pine), nails (hand and gun), and framing anchors (triple grip and universal triple grip), the results show that the variation in timber species, nail, and triple grip type changes the strength and the failure modes of the connection. The strength of the connection was reduced by about 24 % when the timber species was changed from radiata pine to spruce pine and the hand nail to gun nail on the triple grip connection. This study also showed that construction defects in roof-to-wall connections influence the design uplift capacity. If there are two missing nails in the hand-nailed triple grip connection (i. e., one <b>nail</b> on the <b>truss</b> and another one on the top plate) the design uplift capacity reduces by about 40 % of the ideal hand-nailed triple grip connection. This study identified the critical nails and their locations required to mitigate failure of the roof-to-wall triple grip connection subject to wind loading...|$|R
40|$|The {{most common}} method of roof framing {{employed}} by Australian builders in modern construction {{is the use}} of pre-fabricated nail plated timber roof trusses. These trusses are predominantly manufactured from structural framing timber limited in length to a maximum of 6 metres. The style and size of houses increasingly preferred by Australian homeowners means that trusses are regularly required to span further than 6 metres. Truss manufacturers therefore use larger or additional nail plates to splice members during fabrication, and the assembly process becomes far more complex. Finger jointing of sawmill off-cuts and other short lengths of timber is a means of manufacturers economically producing timber in longer lengths. This dissertation investigates the suitability of using finger jointed structural timber for the fabrication of <b>nail</b> plated roof <b>trusses.</b> Physical testing and statistical analysis has been used to compare the performance of finger jointed structural timber with standard structural framing timber normally used in truss fabrication. This study involved characterizing the mechanical properties of the timber, as well as assessing the performance of joints including mechanical fasteners. These methods, along with the static modelling of loading situations, were also used to quantify the probability of inducing failures unique to finger jointed timber, during the truss fabrication and erection process. These investigations concluded that finger jointed timber could be produced with equivalent mechanical properties to standard framing timber. Joints manufactured from finger jointed and solid structural timber also exhibited no significant difference in performance. Furthermore, failures unique to finger jointed timber could occur during fabrication and erection, however, the probability of these, under normal use conditions, is generally quite low. ...|$|R
