5|$|That {{first night}} of my {{imprisonment}} was the longest night I have ever passed <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life; {{it seemed as though}} the dawn of day would never come. I found <b>in</b> <b>my</b> bag a small Book of Common Prayer according to the ritual of the Episcopal Church. It was a great comfort to me, and before retiring to rest Mrs. Clark and I spent a few minutes in the devotions appropriate to the evening. Here, perhaps, I may say, that although I had been a regular attendant on the Presbyterian worship since my childhood, a constant contributor to all the missionary societies, and had helped to build their churches and ornament the walls, giving my time and my musical ability freely to make their meetings attractive to my people, yet none of these pious church members or clergymen remembered me <b>in</b> <b>my</b> prison. To this (Christian ?) conduct I contrast that of the Anglican bishop, Rt. Rev. Alfred Willis, who visited me from time to time <b>in</b> <b>my</b> house, and in whose church I have since been confirmed as a communicant. But he was not allowed to see me at the palace.|$|E
