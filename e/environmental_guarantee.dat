40|$|The Canary Islands Oceanic Platform (PLOCAN) is {{a public}} {{infrastructure}} for research, development and innovation {{in the fields of}} ocean science and technology at increasing depths. Located East of Gran Canaria Island (Canary Islands, Spain), PLOCAN will provide rapid access to great depths at short distance from the shore, accelerating research and the generation of water column and deep-ocean knowledge. Specifically, PLOCAN will host a permanent deep-sea observatory, be a test-bed for innovative technologies, form specialists and provide training in the field and be a national base of manned and unmanned submersibles. PLOCAN’s vision is focused on generation and exchange of science and innovations between the academic and the socio-economic spheres. PLOCAN will be a fully instrumented gate to the deep ocean, an efficient and cost-effective solution to test products and processes, and cluster private and public partnerships to face undersea challenges. Two years ahead of the planned official opening and start of operations, the academic world, entrepreneurs and corporations have already started to submit proposals {{to be included in the}} science and technology agenda. Activities will be essentially multidisciplinary, ranging from renewable energies, aquaculture, ocean observing fixed systems and submersibles, to biosciences and emerging technologies such as new materials and nanotechnologies.

This study documents and analyses the implementation of {{environmental impact}} assessment in the Philippines, comparing it with other Southeast Asian countries' EIA procedures with emphasis on the role of donor agencies. It concludes that the Philippine EIS system, in spite of some shortcomings, performed satisfactorily though implementation and enforcement ha/ {{a lot of room for}} improvement. [...] The Philippines has one of the most comprehensive EIA laws and policies in Southeast Asia. The Philippine Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) System has undergone four phases of implementation as evidence that there is a continuous effort in improving its application. Originally conceived as a regulatory tool, the EIS system has slowly moved to being a management tool to aid decision makers in selecting the best alternative after examining the trade offs between social needs, environmental concerns and economic and financial viability of a project or activity. Recent reforms in the EIA implementing rules and regulations are expected to further enhance the administration and overall utility of EIA in the Philippines. [...] The Philippine EIS System is well advanced in comparison with Southeast Asia and some Western EIA systems. It has strong legal and regulatory frameworks and guidelines and procedures for its implementation are well set up. Through time, there have been amendments such as the social acceptability concept to enhance public participation, specific guidelines for scoping and the requirement of <b>Environmental</b> <b>Guarantee</b> and Monitoring Funds for compliance monitoring, which aimed at improving EIA implementation. However, compliance and enforcement are still insufficient due to the inherent problem of lack of financial and human resources and political support. [...] Donor agencies have been influential in the formulation and improvement in EIA implementation in the Philippines. The initial environmental policy in the Philippines that was formulated with the assistance from the US government became the foundation of the preceding environmental laws and policies. The Philippines has obtained a fair amount of EIA technical assistance from bilateral and multilateral donors to support institutional capacity building and to train EIA implementors, project proponents and non-government organisations and to build and upgrade environmental management facilities and equipment. Donors have little influence in the actual conduct of EIA in the Philippines. The Philippine EIS system has the same requirements and procedures from local and foreign-funded projects and all project proponents are required to comply.

Different approaches such as core solution, Shapley value, kernel, and nucleolus were shown to provide a strong foundation in finding possible and stable resource/cost sharing arrangements. The results confirm the apparent analogy between the definition of Nash equilibrium in non-cooperative and coalitional game theory: both strong and coalition-proof Nash equilibria reflect on unprofitability of coalition deviations rather than an individual player deviation. In a network wherein informational exchange is possible, either through a central controller or among players themselves, the concept of coordinated equilibrium arises. The results of intuitive examples show a significant improvement in coordinated equilibrium when compared with non-cooperative schemes. When the number of agents or strategies is large, the ability to jointly reach a consensus through <b>environmental</b> learning <b>guarantees</b> convergence to the best joint action.|$|R

Given this gap and the increasing global demand for cocoa derivatives, this study aims to evaluate the environmental impacts of an Italian dark chocolate through a holistic cradle-to-grave Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). The impact categories assessed are acidification potential (AC), eutrophication potential (EU), global warming potential (GW), photochemical ozone creation potential (POC), ozone layer depletion potential (OD), abiotic depletion (AD) and cumulative energy demand (CED). The obtained results highlight the relevant contributions of upstream phase (63 % for the ODP, 92 % for EU and 99 % for the AD) and core processes (39 % for the GW and 49 % for the CED) on the overall impacts.
