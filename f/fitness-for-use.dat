[...] Recommendations include using a FFU test sample {{at the beginning and end}} of a series involving the examination of multiple questioned documents, or placing a small FFU test sample adjacent to each questioned document on the platen. [...] The FFU test can be prepared by hand using a similar writing instrument and similar paper. [...] Alternatively, a special device call the 'Gradient®' can be used to produce control indentations that vary in depth in a known manner thereby permitting the examiner to determine not only that the EDD is working but also the degree to which it is sensitive. It is not essential to precisely match the questioned document in terms of paper type or pen type since the objective is to show that the device is functioning properly.|$|E

40|$|With the {{establishment}} of the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) in 2001 as an inter-governmental co-ordinating body, concerted efforts were made during the past decade to establish a global research infrastructure to facilitate the sharing, discovery and access to primary biodiversity data. As on date the participants in GBIF have enabled the discovery and access to over 267 + million such data records. While this remarkable achievement in terms of volume of data must be acknowledged, concerns about the quality and ‘fitness-for-use’ of the data should also be carefully considered in future developments. This contribution is therefore a direct response to the calls for comprehensive content assessment of the GBIF mobilised data. It is the first comprehensive assessment of the coverage of the content mobilised so far through GBIF, as well as a mean to identify the existing gaps and reflect on <b>fitness-for-use</b> requirements.

Outcomes of these research initiatives are summarised in four categories, namely, (a) data quality assessment, (b) trends/patterns assessment, (c) <b>fitness-for-use</b> assessment, and (d) ecosystem specific data diversity assessment.

By applying a dual-process approach to data quality assessment, the model enables simultaneous evaluation of both objective and contextual data quality attributes. In addition to assessing the role of metadata for enhancing believability, we use our framework to investigate the data attributes of relevance, completeness, accuracy and timeliness.

In addition, discolouration was found to be less important to <b>fitness-for-use</b> than tears and missing pieces.

Emanating from discussions on the fundamental problems of the analysis of environmental samples for chemical or biological contaminants, a general guidance is given regarding the minimum information that should be provided to adequately describe the sampling strategy, method of sampling, sample properties, handling between sampling and analysis (including storage conditions, pretreatments, homogenization, subsampling), and the analytical methodology (including calculation and validation procedures).

40|$|Background In {{heritage}} science {{literature and}} in preventive conservation practice, damage functions {{are used to}} model material behaviour and specifically damage (unacceptable change), {{as a result of}} the presence of a stressor over time. For such functions to be of use in the context of collection management, it is important to define a range of parameters, such as who the stakeholders are (e. g. the public, curators, researchers), the mode of use (e. g. display, storage, manual handling), the long-term planning horizon (i. e. when in the future it is deemed acceptable for an item to become damaged or unfit for use), and what the threshold of damage is, i. e. extent of physical change assessed as damage. Results In this paper, we explore the threshold of fitness for use for archival and library paper documents used for display or reading in the context of access in reading rooms by the general public. Change is considered in the context of discolouration and mechanical deterioration such as tears and missing pieces: forms of physical deterioration that accumulate with time in libraries and archives. We also explore whether the threshold fitness for use is defined differently for objects perceived to be of different value, and for different modes of use.

40|$|Spatial {{data quality}} has been {{attracting}} much interest. Much {{of the problem}} lies in {{the degree to which}} current data structures are unable to model the real world and the way imperfections in the data may propagate during analyses and cast doubt on the validity of the outcomes. Much of the research has concentrated on the quantitative accuracy of spatial data, the derivation of indices and their propagation through analyses. Geographical data invariably includes an element of interpretation for which linguistic hedges of uncertainty may be generated. The paper presents a new technique of handling such expressions in a GIS through fuzzy expectation - intuitive probabilities linked to stylized fuzzy sets. By using fuzzy expectation as linguistic building blocks, many of the difficulties in using fuzzy set descriptors in GIS have been overcome. The stylized fuzzy sets can be propagated using Boolean operators to give a resultant fuzzy set which can be ‘translated’ back into a linguistic quality statement. For the first time, linguistic criteria of <b>fitness-for-use</b> can be derived for GIS outputs regardless of the language being used...|$|E
40|$|The {{success of}} a wide range of {{commercial}} products and industrial processes depends on meeting specific flow requirements. Industrial applied rheology attempts to relate fundamental properties to <b>fitness-for-use</b> of fluids of commerce. Architectural and industrial coatings, molded plastics, adhesives, personal care products and cosmetics, inks, cement, drilling muds, ceramic slips, solder pastes, foodstuffs and medicines are examples of rheologically complex fluids whose commercial viability depends on having the “right ” rheology. For such materials, the necessary rheological properties must be defined with due regard to the prevailing conditions of stress and strain rate in processing and application. Unfortunately, the predominant practice in industry with respect to rheological characterization is to rely on rugged but simple viscometers or “viscometry devices”. These typically measure within a limited range of stress or strain rate, generally returning arbitrary numbers of uncertain value. On the other hand, it is often very difficult to link fundamental rheological properties with “real-world ” performance. The challenge to the applied rheologist is to design experiments having relevance to the process at hand and then usefully apply the result- in other words, to bridge rheology and technology. This article discusses the use of, in particular, controlled-stress rheometry to characterize complex fluids, with the main thrust toward the coatings industry...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{effectively}} understand {{and cope with}} the current 'biodiversity crisis', having large-enough sets of qualified data is necessary. Information facilitators such as the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) are ensuring increasing availability of primary biodiversity records by linking data collections spread over several institutions that have agreed to publish their data in a common access schema. We have assessed the primary records that one such publisher, the Spanish node of GBIF (GBIF.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the most recent}} developments in an exploratory research project that investigates the potential utility of volunteered geographic information (VGI) for fighting forest fires. As social media platforms change the way people communicate and share information in crisis situations, {{we focus on the}} value and options to integrate VGI with existing spatial data infrastructures (SDI) and crisis response procedures. Two major obstacles to using VGI in crisis situations are (1) a lack of quality control and (2) an increasing amount of information. Consequently, the overall quality and <b>fitness-for-use</b> of VGI needs assessment first. One year ago, we proposed a workflow for automatically processing and assessing the quality and the accuracy of VGI in the context of forest fires. This contribution {{presents the}} advancements since then, focusing on the approach to define and implement a measure of the overall quality/fitness-for-use of the content analyzed. A proposed integrated quality score (IQS) consists of two main criteria, i. e. relevance and credibility. For both criteria, we have identified several contributing components. The geographic context of a message has crucial significance, since we argue that it allows assessing both relevance and credibility.

40|$|Background Primary {{biodiversity}} records (PBR) {{are essential}} {{in many areas}} of scientific research as they document the biodiversity through time and space. However, concerns about PBR quality and <b>fitness-for-use</b> have grown, especially as derived from taxonomical, geographical and sampling effort biases. Nonetheless, the temporal bias stemming from data ageing has received less attention. We examine the effect of changes in land use in the information currentness, and therefore data obsolescence, in biodiversity databases. Methods We created maps of land use changes for three periods (1956 – 1985, 1985 – 2000 and 2000 – 2012) at 5 -kilometres resolution. For each cell we calculated the percentage of land use change within each period. We then overlaid distribution data about small mammals, and classified each data as ‘non-obsolete or ‘obsolete,’ depending on both the amount of land use changes in the cell, and whether changes occurred at or after the data sampling’s date. Results A total of 14, 528 records out of the initial 59, 677 turned out to be non-obsolete after taking into account the changes in the land uses in Navarra. These obsolete data existed in 115 of the 156 cells analysed. Furthermore, more than one half of the remaining cells holding non-obsolete records had not been visited at least for the last fifteen years. Conclusion Land use changes challenge the actual information obtainable from biodiversity datasets and therefore its potential uses. With the passage of time, one can expect a steady increase in the availability and use of biological records—but not without them becoming older and likely to be obsolete by land uses changes. Therefore, it becomes necessary to assess records’ obsolescence, as it may jeopardize the knowledge and perception of biodiversity patterns...|$|E
40|$|Background: In {{the context}} of {{evidence-based}} management of historic collections, a damage function combines aspects of material degradation, use, and consideration of material attributes that are important for satisfactory extraction of benefits from user interaction with heritage. In libraries and archives, {{it has been shown}} that users (readers and visitors) are mainly concerned with loss of textual information, which could lead to degradation being described as unacceptable, at which an object might become unfit for use and therefore damaged. The contribution explores the development of the damage function for historic paper based on data available in the literature. Results: We have modelled the dose–response function taking into account 121 paper degradation experiments with known T, RH of the environment, and pH of paper. The function is based on the Arrhenius equation and published water absorption isotherm functions for paper. New isoperm plots have been calculated and isochrones have been developed. These are plots linking points of equal expected ‘lifetime’, i. e. time until an object is expected to reach the state of threshold <b>fitness-for-use.</b> We also modelled demographic curves for a well-characterised research collection of historic papers, exploring the loss of fitness for use with time. Conclusions: The new tools enable us to evaluate scenarios of management of the storage environment as well as levels of access, for different types of library and archival paper. In addition, the costs and benefits of conservation interventions can be evaluated. The limitations of the function are {{the context of}} use (dark storage and reading), exclusive focus on the properties of an average paper type, and de-prioritised effect of pollutants; however, the latter can be considered separately. This work also demonstrates that transparent and publically accountable collection management decisions can be informed, and challenged by, effective interaction with a variety of stakeholders including the lay public...|$|E
40|$|The {{spatial data}} quality {{analysis}} {{is essential in}} environmental modelling for efficiently addressing the environmental change. As the complexity of data sets and the modelling capability of computer systems increase, the {{need to address the}} quality of both data and models is increasingly important. Integration with environmental modelling, the spatial data quality analysis and the geocomputation paradigm have been three important areas of GIS research. In this research they are brought together in the context of coastal oil spill modelling. The research covers the issues of measurement, modelling and management of spatial data quality. Coupling GIS and environmental modelling, the systematic solution is developed for coastal oil spill modelling which is representative of complex environmental models. The procedures of geospatial data quality analysis were implemented not only with existing GIS funLionality but also with various Geocomputation techniques. Spatial data quality analyses of inputs and model performances, which include sensitivity analyses, error propagation analyses and <b>fitness-for-use</b> analyses, were carried out for the coastal oil spill modelling. The results show that in coastal oil spill modelling, a better understanding and improvement of spatial data quality can be achieved through such analyses. The examples illustrate both the diversity of techniques and tools required when investigating spatial data quality issues in environmental modelling. The evidence of feasibility and practicality are also provided for these flexible analysis approaches. An overall methodology is developed at each stage of a project; with particular emphasis at inception to ensure adequate data quality on which to construct the models. Furthermore, the coupling strategy of GIS and environmental modelling is revised to include a geo-data quality analysis (GQA) engine. With growing availability of proprietary and public domain software suitable for spatial data quality analysis, GQA engines will be formed with the evolution of such software into tightly-coupled collection of tools external to GIS. The GQA engine would itself be tightly-coupled with GIS and environmental models to form a modelling framework...|$|E

Abstract, published in: Biodiversity Information Science and Standards 1 : e 20267 (14 Aug 2017) [URL] The FAIR guiding principles, first launched in 2014, for making research data more Findable, Accesible, Interoperable and Re-usable, {{have not yet}} been widely implemented for biodiversity data. Partly {{this may be due to}} the FAIR principles by themselves not yet being fully operational and easy to interpret. There is work in progress to remedy this by different task groups, and different attempts have already been made. In this paper I will give some concrete tips aimed at implementing the FAIR principles for biodiversity research data, focusing on the metadata, in order to enhance the quality of data by making them more findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable. Among the steps that could be taken to make biodiversity database records more findable and accessible is for example to add schema. org markup to the html sourcecode of corresponding web pages, as has been successfully employed in the Uniprot database. Recently biocaddie. org has mapped the metadata format DATS, Data Tag Suite, to schema. org and there is also the ongoing adaptation effort of bioschemas. org. In addition, there is the highly commendable work done by former biosharing. org, which now has become the more general fairsharing. org and which aims to enhance findability, promote the adoption of metadata standards by policy makers and interlink metadata standards among themselves and with repositories (Sansone 2017). Further, to make biodiversity records more interoperable and reusable, it is essential to provide metadata export to a selection of general standards and formats. In doing this, promises should be kept, meaning that exported metadata records should also validate against the schemas for the chosen format standard. By validating against schemas of both preferred metadata standard and export formats, biodiversity data records also stand a better chance of achieving what has been defined by GBIF and Vertnet as <b>Fitness-for-use,</b> encompassing e. g. accessibility, content, completeness, dataset-level or record level, error correction etc. (Russell 2011). That is, of course, provided the relevant metadata standards have validation schemas or online tools such as the Darwin Core Archive/EML validator that are sufficiently precise to check for these properties. If not, there is always the possibility of creating tailormade validation schemas serving the data quality needs of a specialized biodiversity data repository, e. g. using Schematron or JSON schema...|$|E
40|$|Although the {{importance}} of dataset <b>fitness-for-use</b> evaluation and intercomparison is widely recognised within the GIS community, no practical tools have yet been developed to support such interrogation. GeoViQua aims to develop a GEO label which will visually summarise and allow interrogation of key informational aspects of geospatial datasets upon which users rely when selecting datasets for use. The proposed GEO label will be integrated in the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) and {{will be used as}} a value and trust indicator for datasets accessible through the GEO Portal. As envisioned, the GEO label will act as a decision support mechanism for dataset selection and thereby hopefully improve user recognition of the quality of datasets. To date we have conducted 3 user studies to (1) identify the informational aspects of geospatial datasets upon which users rely when assessing dataset quality and trustworthiness, (2) elicit initial user views on a GEO label and its potential role and (3), evaluate prototype label visualisations. Our first study revealed that, when evaluating quality of data, users consider 8 facets: dataset producer information; producer comments on dataset quality; dataset compliance with international standards; community advice; dataset ratings; links to dataset citations; expert value judgements; and quantitative quality information. Our second study confirmed the relevance of these facets in terms of the community-perceived function that a GEO label should fulfil: users and producers of geospatial data supported the concept of a GEO label that provides a drill-down interrogation facility covering all 8 informational aspects. Consequently, we developed three prototype label visualisations and evaluated their comparative effectiveness and user preference via a third user study to arrive at a final graphical GEO label representation. When integrated in the GEOSS, an individual GEO label will be provided for each dataset in the GEOSS clearinghouse (or other data portals and clearinghouses) based on its available quality information. Producer and feedback metadata documents are being used to dynamically assess information availability and generate the GEO labels. The producer metadata document can either be a standard ISO compliant metadata record supplied with the dataset, or an extended version of a GeoViQua-derived metadata record, and is used to assess the availability of a producer profile, producer comments, compliance with standards, citations and quantitative quality information. GeoViQua is also currently developing a feedback server to collect and encode (as metadata records) user and producer feedback on datasets; these metadata records will be used to assess the availability of user comments, ratings, expert reviews and user-supplied citations for a dataset. The GEO label will provide drill-down functionality which will allow a user to navigate to a GEO label page offering detailed quality information for its associated dataset. At this stage, we are developing the GEO label service that will be used to provide GEO labels on demand based on supplied metadata records. In this presentation, we will provide a comprehensive overview of the GEO label development process, with specific emphasis on the GEO label implementation and integration into the GEOSS...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (PhD) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2014. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Aquaculture {{has proven}} to be a viable {{operation}} in multi-used irrigation reservoirs (also referred to as farm dams) in the Western Cape province (WCP) of South Africa. Many studies found that the <b>fitness-for-use</b> of these reservoirs for both net cage culture of fish and irrigation of crops is feasible. However, practising intensive fish farming in existing open water bodies can increase the nutrient levels of the water through organic loading, originating from uneaten feeds and fish metabolic wastes. Under such conditions the primary (irrigation) and secondary (drinking water and recreation) usage of the dam could be compromised by deteriorating water quality. Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) farming is done in Mediterranean climatic conditions of the WCP. This type of climate presents short production seasons with fluctuating water quality and quantity. The study investigated the dynamics of water physico-chemical parameters and assessed the long term impact of rainbow trout farming on irrigation reservoirs. Furthermore, associated land-use in the catchment of such integrated aqua-agriculture systems is described, and mitigation to minimise the impact of fish farming evaluated. The investigation concluded with assessing the contribution of aquaculture to rural and peri-urban communities. The aim is to present an integrated, socio-ecologically balanced farming system for irrigation reservoirs with associated aquaculture activities. A total of 35 reservoirs, including both fish farming and non-fish farming ones, were selected as research sites. They were located in three geographical regions namely, Overberg (Grabouw/Caledon), Boland (Stellenbosch/Franschhoek) and Breede River (Ceres/Worcester). Reservoirs were 0. 05). There was a statistically significant difference between surface and bottom waters for P and TAN (p 0. 05). The fish yield of farms were linked mainly to the quality of fingerlings and the feed conversion ratio (FCR) achieved (p 0. 05). In addition, the level of binder did not influence digestibility of the experimental diets. The floating garden study indicated that it was feasible to construct a low cost raft system that is easy to manage and can produce plant crops as a hydroponic system in conjunction with fish farming cages. The lettuces grown on farm dam water provided support for the premise that the water quality can be improved via extraction of nutrients for crop production. For the production of 3. 5 kg/m 2 lettuce, a ratio of 1. 09 plants/fish equal to 1. 84 g feed/day/plant would reduce the accumulation of soluble nutrients around floating net cage farming system. The socio-economic evaluation of the contribution of fish farming to the welfare of rural and peri-urban farming communities supported the notion that aquaculture can lead to the upliftment of participating communities. Seventy-one percent (71 %) of the respondents indicated that their motivation for exploring aquaculture is to supply fish to the wholesale market in order to generate income. Sixty-one percent (61 %) of the respondents conducted the sales themselves or co-opted family members to assist them. The contribution of aquaculture provided direct benefits through improvement in household income, subsistence food supply and skills development. Indirect benefits included providing an information hub for other emerging farmers, elevation of the fish farmer’s status in the community through greater wealth and knowledge creation and promoting sector diversification through new products and technology. The three main constraints to the promotion and growth of aquaculture were listed as lack of government support, insufficient market intelligence and access, and limited choice in the availability of suitable candidate aquaculture species. Irrigation reservoirs in the WCP have a history of enrichment through external sources supplying water via agricultural runoff (fertilisers and pesticides), catchment runoff (leaf litter and organic debris) and stormwater effluent (grey and black water). The incorporation of aquaculture into such dams adds extra nutrients to the water column and management is crucial to limit the nutrient loading and ensure environmental sustainability. Such an approach will ensure that commercial land-based crop farmers’ irrigation regime and water distribution operations would not be negatively affected. Therefore future research needs should focus on; firstly the prevention and minimisation of pollution deriving from aquaculture through improved production management and technology transfer, secondly the monitoring and evaluation of the catchment ecosystem as a continuum with all the external factors affecting the ecology of farm dams and thirdly, evaluating the sediment processes and dynamics as sinks for nutrient accumulation. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Akwakultuur het getoon dat dit ‘n lewensvatbare inisiatief is vir meerdoelige-gebruik van besproeiingsdamme (ook genoem plaasdamme) in die Wes-Kaap provinsie (WKP) van Suid-Afrika.

Nieteenstaande, die beoefening van intensiewe visboerdery in bestaande buitelug watersisteme kan lei tot ‘n toename in nutriëntvlakke van die water as gevolg van organiese belading afkomstig van ongevrete voere en metaboliese afvalstowwe van die vis. Onder sulke omstandigthede kan die primêre- (besproeiing) en die sekondêre (drinkwater en rekreasie) gebruik van die dam in gedrang kom weens ‘n afname in waterkwaliteit. Reënboogforel (Oncorhynchus mykiss) boerdery word beoefen in die omliggende Mediterreense klimaat van die WKP. Die tipe klimaat verskaf kort produksie-seisoene met wisselvallige water kwaliteit en kwantiteit. Die studie het die dinamika van water se fisies-chemiese parameters ondersoek en het die impak van forelboerdery op besproeiingdamme oor die langtermyn beskryf. Verder het die studie die geassosieerde landgebruik in die opvangsgebied met geïntegreerde akwa-landbou sisteme beskryf, asook moontlike toetrede (mitigasie maatreëls) geëvalueer wat die impak moontlik kan verlaag. Die ondersoek is afgesluit deur die bydrae wat akwakultuur lewer aan landelike en semi-stedelike gebiede, te beskryf. Die hoofdoel is die daarstelling van ‘n geïntegreerde, sosio-ekologiese gebalanseerde sisteem vir besproeiingdamme met gesamentlike akwakultuuraktiwiteite. ‘n Totaal van 35 besproeiingsdamme, insluitend die met visboerdery en nie-visboerdery, is gekies as navorsingspersele. Dit is hoofsaaklik geleë in drie geografiese gebiede naamlik, Overberg (Grabouw/Caledon), Boland (Stellenbosch/Franschhoek) en Breederivier (Ceres/Worcester). Die reservoirs is almal 50 cm word benodig om goeie voeding te handhaaf. Die OS het gewissel van 0. 3 – 16. 4 mg/L met waardes onder 5 mg/L aangeteken gedurende somer wanneer wateronttrekking en temperature hoog was. Dit het gelei tot ongunstige toestande vir forelboerdery. Die situasie swaai om met die begin van winter wanneer die damme vol reën en die OS bo 5 mg/L styg soos benodig vir forelboerdery. Die P-vlakke het gewissel van 0. 001 – 0. 735 mg/L. Hoër waardes is aangeteken gedurende die winteromkeerfase wanneer die bodem en oppervlak se water meng. Konsentrasies bo 0. 01 mg/L kan tot eutrofikasie van watersisteme lei. TAS het gewissel van 0 - 015 – 6. 480 mg/L. Hoër konsentrasies is aangeteken gedurende die somer wanneer temperature hoog is en damvlakke laag. By hoë pH’s en temperature kan TAS toksies wees vir vis. The algemene lae kleinste kwadaat gemiddelde (KKG) waarde vir TAS het getoon dat daar ‘n klein impak op die omgewing was wanneer forelboerdery bedryf word gedurende die koue, winter reënvalmaande. Forelboerdery val saam met omstandigthede wanneer die watertemperature laag is, damvlakke hoog en die reservoirs oorloop. Die verskil in die bodem- en oppervlak water in die besproeiingsdamme en die ligging van die perseel is vasgestel om meer belangrik te wees as die teenwoordigheid of afwesigheid van visboerdery. Die verskil in die bodem en oppervlak is toe te skryf aan die toestand van die sediment waar nutriënte kan opgaar. In monomiktiese damme soos gevind in Mediterreende areas, vind vermenging plaas gedurende die winteromkeerfase. Nutriënte word vrygestel a. g. v. die vermenging van die oppervlak en bodem se water wat dan veroorsaak word deur harde reën en windturbulensie. Die konsentrasie van organiese materiaal in die sediment en bodem water is ‘n funksie van die nutriëntlading met tyd, ongeag of dit afkomstig was vanaf visboerdery of landbou-aktiwiteite. Dit is dus moelik om die spesifieke oorsaak van besoedeling af te baken. In gevalle waar die reservoirs alreeds eutrofies is a. g. v. aangewese landbouaktiwiteite, kan die toestand van die waterbron vererger indien akwakultuur toegepas word. Daar is ‘n statistiese noemenswaardige verskil tussen visboerdery en nie-visboerdery vir P, Secchi-skyf, totale gesuspendeerde vaste stowwe en nitrite-stikstof (p 0. 05). Daar is ‘n statistiese noemenswaardige verskil tussen oppervlak- en bodem water vir P en TAS (p< 0. 05). Een moontlike rede vir hoër P en TAS konsentrasies in die bodemwater, is die akkumulasie van beide parameters in die sediment en gevolglike vrystelling in die waterkolom wanneer die water gemeng word. ‘n Twee dimensionele spreidingstipping is geprodueer deur die waardes te gebruik van die eerste twee hoofkomponente. Die eerste twee hoofkomponente dra by 40 % en 17 % van die totale variansie onderskeidelik, en die twee groepering van visboerdery en nie-visboerdery het nie duidelik getoon nie. Die voorkoms en verspreiding van phytoplankton biomassa het gewissel met die verandering in damvlakke en nutriëntkonsentrasies. Die aanwesige phytoplanktongemeenskappe is belangrik vir die visboer vir twee redes: 1. Dit kan wisselende OS-vlakke versoorsaak deur die verbruik (respirasie en dekomposisie) en produksie (fotosintese) daarvan. 2. Dit kan lei tot alge na-smake van vis wanneer geosmin-produserende phytoplankton spesies aanwesig is. The frekwensie van voorkoms het getoon dat die Groep Chlorophyta (insluitend die genera, Chlamydomonas, Closterium, Oocystis, Scenedesmus, Staurastrum, Tetraedron, ens.) die meeste voorkom (n= 371), met Chrysophyta (insluitend die genera, Dinobryon, Mallomonas, Synura, ens.) die minste (n= 34). Daar is ‘n statistiese noemenswaardige verskil tussen genera voorkoms en seisoen (p< 0. 05) vir phytoplankton...|$|E
