40|$|Abstract. Polacrilin Potassium NF is a {{commonly}} used weak cation exchange resin <b>disintegrant</b> in pharmaceutical tablets. The {{objective of this}} research was to evaluate the effects of sorbed moisture on physical characteristics and <b>disintegrant</b> performance of four brands of Polacrilin Potassium NF. The disintegrants were stored in five different relative humidity chambers and their dynamic vapor adsorption–desorption analysis, effect of moisture on their compressibility, compactability, particle size, morphology, water uptake rate, and disintegration ability were studied. Moisture seemed to plasticize the disintegrants, reducing their yield pressures. However, certain optimum amount of moisture was found to be useful in increasing the compactablity of the tablets containing disintegrants. The tablets, however, lost their tensile strengths beyond this optimum moisture content. Moisture caused two brands of the disintegrants to swell; however, two other brands aggregated upon exposure to moisture. Swelling without aggregation increased the water uptake, and in turn the <b>disintegrant</b> performance. However, aggregation probably reduced the porosities of the disintegrants, reducing their water uptake rate and <b>disintegrant</b> performance. Different brands of Polacrilin Potassium NF differed in the abilities to withstand the effects of moisture on their functionality. Effect of moisture on <b>disintegrant</b> performance of Polacrilin Potassium NF needs to be considered before its use in tablets made by wet granulation.

40|$|Fast-disintegration {{technologies}} have encountered increased interest from {{industries in the}} past decades. In order to orientate the formulators to {{the choice of the}} best disintegrating agent, the most common disintegrants were selected and their ability to quickly disintegrants compressed tablets was evaluated. For this study, a central composite design was used. The main factors included were the concentration of <b>disintegrant</b> (X- 1) and the compression force (X- 2). These factors were studied for tablets containing either Zeparox((R)) or Pearlitol 200 ((R)) as soluble diluents and six LH 11 and LH 31, different disintegrants: L-HPC(R) LH 11 and LH 31, Lycatab PGS((R)), Vivasol((R)), Kollidon CL(R), and Explotab((R)). Their micromeritics properties were previously determined. The response variables were disintegration time (Y- 1), tensile strength (Y- 2) and porosity (Y- 3). Whatever the diluent, the longest disintegration time is obtained with Vivasol((R)) as the <b>disintegrant,</b> while Kollidon CL(R) leads to the shortest disintegration times. Exception for Lycatab PGS((R)) and L-HPC LH 11 ((R)), formulations with Pearlitol 200 ((R)) disintegrate faster. Almost the same results are obtained with porosity: no relevant effect of <b>disintegrant</b> concentration is observed, since porosity is mainly correlated to the compression force. In particular, highest values are obtained with Zeparox((R)) as the diluent when compared to Pearlitol 2000 and, as the type of <b>disintegrant</b> is concerned, no difference is observed. Tensile strength models have been all statistically validated and are all highly dependent on the compression force. Lycatab PGS((R)) concentration does not affect disintegration time, mainly increased by the increase of compression pressure. When Pearlitol 2000 is used with Vivasol((R)), disintegration time is more influenced by the <b>disintegrant</b> concentration than by the compression pressure, an increase in concentration leading to a significant and relevant increase of the disintegration time. With Zeparox((R)), the interaction between the two controlled variables is more complex: there is no effect of compression force on the disintegration time for a small amount of <b>disintegrant.</b> but a significant increase for higher concentrations. With Kollidon CL(R), the main factor influencing the disintegration time is the compression force. rather than the <b>disintegrant</b> concentration. Increasing both the compression force and the <b>disintegrant</b> concentration leads to an increase of the disintegration time. For lower Kollidon CL(R) percentages, the compression pressure increases dramatically the tablet disintegration. With the Explotab((R)), whatever the increase of compression force, the <b>disintegrant</b> concentration leads to an increase of the disintegration time. According to Student's t-test, only the compression force significantly and strongly influences the disintegration time when Pearlitol 200 ((R)) is used. A slight interaction and some trends nevertheless appear: above 150 MPa, increasing the <b>disintegrant</b> concentration leads to a shortened disintegration time, below this limit the opposite effect is observed...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to propose a method of {{determining}} the exact value of <b>disintegrant</b> ratio in a binary drug-disintegrant compacted mixture for a minimum disintegration time in the case of spherical particles. Disintegration is a limiting factor in dissolution process of compact for low water soluble active ingredients. As disintegration time is shortest at a certain ratio of <b>disintegrant,</b> a calculation of this value is important for solid dosage from design to enhance disintegration and dissolution process. According to percolation theory, a minimum disintegration time corresponds to the formation of a continuous water-conducting cluster through the entire tablet. The critical volumetric ratio at which the cluster is formed is named percolation threshold and has the value of 0. 16 for random close packed (RCP) sphere systems. RCP systems where chosen as the best model for compacts consisting of spherical particles. Two cases for water diffusion through the tablet were identified, according to geometrical considerations between <b>disintegrant</b> And drug particles. These cases determine if <b>disintegrant</b> particles can have a contact between each other within the compact and thus if porosity and <b>disintegrant</b> volume are included in the continuous cluster. An equation for both cases is presented in the form of piecewise function to determine the minimal <b>disintegrant</b> volumetric ratio for a binary drug/disintegrant compact in order to achieve a minimum disintegration time.
