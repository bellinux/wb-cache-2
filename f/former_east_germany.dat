50|$|After German re-unification and the {{subsequent}} opening of the files of the <b>former</b> <b>East</b> <b>Germany's</b> state security service {{it was revealed that}} the traffic accident had been an assassination attempt orchestrated by the Stasi, confirming the longtime suspicions held by many.

5000|$|Berlin was {{marred by}} disjointed {{economic}} restructuring, associated with massive deindustrialisation.

25|$|Because of {{international}} pressure Turkey was ostensibly restricted to providing economic support to Azerbaijan. Nonetheless, the Turkish army and intelligence services launched undercover operations to supply Azerbaijan with arms and military personnel.

Western authors reported several major shipments of weapons from Turkey, including bringing an arsenal of Soviet-made arms from the <b>former</b> <b>East</b> <b>Germany.</b>|$|E
25|$|Although {{conservative}} in many ways, Germany nevertheless differs from other German-speaking regions in Europe, being much more progressive on women's {{right to be}} politically involved, compared to neighbouring Switzerland (where women obtained {{the right to vote}} in 1971 at federal level, and at local canton level in 1990 in the canton of Appenzell Innerrhoden) and Liechtenstein in 1984. In Germany, there are also strong regional differences; for instance Southern Germany (particularly Bavaria) is more conservative than other parts of Germany; while <b>former</b> <b>East</b> <b>Germany</b> is more supporting of women's professional life than former West Germany.|$|E
25|$|The Final Settlement Treaty ended Berlin's {{special status}} as a {{separate}} area under Four Power control.

The Government of Germany asked the Allies to maintain a military presence in Berlin until the complete withdrawal of the Western Group of Forces (ex-Soviet) from the territory of the <b>former</b> <b>East</b> <b>Germany.</b> The Russian withdrawal was completed 31 August 1994. Ceremonies were held on 8 September 1994, to mark the final departure of Western Allied troops from Berlin.|$|E

It awards two points for a win and one point for a draw, as this was the system in use at the time. The matches of the transition round made necessary by {{the adoption of a}} Soviet-style calendar year schedule in 1955 are not included. In its final season (1990-91), the competition was known as the NOFV-Oberliga, before becoming part of the DFB (Deutscher Fußball-Bund, German Football Association).|$|R
50|$|As {{far back}} as 1986, in the <b>former</b> socialist <b>East</b> <b>Germany,</b> it was planned to convert one of the huge open coal mine pits into a race track. In the late 1990s, this idea was taken up again {{in order to build}} a {{replacement}} for the AVUS in Berlin.|$|R
25|$|In 1990, {{after the}} fall of the Eastern Bloc, the <b>former</b> <b>East</b> <b>Germany</b> became part of the Communities as part of a reunified Germany. A close fiscal {{integration}} with the introduction of the euro was not matched by institutional oversight making things more troubling. Attempts to solve the problems and to make the EU more efficient and coherent had limited success.With further enlargement planned to include the former communist states of Central and Eastern Europe, as well as Cyprus and Malta, the Copenhagen criteria for candidate members to join the EU were agreed upon in June 1993. The expansion of the EU introduced a new level of complexity and discord.|$|E
25|$|Around the world, {{many local}} brands compete with Coke. In South and Central America Kola Real, known as Big Cola in Mexico, {{is a growing}} {{competitor}} to Coca-Cola. On the French island of Corsica, Corsica Cola, made by brewers of the local Pietra beer, is a growing competitor to Coca-Cola. In the French region of Brittany, Breizh Cola is available. In Peru, Inca Kola outsells Coca-Cola, which led The Coca-Cola Company to purchase the brand in 1999. In Sweden, Julmust outsells Coca-Cola during the Christmas season. In Scotland, the locally produced Irn-Bru was more popular than Coca-Cola until 2005, when Coca-Cola and Diet Coke began to outpace its sales. In the <b>former</b> <b>East</b> <b>Germany,</b> Vita Cola, invented during Communist rule, is gaining popularity.|$|E
25|$|This sort of scheme {{needs to}} have a far broader base than is {{currently}} the case, it requires organization and the setting up of waste brokerages where lists of currently available wastes are and the quantities available. One of the problems is once a demand for a waste is known or shown then the material is no longer a “waste” but a sellable commodity which often prices itself out of the market, c.f waste cement kiln dust and N-viro (lime conditioned sewage sludge fertilizer). In the <b>former</b> <b>East</b> <b>Germany,</b> organic household waste was collected and used as fodder for pigs. This integrated system was made possible by the state's control of agriculture; the complexities of continuing it in a market economy after German reunification meant the system had to be discontinued.|$|E

40|$|Economic {{institutions}} structure {{links between}} labor-market informality and social stratification. The present study explores how periods of institutional change and post-socialist market transition alter network-based job finding, in particular informal recruitment. We highlight how market transitions affect both the prevalence {{and distribution of}} network-based recruitment channels: open-market environments reduce informal recruitment’s prevalence but increase its association with high wages. We test these propositions using {{the case of the}} <b>former</b> <b>East</b> <b>Germany’s</b> market transition and a comparison with West Germany’s more stable institutional environment. Following transition, workers in lower tiers increasingly turned toward formal intermediaries, active employee search, and socially “disembedded” matches. Meanwhile, employers actively recruited workers into higher-wage positions. Implications for market transition theory and post-socialist stratification are discussed...|$|R
