5|$|As the {{blizzard}} progressed, Patrick Dolan began to rant deliriously, stripped off his clothes, {{and ran into}} the woods. He returned shortly afterwards and died a few hours later. Not long after, possibly because 12-year-old Lemuel Murphy was near death, some of the group began to eat flesh from Dolan's body. Lemuel's sister tried to feed some to her brother, but he died shortly afterwards. Eddy, Salvador, and Luis refused to eat. The next morning, the group stripped the muscle and organs from the bodies of Antonio, Dolan, Graves, and Murphy and dried it to store for the days ahead, taking care to ensure that nobody would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> his or her relatives.|$|E
5|$|In the Anushasana Parva of the Mahabharata, the god Shiva is {{described}} as having cast a curse on Surabhi. This curse is interpreted as {{a reference to the}} following legend: Once, when the gods Brahma and Vishnu were fighting over who was superior, a fiery pillar—linga (symbol of Shiva)—emerged before them. It was that decided whoever found the end of this pillar was superior. Brahma flew to the skies to try to find the top of the pillar, but failed. So Brahma forced Surabhi (in some versions, Surabhi instead suggested that Brahma should lie) to falsely testify to Vishnu that Brahma had seen the top of the linga; Shiva punished Surabhi by putting a curse on her so that her bovine offspring would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> unholy substances. This tale appears in the Skanda Purana.|$|E
5|$|The simple, low-crowned teeth {{indicate}} that Paraceratherium was a browser with a diet consisting of relatively soft leaves and shrubs. Later rhinoceroses were grazers, with high-crowned teeth because their diets contained grit that quickly wore down their teeth. Studies of mesowear on Paraceratherium teeth confirm the creatures {{had a soft}} diet of leaves; microwear studies {{have yet to be}} conducted. Isotope analysis shows that Paraceratherium fed chiefly on C3 plants, which are mainly leaves. Like its perissodactyl relatives, the horses, tapirs, and other rhinoceroses, Paraceratherium would have been a hindgut fermenter; it would extract relatively little nutrition from its food and would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> large volumes to survive. Like other large herbivores, Paraceratherium would have had a large digestive tract.|$|E

5|$|With {{the spiders}} distracted, Finn and Jake {{try to escape}} from the web, but to no avail. Ed later returns with a flaming sword, which he {{presents}} to Barb. However, she gets angry, arguing that he picked the gift because he liked, not because she would like it. Angered, Ed cuts the web, releasing Finn and Jake; he claims that Barb is dependent on him for food, as she cannot spin her own webs due to some unknown dysfunction. Barb attacks Ed, noting that she will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> him instead. Finn tries to help, but is pinned to a wall by Barb, who suddenly beings to moan as if in pain. Just then, an enormous egg sack emerges from her epigyne. The sack bursts, giving birth to thousands of tiny spiders, who proceed to bury Finn and Jake.|$|E
5|$|Bethe left Germany in 1933, {{moving to}} England after {{receiving}} an offer {{for a position}} as lecturer at the University of Manchester for a year through Sommerfeld's connection to William Lawrence Bragg. He moved in with his friend Rudolf Peierls and Peierls' wife Genia. Peierls was a fellow German physicist who had also been barred from academic positions in Germany because his parents were Jewish. This meant that Bethe had someone to speak to in German, and did not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> English food. Their relationship was professional as well as personal. Peierls aroused Bethe's interest in nuclear physics. After James Chadwick and Maurice Goldhaber discovered the photodisintegration of deuterium, Chadwick challenged Bethe and Peierls {{to come up with}} a theoretical explanation of this phenomenon. This they did on the four-hour train ride from Cambridge back to Manchester. Bethe would investigate further in the years ahead.|$|E

500|$|By 23 August, {{it seemed}} that Wild’s no-stockpiling policy had failed. The {{surrounding}} sea was dense with pack ice that would halt any rescue ship, food supplies were running out and no penguins were coming ashore. Orde-Lees wrote: [...] "We shall <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> the one who dies first [...] there’s many a true word said in jest". Wild’s thoughts were now turning seriously {{to the possibility of}} a boat trip to Deception Island—he planned to set out on 5 October, in the hoping of meeting a whaling ship— when, on 30 August 1916, the ordeal ended suddenly with the appearance of Shackleton and Yelcho.|$|E

Known for his dedication to maintaining high standards in the food industry, he relished arguing court cases [...] "in defense of sanitary practices in the handling and processing of perishable foods".

500|$|Bamboo shoots {{are more}} easily digested than leaves, exhibiting the highest {{digestibility}} in summer and autumn, intermediate digestibility in the spring, and lowest digestibility in the winter. These variations correlate with the nutrient contents in the bamboo. Red pandas process bamboo poorly, especially the cellulose and cell wall components. This implies microbial digestion plays only a minor role in their digestive strategy. To survive on this poor-quality diet, they <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> the high-quality sections of the bamboo plant, such as the tender leaves and shoots, in large quantities, over [...] of fresh leaves and [...] of fresh shoots daily. This food passes through the digestive tract fairly rapidly (about 2–4 hr) so as to maximize daily nutrient intake. Red pandas can taste artificial sweeteners, such as aspartame, and are the only nonprimates known {{to be able to}} do so.|$|E

500|$|In {{contrast}} to the relative disorder of English eighteenth century cookery books such as Eliza Smith's The Compleat Housewife (1727) or Elizabeth Raffald's The Experienced English Housekeeper (1769), Mrs Rundell's text is strictly ordered and neatly subdivided. Where those books consist almost wholly of recipes, Mrs Rundell begins by explaining techniques of economy ("A minute account of the annual income and the times of payment {{should be kept in}} writing"), how to carve, how to stew, how to season, to [...] "Look clean, be careful and nice in work, so that those who <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> might look on", how to choose and use steam-kettles and the bain-marie, the meanings of foreign terms like pot-au-feu ("truly the foundation of all good cookery"), all the joints of meat, the [...] "basis of all well-made soups", so it is page 65 before actual recipes begin.|$|E
500|$|For the album, Cher {{collaborated with}} several musicians {{including}} Stargate, Chicane and previous collaborator Mark Taylor. She {{said she felt}} lucky for having {{a chance to have}} [...] "great songs and great producers" [...] for the album. Cher said her favorite song slated for the album was a cover version of [...] "When the Money's Gone", written by Bruce Roberts, stating it was [...] "so perfect" [...] for her. [...] "It's about this person who's , 'If I lose all my money, will you still love me if we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> fast food out of a beat up car?'. It's so dance. It's so gay. It's so good", she said. The album cover, photographed by Michael Lavine, was revealed through Cher official website on October 8, 2001. It depicts Cher wearing a [...] "flowing" [...] blond wig in contrast to her all-black, medieval-like outfit. The Dallas Morning News commented that [...] "even with a pensive look on her exquisitely snipped and tucked face, she commands attention".|$|E
500|$|The {{scene in}} which Daenerys has to eat a horse's heart was filmed in The Paint Hall studio in Belfast. There, the {{production}} built the Dothraki temple in which the scene is set – a large semicircular structure of wood and woven reeds, inspired by Marsh Arab constructions. [...] The heart actress Emilia Clarke ate was, according to Weiss, [...] "basically a giant, three-pound gummi bear covered in fake sugar blood – which has the added attraction of drawing real flies." [...] Through repeated takes, Clarke did <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> much of the sugary heart. She said that it tasted of bleach and was made tough and gristly {{by the addition of}} valves made from [...] "something like dried pasta." [...] Clarke did not have to act in the shots {{at the end of the}} {{scene in which}} Daenerys almost throws up the last bit of heart, as she was indeed close to vomiting at that point.|$|E

He said the introspective chorus made him {{take a moment}} to reflect on his own rhymes. He detailed himself creating his verse saying, [...] "After I wrote my verse, it was my second show in Seattle. We did two shows, because I sold out both shows. There was like 2,000 the first night, and another 2,000 on the second night. So it was like, 'Whoa, we sold out both shows!' I was already tired from the night before, and we already had booked the studio time in Seattle. I went there, and I finished the last four bars of the verse I wrote. I wrote most of the verse—the first eight bars—on bus. It was getting closer to the show, and I wrote the last four bars at the studio because, our meet and greets aren’t an hour anymore. There’s like 300 people or 400 people, so you’re there until 6 pm now instead of 3 or 4. Now we got to go the studio, and I gotta be on stage at 9 pm, so it’s coming down to the wire I still <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> and whatnot. But I did it, and after I did it, I’m like, 'Ooh, the verse is elite.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Konnan {{joined the}} New World Order (nWo) on July 14, 1997. Konnan {{developed}} an increasingly hip-hop based gimmick and was nicknamed [...] "K-Dogg." [...] During his first {{stint in the}} nWo, Konnan feuded with the Luchadores whom he had brought to WCW. During this storyline, he wrestled in a Mexican Death match at Road Wild against Rey Mysterio, Jr. and a match against Juventud Guerrera at Uncensored in March 1998. When the nWo divided into two rival factions on the May 4, 1998 episode of Nitro, Konnan sided with the nWo Wolfpac, led by Kevin Nash. The Wolfpac feuded with nWo Hollywood, led by Hollywood Hogan and became tweeners. On the November 30, 1998 episode of Nitro, Konnan defeated Chris Jericho for the World Television Championship. His reign lasted until December 28, 1998, when he lost to nWo Hollywood member Scott Steiner on Nitro following interference from Buff Bagwell. When {{the two halves of}} the nWo reunited in January 1999, Konnan was thrown out of the nWo for standing up for Rey Misterio, Jr and was attacked by Lex Luger. As a result, he became a face and teamed with Misterio to fight the nWo. After feuding with nWo member Lex Luger, Konnan and Mysterio, Jr. were defeated by The Outsiders at SuperBrawl IX, with The Outsiders removing Mysterio's mask in the process. Konnan later criticized WCW for not respecting Mexican wrestling culture by writing storylines that saw several Mexican wrestlers unceremoniously unmasked (Juventud Guerrera, Psicosis, and Mysterio). He compared asking a luchador to remove their mask to [...] "going to Japan and telling the Japanese they <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> with a fork instead of chopsticks." ...|$|E
