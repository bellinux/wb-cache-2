The horizontal variations of <b>rip</b> current <b>systems</b> are described through the use of the quasi-three-dimensional nearshore circulation model SHORECIRC. Model predictions are compared to laboratory measurements of waves and current velocities throughout the entire <b>rip</b> current <b>system</b> and show reasonable agreement. The rips in the two channels are found to behave differently because of the depth variation across the basin. It is found that higher bottom stress leads to more stable flow where the rip current meanders less and fewer eddies are generated. The wave current interaction creates forcing which reduces the distance rip currents flow offshore and can lead to a slow pulsation of the rip current. This pulsation is in addition to the instabilities of a jet which can also be present in rip currents. The three dimensionality of the <b>rip</b> current <b>system</b> is found to {{have a significant effect on}} the overall circulation patterns...|$|R

40|$|The {{macrotidal}} intermediate-dissipative {{beaches of}} the southwest UK display strong seasonality whereby extensive low-tide bar/rip systems form during the spring season. These features reach a state of maximum development during the summer months, when strong rip currents are present at various stages of the tide that switch on/off due to tidal translation. This research investigates {{for the first time}} the circulation and dynamics of macrotidal <b>rip</b> <b>systems</b> from the perspective of the flow dynamics and surf zone circulation. A field experiment was conducted on a macro-tidal (range 6. 3 m) with low-tide bar/rip morphology to quantify the circulation and dynamics of the <b>rip</b> current <b>systems.</b> Measurements of flow velocity, water depth and suspended sediment concentration were collected over the channel and shoal of transverse bar/rip system using an in-situ sensor arry, whilst the surf zone circulation patterns were monitored with post-processed GPS drifter floats. The in-situ data show that currents within the <b>rip</b> <b>system</b> are strongly correlated with the stage of the tide and maximum current speeds are recorded during the 3 -hour period immediately around low water. During this period, wave breaking is maximised on the adjacent shoal resulting in a longshore gradient in wave dissipation. The GPS drifters indicate that an extensive rotational surf zone circulation pattern exists, whereby the offshore flow within the rip channel returns landwards over the intertidal bar from the outer edge of the surf zone...|$|R

S unit allowing rip current velocity and direction to be recorded. Wave, tide, meteorological and beach topography data was collected during the survey period and examined as possible environmental variables and controls on the system. A total of 119 individual tracks were collected under a range of wave heights (1. 12 to 2. 36 metres), periods (6. 4 to 12. 9 seconds) and directions (264 ° to 329 °). Measurements were made at low, mid and high tide and across the spring and neap tides phases. A range of daily averaged velocities from 0. 81 to 1. 41 m/s were recorded. The maximum rip current velocity for a single track was 1. 90 m/s. The fastest rip current velocities were recorded around mid tide with velocity falling to zero at low and high tide. A relationship of = 0. 416 was found between mean maximimi rip current velocity and wave height. The location of the rip current remained fixed to {{the western end of}} the bay near the ruined harbour throughout survey, moving in a cross shore as the tide changed.

Here, we studied the effects of horizontal mixing on wave–current interactions by testing several diffusivity estimates in a fully coupled 3 D wave–current model run at two different spatial resolutions.

However, it {{has been difficult to}} tune up PID controller gains accurately because of complexity and nonlinearity of industrial plants.

The experiments include both in situ water level and velocity measurements and optical visualization of the flow field {{under a variety of}} normal-incident wave conditions. Digital video is used to record surface drifters moving through a <b>rip</b> current <b>system.</b> A method is presented that tracks these digitally-recorded drifters into long Lagrangian sequences. The laboratory measurements capture both an Eulerian and Lagrangian description of the <b>rip</b> current <b>system.</b> Time-averaged <b>rip</b> current properties are calculated and analyzed using both in situ and video measurements. From the video, Lagrangian velocities are computed with forward differencing of the low-pass filtered drifter tracks. Wave properties are also estimated using the orbital drifter motions and linear (Airy) wave theory. The effects of various wave conditions on the time-averaged <b>rip</b> current <b>systems</b> are investigated to show that wave height is a critical parameter. Measurements of circulation cells are obtained by spatially averaging the drifter track velocity measurements into a polar grid ranging from 0. 25 m to 3. 25 m {{from the center of the}} cell. Circulation cell features, such as the center of circulation and cell width, are calculated to characterize their response to various wave conditions. Spectral analyses are used to characterize the rip current pulsations in the experimental measurements. Three frequencies are found to be energetic in several of the experiments in the low frequency band: the wave group frequency, a lower frequency, and the interaction of the wave group and lower frequencies. Some experiments have significant energy at each of the three peaks, where others have only one or none. The lower frequency motions have also been found in the video measurements and attributed to rip meandering. Possible causes for the low-frequency pulsations, including wave basin seiching, circulation cell instabilities, and wave-current interaction, are discussed.

40|$|Proceedings of the 11 th International Coastal Symposium, Szczecin, PolandInternational audienceField and {{numerical}} studies recently {{challenged the}} traditional paradigm of <b>rip</b> currents <b>systems</b> that states that rip currents produce a continuous interchange of waters between the surf zone and shelf. Instead {{it is suggested}} that rip current flow fields consist of semi-enclosed, large-scale vortices that retain floating material (e. g. drifters) {{at a rate of about}} 80 - 90 %. In this paper is presented a laboratory rip current experiment over eight contrasting nature-like beach morphologies involving deployment of a large number of drifters. When the rip current was symmetric over a typical bar and rip morphology (4 out of the 8 cases), only about 10 % of the drifters entering the rip exited the surf zone, whereas when the mean rip current was asymmetric, more drifters (~ 30 - 45 %) entering in the rip exited the surf zone compartment. Drifters exiting the surf zone compartment were not systematically caught by a pulsating jet. More frequently, these drifters were likely caught in a vortex being shed offshore, as they often looped track in the vicinity of the <b>rip</b> <b>head</b> before exiting the surfzone compartment. This confirms new thoughts on rip currents that are very important from the perspective of both mixing in the nearshore and beach safety: <b>rip</b> currents <b>systems</b> only sporadically produce intense interchange between the waters of the surf zone and the shelf.
