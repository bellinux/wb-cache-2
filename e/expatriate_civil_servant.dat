This question is explored by analyzing a preventive public health initiative for diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases that was imported from Finland and adopted by policy actors in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. Despite the cultural, contextual, geographical, and environmental dissimilarities between the two countries, officials chose a program from a rural Finnish province (North Karelia) to combat the high rate of diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases among Abu Dhabi’s population. However, the policy that was successful in North Karelia did not achieve the desired results in Abu Dhabi. This dissertation offers a bi-partite investigation of the policy transfer process and the implementation outcome. The first section states that specific policy transfer agents, namely <b>expatriate</b> <b>civil</b> <b>servants</b> who were not born, raised, or trained in the importing country, influence ‘what’ and ‘where from’ policies are imported. It argues that the highly politicized structure of Abu Dhabi’s public administration institutions, coupled with the demand for quick results and the lack of local policy-making capacity, leave these <b>expatriate</b> <b>civil</b> <b>servants</b> with little choice but to tackle local problems with foreign solutions with which they are more familiar. The second section addresses some of the reasons behind the perceived failure of transferred policies in Abu Dhabi. On the one hand, it argues that, being unempowered and unchallenged, <b>expatriate</b> <b>civil</b> <b>servants</b> face obstacles that hinder their ability to tackle issues that may arise during implementation or to address sensitive topics that may underlie policy challenges. On the other hand, the culture of competition, rather than cooperation, in public policy-making among governmental organizations substantially decreases transferred policies’ chances of success. The evaluation of the outcome of the implementation is used as point of departure to analyze the entire process. This matters in that it highlights the influence of a politicized public administration on policy transfer in particular and public policy in general. It is also significant because it demonstrates how to better recognize problematic policy transfer by evaluating a combination of factors: the process of transfer, the structure of the importing institution, and the motives of the agent of transfer. By ensuring that receiving institutions can properly incorporate and implement imported solutions, importing countries can increase policy transfers’ chances of success. This contributes to understanding a specific type of policy transfer agent and transfer process in the Gulf Cooperation Council region, where the proportion of <b>expatriate</b> <b>civil</b> <b>servants</b> is large. This may also be applicable in other countries that recruit <b>expatriate</b> <b>civil</b> <b>servants</b> or individual consultants {{to play a role in}} the policy-making process...|$|R

Government employees are no longer exempt from this [...] "rollover" [...] policy, according to this report in a local newspaper. The governor has used his constitutional powers, which give him absolute control for the disposition of civil service employees, to determine which <b>expatriate</b> <b>civil</b> <b>servants</b> are dismissed after seven years service and which are not.|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} week was tense throughout the country, with government employees in Zomba going on strike and senior <b>civil</b> <b>servants</b> (almost all Europeans) staying home {{in fear of}} violence. On September 30, Banda signed an order restricting Chipembere to within four miles of his home in Malindi. On 25 October, Banda claimed at an MPC meeting that the ex-ministers were plotting to overthrow him by force. Chipembere left his house on 28 October to go into hiding, following which Banda ordered his arrest, “…alive if possible, but if not alive then any other way.” Chipembere later claimed that <b>expatriate</b> <b>civil</b> <b>servants</b> and security officers had turned Banda against him and his colleagues.|$|R
50|$|He was {{appointed}} Secretary for Constitutional Affairs in 1991. During his service, {{he was responsible}} for promoting the constitutional reform package of the last Governor Chris Patten. Despite Patten's constitutional reform package was strongly opposed by the Beijing government, Sze defended the package and therefore was criticised by the Beijing authorities. He {{was appointed}} Secretary for the Civil Service in 1994. At the time <b>expatriate</b> <b>civil</b> <b>servants</b> could renew their contracts automatically, which was deemed as unfair to the Chinese <b>civil</b> <b>servants.</b> He abolished the system and implemented the localisation of the civil service {{on the eve of the}} handover. From 1992 to 1996, he was a member of the Executive Council of Hong Kong. He announced his retirement from the civil service in 1996, right before the handover.|$|R
25|$|The British {{government}} thought {{an outcome}} {{to the crisis}} in which Banda shed some of his powers to the ministers but remained in charge would be ideal but, failing that, it was prepared to back him against his ministers. There was the fear that Chipembere and Chiume would align Malawi too closely with China, whereas Banda would be more favourable to British interests. Glyn Jones, as Governor-general was {{in a difficult position}} as he could only advise and had no executive power. In September 1964 his frequent meeting with Banda and the ministers, except for Chiume (who refused to meet him), both before and after they left office, were aimed at an accommodation between Banda and {{at least some of the}} ministers. His constitutional duty was however to support Banda once he had won the vote of confidence. Chipembere later claimed that <b>expatriate</b> <b>civil</b> <b>servants</b> and security officers had turned Banda against him and his colleagues. While there is little doubt that many expatriates preferred Banda to Chipembere and Chiume, there is no real evidence that they caused this estrangement.|$|R

25|$|Prior to the CPP taking office, British {{officials}} had prepared a ten-year plan for development. With demands for infrastructure improvements {{coming in from}} all over the colony, Nkrumah approved it in general, but halved the time to five years. The colony was in good financial shape, with reserves from years of cocoa profit held in London, and Nkrumah was able to spend freely. Modern trunk roads were built along the coast and within the interior. The rail system was modernised and expanded. Modern water and sewer systems were installed in most towns, where housing schemes were begun. Construction began on a new harbour at Tema, near Accra, and the existing port, at Takoradi, was expanded. An urgent programme to build and expand schools, from primary to teacher and trade training, was begun. From 1951 to 1956, the number of pupils being educated at the colony's schools rose from 200,000 to 500,000. Nevertheless, the number of graduates being produced was insufficient to the burgeoning civil service's needs, and in 1953, Nkrumah announced that though Africans would be given preference, the country would be relying on <b>expatriate</b> European <b>civil</b> <b>servants</b> for several years.|$|R

30|$|Another PTA {{strategy}} was to enrol municipal and regional cooperation body <b>civil</b> <b>servants</b> more directly. This meant that the PTA was mobilizing political resources via the <b>civil</b> <b>servants,</b> not directly from the politicians.

This group consists of <b>civil</b> <b>servants</b> from each municipality, the county council, the regional cooperation body and the PTA [35]. 3 In this group, the PTA informs the <b>civil</b> <b>servants</b> regarding current issues; some <b>civil</b> <b>servants</b> have a mandate to make decisions at the meeting, while others gather information and {{pass it on to}} their politicians before making any decisions [36].|$|R
30|$|In {{the case}} of {{secondary}} belief, ‘structure reform coalition group’ insisted the “Complete Structure Reform”.

Therefore, the 2015 reform should be the first step for terminating the <b>civil</b> <b>servant</b> pension. On the other sides, ‘parametric reform coalition group’ proclaimed the “Parametric Reform”.

Since the <b>civil</b> <b>servant</b> pension contributes to the stability of the lives of <b>civil</b> <b>servants,</b> transferring the <b>civil</b> <b>servant</b> pension into the public pension is the preposterous reform that does not consider the <b>civil</b> <b>servant’s</b> side.|$|R
