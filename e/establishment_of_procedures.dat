50|$|The {{history of}} {{software}} configuration management (SCM) in computing {{can be traced}} back as early as the 1950s, when CM (for Configuration Management), originally for hardware development and production control, was being applied to software development. Early software had a physical footprint, such as cards, tapes, and other media. The first software configuration management was a manual operation. With the advances in language and complexity, software engineering, involving configuration management and other methods, became a major concern due to issues like schedule, budget, and quality. Practical lessons, over the years, had led to the definition, and <b>establishment,</b> <b>of</b> <b>procedures</b> and tools. Eventually, the tools became systems to manage software changes. Industry-wide practices were offered as solutions, either in an open or proprietary manner (such as Revision Control System). With the growing use of computers, systems emerged that handled a broader scope, including requirements management, design alternatives, quality control, and more; later tools followed the guidelines of organizations, such as the Capability Maturity Model of the Software Engineering Institute.|$|E

The Secretary of State shall, within ninety days after the enactment of this section, establish orderly and expeditious procedures, including provision for necessary administrative actions and inter-agency memorandum of understanding, which are mutually agreeable to the Secretaries of Energy, Defense, and Commerce, the Director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for the preparation of the executive branch judgment on export applications under this section. Such procedures shall include, at a minimum, explicit direction on the handling of such applications, express deadlines for the solicitation and collection of the views of the consulted agencies (with identified officials responsible for meeting such deadlines), an inter-agency coordinating authority to monitor the processing of such applications, predetermined procedures for the expeditious handling of intra-agency and inter-agency disagreements and appeals to higher authorities, frequent meetings of inter-agency administrative coordinators to review the status of all pending applications, and similar administrative mechanisms. To the extent practicable, an applicant should be advised of all the information required of the applicant for the entire process for every agency's needs {{at the beginning of the}} process. Potentially controversial applications should be identified as quickly as possible so that any required policy decisions or diplomatic consultations can be initiated in a timely manner. An immediate effort should be undertaken to establish quickly any necessary standards and criteria, including the nature of any required assurances or evidentiary showings, for the decisions required under this section.

The Secretary shall notify the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the Committee on International Relations of the House of Representatives of any such authorization. In submitting any such judgment, the Secretary of State shall specifically address the extent to which the export criteria then in effect are met and the extent to which the cooperating party has adhered to the provisions of the applicable agreement for cooperation.

40|$|Spark plasma {{sintering}} (SPS), {{also called}} Field Assisted Sintering Technique (FAST), represents a novel {{method of preparation}} of sintered materials from powders. The main advantage of the SPS method is a high achievable heat rate (> 200 °C/min) and high sintering temperatures (up to 2200 °C in our laboratory). Combination of high heating rate, rather high pressures (up to 80 MPa) and electric field fluctuations leads to an effective sintering and significant reduction of sintering time for both coarse-grained and nanocrystalline powders.

The Registrar, required to reside within The Hague, was initially tasked with drawing up a plan to create an efficient Secretariat, using the smallest number of staff possible and costing as little as possible. As a result, he decided to have each member of the Secretariat as the head of a particular Department, so the numbers of actual employees could be increased or decreased as necessary without impacting on the actual Registry. In 1927, the post of Deputy-Registrar was created, tasked with dealing with legal research for the Court and answering all diplomatic correspondence received by the Registry.|$|R
40|$|By using rank-order statistics, it is {{possible}} to predict the likely scale of future "extreme" volcanic events (eruptions larger than a given threshold size, or repose periods longer than a given time) on both a local and global scale. When ranked by diminishing size, the largest and most devastating volcanic eruptions in terms of volume, or consequent fatalities, can be described by power-law functions. In turn, this approach permits projection of, for example, (1) the likely size of the next volcanic eruption larger than the A. D. 1815 eruption of Tambora (∼ 90 km 3 of magma); (2) the size of the next eruption of the Taupo volcano, New Zealand, that is larger than the eruption of A. D. 186 (∼ 82 km 3 of tephra); and (3) the likely duration of the current repose period of the Taupo volcano (4000 ± 1200 years). This approach can also be employed on shorter time scales, for example to provide quantitative criteria to assess when a period of activity has ceased. With the <b>establishment</b> <b>of</b> <b>procedures</b> for making projections such as these, volcano hazard assessment may be placed onto a more rigorous and quantitative basis...|$|E
40|$|Summary: Although the {{acquis communautaire}} {{relating}} to gender equality {{has largely been}} transposed in the Czech Republic, this {{does not necessarily mean}} that these rules are being fully implemented. Almost two years after accession to the EU, the equally important implementation phases - namely, application (<b>establishment</b> <b>of</b> <b>procedures</b> and administration of measures by the relevant authorities) and enforcement (monitoring by the relevant authorities and ensuring or compelling conformity) - are severely underdeveloped, and compliance by the private sector is at a low level. Little attention is paid to continuous policy evaluation, i. e. checking whether the adopted methods of application and enforcement are bringing about the desired results, or subsequent policy reform, i. e. learning from lessons drawn from the evaluation stage. 1 In this paper, the individual stages of implementation will be looked at in order to determine possible challenges to the effectiveness of equality law at the national level. Effectiveness here is understood, following Snyder, 2 as the fact that “law matters: it has effects on political, economic and social life outside the law - that is, apart from simply the elaboration of legal doctrine”...|$|E
40|$|An {{important}} {{challenge for}} the continued development of cell therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD) is the <b>establishment</b> <b>of</b> <b>procedures</b> that better standardize cell preparations for use in transplantation. Although cell sorting has been an anticipated strategy, its application has been limited by lack of knowledge regarding transmembrane proteins {{that can be used}} to target and isolate progenitors for midbrain dopamine (mDA) neurons. We used a "FACS-array" approach to identify 18 genes for transmembrane proteins with high expression in mDA progenitors and describe the utility of four of these targets (Alcam, Chl 1, Gfra 1, and Igsf 8) for isolating mDA progenitors from rat primary ventral mesencephalon through flow cytometry. Alcam and Chl 1 facilitated a significant enrichment of mDA neurons following transplantation, while targeting of Gfra 1 allowed for robust separation of dopamine and serotonin neurons. Importantly, we also show that mDA progenitors isolated on the basis of transmembrane proteins are capable of extensive, functional innervation of the host striatum and correction of motor impairment in a unilateral model of PD. These results are highly relevant for current efforts to establish safe and effective stem cell-based procedures for PD, where clinical translation will almost certainly require safety and standardization measures in order to deliver well-characterized cell preparations...|$|E
