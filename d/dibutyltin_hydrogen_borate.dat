40|$|A {{previously}} proposed model {{describing the}} trapping {{site of the}} interstitial atomic <b>hydrogen</b> in <b>borate</b> glasses is analyzed. In this model the atomic hydrogen is stabilized at the centers of oxygen polygons belonging to B-O ring structures in the glass network by van der Waals forces. The previously reported atomic hydrogen isothermal decay experimental data {{are discussed in the}} light of this microscopic model. A coupled differential equation system of the observed decay kinetics was solved numerically using the Runge Kutta method. The experimental untrapping activation energy of 0. 7 x 10 (- 19) J is in good agreement with the calculated results of dispersion interaction between the stabilized atomic hydrogen and the neighboring oxygen atoms at the vertices of hexagonal ring structures.

40|$|A kinetic {{spectrophotometric}} method for determination of lisinopril in pharmaceuticals has been developed. The method {{is based on}} activator action of lisinopril on Cu(II) ions catalysing the oxidation of nile blue A with <b>hydrogen</b> peroxide in <b>borate</b> buffer (pH 9. 3). A decrease of the absorbance was recorded at 635 nm for 5 min at 25 °C. The linearity was established applying the tangent method within the concentration range of lisinopril from 0. 8 - 6. 4 μg mL- 1, the detection and quantification limits being 0. 158 μg mL- 1 and 0. 480 μg mL- 1, respectively.

25|$|The {{reactivity}} of NaBH4 {{can be enhanced}} or augmented {{by a variety of}} compounds. Oxidation with iodine in tetrahydrofuran gives the borane–tetrahydrofuran complex, which can reduce carboxylic acids. Likewise, the NaBH4-MeOH system, formed by the addition of methanol to sodium borohydride in refluxing THF, reduces esters to the corresponding alcohols. Mixing water or an alcohol with the borohydride converts some of it into unstable hydride ester, which is more efficient at reduction, but the reductant will eventually decompose spontaneously to give <b>hydrogen</b> gas and <b>borates.</b> The same reaction can run also intramolecularly: an α-ketoester converts into a diol, since the alcohol produced will attack the borohydride to produce an ester of the borohydride, which then reduces the neighboring ester. The combination of NaBH4 with carboxylic acids results in the formation of acyloxyborohydride species. These can perform a variety of reductions not normally associated with borohydride chemistry, such as alcohols to hydrocarbons and nitriles to primary amines.|$|R
40|$|A new, {{sensitive}} and simple kinetic method {{has been developed}} for the determination of traces of Co(II) ions based on their catalytic effect in the oxidation of trisodium- 2 -hydroxy- 1 -(4 -sulphonato- 1 -naphthylazo) naphthalene- 6, 8 -disulphonate (red artificial color Ponceau 4 R) by <b>hydrogen</b> peroxide in <b>borate</b> buffer. The reaction was followed spectrophotometrically by tracing the oxidation product at 478. 4 nm within 1 min after the imitation of the reaction. The optimum reaction conditions are: borate buffer (pH = 10. 50), Ponceau 4 R (8 × 10 – 6 mol/dm 3), H 2 O 2 (3 × 10 – 2 mol/dm 3) at 22 ºC. Following this procedure, Co(II) can be determined with a linear calibration graph up to 1. 17 ng/cm 3 and a detection limit of 0. 20, based on the 3 s criterion. The relative error ranges between 4. 80 – 3. 25 % for the concentration interval of Co(II) ions 1. 76 – 17. 61 ng/cm 3.

40|$|We {{explore the}} {{possibility}} to directly measure pH and alkalinity in the sample with the same sensor by imposing an outward flux of hydrogen ions from an ion-selective membrane to the sample solution by an applied current. The membrane consists of a polypropylene-supported liquid membrane doped with a hydrogen ionophore (chromoionophore I), ion exchanger (KTFBP), and lipophilic electrolyte (ETH 500). While the sample pH is measured at zero current, alkalinity is assessed by chronopotentiometry at anodic current. Hydrogen ions expelled from the membrane undergo acid-base solution chemistry and protonate available base in the diffusion layer. With time, base species start to be depleted owing to the constant imposed hydrogen ion flux from the membrane, and a local pH change occurs at a transition time. This pH change (potential readout) is correlated to the concentration of the base in solution. As in traditional chronopotentiometry, the observed square root of transition time (τ) {{was found to be}} linear in the concentration range of 0. 1 mM to 1 mM, using the bases tris(hydroxymethyl) aminomethane, ammonia, carbonate, hydroxide, <b>hydrogen</b> phosphate, and <b>borate.</b> Numerical simulations were used to predict the concentration profiles and the chronopotentiograms, allowing the discussion of possible limitations of the proposed method and its comparison with volumetric titrations of alkalinity. Finally, the P-alkalinity level is measured in a river sample to demonstrate the analytical usefulness of the proposed method. As a result of these preliminary results, we believe that this approach may become useful for the in situ determination of P-alkalinity in a range of matrixes...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, the new photocatalyst, Pt x- /TiO 2 -y B y was {{prepared}} by impregnation method via coupling with a inorganic water splitting system, namely, a ternary system K +,Na + /B 4 O 7 2 - - H 2 O for hydrogen evolution. The integration {{process of the}} preparation for B doping Pt/TiO 2 with the significant photocatalytic hydrogen evolution in the ternary system K +,Mg 2 + /B 4 O 7 2 - - H 2 O and K +,Na + /B 4 O 7 2 - - H 2 O were accomplished by impregnation in situ. The photocatalyst Pt x- /TiO 2 -y B y synthesis and the photocatalytic hydrogen production of the isothermal solubility of the ternary system K +,Mg 2 + /B 4 O 7 2 - - H 2 O and K +,Na + /B 4 O 7 2 - - H 2 O at 25 ºC have been studied. Thus, the present challenge {{is not only to}} demonstrate a suitable photocatalytical system that can efficiently produce <b>hydrogen</b> under the <b>borate</b> exsited, but also research that the addition of borate to the suspensions greatly enhanced the stability of the  photocatalysts over semiconductor catalysts. The results show that borate solution is a suitable for B doped TiO 2 photocatalysts preparation and a novel photocatalyst Pt x- /TiO 2 -y B y was successfully prepared by this way. XRD and XPS characterization showed that both anatase and rutile are coexisted and the B is incorporated into the crystal of the TiO 2. So the TiO 2 can be denoted as TiO 2 -x B x. The effect of borate on the photocatalytic properties were investigated. The results showed that the amount of hydrogen evolved is enhanced by factors of 4 with the addition of H 3 BO 3 to the ethanol/water reaction solutions. The role of boron anion does not act as a sacrificial electron donors. DOI: [URL] </p...|$|R
30|$|Biologically derived and {{synthetic}} biodegradable polymers have attracted considerable attention {{for use as}} solid electrolytes in various fields [10, 11, 12]. Polymer electrolytes, such as polyethylene oxide-salt complexes, polyvinyl alcohol [13], chitosan [14], starch [15] and methyl cellulose [16] are prepared by doping of ionic salt to polymers. These {{are the most common}} SPEs employed in electrochemical devices, wherein ionic conductivity was reached up to 10 − 3  S cm− 1. Pradeep et al. [2] discussed the importance and stability of the naturally derived polymer as an electrolyte in electrochemical device. Hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC) is a very important cellulose derivative due to its good viscosimetric, emulsifying, stabilizing, dispersing, and agglutinant properties as well as its high solubility in several organic solvents and water and its ability to form films with desirable mechanical properties. These characteristics make HEC suitable for applications in ink, paper, food, pharmaceutical, cosmetic, ceramic, textile, and agricultural products [17] Machado et al. [18] studied HEC with different quantities of glycerol and lithium trifluoromethane sulfonate (LiCF 3 SO 3) salt, which showed ionic conductivity value of 1.07  ×  10 − 5  S cm− 1 at 30  °C. It is of great challenge to prepare proton conducting HEC since acid hydrolysis of intra- and inter-molecular hydrogen bonding takes place, thereby losing its film-forming properties. Moreover, HEC is crystalline in nature and addition of plasticizers, cross-linkers and different dopants certainly improves the ionic conducting and stability of polymer electrolyte. It is well known that borax (or sodium tetraborate, Na 2 B 4 O 7) is a good buffer and cross-linker. At lower concentrations, the borax totally dissociates into equivalent amount of boric acid and borate ion [19]. Usually borate ions and polymer molecules form complexes which induce electrostatic charges on the polymeric chains. The Na+ ions will have a shielding effect on the charges of polymer chains. [20]. In addition, the hydroxyl groups of HEC form <b>hydrogen</b> bonding with <b>borate</b> ions. Thus, stabilizing the polymer matrix and creating opportunity to add acid into the HEC system. H 3 PO 4 {{has proved to be a}} good proton conductor in poly(ethylenimine) [21], poly(vinyl alcohol) [22] and poly (silamine) [23] chitosan/iota-carrageenan [24]. The source of proton conduction can be obtained by self-ionization and self-dehydration of H 3 PO 4 [25]. H 3 PO 4 also acts as a plasticizer [26]. Addition of H 3 PO 4 may further induce esterification reaction with hydroxyl groups of HEC, but acid hydrolysis of β-glucoside bonds would be minimized in presence of borax.|$|R
