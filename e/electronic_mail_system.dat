A turning point was early 1992 when the Communications Aid project for the people in former Yugoslavia was launched by foreign peace groups together with the Center for the Culture of Peace and Nonviolence in Ljubljana, the Anti-War Campaign of Zagreb and the Center for Anti-war Action in Belgrade, with the objective of setting up an alternative <b>electronic</b> <b>mail</b> <b>system</b> (bulletin board system or BBS) that could work on poor quality telephone lines and simple computers, the only available ICT resources at that time in the war-stricken post-Yugoslav region.|$|E

40|$|<b>Electronic</b> <b>Mail</b> <b>Systems</b> (EMSs) {{have been}} a boon to {{organizational}} productivity, but these systems may not receive greater acceptance {{due in part to}} their general lack of robust system features.

This approach improves on prior Knowledge-Based <b>Mail</b> <b>System</b> (KMS) designs by (1) focusing on message dissemination management rather than on message receipt management, (2) separating the relatively static knowledge of message routing from the relatively dynamic knowledge of the organizational membership, and (3) incorporating a more comprehensive view of the semantic constraints involved in configuring distribution lists of message receivers through the use of the Structured Object Model (SOM) Methodology.
