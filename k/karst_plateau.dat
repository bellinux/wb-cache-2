25|$|The <b>Karst</b> <b>Plateau</b> in the Slovene Littoral {{gave its}} name to karst, a {{landscape}} shaped by water dissolving the carbonate bedrock, forming caves. The best-known caves are Postojna Cave and the UNESCO-listed Škocjan Caves. The region of Slovenian Istria meets the Adriatic Sea, where the most important historical monument is the Venetian Gothic Mediterranean town of Piran while the settlement of Portorož attracts crowds in summer.|$|E
25|$|During the Tertiary orogenic uplift, around 60 – 40 {{millions}} years ago, {{the area}} of today's Swiss Plateau was a <b>Karst</b> <b>plateau</b> somewhat inclined to the south. Through processes of rising and lowering that were brought by the folding of the Alps, the area was twice flooded by a sea. The corresponding sediments are distinguished as sea molasse and freshwater molasse, even though the latter consists rather of fluvial and eolian sediments (a kind of mainland molasse).|$|E
25|$|Beginning in 1915, the Italians under Cadorna mounted eleven offensives on the Isonzo front {{along the}} Isonzo (Soča) River, {{northeast}} of Trieste. All eleven offensives were repelled by the Austro-Hungarians, {{who held the}} higher ground. In the summer of 1916, after the Battle of Doberdò, the Italians captured the town of Gorizia. After this minor victory, the front remained static for over a year, despite several Italian offensives, centred on the Banjšice and <b>Karst</b> <b>Plateau</b> east of Gorizia.|$|E

Louisville's part of the valley is located between two plateaus, the <b>karst</b> <b>plateau</b> of Southern Indiana and the Bluegrass plateau of Kentucky, both with an elevation of around 900 feet. Elevations drop off the Indiana plateau very sharply via the Muldraugh Escarpment, whereas the rise in elevation up to the Bluegrass plateau is done more gradually.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, the World Conservation Union (IUCN) {{conducted}} a field survey in January and February.

This bureau stated that the site was part of an extremely complex and ancient <b>karst</b> <b>plateau</b> with high geodiversity which also encompasses Kẻ Bàng and Hin Namno karsts. The reserve is largely covered in tropical forest {{with a high level of}} biodiversity and endemic species. Lack of research means that the true significance of the biodiversity and geology of the area cannot be fully assessed. The evaluation bureau concluded that the nominated area on its own is not considered to meet World Heritage criteria. The Bureau decided to defer the nomination of Phong Nha Nature Reserve.|$|E
500|$|The 24th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS [...] "Karstjäger" [...] was a German {{mountain}} {{infantry division}} of the Waffen-SS, the armed wing of the German Nazi Party that served alongside, but was never formally part of, the Wehrmacht during World War II. Named Karstjäger, {{it was one of}} the 38 divisions fielded by the Waffen-SS. Formed on 18 July 1944 from the SS Volunteer Karstwehr Battalion, its nominal strength was never more than theoretical and the division was soon reduced to the Waffen Mountain (Karstjäger) Brigade of the SS. Throughout its existence as a battalion, division and brigade, it was primarily involved in fighting partisans in the <b>Karst</b> <b>Plateau</b> on the frontiers of Yugoslavia, Italy, and Austria; the mountainous terrain required specialised mountain troops and equipment.|$|E

Geomorphic processes and landforms of four case study areas of contact karst were researched in detail. Two types of contact karst were recognized: between non-carbonate and carbonate rocks and between different carbonate rocks. In the first case, ponors and blind valleys (active and fossil) were formed and concave forms near the contact are infilled with non-carbonate sediments. On the contact between different carbonate rocks (dolomite and limestone), the forms are similar but less evident, e. g. ponors (active and fossil), ponor steepheads and dry valleys...|$|R
500|$|The Lipizzan breed {{dates back}} to the 16th century, when it was {{developed}} {{with the support of the}} Habsburg nobility. The breed takes its name from one of the earliest stud farms established, located near the <b>Karst</b> <b>Plateau</b> village of Lipica (spelled [...] "Lipizza" [...] in Italian), in modern-day Slovenia. The breed has been endangered numerous times by warfare sweeping Europe, including during the War of the First Coalition, World War I and World War II. The rescue of the Lipizzans during World War II by American troops was made famous by the Disney movie Miracle of the White Stallions. Along with the Disney movie, Lipizzans have also starred or played supporting roles in many movies, TV shows, books and other media.|$|E

Linguist and phonologist Josip Ribarić (1880–1954), a native of Vodice in Ćićarija, disproved this thesis with historical documents, anthroponyms and language dialects in the karst. According to him, the term Ćići initially referred to the Romance-speaking Balkan population, the same as Morlachs (i.e. Vlachs) and became an exonym for all newcomers to the <b>karst</b> <b>plateau.</b>|$|E
40|$|The recent {{extension}} of intensive agriculture on the <b>karst</b> <b>plateaus</b> has caused {{different types of}} impact: soil management, generalised and/or localised pollution. Yet paradoxically rural depopulation can also have negative impacts, which largely depend on the characteristics and the hydrological function of the different karst environments. They are often negative, particularly {{as far as the}} water quality is concerned, which is why protection measures are undertaken, either in a defined area for a catchment, or in the framework of regional parks.

Precipitation reaches 5000 l per m², amounts typical for tropical rainforests or the eastern Himalayas than the dry Mediterranean. Lying at Europe's wettest coast, snow easily accumulates on karstic plateaux and as late as June small snow patches continue to lie in shaded places under the summits. Skiing is possible but no relevant infrastructures exist today. Orjen is a more important hiking destination. Three mountain huts provide basic accommodation.|$|R

There were defined zones with different degree of restriction of land use, agricultural activities and application of fertilisers and biocides. Arable lands has been gradually changed to meadows and pastures by introduction of grass since 1987 in the most strictly protected zone to protect especially subsurface karst forms...|$|R

The data were collected on permanent research plots etsablished in 1983 − 1985 on the Plešivská Plateau (part of the Slovak Karst National Park and Biosphere Reserve). Changes in mesic and dry grassland vegetation of permanent field plots were evaluated in the same way both times according to the Central European method. Due to cessation of non-forest vegetationmanagement the majority, permanent plots isgradually overgrownby woody plants.

These early transcriptions indicate that the name was originally *Obloke, probably derived from the prepositional phrase *ob(ь) lǫky or *ob(ь) lǫkaxъ 'next to the flood-meadow(s)'. Less likely theories connect the name to the meanings 'next to rough terrain' or 'arc, arch'.|$|R
