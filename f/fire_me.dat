500|$|The {{costs of}} filming Titanic {{eventually}} began to mount and finally reached $200million. Fox executives panicked and suggested {{an hour of}} specific cuts from the three-hour film. They argued the extended length would mean fewer showings, thus less revenue, even though long epics {{are more likely to}} help directors win Oscars. Cameron refused, telling Fox, [...] "You want to cut my movie? You're going to have to <b>fire</b> <b>me!</b> You want to <b>fire</b> <b>me?</b> You're going to have to kill me!" [...] The executives did not want to start over, because it would mean the loss of their entire investment, but they also initially rejected Cameron's offer of forfeiting his share of the profits as an empty gesture, as they predicted profits would be unlikely.|$|E
500|$|Beltran {{said that}} he was not aware {{of the effects of the}} {{interactions}} this was having with the crew, and described the situation, saying, [...] "for me it was like, 'OK, you can <b>fire</b> <b>me</b> if you want to. Go ahead, and I'll leave.'" [...] He compared his experience on Voyager to working in a car factory, and said that the repetitive scenes meant that it limited his creativity. Beltran explained that it did not affect his relationship with the other actors, and in the end, he felt the producers decided to keep him on the cast as it did not make [...] "very much difference, except to a very, very small percentage of fans who maybe didn't like what I said." ...|$|E
500|$|Kubrick began {{development}} on {{an adaptation of}} [...] "Super-Toys Last All Summer Long" [...] in the late 1970s, hiring the story's author, Brian Aldiss, to write a film treatment. In 1985, Kubrick asked Steven Spielberg to direct the film, with Kubrick producing. Warner Bros. agreed to co-finance A.I. and cover distribution duties. The film labored in development hell, and Aldiss was fired by Kubrick over creative differences in 1989. Bob Shaw served as writer very briefly, leaving after six weeks because of Kubrick's demanding work schedule, and Ian Watson was hired as the new writer in March 1990. Aldiss later remarked, [...] "Not only did the bastard <b>fire</b> <b>me,</b> he hired my enemy [...] instead." [...] Kubrick handed Watson The Adventures of Pinocchio for inspiration, calling A.I. [...] "a picaresque robot version of Pinocchio".|$|E
2500|$|On May 20, 2010, Kornheiser said on {{his radio}} show that in fact he was fired by the Washington Post, saying [...] "they <b>fired</b> <b>me</b> in a despicable way." [...] On September 11, 2013, Kornheiser {{repeated}} his account: [...] "Raju Narisetti <b>fired</b> <b>me</b> from the Washington Post and I hate his guts." ...|$|R

500|$|Beresford also clashed on {{set with}} Brimley. On {{the very first}} day of filming, he asked the actor to [...] "pick up the pace", {{prompting}} Brimley to reply, [...] "Hey, I didn't know anybody dropped it." [...] On another occasion, when Beresford tried to advise Brimley on how Harry would behave, Duvall recalled Brimley responding, [...] "Now look, let me tell you something, I'm Harry. Harry's not over there, Harry's not over here. Until you <b>fire</b> <b>me</b> or get another actor, I'm Harry, and whatever I do is fine 'cause I'm Harry." [...] Duvall said he believed the on-set wrangling resulted in a combination of the director's and actors' visions and ultimately improved the picture. Likewise, Beresford said he did not feel the fights negatively affected the film because he and Duvall never disagreed on the interpretation of the Mac Sledge character.|$|E
500|$|The {{script was}} given to Maurice Hurley to rewrite. He took six weeks for the rewrite, and his initial version was {{received}} poorly by TNG executives. Hurley later said, [...] "they absolutely hated it, I think they wanted to <b>fire</b> <b>me,</b> {{and they would have}} if I didn't have a guaranteed contract". He rewrote the script, and this version was filmed. Hurley was pleased with the result, saying that [...] "everything about that episode worked". The final version differed significantly from the original Reaves-Duane script; Duane later said that only two scenes remained: where Picard sees his mother, and where he nearly falls out of the turbolift into space. Reaves later said that the episode [...] "came together much better on the screen than we thought it would when we read the script. We were lucky, because it was out of our hands".|$|E

2500|$|Following the Julius LaRosa episode, singer-songwriter Ruth Wallis, {{renowned for}} her double-entendre songs, {{recorded}} [...] "Dear Mr. Godfrey," [...] a country tune that implored him to [...] "hire me and <b>fire</b> <b>me</b> {{and make a}} star of me." ...|$|E
2500|$|From 1974 onwards, Presley's {{weight gain}} and {{prescription}} drug abuse became {{too much to}} be controlled. In Las Vegas {{he was starting to}} appear drugged on stage, slurring his words and forgetting song lyrics. During one performance in September 1973, following news that one of the Hilton's staff that Presley was fond of had been fired, he attacked Barron Hilton in a verbal rage on stage. Parker was furious, and stormed into Presley's dressing room after the show to confront him. After a heated argument between the two, Presley told Parker he was fired. Angered by this outburst, Parker declared, [...] "You can't <b>fire</b> <b>me.</b> I quit!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Pelini's {{behavior}} was again {{called into question}} during Nebraska's nationally televised loss to the Iowa Hawkeyes {{at the end of}} the 2013 regular season. At halftime, the coach snapped at ESPN on ABC reporter Quint Kessenich when asked about a pair of Cornhusker turnovers, responding with [...] "What kind of question is that?" [...] Later, in disagreement with a call made on the field, Pelini swung his hat within inches of an official's face, drawing a 15-yard penalty for unsportsmanlike conduct. Pelini remained defiant in the post game press conference, referring to his personal foul call as [...] "chicken shit" [...] and declaring, [...] "If they want to <b>fire</b> <b>me,</b> go ahead…I don't apologize for anything I have done." [...] Pelini subsequently apologized for his behavior after the Iowa game.|$|E

5000|$|Housewright {{was born}} and raised in St. Paul, Minnesota. He is the son of Eugene Housewright, Sr., a businessman, and Patricia Langevin Housewright. He {{attended}} Cretin High School where he was editor of the school newspaper until he was fired for printing an editorial opposing the Vietnam War. “I attended an all-boys Catholic military school during the height of Vietnam war. Of course they <b>fired</b> <b>me.</b> You would have <b>fired</b> <b>me,</b> too,” Housewright told the Wild River Review. [...] He earned a degree in Journalism from the University of St. Thomas. He now lives with his wife, writer and theater critic Renee Marie Valois, in Roseville, MN.|$|R

2500|$|On March 27, 2010, {{approximately}} 500 Coffee Party meetings {{took place}} across the United States. Coffee Party co-founder Annabel Park participated {{in one of}} the meetings, which was covered by C-SPAN and was crowded, and she observed that not all of the participants were behaving in a civil manner. Newsweek reported, [...] "They were angry. They hated the Tea Party, and the Republican Party. They wanted to get even. One audience member said America was under the thumb of oligarchs and denounced 'moneyed interests.' A few people hissed when Sarah Palin's name was mentioned. Also on hand were the usual suspects drawn to the C-Span bat signal." [...] Some in the crowd even decided they wanted a new leader for the movement, [...] "not someone that says we can all work together." [...] Park said later, [...] "If they want to <b>fire</b> <b>me,</b> {{this may not be the}} group for them. We don't want conflict and confrontation." ...|$|E
2500|$|Joe {{was then}} {{announced}} as the teammate of Kevin Nash and Scott Hall in their match against the Angle Alliance at Turning Point. Hall, however, no-showed the event. Before the match, Joe {{was asked to}} cut a promo alleviating heat from the company and introducing Eric Young as Hall's replacement. Joe went five minutes overtime and ranted against Hall (whom he sarcastically referred to as [...] "The Phantom of the Impact Zone"), Nash and some other superstars, which legitimately upset Nash and TNA President Dixie Carter at ringside. Before calling Young {{to come to the}} ring he told the TNA ringside staff, [...] "Are you mad? Go ahead, <b>fire</b> <b>me,</b> I don't care". Joe, Nash and Young defeated the Angle Alliance when Joe pinned Tomko after a Muscle Buster. After the match, Joe and Nash briefly argued and shoved one another backstage, with Joe apologizing at a talent meeting the following day. On-screen, though, Joe continued to direct his frustration towards TNA management, going as far as to trash a Christmas party organized by Matt Morgan. In storyline, after complaining to Jim Cornette {{that he did not have}} a match at Final Resolution, Cornette decided to team Joe with Kevin Nash, who was to receive a title shot with Scott Hall when he returned. At Final Resolution, Joe, along with his tag team partner Kevin Nash lost to the team of A.J. Styles and Tomko. This occurred after Nash refused to tag himself into the match leaving Joe to fend for himself. In addition, Nash [...] "flipped off" [...] Joe whilst leaving the ringside area. After Nash had screwed Joe at Final Resolution, a furious Joe stormed to the backstage area on the hunt for Nash, only to find him welding a baseball bat for protection and refusing to fight Joe unless they got paid. Nash explained to Joe that he was teaching him a lesson about the wrestling business and told Joe he could help him to the top if he followed his direction. In good faith, Nash gave Joe the bat and implored to hit him if he was not satisfied with his explanation. Joe was still fuming, but let Nash go without incident. On the January 24 edition of Impact!, Joe went on a rampage, attacking several TNA employees, culminating in his attacking of Jeremy Borash after being announced as the MVP of 2007.|$|E
