25|$|Astronauts Wolf and Marshburn began EVA 2 at 15:27 UTC {{out of the}} Quest airlock. The EVA was to {{transfer}} the spare components brought by the shuttle from the ICC-VLD to External Stowage Platform-3. The spares were handled by Wolf riding the station's robotic arm to the P3 truss stowage platform where he and Marshburn attached them for long term storage. The purpose of the spares was to provide redundancy to the station in the period following the shuttle's retirement. The spares unloaded include a Ku-Band Space-to-Ground antenna, a pump module <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>coolant</b> system and a drive unit for the station's robotic arm's mobile transporter. A planned installation of a camera on the Japanese Experiment Facility was postponed to a future EVA for want of time. Meanwhile, the malfunctioning toilet was set right with the replacement of internal parts and cleared for normal use after tests.|$|E
25|$|The {{power plant}} is {{connected}} to the 330kV and 750kV electrical grid. The block has two electrical generators connected to the 750kV grid by a single generator transformer. The generators are connected to their common transformer by two switches in series. Between them, the unit transformers are connected to supply power to the power plant's own systems; each generator can therefore be connected to the unit transformer to power the plant, or to the unit transformer and the generator transformer to also feed power to the grid. The 330kV line is normally not used, and serves as an external power supply, connected by a station transformer to the power plant's electrical systems. The plant can be powered by its own generators, or get power from the 750kV grid through the generator transformer, or from the 330kV grid via the station transformer, or from the other power plant block via two reserve busbars. In case of total external power loss, the essential systems can be powered by diesel generators. Each unit transformer {{is connected to}} two 6kV main power boards, A and B (e.g. 7A, 7B, 8A, 8B for generators 7 and 8), powering principal non-essential drivers and connected to transformers for the 4kV main power and the 4kV reserve busbar. The 7A, 7B, and 8B boards are also connected to the three essential power lines (namely <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>coolant</b> pumps), each also having its own diesel generator. In case of a coolant circuit failure with simultaneous loss of external power, the essential power can be supplied by the spinning down turbogenerators for about 45â€“50 seconds, during which time the diesel generators should start up. The generators are started automatically within 15 seconds at loss of off-site power.|$|E

50|$|The S5G had {{primary coolant}} pumps, {{but they were}} only needed for very high speeds.

50|$|Other {{changes to}} the engine were related to ease of {{manufacture}} and improved reliability.

To perform this change, {{the front of the}} engine block was extended to include provisions <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>coolant</b> to flow through a cross over in the block. This extension also acted as an integrated timing chain housing. The timing chain housing was covered with flat steel that was easier to seal than the typical large timing chain cover used on other Ford V8s.

40|$|Water {{spray cooling}} is an {{important}} technology which is used in steel industries. The final mechanical properties of the steel are directly proportional to the quenching rate.

However, the achieved cooling rate is not sufficient <b>for</b> <b>the</b> metal which are used in some specific applications such as production of low weight and high strength steel which is used <b>for</b> <b>the</b> fabrication of light weight vehicle. Hence, the current process needs to be further enhanced. In the current case, experiments were conducted by using spray of different coolants such as pure water, salt added water surfactant added water, salt plus surfactant added water and sea water. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> above mentioned experiments an experimental set up was fabricated and <b>for</b> <b>the</b> calculation INTEMP software has been used. Initially, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>coolants,</b> <b>the</b> optimum height (40 mm) and the flow rate (16. 67 Ã— 10 - 5 m 3 /s) were determined. The experimental result of salt added spray cooling reveals that the quenching rate increases with increase in salt concentration up to 0. 4 M due to salt deposition effect which alter the heat transfer mechanism from convection mode to conductive mode.
