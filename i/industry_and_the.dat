5|$|Walker {{suggests}} that the TMI accident incited widespread criticism of nuclear power technology, the nuclear <b>industry,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> NRC. Critics faulted the <b>industry</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> NRC for their poor performance {{both before and after}} the accident. The international attention garnered by the crisis redoubled the determination of, and enhanced the credibility of, the anti-nuclear movement. Arguably, the United States nuclear industry has never recovered.|$|E

The parastatal is now expected to be privatised. Other than Cotton, Cattle and Gum Arabic are dominant.|$|E
5|$|Bonstelle's Playhouse {{was one of}} America's first civic theaters and, uniquely in the 1920s, a {{profitable}} one. Though it closed in 1933, a year after her death, due {{to the rise of}} the movie <b>industry</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Depression, Wayne State University bought the premises in 1956 for the use of its theater department, and in 1963 renamed it the Bonstelle Theatre in her memory. Bonstelle's approach gained nationwide attention and she was interviewed by authorities from other cities which wanted information about her plan. Her theater influenced the future Federal Theater Project.|$|E
