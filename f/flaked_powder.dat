40|$|A {{feasibility}} study for producing aluminum <b>flake</b> <b>powder</b> from aluminum foil scrap by dry ball milling under an inert argon {{with a few}} % of oxygen was carried out. It {{was found that the}} pieces of aluminum foil scrap were laminated to each other, elongated by micro-forging of the falling balls, fragmented into small pieces of foil and finally formed into <b>flake</b> <b>powder,</b> during the ball milling. A larger ball is more beneficial to the milling of aluminum foil into the <b>flake</b> <b>powder</b> due to the large impact energy during the falling of the ball. Intermediate stops during the ball milling produced a finer aluminum <b>flake</b> <b>powder</b> than non-stop milling for up to 25 h due to cooling of the vial. A larger amount of stearic acid reduces friction between the foil or the balls and vial wall, thus give less milling efficiency, 3 wt. % of stearic acid as additive being verified as the optimum content. The aluminum <b>flake</b> <b>powder</b> produced by the dry ball milling of aluminum foil scrap can be applied to fingerprint detection or to aerate light-weight concrete. # 2000 Elsevier Science S.

40|$|In {{the study}} a novel method for {{synthesis}} {{of a dark}} magnetic <b>flake</b> <b>powder</b> for detecting latent fingerprint has been developed. Even though, flake powders,of aluminium, brass and highly reflective magnetic iron flake are already in use in crime scenes, it is highly desirable to develop a suitable darker variety of magnetic <b>flake</b> <b>powder</b> for print development on light background surfaces. In order to achieve rapid production of dark metal flakes, a new high energy prototype vibratory mill has been designed, manufactured and develo ed. The design concepts were developed following {{a comprehensive review of}} the various commercially available milling devices and undertaking some initial experimentation. The mechanical milling process which results in changing the particle morphology of starting atomised iron powder to flaky shaped powder was investigated in terms of different milling phases like micro forging, fracture and agglomeration. The effect of milling process parameters on the flake quality was investigated. It was shown that the amount of stearic acid content, ball packing fraction and weight loading were important parameters in determining the final flake qualities. The quality of latent fingerprint development with the dark <b>flake</b> <b>powder</b> was investigated. Some of the <b>flake</b> <b>powders</b> produced excellent ridge quality details with good adherence quality on a range of background surfaces. The present study has been able to establish the relationship between the visual characteristics (dark) and adherence property of the <b>flake</b> fingerprint <b>powder</b> with respect to the particle dimensions and surface characteristics of the flakes. It was also found that finer flakes are darker in colour and the low weight percentage of stearic acid has produced the best adherence quality for the dark <b>flake</b> <b>powder.</b> Some unique relationship between the flake dimensions with the nature of the print deposit was also established as it was found that slightly coarser flakes are suitable for heavy print deposit whereas finer flakes are more sensitive to aged prints. Further, the role of process variables in influencing the milling process were established such that optimum conditions by vibration milling can be determined to obtain dark flakes of desired quality. While the weight loading significantly influenced the milling behaviour of the powder, the role of stearic acid as an additive was found to influence the surface quality of flakes, besides restricting particle welding. Increasing the pre determined theoretical ball size does not result in faster milling, but increasing the ball packing fraction from 50...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{investigate}} possible neurotoxic {{effects in}} groups of aluminium pot room and foundry workers, aluminium welders, and {{a small group of}} workers exposed to aluminium in the production of <b>flake</b> <b>powder.</b>  METHODS—Exposure to aluminium was evaluated with aluminium concentrations in blood and urine as well as a questionnaire. The groups exposed to aluminium were compared with a group of mild steel welders. Neurotoxic effects were studied with mood and symptom questionnaires and several psychological and neurophysiological tests.  RESULTS—The pot room and foundry workers showed very low aluminium uptake as their aluminium concentrations in blood and urine were close to normal, and no effects on the nervous system were detected. The group of workers exposed to <b>flake</b> <b>powder</b> had high concentrations of aluminium in blood and urine, even higher than those of the aluminium welders. However, aluminium could not be shown to affect the functioning of the nervous system in <b>flake</b> <b>powder</b> producers. Although significant effects could not be shown in the present analysis of the data on welders, the performance of the welders exposed to high concentrations of aluminium was affected according to the analyses in the original paper from this group.  CONCLUSIONS—For the pot room and foundry workers no effects related to the exposure to aluminium could be found. For the group of <b>flake</b> <b>powder</b> producers exposed for a short term no effects on the nervous systems were evident despite high levels of exposure. Due to the high concentrations of aluminium in the biological samples of this group, measures to reduce the exposure to aluminium are recommended, as effects on the central nervous system might develop after protracted exposures. However, this assumption needs to be verified in further studies.    Keywords: aluminium; workers; nervous syste...|$|R

40|$|The {{knowledge}} of {{the properties of the}} coatings in terms of scratch and wear resistance is of paramount importance in order to prevent the formation of severe damages. Nonetheless, dealing with the evaluation scratch or wear resistance of an organic coating can be troublesome. They can be strongly dependent on the status of the organic material {{as well as on the}} contact condition, applied load and strain rate. Besides, reliable responses cannot be achieved if an appropriate experimental design and a combined usage of proper equipments is not scheduled. In this respect, the present analysis deals with the application of variable speed and load scratch tests to characterize the scratch response and wear resistance of bilayer metal <b>flakes</b> <b>powder</b> coatings. Experimental findings allowed the achievement of consistent trends of the deformation response vs. curing temperature, scratch load and speed as well as their empirical modelling. This way, the overall scratch resistance of the bilayer coatings could be usefully predicted on a broad range of operational conditions, thus providing helpful indications to paint manufacturers and coaters on how to best deal with the application of metal <b>flake</b> <b>powders.</b> (C) 2008 Elsevier B.
