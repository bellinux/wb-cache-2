50|$|The Press Committee drew up {{what appears}} to be the first {{comprehensive}} outline for Press operations in 1946. Budget appropriations, approval of manuscripts, qualifications of Press personnel, operating procedures, and an editorial program were all covered. The Committee and Press activities would be overseen by two executives: the Editor of Publications and the Press Manager. The Editor of Publications would build the list of the Press through acquisitions and the Press Manager would be responsible for the printing, marketing, and sales aspects. The editorial program at this time recognized that the Press would publish two kinds of materials: scholarly works that would be included in the Publications Series and other books. The Publications Series would be fully subsidized by the university, and others would be partially subsidized or published at the Press’s own financial risk. Toward the end of the 1947-48 fiscal year, then-president of the university, Tom Popejoy, drew up business guidelines for UNMP. A <b>deficit</b> <b>subsidy</b> of $15,000 annually would be the university’s maximum support and the Press was told to strive for increased sales and self-sufficiency.|$|E

They directly increase fiscal <b>deficits.</b> <b>Subsidies</b> may also indirectly affect the budget adversely by drawing resources away from tax-yielding sectors towards sectors that may have a low tax-revenue potential.|$|R

40|$|With the 19 th century drain, no one {{was certain}} if the benefit {{exceeded}} the cost and since the rulers were foreign the suspicion was that any investment they made was not beneficial. But the lesson for the 21 st century is clear. Any drain internal or external should be minimised if not eliminated. A nation where even after nearly six decades of independence {{a quarter of the}} population is poor cannot afford to waste resources. The internal drain has to be cut. This means budget deficits and for that purpose subsidies which are all regressive. But its also means eliminating the hoards and harnessing them for development. colonial drain, hoarding, 21 st century Indian economy, 19 th century India, budget <b>deficits,</b> <b>subsidies,</b> Indian Economy, Economics...|$|R
50|$|An {{economic}} reform plan {{was announced in}} 1989 and began implementing a 3-year economic restructuring program designed to reduce the public sector <b>deficit,</b> end <b>subsidies,</b> privatize state enterprises, and encourage new foreign and domestic investment. In 1993, the IMF suspended Sudan’s voting rights and the World Bank suspended Sudan’s right to make withdrawals under effective and fully disbursed loans and credits. Lome Funds and EU agricultural credits, totaling more than one billion euros, also were suspended.|$|R

Based on the flow-of-funds approach, we estimate the magnitude of the quasi-fiscal deficits and the incidence of quasi-fiscal subsidies in Armenia, as well as identify main recipients and donors of quasi-fiscal financing. The main finding of the paper is that, while quasi-fiscal deficits in Armenia remain considerable, their recent decline has been the main source of fiscal adjustment in Armenia to date. The paper also shows that the population remains a major ultimate recipient of quasi-fiscal subsidies. Thus, the main distortive impact of quasi-fiscal subsidies is on social policy, not on enterprise restructuring and private sector performance. ...|$|R
25|$|The TTC has {{recovered}} about 70% of its operating costs from the fare box in recent years. From its creation in 1921 until 1971, the TTC was self-supporting both for capital and operations (it {{even had to}} pay property taxes until 1967). Through the Great Depression and World War II, it accumulated reserves that allowed it to expand considerably after the war, both with subways and major steady growth of its bus services into the suburbs. It was not until 1971 that the Metro government and the province started to provide operational subsidies, required primarily due to rising costs of delivering transit to low-density suburbs in Metro Toronto and large wage increases. <b>Deficits</b> and <b>subsidies</b> soared throughout the 1970s and 1980s, followed by service cuts and a period of ridership decline in the 1990s, partly attributable to recession.|$|R

40|$|A decade {{into the}} transition, {{many of the}} {{successor}} states of the former Soviet Union (FSU) continue to use energy sector quasi-fiscal activities (QFAs), especially low energy prices and the toleration of payment arrears, to provide large implicit and untargeted subsidies. These activities disguise the overall size of the government, cause overconsumption and waste, and contribute to macroeconomic imbalances. This paper analyses such activities in FSU countries, with particular emphasis on two case studies (Azerbaijan and Ukraine). The paper''s policy conclusions point {{to the need to}} increase energy prices, combined with a strengthening of safety nets to protect the poor, better enforcement of payment discipline, and more efforts to achieve fiscal transparency.

40|$|Due to {{the steady}} {{increase}} {{in the use of}} private autos in Japan, the bus business is facing hard times. In particular, bus services owned by public organizations have been struggling with increases in operating <b>deficits</b> and <b>subsidies,</b> so that recently in many cities there has been a call for restructuring. Publicly and privately owned bus operators co-exist in the Japanese market. Although their financial situation is not completely healthy, privately owned bus operators have performed better than their publicly owned counterparts. The main {{purpose of this study is}} to find the key factors causing the differences in efficiency between private and public bus operators, especially in these areas: efficiency in service production, wage, utilization of vehicles, and cost. In this study, we will make an analysis using observations of both private and public bus operators in the Kansai region in Japan for the five years from 1996 to 2000. After we examine the performance differences between the two sectors, we will estimate with econometric methods certain functions such as the production function of bus services and the wage function. Based on these functions, we will evaluate the differences in efficiency between private and public bus operators. ...|$|R

50|$|On December 29, 2010, the {{directory}} of Empresa Nacional del Petróleo (ENAP, National Petroleum Company) faced with high <b>deficits</b> due to <b>subsidies</b> provided to XII Region (Magallanes and Antártica Chilena) gas customers, proposed {{to increase the}} price of the natural gas by 16.8% in the region, located in the southern extreme of Chile, where everything requires gas heating because of the extreme climate. The apparent increase in the price was actually the result of a reduction of the heavily subsidised pricing for natural gas for users in this region. ENAP provides subsidies of approximately 80 percent of the delivered cost of gas in this region. As a result, users receive extremely low-cost natural gas, while residential users of natural gas in the Santiago region pay extremely high prices for the same commodity.|$|R
40|$|A {{workshop}} {{paper on}} economic structural adjustment in Zimbabwe. The post-independence era in Zimbabwe saw {{the expansion of}} social services, such as Health and Education, {{in an attempt to}} correct the historical imbalance of services available to the indigenous population. This meant that investment was disproportionately allocated to the social services. The end result of this was that inadequate investment in the productive sector could not create economic growth matching our population growth. Many “O” level certificate-holding students were produced, who, unfortunately, could not be absorbed by the stagnant, if not shrinking, economy. The inherited controlled economy which was characterized by foreign exchange controls, price controls, controlled employment practices, controlled parastatals, and unresponsive investment practices was given a new lease of life under our new socialist ideology which espoused a command economy. The combined efforts of these developments were a lack of growth in the economy, inadequate investment, high and unsustainable budget <b>deficits,</b> and increasing <b>subsidies.</b> These economic circumstances led to high unemployment and lower standards of living. The effects of intermittent drought and the poor commodity prices on the international market during the 1980 s helped to accelerate conditions of poverty.
