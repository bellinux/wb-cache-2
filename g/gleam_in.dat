500|$|.....here is none {{today who}} can replace the noble personality, that keen {{energetic}} brain ever {{ready to give}} of its wonderful store of knowledge, and that happy spirit ever bright, ever optimistic, even though crushed beneath the cruel and unjust blow of the non-acceptance of his prize design for the North Shore bridge. [...] "It will crown my life" [...] he said. We will always remember the bright <b>gleam</b> <b>in</b> his eyes as they peered beyond the anxiety of today, looked afar to the future glory of his beloved Sydney where in his dreams he saw his mighty bridge spanning what he called [...] "God's noblest waterway".|$|E
500|$|Eidelman {{stated that}} he finds science fiction the most {{interesting}} and exciting genre to compose for, and that Meyer told him to treat the film as a fresh start, rather than drawing on old Star Trek themes. Eidelman wanted the music to aid the visuals; for Rura Penthe, he strove to create an atmosphere that reflected the alien and dangerous setting, introducing exotic instruments for color. Besides using percussion from around the world, Eidelman treated the choir as percussion, with the Klingon language translation for [...] "to be, or not to be" [...] ("taH pagh, taHbe") being repeated in the background. Spock's theme {{was designed to be}} an ethereal counterpart to the motif for Kirk and the Enterprise, aimed at capturing [...] "the emotional <b>gleam</b> <b>in</b> the captain's eye". Kirk's internal dilemma about what the future holds was echoed in the main theme: [...] "It's Kirk taking control one last time and as he looks out into the stars he has the spark again [...] But there's an unresolved note, because it's very important that he doesn't trust the Klingons. He doesn't want to go on this trip even though the spark is there that overtook him." [...] For the climactic battle, Eidelman starts the music quietly, building the intensity as the battle progresses.|$|E

500|$|Alexis Petridis from The Guardian {{listed the}} song as the weakest effort on MDNA, adding that [...] "its {{position}} as the album's lead single {{seems to have had}} more to do with showing off the presence of Nicki Minaj and M.I.A. than its featherweight melody." [...] A writer for Virgin Media gave the song three out of five stars, writing: [...] "Like most Madonna singles, it skips along at a furious pace with a <b>gleam</b> <b>in</b> its eye, but the self-references get tiresome and ultimately she is just trying too hard." [...] Nick Levine, writing for The National, relegated the track as a [...] "lighter pop morsel". Matthew Parpetua from Pitchfork Media panned the song, saying that Solveig's production on the track was paired with equally [...] "bland lyrics". Brad O'Mancey from Popjustice declared that the track was [...] "proof that sometimes you can listen to something many, many times and still not have any idea whether it's any good or not." [...] Chicago Tribune journalist Greg Kot was disappointed with the song and its lyrics, which he found to be meaningless, while Bernard Zuel of The Sydney Morning Herald relegated it as [...] "trite and disposable". Alex Macpherson from Fact found the song to be [...] "sheer misconceived awfulness".|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} re-released in a 40th anniversary edition on 31 October 2011. The release {{contains}} a new stereo and 5.1 surround remix {{of the album}} by British musician and producer Steven Wilson, and comes in two different editions—a [...] "collector's edition" [...] containing the album on LP and two CDs, as well as DVD and Blu-ray discs and a hardback book; and a [...] "special edition" [...] containing the two CDs and an abridged version of the book. Justifying the remix, Steven Wilson said: [...] "Jethro Tull's Aqualung is... a masterpiece, but was sonically a very poor-sounding record. So, some didn't rate it as highly as they should have. What we did with Aqualung was really make that record <b>gleam</b> <b>in</b> a way it never gleamed before. I {{think a lot of}} people, including myself, have come around to thinking that the album is a lot better than they even gave it credit for previously. So, there is certainly something very gratifying about being able to polish what was already a diamond and making it shine in a way it never has before". Additionally, according to mastering engineer Steve Hoffman there were tape stretching problems with the original session mixdown master, implying that many editions of the album used multigeneration copies as their source.|$|E
500|$|An {{officer in}} one of the 38th Division's {{infantry}} battalions, who met Cubitt in early June, shortly after he took command, described him as [...] "a very large and fierce-looking major-general, with two rows of ribbons, and a <b>gleam</b> <b>in</b> his eye", who proceeded to interrogate a subaltern about the exact type and position of his unit's trench latrines, apparently something of a pet topic. A [...] "fire-eater with a marvellous flow of language", it was Cubitt's manner of speech, more than anything else, which made an impact on his contemporaries; a front-line officer in 1918 described watching him, during the October offensive, clearing a traffic jam with merely [...] "a magnificent gush of language". A colleague from his early days in the artillery described him as a [...] "perpetual joy to the soldier's world ... because of his picturesque language, which never gave offence because it was so absolutely natural and so aptly fitted the occasion", but under some circumstances it proved less suitable. Following a failed raid in 1918, he visited the offending battalion and harangued the officers collectively for some time, before demanding that they [...] "damn well had to do the raid over again, and damn well see that [...] made a proper job of it, or, by God, damn well go on raiding until [...] damn well did." [...] To the officers on the receiving end, already tired and dissatisfied, this was seen as a [...] "contemptible exhibition" [...] for a senior officer to make.|$|E

500|$|Producers {{identified}} {{the scene in}} which Elsa sings [...] "Let It Go" [...] as a pivotal point in the character's development. The scene depicts her choice to [...] "let go" [...] of her fear of using her powers. Character design supervisor Bill Schwab said, [...] "Before 'Let It Go', Elsa is really buttoned up, her hair is up—everything is perfect. During the song, she gives herself permission to be who she is and everything changes—her hair is more wild, her gown is magical. She's finally free—even if she is all alone." [...] Animators designed Elsa's appearance to reflect her metamorphosis; in the beginning, she is shown primarily in restrictive and confining outfits. Menzel said that, after accepting her abilities, Elsa's appearance becomes [...] "very vampy", continuing, [...] "She's quite sexy for Disney, I have to say—they're pushing the limits there a little bit! But there's a <b>gleam</b> <b>in</b> her eye and a supermodel walk {{that goes with it}} and, for me, it was fun to be a blonde because I'm not in real life." [...] In a January 2014 interview with John August and Aline Brosh McKenna, Lee disclosed that Lasseter personally helped with conceptualizing Elsa's physical transformation: [...] "y favorite thing about it ... is the actual model for doing it was John Lasseter .... he was a huge help in talking through how we translate that emotional journey ... with the animation ... e got up and he’s like, .... 'her hair goes, and she transforms, and she struts,' and he’s doing it. He’s acting it out." ...|$|E
2500|$|The album {{received}} uniformly positive {{reviews from}} Rolling Stone, the Chicago Tribune, and The Guardian. At a record release {{party for the}} album in January 2012, Cohen spoke with The New York Times reporter Jon Pareles who states that [...] "mortality was very much on his mind and in his songs [...]" [...] Pareles goes to characterize the album as [...] "an autumnal album, musing on memories and final reckonings, {{but it also has}} a <b>gleam</b> <b>in</b> its eye. It grapples once again with topics Mr. Cohen has pondered throughout his career: love, desire, faith, betrayal, redemption. Some of the diction is biblical; some is drily sardonic." ...|$|E
2500|$|GameSpy's Patrick Joynt's main {{criticism}} {{concerned the}} lack of character development: [...] "Rogue Galaxy looks great and is technically stunning. It's packed utterly full of the standbys of the genre - combat, exploration, personalization, and sub-games that are too huge to be called [...] "mini-games" [...] - which are all executed well, but [...] the characters themselves seem entirely secondary to the matter at hand [...] they're as engaging as cardboard cutouts, largely because they're so predictable." [...] However, he praised the range of mini-games and side-quests, and the overall size of the game. He concluded, [...] "Rogue Galaxys greatest triumph, the brightest <b>gleam</b> <b>in</b> its eye, is that at sixty hours of play I've got another sixty I could easily pour in." ...|$|E

2500|$|Construction {{began in}} 2005. During that time Zhu and the {{builders}} {{were to take}} advantage of two newly developed materials. The first, a translucent fiber reinforced plastic, had first been developed for a hotel Zhu was building elsewhere in Beijing as a substitute for jade, which proved too expensive to use in the quantity he had wanted it. Since it held images projected in it well, he also decided to use it for the flooring inside Digital Beijing, where it could become a [...] "digital carpet", similar to the [...] "urban carpet" [...] Zaha Hadid created for the Rosenthal Center for Contemporary Art in Cincinnati, Ohio. It was also strong enough to support the interior footbridges, so Zhu used it there too. On the exterior, a local maker of beverage cans developed the aluminum sheets for the building's facades that <b>gleam</b> <b>in</b> places yet still look like stone from far away.|$|E
