50|$|N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors are {{amino acid}} receptors, {{overstimulation}} to {{which lead to}} increased intracellular Ca2+ level, and become deleterious to neural cell. In ischaemic or hypoxic conditions such as stroke, the concentration of glutamate in synaptic clefts is increased, and continuously stimulates NMDA receptors. <b>Gavestinel</b> was synthesized by substituting indole-2-carboxylate at the C-3 position with an unsaturated lateral side chain. It binds to NMDA receptor on the glycine site with high affinity, selectivity and a broad time window efficacy, thus gains interests in testing its efficacy in treating stroke. In pre-clinical studies, <b>gavestinel</b> showed no significant side effects on memory, learning, and cardiovascular system, side effects that are very common in NMDA antagonists.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <b>Gavestinel,</b> GV 150526, is a {{selective}} antagonist at the glycine {{site of the}} N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor. The safety and efficacy of GV 150526 were studied in two phase III randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials of acute ischemic stroke patients within 6 h from onset [The Glycine Antagonist in Neuroprotection (GAIN) International and GAIN Americas Trials]. A planned MRI substudy within these trials investigated the effect of <b>gavestinel</b> on infarct volume. METHODS: Patients enrolled in the GAIN trials at designated MRI substudy sites were eligible {{if they had a}} pretreatment acute cortical lesion on diffusion-weighted MRI of at least 1. 5 cm diameter or 5 cm(3). Final lesion assessment was performed on T(2) -weighted MRI at month 3. Blinded image analysis was performed centrally. The primary hypothesis was that <b>gavestinel</b> would attenuate lesion growth from baseline relative to placebo. RESULTS: A total of 106 patients were eligible, 75 (34 <b>gavestinel,</b> 41 placebo) of whom had month 3 scans (primary analysis population). No effects of <b>gavestinel</b> on infarct volume were observed in the primary or other analyses. However, significant associations of lesion volume to clinical severity and outcomes were observed. Ischemic lesion volume decrease was predictive of substantial clinical improvement. CONCLUSION: Consistent with the clinical outcomes in the GAIN trials, no effects of <b>gavestinel</b> on ischemic infarction was observed. Concordance of results of the clinical outcome trials with those of this infarct volume substudy as well the associations of infarct volume to clinical outcomes further support the potential role of infarct volume as a marker of outcome in dose finding and proof of principle acute stroke trials...|$|E
40|$|Background and Purpose: Glycine Antagonist in Neuroprotection (GAIN) International and GAIN Americas {{trials were}} prospectively designed, randomized, {{placebo-controlled}} trials of <b>gavestinel,</b> a glycine-site antagonist and putative neuroprotectant drug administered within 6 hours of suspected ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke. Both trials reported that <b>gavestinel</b> was ineffective in ischemic stroke. This analysis reports {{the results in}} those with primary intracerebral hemorrhage. Methods: The primary hypothesis was that <b>gavestinel</b> treatment did not alter outcome, measured at 3 months by the Barthel Index (BI), from acute intracerebral hemorrhage, based on pooled results from both trials. The BI scores were divided into 3 groups: 95 to 100 (independent), 60 to 90 (assisted independence), and 0 to 55 (dependent) or dead. Results: In total, 3450 patients were randomized in GAIN International (N= 1804) and GAIN Americas (N= 1646). Of these, 571 were ultimately identified to have spontaneous intracerebral hematoma on baseline head computerized tomography scan. The difference in distribution of trichotomized BI scores at 3 months between <b>gavestinel</b> and placebo {{was not statistically significant}} (P= 0. 09). Serious adverse events were reported at similar rates in the 2 treatment groups. Conclusions: These observations from the combined GAIN International and GAIN Americas trials suggest that <b>gavestinel</b> is not of substantial benefit or harm to patients with primary intracerebral hemorrhage. These findings are similar to results previously reported in patients with ischemic stroke. </p...|$|E
40|$|It {{has long}} been {{accepted}} that high concentrations of glutamate can destroy neurons, {{and this is the}} basis of the theory of excitotoxicity during brain injury such as stroke. Glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists such as Selfotel, Aptiganel, <b>Gavestinel</b> and others failed to show neuroprotective efficacy in human clinical trials or produced intolerable central nervous system adverse effects. The failure of these agents has been attributed to poor studies in animal models and to poorly designed clinical trials. We also speculate that NMDA receptor antagonism may have hindered endogenous mechanisms for neuronal survival and neuroregeneration. It remains to be proven in human stroke whether NMDA receptor antagonism can be neuroprotective...|$|E
40|$|Background: It is {{controversial}} which component of blood pressure (BP) during acute period of stroke best predicts outcome. We hypothesized that elevated pulse pressure (PP), {{the difference between}} systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP), is independently associated with poor stroke outcome at 3 months. Methods: We analyzed both treatment groups from the Glycine Antagonist (<b>Gavestinel)</b> in Neuroprotection (GAIN) International trial (1455 ischemic stroke cases of mostly moderate severity). Cox proportional hazards and logistic regression modeling corrected for demography, medical history, heart rate, stroke severity, and clinical subtype. Results: Elevated weighted average PP during the first 60 hours was associated with poor outcome by mortality, Barthel index, National Institutes of Health Stroke Score (NIHSS) and Rankin scores. Elevated baseline PP was associated with Barthel index and Rankin score. Conclusion: Elevated PP is associated with poor stroke outcome at 3 months. </p...|$|E
40|$|While {{planning}} the GAIN International Study of <b>gavestinel</b> in acute stroke, a sequential triangular test was proposed but not implemented. Before the trial commenced {{it was agreed}} to evaluate the sequential design retrospectively to evaluate {{the differences in the}} resulting analyses, trial durations and sample sizes in order to assess the potential of sequential procedures for future stroke trials. This paper presents four sequential reconstructions of the GAIN study made under various scenarios. For the data as observed, the sequential design would have reduced the trial sample size by 234 patients and shortened its duration by 3 or 4 months. Had the study not achieved a recruitment rate that far exceeded expectation, the advantages of the sequential design would have been much greater. Sequential designs appear to be an attractive option for trials in stroke. Copyright 2004 S. Karger AG, Base...|$|E
40|$|Background and Purpose: Improvement in the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) 24 {{hours after}} stroke has been {{associated}} with subsequent neurological deterioration. We hypothesized that a similar association would be apparent for events occurring after 7 days, when acute changes from edema and herniation are less common. We evaluated the degree of NIHSS improvement at 7 days (recovery) as a predictor of subsequent neurological deterioration from day 7 to day 90. Methods: We studied all patients of the Glycine Antagonist (<b>gavestinel)</b> In Neuroprotection (GAIN) International Trial with ischemic stroke alive at day 7, excluding patients with hemorrhagic events and deaths from nonstroke-related causes. The GAIN International Trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, and parallel-group trial; because the study drug had no effect on stroke outcome, treatment groups were combined for this analysis. Neurological deterioration was assessed by the combined measure, including: (1) stroke-related events recorded as “serious adverse events,” (2) recurrent stroke recorded on a separate case report form, and (3) any NIHSS worsening. Results: Among 1187 patients included, 25...|$|E
40|$|Background and Purpose: Outcome in {{patients}} hospitalized for acute stroke varies considerably between populations. Within {{the framework of}} the GAIN International trial, a large multicenter trial of a neuroprotective agent (<b>gavestinel,</b> glycine antagonist), stroke outcome in relation to health care resource use has been compared in a large number of countries, allowing for differences in case mix. Methods: This substudy includes 1, 422 patients in 19 countries grouped into 10 regions. Data on prognostic variables on admission to hospital, resource use, and outcome were analyzed by regression models. Results: All results were adjusted for differences in prognostic factors on admission (NIH Stroke Scale, age, comorbidity). There were threefold variations in the average number of days in hospital/institutional care (from 20 to 60 days). The proportion of patients who met with professional rehabilitation staff also varied greatly. Three-month case fatality ranged from 11 % to 28 %, and mean Barthel ADL score at three months varied between 64 and 73. There was no relationship between health care resource use and outcome in terms of survival and ADL function at three months. The proportion of patients living at home at three months did not show any relationship to ADL function across countries. Conclusions: There are wide variations in health care resource use between countries, unexplained by differences in case mix. Across countries, there is no obvious relationship between resource use and clinical outcome after stroke.
