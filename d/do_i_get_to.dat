2500|$|Sparks {{are best}} known for the songs [...] "This Town Ain't Big Enough for Both of Us", which reached No. 2 on the UK Singles Chart in 1974; the disco hit [...] "The Number One Song in Heaven" [...] in 1979; [...] "When I'm With You" [...] which topped the French Singles Chart in 1980; the single [...] "I Predict", which {{provided}} Sparks' first appearance on the Billboard Hot 100, reaching No. 60 in May 1982; the 1983 single [...] "Cool Places" [...] with the Go-Go's rhythm guitarist and backing vocalist Jane Wiedlin, and [...] "When <b>Do</b> <b>I</b> <b>Get</b> <b>to</b> Sing 'My Way'" [...] which topped the German and European charts in 1994/95 and was the top airplay record in Germany for 1994.|$|E
2500|$|Filming {{the scene}} in which DS Miller confronts her murderous husband {{required}} some special care. The scene had been suggested by Olivia Colman. During her first meeting with Chibnall and Featherstone to discuss her character, she asked, [...] "I just want to know, do we get him [...] and <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> kick him in the balls?" [...] Although no such scene had been written, they assured her it would be included (assuming Ellie Miller was not the murderer). Actors Olivia Colman and Matthew Gravelle were kept apart before the scene was filmed {{as a means of}} heightening the tension between the two during their meeting. The scene called for Colman to attack Gravelle, who would fall to the ground and allow Colman to kick him in the back. Gravelle's back was fitted with safety padding, but Colman's performance was so intense that she kicked him too hard and Gravelle was bruised for three weeks.|$|E
2500|$|Andrew first {{appears in}} the [...] "Pilot" [...] of season one. His first {{speaking}} role is arguing with his mother, Bree, over her desire for perfection. He is attached to his father, Rex, and is upset when Bree tries to cover up their impending divorce.

Andrew repeatedly breaks the rules during Season 1, infuriating Bree, who eventually humiliates him by turning up at the strip club he is visiting with his friends while grounded. Bree does later apologize to Andrew (who also admits how much he misses his father) for lying to him, but removes the door to his room in punishment for him smoking marijuana.|$|E

2500|$|... 2014 {{marked the}} 40th Anniversary of Sparks' {{most popular and}} most {{influential}} album, Kimono My House. They performed the album in its entirety at the Barbican Centre in London on 19 and 20 December. The album was performed with the 35-piece Heritage Orchestra. The show included a second half consisting of songs from Sparks' entire career, that were also orchestrated for the show. The first night sold out within the first few hours. On the second night, they announced that they had completed the recording of their new album. Ron and Russell took the Kimono My House celebrations to Los Angeles as they performed the album on two consecutive nights with a 38-piece orchestra at the United Artists Theatre at Ace Hotel Los Angeles on Valentine's Day 14 February and on 15 February 2015. The orchestra was conducted by Suzie Katayama. Both shows sold out and they received glowing reviews. Alex Kapranos of Franz Ferdinand joined them on stage for duet with Russell on the song [...] "When <b>Do</b> <b>I</b> <b>Get</b> <b>To</b> Sing 'My Way'" [...] on both nights {{and it was then}} announced that Sparks and FF had joined forces to form a new, then yet-to-be-revealed band and to record an album.|$|E
2500|$|In 2012 Ron and Russell {{collaborated with}} singer Gemma Ray who {{released}} a limited 12-inch single titled [...] "Gemma Ray Sings Sparks (with Sparks)," [...] which included Ray's covers of Sparks' [...] "How <b>Do</b> <b>I</b> <b>Get</b> <b>To</b> Carnegie Hall" [...] and [...] "Eaten by the Monster of Love." [...] Though the songs were covers sung by Ray, they were arranged and {{produced by the}} Maels. In October, Ron and Russell performed {{for the first time}} ever as a duo, with no band. The 18-city European tour titled [...] "Two Hands One Mouth" [...] began in Lithuania and followed in Latvia, Finland, Norway, Sweden, Germany, Belgium, the UK and Ireland. The final UK concert of the tour was at the sold-out Barbican Centre in London. The tour then took the group to Japan with concerts in Tokyo and Osaka in January 2013. In April 2013, the show was presented for the first time in the US with two performances at the Coachella Festival. A short US tour with shows in New York City, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Portland, Seattle, and Philadelphia followed. In May 2013 Ron and Russell played the show in Paris, France, which coincided with their visit to the Cannes Film Festival. In Paris they were joined on stage by Catherine Ringer from Les Rita Mitsouko to sing on their 1989 collaboration [...] "Singing in The Shower." ...|$|E
60|$|With such mixed {{feelings}} I went away. Leaving love behind is always terrible, {{but it was}} not all love that I left, and there was relief in the state of mind with which I threw myself on the sofa at Dieppe--yes, indeed. Robert felt differently from me for once, as was natural, for it had been pure joy to him with his family and his friends, and I do believe he would have been capable of never leaving England again, had such an arrangement been practicable for us on some accounts. Oh England! I love and hate it at once. Or rather, where love of country ought to be in the heart, there is the mark of the burning iron in mine, and the depth of the scar shows the depth of the root of it. Well, I am writing you an amusing letter to-day, I think. After all, I wasn't made to live in England, or I should not cough there perpetually; while no sooner <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> Paris than the cough vanishes--it is all but gone now. The lightness of the air here makes the place tenable--so far, at least. We made many an effort to get an apartment near the Madeleine, but we had to sacrifice sun or money, or breath, in going {{up to the top of}} a house, and the sacrifice seemed too great upon consideration, and we came off to the 'Avenue des Champs-Elysées,' on the sunshiny side of the way, to a southern aspect, and pretty cheerful carpeted rooms--a drawing room, a dressing and writing room for Robert, a small dining room, two comfortable bedrooms and a third bedroom upstairs for the femme de service, kitchen, &c., for two hundred francs a month. Not too dear, we think. About the same that we paid, out of the season, in London for the miserable accommodation we had there. But perhaps you won't come near us now; we may be too much 'out of the way' for you. Is it so indeed? Understand that close by us is a stand of coupés and fiacres, not to profane your ears with the mention of the continual stream of omnibuses by means of which you may reach the other end of Paris for six sous. And there might be a possibility of taking a small apartment for you in this very house. See how I castle-build.|$|E
