5|$|Two {{groups of}} {{relatively}} large insects, the Ephemeroptera (mayflies) and the Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies) have the flight muscles attached directly to their wings; the wings can beat no <b>faster</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> {{rate at which}} nerves can send impulses to command the muscles to beat.

5|$|The medley relay was {{scheduled}} for Thursday, 24 July, the fifth day of swimming competition, with heats {{in the morning and}} the final in the evening. Australia's prospects improved when Sweden was disqualified in the first heat. Australia and the Soviet Union swam in the second heat. With their superior depth, the home team was able to rest their entire first-choice quartet in the heats. On the other hand, Australia was only willing to rest KerryGlenn Patching swam the backstroke leg in his place. The hosts led the Australians from the start and extended their margin over each of the first three legs. Brooks reclaimed 1.34s on the freestyle leg, but the Australians fell 0.13s short to come second in their heat. Nevertheless, the Australians still qualified in second place overall, as they and the Soviets were more than 1.5s <b>faster</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> third-placed Hungarians.

5|$|The strongest {{evidence}} for dark matter comes from galactic motion. Galaxies rotate much <b>faster</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> amount of visible matter suggests they should; the gravity from the ordinary matter {{is not enough}} to hold the galaxy together. Scientists theorize that the galaxy is held together by huge quantities of dark matter. Similarly, clusters of galaxies do not appear to have enough visible matter to gravitationally balance the high speed motions of their component galaxies.|$|E
5|$|There is a {{distinction}} between a redshift in cosmological context as compared to that witnessed when nearby objects exhibit a local Doppler-effect redshift. Rather than cosmological redshifts being {{a consequence of the}} relative velocities that are subject to the laws of special relativity (and thus subject to the rule that no two locally separated objects can have relative velocities with respect to each other <b>faster</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> speed of light), the photons instead increase in wavelength and redshift because of a global feature of the spacetime metric through which they are traveling. One interpretation of this effect is the idea that space itself is expanding. Due to the expansion increasing as distances increase, the distance between two remote galaxies can increase at more than 3 m/s, but this does not imply that the galaxies move <b>faster</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> speed of light at their present location (which is forbidden by Lorentz covariance).|$|E
