5|$|I fell in {{love with}} him as a ten-year-old boy. I saw him in a play in New York... a very well-staged melodrama which was an {{enormous}} hit for about a year—it was made as a movie later with somebody else. He had the leading role, and I never forgot him. And through the years I'd seen him in movies—little things. And I could never forget that performance of his. He's always played very stereotyped parts in pictures but is one of the best actors I've ever known. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>such</b> respect for him. You play next to him and you just feel the thing that you do with a big actor—this dynamo going on.|$|E

The show chronicles real-life medical techniques and technology, on the Discovery Channel. Nielsen said: [...] "There {{are any number of}} things that you think about when you ponder if you hadn't been an actor, what would you be, and I've always said I'd like to be an astronaut or a doctor. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>such</b> admiration for doctors. I just don't know how you go around to thank them enough for coming up with the world's most remarkable new discoveries." ...|$|E

[...] He went on to say: [...] "We have got an awesome bunch of guys in this squad... but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>such</b> respect for Cambridge... with a lighter crew we've turned round the biggest weight deficit in history." [...] Nethercott remarked [...] "I really thought we had lost. [...] In the space of a few seconds I went from the lowest point in my life to absolute, unbridled ecstasy." [...] The Cambridge oarsman James Livingston said [...] "It was the worst margin to lose by. I just wish I could stop losing these epic races" [...] while the Cambridge coach Williams described the defeat as a [...] "blow to the heart". Wooge was disappointed: [...] "I pull my hat off to Oxford, that was an amazing race." [...] Rankov later revealed [...] "It’s the hardest I’ve ever had to work in an umpiring situation." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the late}} winter of 1867, Stowe {{followed}} {{her son to}} Florida, finding that the warmer weather allowed her {{to spend more time}} on two novels she was writing. Her first weeks in Orange Park utterly transformed her and she became enchanted with Florida at once, writing that she felt she had sprouted wings and become [...] "young & frisky". She accompanied her son one day to collect the mail, which was deposited in Mandarin, about [...] across the St. Johns River. They rowed to the eastern shore and Stowe {{fell in love with a}} cottage in Mandarin, attached to an orange grove. Stowe's transformation in Florida was rooted in her identification and familiarity with Puritan New England: industry and thrift in a climate where cold sharpened one's senses and values. The laid-back attitude of the people and warmth of the Southern climate were seductive. She at first attempted to persuade her brother Charles to purchase the land in Mandarin, writing to him and asking [...] "How do you think New England theology would have fared had been landed here instead of Plymouth Rock?" [...] She wrote about the land and climate intoxicating her and pondered the effect it might have had on literature when she posed an idea to her publisher: [...] "I hate to leave my calm isle of Patmos—where the world is not and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>such</b> quiet long hours for writing. [...] Emerson could insulate himself here and keep his electricity. [...] Hawthorne ought to have lived in an orange grove in Florida." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Gimme More" [...] {{has been}} covered by many artists {{and a great}} number of amateurs. In late 2007, American singer-songwriter Marié Digby posted an {{acoustic}} cover of [...] "Gimme More" [...] along with a cover of Rihanna's [...] "Umbrella" [...] in her YouTube account. Both became viral hits, with [...] "Gimme More" [...] gaining more than 300,000 views in two weeks. Shortly after, Digby became the eighth most subscribed-to artist on YouTube. She joked about the situation saying, [...] "I could have done a karaoke video to , but I just had my stripper pole taken out the other day from my living room, and it just wouldn't have been the same". The same year, Australian pop singer Sia released an acoustic version of the song. Swedish metal band Machinae Supremacy covered the song on their third studio album Overworld, released on February 13, 2008. Matthieu De Ronde of Archaic Magazine commented [...] " [...] one of the most unexpected covers of all time, [...] this track has been given a somewhat comical but enjoyable makeover, but who said that metal couldn’t be fun?". American singer-songwriter Christopher Dallman played a cover of the song during many of his concerts in 2007. Two years later, he showed his version to his producer Rachel Alina, who prompted him to release an EP of Spears's covers. The EP, titled Sad Britney, was released on November 9, 2009, and also contained covers of [...] "Radar", [...] "Toxic" [...] and [...] "...Baby One More Time". It became Dallman's first record to chart on iTunes. He also released a music video for [...] "Gimme More", which was criticized by Spears's fans who thought Dallman was making fun of her. He explained, [...] "There have been a few folks who have misinterpreted what I was doing and thought that I was somehow making fun of her, which really isn’t the case. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>such</b> a place in my heart for Britney".|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Till the World Ends" [...] was {{directed}} by Ray Kay and filmed inside a basement in Los Angeles, California. On March 17, 2011, Spears posted on her Twitter account, [...] "Day 1 of the #TTWE Videoshoot. Just wrapped my first big dance number. Taking a well deserved break people!" [...] She also tweeted {{a picture of her}} on set, wearing ripped tights, a Burberry Prorsum studded leather jacket and matching fingerless leather gloves. The making-of was chronicled on the special Britney Spears: I Am the Femme Fatale, which aired on MTV on April 3, 2011, at 21:00 EST (02:00 UTC). In the special, Spears is seen watching the playback, as she later explained, [...] " [...] just to make sure it's right and that the costume looks right and the dancers are together and we all look in unison. It's an energy and it looks fresh. It has a certain vibe with it and it makes sense." [...] She also went on to describe the set as [...] "grimy and gross [...] It was sweat and it was disgusting sometimes". At a point in the shoot, Spears changed her heels to Ugg boots during the shots that did not show her feet, stating that [...] " [...] hurts ... but it looks good. It wasn't a full-length shot, so a girl's about comfort when it's not showing." [...] Spears said that she did not feel the need to top herself, saying that [...] "I've made so many videos that I'm at the point that I genuinely want to enjoy myself, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>such</b> a good team of people with me. [...] I had never worked with Ray Kay before. I was really happy with the work we did." [...] The video was choreographed by Brian Friedman. On April 4, 2011, it was announced that two different versions of the music video would be released, a director's cut and a choreography cut. The same day, Spears tweeted a 30-second preview of the video, announcing, [...] "#TillTheWorldEnds video premieres THIS Wednesday on VEVO. Cant wait to share it with you guys!" [...] "Till the World Ends" [...] became at the Spears second VEVOcertified music video on YouTube.|$|E

2500|$|Duterte has [...] "bragged {{about his}} Viagra-fuelled serial adultery", drawing {{criticism}} from the GABRIELA Women's Party.

When I got old, I could do short time only because <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>such</b> a short time left. After one erection, that’s it. No more. Without Viagra, it’s even more difficult." [...] Despite one of its representatives Luz Ilagan once stated that the people should focus on his track record and not on his womanizing ways, GABRIELA national chairperson Emmi de Jesus reiterated its stance against Duterte.|$|E

"Originally I {{had this}} idea {{that it should be}} {{possible}} to create some kind of community around this kind of work, and I think by muddying the titles – not having [...] "you are the composer, you are the arranger, you are the orchestrator" [...] – it just sort of helped us to work more collaboratively. It wasn't that important to me that I had [...] "score by Hans Zimmer" [...] and took sole credit on these things. It's like Gladiator: I gave Lisa Gerrard the co-credit because, even though she didn't write the main theme, her presence and contributions were very influential. She was more than just a soloist, and this is why <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>such</b> a problem with specific credits." ...|$|E
