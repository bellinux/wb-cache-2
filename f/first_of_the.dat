5|$|A {{spin-off}} prequel show, <b>First</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Summer Wine, premiered on BBC1 in 1988. The new programme {{was written}} by Roy Clarke and used different actors to follow {{the activities of the}} principal characters from Last of the Summer Wine {{in the months leading up}} to World War II. Unlike its mother show, <b>First</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Summer Wine was not filmed in Holmfirth. Period music was used instead of Ronnie Hazlehurst's score to create a more World War II era atmosphere. New supporting characters were added to those from Last of the Summer Wine. Peter Sallis and Jonathan Linsley were the only actors from the original series to appear in the spin-off: Sallis played the father of his own character from the original show and Linsley appeared during the second series as a different character.|$|E

5|$|After {{several months}} of {{increasing}} tension between the factions struggling for power within the insurgency, the <b>first</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pro-Chetnik coups occurred, in the Ozren Partisan Detachment. It was sparked by the arrest and execution on 18 April of pro-Chetnik agitator Bogdan Jovićić by Vukmanović-Tempo and the newly formed 1st East Bosnian Shock Battalion. Fighting ensued between pro-Chetnik members of the detachment and the Shock Battalion. Vukmanović-Tempo then abandoned the Ozren Partisan Detachment, taking the detachment staff and remaining loyal Partisans with him.|$|E

In 1097, William II began the building of Westminster Hall, close by the abbey of the same name. The hall became {{the basis of a}} new Palace of Westminster.|$|E
5|$|Although the Japanese {{continued}} {{to try to}} secure more territory, and the U.S. did not move from a state of naval parity to one of supremacy until after several more months of hard combat, Midway allowed the Allies to switch to the strategic initiative, {{paving the way for}} the landings on Guadalcanal and the prolonged attrition of the Solomon Islands campaign. Midway allowed this to occur before the <b>first</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new Essex-class fleet carriers became available at the end of 1942. The Guadalcanal Campaign is also regarded by some as {{a turning point in the}} Pacific War.|$|E

5|$|As was {{the case}} for School Days and Summer Days, the {{original}} soundtrack of Cross Days was reproduced for distribution alongside the game, initially scheduled for February 27, 2009.

Following the second delay, the soundtrack was held indefinitely until 0verflow announced on April 16, 2010 that it would be released April 21. The album contains all of the game's background music, all of which was composed by HIKO of KIRIKO/HIKO Sound, and theme songs performed by Yozuca*, iyuna, Ceui, Kotaro Odaka and Riryka, totaling 25 tracks.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{the work}} on reactor development, the Metallurgical Laboratory studied the {{chemistry}} and metallurgy of plutonium, and worked with DuPont to develop the bismuth phosphate process used to separate plutonium from uranium. When it became certain that nuclear reactors would involve radioactive materials on a gigantic scale, there was considerable concern about {{the health and safety}} aspects, and the study of the biological effects of radiation assumed greater importance. It was discovered that plutonium, like radium, was a bone seeker, making it especially hazardous. The Metallurgical Laboratory became the <b>first</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> national laboratories, the Argonne National Laboratory, on 1 July 1946.|$|E

5|$|Because TAPS {{hoped to}} begin laying pipe by September 1969, {{substantial}} orders were placed for steel pipeline 48inches (122cm) in diameter.

5|$|Berhtwald died on 13 January 731. An epitaph to him {{in verse}} survives, {{and may have been}} placed over his tomb, which was at Canterbury.
