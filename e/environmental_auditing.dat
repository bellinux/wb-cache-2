For the first time in Olympic history, environmental and sustainability issues were considered in venue construction. This resulted in five venues being modified during their design and construction phase to lessen their impact upon the environment. Among the issues considered were the venues blending into surrounding landscape, treatment of terrain with as minimal damage to natural surroundings as possible, use of environmentally-friendly materials, and <b>environmental</b> <b>auditing.</b> Gjøvik Olympic Cavern Hall was constructed inside a mountain that maintained a year-round temperature of , with the excavated rock used to build a beach promenade. Transport was dominated by the use of buses and trains for spectators. Downtown Lillehammer and the axis between Lillehammer and Oslo were the most congested areas, and the Norwegian State Railways ran up to 22 trains per day between Oslo and Lillehammer. All venues could be reached within walking distance from train stations.|$|E

50|$|This {{period was}} characterised by the almost {{complete}} domination of environmental accounting over social accounting. There {{have also been}} a number of extensions from environmental disclosures into <b>environmental</b> <b>auditing</b> as well as the development of framework to guide the applications of <b>environmental</b> <b>auditing</b> and in particular the development of environmental management systems. There was still little regulatory framework affecting social and environmental accounting disclosures and conceptual frameworks for accounting do not extend to non-financial quantification and social or environmental issues. The development of a clear regulatory as well conceptual framework is getting closer in several countries, whereas the progress of environmental regulation in the UK and Europe was slower than in the United States, Canada or Australia. The progress was uneven but rapid compared with that in the area of social accounting disclosures. In this times, there have been several textbooks and journal articles covering both social and environmental accounting. However, there has been a relative lack of normative/philosophical work within accounting during this period: Environmental accounting has not been revived the models of the 1970s and adapted them to the discussions about the valuation of externalities. Sustainability and the discussion of the role of management accounting in assisting with sustainable development have become of growing interest.|$|E

5000|$|The second {{development}} is that China is {{moving away from}} a rigid, hierarchical, command-and control system to a g decentralised and more flexible environmental policy-making and implementation system. Local and provincial Environmental Protection Bureaus and local governments are more prominent in developing environmental priorities, strategies, financial models and institutional arrangements. This has is {{as a result of}} past state failures in national environmental policy, though it is seen also {{as a part of a}} wider tendencies of less centralised control in Chinese society. The tendency is one towards larger influence and decision-making power by the local authorities and diminishing control by Beijing, both by the central state structures and by the CPC (for example, decentralisation in energy policy. [...] Proponents of decentralization have argued that decentralised and more flexible environmental policies may be more effective as they can be better adapted to the local physical and socio-economic situation, however citizens perceptions on the (environmental) performance of local urban governments are not very positive. In China, as elsewhere, decentralization does not automatically result in better protection of the environment, as local authorities typically give preference to economic growth and investments over the progressive development of environmental policies and stringent enforcement of environmental regulation and standards. [...] Therefore, decentralised policies need to be paralleled by performance measurement, (<b>environmental)</b> <b>auditing</b> and accountability mechanisms, to make sure that local authorities give priority to the environmental concerns of citizens (and not to their own interest). In contemporary China, the Quantitative Examination System for Comprehensive Urban Environmental Control and an emerging <b>environmental</b> <b>auditing</b> system have been developed in this regard. They ensure some form of national control, where environmental policy-making and implementation becomes decentralised.|$|E

5000|$|Current {{technology}} supports many {{versions of}} computer-based protocols {{that attempt to}} simplify the audit process by converting regulatory requirements into questions with [...] "yes", [...] "no" [...] and [...] "not applicable" [...] check boxes.

Other auditors (typically those with many years of <b>environmental</b> <b>auditing</b> experience) use the regulations/permits directly as protocols. There is a long standing debate among environmental audit professionals on the value of large, highly detailed and prescriptive protocols (i.e., that can, in theory, be completed by an auditor with little or no technical experience) versus more flexible protocols that rely on the expertise and knowledge of experienced auditors and source documents (regulations, permits, etc.) directly. However usage of structured and prescriptive protocols in ISO 14001 audits allows easier review by other parties, either internal to the Certification Body (e.g. technical reviewers and certification managers) or external (accreditation bodies).|$|E

This <b>environmental</b> <b>audit</b> report of the <b>environmental</b> <b>audit</b> will serve as a revision to the existing EMS and will thus update it. The focus of the <b>environmental</b> <b>audit</b> was on the sensitive environment adjacent to the roadway, and all structures, road camps, dams, borrow pits, and environmental policies related to it. In order to conduct the audit, it was necessary to: review the existing EMS and other documentation (e. g. minutes of site meetings) related to the construction of the upgraded road; conduct field studies of the present condition of the environment on either side of the length of the roadway; and conduct interviews with key personnel from the Department of Public Works, Roads and Transport, and of the GGHNP. The findings of the <b>environmental</b> <b>audit</b> reveal that the existing EMS was not completely implemented during the construction and post-completion phases of the roadway. The audit findings were evaluated and analysed, and corrective measures prescribed for elements which were only partially effective, or did not conform to the existing EMS recommendations. This <b>environmental</b> <b>audit</b> report verifies the status quo of the existing EMS and the related environment. The compilation and implementation of this report, thus plays a very important role in the future environmental management of the roadway and the sensitive environment related to it...|$|R

5000|$|In the US, {{permits for}} air emissions, {{wastewater}} discharges and other operational aspects, many times establish the primary legal compliance standards for companies. In these cases, auditing {{only to the}} regulations is inadequate. However, as these permits are site specific, standard protocols are not commercially available that reflect every permit condition for every company/site. Therefore, permit holders and the auditors they hire must identify the permit requirements and determine {{the most effective way}} to audit against those requirements. During the past 20 years, advances in technology have had major impacts on auditing. Laptop computers, portable printers, CD/DVDs, the internet, email and wireless internet access have all been used to improve audits, increase/improve auditor access to regulatory information and create audit reports on-site. At one point in the 1990s, one major company invested significant resources in testing [...] "video audits" [...] where the auditor (located at the corporate headquarters) used real-time video conferencing technology to direct staff at a site to carry live video cameras to specific areas of the plant. While initially promising, this technology/concept did not prove acceptable. An emerging technology in <b>environmental</b> <b>auditing</b> is the use of tablet computers.|$|E
50|$|The ISO 14001 is a {{voluntary}} international standard created in 1996 by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and forms {{part of the}} ISO14000 series of environmental standards. This came about {{as a result of}} the Uruguay round of the GATT negotiations and the Rio Summit on the Environment held in 1992. At the Uruguay round of the GATT negotiations the need to reduce the non-tariff barriers to trade were discussed whereas at the Rio Summit the commitment to protect the environment at an international scale was argued. This brought about the ISO 14001 which allows firms to inform stakeholders of the implementation of an Environmental Management System (EMS) and specifies the actual requirements for an EMS. The ISO 14001 standard defines EMS as “the general part of management that includes the organizational structure, the activity planning, the responsibilities, the practices, the procedures, the processes and the resources to develop, implement, carry out, and revise the environmental policy and keep it up to date”. Similarly to the FSC ISO 14001 certification can be issued by any third party certification body, (but to prove credibility, such bodies should be accredited (to offer ISO 14001 certification) by organisations such as JAS-ANZ, ANAB, UKAS, and others. These accreditation bodies audit the certification bodies to ensure that the assessment and certification processes are robust and free from conflicts of interest. It provides guidelines and suggestions for matters such as environmental management, <b>environmental</b> <b>auditing,</b> and environmental labelling or lifecycle assessment. It applies to all organisations large or small and covers all sectors if there are environmental aspects that the organisation can control and influence in a positive way. There are other Environmental management system standards that while addressing the requirements of ISO 14001, they have other additional benefits, for example the Eco Warranty standard not only meets the requirements of ISO 14001 but also allows use of the certification logo; this is not allowable with accredited ISO 14001 certification.|$|E
