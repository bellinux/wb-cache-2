500|$|In late 2011, Yusef {{manages to}} win his former wife back. They later make plans to get married. Nina Wadia {{explains}} why Zainab is willing to forgive Yusef. Wadia said to Inside Soap: [...] "He tells Zainab that {{he was forced to}} start the fire by his family. Yusef goes on to explain that he knew it was wrong the minute he lit the match, and that he ran into the house to save her. And {{by the end of this}} conversation, she finds herself saying to him, 'Let's get married' - regardless! Obviously, it was something I struggled to get my head around. But being burnt in that fire is what they both have in common - and that experience connects them so deeply. She recognises that he made a mistake but also decides that the whole thing was probably her fault, because she walked out on their marriage." [...] Wadia continued: [...] "It doesn't look like Zainab's going to listen. But as Denise leaves, it's clear she's torn about what to do." [...] A short time before their wedding day arrives, Yusef starts to abuse Zainab both physically and mentally. He forbids Zainab to leave the house and later starts using her son, Kamil, to control her. Wadia explains that she wants the storyline to have a positive impact against real-life violence. She told BBC News :"I think the idea behind showing a strong woman like Zainab changing like this is to show that <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> even the strongest of women. They can change and they can be manipulated - especially if they're isolated from their friends and family. The manipulator can take advantage, so it's to prove that it can even happen to people like her. To be honest, if even one woman rings that Action Line at the end of the show and there's some difference made to her life, I'll feel like we've done our job," [...] she continued. [...] "It is a serious issue and I'm glad it's being highlighted. I hope that it wakes anyone up - not just women, I know that there are abused men out there as well. So if it gives anyone the strength to leave a relationship like that, we'll have done our job." [...] The scenes where Yusef refused to let Zainab see Kamil pulled in 8.69m viewers at 7.30pm. BBC Three's repeat of the episode later secured 994k viewers at 10pm.|$|E

40|$|Conflict {{research}} is generally focused on explaining {{those people that}} engage in violence. This thesis suggests that we also study ordinary civilians and their opinions and support for violence. Such a civilian-centered research focus is necessary because implicit in much of conflict research there are some underlying assumptions, moral judgments, and geographic ideas about violence-supporters. These ideas which can be called imaginary moral geographies of political violence (MGPV) are causing large divides in the conflict literature. It is preferable to study violence-support directly rather than to imagine them. Attempting to empirically explain and describe the spaces and geographies of support for violence in a GIS may be one fruitful way to better understand political violence and its supporters. Using multilevel modeling various theories are tested {{to find out why}} people really support the use of violence. Generally, the finding in the thesis {{is that most of the}} varied theories have some influence on support for violence. Similarly, based on geo-locating levels of support to the national and province level, we also find that the real MGPV’s can be said to be mixture of most imagined MGPVs. Violence-support is neither entirely supported, nor entirely opposed and that neither is it only located ‘over there’ or ‘over here’.

50|$|This poleward {{expansion}} {{has been}} associated with rapid phenotypic change and founder effects including reduction in genetic diversity and increases in genetic differentiation. It has been found that the new edge populations are genetically differentiated from the core populations and all of the new populations were differentiated from each other giving indication that each range expansion is independent. There are some issues with the changes in genetic diversity though. There has been studies completed on the dainty damselfly showing that genetic diversity can influence the success of colonization and can decrease resistance to stress and disease. This can make the insect more susceptible to toxins such as pesticides which in turn also affects the dainty damselflies ability to continue their dispersal through slow movement, reduced population growth and flight ability. The dainty damselflies are being exposed to pesticides more frequently due to their dispersal and need to cross agricultural land to reach new habitats. It's not just dispersal due to climate change that causes the genetic changes in the dainty damselfly though, <b>it</b> <b>can</b> also <b>happen</b> due <b>to</b> natural range expansion as well. The genetic diversity and structure of dainty damselflies are shaped by both historical rapid range expansions and contemporary processed causing dispersal like environmental factors (climate change).|$|R

Domestic violence happens in privacy, behind closed doors, among people who are close. <b>It</b> <b>can</b> occur in all social classes and <b>it</b> <b>can</b> basically <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> anyone. The survey shows that almost every fourth woman has experienced domestic violence, therefore, this theses focuses on the perception {{of domestic violence}} {{from the perspective of}} women as its victims. The bachelor thesis is focused on comparison of the theory, developed from available sources {{as well as from the}} real experience of a victim, which was discovered on the basis of quality research. The theoretical part of the bachelor thesis deals with the definition of domestic violence, its causes, process, signs and possible consequences. Further, it deals with the characteristics of the victim and with the influence the situation has on children who witness domestic violence. Qualitative methodology was chosen for the survey. A semi-structured interview was selected as a collection technique. The research sample was made up of seven women. They each were privately interviewed, and each one was at that time or had been previously involved in a relationship, where domestic violence had already occured. The aim of the thesis was to reflect on domestic violence from the point of view of the victims, and to finding out, which type of domestic violence is considered to be the worst by the victims, and, further, which reasons prevent the victims from actively resolving their situation. The research showed that the victims consider the psychological abuse to be the worst manifestation of partner violence, especially for its longevity and for the consequences that are left on their psychological condition. Among the reasons which prevent the victims from resolving the situation actively are, for instance, shame, fear of losing children, fear of the partner and distrust of police and other institutions. By means of this thesis I intended to take a closer look at the issue of domestic violence and to portray the complicated situation of abused women...|$|R
