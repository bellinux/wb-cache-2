5|$|Phylogenetic {{analysis}} by Koepfli and Wayne in 1998 found the giant otter {{has the highest}} <b>divergence</b> sequences within the otter subfamily, forming a distinct clade that split away 10 to 14 million years ago. They noted that the species may be the basal <b>divergence</b> among the otters or fall outside of them altogether, having split even before other mustelids, such as the ermine, polecat, and mink. Later gene sequencing research on the mustelids, from 2005, places the <b>divergence</b> of the giant otter somewhat later, between five and 11 million years ago; the corresponding phylogenetic tree locates the Lontra <b>divergence</b> first among otter genera, and Pteronura second, although <b>divergence</b> ranges overlap.|$|E

5|$|Although Mirza, Microcebus, and Allocebus form a clade within Cheirogaleidae, {{the three}} {{lineages}} {{are thought to}} have diverged during a narrow window of time, so the relationships within this clade are difficult to determine and may change with further research.

40|$|We discuss two {{families}} of two-parameter entropies and <b>divergences,</b> {{derived from the}} standard Rényi and Tsallis entropies and <b>divergences.</b> These <b>divergences</b> and entropies are found as <b>divergences</b> or entropies of escort distributions. Exploiting the nonnegativity of the <b>divergences,</b> we derive {{the expression of the}} canonical distribution associated to the new entropies and a observable given as an escort-mean value. We show that this canonical distribution extends, and smoothly connects, the results obtained in nonextensive thermodynamics for the standard and generalized mean value constraints...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} novel class of <b>divergences</b> induced by a smooth convex {{function}} called total Jensen <b>divergences.</b> Those total Jensen <b>divergences</b> are invariant by construction to rotations, a feature yielding regularization of ordinary Jensen <b>divergences</b> by a conformal factor. We analyze {{the relationships between}} this novel class of total Jensen <b>divergences</b> and the recently introduced total Bregman <b>divergences.</b> We then proceed by defining the total Jensen centroids as average distortion minimizers, and study their robustness performance to outliers. Finally, we prove that the k-means++ initialization that bypasses explicit centroid computations is good enough in practice to guarantee probabilistically a constant approximation factor to the optimal k-means clustering.

5|$|Genetic {{evidence}} suggests that our human ancestors acquired pubic lice from gorillas approximately 3-4 million years ago. Unlike the genus Pediculus, the <b>divergence</b> in Phthirus does not match the age of host <b>divergence</b> that likely occurred 7 million years ago. Reed et al. propose a Phthirus species host-switch around 3-4 million years ago. While {{it is difficult to}} determine if a parasite-host switch occurred in evolutionary history, this explanation is the most parsimonious (containing the fewest evolutionary changes).|$|E

In noncommutative QED, collinear <b>divergences</b> due to triple photon splitting vertex, were encountered, which are shown to be canceled out by the non-commutative version of KLN theorem.

5|$|The {{origins and}} {{evolutionary}} {{relationships between the}} three main groups of amphibians {{is a matter of}} debate. A 2005 molecular phylogeny, based on rDNA analysis, suggests that salamanders and caecilians are more closely related to each other than they are to frogs. It also appears that the <b>divergence</b> of the three groups took place in the Paleozoic or early Mesozoic (around 250 million years ago), before the breakup of the supercontinent Pangaea and soon after their <b>divergence</b> from the lobe-finned fish. The briefness of this period, and the swiftness with which radiation took place, would help account for the relative scarcity of primitive amphibian fossils. There are large gaps in the fossil record, but the discovery of a proto-frog from the Early Permian in Texas in 2008 provided a missing link with many of the characteristics of modern frogs. Molecular analysis suggests that the frog–salamander <b>divergence</b> took place considerably earlier than the palaeontological evidence indicates. Newer research indicates that the common ancestor of all Lissamphibians lived about 315 million years ago, and that stereospondyls are the closest relatives to the caecilians.|$|E

40|$|We {{discuss the}} {{structure}} of rapidity <b>divergences</b> that are presented in the soft factors of transverse momentum dependent (TMD) factorization theorems. To provide the discussion on the most general level we consider soft factors for multi-parton scattering. We show that the rapidity <b>divergences</b> are result of the gluon exchanges with the distant transverse plane, and are structurally equivalent to the ultraviolet <b>divergences.</b> It allows to formulate and to prove the renormalization theorem for rapidity <b>divergences.</b> The proof is made with the help the conformal transformation which maps rapidity <b>divergences</b> to ultraviolet <b>divergences.</b> The theorem is the systematic form of the factorization of rapidity <b>divergences,</b> which {{is required for the}} definition of TMD parton distributions. In particular, the definition of multi parton distributions is presented. The equivalence of ultraviolet and rapidity <b>divergences</b> leads to the exact relation between soft and rapidity anomalous dimensions. Using this relation we derive the rapidity anomalous dimension at the three-loop order. Comment: 40 pages, 7 figures; definitions presented in sec. 6. 1 updated + minor correction...|$|R

5|$|Although stem lemuriforms like Djebelemur {{may have}} been {{contemporaneous}} with related toothcombed primates around 50 to 48 mya, the sparse African fossil record suggests toothcomb differentiation occurred around 52 to 40mya according to the French paleoanthropologist Marc Godinot.

5|$|Dentition is the {{key feature}} by which fossil rodents are {{recognized}} and the earliest record of such mammals comes from the Paleocene, shortly after the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs some 66 million years ago.

The <b>divergence</b> of Glires, a clade consisting of rodents and lagomorphs (rabbits, hares and pikas), from other placental mammals occurred within a few million years after the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary; rodents and lagomorphs then radiated during the Cenozoic.

60|$|To sum up,--the {{evidence}} {{as far as}} we have gone is against the argument as to any limit to <b>divergences,</b> so far as structure is concerned; and in favour of a physiological limitation.

5|$|Extratropical {{cyclones}} form along linear {{bands of}} temperature/dewpoint gradient with significant vertical wind shear, {{and are thus}} classified as baroclinic cyclones. Initially, cyclogenesis, or low pressure formation, occurs along frontal zones near a favorable quadrant of a maximum in the upper level jetstream known as a jet streak. The favorable quadrants are usually at the right rear and left front quadrants, where <b>divergence</b> ensues. The <b>divergence</b> causes air to rush out {{from the top of}} the air column. As mass in the column is reduced, atmospheric pressure at surface level (the weight of the air column) is reduced. The lowered pressure strengthens the cyclone (a low pressure system). The lowered pressure acts to draw in air, creating convergence in the low-level wind field. Low-level convergence and upper-level <b>divergence</b> imply upward motion within the column, making cyclones tend to be cloudy. As the cyclone strengthens, the cold front sweeps towards the equator and moves around the back of the cyclone. Meanwhile, its associated warm front progresses more slowly, as the cooler air ahead of the system is denser, and therefore more difficult to dislodge. Later, the cyclones occlude as the poleward portion of the cold front overtakes a section of the warm front, forcing a tongue, or trowal, of warm air aloft. Eventually, the cyclone will become barotropically cold and begin to weaken.|$|E
