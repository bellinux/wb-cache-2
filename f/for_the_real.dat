5|$|Sigismund II's childlessness added {{urgency to}} the idea of turning the {{personal}} union between Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania into a more permanent and tighter relationship; it was also a priority for the execution movement. Lithuania's laws were codified and reforms enacted in 1529, 1557, 1565–1566 and 1588, gradually making its social, legal and economic system similar to that of Poland, with the expanding role of the middle and lower nobility. Fighting wars with Moscow under Ivan IV and the threat perceived from that direction provided additional motivation <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> union for both Poland and Lithuania.|$|E

5|$|After {{directing}} The Search for Spock, {{cast member}} Leonard Nimoy {{was asked to}} direct the next feature, and given greater freedom regarding the film's content. Nimoy and producer Harve Bennett conceived a story with an environmental message and no clear-cut villain. Dissatisfied with the first screenplay produced by Steve Meerson and Peter Krikes, Paramount hired The Wrath of Khan writer and director Nicholas Meyer. Meyer and Bennett divided the story between them and wrote {{different parts of the}} script, requiring approval from Nimoy, lead actor William Shatner, and Paramount. Principal photography commenced on February 24, 1986. Unlike previous Star Trek films, The Voyage Home was shot extensively on location; many real settings and buildings were used as stand-ins for scenes set around and in the city of San Francisco. Special effects firm Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) assisted in post-production and the film's special effects. Few of the humpback whales in the film were real: ILM devised full-size animatronics and small motorized models to stand in <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> creatures.|$|E
40|$|We {{prove that}} Schanuel’s {{conjecture}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>reals</b> {{is equivalent to}} a uniform version of itself. Schanuel’s conjecture {{is one of the}} central conjectures in transcendental number theory. Some of its consequences in that field are discussed by Lang in [1]. Macintyre and Wilkie gave another application when they showed in [3] that if Schanuel’s conjecture is true at least over <b>the</b> <b>real</b> numbers then <b>the</b> theory of <b>the</b> <b>real</b> field with exponentiation is decidable. The uniform Schanuel conjecture <b>for</b> <b>the</b> complex numbers and its consequences were a subject of discussion in [7]. It was shown in that paper that the standard Schanuel conjecture is equivalent to the uniform Schanuel conjecture if one assumes a certain Diophantine-type conjecture about intersections of complex algebraic varieties with tori, that is algebraic subgroups of (C ∗) n. Here we prove that <b>the</b> Schanuel conjecture <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>reals</b> is equivalent to the corresponding uniform conjecture without any extra assumptions...|$|R

5|$|Though {{the tale}} of Maya Sita told in the Ramayana adaptations is absent from the original, the concept of Maya Sita first appears in the epic itself. In the battle between Rama and Ravana, Indrajit – the son of Ravana – creates an {{illusion}}ary Sita (Maya Sita) and kills {{her in front of}} Rama's monkey general Hanuman, as a war tactic to dampen the spirits of Rama's army. The fooled Hanuman reports it to Rama, who is also dejected by the news. However, they soon realise that it must be an illusion of Indrajit. Another surrogate Sita appears in a later interpolation of the epic. At the end of the Ramayana, a golden image of Sita is subsisted <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> Sita to be on side of Rama in sacrifices, after Sita's abandonment by Rama when her chastity is questioned by his subjects.|$|E

50|$|In {{strongly}} typed languages, it {{is sometimes}} desirable to {{have a number of}} functions with the same name, but operating on different types of data, or with different parameter profiles. For example, a square root function might be defined to operate on reals, complex values or matrices. The algorithm to be used in each case is different, and the return result may be different. By writing three separate functions with the same name, the programmer has the convenience of not having to remember different names for each type of data. Further if a subtype can be defined <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>reals,</b> to separate positive and negative reals, two functions can be written <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>reals,</b> one to return a <b>real</b> when <b>the</b> parameter is positive, and another to return a complex value when the parameter is negative.|$|R
