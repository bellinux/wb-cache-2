5|$|Possibly {{related to}} active galactic nuclei (as well as starburst regions) are low-ionization nuclear {{emission}}-line regions (LINERs). The emission from LINER-type galaxies {{is dominated by}} weakly <b>ionized</b> elements. The excitation sources for the weakly <b>ionized</b> lines include post-AGB stars, AGN, and shocks. Approximately one-third of nearby galaxies are classified as containing LINER nuclei.|$|E
5|$|The first largely {{complete}} set of oscillator strengths of singly <b>ionized</b> iron-group elements were made available in the 1960s, and these were subsequently improved. In 1978, the abundances of singly <b>ionized</b> elements of the iron group were derived.|$|E
40|$|A {{problem of}} <b>ionizing</b> {{radiation}} is considered in this thesis. The work consists of few chapters, where types of <b>ionizing</b> radiation and its interaction with material environment, also separate measures, which characterize both {{a source of}} <b>ionizing</b> radiation and influence of <b>ionizing</b> radiation on a life form are describes. Kinds of detectors of <b>ionizing</b> radiation and principles of their running are taken up as well...|$|R

50|$|<b>Ionizing</b> {{radiation}} is categorized {{by the nature}} of the particles or electromagnetic waves that create the <b>ionizing</b> effect. These have different ionization mechanisms, and may be grouped as directly or indirectly <b>ionizing.</b>|$|R
5|$|A {{number of}} {{molecules}} exist in interstellar space, as can tiny 0.1μm dust particles. The tally of molecules discovered through radio astronomy is steadily increasing {{at the rate}} of about four new species per year. Large regions of higher density matter known as molecular clouds allow chemical reactions to occur, including the formation of organic polyatomic species. Much of this chemistry is driven by collisions. Energetic cosmic rays penetrate the cold, dense clouds and ionize hydrogen and helium, resulting, for example, in the trihydrogen cation. An <b>ionized</b> helium atom can then split relatively abundant carbon monoxide to produce <b>ionized</b> carbon, which in turn can lead to organic chemical reactions.|$|E
5|$|During {{magnetic}} {{storms and}} substorms, charged particles can be deflected {{from the outer}} magnetosphere and especially the magnetotail, directed along field lines into Earth's ionosphere, where atmospheric atoms can be excited and <b>ionized,</b> causing the aurora.|$|E
5|$|Gastrointestinal and urinary pH affect {{absorption}} and elimination. Gastrointestinal alkalizing (acidifying) agents increase (decrease) absorption. Urinary alkalizing (acidifying) agents increase {{concentration of}} non-ionized (<b>ionized)</b> species, decreasing (increasing) urinary excretion.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} the biologic effects of <b>ionizing</b> radiation and relation between medical diagnosticradiation exposure and cancer risk. Many unnecessary <b>ionizing</b> radiation applications are performed in the medicalcenters and hospitals. Therefore the health staff and the patients expose to serious risks of radiation. On the other hand, recently some studies, which suggested relationshipsbetween low dose <b>ionizing</b> radiation and some cancers, have been published. The relationship between low dose <b>ionizing</b> radiation and cancer can be more understandablewhen the stochastic effects of <b>ionizing</b> radiationtake into consideration. This presented review calls attention to the fact that low dose <b>ionizing</b> radiation may be an important factor for increased cancer risk. Therefore,physicians, health workers and patients have to pay maximum attention to avoid hazards of low dose <b>ionizing</b> radiation...|$|R

5|$|In some {{reactions}} between highly {{reactive metals}} (usually from Group 1 or Group 2) and highly electronegative halogen gases, or water, the atoms can be <b>ionized</b> by electron transfer, a process thermodynamically understood using the Born–Haber cycle.|$|E
5|$|Most {{extraterrestrial}} helium {{is found}} in a plasma state, with properties quite {{different from those of}} atomic helium. In a plasma, helium's electrons are not bound to its nucleus, resulting in very high electrical conductivity, even when the gas is only partially <b>ionized.</b> The charged particles are highly influenced by magnetic and electric fields. For example, in the solar wind together with <b>ionized</b> hydrogen, the particles interact with the Earth's magnetosphere, giving rise to Birkeland currents and the aurora.|$|E

40|$|The <b>ionizing</b> {{background}} of cosmic hydrogen {{is an important}} probe of the sources and absorbers of <b>ionizing</b> radiation in the post-reionization universe. Previous {{studies show that the}} ionization rate should be very sensitive to changes in the source population: as the emissivity rises, absorbers shrink in size, increasing the <b>ionizing</b> mean free path and, hence, the <b>ionizing</b> background. By contrast, observations of the <b>ionizing</b> background find a very flat evolution from z~ 2 - 5, before falling precipitously at z~ 6. We resolve this puzzling discrepancy by pointing out that, at z~ 2 - 5, optically thick absorbers are associated with the same collapsed halos that host <b>ionizing</b> sources. Thus, an increasing abundance of galaxies is compensated for by a corresponding increase in the absorber population, which moderates the instability in the <b>ionizing</b> background. However, by z~ 5 - 6, gas outside of halos dominates the absorption, the coupling between sources and absorbers is lost, and the <b>ionizing</b> background evolves rapidly. Our halo based model reproduces observations of the <b>ionizing</b> background, its flatness and sudden decline, as well as the redshift evolution of the <b>ionizing</b> mean free path. Our work suggests that, through much of their history, both star formation and photoelectric opacity in the universe track halo growth.

50|$|Typical <b>ionizing</b> {{subatomic}} particles from radioactivity include alpha particles, beta particles and neutrons. Almost all products of radioactive decay are <b>ionizing</b> because {{the energy of}} radioactive decay is typically far higher than that required to <b>ionize.</b> Other subatomic <b>ionizing</b> particles which occur naturally are muons, mesons, positrons, and other particles that constitute the secondary cosmic rays that are produced after primary cosmic rays interact with Earth's atmosphere. Cosmic rays are generated by stars and certain celestial events such as supernova explosions. Cosmic rays may also produce radioisotopes on Earth (for example, carbon-14), which in turn decay and produce <b>ionizing</b> radiation. Cosmic rays and the decay of radioactive isotopes are the primary sources of natural <b>ionizing</b> radiation on Earth referred to as background radiation. <b>Ionizing</b> radiation can also be generated artificially using X-ray tubes, particle accelerators, and any of the various methods that produce radioisotopes artificially.|$|R

5|$|About 50–80% of {{salicylate}} in {{the blood}} is bound to albumin protein, while the rest remains in the active, <b>ionized</b> state; protein binding is concentration-dependent. Saturation of binding sites leads to more free salicylate and increased toxicity. The volume of distribution is 0.1–0.2 L/kg. Acidosis increases the volume of distribution because of enhancement of tissue penetration of salicylates.|$|E
5|$|An atom is the {{smallest}} constituent unit of ordinary matter that has the properties of a chemical element. Every solid, liquid, gas, and plasma is composed of neutral or <b>ionized</b> atoms. Atoms are very small; typical sizes are around 100picometers (a ten-billionth of a meter, in the short scale).|$|E
5|$|As {{the more}} massive stars appear, they {{transform}} the cloud into an H II region (<b>ionized</b> atomic hydrogen) of glowing gas and plasma. The stellar wind and supernova explosions from these stars eventually cause the cloud to disperse, often leaving behind {{one or more}} young open clusters of stars. These clusters gradually disperse, and the stars join {{the population of the}} Milky Way.|$|E
50|$|The sign is {{commonly}} referred to as a radioactivity warning sign, but it is actually a warning sign of <b>ionizing</b> radiation. <b>Ionizing</b> radiation is a much broader category than radioactivity alone, as many non-radioactive sources also emit potentially dangerous levels of <b>ionizing</b> radiation. This includes x-ray apparatus, medical beam cannons and particle accelerators. Non-ionizing radiation can also reach potentially dangerous levels, but this warning sign is different from the trefoil <b>ionizing</b> radiation warning symbol.|$|R
40|$|Background/Aims: The {{increasing}} {{prevalence of}} <b>ionizing</b> radiation exposure has inevitably raised public {{concern over the}} potential detrimental effects of <b>ionizing</b> radiation on male reproductive system function. The detection of drug candidates to prevent reproductive system from damage caused by <b>ionizing</b> radiation is urgent. We aimed to investigate the protective role of taurine on the injury of mouse spermatocyte-derived cells (GC- 2) subjected to <b>ionizing</b> radiation. Methods: mouse spermatocytes (GC- 2 cells) were exposed to <b>ionizing</b> radiation with or without treatment of Taurine. The effect of <b>ionizing</b> radiation and Taurine treatment on GC- 2 cells were evaluated by cell viability assay (CCK 8), cell cycle and apoptosis. The relative protein abundance change was determined by Western blotting. The siRNA was used to explore whether Nrf 2 signaling {{was involved in the}} cytoprotection of Taurine. Results: Taurine significantly inhibited the decrease of cell viability, percentage of apoptotic cells and cell cycle arrest induced by <b>ionizing</b> radiation. Western blot analysis showed that taurine significantly limited the <b>ionizing</b> radiation-induced down-regulation of CyclinB 1 and CDK 1, and suppressed activation of Fas/FasL system pathway. In addition, taurine treatment significantly increased the expression of Nrf 2 and HO- 1 in GC- 2 cells exposed to <b>ionizing</b> radiation, two components in antioxidant pathway. The above cytoprotection of Taurine was blocked by siNrf 2. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that taurine has the potential to effectively protect GC- 2 cells from <b>ionizing</b> radiation- triggered damage via upregulation of Nrf 2 /HO- 1 signaling...|$|R
40|$|In this study, we have {{evaluated}} {{the interactions between}} <b>ionizing</b> radiation and a matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitor. Using Matrigel invasion assays, we show that <b>ionizing</b> radiation induced a dose-dependent increase in the invasive phenotype of cultured B 16 melanoma cells and that conditioned medium from these irradiated B 16 cells promoted endothelial cell [human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC) ] invasiveness. To determine whether the radiation-induced changes in invasive phenotype {{could be due to}} changes in MMP activation, we have tested the ability of the MMP inhibitor Metastat to modulate the <b>ionizing</b> radiation-induced invasive phenotype using both an in vitro melanoma model and a mouse s. c. tumor model. In these studies, Metastat inhibited the <b>ionizing</b> radiation-induced invasive phenotype in cultured B 16 cells and similarly inhibited the increase in HMEC invasion induced by conditioned medium from irradiated B 16 cells. Conversely, <b>ionizing</b> radiation increased B 16 MMP- 2 activity and the conditioned medium from irradiated B 16 induced HMEC MMP- 2 activity. To further investigate the interaction between <b>ionizing</b> radiation and MMP activation, we then studied the effects of <b>ionizing</b> radiation on downstream effectors of the MMP system. We found that <b>ionizing</b> radiation induced vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion by B 16 melanoma cells and that this secretion was inhibited by Metastat. Similarly, conditioned medium from irradiated B 16 was also able to increase VEGF secretion in HMECs. Moreover, <b>ionizing</b> radiation-induced melanoma cell invasiveness was partially inhibited by an anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody. In vivo, <b>ionizing</b> radiation plus concomitant Metastat yielded the greatest growth inhibition of melanoma s. c. tumors and this effect correlated with inhibition of angiogenesis as measured by both Doppler ultrasonography and platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule- 1 staining. Finally, <b>ionizing</b> radiation modulated MMP- 2, VEGF, and VEGF receptor expression in these tumor samples using immunohistochemistry. Taken together, these results suggest that there is an <b>ionizing</b> radiation-induced tumor survival pathway and a possible paracrine <b>ionizing</b> radiation-induced stimulatory pathway emanating from tumor cells toward the endothelial bed that is impeded when Metastat is given simultaneously. This model could provide in vivo evidence of the antitumor efficacy of combining a MMP inhibitor with <b>ionizing</b> radiation to target radiation-induced invasion and angiogenesis...|$|R
5|$|Io plays a {{significant}} role in shaping Jupiter's magnetic field, acting as an electric generator that can develop 400,000 volts across itself and create an electric current of 3 million amperes, releasing ions that give Jupiter a magnetic field inflated to more than twice the size it would otherwise have. The magnetosphere of Jupiter sweeps up gases and dust from Io's thin atmosphere at a rate of 1tonne per second. This material is mostly composed of <b>ionized</b> and atomic sulfur, oxygen and chlorine; atomic sodium and potassium; molecular sulfur dioxide and sulfur; and sodium chloride dust. These materials originate from Io's volcanic activity, but the material that escapes to Jupiter's magnetic field and into interplanetary space comes directly from Io's atmosphere. These materials, depending on their <b>ionized</b> state and composition, end up in various neutral (non-ionized) clouds and radiation belts in Jupiter's magnetosphere and, in some cases, are eventually ejected from the Jovian system.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that treatment of mammalian cells with <b>ionizing</b> radiation is associated with activation of gene expression. Although the signal transduction pathways stimulated by <b>ionizing</b> radiation remain unclear, our previous findings indicate that radiation induces specific genes at the transcriptional level. The present work has examined the effects of <b>ionizing</b> radiation on the transcription factor NF-kappa B. The results demonstrate that <b>ionizing</b> radiation activates DNA binding of nuclear factor (NF) kappa B. This effect was detectable at 2 grays (Gy) and reached a maximum at 5 - 20 Gy. At a dose of 20 Gy, the increase in NF-kappa B binding activity was maximal at 2 - 4 h and then declined to pretreatment levels. The results also demonstrate that <b>ionizing</b> radiation transiently increases NF-kappa B mRNA levels. However, the finding that induction of NF-kappa B binding to DNA occurs in the presence of cycloheximide indicates that <b>ionizing</b> radiation activates preexisting NF-kappa B protein. NF-kappa B exists as a cytoplasmic protein before activation. Thus, our results suggest that <b>ionizing</b> radiation induces transduction pathways which include cytoplasmic signaling events...|$|R
