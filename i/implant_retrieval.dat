40|$|It {{is hard to}} {{overstate}} the importance of <b>implant</b> <b>retrieval</b> analysis {{in the development of}} successful orthopaedic devices. Given the enormous complexity of the musculoskeletal system, no amount of preclinical testing, joint simulation, and analytic modeling can fully predict the performance of orthopaedic implants. Despite the application of the most sophisticated methodologies available during the 1990 s when so-called alternative bearings were being developed for total hip arthroplasty, there was insufficient information to predict, among other things, squeaking of ceramic-on-ceramic bearings and the adverse local tissue reactions that have been widely reported in association with metal-on-metal bearings. <b>Implant</b> <b>retrieval</b> analyses provide important and unique insights into the in situ performance of orthopaedic devices and provide critical clues into mechanisms of failure and success, the latter being determined by postmortem retrieval analyses. The findings from <b>implant</b> <b>retrieval</b> studies also provide the necessary end points for implant designers to develop preclinical testing models. Biomechanical testing, joint simulations, and analytic modeling will only be predictive of implant performance if the failure mechanisms, or end points, of the testing and modeling are congruent with the failure mechanisms observed on retrieved devices. The study by Hart et al. is an important contribution {{to our understanding of the}} performance of the current generation of large femoral head metal-on-metal devices. The large number of components analyzed in this study adds considerably to the utility and generalizability of their findings.

40|$|The most {{significant}} clinical problems {{in patients with}} total hip replacements (THR) are related to wear of these prostheses and the biological response to wear debris.

This clinically motivated research investigated mechanisms and implications of wear in alumina ceramic-on-ceramic (COC) THRs {{using a combination of}} these approaches. <b>Implant</b> <b>retrieval</b> analysis of 54 COC bearings found posterior edge loading was a normal occurrence in THRs, while anterosuperior edge loading was associated with high wear and persistent squeaking. The architectural features of the pseudocapsules surrounding 23 of these prostheses varied in response to a combination of debris, but there was no evidence tissue inflammation contributed to the THR failure. The acute inflammatory response to alumina nanoparticles was investigated further using a murine air pouch model, in which a variable synovial-like lining of macrophages and multinucleated giant cells phagocytized the nanoparticles. In addition to the air pouch model, a novel xenograft animal model was used to investigate the effects of polyethylene particles generated in patients. These were delivered to a trabecular bone defect in athymic rats via human granuloma tissues where they inhibited bone healing. Each experimental approach had limitations. However, from these multifaceted studies, one can conclude that alumina COC THRs have low wear bearings and are biocompatible, with no evidence of wear-debris related complications, even when edge loading has occurred...|$|E

Two formulations of bioactive glasses, already described in the literature, have been studied: bg A and bg F. A sodium-calcium-silicate non-bioactive glass was sprayed as a control. Young adult New Zealand White rabbits were selected as animal model. A hole was drilled from the femural intercondylar groove and a Ti 6 Al 4 V coated cylinder was <b>implanted.</b> <b>Retrievals</b> took place at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 months. For all the samples and for both preparations of bioactive glass, it was noticed that bone was in tight apposition with the coating. As time progressed, pictures were found where bone showed characters of physiological remodelling (newly formed bone substituting areas of bone resorption) close to the coating. At the interface between bone and bioactive glass coating the apposition was so tight {{that it was not}} possible to discern a clear demarcation, even at higher BSEM magnification (more than 2500 X). A second key feature in the behaviour of the bioactive glass coatings was their gradual degradation and the eventual apposition of bone directly to Ti 6 Al 4 V...|$|R
40|$|Aseptic {{loosening}} {{attributable to}} wear-related osteolysis historically {{has been the}} predominant cause of failure in THA. Advances in low-wear bearing couples show great promise to substantially reduce this long-standing problem. However, there always has been striking variability in wear rate in any given cohort of patients who are similarly implanted, with some individuals typically experiencing near order-of-magnitude elevations above group mean. Third-body wear is likely {{a major contributor to}} many of these most osteolysis-prone outliers. For the patients affected, third-body effects may obviate many of the gains otherwise achieved by contemporary bearing surface improvements. Toward heightening visibility in terms of consequences for patients, this review paper summarizes an interrelated series of investigations quantifying construct level manifestations of third-body wear. Long-term followup of a unique group of patients with elevated third-body challenge shows statistically significant and clinically important wear-rate increases. A series of finite element models, validated physically, shows the linkage of location of third-body damage with variability of volumetric wear-rate acceleration and shows the effects of various implant factors, surgeon factors, and patient factors in the presence of third-body challenge. Finally, a mechanism for third-body debris access to wear-critical locations on the bearing surface is identified analytically and corroborated in laboratory experiments and <b>implant</b> <b>retrievals...</b>|$|R
30|$|Branemark et al. {{conducted}} the first experimental trial with titanium dental implants {{and created a}} new vision by defining the term “osseointegration” in the 1960 s [1]. Despite the advances in implant technology and protocols and the accumulating evidence in the literature, implant failure/loss may still occur due to several reasons [2]. On the other hand, although dental implant therapy is a successful treatment option for edentulous patients, it may lead to undesired complications after the insertion of the implant such as implant mobility, radiolucency around the implant, and inflammation of peri-implant tissues, or subjective complaints from the patients [3]. Peri-implantitis is a major complication of implant treatment characterized by inflammation of the soft tissues surrounding implants combined with loss of bone [4]. If this complication is not treated appropriately, <b>implant</b> <b>retrieval</b> may be necessary. On the other hand, the primary reasons for an unsuccessful implant treatment include anatomical complexity, inexperience of the surgeon, poor oral hygiene, and smoking [5].|$|E

40|$|Enhancing the {{performance}} and longevity of titanium (Ti) implants {{continues to be a}} significant developmental theme in contemporary biomaterials design. Our specific focus pertains to the surface functionalisation of Ti using the bioactive lipid, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and certain phosphatase-resistant analogues of LPA. Coating survivorship to a plethora of testing regimens is required to align with due regulatory process before novel biomaterials can enter clinical trials. One of the key acceptance criteria is coating retention to the physical stresses experienced during implantation. In assessing coating stability to insertion into porcine bone we found that a subsequent in vitro assessment to confirm coating persistence was masked by abundant alkaline phosphatase (ALP) contamination adsorbed to the metal surface. Herein we report that ALP can bind to Ti {{in a matter of minutes}} by simply immersing Ti samples in aqueous solutions of the enzyme.

With experimental implant studies in rabbits, observations were also made in vivo using confocal microscopy. Cracks in both calcified cartilage and bone may be removed by infilling with calcified matrix. This may be a general repair mechanism for calcified connective tissue crack repair.

40|$|Contact mechanics, {{wear and}} {{tribology}} of hip implant devices {{have been studied}} since early implantations {{and the performance of}} the devices are becoming increasingly important. Wear and surface damage of these bearing surfaces occur through normal gait loading conditions. However, in addition to this, stripe wear patterns are observed on patient <b>implant</b> <b>retrievals</b> and following hip simulator studies. Novel computational and theoretical methods were used and developed based on advanced computer aided engineering techniques and the finite element method. Hip joint modelling and numerical methodologies of mechanical wear simulations were studied through a newly proposed scripting method. Shakedown theory and maps were referred to for studying the biotribology and contact mechanics of hip resurfacing devices under cyclic normal, severe and edge loading conditions. Through implicit and explicit finite element modelling lateral displacement and laxity based microseparation models were developed. The contact pressure under edge loading conditions was at least a factor of 2 larger than under normal loading conditions. The wear rates of both the femoral head and acetabular cup during the bedding-in period were between 1 - 3 mm 3 /mc (million cycles) and 80 - 110 mm 3 /mc based on a steady-state wear coefficient. Results showed that modelling and verifying the contact and stress results under edge loading conditions required more careful computational modelling than for normal loading conditions. The high contact pressures observed during simulations of microseparation models were consistent with the high level of wear and surface damage observed in experimental simulator studies and from patient retrievals. These methods can therefore be used as a technique to simulate wear of hip implant devices. Shakedown assessments showed that under normal, as well as edge loading and severe loading conditions the hip device remained below the elastic shakedown region of a rolling and sliding shakedown map, which is ideal for minimal surface contact and subsurface damage...|$|R

30|$|The body {{responds}} to the corrosion of an absorbable metal implant via a cascade process of protein absorption, coagulation, acute inflammation, chronic inflammation, and foreign body response. Acute interaction occurs shortly after implantation. It induces {{the formation of an}} interspace between the implant and the tissue which then is filled with a large volume of body fluid. This is followed by cellular inflammation and then proliferation to finally fill the interspace (Kim et al. 2016). The body-response phenomena have been successfully evaluated using the tools adopted from those used for inert biomaterials. The common tools for assessing absorbable metal implants are radiography, ultrasonography, micro-computed tomography (μCT) and its advanced synchrotron version (SRμCT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), blood evaluation, and histological and <b>implant</b> <b>retrieval</b> analysis (Paramitha et al. 2017). However, these methods provide segmental, discontinued and offline results, so they are mostly unable to reveal the fundamentals of in vivo corrosion of the metals which is a continuous and time-dependent process.

The {{aim of this study}} was to develop robust methodology to estimate hip center of rotation (hCoR) from preoperative computed tomography (CT) scans, using contralateral anatomy, in patients with unilateral diseased hips. Ten patients (five male, five female) with normal pelvic anatomy, and one patient with a unilateral dysplastic acetabulum were recruited from the London <b>Implant</b> <b>Retrieval</b> center image bank. 3 D models of each pelvis were generated using commercial software. Two methods for estimation of hCoR were compared. Method 1 used a mirroring technique alone. Method 2 utilized mirroring and automatic alignment.

Both methods predicted hCoR with excellent agreement to original co-ordinates (> 0. 9) in all axes. Both techniques allowed prediction of the hCoR within ± 5 [*]mm in all axes. Both techniques provided useful clinical information for planning acetabular reconstruction in patients with unilateral defects. Method 1 was less complex and is suitable for patients with developmental and degenerative pathologies.

40|$|Fatigue {{cracking}} in {{the cement}} mantle of total hip replacement {{has been identified}} as a possible cause of <b>implant</b> loosening. <b>Retrieval</b> studies and in vitro tests have found porosity in the cement may facilitate fatigue cracking of the mantle. The fatigue process has been simulated computationally using a finite element/continuum damage mechanics (FE/CDM) method and used as a preclinical testing tool, but has not considered the effects of porosity. In this study, experimental tensile and four-point bend fatigue tests were performed. The tensile fatigue S-N data were used to drive the computational simulation (FE/CDM) of fatigue in finite element models of the tensile and four-point bend specimens. Porosity was simulated in the finite element models according to the theory of elasticity and using Monte Carlo methods. The computational fatigue simulations generated variability in the fatigue life at any given stress level, due to each model having a unique porosity distribution. The fracture site also varied between specimens. Experimental validation was achieved for four-point bend loading, but only when porosity was included. This demonstrates that the computational simulation of fatigue, driven by uniaxial S-N data can be used to simulate nonuniaxial loadcases. Further simulations of bone cement fatigue should include porosity to better represent the realities of experimental models...|$|R

Methods: Previous informed consent 20 patients (both sexes, 42 years mean age, well healthy, no smokers) underwent rehabilitation of the posterior mandible with fixed prostheses, and an additional implant was inserted distally in the mandible. 68 post-extractive immediately loaded P. B. R. implants (TMI®, Pressing Dental, San Marino, Italy) were inserted having minimum implant diameter was 4. 2 mm and minimum length was 13 mm. In 10 patients the additional implants were put into nonfunctional immediate loading with a fixed provisional prosthesis on the same day of the implant surgery, whereas in the other 10 patients, the implants were loaded after 75 days. The implant stability quotients at implant insertion were 69 and 66 for the early loaded implants and 68 and 76 for the immediate <b>implants.</b> Before <b>retrieval,</b> the immediate <b>implants</b> were clinically osseointegrated and were not mobile.

In a 5 year period, 37 root form implants were retrieved because of mobility and underwent histological examination. Thin ground sections were obtained from each implant.

A scarce inflammatory cell infiltrate was present in the connective tissue of some specimens. In about 10 percent of specimens, the epithelium tended to surround the total perimeter of the implant.

However, rapid gaseous evolution hindered its further use. Renewed interest of it as biomaterial has re-emerged recently on orthopedic and cardiovascular applications, but the use on tissue engineering was rarely explored despite its good biocompatibility. Degradation properties and host response of AM 50 A, AM 60 B, AZ 91 alloys and 99. 95 % Mg are investigated in this paper. Polished Mg and Mg alloys treated with concentrated NaOH and DMEM were implanted subcutaneously into a mouse for 6 months. X-ray investigations were conducted twice a week for the first two weeks and weekly thereafter, but there was no significant gas formation observed for AM 50 A, AM 60 B and AZ 91 D. After <b>implant</b> <b>retrieval,</b> some gas bubbles were detected under the fibrous layer covering the implants. This implies that a lack of gas pocket on an X-ray image is insufficient for the declaration of a lack of gaseous accumulation. Moreover it could be observed that the Mg alloys under investigation did not degrade fast in the body. In fact there was nearly no observable dimensional change for the alloys (except the 99. 95 % Mg) after implantation. AZ 91, a commonly used alloy on literatures, was found with much more pitting corrosion than commercially available AM 50 A and AM 60 B alloys. This suggests that the use of AZ 91 to illustrate the relatively better corrosion profile of another alloy may be misleading. Link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|To treat {{skeletal}} {{conditions such}} as bone infections, osteoporotic fractures, and osteosarcoma, it would be ideal to introduce drugs directly to the affected site. Localized drug delivery from the bone implants is a promising alternative to systemic drug administration. In this study we investigated electrochemically nanoengineered Ti wire implants with titania nanotubes (TNTs), as minimally invasive drug-releasing implants for the delivery of drugs directly into the bone tissue. Since trabecular bone in vivo contains a highly interconnected bone marrow, we sought to {{determine the influence of}} marrow on drug release and diffusion. Electrochemical anodization of Ti wires (length 10 mm) was performed to create an oxide layer with TNTs on the surface, followed by loading with a fluorescent model drug, Rhodamine B (RhB). Cores of bovine trabecular bone were generated from the sternum of a young steer, and were processed to have an intact bone marrow, or the marrow was removed. RhB-loaded TNTs/Ti wires were inserted into the bone cores, which were then cultured ex vivo using the ZetOS bioreactor system to maintain bone viability. Release and diffusion of RhB inside the bone was monitored using fluorescence imaging and different patterns of drug transport in {{the presence or absence of}} marrow were observed. Scanning electron microscopy of the <b>implants</b> after <b>retrieval</b> from bone cores confirmed survival of the TNTs structures.

This relationship was investigated using a sheep animal model. MethodsBoth medial femoral condyles of 12 sheep were operated. The implants, were inserted in the weight-bearing surface at different heights relative to the surrounding cartilage. Euthanasia was performed at 6 or 12 weeks. After <b>retrieval,</b> <b>implant</b> height was analyzed using laser scanning. Damage to the opposing tibial cartilage was evaluated macroscopically and microscopically according to the modified Mankin score. ResultsTwenty-two knees were available for evaluation and showed cartilage lesions ranging from severe damage (Mankin stage 11) to almost pristine conditions (Mankin stage 1). There was {{a strong correlation between}} implant height and cartilage damage. Standard deviation from the aimed implant height was 0. 47  mm. ConclusionsOur results showed significant surgical imprecision and protruding implants imposed severe cartilage damage. We therefore suggest implants should be placed recessed (approx. 0. 5  mm) below the surrounding cartilage in this animal model. These results encourage further studies of metallic implants yet the utmost precision regarding position is required...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{trends in}} {{clinical}} implantology {{include the use}} of endosseous dental implant surfaces embellished with nano-sized modifications. The current study was initiated to evaluate the mechanical properties, as well as the potential beneficial effects, of electrosprayed CaP nanoparticle-coated (nano-CaP) implants on the in vivo osteogenic response, compared with grit-blasted, acid-etched (GAE) implant surfaces as controls. For this purpose nano-CaP coatings were deposited on cylindrical screw-type (St) implants and implanted bilaterally into the iliac crest of goats for 6 weeks. In addition to histological and histomorphometrical analyses, insertion torque and removal torque values were measured on <b>implant</b> placement and <b>retrieval,</b> respectively. The present study showed similar insertion and removal torque values for nano-CaP-coated and GAE control implants, with no statistically significant increase in torque value during the implant period for either group. With regard to bone-implant contact and peri-implant bone volume, {{no significant differences were found}} between nano-CaP-coated and GAE implants after 6 weeks implantation. In conclusion, this study has demonstrated that in situations in which implants are placed in a non-compromised situation using a standard press fit implantation strategy the performance of electrosprayed nano-CaP coatings is comparable with GAE implants, both with respect to implant fixation and bone healing response...|$|R
40|$|The {{biologic}} behavior, i. e., {{the degradation}} of hydroxyapatite (HA) in the human body, is of relevance for clinicians. The present investigation is a long-term (20 -year) histologic and histomorphometric evaluation of dense HA used in postextraction sockets. Dense HA particles were used in a patient in postextraction alveolar sockets to maintain the alveolar ridge height. The patient returned after 20 years for implant treatment. A ridge remodeling was necessary during implant insertion surgery, and the HA/bone tissue was harvested with bone-cutting forceps from the canine and premolar area. The specimen was processed for histology and histomorphometry at the <b>Implant</b> <b>Retrieval</b> Centre, Dental School, University of Chieti-Pescara. Most of the particles (56 %) were surrounded partially by bone, whereas some particles (39 %) were surrounded completely. At higher magnification, bone was {{in close contact with}} the particles, and neither gaps nor fibrous tissues were present at the bone-biomaterial interface. Microscopically, the particles had a dense appearance. In only a few fields, it was possible to observe that the outer part of some particles had detached from the original particles' surface. Histomorphometry showed that bone represented 25. 4 % +/- 3. 2 %, marrow spaces represented 41. 3 % +/- 5. 2 %, and residual HA particles represented 38. 1 % +/- 4. 1 %. Intimate binding between bone and HA particles was present after a long-term implantation period (20 years). The fact that HA particles were surrounded closely by bone is very promising for the long-term stability of the augmentation...|$|E
40|$|Implant {{failure is}} one of the major {{concerns}} in the biomaterials field. Several factors have been related to the fail but in general these biomaterials do not exhibit comparable physical, chemical or biological properties to natural tissues and ultimately, these devices can lead to chronic inflammation and foreign-body reactions. Starch-based biodegradable materials and composites have shown promising properties for a wide range of biomedical applications as well as a reduced capacity to elicit a strong reaction from immune system cells in vitro. In this work, blends of corn starch with ethylene vinyl alcohol (SEVA-C), cellulose acetate (SCA) and polycaprolactone (SPCL), as well as hydroxyapatite (HA) reinforced starch-based composites, were investigated in vivo. The aim of the work was to assess the host response evoked for starch-based biomaterials, identifying the presence of key cell types. The tissues surrounding the implant were harvested together with the material and processed histologically for evaluation using immunohistochemistry. At <b>implant</b> <b>retrieval</b> there was no cellular exudate around the implants and no macroscopic signs of an inflammatory reaction in any of the animals. The histological analysis of the sectioned interface tissue after immunohistochemical staining using ED 1, ED 2, CD 54, MHC class II and a/b antibodies showed positively stained cells for all antibodies, except for a/b for all the implantation periods, where it was different for the various polymers and for the period of implantation. SPCL and SCA composites were the materials that stimulated the greatest cellular tissue responses, but generally biodegradable starch-based materials did not induce a severe reaction for the studied implantation times, which contrasts with other types of degradable polymeric biomaterials.

40|$|Purpose: To compare three {{different}} lateral sinus elevation procedures concerning {{new bone formation}} by using micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) of retrieved implants. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-four consecutive partially dentate patients {{with a mean age}} of 64 years were included in the study and provided with 30 sinus elevation procedures. Three procedures for lateral sinus elevation were used: lateral sinus elevation with replacement of bone window and without bone graft (BW), lateral sinus elevation and covering osteotomy site with a collagen membrane and without bone graft (CM), and lateral sinus elevation with autogenous bone graft (ABG). Experimental implants were retrieved after 7 months of healing and analyzed by micro-CT. RESULTS: One implant was found not to be integrated at the time of <b>implant</b> <b>retrieval.</b> This implant belonged to group CM and was excluded when calculating bone-to-implant contact (BIC) and intrasinus bone levels. The integrity of the lateral sinus bony wall was determined at the time of implant removal. In group ABG, all lateral sinus walls were ossified. In group BW, one lateral sinus wall was not completely ossified and in group CM, two lateral sinus walls. There were no statistical differences in %BIC between the groups: 93. 5 % (BW), 92. 0 % (CM) and 93. 5 % (ABG). Additionally, no statistical differences were found in apical intrasinus bone levels between the groups. When surfaces were compared within the same implant, a statistical difference was found between the apicobuccal distance and the apicolingual distance. The mean apicobuccal distances/apicolingual distances were 0. 6 mm/ 1. 2 mm for the BW group, 0. 5 mm/ 0. 8 mm for the CM group, and 0. 6 mm/ 0. 8 mm for the ABG group (P =. 003). CONCLUSIONS: All three procedures were statistically equal when new bone formation was compared. Most of the examined implants' apices were not covered with bone at the time of retrieval...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Introduction: Although the {{presence}} of mineralized tissues at the interface with blade implants has been reported, the view that blade implants cannot integrate still persists. Blades are the immediately loaded implants with the longest clinical history, so their histological evaluation may give results applicable to root-form implants. The aim of the present retrospective study was a histological evaluation of the peri-implant tissues in immediately loaded human blade implants retrieved after a long loading history. Materials and method: The archives of the <b>Implant</b> <b>Retrieval</b> Center were retrospectively searched (1989 - 2009) to look for retrieved human blade implants. Only the blade implants that corresponded to the following inclusion criteria were analysed: 1) presence of healthy peri-implant soft tissues, with no bleeding on probing; 2) absence of mobility; 3) absence of pain upon percussion; 4) no signs of bone or soft tissue pathology at implant retrieval; 5) absence of a peri-implant radiolucency and radiographical presence of mineralized tissues; 6) fabrication and insertion of an interim implant-supported prosthesis {{on the day of}} implant surgery. Out of 85 retrieved blade implants found, only 31 met all the inclusion criteria and were retrieved for different causes, after a loading history varying from 2 to 23 years. Results: Histologically, bone was in close and tight contact with the implants surface and no gaps or connective fibrous tissues were present at the implant-bone interface. The peri-implant bone was compact, mature, with {{the presence}} of small marrow spaces and Haversian canals. Many osteons were in contact with the implant surface. Most Haversian systems ran perpendicular to the major axis of the blades. In some fields it was possible to observe {{the presence of}} a few osteoblasts. Remodeling areas were present. Mean bone to implant contact percentage was, for all 31 implants, 43...|$|E
40|$|The use of CoCrMo alloys in {{biomedical}} applications {{has come}} under scrutiny recently due to unacceptable revision rates of certain hip resurfacing and total hip arthroplasty designs. Failure analysis has demonstrated that solid and soluble wear debris and corrosion products, released from the joints have resulted in adverse local tissue reactions (ALTR), pseudo-tumour formation and ultimately <b>implant</b> <b>retrieval</b> and replacement. In order to improve the surface properties of a wrought CoCrMo alloy, a low energy high current pulsed electron beam surface treatment process was investigated. Samples were irradiated at two cathode voltages of 15 and 35 kV at pulse numbers of 1, 15 and 25. At low beam energies a polishing effect was observed {{as a result of}} surface melting. At higher beam energies a higher Ra value {{was the result of the}} formation of surface craters. Nano-indentation and scratch testing of the treated surface were carried out using a nano-indenter. Depth profiling nano-indentation was performed using a Berkovich tip in load control. Loading was performed in 8 mN increments up to 160 mN at a rate of 3. 5 mN/s, with a 60 s dwell period and 40 % unloading. The results demonstrated that the surface treatment process reduced both the modulus and the hardness of the surface in comparison to the control. Scratching was performed with a 20 ?m radius spherical diamond and loading rate of 2 mN/s up to a maximum of 100 mN, over a 1 mm scratch length. Similar scratch depths for both control and treated surfaces were observed. However, an improvement in the dynamic friction coefficient was observed at certain beam energies. These results are discussed in the light of XRD evidence that suggested rapid cooling of the surface induced preferential formation of an ?-martensite HCP phase which may be beneficial for biomedical applications. <br/...|$|E
40|$|Introduction The {{development}} of biomaterials for biomedical applications always requires extensive biological testing {{to demonstrate the}} safety of both the material and its degradation components. K-carrageenan is a naturally occurring polysaccharide which forms a hydrogel with potassium ions and the temperature-induced gelation enables its application as an in vitro cell-carrier or as an in vivo injectable system. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate these novel systems as biomaterials by in vitro biological screening and by in vivo implantation to assess for the inflammatory response. Methods In vitro evaluation: The cytotoxicity of the hydrogels was evaluated under standard tests using the L 929 cell. Furthermore, the viability and proliferation of encapsulated human adipose stem cells (hASCs) was determined by fluorescence staining and DNA quantification. In vivo evaluation: discs of k-carrageenan were subcutaneous implanted in a wistar rats for up to 15 days. The materials (agarose-control material and k-carrageenan) were positioned into each pocket. Control animals with empty defect and empty defect injected with lipopolysaccharide were used. After each time period, the biomaterial, surrounding tissue and nearby lymph nodes were explanted and used for histological analysis and molecular biology evaluation. Results The cytotoxicity test and biological evaluation of k-carrageenan revealed that this polymer is not cytotoxic and enables long term viability and proliferation of cells in vitro. At <b>implant</b> <b>retrieval</b> there were no macroscopic signs of a considerable inflammatory reaction in any of the animals and no cellular exudates was formed around the implants. Conclusions The results indicated that k-carrageenan is a biocompatible material and does not cause a severe host response. These results together with those obtained regarding the properties of k-carragenan investigated under other studies indicate that theses hydrogels may be successfully applied in tissue engineering approaches.
