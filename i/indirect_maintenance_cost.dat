40|$|Change from a {{regulated}} to deregulated structure means that, the {{centralized maintenance}} {{system is not}} valid any more. In the surveyed published literature, {{there is not a}} single model which incorporates all <b>maintenance</b> <b>cost</b> components to analyze the effect of different maintenance strategies for generator companies (GENCOs). The work enclosed in this thesis demonstrates that there is a considerable requirement for accurately modelling cost components of the maintenance model, to be used in maintenance scheduling for deregulated power system, in order to attain a superior schedule with major financial and operational impact. This research investigates and models most cost factors that affect the maintenance activities of the deregulated GENCOs, and demonstrates the utilization of the developed <b>cost</b> models in <b>maintenance</b> scheduling. It also presents the data gathering process for the developed <b>maintenance</b> <b>cost</b> model. A generator maintenance scheduling model that considers direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>costs,</b> opportunity costs (i. e. loss of customer goodwill), effective maintenance strategies, failures, and interruptions is developed. A Genetic Algorithm (GA) based approach is employed to achieve maintenance schedules to various generators maintenance scenarios. An Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) approach is proposed for modelling customer goodwill. The maintenance model was redeveloped under the Reliability Centred Maintenance (RCM) strategy to analyze the effect of a maintenance strategy on <b>maintenance</b> <b>costs.</b> Case studies are presented to demonstrate the utilisation of the developed models. The investigation shows that the market prices, opportunity <b>costs</b> and <b>maintenance</b> strategy have an effect on the final maintenance schedule. The research demonstrates that the cost components are critical factors to achieve an effective maintenance schedule, and they must be considered and carefully modelled in order to reflect more realistic situation for maintenance scheduling of generator units in deregulation environment.

40|$|Over time railway {{networks}} have become complex Systems characterized by manifold types of technical components {{with a broad}} range of age distribution. De facto, about 50 percent of the life cycle costs of railway infrastructures are made up by direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>costs.</b> A remedy can be provided by a condition based preventive maintenance strategy leading to an optimized scheduling of maintenance actions taking the actual aswell as the expected future infrastructure condition into account. A prerequisite is, however, that the thousands of Kilometers of railway tracks are almost continuously monitored. Thus, a promising approach is the usage of low-cost sensors, e. g. accelerometers and gyroscopes, which can be installed on common in-line freight and passenger trains. Due to ambiguous data records a credible classification of railway track irregularities directly from these data is challenging. Alternatively to this pure data-driven approach, in this paper a novel hybrid Approach is presented. To this end, a simplified vehicle Suspension model is applied for the purpose of railway track condition monitoring by analyzing the dynamic railway track - Train interactions. The inversion of the model can be used to recalculate the actual inputs (irregularities) of the monitored system (rail surface) which have caused recorded System Responses (dynamic vehicle reactions and acceleration data, respectively). These recalculated inputs are a sound Basis of subsequent data-driven condition monitoring analyses. In this preliminary study, a classification algorithm is implemented to identify a simulated railway track irregularity automatically...|$|R

40|$|A {{majority}} of the direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>costs</b> in {{the life cycle of}} aircraft stems from the consequences of decisions taken during the initial maintenance program development. In particular, the preventive and corrective maintenance requirements, which greatly influence both the system availability and life cycle cost, need to be defined in order to perform only those preventive actions that are absolutely necessary and costeffective. Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM) is a systematic methodology used to identify the preventive maintenance tasks that are necessary to realize the inherent reliability of equipment at the lowest possible cost. Developing a scheduled maintenance program by means of RCM consists of identifying those preventive tasks which are both applicable (technically feasible) and effective (worth doing). An applicable maintenance task must satisfy the requirements of the type of failure to restore the item's initial performance capability. To be effective, a preventive maintenance task must lead to a reduced risk (or expected loss) of the consequence classes to a level which is acceptable to the user. In the design development phase, in order to identify the most cost effective solution, a design trade-off study is needed. This involves choosing the correct balance of the cost of consequences of failure and its correction, with their cost of prevention. However, during initial aircraft maintenance program development, lack of a methodology that supports the assessment of the operational consequences of failures has made the costeffectiveness analysis of maintenance tasks a challenging issue. This might reduce the accuracy of the analysis, which results in higher <b>maintenance</b> <b>costs</b> and may decreases the punctuality of operation, which ultimately increases the total aircraft life cycle cost. The {{purpose of this study is}} to develop a methodology for identifying different operational consequences and associated costs caused by aircraft system failure, in order to facilitate and enhance the capability of taking correct and efficient decisions when analyzing the cost-effectiveness of maintenance tasks. Some empirical studies of possible scenarios involving aircraft failures and their operational consequences for a commercial airline have been performed. Empirical data were extracted through document studies and interviews, guided by the application of an Event Tree Analysis (ETA). The analysis was performed together with experienced practitioners from both an aircraft manufacturer and commercial airlines, which contributed to a continuous verification of the outcomes of the study. Finally, the study has also estimated the associated cost of the identified operational consequences of failures. In order to quantify the operational consequences of failures, in the absence of adequate and reliable data, a methodology using pair-wise comparison technique has been applied to extract judgments of experts efficientlyGodkänd; 2007; 20071203 (ysko...|$|R

Materials and Methods: A literature search was conducted using the following set of terms plus some additional hand searching: "dental implants" (Mesh) AND ("cost") OR "maintenance" OR "healthcare policy" OR "access to care" OR "third party" OR "economic") AND ((" 1995 / 01 / 01 "[PDat]:' 2009 / 12 / 31 "[PDat]) AND (Humans[Mesh]) AND (English[lang])). Results: After a review of the 466 titles and abstracts identified by the search, 18 articles were accepted for further consideration, as some attempt at economic outcome measures was made. An additional four articles were identified by hand searching. The 22 accepted articles were grouped into four basic categories: (1) measure of costs of treatment (direct, <b>indirect,</b> and <b>maintenance</b> <b>costs),</b> (2) cost-effectiveness mathematical modeling applied to simulate the lifetime paths and cost of treatment, (3) cost-effectiveness analysis/cost-minimization, and (4) willingness-to-pay, willingness-to-accept. Attempts at determining the costs of treatment varied widely. When the OMERACT filters were applied to the various measures it was felt that discrimination and/or feasibility was a problem for most of the current economic outcome measures. Conclusions: Measures of cost-benefit, cost-effectiveness, and cost-utility are currently the gold standard; however, feasibility of such analyses is an issue.
