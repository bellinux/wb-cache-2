This proposed standard defines an archive reference model and service categories for the intermediate and indefinite long term storage of data obtained from, or used in conjunction with, space missions. This is the first step needed before adopting or developing specific standards needed to support archive services. These standards will allow new countries entering the space field to have pre-defined formats for the archiving of data and so avoid the learning process and the consequent period of having data that is not easily useable on an international basis. Panel 2 plans to have the OAIS Reference Model Standard as an <b>ISO</b> Draft <b>International</b> <b>Standard</b> by October 98. 1...|$|R

50|$|On 2009 September 18 the ISO stated officially {{that the}} JT {{specification}} {{has been accepted}} for publication as an ISO Publicly Available Specification (PAS). End of August 2010 the Ballot for the new Work Item Proposal for JT as <b>ISO</b> <b>International</b> <b>Standard</b> was started by ProSTEP iViP. ProSTEP iViP thereby aimed {{on the one hand}} to publish the JT file format specification as ISO Standard and, on the other hand, to harmonize this undertaking with the new STEP AP 242 development, so that JT and STEP (especially STEP AP 242 XML) can be used together to assure major benefits within industrial data exchange scenarios. On 2012 December, JT has been officially published as ISO 14306:2012 (ISO JT V1) as a 3D visualization format, based on version 9.5 of JT specifications released by Siemens PLM Software. Through this publication via ISO, {{for the first time a}} completely neutral and royalty-free specification of JT was available.|$|E
50|$|When a beam is {{measured}} with a laser beam profiler, {{the wings of the}} beam profile influence the D4σ value more than the center of the profile since the wings are weighted by the square of its distance, x2, {{from the center of the}} beam. If the beam does not fill more than a third of the beam profiler’s sensor area, then there will be a significant number of pixels at the edges of the sensor that register a small baseline value (the background value). If the baseline value is large or if it is not subtracted out of the image, then the computed D4σ value will be larger than the actual value because the baseline value near the edges of the sensor are weighted in the D4σ integral by x2. Therefore, baseline subtraction is necessary for accurate D4σ measurements. The baseline is easily measured by recording the average value for each pixel when the sensor is not illuminated. The D4σ width, unlike the FWHM and 1/e2 widths, is meaningful for multimodal marginal distributions — that is, beam profiles with multiple peaks — but requires careful subtraction of the baseline for accurate results. The D4σ is the <b>ISO</b> <b>international</b> <b>standard</b> definition for beam width.|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{revisit the}} early {{publications}} of Ed Brinksma devoted, {{on the one}} hand, {{to the definition of}} the formal description technique LOTOS (<b>ISO</b> <b>International</b> <b>Standard</b> 8807 : 1989) for specifying communication protocols and distributed systems, and, on the other hand, to two proposals (Extended LOTOS and Modular LOTOS) for making LOTOS a simpler and more expressive language. We examine how this scientific agenda has been dealt with during the last decades. We review the successive enhancements of LOTOS that led to the definition of three languages: E-LOTOS (<b>ISO</b> <b>International</b> <b>Standard</b> 15437 : 2001), then LOTOS NT, and finally LNT. We present the software implementations (compilers and translators) developed for these new languages and report about their use in various application domains...|$|E
