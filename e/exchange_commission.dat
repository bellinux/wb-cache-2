50|$|Furthermore, for {{a trader}} or {{arbitrageur}} to combine different exchanges and/or bookmakers for a profit requires a substantial price differential if a profit {{is in fact}} to be made once the <b>exchange's</b> <b>commission</b> is taken into account. Even between exchanges, such large price differences are rare, brief and usually involve relatively small stakes. Fortunately for traders, almost all betting <b>exchanges</b> charge <b>commission</b> on net winnings only and charge no commission {{at all in the}} event of a net loss.

The U.S. Securities and <b>Exchange</b> <b>Commission</b> (SEC) began an investigation, and rival Houston competitor Dynegy offered to purchase the company at a very low price. The deal failed, and on December 2, 2001, Enron filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. Enron's $63.4 billion in assets made it the largest corporate bankruptcy in U.S. history until WorldCom's bankruptcy the next year.|$|E
