5|$|My first {{memory of}} {{fragrance}} is my mother, {{and as a}} very young girl, hearing her footsteps... Her stilettos click, click, clicking on the hardwood floor and she wore a beautiful fragrance and she would walk past me and it would just stay in the room. It left a warm feeling every time I thought about her scent. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> icons that I respect {{and they all have}} their own fragrance so I thought {{it was time for me}} to have my own.|$|E

500|$|Two {{weeks after}} the Dade County vote, a {{gardener}} {{who worked for the}} City of San Francisco named Robert Hillsborough was stabbed 15 times in his face and chest while his attackers chanted [...] "Faggot" [...] at him. Hillsborough's mother and San Francisco mayor George Moscone blamed Bryant's rhetoric for his death and 200,000San Francisco residents joined a memorial demonstration for him. Mrs. Hillsborough brought a $5 million civil suit against Anita Bryant claiming Hillsborough's attackers said [...] "Here's one for Anita". She said, [...] "I didn't think much about Anita Bryant's campaign at first. Now that my son's murder has happened, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Bryant campaign a lot.

[...] Bryant, Green, Mike Thompson and Save Our Children were dismissed from the suit in November 1977.|$|E
500|$|Twenty-six bars {{from the}} last two lines of the chorus are copied almost identically. The lyrics of these same lines, [...] "Through the sycamores the candle lights are gleaming, On {{the banks of the}} Wabash, far away" [...] is also {{borrowed}} from, and changed to [...] "the gleaming candle lights, are still shining bright, through the sycamore trees". The first part of the chorus, [...] "Oh the moonlight's fair tonight along the Wabash", is also reused and changed to [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> moonlight on the Wabash, then I long for my Indiana home". Under Theodore's guidance, Dresser's estate accused Hanley of plagiarism and threatened to bring a suit against Paull-Pioneer Music Corporation, the publisher of [...] "Back Home Again in Indiana". Despite lengthy discussions no action was ever taken to resolve the dispute, largely due to the ambiguous nature of U.S. copyright laws in the early 20th century and the estate's lack of finances.|$|E
