40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model for}} supporting and coordinating distributed software process enactment by both human and computerized agents. Enactment {{is supported by a}} general Process Support System (PSS), which implements the coordination model presented in this paper. The model includes abstractions of activities, artifacts, agents and their behavior and relationships. Automatic enactment, i. e., invoking tools and requesting operations from them, is supported by several techniques, e. g., tool invocation servers or callbacks to the client. Parameterized finite state machines are used to coordinate the activities and the agents performing the work. The prototype system, currently under development, will be evaluated in <b>industrial</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>projects</b> performed in cooperation with several Finnish software houses. 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Groupware is {{a typical}} example of an {{application}} domain in which requirements are hard to elicit and keep changing before, during, and after {{the introduction of the}} system. This calls for an evolutionary implementation approach. Several socio-technical models give an explanation of the interaction between the technical and the social system, i. e., the software and its organis-ational environment, but these models have not yet led to a clear method for evolutionary implementation. In order to arrive at such a method, we need a theoretical framework for how this adaptation process takes place. Adaptive Structuration Theory (AST) is a good candidate for such a framework. The BITE research project at the University of Twente aims to operationalise the concepts of AST through application in several <b>industrial</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>projects.</b> Based on these pilots we will develop a method for evolutionary implementation of groupware. 1.

Many {{companies}} experience extensive product rework and failure cost due to ineffective Verification, Validation, and Testing (VVT). Therefore, {{there is a great}} potential benefit in streamlining and optimizing the VVT process. To that end, a consortium of eight European companies, research institutes, and organizations conducted the SysTest project. The stated aim of SysTest was to “…decrease product development cost and time to market by 10 %”. SysTest intended to achieve this aim by developing a generic methodology and process model to support the process of systems ’ VVT. This paper describes the results of using the SysTest products in six <b>industrial</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>projects.</b> The diverse pilot projects have shown that the SysTest products are applicable in different industries. Specifically, each project was able to use most components of the SysTest methodology and process model and the pilot projects conducted by the industrial partners exhibited an average of nearly 8 % project cost reduction with standard deviation of about 15 %...|$|E
40|$|The use of Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) {{software}} {{has become}} more and more important in state-of-the-art and state-of-the-practice software and system development. The use of COTS software promises faster time-to-market, reduced development cost, increased productivity, and the possibility for companies to focus on their own core competencies. At the same time COTS software raises risks such as economic instability of the COTS software vendor, unknown quality properties of the COTS software in use, and side effects of the COTS software on the final product. Typically, COTS-based development - in parallel to the traditional development cycle, e. g. waterfall, spiral - consists of four phases. The first phase - COTS assessment and selection - is the most crucial phase in the COTS-based cycle since long-term decisions on which COTS software will be used in a software system are made here. A late recognition that the "wrong" COTS software was used can become extremely costly for a software organization. This paper presents a repeatable, cost-efficient, and systematic method for performing measurement-based COTS assessment and selection. Moreover, cost/benefit analysis results of two <b>industrial</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>projects,</b> in which the method was successfully applied, are presented...|$|E

40|$|In this report, we {{describe}} {{an approach that}} integrates a mathematical specification language with more traditional software design techniques to yield a practicable methodology for the specification of safety-critical control systems. To manage complexity and to foster separation of concerns, the system design model {{is divided into three}} views: the architectural view, specified with object and class diagrams; the reactive view, specified with statecharts; and the functional view, specified with Z. A systematic relationship between the reactive and the functional view entails proof obligations to guarantee semantic compatibility. We illustrate this approach with a case study on controlling a heavy hydraulic press. 1 Introduction Formal methods have been seriously applied during the past years in various <b>industrial</b> and academic <b>pilot</b> <b>projects</b> as reported, for instance, in [3].

40|$|<b>Pilot</b> <b>projects</b> {{are widely}} applied in water management.

Sixteen <b>pilot</b> <b>projects</b> conducted within the WINN innovation program in the Netherlands are analysed and three floodplain restoration <b>pilot</b> <b>projects</b> in the Rhine Basin are studied in-depth. These include the <b>pilot</b> <b>projects</b> on the floodplains of Beuningen (the Netherlands), in Polder Altenheim (Germany) and in Basel (Switzerland).

The challenges that coastal policy faces, {{the frequency with}} which <b>pilot</b> <b>projects</b> are implemented, and the criticisms regarding their efficacy make it interesting and relevant to study <b>pilot</b> <b>projects</b> in this policy field. This dissertation on ‘Narrative perspectives on the development of coastal pilot projects’ aims to deepen understanding of the development of <b>pilot</b> <b>projects</b> in their actor-networks. It utilises the concept of narratives both in the conceptualisation of the development of <b>pilot</b> <b>projects</b> and in the design of a research strategy, choosing to learn from the experiences of actors involved in coastal <b>pilot</b> <b>projects.</b> The Sand Engine in the Netherlands and Ystad’s sand nourishment project in Scania, Sweden, are the two coastal <b>pilot</b> <b>projects</b> from which empirical data are drawn.

Three types of <b>pilot</b> <b>projects</b> have been identified: research, mana-gerial and political-entrepreneurial <b>pilot</b> <b>projects.</b> To different extent all types of <b>pilot</b> <b>project</b> have the following effects: biophysical- and actor-network system response, knowledge development and diffusion into wider public policy. The Beuningen pilot demonstrated that anticipated evidence can be sufficient to change policy or management due to its strong mana-gerial characteristics and {{that the lack of}} policy ambassadors limits its insti-tutionalization.

In addition, USDA did not complete an evaluation on or prepare a report evaluating the <b>pilot</b> <b>project</b> at 5 young turkey plants and has no plans to do so because of the small sample size.
