25|$|The band's sound {{usually has}} {{elements}} of punk rock, pop and alternative rock. <b>I</b> <b>Brought</b> <b>You</b> My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love, the band's debut album, features a raw sound that has guitar riffs, very energetic vocals and sometimes screaming. The album {{is considered an}} emo album with strong influences from punk rock and hardcore punk. <b>I</b> <b>Brought</b> <b>You</b> My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love also has some influences from heavy metal. The second album Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge {{was one of the}} albums that launched the emo genre into the mainstream. The band's album The Black Parade lacks the post-hardcore elements featured on the first two My Chemical Romance albums and features elements of pop punk, emo and punk rock. The fourth My Chemical Romance album Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys continues the band's alternative rock and pop punk sound with some new elements of power pop, pop rock and electronic rock.|$|E

2500|$|The {{band was}} formed by {{frontman}} Gerard Way and drummer Matt Pelissier soon after the September 11 attacks. Witnessing the World Trade Center towers fall influenced Way's life {{to the extent that}} he decided to start a band. Way wrote the song [...] "Skylines and Turnstiles" [...] to express his feelings about September 11 and shortly thereafter, Ray Toro was recruited as the band's guitarist because at the time Way could not sing and play the guitar simultaneously. The name of the band was suggested by bass guitarist Mikey Way, younger brother of Gerard, who was working in a Barnes & Noble when he was struck by the title of a book by Irvine Welsh named [...] The first recording sessions were undertaken in Pelissier's attic, where the songs [...] "Our Lady of Sorrows" [...] and [...] "Cubicles" [...] were recorded. The band refers to those sessions as [...] "The Attic Demos." [...] After hearing the demo and dropping out of college, Mikey Way decided to join the band. While with Eyeball Records, the band met Frank Iero, the lead vocalist and guitarist for Pencey Prep. Following Pencey Prep's split in 2002, Iero became a member of My Chemical Romance, just days prior to the recording of the band's debut album. They recorded their debut album, <b>I</b> <b>Brought</b> <b>You</b> My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love, just three months after the formation of the band and released it in 2002 through Eyeball Records. The album was produced by Thursday frontman Geoff Rickley after the band became friends with him while playing shows in New Jersey. Iero played guitar on two of the tracks, one of which was [...] "Early Sunsets Over Monroeville." [...] During this time, the band was booked at the infamous venue, Big Daddy's, where they began to receive more attention.|$|E
