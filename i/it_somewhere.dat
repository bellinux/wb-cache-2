5|$|Perhaps {{the best-known}} alleged witches' coven in English legal history {{took place in}} Malkin Tower on 10 April 1612. Eight of those {{attending}} were subsequently arrested and tried for causing harm by witchcraft, seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house may have been demolished shortly after the trials. The only firm evidence for its location comes from the official account by the clerk of the court, Thomas Potts, who places <b>it</b> <b>somewhere</b> in the Forest of Pendle. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.|$|E
5|$|More {{proposals}} {{were made in}} 2007. Replacing the bridge would cost $7–8 million and take two years to complete. Rehabilitation would require bringing the bridge up to code so it could carry loads of up to 40 tons (36 tonnes). A preservation group formed to oppose a replacement. Its founder compared the bridge to the Dingmans Ferry Bridge on the Pennsylvania–New Jersey border, which carries similar traffic loads. One possibility is to replace the bridge, and move the antique structure elsewhere in Sullivan County, since it is a popular tourist attraction. In June 2008, a compromise was made defining {{the possibility of a}} $12 million bridge to replace the 104-year-old deteriorating structure. PennDOT has suggested that they will let anyone preserve the bridge by taking <b>it</b> <b>somewhere</b> else. However, there has been no response, and plans for the new bridge were initially scheduled to begin by 2010.|$|E
5|$|Under {{terrestrial}} conditions, {{conversion of}} one element to another is very rare. Therefore, {{the amount of}} carbon on Earth is effectively constant. Thus, processes that use carbon must obtain it from somewhere and dispose of <b>it</b> <b>somewhere</b> else. The paths of carbon in the environment form the carbon cycle. For example, photosynthetic plants draw carbon dioxide from the atmosphere (or seawater) and build it into biomass, as in the Calvin cycle, a process of carbon fixation. Some of this biomass is eaten by animals, while some carbon is exhaled by animals as carbon dioxide. The carbon cycle is considerably more complicated than this short loop; for example, some carbon dioxide is dissolved in the oceans; if bacteria do not consume it, dead plant or animal matter may become petroleum or coal, which releases carbon when burned.|$|E

25|$|Holmenkollen was {{the venue}} of the Nordic skiing during the 1952 Winter Olympics. Two events {{were held at}} Holmenkollbakken: ski jumping and the jumping part of Nordic combined. The exact number of people {{attending}} the ski jumping event on 24 February is not known, but <b>it</b> <b>somewhere</b> between 120,000 and 150,000, with the official report stating 143,000.

25|$|Numerous early {{leaders of}} the Church, {{including}} Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball, and George Q. Cannon, taught that the Garden of Eden itself was located in nearby Jackson County, Missouri, {{but there are no}} surviving first-hand accounts of that doctrine being taught by Joseph Smith himself. LDS doctrine is unclear as to the exact location of the Garden of Eden, but tradition among Latter-Day Saints places <b>it</b> <b>somewhere</b> in the vicinity of Adam-ondi-Ahman, or in Jackson County.|$|E
25|$|Quests are {{typically}} grouped {{into one of}} four categories: kill quests, gather quests, delivery quests, and escort quests. However, quests can include more than one mission, such as gathering something and transporting <b>it</b> <b>somewhere.</b> Quests can be linked together to form quest series or chains. In this manner, quests are used to provide the player with further background to the setting their characters are in. This mechanism {{is also used to}} advance any story or plot the game might have.|$|E
25|$|The wives, if {{suspected}} of {{speaking about the}} unit's existence, can cause their husbands to be expelled and returned to regular Army service. Colonel Ryan has stated, time and again, that this can ruin a soldier's career, {{as well as his}} marriage, and has also stated that he will not hesitate to destroy families to preserve the unit's security. He has also threatened the wives with closing the unit down, and restarting <b>it</b> <b>somewhere</b> else under another cover—forcing the uprooting of all families involved.|$|E

25|$|Mammals have {{demonstrated}} grief-like states, especially between {{a mother and}} her offspring. She will often stay close to her dead offspring for short periods of time and may investigate the reasons for the baby's non-response. For example, some deer will often sniff, poke, and look at its lifeless fawn before realising it is dead and leaving it to rejoin the herd shortly afterwards. Other animals, such as a lioness, will pick up its cub in its mouth and place <b>it</b> <b>somewhere</b> else before abandoning it.|$|E
25|$|Lee's men {{advanced}} {{with the}} five regiments in line abreast. The 3rd and 5th Virginia Cavalry regiments, led by sharpshooters, ran along the stone fence with the expectation they would find a gap in <b>it</b> <b>somewhere.</b> Pelham moved forward with Lee's men, and as he waved them through a gate in the fence, a shell exploded over his head, sending a tiny fragment into his brain, mortally wounding him. He died a few hours later. The Confederate advance was repulsed by carbine fire from the 16th Pennsylvania Cavalry and shelling from Martin's battery.|$|E
25|$|The {{recycling}} of old computers raises an important privacy issue. The old storage devices still hold private information, such as emails, passwords, {{and credit card}} numbers, which can be recovered simply by someone's using software available freely on the Internet. Deletion of a file does not actually remove the file from the hard drive. Before recycling a computer, users should remove the hard drive, or hard drives if {{there is more than}} one, and physically destroy it or store <b>it</b> <b>somewhere</b> safe. There are some authorized hardware recycling companies to whom the computer may be given for recycling, and they typically sign a non-disclosure agreement.|$|E

25|$|The {{boundaries}} of Harringay form a rough boot {{shape in the}} extreme southern centre of the borough. The western boundary of Harringay is formed by the East Coast Main Line. The northern boundary is {{to the south of}} Turnpike Lane, running parallel to <b>it,</b> <b>somewhere</b> between Sydney Road and Fairfax Road. In the northeast, the boundary roughly corresponds with a line drawn between the south of Duckett's Common and the north end of Warwick Gardens. A line due south of this point, as far as Eade Road, forms the eastern boundary. Southeast of here a line to Finsbury Park completes the southeastern limits. Finsbury Park is officially part of Harringay and forms the south western boundary.|$|E
25|$|The Yeomen of the Guard was {{immediately}} {{a hit in}} London, with a successful New York run following shortly thereafter. Percy Anderson designed the original costumes, while the set was by Hawes Craven. The first English provincial tour opened in 1888, {{and from then on}} it was a fixture in the D'Oyly Carte repertory, with at least one official touring company playing <b>it</b> <b>somewhere</b> in almost every season until the company's closure in 1982. New costumes were designed by Anderson in 1919 and 1927, and Peter Goffin designed new sets and costumes in 1940. In Australia, the opera's first authorised performance was on 20 April 1889 at the Princess Theatre, Melbourne, produced by J. C. Williamson, which gave regular performances thereafter in Australasia until the 1960s. In 1932, Yeomen became the first Gilbert and Sullivan opera to be broadcast on the radio in its entirety.|$|E
