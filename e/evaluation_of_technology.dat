His <b>evaluation</b> <b>of</b> <b>technology</b> as a shaper of human societies and psyches indicates a strong connection between historical forces and literacy practices.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of the thesis was to evaluate business potential of wireless local area networks (WLAN, Wireless LAN). At first, the scope of business potential <b>evaluation</b> <b>of</b> <b>technology</b> was introduced. Next, a general framework of business potential <b>evaluation</b> <b>of</b> <b>technology</b> based on literature was presented. In addition, convergence of cellular networks and data networks was studied {{in order to get}} an insight of current situation of mobile telecommunications industry. Finally, wireless local area networks business potential was evaluated. A wireless local area network is a data communication system, which combines data connectivity with mobility and is implemented in unlicensed frequency bands, allowing new business opportunities to emerge. The main markets of WLAN are corporate networks, public area networks and access networks. At the moment the penetration of WLAN terminals is low which derives to low demand of wireless LAN services. In addition, unlicensed spectrum forces the teleoperators to set the service price relatively low. The business potential is in integrating wireless LANs to cellular networks and in offering value added services to end users. The future of wireless LAN is to be complementary network to cellular networks. In this vision cellular networks provide voice and low data services and broadband wireless networks enable multimedia services...|$|E

30|$|When {{dealing with}} {{educational}} AR systems, {{it is also}} important to evaluate the impact of learning applications and the feasibility of incorporating them into the classrooms. Many factors are involved in this process varying from cost to staff’s acceptance. <b>Evaluation</b> <b>of</b> <b>technology</b> is an important step in design instruction, which is the process by which learning products and experiences are designed, developed, and delivered 1. Also, it is necessary to evaluate it properly so practitioners are more confident in its positive effects.

However, evaluators of technology centres report contradictory results and technology centres positive effects have also been questioned.

40|$|The Mixed Waste Management Facility, or MWMF, {{has been}} {{proposed}} as a national testbed facility for the demonstration and <b>evaluation</b> <b>of</b> <b>technologies</b> that are alternatives to incineration {{for the treatment of}} mixed low-level waste. The facility design will enable <b>evaluation</b> <b>of</b> <b>technologies</b> at pilot scale, including all aspects of the processes, from receiving and feed preparation to the preparation of final forms for disposal. The MWMF will reduce the risk <b>of</b> deploying such <b>technologies</b> by addressing the following: (1) Engineering development and scale-up. (2) Process integration and activation of the treatment systems. (3) Permitting and stakeholder issues. In light of the severe financial constraints imposed on the DOE and federal programs, DOE/HQ requested a study to assess the cost benefit for the MWMF given other potential alternatives to meet waste treatment needs. The MVVMF Project was asked to consider alternatives specifically associated with commercialization and privatization of the DOE site waste treatment operations and the acceptability (or lack of acceptability) of incineration as a waste treatment process. The result of this study {{will be one of the}} key elements for a DOE decision on proceeding with the MWMF into Final Design (KD- 2) vs. proceeding with other options...|$|R
