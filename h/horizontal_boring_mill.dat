5000|$|A {{horizontal}} {{boring machine}} or <b>horizontal</b> <b>boring</b> <b>mill</b> is a machine tool which bores holes in a horizontal direction. There are three main types [...] - [...] table, planer and floor. [...] The table type {{is the most common}} and, as it is the most versatile, it is also known as the universal type.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Horizontal</b> <b>boring</b> <b>mill</b> Large, {{accurate}} bed horizontal mills {{that incorporate}} many features from various machine tools. They are predominantly {{used to create}} large manufacturing jigs, or to modify large, high precision parts. They have a spindle stroke of several (usually between four and six) feet, and many are equipped with a tailstock to perform very long boring operations without losing accuracy as the bore increases in depth. A typical bed has X and Y travel, and is between three and four feet square with a rotary table or a larger rectangle without a table. The pendant usually provides between four and eight feet of vertical movement. Some mills have a large (30" [...] or more) integral facing head. Right angle rotary tables and vertical milling attachments are available for further flexibility.|$|E
40|$|This master's thesis {{describes}} a design of <b>horizontal</b> <b>boring</b> <b>mills.</b> The first part {{is dedicated to}} description of {{the various types of}} these machines and their accessories. There are also described drives and linear guideways. There is a list of plate <b>horizontal</b> <b>boring</b> <b>mills</b> of Czech and foreign producers. The second part of this thesis deals with designing of comlete machine's bed and its slides (X-axis). Casting of the bed and its slides are designed for universal machining to the use of rolling or hydrostatic guideways. The drive of X-axis is also designed and it works in master/slave mode. The final result of this master's thesis is a 3 D model of the machine in two variants, with hydrostatic and rolling quideways. Machining drawings of the bed for both variants are attached to this thesis...|$|R

40|$|At {{elongated}} holes boring several imperfections can occur, namely, {{the surface}} waviness and shape inaccuracies in the axial section. This research {{purpose is to}} establish the regularities of such imperfections formation depending on the technological system design parameters, on the processed material properties and on the cutting modes. Searching and establishing those common factors will allow, as early as at the technological process design stage, to choose the cutting mode optimal parameters {{as well as the}} cutting tools design parameters. As the research methodical basis, the method of <b>horizontal</b> <b>boring</b> operations mathematical modeling has been applied, taking into account the technological system variable rigidity. A mathematical model for predicting the surface imperfections formed when <b>horizontal</b> <b>boring</b> has been developed with the aim of such flaws occurrence further minimization. The developed model practical application provides the possibility to build graphs allowing the boring tool operator to choose rational cutting modes depending on the conditions of processing...|$|R

5000|$|Bullard Sr's son, Edward Payson Bullard Jr (1872-1953), {{continued}} the family machine tool business {{and brought the}} turret principle to the vertical <b>boring</b> <b>mill,</b> making it a vertical turret lathe. For a while in America during the 20th century, the name [...] "Bullard" [...] {{on the shop floor}} was something of a genericized trademark for vertical turret-head <b>boring</b> <b>mills.</b> E.P. Bullard Jr led the development of the company's multiple-spindle [...] brand machine that became an important automatic lathe in the mass production of parts for the automotive industry. Bullard Jr was president of the company for 40 years, through World War I, the interwar period, and World War II, a period during which the Bullard company was the largest machine tool builder in the U.S., and vast volumes of military matériel were produced by countless companies running Bullard machines. Bullard is now owned by Bourn& Koch, based in Rockford, Illinois. Bourn & Koch continues to provide OEM parts, service and support for their machines.|$|R

In 1770 a revolutionary horse-powered <b>horizontal</b> <b>boring</b> machine was installed in the Foundry by his successor, Jan Verbruggen which inspired Henry Maudslay (who worked at the foundry from 1783) to his inventions improving the lathe.
