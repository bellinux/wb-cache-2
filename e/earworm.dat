5|$|Helicoverpa zea earns its {{nickname}} {{the corn}} <b>earworm</b> for its widely known destruction of cornfields. The corn <b>earworm</b> feeds on {{every part of}} corn, including the kernels. Severe feeding {{at the tip of}} kernels allows entry for diseases and mold growth. Larvae begin feeding on the kernels once they have reached third instar. Larvae penetrate 9 to 15cm into the ear, with deeper penetration occurring as the kernels harden. Larvae do not eat the hard kernels, but take bites out of many kernels, lowering the quality of the corn for processing.|$|E
5|$|The corn <b>earworm</b> {{is found}} in {{temperate}} and tropical regions of North America, {{with the exception of}} northern Canada and Alaska as it cannot overwinter in these areas. Helicoverpa zea found in the eastern United States also does not overwinter successfully. They live in Kansas, Ohio, Virginia, and southern New Jersey, but survival rate is mainly affected by the severity of the winter. Corn <b>earworm</b> moths regularly migrate from southern regions to northern regions depending on winter conditions. They are also found in Hawaii, the Caribbean islands, and most of South America, including Peru, Argentina, and Brazil.|$|E
5|$|Helicoverpa zea, {{commonly}} known as the corn <b>earworm,</b> is a species (formerly in the genus Heliothis) in the family Noctuidae. The larva of the moth Helicoverpa zea is a major agricultural pest. Since it is polyphagous (feeds on many different plants) during the larval stage, the species has been given many different common names, including the cotton bollworm and the tomato fruitworm. It also consumes a wide variety of other crops.|$|E
50|$|According to {{research}} by James Kellaris, 98% of individuals experience <b>earworms.</b> Women and men experience the phenomenon equally often, but <b>earworms</b> tend to last longer {{for women and}} irritate them more. Kellaris produced statistics suggesting that songs with lyrics may account for 73.7% of <b>earworms,</b> whereas instrumental music may cause only 7.7%.|$|R

5|$|Two {{kinds of}} control {{measures}} have been advocated since the 19th century. One aims at total pest population reduction, while the other is aimed at protection of the particular crop. , integrated pest management (IPM), an array of techniques and approaches to control pests, was recommended. Practices such as deep ploughing, mechanical destruction, and trap crops are also used to kill different instars. Chemical control is widely successful, and includes the use of applying mineral oil inside the tip of each corn ear, which suffocates the young larvae. Pesticides are one method by which corn <b>earworm</b> populations are controlled; however, since they have been widely used, the insects have become resistant to many pesticides. The use of biological controls, such as the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis and various forms of nematodes, is also common, although not without their own problems. Corn <b>earworm</b> moths are not always vulnerable to the bacterium, and they are only afflicted by nematodes once the larvae have pupated and dropped to the ground.|$|E
5|$|The corn <b>earworm</b> {{is a major}} {{agricultural}} pest, with a large {{host range}} encompassing corn and many other crop plants. H. zea is the second-most important economic pest species in North America, next to the codling moth. The estimated annual cost of the damage is more than US$100 million, though expenditure on insecticide application has reached up to $250 million. The moth’s high fecundity, ability to lay between 500 and 3,000 eggs, polyphagous larval feeding habits, high mobility during migration, and a facultative pupal diapause {{have led to the}} success of this pest.|$|E
5|$|Female moths are {{attracted}} to flowering soybean fields. The most severe infestations occur between flowering and when pods become fully developed. Large-scale outbreak is associated with time of peak flowering, when most pods are developed, and peak moth flight, for giant. Moths are also attracted to drought stressed soybeans or fields with poor growth. Dry weather leads to quick drying of corn plants, compelling moths to leave and seek other hosts. Heavy rainfall also decreases corn <b>earworm</b> populations because it drowns pupae in their soil chambers, limits moth flight, washes eggs from leaves, and creates favorable conditions for fungal diseases that kill caterpillars.|$|E
40|$|Several {{people have}} inquired about the {{caterpillars}} now feeding inside corn whorls. The likely candidates are stalk borers, European corn borers, or corn <b>earworms.</b> Armyworms {{feed on the}} outside of the whorl and fall armyworms have not yet arrived. Specimens that have been sent to me, however, have all been corn <b>earworms.</b> Correct identification of any insect is necessary before a wise pest management decision can be made...|$|R
40|$|Other {{strategies}} for eradicating <b>earworms</b> include what British music psychologist Victoria Williamson of the University of Sheffield describes as “distract and engage. ” The most effective distractions, she explains, are verbal or musical: chanting a mantra, reciting a poem, {{listening to a}} different song, even playing an instrument. They work by activating the component of working memory involved in <b>earworms,</b> a storage and rehearsal cycle called the phonological loop. “If you fill it up with something else that occupies the same circuitry, there's not enough left to make the earworm,” Williamson says...|$|R
5000|$|Understanding {{the biology}} and {{life cycle of}} the pest is also an {{important}} factor in determining droplet size. The Agricultural Research Service, for example, has conducted tests to determine the ideal droplet size of a pesticide used to combat corn <b>earworms.</b> They found that in order to be effective, the pesticide needs to penetrate through the corn’s silk, where the <b>earworm’s</b> larvae hatch. The research concluded that larger pesticide droplets best penetrated the targeted corn silk. [...] Knowing where the pest's destruction originates is crucial in targeting the amount of pesticide needed.|$|R
25|$|Soybean {{plants are}} {{vulnerable}} {{to a wide range}} of bacterial diseases, fungal diseases, viral diseases and parasites. One important pest is the corn <b>earworm</b> moth, which is the most common and destructive pest of soybean growth in Virginia.|$|E
25|$|Depending on the species, a {{nematode}} may {{be beneficial}} or detrimental to plant health. From agricultural and horticulture perspectives, the two categories of nematodes are the predatory ones, which will kill garden pests like cutworms and corn <b>earworm</b> moths, and the pest nematodes, like the root-knot nematode, which attack plants, and those that act as vectors spreading plant viruses between crop plants. Predatory nematodes can be bred by soaking a specific recipe of leaves and other detritus in water, in a dark, cool place, and can even be purchased as an organic form of pest control.|$|E

40|$|We {{examined}} the feeding behavior of red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus) and European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) on ears of corn (Zea mavs) artificially infested with corn <b>earworms</b> (Helicoverpa zea). In 30 -minute aviary tests, redwings and starlings directed 39 to 79 % more feeding responses to ears of corn with worms than to ears without worms but they damaged the same proportion of ears {{with and without}} worms. In 3 -hour aviary tests and a field evaluation, birds damaged more ears with worms than without worms. In spite of more feeding responses directed to ears with worms, the overall damage (number of kernels eaten by birds) was similar in both groups of ears in aviary tests. Our findings indicate that <b>earworms</b> can influence feeding behavior by redwings and starlings on ears of corn. The results generally {{support the hypothesis that}} by reducing insect populations in cornfields, one can make the fields less attractive to birds. Also, because redwings and starlings actively sought <b>earworms</b> in corn ears, these abundant birds have the potential for reducing populations of these insect pests in cornfields...|$|R

50|$|Aschheim’s <b>Earworms</b> are {{a series}} of {{electrified}} plastic sculptures that produce light and music to mimick the appearance and function of the brain’s synaptic network. The name of the series comes from the German word “ohrwurm,” which means a part of a song that involuntarily replays {{over and over again in}} a person’s head. Aschheim’s inspiration for the series came from her research at San Francisco’s Memory and Aging Clinic, where she observed patients suffering from aphasia, a brain condition that causes people to become unable to communicate with words. However, despite “losing their words,” some aphasia patients retain their ability to sing. Aschheim learned that this is because music is encoded into the brain in a different way than language. This notion inspired her to come up with 25 words that she could “back up” in her memory through music. She worked with Liza Mezzacappa and over a dozen other musicians to create a song for each of her 25 words to help encode them in her memory. For the <b>Earworms</b> series, these songs are projected from luminous plastic structures that resemble neurons.|$|R
