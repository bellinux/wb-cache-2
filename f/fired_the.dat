5|$|Upon Presidents {{return to}} port, the U.S. Navy {{launched}} {{an investigation into}} the incident. Gathering testimony from Presidents officers and crewmen, they determined that Little Belt had <b>fired</b> <b>the</b> first shot in the encounter. In the Royal Navy investigation, Captain Bingham insisted that President had <b>fired</b> <b>the</b> first shot and continued firing for 45 minutes, rather than the five minutes Rodgers claimed. In all subsequent reports, both captains continually insisted that the other ship had <b>fired</b> <b>the</b> first shot. Reaching a stalemate, the American and British governments quietly dropped the matter.|$|E

5|$|We {{destroyed}} the aircraft and all munitions, everything. I {{sat in my}} fighter and <b>fired</b> <b>the</b> guns into the woods where all the fuel had been dropped, and then jumped out. We destroyed twenty-five perfectly good fighters. They {{would be nice to}} have in museums now.|$|E
5|$|While {{defending}} the Oosterbeek perimeter three {{days into the}} battle, Baskeyfield commanded a pair of anti-tank guns that destroyed several enemy tanks before the crews were killed. Baskeyfield subsequently <b>fired</b> <b>the</b> guns alone before he too was killed. His body was not identified {{after the war and}} he has no known grave.|$|E
5|$|Another {{public outcry}} arose when the {{government}}, seeking {{the support of}} ethnic minorities, allowed the opening of over 80 Polish schools in Lithuania. At the time, the Polish government was closing Lithuanian schools in the fiercely contested Vilnius Region. The coalition government directly confronted the Christian Democrats when it proposed a 1927 budget that reduced salaries to the clergy and subsidies to Catholic schools. Further controversies were created when the government's military reform program was revealed as a careless downsizing. Some 200 conservative military officers were <b>fired.</b> <b>The</b> military began planning the coup.|$|E
50|$|The San Gabriel Complex Fire was a {{wildfire}} {{that burned}} in the Angeles National Forest, Los Angeles County. <b>The</b> <b>fire</b> was <b>the</b> combination of two separate <b>fires,</b> <b>the</b> Reservoir <b>Fire</b> and <b>the</b> Fish <b>Fire.</b>|$|R
5000|$|While several handguns and {{cartridges}} {{could be}} considered vest busters, two popular examples are <b>the</b> FN Five-seven <b>firing</b> <b>the</b> FN 5.7×28mm and the Smith & Wesson Model 500 <b>firing</b> <b>the</b> [...]500 S&W Magnum.|$|R
50|$|The West Fork Complex Fire {{started on}} June 5, and {{consists}} of three fires, all caused by lightning: <b>the</b> Windy Pass <b>Fire,</b> <b>the</b> West Fork <b>Fire,</b> and <b>the</b> Papoose <b>Fire.</b> <b>The</b> <b>fire</b> grew fast through pine beetle-killed trees, and threatened the town of South Fork only 0.5 mi away. <b>The</b> <b>fire</b> burned only 1 structure,and has reached 109,615 acres as of July 23.|$|R
5|$|Approximately {{three hours}} into the flight, Commander Ken Cameron and Pilot Jim Halsell <b>fired</b> <b>the</b> orbiter's {{reaction}} control thrusters {{in the first of}} a series of rendezvous burns that refined Atlantiss path towards Mir. Shortly after the burn, the first Canadian mission specialist, Chris Hadfield, activated the Russian-built docking module, housed in the shuttle's payload bay, ready for the docking of the module with Atlantiss Orbiter Docking System on flight day 2.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the season, Lerner hired former Packers coach Mike Holmgren as team president, moving Keenan {{to chief}} {{financial}} officer. A month later, the owner hired Eagles front-office executive Tom Heckert as general manager. Heckert replaced former general manager George Kokinis, who was <b>fired</b> <b>the</b> previous November. The new management said Mangini would return for a second season.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{received}} a fire-control director sometime between mid-1915 and May 1916; this centralised fire control under the director officer, who now <b>fired</b> <b>the</b> guns. The turret crewmen merely {{had to follow}} pointers transmitted from the director to align their guns on the target. This greatly increased accuracy, as {{it was easier to}} spot the fall of shells and eliminated the problem of the ship's roll dispersing the shells when each turret fired independently. Australia was also fitted with an additional inch of armour around the midships turrets following the Battle of Jutland.|$|E
50|$|Moose Lake {{was one of}} the {{communities}} affected by the massive 1918 Cloquet <b>Fire.</b> <b>The</b> Minneapolis, St. Paul and Sault Ste.

5000|$|On St Valentine's Day (February 14) of 1988, {{there was}} a major <b>fire</b> in <b>the</b> hotel, which {{resulted}} in the deaths of four guests and two members of staff. <b>The</b> <b>fire</b> originated in <b>the</b> Panorama Grill on the 31st floor of the hotel, and was caused by self-ignition while refilling an alcohol-fuelled food heater. The consequences of <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> were made worse because <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> disabled <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> lift, forcing <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> brigade to hand carry all their equipment up to the seat of <b>the</b> <b>fire.</b> After <b>the</b> <b>fire,</b> <b>the</b> restaurant was replaced with meeting and event rooms. In 2011, the restaurants Szenario und Dialog and the Edison Bar closed down after more than 20 years of operation. After a three-month renovation period, the new Le Muh restaurant opened. In November 2014, the hotel's main lobby was renovated with a new modern-inspired design ...|$|R

This relationships can be used to estimates the emissions from <b>the</b> <b>fires</b> and to estimate <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> hazards...|$|R
5|$|Barcelona {{kicked the}} match off, but Manchester United showed their intent from the outset, forcing goalkeeper Víctor Valdés to concede a throw-in after just 10 seconds. Further {{pressure}} on the attack resulted in Yaya Touré fouling Anderson within Cristiano Ronaldo's shooting range. Ronaldo <b>fired</b> <b>the</b> free kick directly at Valdés, but the Spanish goalkeeper could only parry the ball and Gerard Piqué did well to divert Park Ji-sung's follow-up effort over the bar. The resulting corner was cleared, but {{only as far as}} Wayne Rooney, whose snap-shot was wayward and went out for a goal kick.|$|E
5|$|Despite its problems, the {{locomotive}} displayed outstanding steaming characteristics and total traction {{from the two}} power bogies on its trial runs. When properly <b>fired,</b> <b>the</b> Leader was capable of {{keeping up with the}} schedules, even running ahead on occasions. However, operational difficulties when stopping for water tended to lose any time advantages gained and affected the published performance figures. Despite hauling test trains over the Central Section of the former Southern Railway, the Leader prototype was never used on a revenue-earning service because of the risk of failure of the valve gear and the adverse publicity this would cause for British Railways.|$|E
5|$|During these events, no gunshots were <b>fired.</b> <b>The</b> {{people did}} not react strongly, which {{according}} to the military, {{was a sign of}} approval. A provisional government was formed, and the presidency was offered to Aubame. The government was composed of civilian politicians from both the UDSG and BDG, such as Paul Gondjout. As for the coup plotters, they were content to ensure security for civilians. The small Gabonese army did not intervene in the coup; composed mostly of French officers, they remained in their barracks.|$|E

50|$|This {{is because}} coal stoves are {{fitted with a}} grate so {{allowing}} part of the combustion air to be admitted below <b>the</b> <b>fire.</b> <b>The</b> proportion of air admitted above/below <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> depends on <b>the</b> type of coal. Brown coal and lignites evolve more combustible gases than say anthracite and so need more air above <b>the</b> <b>fire.</b> <b>The</b> ratio of air above/below <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> must be carefully adjusted to enable complete combustion.|$|R
50|$|To <b>fire,</b> <b>the</b> {{operator}} loads {{the rounds}} into the barrel, and re-attaches the barrel {{to the rest}} of the weapon. Once reattached, the operator pulls back the slide where <b>the</b> <b>firing</b> pin is attached, pulls the trigger, which releases the slide into <b>the</b> round, <b>firing</b> <b>the</b> weapon.|$|R
5|$|Early on, many barracks at Birkenau {{were taken}} apart by civilians {{who used the}} {{materials}} to rebuild their own homes, levelled out {{in the construction of}} Auschwitz II. The poorest residents sifted the crematoria ashes in search of nuggets from melted gold, before the warning shots were <b>fired.</b> <b>The</b> POW camp for the German prisoners of war was used by the Soviet NKVD until 1947. In the two years, the Soviets dismantled and exported the IG Farben factories to the USSR. Meanwhile, Soviet and Polish investigators worked to document the war crimes of the SS.|$|E
5|$|Fire-control {{technology}} advanced quickly {{during the}} years between the Colossus-class ships' commissioning {{and the start of}} World War I, and the most important development was the director firing system. This consisted of a fire-control director mounted high in the ship which electrically provided data to the turrets via pointers, which the turret crew were to follow. The director layer <b>fired</b> <b>the</b> guns simultaneously which aided in spotting the shell splashes and minimised the effects of the roll on the dispersion of the shells. While the exact dates of installation are unknown, both ships were equipped with a director by December 1915.|$|E
5|$|Fire-control {{technology}} advanced quickly {{during the}} years immediately preceding the First World War {{and the development of}} the director firing system was a major advance. This consisted of a fire-control director mounted high in the ship which electrically provided elevation and training angles to the turrets via pointers, which the turret crewmen had only to follow. The director layer <b>fired</b> <b>the</b> guns simultaneously by an electrical trigger which aided in spotting the shell splashes and minimised the effects of the roll on the dispersion of the shells.|$|E

5|$|Frank, now entirely across Fremont {{street and}} still walking {{at a good}} pace {{according}} to Claiborne's testimony, fired twice more before {{he was shot in}} the head under his right ear. Both Morgan and Holliday apparently thought they had <b>fired</b> <b>the</b> shot that killed Frank, but since neither of them testified at the hearing, this information is only from second-hand accounts. A passerby testified to having stopped to help Frank, and saw Frank try to speak, but he died where he fell, before he could be moved.|$|E
5|$|In April 1878, L'Estrange reappeared on the Australian {{scene with}} a new {{performance}} – gas ballooning. The first balloon ascent in Australia {{had been made in}} Melbourne in 1853, with Sydney following five years later in December 1858. The idea that people could be lifted from the ground to fly and return safely <b>fired</b> <b>the</b> imagination of the public, and the novelty of balloon ascents continued to draw large crowds through the 1860s and 1870s. No doubt the very real chance of disaster and injury added to the crowd's keen interest, as mishaps were not uncommon.|$|E
5|$|Neptune was {{the first}} British {{dreadnought}} to be built with a gunnery director, albeit an experimental prototype designed by Vice-Admiral Sir Percy Scott. This was mounted on the foremast, underneath the spotting top and electrically provided data to the turrets via pointer on a dial, which the turret crewmen only had to follow. The director layer <b>fired</b> <b>the</b> guns simultaneously which aided in spotting the shell splashes and minimised {{the effects of the}} roll on the dispersion of the shells. The ship's director was later replaced as a new one was ordered in 1913 and installed by May 1916.|$|E
