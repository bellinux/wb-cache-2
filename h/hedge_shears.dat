500|$|After being {{disappointed}} {{by a new}} episode of Itchy & Scratchy, Bart and Lisa decide that they can write a better one themselves. Inspired {{by the sight of}} Homer accidentally slicing Marge's hair off with <b>hedge</b> <b>shears,</b> they write a script titled [...] "Little Barbershop of Horrors", but their episode is rejected by Roger Meyers Jr., head of Itchy & Scratchy International. Correctly guessing that Meyers did not take them seriously because they were children, they resubmit the manuscript under Grampa's name, leading Meyers to hire Grampa as a staff writer. Bart and Lisa inform Grampa about what they did and the three of them conspire to continue passing off Bart and Lisa's scripts as Grampa's own, splitting the money three ways.|$|E

60|$|Being {{regularly}} clipped {{all around}} {{each year by}} the cows, as a <b>hedge</b> with <b>shears,</b> they are often of a perfect conical or pyramidal form, from one to four feet high, and more or less sharp, as if trimmed by the gardener's art. In the pastures on Nobscot Hill and its spurs they make fine dark shadows {{when the sun is}} low. They are also an excellent covert from hawks for many small birds that roost and build in them. Whole flocks perch in them at night, and I have seen three robins' nests in one which was six feet in diameter.|$|R
40|$|Hedges {{can be an}} {{attractive}} and functional part of home landscaping. This NebGuide outlines the steps for proper plant selection and establishment, care, and rejuvenation. Not only are hedges attractive, but they serve some important landscape functions. <b>Hedges,</b> particularly <b>sheared</b> ones (formal), require time and some knowledge to establish {{them as well as}} annual pruning. It is also important to select suitable plant material and an appropriate site to minimize upkeep. Rapid growing plants like privet require more frequent shearing. A shady site or one with little air movement may require spraying for disease control. Hedges mark boundaries such as property lines, walks and drives, provide barriers to animals and people, serve as windbreaks, and screen off undesirable views...|$|R
50|$|Proper pruning will {{increase}} air circulation and decrease {{the likelihood of}} plant diseases. However, improper pruning is detrimental to shrubs and trees. <b>Hedging,</b> topping and <b>shearing</b> of landscape plants causes excessive plant growth. In addition, topping is a hazardous practice which creates a hazardous tree which is highly susceptible to wind damage. Natural pruning techniques during the proper season, on the other hand, promotes healthier, more stable plants. In temperate areas, deciduous plants should be pruned during dormancy. Plants should never be pruned {{at the end of}} a growing season because growth is stimulated and such new growth will be too tender to survive winter freezing temperatures.|$|R
