Many research projects {{have studied the}} mechanical construction of these heavy load wheels. The studies have been theoretical as well as experimental.

Within this project both one-phase intermediate materials such as sand, water, cutting-cooling-emulsion, metal splinters and two-phase intermediate materials such as sand/water and combinations of the latter were taken into consideration. In addition, the exposure of the bandage hardness, the cross linking agent of the polyurethane, the mechanical stress, and the slip are observed.

50|$|The Lambert Automobile Company {{manufactured}} the Lambert automobile {{through the}} Buckeye Manufacturing Company which had several subsidiaries. One {{of the main}} features of the Lambert automobile was the <b>friction</b> <b>gearing</b> disk drive transmission. When the United States entered into World War I the factory was converted for national defense in 1917. The company then made ammunition shells, caisson wheels and military fire engines. When the war ended Lambert did not resume automobile production. He realized automobiles were {{only going to be}} made by large manufactures.

He sent a picture to the newspapers, which was of the Buckeye gasoline buggy he made in 1891. This endeavor also did not come to fruition. Instead he continued experimentation and devised the <b>friction</b> <b>gearing</b> disk drive transmission. He invented and developed a friction transmission that would be the key feature on all of his future automobiles he would make.

The double bevel gears are cut so they can also be meshed as spur gears. There is also a 16 tooth clutch gear, and a 24 tooth <b>friction</b> <b>gear</b> that slips when a certain amount of torque is put on it to prevent motors from damaging any parts or burning themselves out.|$|R

This construction is characterized by a high level of flexibility and ability to change the friction torque based on changing drum position in regard to the driving and driven wheels (construction elements).

40|$|AbstractIn this research, {{friction}} {{coefficients of}} composite {{materials such as}} gear fiber reinforced plastic (gear fiber) and glass fiber reinforced plastic (glass fiber) are investigated and compared. In the experiments, gear fiber and glass fiber slide against different austenitic stainless steels such as stainless steel 201 (SS 201) and stainless steel 301 (SS 301). Experiments are carried out at low loads 2, 4 and 6 N, low sliding velocities 0. 2, 0. 4 and 0. 6 m/s and relative humidity 70 %. The obtained results reveal that in general, <b>friction</b> coefficient of <b>gear</b> fiber and glass fiber increases {{with the increase in}} normal load and sliding velocity. Results show that friction coefficient of glass fiber-SS 201 pair is the highest and gear fiber-SS 301 pair is the lowest within the observed range of normal load and sliding velocity. On the other hand, it is found that friction coefficient of glass fiber-SS 301 pair is slightly higher than that of gear fiber-SS 201 pair. During the running-in process, <b>friction</b> coefficient of <b>gear</b> fiber and glass fiber steadily increases with the increase in rubbing time and after certain duration of rubbing, it remains constant regardless of the counterface material. The obtained results reveal that for the observed range, the influence of normal load on the frictional properties of gear fibe and glass fiber is greater than that of sliding velocity. At identical operating conditions, the magnitudes of <b>friction</b> coefficient of <b>gear</b> fiber and glass fiber are different depending on normal load, sliding velocity and counterface material...|$|R
