5|$|Vampyr had {{a delayed}} release in Germany and opened to a {{generally}} negative reception from audiences and critics. Dreyer edited the film after its German premiere and it opened to more mixed opinions at its French debut. The film was long considered {{a low point}} in Dreyer's career, but modern critical reception to the film <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> favorable with critics praising the film's disorienting visual effects and atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Climate {{change and}} weather-related natural {{disasters}} also threaten lemur survival. For the last 1000 years, western and highland regions {{have been growing}} significantly drier, {{but in the past}} few decades, severe drought <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> frequent. There are indications that deforestation and forest fragmentation are accelerating this gradual desiccation. The effects of drought are even felt in the rainforests. As annual rainfall decreases, the larger trees that make up the high canopy suffer increased mortality, failure to fruit, and decreased production of new leaves, which folivorous lemurs prefer. Cyclones can defoliate an area, knock down canopy trees, and create landslides and flooding. This can leave lemur populations without fruit or leaves until the following spring, requiring them to subsist on crisis foods, such as epiphytes.|$|E
25|$|Hanukkah is not {{mentioned}} in the Bible and was never considered a major holiday in Judaism, but it <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> visible and widely celebrated in modern times, mainly because it falls around the same time as Christmas and has national Jewish overtones that have been emphasized since the establishment of the State of Israel.|$|E

25|$|In the story, Piro has extreme {{difficulty}} understanding Megatokyos female characters, {{making him}} {{for the most part}} ignorant of the feelings that the character Nanasawa Kimiko has for him, though he <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> aware of her attraction as the series progressed. Gallagher has commented that Piro is the focal point of emotional damage, while his friend, Largo, takes the physical damage in the comic.|$|E
25|$|Other {{significant}} trends {{during the}} 20th century were {{the spread of}} Anglo-Catholicism in Church of England parishes and the movement towards unification of the Anglican and Methodist Churches in the 1960s. As the bishops were sometimes High Church (e.g. W. H. Frere) and sometimes Low (e.g. Joseph Hunkin) administration of the diocese could vary from each episcopate to the next. The usage of Cornish as a liturgical language <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> common.|$|E
25|$|In {{the last}} 150 years, Irish {{migration}} to Scotland increased dramatically. As time {{has gone on}} Scotland <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> open to other religions and Catholics have seen the nationalisation of their schools and {{the restoration of the}} Church hierarchy. Even in the area of politics, there are changes. The Orange Order has also grown in numbers in recent times. This growth is, however, attributed by some to the rivalry between Rangers and Celtic football clubs as opposed to actual hatred of Catholics.|$|E

25|$|Since {{the late}} 1980s the Treaty <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> legally important. However, because of {{uncertainties}} about its meaning and translation, {{it still does}} not have a firm place in New Zealand law or jurisprudence. Another issue is whether the Crown in Right of New Zealand is bound. The separate New Zealand Crown was created when New Zealand adopted the Statute of Westminster in 1947, which granted legislative independence to New Zealand and created the Crown in Right of New Zealand. Martyn Finlay rejected this contention.|$|E
25|$|Written by two Americans with {{a strong}} country-western lyrical theme, the song was first {{released}} in Europe, where it <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> popular than in the composers' native country, with a big-band/orchestral pop arrangement sung by Tony Christie. Christie's version was a major hit in Europe and a modest success in his native United Kingdom upon its release, then became even more popular in the mid-2000s when the song was reissued. As Christie's version failed {{to make a major}} impact in the U.S., Sedaka released his own recording of the song in 1977, which narrowly missed the top 40 but was an easy listening hit in the U.S. and Canada.|$|E
25|$|Photography and {{videography}} are the mainstays of recording, which <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> convenient {{with the}} advent of reasonably priced digital still and HD video cameras. Cameras, including video cameras can be provided with special underwater housings that enable them to be used for underwater videography. Low visibility underwater and distortion of image due to refraction mean that perspective photographs can be difficult to obtain. However, it is possible to take a series of photographs at adjacent points and then combined into a single photomontage or photomosaic image of the whole site. 3D photogrammetry has also become a very popular way to image underwater cultural materials and shipwreck sites.|$|E

25|$|Economic growth <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> modest {{since the}} late 1990s. A key factor to {{understand}} this new environment is the rise of China, offering the same conditions that made possible, 40 years ago, the Taiwan Miracle (a quiet political and social environment, cheap and educated workers, absence of independent trade unions). To keep growing, the Taiwanese economy must abandon its workforce intensive industries, which cannot compete with China, Vietnam or other sub-developed countries, and keep innovating and investing in information technology. Since the 1990s, Taiwanese companies have been permitted to invest in China, {{and a growing number}} of Taiwanese businessmen are demanding easier communications between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.|$|E
25|$|Americans {{initially}} {{believed that}} the proliferation of false parts mainly affected only smaller airlines; indeed, smaller airlines and repair stations were usually the businesses that were {{the most likely to}} be affected by fake parts. However, the FAA later found counterfeit parts in larger operations, including the discovery of counterfeit parts in aircraft of large, well-known airlines; even Air Force One, the aircraft used by the President of the United States, at one time contained fakes. As a result, illegal dealers and counterfeiters faced arrests, trials, and convictions. Schiavo stated that the among the most important actions taken by the United States government regarding the proliferation of counterfeit parts was the convictions of counterfeiters and illegal dealers. The FAA created a more rigorous documenting system to prevent the proliferation of fake aircraft parts and were eventually given the authority to press criminal charges on airlines who knowingly accept unapproved parts. In the 2000s, Schiavo said that aircraft parts are not counterfeited as often anymore because regulation of the spare parts industry <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> strict than in the 1980s and the 1990s.|$|E
500|$|In {{the view}} of historians, such as Philip Williamson writing in 2007, the popular {{perception}} {{in the 21st century}} that the abdication was driven by politics rather than religious morality is false and arises because divorce <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> common and socially acceptable. To contemporary sensibilities, the religious restrictions that prevented Edward from continuing as king while planning to marry Simpson [...] "seem, wrongly, to provide insufficient explanation" [...] for his abdication.|$|E

500|$|Critical {{response}} to On Her Majesty's Secret Service <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> positive in recent years. Film critic James Berardinelli summed this {{up in his}} review of the movie: [...] "with {{the exception of one}} production aspect, [...] is by far the best entry of the long-running James Bond series. The film contains some of the most exhilarating action sequences ever to reach the screen, a touching love story, and a nice subplot that has agent 007 crossing (and even threatening to resign from) Her Majesty's Secret Service. The problem is with Bond himself... George Lazenby is boring, and his ineffectualness lowers the picture's quality. Lazenby can handle the action sequences, but that's about all he masters." ...|$|E
500|$|First {{described}} in 1777 by English illustrator John Frederick Miller, M.murinus remained the only species of its genus, {{as well as}} the name used for all mouse lemurs on Madagascar, between the first major taxonomic revision in 1931 and an extensive field study conducted in 1972. [...] The field study distinguished the brown mouse lemur, M.rufus—then considered a subspecies—as a distinct, sympatric species in the southeastern part of the island. [...] Upon this revision, the gray mouse lemur was thought to account for all mouse lemurs that lived in the drier parts of the north, west, and south, while the brown mouse lemur represented the eastern rainforest mouse lemurs. [...] More recently, scientific understanding of the distribution and diversity of the mouse lemurs <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> complex. [...] Additional field studies, genetic testing, and resulting taxonomic revisions throughout the 1990s and 2000s identified numerous new mouse lemur species, demonstrating that the genus includes at least 17 cryptic species.|$|E
500|$|The book {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} responses from critics. R Krishna from Daily News and Analysis gave a positive review for the book. He {{observed that the}} criticism in the second book regarding bad editing and writing has been polished in The Oath of the Vayuputras. He complimented the fact that philosophical discussions {{in the book is}} rightly balanced by action sequences, commending the way in which Sati's fight with the assassins is described. Krishna concluded that the different characters of the book make it a good reading and a fitting ending to the series. Phorum Dalal from Mid Day praised the urban dialect used by Shiva in the book and felt that Tripathi's grip on the whole story is steady and has the reader's undivided attention, ultimately [...] "giving the Trilogy an end it deserves". Sanjeev Sanyal from Business Standard gave a neutral review saying that although the fast-paced and easy style from the earlier books has been retained, it is evident if one goes back and rereads the first few pages of The Immortals of Meluha that Tripathi <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> comfortable and confident of his writing. [...] "Of course, those whose literary tastes have not outgrown Wren and Martin will still find fault with his use of the English language. For the rest of us, it is delightful to see how Tripathi applies simple language to evoke great battle scenes and extraordinary landscapes".|$|E

500|$|Historian Annette Atkins has {{explored}} the changing long-term pattern of Minnesota politics. [...] In {{the late nineteenth}} and early twentieth century, the heavily rural state was hostile to business and railroads, with the Republicans dominant in the small towns, and the Democrats on the farms. [...] Numerous left-wing groups and third-parties emerged, such as the Anti-Monopolist party in the 1870s, the Populists in the 1890s, the Non-Partisan League in the 1910s, and the Farmer-Labor party in the 1930s. [...] Isolationism was strong, Atkins argues, because of the fear that Eastern bankers and industrialists forced the United States into World War I to enlarge their profits. Business fought unions, and the unions fought back, and with the governor on their side unions won some violent battles in the 1930s. [...] In recent decades, however, the liberal coalition has weakened. [...] Labor unions are a shadow of their old strength. [...] Most farmers have left for the towns and especially the Twin Cities, where half the people live. [...] The state high income tax is troublesome, and complaints are often heard about to generous welfare benefits. [...] The New Right has mobilized social conservatives, especially those from traditional religious backgrounds, with abortion a furiously contested issue. [...] State government <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> friendly toward growth and the needs of business entrepreneurship. [...] Environmentalism has split left and right, with the industrial workers in the Up North and Iron Range districts demanding that their jobs be protected from environmentalists.
