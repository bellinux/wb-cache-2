5|$|After the {{experience}} of World War II, Belgium abandoned its neutral stance in international politics, in favour of military, political and <b>economic</b> <b>integration.</b> In 1949, Belgium joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and deployed troops to fight alongside other United Nations forces in the Korean War in 1950. Belgium was also {{a key player in}} the unsuccessful negotiations about the creation of a European Defence Community (EDC) in the 1950s. Belgium was assigned a sector of the British zone in West Germany, around the city of Cologne, which it occupied from 1945. Belgian soldiers remained in Germany until their final withdrawal in 2002.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the issues of {{multilateral}} cooperation and the possibilities of establishing <b>economic</b> <b>integrations</b> between countries of the Western Balkans. The {{second half of the}} XX century was marked by multilateral cooperation as a general trend in the development of international relations. Regionalization is an old phenomenon which in various ways, in various periods, maintains the nature of international relations, with an ever-increasing need for "new regionalism" present in the last decades. It should be stressed that multilateral cooperation in the Balkans was not a continual process and is characterized by the same instability and briefness which marked the whole history of the Balkans in the XX century. A new era, however, brings new opportunities. The possibility of multilateral cooperation between the countries of the Western Balkans is especially interesting, especially in the creation of Balkan integrations modeled on the many regional integration already present in the world. Political instability is one of the chief characteristics of almost all countries in the Western Balkans, making it hard to discuss sustainable political integrations. The stress should be placed on <b>economic</b> <b>integrations</b> and using all natural resources and economic potentials, which all countries of the Western Balkans possess. The paper notes the most significant characteristics of <b>economic</b> <b>integrations,</b> and especially the formation of economic unions. This paper also presents some of the suggestions for actual models of <b>economic</b> <b>integrations</b> which could exist in the countries of the Western Balkans...|$|R

5|$|By 1883, most coins on {{the islands}} were American, due to the close <b>economic</b> <b>integration</b> between islands and mainland. The laws of Hawaii {{reflected}} this, making gold American coins legal tender for an unlimited amount and American silver coins legal tender to $50. In 1879, the kingdom issued its first currency notes, technically certificates of deposit, redeemable in silver coin and with denominations ranging from $10 to $500.|$|E
5|$|The Customs Union of Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Russia (now the Eurasian Customs Union) {{came into}} {{existence}} on 1 January 2010. The Customs Union's priorities were the elimination of intra-bloc tariffs, establishing a common external tariff policy {{and the elimination of}} non-tariff barriers. It was launched as a first step towards forming a broader single market inspired by the European Union, with the objective of forming an alliance between former Soviet states. The member states planned to continue with <b>economic</b> <b>integration</b> and were set to remove all customs borders between each other after July 2011.|$|E
5|$|At the 20th century's end, Gaddafi—frustrated by {{the failure}} of his Pan-Arab ideals—increasingly {{rejected}} Arab nationalism in favour of Pan-Africanism, emphasising Libya's African identity. From 1997 to 2000, Libya initiated cooperative agreements or bilateral aid arrangements with 10 African states, and in 1999 joined the Community of Sahel-Saharan States. In June 1999, Gaddafi visited Mandela in South Africa, and the following month attended the OAU summit in Algiers, calling for greater political and <b>economic</b> <b>integration</b> across the continent and advocating the foundation of a United States of Africa. He became {{one of the founders of}} the African Union (AU), initiated in July 2002 to replace the OAU; at the opening ceremonies, he called for African states to reject conditional aid from the developed world, a direct contrast to the message of South African President Thabo Mbeki.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{heterogeneity}} {{of growth in the}} Western Balkan and Emerging European economies. For that purpose, growth determinants are estimated in the period 1997 - 2009 by dynamic panel data models. The chosen period provides a comparison for the model results with those estimated for the period up to 2007 in order to analyze changes caused by the global instability. According to the main findings of the paper, macroeconomic stabilization and structural reforms still matter in determining economic growth, but foreign direct investments and <b>economic</b> <b>integrations</b> seem to have the most important role in stimulating growth in the observed countries. Moreover, significant positive effects of foreign direct investments and <b>economic</b> <b>integrations</b> produce differences in growth paths between Emerging European and Western Balkan economies. Sharp decrease of foreign inflows in 2008 determined contractions of growth rates firstly in Emerging European economies with subsequent spill-over on the Western Balkan economies during 2009. Consequently, in the period of global instability, differences between two groups of economies become even more obvious...|$|R

5|$|Canada's <b>economic</b> <b>integration</b> {{with the}} United States has {{increased}} significantly since World War II. The Automotive Products Trade Agreement of 1965 opened Canada's borders {{to trade in}} the automobile manufacturing industry. In the 1970s, concerns over energy self-sufficiency and foreign ownership in the manufacturing sectors prompted Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau's Liberal government to enact the National Energy Program (NEP) and the Foreign Investment Review Agency (FIRA). In the 1980s, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's Progressive Conservatives abolished the NEP and changed the name of FIRA to Investment Canada, to encourage foreign investment. The Canada– United States Free Trade Agreement (FTA) of 1988 eliminated tariffs between the two countries, while the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) expanded the free-trade zone to include Mexico in 1994.|$|E
5|$|Stalin {{believed}} that <b>economic</b> <b>integration</b> with the West would allow Eastern Bloc countries to escape Soviet control, {{and that the}} US was trying to buy a pro-US re-alignment of Europe. Stalin therefore prevented Eastern Bloc nations from receiving Marshall Plan aid. The Soviet Union's alternative to the Marshall Plan, which was purported to involve Soviet subsidies and trade with central and eastern Europe, {{became known as the}} Molotov Plan (later institutionalized in January 1949 as the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance). Stalin was also fearful of a reconstituted Germany; his vision of a post-war Germany did not include the ability to rearm or pose any kind of threat to the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|The May Revolution was not {{the product}} of the actions of a single {{political}} party with a clear and defined agenda, but a convergence of sectors with varying interests. Thus, {{there are a number of}} conflicting perspectives about it, because different authors highlight different aspects. Mitre, for example, referred to The Representation of the Landowners (an 1809 economic report by Mariano Moreno) and the role of the merchants to support the view that the May Revolution intended to obtain free trade and <b>economic</b> <b>integration</b> with Europe; right-wing revisionists center around Saavedra and the social customs of the time to describe the revolution under conservative principles; and left-wing revisionists use the example of Moreno, Castelli and the rioters led by French and Beruti to describe it as a radical revolution.|$|E
