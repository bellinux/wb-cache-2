40|$|The <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>yielded</b> {{or failure}} zone {{due to an}} {{engineering}} construction is a subject of study in different disciplines. In Petroleum engineering, depletion from and injection of gas into a porous rock can cause <b>development</b> <b>of</b> a <b>yield</b> zone around the reservoir. Studying this phenomenon requires elasto-plastic analysis of geomaterial, {{in this case the}} porous rocks. In this study, which is a continuation of a previous study investigating the elastic behaviour of geomaterial, the elasto-plastic responses of geomaterial were studied. A 3 D finite element code (FEM) was developed, which can consider different constitutive models. The code features were explained and some case studies were presented to validate the output results of the code. The numerical model was, then, applied to study the <b>development</b> <b>of</b> the plastic zone around a horizontal porous formation subjected to the injection of gas. The model is described in detail and the results are presented. It was observed that by reducing the cohesion of rocks the extension of the plastic zone increased. Comparing to the elastic model, the ability to estimate the extension <b>of</b> the <b>yield</b> and failure zone is the main advantage of an elasto-plastic model...|$|R

5000|$|Pricing {{science has}} its roots in the <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>yield</b> {{management}} programs developed by the airline industry shortly after deregulation of the industry in the early 1980s. These programs provided model-based support to answer the central question faced by deregulated airlines: [...] "How many bookings should I accept, for each fare product that I offer on each flight departure that I operate, so that I maximize my revenue?" [...] Finding the best answers required developing statistical algorithms to predict the number of booked passengers who would show up and to predict the number of additional bookings to expect for each fare product. It also required developing optimization algorithms and formulations to find the best solution, given the characteristics of the forecasts. And for airlines operating hundreds to thousands of flights every day, and selling tickets for daily departures 300 days into the future, the computational challenges are extreme.|$|E

Early transplanting (weed-free) resulted in the highest yield and best quality performance, whereas late transplanting combined with mechanical weed control only (including harrowing weeds before transplanting onions) resulted in medium yield and quality, however, at a relatively low work-input.

Most of this work has been tactical and mathematical rather than managerial. In this article, the authors suggest that a broader view of yield management is valuable to both traditional and nontraditional users of the approach. Central to this broader view is the recognition of how different combinations of pricing and duration can be used as strategic levers to position service firms in their markets and the identification of tactics by which management can deploy these strategic levers.

40|$|In the {{management}} of sustainable conifer plantations, the <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>yield</b> models allowing a proper planning of interventions within a low-input silvicultural system is of major interest. The fundamental hypothesis in most forest plantation yield studies assumes that individual tree growth is dependent upon the competitive influence of neighbouring trees. A critical synthesis of the best-known types of individual competition indices is presented, chiefly by discussing applicative differences between the ‘distance dependent’ (spatial) and the ‘distance independent’ (non-spatial) indices. Experimental preliminary trials show that non-spatial competition indices have a predictive ability no lower than the spatial ones, at least when used for conifer-plantation yield projection. The following simple index proved suitable: where Di is {{the diameter of the}} ith competitor and Dj is the diameter of the tree in question.

40|$|Yield {{potential}} is the genome-encoded {{capacity of a}} crop species to generate yield in an optimal growth environment. Ninety per cent of plant biomass {{is derived from the}} photosynthetic reduction of carbon dioxide to organic carbon (photoassimilates - primarily sucrose). Thus, <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>yield</b> components (organ numbers and individual organ masses) can be limited by photoassimilate supply (photosynthesis arranged in series with phloem transport) or by their inherent capacity to utilise imported photoassimilates for growth or storage. To this end, photoassimilate supply/utilisation of crop yield has been quantitatively re-evaluated using published responses of yield components to elevated carbon dioxide concentrations across a selection of key crop species including cereal and pulse grains, fleshy fruits, tubers and sugar storing stems and tap roots. The analysis demonstrates that development of harvested organ numbers is strongly limited by photoassimilate supply. Vegetative branching and, to a lesser extent, flower/pod/fleshy fruit abortion, are the major yield components contributing to sensitivity of organ numbers to photoassimilate supply. In contrast, harvested organ size is partially dependent (eudicots), or completely independent (cereals), of photoassimilate supply. Processes limiting photoassimilate utilisation by harvested organs include membrane transport of soluble sugars and their allocation into polymeric storage products...|$|E
40|$|Evaluation to {{high yield}} and water-saving for {{improving}} water use efficiency (WUE) of crops is becoming important in irrigated farming and dry farming. Field experiments with 7 winter wheat varieties under 2 levels of irrigation {{were conducted in}} Luancheng Experiment Station (37 53 LN C 140 40 LE G 50 m above the sea level) during 2001 to 2002. The growth and <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>yield</b> and its components, water use, WUE, photosynthesis rate, transpiration rate and stomata conductance were measured.

However, area of flag leaf and the leaf below flag leaf were significantly negatively related with WUE at yield level, specific leaf weight of flag leaf and the leaf below flag leaf was significantly positive related with WUE at yield level, transpiration rate and stomata conductance were significantly negatively related with WUE at leaf level. Based on leaf water potential (t µ), stomata resistance (Rs), transpiration rate (Tr), drought resistance coefficient (DC), maximum yield (Ym) and WUE at yield level, an evaluation index to high-yield, water saving and drought- resistance(IA) was established as follows : IA= 0. 4 Ym + 0. 2 WUE + 0. 1 (Rs+ t µ +Tr) + 0. 1 DC. vokMyynti MTT tietopalvelu...|$|E
40|$|Effect of {{different}} soil temperature on growth and <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>yield</b> and yield components for three annual Medicago species {{was investigated in}} a control growth chamber. In this experiment, the species of annual medics namely Medicago polymorpha, M. radiata and M. rigidula that suppose to be adapted with cold and temperate zones were used. Root zone temperatures at four levels including 5, 10, 15 and 20 °C were considered. The experimental plan was factorial in base of randomized complete block design with four replications. Result showed that the annual Medicago species had significant difference for producing dry matter and yield components. The species of M. polymorpha and M. rigidula had more leaf, stem and root dry matter, plant height, leaf and stem to root ratio, leaf to stem ratio and leaf area and yield than M. radiata. Therefore these species may be better for ley-farming system in cold and temperate zones. Also, {{the result showed that}} the 5 °C root zone temperature had effectively decreased the yield and yield components of the annual medics. In conclusion, application of ley-farming system is not successful in the zone that soil temperature is lower than 5 °C especially for vegetative stages. Therefore, in the zones that soil temperature is more than 10 °C, annual medics have normal growth and produced suitable yield.

40|$|Kozak (2004) {{investigated}} nonsequential yield {{component analysis}} and proposed a parameter and its estimator of influence of yield components on yield; nonsequential components are such compo-nents that are co-related and develop {{at the same}} time during the plant ontogenesis. The parameter takes into account a specific multiplicative form of the relationship between yield and its compo-nents. It measures effects of components on yield, providing an estimated average yield in response to a change in a particular component, assuming the other components are fixed. The results by Kozak (2004) as well as those re-ported in this paper do not pertain to the situation in which yield components develop sequentially (e. g. Dofing and Knight 1992, García del Moral et al. 2003), but to what is called the non-sequantial <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>yield</b> components. Therein, yield components co-develop, making none of them a cause or an effect of another. This is why we call the methodology to analyze such a situation “nonsequential yield component analysis ” (NYCA) to distinguish it from yield component analysis for the sequential case, which is sometimes called the sequential yield component analysis (SYCA) (e. g. McArthur and Eaton 1988). The paper by Kozak (2004) represented theoretical work on NYCA, focusing on deriving an appropriate expression for direct effects (parameter as well as its estimator), and comparing, theoretically and via simulation INFORMATION Applying statistics for nonsequential yield component analysi...|$|E
40|$|The <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>yield</b> in cassava, {{either as}} a sole crop or intercropped with quick-maturing soybean sown 1, 5 or 9 weeks after cassava planting, or a {{succession}} of two soybean sowings 1 and 14 weeks after planting, was followed at a high latitude (27 °S) where the cassava growing season is limited to 9 months by winter temperatures. Competition, at least largely for nitrogen, restricted the growth of cassava, but after soybean harvest, leaf-area index increased such {{that there was little}} difference in interception of radiation among crops, and consequently growth rates and thus amounts of assimilate potentially available for tuber growth were similar. Competition from earlier-sown soybean greatly reduced branching by cassava. The reduced number of branches were sufficient to provide adequate leaf-area index, but were a reduced sink for assimilates during the main period of tuber growth. The slightly reduced assimilate supply available in early intercropped cassava was offset by the increased partitioning to tubers. As a result, soybean intercropping did not reduce tuber yield, except slightly in the case of double-intercropped cassava, but provided an additional yield of grain. Land equivalent ratio was particularly high at about 1. 6 when soybean was sown within 5 weeks of cassava planting. When soybean was sown 9 weeks after cassava planting, land equivalent ratio was reduced to about 1. 3 as a result of lower soybean yield...|$|E
40|$|Abstract:The yield {{criteria}} of geomaterials {{play a crucial}} role in studying and designing the strength of materials and structures. The basic characteristics of yield criteria for geomaterials need to be studied under the framework of continuum mechanics. These characteristics include the effects of strength difference (SD) of materials in tension and compression, normal stress, intermediate principal stress, intermediate principal shear stress, hydrostatic stress, twin-shear stresses, and the convexity of yield surface. Most of the proposed yield criteria possess only one or some of these basic characteristics. For example, the Tresca yield criterion considers only single-shear stress effect, and ignores the effect of SD, normal stress, intermediate principal stress, intermediate principal shear stress, hydrostatic stress, and twin-shear stresses. The Mohr-Coulomb yield criterion accounts for the effect of SD, normal stress, single-shear stress and hydrostatic stress, but disregards the effect of intermediate principal stress, intermediate principal shear stress, and twin-shear stresses. The basic characteristics remain to be fully addressed in the <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>yield</b> criterion. In this paper, we propose a new yield criterion with three features, that is, newly developed, better than existing criteria and ready for application. It is shown that the proposed criterion performs better than the existing ones and is ready for application. The development of mechanical models for various yield criteria and the applications of the unified strength theory to engineering are also summarized. According to a new tetragonal mechanical model, a tension-cut condition is added to the unified strength theory. The unified strength theory is extended to the tension-tension region...|$|E
