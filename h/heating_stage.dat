5000|$|In the <b>heating</b> <b>stage,</b> {{the treated}} liquid is first {{pre-heated}} to a non-critical temperature (70-80°C for milk), {{and then quickly}} heated to the temperature required by the process. There {{are two types of}} heating technologies: direct, where the product is put in a direct contact with the hot steam, and indirect, where the product and the heating medium remain separated by the equipment's contact surfaces. The main goals of the design, both from product quality and from efficiency standpoints, are to maintain the high product temperature for the shortest period possible, and to ensure that the temperature is evenly distributed throughout.|$|E

5000|$|Whether {{it be in}} {{creating}} new drugs for treatment or therapy, or looking at the interactions between atoms, simulations are helpful because {{we can get a}} visualization {{of what is going on}} at an atomic level. Some of these are CHARMM, NAMD. Simulations typically go through 4 different stages. 1) A creation stage, which calls information from some library. 2) A minimization stage, which allows the system to relax and settle into a local energy minimum. 3) A <b>heating</b> <b>stage,</b> which gives kinetic energy to the system. 4) An equilibration stage, which allows the computer to store values about the dynamics of the system. These values can then be analyzed according to the type of simulation performed.|$|E
50|$|Petrography is {{a branch}} of {{petrology}} that focuses on detailed descriptions of rocks. Someone who studies petrography is called a petrographer. The mineral content and the textural relationships within the rock are described in detail. The classification of rocks {{is based on the}} information acquired during the petrographic analysis. Petrographic descriptions start with the field notes at the outcrop and include macroscopic description of hand specimens. However, the most important tool for the petrographer is the petrographic microscope. The detailed analysis of minerals by optical mineralogy in thin section and the micro-texture and structure are critical to understanding the origin of the rock. Electron microprobe analysis of individual grains as well as whole rock chemical analysis by atomic absorption, X-ray fluorescence, and laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy are used in a modern petrographic lab. Individual mineral grains from a rock sample may also be analyzed by X-ray diffraction when optical means are insufficient. Analysis of microscopic fluid inclusions within mineral grains with a <b>heating</b> <b>stage</b> on a petrographic microscope provides clues to the temperature and pressure conditions existent during the mineral formation.|$|E
50|$|The {{stages of}} {{heating and cooling}} involve {{transfer}} of heat first from the hot medium to the polymer material and next from it to the cooling environment. In both cases, the process of heat transfer occurs in an unsteady regime; therefore, its kinetics attracts the greatest interest in considering these steps. In the <b>heating</b> <b>stage,</b> the heat taken from the hot gas is absorbed both by the mold and the polymer material. The rig for rotational molding usually has a relatively small wall thickness and is manufactured from metals with a high thermal conductivity (aluminum, steel). As a rule, the mold transfers much more heat than plastic can absorb; therefore, the mold temperature must vary linearly. The rotational velocity in rotational molding is rather low (4 to 20 rpm). As a result, in the first stages of the heating cycle, the charged material remains as a powder layer {{at the bottom of}} the mold. The most convenient way of changing the cycle is by applying PU sheets in hot rolled forms.|$|E

40|$|In this article, {{we present}} a study on {{construction}} and characterization of a <b>heating</b> <b>stage</b> compatible to commercially available scanning probe microscopes working in contact and tapping modes. Thermal properties of the <b>heating</b> <b>stage</b> have been characterized. With the <b>heating</b> <b>stage,</b> sample surface temperature can reach as high as 215 degrees C while the scanner temperature is kept below 125 degrees C. Below 50 degrees C, the stage temperature is very stable, with fluctuations less than 0. 05 degrees C within half an hour. In both the contact and tapping mode of the force microscope, the image distortions have been calibrated, which occurs due to the decrease of piezoelectric coefficient at high temperature.

Preferred location of the inclusions inside the dimples of inter-particle ductile fracture indicates that they originate from fine particulates on the original powder surface that were enclosed during <b>heating</b> <b>stage.</b> Obtained results indicate that oxygen content can be significantly reduced by adjustment proper atmosphere purity/composition or high-temperature sintering...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} coupled thermal–hydrological–mechanical damage (THMD) {{model for the}} failure process of rock, in which {{coupling}} effects such as thermally induced rock deformation, water flow-induced thermal convection, and rock deformation-induced water flow are considered. The damage {{is considered to be}} the key factor that controls the THM coupling process and the heterogeneity of rock is characterized by the Weibull distribution. Next, numerical simulations on excavation-induced damage zones in Äspö pillar stability experiments (APSE) are carried out and the impact of in situ stress conditions on damage zone distribution is analysed. Then, further numerical simulations of damage evolution at the <b>heating</b> <b>stage</b> in APSE are carried out. The impacts of in situ stress state, swelling pressure and water pressure on damage evolution at the <b>heating</b> <b>stage</b> are simulated and analysed, respectively. The simulation results indicate that (1) the v-shaped notch at the sidewall of the pillar is predominantly controlled by the in situ stress trends and magnitude; (2) at the <b>heating</b> <b>stage,</b> the existence of confining pressure can suppress the occurrence of damage, including shear damage and tensile damage; and (3) the presence of water flow and water pressure can promote the occurrence of damage, especially shear damage...|$|E
40|$|Chromium {{is the one}} of {{the most}} {{attractive}} alloying elements for PM steels. Nevertheless, its high affinity to oxygen during sintering, especially during the <b>heating</b> <b>stage,</b> has to be considered. The present study relates surface products formation and their transformation to the employed sintering atmosphere. The study consists of the investigation of the type, morphology and distribution of reaction products on the fracture surfaces of specimens pressed and sintered at different temperatures between 700 and 1200 °C, for various times, as well as the evaluation of the metal surface – sintering atmosphere interactions in terms of gas composition and temperature. Specimens were sintered in three different atmospheres - nitrogen, nitrogen/ 10 % hydrogen and vacuum. Fractographic investigation of fracture surfaces of specimens sampled at different temperatures, by means of HR SEM combined with EDX analysis, show that the presence of hydrogen has clearly a positive effect on the early reduction of surface iron oxide during the <b>heating</b> <b>stage,</b> which is reflected in lower amounts of oxides present as well as lower carbon loss after sintering. The amount of oxide inclusions is higher after high temperature sintering in the case of vacuum due to pronounced development of inter-particle connections during the <b>heating</b> <b>stage,</b> above 900 °C, which led to enclosure of the surface oxide layer inside the necks. A change in the morphology and size of oxide inclusions was observed during the <b>heating</b> <b>stage</b> and after sintering the oxides were mainly encountered as small (< 1 μm) spherical inclusions and rarely coalesced into larger agglomerates. At higher temperatures, inclusions are stoichiometric Cr-Mn spinel oxides that have among the highest thermodynamic stabilities for this system.

40|$|The heat {{transfer}} through the attics of buildings under realistic thermal forcing {{has been considered}} in this study. A periodic temperature boundary condition is applied on the sloping walls of the attic to show the basic flow features in the attic space over diurnal cycles. The numerical results reveal that, during the daytime <b>heating</b> <b>stage,</b> the flow in the attic space is stratified; whereas at the night-time cooling stage, the flow becomes unstable. A symmetrical solution is seen for relatively low Rayleigh numbers. However, as the Ra gradually increases, a transition occurs at a critical value of Ra. Above this critical value, an asymmetrical solution exhibiting a pitchfork bifurcation arises at the night-time. It is {{also found that the}} calculated {{heat transfer}} rate at the night-time cooling stage is much higher than that during the daytime <b>heating</b> <b>stage...</b>|$|E

40|$|High-purity water-atomized {{steel powder}} grades prealloyed with {{chromium}} and manganese are currently {{available on the}} market.

40|$|Water {{atomized}} PM steels prealloyed with chromium {{are becoming}} more and more widely used due to their high performance characteristics and sinter-hardening capabilities. Due to its low cost and recyclability, chromium is a cost effective alloying alternative to replace expensive and toxic Ni and non-recyclable Cu that are traditionally used in PM. Chromium has higher affinity towards oxygen that brings risk of formation of stable oxides that are difficult to reduce and hence inhibit the development and the growth of inter-particle necks during sintering. This in turn directly influences the strength of the compacts. In this study, the analysis of the change in oxide state after delubrication and during <b>heating</b> <b>stage</b> until sintering temperature was performed by means of surface sensitive analytical techniques such as XPS and high resolution SEM combined with EDX analysis. Composition, morphology and distribution of the oxides was estimated on the fracture surface of the compacts, based on powder prealloyed with 1. 8 wt. % Cr, in the as-delubricated condition and sampled during the <b>heating</b> <b>stage</b> at 700, 900 and 1120 °C. Sintering atmosphere applied was dry 90 % N 2 / 10 % H 2 atmosphere (dew point ~- 50 °C).
