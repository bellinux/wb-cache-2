40|$|A negative-ion proton {{transfer}} {{chemical ionization}} mass spectrometric technique (NI-PT-CIMS), using acetate as the reagent ion, {{was applied to}} the measurement of volatile inorganic acids of atmospheric interest: hydrochloric (HCl), nitrous (HONO), nitric (HNO 3 ), and <b>isocyanic</b> (HNCO) <b>acids.</b> Gas phase calibrations through the sampling inlet showed the method to be intrinsically sensitive (6 – 16 cts/pptv), but prone to inlet effects for HNO 3 and HCl. The ion chemistry was found to be insensitive to water vapor concentrations, in agreement with previous studies of carboxylic acids. The inlet equilibration times for HNCO and HONO were 2 to 4 s, allowing for measurement in biomass burning studies. Several potential interferences in HONO measurements were examined: decomposition of HNO 3 &middot;NO 3 - clusters within the CIMS, and NO 2 -water production on inlet surfaces, and were quite minor (&le; 1 %, 3. 3 %, respectively). The detection limits of the method were limited by the instrument backgrounds in the ion source and flow tube, and were estimated to range between 16 and 50 pptv (parts per trillion by volume) for a 1 min average. The comparison of HONO measured by CIMS and by in situ FTIR showed good correlation and agreement to within 17 %. The method provided rapid and accurate measurements of HNCO and HONO in controlled biomass burning studies, in which both acids were seen to be important products...|$|R

50|$|The cyanate ion is an anion {{with the}} {{chemical}} formula written as OCN− or NCO−. In aqueous solution {{it acts as}} a base, forming <b>isocyanic</b> <b>acid,</b> HNCO.

In valence bond theory the canonical form HN+≡C-O− is the major contributor to the resonance hybrid.The pure compound has a melting point of −86.8 °C and a boiling point of 23.5 °C, so it is volatile at ambient temperatures.

40|$|Carbamylation (carbamoylation) is a post-translational {{modification}} {{resulting from the}} nonenzymatic reaction between <b>isocyanic</b> <b>acid</b> and free functional groups of proteins, in particular with the free amino groups. This reaction alters structural and functional properties of proteins and results in faster aging of proteins. Urea present in the body can be transformed into cyanate and its more reactive form, <b>isocyanic</b> <b>acid.</b> High concentration of urea is associated with some diseases, especially with chronic renal failure and atherosclerosis. In human tissues, urea and cyanate are in equilibrium in aqueous solutions. Surprisingly, concentration of isocyanate in the body is much lower than it would appear from the kinetic parameters of urea decomposition. The low concentration of <b>isocyanic</b> <b>acid</b> results from its high reactivity and short half-life. In this review we describe the biochemical mechanism of carbamylation of proteins and freeamino acids. We summarize the literature data for carbamylation of hemoglobin, lipoproteins,albumin, membrane proteins and erythropoietin in chronic renal failure.

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that ammonia concentrations can be amplified by reaction with NO in excess CO to form <b>isocyanic</b> <b>acid</b> (HNCO) {{which is then}} hydrolysed back to NH₃ has been tested. With 1000 ppm NO and 400 ppm NH₃ in 3400 ppm CO, the HNCO produced in a dry feed over Pd/SiO₂ and Pt/SiO₂ is sufficient to allow potential multiplications of 1. 9 and 2. 2, respectively. With Pt/SiO₂ a greater multiplication is possible if water is present since additional HNCO is formed using surface hydrogen generated by the water–gas shift reaction. <b>Isocyanic</b> <b>acid</b> is completely hydrolysed to NH₃ if oxides more active than silica are located downstream, or used to support the platinum group metal, provided excess water is present.
