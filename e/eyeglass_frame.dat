What could a woman wear on her face that would be romantic?” she wondered. Altina settled on the Harlequin mask as a starting point and began to cut masks into the frames she envisioned.Once she had set up production and negotiated deals with department stores, Altina opened an office where she oversaw marketing and distribution, later expanding her operation to the West Coast upon relocating to California. In 1939, Schinasi won the Lord & Taylor Annual American Design Award for her avant-garde transformation of the <b>eyeglass</b> <b>frame</b> into a proper fashion accessory.

50|$|Almost {{from the}} {{invention}} of the telescope in the 17th century the advantages of mounting two of them side by side for binocular vision seems to have been explored. Most early binoculars used Galilean optics; that is, they used a convex objective and a concave eyepiece lens. The Galilean design has the advantage of presenting an erect image but has a narrow field of view and is not capable of very high magnification. This type of construction is still used in very cheap models and in opera glasses or theater glasses. The Galilean design is also used in low magnification binocular surgical and jewelers' loupes because they can be very short and produce an upright image without extra or unusual erecting optics, reducing expense and overall weight. They also have large exit pupils making centering less critical and the narrow field of view works well in those applications. These are typically mounted on an <b>eyeglass</b> <b>frame</b> or custom-fit onto eyeglasses.|$|E

5000|$|Lenticular eyeglass lenses {{have been}} {{employed}} to correct extreme hyperopia (farsightedness), a condition often created by cataract surgery when lens implants are not possible. To limit the great thickness and weight that such high-power lenses would otherwise require, {{all the power}} of the lens is concentrated in a small area in the center. In appearance, such a lens is often described as resembling a fried egg: a hemisphere atop a flat surface. The flat surface or [...] "carrier lens" [...] has little or no power and is there merely to fill {{up the rest of the}} <b>eyeglass</b> <b>frame</b> and to hold or [...] "carry" [...] the lenticular portion of the lens. This portion is typically 40 mm in diameter but may be smaller, as little as 20 mm, in sufficiently high powers. These lenses are generally used for plus (hyperopic) corrections at about 12 diopters or higher. A similar sort of eyeglass lens is the myodisc, sometimes termed a minus lenticular lens, used for very high negative (myopic) corrections. More aesthetic aspheric lens designs are sometimes fitted. A film made of cylindrical lenses molded in a plastic substrate as shown in above picture, can be applied to the inside of standard glasses to correct for diplopia. The film is typically applied to the eye with the good muscle control of direction. Diplopia (also known as double vision) is typically caused by a sixth cranial nerve palsy that prevents full control of the muscles that control the direction the eye is pointed in. These films are defined in the number of degrees of correction that is needed where the higher the degree, the higher the directive correction that is needed.|$|E

40|$|Recommending glasses {{based on}} face and frame {{features}} {{is the main}} issue of this thesis. In this work we present an automatic shape extraction and classification method for face and <b>eyeglass</b> <b>frame</b> shapes. Our novel frame shape extraction algorithm can extract the polygonal shape of the frame accurately and reliably even for reflective sunglasses and thin metal frames. Additionally, we identify the key geometric features that can di↵erentiate reliably the shape classes and we integrate them into a supervised learning technique for face and frame shape classification. Finally, we incorporate the shape extraction and classification algorithms into a practical data-driven frame recommendation system that we validate empirically with a user study. Using a supervised learning technique, we identified the geometric discriminatory features {{that can be used to}} classify both the face type and the eyeglass type form a single photograph. Our classification method reaches near 90 % accuracy. We ran this classification on over 200 photographs and we surveyed 100 people on the compatibility between face and eyeglasses.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To test speech {{understanding}} in noise using array microphones integrated in an eyeglass device and to test if microphones placed anteriorly {{at the temple}} provide better directivity than above the pinna. DESIGN: Sentences were presented from the front and uncorrelated noise from 45, 135, 225 and 315 degrees. STUDY SAMPLE: Fifteen hearing impaired participants with a significant speech discrimination loss were included, as well as 5 normal hearing listeners. RESULTS: The device (Varibel) improved {{speech understanding}} in noise compared to most conventional directional devices with a directional benefit of 5. 3 dB in the asymmetric fit mode, which was {{not significantly different from}} the bilateral fully directional mode (6. 3 dB). Anterior microphones outperformed microphones at a conventional position above the pinna by 2. 6 dB. CONCLUSIONS: By integrating microphones in an <b>eyeglass</b> <b>frame,</b> a long array can be used resulting in a higher directionality index and improved speech understanding in noise. An asymmetric fit did not significantly reduce performance and can be considered to increase acceptance and environmental awareness. Directional microphones at the temple seemed to profit more from the head shadow than above the pinna, better suppressing noise from behind the listener...|$|E
40|$|Although contact {{dermatitis}} (CD) from eyeglass frames is uncommon, occasionally {{it may be}} encountered. Various substances may cause allergic CD, including metals, cosmetics, plastics, rubber, solvents, antioxidants, dyes, and waxes, some {{of which can be}} found in the average <b>eyeglass</b> <b>frame.</b> Recently, it has been determined that plasticizers, UV stabilizers and nickel are the most common allergens. Thus CD from eyeglass frames should be suspected in patients with retroauricular dermatitis or with lesions on the point of contact with the skin. Sometimes, the question is raised whether skin lesions result from allergy or just irritation. It has also been found that the varnish applied to eyeglass frames could be a source of nickel. Sometimes, although the frame looks silver or gold, it may contain nickel. Additionally, palladium or titanium eyeglass frames have also been reported to result in allergic CD. Some titanium frames contain palladium, which may cause CD. Plastic frames occasionally present the problem as they contain a combination of materials, making it difficult to determine the exact composition. Most plastic glasses are made of zyl or propionate, and may contain other materials, such as nylon, carbon, polycarbonate, optyl and polyamid. Patch (epicutaneous) test on contact allergens with analysis of softened scrapings from frames is a valuable diagnostic method for these patients. Although topical corticosteroid therapy results in transient clinical resolution, they do not preclude recurrences and changing frame material is often the only solution for these patients. Additionally, hypoallergenic eyeglass frames are also available on the market...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE. To {{assess the}} {{integrity}} of intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) using the pupillary light reflex in glaucoma patients. METHODS. A cross-sectional study was conducted, including 76 eyes from 38 patients with primary open-angle glaucoma and 36 eyes from 18 control subjects. the patients were tested in the dark with light stimuli using the Ganzfeld system, and the pupil diameter was measured {{with the assistance of}} an eye tracker consisting of two infrared cameras fit to an <b>eyeglass</b> <b>frame.</b> To preferentially stimulate ipRGCs, we used a 1 -second 470 -nm flash with a luminance of 250 cd/m(2). To stimulate different retinal photoreceptors (cones and rods), we used a 1 -second 630 -nm flash with a luminance of 250 cd/m(2). Standard automated perimetry (SAP), matrix frequency-doubling technology (FDT), and high-definition optical coherence tomography (Cirrus HD-OCT) were also performed. the correlation between the ipRGC-mediated sustained response following the pupillary light reflex and the structural and functional changes in glaucoma patients was analyzed using generalized estimating equation. RESULTS. An association was observed between the average retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness, as measured by Cirrus HD-OCT, and the sustained pupillary response to the blue flash (P = 0. 024). the severity of glaucoma, based on the mean deviation of SAP (Hodapp-Anderson-Parrish system), was also associated with the sustained response to the blue flash (P = 0. 006). CONCLUSIONS. This study showed a correlation between the mean RNFL thickness and the pupillary light response. A {{decrease in the number of}} ipRGCs is potentially related to the reduced RNFL thickness.
