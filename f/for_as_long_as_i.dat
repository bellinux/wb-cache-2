5|$|Jerry {{knows what}} the {{situation}} is. I think he's done very well for us, considering we plucked him out of non-league football at Yeovil. But he is aware that I {{have been looking for}} a right-back and I will continue looking for one. That doesn't mean I don't appreciate what Jerry has done for me since I signed him three-and-a-half years ago. There isn't a more reliable player at the club than Jerry Gill. He captains my reserve team, his fitness is of a very high standard and he has endless enthusiasm. When I put him in the first team, he never lets me down. I value Jerry's professionalism and <b>for</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> remain manager of Birmingham, {{there will always be a}} place for him here.|$|E
500|$|Zola {{himself was}} happy with his {{achievements}} to the Chelsea side, but when asked if his substitution was all projected, he denied it, stating: [...] "It wasn't planned. In the moment, I used my positive strength and I got a reward for the passion, the work not only I, but the masseur Mimmo Pezza did together in Rimini. The injury should take one month to heal, Mimmo Pezza helped me be fit in less than half that. I thank this man for a beautiful moment which will be in my heart <b>for</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> can remember." [...] Their victory meant Aston Villa gained {{a place in the}} 1998–99 UEFA Cup.|$|E
500|$|In July 2007, it was {{announced}} that Jackson had signed a recording contract with Island Records, after her five-album deal with Virgin Records America was fulfilled with the release of her album 20 Y.O. Jackson's tenth studio album, Discipline, which was an acknowledgment of Jackson's commitment, focus and dedication to her career, was released on February 26, 2008 under the supervision of label head L. A. Reid. Jackson commented, [...] "I wanted to name the album Discipline because {{it has a lot of}} different meanings for me but the most important would be work—to have done this <b>for</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have... And to have had the success that I've had—not excluding God by any means—but it takes a great deal of focus." ...|$|E

500|$|Late in November 1881, Van Gogh wrote {{a letter}} to Johannes Stricker, one which he {{described}} to Theo as an attack. Within days he left for Amsterdam. Kee would not meet him, and her parents wrote that his [...] "persistence is disgusting". In despair, he held his left hand in the flame of a lamp, with the words: [...] "Let me see her <b>for</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> can keep my hand in the flame." [...] He did not recall the event well, but later assumed that his uncle had blown out the flame. Kee's father made it clear that her refusal should be heeded and that the two would not marry, largely because of Van Gogh's inability to support himself.|$|E
500|$|Dormand later {{described}} himself as [...] "a republican <b>for</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> can remember having an interest in politics" [...] and was a long-serving secretary of the all-party Parliamentary republican group. He spoke out {{in opposition to the}} monarchy, declaring in 1971 that [...] "the whole of the royal establishment from the Queen downwards could go, lock stock and barrel tomorrow". He extended his criticism to the hereditary peerage in February 1973. In 1974 he and fellow Labour MP Willie Hamilton took the required oath declaring their allegiance to the Queen, then admitted that they had not meant it. The same year, he criticised the number of Royal servants who appeared on the biannual honours lists, calling instead for [...] "scores of miners" [...] to be honoured as they were just as worthy.|$|E
500|$|On 17 July 2009, Del Piero {{extended}} {{his contract with}} Juventus by one more year until 30 June 2011 in Pinzolo while training for pre-season, thus practically ensuring that he would retire at the club with which he started his professional career. During his renewal, he said, [...] "I am happy at Juventus and we are competitive. I want to keep playing <b>for</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> can and I'm certain that {{for at least two}} more years I will be at the top level." [...] On 14 February 2010, Del Piero marked his 445th Serie A appearance, breaking the all-time club record previously held by Boniperti, with a brace in a 3–2 win against Genoa. Del Piero finished the season as the all-time top scorer for Juventus, having scored over 250 goals in all competitions with the club, and having also made over 600 appearances in official matches for Juventus, breaking Scirea's appearance record.|$|E

500|$|Critics {{generally}} responded {{positively to}} [...] "A Quiet Night In". David Chater, writing for The Times, gave a highly laudatory review, saying the episode was [...] "the funniest, cleverest, most imaginative and original television I have seen <b>for</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> can remember– {{one of those}} fabulous programmes where time stands still and the world around you disappears". He chose not to reveal {{too much about the}} plot for fear of [...] "spoiling the fun". Chater later described the episode as [...] "mindboggling in its originality", and [...] "one of the funniest, most imaginative programmes shown on television in the past 15 years". Jane Simon, writing for the Daily Mirror, called the episode a [...] "triumph", while writers for Metro described the episode as [...] "quality comedy", and journalists writing for The Sunday Times characterised it as a [...] "brilliantly conceived and choreographed mime". Jack Seale, writing for the Radio Times, also stressed how the episode was [...] "beautifully choreographed", praising Pemberton and Shearsmith's [...] "willingness to attempt difficult concepts".|$|E
500|$|Fatboy {{is one of}} four {{characters}} {{created for}} the first series of the EastEnders online spin-off EastEnders: E20 who also appear in the main show, along with ZsaZsa, Leon and Mercy. Fatboy, along with the other characters from E20, was created by the show's thirteen writers during a summer school run by the BBC in August 2009. Open auditions for the cast were held at Theatre Royal Stratford East. Norwood's casting was announced on 25 November 2009, on which he said [...] "I am so excited to be on the show. It's an honour to now be part of a show that has been on in my house <b>for</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have been alive. I am born and bred in the East End—a stone's throw from the real Albert Square. It feels like a homecoming. I love being part of a cast that feels like family and can't wait to have a scene in The Vic." [...] Kenny, who {{was also one of the}} writers, said a character like Fatboy would not have appeared in EastEnders had he not been written by young people. Norwood stated in 2013 that being from east London and playing a character from east London meant that he could [...] "bring the truth to that character from the knowledge I have. [...] try and bring the truth out of that instead of doing it from an outside perspective." ...|$|E
500|$|Many critics responded very {{positively}} to Inside No. 9. After the final {{episode of the}} first series, the comedic critic Bruce Dessau said on his website that it had [...] "really set an early benchmark to beat for comedy of the year. It has been consistently compelling as each week we entered an entirely different world." [...] On the same day, David Chater, writing in The Times, said of the series as a whole that [...] "t's hard to know which to admire more – the rich and perverse imaginations of Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith or the extraordinary range of acting talent that has brought this strange and memorable series to life." [...] Chater had previously described [...] "A Quiet Night In", the second episode of Inside No. 9, as [...] "the funniest, cleverest, most imaginative and original television I have seen <b>for</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> can remember – one of those fabulous programmes where time stands still and the world around you disappears". Mark Jones (The Guardian) considered the whole series, saying that the Inside No. 9 was [...] "never less-than-captivating", while a review in the Liverpool Echo described every episode as [...] "intriguing and lovingly-crafted", though {{it was felt that}} the first three episodes were stronger than the latter three. In December 2014, Metro television critic Keith Watson named Inside No. 9 the twentieth best television programme of 2014, and in January 2015, Daily Star Sunday columnist Garry Bushell named Inside No. 9 the best comedy TV programme of 2014.|$|E

2500|$|Conversely, {{there were}} no {{mitigating}} factors in Shadrake's favour. The Court of Appeal stated that Shadrake had not shown any remorse, but had continued to stand by the statements he made. Following the High Court's ruling on liability but before it had sentenced him, Shadrake had also given an interview to the UK newspaper The Guardian, in which he described his book as [...] "devastatingly accurate" [...] and declared that [...] "his story is never going away. I'll keep it on the boil <b>for</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> live. They're going to regret they ever started this."

2500|$|Burge {{was born}} in Kangaroo Point, Queensland into a cricketing family. His father Thomas John [...] "Jack" [...] Burge was a {{salesman}} who rose to be a departmental manager of D. & W. Murray, a retail outlet, before becoming a state representative for Nile Industries, a textile firm. Jack Burge represented Eastern Suburbs in Brisbane's grade cricket competition and later became a cricket administrator. The elder Burge served on the Queensland Cricket Association executive from 1945 {{until his death in}} 1957. He also represented Queensland on the Australian Board of Control from 1952 until 1957, and was a state selector from 1944 until 1949.

2500|$|Duterte {{has denied}} {{responsibility}} for the extrajudicial killings. He has also frequently announced his support for them. According to Reuters, [...] "Duterte's loud approval for hundreds of execution-style killings of drug users and criminals over nearly two decades helped propel him to the highest office of a crime-weary land." [...] In 2009 Duterte said: [...] "If you are doing an illegal activity in my city, {{if you are a}} criminal or part of a syndicate that preys on the innocent people of the city, <b>for</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> am the mayor, you are a legitimate target of assassination." [...] In 2015, Duterte confirmed his links to extrajudicial killings in Davao, and warned that, if elected president, he may kill up to 100,000 criminals. After the said confirmation, Duterte challenged human rights officials to file a case against him if they could provide evidence to his links with vigilante groups.|$|E
2500|$|During the tour, Wakeman {{announced}} {{his intention to}} leave the group at the tour's conclusion. His boredom and frustration from playing the whole of Tales from Topographic Oceans culminated during a show in Manchester where he proceeded to eat a curry onstage. Anderson felt he [...] "pushed" [...] Wakeman too {{far as he was}} unsatisfied with a keyboard solo in the set, and constantly asked him to get it right. Wakeman confirmed his exit to Lane over the phone on 18 May 1974, coincidentally his twenty-fifth birthday, declining to attend rehearsals for the next album, Relayer (1974), stressing he could no longer contribute to the material the band were developing for it. Later that day, Wakeman found out his solo album Journey to the Centre of the Earth (1974) had entered the UK chart at number one. Wakeman called it [...] "a day I will never forget <b>for</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> live".|$|E
2500|$|Throughout Pearl Jam's career, Vedder has {{interacted with}} the crowd during the band's concerts. Early in Pearl Jam's existence, Vedder and the band became known for their intense live performances. Vedder participated in stage diving as well as crowd surfing. During {{the early part of}} Pearl Jam's career, Vedder was known to climb the stage {{lighting}} rig and hang from the stage roof. Looking back at this time, Vedder said, [...] "It's hard for us to watch early performances, even though that's when people think we were on fire and young. Playing music <b>for</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> had been playing music and then getting a shot at making a record and at having an audience and stuff, it's just like an untamed force...a different kind of energy. And I find it kind of hard to watch those early performances because it's so just fucking, semi-testosterone-fueled or whatever. But it didn't come from jock mentality. It came from just being let out of the gates." ...|$|E
