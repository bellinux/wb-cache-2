5|$|Chemotherapy agents used in {{combination}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> effective against neuroblastoma. Agents {{commonly used in}} induction and for stem cell transplant conditioning are platinum compounds (cisplatin, carboplatin), alkylating agents (cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, melphalan), topoisomerase II inhibitor (etoposide), anthracycline antibiotics (doxorubicin) and vinca alkaloids (vincristine). Some newer regimens include topoisomerase I inhibitors (topotecan and irinotecan) in induction which <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> effective against recurrent disease.|$|E
5|$|In {{treating}} In-stent restenosis (ISR) Drug Eluting stents (DES) <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{superior to}} Intracoronary Brachytherapy (ICBT).|$|E
5|$|Birth {{control is}} also being {{considered}} {{as an alternative to}} hunting as a means of controlling overpopulation in wild animals. Contraceptive vaccines <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> effective {{in a number of different}} animal populations. Kenyan goat herders fix a skirt, called an olor, to male goats to prevent them from impregnating female goats.|$|E
50|$|Meditation <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> lead to high {{activity}} in the brain's left prefrontal cortex, which in turn <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> correlate with happiness.|$|R
50|$|L. rhamnosus <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> reduce {{intestinal}} permeability {{in children who}} suffer from irritable bowel syndrome, and it also <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> counter alcohol-related {{intestinal permeability}}.|$|R
50|$|Cardiovascular system: Social support <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> lower {{cardiovascular}} reactivity <b>to</b> stressors. It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> {{lower blood}} pressure and heart rates, which are known to benefit the cardiovascular system.|$|R
5|$|Common {{locations}} {{for the start}} of seizures and neural networks <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> affected in the majority of epilepsy. Efforts to figure out how epilepsy occurs is working {{to take into account the}} different regions of the brain and the timing of their activity.|$|E
5|$|Glucocorticoids <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> as {{effective}} as NSAIDs and may be used if contraindications exist for NSAIDs. They also lead to improvement when injected into the joint. A joint infection must be excluded, however, as steroids worsen this condition.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the late}} 1990s mobile devices {{have become more}} widely available, {{advancing}} beyond simple communication devices, and <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> rich forms of information, even for crime not traditionally associated with digital forensics. Despite this, digital analysis of phones has lagged behind traditional computer media, largely due to problems over the proprietary nature of devices.|$|E
5000|$|Pregnancy <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> {{increase}} {{levels of}} cortisol in the body. In particular, breast-feeding <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> decrease levels of cortisol {{in the short-term}} even if a mother is exposed to a psychosocial stressor.|$|R
25|$|Some illegal {{weight loss}} {{products}} imported into Ireland <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> contain sibutramine. Similar concerns <b>have</b> <b>been</b> raised in Australia, where illegal imported supplements <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> contain sibutramine, resulting in public alerts from Australia's Therapeutic Goods Administration.|$|R
25|$|Modification of {{astrocyte}} coverage at the synapses in {{the hippocampus}} <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> {{result from the}} induction of LTP, which <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> linked {{to the release of}} D-serine, nitric oxide, and the chemokine, s100B by astrocytes.|$|R
5|$|Their limited {{dispersal}} {{makes the}} newts {{especially vulnerable to}} fragmentation, i.e. the loss of connections for exchange between suitable habitats. High concentrations of road salt <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> lethal to crested newts.|$|E
5|$|After a duel, it {{is common}} for two male giraffes to caress and court each other. Such {{interactions}} between males <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more frequent than heterosexual coupling. In one study, up to 94 percent of observed mounting incidents took place between males. The proportion of same-sex activities varied from 30–75 percent. Only one percent of same-sex mounting incidents occurred between females.|$|E
5|$|Gout {{is partly}} genetic, {{contributing}} to about 60% of variability in uric acid level. The SLC2A9, SLC22A12 and ABCG2 genes <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{commonly associated with}} gout and variations in them can approximately double the risk. Loss-of-function mutations in SLC2A9 and SLC22A12 cause hereditary hypouricaemia by reducing urate absorption and unopposed urate secretion. The rare genetic disorders familial juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy, medullary cystic kidney disease, phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase superactivity and hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency as seen in Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, are complicated by gout.|$|E
25|$|Estrogen <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> {{increase}} the secretion of oxytocin and to {{increase the}} expression of its receptor, the oxytocin receptor, in the brain. In women, a single dose of estradiol <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> sufficient to increase circulating oxytocin concentrations.|$|R
5000|$|Telmisartan <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{activity}} {{against a}} variety of cancers in vitro, including prostate, renal, colon, leukemia, and ovarian cancer. [...] The mechanisms of telmisartan's anti-cancer activity <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> include up-regulation of proliferator-activated-receptor (PPAR) pathway, Bcl-2, and caspase activation.|$|R
25|$|Cimetidine <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> possess {{clinically}} significant albeit weak antiandrogen activity at high doses. It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> directly and competitively displace testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and antagonize the androgen receptor (AR) in animals. In addition, cimetidine <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> inhibit 2-hydroxylation of estradiol (via inhibition of CYP450 enzymes, which {{are involved in}} the metabolic inactivation of estradiol), resulting in increased levels of estrogen. By increasing estrogen levels, cimetidine can also decrease testosterone and increase prolactin levels.|$|R
5|$|High {{blood lead}} levels in adults are also {{associated}} with decreases in cognitive performance and with psychiatric symptoms such as depression and anxiety. It {{was found in a}} large group of current and former inorganic lead workers in Korea that blood lead levels in the range of 20–50μg/dL were correlated with neuro-cognitive defects. Increases in blood lead levels from about 50 to about 100μg/dL in adults <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> associated with persistent, and possibly permanent, impairment of central nervous system function.|$|E
5|$|In addition, land {{availability}} {{has a large}} {{effect on}} the available solar energy because solar panels can only be set up on land that is otherwise unused and suitable for solar panels. Roofs <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a suitable place for solar cells, as many people have discovered that they can collect energy directly from their homes this way. Other areas that are suitable for solar cells are lands that are not being used for businesses where solar plants can be established.|$|E
5|$|Malaria parasites contain apicoplasts, organelles {{usually found}} in plants, {{complete}} {{with their own}} genomes. These apicoplasts {{are thought to have}} originated through the endosymbiosis of algae and {{play a crucial role in}} various aspects of parasite metabolism, such as fatty acid biosynthesis. Over 400 proteins <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> produced by apicoplasts and these are now being investigated as possible targets for novel anti-malarial drugs.|$|E
50|$|Skull {{morphology}} <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> vary {{in animals}} separated by space in this broad region. Skull length <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> vary independently from body length. From comparative analysis in morphology, two sub populations <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> exist; one being {{centered in the}} Tien-Shan region and a southern population being found in the Pamir-Hindu Kush mountain system. Like many rodents, the silvery mountain vole possesses hypsodont molars that are ever growing, and are adapted for feeding on fibrous material.|$|R
50|$|The {{growth rate}} of this species <b>is</b> rapid. Juveniles <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> {{increase}} the diameter of their bases by 0.6 to 0.8 mm per day. By the age of 5 months, they <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> reach an average basal diameter of 45 mm.|$|R
5000|$|The only widely studied emotion, {{with respect}} to persuasion, <b>is</b> fear. Fear <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> force {{individuals}} [...] "to break from routine and {{pay close attention to}} the external world," [...] including persuasive messages. Moreover, fear <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> encourage political engagement: ...|$|R
5|$|Peptides {{in black}} mamba venom <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{effective}} analgesics. These peptides, {{part of the}} 'three-finger' family of snake venom toxins (mambalgins), act as inhibitors for acid-sensing ion channels in the central and peripheral nervous system, causing a pain-inihibiting effect. While this effect can be as strong as that of morphine, mambalgins {{do not have a}} resistance to naloxone, suffer less from induced tolerance, and cause no respiratory distress.|$|E
5|$|Since {{they were}} named, the {{proteins}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> differentially expressed in other glands that secrete products {{directly into the}} external environment. These include lacrimal, parotid, submaxillary, sublingual, preputial and mammary glands. In some species, such as cats and pigs, Mups appear not to be expressed in urine at all and are mainly found in saliva. Sometimes the term urinary Mups (uMups) is used to distinguish those Mups expressed in urine from those in other tissues.|$|E
5|$|According to a 1997 U.S. Census Bureau report {{less than}} 10% of {{severely}} disabled individuals were employed. Despite the various barriers to employment, some AAC users achieve success in educational endeavours and employment, though often in lower paying jobs. Factors that <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> related to employment are a strong {{work ethic and}} access to AAC technology, the support of family and friends, education, and work skills. Individuals with ALS who use AAC may continue working; factors supporting continued employment include access to AAC, support from employers, governmental programs and others. Employers of AAC users report that skills in time management, problem solving, communication, technology and a good education are important to employers.|$|E
5000|$|Gender <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> impact {{base line}} levels of cortisol, {{contributing}} to between-person variance. In generally stressful situations, levels of cortisol in males <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> increase to {{nearly double the}} amount when compared to females. In stressful social situations (i.e. social rejection challenge), however, women but not men tend to show {{significantly higher levels of}} cortisol.|$|R
50|$|MK-386 <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> {{significantly}} decrease {{concentrations of}} DHT in sebum, similarly to the selective 5α-reductase type II inhibitor finasteride. However, whereas finasteride results {{in only a}} modest reduction in sebum DHT levels of 15%, MK-386 <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> produce a significantly greater reduction of 55%. While finasteride decreases semen DHT levels by approximately 88%, MK-386 <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> no effect on levels of DHT in semen. These findings are {{in accordance with the}} known tissue distribution of 5α-reductase isoforms.|$|R
25|$|Triclosan <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a weak {{endocrine}} disruptor, {{though the}} relevance of this to humans is uncertain. The compound <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> bind with low affinity to both the androgen receptor and the estrogen receptor, where both agonistic and antagonistic responses <b>have</b> <b>been</b> observed.|$|R
5|$|At {{least two}} species of bird lice, Colpocephalum cooki and Ciconiphilus temporalis have been found as ectoparasites. Healthy adult birds have no natural predators, and the only {{recorded}} causes of premature mortality are due to the direct or indirect actions of humans; such as, poisoning, shooting, or electrocution when the birds accidentally fly into overhead electricity wires. Captive birds <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> susceptible to avian influenza (H5N1) and high mortality was noted at a facility in Cambodia, with two-thirds of infected birds dying. The longest recorded life span in captivity was 43 years.|$|E
5|$|Banksia cuneata was {{declared}} critically endangered after a 1982 survey found only five populations comprising about 450 plants. The largest population, consisting of around 300 plants, {{was on a}} conservation reserve, but all others were on road verges, and contained only 50–70 plants each. However, since then more plants have been located, and populations <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> gradually increasing {{in response to a}} number of conservation measures including fencing and baiting of rabbits. In recognition of its slight recovery, it is now considered endangered but no longer critically so.|$|E
5|$|Deep sky {{surveys show}} that galaxies are often found in groups and clusters. Solitary galaxies that have not {{significantly}} interacted with another galaxy of comparable mass during the past billion years are relatively scarce. Only about 5% of the galaxies surveyed <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> truly isolated; however, these isolated formations may have interacted and even merged with other galaxies in the past, and may still be orbited by smaller, satellite galaxies. Isolated galaxies can produce stars {{at a higher rate}} than normal, as their gas is not being stripped by other nearby galaxies.|$|E
50|$|Treatment {{for this}} rare genetic {{disorder}} can be physical therapy, there <b>have</b> <b>been</b> antibiotics <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> affective, and surgery <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> another solution.|$|R
25|$|Testosterone <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> {{act as an}} {{antagonist}} of the TrkA and p75NTR, receptors for the neurotrophin nerve {{growth factor}} (NGF), with high affinity (around 5nM). In contrast to testosterone, DHEA and DHEA sulfate <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> act as high-affinity agonists of these receptors.|$|R
