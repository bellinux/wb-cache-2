40|$|Objectives : Optimum viewing {{conditions}} facilitate {{identification of}} radiographic details and decrease {{the need for}} retakes, patients’ costs and radiation dose. This study sought to evaluate the effects of different viewing conditions on radiographic interpretation. Materials and Methods: This diagnostic study was performed by evaluating radiograph of a 7 mm-thick aluminum block, in which 10 holes with 2 mm diameters were randomly drilled with depths ranging from 0. 05 mm to 0. 50 mm. The radiograph was viewed by four oral radiologists independently under four viewing conditions, including a white light viewing light box <b>in</b> <b>a</b> lit <b>room,</b> yellow light viewing light box <b>in</b> <b>a</b> lit <b>room,</b> white light viewing light box <b>in</b> <b>a</b> dark <b>room</b> and yellow light viewing light box <b>in</b> <b>a</b> dark <b>room.</b> Number of circular shadows observed on the film was recorded. The data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA. Results: The mean number of detected circular shadows was 6. 75, 7. 5, 7. 25 and 7. 75 in white light viewing light box <b>in</b> <b>a</b> lit <b>room,</b> white light viewing light box <b>in</b> <b>a</b> dark <b>room,</b> yellow light viewing light box <b>in</b> <b>a</b> lit <b>room</b> and yellow light viewing light box <b>in</b> <b>a</b> dark <b>room,</b> respectively. Although the surrounding illumination had statistically {{significant effect on the}} radiographic details (P≤ 0. 03), the light color of the viewing light box had no significant effect on visibility of the radiographic details. Conclusion: White and yellow light of the viewing light box had no significant effect on visibility of the radiographic details but more information was obtained <b>in</b> <b>a</b> dark <b>room.</b> </p...|$|R
5|$|In both {{of these}} works the candlelit setting had a realist justification. Viewing {{sculpture}} by candlelight, when the contours showed well and there might even be an impression of movement from the flickering light, was a fashionable practice described by Goethe. In the orrery demonstration the shadows cast by the lamp representing the sun were {{an essential part of}} the display, used to demonstrate eclipses. But there seems no reason other than heightened drama to stage the air pump experiment <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>room</b> lit by a single candle, and in two later paintings of the subject by Charles-Amédée-Philippe van Loo the lighting is normal.|$|E
