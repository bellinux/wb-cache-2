This wastewater was originated from all aspects of human sanitary water usage. It is a potential wastewater source to be treated in future. It is because it contributes the most to water pollution problem. Adsorption, chemical reaction, filtration, ion-exchange, coagulation, flocculation reverse osmosis and so on are the technologies used to treatwater and wastewater. Those technologies are costly and involved a lot of chemical usage and {{create a lot of}} chemical sludge. In addition, rice husk causes disposal problem because it is a hardly biodegraded materials and contains highly in silica when it is in ash form which will reduce the quality of soil. The aims {{of this study was to}} design a low cost and effective filter by adding agriculture waste to purify domestic wastewater, evaluate the potential of modified rice husk slow sand filter, MRHSSF in treating domestic wastewater to achieve the standard A and Class 1 of wastewater standard and investigate the optimum retention time for the optimum effectiveness of MRHSSF in removal of the impurities in domestic wastewater. The MRHSSF consist of four components which are sand bed with 0. 15 mm to 0. 30 mm and 0. 625 mm to 1. 18 mm diameter in size, 0. 5 mol sulph 7 ate acid modified rice husk (0. 075 mm - 0. 015 mm diameter), 10 mm diameter river gravels and under drainage. The selected domestic wastewater was filtrate using MRHSSF and all the raw and treated water samples were tested to know its contaminants. This study successfully shows that modified rice husk slow sand filter, MRHSSF was effectively removed up to 100...|$|E

40|$|International audiencePseudomonas aeruginosa is an {{opportunistic}} {{bacterial pathogen}} that is widely {{occurring in the}} environment and is recognized for its capacity to form or join biofilms. The present review consolidates current knowledge on P. aeruginosa ecology and its implication in healthcare <b>facilities</b> <b>premise</b> plumbing. The adaptability of P. aeruginosa and its capacity to integrate the biofilm from the faucet and the drain highlight the role premise plumbing devices can play in promoting growth and persistence. A meta-analysis of P. aeruginosa prevalence in faucets (manual and electronic) and drains reveals the large variation in device positivity reported and suggest the high variability in the sampling approach and context as {{the main reason for}} this variation. The effects of the operating conditions that prevail within water distribution systems (disinfection, temperature, and hydraulic regime) on the persistence of P. aeruginosa are summarized. As a result from the review, recommendations for proactive control measures of water contamination by P. aeruginosa are presented. A better understanding of the ecology of P. aeruginosa and key influencing factors in premise plumbing are essential to identify culprit areas and implement effective control measure...|$|R

50|$|In 1978, Japan allowed China Airlines {{to return}} to Tokyo International Airport at Haneda after {{relocating}} all other airlines at the New Tokyo International Airport at Narita, leaving China Airlines as the sole international operator at Haneda, {{which at the time}} was an exclusive domestic <b>facility.</b> The <b>premise</b> being that air carriers from the PRC and Taiwan were prevented crossing paths at any Japanese airports. Thus CAL's Osaka service, due to the city's only airport at Itami, would not be reinstated until years later. The crossing of flag-carriers (Taiwan based-airlines and Mainland China PRC based-airlines) occurred almost hourly at then British-controlled Hong Kong's Kaitak International Airport. Adversely, other regional airports such as Bangkok, Singapore and Manila were entirely spared of this indignity imposed on Japan by China.|$|R

40|$|High {{technology}} incubators {{have been}} funded in universities by the UK government {{as part of}} the ‘third mission’ for higher education (DTI 2000 a). The provision of such <b>facilities</b> is <b>premised</b> on the notion that new technology firms achieve success at least in part from the benefits of incubators as rich networked environments where specialist knowledge acquisition can occur. This paper presents a exploration of how this process takes place, based on a case study of the high-tech incubator at the University of Southampton. The paper shows that firm founders adopt different approaches to the networked environment provided by the incubator; in this case the shift from Directorial support to that embedding in external networks was significant as firms grew. Taking account of this process should enable incubator managers to develop practices that ensure firms gain maximum advantage from the available resources...|$|R
