5000|$|For the 1999-2004 Jeep Grand Cherokees {{using the}} NV247 {{transfer}} case, in [...] "4-All Time" [...] mode torque {{is applied to}} only the rear wheels under normal driving conditions. A <b>gerotor</b> <b>pump</b> is connected between {{the front and rear}} output shafts and senses any speed difference between them. When the shafts are turning at different speeds (wheel slippage), the pump supplies oil under pressure to a wet clutch pack. The clutch pack applies progressive 0 to 100% locking between the front and rear output shafts. For example, if the rear axle starts rotating at a significantly higher rate than the front axle, the <b>gerotor</b> <b>pump</b> causes the clutch pack to progressively lock, transferring torque to the front axle until both axles are driven at the same speed. The apply pressure in the clutch pack bleeds off slowly, which progressively unlocks the clutch pack and biases torque output towards [...] "rear only" [...] unless the rear wheels are still slipping.

40|$|The {{technology}} of gerotor pumps is progressing towards cutting-edge applications in emerging sectors, {{which are more}} demanding for pump performance. Moreover, recent environmental standards are heading towards leakage-free and noiseless hydraulic systems. Hence, in order to respond to these demands, this study, which will {{be referred to as}} the GeroMAG concept, aims to make a leap from the standard <b>gerotor</b> <b>pump</b> technology: a sealed, compact, non-shaft-driven <b>gerotor</b> <b>pump</b> with a magnetically-driving outer rotor. The GeroMAG pump is conceived as a variable-flow pump to accomplish a standard volumetric flow rate at low rotational speed with satisfactory volumetric efficiency. By following the authors’ methodology based on a catalogue of best-practice rules, a custom trochoidal gear set is designed. Then, two main technological challenges are encountered: how to generate the rotational movement of the driving outer rotor and how to produce the guide of rotation of the gear set once there is no drive shaft. To confront them, a quiet magnet brushless motor powers the driving outer rotor through pole pieces placed in its external sideway and the rotational movement is guided by the inner edgewise pads carved on it. Subsequently, GeroMAG pump architecture, prototype, housing, methodology, materials and manufacture will be presented. As a principal conclusion, the GeroMAG proof of concept and pump prototype are feasible, which is corroborated by experimental results and performance indexes.

40|$|<b>Gerotor</b> <b>pumps</b> are a kind {{of fluid}} power {{machines}} widely used in the automotive field, especially for fuel injection as well as lubrication. To improve the performance of these units, virtual prototyping is necessary to decrease time and cost related to trial and error. Within this research a simulation model for Gerotor units has been developed with the aim of predicting accurately the performance of a generic unit. The model can accurately predict the system behavior regarding mechanical and volumetric losses by considering real machining tolerances and their interactions. Ultimately, this model should help to design new generations of Gerotor units and to improve existing ones by improving their efficiency. To justify and refine the model, a test-rig which can enable measurements of rotor micro-motions of the gears of Gerotors is needed. This paper proposes an innovative approach for measuring micro-motions together with the design of a test-rig specifically conceived to allow such measurements. Reference Gerotor units will be put in a specially designed pump housing. The measurements will be performed using capacitive sensors capable of measuring the lubricant film thickness in the lubricated gaps. In this way, the micro-motions of the reference Gerotor unit can be detected. A data acquisition system will be created to collect the experimental data.

By allowing the eccentric ring to pivot or translate relative to the rotor, the displacement can be varied.

Hydraulic systems capability of creating high forces with small electronic control devices has found wide application, and electro hydraulic components are widely used in applications that require precise actuator control or matching of variable working conditions. Hydraulic is widely used in many sectors. In this PhD Thesis the research has been focused on the optimization of hydraulic components used in the industrial fields and on engines for lubrication circuits. In recent years, many studies were initiated to improve the performance of hydraulic components. However, the scientific understanding of valves, pumps and transmissions operation is limited {{because of the lack of}} three-dimensional fluid dynamics computation capability.

The methodology has been applied for the study of several different applications. Using a three-dimensional CFD approach it is possible to improve component performance and the understanding of the internal flow of each component.

When the outer rotors have the same volume, the sealing performance of the rotor profile can be assessed using the curvature difference method, which indicates that sealing remains the same across various span angle designs. The tooth profile is built using mathe-matical models of the rotor, and fluid and dynamics analyses are conducted to predict actual pump operation. The overall fluid analysis, which models both compressibility and cavitation, clearly illustrates {{the complexity of the}} fluid flow inside the pump. Comparisons of the results for three separate span angle designs then reveal that the larger the span angle, the higher the area efficiency, outlet pressure, outlet flow rate, outlet flow velocity, and gas volume. A subsequent dynamics analysis further suggests that different span angle designs may lead to diverse contact force distribution on the inner and outer rotors.

40|$|Accurate {{simulation}} models of gerotor pumps require knowledge of geometric features of these units. Instantaneous volumes of chambers {{as well as}} their volume derivatives lead to kinematic flow rate, flow ripple index, displacement. Flow passage areas between a chamber and the inlet/delivery volumes during a complete shaft revolution also need to be known. General analytical methods (integral-derivative and derivative-integral) have been developed for the calculation of geometric quantities of gear as well as vane pumps and will be reported in the paper with specific emphasis on gerotor units. The approach leading to these geometric informations has traditionally been grounded on a 2 D analysis of involved features.

40|$|The {{technology}} of lubrication systems for aircrafts engines has seen significant development during {{the history of}} aeronautics and has progressed in parallel with {{the evolution of the}} engines themselves. Starting from the first, wetsump schemes derived from automotive applications, more complex systems and components have been introduced. The progressive increase of aeronautic engines' power and speed, {{as well as that of}} the maximum operative altitude of the aircraft, have increased the lubricant flow rate required to avoid severe mechanical issues that can cause dangerous conditions for the vehicle and its users. Currently, the main focus on the development of novel lubrication pumps is aimed at reducing the pumps' weight and envelope while maintaining, or possibly increasing, their reliability. The first two objective could be pursued by searching for novel pump types and/or increasing the pump speed in order to downsize its required capacity, but the low-pressure environment, typical of the lubrication circuits, over imposes a few, severe, limitations to avoid cavitation occurrence that decrease the effectiveness of this approach. The central aim of the presented research, performed within the program "Greening the Propulsion", is to provide a theoretical framework to help in the development of a novel <b>gerotor</b> <b>pump</b> for the lubrication of aeronautic engines. The first step of the research involves the study of the state of the art of aeronautic engines' lubrication systems, providing particular care to the effect that any design choice and possible operational condition may have on the lubrication pump design. Hence, the state of the art for gerotor pumps is investigated; results of this study are used, along with catalogue comparisons, to build simplified sizing tools to perform a benchmarking activity involving gerotors and other low pressure pumps type. This activity, performed to position gerotor pumps in the aeronautic engine lubrication market, is then used as a starting point to highlight the weak points of gerotors traditional design and to propose some possible solutions to enhance the pumps performances. To study the outcomes of these modifications, a rigorous theoretical framework is required; sizing and modeling criteria, based on the theory of gearing and compressible fluids, are hence detailed and used to build an Automatic Design and Simulation Framework, able to automatically design, validate and simulate a novel <b>gerotor</b> <b>pump</b> given a minimum number of geometrical and physical input parameters. This design and simulation tool is then used to evaluate the performance boost provided by the proposed variations and to optimize the gears profiles by pairing it with a multiobjective algorithm based on evolutionary strategies. Another critical component of any lubrication system is the pressure relief valve used to avoid the occurrence of dangerous conditions for the pipes integrity. A side activity involving the study of a preliminary sizing tool for pressure relief valve is hence performed. A preliminary design framework is presented and discussed, highlighting the importance of the valve discharge coefficient. To study its dependence on the valve's geometry, a lengthy CFD simulation campaign is performed varying the poppet shape and the fluid Reynolds' number.

40|$|Abstract — Positive {{displacement}} pumps {{are used in}} auto-motive transmissions to provide pressurized fluid to various hydraulic components in the transmission and also lubricate the mechanical components. The output flow of these pumps increases with speed, almost linearly, but the flow requirements often saturate at higher speeds resulting in the excess flow draining back to the sump. This represents a parasitic loss in the transmission leading to a loss in fuel economy. To overcome this issue, variable {{displacement pumps}} {{have been used in}} the transmission, where the output flow is reduced by controlling the displacement of the pump. The use of these pumps in automatic transmissions, has resulted in better fuel economy as compared to some types of fixed displacement pumps. However, the literature does not fully explore the benefits of variable displacement pumps to a specific type of transmission namely, dual-clutch transmission, that has different pressure & flow requirements than an epicyclic gear-train. This paper presents an analysis on the effect of pump selection on fuel economy in a five speed dual clutch transmission of a commercial vehicle. Models of the engine, transmission & vehicle are developed along with the models of two different types of pumps: a fixed displacement <b>gerotor</b> <b>pump</b> and a variable displacement vane pump. The models are then parameterized using experimental data and the fuel economy of the vehicle is simulated on a standard driving cycle. The results suggest that the fuel economy benefit obtained by the use of the variable displacement pump in dual clutch transmissions is comparable to that of automatic transmissions. I...|$|E
