5|$|Entering the Olympics, the Australian public {{expected}} Thorpe {{to deliver}} multiple world records and gold medals as a formality; Sydney's Daily Telegraph posted a front-page spread headlined Invincible. Thorpe cruised through the heats of the 400m {{on the first}} morning of competition, posting a new Olympic record and shortening bookmakers' odds to 50–1. By the time the final was held that night, the pressure had intensified—the host nation had yet to win its first gold medal. Thorpe led throughout, and although Italy's Massimiliano Rosolino was within a body length at the 300m mark, Thorpe's finishing kick extended the final margin to three body lengths. This set a new world record of 3min 40.59s. Secret tests {{carried out by the}} Italian National Olympic Committee prior to the Olympics later showed that Rosolino had abnormal levels of <b>human</b> <b>growth</b> hormone. Rosolino aside, Thorpe had left bronze medallist Klete Keller fifteen metres in arrears.|$|E

None of the patients received neoadjuvant therapy. For each case, 2 nonadjacent tissue samples from primary esophagogastric junction adenocarcinoma and 2 different metastatic nodes were considered (188 tissue samples in all). <b>Human</b> epithelial <b>growth</b> factor receptor 2 status was assessed by immunohistochemistry (PATHWAY-HER 2 /neu [4 B 5]; Ventana Medical Systems, Milan, Italy) and dual chromogenic in situ hybridization (duoCISH; DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark). Immunohistochemistry staining scores were nil in 22 tumors (47 %), 1 (21 %) in 10, 2 (13 %) in 6, and 3 (19 %) in 9. <b>Human</b> epithelial <b>growth</b> factor receptor 2 gene amplification (25. 5 %) was associated with more differentiated phenotype (Fisher exact test, P =. 039) and advanced tumor stage (Fisher exact test, P =. 015). Significant agreement was observed between <b>human</b> epithelial <b>growth</b> factor receptor 2 protein expression (immunohistochemistry) and <b>human</b> epithelial <b>growth</b> factor receptor 2 gene's amplification (chromogenic in situ hybridization) (κ = 0. 84, P <. 001).

In esophagogastric junction adenocarcinomas, <b>human</b> epithelial <b>growth</b> factor receptor 2 status (as assessed by immunohistochemistry and/or chromogenic in situ hybridization) is virtually unaffected by intratumor variability; it is consistent with findings in nodal metastases, and it reliably identifies patients with esophagogastric junction adenocarcinoma eligible for anti-human epithelial growth factor receptor 2 therapy...|$|R
40|$|Background: Recent {{studies have}} shown that the <b>human</b> {{epidermal}} <b>growth</b> factor receptor 2 status of a metastatic site may differ from that of the primary site. This difference may influ-ence patient prognosis and response to therapy. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study using immunohistochemistry and/or fluor-escent in situ hybridization to compare <b>human</b> epidermal <b>growth</b> factor receptor 2 and hormone receptor status in primary and metastatic breast cancers. Results: Fifty-six patients were included in this study. Conversion from hormone receptor positive in the primary tumor to hormone receptor negative in the metastasis occurred in 12 patients (21. 4 %), and hormone receptor negative to hormone receptor positive conversion occurred in two patients (3. 6 %). <b>Human</b> epidermal <b>growth</b> factor receptor 2 status was discor-dant between primary and metastatic lesions in seven patients (12. 5 %). All of the five patients who converted from <b>human</b> epidermal <b>growth</b> factor receptor 2 negative status to <b>human</b> epi-dermal <b>growth</b> factor receptor positive received trastuzumab-based chemotherapy.

40|$|Purpose: Repairing tendon {{injuries}} with recombinant <b>human</b> platelet-derived <b>growth</b> factor-BB {{has potential}} for improving surgical outcomes. Augmentation of sutures, {{a critical component}} of surgical tendon repair, by coating with growth factors may provide a clinically useful therapeutic device for improving tendon repair. Therefore, {{the purpose of this study}} was to (a) coat Vicryl sutures with a defined dose of recombinant <b>human</b> platelet-derived <b>growth</b> factor-BB without additional coating excipients (e. g. gelatin), (b) quantify the recombinant <b>human</b> platelet-derived <b>growth</b> factor-BB released from the suture, and (c) use the recombinant <b>human</b> platelet-derived <b>growth</b> factor-BB-coated sutures to enhance tendon repair in a rat Achilles tendon transection model. Methods: Vicryl sutures were coated with 0, 0. 3, 1. 0, and 10. 0 mg/mL concentrations of recombinant <b>human</b> platelet-derived <b>growth</b> factor-BB using a dip-coating process. In vitro release was quantified by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Acutely transected rat Achilles tendons were repaired using one of the four suture groups (n = 12 per group). Four weeks following repair, the tensile biomechanical and histological (i. e. collagen organization and angiogenesis) properties were determined. Results: A dose-dependent bolus release of recombinant <b>human</b> platelet-derived <b>growth</b> factor-BB occurred within the first hour in vitro, followed by a gradual release over 48 h. There was a significant increase in ultimate tensile strength (p < 0. 01) in the two highest recombinant <b>human</b> platelet-derived <b>growth</b> factor-BB dose groups (1. 9 ± 0. 5 and 2. 1 ± 0. 5 MPa) relative to controls (1. 0 ± 0. 2 MPa). The modulus significantly increased (p = 0. 031) with the highest recombinant <b>human</b> platelet-derived <b>growth</b> factor-BB dose group (7. 2 ± 3. 8 MPa) relative to all other groups (control: 3. 5 ± 0. 9 MPa). No significant differences were identified for the maximum load or stiffness. The histological collagen and angiogenesis scores were comparable in all groups, although there was a trend for improved collagen organization in the recombinant <b>human</b> platelet-derived <b>growth</b> factor-BB-treated groups (p = 0. 054). Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that recombinant <b>human</b> platelet-derived <b>growth</b> factor-BB can be used to reproducibly coat Vicryl sutures and improve remodeling in a rat Achilles tendon transection model by significantly decreasing the resulting cross-sectional area, thus improving the material properties of the repaired tendon...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{cleavage}} site of <b>human</b> insulin-like <b>growth</b> factor binding protein- 3 by urinary prostate specific antigen was examined. <b>human</b> insulin-like <b>growth</b> factor binding protein- 3 was incubated with urinary prostate specific antigen at 37 °C and its proteolyzed fragments {{were separated by}} a reversed phase HPLC followed by N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis, demonstrating that the cleavage mainly occurred at Tyr- 159.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Human</b> {{population}} <b>growth</b> has typically {{been seen}} as the primary causative factor of other ecologi-cally destructive phenomena. Current human disease epidemics are explored {{as a function of}} population size. That <b>human</b> population <b>growth</b> is itself a phenomenon with clearly identifiable ecological/biological causes has been overlooked. Here, <b>human</b> population <b>growth</b> is discussed as being subject to the same dynamic processes as the population growth of other species. Contrary to the widely held belief that food production must be increased to feed the growing population, experimental and correlational data indicate that <b>human</b> population <b>growth</b> varies as a function of food availability. By increasing food production for humans, {{at the expense of other}} species, the biologically determined effect has been, and continues to be, an increase in the human population. Understanding the relationship between food increases and population increases is proposed as a necessary first step in addressing this global problem. Resistance to this perspective is briefly discussed in terms of cultural bias in science...|$|R
