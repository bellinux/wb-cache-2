From the key-press records (Breese's were made on a <b>kymograph</b> drum), Breese was able to quantify rivalry in three ways: the number of periods of exclusive visibility of each stimulus (the rate of rivalry), the total duration of exclusive visibility of each stimulus, and the average duration of each period of rivalry.|$|E

40|$|<b>Kymographs</b> or space-time plots {{are widely}} used in cell biology to reduce the {{dimensions}} of a time-series in microscopy for both qualitative and quantitative insight into spatio-temporal dynamics. While multiple tools for image kymography have been described before, quantification remains largely manual. Here, we describe a novel software tool for automated multi-peak tracking kymography (AMTraK), which uses peak information and distance minimization to track and automatically quantify <b>kymographs,</b> integrated in a GUI. The program takes fluorescence time-series data as an input and tracks contours in the <b>kymographs</b> based on intensity and gradient peaks. By integrating a branch-point detection method, {{it can be used}} to identify merging and splitting events of tracks, important in separation and coalescence events. In tests with synthetic images, we demonstrate sub-pixel positional accuracy of the program. We test the program by quantifying sub-cellular dynamics in rod-shaped bacteria, microtubule (MT) transport and vesicle dynamics. A time-series of E. coli cell division with labeled nucleoid DNA is used to identify the time-point and rate at which the nucleoid segregates. The mean velocity of microtubule (MT) gliding motility due to a recombinant kinesin motor is estimated as 0. 5 μm/s, in agreement with published values, and comparable to estimates using software for nanometer precision filament-tracking. We proceed to employ AMTraK to analyze previously published time-series microscopy data where <b>kymographs</b> had been manually quantified: clathrin polymerization kinetics during vesicle formation and anterograde and retrograde transport in axons. AMTraK analysis not only reproduces the reported parameters, it also provides an objective and automated method for reproducible analysis of <b>kymographs</b> from in vitro and in vivo fluorescence microscopy time-series of sub-cellular dynamics...|$|R

This theory was supported by published experimental data (Wang et al., 2011) and by our results.

30|$|To {{study the}} axonal {{transport}} process, {{it is important}} to follow the trajectories of individual axonal cargos over time. Generating <b>kymographs</b> from time-lapse images is perhaps the most frequently used technique in studying mitochondrial axonal transport (e.g., Miller and Sheetz, 2004; Hollenbeck and Saxton, 2005; references within Wang et al., 2011). In this type of analysis, indices such as instantaneous velocity, run time in both directions (anterograde versus retrograde) have been used to characterize mitochondrial movement. These parameters can be determined by using general-purpose image processing software. In some studies, Matlab-based programs were developed to achieve automatic analyses (Wang and Schwarz., 2009 b). These published methods have three major limitations. First, the lack of an efficient imaging method for mitochondrial movement resulted in the labor-intensive and time-consuming nature of the published methods. Second, insufficient sample sizes limited the reliability and sensitivity of published analysis programs. Third, mathematical models for describing and quantifying mitochondrial movement patterns were not established. These limitations made the published methods inadequate for high-throughput analyses (Bros et al., 2015). Here we report a new method for studying the dynamic progress of axonal mitochondrial transport by coupling a highly efficient imaging method with automated mitochondrial tracking and motion pattern analysis algorithms.|$|R

40|$|Myosin 10 is an actin-based {{molecular}} motor that localizes to {{the tips of}} filopodia in mammalian cells. To understand how it is targeted to this distinct region of the cell we have used total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) to study the movement of individual full length and truncated GFP-tagged molecules. Truncation mutants lacking the motor region failed to localize to filopodial tips but still bound transiently at the plasma membrane. Deletion of the single alpha helical (SAH) and anti-parallel coiled-coil forming regions, which lie between the motor and PH domains, reduced the instantaneous velocity of intrafilopodial movement but {{did not affect the}} number of substrate adherent filopodia. Deletion of the anti-parallel coiled-coil forming region, but not the EKR rich region of the SAH domain restored intrafilopodial trafficking, suggesting this region is important in determining myosin 10 motility.

40|$|During sporulation, the {{filamentous}} bacteria Streptomyces undergo a massive cell division event {{in which the}} synthesis of ladders of sporulation septa convert multigenomic hyphae into chains of unigenomic spores. This process requires cytokinetic Z-rings formed by the bacterial tubulin homolog FtsZ, and the stabilization of the newly formed Z-rings is crucial for completion of septum synthesis. Here we show that two dynamin-like proteins, DynA and DynB, play critical roles in this process. Dynamins are a family of large, multidomain GTPases involved in key cellular processes in eukaryotes, including vesicle trafficking and organelle division. Many bacterial genomes encode dynamin-like proteins, but the biological function of these proteins has remained largely enigmatic. Using a cell biological approach, we show that the two Streptomyces dynamins specifically localize to sporulation septa in an FtsZ-dependent manner. Moreover, dynamin mutants have a cell division defect due to the decreased stability of sporulation-specific Z-rings, as demonstrated by <b>kymographs</b> derived from time-lapse images of FtsZ ladder formation. This defect causes the premature disassembly of individual Z-rings, leading to the frequent abortion of septum synthesis, which in turn results {{in the production of}} long spore-like compartments with multiple chromosomes. Two-hybrid analysis revealed that the dynamins are part of the cell division machinery and that they mediate their effects on Z-ring stability during developmentally controlled cell division via a network of protein–protein interactions involving DynA, DynB, FtsZ, SepF, SepF 2, and the FtsZ-positioning protein SsgB...|$|R

40|$|Filopodia that {{protrude}} {{forward from}} the lamellipodium, located {{at the leading edge}} of a neuronal growth cone, are needed to guide the extension of a nerve cell. At the core of each filopodium an actin bundle forms and grows into the lamellipodium. By using <b>kymographs</b> of time-lapse polarized light images we examined the relationship between the behavior of the filopodia, the actin bundles immediately proximal to the filopodia, and the shapes and composition of actin bundles in the whole lamellipodium. We find that the shapes of actin bundles, such as tilt, fork, and fused zones, originate at the leading edge and are surprisingly well preserved during retrograde transport of the actin cytoskeleton in the whole lamellipodium. The number of filaments that make up the radial actin bundles, as displayed by their birefringence retardation, also is preserved during retrograde flow over a distance of 4 - 8 microm from the leading edge into the lamellipodium. Thus, the disposition of the actin bundles in the lamellipodium frozen at any time point preserves and portrays a history of the past behavior of actin bundles proximal to the filopodia and the behavior of the filopodia themselves. These findings suggest that the arrangement of actin bundles in static image records, such as electron or fluorescence micrographs of fixed and stained specimens, can in fact reveal the sequence of the past history of filopodial behavior and the generation, density, fusion, etc. of the filaments in the actin bundles...|$|R

However, it is increasingly apparent that intracellular pressure, arising from myosin-II contraction, is a co-driver of motility. In its extreme form, pressure manifests itself as hemispherical protrusions, referred to as blebs, where membrane is torn from the underlying cortex. Although many components and signalling pathways have been identified, we lack a complete model of motility, particularly of the regulation and mechanics of blebbing. Advances in microscopy are continually improving the quality of time series image data, but the absence of highthroughput tools for extracting quantitative numbers remains an analysis bottle-neck. We develop the next generation of the successful QuimP software designed for automated analysis of motile cells, producing quantitative spatio-temporal maps of protein distributions and changes in cell morphology. Key to QuimP's new functionality, we present the Electrostatic Contour Migration Method (ECMM) that provides high resolution tracking of local deformation with better uniformity and efficiency than rival methods. Photobleaching experiments are used to give insight into the accuracy and limitations of in silico membrane tracking algorithms. We employ ECMM to build an automated protrusion tracking method (ECMM-APT) sensitive not only to pseudopodia, but also the complex characteristics of high speed blebs. QuimP is applied to characterising the protrusive behaviour of Dictyostelium, induced to bleb by imaging under agar. We show blebs are characterised by distinct speed-displacement distributions, can reach speeds of 4. 9 μm/sec, and preferentially form at the anks during chemotaxis. Significantly, blebs emerge from at to concave membrane regions suggesting curvature is a major determinant of bleb location, size, and speed. We hypothesise that actin driven pseudopodia at the leading edge induce changes in curvature and therefore membrane tension, positive curvature inhibiting blebbing at the very front, and negative curvature enhancing blebbing at the sides. This possibly provides the necessary space for rear advancement. Furthermore, bleb <b>kymographs</b> reveal a retrograde shift of the cortex at the point of bleb expansion, suggesting inward contractive forces acting on the cortex even at concave regions. Strains defficient in phospholipid signalling show impaired chemotaxis and blebbing. Finally, we present further applications of QuimP, for example, we conclusively show that dishevelled is not polarised during Xenopus gastrulation, contrary to hypotheses in the literature...|$|R
40|$|Directed cell {{migration}} {{is involved in}} a broad spectrum of biological phenomena, ranging from the metastatic spreading of cancer to the active migration of neutrophils in response to bacterial infection. It requires a tightly regulated, spatiotemporal coordination of underlying biochemical processes. However, our understanding of how these processes are spatiotemporally coordinated with the mechanics of {{cell migration}} is poor. The objective of this Dissertation is, therefore, to investigate the mechanics of cell migration using Fourier Traction Force Microscopy (FTFM) measurements to shed light onto the key role of specific cytoskeletal proteins in the migration process. Using an improved traction force cytometry method, we calculated the traction stresses of wild-type cells and a range of mutants with cytoskeletal deficiencies. We confirmed that for both wild type and mutants, the strength of the traction stresses and the cell length followed a quasi-periodic temporal evolution, supporting the existence of a motility cycle. In addition, we found that the cells with misregulated SCAR/WAVE-mediated, dendritic F-actin polymerization at the cell's leading edge were unable to move periodically, rendering their efficiency in migrating poor. We were able to demonstrate that wild type and cells lacking the SCAR/WAVE complex protein PIR 121 (pirA⁻) or SCAR (scrA⁻) exert stresses of different strength that correlate with their levels of F- actin, suggesting that the amount of F-actin present within a cell is a determinant of its stress strength. In addition to FTFM, we also constructed traction tension <b>kymographs</b> to obtain a space-time representation of traction stresses. Kymographic representation of the traction stresses allowed us to determine, for the first time, how the formation and disassembly of adhesions are coupled with the generation of axial and lateral traction stresses to control cell migration. Our findings revealed that wild-type cells migrate by switching between two motility modes with distinct adhesion and contractility dynamics. These two modes are not conserved when wild-type cells migrate on highly adhesive substrates, where cells implement modes that rely on lateral contractility. Finally, we observed that cells with cytoskeletal crosslinking defects (mhcA⁻ and abp 120 ⁻ cells) also move by developing increased lateral contractility. However, under conditions of increased adherence, they were unable to move due to their inability to augment the strength of their traction stresses, break their back adhesions, and migrate forwar...|$|R
