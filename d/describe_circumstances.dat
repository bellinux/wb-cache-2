The degree to which caucuses are used can be a key defining element, and often an identifier, of the mediation model being used. For example, [...] "facilitative mediation" [...] tends to discourage the use of caucuses and tries to keep the parties talking at a single table, while [...] "evaluative mediation" [...] may allow parties to separate more often and rely on the mediator to shuttle information and offers back and forth.|$|E

In our model, proportional plant-level costs of creating and destroying jobs cause shrinking plants {{to be more sensitive}} to aggregate shocks than growing plants. We <b>describe</b> <b>circumstances</b> in which this microeconomic asymmetry is preserved in the aggregate and show that it can account for much of the observed asymmetries in gross job flows.

40|$|In 1972, the {{potential}} gainfulness {{of free trade}} was established under fairly general assumptions — essentially those of Arrow and Debreu. Since then, the assumptions have been considerably weakened, notably by accommodating overlapping mortal generations and an inﬁnite horizon. However, there remain several indispensable but implausible assumptions. Two of those assumptions are examined, in a preliminary way, in the present paper: (a) in ﬁnite trade models of Arrow–Debreu type, each individual is sufﬁciently ill-informed or irrational to believe that he/she has no market power; (b) in models of overlapping generations and inﬁnite horizons, there are no intergenerational bequests or gifts inter vivos. Few clear generalizations are found. However, an attempt is made to <b>describe</b> <b>circumstances</b> under which assumptions (a) and (b) can be abandoned. 8 page(s...|$|E

In our model profit maximization in the presence of proportional plant-level costs of job creation and destruction implies that shrinking plants are more sensitive than growing plants to aggregate shocks. We <b>describe</b> <b>circumstances</b> in which this microeconomic asymmetry is preserved in the aggregate and show that it can account for asymmetries in the variability of job creation and destruction of the kind observed in the U. S. manufacturing sector. This is so even though we abstract from job search and matching frictions, incomplete contracts, and aggregate congestion effects, all of which have been put forward as important for understanding the job creation and destruction evidence.
