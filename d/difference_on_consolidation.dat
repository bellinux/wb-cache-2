40|$|The {{treatment}} of the <b>difference</b> arising <b>on</b> <b>consolidation</b> has been both a subject of debate (especially in the English-speaking counties) {{and a source of}} international diversity in financial reporting. The implementation of the EU Fourth and Seventh Directives could be expected {{to reduce the amount of}} this diversity so far as member states are concerned. To a large extent, the directives imposed methods which were generally accepted in the English-speaking countries; for example, what is now known as the 'former German method' was excluded. Nevertheless, the Directives left a fair amount of flexibility; alternative practices, some generally accepted in the UK and others in the USA, were permitted. This paper compares the {{treatment of}} the consolidation difference in two EU member states, France and the UK, based on an analysis of five years' financial statements of a random sample of seventy companies, in each country (700 sets of financial statements in all). The research shows that, notwithstanding the harmonizing effects of the Directives, substantial differences exist between the French and British treatments. In general, French recommended treatments are quite close to those required by U. S. GAAP, with a major exception in the treatment of 'quasi-goodwill' items such as brands. By contrast, the UK treatments differ from the U. S. and French treatments in some important respects; they also fail to comply with the revised IAS 22. On the other hand, the UK requirements are clearly documented and mandatory; hence the level of compliance is very high. By contrast the French requirements are variously and not always consistently documented and only partly mandatory; the levels of compliance are consequently lower. There was some evidence that the choice of treatment in the UK, as between immediate elimination against reserves and capitalization and amortiz-ation, was influenced by the company's level of gearing. No such choice exists in France, so no comparable analysis was possible. The research suggests that, in the case of the consolidation difference, the EU Directives left an arguably excessive degree of flexibility of treatment, a problem which it has been left to the revised IAS 22 to address. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractNucleos(t) ide {{analogue}} (NUC) {{resistance is}} an important clinical risk resulting from long-term therapy in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) management. Discontinuation of NUCs is a feasible strategy to reduce resistance. We aimed to observe the outcomes after NUC withdrawal in HBeAg-positive CHB patients. A total of 97 patients (11 patients with HBsAg loss and 86 patients with sustained HBeAg seroconversion) were enrolled. HBV DNA levels and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels were monitored regularly after discontinuation. Relapse was defined as HBV DNA levels > 2000 IU/mL {{in at least two}} determinations more than 4 weeks apart. HBeAg seroconversion was achieved within 48 weeks (interquartile range (IQR), 24 - 72 weeks). The time <b>on</b> <b>consolidation</b> therapy was 96 weeks (IQR, 84 - 144 weeks). No relapses occurred for HBsAg loss patients. Evidence of relapse was observed in 9. 3 % of HBeAg seroconversion patients. All relapse cases occurred within 48 weeks after discontinuation. The time to relapse was 33 ± 15 weeks. Elevation of HBV DNA and ALT levels over baseline were only observed in 12. 5 % of relapse patients. There {{were no significant differences in}} baseline characteristics (sex, HBV genotype, age or ALT levels) or time <b>on</b> <b>consolidation</b> therapy between patients with relapse or sustained response. NUC discontinuation in HBeAg-positive CHB patients is feasible after achieving HBeAg seroconversion at a minimum of 24 weeks. There is further benefit to prolonging the time <b>on</b> <b>consolidation</b> therapy to reduce relapse. More than 48 weeks of sustained response is a predictive marker for long-term sustained response...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} the effects of the arousal level of the rat and exposure to a behavioral stressor <b>on</b> acquisition, <b>consolidation</b> and retrieval of a non-aversive hippocampal-dependent learning paradigm, the object location task. Learning was tested under two arousal conditions: no previous habituation to the experimental context (high novelty stress/arousal level) or extensive prior habituation (reduced novelty stress/arousal level). Results indicated that in the habituated rats, exposure to an out-of-context stressor (i. e, elevated platform stress) impaired consolidation and retrieval, but not acquisition, of the task. Non-habituated animals under both stressed and control conditions did not show retention of the task. In habituated rats, RU- 486 (10 ng/side), a glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonist, or propranolol (0. 75 µg/side), a beta-adrenergic antagonist, injected into the basolateral amygdala (BLA), prevented the impairing effects of the stressor <b>on</b> <b>consolidation,</b> but not <b>on</b> retrieval. The CB 1 /CB 2 receptor agonist WIN 55, 212 - 2 (WIN, 5 µg/side) microinjected into the BLA did not prevent the effects of stress <b>on</b> either <b>consolidation</b> or retrieval. Taken together the results suggest that: (i) GR and β-adrenergic receptors in the BLA mediate the impairing effects of stress <b>on</b> the <b>consolidation,</b> but not the retrieval, of a neutral, non-aversive hippocampal-dependent task, (ii) the impairing effects of stress <b>on</b> hippocampal <b>consolidation</b> and retrieval are mediated by different neural mechanisms (i. e., different neurotransmitters or different brain areas), and (iii) the effects of stress on memory depend on the interaction between several main factors such as the stage of memory processing under investigation, the animal's level of arousal {{and the nature of the}} task (neutral or aversive) ...|$|R
