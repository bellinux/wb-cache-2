50|$|Comino {{arrived in}} Sydney in 1873 as {{a crew member}} on a sailing ship and found work at the Balmain Colliery. A <b>fish-and-chips</b> shop owned by a Welshman in Oxford Street, Sydney and his {{familiarity}} with seafood in the Greek islands pointed him {{to the idea of}} a similar venture. In 1878, he opened an oyster saloon a few doors down from the <b>fish-and-chips</b> shop. From 1882 he took up the lease of oyster beds at the mouth of the Lane Cove River, then Port Jackson and the Evans River on the north coast. His brother John Comino came to Australia in 1885 and operated oyster leases on the Bermagui River.|$|E
5000|$|Roadside {{stands and}} small-town {{restaurants}} typically serve fried chicken, <b>fish-and-chips</b> and [...] "tasty bakes" [...] which are fried dough made with flour, water and sugar or sometimes salt, along with cold drinks.

2500|$|The modern <b>fish-and-chip</b> shop ("chippy" [...] or [...] "chipper" [...] {{in modern}} British slang) {{originated}} in the United Kingdom, although outlets selling fried food occurred commonly throughout Europe. Early <b>fish-and-chip</b> shops had only very basic facilities. Usually these consisted principally of a large cauldron of cooking fat, heated by a coal fire.

50|$|In Australia, {{they are}} caught by {{southern}} shark gillnet fishery, particularly in Bass Strait and south-east Tasmania, though this fishery targets the gummy shark, Mustelus antarcticus, and will sometimes discard ghostsharks {{due to the}} considerably lower price they fetch at market. They are also a popular target of recreational fishers in Westernport Bay, Victoria and in the inshore waters of south-east Tasmania. Their white flesh fillets are very popular with <b>fish-and-chips</b> restaurants in New Zealand and is sold as 'flake' or 'whitefish' in Australia.|$|E

5000|$|Saveloys {{are popular}} in New Zealand and Australia, {{where they are}} larger than the English type. Beef and chicken {{varieties}} are also available. Although they are sold at <b>fish-and-chips</b> shops as in England, they are commonly bought at butchers' shops or supermarkets and cooked by boiling at home. Saveloys are known colloquially as [...] "savs". They are often {{the basis of the}} New Zealand battered-sausage-on-a-stick 'hot dog', equivalent to a US corn dog, often sold at fairgrounds and public events. A cocktail sausage is a smaller version of the saveloy, {{about a quarter of the}} size, sometimes called a baby sav, a [...] "little boy" [...] or [...] "cheerio". These are a popular children's party food in New Zealand and Australia, often served hot alongside sweet, spicy tomato sauce.|$|E
50|$|In February 1937, they {{produced}} what they claimed {{was the first}} all-electric mobile <b>fish-and-chips</b> saloon. Beneath a serving counter was an oven, which was fitted with two sets of electric elements. One set could be plugged into a mains electrical socket, and was used to bring the oven up to temperature. Once it was hot, the second set were powered from the vehicle's battery, but the amount of current drawn was somewhat lower, as it only had to maintain the temperature. Two months later, they showcased a mobile milk bar, complete with egg-whisking machines, fountains and a refrigerator, again powered from the vehicle battery. A milk tank held 16 to 20 imp gal of milk. Later in the year they held a competition for ideas to improve or develop their products. Prizes of 10, 5 and 3 guineas were offered.|$|E

40|$|Australia now imports more seafood than it exports, {{despite having}} {{the third largest}} marine Economic Exclusion Zone in the world. Seafood imports will rise further after {{approval}} to host 70 % of the globe’s marine parks in the Australian EEZ. This shift is felt personally, viz. our ‘local <b>fish-and-chips</b> shops’ now typically sell frozen imported seafood like freshwater Vietnamese catfish, and quality local fish is unaffordable for ordinary Australians on a regular basis. This creates a paradox whereby families wish to enjoy {{the health benefits of}} seafood but are unsure about the safety of imported seafood. Further, not only are we unable to enjoy quality, safe, fresh Australian product, but we cannot control the production practices and environmental impacts of overseas seafood production. Globally, aquaculture is meeting the demand for seafood now unfilled by wild fisheries, but in Australia aquaculture growth is often constrained by lack of licence approvals (e. g. no new prawn farm licence approvals for ten years). Increasing the efficiency of existing aquaculture industries is one way to increase production of Australian seafood, reduce costs and increase affordability. USC is working with aquaculture companies across Australia to help create more and efficient production by developing new breeds of aquacultured organisms that are suited to captive production. The domestication and genetic improvement of terrestrial species like sheep and wheat commenced thousands of years ago and led to massive gains in productivity, so that today we could not afford to eat eggs produced by wild chickens, or flour milled from wild wheat. The same massive gains are in prospect for aquacultured species– our challenge is making this happen not in 10, 000 years but within decades and for all our diverse aquacultured species. How we are doing this, using both quantitative genetics and molecular genetics, will be the subject of the talk...|$|E

2500|$|A {{prominent}} meal in British culture, {{the dish}} became popular in wider circles in London and South East England {{in the middle}} of the 19th century: Charles Dickens mentions a [...] "fried fish warehouse" [...] in Oliver Twist, first published in 1838, while in the north of England a trade in deep-fried chipped potatoes developed. The first chip shop stood on the present site of Oldham's Tommyfield Market. It remains unclear exactly when and where these two trades combined to become the <b>fish-and-chip</b> shop industry we know. A Jewish immigrant, Joseph Malin, opened the first recorded combined <b>fish-and-chip</b> shop in London in 1860 or in 1865; a Mr Lees pioneered the concept in the North of England, in Mossley, in 1863.|$|R

She {{attended}} Jesus College, Cambridge from 1985 to 1989, reading the Modern and Medieval languages tripos. Theobald’s grandfather, Bertram Jesse Theobald, a tool turner, founded a <b>fish-and-chip</b> business in 1943 in Spring Road, Ipswich after he escaped France {{in one of the}} Dunkirk small boats and was seconded out of the army to make weapons. Theobald has described how Winston Churchill had announced that fish and chips would not rationed and Bertram’s wife, Iris believed there would be money to make from the business. When Theobald’s father, Roy Theobald, came out of National Service in Malaysia in 1960 he joined the family business which now included four shops in the Ipswich area. In 1969, Roy bought a <b>fish-and-chip</b> business in Arwenack Street in Falmouth, Cornwall and the family - his wife Veronica and their three children, Christopher (born 1965) and twins Stephanie and Nicholas - moved there.|$|R

By 1910, there were more than 25,000 fish and chip shops across the country, and in the 1920s there were more than 35,000 shops. According to Professor John Walton, author of Fish and Chips and the British Working Class, the British government made safeguarding supplies of fish and chips during World War I a priority: [...] "The cabinet knew it was vital to keep families on the home front in good heart, unlike the German regime that failed to keep its people well fed". In 1928, Harry Ramsden opened his fish and chip shop in Guiseley, West Yorkshire. On a single day in 1952, the shop served 10,000 portions of fish and chips, earning a place in the Guinness Book Of Records. In George Orwell's The Road to Wigan Pier (1937), documenting his experience of working class life in the north of England, the author considered fish and chips chief among the 'home comforts' which acted as a panacea to the working classes. During World War II, fish and chips remained one of the few foods in the United Kingdom not subject torationing. Prime Minister Winston Churchill referred to the combination of fish and chips as [...] "the good companions".|$|R
