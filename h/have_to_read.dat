25|$|At the hearing, {{the representatives}} from the {{minority}} hit the lack of due process accorded to Gutierrez, and the railroading of the proceedings. To emphasize the point, minority leader Edcel Lagman (Lakas-Kampi, Albay–1st) and Pedro Romualdo (Lakas-Kampi, Camiguin) brought with them a stack of documents two feet high delivered to them the day before, on which they <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> to make an intelligent assessment of the complaints. Representative from Iloilo's 2nd district Augusto Syjuco asked Tupas to inhibit himself as he has a pending case before the ombudsman, but Tupas dismissed his request. Deputy Speaker Raul Daza (Liberal, Northern Samar–1st) remarked that Gutierrez had already been given enough time {{to respond to the}} complaints.|$|E
25|$|A major, but non-technical {{difference}} between Perl 5 and Perl 6 is that Perl 6 {{began as a}} specification. This means that Perl 6 can be re-implemented if needed, and {{it also means that}} programmers don't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> the source code for the ultimate authority on any given feature. Perl 5's documentation is regarded as excellent, even outside of the Perl community where even mixed reviews typically note its maturity and breadth. However, the documentation is not considered authoritative and only describes the behavior of the actual Perl 5 interpreter informally. Any discrepancies found between the documentation and the implementation may lead to either being changed to reflect the other, a dynamic which drives the continuing development and refinement of the Perl 5 releases.|$|E

500|$|As Hughes and Plath were legally {{married at}} the time of her death, Hughes {{inherited}} the Plath estate, including all her written work. Hughes has been condemned repeatedly for burning Plath's last journal, saying he [...] "did not want her children to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> it." [...] He lost another journal and an unfinished novel and instructed that a collection of Plath's papers and journals should not be released until 2013. Hughes has been accused of attempting to control the estate for his own ends, although royalties from Plath's poetry were placed into a trust account for their two children, Frieda and Nicholas.|$|E

Allen described her as [...] "a naturally funny person. When {{she does a}} scene, you listen to her and look at her, and the prism through which it's all filtered is funny." [...] Kavner believes he is [...] "a true filmmaker, one that has something to say, continually experimenting on different themes within his own film-making", adding that [...] "anything [...] ever does, I always want to do, [...] I don't even <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> it." ...|$|E

Fletcher, best known for playing the role of Nurse Ratched in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975), received the Academy Award for Best Actress, the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture, Drama and the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role in recognition of her work. She did not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> for the role of Vedek Winn, nor was she familiar with the Star Trek series or its heritage before accepting the role.

500|$|In Britain {{there was}} {{economic}} prosperity; exports [...] "zoomed", according to The Times, {{and the economy}} was growing {{at an annual rate}} of four per cent. Douglas-Home made no pretence to economic expertise; he commented that his problems were of two sorts: [...] "The political ones are insoluble and the economic ones are incomprehensible." [...] On another occasion he said, [...] "When I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> economic documents I have to have a box of matches and start moving them into position to simplify and illustrate the points to myself." [...] He left Maudling in charge at the Treasury, and promoted Heath to a new business and economic portfolio. The latter took the lead in the one substantial piece of domestic legislation of Douglas-Home's premiership, the abolition of resale price maintenance.|$|E
500|$|During {{the last}} years of his life, Hughes began working on a fuller {{publication}} of Plath's journals. In 1998, shortly before his death, he unsealed the two journals, and passed the project onto his children by Plath, Frieda and Nicholas, who passed it on to Karen V. Kukil. Kukil finished her editing in December 1999, and in 2000 Anchor Books published The Unabridged Journals of Sylvia Plath (Plath 2000). More than half of the new volume contained newly released material; The American author Joyce Carol Oates hailed the publication as a [...] "genuine literary event". Hughes faced criticism for his role in handling the journals: he claims to have destroyed Plath's last journal, which contained entries from the winter of 1962 up to her death. In the foreword of the 1982 version, he writes, [...] "I destroyed [...] because I did not want her children to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> it (in those days I regarded forgetfulness as an essential part of survival)." ...|$|E

Leif thus grew up in Sandvika {{with his mother and}} four siblings. He {{graduated}} from middle school in 1918, with top grades in mathematics. He then embarked on thirty months of professional practice in two local electricity companies, which was a requirement to enrol at Kristiania Technical School, a predecessor of the Faculty of Engineering at Oslo University College. When he enrolled in 1920 he chose technical chemistry instead of electronic engineering. He graduated in 1922, the best chemistry student; a fellow student recalled that he [...] "did not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> anything more than once" [...] in order to remember it. In the spring of 1923, he also took the examen artium after attending the Haagaas School for one year. He was ready to enroll at the Norwegian Institute of Technology, but waited one year, possibly wanting to strengthen his personal finances. In the meantime, he started on his compulsory military service.|$|E

Mr. Burns takes notice of the party's success and decides to promote Homer to [...] "Account Man" [...] for the Springfield Nuclear Plant. Robert Marlow, a {{seasoned}} account veteran, takes Homer under his wing and shows Homer what the high life is like in the corner office. The job changes Homer into a sad individual, who drinks {{in the dark and}} complains about the meaninglessness of his job. When Homer's long hours at the office become the norm and Homer becomes distant from his family, a family vacation with Marge and the children help him realize that family always comes before work. Meanwhile, Lisa introduces Bart to a new literary world which sparks his interest in reading classic novels. In the beginning, Bart struggles with reading and suggests that he should just get a job where he does not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>read.</b> Lisa insists and Bart eventually learns to read properly. When the bullies watches him reading a classic novel at school, they force him to read Little Women to them.|$|E
500|$|The {{liner notes}} for Revelation {{state that the}} album art is [...] "an artistic interpretation" [...] of Salvation Mountain, a {{monument}} created by Leonard Knight as [...] "a public art project designed to send the message that 'God Loves Everyone'". Located in Calipatria, California, the location is entered in the Congressional Record as a 'national treasure'. The album cover is of Salvation Mountain with the song titles of Revelation composed on it, [...] "to send [...] own message of God's love to the world". According to bassist Tai Anderson, the idea to use Salvation Mountain as the album cover art was lead vocalist Mac Powell's idea. Anderson recalled that Third Day received critiques about the album art, with people claiming it ripped off the cover art of Radiohead's album Hail to the Thief (2003). Although he admits there [...] "are similarities" [...] between the two, Anderson denied that the band based the design off of [...] "outside sources". Anderson also said he was {{more concerned with the}} album art's coloring, as [...] "red-skewed" [...] album covers had been used by bands such as U2 and Green Day. In hindsight, Anderson felt that the band [...] "probably would have used one of the other images from the packaging on the cover just so we wouldn't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> the one star critiques on iTunes which never reference the music, just the album cover".|$|E
