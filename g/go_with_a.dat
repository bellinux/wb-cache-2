5|$|While Final Fantasy XIII was in production, the {{development}} of Crystal Tools caused significant problems and delays. The programmers spent much time on taking all demands from staff into account. Based on this feedback, Murata's team tried to adapt the engine {{to the needs of}} several game projects, which proved to be virtually impossible and prevented the engine's specifications from being finalized. Furthermore, as separate groups were working on the individual tools of the engine, there was no comprehensive software documentation to ensure usability and compliance. Unable to wait any longer, the Final Fantasy XIII team {{had no choice but to}} begin creating assets to keep to the game's production schedule. However, the lack of specifications resulted in these assets being incompatible with the engine. In the end, it was decided that Final Fantasy XIII was to be the principal focus of Crystal Tools and the game's team began cooperating with the Research and Development Division more closely to receive the required tools and specifications. While preliminary support of Crystal Tools was developed for the Wii, the console did not fully support all components. In 2008, Murata said that Square Enix might license the engine out to other companies at some point in the future, although the limited documentation and the impracticality of supporting licensees posed great problems in doing so. Two years later, Final Fantasy XIII producer Yoshinori Kitase stated that developing an engine from scratch to <b>go</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> new game may have been a mistake and a likely cause for the long period between the title's announcement and release.|$|E

There he gave what is now known as the Grito de Dolores (Cry, or Shout, of Dolores), calling the people of his parish to leave their homes and join with him in a rebellion against the current government, in the name of their King.|$|E

25|$|This was {{the last}} NFL {{broadcast}} where Musburger and Cross appeared on The NFL Today, which both had been involved with since its 1975 premiere. Shortly before he was to call the 1990 men's Division I college basketball championship game on April 2, 1990, Musburger was fired by CBS management. Cross, meanwhile, was made a color analyst alongside Tim Ryan for two seasons before he left after the 1991 season. In addition, both Butkus and McDonough left the network after this game; McDonough moved to NBC's pregame team while Butkus {{decided to return to}} acting and philanthropic work. CBS elected to <b>go</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> two-man team for the next year, pulling Bradshaw and Greg Gumbel off of their respective broadcast teams and naming them the new hosts for The NFL Today.|$|E
25|$|In the 2016–17 season Fleury played 38 {{games and}} {{accumulated}} 18 wins. When Matt Murray was injured during warm-ups of Game 1 versus the Columbus Blue Jackets, Fleury took {{the starting position}} and led the Penguins to a 3–1 win. Fleury continued to lead the Penguins through the series, and his 49 saves on 51 shots in Game 5 helped the Penguins win the series against the Blue Jackets 4–1. With Murray out, Fleury continued to be the starter for the Penguins through the second round versus the Washington Capitals. The Penguins defeated the Capitals in seven games, with Fleury shutting them out in Game 7, and advanced to face the Ottawa Senators in the Eastern Conference Finals. Following a 5–1 loss in Game 3, the Penguins opted to <b>go</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> healthy Murray, who remained the team's starter {{en route to a}} Stanley Cup championship victory, defeating the Nashville Predators in six games. The win was the third Stanley Cup of Fleury's career.|$|E
25|$|On 31 March, Parma faced Champions League spot-chasing Lazio, {{who had a}} hit a run of bad form. Parma's Cristian Zaccardo {{made his}} 100th {{appearance}} for the club. Parma took the lead early on with the first chance when McDonald Mariga capitalised on Federico Marchetti's goalkeeping error to hit home from nine yards. Sergio Floccari, on loan from Lazio, doubled the lead with an easy header after a Gabriel Paletta miscue. Parma remained on top, but both sides had further chances before Lazio pegged one back before half-time through Lionel Scaloni. Play was briefly suspended midway through the second half after a floodlight failure at the Tardini and Lazio might have equalised soon after the restart. Floccari completed a brace with 18 minutes to <b>go</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> fine volley off Giovinco's free-kick. This put Parma 8 points clear of the relegation zone, although eighteenth-placed Lecce did have a game in hand.|$|E

25|$|On April 14, Buchholz took {{a no-hitter}} {{into the top}} of the eighth inning against the Tampa Bay Rays before {{allowing}} a hit. Buchholz went on to finish the month of April with a 5-0 record, followed by picking up his sixth win in his first start of May. This made his ERA in those six starts 1.01, to <b>go</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> win in every appearance. In April he was named Pitcher of the Month along with Matt Harvey. Buchholz had a 9-0 record until being placed on the disabled list on June 18 due to a neck strain that had been bothering him since June 9, causing him to be out until September 10. Buchholz won 3 of his 4 starts after returning from injury, finishing the regular season with a record of 12-1. In the postseason, Buchholz made 4 starts despite re-aggravating his shoulder injury and won the World Series for the second time of his career when the Red Sox defeated the St. Louis Cardinals in six games.|$|E
25|$|Despite his optimism, O'Neal {{found it}} {{difficult}} to break into the first team the following season. Brian Grant was acquired from free agency and new coach Mike Dunleavy, Sr. planned to use Sabonis, Wallace and Grant as the starting frontcourt, while the presence of veteran Gary Trent also further reduced the sophomore's chances. Thus, O'Neal was not given meaningful minutes {{in the early part of}} the campaign, although he showed glimpses of his potential with occasional double double performances when he returned from an early-season injury. Portland eventually produced a similar win–loss record as the preceding season with 46 wins, finishing fourth in the division. In the playoffs, Dunleavy opted to <b>go</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> more youthful lineup: before the trade deadline, he had acquired point guard Damon Stoudamire, as well as forwards Carlos Rogers and Walt Williams. The move was designed to bolster the team's chances in the playoffs against teams that were bigger and more physical. Nevertheless, for the second time in two years, the Trail Blazers were eliminated by the Lakers in four games in the first round. And just like the season before, O'Neal hardly featured for Portland, playing only three minutes in one game.|$|E

500|$|DOOM's lyrics on Madvillainy are free-associative.
