MOST OF THE CASES CONCERNED CHILDHOOD AND ADOLESCENCE, BELOW 20 YEARS OF AGE (71 %) AND THE DISEASE SHOWED AN INCREASED FREQUENCY TO THE MALES IN RELATION TO FEMALES (4 : 1). THERE WAS A CLEAR SUPERIORITY OF THE SOLITARY EOSINOPHILIC GRANULOMA IN RELATION TO THE MULTIPLE (2, 5 : 1). THE MOST FREQUENT SYMPTOM WAS THE LOCAL PAIN, WHICH WAS OBSERVED IN MOST CASES (32 CASES). IN MANY CASES THE RADIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE WAS NOT CHARACTERISTIC FOR THE DISEASE AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSTIC PROBLEMS WERE CREATED WITH TUMORS OR INFECTIONS OF BONES. THE ONLY LABORATORY FINDING WHICH WAS FREQUENTLY OBSERVED (60 %) WAS THE INCREASE OF THE SEDIMENTATION RATE; ANAEMIA AND LEUCOCYTOSIS WERE RARE AND EOSINOPHILIA IN PERIPHERAL BLOOD WAS FOUND ONLY IN 5 CASES.

30|$|This review {{summarizes}} current {{concepts in}} the diagnosis and management <b>of</b> patients with <b>eosinophilic</b> <b>granuloma,</b> with emphasis {{on the role of}} intralesional methylprednisolone injection for the successful cure of patients with symptomatic lesions. In the past, we planned for observation alone for patients with imaging evidence <b>of</b> <b>eosinophilic</b> <b>granuloma,</b> and curettage for the most painful lesions. It was our initial belief that percutaneous techniques do not provide adequate tissue for definitive diagnosis for mesenchymal tumors [61 – 63]. This belief was based on the agreement among pathologists that mesenchymal tumors are among the most difficult of pathologies to accurately diagnose. We then realized that patients, especially children with symptomatic bone lesions, should not be left alone for the disease to take its natural course without a histological diagnosis. Over the past 15  years, {{we have been able to}} refine the procedures for needle or trocar and frozen sections biopsy to assess the adequacy of the biopsy specimen. Nowadays, we believe that histological diagnosis is necessary for all bone lesions, and recommend that biopsy should not be considered as a strategy for treatment <b>of</b> <b>eosinophilic</b> <b>granuloma</b> but rather as a step to confirm diagnosis. By using CT-guided intralesional methylprednisolone injection, frozen sections histological diagnosis can be obtained in all patients. After biopsy, intralesional injection of methylprednisolone is considered beneficial [31 – 33], or at least not harmful. In our practice, tissue procurement and frozen sections biopsy are usually diagnostic in all patients with suspected <b>eosinophilic</b> <b>granuloma.</b> Even if the definite histological diagnosis is different, intralesional methylprednisolone injection would not have resulted in any adverse effect, but rather it would have decreased intralesional edema and provided pain relief. Our long-term results, (mean follow up, 9  years; range, 4 – 23  years) support biopsy and intralesional methylprednisolone injection as a safe treatment for <b>eosinophilic</b> <b>granulomas</b> <b>of</b> <b>bone</b> with complete resolution of pain and imaging reconstitution of the lesions.|$|R

30|$|Various {{treatment}} options {{have been reported}} for <b>eosinophilic</b> <b>granuloma</b> <b>of</b> <b>bone,</b> including observation and immobilization, indomethacin administration, methylprednisolone injections, radiofrequency ablation, local excision and curettage with or without bone grafting, chemotherapy and irradiation; results have been reported as satisfactory with a recurrence rate of less than 20  % [11, 13, 14, 32 – 34, 43 – 48]. In general, the treatment of typical solitary lesions in asymptomatic patients is conservative [16, 20, 25]. In patients with mild neurological deficits from solitary eosinophilic granulomas of the spine, immobilization and radiation therapy has been reported [48]. Low-dose radiation therapy is advocated by some authors {{to be effective in}} the healing of lytic lesions and limiting disease progression [24]; others argue that radiation therapy may damage endochondral growth plates and limit bone healing and reconstitution [49, 50], or lead to secondary radiation-induced morbidity such as post-radiation sarcomas and myelitis [5, 51]. Although no clear correlation between the degree of vertebral collapse and the degree of neurological symptoms has been observed [25], in patients with severe pain and restriction of range of motion, and/or persistent spinal subluxation and neurological symptoms, surgical treatment is required [12, 13, 15, 19, 20]. Chemotherapy is not recommended for solitary eosinophilic granuloma, and should be reserved for systemic involvement [13, 20, 48], or as initial therapy in children with solitary lesions in locations that preclude safe and complete surgical resection [52].|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY Over a 29 -year period, 43 {{cases of}} {{histiocytosis}} X presented in {{children under the}} age of 12 years. 29 patients (67 %) have survived, and of these, 15 (52 %) have a detectable disability. It was confirmed that young age at presentation and evidence of soft tissue involvement were associated with a worse prognosis. The majority of deaths were associated with pulmonary involvement. 14 patients developed diabetes insipidus. 5 of the surviving adults have heights below the 3 rd centile. Puberty usually occurred at a normal age. Follow-up studies on 12 survivors showed no evidence of residual abnormality of haematology, deficient lymphocyte function, or yeast opsonization. HLA typing showed no unusual pattern. Mild carbon monoxide diffusion defects were present in 4 patients and other abnormalities were detected on lung function tests. Histiocytosis X (Letterer-Siwe disease, Hand-Schiiller-Christian disease, and <b>eosinophilic</b> <b>granuloma</b> <b>of</b> <b>bone)</b> is an uncommon condition in childhood and any one paediatrician is likely to see few cases. A survey in the north-east of England was undertaken to follow-up cases which have presented before the age of 12 years in this area during the years 1947 - 1975 inclusive. The study was done with two objects. Firstly to determine the clinical spectrum of illness and its progression in a group with all degrees of severity, most of them occurring in the years when steroid and cytotoxic therapy was not in use, and secondly to gain some information about the children's development as they grew up, the spectrum of their residual disabil-ities, and what became of them in ybung adult life.

40|$|STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case review <b>of</b> {{children}} with <b>eosinophilic</b> <b>granuloma</b> <b>of</b> the cervical spine. OBJECTIVE: To present the clinical features, radiographic findings, management, and results of 7 pediatric patients with <b>eosinophilic</b> <b>granuloma</b> <b>of</b> the cervical spine. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Management <b>of</b> the <b>eosinophilic</b> <b>granuloma</b> <b>of</b> the pediatric cervical spine is challenging, {{and must be}} adapted according to the patient, as no level I evidences have been produced. The therapeutic goals in these children are spinal stability, preservation of neurologic function, and relief of pain, always {{keeping in mind that}} patients are still growing. The localization in the cervical spine of children is extremely rare, with less than 50 patients reported in literature between 1966 and 2008. METHODS: We reviewed the 7 pediatric patients with a diagnosis <b>of</b> <b>eosinophilic</b> <b>granuloma</b> <b>of</b> the cervical spine who were managed between 1970 and 1990 by the senior author. All patients presented with isolated cervical spine involvement, and all of them had a histologic diagnosis <b>of</b> <b>eosinophilic</b> <b>granuloma</b> (EG). All had open physes. RESULTS: There were 5 boys and 2 girls (mean age: 10 years; range 4 - 16). We followed-up patients for 19 years (range 8 - 29). The symptoms at presentation varied according to the localization of the tumor in the cervical spine. CONCLUSION: Management of pediatric patients with EG of the cervical spine is challenging, especially when there is neurologic involvement. Observation alone, prolonged immobilization, systemic chemotherapy, curettage with or without bone grafting, corticosteroid injection, and low dose radiation therapy have been proposed for the management of patients with EG. Surgery is required when the child presents neurologic involvement. Children who received a vertebral interbody fusion can show, at long period follow-up, normal shape of the neck, with maintenance of the normal motion of the adjacent segments...|$|R

40|$|Solitary <b>eosinophilic</b> <b>granuloma</b> {{is a part}} of the {{spectrum}} of Langerhans cell histiocytoses (LCH) which are rare diseases with varied clinical presentations. They comprise of three major overlapping syndromes: solitary <b>eosinophilic</b> <b>granuloma</b> (unifocal disease), Hand-Schueller-Christian disease (multifocal, unisystem), and Letterer-Siwe disease (multifocal, multisystem). A case <b>of</b> solitary <b>eosinophilic</b> <b>granuloma</b> <b>of</b> the ulna is presented here for its relatively uncommon incidence and the difficulty in making an accurate diagnosis based on the radiological picture alone. We hereby, emphasize the importance of a quick and reliable diagnosis based on fine needle aspiration cytology, and the need to consider the possibility of LCH in the differential diagnoses of a slide showing a large number of histiocytes and eosinophils, as in tuberculosis, Hodgkin&#x 2032;s disease, and other primary and metastatic bony lesions. Characteristic nuclear grooves and a large number of eosinophils help in clinching the cytological diagnosis...|$|R
30|$|The typical {{radiographic}} appearance <b>of</b> <b>eosinophilic</b> <b>granuloma</b> <b>of</b> the extremities is a punched-out lytic-bone lesion without reactive sclerosis. In most cases, a hypervascularized soft-tissue mass {{surrounds the}} affected bone [26, 27]. The radiographic differential diagnosis should include plasmacytoma, multiple myeloma, osteochondritis, tuberculosis or osteomyelitis. In the spine, imaging studies may reveal variable vertebral involvement, ranging from isolated lytic lesions {{to a more}} significant vertebral collapse that involves the pedicles and posterior vertebral elements (vertebra plana), peridural spread and paraspinal soft tissue components [20, 25]. Although <b>eosinophilic</b> <b>granuloma</b> {{is the most common}} cause of vertebra plana, this finding can also be found in Ewing’s sarcoma, lymphoma and other sarcomas, infections such as tuberculosis, and osteogenesis imperfect [28, 29]. In favor <b>of</b> the <b>eosinophilic</b> <b>granuloma</b> are the isolated spinal disease, the lack of constitutional symptoms, and minimal laboratory abnormalities [28]. Cervical spine <b>eosinophilic</b> <b>granuloma</b> more often manifests with osteolytic lesions, rather than vertebra plana [18, 20, 25, 30].|$|R
40|$|We {{report a}} case of a 2 -year-old child {{presenting}} with right forearm pain. Based on imaging analysis, the initial diagnosis was osteomyelitis but the final diagnosis demonstrated by histology was <b>Eosinophilic</b> <b>Granuloma</b> (EG) <b>of</b> the forearm. We detail the rare radiological presentation of such a lesion, the various clinical presentations and the work-up advised in this context. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} {{treatment}} of 72 patients with pathological fracture of vertebra bodies against <b>eosinophilic</b> <b>granuloma</b> a spine are analysed. Orthopedic corset technologies {{are used in}} treatment of 42 patients, surgical treatment was applied. Orthopedic corset {{may be used in}} patients with <b>eosinophilic</b> <b>granuloma</b> <b>of</b> backbone. This method of treatment was used in a case of the absence of spine secondary deformations and neurologic semiology. Orthopedic corset treatment is associated with long immobilization on the average within 1, 5 - 2 years and never leads to a complete recovery of the damaged spine. Surgical treatment consists in use only at loss of height of a body to 30 - 40 %, when destruction of spine more severe it is necessary to use operative treatment in two stages. Absolute indications to surgical treatment are the neurologic deficit and secondary deformations of a spine. Surgical treatment allows to reduce terms of treatment till 3 - 4 months and quickly to return the patient to an active life. </span...|$|R
