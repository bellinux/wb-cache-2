Psychologically this is surprising. The earlier Wittgenstein, whom I knew intimately, was a man addicted to passionately intense thinking, profoundly aware of difficult problems of which <b>I,</b> <b>like</b> <b>him,</b> felt the importance, and possessed (or at least so I thought) of true philosophical genius. The later Wittgenstein, on the contrary, seems to have grown tired of serious thinking and to have invented a doctrine which would make such an activity unnecessary. I do not for one moment believe that the doctrine which has these lazy consequences is true. I realize, however, that I have an overpoweringly strong bias against it, for, if it is true, philosophy is, at best, a slight help to lexicographers, and at worst, an idle tea-table amusement.Ernest Gellner wrote the book Words and Things, in which he was fiercely critical of the work of Ludwig Wittgenstein, J. L. Austin, Gilbert Ryle, Antony Flew, P. F. Strawson and many others. Ryle refused to have the book reviewed in the philosophical journal Mind (which he edited), and Bertrand Russell (who had written an approving foreword) protested in a letter to The Times. A response from Ryle and a lengthy correspondence ensued.|$|E
500|$|In 2007, Gene Wilder said {{he chose}} not to see the film. [...] "The thing that put me off ... I like Johnny Depp, <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>him,</b> as an actor <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>him</b> very much ... but when I saw little pieces in the {{promotion}} of what he was doing, I said I don't want to see the film, because I don't want to be disappointed in him." [...] In 2013, when Wilder was asked about the Burton remake, he said [...] "I think it's an insult. It's probably Warner Bros.' insult." [...] He also criticized the choices that Burton made as a director, saying [...] "I don't care for that director. He's a talented man, but I don't care for him doing stuff like he did." ...|$|E
500|$|Jonathan Meades ate at The Restaurant for The Times in late 1993, {{and noted}} the {{evolution}} of some dishes and sauces from White's days at Harveys. These included making the pig's trotter dish more [...] "delicate", and only using the white part of the leeks in a pressed leek and langoustine starter. Meades also noticed that White had [...] "tempered" [...] the sauces served with meat and fish, referring to their previous versions as [...] "assault courses". He praised a new roasted salmon and tapenade dish, calling it [...] "of breathtaking quality", {{and the work of}} pastry chef Roger Pizey. Meades later listed The Restaurant as the second best in the country at the end of 1994, placed only behind Phil Vickery, having recently taken over from Gary Rhodes, at the Castle Hotel, Taunton. He gave both restaurants an equal nine stars out of ten. When celebrity chef Keith Floyd listed his five favourite restaurants for The Guardian in September 1994, he included The Restaurant in third place, saying [...] "The food is exquisite. He's a difficult bastard, but <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>him.</b> He came through le Gavroche, through Albert Roux, and he's developed on from there. Along with Albert, I think he's one of the finest cooks in the country. Last time, I had a bean and langoustine soup which was sensational, outstanding." ...|$|E

2500|$|Glover {{returned}} to the re-christened Tampa Bay Rays for [...] but was bedeviled by tendinitis in his shoulder and an injury to his left calf. On July 29, the Rays designated Glover for assignment. Manager Joe Maddon expressed regret: [...] "There's just no room in the inn right now...There's no real complicated explanation. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>him</b> and he fits in well here." [...] On August 2, the Rays released Glover.|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, Goldsmith {{joined the}} Conservative Party, stating that he {{regarded}} its main rival, the Labour Party, as [...] "the party of big business". After the Conservatives lost the 2005 general election to Labour, they elected David Cameron as their new leader. Goldsmith thought highly of Cameron, expressing {{the view that}} while he was generally [...] "cynical about politicians", he felt that Cameron was different. Describing Cameron, he said [...] "I don't know David Cameron very well... <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>him.</b> I think you can judge a book by its cover... I think the cover is pretty good." ...|$|E
2500|$|Edson left Charleston for New York in 1927 in {{an attempt}} to revive his career, but his recent {{publishing}} failure and long absence from the city undermined his efforts. Times were changing as well, and his style of writing was losing its appeal. He earned some money by ghostwriting the story of prize fighter Abe the Newsboy. The Life Story of Abe the Newsboy was published in 1930 and still in print in 1960, but Edson received no royalties. By the end of his final stay in New York, Edson was destitute. Robert Marks reported to a mutual acquaintance: “I feel sorry as hell for old Edson. I’ve seen him fairly often, and while <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>him</b> a lot I think he’s pretty hopeless. He is neither fish, flesh, fowl, nor good red herring. He has made enemies of everyone, has no practical sense, and little social poise.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come, Miss Thorn," [...] I said severely, [...] "this is ridiculous. <b>I</b> don't <b>like</b> <b>him,</b> {{and never}} shall. <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>him</b> once, {{before he took}} to writing drivel. But {{he must have been}} made over since then. And what is more, with all respect to your opinion, I don't believe he likes me." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'O Mrs. Jethway, you {{do think}} so mistakenly! <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>him</b> best--that's why <b>I</b> {{wanted him to}} do it. He was gentle and nice--I always thought <b>him</b> so--and <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> him.' ...|$|R
2500|$|During the {{takeover}} procedures, Sir Martin Sorrell, {{the founder of}} WPP, who already had a tarnished reputation in the advertising industry following a similar successful takeover of J. Walter Thompson, was described by Ogilvy as an [...] "odious little shit", and he promised to never work again. (Reports softened it to [...] "odious little jerk", and when Martin Sorrell signed his next company report, he followed the signature with the letters OLJ.) Two events followed simultaneously, however: WPP became the largest marketing communications firm in the world, and David Ogilvy was named the company's non-executive chairman (a position he held for three years). Eventually he became a fan of Sorrell. A letter of apology from Ogilvy adorns Sorrell's office, which {{is said to be}} the only apology David Ogilvy ever offered in any form during his adult life. Only a year after his derogatory comments about Sorrell, he was quoted as saying, 'When he tried to take over our company, I would liked to have killed him. But it was not legal. I wish I had known him 40 years ago. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>him</b> enormously now.' ...|$|E
2500|$|In a July 2012 {{edition of}} Sports Illustrated, Jackson talked about several issues, and also was {{critical}} of the Baseball Writers' Association of America as he believes they have lowered their standards when voting for prospects in the Hall of Fame. He has also been critical of players associated with performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs), including distant cousin Barry Bonds, stating [...] "I believe that Hank Aaron is the home run king, not Barry Bonds, as great of a player Bonds was." [...] Of Alex Rodriguez, whom Jackson has worked alongside as {{special assistant to the}} Yankees, Jackson remarked, [...] "Al's a very good friend. But I think there are real questions about his numbers. As much as <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>him,</b> what he admitted about his usage does cloud some of his numbers." [...] On July 12, the Yankees released a statement from Jackson after the Sports Illustrated interview had been released. The press release included Jackson saying, [...] "In trying to convey my feelings about a few issues that I am passionate about, I made the mistake of naming some specific players." [...] It had been reported [...] he had been told by the Yankees to steer clear from the team, although general manager Brian Cashman stated he had not been banned but only told to not join the club on a road trip to Boston and would later be free to interact with the club. After the SI article became known and Jackson's status with the Yankees being talked about, Jackson confirmed in his statement [...] "I continue to have a strong relationship with the club, and look forward to continuing my role with the team." ...|$|E
2500|$|In October 1944, Wittgenstein {{returned}} to Cambridge {{around the same}} time as Russell who had been living in America for several years. Russell {{returned to}} Cambridge after a backlash in America to his writings on morals and religion. Wittgenstein said of Russell's works to Drury;Russell’s books should be bound in two colours…those dealing with mathematical logic in red – and all students of philosophy should read them; those dealing with ethics and politics in blue – and no one should be allowed to read them.Russell made similar disparaging comments about Wittgenstein's later work;I have not found in Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations anything that seemed to me interesting and I do not understand why a whole school finds important wisdom in its pages. Psychologically this is surprising. The earlier Wittgenstein, whom I knew intimately, was a man addicted to passionately intense thinking, profoundly aware of difficult problems of which <b>I,</b> <b>like</b> <b>him,</b> felt the importance, and possessed (or at least so I thought) of true philosophical genius. The later Wittgenstein, on the contrary, seems to have grown tired of serious thinking and to have invented a doctrine which would make such an activity unnecessary. I do not for one moment believe that the doctrine which has these lazy consequences is true. I realize, however, that I have an overpoweringly strong bias against it, for, if it is true, philosophy is, at best, a slight help to lexicographers, and at worst, an idle tea-table amusement.In the summer of 1946, Wittgenstein thought often of leaving Cambridge and resigning his position as Chair. Wittgenstein grew further dismayed at the state of philosophy, particularly about articles published in the journal Mind. It was around this time that Wittgenstein fell in love with Ben Richards writing in his diary, [...] "The only thing that my love for B. has done for me is this: it has driven the other small worries associated with my position and my work into the background." [...] On the 30th of September, Wittgenstein wrote about Cambridge after his return from Swansea, [...] "Everything about the place repels me. The stiffness, the artificiality, the self-satisfaction of the people. The university atmosphere nauseates me." ...|$|E
