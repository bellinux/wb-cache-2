500|$|A new TARDIS prop was used, {{featuring}} the St John Ambulance logo {{that had been}} used {{in the early days of}} the show as well as in the Peter Cushing films of the early 60s, of which Moffat was a fan. Moffat said <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> he [...] "really wanted to do" [...] and it was for [...] "no other reason than that [...] thought it was prettier" [...] and he wanted the St. John Ambulance sticker on the front. It is also a brighter blue like Cushing's TARDIS.|$|E
2500|$|To permit Lee's suit, Gray argued, {{would open}} the United States to a {{multitude}} of suits over title to land it held. The cases cited by the majority (such as United States v. Peters, Osborn v. Bank of United States, Meigs v. M'Clung, and Davis v. Gray) were improperly cited, Gray argued, as in each case [...] "either the money was in the personal possession of the defendants {{and not in the}} possession of the State, or the suit was to restrain the defendants by injunction from doing acts in violation of the Constitution of the United States." [...] <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> for the Court to eject or dispossess officers or agents of the United States from land or funds; such actions, Gray concluded, continued to immunize the United States government from suits. Carr v. United States reaffirmed this principle, he concluded. To blur the distinction between officer and state or to assume or imply it without the state's consent, as the majority does, Gray said, would leave the sovereign immunity right in shambles.|$|E
2500|$|Flavius Josephus in Jewish Antiquities , chapter 2 {{recorded}} {{the story of}} King Izates of Adiabene who decided to follow the Law of Moses at {{the advice of a}} Jewish merchant named Ananias. He was going to get circumcised, but his mother, Helen, who herself embraced the Jewish customs, advised against it {{on the grounds that the}} subjects would not stand to be ruled by someone who followed such [...] "strange and foreign rites". Ananias likewise advised against it, on the grounds that worship of God was superior to circumcision (Robert Eisenman in James the Brother of Jesus claims that Ananias is Paul of Tarsus who held similar views) and that God would forgive him for fear of his subjects. So Izates decided against it. However, later, [...] "a certain other Jew that came out of Galilee, whose name was Eleazar", who was well versed in the Law, convinced him that he should, on the grounds that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> to read the Law and another thing to practice it, and so he did. Once Helen and Ananias found out, they were struck by great fear of the possible consequences, but as Josephus put it, God looked after Izates. As his reign was peaceful and blessed, Helen visited the Jerusalem Temple to thank God, and since there was a terrible famine at the time, she brought lots of food and aid to the people of Jerusalem.|$|E

60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> for Sergeant Corney to {{say that}} we must sleep, and quite another for us to obey the command.|$|E
60|$|But {{they found}} that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> to tell this well-dressed young man that he was under arrest, but quite another to enforce it.|$|E
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> to call {{ourselves}} Minute Boys; {{to write}} to Governor Henry and to be praised by him, and quite another matter {{to be able to}} do anything whatsoever in aid of the Cause.|$|E
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> {{to chase}} a horse; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> {{another thing to}} catch it. Little {{consideration}} and less sagacity is required to convince us of the truth of that fact.|$|R
6000|$|... “Because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> to {{stop them}} {{on the high seas}} and another {{to stop them}} in United States waters. Remember, Porto Rico is now a part of Uncle Sam’s domain.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The thing is, I must simplify my life. I shall {{do nothing}} unless I simplify my life. Only {{people who are}} well off can be--complex. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> or the other--" ...|$|R
60|$|There is {{no denying}} the fact that Dave was startled. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> to have Roger missing, it was quite another to have his chum gone and have the berth made up {{as if it had}} never been occupied.|$|E
60|$|Darkness was {{now coming}} on, {{and the boys}} wished {{themselves}} safe at the ranch. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> to ride through the timber in the daylight; it was quite another to do so at night, and especially when the wild animals were on the move.|$|E
6000|$|... "Under the sea!" [...] ejaculated Helen. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> to {{have read}} {{of such a}} strange fact, but a vastly {{different}} one to realize it here among these lofty peaks. Dale was always showing her something or telling her something that astounded her.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know, Hawkins. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> {{to attack}} {{her when she}} has Miss Greendale on board, but if she has gone ashore <b>it</b> would <b>be</b> very like an act of piracy." ...|$|R
60|$|Fifth. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing,</b> therefore, {{to suffer}} for sin by {{the stroke of}} eternal justice, and another thing to abide for ever a {{sufferer}} there: Christ did the first, the damned do the second.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, you behaved very well, Charlie; but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> to <b>be</b> {{standing}} {{on the top of}} a keep and another to be in the streets when a fray is going on all round." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{longer he}} thought, the meaner his action in calling Farmer Brown's boy looked. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> {{to try to}} steal those eggs himself, but it was quite another matter {{to try to have}} them stolen by some one against whom Hooty had no {{protection}} whatever.|$|E
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> {{to fight}} against the Indians in the forest where we could find as good shelter as they, and quite another to advance in the open against a {{garrison}} of men equally skilful with ourselves in handling a rifle, and protected by a stockade.|$|E
6000|$|But {{she could}} not. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> {{to put up}} with embraces, quite another to pretend that.

6000|$|... "Of {{course we}} know Jack and Fred are innocent," [...] remarked Randy to his brother. [...] "But {{in a court}} of law <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> to know <b>it</b> and quite another thing to prove it." ...|$|R
6000|$|Osborn knitted his brows. [...] "I {{imagined}} that <b>was</b> done with. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> {{to take his}} help and another to give him Grace. After all, {{there is not much}} difference between his plan and Thorn's." ...|$|R
60|$|CHR. Yea, {{that is a}} {{good heart}} that hath good thoughts, and {{that is a good}} life that is {{according}} to God's commandments; but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing,</b> indeed, to have these, and another thing only to think so.|$|R
6000|$|... "And then, when Harrison at last returned, I {{learned that}} my son was {{actually}} matched to fight in a public prize-battle. That would not do, Charles! <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> to fight as you and I have fought in our youth, and it was another to compete for a purse of gold." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{remained}} gloomily silent. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> {{to avail}} myself {{of the society}} of a very popular little maitre d'hotel, holiday making in his own capital, and quite another to take him even a few steps into my confidence. So I said nothing, but my eyes, which travelled around the room, were weary.|$|E
6000|$|So she {{was delighted}} {{when she heard}} this, almost as much delighted as she was afraid that he might fail in the most {{difficult}} adventure. For <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> to egg on a Remora to kill a Firedrake, and quite another to find the princes if they were alive, and restore them if they were dead! ...|$|E
60|$|With {{the third}} {{proposition}} I am quite disposed to agree, though <b>it</b> must <b>be</b> recollected that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> {{to allow that}} a given migration is possible, and another to admit {{there is good reason}} to believe it has really taken place.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh!--Driftwood!" [...] {{said the}} young man from Oxford, very bitterly, with a fling of all his limbs. [...] "The middle way <b>is</b> nothingness. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> or the other. Eat or destroy. Eat or destroy! What else is there to do?" ...|$|R
60|$|Short as <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> this sufficed Mary. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> for a {{young lady}} to make prudent, heart-breaking suggestions, but quite another to have them accepted. She did call him dearest Frank, even on that one day, almost {{as often as he}} had desired her.|$|R
60|$|It must be {{confessed that}} Dick's heart beat loudly {{as he took}} his seat in the flying machine. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> to talk about going up and quite another to really fly. He {{realized}} the danger far more than did merry-hearted Tom, or even Sam. But {{he was not going}} to show the white feather.|$|E
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> {{to talk of}} {{sweeping}} the Prussians before them, quite another to take {{a part in the}} performance. Still the steady drilling that went on had its effect. If the National Guard did not learn discipline they at least gained the power to make a respectable appearance and to go through simple manoeuvres fairly.|$|E
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing,</b> and I {{grant you}} an {{important}} one, {{to enter the}} town without giving rise to suspicions; but quite another and more serious to take from the quarters of the British army horses which would be guarded by soldiers, {{and get away with}} them through the lines of sentinels out over the entrenchments.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{were about}} to ask," [...] he said, [...] "how I {{obtained}} my entry here. Monsieur, one had better not ask. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> to <b>be</b> a thief. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> quite another to see something of the wonderful life which those live who are at war with society." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know that}} I {{ought to have}} paused a moment, and given him another stab, but I could not bring myself to do <b>it.</b> <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> to stab {{a man who is}} trying to take <b>one's</b> life, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> quite another when he has fallen, and is helpless." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{agree with}} you altogether, Alwyn," [...] Oswald, who had not heard the talk between Grey and Talbot, {{concerning}} Glendower's daughters, replied heartily. [...] "I would have gladly saved the men who <b>were</b> killed today. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> to slay in battle, but to slaughter unresisting men goes altogether against my grain." ...|$|R
