500|$|Russell, {{a fan of}} English indie pop band The xx, {{proposed}} the idea of remixing I'm New Here to the band's percussionist and producer Jamie xx. Russell's production on I'm New Here was heavily influenced by the xx's self-titled debut album, which showcased Jamie xx's bassy, beat-oriented and minimalist production.

2500|$|In addition, {{since the}} band {{had not yet}} signed their deal with Atlantic Records, Page and Zeppelin's manager Peter Grant paid for the {{sessions}} entirely themselves, meaning there was no record company money to waste on excessive studio time. In another interview, Page revealed that the self-funding was to ensure artistic freedom: [...] "I wanted artistic control in a vise grip, because <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> what I {{wanted to do with}} these fellows. In fact, I financed and completely recorded the first album before going to Atlantic ... It wasn't your typical story where you get an advance to make an album – we arrived at Atlantic with tapes in hand ...
