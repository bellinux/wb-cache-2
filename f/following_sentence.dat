2500|$|On March 16, 2011, Kurtis W. Hanna and Ed Engelmann {{petitioned the}} Minnesota Board of Pharmacy to {{initiate}} rule making to remove Cannabis {{from the list}} of Schedule I substance in Minnesota's version of the Uniform Controlled Substances Act. The Board was informed when they denied the petition at their meeting on May 11, 2011 by Kurtis Hanna that he planned on filing for judicial review of the agency's decision. In response, the Board voted to petition the State Legislature to remove the Board's authority to remove substances from Schedule I. At a Conference Committee for Omnibus Drug Bill HF57 on May 18, 2011, the <b>following</b> <b>sentence</b> was added to the bill, [...] "The Board of Pharmacy may not delete or reschedule a drug that is in Schedule I" [...] and the <b>following</b> <b>sentence</b> of statute was deleted, [...] "the state Board of Pharmacy [...] shall annually, on or before May 1 of each year, conduct a review of the placement of controlled substances in the various schedules." [...] The bill was signed into law by Governor Dayton on May 24, 2011. Kurtis Hanna never filed a lawsuit against the Board of Pharmacy due to the belief that it would be moot.|$|E

2500|$|Cherubim are {{discussed}} within the midrash literature. The two cherubim placed by God {{at the entrance}} of paradise (Gen. iii. 24) were angels created on the third day, and therefore they had no definite shape; appearing either as men or women, or as spirits or angelic beings (Genesis Rabbah xxi., end). The cherubim were the first objects created in the universe (Tanna debe Eliyahu R., i. beginning). The <b>following</b> <b>sentence</b> of the Midrash is characteristic: [...] "When a man sleeps, the body tells to the neshamah (soul) what it has done during the day; the neshamah then reports it to the nefesh (spirit), the nefesh to the angel, the angel to the cherub, and the cherub to the seraph, who then brings it before God" [...] (Leviticus Rabbah xxii.; Eccl.

2500|$|Some {{critics of}} the {{decision}} argue that the majority seemed to seek refuge from their own logic in the <b>following</b> <b>sentence</b> in the majority opinion: [...] "Our consideration {{is limited to the}} present circumstances, for the problem of equal protection in election processes generally presents many complexities." [...] The Court's defenders argued that this was a reasonable precaution against the possibility that the decision might be read over-broadly, arguing that in the short time available it would not be appropriate to attempt to craft language spelling out in greater detail how to apply the holding to other cases. Critics, however, interpreted the sentence as stating that the case did not set precedent in any way and could not be used to justify any future court decision, and some suggested that this was evidence the majority realized its holding was untenable. [...] Regardless of whether the majority intended the decision to be precedential, it has been cited by several federal courts in election cases.|$|E
2500|$|Old Dutch {{branched}} {{off more}} or less {{around the same time}} as Old English (Anglo-Saxon), Old High German, Old Frisian and Old Saxon did. The early form of Dutch was a set of Franconian dialects spoken by the Salian Franks in the fifth century, and thus, it has developed through Middle Dutch to Modern Dutch over the course of 15 centuries. During that period, it forced Old Frisian back from the western coast {{to the north of the}} Low Countries, and influenced or even replaced Old Saxon spoken in the east (contiguous with the Low German area). On the other hand, Dutch has been replaced in adjacent lands in nowadays France and Germany. The division in Old, Middle and Modern Dutch is mostly conventional, since the transition between them was very gradual. One of the few moments linguists can detect somewhat of a revolution is when the Dutch standard language emerged and quickly established itself. The development of the Dutch language is illustrated by the <b>following</b> <b>sentence</b> in Old, Middle and Modern Dutch: ...|$|E

2500|$|The colours {{allocated}} to the various fields of learning have been largely standardized in the United States by the Intercollegiate Bureau of Academic Costume, and accepted by the American Council on Education in its Academic Costume Code. [...] Some of the more common colours seen are that liberal arts is represented by white, science by golden yellow, medicine by green, law by purple, theology by scarlet, and philosophy (including all PhD degrees) by dark blue. [...] A distinction {{is made in the}} code, which calls for a graduate to display the colour of the subject of the degree obtained, not the degree itself. For example, if a graduate is awarded a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree specifically in business the trimming should be drab, representing commerce/accountancy/business, rather than white, representing the broader arts/letters/humanities; the same method is true of master's degrees and doctorates. [...] However, in 1986, the American Council on Education updated the Code and added the <b>following</b> <b>sentence</b> clarifying the use of the colour dark blue for the Doctor of Philosophy degree, which is awarded in any number of fields: [...] "In the case of the Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree, the dark blue colour is used to represent the mastery of the discipline of learning and scholarship in any field that is attested to by the awarding of the degree, and it is not intended to represent the field of philosophy." ...|$|E
