40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the present}} role {{and use of}} the traditional transportation measurement, namely the (<b>freight)</b> <b>tonne-kilometre.</b> It is argued that this measurement has some limitations to assess properly the real transportation work, and not to characterise the importance of transport modes. Other measurement methods should have to taken into consideration. Monetarisation of transport services or derivative measurement could be the key to properly characterise differentiated freight transport activities and support decision making on both macro- and microeconomic level...|$|E
2500|$|Emirates SkyCargo (...) is a cargo airline {{based in}} Dubai, United Arab Emirates. As of 2014, {{it is the}} second largest cargo airline {{worldwide}} in terms of the total <b>freight</b> <b>tonne-kilometres</b> flown and the largest in terms of international <b>freight</b> <b>tonne-kilometres</b> flown.|$|R
25|$|The airline was the seventh-largest airline in {{the world}} in terms of {{international}} passengers carried, and the largest {{in the world}} in terms of scheduled international passenger-kilometers flown. It is also the seventh-largest in terms of scheduled <b>freight</b> <b>tonne-kilometres</b> flown (sixth in scheduled international <b>freight</b> <b>tonne-kilometres</b> flown).|$|R

50|$|British Airways World Cargo {{formerly}} British Airways Cargo was {{a division}} of IAG Cargo, operating air cargo services under the British Airways brand. It was the twelfth-largest cargo airline {{in the world by}} total <b>freight</b> <b>tonne-kilometres</b> flown. <b>Freight</b> services were provided using the main British Airways fleet, as well as dedicated freighter aircraft operating under a wet lease agreement with Global Supply Systems.|$|R
5|$|British Airways {{provides}} cargo services {{under the}} British Airways World Cargo brand. The division {{has been part}} of IAG Cargo since 2012, and is the world's twelfth-largest cargo airline based on total <b>freight</b> <b>tonne-kilometres</b> flown. BA World Cargo operates using the main BA fleet. Until the end of March 2014 they also operated three Boeing 747-8 freighter aircraft providing dedicated long-haul services under a wet lease arrangement from Global Supply Systems. The division operates an automated cargo centre at London Heathrow Airport and handles freight at Gatwick and Stansted airports.|$|R
50|$|The {{resumption}} of US-based flying featured {{a series of}} charters from New York to Miami, Las Vegas, Los Angeles and Mexico City as well as entry of the US cargo charter market for the first time. However, startup costs associated with these flights (in addition to significant restructuring costs) meant that Modern Air remained unprofitable in 1973, when it recorded a $1.86 million operating loss and a $3.22 million net loss, respectively, despite total revenues reaching an all-time high of $25.06 million, increasing {{the total number of}} passengers carried to more than 490,000 and flying 13,000 <b>freight</b> <b>tonne-kilometres</b> (FTKs).|$|R
40|$|Air freight has, until recently, {{received}} little {{coverage in the}} climate change debate as the air passenger market has been targeted by media and environmentalists. Phenomenal growth rates contributed to a 140 % increase in air freight between 1992 and 2002, with growth in world <b>freight</b> <b>tonne-kilometres</b> outstripping growth in world GDP. Forecasts predict a 4 % and 6 % growth in the tonne kilometres performed for 2007 and 2008. A considerable share of this growth {{has been attributed to}} a modal shift from sea transport to air. In particular, the express air freight market is likely to experience significant growth through integrators like DHL or FedEx...|$|R
50|$|Lufthansa Cargo {{was created}} as a limited stock company on 30 November 2004, along with Lufthansa Cargo Charter. Lufthansa Cargo uses LH (the same IATA code as Lufthansa), as well as GEC (the former ICAO code of German Cargo) as airline codes. Lufthansa is unique {{compared}} to its major European competitors like British Airways and Air France in that the cargo business is organized {{in an entirely different}} airline entity. For some years, Lufthansa Cargo (including the freight transported in the cargo holds of mainline Lufthansa passenger aircraft) was the leading cargo airline in terms of international <b>freight</b> <b>tonne-kilometres</b> carried, but has since been surpassed by Cathay Pacific and Korean Air Cargo.|$|R
40|$|Monitoring company {{emissions}} from freight transport is essential if future greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions {{are to be}} realised. Modern economies are characterised increasingly by lower density freight movements. However, weight-based measures of <b>freight</b> transport activity (<b>tonne-kilometre,</b> tonnes lifted) are not good at describing volume-limited freight. After introducing the need for performance measurement, the problem of benchmarking is outlined in more detail. A context-dependent undesirable output data envelopment analysis (DEA) model, designed {{to be sensitive to}} business context, is then tested on a simulated set of fleet profiles. DEA can produce more consistent measures of good-practice, compared to ratio-based key performance indicators (KPI), providing emission reduction targets for companies and an aggregate reporting tool...|$|R
