50|$|Adipic acid or <b>hexanedioic</b> <b>acid</b> is {{the organic}} {{compound}} with the formula (CH2)4(COOH)2. From an industrial perspective, {{it is the}} most important dicarboxylic acid: About 2.5 billion kilograms of this white crystalline powder are produced annually, mainly as a precursor for the production of nylon. Adipic acid otherwise rarely occurs in nature.|$|E
50|$|The {{propionic acid}} {{produced}} in the second step is metabolized so rapidly that a local lowering of the pH value does occur. Therefore, to accelerate polymer degradation acidic additives must be added (such as octanedioic acid, <b>hexanedioic</b> <b>acid</b> or 2-methylidenebutanedioic acid). Zero-order release kinetics were achieved when embedding the cytostatic agent 5-fluorouracil.

30|$|The {{results of}} the Gas Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry {{analysis}} of products released by the off-line pyrolysis of initial bio-film strips (Fig.  6) were fully consistent with the structural information derived from solid-state NMR spectra. The mass spectra associated with the two intense peaks, eluting at 10.1 and 17.2  min, {{were assigned to the}} methylated forms of <b>hexanedioic</b> <b>acid</b> and 1, 4 benzendicarboxylic acid, respectively, while the intermediate lower peaks at about 13.6  min of retention time were related to the methyl ether derivatives of oligosaccharide molecules (Fig.  6). With respect to the basic components identified in NMR spectra, the strong basic condition conveyed by the TMAH reagent may have promoted the solvolysis and the oxidation of the terminal hydroxyl groups of short chain aliphatic ester linkages, with the formation of the C 6 alkyl dioic homologues.|$|E

A monoclinic polymorph has been reported previously, most recently by Ranganathan, Kulkarni & Rao [J. Phys. Chem. A, (2003), 107, 6073 – 6081]. The molecules adopt the expected zigzag structure and are linked via centrosymmetric pairs of O—H O hydrogen bonds, forming infinite one-dimensional chains along [011]. These chains are stacked along the a axis. The crystal is further stabilized by weak C—H O inter-actions. Related literature For bond-length data, see Allen et al. (1987).

40|$|The {{atmospheric}} {{concentrations of}} 47 carboxylic acids in the semivolatile and particle phases are quantified in the Los Angeles area, {{as part of}} a larger study of the vapor-phase, semivolatile, and particle-phase organic compounds. Variations in the spatial and temporal distributions of acid concentrations are analyzed to determine whether atmospheric formation or primary emissions are responsible for the observed levels. Relatively low molecular weight aliphatic dicarboxylic acids (e. g., butanedioic acid, <b>hexanedioic</b> <b>acid,</b> and propanedioic acid) and some n-alkanoic acids (e. g., n-octanoic acid and n-nonanoic acid) are found at an offshore sampling location at levels comparable to urban area concentrations indicating that these compounds or their atmospheric precursors may be derived from long-range transport or natural background sources. Some aromatic carboxylic acids (e. g., benzoic acid and 1, 2 -benzenedicarboxylic acid) have spatial and temporal distributions suggesting that formation from anthropogenic emissions of gaseous precursors dominates their atmospheric concentrations. Additionally, the distributions of aliphatic carboxylic acid concentrations known to be emitted from primary sources (e. g., hexadecanoic acid and octadecanoic acid) are consistent with direct emissions as the dominant source of these compounds...|$|E

Infested {{plants by}} herbivores will produce volatiles as indirect defense mechanism that attracts natural enemies of herbivores. Analysis of volatiles compounds produced by rice plant as result of infested brown plant hopper (BPH), Nilaparvata lugens Stâl, {{was done to}} identify compounds in the volatiles that potentially {{can be used as}} attractant for egg parasitoids of BPH, Anagrus nilaparvatae (Pang et Wang) (Hymenoptera: Mymaridae). This research was an early stage to develop formulation of parasitoid attractant. The research activities include volatiles extraction of infested rice stem by BPH eggs using acetone, n-hexane as the extraction solvents; analyses of volatile compounds with GC-MS; and bioassay of parasitoid orientation behavior to the volatiles using olfactometer methods. Extraction methods applied were maceration and continuous extraction followed by concentration. Bioassay on the parasitoid orientation behavior was done by using Y-tube olfactometer and every lot of bioassay using 30 parasitoid females with 3 replicates. The results showed that the volatile compounds of extract of infested rice stem by BPH eggs comprise of 16 components.

40|$|Abstract. The {{identification}} of new contaminants {{is critical in}} the development of new medicinal products. Many impurities, such as pentanedioic acid, <b>hexanedioic</b> <b>acid,</b> heptanedioic acid, octanedioic acid, decanedioic acid, undecanedioic acid, dodecanedioic acid, tridecanedioic acid, and tetradecanedioic acid, have been identified in samples of azelaic acid. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify impurities observed during the stability tests of a new liposomal dosage form of azelaic acid that is composed of phosphati-dylcholine and a mixture of ethyl alcohol and water, using high-performance liquid chromatography with evaporative light-scattering detector (HPLC-ELSD), gas chromatography–flame ionisation detection (GC-FID), and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) methods. During the research and development of a new liposomal formulation of azelaic acid, we developed a method for determining the contamination of azelaic acid using HPLC-ELSD. During our analytical tests, we identified a previ-ously unknown impurity of a liposomal preparation of azelaic acid that appeared in the liposomal formulation of azelaic acid during preliminary stability studies. The procedure led to the conclusion that the impurity was caused by the reaction of azelaic acid with one of the excipients that was applied in the product. The impurity was finally identified as an ethyl monoester of azelaic acid. The identification procedure of this compound was carried out in a series of experiments comparing the chromatograms that were obtained via the following chromatographic methods: HPLC-ELSD, GC-FID, and GC-MS.

40|$|In this study, acids {{with various}} chain lengths (C 6, C 8, C 10 and C 12) {{modified}} by methane sulfonic acid (MSA) and temperature {{were used to}} modify tapioca starch (TPS), then the glycerol (GA) were added into modified starch, to prepare new blends. The mechanical properties, thermal properties and physical properties of blends were studied. This investigation was divided into two parts. First, the biodegradable materials were used such as starch and glycerol with <b>hexanedioic</b> <b>acid</b> (HA), suberic acid (SBA), sebacic acid (SA), decanedicarboxylic acid (DA) manufacturing with different temperatures (90, 110 and 130 °C). And then, the solution was added into modified starch to prepare the blends by using single-screw extruder. The FT-IR patterns indicated that the characteristic peak of C=O in ester was observed at 1730 cm- 1. It is proved that different chain length acids (C 6, C 8, C 10 and C 12) reacted with glycerol by esterification and these are used to plasticize blends during extrusion. In addition, the blends would improve the hydrolysis and thermal stability. The water contact angle increased from 43. 0 ° to 64. 0 °. Second, the HA (110 °C), SBA (110 °C), SA (110 °C), and DA blends (130 °C) were used in study, because they possessed good mechanical properties, water resistances and thermal stability. On the other hand, the various contents (0, 0. 005, 0. 010, 0. 020 g) of MSA were also used to modify the mechanical properties of blends. We observed that the blends were added to MSA, and then the FT-IR patterns indicated that the C=O ester appeared at 1730 cm- 1. For this reason, the hydrophobic blends were produced. The water contact angle of the MSA blends increased from 55. 0 ° to 71. 0 °. Although break elongation of the MSA blends reduced from the original 220 % to 128 %, the stress increased from 2. 5 MPa to 5. 1 MPa. Therefore, the optimal composition of blends was the DA blend (130 °C) with adding of MSA (0. 005 g) ...|$|E
