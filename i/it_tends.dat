5|$|Its {{sedimentary}} structure, or bedding, is moderately well developed. Like most shales, <b>it</b> <b>tends</b> {{to split}} easily along the bedding plane, a property known as fissility.|$|E
5|$|Like many large, active sharks, {{this species}} adapts poorly to captivity; <b>it</b> <b>tends</b> {{to bump into}} the sides of its enclosure, and the {{resulting}} abrasions then become infected with often fatal consequences.|$|E
5|$|This variety has a closed, bulb-like rosette {{of winter}} leaves which are {{acicular}} (pointy) at the tip. <b>It</b> <b>tends</b> to grow on igneous substrates.|$|E

5|$|This variety has open winter rosettes {{composed}} of leaves which are spatulate {{in shape and}} have an obtuse or rounded end. <b>It</b> <b>tends</b> to grow in limestone-based substrates.|$|E
5|$|Ascending cholangitis, {{also known}} as acute cholangitis or simply cholangitis, is an {{infection}} of the bile duct (cholangitis), usually caused by bacteria ascending from its junction with the duodenum (first part of the small intestine). <b>It</b> <b>tends</b> to occur if the bile duct is already partially obstructed by gallstones.|$|E
5|$|Chlorine is a {{toxic gas}} that attacks the {{respiratory}} system, eyes, and skin. Because it is denser than air, <b>it</b> <b>tends</b> to accumulate {{at the bottom}} of poorly ventilated spaces. Chlorine gas is a strong oxidizer, which may react with flammable materials.|$|E
50|$|One {{limitation}} on {{the uses of}} Galalith was that when made into items above a certain size <b>it</b> <b>tended</b> to splinter or warp.|$|R
50|$|Freud {{proposed}} that psychological energy was constant (hence, emotional changes consisted only in displacements) and that <b>it</b> <b>tended</b> to rest (point attractor) through discharge (catharsis).|$|R

5|$|It is {{also found}} in brackish-water {{habitats}} and is sometimes seen swimming in salt water. It has been much more successful at colonizing Atlantic and Gulf coast barrier islands than the copperhead. However, even on these islands, <b>it</b> <b>tends</b> to favor freshwater marshes. A study by Dunson and Freda (1985) describes it as not being particularly salt-tolerant.|$|E
5|$|The New Guinean quoll (D. albopunctatus) {{is found}} {{throughout}} most of New Guinea. <b>It</b> <b>tends</b> to live at an elevation of about , and is {{not found in the}} south-western lowlands, although it can found on Yapen Island.|$|E
5|$|The {{detailed}} {{dynamics of}} this rule are complicated, including {{the existence of}} small stable structures. However, in the aggregate (when started with all cells in random states) <b>it</b> <b>tends</b> to form large regions of cells that {{are all in the}} same state as each other, with the boundaries between these regions evolving according to the curve-shortening flow.|$|E

5|$|Applesauce cake is {{a dessert}} cake {{prepared}} using apple sauce, flour and sugar as primary ingredients. Various spices are typically used, and <b>it</b> <b>tends</b> to be a moist cake. Applesauce cake prepared with chunky-style apple sauce {{may be less}} moist. Several additional ingredients may also be used in its preparation, and it is sometimes prepared {{and served as a}} coffee cake. The cake dates back to early colonial times in the United States. National Applesauce Cake Day occurs annually on June 6 in the U.S.|$|E
5|$|Head pain {{occurs in}} 50–75% {{of all cases}} of {{vertebral}} artery dissection. <b>It</b> <b>tends</b> to be located {{at the back of}} the head, either on the affected side or in the middle, and develops gradually. It is either dull or pressure-like in character or throbbing. About half of those with VAD consider the headache distinct, while the remainder have had a similar headache before. It is suspected that VAD with headache as the only symptom is fairly common; 8% of all cases of vertebral and carotid dissection are diagnosed on the basis of pain alone.|$|E
5|$|In {{some areas}} of the world, {{including}} Berlin, Germany, dropping salt is prohibited altogether except on the highest-risk roads; plain sand without any melting agents is spread instead. While this may protect the environment, it is more labour-intensive, as more gritting runs are needed; because the sand is insoluble, <b>it</b> <b>tends</b> to accumulate at the sides of the road, making it more difficult for buses to pull in at bus stops.|$|E
50|$|Some {{efforts to}} address this situation, such as {{pressuring}} the child to eat a disliked food or threatening punishment for not eating <b>it,</b> <b>tend</b> to exacerbate the problem.|$|R
25|$|Unlike other left groups, the SPGB {{did not see}} fascism as {{a special}} threat to the working class. Rather than formulating it as the last refuge of {{capitalism}} organising to defend itself against the working class, the party’s writers and speakers <b>tended</b> to view <b>it</b> as {{a particular type of}} reform movement. The two specific characteristics identified, though, were that <b>it</b> <b>tended</b> to be a form of national consolidation – unifying fragment nations such as Germany, Italy and Spain – and that <b>it</b> <b>tended</b> to have the mass support of the working class.|$|R
50|$|The film's {{copyright}} lapsed in 1967 {{and it is}} now in {{the public}} domain, with the result that, prior to its recent restoration, <b>it</b> <b>tended</b> to circulate in seriously degraded prints.|$|R
5|$|In {{the board}} (and card) game domain, 4X {{is less of}} a {{distinct}} genre, {{in part because of the}} practical constraints of components and playing time. The Civilization board game that gave rise to Sid Meier's Civilization computer game, for instance, has no exploration and no extermination. Unless extermination is targeted at non-player entities, <b>it</b> <b>tends</b> to be either nearly impossible (because of play balance mechanisms, since player elimination is usually considered an undesirable feature) or certainly unachievable (because victory conditions are triggered before extermination can be completed) in board games.|$|E
5|$|Inversions. When on a {{clear and}} calm night, a {{radiation}} inversion is formed near the ground, the friction does not affect wind above {{the top of the}} inversion layer. The change in wind can be 90degrees in direction and 40kt in speed. Even a nocturnal (overnight) low level jet can sometimes be observed. <b>It</b> <b>tends</b> to be strongest towards sunrise. Density differences cause additional problems to aviation.|$|E
5|$|It is a hardy breed, {{and can be}} stubborn, {{leading to}} issues with {{training}}. A Westie may need to have its training refreshed on occasion during its lifetime. Having a typical terrier prey drive, <b>it</b> <b>tends</b> to be highly interested in toys, especially chasing balls. It does retain the instincts of an earth-dog, including inquisitive and investigative traits, as well as natural instincts to both bark and dig holes. It is ranked 47th in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs.|$|E

5|$|It {{is fairly}} easy to grow in areas with a Mediterranean climate, but does not do well in areas with high summer humidity. It {{requires}} a sunny position in well-drained soil, and tolerates at least moderate frost. It should be pruned lightly, not below the green foliage, as <b>it</b> <b>tends</b> to become straggly with age otherwise. Seeds do not require any treatment prior to sowing, and take 21 to 35 days to germinate.|$|E
5|$|Later work by Wolfram {{identifies}} the one-dimensional Rule 37R automaton as being particularly interesting in this respect. When {{run on a}} finite array of cells with periodic boundary conditions, starting from a small seed of random cells centered within a larger empty neighborhood, <b>it</b> <b>tends</b> to fluctuate between ordered and chaotic states. However, with the same initial conditions on an unbounded set of cells its configurations tend to organize themselves into several types of simple moving particles.|$|E
5|$|Lead is a {{relatively}} unreactive post-transition metal. Its weak, metallic character is illustrated by its amphoteric nature; lead and lead oxides react with acids and bases, and <b>it</b> <b>tends</b> to form covalent bonds. Compounds of lead are usually found in the +2 oxidation state rather than the +4 state common with lighter members of the carbon group. Exceptions are mostly limited to organolead compounds. Like the lighter members of the group, lead tends to bond with itself; it can form chains, rings and polyhedral structures.|$|E

2500|$|Joseph Nickl {{designed}} a selective-fire conversion in 1930. <b>It</b> <b>tended</b> to [...] "cook off" [...] (fire by spontaneous ignition of the propellant when overheated) when fired in long bursts. Only 4,000 {{of this model}} were made between 1930 and 1931.|$|R
50|$|The {{story of}} Horatius {{at the bridge}} began to be {{depicted}} in art in the Renaissance, but was never popular. <b>It</b> <b>tended</b> to be shown by artists who favoured recondite classical stories, and appear in the minor arts, such as plaquettes and maiolica.|$|R
