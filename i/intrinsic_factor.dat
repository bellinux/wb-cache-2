25|$|Pernicious anemia is an {{autoimmune}} disease wherein the body lacks <b>intrinsic</b> <b>factor,</b> required to absorb vitamin B12 from food. Vitamin B12 {{is needed for}} the production of hemoglobin.|$|E
25|$|The parietal {{cells of}} the human stomach are {{responsible}} for producing <b>intrinsic</b> <b>factor,</b> which {{is necessary for the}} absorption of vitamin B12. B12 is used in cellular metabolism and is necessary for the production of red blood cells, and the functioning of the nervous system.|$|E
25|$|Absorption of food vitamin B12 thus {{requires}} an intact and functioning stomach, exocrine pancreas, <b>intrinsic</b> <b>factor,</b> and small bowel. Problems with {{any one of}} these organs makes a vitamin B12 deficiency possible. Individuals who lack <b>intrinsic</b> <b>factor</b> have a decreased ability to absorb B12. In pernicious anemia, {{there is a lack of}} IF due to autoimmune atrophic gastritis, in which antibodies form against parietal cells. Antibodies may alternately form against and bind to IF, inhibiting it from carrying out its B12 protective function. Due to the complexity of B12 absorption, geriatric patients, many of whom are hypoacidic due to reduced parietal cell function, have an increased risk of B12 deficiency. This results in 80–100% excretion of oral doses in the feces versus 30–60% excretion in feces as seen in individuals with adequate IF.|$|E
40|$|The primary aim of {{the current}} {{research}} was to study the effect of various <b>intrinsic</b> <b>factors</b> on consumer decision making vis-à-vis impulsive buying tendencies. After employing EFA and CFA on 630 consumers in the different parts of Jammu and Kashmir, results showed that <b>intrinsic</b> <b>factors</b> significantly influence the Impulsive Buying Decision. The application of Structural Equation Modeling disintegrated <b>intrinsic</b> <b>factors</b> into positive and negative influencers of impulsive buying behaviour. The present study has significant bearing in consumer world as it has highlighted through a model for how <b>intrinsic</b> <b>factors</b> shape the buying tendencies of a young consumer. Through the application of Multi Group Analysis, a comparison has been drawn between impulsive buying behaviour and various <b>intrinsic</b> <b>factors</b> across males and females taken as two different consumer groups. Overall results have been found significant and could well be adopted for strategy making by various stake holders {{in the field of}} consumer psychology and consumer behaviour to figure out the effects of <b>intrinsic</b> <b>factors</b> on buying behaviour...|$|R

25|$|This {{pattern of}} B12 {{transfer}} to a special binding protein secreted in a previous digestive step, is repeated once more before absorption. The next binding protein for B12 is <b>intrinsic</b> <b>factor</b> (IF), a protein synthesized by gastric parietal cells that is secreted in response to histamine, gastrin and pentagastrin, {{as well as the}} presence of food.|$|E
25|$|In the duodenum, proteases digest R-proteins {{and release}} their bound B12, which then binds to IF, {{to form a}} complex (IF/B12). B12 must be {{attached}} to IF {{for it to be}} efficiently absorbed, as receptors on the enterocytes in the terminal ileum of the small bowel only recognize the B12-IF complex; in addition, <b>intrinsic</b> <b>factor</b> protects the vitamin from catabolism by intestinal bacteria.|$|E
25|$|Among {{those at}} highest risk for B12 {{deficiency}} are the elderly population, as 10-15% of people aged 60+ may present with some form of hypocobalaminemia. High rates of deficiency in the elderly commonly results from the decrease of functional absorption of B12, as production of <b>intrinsic</b> <b>factor</b> declines with age. However, pernicious anemia {{is the most common}} cause of B12 deficiency in North American and European populations.|$|E

40|$|The study {{seeks to}} examine the {{relationship}} between <b>intrinsic</b> <b>factors</b> and job satisfaction among the lecturers of Bauchi State University Gadau (BASUG), Nigeria. This Study uses <b>intrinsic</b> <b>factors</b> as independent variables, whereas job satisfaction as a dependent variable is based on the theoretical framework of „two factor theory‟ of Fredrick Herzberg (1959). The study employs close-ended questions adapted and adopted from the Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire (MSQ) and interviews were also conducted to compliment the result of the survey questions in measuring the relationship between <b>intrinsic</b> <b>factors</b> and job satisfaction among 148 academic staff of BASUG that had participated in the study. Accordingly, descriptive statistic was used in testing the data collected. The findings reveal that there is a positive and significant relationship between <b>intrinsic</b> <b>factors</b> and job satisfaction where, specifically, „responsibility‟, „work itself‟ are positively related to job satisfaction and interview responses found that staff training and library needs to be upgraded and improved in order to increase the level of job satisfaction of lecturers of Bauchi State University Gadau, Nigeria...|$|R

Nosocomial central venous catheter infections were categorized as catheter related bacteremias and site infections. The nonramdonized convenience sample consisted of 30 subjects who had central venous catheters in place less than 48 hours and who were able to give informed consent. A descriptive design was used and Pearson Correlational Coefficients were computed to examine the relationships between <b>intrinsic</b> <b>factors,</b> extrinsic factors and central venous catheter infections. Two cases of catheter related bacteremia were identified. No cases of site infection were documented.

25|$|B12 {{deficiency}} {{is often}} associated with pernicious anemia, as it is the most common cause. Pernicious anemia results from an autoimmune disorder which destroys the cells that produce <b>intrinsic</b> <b>factor</b> within the stomach lining, thereby hindering B12 absorption. B12 absorption is important for the subsequent absorption of iron, thus, people with pernicious anemia often present with typical symptoms of anemia, such as pale skin, dizziness, and fatigue.|$|E
25|$|Also {{known as}} cobalamin, B12 is an {{essential}} vitamin necessary for normal blood formation. It is also important {{for the maintenance of}} neurological function and psychiatric health. The absorption of B12 into the body requires adequate amounts of <b>intrinsic</b> <b>factor,</b> the glycoprotein produced in the parietal cells of the stomach lining. A functioning small intestine is also necessary for the proper metabolism of the vitamin, as absorption occurs within the ileum.|$|E
25|$|Vitamin B12 {{requires}} <b>intrinsic</b> <b>factor</b> {{from the}} gastric mucosa to be absorbed. In {{patients with a}} small gastric pouch, {{it may not be}} absorbed, even if supplemented orally, and deficiencies can result in pernicious anemia and neuropathies. Vitamin B12 deficiency is quite common after gastric bypass surgery with reported rates of 30% in some clinical trials. Sublingual B12 (cyanocobalamin) appears to be adequately absorbed. In cases where sublingual B12 does not provide sufficient amounts, injections may be needed.|$|E

An interesting question is: for such systems, how should preventive maintenance be scheduled? This paper investigates this question. The paper develops a maintenance policy for repairable systems subject to extrinsic shocks. It assumes that a system may fail due to either <b>intrinsic</b> <b>factors</b> or extrinsic factors. Reliability indexes and the expected long run cost rate are then derived. A numerical example {{is given to}} illustrate the theoretical results...|$|R
25|$|Those {{afflicted with}} various {{gastrointestinal}} diseases {{may also be}} at risk for deficiency as a result of malabsorption. These diseases may affect production of <b>intrinsic</b> <b>factor</b> in the stomach, or of pancreatic bile. Diseases that involve disorders of the small intestine, such as celiac disease, Crohn's disease and ileitis, may also reduce B12 absorption. For example, people with Celiac's disease may damage the microvilli within their small intestines through the consumption of gluten, thereby inhibiting absorption of B12 as well as other nutrients.|$|E
25|$|Methyl-B12 {{is absorbed}} by two processes. The first is an {{intestinal}} mechanism using <b>intrinsic</b> <b>factor</b> through which 1–2 micrograms can be absorbed every few hours. The second is a diffusion {{process by which}} approximately 1% of the remainder is absorbed. The human physiology of vitamin B12 is complex, and therefore is prone to mishaps leading to vitamin B12 deficiency. Protein-bound vitamin B12 must be released from the proteins {{by the action of}} digestive proteases in both the stomach and small intestine. Gastric acid releases the vitamin from food particles; therefore antacid and acid-blocking medications (especially proton-pump inhibitors) may inhibit absorption of B12.|$|E

The damage received from the falls represents the sixth cause of death in persons over 65 years old. The risk factors for falling have been classified in two great groups: <b>intrinsic</b> <b>factors</b> and not <b>intrinsic</b> <b>factors.</b> Between the main <b>intrinsic</b> <b>factors</b> there are the muscular weakness, the deficit of equilibrium and coordination, the deficits of propriocettivity. Between the not <b>intrinsic</b> <b>factors</b> there are use of some drugs and the lack of security measures in the domestic atmosphere.

The most recent present studies in literature, such as the appraisal of this risk, must be conducted in multiparametric way. A series of specific semeiological tests exist for the appraisal of some of these risk factors (chair test for the appraisal of the muscular weakness, for example).
