5|$|Taw {{appealed to}} the High Court against his {{conviction}} on two main grounds. The first involved the admissibility of evidence for his corruption, and, additionally, inconsistencies of such evidence. The second concerned constitutional issues. With regard to the evidential issue, the Court held that the trial judge made an error <b>in</b> <b>accepting</b> GIC's statements as admissible, and thus ordered Taw's convictions to be set aside.|$|E

5|$|Fodor {{starts with}} some criticisms of {{so-called}} standard realism. This view is characterized, according to Fodor, by two distinct assertions. One of these regards the internal structure of mental states and asserts that such states are non-relational. The other concerns the semantic theory of mental content and asserts {{that there is}} an isomorphism between the causal roles of such contents and the inferential web of beliefs. Among modern philosophers of mind, the majority view seems to be that the first of these two assertions is false, but that the second is true. Fodor departs from this view <b>in</b> <b>accepting</b> the truth of the first thesis but rejecting strongly the truth of the second.|$|E
5|$|Gemini was {{formally}} launched on 21 November 2001 at the Hotel Connemara, Chennai {{in the presence}} of celebrities including Rajinikanth (through video conferencing) and Kamal Haasan. The launch function was marked by the submission of the script, songs and lyrics. Principal photography was scheduled to begin in mid-December that year, but commenced slightly earlier. Vikram shot for the film simultaneously with Samurai (2002). When Kalabhavan Mani was hesitant <b>in</b> <b>accepting</b> the film due to other commitments in Malayalam, shooting was re-scheduled to film his scenes first. Saran persuaded Mani to allot dates for twelve days to complete his scenes. Since Mani was a mimicry artist, Saran asked him to exhibit his talents; Mani aped the behaviour of a few animals and Saran chose among them, which were added to the film.|$|E
5|$|In June2011, {{a federal}} {{document}} detailing the actions made by province officials was released to be public and incited further outcry from residents {{affected by the}} storm.

In an email sent on September21, 2010, Denys Doiron, the nation's Emergency Preparedness and Response Officer, relayed that local emergency services reported Igor to be the worst disaster they have had to deal with. Doiron also stated that no requests for federal aid were made.|$|E
5|$|Most records {{received}} by the committee are processed within a year and published in its annual report in British Birds. Some records prove problematic, and for some species, it has taken the committee {{many years to come}} to a decision. This has particularly been the case where the species or subspecies in question was new to Britain—examples include northern harrier (Britain's first, in Scilly <b>in</b> 1982, <b>accepted</b> <b>in</b> 2007), long-toed stint (Britain's first, in Cornwall <b>in</b> 1970, <b>accepted</b> <b>in</b> 1994), least tern (Britain's first, and to date only record, <b>accepted</b> <b>in</b> 2005, after first occurring in 1983), black lark (Britain's first, from Spurn, Yorkshire <b>in</b> 1984, <b>accepted</b> <b>in</b> 2004 after a second set of notes came to light), Sykes's warbler (the first three records, from 1959, 1977, and 1993, <b>accepted</b> <b>in</b> 2003), Iberian chiffchaff (the first two records, from 1972 and 1992, <b>accepted</b> <b>in</b> 2000), and Hume's leaf warbler (the first 27 records, the earliest from 1966, <b>accepted</b> <b>in</b> 1998). Occasionally, decisions have been delayed due to non-ornithological factors, perhaps most notably with the loss by the Royal Mail of a file on Britain's first lesser short-toed lark.|$|R

5|$|Modern {{scholars}} and readers {{have criticized the}} book for what are seen as condescending racist descriptions of the book's black characters, {{especially with regard to}} the characters' appearances, speech, and behavior, as well as the passive nature of Uncle Tom <b>in</b> <b>accepting</b> his fate. The novel's creation and use of common stereotypes about African Americans is significant because Uncle Tom's Cabin was the best-selling novel in the world during the 19th century. As a result, the book (along with illustrations from the book and associated stage productions) {{played a major role in}} permanently ingraining these stereotypes into the American psyche.|$|E
5|$|Yagan's skull {{was handed}} over to the Noongar {{delegation}} at a ceremony at Liverpool Town Hall on 31 August 1997. <b>In</b> <b>accepting</b> the skull, Colbung made comments that were interpreted as linking Yagan's death with the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, earlier that day: That is how nature goes... Nature is a carrier of all good things and all bad things. And because the Poms did the wrong thing, they now have to suffer. Colbung's comments prompted a media furore throughout Australia, with newspapers receiving many letters from the public expressing shock and anger at the comments. Colbung later claimed that his comments had been misinterpreted.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of February 1426 a special ceremony was dedicated to Jelena and Sandalj in Dubrovnik when they attended the feast of Sveti Vlaho (Saint Blaise), the city's patron saint. Jelena intended {{to be buried in}} the church she would build in Dubrovnik. Initially, Dubrovnik was interested <b>in</b> <b>accepting</b> her wish on the condition that she help them take control of Novi, its rival in salt-trading. That is why Dubrovnik proposed to Sandalj to build an Orthodox church and home for old and sick people in 1434. Sandalj died in 1435 before he replied to their proposal. He was succeeded by his nephew Stjepan Vukčić Kosača who was a son of Sandalj's brother Vukac. After Sandalj's death Jelena did not interfere in the governing of the realm previously controlled by her husband but went to live at the seaside, probably in Novi. In September 1435 Jelena asked the Ragusans to allow her to build a church in Dubrovnik in which would be her grave. Since circumstances had changed after Sandalj's death, the Ragusans rejected Jelena's request although it was supported by her nephew, Serbian Despot Đurađ Branković. They justified their refusal with the lack of the approval of the Pope.|$|E

5|$|During {{his tenure}} on Why Don't You?, Davies oversaw the {{production}} of a story that took place in Loch Ness. The story was the precursor for his first freelance children's project: Dark Season. The show, originally called The Adventuresome Three, would feature the Why Don't You? characters in a purely dramatic setting that was influenced by his childhood. He submitted the script {{to the head of the}} BBC's Children's department, Anna Home, and Granada Television. Both companies were interested in producing the show with minor changes: Granada wished to produce it as one six-part serial, as opposed to Davies' plan of two three-part serials; and Home was interested <b>in</b> <b>accepting</b> the show on the condition it included a new cast of characters. He accepted Home's offer, and the show was allocated the budget and timeslot of Maid Marian and her Merry Men, which had been put on hiatus the year before.|$|E
5|$|In the 1876 presidential election, Republican Rutherford B. Hayes of Ohio {{defeated}} Democrat Samuel J. Tilden of New York {{in one of}} {{the most}} hotly contested presidential elections to that time in the nation's history. The results initially indicated a Democratic victory, but the electoral votes of several states were ardently disputed until mere days before the new president was to be inaugurated. Members of both parties in Congress agreed to convene a bipartisan Electoral Commission, which ultimately decided the race for Hayes. Payne was named to the committee at Tilden's request, but the results went against the Democrats as Hayes was declared the winner of the disputed votes. After the Commissions result, Payne joined many Democrats in attempting to delay the House proceedings in hopes of forcing a more favorable result, but was outvoted by Republicans and the Democrats who sided with Speaker Samuel J. Randall <b>in</b> <b>accepting</b> the Commission's result. The effort failed, and Hayes became president on March 4, 1877.|$|E
5|$|On October 5, Secretary of State Robert Lansing was {{the first}} {{official}} to propose that Marshall forcibly assume presidential powers and duties. Other cabinet secretaries backed Lansing's request, as did Congressional leaders, including members of both the Democratic and Republican parties who sent private communications to Marshall. Marshall was cautious <b>in</b> <b>accepting</b> their offers of support. After consulting {{with his wife and}} his long-time personal adviser, Mark Thistlethwaite, he privately refused to assume Wilson's duties and become Acting President of the United States. The process for declaring a president incapacitated was unclear at that time, and he feared the precedent that might be set if he forcibly removed Wilson from his powers and duties. Marshall wanted the president to voluntarily allow his powers to devolve to the vice president, but that was impossible given his condition and unlikely given Wilson's dislike for Marshall. Marshall informed the cabinet that the only cases in which he would assume Wilson's powers and duties were a joint resolution of Congress calling on him to do so, or an official communication from Wilson or his staff asserting his inability to perform his duties.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to answer}} three objectives which are: (1) {{to identify the}} maxims which are flouted by the main characters to create humor <b>in</b> Pink‟s <b>Accepted</b> movie; (2) to describe the forms of humor expressed by the main characters through maxim flouting <b>in</b> Pink‟s <b>Accepted</b> movie; and (3) to explain the functions of humor expressed by the main characters through maxim flouting <b>in</b> Pink‟s <b>Accepted</b> movie. This research employed the descriptive qualitative method. The data were {{in the form of}} utterances i. e. words, clauses, phrases, and sentences. The contexts of the data were dialogues. The source of the data was an American comedy movie entitled Accepted. The data were collected by watching the movie, retrieving the movie transcript, checking the suitability between the movie and the transcript, watching and re-watching the movie to find the relevant data, identifying the dialogues in the movie which are in accordance with the research objectives, and recording the data into the data sheet. Furthermore, the researcher employed some steps in analyzing the data which are: classifying the flouting of maxims of Cooperative Principle employed by the main characters to create humor; analyzing the forms and functions of humor which appear through the flouting of maxims; identifying the errors in the data collection to gain appropriate data; and drawing conclusions for the research questions. Finally, the data findings were triangulated by two linguistics students. There are three findings found in this research. The first finding reveals that the main characters <b>in</b> <b>Accepted</b> movie employ all types of maxim flouting, i. e. flouting of maxim of quantity, maxim of quality, maxim of manner and maxim of relation to create humorous utterances. Meanwhile, flouting of quality maxim becomes the most frequent way to create humor. The second finding shows that there are two forms of humor found as the result of maxim flouting done by the main characters <b>in</b> <b>Accepted</b> movie: jokes and spontaneous conversational humor. The third finding depicts that the four functions of humor, i. e social management, decommitment, mediation and defunctionalization, are employed by the main characters <b>in</b> <b>Accepted</b> movie. Social management becomes the most employed function since the dialogues were mostly occured in everyday social interaction. Key words: humor, maxim flouting, main characters, Accepted movie...|$|R
