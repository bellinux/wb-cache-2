500|$|With Indicud, {{on several}} tracks Cudi took a {{backseat}} in vocals to rather showcase his production skills. [...] "The {{focus was on}} producing the record for Kendrick, I wanted to shine as a producer first. I wanted to show that side off {{more than anything else}} and that's why I had my one verse then let Kendrick go ape-sh-- crazy all over the rest of it." [...] As for the A$AP Rocky feature on [...] "Brothers," [...] Cudi explained that he made the decision to go with a minimal hook and let the Harlem rapper dominate the track: [...] "I felt like that was a perfect beat for A$AP to get on there and speak some truths and talk to the younger generation, because he's in a place where a lot of kids are up to him and Kendrick. I just wanted to <b>hear</b> <b>him</b> <b>say</b> something a little bit more thoughtful, and he did that — he showed up. I was blown away by his craftsmanship, his professionalism and his overall mojo." ...|$|E
500|$|Concerning the {{recording}} of the album's opening song [...] "N.Y. State of Mind", producer DJ Premier later stated [...] "Nas — he's one of our saviors now. When we did ‘N.Y. State of Mind,’ at the beginning when he says, ‘Straight out the dungeons of rap / Where fake niggas don’t make it back,’ then you <b>hear</b> <b>him</b> <b>say,</b> ‘I don’t know how to start this shit,’ ’cause he had just written it. He's got the beat running in the studio, but he doesn’t know how he's going to format how he's going to convey it. So he's going, ‘I don’t know how to start this shit,’ and I’m counting him in [...] One, two, three. And then you can hear him go, ‘Yo,’ and then he goes right into it." [...] DJ Premier later discussed the unexpectedness of Nas's delivery during {{the recording}}, stating [...] "He didn’t know how he was gonna come in, but he just started going because we were recording. I’m actually yelling, ‘We’re recording!’ and banging on the [...] window. ‘Come on, get ready!’ You hear him start the shit: Rappers…. And then everyone in the studio was like, ‘Oh, my God’, ’cause it was so unexpected. He was not ready. So we used that first verse. And {{that was when he}} was up and coming, his first album. So we was like, 'Yo, this guy is gonna be big.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Egypt {{qualifying}} for the Olympic quarter-finals on 1 August, {{six months to}} the day after being devastated by Port Said Stadium disaster. For no-one was the triumph more poignant than the team's captain, Mohamed Aboutrika. It is hardly surprising to hear that the 33-year-old will never forget what he saw that dreadful night, which ended with him comforting the injured and dying in a chaotic Al Ahly dressing room. What is unexpected is to <b>hear</b> <b>him</b> <b>say</b> that he doesn’t wish to forget. However, as Aboutrika explained, it is his desire to honour the 79 who lost their lives in Port Said which compels him to keep them uppermost in his thoughts as he leads the national team onwards at London 2012. [...] "Those people are always in my mind because we held them as they were dying," [...] he recalled. [...] "They are always with us and they give us strong motivation to honour them and give everything we have. We try to help their families in whatever way we can, and hopefully winning here will provide the all people back home with some happiness." ...|$|E

6000|$|Gertrude had {{got used}} to <b>hearing</b> <b>him</b> <b>say</b> this. There {{was not so much}} {{excitement}} in it as at first. [...] "What ought one to do?" [...] she continued. [...] "To give parties, to go to the theatre, to read novels, to keep late hours?" ...|$|R
2500|$|As the {{shooting}} continued outside, nurses and medics entered the building. [...] An unidentified soldier secured the south double doors with his ACU belt {{and rushed to}} help the wounded. According to the responding nurses, {{there was so much}} blood covering the floor inside the building, that they were unable to maintain balance, and had difficulty reaching the wounded to help them. In the area outside the building, Hasan continued to shoot at fleeing soldiers. [...] Herman Toro, Director of the Soldier Readiness Processing Site, arrived at this time. [...] Hasan had gone around the building and was out of sight, but still shooting. Toro and another site worker rushed to assist Lieutenant Colonel Juanita Warman who was down on the ground north of the medical building. [...] They both took her by the arms and tried to carry her to safety when Hasan returned and aimed his red laser across Toro's chest, but did not fire. [...] Toro took cover behind an electrical box and saw civilian police Sergeant Mark Todd arrive and shout commands at Hasan to surrender. Todd said: [...] "Then he turned and fired a couple of rounds at me. I didn't <b>hear</b> <b>him</b> <b>say</b> a word, he just turned and fired." [...] The two exchanged shots, and then Hasan's pistol was empty. [...] He stopped, turned and reached into his pocket for a new magazine and was felled by five shots from Todd, who ran over to him, kicked the pistol out of his hand and put handcuffs on him as he fell unconscious. LTC Tom Eberhart, Deputy Director of Human Resources, Fort Hood, arrived and entered the Medical Building to help. [...] He had to step over bodies to enter the building's north entrance. He assisted another soldier in performing CPR on one of the wounded soldiers at the building's waiting area. [...] Folding chairs were scattered all around. [...] He noticed a soldier outside the south doors of the building and went to help. [...] He had to remove the belt from the door and went outside as others were arriving. [...] The downed soldier was Staff Sergeant Alonzo Lunsford, a medical assistant from the building. [...] He had two wounds in the abdomen and a wound to the scalp. He was unconscious and LTC Eberhart went back into the building to retrieve a folding table. [...] Other soldiers assisted getting SSG Lunsford onto the table and around the building to the triage area.|$|E

He kept interpolating observations concerning some boat and the davits and sails filling with the wind. It made one feel queer, in the dusky laboratory, to <b>hear</b> <b>him</b> <b>saying</b> such things.|$|R
