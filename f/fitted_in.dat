5|$|Korall radar-jammers were {{mounted on}} either side of the {{mainmast}} as well as a Machta system on the foremast. Solentse-1P infrared detectors were carried {{on either side}} of the superstructure. Fakel-MO and Fakel-MZ antenna comprised the IFF system.

5|$|The Océan-class ironclads were {{designed}} by Henri Dupuy de Lôme as an improved version of the s. The ships were central battery ironclads with the armament concentrated amidships. For {{the first time in}} a French ironclad three watertight iron bulkheads were <b>fitted</b> <b>in</b> the hull. Like most ironclads of their era they were equipped with a metal-reinforced ram.|$|E
5|$|Both {{ships were}} {{refitted}} in early 1940 {{and a number}} of minor changes were made. The necessary improvements identified for the main armament during their sea trials a year earlier were finally implemented, the canvas cover for the back of the turrets was replaced by a rolling door, new radios were installed, and shields were fitted to the anti-aircraft machine guns and the searchlights. A SS-6 sonar was <b>fitted</b> <b>in</b> June 1940, but proved to be ineffectual.|$|E
5|$|Both {{versions}} use {{a common}} airframe, with three Rolls-Royce Turbomeca RTM322 engines, their range and endurance using only a two engine cruise option, is , or six hours. However, range {{can be extended}} further when the five underfloor fuel tanks are supplemented with auxiliary fuel tanks <b>fitted</b> <b>in</b> the cabin. Armament depends on mission, but includes anti-ship missiles, torpedoes, three door-mounted machine guns, multi-purpose rocket, cannon pods, air-to-air missiles and air-to-surface missiles. At least 14 Merlin HM2s will be assigned to the carrier.|$|E

5|$|During World War I, {{a pair of}} 50-caliber 76-millimeter guns on high-angle mounts were fitted as {{anti-aircraft}} (AA) guns, one gun at the bow and {{the other}} on top of 'X' turret. In 1925 the number of 50-caliber 76-millimeter guns was reduced to 13, all mounted on the turret tops, and six new 40-caliber 76-millimeter guns were installed abreast the aft funnel. Two license-built 2-pounder AA guns were also <b>fitted.</b> <b>In</b> 1926 the rangefinders were upgraded and a fixed aircraft catapult was mounted on the port side of the forecastle for a Macchi M.18 seaplane.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1960s and early 1970s, Boeing studied the {{development}} of a shorter 747 with three engines, to compete with the smaller L-1011 TriStar and DC-10. The 747 trijet would have had more payload, range, and passenger capacity than the L-1011 and DC-10. The center engine would have been <b>fitted</b> <b>in</b> the tail with an S-duct intake similar to the L-1011's. However, engineering studies showed that a total redesign of the 747 wing would be necessary. Maintaining the same 747 handling characteristics would be important to minimize pilot retraining. Boeing decided instead to pursue a shortened four-engine 747, resulting in the 747SP.|$|E
5|$|Early warning {{would have}} been {{provided}} by a Type 2, Mark 2, Model 1 air search radar mounted {{at the top of}} the foremast. A Type 93 passive hydrophone system {{would have been}} <b>fitted</b> <b>in</b> the bow. The ships were designed to carry three aircraft on a platform between the funnel and the mainmast. These would have consisted of one three-seat Aichi E13A and two two-seat Yokosuka E14Y floatplanes. They would have been launched by a pair of aircraft catapults, one on each side of the aircraft platform.|$|E

5|$|Eight 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes were <b>fitted</b> <b>in</b> two QR Mk VII quadruple mounts to {{the deck}} below the {{platform}} for the 4-inch guns. Only eight Mark 9 torpedoes were carried. Sydney was fitted with a single depth charge rail at the stern, which held five Mk VII depth charges. Four 3-pounder (47-mm, 1.9-in) quick-firing Hotchkiss guns were carried as saluting guns. These were removed during the August 1940 refit.|$|E
5|$|Her {{anti-aircraft}} armament {{consisted of}} a single QF 3 inch 20 cwt AA gun on a high-angle MKII mount at the aft end of the superstructure that was carried from July 1915. A 3-pounder Hotchkiss gun on a high-angle MkIc mounting with a maximum elevation of 60° was <b>fitted</b> <b>in</b> November 1914 and used until August 1917. A 4-inch BL MK VII on a HA MkII mount was added in April 1917. Five 18-inch (450-mm) submerged torpedo tubes were fitted on the Invincibles, two on each side {{and one in the}} stern. Fourteen torpedoes were carried for them.|$|E
5|$|Mogador was {{refitted}} at Lorient between January and March 1940 and {{a number}} of minor changes were made.

5|$|No {{members of}} the Leader class survived the 1950s and only the numberplates of No. 36001 and No. 36002 are known to exist. The numberplate for No. 36001 {{is located in the}} National Railway Museum, {{although}} a locomotive builder's plate intended for the locomotive, but never <b>fitted</b> <b>in</b> service, was sold at auction in 2008. The Leader was a bold attempt at pushing back the boundaries of contemporary steam locomotive design and, if successful, would have prolonged the life of steam on Britain's Railways.|$|E

5|$|Some {{minor works}} {{took place during}} the {{remainder}} of the 19th century and continued into the early 20th century. During the 1930s further maintenance work followed that included a new roof to protect the vaulted ceiling of the south choir aisle. From 1960 onwards the crumbling sandstone blocks were replaced and new windows were <b>fitted</b> <b>in</b> the chapterhouse, which was re-roofed to preserve its vaulted ceiling. From 1988 to 2000, the two western towers were substantially overhauled with a viewing platform provided {{at the top of the}} north tower.|$|E
5|$|The first Soviet ship {{to carry}} a radar was Molotov which was given a Redut-K air warning system in 1940, which she used for the entire war. Lend-Lease radars {{equipped}} {{most of the other}} ships. The British Types 281, 291 and the American SG radars were used for air search. Main battery fire control radars were the British Types 284 and 285 while anti-aircraft fire control was provided by the Type 282 radar. Soviet-designed Yupiter-1 and Mars-1 gunnery radars were <b>fitted</b> <b>in</b> Molotov and Kalinin by 1944.|$|E
