Much later, Nigel Heseltine introduced a new theory—that his father had been murdered by van Dieren, the sole beneficiary of Heseltine's 1920 will, which stood to be revoked by the new one. This theory is not considered tenable by most commentators.|$|E

After discussion culminating in the Malaysia Agreement and 20-point agreement, on 16 September 1963 North Borneo (as Sabah) was united with Malaya, Sarawak and Singapore, to form the independent Federation of Malaysia.|$|E
5|$|Previous authors (Kristjánsson cites Joel Feinberg, Alan Wertheimer and Robert Nozick) {{provided}} {{moral and}} statistical analyses of various thought experiments to <b>determine</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> proposals they involve are threats or offers. On Kristjánsson's account, by contrast, {{all of the}} thought experiments considered are throffers. Instead, he argues, the previous thinkers' analyses attempted to differentiate offers that limit freedom from those that do not. They conflate two tasks, that of differentiating threats and offers and that of differentiating freedom-restricting threats from non-freedom-restricting threats. He concludes that the thinkers' methods are also inadequate for determining the difference between freedom-restricting and non-freedom-restricting threats, for which a test of moral responsibility would be required.|$|E

5|$|Tham Chee Ho contends that, {{based on}} the {{objective}} test set out in Chng Suan Tze, the fear that the courts will take over responsibility for national security matters is misplaced.

The Court of Appeal in Chng Suan Tze reflected this by holding that what was required to preserve national security was a matter solely for executive judgment.|$|E
