5|$|MS 24 heads east into Liberty and intersects the {{southern}} terminus of MS 567. The highway passes commercial development {{and comes to}} an intersection with MS 48/MS 569. At this intersection, MS 48/MS 569 turn east to join MS 24 on Main Street and the road runs through the commercial downtown of Liberty. The portion of MS 24 which continues east from this point until it reaches McComb has been designated as Jerry Clower highway by Mississippi state statute 65-3-71.23. The highway intersects the western terminus of MS 584 immediately before MS 569 splits <b>from</b> <b>MS</b> 24/MS 48 by heading to the north. Following this, MS 24/MS 48 passes through more residential areas with some businesses before leaving Liberty. The road becomes unnamed and heads through a mix of farmland and woodland with occasional development, where it curves northeast. The highway continues through rural areas for several miles and {{turns back to the}} east. MS 24/MS 48 enters Pike County and passes through more farmland and forests. MS 48 splits <b>from</b> <b>MS</b> 24 by heading to the south. MS 24 continues through rural areas with some businesses before ending at a cloverleaf interchange with I-55/US 98 west of McComb. At this point, the roadway continues east into McComb as part of US 98.|$|E
5|$|MS 572 was {{designated}} in 1957, connecting <b>from</b> <b>MS</b> 24/33 to MS 569. The route was fully paved {{when it was}} created. The next year, it was extended slightly to Centreville.

The two highways continue southeast into Tylertown, curving east into residential areas. The road heads into the commercial downtown and comes to an intersection with MS 27. The highway passes more businesses before leaving the downtown and heading into wooded areas with some homes. MS 48 splits <b>from</b> <b>MS</b> 198 by heading southeast, with MS 198 continuing east past residences and commercial establishments on Old Highway 98 East.

25|$|ADEM's {{symptoms}} {{resemble the}} symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS), so the disease itself is sorted into the classification of the multiple sclerosis borderline diseases.

ADEM consists of a single flare-up whereas MS is marked with several flare-ups (or relapses), {{over a long period}} of time. Relapses following ADEM are reported in up to a quarter of patients, but the majority of these 'multiphasic' presentations following ADEM likely represent MS. ADEM is also distinguished by a loss of consciousness, coma and death, which is very rare in MS, except in severe cases.|$|E
