25|$|At {{the same}} time, {{the number of}} <b>international</b> <b>divorces</b> in Japan is also {{increasing}} from 7,716 in 1992 to 18,220 in 2007. <b>International</b> <b>divorces</b> represent 7.15% of the total 254,832 divorces in Japan in 2007. Moreover, according to a 2007 figure, 10.53% of people under 20 experience the divorce of their parents. In 1990, the rate was 5.24%. In numerical terms, 245,685 under-20 year olds, had experienced the divorce of their parents, compared to 169,624 in 1990. In July 2008, Thierry Consigny of the Assembly for French Overseas Nationals (AFE) for Japan and North Asia, which has been advocating for right of foreign parents in Japan, further asserted that, according to a government survey, every year 166,000 children are separated from one of their parents in Japan following a divorce or separation, usually definitively. Furthermore, 10,000 or more children of dual nationality fall into this situation as well. Foreign parents face an additional obstacle in maintaining access due to their immigration status which may be revoked after a divorce.|$|R

5000|$|Divorce {{by mutual}} consent is a simple process of {{submitting}} a declaration to the relevant government office that says both spouses agree to divorce. This form is often called the [...] "Green Form" [...] due to the wide green band across the top. If both parties fail to reach agreement on conditions of a Divorce By Mutual Consent, such as child custody which must be specified on the divorce form, then they must {{use one of the}} other three types of divorce. Foreign divorces may also be registered in Japan by bringing the appropriate court documents to the local city hall along with a copy of the Family Registration of the Japanese ex-spouse. If an <b>international</b> <b>divorce</b> includes joint custody of the children, it is important to the foreign parent to register it themselves, because joint custody is not legal in Japan. The parent to register the divorce may thus be granted sole custody of the child according to Japanese law.|$|E
5000|$|The {{convention}} {{has only}} been ratified by three states (France, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands) and signed by another two (Austria and Portugal). [...] As such, <b>international</b> <b>divorce</b> cases that take place outside of {{the authority of the}} convention are not clear-cut. For instance, questions arise when assets are held in trust in a country that neither spouse has an actual connection to through residence or nationality and neither the state in which the trust is located nor the state in which suit is brought (the state of nationality or residence) {{is a member of the}} Convention. Some courts have found ways around the jurisdictional issue at hand (i.e. that they have no jurisdiction in another country) especially if the assets are marital and under the control of only one spouse. Such was the case in the New York case of Riechers v. Riechers. In this case the husband had used marital assets to fund a Cook Islands trust; even though the New York court had no jurisdiction over the trust money, they ordered the wife’s share of that money paid from other assets.|$|E
50|$|Divorce by Mutual Consent in Japan {{differs from}} divorce {{in many other}} countries, causing it to not be {{recognized}} by all countries. It {{does not require the}} oversight by courts intended in many countries to ensure an equitable dissolution to both parties. Further, it is not always possible to verify the identity of the non Japanese spouse {{in the case of an}} <b>international</b> <b>divorce.</b> This is due to two facts. First, both spouses do not have to be present when submitting the divorce form to the government office. Second, a Japanese citizen must authorize the divorce form using a personal stamp (hanko), and Japan has a legal mechanism for registration of personal stamps. On the other hand, a non-Japanese citizen can authorize the divorce form with a signature. But there is no such legal registry for signatures, making forgery of the signature of a non-Japanese spouse difficult to prevent at best, and impossible to prevent without foresight. The only defense against such forgery is, before the forgery occurs, to submit another form to prevent a divorce form from being legally accepted by the government office at all. This form must be renewed every six months.|$|E

On the other hand, Colin Jones of Doshisha University, while accepting that domestic abuse defense in the convention is inadequate, nevertheless argued that if Japan signed the convention, abducting mothers would more than likely resort to this defense successfully to avoid their children being returned because Japanese family court is heavily biased in favor of the mother.|$|R

The regulation provides citizens with appropriate outcomes in terms of legal certainty, predictability and flexibility, protects weaker partners during divorce disputes and prevents 'forum shopping'. This also helps avoiding complicated, lengthy and painful proceedings. More specifically, it allows international couples to agree in advance which law would apply to their divorce or legal separation as long as the agreed law is the law of the Member State which they have a closer connection with. In case the couple cannot agree, the judges can use a common formula for deciding which country's law applies. This paper will bring to light some risks and coordination difficulties with the regulation and a few matters that the regulation does not apply to...|$|E
40|$|The {{variety and}} {{complexity}} of the legal issues that can confront a French court in an <b>international</b> <b>divorce</b> action may best be illustrated by a description of the basic factual pattern of, and the initial arguments advanced in, some of the more typical cases: French National Spouse v. Foreign National Spouse The Validity of a Prior Foreign Divorce Decree Foreign National Spouses With Immigrant Status in France Spouses of Foreign Nationality with Domiciliary Status in France Although disparate, the facts of these four hypothetical cases point to and are unified by two salient legal issues: one jurisdictional in nature and the other pertaining to a choice of law determination. Firstly, as a preliminary matter, the party opposing the divorce almost invariably raises a jurisdictional objection, alleging that by virtue of foreign nationality and/or domicile, the French courts lack jurisdiction to hear the matter. Secondly, in the event that the jurisdictional objection is unsuccessful, the party advances a choice of law argument, requiring the court to apply a set of choice of law rules to determine whether French or foreign law will govern the merits of the proceeding. The new Art. 310 was enacted as part of the law of 11 July 1975 which substantially modified existing French divorce law...|$|E

40|$|International child abductors often escape {{domestic}} {{law enforcement and}} disappear without consequence or resolution. International child abductions occur too frequently; in the United States alone, {{the number of children}} abducted abroad every year has risen to over 1, 000. Currently, 11, 000 American children live abroad with their abductors. These abductions occur despite international treaties and the Congressional resolutions that have significantly stiffened the penalties for those caught. Effectively combating international child abductions requires drafting resolutions that are acceptable across the diverse societies and cultures of the international community. Without such resolutions to fill the gaps of current treaties this problem will continue and the suffering endured by children being uprooted and hidden from one of their parents will continue. The rise in both <b>international</b> marriages and <b>divorce</b> rates along with increased ease of travel has correlated with the rise in child abductions. Statistics from the Missing Children’s Registry show that abductions by parents are five times greater than by strangers. The Justice Department reported that of the 358, 700 children abducted in the U. S. each year 354, 100 were abducted by one of their parents. Law enforcement agencies’ reluctance to get involved in international child abductions, though understandable, is regrettable as it leaves the vast resources of these agencies off limits to left-behind parents. The cost of locating an international child abductor is very high, especially for a third world nation with strapped resources struggling to adequately combat “local murders, inner city crime and ‘real’ kidnappings. ” Finding ways to offset resource utilization and for participation of these crucial nations is necessary for more effectively combating international child abductions...|$|R
40|$|The {{increase}} in separation and divorce rates during the 20 th century {{brought with it}} many far-reaching social implications for all involved, sparking {{a high level of}} interest among researchers. Most research in this area has been approached from stress frameworks that have conceptualised separation and divorce as a stressful life transition that individuals must adjust to. Yet, attempts to understand separation and divorce to date have been dominated by quantitative methods that have resulted in a relatively static and objective understanding of this experience; particularly in Australia. Furthermore, although <b>international</b> rates of <b>divorce</b> are declining, rates of separation following cohabiting unions are increasing. However, research continues to neglect the voices of formerly cohabiting individuals. Using a qualitative methodology, the current study sought to explore the experience of separation from the perspectives of both formerly married and cohabiting parents in Australia to learn more about how they adjust following this stressful life event. The term ‘separated’ was used to denote relationship dissolution to ensure adequate representation of both formerly married and cohabiting parents. This study was embedded within an interpretivist paradigm and was guided by a phenomenological qualitative methodology. Using Moustakas’ (1994) systematic phenomenological research method, in-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with 55 separated parents ranging in age from 23 to 56 years. Thirty-four parents were formerly married and the remaining 21 were part of cohabiting unions. Of the 25 mothers who participated in the current study, 11 were residential, 5 were non-residential and 9 were shared care parents. Of the 30 fathers involved in the current study, 9 were residential, 11 were non-residential and 10 were shared care parents. Exploration of experiences of the six groups of parents allowed for more robust and rich data. Phenomenological data analysis guided by Moustakas (1994) was used to understand and interpret interview transcripts. Data analyses identified five major themes and related sub-themes that captured the experience of separation and the factors associated with adjustment: uncoupling (including sub-themes of psychological health, family stress, infidelity, and drifting apart); uncoupled (including sub-themes of co-parenting, the economic struggle, loss and loneliness, identity: assumed and assigned, and psychological, emotional, and physical health problems); searching within the self (including sub-themes of personal control, selfregulation, optimism, and healthy living); reaching beyond the self (including sub-themes of connectedness, social support and reaching out, positive employment, constructive coparenting, the parent – child relationship, and loving again); and patterns of adjustment (including sub-themes of the rollercoaster, the ‘time’ factor, and the protective nature of separation). Collectively, findings revealed that the Australian experience of separation began prior to separation and was constantly changing over time. Formerly married and cohabiting parents’ experiences were imbued with stressors frequently identified in research that has adopted dominant stress frameworks, along with numerous personal and environmental resources that lessened the impact of stressors and assisted adjustment following separation. A framework that represents the experience of separation and the factors associated with adjustment was developed based on these five themes. Findings support an understanding of adjustment following separation and divorce that advocates for a paradigm shift away from objective conceptualisations of this experience, towards an understanding of this experience as it is perceived by those who have been through it. Therefore, to only attend to static and objective conceptualisations of separation and divorce as they are experienced by formerly married individuals would be to overlook significant psychological and social elements of the separation and divorce experience. Further research is encouraged with a specific focus on gender, residential status and marital status...|$|R
