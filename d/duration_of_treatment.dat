40|$|BACKGROUND: Lithium can {{influence}} calcium homeostasis resulting in changes in parathormone set point and renal calcium handling. The clinical {{significance of these}} changes in older patients is unknown. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the possible association between <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> lithium <b>treatment</b> and corrected calcium, parathormone and 24 -h urinary calcium excretion in older psychiatric patients corrected for renal function and vitamin 25 OH D and also to estimate the point prevalence of hypercalcemia and raised parathormone. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of psychiatric outpatients visiting a specialized facility for older patients treated with lithium was performed. Patients underwent a comprehensive assessment and blood and urine testing. Potential confounders of calcium homeostasis were recorded. On the basis <b>of</b> the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> lithium <b>treatment,</b> patients were divided into four groups. RESULTS: One hundred eleven patients were included, mean age 75. 2 years. There was no significant association between the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> lithium <b>treatment</b> and corrected calcium, parathormone and 24 -h urinary calcium excretion. The point prevalence of hypercalcemia was 2. 7 % and 47. 8 % for raised parathormone. There was an unexpected but significant negative association between the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> lithium <b>treatment</b> and vitamin 25 OH D, with 76. 9 % vitamin 25 OH D deficiency (< 50 nmol/L) in the group using lithium for more than 10 years. CONCLUSIONS: No association was found between <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> lithium <b>treatment</b> and calcium parameters in older psychiatric outpatients, but there was a high prevalence of raised parathormone and an unexpected negative association between <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> lithium <b>treatment</b> and 25 OH D...|$|R

25|$|The mode {{of action}} of olanzapine's {{antipsychotic}} activity is unknown. It may involve antagonism of dopamine and serotonin receptors. Antagonism of dopamine receptors is associated with extrapyramidal effects such as tardive dyskinesia (TD), and with therapeutic effects. Antagonism of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors is associated with anticholinergic side effects such as dry mouth and constipation, in addition it may suppress or reduce the emergence of extrapyramidal effects for the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>treatment,</b> however it offers no protection against the development of tardive dyskinesia. In common with other second generation (atypical) antipsychotics, olanzapine poses a relatively low risk of extrapyramidal side effects including TD, due to its high affinity for the D1 receptor over the D2 receptor.|$|E

40|$|Background: End-stage {{renal disease}} {{is a state of}} {{enhanced}} oxidative stress (OS) and hemodialysis (HD) and renal anemia further augment this disbalance. Anemia correction with erythropoietin (EPO) may improve oxidative status. However, {{there is no evidence of}} time dependent effects of EPO therapy on redox status of HD patients. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> EPO <b>treatment</b> may affect OS parameters in uremic patients. Patients and methods: 104 HD patients and 29 healthy volunteers were included. Patients were divided into 3 groups according to the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> EPO <b>treatment.</b> Forth group consisted of HD patients without EPO treatment. Plasma and erythrocyte malondialdehyde (MDA, MDA rbc), reactive carbonyl groups (RCG), plasma sulfhydryl (-SH) groups and total antioxidative capacity (TAC) levels were evaluated. Results: HD patients both with and without EPO treatment, showed a significant increase in all oxidative parameters without significance between EPO treated and -untreated group. The decrease in MDA and MDA rbc levels coincided with the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> EPO <b>treatment.</b> A negative correlation was observed between the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> EPO <b>treatment</b> and serum MDA (r=&# 727; 0. 309, p= 0. 003).

2500|$|The {{treatment}} of choice for S. aureus infection is penicillin. An antibiotic derived from some Penicillium fungal species, penicillin inhibits the formation of peptidoglycan cross-linkages that provide the rigidity and strength in a bacterial cell wall. The four-membered β-lactam ring of penicillin is bound to enzyme DD-transpeptidase, an enzyme that when functional, cross-links chains of peptidoglycan that form bacterial cell walls. The binding of β-lactam to DD-transpeptidase inhibits the enzyme’s functionality and {{it can no longer}} catalyze the formation of the cross-links. As a result, cell wall formation and degradation are imbalanced, thus resulting in cell death. In most countries, however, penicillin resistance is extremely common, and first-line therapy is most commonly a penicillinase-resistant β-lactam antibiotic (for example, oxacillin or flucloxacillin, both of which have the same mechanism of action as penicillin). [...] Combination therapy with gentamicin may be used to treat serious infections, such as endocarditis, but its use is controversial because of the high risk of damage to the kidneys.

40|$|Background. There {{has been}} no {{systematic}} evaluation of outcome after surgery for infective endocarditis with respect to <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> antibiotic <b>treatment.</b> Methods. We performed a retrospective chart review of episodes of valve surgery for active infective endocarditis at Green Lane Hospital (Auckland, New Zealand) for 1963 – 1999. We recorded the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> antibiotic <b>treatment</b> before and after valve surgery; the extent of infection at operation; Gram stain, culture, and histopathological testing results for valve samples; and the bacteriological outcome after surgery. The primary outcome measure was relapse, defined as endocarditis due to the same species within 1 year after surgery. Results. For the 358 patients in our study, the median <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> follow-up was 4. 8 years. Thirty-two patients (9 %) had 36 subsequent episodes of endocarditis. Relapse occurred after 3 (0. 8 %) of the operations (95 % CI, 0. 2 %– 2. 0 %). Relapse of infection was unrelated to the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> antibiotic <b>treatment</b> before or after surgery, positive valve culture results, positive Gram stain results, or perivalvular infection.
