40|$|Data centers use {{large numbers}} of <b>hard</b> <b>drives</b> as data storage devices {{and it is an}} {{increasing}} challenge to maintain the reliability of the storage system as the number of the <b>hard</b> <b>drives</b> increases exponentially. Manual monitoring {{does not seem to be}} efficient for large scale storage systems. Typically, the distributions of healthy <b>hard</b> <b>drives</b> and failed <b>hard</b> <b>drives</b> are highly imbalance. In addition, the size of the training data is large for large scale storage systems. The existence of such challenges makes the <b>hard</b> <b>drive</b> failure prediction problem interesting. In this thesis, several classification models are applied to the <b>hard</b> <b>drive</b> S. M. A. R.

50|$|Hot swapping: using a {{computer}} to change the data on the <b>hard</b> <b>drive.</b> This requires having the Xbox unlock the <b>hard</b> <b>drive</b> when it is turned on, then swapping the powered <b>hard</b> <b>drive</b> into a running computer.

50|$|Advantages include lower power {{consumption}} than standard RAID levels, {{the ability to}} use multiple <b>hard</b> <b>drives</b> with differing sizes to their full capacity and in the event of multiple concurrent <b>hard</b> <b>drive</b> failures (exceeding the redundancy), only losing the data stored on the failed <b>hard</b> <b>drives</b> compared to standard RAID levels which offer striping in which case all of the data on the array is lost when more <b>hard</b> <b>drives</b> fail than the redundancy can handle.|$|R

We explore this significance through reluctances to dispose of USB portable <b>hard</b> <b>drives,</b> partly for environmental reasons, but also because of concerns over the data stored on them. In direct tension to these concerns is an ephemeral sense of ownership, where USB portable <b>hard</b> <b>drives</b> are always disposable from the moment of acquisition.

50|$|The Quantum Bigfoot brand was {{a series}} of <b>hard</b> disk <b>drives</b> {{produced}} by Quantum Corp. from 1996 through the late 1990s. The Bigfoot series was notable for deviating from the standard form factor for <b>hard</b> <b>drives.</b> While most desktop <b>hard</b> <b>drives</b> at that time used a 3.5-inch physical format, Quantum Bigfoot drives used a larger 5.25-inch form factor more commonly seen in older <b>hard</b> <b>drives,</b> CD-ROM and other optical disc drives. This form factor allowed Quantum to increase the capacity of their <b>hard</b> <b>drives</b> without an increase in data density, thus lowering costs compared to a 3.5-inch drive with the same capacity. It also allowed manufacturers and owners to install the <b>hard</b> <b>drive</b> above or below the optical drive in the computer, as the typical computer had multiple 5.25-inch bays.|$|R
