I became friends with him when I was young. And his persona <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>strong.</b> If I were {{to look back and}} see his impact on my life, it’s been tremendous.|$|E
5|$|The local bedrock {{is a hard}} red sandstone, {{which the}} {{inhabitants}} used {{in the construction of}} monuments and architecture. This local sandstone <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>strong</b> and not prone to shearing or fracturing, allowing the sculptors at Quiriguá to erect the tallest freestanding stone monuments in the Americas. Quiriguá was built directly over the Motagua Fault and the city suffered damage in ancient times as a result of major earthquakes.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{his power}} advantage, Woods has always focused on {{developing}} an excellent all-around game. Although {{in recent years}} he has typically been {{near the bottom of}} the Tour rankings in driving accuracy, his iron play is generally accurate, his recovery and bunker play <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>strong,</b> and his putting (especially under pressure) is possibly his greatest asset. He is largely responsible for a shift to higher standards of athleticism amongst professional golfers, and is known for utilizing more hours of practice than most.|$|E

5|$|The {{practical}} construction {{given by}} the state of New York to the federal constitution, as shown by the numerous treaties made by it with the Indian tribes, and the recognition by the federal authority of their validity, <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>strong</b> evidence that the clause in the federal constitution prohibiting the states from entering into treaties does not preclude a state, having the preemption right to Indian lands, from dealing with the Indian tribes directly, for the extinguishment of the Indian title.|$|E
5|$|There <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>strong</b> {{evidence}} that comets have previously been fragmented and collided with Jupiter and its satellites. During the Voyager missions to the planet, planetary scientists identified 13 crater chains on Callisto and three on Ganymede, {{the origin of}} which was initially a mystery. Crater chains seen on the Moon often radiate from large craters, and {{are thought to be}} caused by secondary impacts of the original ejecta, but the chains on the Jovian moons did not lead back to a larger crater. The impact of SL9 strongly implied that the chains were due to trains of disrupted cometary fragments crashing into the satellites.|$|E

25|$|Solovay {{has shown}} the precise {{equivalence}} in consistency strength of NFUB = NFU + Infinity + Cantorian Sets + Small Ordinals with Morse–Kelley set theory plus the assertion that the proper class ordinal (the class of all ordinals) is a weakly compact cardinal. This <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>strong</b> indeed! Moreover, NFUB-, which is NFUB with Cantorian Sets omitted, is easily seen {{to have the same}} strength as NFUB.|$|E
25|$|As {{discussed}} above, concrete <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>strong</b> in compression, but weak in tension. Larger earthquakes {{can generate}} very large shear loads on structures. These shear loads subject the structure to both tensile and compressional loads. Concrete structures without reinforcement, like other unreinforced masonry structures, can fail during severe earthquake shaking. Unreinforced masonry structures constitute {{one of the}} largest earthquake risks globally. These risks can be reduced through seismic retrofitting of at-risk buildings, (e.g. school buildings in Istanbul, Turkey).|$|E

25|$|In 1922, a major {{documentary}} film, Independence, the İzmir Victory, {{was made}} about the Turkish War of Independence. That same year, the first private movie studio, Kemal Film, commenced operations. From 1923 to 1939, Muhsin Ertugrul was the only active film director in the country. He directed 29 films during this period, generally incorporating adaptions of plays, operettas, fiction and foreign films. The influence of the theater dating back to Uzkinay, Simavi, Ahmet Fehim and Şadi Karagozoglu <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>strong</b> in Ertugrul's work.|$|E
25|$|The hickories as a {{group are}} classed as {{intermediate}} in shade tolerance; however, pignut hickory has been classed as intolerant in the Northeast and tolerant in the Southeast. In much of the area covered by mixed oak forests, shade-tolerant hardwoods (including the hickories) are climax, and the trend of succession toward this climax <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>strong.</b> Although most silvicultural systems when applied to oak types will maintain a hardwood forest, the cutting methods used affects the rapidity with which other species may replace the oaks and hickories (17,18,26).|$|E

25|$|Although Hyenas lack perineal scent glands, {{they have}} a large pouch of naked skin located at the anal opening. Large anal glands above the anus open into this pouch. Several sebaceous glands are present between the {{openings}} of the anal glands and above them. These glands produce a white, creamy secretion that the hyenas paste onto grass stalks. The odour of this secretion <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>strong,</b> smelling of boiling cheap soap or burning, and can be detected by humans several metres downwind. The secretions are primarily used for territorial marking, though both the aardwolf and the striped hyena will spray them when attacked.|$|E
