5|$|Seeing {{himself as}} the heir to Chibás, Castro wanted to run for Congress in the June 1952 elections. Senior Ortodoxo members feared his radical {{reputation}} and refused to nominate him; instead he was nominated {{as a candidate for}} the House of Representatives by party members in Havana's poorest districts, and began campaigning.

5|$|Castro co-founded a legal {{partnership}} that primarily catered for poor Cubans, although it proved a financial failure. Caring little for money or material goods, Castro {{failed to pay}} his bills; his furniture was repossessed and electricity cut off, distressing his wife. He {{took part in a}} high-school protest in Cienfuegos in November 1950, fighting with police in protest at the Education Ministry's ban on student associations; arrested and charged for violent conduct, the magistrate dismissed the charges. His hopes for Cuba still centered on Chibás and the Partido Ortodoxo, and he was present at Chibás' politically motivated suicide in 1951. Seeing himself as Chibás' heir, Castro wanted to run for Congress in the June 1952 elections, though senior Ortodoxo members feared his radical reputation and refused to nominate him. Instead he was nominated as a candidate for the House of Representatives by party members in Havana's poorest districts, and began campaigning.

Zali Steggall, who months earlier {{had become the}} first Australian woman to win a World Cup event and was ranked sixth in the world, won the country's first individual medal with a bronze in slalom skiing. Her time of 1m 32.67s was only 0.27s behind the gold medallist. Marshall, the world champion in 1997 and 1999, and Jacqui Cooper—ranked second in the world—were expected to <b>do</b> <b>well</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> aerials, but both crashed and {{failed to make the}} final.

25|$|While conceiving {{and writing}} the first series in 2012, Broadchurch creator and lead writer Chris Chibnall {{designed}} {{his story to}} be told as a trilogy. Series one was written to work both as {{the first part of}} this trilogy as well as a self-contained drama. The first series had to be self-contained, he felt, in case the show did not <b>do</b> <b>well</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ratings and a second series was not commissioned. When Chibnall pitched series one to ITV in the autumn of 2012, he also pitched series two and three at the same time.|$|E

Having retained his British pursuit title, {{he was expected to}} <b>do</b> <b>well</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> prologue time trial – and finished seventh of 120 starters. However, an injury returned and he abandoned on the third stage – a retirement that allowed him to concentrate on the world championship in Rome in late August.|$|E
25|$|Chibnall {{wrote the}} script for Broadchurch on spec after his work on Camelot ended. Chibnall had a very unhappy {{experience}} working on Camelot, and fell ill with pneumonia after leaving the show. While taking time off to recover, he began using whiteboards in May 2011 to create backgrounds for each character and craft the plot of Broadchurch—which he envisioned as being a trilogy. Series one was written to work both as {{the first part of}} a trilogy as well as a self-contained drama. The first series had to be self-contained, he felt, in case the show did not <b>do</b> <b>well</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ratings and a second series was not commissioned.|$|E

25|$|A Scottish settler named Dr Andrew Turnbull transplanted around 1,500 indentured settlers, from Menorca, Majorca, Ibiza, Smyrna, Crete, Mani Peninsula, and Sicily, to grow hemp, sugarcane, indigo, and {{to produce}} rum. Settled at New Smyrna, within months the colony {{suffered}} major losses {{primarily due to}} insect-borne diseases and Native American raids. Most crops did not <b>do</b> <b>well</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sandy Florida soil. Those that survived rarely equaled the quality produced in other colonies. The colonists tired of their servitude and Turnbull's rule. On several occasions, he used African slaves to whip his unruly settlers. The settlement collapsed and the survivors fled to safety with the British authorities in St. Augustine. Their descendants survive to this day, as does the name New Smyrna.|$|E
25|$|Connecticut was a {{perennial}} powerhouse but {{after having a}} mediocre season, according to Greg Anthony, and finishing 9th in the Big East play. They were not expected to do much in the tournament. Aside from the poor regular season play, Connecticut was able to walk through their first three games without much struggle {{and was able to}} get wins over teams that were expected to <b>do</b> <b>well</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tournament. Behind the phenomenal play of Kemba Walker, who is now a star for the Charlotte Hornets in the NBA, he was able to put up a solid stat line. After those three games, they started playing teams that had potential to win the championship and Walker continued to show why {{he was one of the}} best players in the tournament.|$|E

Chibnall was assisted in this process by his good friends, Sam Hoyle (a television script executive) and television director James Strong. The series was influenced by two American television shows, Twin Peaks (created by Mark Frost and David Lynch) and Murder One (created by Steven Bochco, Charles H. Eglee, and Channing Gibson).|$|E
