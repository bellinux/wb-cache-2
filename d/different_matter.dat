5|$|The album's release {{coincided with}} Jarre's first foreign tour. In 1981 the British Embassy gave Radio Beijing copies of Oxygène and Équinoxe, {{which became the}} first pieces of foreign music to be played on Chinese {{national}} radio in decades. The republic invited Jarre {{to become the first}} western musician to play there, with Les Concerts en Chine. The performances were scheduled to run from 18 October to 5 November 1981. The first, in Beijing, was initially attended mostly by officials, but before the concert began technicians realised that not enough power was available to supply the stage and auditorium. Chinese officials solved the problem by temporarily cutting power to the surrounding districts. The stadium was almost full when the concert began, but as Beijing's buses stopped running at about 10 o'clock, about half the audience left before it finished. To boost the audience attendance for the second night, Jarre and his production team purchased some of the concert tickets and gave them to children on the streets (Jarre originally wanted the concerts to be free, but the Chinese authorities decided to charge between £0.20 and £0.50 per ticket). The event was notable for its lack of audience involvement; the Chinese were apparently unmoved by both the music and the light show, and applause was muted. The second venue, in Shanghai, was a <b>different</b> <b>matter.</b> Jarre actively encouraged audience participation by stepping into the crowd, which became much more exuberant than that in Beijing. Recordings of the concerts, which featured one of Jarre's signature electronic instruments, the laser harp, were released as a double-disc LP in 1982.|$|E
25|$|One {{approach}} to resolving this problem {{relies on the}} fact that a living body is constantly losing old matter and gaining new matter. A five-year-old body consists of <b>different</b> <b>matter</b> than does the same person's seventy-year-old body. If the five-year-old body and the seventy-year-old body consist of <b>different</b> <b>matter,</b> then what makes them the same body? The answer is presumably the soul. Because the five-year-old body and the seventy-year-old body share a soul—that is, the person's life—we can identify them both as the body. Apart from the soul, we cannot identify what collection of matter is the body. Therefore, a person's body is no longer that person's body after it dies.|$|E

On the 25th, they were halted by the fresh PAVN troops that had manned the hilltop, and stalemated.|$|E
25|$|The {{stability}} of the electrons in an atom itself is unrelated to the exclusion principle, but is described by the quantum theory of the atom. The underlying idea is that close approach of an electron to {{the nucleus of the}} atom necessarily increases its kinetic energy, an application of the uncertainty principle of Heisenberg. However, {{stability of}} large systems with many electrons and many nucleons is a <b>different</b> <b>matter,</b> and requires the Pauli exclusion principle.|$|E

25|$|His latter {{campaigns in}} the Balkans were aimed {{not so much}} at conquest and subjugation as at drawing the Serbs, Bosnians, Wallachians and Bulgarians into the fold of the Roman Catholic faith and at forming a united front against the Turks. It was {{relatively}} easy to subdue the Balkan Orthodox countries by arms, but to convert them was a <b>different</b> <b>matter.</b> Despite Louis' efforts, {{the peoples of the}} Balkans remained faithful to the Eastern Orthodox Church and their attitude toward Hungary remained ambiguous. Louis annexed Moldavia in 1352 and established a vassal principality there, before conquering Vidin in 1365. The rulers of Serbia, Walachia, Moldavia, and Bulgaria became his vassals. They regarded powerful Hungary as a potential menace to their national identity. For this reason, Hungary could never regard the Serbs and Wallachians as reliable allies in subsequent wars against the Turks.|$|E

25|$|Most of {{the circles}} are of fairly modest {{dimensions}} and Burl has theorised {{that they could}} have been constructed by a single family. Transporting the massive recumbents was a <b>different</b> <b>matter,</b> however; the fifty-ton recumbent at Old Keig was transported from six miles away and may have needed up to 200 people to drag it to its final resting place. The circle at Strichen provided a unique opportunity to test how the recumbents might have been transported. It was incorrectly restored in the 19th century by Lord Lovat, so between 1979–83 it was fully excavated and correctly restored by a team led by Burl, Ian Hampsher-Monk and Philip Abramson. The restoration required the team to move some of the stones, and {{it was found that the}} most efficient non-mechanical means of doing so was to use drag the stones along a slippery path of wet straw using logs as a kind of sledge.|$|E
500|$|Shooting of Sanshiro Sugata {{began on}} {{location}} in Yokohama in December 1942. Production proceeded smoothly, but getting the completed film past the censors was an entirely <b>different</b> <b>matter.</b> The censorship office considered the work to be objectionably [...] "British-American" [...] {{by the standards of}} wartime Japan, and it was only through the intervention of director Yasujirō Ozu, who championed the film, that Sanshiro Sugata was finally accepted for release on March 25, 1943. (Kurosawa had just turned 33.) The movie became both a critical and commercial success. Nevertheless, the censorship office would later decide to cut out some 18 minutes of footage, much of which is now considered lost.|$|E
500|$|The lyrical style varies {{depending}} on culture, denomination, and country. For example, in Northern Europe the bands with Lutheran members usually prefer a personal lyrical approach, which is seldom meant to [...] "convert" [...] in an aggressive manner, since evangelism has been more typical among American bands. Christian bands never deny their conviction but typically avoid preaching, and sometimes the matter is left unexpressed, leaving religion as a private issue of the listener. Certain bands choose to deal with everyday life experiences from a Christian perspective in order to draw both Christian and non-Christian listeners. In such cases, identifying a [...] "Christian band" [...] can be difficult. Secular bands that occasionally deal with Christian topics are a <b>different</b> <b>matter</b> altogether. Defining a Christian band is a much debated issue on Christian metal forums. A Christian band {{is expected to have}} either professed Christian members or a Christian message, preferably both.|$|E

500|$|Shortly after, the Parents Television Council (PTC) {{threatened}} to file indecency complaints with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) against any station that played the song between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. PTC President Tim Winter said [...] "there is no misinterpreting {{the lyrics to}} this song, and it's certainly not about a girl named Amy. It's one thing for a song with these lyrics to be included on a CD so that fans who wish to hear it can do so, but it's an entirely <b>different</b> <b>matter</b> when this song is played over the publicly owned airwaves, especially {{at a time when}} children are likely to be in the listening audience." [...] RBR.com reported that [...] "interestingly, Circus was reviewed by Common Sense Media, another organization whose mission is to help parents manage their children's media consumption. It rated it appropriate for age 13 and up, but made no specific mention of 'If U Seek Amy'.
