Simons' book was a temperate survey of American history from the age of discovery through Civil War reconstruction written through the prism of class struggle. Although Simons professed that he was writing as a Marxist, the tone and content of the work was so moderate that some reviewers did not <b>even</b> <b>recognize</b> the book as a socialist document.|$|E

500|$|The character's main love {{interest}} throughout his duration on {{the soap opera}} was Ashley Abbott (Eileen Davidson), whom he married in 2011. Nichols had previously stated {{in an interview that}} he thought Tucker would [...] "definitely 'team up' when he finds the right woman". Davidson stated in an interview that the pair will [...] "have their ups and downs, but they're definitely in each other's lives." [...] In September 2011, it is revealed that Tucker is the biological father of Devon Hamilton (Bryton James), the result of a long-ago affair with Harmony Hamilton (Debbi Morgan). When asked of Tucker's reaction to the news, Morgan stated: [...] "It's revealed that Devon was the result of a one-night stand between Harmony and Tucker. That night meant the world to her—Tucker was the love of her life—but it meant so little to him that he doesn't <b>even</b> <b>recognize</b> Harmony when they meet again. Not a clue! It's like a dagger through her heart." [...] James said he was [...] "overjoyed" [...] at the revelation, stating: [...] "There's so much they can do with this story. The relationship between Tucker and Devon—my character allowing that relationship to grow. How it affects Neil. And there's a plethora of possibilities that can come from his relationship with Mrs. Chancellor. I'm sure that relationship will develop just as it will with Devon and Tucker. And then, there's Devon's mother, Harmony, who is back." [...] Tucker and Ashley's marriage ended the following year, after he cheated on her with Harmony. Following their divorce, Nichols stated in an interview with Xfinity that Tucker would [...] "have to find a new woman" [...] as he [...] "can't be without female companionship".|$|E

It is actually Alternate World Leena who follows Serge for much of the game; the Home World Leena only initiates the search for jewelry that set the events of the entire game in motion, otherwise staying behind. The Alternate World Leena joins Serge if the player chooses to reject Kid's first offer to travel with Serge early in the game, Leena not chasing after him if another girl is with him already.|$|E

2500|$|Judaism {{affirms that}} people are born with both a yetzer ha-tov (יצר הטוב), an {{inclination}} or impulse to do good, and with a yetzer hara (יצר הרע), an inclination or impulse to do evil. These phrases reflect the concept that [...] "within each person, there are opposing natures continually in conflict" [...] and are referenced {{many times in the}} rabbinic tradition. The rabbis <b>even</b> <b>recognize</b> a positive value to the yetzer ha-ra: without the yetzer ha-ra there would be no civilization or other fruits of human labor. Midrash (Bereshit Rabbah 9:7) states: [...] "Without the evil inclination, no one would father a child, build a house, or make a career." [...] The implication is that yetzer ha-tov and yetzer ha-ra are best understood not only as moral categories of good and evil but as the inherent conflict within man between selfless and selfish orientations.|$|E
2500|$|The band {{themselves}} {{were far from}} happy with the album and upon its release, were vocal in press interviews about their dissatisfaction.

[...] Gene Parsons disowned the album completely, describing it as [...] "Melcher's folly" [...] and commenting in interviews that the band were all appalled by what they heard when they returned from touring. [...] McGuinn actually defended Melcher somewhat by indicating {{in an interview with the}} English journalist Keith Altham that the album had been taken away from the producer at the last minute and given to an engineer in San Francisco to remix. [...] However, the production credits on the original LP sleeve do not support McGuinn's claim and Melcher later stated that he had no recollection of the album being mixed by anyone other than himself. [...] In more recent years, McGuinn has conceded to journalist David Fricke that the album's shortcomings were not down to Melcher's over-production alone: [...] "We were just idling artistically, the album sounds like we really weren't concentrating on doing good work, good art." ...|$|E

60|$|As {{he paused}} a moment upon the brink of the well a faint sound came to him through the opening above.

Was he, after all, to be just a moment too late? Like a frightened deer he leaped across the narrow chasm to the continuation of the passage beyond.

60|$|But {{the thing}} said was {{thoroughly}} good, {{and the better}} because the opinion was addressed to men among whom the glory of arms was still in ascendant over the achievements of intellectual enterprise. The greatest men have been those who have stepped out from the mass, and gone beyond their time--seeing things, with eyesight almost divine, which have hitherto been hidden from the crowd. Such was Columbus {{when he made his}} way across the Western Ocean; such were Galileo and Bacon; such was Pythagoras, if the ideas we have of him be at all true. Such also was Cicero. It is not given to the age in which such men live to know them. Could their age <b>even</b> <b>recognize</b> them, they would not overstep their age as they do. Looking back at him now, we can see how like a Christian was the man--so like, that in essentials we can hardly see the difference. He could love another as himself--as nearly as a man may do; and he taught such love as a doctrine.[28] He believed in the existence of one supreme God.[29] He believed that man would rise again and live forever in some heaven.[30] I am conscious that I cannot much promote this view of Cicero's character by quoting isolated passages from his works--words which taken alone may be interpreted in one sense or another, and which should be read, each with its context, before their due meaning can be understood. But I may perhaps succeed in explaining to a reader what it is that I hope to do in the following pages, and why it is that I undertake a work which must be laborious, and for which many will think that there is no remaining need.|$|E
