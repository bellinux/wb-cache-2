25|$|On the {{afternoon}} of August 26, 1985, Petrelis returned to Hennessey’s office for removal of the stitches. Hennessey explained {{the results of the}} biopsy: the lesion was Kaposi’s sarcoma, an opportunistic infection. He told Petrelis he <b>had</b> <b>AIDS</b> and that more such opportunistic infections would follow. His prognosis was terminal, with {{six months to a year}} to live. Henley advised him to go to the Gay Men’s Health Crisis (GMHC) as soon as possible, draft a will, and find a doctor.|$|E
25|$|After his death, {{controversial}} Melbourne-based 3AW radio broadcaster Derryn Hinch {{alleged that}} Kennedy {{had died from}} an AIDS-related disease. This was strenuously denied by his friends and carers Noeline Brown and Tony Sattler, {{and as a result}} Kennedy's biographer Graeme Blundell then published Kennedy's medical records, including a recent negative HIV test, to disprove this allegation. Hinch fought back saying he didn't say Kennedy <b>had</b> <b>AIDS,</b> but that he was homosexual, had symptoms similar to those of Kaposi's Sarcoma, and died of pneumonia, thus implying Kennedy's death was AIDS-related.|$|E

25|$|On the {{afternoon}} of Friday, December 21, 1990, Schmalz had a seizure and collapsed working at his desk at The New York Times. By February, his doctors had determined Schmalz <b>had</b> <b>AIDS.</b> His T cell count was just two and he had progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a brain disease that is often fatal within months. He told his editors about his illness and took a health leave for about seven months. He responded well to AZT and returned to The New York Times just after Labor Day in 1991. He decided to cover the 1992 presidential campaign.|$|E
25|$|After Hudson {{revealed}} his diagnosis, a controversy arose concerning {{his participation in}} a scene in the television drama Dynasty in which he shared a long and repeated kiss with actress Linda Evans in one episode (first aired in February 1985). When filming the scene, Hudson was aware that he <b>had</b> <b>AIDS,</b> but did not inform Evans. Some felt {{that he should have}} disclosed his condition to her beforehand. At the time, it was thought that the virus was present in low quantities in saliva and tears, but there had been no reported cases of transmission by kissing. Nevertheless, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had warned against exchanging saliva with members of groups perceived to be at high risk for AIDS.|$|E
25|$|In June 2006, the Ministry of Health {{publicly}} {{admitted that}} more than 10,000 Saudi citizens were either infected with HIV or <b>had</b> <b>AIDS.</b> In December 2006 the Arab News ran an editorial that called for greater public awareness of how the virus is spread and more compassion for those people infected. In the same year, a Saudi citizen named Rami al-Harithi revealed that he had become infected with HIV while having surgery and has become an official proponent of education and showing compassion to those people infected. Saudi Princess Alia bint Abdullah {{has been involved in}} the Saudi AIDS Society, which was permitted in December 2006 to hold a public charity art auction followed by a discussion on how the disease was impacting the kingdom that included two Saudis living with HIV. The event was organized {{with the help of the}} Saudi National Program for Combating AIDS which is chaired by Dr. Sana Filimban.|$|E

25|$|HIV (human {{immunodeficiency}} virus) {{damages the}} body's immune system, which interferes with {{its ability to}} fight off disease-causing agents. The virus kills CD4 cells, which are white blood cells that help fight off various infections. HIV is carried in body fluids, and is spread by sexual activity. It can also be spread by contact with infected blood, breast feeding, childbirth, and from mother to child during pregnancy. When HIV is at its most advanced stage, an individual {{is said to have}} AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). There are different stages of the progression of and HIV infection. The stages include primary infection, asymptomatic infection, symptomatic infection, and AIDS. In the primary infection stage, an individual will have flu like symptoms (headache, fatigue, fever, muscle aches) for about 2 weeks. In the asymptomatic stage, symptoms usually disappear, and the patient can remain asymptomatic for years. When HIV progresses to the symptomatic stage, the immune system is weakened, and has a low cell count of CD4+ T Cells. When the HIV infection becomes life-threatening, it is called AIDS. People with AIDS fall prey to opportunistic infections and die as a result. When the disease was first discovered in the 1980s, those who <b>had</b> <b>AIDS</b> were not likely to live longer than a few years. There are now antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) available to treat HIV infections. There is no known cure for HIV or AIDS but the drugs help suppress the virus. By suppressing the amount of virus in the body, people can lead longer and healthier lives. Even though their virus levels may be low they can still spread the virus to others.|$|E
500|$|Agudath Israel hired Cynthia [...] "Cyndie" [...] Culpeper as rabbi in 1995. Culpeper, {{a convert}} from Catholicism and former nurse, had been posted at Agudath Israel as a rabbinical intern, and was hired there {{full-time}} upon graduation from the JTSA, the first Conservative woman rabbi in Alabama. However, {{the following year}} she revealed that she <b>had</b> <b>AIDS,</b> {{the result of an}} accidental needle prick while working as a nurse. The congregation rallied around her, insisting she continue to work, and wearing red AIDS awareness ribbons, but in 1997 she gave up her position and moved to Birmingham, Alabama, where she could get [...] "cutting edge" [...] treatment at the University of Alabama at Birmingham's AIDS research clinic.

500|$|Indeed, it {{has been}} noted that, {{throughout}} the soap's early years, Dot was portrayed as a [...] "lovable bigot", prejudiced against her neighbours and only happy when others were not. During the 1980s, Dot was shown to exhibit both racism and homophobia {{to members of the}} Walford community. In 1987, Dot was shown to respond negatively to Colin Russell (Michael Cashman) upon learning he was gay, reacting in [...] "horror and ignorant self-righteousness" [...] and spreading rumours that Colin <b>had</b> <b>AIDS.</b> According to Gary Loach from GaydarNation, Dot was being used by the programme makers to expose the bigotry of the [...] "moral majority" [...] in the real world following a public and media backlash over EastEnders screening of its first homosexual kiss. However, while Dot has portrayed bigotry, author Anthony Slide has noted that the character can typically be [...] "relied upon to drop her prejudices– she learned to accept both blacks and homosexuals in Albert Square." ...|$|E

500|$|Other storylines have {{concentrated}} on Dot's various attempts to reform Nick, such as in 1991, when Nick returned with a heroin addiction. As the plot unfolded, Dot tried to curtail Nick's addiction by locking him in his room and forcing him to go cold turkey. His resulting paranoia and cravings led him to escape and murder the first person he encountered, The Queen Victoria landlord Eddie Royle (Michael Melia). The episode where Eddie was murdered was the big autumn launch episode for 1991. Nick stood trial in January 1993; however, [...] "he got away with murder" [...] {{for a second time}} in the serial. Other scams have included Nick's attempt to con Dot by claiming he <b>had</b> <b>AIDS</b> in 1998 after escaping from prison, which ultimately led to Dot having him re-imprisoned. Then followed a plot that saw him largely {{responsible for the death of}} his son Ashley (Frankie Fitzgerald) in 2001, ultimately leading Dot to disown Nick.|$|E

In his first-person piece, Schmalz wrote about waking up with nightmares where he was in a coffin, about his mother's death after she learned he <b>had</b> <b>AIDS,</b> and his sense of being completely alone.|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} {{concepts of}} the characters differ largely from the finished products.

2500|$|AIDS {{was seen}} as a disease of gay, White, North American men. And people were really afraid of it. There were no {{treatments}} available in the Caribbean at the time, so AIDS really was a death sentence. You had people with Kaposi's sarcoma, people with violent diarrhea, who were just wasting away and then dying in really horrible and traumatic ways. To call what was going on here [...] "stigma and discrimination" [...] was really an understatement. In the ghettos they were putting tires around people who <b>had</b> <b>AIDS</b> and lighting the tires on fire. They were killing gay people because they thought AIDS was contagious. It was a very extreme environment, and really horrible things were happening.|$|E
2500|$|Two days later, Hudson {{traveled}} to Paris, France, {{for another round}} of treatment. After Hudson collapsed in his room at the Ritz Hotel in Paris on July 21, his publicist, Dale Olson, released a statement claiming that Hudson had inoperable liver cancer. Olson denied reports that Hudson <b>had</b> <b>AIDS</b> and would say only that he was undergoing tests for [...] "everything" [...] at the American Hospital of Paris. But, four days later, July 25, 1985, Hudson's French publicist Yanou Collart confirmed that Hudson did in fact have AIDS. He {{was among the first}} notable individuals to have been diagnosed with the disease. In another press release a month later, Hudson speculated he might have contracted HIV through transfused blood from an infected donor during the multiple blood transfusions he received during his heart bypass procedure in November 1981.|$|E
2500|$|Crowe's last series as {{captain of}} New Zealand came when Australia toured in February and March 1993. He had {{struggled}} with injuries for several years, {{and was replaced}} by Ken Rutherford to allow him to concentrate on his form. However, he returned as captain for one final match in November 1993, the first game of a series against Australia. In total, Crowe captained New Zealand in sixteen Tests, winning only two. He had a much better record in ODIs, with the team winning 21 out of 44 matches under his captaincy. Crowe was described by broadcaster Bryan Waddle as a [...] "proactive rather than reactive" [...] leader, who was [...] "always prepared to be innovative". He had a troubled relationship with the media throughout his captaincy, in one case using a press conference to confront a journalist who had published an article implying he <b>had</b> <b>AIDS.</b>|$|E
