40|$|Chemically {{modified}} USY zeolites {{were obtained}} by ammonium nitrate (AN) treatment under hydrothermal conditions. AN treatment considerably enhanced the mesopore volume of the parent steam-treated zeolite. This treatment also caused the creation of extraframework species of weak acid nature. NiMoP-based hydrocracking catalysts were prepared using the modified zeolites and evaluated in the hydrocracking of a <b>heavy</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>gas</b> <b>oil</b> (VGO). Hydrocracking activity results indicate that, although AN treatment significantly develops mesoporosity in the parent steam-treated USY zeolite, this single treatment was not efficient to enhance the accessibility of VGO compounds to the acid sites. However, the catalysts based on AN-treated zeolites showed significantly higher middle distillates yields than the one based on a steam-treated zeolite. The creation of an amorphous phase at the mesopore walls and the external surface of the zeolite crystals was argued to support this observation. Mild Na 2 H 2 -EDTA treatment to an AN-treated zeolite showed to be beneficial to improve the hydrocracking activity. This was attributed to the enhanced access to acid sites after the removal of polymerized extraframework aluminum species (EFAl). Consequently, a modification strategy of USY zeolites that includes AN treatments is proposed to develop catalysts with enhanced middle distillates selectivity in the hydrocracking of real feedstocks...|$|E
40|$|USY zeolite {{catalysts}} were {{chemically modified}} by treatment with aqueous solutions of sodium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) {{to study the}} effect of removal of extraframework aluminum species (EFAl) on hydrocracking performance. The textural, structural and acidic properties were characterized by XRD, elemental analysis, XPS, N 2 physisorption, HRTEM, 29 Si and 27 Al solid-state NMR, ammonia TPD and IR spectroscopy of adsorbed pyridine. The acid catalytic activity of the zeolites {{was measured by the}} conversion of propane and 1, 3, 5 -tri-isopropylbenzene. EDTA is a selective agent for the extraction of EFAl from USY preserving the framework Al content. Concomitant with EFAl removal, EDTA enhances the textural properties and changes bulk and surface properties, in particular the Al speciation. Hydrocracking catalysts were prepared from the modified USY zeolites and alumina loaded with a P-promoted NiMo-sulfide phase. Their performance was evaluated in the hydrocracking of a <b>heavy</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>gas</b> <b>oil</b> under conditions close to the industrial practice. The most active hydrocracking catalyst is obtained by removal of a relatively small amount of EFAl from the USY zeolite. The mild EDTA treatment to achieve this selectively extracts amorphous EFAl species from the mesopore system, resulting in better access to acid sites and an increase of the concentration of strong Brønsted acid sites. Severe EDTA treatment resulted in lower hydrocracking activity which was ascribed to progressive leaching of EFAl synergistically involved in the cracking catalysis. The present study therefore points out the importance of the presence of some EFAl species for the hydrocracking of real feedstocks. This work also shows that even with supports with increased mesoporosity and stronger acid character, higher hydrocracking activity of a real feedstock is not guaranteed...|$|E
40|$|Novel Ni 2 ̆ 013 Mo/activated carbon (AC) {{hydrotreating}} catalysts {{were prepared}} and evaluated for upgrading <b>heavy</b> <b>vacuum</b> <b>gas</b> <b>oil</b> (HVGO). The AC supports {{were derived from}} Alberta oil sand petroleum coke, i. e. fluid coke and/or delayed coke, hereafter referred to as OSP coke, through a chemical process. The BET surface area was as high as 2194 m 2 /g for the fluid coke derived AC and 2357 m 2 /g for the delayed coke derived AC. Both ACs contained {{a large number of}} micropores with pore volume as high as 1. 2 cm 3 /g. Ni and Mo based active component precursors could be easily loaded on the activated carbon supports by chemical impregnation of nickel nitrate and ammonium molybdate followed by calcination in nitrogen at 773 K without further modification or oxidation treatment to the activated carbons. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observation showed highly porous surface structure of the bare activated carbon supports and well dispersed metal (oxide) precursor nanoparticles of 302 ̆ 01350 nm loaded on the AC supports. For comparison, two reference catalysts were also prepared by the same procedure but using commercial activated carbon and porous alumina as supports. After catalyst activation by sulfiding, the hydrotreating performance of the prepared catalysts was evaluated in a magnetically stirred autoclave with a HVGO feedstock to examine their hydrodesulfurization (HDS) and hydrodenitrogenation (HDN) activities. Two commercial hydrotreating catalysts were also tested and compared under similar conditions with the same feed. The results showed that the catalysts based on the activated carbon supports prepared from OSP coke had better hydrotreating performance than the other catalysts. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) characterization of the catalysts after activation showed that small particles of nanostructure (22 ̆ 0135 nm in size) were evenly embedded in the carbon matrix except for some bigger particles that were located on the catalyst surface. Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy revealed that these particles were composed of Ni, Mo and S elements. The dispersed nanoparticles formed the active sites and were responsible for the observed high HDS and HDN activity. Elemental analysis and surface characterization of the spent catalysts showed that the formation of coke precursors was favored on the alumina supported catalyst, which resulted in catalyst deactivation.

40|$|A 4 -lump {{kinetic model}} {{including}} hydrogen consumption for hydrocracking of <b>vacuum</b> <b>gas</b> <b>oil</b> {{in a pilot}} scale reactor is proposed. The advantage of this work over the previous ones is consideration of hydrogen consumption, imposed by converting <b>vacuum</b> <b>gas</b> <b>oil</b> to light products, which is implemented in the kinetic model by a quadratic expression as similar as response surface modeling. This approach considers <b>vacuum</b> <b>gas</b> <b>oil</b> (VGO) and unconverted oil as one lump whilst others are distillate, naphtha and gas.

The hydrocracking bed is considered as a plug flow reactor and it is modeled by the cellular network approach. Initially, a kinetic network with twelve coefficients and six paths is considered. But following evaluation using measured data and order of magnitude analysis, the three route passes and one activation energy coefficient are omitted; thus the number of coefficients is reduced to five.

In this study, we applied new cutting-edge techniques to improve the characterization of a coal derived liquid obtained from a liquefaction step starting from Scottish bituminous coal. For this purpose, bidimensional chromatography (GC xGC), and C- 13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) were used to analyze four cuts of the coal liquid with the following boiling points intervals: heavy naphtha (initial boiling point: IBP- 215 degrees C), <b>gas</b> <b>oil</b> (215 - 343 degrees C), <b>vacuum</b> <b>gas</b> <b>oil</b> (343 - 524 degrees C) and vacuum residue (524 (+) degrees C).

Aromaticity given by C- 13 NMR in this cut is as high as the level observed in petroleum asphaltenes (C-aro = 53 wt%). High content of heteroelements, which highly increase the polarity of the molecules, in the coal liquid and especially in the vacuum residue can explain the enhanced amount of n-heptane-insoluble compounds.

30|$|Thermal {{hydrocracking}} and catalytic hydrocracking {{of heavy}} oil and model reactant {{have been carried}} out to investigate the effect of dispersed Mo catalyst on slurry-phase hydrocracking. The XRD and XPS patterns suggested that the major existence form of dispersed Mo catalyst in slurry-phase hydrocracking was MoS 2. Experimental data revealed that the conversion of feedstock oils and model reactant increased with the presence of catalyst, while the yields of light products (gas, naphtha) and <b>heavy</b> products (<b>vacuum</b> residue, coke) decreased, the yields of diesel and <b>vacuum</b> <b>gas</b> <b>oil</b> increased in the meantime. Besides, the yields of aromatic hydrocarbon and naphthenic hydrocarbon in naphtha fraction decreased. Effect parameters R G (the ratio of i-C 4 H 10 yield to n-C 4 H 10 yield) and isoparaffin/n-paraffin ratio were proposed to study the reaction mechanism of slurry-phase hydrocracking, the smaller effect parameters showed that there was no carbonium ion mechanism in slurry-phase hydrocracking, which still followed the free radical mechanism, and that the isomerization ratio of products decreased with the presence of Mo catalyst.|$|R
30|$|In this study, ZSM- 5 zeolite was {{successfully}} synthesized hydrothermally from cheap and easily accessible natural mineral diatomite {{in the presence}} of tetrapropyl ammonium bromide. The pore structure, acidic sites and surface features of as-synthesized ZSM- 5 zeolite were well characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, pyridine-adsorbed Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and N 2 adsorption. The analysis results revealed that the as-synthesized ZSM- 5 zeolite exhibited excellent hydrothermal stability, high specific surface area (223  m 2  g− 1) and more acidic cites than diatomite. After mixing ZSM- 5 zeolite with a FCC base catalyst, the catalytic performance was evaluated in a micro-fixed bed reactor using <b>vacuum</b> <b>gas</b> <b>oil</b> (VGO) as feedstock. The high surface area and more acidic sites of as-synthesized ZSM- 5 zeolite {{played an important role in}} the production of light olefins (propylene and butylene) during catalytic cracking of VGO.|$|R
40|$|More {{than half}} of the total world oil {{reserves}} are heavy oil, extra heavy oil, and bitumen; however their catalytic conversion to more valuable products is challenging. The use of submicronic particles or nanoparticles of catalysts suspended in the feedstock may be a viable alternative to the conversion of heavy oils at refinery level or downhole (in situ upgrading). In the present work, molybdenum sulfide (MoS 2) particles with varying diameters (10000 – 10 [*]nm) were prepared using polyvinylpyrrolidone as capping agent. The prepared particles were characterized by DLS, TEM, XRD, and XPS and tested in the hydrodesulfurization (HDS) of a <b>vacuum</b> <b>gas</b> <b>oil</b> (VGO). A correlation between particle size and activity is presented. It was found that particles with diameters around 13 [*]nm show double the HDS activity compared with the material with micrometric particle sizes (diameter ≈ 10, 000 [*]nm) ...|$|R
