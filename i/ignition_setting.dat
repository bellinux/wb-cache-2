40|$|What are the {{characteristics}} of lightning that influence the probability that an individual stroke will ignite a wildfire? It is generally accepted that long continuing current following some return strokes {{is the cause of}} ignition in forest fuels. However, because these low-level currents are not detectable with operative Lightning Location Systems, other lightning characteristics correlating with its occurrence have been proposed and used to estimate ignition probability. These variables are typically: flash multiplicity, stroke polarity, stroke peak current and flash interstroke interval. The region of Catalonia is prone to forest fires, and to set a probability of ignition to each cloud-to-ground flash could be useful in wildfire management. A set of more than 500 lightning-ignited wildfires that occurred in Catalonia between 2004 and 2009 was analyzed, in order to find which flash/stroke characteristics are related to ignition. Lightning activity was gathered by the Lightning Location System of the Meteorological Service of Catalonia. Lightning related to these wildfires were selected from the lightning database using a proximity index. The statistical analysis has shown that the sample of lightning causing ignition does not present any characteristic that differentiates it from the overall population. Polarity percents, multiplicity and peak current frequency distributions in the lightning causing <b>ignition</b> <b>set</b> are similar to the climatological ones. Besides this analysis, a high-speed video field campaign of natural lightning recordings was conducted, to obtain new insight into {{the characteristics}} of lightning bearing a continuing current.

Similarly, the contribution of individual anthropogenic predictors varied greatly among ecoregions. Railroad corridors and agricultural presence tended to be the most important predictors of anthropogenic ignition, while population density and roads were generally poor predictors. Although human population has often been used as a proxy for ignitions at global scales, it is less important at regional scales when more specific land uses (e. g., agriculture) can be identified.

40|$|Calcium {{aluminate}} cement (CAC) is very versatile {{special cement}} used for specific applications. During the hydration of CAC a large quantity of heat is liberated within {{one day that}} causes a considerable increase of temperature in material. This paper examines the hydration of three samples (A, B and aged B) of commercial CAC ISTRA 40 (producer: Istra Cement, Pula, Croatia). The rate of heat generation of cement pastes due to the hydration reactions was measured at several temperatures with differential micro-calorimeter. In the experiments water to cement ratio was also varied and in one sample quartz sand was added. When CAC and water first come in contact far less heat is liberated, than for Portland cement. Higher water to cement ratio increases the heat evolved at later ages due to higher quantity of water available for hydration. Cement mortar prepared with milled quartz sand showed 1. 2 h shorter setting time than corresponding neat CAC paste. This {{could be explained by}} more germination sites available for the nuclei to start the hydration precipitation. Except for the change in the setting time there are no other significant differences in the kinetics of hydration when compared to original cement sample.

In order to accurately <b>set</b> the <b>ignition</b> advance for optimum engine performance under all conditions of engine operation, an adaptive closed loop spark advance controller is required. Investigations of visible and infra-red electromagnetic radiation emitted from the combustion flame of four stroke petrol engines have been made.

40|$|International audienceOne of the {{objectives}} of the present study is to gain {{a deeper understanding of the}} heat transfer mechanisms that control the spread of wildfires. Five experimental fires were conducted in the field across on plots of living vegetation. The lengths of the <b>ignition</b> lines were <b>set</b> in the range of 20 - 30 m to reproduce wildfire front conditions as closely as possible. The experiments were performed under various vegetation properties, wind conditions and plot topography to highlight different fire spread behaviours. This study focused on characterising heat transfer ahead of the flame front. The temperature and heat flux were measured at the top of the vegetation as the fire spread. The results showed the existence of two different fire spread regimes that were either dominated by radiation or governed by mixed radiant-convective heat transfer. For plume-dominated fires, the flow strongly responds to the great buoyancy forces generated by the fire; this guides the fire plume upward. For wind-driven fires, the flow is governed by inertial forces due to the wind, and the fire plume is greatly tilted towards unburned vegetation. The correlations of the temperature (ahead of the flame front) and wind velocity fluctuations change according to the fire regime. The longitudinal distributions of the radiant heat flux ahead of the fire front are also discussed. The data showed that neither the convective Froude number nor the Nelson convection number [...] used in the literature to predict fire spread regimes [...] reflect the observed behaviour of wind-driven fires...|$|R
40|$|Coal {{spontaneous}} combustion is an inherent problem in coal mines throughout the world. The analysis of stationary-states, including stable point and critical point, {{is an effective}} method to judge its ignition tendency. A lower critical point temperature means {{that it is more}} likely to cause fire. In the past, due to the limitation of mathematical methods, the consumption and distribution of oxygen concentration are usually neglected. In order to accurately analyze coal ignition tendency, this paper takes coal bulk as a porous system and develops an improved model by a combination of oxygen species and energy equation. The model is solved for stationary-states of the system. Qualitative analysis of the stationary-states gives a mechanism explanation for the reason why coal spontaneous ignition is hard to be extinguished and indicates that the temperature of initial endpoint and that of internal site can be uniquely determined from each other. It further points out a trend that the location of critical point moves inward as the inlet air velocity increases, which correlates well with simulation results of the existing literatures. Then, for stationary-states, calculation results of Killoch 6015 coal are obtained. Quantitative analysis of them finds a trend that the temperature of critical point rises rapidly after its slow increase. At last, a velocity range, in which the possibility of fire is extremely high, is presented by simulation computation, e. g., the range of Killoch 6015 coal is determined as 8 x 10 ¿ 5 ¿ 3 x 10 ¿ 3 m/s when the critical <b>ignition</b> temperature is <b>set</b> as 150 °C...|$|R

40|$|Recently multiple-hazards {{engineering}} {{has received}} more attention when evaluating the capacity and analyzing {{the behavior of a}} system that is exposed to more than one type of hazard. In this paper, the principle of multiple-hazards is investigated and a new methodology has been developed to assess cumulative damage of structural elements. The proposed approach is able to combine structural damage caused by sequential hazards through their conditional probability of occurrence. The damage related to each hazard has been evaluated independently. The corresponding physical models associated to each hazard have been used to assess the conditional probability of hazard's occurrence. The method has been applied to a hospital located in California, US. Three hazards (earthquake, blast and fire) have been analyzed. First, non-linear time-history analyses have been performed using seven ground motions scaled to five different earthquake levels and the seismic response of the structure has been evaluated. The seismic input has damaged the hospital's power supply (LPG reservoir tank) which has caused a blast. The probability of explosion has been estimated taking into account the probabilities of fuel leakage, fuel concentration, and <b>ignition</b> respectively. A <b>set</b> of twelve blast intensity levels has been considered in the analyses, corresponding to different quantities of fuel content inside the tank. Afterwards, a fire hazard is generated following the explosion, whose intensity level has been evaluated using the compartmental heat flux. The fire effects have been modeled assuming an increment of temperature in the steel frame. The proposed multi-hazard approach can be used for both improving the structural safety and reducing the building life cycle costs to enhance in the end, the resilience of the hospital. Results show that this methodology can be used to provide risk mitigation measures within a more general resilience framework...|$|R

40|$|Binary {{white dwarf}} (WD) coalescences driven by {{gravitational}} waves or collisions in triple systems are potential progenitors of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). We combine {{the distribution of}} 56 Ni inferred from observations of SNe Ia {{with the results of}} both sub-Chandrasekhar detonation models and direct collision calculations to estimate what mass WDs should be exploding in each scenario to reproduce the observations. These WD mass distributions are then compared with the observed Galactic WD mass distribution and Monte Carlo simulations of WD-WD binary populations. For collisions, we find that the average mass of the individual components of the WD-WD binary must be peaked at ~ 0. 75 Msun, significantly higher than the average WD mass in binaries or in the field of ~ 0. 55 - 0. 60 Msun. Thus, if collisions produce a large fraction of SNe Ia, then a mechanism must exist that favors large mass WDs. On the other hand, in an old stellar population, collisions would naturally result in a class of low luminosity SNe Ia, and we suggest these may be related to 1991 bg-like events. For sub-Chandrasekhar detonations, we find that the average mass of the exploding WDs must be peaked at ~ 1. 1 Msun. This is interestingly similar to the average sum of the masses in WD-WD binaries, {{but it is not clear}} (and should be further explored) whether double degenerate mergers would be sufficiently efficient at synthesizing 56 Ni to match the observed yields. If not, then actual ~ 1. 1 Msun WDs would be needed for sub-Chandrasekhar detonations. Since such high mass WDs are produced relatively quickly in comparison to the age of the environments where SNe Ia are found, this would require either accretion onto lower mass WDs prior to ignition or a long timescale between formation of the ~ 1. 1 Msun WD and <b>ignition</b> (such as <b>set</b> by gravitational wave emission or binary interactions). Comment: 8 pages, 5 figures, submitted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal. Revised manuscript includes an updated 56 Ni distribution, a new emphasis on subluminous 1991 bg-like SNe Ia, and a different approach to binary population models. Updated acknowledgement...|$|R
