Confirmation of the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin (GZK) suppression above approx. 4 x 10 (exp 19) eV suggests that most UHECR originate in astrophysical objects.

50|$|Most SLR cameras provide {{automatic}} aperture control, {{which allows}} viewing and metering at the lens’s maximum aperture, stops the lens {{down to the}} working aperture during exposure, and returns the lens to maximum aperture after exposure.

50|$|Tokyo Kogaku KK {{launched}} their first 35mm SLR camera in 1957, {{about two years}} before the Nikon F and the Canonflex. This was the Topcon R that acquired the bayonet lens mount from the Exakta Varex camera from Ihagee in Dresden, successor to the Kine Exakta of 1936. It was also inspired by the Zeiss Ikon Contax S as well as the Japanese Miranda T - most obviously the body shape by the former, and the detachable finder prism by the latter. However, it was not until 1963 the Topcon name became famous by introducing the Topcon RE Super, an event that took the entire camera industry by surprise: This camera featured through-the lens (TTL) exposure metering, and <b>at</b> <b>full</b> lens <b>aperture</b> <b>at</b> that. The RE Super was fully prepared for professional work supported by a choice of lenses and accessories to complement it. The United States importer was the Charles Beseler Company and it was sold as the Beseler Topcon Super D.|$|R

[...] Many such lenses incorporated a feature {{known as a}} [...] "preset" [...] aperture, which allows the lens to be set to working aperture and then quickly switched between working <b>aperture</b> and <b>full</b> <b>aperture</b> without looking <b>at</b> the <b>aperture</b> control. A typical operation might be to establish rough composition, set the working aperture for metering, return to <b>full</b> <b>aperture</b> for a final check of focus and composition, and focusing, and finally, return to working aperture just before exposure. Although slightly easier than stopped-down metering, operation is less convenient than automatic operation. Preset aperture controls have taken several forms; the most common has been the use of essentially two lens aperture rings, with one ring setting the aperture and the other serving as a limit stop when switching to working aperture. [...] Examples of lenses {{with this type of}} preset aperture control are the Nikon PC Nikkor 28mm 3.5 and the SMC Pentax Shift 6×7 75mm 4.5.

We investigated the possibility of using the curvature of the lens surfaces to reduce the shift in the filter passband for large field angles and found that locating the filter on the proper surface will considerably reduce the shift of the passband. Specifically, we determined the distribution of angles of incidence for <b>full</b> <b>aperture</b> pencils incident <b>at</b> several field angles on the second and fourth surfaces of the 90 ° Geocon IV, the 90 ° Paxar, and the 125 ° Pleogon. We then calculated the spectral transmittance of each lens when a wide passband interference filter was located on its second or fourth surface. We also calculated the degree of polarization introduced. From the cases considered, we found that the tracing of an upper and lower marginal (rim) ray at maximum field angle is sufficient to determine the suitability of a surface, the criterion being that, the smaller the angle of incidence at the surface, the better. In addition, we found that, with the filter on the second surface of the Paxar, spectral transmittance changes with field angle were negligible and the modulation due to polarization was about 1...|$|R

50|$|Some common {{features}} of 35mm SLR photography were first {{seen on the}} Topcon RE Super. Among these is the through-the-lens exposure metering. This enabled improved exposure accuracy, especially in close-up macro photography using bellows or extension rings, and in telephotography with long lenses. In addition to this feature, the metering is <b>at</b> <b>full</b> <b>aperture.</b> For this purpose the RE-lensese have an aperture simulator that relays the preset aperture to the exposure meter <b>at</b> <b>full</b> <b>aperture,</b> retaining a bright viewfinder image while determining the correct exposure, avoiding the stop-down method. The meter also works independently of the pentaprism finder, which allows for different viewfinder configurations. The meter cell is actually incorporated in the camera's reflex finder mirror. This was accomplished by milling narrow slits in the mirror surface letting {{a fraction of the}} light through to the CdS cell placed just behind it.|$|R

In the infrared the <b>full</b> <b>apertures</b> can be used with reduced visibility. The use of visible light for fringe tracking will be limited by the small apertures which can be used without AO. Adaptive optics of low order (for the infrared) to moderate order (for the visible) can greatly increase the visibility transfer function of the array, allowing use of the <b>full</b> <b>aperture</b> in the visible.

40|$|A method using subapertures {{that are}} prefocused {{near the middle}} of the region of {{interest}} is proposed as a substitute for composite focusing commonly used in abdominal ultrasound imaging. In that method M transmit zones are stitched together in order to achieve close to dynamic transmit focusing. The depth of focus of each zone is proportional to the inverse square of the aperture D, and the focused region is approximately M times that. In the proposed method, the aperture is divided into non-overlapping subapertures of size D/N. Each subaperture transmits a pre-focused beam with dynamic focusing on the <b>full</b> <b>aperture</b> on reception. Data from the subapertures is combined using synthetic aperture processing. The depth of focus for each subaperture is N*N times that of the <b>full</b> <b>aperture.</b> Thus the equivalent of composite focusing with M=N*N zones is achieved with N subapertures.
