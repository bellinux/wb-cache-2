5000|$|The ski season, {{which is}} similar to the Alps, {{typically}} runs from mid-December to April, depending on the length and <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>snowfall.</b> [...] In spring, it is sometimes possible to snow ski in the morning and drive to the coast in the afternoon to water ski.|$|E
5000|$|Freshly fallen, uncompacted snow. The {{density and}} {{moisture}} content of powder snow can vary widely; snowfall in coastal {{regions and areas}} with higher humidity is usually heavier than a similar <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>snowfall</b> in an arid or continental region. Light, dry (low moisture content, typically 4-7% water content) powder snow is prized by skiers and snowboarders. It is often found in the Rocky Mountains of North America and in most regions in Japan.|$|E

30|$|In addition, another weight {{based on}} the {{curvature}} was used, where it became larger with negative values (concave) and smaller with positive ones (convex). This second weight was defined by exp(k(x)/ 10) as an example. A {{combination of the two}} weights was used to calculate S(x). Integrating the measure S(x) over an entire image, S(total) was to get a measure of snow amount for the entire image. S(total) was not depth of snow. Therefore, a scaling factor was needed and it was collated with real <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>snowfall.</b> However, the process above corresponded to one-time snowfall. It was repeated, if further smoothing was necessary. If repeated once, it corresponded to depth. It should be noted that gradient and curvature should be calculated again prior to the next snowfall.|$|E
40|$|The spatiotemporal {{changes in}} 21 indices of extreme {{temperature}} and precipitation for the Mongolian Plateau from 1951 to 2012 were investigated {{on the basis}} of daily temperature and precipitation data from 70 meteorological stations. Changes in catastrophic events, such as droughts, floods, and snowstorms, were also investigated for the same period. The correlations between catastrophic events and the extreme indices were examined. The results show that the Mongolian Plateau experienced an asymmetric warming trend. Both the cold extremes and warm extremes showed greater warming at night than in the daytime. The spatial changes in significant trends showed a good homogeneity and consistency in Inner Mongolia. Changes in the precipitation extremes were not as obvious as those in the temperature extremes. The spatial distributions in changes of precipitation extremes were complex. Adecreasing trend was shown for total precipitation from west to east as based on the spatial distribution of decadal trends. Drought was the most serious extreme disaster, and prolonged drought for longer than 3 yr occurred about every 7 - 11 yr. An increasing trend in the disaster area was apparent for flood events from 1951 to 2012. A decreasing trend was observed for the maximum <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>snowfall</b> from 1951 to 2012, with a decreased average maximum depth of 10 mm from the 1990 s...|$|E
40|$|Current {{prediction}} <b>of</b> <b>snowfall</b> amounts {{is accomplished}} either by using empirical techniques or {{by using a}} standard modification of liquid equivalent precipitation such as the 10 -to- 1 rule. This rule, which supposes that the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> the <b>snowfall</b> is 10 times the liquid equivalent (a snow ratio of 10 : 1, reflecting an assumed snow density of 100 kg m� 3), is a particularly popular technique with operational forecasters, although it dates from a limited nineteenth-century study. Unfortunately, measurements of freshly fallen snow indicate that the snow ratio can vary from {{on the order of}} 3 : 1 to (occasionally) 100 : 1. Improving quantitative snowfall forecasts requires, in addition to solutions to the significant challenge of forecasting liquid precipitation amounts, a more robust method for forecasting the density of snow. A review of the microphysical literature reveals that many factors may contribute to snow density, including in-cloud (crystal habit and size, the degree of riming and aggregation of the snowflake), subcloud (melting and sublimation), and surface processes (compaction and snowpack metamorphism). Despite this complexity, the paper explores the sufficiency of surface and radiosonde data for the classification <b>of</b> <b>snowfall</b> density. A principal component analysis isolates seven factors that influence the snow ratio: solar radiation (month), low- to midlevel temperature, mid- to upper-level temperature, low- to midlevel relative humidity, midlevel relative humidity, upper-level relative humidity, and external compaction (surfac...|$|R
