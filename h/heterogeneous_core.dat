40|$|This paper {{makes two}} {{observations}} {{that lead to}} a new <b>heterogeneous</b> <b>core</b> design. First, we observe that most serial code exhibits fine-grained heterogeneity: at the scale of tens or hundreds of instructions, regions of code fit different microarchitectures better (at the same point or {{at different points in}} time). Second, we observe that by grouping contiguous regions of instructions into blocks that are executed atomically, a core can exploit this fine-grained heterogeneity: atomicity allows each block to be executed independently on its own execution backend that fits its characteristics best. Based on these observations, we propose a fine-grained hetero-geneous core design, called the heterogeneous block architecture (HBA), that combines heterogeneous execution backends into one core. HBA breaks the program into blocks of code, determines the best backend for each block, and specializes the block for that backend. As an example HBA design, we combine out-of-order, VLIW, and in-order backends, using simple heuristics to choose backends for different dynamic instruction blocks. Our extensive evaluations compare this example HBA design to multiple baseline core designs (including monolithic out-of-order, clustered out-of-order, in-order and a state-of-the-art <b>heterogeneous</b> <b>core</b> design) and show that it provides significantly better energy efficiency than all designs at similar performance.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a new technique}} for determining the pin power in <b>heterogeneous</b> <b>core</b> calculations. It {{is based on a}} domain decomposition with overlapping subdomains and a component mode synthesis technique for the global flux determination. Local basis functions are used to span a discrete space that allows fundamental global mode approximation through a Galerkin technique. Two approaches are given to obtain these local basis functions: in the first one (Component Mode Synthesis method), the first few spatial eigenfunctions are computed on each subdomain, using periodic boundary conditions. In the second one (Factorized Component Mode Synthesis method), only the fundamental mode is computed, and we use a factorization principle for the flux in order to replace the higher order eigenmodes. These different local spatial functions are extended to the global domain by defining them as zero outside the subdomain. These methods are well-fitted for <b>heterogeneous</b> <b>core</b> calculations because the spatial interface modes are taken into account in the domain decomposition. Although these methods could be applied to higher order angular approximations- particularly easily to a approximation- the numerical results we provide are obtained using a diffusion model. We show the methods ’ accuracy for reactor cores loaded with UOX and MOX assemblies, for which standard reconstruction techniques are known to perform poorly. Furthermore, we show that our methods are highly and easily parallelizable. NS...|$|E

40|$|Asymmetric {{multicore}} processors {{have demonstrated}} a strong potential for improving performance and energy-efficiency. Shared-ISA asymmetric multicore processors overcome pro- grammability problems in disjoint-ISA systems and enhance single-ISA architectures with instruction based asymmetry. In such a design, processors share a common, baseline ISA and performance enhanced (PE) cores extend the baseline ISA with instructions that accelerate performance-critical operations. To exploit asymmetry, the scheduler {{should be able}} to migrate threads based on their acceleration potential. The contribution of this paper is a low overhead binary code rewriting method for shared-ISA multicore processors that transforms a binary executable at runtime, according to the scheduled processor's PE capabilities. The mutable binary code can be re-targeted among <b>heterogeneous</b> <b>cores</b> at any point in execution while preserving functional equivalence and using PE instructions, transparently, when avail- able, thus enabling migrations among <b>heterogeneous</b> <b>cores.</b> We emulate a realistic shared-ISA asymmetric multicore system using actual hardware { an FPGA experimental prototype.

40|$|Abstract—Since the non-cache {{parts of}} a core are less regular, {{compared}} to on-chip caches, tolerating manufacturing defects in the processing core is a more challenging problem. Due {{to the lack of}} effective solutions, disabling non-functional cores is a common practice in industry, which results in a significant reduction in system throughput. Although a faulty core cannot be trusted to correctly execute programs, we observe that for most defects, when starting from a valid architectural state, execution traces on a defective core coarsely resemble those of fault-free executions. In light of this insight, we propose a robust and <b>heterogeneous</b> <b>core</b> coupling execution scheme, Necromancer, that exploits a functionally dead core to improve system throughput by supplying hints regarding high-level program behavior.

In such 3 D CMPs, network-on-chip (NoC) architectures will enable communication between multiple <b>heterogeneous</b> <b>cores.</b> However, NoCs face several challenges, including limited bandwidth, high latency, and high power dissipation. Hybrid nanophotonic-electric NoCs are being considered as a solution to address the above challenges due to their desirable performance and power characteristics. These emerging communication architectures require substantial optimization to realize their full potential. Optimizing hybrid nanophotonic-electric 3 D NoCs requires intelligent traversal through a massive design space, which is non-trivial. No prior work has addressed the problem of synthesizing and optimizing application-specific hybrid nanophotonic-electric 3 D NoCs with an irregular topology to connect <b>heterogeneous</b> <b>cores</b> on a 3 D CMP.
