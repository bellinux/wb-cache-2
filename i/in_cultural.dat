40|$|Farmers are {{the subject}} for rural {{community}} cultural construction. Development of rural community cultural construction can not go without participation of farmers. At present, there exist a lot of factors that impede farmers’ participation <b>in</b> community <b>cultural</b> construction. Firstly, basic cultural facilities and occasions are lacking for participation of farmers. Secondly, farmers have no enough knowledge <b>in</b> community <b>cultural</b> construction and have relatively low autonomy in participation. Thirdly, the relatively low cultural quality of farmers also constrains the ability of farmers to participation <b>in</b> community <b>cultural</b> construction. This article puts forward several measures to promote farmers to participate <b>in</b> community <b>cultural</b> construction, such as, to strengthen community education, {{enhance the quality of}} farmers and intensify the enthusiasm and ability of farmers to participate; to enlarge capital investment to set up cultural facilities and occasions and to offer solid material foundations for farmers’ participation; to cultivate positively community cultural organizations and to push forward farmers to participate <b>in</b> community <b>cultural</b> construction; to resort to community culture and elegant culture to enhance the rural cultural level and to absorb farmers to participate <b>in</b> community <b>cultural</b> construction...|$|R

5|$|Analysts {{see in the}} {{character}} of Lady Macbeth the conflict between femininity and masculinity as they are impressed <b>in</b> <b>cultural</b> norms. Lady Macbeth suppresses her instincts toward compassion, motherhood, and fragility — associated with femininity — in favour of ambition, ruthlessness, and the singleminded pursuit of power. This conflict colours the entire drama and sheds light on gender-based preconceptions from Shakespearean England to the present.|$|E

5|$|Scholars have {{suggested}} that oral traditions in general and poetry in particular was well placed to play a part <b>in</b> <b>cultural</b> resistance to apartheid. Music and poetry were more accessible to {{a large number of}} South Africans than written material (partly due to the restrictions placed by apartheid). Music, poetry, and storytelling also formed part of the everyday life of a number of South Africans, and protest songs emerged from these traditions. In addition, poetry was traditionally seen by some South Africans as a legitimate means of criticising authority, with poetic licence allowing artists to say things that would otherwise not be acceptable.|$|E

5|$|The last Ottoman census, {{conducted}} in 1908, counted 128,000 Orthodox Christians and 95,000 Muslims in the region.

The {{rest of the}} Orthodox community spoke an Albanian patois at home, but was literate only in Greek, which was used <b>in</b> <b>cultural,</b> trading and economic activities. Moreover, they expressed a strong pro-Greek feeling, and {{were the first to}} support the following breakaway autonomist movement. Considering these conditions, loyalty in Northern Epirus to an Albanian government competing in an anarchy, whose leaders were mostly Muslim, could not be guaranteed.|$|E
5|$|According to the 2006 Nigerian census, the Enugu {{metropolitan}} area has an estimated population of 722,664.

The population of Enugu is predominantly Christian, as is the rest of southeastern Nigeria. Like the rest of Nigeria most people in Enugu speak Nigerian English alongside the dominant language in the region. In this case the dominant language is Igbo. Nigerian English, or pidgin (a mix of English and indigenous words) is often used because of ethnic diversity and sometimes because of the diversity of dialects in the Igbo language. <b>In</b> <b>cultural</b> and linguistic terms Enugu is within the Northern cluster of the Igbo region which includes other towns and cities like Awka and Nsukka.|$|E
