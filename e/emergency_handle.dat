5000|$|At Turnham Green, Andy {{learns that}} the train {{they need is}} due {{to be taken out}} of service due to a stag night prank wherein a man, Jim, has been {{stripped}} of his clothes and handcuffed to an armrest. The train continues due to the station supervisor being knocked out before he can take it out. Though it seems they missed the last eastbound train, Bob, an employee at the station and friend of Rolf, hands the two men their envelope and reveals that the train they were just on is the last train. They quickly run to it, but realise that Jim will delay them. The train halts at Kew Gardens due to someone - Jim - pulling the <b>emergency</b> <b>handle,</b> though Andy and Brian quickly shrug this off and the train carries on. The three men celebrate Andy and Brian's [...] "victory".|$|E
40|$|This paper aims to {{identify}} China's Generation Y's (Gen Y) preference toward joining group package tour (GPT) when traveling abroad and explore their expectations {{on a number}} of service attributes. Six service attribute dimensions were identified through factor analysis, including: group leader/local guide(s), optional tour and shopping arrangement, safety, cleanness, and comfortableness, accommodation, activities, and shopping length and frequency. This study confirmed the importance of group leader/local guide(s) with a special emphasis on their honesty. It is found that current group and non-group travelers of Gen Y shared similar expectations on six service feature dimensions, while having different expectations on four service attributes: food hygiene, tour leader's <b>emergency</b> <b>handle</b> ability, Chinese food offering, and park as attraction choice. Results also showed that potential group travelers had higher concern over the factor of group leader/local guide(s) than non-group travelers. School of Hotel and Tourism Managemen...|$|E
30|$|Fortunately, the IEEE 802.15. 4 {{standard}} reserves {{a guaranteed}} time slot called GTS {{for future use}} [4]. However, there is no reliable support for on demand and emergency traffic. Thus, the pure concept of superframe structure of 802.15. 4 {{cannot be applied to}} <b>emergency</b> data <b>handling.</b> Other proposals for the <b>emergency</b> <b>handling</b> are basically based on the CSMA/CA mechanism in BAN. Their medium is radio signal whose frequencies might be 400 [*]M or 2.4 [*]GHz and network range is purposed to be up to 5 meters. But HBC network uses human body as medium of 10 ~ 30 [*]MHz frequencies and its PHY layer does not support carrier-sense capability. The MAC approach is totally different, and so is the <b>emergency</b> <b>handling.</b> Complete list of MAC technical requirements are derived from the approval of TG 6 technical requirement document [5]. The documents mandate emergency management capabilities for the IEEE 802.15. 6 specification. The specification must support alarm state notification across BAN in less than 1 second and must provide prioritization mechanisms for emergency traffic and notification. In this work, we proposed specific <b>emergency</b> <b>handling</b> operation for HBC-MAC to meet emergency requirements of BAN.|$|R

40|$|The current <b>emergency</b> <b>handling</b> {{services}} are cumbersome; a caller needs to dial 999 {{in order to}} report an emergency. In most occasions civilians are urged to call an emergency centers, which normally not remembered by many. The distance between the occurrence of the incident and the center remains as the major aspect for instant assistance. An assistance may not able to reach at soonest time if caller fail to describe his/her exact location. Worst of all the current system hinders handicapped from reporting an emergency. The advancement in wireless technology and infrastructure has amplified the usage of cell phone in our lives, therefore a location-based ah hoc <b>emergency</b> <b>handling</b> system is a value-add to the 999 service. This research studies the issues in providing an <b>emergency</b> <b>handling</b> system (EHS), which deploys location based technology that will detect {{the location of a}} caller and connect to database server that store required data. The system enable user to forward distress message either to police station, rescue team, hospital and etc. The professional application checks an emergency message, view location of an incident and respond to an emergency request. The system employs CGI+TA technique in determining the locations of caller and the nearest professional within the incident vicinity. In addition, every message that is transmitted through the network in encrypted and authenticated to ensure integrity and authenticity of an emergency call. This research shows that EHS has several advantages over current emergency services, and beneficial to handicapped...|$|R
30|$|In this work, we {{proposed}} a specific <b>emergency</b> <b>handling</b> operation for HBC-MAC using EGTS to meet the emergency requirements from IEEE 802.15. 6 BAN. Because EGTS is too expensive and wasteful for the low data rate emergency, we showed the adequate number of emergency slots to reduce overhead. We formulated ETGS rate factor according to the guaranteed low latency of emergency data.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The paper {{presents}} selected {{technical and}} regulatory aspects of <b>emergency</b> call <b>handling</b> in communication between citizens and authorities {{in case of}} distress. Among the most important technical aspects of <b>emergency</b> call <b>handling</b> are recognition and treatment of emergency call by originating network, routing of such call to the appropriate public safety answering point (PSAP), delivering call-related information to the PSAP as well as architecture and organization of PSAPs. From the legal point of view, of importance are the obligations for the Member States and stakeholders involved in the E 112 project included in the EU directives, actions of European Commission related to providing access to the location information as well as obligations concerning <b>emergency</b> call <b>handling</b> included in Polish national law.

50|$|The primary {{advantage}} of using an RSL is a faster reserve parachute deployment compared with using <b>emergency</b> <b>handles</b> alone; after a cut-away, the RSL will usually activate before the reserve deployment ripcord is pulled. However, proper emergency procedures require the reserve ripcord {{to be pulled}} {{in the event that}} the RSL is disconnected or not functioning correctly. An RSL also offers protection in the event a jumper cuts-away but does not (or can not) reach for the reserve deployment handle.|$|R

30|$|The {{human body}} {{communication}} (HBC) is {{a technology that}} enables short range data communication using the human body as a medium, like an electrical wire. Thus it removes {{the need for a}} traditional antenna. HBC may be used as a type of data communication in body area network (BAN), while the devices are being in contact with body. One of important issues in BAN is an emergency alarm because it may be closely related to human life. For emergency data communication, the most critical factor is the time constraint. IEEE 802.15. 6 specifies that the emergency alarm for the BAN must be notified in less than 1 [*]sec and must provide prioritization mechanisms for emergency traffic and notification. As one type of BAN, the HBC must follow this recommendation, too. Existing <b>emergency</b> <b>handling</b> methods in BAN are based on the carrier sensing capability on radio frequencies to detect the status of channels. However, PHY protocol in HBC does not provide the carrier sensing. So the previous methods are not well suitable for HBC directly. Additionally, in the environment that the emergency rate is very low, the allocation of dedicated slot(s) for emergency in each superframe is very wasteful. In this work, we proposed specific <b>emergency</b> <b>handling</b> operation for human body communication's medium access control (HBC-MAC) protocol to meet the emergency requirements for BAN. We also showed the optimal number of emergency slots for the various combinations of beacon intervals and emergency rates.|$|R

All twin engine aircraft are designed to sustain a safe flight even if one of the engines has failed or is switched off due to any abnormality provided the <b>emergency</b> <b>handling</b> procedures are correctly followed. Similarly, Beechcraft 1900C also had the capability to sustain safe flight with single engine operation. This suggests that pilot error maybe the main cause of the accident.|$|R

As a consequence, energy-efficient and secure group communication must be a prior concern for MANETs to ease these rigorous security threats.|$|R
