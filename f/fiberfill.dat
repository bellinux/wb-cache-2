5|$|Rura Penthe {{was created}} {{with a mixture}} of on-set and {{location}} shots, along with an establishing sequence created by Matte World. The characters were shot on a San Francisco beach, with a white plastic underfoot. Sun elements were layered onto the shot along with a double-exposed snow effect. Additional passes were made on <b>fiberfill</b> clouds with lights behind them to create a lightning storm underway in the background.|$|E
25|$|Quilted fabric : Sleepers are {{occasionally}} {{made from}} a quilted fabric, incorporating {{a thin layer of}} polyester <b>fiberfill</b> batting for increased warmth. Quilted sleepers using polyester foam as insulation were also made in the 1950s.|$|E
5000|$|Synthetic <b>Fiberfill</b> such as {{polyester}} fiber is used similarly to down, {{but does not}} have as good a warmth:weight ratio. However, it is less expensive, provides better insulation when wet, dries quickly, and absorbs very little moisture. There are brands of very fine <b>fiberfill</b> like Thinsulate, PrimaLoft or Thermolite, that provides higher warmth for a given thickness.|$|E
50|$|Economic and {{environmental}} factors favor use of a thermoplastic matrix but due to the high viscosity of melts {{it is difficult to}} achieve high productivity and high quality of <b>fiberfills</b> impregnation with this type of matrix.|$|R

50|$|Early {{mattresses}} {{contained a}} variety of natural materials including straw, feathers or horse hair. In {{the first half of}} the 20th century, a typical mattress sold in North America had an innerspring core and cotton batting or <b>fiberfill.</b> Modern mattresses usually contain either an inner spring core or materials such as latex, viscoelastic or other flexible polyurethane foams. Other fill components include insulator pads over the coils that prevent the bed's upholstery layers from cupping down into the innerspring, as well as polyester <b>fiberfill</b> in the bed's top upholstery layers. In 1899 James Marshall introduced the first individually wrapped pocketed spring coil mattress now commonly known as Marshall coils.|$|E

5000|$|Leather {{is added}} {{on all sides}} of the tree to create the seat, flaps and panels. Cowhide is usually used, though pigskin and other leathers are also seen. The panels on the {{underside}} of the saddle traditionally are stuffed with wool flock, which is still preferred and used on the highest quality saddles. Synthetic materials, including foam and <b>fiberfill</b> materials, are used on more moderately priced saddles, and one company currently sells a design that uses airtight sealed panels that are inflated with air.|$|E
5000|$|Drop Stop is {{constructed}} out of black Neoprene filled with polyester <b>fiberfill</b> {{and is about}} 17 inches long. [...] It has a slot sewn into it where the seat belt latch can fit through. This anchors the device, allowing the car seat to slide back-and-forth freely. [...] According to Newburger and Simon, {{the space between the}} center console and the front seats is always in dark shadow and thus the black color of Drop Stop matches any car's interior. Provided the gap between a car's center console and seat is less than 3.5 inches, Drop Stop should fit. However, some cars, for example the BMW M3 and Volkswagen Jetta, don’t have enough space in the gap to fit the Drop Stop in place.|$|E
40|$|Randomly {{entangled}} fibers forming loosely bound nonwoven {{structures are}} evaluated {{for use in}} lightweight armor applications. These materials sacrifice volumetric efficiency in order to realize a reduction in mass versus traditional armor materials, while maintaining equivalent ballistic performance. The primary material characterized, polyester <b>fiberfill,</b> is shown to have improved ballistic performance over control samples of monolithic polyester as well as 1095 steel sheets. The response of <b>fiberfill</b> is investigated {{at a variety of}} strain rates, from quasistatic to ballistic, under compression, tension, and shear deformation to elucidate mechanisms at work during ballistic defeat. Fiberfill’s primary mechanisms during loading are fiber reorientation, fiber unfurling, and frictional sliding. Frictional sliding, coupled with high macroscopic strain to failure, is thought to be the source of the high specific ballistic performance in <b>fiberfill</b> materials. The proposed armor is tested for penetration resistance against spherical and cylindrical 7. 62 mm projectiles fired from a gas gun. A constitutive model incorporating the relevant deformation mechanisms of texture evolution and progressive damage is developed and implemented in Abaqus explicit in order to expedite further research on ballistic nonwoven fabrics...|$|E
30|$|There {{are several}} major {{application}} areas for the PET textile industry, such as staple fibers, filament, nonwoven fabric and <b>fiberfill.</b> Generally, recycled PET has been utilized for fibers {{of more than}} 6 denier, while the largest market for the PET fiber industry (clothing and apparel applications) is in the 1.5 - 3 denier range. A novel processing technology was developed in 1993, which enabled recycled PET {{to be used in}} fibers much finer than 3 denier, and this fiber obtained from recycled PET has been commercialized (Scheirs 1998). These fibers require high-quality feedstock, and postconsumer PET flakes used for these fibers should have consistent intrinsic viscosity around 0.7 dlg− 1.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{large amount}} of {{disposable}} bottles presently produced makes the search for alternative products that reuse these materials imperative. Wood-plastic composites are sustainable, organic materials, that show potential {{for the development of}} environmentally friendly products. This paper presents the optimization of tensile and flexural strength of a wood-plastic composite made from polyethylene-terephthalate, as thermoplastic resin, and sawdust as <b>fiberfill.</b> The goal {{of this study was to}} establish the operating conditions that provide the optimum properties of the wood-plastic composites, with minimal variance. The particle size of the fiber filler was taken as a noise factor. The response surface methodology, by contour lines, in a combined design of experiment was applied...|$|E
30|$|Traditionally, {{recycled}} PET has {{not been}} widely used for filament production because of contaminants leading to breakage of the filament. Melt filtration of the PET is carried out to achieve high quality of the resin. Nonwoven fabrics, used as filters and absorbents, are prepared by spun bounding technology. In the production of recycled PET, nonwoven, cleaned PET bottle flake is dried, crystallized and incorporated into the extruder. The melt-spun filaments are spread and distributed on a screen belt under strong vacuum, and the fibrous materials are compressed into a mat for web-forming. <b>Fiberfill</b> is utilized for various applications such as filling materials and insulant in sleeping bags, pillows, and bedding. These applications allow the use of colored PET flake and require PET with intrinsic viscosity {{in the range of}} 0.58 - 0.65 dlg− 1.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this project was to develop inexpen-sive, portable, anthropomorphic ultrasound phantoms that can be readily reproduced for use in sonography education programs. Hydrophilic organic polymer, wa-ter, polyester <b>fiberfill,</b> latex and nylon tubing {{have been used to}} construct prototype phantoms of a pediatric upper and lower abdomen, adult female pelvis, and adult neck regions. A nontoxic, biodegradable, hydro-philic organic polymer in a 1 : 12 ratio with water pro-duced suitable primary construction media. Images ob-tained of the prototype phantoms were judged by experienced sonographers to adequately simulate hu-man ultrasonic images. The sound propagation speed through the organic polymer was equivalent to that of soft tissue. Using this technique, sonographic imaging in representative human body regions may be simu-lated using inexpensive organic polymer and consumer products. Phantom portability and ease of construction facilitates use of this design for demonstrations and hands-on scanning exercises within sonography educa-tion programs...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this article is}} to carry out a comparative study of the main hygrothermal properties of five thermal insulation materials for buildings. These properties are necessary for a correct prediction of heat and moisture transfers through the walls and the selection of the most appropriate materials according to the specific buildings. The studied materials were glass wool, rock wool, expanded polystyrene, wood fiberboard and polyester <b>fiberfill.</b> The article is divided into three parts. The first part presents the phenomena of hygrothermal transfers in walls in order to understand the need for determining specific properties of the insulating materials. The second part describes in details the five studied insulating materials and the methods used for the characterization and identification of their main properties. Finally, the last part presents the experimental results and makes comparisons between materials. The differences between the insulating materials are brought out, such as the strong dependence of the thermal conductivity of polystyrene on temperature, or the good permeability of fibrous insulating materials to water vapor. A detailed analysis of the obtained results is presented...|$|E
30|$|The {{study focused}} on kapok [Ceiba pentandra (L.) Gaertn.] fruit as a biomass for {{effective}} utilization. Kapok fruits were harvested just before full maturation at the campus of University of the Philippines Los Banos and in southern Vietnam. The kapok fibers are utilized locally as <b>fiberfill</b> in pillows, quilts, and some soft toys. Kapok fiber was isolated and analyzed microscopically, and the physicochemical properties were determined by spectroscopic methods. Some tests were done to determine the effective utilization of kapok fiber. Microscopic analysis of the higher structure of kapok fiber gave quite different results from cotton fiber, which has a significantly homogeneous hollow tube shape and is composed of cellulose (35 % dry fiber), xylan (22 %), and lignin (21.5 %). Kapok fiber is characterized by having {{a high level of}} acetyl groups (13.0 %). Usually cell walls of plants contain about 1 %– 2 % of acetyl groups attached to noncellulosic polysaccharides. Kapok fiber is significantly hydrophobic and does not get wet with water. Thus, the absorptivity of oil was tested. The fiber selectively absorbed significant amounts of oil (40 g/g of fiber) from an oil suspension in freshwater and seawater. It is suggested that this fiber could be used to recover oil spilled in seawater.|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{is devoted to}} problems of heat transfer in a multicomponent body with anisotropic thermal properties, such as polymer composite materials with <b>fiberfill</b> and other layered systems. Aim: The {{aim of this study}} is the determination of a temperature gradient on a heating surface and the heat transfer evaluation between components of a simulated body. Materials and Methods: Analytical modeling methods are complicated by very laborious computations due to an anisotropy of composites structure and properties. Numerical simulation methods have a wide tool package, which allows to avoid many assumptions, to reduce computation time and visualize conclusions. Results: In the paper discussed a thermal field formation of the annular heat source in plane and space dimensions, that allows to evaluate the process of thermal development in single layer of material and in their connecting. Presented results of numerical modeling establish locations of maximum and minimum temperature of the heated body. Thermophysical body anisotropy leads to asymmetrical distribution of heat. Clearly expressed undulating temperature profile was detected on the heated surface, moreover, temperature in some sectors of outermost layer significantly exceeds the average temperature of the heated surface. The existence of the described temperature gradient has been confirmed in the previous experimental study of the author. In order to simplify a structure of the model and reduce computation time for following or similar tasks has adopted an attempt to translate the anisotropic body to isotropic by adjusting of thermal properties. The resulting isotropic model has a high degree of correlation to the original, but it is less informative and should be corrected by special coefficients...|$|E
