5|$|Other {{economists and}} analysts {{have argued that}} the {{underground}} economy would continue to bear the same tax burden as before. They state that replacing the current tax system with a consumption tax would not change the tax revenue generated from the underground economy—while <b>illicit</b> income is not taxed directly, spending of income from <b>illicit</b> activity results in business income and wages that are taxed.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. Supreme Court disagreed, {{finding that}} {{cannabis}} grown within California for medical purposes is indistinguishable from <b>illicit</b> marijuana. Moreover, because the intrastate medical cannabis market {{contributes to the}} interstate <b>illicit</b> marijuana market, the Commerce Clause applies. Even where California citizens are using medical cannabis in compliance with state law, those individuals and businesses can still be prosecuted by federal authorities for violating federal law.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to his public image, Rose was not a heavy drug user, {{though he did not}} disavow the use of <b>illicit</b> substances entirely.|$|E
5|$|Piracy—both <b>illicit</b> {{in ancient}} Cilicia and China and state-supported among the Cretans, Vikings, Japanese, English, and Berbers—has {{remained}} a problem {{into the present}} day, given the expense involved in securely protecting every merchant vessel or in policing extensive coastlines.|$|E
5|$|Since 1988, {{hydrochloric}} acid has been {{listed as a}} Table II precursor under the 1988 United Nations Convention Against <b>Illicit</b> Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances because of its use {{in the production of}} heroin, cocaine, and methamphetamine.|$|E
5|$|Since its founding, {{ethnic groups}} in the city have {{clustered}} in enclaves in north, south and downtown Omaha. In its early days, the sometimes lawless nature of a new frontier city included crime, such as <b>illicit</b> gambling and riots.|$|E
5|$|Since the Links' deployment, {{there have}} been several {{concerns}} about the kiosks' features. Privacy advocates have stated that the data of LinkNYC users can be collected and used to track users' movements throughout the city. There are also concerns with cybercriminals possibly hijacking the Links, or renaming their personal wireless networks to the same name as LinkNYC's network, in order to steal LinkNYC users' data. In addition, prior to September 2016, the tablets of the Links could be used to browse the Internet. In summer 2016, concerns arose about the Link tablets' browsers being used for <b>illicit</b> purposes; despite the implementation of content filters on the kiosks, the <b>illicit</b> activities continued, and the browsers were disabled.|$|E
5|$|Taptasurmi/Taptamurti (red-hot iron statue): A man {{or woman}} who indulges in <b>illicit</b> sexual {{relations}} with a woman or man is beaten by whips and forced to embrace red-hot iron figurines of the opposite sex.|$|E
5|$|A strong {{advocate}} of prohibition of alcohol, especially among Native Americans and First Nations peoples, Belcourt petitioned the US Congress {{to prevent the}} <b>illicit</b> trafficking of liquor from Canada into the United States. In March 1859, Belcourt left North Dakota to return to Canada.|$|E
5|$|Articles 41 and 68 of the {{constitution}} empower the sovereign to withhold royal assent from bills adopted by the Legislative Assembly. In 2010, the kingdom moved towards greater democracy, with King George Tupou V saying {{that he would be}} guided by his prime minister in the exercising of his powers. Nonetheless, this does not preclude an independent royal decision to exercise a right of veto. In November 2011, the assembly adopted an Arms and Ammunitions (Amendment) Bill, which reduced the possible criminal sentences for the <b>illicit</b> possession of firearms. The bill was adopted by ten votes to eight. Two members of the assembly had recently been charged with the <b>illicit</b> possession of firearms. The Prime Minister, Lord Tuʻivakanō, voted in favour of the amendment. Members of the opposition denounced the bill and asked the King to veto it, which he did in December.|$|E
5|$|During the 16th century, Bristol merchants {{concentrated}} on developing trade with Spain and its American colonies. This included the smuggling of prohibited goods, {{such as food}} and guns, to Iberia during the Anglo-Spanish War (1585–1604). Bristol's <b>illicit</b> trade grew enormously after 1558, becoming integral to its economy.|$|E
5|$|During the 1990s Michigan endured an NCAA {{violations}} scandal, {{described as}} involving {{one of the}} largest amounts of <b>illicit</b> money in NCAA history, when Ed Martin loaned four players a reported total of $616,000. Due to NCAA sanctions, records from the 1992 Final Four, the 1992–93 season, and 1995–99 seasons have been vacated. Throughout this article asterisks denote awards, records and honors that have been vacated.|$|E
5|$|During the Prohibition era, 1920 to 1933, Pittsburgh was {{a hotbed}} of bootlegging and <b>illicit</b> alcohol consumption. Several factors fed into {{resistance}} to Prohibition, including a large immigrant population, anti-establishment animosity dating to the Whiskey Rebellion, fragmented local government, and pervasive corruption. The Pittsburgh crime family controlled significant portions of the illegal alcohol trade.|$|E
5|$|<b>Illicit</b> distilleries were commonplace {{throughout}} the Speyside area from medieval times but were largely made redundant {{with the passing}} of the Excise Act in 1823. It was under this legislation that legal distilleries could be formed, subject to holding a license. Alexander Gordon, 4th Duke of Gordon, was allegedly instrumental in the passing of this legislation. Although there is no historical record of his involvement in the issue, his tenant, George Smith, who was operating an <b>illicit</b> distillery at the time, became the first person in Glenlivet to apply for and receive a license to legally produce spirit. This would prove to be an unpopular decision; every other distiller was operating illegally at the time and hoping the new Excise Act would be repealed, something which would not happen if some distillers accepted the new law. Threats were made against George Smith, so George Gordon provided Smith with two pistols to be used to ensure both his own safety and that of the distillery. In 1824, The Glenlivet distillery was established at Upper Drumin by George and his youngest son John Gordon Smith.|$|E
5|$|In 1707, the Acts of Union merged England and Scotland, and Lismore {{became part}} of the United Kingdom of Great Britain. Thereafter taxes on whisky {{distillation}} rose dramatically, and much of Scotland's distillation was either shut down or forced underground until the 1823 Excise Act provided a legal framework for the industry. The remains of at least two <b>illicit</b> stills from this period have been found on Lismore.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} work with {{scheduled}} psychoactive chemicals, Shulgin obtained a DEA Schedule I license for an analytical laboratory, which allowed him to synthesize and possess any otherwise <b>illicit</b> drug. Shulgin set up a chemical synthesis laboratory in a small building behind his house, which gave him {{a great deal of}} career autonomy. Shulgin used this freedom to synthesize and test the effects of potentially psychoactive drugs.|$|E
5|$|Larson soon {{got caught}} up in an <b>illicit</b> scheme to sell part of a foreign lottery, and he fled Ohio. His family was {{contacted}} by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, but his whereabouts were unknown until his death from throat cancer on February 16, 1999, in Apopka, Florida.|$|E
5|$|Not {{only was}} there little social stigma {{attached}} to smuggling in the colonies, but in port cities, where trade was the primary generator of wealth, smuggling enjoyed considerable community support, and it was even possible to obtain insurance against being caught. Colonial merchants developed an impressive repertoire of evasive maneuvers to conceal the origin, nationality, routes and content of their <b>illicit</b> cargoes. This included the frequent use of fraudulent paperwork to make the cargo appear legal and authorised. And much to the frustration of the British authorities, when seizures did happen local merchants were often able to use sympathetic provincial courts to reclaim confiscated goods and have their cases dismissed. For instance, Edward Randolph, the appointed head of customs in New England brought 36 seizures to trial from 1680 {{to the end of}} 1682 – and all but two of these were acquitted. Alternatively merchants sometimes took {{matters into their own hands}} and stole <b>illicit</b> goods back while impounded.|$|E
5|$|On 24 December 2010, Shanghai {{officials}} announced that three government employees {{had been taken}} into custody {{in connection with the}} fire. Those detained were accused of abusing their authority to permit <b>illicit</b> construction practices to occur. The three were reported to be Gao Weizhong, director of Jing'an's construction and transportation commission; Zhang Quan, of the commission's main office; and Zhou Jianmin, of the organization's construction department.|$|E
5|$|Possession {{and use of}} {{psilocybin}} mushrooms, {{including the}} bluing species of Psilocybe, is therefore prohibited by extension. However, in many national, state, and provincial drug laws, {{there has been a}} great deal of ambiguity about the legal status of psilocybin mushrooms, as well as a strong element of selective enforcement in some places. Most US state courts have considered the mushroom a 'container' of the <b>illicit</b> drugs, and therefore illegal. A loophole further complicates the legal situation—the spores of psilocybin mushrooms do not contain the drugs, and are legal to possess in many areas. Jurisdictions that have specifically enacted or amended laws to criminalize the possession of psilocybin mushroom spores include Germany (since 1998), and California, Georgia, and Idaho in the United States. As a consequence, there is an active underground economy involved in the sale of spores and cultivation materials, and an internet-based social network to support the <b>illicit</b> activity.|$|E
5|$|Tuberculosis {{is closely}} linked to both {{overcrowding}} and malnutrition, {{making it one of}} the principal diseases of poverty. Those at high risk thus include: people who inject <b>illicit</b> drugs, inhabitants and employees of locales where vulnerable people gather (e.g. prisons and homeless shelters), medically underprivileged and resource-poor communities, high-risk ethnic minorities, children in close contact with high-risk category patients, and health-care providers serving these patients.|$|E
5|$|A {{retrospective}} study {{carried out at}} an Auckland emergency department found that BZP presentations only made a minor contribution to their overdose database with most cases not producing any significant toxicity. Several cases where BZP individually or combined with alcohol or other medicines or <b>illicit</b> drugs resulting in complications exist. One such example is the well publicised case {{of a combination of}} BZP and MDMA by a 23-year-old from Greymouth, New Zealand. Ben Rodham, a DJ, ingested a combination of BZP and MDMA in February 2007, which nearly resulted in his death. Rodham was put into an induced coma in an effort to prevent him from dying. He later recovered.|$|E
5|$|Fleming became {{interested}} in diamond smuggling after reading an article in The Sunday Times in 1954 concerning the Sierra Leone diamond industry. Philip Brownrigg, an old friend from Eton and a senior exec of De Beers, arranged for Fleming to visit the London Diamond Club to see diamonds being sorted and polished. In 1955 Brownrigg also introduced Fleming to Sir Percy Sillitoe, former head of MI5, who was working for De Beers and investigating the <b>illicit</b> diamond trade through the International Diamond Security Organisation. Fleming met Sillitoe and used {{much of the research}} as background material for his fictional Bond novel, Diamonds Are Forever.|$|E
5|$|Freshmen were {{expected}} to build the early Bonfires to help prove their worth. For almost two decades, the students constructed Bonfire from debris and wood acquired through various, sometimes <b>illicit,</b> means, including appropriating lumber intended for a dormitory in 1912. In 1935, a farmer reported that students carried off his entire barn as fuel for Bonfire. To prevent future incidents, the university made Bonfire a school-sanctioned event. The following year, for the first time, the school provided axes, saws, and trucks for the students and pointed them toward a grove of dead trees {{on the edge of}} town.|$|E
5|$|HIV is {{typically}} transmitted through unprotected sex or intravenous drug use, {{and is often}} associated with groups such as promiscuous gay men, <b>illicit</b> drug users, and sex workers. For these reasons, and also because of fears of contagion, people living with HIV are frequently subjected to stigma and discrimination. Publicity campaigns around the world have aimed to counter HIV-related prejudices and misconceptions and to replace them with an accurate understanding that helps to prevent new infections. These efforts have been aided by various celebrities – including American basketball star Magic Johnson and South African judge Edwin Cameron – who have publicly announced that they are HIV-positive.|$|E
5|$|Horace Wadsworth, disinherited {{brother of}} New York banker Arthur Wadsworth, joins {{a gang of}} {{international}} criminals. He plots to rob his brother's bank by constructing a tunnel from the nearby home of antique dealer George Jones, who is currently {{on a trip to}} Cairo to purchase antique rugs. Horace follows him there, and, learning of the Sacred Carpet of Bagdad, joins the caravan of its sworn guardian, Mohamed. Meanwhile, Horace's confederates Major Callahan and Mrs. Chedsoye arrive in Cairo along with Mrs. Chedsoye's daughter, Fortune, who is unaware of her mother's <b>illicit</b> activities.|$|E
5|$|In 1970 the United States Congress {{repealed}} mandatory {{penalties for}} cannabis offenses and The Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act separated cannabis from other <b>illicit</b> narcotics and removed mandatory sentences {{for possession of}} small amounts of cannabis. In 1972 President Richard Nixon commissioned a comprehensive study from the National Commission on Marijuana and Drug Abuse. The Commission found that the constitutionality of cannabis prohibition was suspect and that the executive and legislative branches had a responsibility to obey the Constitution, {{even in the absence}} of a court ruling to do so. The Richard Nixon administration did not implement the study's recommendations.|$|E
5|$|In 1986 Bond and Alec Trevelyan—agent 006—infiltrate an <b>illicit</b> Soviet {{chemical}} weapons facility and plant explosive charges. Trevelyan is shot, but Bond escapes {{from the facility}} as it explodes. Nine years later, Bond witnesses the theft by criminal organisation Janus of a prototype Eurocopter Tiger helicopter that can withstand an electromagnetic pulse. Janus uses the helicopter to steal the control disk for the dual GoldenEye satellite weapons, using the GoldenEye to destroy the complex with an electromagnetic pulse; there are two survivors of the attack, a programmer, Natalya Simonova, and Boris Grishenko.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, Forbes {{magazine}} {{estimated the}} group's annual turnover at US$50 million. According {{to the police}} in Northern Ireland, the main sources of the Real IRA's funding are illegal fuel operations and various smuggling activities. <b>Illicit</b> cigarettes were also {{said to be a}} significant source of income for the group. There are also other significant sources of funding from the group, including funding from sympathisers based in the US and other countries.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to natural calamities and jiedushi amassing autonomous control, the Huang Chao Rebellion (874–884) {{resulted in the}} sacking of both Chang'an and Luoyang, and took an entire decade to suppress. Although the rebellion was defeated by the Tang, it never recovered from that crucial blow, weakening it for the future military powers to take over. There were also large groups of bandits, {{in the size of}} small armies, that ravaged the countryside {{in the last years of}} the Tang, who smuggled <b>illicit</b> salt, ambushed merchants and convoys, and even besieged several walled cities.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, Roddenberry was likely afflicted {{by the first}} manifestations of {{cerebral}} vascular disease and encephalopathy {{as a result of}} his longstanding recreational use of legal and <b>illicit</b> drugs, including alcohol, cannabis, diazepam, secobarbital, methaqualone, methylphenidate, Dexamyl, and cocaine (which he had used regularly since the production of Star Trek: The Motion Picture). Throughout much of his career, he had routinely used stimulants to work through the night on scripts, especially amphetamines. The effects of these substances were compounded by deleterious interactions with diabetes, high blood pressure, and antidepressant prescriptions.|$|E
5|$|It {{has long}} been {{suspected}} that pre-Columbian Mesoamericans used a toxic secretion produced by the cane toad as a hallucinogen, but more likely they used substances secreted by the Colorado River toad (Bufo alvarius). These contain bufotenin (5-MeO-DMT), a psychoactive compound {{that has been used}} in modern times as a recreational drug. Typically, the skin secretions are dried and then smoked. <b>Illicit</b> drug use by licking the skin of a toad has been reported in the media, but this may be an urban myth.|$|E
5|$|Medical {{complications}} {{are associated}} with a bad prognosis. Examples are hypotension (low blood pressure), hypoxia (low blood oxygen saturation), lower cerebral perfusion pressures and longer times spent with high intracranial pressures. Patient characteristics also influence prognosis. Factors thought to worsen it include abuse of substances such as <b>illicit</b> drugs and alcohol and age over sixty or under two years (in children, younger age at time of injury may be associated with a slower recovery of some abilities). Other influences that may affect recovery include pre-injury intellectual ability, coping strategies, personality traits, family environment, social support systems and financial circumstances.|$|E
5|$|On June 27, 2017, {{a heavily}} {{modified}} version of Petya was used for a global cyberattack primarily targeting Ukraine. This version had been modified to propagate using the same EternalBlue exploit that was used by WannaCry. Due to another design change, it is also unable to actually unlock a system after the ransom is paid; this led to security analysts speculating that the attack {{was not meant to}} generate <b>illicit</b> profit, but to simply cause disruption.|$|E
5|$|On October 28, 2016, Comey {{notified}} Congress {{that the}} FBI started looking into newly discovered emails. Law enforcement officials stated while investigating allegedly <b>illicit</b> text messages from Anthony Weiner husband of Clinton aide Huma Abedin, to a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina, they discovered e-mails related to Clinton's private server on {{a laptop computer}} belonging to Anthony Weiner. On November 6, Comey notified Congress that the FBI had not changed its conclusion reached in July. The notification was later cited by Clinton {{as a factor in}} her loss in the 2016 presidential election.|$|E
5|$|Shiina, {{given name}} unknown, {{otherwise}} {{referred to by}} his nickname , is another adult friend of Shuichi and Yoshino. He was Yuki's classmate in elementary school, and he eventually became her boyfriend after her transition. Unlike Yuki, Shiina had many friends in school. He generally just watches over Shuichi and Yoshino with Yuki, but he sometimes does bold and unexpected things, such as grabbing Yoshino's crotch when he first meets Yoshino because he feared that, because Yoshino was dressed as a boy at the time, Yuki might be having an <b>illicit</b> affair with Yoshino.|$|E
