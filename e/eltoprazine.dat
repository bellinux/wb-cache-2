50|$|Fluprazine (DU-27,716) {{is a drug}} of the phenylpiperazine class. It is a {{so-called}} serenic or antiaggressive agent. It {{is closely related to}} several other piperazines, including <b>eltoprazine</b> and batoprazine, and TFMPP, as well as more distantly to the azapirones such as buspirone.

50|$|The {{recreational}} drug MDMA ("ecstasy") {{and a variety}} of related drugs have been described as empathogen-entactogens, or simply as entactogens. These agents possess serenic and empathy-increasing properties in addition to their euphoriant effects, and have been associated with increased sociability, friendliness, and feelings of closeness to others as well as emotional empathy and prosocial behavior. The entactogenic effects of these drugs are thought to be related to their ability to temporarily increase the levels of certain brain chemicals, including serotonin, dopamine, and, particularly, oxytocin. Certain other serotonergic drugs, such as 5-HT1A receptor agonists, also increase oxytocin levels and may possess serenic properties as well. The phenylpiperazine mixed 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptor agonists <b>eltoprazine,</b> fluprazine, and batoprazine have been described based on animal research as serenics.|$|E
40|$|<b>Eltoprazine,</b> a {{drug that}} had {{previously}} been developed for aggression, has recently been investigated for L‑DOPA‑induced dyskinesia in animal models of Parkinson´s disease (PD) and in dyskinetic PD patients.

Indeed, the pharmacological profile of <b>eltoprazine</b> might suggest its effects on anxiety and food intake, but also adverse effect potential, which is the focus of the present study. Given for 2 weeks either as infusion or as twice‑daily treatment, <b>eltoprazine</b> produced a decrease in food intake and body weight at doses leading to 200 – 500 nM plasma concentrations. In the elevated plus maze <b>eltoprazine</b> increased anxiety‑like behavior. On the other hand, it induced a clear‑cut anxiolytic effect in context fear conditioning test starting at ca. 0. 3 mg/kg, and failed to produce any significant effect in fear potentiated startle test. Regarding adverse effects, <b>eltoprazine</b> was found to produce hypothermia starting from 1 mg/kg. At similar doses it also increased locomotion in the open field. However, <b>eltoprazine</b> failed to affect acquisition in context fear conditioning paradigm, which may indicate lack of its detrimental effect on learning at the doses tested (i. e., up to 5 mg/kg). In summary, effects of <b>eltoprazine</b> in different anxiety tests were equivocal while its effect on body weight seems robust and requires further investigation.

40|$|In {{advanced}} {{stages of}} Parkinson's disease, serotonergic terminals take up l-DOPA and convert it to dopamine. Abnormally released dopamine may {{participate in the}} development of l-DOPA-induced dyskinesias. Simultaneous activation of 5 -HT 1 A and 5 -HT 1 B receptors effectively blocks l-DOPA-induced dyskinesias in animal models of dopamine depletion, justifying a clinical study with <b>eltoprazine,</b> a 5 -HT 1 A/B receptor agonist, against l-DOPA-induced dyskinesias in patients with Parkinson's disease. A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled and dose-finding phase I/IIa study was conducted. Single oral treatment with placebo or <b>eltoprazine,</b> at 2. 5, 5 and 7. 5 mg, was tested in combination with a suprathreshold dose of l-DOPA (Sinemet®) in 22 patients with Parkinson's disease (16 male/six female; 66. 6 ± 8. 8 years old) with l-DOPA-induced dyskinesias. A Wilcoxon Signed Ranked Test was used to compare each <b>eltoprazine</b> dose level to paired randomized placebo on the prespecified primary efficacy variables; area under the curve scores on Clinical Dyskinesia Rating Scale for 3 h post-dose and maximum change of Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part III for 3 h post-dose. Secondary objectives included effects on maximum Clinical Dyskinesia Rating Scale score, area under the curve of Rush Dyskinesia Rating Scale score for 3 h post-dose, mood parameters measured by Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale and Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale along with the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability profile of <b>eltoprazine.</b> A mixed model repeated measures was used for post hoc analyses of the area under the curve and peak Clinical Dyskinesia Rating Scale scores. It was found that serum concentrations of <b>eltoprazine</b> increased in a dose-proportional manner. Following levodopa challenge, 5 mg <b>eltoprazine</b> caused a significant reduction of l-DOPA-induced dyskinesias on area under the curves of Clinical Dyskinesia Rating Scale [- 1. 02 (1. 49); P = 0. 004] and Rush Dyskinesia Rating Scale [- 0. 15 (0. 23); P = 0. 003]; and maximum Clinical Dyskinesia Rating Scale score [- 1. 14 (1. 59); P = 0. 005]. The post hoc analysis confirmed these results and also showed an antidyskinetic effect of 7. 5 mg <b>eltoprazine.</b> Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part III scores did not differ between the placebo and <b>eltoprazine</b> treatments. The most frequent adverse effects after <b>eltoprazine</b> were nausea and dizziness. It can be concluded that a single dose, oral treatment with <b>eltoprazine</b> has beneficial antidyskinetic effects without altering normal motor responses to l-DOPA. All doses of <b>eltoprazine</b> were well tolerated, with no major adverse effects. <b>Eltoprazine</b> has a favourable risk-benefit and pharmacokinetic profile in patients with Parkinson's disease.

40|$|The 5 -HT 1 A/ 1 B-receptor agonist <b>eltoprazine</b> has a {{behavioral}} drug signature that {{resembles that of}} a variety of psychostimulant drugs, despite the differences in receptor binding profile. These psychostimulants are effective in treating impulsivity disorders, most likely because they increase norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA) levels in the prefrontal cortex. Both amphetamine and methylphenidate, however, also increase dopamine levels in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), which has a significant role in motivation, pleasure, and reward. How <b>eltoprazine</b> affects monoamine release in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and the NAc is unknown. It is also unknown whether <b>eltoprazine</b> affects different forms of impulsivity and brain reward mechanisms. Therefore, in the present study, we investigate the effects of <b>eltoprazine</b> in rats in the following sequence: 1) the activity of the monoaminergic systems using in vivo microdialysis, 2) motivation for reward measured using the intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) procedure, and finally, 3) "waiting" impulsivity in the delay-aversion task, and the "stopping" impulsivity in the stop-signal task. The microdialysis studies clearly showed that <b>eltoprazine</b> increased DA and NE release in both the mPFC and OFC, but only increased DA concentration in the NAc. In contrast, <b>eltoprazine</b> decreased 5 -HT release in the mPFC and NAc (undetectable in the OFC). Remarkably, <b>eltoprazine</b> decreased impulsive choice, but increased impulsive action. Furthermore, brain stimulation was less rewarding following <b>eltoprazine</b> treatment. These results further support the long-standing hypothesis that "waiting" and "stopping" impulsivity are regulated by distinct neural circuits, because 5 -HT 1 A/ 1 B-receptor activation decreases impulsive choice, but increases impulsive action...|$|E
40|$|Background. Pre{{clinical}} {{and clinical}} {{evidence that the}} serotonergic system {{plays a major role}} in levodopa-induced dyskinesias has been provided. Selective serotonin (5 -hydroxytryptamine, 5 -HT) 5 -HT 1 A or 5 -HT 1 B receptor agonists, and, very recently, the mixed 5 -HT 1 A/ 5 -HT 1 B receptor agonist <b>eltoprazine,</b> proved effective in inhibiting levodopa-induced dyskinesias in experimental animals and parkinsonian patients. Here we investigate the mechanisms underlying this effect. Methods. Microdialysis was employed in 6 -hydroxydopamine hemilesioned rats chronically treated with levodopa alone or in combination with <b>eltoprazine.</b> Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate levels were monitored ON levodopa in the dopamine-depleted striatum and ipsilateral substantia nigra reticulata. Motor activity on the rotarod was assessed, both OFF and ON levodopa. Western blot was used to quantify ex-vivo striatal levels of phosphorylated extracellular signal regulated kinase 1 and 2. Striatal and nigral amino acid levels, as well as striatal dopamine levels were also monitored in levodopa-primed dyskinetic rats acutely challenged with levodopa and <b>eltoprazine.</b> Results. <b>Eltoprazine</b> attenuated the development and expression of dyskinesias, preserving motor coordination on the rotarod. <b>Eltoprazine</b> prevented the rise of nigral amino acids and striatal glutamate levels, as well as the increase in striatal phosphorylated extracellular signal regulated kinase 1 and 2, associated with dyskinesias. However, <b>eltoprazine</b> did not affect the levodopa-induced increase in striatal dopamine. Conclusions. <b>Eltoprazine</b> inhibits the sensitization of striato-nigral medium-sized gamma-aminobutyric acid spiny neurons (the direct pathway) to levodopa and their overactivation associated with dyskinesias appearance. Activation of 5 -HT 1 A and 5 -HT 1 B receptors regulating striatal glutamate transmission but not striatal ectopic dopamine release might underlie the symptomatic effect of <b>eltoprazine...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{serotonin}} (5 -hydroxytryptamine [5 HT]) {{system has}} recently {{emerged as an}} important player in the appearance of l- 3, 4 -dihydroxyphenylalanine (levodopa [l-dopa]) -induced dyskinesia in animal models of Parkinson's disease. In fact, dopamine released as a false transmitter from serotonin neurons appears {{to contribute to the}} pulsatile stimulation of dopamine receptors, leading to the appearance of the abnormal involuntary movements. Thus, drugs able to dampen the activity of serotonin neurons hold promise for the treatment of dyskinesia. The authors investigated the ability of the mixed 5 -HT 1 A/ 1 B receptor agonist <b>eltoprazine</b> to counteract l-dopa-induced dyskinesia in 6 -hydroxydopamine-lesioned rats and in 1 -methyl- 4 -phenyl- 1, 2, 3, 6 -tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) -treated macaques. The data demonstrated that <b>eltoprazine</b> is extremely effective in suppressing dyskinesia in experimental models, although this effect was accompanied by a partial worsening of the therapeutic effect of l-dopa. Interestingly, <b>eltoprazine</b> was found to (synergistically) potentiate the antidyskinetic effect of amantadine. The current data indicated that <b>eltoprazine</b> is highly effective in counteracting dyskinesia in preclinical models. However, the partial worsening of the l-dopa effect observed after <b>eltoprazine</b> administration represents a concern; whether this side effect is due to a limitation of the animal models or to an intrinsic property of <b>eltoprazine</b> needs to be addressed in ongoing clinical trials. The data also suggest that the combination of low doses of <b>eltoprazine</b> with amantadine may represent a valid strategy to increase the antidyskinetic effect and reduce the eltoprazine-induced worsening of l-dopa therapeutic effects...|$|E
40|$|Selective {{activation}} of 5 -HT 1 receptors {{has been shown}} to produce near to full suppression of l-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID) in animal models of Parkinson's disease; however, a reduction of the therapeutic effect of l-DOPA has been reported in several studies. Conversely, we recently found that increasing the serotonergic tone with chronic administration of the serotonin precursor 5 -hydroxy-tryptophan (5 -HTP) can reduce LID in 6 -OHDA-lesioned rats, without affecting l-DOPA efficacy. To directly compare the effects of selective versus non-selective serotonin receptor activation, here we first tested different acute doses of the 5 -HT 1 A/ 1 B receptor agonist <b>eltoprazine</b> and 5 -HTP on LID in order to identify doses of the individual compounds showing similar anti-dyskinetic efficacy in l-DOPA-primed dyskinetic rats. About 50 % reduction of LID was observed with 0. 1 mg/kg and 24 mg/kg of <b>eltoprazine</b> and 5 -HTP, respectively; we then compared the effect of the two drugs, individually and in combination, on l-DOPA-induced stepping test in l-DOPA-naïve parkinsonian animals and LID over three weeks of l-DOPA treatment. Results showed that <b>eltoprazine</b> induced significant worsening of l-DOPA-mediated performance in the stepping test, while 5 -HTP did not. Interestingly, combination of 5 -HTP with <b>eltoprazine</b> prevented the reduction in the forelimb use induced by <b>eltoprazine.</b> Moreover, 5 -HTP and <b>eltoprazine</b> given individually showed similar efficacy also upon chronic treatment, and had additive effect in dampening the appearance of LID when given in combination. Finally, chronic administration of <b>eltoprazine</b> and/or 5 -HTP did not affect striatal serotonin innervation, compared to l-DOPA alone, as measured by serotonin transporter expression...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{serotonin}} 5 -HT 1 A/ 1 B {{receptor agonist}} <b>eltoprazine</b> suppressed dyskinetic-like behavior in animal models of Parkinson's disease (PD) but simultaneously reduced levodopa (l-dopa) -induced motility. Moreover, adenosine A 2 A receptor antagonists, such as preladenant, significantly increased l-dopa efficacy in PD without exacerbating dyskinetic-like behavior. Objectives: We evaluated whether {{a combination of}} <b>eltoprazine</b> and preladenant may prevent or suppress l-dopa-induced dyskinesia, without impairing l-dopa's efficacy in relieving motor signs, in 2 PD models: unilateral 6 -hydroxydopamine-lesioned rats and 1 -methyl- 4 -phenyl- 1, 2, 3, 6 -tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) -treated monkeys. Methods: Rotational behavior and abnormal involuntary movements, or disability and l-dopa-induced dyskinesia were evaluated in 6 -hydroxydopamine-lesioned rats and MPTP-treated monkeys, respectively. Moreover, in the rodent striatum, induction of immediate-early gene zif- 268, an index of long-term changes, was correlated with dyskinesia. Results: In 6 -hydroxydopamine-lesioned rats, combined administration of l-dopa (4 mg/kg) plus <b>eltoprazine</b> (0. 6 mg/kg) plus preladenant (0. 3 mg/kg) significantly prevented or reduced dyskinetic-like behavior without impairing motor activity. Zif- 268 was increased in the striatum of rats treated with l-dopa and l-dopa plus preladenant compared with vehicle. In contrast, rats treated with <b>eltoprazine</b> (with or without preladenant) had lower zif- 268 activation after chronic treatment in both the dyskinetic and l-dopa-non-primed groups. Moreover, acute l-dopa plus <b>eltoprazine</b> plus preladenant prevented worsening of motor performance (adjusting step) and sensorimotor integration deficit. Similar results were obtained in MPTP-treated monkeys, where a combination of preladenant with <b>eltoprazine</b> was found to counteract dyskinesia and maintain the full therapeutic effects of a low dose of l-dopa.

However, in terms of selectivity of the antiaggressive effects as determined by the absence of decrements in social interest and general motor activity, alnespirone appeared to be superior. In the defensive aggression test, neither alnespirone nor any of the other four agonists changed defensive behaviors in the intruder rats. The involvement of 5 -HT 1 A receptors in the antiaggressive actions of these drugs was confirmed by showing that the selective 5 -HT 1 A receptor antagonist WAY- 100635 (N-[2 -[4 -(2 -methoxyphenyl) - 1 -piperazinyl]ethyl]-N-(2 -pyridinyl) cyclohexanecarboxamide trihydrochloride), which was inactive alone, fully prevented the antiaggressive effects of alnespirone, 8 -OH-DPAT, and buspirone and partly reversed those of ipsapirone and <b>eltoprazine.</b> The data clearly indicate that alnespirone effectively suppresses offensive aggression with an advantageous profile of action compared with other full or partial 5 -HT 1 A agonists. These selective antiaggressive actions of alnespirone are mediated by stimulating 5 -HT 1 A receptors, presumably the somatodendritic autoreceptors at the raphe nuclei.

40|$|L- 3, 4 -dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) -induced dyskinesias (LIDs) {{represent}} the main {{side effect of}} Parkinson's Disease (PD) therapy. Among the various pharmacological targets for novel therapeutic approaches, the serotonergic system represents a promising one. In experimental models of PD and in PD patients the development of abnormal involuntarymovements (AIMs) and LIDs, respectively, is accompanied by the impairment of bidirectional synaptic plasticity in key structures such as striatum. Recently, {{it has been shown}} that the 5 -HT 1 A/ 1 B receptor agonist, <b>eltoprazine,</b> significantly decreased LIDs in experimental PD and human patients. Despite the fact that several papers have tested this and other serotonergic drugs, nothing is known about the electrophysiological consequences on this combined serotonin receptors modulation at striatal neurons. The present study demonstrates that activation of 5 -HT 1 A/ 1 B receptors reduces AIMs via the restoration of Long-Term Potentiation (LTP) and synaptic depotentiation in a sub-set of striatal spiny projection neurons (SPNs). This recovery is associated with the normalization of D 1 receptor-dependent cAMP/PKA and ERK/mTORC signaling pathways, and the recovery of NMDA receptor subunits balance, indicating these events as key elements in AIMs induction. Moreover, we analyzed whether the manipulation of the serotonergic system might affect motor behavior and cognitive performances.

40|$|Impulsivity, poorly {{conceived}} or prematurely executed behavior, is {{an important}} characteristic of human personality, but to some people, impulsivity is debilitating. They are unable to maintain jobs or friends. In this thesis, we study the differences and similarities of {{two different types of}} impulsivity. The first is a deficit of response inhibition: an inability to inhibit planned or ongoing behavior. The second is delay aversion: an intolerance to delays to rewards. The aim of this thesis was to uncover differences and similarities between these types of behavior, and to find putative anti-impulsive drugs. The research consisted of three parts. In the first, we investigated the induction of both types of impulsivity in rats. In the second, we studied the relationship between baseline levels of impulsivity to several other types of behavior: locomotor activity, extinction learning, aggressive behavior, and sexual behavior in rats, and addictive behavior in human subjects. In the final part, we set out to find novel pharmacological strategies for the treatment of both types of impulsivity. We learned that social isolation in rats could lead to both a deficit of response inhibition and delay aversion, although the latter emerges only after a number of months. Administration of D-amphetamine lowered delay aversion and worsened response inhibition, in particular in isolated animals. Pre-existing (not-induced) differences in levels of delay aversion and response inhibition in rats were strongly related to extinction learning and aggressive behavior, but not locomotor activity and sexual behavior. In humans, delay aversion was found to be associated to addictive behaviors, in particular to smoking. These relationships suggested that known pharmacological targets for decreasing aggression, addiction, and extinction speed may also lower delay aversion. To that end, the effects of several psychoactive drugs on delay aversion of rats were tested. The results indicated that the dopamine D 3 -receptor, and in particular the serotonin 5 -HT 1 A-receptor may be interesting targets for the treatment of impulsivity. Therefore, we tested the effects of the anti-aggressive drug <b>eltoprazine</b> (a serotonin 5 -HT 1 A/ 1 B-receptor agonist) on delay aversion and response inhibition and compared those effects to the effects of D-amphetamine. Both <b>eltoprazine</b> and D-amphetamine lowered delay aversion, but increased response inhibition failures. Local measurements in the brain suggested that the effects of <b>eltoprazine</b> were not due to changes in dopamine levels. Rather, changes in serotonin levels were hypothesized to be involved. This finding suggests that the mechanism by which <b>eltoprazine</b> affects impulsivity subtypes is very different from that of D-amphetamine, and could be of potential value in the treatment of psychiatric disorders in which impulsivity plays an important role...|$|E

For a more efficacious treatment of motor complications, new formulations of L-Dopa, dopamine agonists, and amantadine {{as well as new}} MAO-B and COMT inhibitors are currently tested in clinical trials, and some of them already yielding positive results in phase 3 trials. In addition, non-dopaminergic agents have been tested in the early clinical phase for the treatment of motor fluctuations and dyskinesia, including adenosine A 2 A antagonists (istradefylline, preladenant, and tozadenant) and modulators of the metabolic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR 5 - mavoglurant) and serotonin (<b>eltoprazine)</b> receptors. Recent clinical trials testing coenzyme Q 10, the dopamine agonist pramipexole, creatine monohydrate, pioglitazone, or AAV-mediated gene therapy aimed at increasing expression of neurturin, did not prove efficacious. Treatment with nicotine, caffeine, inosine (a precursor of urate), and isradipine (a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker), as well as active and passive immunization against α-synuclein and inhibitors or modulators of α-synuclein-aggregation are currently studied in clinical trials. However, to date, no disease-modifying treatment is available. We here review the current status of treatment options for motor and non-motor symptoms, and discuss current investigative strategies for disease modification. This review provides basic insights, mainly addressing basic scientists and non-specialists. It stresses the need to intensify therapeutic PD research and points out reasons why the translation of basic research to disease-modifying therapies has been unsuccessful so far...|$|E
40|$|Anhedonia {{is one of}} {{the core}} {{symptoms}} of depression and is characterized by the inability to experience pleasure. Anhedonia is difficult to treat with the current available antidepressants. A novel class of antidepressants, the triple reuptake inhibitors (TRIs), are believed to act as broad-spectrum drugs with an early-onset antidepressant effect. TRIs might be particularly useful for the treatment of anhedonia. TRIs block the transporters of all three monoamines simultaneously: serotonin (5 -HT), norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA). In particular the effects on the DA transporter are thought to be important for the treatment of anhedonia. In this thesis in rats the role of 5 -HT, NE and especially DA in brain mechanisms involved in anhedonia and in brain stimulation reward was investigated. In vivo microdialysis studies were performed in which the effects of monoaminergic drugs were measured on extracellular monoamine concentrations in several brain areas that are involved in depression. On the other hand effects of psychotropic drugs on brain reward sensitivity in an intracranial self-stimulation paradigm were investigated. In chapter 2, the use of TRIs in the treatment of different subtypes of depression was reviewed. First, a distinction was made between different subtypes of depression; melancholic and atypical depression, which both have their own symptom profile. Specific symptoms were linked to distinct disturbances in monoaminergic brain mechanisms, which resulted in a revisited monoamine hypothesis of depression, stating that monoaminergic neurotransmission is out of balance, rather than deficient in the subtypes of depression. In chapter 3 and 4 it was shown that the triple reuptake inhibitor DOV 216, 303 increased 5 -HT, NE and DA in the prefrontal cortex and dorsal hippocampus, brain areas that are important in depression. Furthermore, chronic treatment with DOV 216, 303 lead to a faster metabolism of the drug compared to an acute challenge, which might be a limitation for this drug in clinical use. In chapter 5 it was shown that DOV 216, 303 induced long-lasting enhancement of brain reward activity without showing withdrawal-associated reward deficits, suggesting that an enhancement of DA {{does not necessarily mean that}} a drug has abuse potential. In chapter 6, enhancement of DA neurotransmission did not enhance brain reward systems, as the 5 -HT 1 A/ 1 B receptor agonist <b>eltoprazine</b> increased DA concentrations and decreased 5 -HT concentrations in the brain, but resulted in increased ICSS thresholds. It was concluded that besides DA, also 5 -HT might be important in mediating reward. In chapter 7, the acute and chronic effects of escitalopram, reboxetine and methylphenidate were investigated on monoamine release in the prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens in combination with the effects of these drugs on brain stimulation reward. Only methylphenidate, which increased DA levels in the nucleus accumbens, enhanced brain stimulation reward. In chapter 8, the main results of the thesis are discussed with implications for further research. In summary, it is concluded that TRIs might serve as good first-line antidepressants, especially in the treatment of anhedoni...|$|E
40|$|More {{than any}} other brain {{neurotransmitter}} system, the indolamine serotonin (5 -HT) {{has been linked to}} aggression in a wide and diverse range of species, including humans. The nature of this linkage, however, is not simple and it has proven difficult to unravel the precise role of this amine in the predisposition for and execution of aggressive behavior. The dogmatic view that 5 -HT inhibits aggression has dominated both pharmacological research strategies to develop specific and effective novel drug treatments that reduce aggressive behavior and the pharmacological mechanistic interpretation of putative serenic drug effects. Our studies on brain serotonin and aggression in feral wild-type rats using the resident- intruder paradigm have challenged this so-called serotonin deficiency hypothesis of aggressive behavior. The well-known fact that certain 5 -HT 1 A/ 1 B receptor agonists potently and specifically reduce aggressive behavior without motor slowing and sedative effects is only consistent with this hypothesis under the assumption that the agonist mainly acts on the postsynaptic 5 -HT 1 A/ 1 B receptor sites. However, systemic injections of anti-aggressive doses of 5 -HT 1 A and 1 B agonists robustly decrease brain 5 -HT release due to their inhibitory actions at somatodendritic and terminal autoreceptors, respectively. The availability of the novel benzodioxopiperazine compound S- 15535, which acts in vivo as a preferential agonist of the somatodendritic 5 -HT 1 A auto-receptor and as an antagonist (weak partial agonist) at postsynaptic 5 -HT 1 A receptors, allows for a pharmacological analysis of the exact site of action of this anti-aggressive effect. It was found that, similar to other prototypical full and partial 5 -HT 1 A and/or 5 -HT 1 B receptor agonists like repinotan, 8 -OHDPAT, ipsapirone, buspirone, alnespirone, <b>eltoprazine,</b> CGS- 12066 B and CP- 93129, also S- 15535 very effectively reduced offensive aggressive behavior. Unlike the other ligands, however, a remarkable degree of behavioral specificity was observed after treatment with S- 15535, in that the anti-aggressive effects were not accompanied by inhibiting (like other 5 -HTIA receptor agonist with moderate to high efficacy at postsynaptic 5 -HTIA receptors) or enhancing (like agonists with activity at 5 -HT 1 B receptors and alnespirone) non-aggressive motor behaviors (e. g., social exploration, ambulation, rearing, and grooming) beyond the range of undrugged animals with corresponding levels of aggression. The involvement of 5 -HTIA and/or 5 -HT 1 B receptors in the antiaggressive actions of these drugs was convincingly confirmed by showing that the selective 5 -HT 1 A receptor antagonist WAY- 100635 and/or the 5 -HT 1 B receptor antagonist GR- 127935, while inactive when given alone, effectively attenuated/prevented these actions. Furthermore, combined administration of S- 15535 with either alnespirone or CGS- 42066 B elicited a clear additive effect, indicated by a left-ward shift in their dose-effect curves, providing further support for presynaptic sites of action (i. e., inhibitory somatodendritic 5 -HT 1 A and terminal 5 -HT 1 B autoreceptors). These findings strongly suggest that the specific anti-aggressive effects of 5 -HT 1 A and 5 -HT 1 B receptor agonists are predominantly based on reduction rather than enhancement of 5 -HT neurotransmission during the combative social interaction. Apparently, normal display of offensive aggressive behavior is positively related to rief spikes in serotonergic activity, whereas an inverse relationship probably exists between tonic 5 -HT activity and abnormal forms of aggression only.
