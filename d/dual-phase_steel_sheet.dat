40|$|The {{deformation}} {{behavior of}} 780 MPa grade <b>dual-phase</b> <b>steel</b> <b>sheet</b> subjected to hole expansion is investigated both experimentally and analytically {{to clarify the}} effect of the material model (anisotropic yield function) on the predictive accuracy of finite element analysis of hole expansion. Biaxial tensile tests of the material were conducted; contours of plastic work and the directions of plastic strain rates are precisely measured and are in good agreement with those predicted from the Yld 2000 - 2 d yield function with an exponent of 4 ([Barlat et al., 2003] and [Yoon et al., 2004]). Finite element and experimental analyses on the hole expansion of the material were conducted. The Yld 2000 - 2 d yield function with an exponent of 4 provides closer agreement with the experimental results than other yield functions. Consequently, the anisotropic yield functions significantly affect the predictive accuracy of the deformation behavior of the steel sheet subjected to hole expansion, and the biaxial tensile test is effective for identification of the appropriate anisotropic yield function to be used for hole expansion simulation...|$|E
40|$|The damage onset and {{evolution}} are of significant {{importance in the}} forming processes of high strength steels. These two features and their influence on fracture have challenged the predictive capability of the conventional damage mechanics models. The present thesis contributes to the accurate fracture prediction of both high strength steel sheets and heavy plates by proposing a new generalised hybrid damage mechanics model. A <b>dual-phase</b> <b>steel</b> <b>sheet</b> (DP 600) and a {{high strength low alloy}} steel plate (S 355 J 2 +N), which show very different relation patterns between damage and fracture, are investigated. For both steels, an easy and systematic material parameter calibration procedure with different experiments is designed. Good prediction applying the model to Nakajima tests for the steel sheet and to bending tests for the heavy plate is achieved. This validates the generalised transferability and flexibility of the proposed model for high strength steels with complex damage-fracture relation under various stress states. As the model is formulated in a phenomenological sense, it also suffers from two drawbacks: having a large number of material parameters and a weak link to the material microstructure. Therefore, two approaches are provided to overcome these shortcomings: justified simplification of the model formulation for specific applications and linking the microstructure to the phenomenological material parameters by multiscale modelling...|$|E

The numerical results are compared to quasi-static experiments conducted with five types of specimens (uniaxial tension, plane-strain tension, in-plane shear, 45 ° and 90 ° modified Arcan) made from a 2 mm thick sheet of the dual-phase steel Docol 600 DL. The rate-dependent J 2 flow theory with isotropic hardening {{was used in the}} simulations. The predicted crack paths and the force–displacement curves were quite similar in the simulations with the different fracture criteria. Except for the 45 ° modified Arcan test, the predicted crack paths were in good agreement with the experimental findings. The effect of using a high-exponent yield function in the prediction of the crack path was also investigated, and it was found that this improved the crack path prediction for the 45 ° modified Arcan test. In simulations carried out on FE models with a denser spatial discretization, the prediction of localized necking and crack propagation was in better accordance with the experimental observations. In four out of five specimen geometries, a through-thickness shear fracture was observed in the experiments. By introducing strain softening in the material model and applying a dense spatial discretization, the slant fracture mode was captured in the numerical models. This did not give a significant change in the global behaviour as represented by the force–displacement curves...|$|E

40|$|A new phenomenological {{framework}} for predicting ductile fracture after non-proportional loading paths is proposed, implemented into FE software and validated experimentally {{for a limited}} set of monotonic and reverse loading conditions. Assuming that ductile fracture initiation is imminent {{with the formation of}} a shear band, a shear localization criterion in terms of the elastoplastic tangent matrix is sufficient from a theoretical point of view to predict ductile fracture after proportional and non-proportional loading. As a computationally efficient alternative to analyzing the acoustic tensor, a phenomenological criterion is proposed which expresses the equivalent hardening rate at the onset of fracture {{as a function of the}} stress triaxiality and the Lode angle parameter. The mathematical form of the criterion is chosen such that it reduces to the Hosford–Coulomb criterion for proportional loading. The proposed framework implies that the plasticity model is responsible for the effect of loading history on ductile fracture. Important non-isotropic hardening features such as the Bauschinger effect, transient softening and hardening stagnation must be taken into account by the plasticity model formulation to obtain reasonable fracture predictions after non-proportional loading histories. A new comprehensive plasticity model taking the above effects into account is thus an important byproduct of this work. In addition, compression–tension and reverse-shear experiments are performed on specimens extracted from <b>dual-phase</b> <b>steel</b> <b>sheets</b> to validate the proposed plasticity and fracture model.

Laser welding was performed using different powers and welding speeds to attain different heat inputs. Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) examinations and hardness measurements were used to characterize the microstructure of the welds. The tensile properties were found to depend on the heat input, but joint strength exceeding that of the base metal (BM) were obtained at low heat inputs. However, the fracture location shifted from the base metal to the heat-affected zone (HAZ) as the heat input was increased. The HAZ consisted of a mixture of austenite, ferrite and martensite, and its width increased with increasing the heat input. It was supposed that the incompatibility between the ferrite, austenite and martensite phases led to early void formation and fracturing of the phase interfaces in the wide HAZ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the macroscopic performance of friction stir welded automotive tailor-welded blank (TWB) sheets, the hardening behavior, anisotropic yielding properties and forming limit diagram were characterized both for base (material) and weld zones. In order to describe the Bauschinger and transient hardening behaviors as well as permanent softening during reverse loading, the modified Chaboche type combined isotropic–kinematic hardening law was applied. As for anisotropic yielding, the non-quadratic anisotropic yield function, Yld 2000 - 2 d, was utilized for base material zones, while isotropy was assumed for weld zones for simplicity. As for weld zones, hardening properties were obtained using the rule of mixture and selectively by direct measurement using sub-sized specimens. Forming limit diagrams were measured for base materials but calculated for weld zones based on Hill’s bifurcation and M–K theories.

The average nanoindentation hardness of ferrite was found to increase from ∼ 2 GPa in the as-received condition to ∼ 3. 5 GPa in the specimen that had been pre-strained to 7 % plastic tensile strain. Hardness of ferrite in the as-received condition was inhomogeneous: ferrite adjacent to ferrite/martensite interface was ∼ 20 % harder than that in the interior, a feature also captured by micropillar compression experiments. Hardness variation in ferrite was reversed in samples pre-strained to 7 % strain. Martensite in the as-received condition and after 5 % pre-strain exhibited large scatter in nanoindentation hardness; however, micropillar compression results on the as-received and previously deformed steel specimens demonstrated that the martensite phase in this steel was amenable to plastic deformation and rapid work hardening {{in the early stages}} of deformation.

The geometry and loading condition of the specimens were similar to formability tests, and the average strain rates before failure were in the range 80 – 210 s− 1 for the low-velocity tests and 0. 002 - 0. 005 s− 1 for the quasi-static tests. For both loading rates, the sheets failed under pre-dominant membrane loading, and by varying the specimen geometry, the stress states prior to failure ranged from uniaxial tension to equi-biaxial tension. Thus, the most important stress states occurring during an impact event in a thin-walled structure are covered. The experiments were complemented by nonlinear finite element simulations, where higher-order solid elements and a refined mesh were applied to capture {{the failure of the}} sheets. The materials were modelled using the Hershey high-exponent yield function combined with the associated flow rule and isotropic hardening. Quasi-static tensile and shear tests and tensile tests at elevated strain rates were performed to calibrate the constitutive relation. The results in terms of force-displacement curves and strain histories at critical positions in the specimens were similar for low-velocity and quasi-static loading, independent of material and specimen geometry.

40|$|The general {{trend in}} the car body {{manufacturing}} industry is towards low-series production and reduction of press lubricants and car weight. The limited use of press lubricants, {{in combination with the}} introduction of high and ultra-high strength sheet materials, continuously increases the demands of the forming tools. To provide the means of forming new generations of sheet material, development of new tool materials with improved galling resistance is required, which may include tailored microstructures, introducing of specific(MC, M(C,N)) carbides and nitrides, coatings and improved surface finish. In the present work, the wear mechanisms in real forming operations have been studied and emulated on a laboratory scale by developing a test equipment. The wear mechanisms identified in the real forming process, were distinguished into a sequence of events consisting of initial local adhesive wear of the sheets resulting in transfer of sheet material to the tool surfaces. Successive forming operations led to growth of the transfer layer and initiation of scratching of the sheets. Finally, scratching changed into severe adhesive wear, associated with gross macroscopic damage. The wear process was repeated in the laboratory test-equipment in sliding between several tool materials, ranging from cast iron to conventional ingot cast tool steels to advanced powder metallurgy tool <b>steel,</b> against <b>dual-phase</b> carbon <b>steel</b> <b>sheets.</b> By use of the test-equipment, selected tool materials were ranked regarding wear resistance in sliding against ferritic-martensitic <b>steel</b> <b>sheets</b> at different contact pressures. Wear in sheet metal forming is mainly determined by adhesion; initially between the tool and sheet surface interaction and subsequently, after initiation of material transfer, between a sheet to sheet contact. Atomic force microscopy force curves showed that adhesion is sensitive to both chemical composition and temperature. By alloying of iron with 18 wt. % Cr and 8 wt. % Ni, alloying in itself, or changes in crystal structure, led to an increase of 3 times in adhesion at room temperature. Hence, alloying may be assumed a promising way for control of adhesive properties. Additionally, frictional heating should be controlled to avoid high adhesion as, generally, adhesion was found to increase with increasing temperature for all investigated materials...|$|R

The anisotropic behavior quantification was possible through tension and Charpy impact tests. It has been concluded that mechanical resistance has higher {{values in the}} longitudinal direction for both steels, and the inverse occurs for ductility. This could be explained with the microstructure preferential orientation with rolling direction. The higher tensile strength found in <b>dual-phase</b> <b>steel</b> {{is related to the}} presence of martensite islands, and the higher yield strength found in ferrite-perlite grain-refined steel is related to the fine structure observed. The higher toughness is a ferrite-perlite grain-refined steel characteristic, and this could be explained with the presence of only globular-oxide type inclusions, which reduces fracture nucleation sites, and does not promote fracture easy-propagation. Sulfide type inclusions found in <b>dual-phase</b> <b>steel,</b> associated with globular-oxide ones, give to this material a more brittle behavior.

Originality/value: The results reported show that <b>dual-phase</b> <b>steel</b> can be a good candidate for reinforcement in concrete especially in aggressive and corrosive environments...|$|R

The measured initial relative permeability values agreed well with finite element microstructure model predictions. The EM sensor low frequency inductance value {{is sensitive to}} changes in relative permeability and the sensor can measure ferrite fraction in <b>dual-phase</b> <b>steels.</b> Therefore, EM sensors {{could be used to}} assess <b>dual-phase</b> (ferrite+pearlite/bainite/martensite) <b>steel</b> microstructures in a non-contact, non-destructive manner...|$|R
