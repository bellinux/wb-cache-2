50|$|The <b>fertility</b> <b>plasmid</b> or F-plasmid was {{discovered}} by Esther Lederberg and encodes information for the biosynthesis of sex pilus to aid in bacterial conjugation. Conjugation involves using the sex pilus to form a bridge between two bacteria cells; the bridge allows the F+ cell to transfer a single-stranded copy of the plasmid so that both cells contain {{a copy of the}} plasmid. On the way into the recipient cell, the corresponding DNA strand is synthesized by the recipient. The donor cell maintains a functional copy of the plasmid.

As found previously for that of the <b>fertility</b> <b>plasmid</b> <b>F,</b> the finP gene of R 6 - 5 is located close to the origin of DNA transfer, oriT, and to the promoter-proximal segment of the tra operon. Thus, finP {{is close to the}} site of action of the FinOP fertility inhibition system. In contrast, the finO gene is located {{on the other side of}} the tra operon, greater than 35 kilobases from the finP gene; finO is very close to the origin of vegetative replication, oriV, and to cistrons encoding functions involved in autonomous plasmid replication and plasmid incompatibility.

40|$|The colicinogenic B factor, {{transferred}} from Escherichia coli strain K 77 (and termed ColB 2 -K 77 or ColB 2) to an E. coli K 12 F− strain, {{is capable of}} promoting its own transfer to other K 12 F− strains {{at a low rate}} (from LFC cultures) which can be increased under special conditions (HFC cultures). LFC cultures of K 12 (ColB 2) + F− strains show a low level of adsorption of F-specific phage particles which also increases under HFC conditions. The ColB 2 factor is thus inferred to be an F-like sex factor which is repressed in its fertility. This repression is concluded to be due to a cytoplasmic repressor since, when ColB 2 is present in cells containing an F factor (either autonomous or integrated), <b>F</b> <b>fertility</b> is also repressed as shown by the inability of such (ColB 2) +F+ [or (ColB 2) +Hfr] strains to plaque F-specific phages, and by a reduction in the level of chromosomal transfer from such strains, compared to the corresponding F+ (or Hfr) control strains. Mutants of the ColB 2 factor in which fertility is no longer repressed (fertility derepressed or Fdr mutants) have been isolated. The ColB 2 Fdr mutant strains {{do not appear to be}} able to mobilize chromosomal transfer, although they have acquired F-specific phage sensitivity demonstrable by plaque formation and they transfer their colicin factor at high frequency and are well piliated. The Fdr mutation is presumed to result in the inability to synthesize the cytoplasmic fertility repressor since the ColB 2 Fdr factor does not repress the <b>fertility</b> of an <b>F</b> factor when present in the same host strain. A fertility-repressed drug resistance factor of the R(f) type is not stable in the presence of a ColB 2 factor in the same cell and is eliminated in about 10 % of the cells per generation. In contrast, another factor characteristic of the R(i) type is fully compatible with ColB 2. Under conditions artificially stabilizing (ColB 2 Fdr) + (Rf) + strains, the enhanced fertility of ColB 2 Fdr is not repressed by the presence of the R factor, nor does the presence of R(f) in the intermediate strain of an HFC (for ColB 2) system inhibit the normal increase in ColB 2 transmissibility. It is concluded that the repressors of R(f) and ColB 2, although both active on <b>F</b> <b>fertility,</b> are different; this may indicate that at least two independently repressible cistrons are involved in the expression of fertility characteristics...|$|R

After transposition, a five-base-pair pBR 322 sequence is duplicated and appears in direct orientation adjacent to {{each end of}} the element. No such duplication flanks the ends of gamma delta in F, and there is no apparent homology between the sequences surrounding gamma delta in F and the five-base-pair duplications generated by insertion. These findings suggest that the duplications are not essential for transposition and that they do not act to direct gamma delta to a homologous site in the target chromosome. In addition, we find that the 35 -base-pair inverted repeat that comprises the termini of gamma delta is strikingly similar in sequence to the ends of both the ampicillin-resistance transposon Tn 3 and a 200 -nucleotide-long sequence on the plasmid pSC 101 which has been shown to mediate recombination with phage f 1 replicative form.

40|$|Transfer of the Escherichia coli <b>fertility</b> <b>plasmid,</b> <b>F,</b> is {{dependent}} on expression of F pili. Synthesis of F-pilin subunits is known to involve three F plasmid transfer (tra) region products: traA encodes the 13 -kDa precursor protein, TraQ permits this to be processed to the 7 -kDa pilin polypeptide, and TraX catalyzes acetylation of the pilin amino terminus. Using cloned tra sequences, we performed a series of pulse-chase experiments to investigate the effect of TraQ and TraX {{on the fate of}} the traA product. In TraQ- cells, the traA gene product was found to be very unstable. While traA polypeptides of various sizes were detected early in the chase period, almost all were degraded within 5 min. Rapid traA product degradation was also observed in TraX+ cells, although an increased percentage of these products persisted during the chase. In TraQ+ cells, most of the traA product was processed to the 7 -kDa pilin polypeptide within the 1 -min pulse period; this product [7 (Q) ] was not degraded but was increasingly converted to an 8 -kDa form [8 (Q) ] as the chase continued, suggesting that host enzymes can modify the pilin polypeptide. Similar results were observed in TraQ+ TraX+ cells, but the primary 7 -kDa product appeared to be N-acetylated pilin (Ac- 7). An 8 -kDa product (Ac- 8) was also detected, but this band did not increase in intensity during the chase. We suggest a pathway in which TraQ prevents the traA product from folding to a readily degradable conformation and assists its entry into the membrane, Leader peptidase I cleaves the traA product signal sequence, and a subset of the pilin polypeptides becomes modified by host enzymes; TraX then acetylates the N terminal of both the modified and unmodified pilin polypeptides...|$|R

Based on these results, we are re-crossing the BC 1 F 1 with HA 410 to produce more BC 2 F 1 seeds to screen for stem rot resistance...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objective}} {{of the current study}} was to investigate different approaches for handling missing re-cords and to develop and implement amultivariate longi-tudinal mixed model for the genetic evaluation of male and female fertility and hatchability in chickens. The traits recorded on a weekly basis were eggs set (E), percentage <b>fertility</b> (<b>F),</b> and percentage hatch of fertile eggs (H). Three approaches for handling missing records were investi-gated: 1) all records with zero weekly laid eggs were removed and remaining records with missing F and H were predicted (M 1); 2) missing records, including zero weekly laid eggs, were assumed known and equal to zero (M 2); and 3) zero weekly laid eggs were assumed as a valid record and missing F and H were predicted (M 3). A longitudinal mixed model was used for the multipl...|$|R
40|$|Natural hybrid zones {{have proven}} to be {{precious}} tools for understanding the origin and maintenance of reproductive isolation (RI) and therefore species. Most available genomic studies of hybrid zones using whole or partial genome resequencing approaches have focused on comparisons of the parental source populations involved in genome admixture, rather than exploring fine-scale patterns of chromosomal ancestry across the full admixture gradient present between hybridizing species. We have studied three well-known European ‘replicate’ hybrid zones of Populus alba and P. tremula, two wide-spread, ecologically divergent forest trees, using up to 432 505 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) from Restriction site Associated DNA (RAD) sequencing. Estimates of fine-scale chromosomal ancestry, genomic divergence, and differentiation across all 19 poplar chromosomes revealed strikingly contrasting results, including an unexpected preponderance of F 1 hybrids in the centre of genomic clines on the one hand, and genomically localized, spatially variable shared variants consistent with ancient introgression between the parental species on the other. Genetic ancestry had a significant effect on survivorship of hybrid seedlings in a common garden trial, pointing to selection against early-generation recombinants. Our results indicate a role for selection against recombinant genotypes in maintaining RI in the face of apparent <b>F</b> 1 <b>fertility,</b> consistent with the intra-genomic ‘coadaptation’ model of barriers to introgression upon secondary contact. Whole genome resequencing of hybridizing populations will clarify the roles of specific genetic pathways in RI between these model forest trees and may reveal which loci are affected most strongly by its cyclic breakdown...|$|R
40|$|Using exiting {{data from}} the {{literature}} for elasmobranch species we: (1) used stage-based population models and elasticity analyses {{to determine how the}} vital rates of mortality (M) and <b>fertility</b> (<b>f)</b> influence population growth rate (r), (2) determined the response of elasticity to changes in the levels of exploitation, (3) used model inputs and species vital rates, such as size maturity (Lmat), and total length (Lmax), and phylogenic associations, as indicators of potential acceptability to over exploitation, and (4) estimated the effects on elasticity of perturbing model vital rates. We found a negative association between species size and elasticity of inter-stage transitions and a positive relationship between species total length and elasticity for adult and juvenile stages of the models. We found that there were no clear associations between trends in elasticity and phylogenic groupings. However, when reproductive modes and vital rates were added weak associations were found between species phylogenies and population dynamics...|$|R
