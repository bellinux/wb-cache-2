40|$|Preparing silicon wafers is a tedious {{multi-step}} {{process that}} includes <b>etching,</b> <b>polishing,</b> and cleaning. The minimum wafer thickness attainable in current high volume wafer production processes is generally 160 to 300 µm, and the kerf loss for these processes {{is up to}} 40 % of the total volume. Thin silicon wafers (~ 30 to 100 µm) are very expensive to produce and the wafering process is not cost effective due to the high amount of material loss (more than 80 % at these dimensions) during {{the process and the}} risk of breakage of the wafers during wafering. In this thesis, a new method called Vapour-Liquid Interface Growth (VLIG) is proposed. VLIG is capable of directly growing a sheet of single crystal silicon without wafering with a thickness of about 30 to 50 µm. The features of the process are 1) low temperature operation; 2) the resulting silicon sheet is easily detachable and self-supporting; 3) the resulting sheet has uniform thickness and is single crystal. The system operates in a supersaturated growth solution of an indium-silicon melt. A seed line in a substrate facing down is employed. A layer of single crystal silicon grows on the see...|$|E
40|$|A {{study of}} the in-situ surface {{preparation}} has been performed for both Si- and C-face 4 H-SiC nominally on-axis samples. The surface was studied after etching under C-rich, Si-rich and under pure hydrogen ambient conditions at the same temperature, pressure and time interval using a hot-wall chemical vapor deposition reactor. The surfaces of all the samples were analyzed using optical microscopy with Normarski diffractional interference contrast and atomic force microscopy with tapping mode before and after in-situ <b>etching.</b> <b>Polishing</b> related damages {{were found to be}} removed under all etching conditions, also the surface step structure was uncovered and a few defect-selective etch pits were observed. For the Si-face sample, the best surface morphology was obtained after Si-rich etching conditions with more uniform and small macro-step height which resulted in the lowest surface roughness. For the C-face sample the surface morphology was comparable under all etching conditions and not much difference was found except for the etching rate. Si droplets were not observed under any etching conditions. Original publication: J. Hassan, J. P. Bergman, A. Henry and E.

40|$|Ultra thin ICs {{will play}} an {{important}} role in future packaging applications for smart and flexible systems. Thinned silicon gets more and more mechanically flexible with thickness below 50 µm and can be bended with a low radius of curvature. But it still remains a brittle material and therefore the applied thinning and dicing technology has to be analyzed. The influence of the thinning techniques, grinding, wet-chemical <b>etching</b> and <b>polishing</b> on the material properties of thinned silicon was investigated by Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), carrier lifetime measurements and X-ray inspection. Experimental results are correlated to mechanical fracture tests. The investigations prove the suitability of the stress-relief processes <b>etching</b> and <b>polishing</b> for the restoration of crystalline quality. However, for silicon wafers in the thickness range of 100 µm to 50 µm backgrinding process causes an increasing depth of damage. This will lead to important consequences for the choice of appropriate wafer thinning techniques if ultra thin ICs are fabricated...|$|R

Each TCL was fitted with a venturi-shaped reduced section {{near the top of}} the hot leg for the purpose of locally increasing the Hg velocity. Results suggest that an increase in velocity from about 1. 2 m/min (bulk flow) to about 5 mmin (reduced section) had no significant impact on compatibility of 316 L with Hg. In addition, various surface treatments such as gold-plating, chemical <b>etching,</b> <b>polishing,</b> and steam cleaning resulted in little or no influence on compatibility of 316 L with Hg when compared to nominal mill-annealed/surface-ground material. A sensitizing heat treatment also had little/no effect on compatibility of 316 L with Hg for the bulk specimen, although intergranular attack was observed around the specimen holes in each case. It was determined that carburization of the hole area had occurred as a result of the specimen fabrication process potentially rendering the specimens susceptible to corrosion by Hg at these locations.

Broad ion beams {{are used for}} conventional ion <b>etching,</b> <b>polishing,</b> thin-ning, depth profiling and also for cutting [1]. With introduction of liquid metal ion sources the FIB technology was developed especially for TEM sample preparation but also for SEM observations where both technologies are complementary. BIB processing has essential advantages compared with FIB technology concerning the productivity, the versatility especially in multi-step proces-sing, the variety {{in the fields of}} application and the simplicity in practice and therefore lower costs of the available technique. FIG. 1 shows the characteristics of broad ion beam processing for 3 D invest igation of microstructures. With ion beam direction IB 1 slope cutting is performed with typically 5 to 10 keV inert gas ions over some millimetres in length and up to the required depth (e. g. up to 100 µm). Optionally rocking of the sample can be used to avoid ion beam induced fur-rows. The 10000 times larger cut area and the application of inert gases with relatively low ener-gies are some of the advantages compared with the FIB technology where 30 keV Ga ions are applied to cut small areas of typically 10 µm laterally and vertically.

40|$|Recently, charged {{particles}} accelerated by microwave radiation are generated in large klystrons, which are called Radio frequency (RF) accelerators. However, this RF accelerator {{is very expensive}} and requires large amounts of land to bury accelerator systems in the ground. Accelerator physicists have studied high acceleration gradients. If we have a high acceleration gradient, we can get high accelerated electrons in a much shorter distance. We believed particle accelerators benefit from the high energy density provided by lasers at optical and infrared wavelengths and dielectric materials replace the metallic waveguides allowing us to utilize the high peak powers available in laser. To realize this jump from microwave to infrared wavelengths, we need decreases of 10, 000 times in wavelength, and entirely new fabrication technologies to make 3 D photonic crystals. ^ 3 D photonic crystals (3 D PhCs) have many desirable attributions due to their abilities to confine light in all directions. The major challenge is to fabricate 3 D micro/nano-structures with high yield and fast turn-around time, especially {{when the number of}} layers is large. The layer-by layer technique allows arbitrarily-shaped 3 D structures to be fabricated and takes advantages of well-established integrated circuit processing techniques. Nevertheless, the complicated and lengthy procedure, in addition to roughness and/or incidental damages on the final structure by frequent dry <b>etching,</b> <b>polishing,</b> and heating, make it difficult for prototyping novel multilayer structures. ^ Here we present a new approach to form 3 D structures by transferring and stacking pre-patterned, free-standing silicon membranes and demonstrate the process by fabricating an woodpile 3 D PhC, which has a complete 3 D photonic band gap, and a relatively simple structure. It consists of layers of dielectric rods in the air, with the rods in each layer rotated 90 degrees. These photonic crystals can be the building blocks of next generation high-gradient accelerators. ...|$|E

30|$|These {{results are}} general {{for the other}} halogens and halogenates. A 0.04 -M Br 2 [*]+[*]HF {{solution}} led to etching of flat Si surfaces, which remained flat after etching. If the solution was exposed to a por-Si layer, the por-Si was removed. As mentioned above, {{this is consistent with}} the work of Bressers et al.[27]. A solution of 0.07 [*]M NaBrO 3 [*]+[*]HF also etched Si. By the solution color change observed, it was clear that the reaction of BrO 3 – generated Br 2 in solution. As expected, the <b>etching</b> of a <b>polished</b> Si surface led to a flat surface after etching. Similarly, a 0.2 -M KClO 3 [*]+[*]HF solution led to the <b>etching</b> of <b>polished</b> silicon, which resulted in the formation of Cl 2 in solution and a flat final surface. Neither one of these oxidants etched Si with the same degree of anisotropy as observed with iodate.
