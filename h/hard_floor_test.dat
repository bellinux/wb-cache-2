40|$|The energy, {{time and}} water usage {{required}} for cleaning carpets and <b>hard</b> <b>floors</b> (solid vinyls, wood and wood laminates) in commercial buildings are compared. The electrical energy requirements for {{both types of}} flooring are similar for areas with heavier traffic volumes. For all other areas, carpets require slightly more electrical energy, but less human energy, water and time to clean than <b>hard</b> <b>floors.</b> The greatest difference is in the consumption of water, with <b>hard</b> <b>floors</b> requiring up to 40 times more than carpet, depending {{on the amount of}} traffic. This work has shown that maintaining carpets has a lower overall environmental impact than main-taining <b>hard</b> <b>floors...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of geochemical {{analysis}} of <b>hard</b> <b>floor</b> sediment samples from the prehistoric Mun river valley occupation sites of Ban Non Wat and Nong Hua Raet in Northeast Thailand. Past human activities leave the chemical residues on the activity floors as an evidence for those activities. We examined the soil chemistry of compacted sediment features identified archaeologically as floors and sediments from the general spits and off-site natural soils, using standard chemistry-based method of inductively coupled plasma-mass spectroscopy. The results showed high levels of phosphorus, calcium, potassium and iron present in <b>hard</b> <b>floor</b> areas which was the most domestic activities took place. These results provide important information for the understanding of <b>hard</b> <b>floor</b> surfaces which has been found as compacted sediment layers in the excavations. Chemical analysis revealed key anthropogenic elements in the soil features of the <b>hard</b> <b>floors</b> to be phosphorus, calcium and potassium which reflect the occupation intensity of ancient people in different floor surfaces...|$|R

40|$|Claw health, an {{important}} dairy cow welfare parameter, {{may be affected}} by early-life foot/leg stresses. To investigate this, groups of pregnant heifers were allocated to deep straw bedding (Soft) or cubicles (Hard), both with scraped concrete feeding alleys. After the grazing season, they were re-housed in cubicle systems, half on slatted concrete (Hard) and half on slatted rubber (Soft) alleys. Claw measurements, contact area and pressure distribution claw/flooring, claw disorders and leg lesions were recorded at the start and end of each housing season. Locomotion and leg lesions were also scored monthly after calving. Prevalence of sole haemorrhages was higher among pregnant heifers in cubicles than in deep straw. After calving, first-calvers on <b>Hard</b> <b>floors</b> had higher odds for lameness (OR = 3. 6; P < 0. 01), sole haemorrhages/ulcers (OR = 2. 2; P < 0. 05), white-line haemorrhages (OR = 2. 8; P < 0. 01) and leg lesions (OR = 2. 6; P < 0. 02) than those on Soft floors. Lowest prevalence and severity of sole and white-line haemorrhages (non-significant) in first-calvers was found in those on Soft floors and reared on <b>Hard</b> <b>floors</b> and the highest prevalence and severity on those on <b>Hard</b> <b>floors</b> reared on Soft floors.
