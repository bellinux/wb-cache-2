25|$|This {{was used}} when {{the best results}} were wanted from long fibred wools and hairs such as mohair, alpaca, long English and {{crossbred}} wools. In the Lister comb, the slivers of wool or hair are fed into the machine over the back plate, through the fluted feed rollers, under the spreader roller and onto the pins of the fallers which disentangle and transport the fibres to the nip jaw. The nip jaw, with its swinging motion, closes in upon the fringe of fibres, grasping them and pulling them out from the faller pins; thus partially combing the fibres which are then received by the carrier comb and conveyed to the pins of the large combing circle into which they are pressed by the <b>dabbing</b> <b>brush.</b> As the large circle rotates, the unique feature of the machine, the side circle comb gives the fibres a secondary combing, removing not the short fibres, but any excessively long ones. The large comb circle carries the remaining fibres to the drawing-off rollers which give the fibres their final combing by removing the long fibres from the circle pins, with the short ones being left behind. The long fibres or top pass through a revolving funnel to the crimping box and into a can directly underneath. The short fibres or noils are removed from the pins of the large comb circle by lifting knives, and deposited into a can ready for removal.|$|E
2500|$|However, it was {{not until}} the final decline of the Academic {{hierarchy}} in Europe, and the rise of the Impressionist and Post-Impressionist painters, that technique and color harmony triumphed over subject matter, and that still life was once again avidly practiced by artists. In his early still life, Claude Monet shows the influence of Fantin-Latour, but is one of the first to break the tradition of the dark background, which Pierre-Auguste Renoir also discards in Still Life with Bouquet and Fan (1871), with its bright orange background. With Impressionist still life, allegorical and mythological content is completely absent, as is meticulously detailed brush work. Impressionists instead focused on experimentation in broad, <b>dabbing</b> <b>brush</b> strokes, tonal values, and color placement. [...] The Impressionists and Post-Impressionists were inspired by nature’s color schemes but reinterpreted nature with their own color harmonies, which sometimes proved startlingly unnaturalistic. As Gauguin stated, [...] "Colors have their own meanings." [...] Variations in perspective are also tried, such as using tight cropping and high angles, as with Fruit Displayed on a Stand by Gustave Caillebotte, a painting which was mocked at the time as a [...] "display of fruit in a bird’s-eye view." ...|$|E

30|$|In both cases, {{the stroke}} or <b>dab</b> by <b>brush</b> {{and the use}} of a film {{applicator}} have proven as appropriate methods. Satisfactory and consistent results of application and good, promising stabilizing results were achieved.|$|R

60|$|Almost {{immediately}} the great timbers, which, polished and greased, {{had been waiting}} for several days, were put in their places, and the great steam engines and windlasses, which had been ready as long a time, were set in motion. And, as the house began to move upon its course, it almost missed a parting <b>dab</b> from the <b>brush</b> of a painter who was at work upon some final trimming.|$|R
5000|$|... “In these persuasively {{lonely and}} poignant paintings, the grey-blue tracks, which {{invariably}} look like tracks that have borne no trains for decades, {{begin in the}} foreground and wander off into the distance. They thread {{this way and that}} through foggy grey middle grounds and out into oblivion, the flecking and <b>dabbing</b> of Sassone’s <b>brush</b> reading now as the rusting, flaking and slow ruin that comes with abandonment.”- GARY MICHAEL DAULT, The Globe and Mail, Toronto, Ontario, Canada (April 12, 2008) ...|$|R
5000|$|... "The {{noise level}} in the Académie Julian is always at a {{constant}} rumble: the scraping of benches {{on the floor as}} the artists jockey for a better view of the model, the lively banter of dozens of young men in three or four different languages, the swish and <b>dab</b> of <b>brushes</b> against canvas. The air in the studio is warm and full of the mingled scents of linseed oil and turpentine, damp wool jackets and the smoke from pipes and cigarettes. In one corner Frank Benson concentrates on putting the finishing touches to a portrait of the model, a gaunt old man. Wiping his brush on his smock, he waves to his friend, Joseph Lindon Smith, and they race down three flights of stairs to breathe the fresh air. That evening, over a meager meal in their fourth-floor rooms on Paris’s Right Bank, the two make plans {{to get out of the}} city for a weekend." ...|$|R
40|$|We present CoolPaint, {{a system}} for {{computer}} painting that uses a props-based direct interaction technique. By instrumenting real paint brushes and developing corresponding digital models of the brushes, we allow the user to control digital tools by directly manipulating their physical counterparts. In addition, we use a tabletop display which allows the display space and interaction space to be unified. The painter picks up a real paint <b>brush,</b> <b>dabs</b> it in ‘paint’, and makes a brush stroke across the canvas. Digital paint immediately appears on the canvas, directly under the brush, with exactly the brush stroke the painter expects. The result is an intuitive, expressive, and fun painting experience. 1...|$|R

Hold still, now--hold still; don't interrupt--I tell you I know what I am talking about. Here is the idea. During {{the next three months}} the one who is to die shall paint with all his might, enlarge his stock all he can--not pictures, no! {{skeleton}} sketches, studies, parts of studies, fragments of studies, a dozen <b>dabs</b> of the <b>brush</b> on each--meaningless, of course, but his, with his cipher on them; turn out fifty a day, each to contain some peculiarity or mannerism easily detectable as his--they're the things that sell, you know, and are collected at fabulous prices for the world's museums, after the great man is gone; we'll have a ton of them ready--a ton! And all that time the rest of us will be busy supporting the moribund, and working Paris and the dealers--preparations for the coming event, you know; and when everything is hot and just right, we'll spring the death on them and have the notorious funeral. You get the idea?" ...|$|R
60|$|I went to Marlborough House {{to look at}} the English {{pictures}}, which I {{care more}} about seeing, here in England, than those of foreign artists, because the latter will be found more numerously and better on the Continent. I saw many pictures that pleased me; nothing that impressed me very strongly. Pictorial talent seems to be abundant enough, up to a certain point; pictorial genius, I should judge, is among the rarest of gifts. To be sure, I very likely might not recognize it where it existed; and yet it ought to have the power of making itself known even to the uninstructed mind, as literary genius does. If it exist only for connoisseurs, it is a very suspicious matter. I looked at all Turner's pictures, and at many of his drawings; and must again confess myself wholly unable to understand more than a very few of them. Even those few are tantalizing. At a certain distance you discern {{what appears to be a}} grand and beautiful picture, which you shall admire and enjoy infinitely if you can get within the range of distinct vision. You come nearer, and find only blotches of color and <b>dabs</b> of the <b>brush,</b> meaning nothing when you look closely, and meaning a mystery at the point where the painter intended to station you. Some landscapes there were, indeed, full of imaginative beauty, and of the better truth etherealized out of the prosaic truth of Nature; only it was still impossible actually to see it. There was a mist over it; or it was like a tract of beautiful dreamland, seen dimly through sleep, and glimmering out of sight, if looked upon with wide-open eyes. These were the more satisfactory specimens. There were many others which I could not comprehend in the remotest degree; not even so far as to conjecture whether they purported to represent earth, sea, or sky. In fact, I should not have known them to be pictures at all, but might have supposed that the artist had been trying his brush on the canvas, mixing up all sorts of hues, but principally white paint, and now and then producing an agreeable harmony of color without particularly intending it. Now that I have done my best to understand them without an interpreter, I mean to buy Ruskin's pamphlet at my next visit, and look at them through his eyes. But I do not think that I can be driven out of the idea that a picture ought to have something in common with what the spectator sees in nature.|$|R
