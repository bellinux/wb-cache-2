40|$|A novel smart tire {{monitoring}} system {{was designed and}} implemented on a fully functional car tire. Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) based piezo-electric sensors were embedded inside rubber tire to measure strain related data. System electronics were implemented inside a robust IP- 68 (<b>Ingress</b> <b>Protection)</b> <b>rated</b> enclosure. This enclosure was mounted on a car wheel and successfully recorded sensory data onto an SD card during driving. Data collected from the PVDF sensors were then post-processed in Matlab. An artificial neural network (ANN) was built to correlate the sensor data to the readings given by an industry grade load wheel. Although the correlations are very crude, this study shows a promising way to analyze the strain related information from car tires by using PVDF sensors in conjunction with ANNs. This strain related information can then be used to estimate six different values concerning the tire, namely lateral force (Fy), longitudinal force (Fx), normal force (Fz), aligning moment (Mz), inflation pressure and friction coefficient. All of which are very important parameters for vehicle dynamics. However the estimation of these values is not presented {{within the context of}} this work. Two low cost data acquisition systems were designed in-house with two different Arduino platforms. However these fell short of data acquisition performance requirements required for realistic driving applications. It was seen that the Arduino family, low-end microprocessors, were not the best choice for applications of this nature. Finally electronic improvements such as the usage of field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) is discussed and suggested for future works...|$|R

The phone was 4G capable, but lacked LTE support. It was dust and vibration resistant, as well as waterproof {{to a depth of}} 1 m for 30 minutes, earning the phone an <b>ingress</b> <b>protection</b> <b>rating</b> of IP67.|$|E
50|$|Within zone 0, no {{devices are}} allowed apart from {{suitable}} equipment and or insulated pull cords. Previously, in zone 1, only separated extra low voltage (SELV) devices were permitted. Any AC transformer supplying such a device must be located outside zones 0-2. Since {{the introduction of}} the 17th edition of the IET Wiring Regulations in 2008, 230V fixtures such as light fittings and extractor fans are permitted in zones 1 and 2, subject to those fixtures meeting the appropriate ingress protection ratings. The minimum required <b>ingress</b> <b>protection</b> <b>rating</b> in zone 0 is IPX7 and IPX4 in zone 1 and 2. If water jets are likely to occur, at least IPX5 is required in zone 1-3. Otherwise, in zone 3 and beyond, an <b>ingress</b> <b>protection</b> <b>rating</b> of IP20 is the minimum required. Equipment in zones 1 and 2 must be protected by a 30 mA residual current device (RCD).|$|E

5000|$|The verykool {{line was}} {{launched}} in 2006 by InfoSonics Corporation, a publicly traded company that operated as a telecommunication product distributor since 1994. The company was a distributor of products supplied by Samsung, VK Corporation, LG, Novatel and others. InfoSonics Corporation ceased its distribution business in 2012 and became solely a manufacturer of its own product line. [...] InfoSonics began shipping its first line of verykool products to Central America in 2007. This included the verykool i500 and i230 wireless handsets. The verykool product line was expanded in 2013 {{with the release of}} the verykool s350 and the verykool RS75. The RS75 is part of the verykool rugged line of mobile phones. It is a dust and waterproof phone with an <b>Ingress</b> <b>Protection</b> <b>rating</b> of IP67 and tempered, scratch-resistant glass display. InfoSonics also began marketing its mobile devices in the United States in 2013 due to the demand of inexpensive unlocked phones. That same year InfoSonics released the verykool s470, also called the Black Pearl. The Black Pearl is comparable to the Moto X from Motorola Mobility with a 1.2 GHz processor and 4.7-inch screen. It also includes Dual SIM technology allowing users to switch between two SIM cards within the phone. It is compatible with GSM carriers like AT&T, T-Mobile and overseas GSM networks, and was called an alternative to the Nexus 5 by Mobile Tech Reviews.|$|E

40|$|As the use {{of power}} {{electronics}} and inductive loads on electrical supplies increases, the requirement to monitor power system quality becomes an increasingly common practice. The negative effects these loads have on supply balance and frequency can {{be reflected in the}} efficiency, and therefore the running costs, of said loads. With demand for analysis techniques in industry increasing, and the PC becoming a more popular tool for such applications, a low-cost PC-based electrical system analyser was proposed to demonstrate a cost-effective, accurate alternative to the expensive market-leading products. This study researches the problem at hand, the technology available, and the development and testing of the analyser in a laboratory environment. The success of this study was determined by the accuracy, cost, functionality and features of the analyser compared with those of an existing product. The final product was to be a virtual instrument (VI) PC application implemented using the industry-leading LabVIEW software package by National Instruments. Two major challenges of the study were the correct measurement of the fundamental voltage and current waveforms, and the appropriate/accurate reconstruction, manipulation and display of these signals within the software. Identification, and minimisation or correction, of measurement errors was an important factor in achieving maximum accuracy prior to software interpretation of the data. Testing and calibration were carried out with the aim of providing the most accurate signal measurement prior to data acquisition and rescaling by the software program. Industry-standard design and manufacture techniques were implemented to produce a high-quality hardware package featuring a printed circuit board, <b>ingress</b> <b>protection</b> (IP) <b>rated</b> enclosure and screened multicore signal cabling. The potential uses and benefits of the analyser include monitoring loads in factory floor or manufacturing environments where production costs are of significant importance; in this instance, multiple analysers could be in place over the floor to aid operators. Smaller companies using smaller amounts of large machinery may implement a PC-based system as a cheaper alternative to an expensive all-in-one unit. The study concluded that a reasonably accurate PC-based analyser could be produced on a small budget; it also highlighted the many advantages of a PC-based system in terms of usability, customisation and flexibility. A critical evaluation of the system’s performance compared to a benchmark model and further suggestions for improvement are included...|$|R
