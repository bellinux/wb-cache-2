5|$|The {{function}} of the toxins to the hooded pitohui has {{been the source of}} debate and research since its discovery. The initial suggestion was that the toxins acted as a chemical deterrent to predators. Some researchers cautioned this suggestion was premature, and others noted that the levels of batrachotoxins were three orders of magnitude lower than in the poison dart frogs that <b>do</b> <b>use</b> it in this way.|$|E
5|$|The procellariids {{lack the}} {{elaborate}} breeding dances of the albatrosses, {{in no small}} part due to the tendency of most of them to attend colonies at night and breed in burrows, where visual displays are useless. The fulmarine petrels, which nest on the surface and attend their colonies diurnally, <b>do</b> <b>use</b> a repertoire of stereotyped behaviours such as cackling, preening, head waving and nibbling, but for most species courtship interactions are limited to some billing (rubbing the two bills together) in the burrow and the vocalisations made by all species. The calls serve a number of functions: they are used territorially to protect burrows or territories and to call for mates. Each call type is unique to a particular species and indeed it is possible for procellariids to identify the sex of the bird calling as well. It may also be possible to assess the quality of potential mates; a study of blue petrels found a link between the rhythm and duration of calls and the body mass of the bird. The ability of an individual to recognise its mate has also been demonstrated in several species.|$|E

Both PET and SPECT scans require the injection of radioactive materials, but the half-lives of isotopes used in SPECT can be more easily managed.|$|E
25|$|The {{patterns}} of spawning and {{movement of the}} juveniles differs between the eastern and western populations. In the western population, unlike many co-occurring sillaginids, stout whiting do not move inshore to spawn and the juveniles do not {{make their way to}} shallower waters; instead they spawn offshore, with the fish spending their entire lives in this environment. In contrast, the eastern population <b>do</b> <b>use</b> inshore nursery areas for the juveniles including bays and surf beaches, with this difference between populations attributed to increased competition between sillaginids by some authors. In both populations, spawning occurs over summer, with the fish spawning multiple times between December and March.|$|E
25|$|Among {{people who}} <b>do</b> <b>use</b> {{intravenous}} drugs {{and have a}} fever {{in the emergency room}}, there is about a 10% to 15% prevalence of endocarditis. This estimate is not substantially changed by whether the doctor believes the patient has a trivial explanation for their fever. Weisse found that 13% of 121 patients had endocarditis. Marantz also found a prevalence of endocarditis of 13% among such patients in the emergency room with fever. Samet found a 6% incidence among 283 such patients, but after excluding patients with initially apparent major illness to explain the fever (including 11 cases of manifest endocarditis), there was a 7% prevalence of endocarditis.|$|E

25|$|Peter the Great, Czar of Russia, {{mandated}} {{the use of}} westernized letter {{forms in}} the early 18th century. Over time, these were largely adopted in the other languages that use the script. Thus, unlike the majority of modern Greek fonts that retained their own set of design principles for lower-case letters (such as the placement of serifs, the shapes of stroke ends, and stroke-thickness rules, although Greek capital letters <b>do</b> <b>use</b> Latin design principles), modern Cyrillic fonts are {{much the same as}} modern Latin fonts of the same font family. The development of some Cyrillic computer typefaces from Latin ones has also contributed to the visual Latinization of Cyrillic type.|$|E
25|$|Laotians and Cambodians have {{a common}} belief that the Irrawaddy {{dolphins}} are reincarnations of their ancestors. Some even claim that the dolphins have saved drowning villagers and protected people from attacks by crocodiles. With their beliefs and experiences, it has led the people of Laos and Cambodia to live peacefully alongside one another for ages until recent years when the technique of using explosives for fishing has emerged. The government of Laos has made it illegal to use such tactics, but few regulations {{have been made in}} its neighboring country of Cambodia. In Cambodia, explosives are sold in local markets and the practice of using fishnets has been abandoned. The practice of using explosives instead has become very popular and led to a stead decline of populations of fish, and especially the dolphins swimming in the area. Although Laotians may not use explosives, they <b>do</b> <b>use</b> nylon gill nets, which pose as another large threat in the survival of the Irrawaddy. Some dolphins will accidentally become entangled in the net. Poor fishermen refuse to cut and destroy their nets because it would result in too great of an economic loss to save one Irrawaddy dolphin.|$|E
25|$|Supra{{threshold}} tests, {{which provide}} intensities of taste stimuli above threshold levels, {{are used to}} assess the patient's ability to differentiate between different intensities of taste and to estimate the magnitude of suprathreshold loss of taste. From these tests, ratings of pleasantness can be obtained using either the direct scaling or magnitude matching method and may be of value in the diagnosis of dysgeusia. Direct scaling tests show the ability to discriminate among different intensities of stimuli and whether a stimulus of one quality (sweet) is stronger or weaker than a stimulus of another quality (sour). Direct scaling cannot be used to determine if a taste stimulus is being perceived at abnormal levels. In this case, magnitude matching is used, in which a patient is asked to rate the intensities of taste stimuli and stimuli of another sensory system, such as the loudness of a tone, on a similar scale. For example, the Connecticut Chemosensory Clinical Research Center asks patients to rate the intensities of NaCl, sucrose, citric acid and quinine-HCl stimuli, and the loudness of 1000Hz tones. Assuming normal hearing, the results of this cross-sensory test show the relative strength of the sense of taste in relation to the loudness of the auditory stimulus. Although many of the tests are based on ratings using the direct scaling method, some tests <b>do</b> <b>use</b> the magnitude-matching procedure.|$|E
