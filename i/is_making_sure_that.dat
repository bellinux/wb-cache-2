Rotation of the body over the bar occurs naturally, and the vaulter's main concern <b>is</b> <b>making</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> their arms, face and any other appendages do not knock the bar off as they go over. The vaulter should land near the middle of the foam landing mats, or pits, face up.|$|E
