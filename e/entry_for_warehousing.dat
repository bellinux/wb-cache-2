Typically, demand <b>for</b> <b>warehouse</b> space has been modeled using population or employment measures. Unlike previous work, warehouse inventory, rather than employment, is used to model space demand. Warehouse inventory is proxied by data on freight shipments. Detailed information on the location and freight activity of manufacturing plants and distribution centers across the United States, Dallas, Los Angeles, and Seattle is used. Warehouse employment is then compared to freight shipments in determining demand <b>for</b> <b>warehouse</b> space. Preliminary results are mixed and the sample size of the metro areas examined should be increased in future work. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} problem {{addressed in this}} study was to analyse and report on the potential use of Spoornet’s excess warehousing to support the Industrial Development Zones (IDZs) in the Eastern Cape. In order to achieve this objective, a literature study was undertaken to ascertain the world-class practices <b>for</b> <b>warehousing.</b> A study was conducted on Spoornet strategy in order to determine whether the company can apply its existing strategy <b>for</b> <b>warehouse</b> operations. The empirical results obtained, indicated {{that there would be a}} need <b>for</b> <b>warehousing</b> to support the IDZs in the Eastern Cape. There would be opportunities for storage of raw materials, distribution of parts for production, and finished goods to be delivered to consumers. Spoornet has gained ground on its competitor with respect to logistics and has progressed with its “Freight Logistics Solution” initiative. In conclusion it was recommended that Spoornet uses its existing strategy and convert their goods sheds into world-class warehousing. The warehouse space can be used as a trade-off to gain rail clients...|$|R
