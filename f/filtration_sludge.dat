40|$|Water reuse {{is called}} the {{greatest}} challenge of the 21 st century. It is the only solution to close the loop between water supply and wastewater disposal. In {{many parts of the}} world reclaimed water is used as a water resource. The membrane bioreactor (MBR) provides a number of environmental benefits. The growing demand for clean and safe water is not only pushing users to limit the use of fresh water, but also to reuse wastewater. The MBR technology is a cost-effective, sustainable solution for new, efficient, advanced municipal wastewater treatment. Continuing development and adaptability of the MBR technology creates the opportunity for a widespread use in Croatia, particularly in the coastal areas and river banks which belong to the sensitive recipient zone. The by-products of the membrane <b>filtration,</b> <b>sludge</b> and water, can be reused for different purposes, i. e. for watering green surfaces, or in case of the sludge, for fertilizing in agriculture Water reuse is built upon three principles:- providing reliable treatment of wastewater to meet strict water quality requirements foe the intended reuse application- protecting public health- gaining public acceptance Water reuse application includes:- agricultural irrigation- tourism: golf and tennis course watering- landscape watering including the irrigation of parks, playgrounds, green surfaces- industrial activities for cooling, process needs- non-potable uses: toilet flushing, fire protection, flushing of sanitary sewers 72...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} pH on {{chemical}} conditioning with potassium ferrate (K 2 FeO 4) for improving <b>sludge</b> <b>filtration</b> dewatering performance has been studied. The variation of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) in conditioning process {{was investigated in}} detail to unravel the reaction mechanism. The results indicated that sludge dewaterability was improved by decreasing solution pH in terms of filtration rate and cake solids content. At acid conditions, protonation of EPS resulted in reduction of negative charge and densification of sludge floc. Sludge conditioning efficiency was improved with decrease in pH. Ferrate can solubilize EPS through oxidation process and also remove a portion of soluble EPS (SEPS) by charge neutralization and interfacial adsorption of hydrolyzed ferric ions, consequently compressing EPS and decreasing total extractable EPS content. In addition, when pH and potassium ferrate were 3 and 0. 1 g/gTSS, the <b>sludge</b> <b>filtration</b> dewatering rate and extent reached the maximum. Deterioration of sludge dewaterability was observed as the ferrate was overdosed (> 0. 2 g/gTSS).

Therefore, after the initial degradation reaction has reached the plateau phase (usually at about day 21), another aliquot of the test substance (with or without the toxicity control) is added. To avoid oxygen entering the system, this is done, e.g. under a nitrogen atmosphere.

Three laboratory and pilot scale, diffused air activated sludge units were operated as continuous plug-flow tapered aeration systems at constant temperatures of 10 C, 20 C and 30 C. Dissolved oxygen was maintained at about 2 mg/l and the sludge was recycled {{at the same rate}} as the sewage feed rate for all the three units. Synthetic sewage was fed to each unit at four different detention periods namely 5, 3, 1. 5 and 1 hour in turn including the return sludge. At each detention period the effect of four different concentrations of mixed liquor suspended solids of 2, 000, 3, 000, 4, 000 and 5, 000 mg/l were investigated. Operational parameters for each run measured included BOD 5, COD, mixed liquor suspended solids, suspended solids, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, pH, free and saline ammonia, nitrite, nitrate, organic nitrogen, sludge volume index, sludge production, specific resistance to <b>filtration</b> of <b>sludge,</b> anionic surface active agent, air flow rates and total phosphates. In addition microscopic examination of the activated sludges vas,carried out occasionally. The results obtained indicated that BOD 5 and COD removal efficiencies, air requirements, nitrification increase with an increase in temperature from 10 C to 30 C. Nitrogen loss is caused by aerobic denitr 1 fication. Complete removal of nitrogen in sewage is possible by aerobic nitr 1 fication-denitrif 1 cation process in the aeration tank of a single-stage activated sludge unit at 30 C and at high loading.

The evolution of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) distribution, composition and morphological properties were analyzed to unravel the sludge conditioning mechanism. It was found that <b>sludge</b> <b>filtration</b> performance was deteriorated due to release of {{a large amount of}} biopolymers after enzymatic treatment. The change in EPS followed the pseudo-first-order kinetic equation well under enzymatic treatment. The feeding modes of enzymes had a significant influence on sludge lysis efficiency under compound enzymes treatment. Alpha amylase + protease was more effective in solubilization than other two addition modes (protease + alpha-amylase or simultaneous addition). The sludge floc re-formed and macromolecule biopolymers were effectively removed through coagulation process. At the same time, both of filtration rate and cake solid content of sludge treated with enzymes were improved with increasing dosage of coagulants, and ferric iron (FeCl 3) had better performance in sludge dewaterability enhancement than polyaluminium chloride (PACl).

40|$|The paper investigates {{and compares}} the {{characteristics}} of sludges produced by membrane Bio-Reactor (MBR) and Conventional Activated Sludge (CAS) systems. Stability and dewaterability of full-scale MBR and CAS treatment plants are measured and compared. Obtained results show that specific methane production is higher in CAS sludge compared to MBR sludge because of the higher solid retention time of the MBR. Nonetheless MBR sludge results to be characterized by a non-negligible biometanation potential (BMP). Methane production measured during BMP tests is around 250 NmL/gVS for MBR sludge, equaling 2 / 3 of methane production obtained, in similar condition, for CAS sludge. Dewaterability is evaluated by Specific Resistance to Filtration (SRF), Capillary Suction Time (CST) and Time To Filter (TTF) tests.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{combined}} calcium peroxide (CaO 2) oxidation with chemical re-flocculation on dewatering performance and physicochemical properties of {{waste activated sludge}} was investigated in this study. The evolutions of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) distribution, composition and morphological properties were analyzed to unravel the sludge conditioning mechanism. It was found that <b>sludge</b> <b>filtration</b> performance was enhanced by calcium peroxide oxidation with the optimal dosage of 20 mg/gTSS. However, this enhancement was not observed at lower dosages due {{to the absence of}} oxidation and the performance deteriorated at higher dosages because of the release of excess EPS, mainly as protein like substances. The variation in soluble EPS (SEPS) component can be fitted well with pseudo-zero-order kinetic model under CaO 2 treatment. At the same time, extractable EPS content (SEPS and loosely bound EPS (LB-EPS)) were dramatically increased, indicating sludge flocs were effectively broken and their structure became looser after CaO 2 addition. The sludge floc structure was reconstructed and sludge dewaterability was significantly enhanced using chemical re-flocculation (polyaluminium chloride (PACT), ferric iron (FeCl 3) and polyacrylamide (PAM)). The inorganic coagulants performed better in improving <b>sludge</b> <b>filtration</b> dewatering performance and reducing cake moisture content than organic polymer, since they could act as skeleton builders and decrease the sludge compressibility.

The optimal dosage of FX flocculants was 4 mg/L based on the field test, at which the SS content of treated oil field wastewater reduced sharply within 10 hours. The 15 mg/L of the FX-F would be the most convenient to form the sludge layer. Taking FX-F as flocculants, the oil field wastewater was treated in the micro-flocculation suspended <b>sludge</b> <b>filtration</b> process, and the results showed that the SS and Oil of wastewater could be significantly be reduced. In the end, the average oil content was lower than 1 mg/L and the removal rate can reach 99 %, and the average content and the removal efficiency of SS was 1. 26 mg/L and 95 % respectively, which can really meet the standards for oil field rejection water...|$|R
40|$|Two {{non-invasive}} {{techniques were}} evaluated for the online measurement of sludge solidosity profiles during both pressure and electrodewatering operations. In a first approach, a radioactive tracer adsorbed onto the sludge solids was monitored by a gamma camera. Although this technique appeared very flexible in use, {{the lack of}} resoln. highly limited its usefulness for (electro) dewatering expts. Improvement in gamma camera resoln. {{by the development of}} new detectors might, however, increase the future applicability of this technique. In a second technique, NMR measurements on a specially designed electrodewatering unit were made. Hereby, reliable online measurements of the solidosity profiles of activated sludge during electrodewatering could be made, with a resoln. of less than 1 mm. Thus, the mechanisms of electroosmotic- and pressure-driven cake dewatering could be illustrated. Given the measurement time required for measuring one sludge profile, both techniques appeared mainly suited for slowly varying processes, such as activated sludge expression, and not for fast changing processes, such as the initial phases of <b>sludge</b> <b>filtration.</b> [on SciFinder (R) ...|$|R

40|$|The Textile Industry {{makes a big}} {{contribution}} to the economic growth due to high demands locally and from abroad. But, textile industry {{is one of the}} most chemically intensive industries on the earth and the major polluter of portable water. Wastewater from dyeing in textile plant is often rich in colour, containing residual of dyes and chemical. This wastewater needs proper treatment before releasing into the environment. The purpose of study is to determine the characteristic of treated tenun dye wastewater and effect of Hydraulic Retention Time (HRT) of 24 hours, 48 hours and 72 hours. Membrane Bioreactor (MBR) is used to treat tenun dye wastewater with addition activated sludge to assist biodegradation of tenun dye wastewater. Membrane bioreactor is process combination of activated sludge treatment and membrane <b>filtration.</b> Activated <b>sludge</b> is an active biological material produced by activated sludge plants, especially in aerobic, anaerobic and aeration system. The parameters that have observed were COD, BOD, TSS, Colour and MISS. The results show that the COD value is decrease on 48 hour and increase in 72 hour. While BOD results show that from initial value, the value for 24 hour is decrease and then the value increase in 72 hour. The value of BOD supposed to decrease with increasing time. The TSS value is decrease since the particle cannot pass through the filter as the particle blocked in time during filtration. Then the MLSS is increase due to growth of microorganism. The high percentage color removal is 24 %. It is show that MBR has potential to remove the particles that available in tenun dye wastewater. The data collected is used to improve the effectiveness of the research of dye treatment using MBR...|$|R
40|$|Dynamic {{membrane}} (DM) {{formation in}} dynamic membrane bioreactors {{plays an important}} role in achieving efficient solid-liquid separation. In order to study the contribution of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) to DM formation in anaerobic dynamic membrane bioreactor (AnDMBR) processes, EPS extraction from and re-addition to bulk sludge were carried out in short-term filtration tests. DM formation behaviors could be well simulated by cake <b>filtration</b> model, and <b>sludge</b> with EPS re-addition showed the highest resistance coefficient, followed by sludge after EPS extraction. The DM layers exhibited a higher resistance and a lower porosity for the sludge sample after EPS extraction and for the sludge with EPS re-addition. Particle size of sludge flocs decreased after EPS extraction, and changed little with EPS re-addition, which was confirmed by interaction energy analysis. Further investigations by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) analysis and batch tests suggested that the removal of in-situ EPS stimulated release of soluble EPS, and re-added EPS were present as soluble EPS rather than bound EPS, which thus improved the formation of DM. The present work revealed the role of EPS in anaerobic DM formation, and could facilitate the operation of AnDMBR processes...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} adding {{activated}} carbon on the fouling of activated <b>sludge</b> <b>filtration</b> was investigated using a complete-mix cell with a flat-sheet cellulosic membrane {{at a constant}} pressure gradient of 70 kN/m 2. Four sludge samples were tested in parallel: a sludge without additive served as control, plus three sludge samples dosed with individual additives, including inert diatomaceous earth, activated carbon pre-sorbed with 112 mg-C/g of EPS (extracellular polymeric substance), and virgin activated carbon. Results showed that the EPS of activated sludge was a major contributor of membrane fouling. Additives may reduce the filtration resistance of the film deposited on the membrane surface, depending upon their EPS-sorbing capacity. As compared with the control, virgin activated carbon reduced the film filtration resistance by 22 %, from 6. 4 ± 0. 5 × 1012 m- 1 to 5. 0 ± 0. 1 × 1012 m- 1, whereas the reduction was only 14 % by the activated carbon pre-sorbed with EPS and negligible by the inert diatomaceous earth. Of the three main constituents of EPS, polysaccharide and humic substance were of significance to the fouling; protein had little effect. © 2006 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Prevention {{and removal}} of fouling {{is often the}} most energy {{intensive}} process in Membrane Bioreactors (MBRs), responsible for 40 % to 50 % of the total specific energy consumed in submerged MBRs. In the past decade, methods were developed to quantify and qualify fouling, aiming to support optimization in MBR operation. Therefore, {{there is a need}} for an evaluation of the lessons learned and how to proceed. In this article, five different methods for measuring MBR activated sludge filterability and critical flux are described, commented and evaluated. Both parameters characterize the fouling potential in full-scale MBRs. The article focuses on the Delft Filtration Characterization method (DFCm) as a convenient tool to characterize sludge properties, namely on data processing, accuracy, reproducibility, reliability, and applicability, defining the boundaries of the DFCm. Significant progress was made concerning fouling measurements in particular by using straight forward approaches focusing on the applicability of the obtained results. Nevertheless, a fouling measurement method is still to be defined which is capable of being unequivocal, concerning the fouling parameters definitions; practical and simple, in terms of set-up and operation; broad and useful, in terms of obtained results. A step forward would be the standardization of the aforementioned method to assess the <b>sludge</b> <b>filtration</b> quality. Water ManagementCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
40|$|Pore fouling of four {{microfiltration}} membranes {{was investigated}} for the <b>filtration</b> of activated <b>sludge</b> using sonication {{as the means}} to remove the cake layer from membrane surface. Results show that pore fouling was affected by membrane's microstructure, pore openings and hydrophilicity. For the track-etched polycarbonate (PC) membrane, there was no measurable pore resistance (Rp) to filtration. For the three membranes of sponge-like microstructure, the respective Rp values were 0. 3 × 10 11, 1. 3 × 1011, and 16. 4 × 1011 m- 1 for polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), mixed cellulose esters (MCE), and polyethersulfone (PES). The PES membrane had the highest Rp due to its large pore openings (18 - 20 μm), whereas MCE had higher Rp than PVDF because of its higher hydrophilicity. The Rp of PES membrane accounted for 86 % of the total resistance for its filtration of activated sludge; the corresponding values were merely 2 % for PVDF and 11 % for MCE. It increased with the suspended solids level of the activated sludge {{to the power of}} 0. 56. Results further demonstrated that Rp-dominant type of membranes, such as PES, was unsuitable for the membrane bioreactors. © 2005 Elsevier B. V.
