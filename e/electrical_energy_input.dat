40|$|The {{original}} ARID (Algae Raceway Integrated Design) raceway was {{an effective}} method to increase temperature toward the optimal growth range. However, the <b>energy</b> <b>input</b> {{was high and}} flow mixing was poor. Thus, the ARID-HV (High Velocity Algae Raceway Integrated Design) raceway was developed to reduce <b>energy</b> <b>input</b> requirements and improve flow mixing. This was accomplished by improving pumping efficiency and using a serpentine flow pattern in which the water flows through channels instead of over barriers. A prototype ARID-HV system was installed in Tucson, Arizona, and the constructability, reliability of components, drainage of channels, and flow and energy requirements of the ARID-HV raceway were evaluated. Each of the <b>electrical</b> <b>energy</b> <b>inputs</b> to the raceway (air sparger, air tube blower, canal lift pump, and channel recirculation pump) was quantified, some by direct measurement and others by simulation. An algae growth model {{was used to determine}} the algae production rate vs. flow depth and time of year. Then the <b>electrical</b> <b>energy</b> requirement of the most effective flow depth was calculated. Channel hydraulics was evaluated with Manning's equation and the corner head loss equation. In this way, the maximum length of channels for several raceway slopes and mixing velocities were determined. Algae production in the ARID-HV raceway was simulated with a temperature and light growth model. An energy efficient design for the ARID-HV raceway was developed...|$|R

The performance of the {{heating elements}} was studied in, an "unheated" plastic tunnel and in a single glazed glasshouse heated to 5 degrees C by means of a conventional pipe heating system. Heating elements were spaced 1, 1. 5, and 2 m apart and the effect on vegetation temperature was followed. To simulate the maximal performance of the radiative heating elements, a simple steady state model describing vegetation and element temperatures as a function of inside climate, temperature of the surroundings and power input into the elements was built.

The no-load speed is the number of rotations per minute of the motor shaft when voltage is applied between the terminals with no load to the motor. No-load current is the current discharged when voltage is applied between the terminals with no load to the motor. Stall torque is when the motor rotation stalls upon increasing the load to the rotating motor, while stall current is when the motor rotation stalls upon increasing the load to the rotating motor.

Energy is released by the combustion and heat flow from this crosses the stainless steel wall, thus raising {{the temperature of the}} steel bomb, its contents, and the surrounding water jacket. The temperature change in the water is then accurately measured with a thermometer.

Recently, we have shown that these water-insoluble organometallic complexes, when included into micelles formed by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), are good catalysts for the electrochemical production of hydrogen in aqueous solutions at pH< 6. We herein report that the all-CO derivative [Fe 2 (μ-bdt) (CO) 6] (1), owing to its comparatively low reduction potential, is also a robust molecular catalyst for visible-light-driven production of H 2 in aqueous SDS solutions at pH  10. 5. Irradiation at λ= 455  nm of a system consisting of complex 1, Eosin Y as a sensitizer, and triethylamine as an electron donor produced up to 0. 86  mL of H 2 in 4. 5  h, corresponding to a turnover number of 117  mol of H 2 per mol of catalyst. In {{the presence of a}} large excess of sensitizer, the production of H 2 lasted for more than 30  h, stressing the relative stability of complex 1 under the photocatalytic conditions used herein. Thermodynamic considerations and UV/Vis spectroscopy experiments suggest that the catalytic cycle begins with the photo-driven reduction of complex 1. The reduced intermediate reacts with a proton source to yield iron hydride. Subsequent reduction and protonation steps produce H 2, regenerating the starting complex. As a result, the iron–thiolate complex 1 is a versatile proton reduction catalyst that can utilize either solar or <b>electrical</b> <b>energy</b> <b>inputs,</b> providing a starting point for the construction of noble metal-free molecular systems for renewable H 2 production...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} control of the <b>electrical</b> <b>energy</b> <b>input</b> to a three-phase electric arc furnace (EAF). Graphite electrodes are used to convert electrical energy into heat via three-phase electric arcs. Constant arc length is desirable as it implies steady energy transfer from the graphite electrodes to the metallic charge in the furnace bath. With the charge level constantly changing, the electrodes must be able to adjust for the arc length to remain constant. In this dissertation electric arc current is used as the control variable. This is the most often used control variable in the electric arc furnace industry and implies fast adjustments of short circuits between the electrode tips and the metallic charge. The motivation behind the modelling of the electrode system for a three-phase electric arc furnace is to extend an existing EAF model developed at the University of Pretoria. The existing model investigates {{the control of}} the electric arc furnace process itself and it is assumed that the applied <b>electrical</b> <b>energy</b> <b>input</b> is constant. Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control as well as Model-Predictive-Control (MPC) is applied to the electrode system. Time delays on the outputs of the hydraulic actuators makes it necessary to include approximations of time delays on the outputs of the linear model, which is needed for controller design.
