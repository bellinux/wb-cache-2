5|$|Donnchadh's {{career is}} not well <b>documented</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{surviving}} sources. Charters provide a little information about some of his activities, but overall their usefulness is limited; this is because no charter-collections (called cartularies) from the Gaelic south-west have survived the Middle Ages, and the only surviving charters relevant to Donnchadh's career come from the heavily Normanised English-speaking area to the east. Principally, the relevant charters record his acts of patronage towards religious houses, but incidental details mentioned {{in the body of}} these texts and the witness lists subscribed to them are useful for other matters.|$|E

The recipe entailed soaking butter in salted water for a few hours, placing it on a rotisserie ("spit it"), covering it with breadcrumbs and nutmeg, and roasting it under a low fire while continuously covering it with egg yolks and additional bread crumbs. Oysters were recommended to accompany the dish.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about the design of the first castle at Rochester as it has since vanished, and even the exact site is uncertain. It most likely took the form of a motte-and-bailey castle, with a mound and an outer {{enclosure}} defended by a timber palisade and earthen banks. Boley Hill has been suggested as the site of the first castle, an outwork reinforcing the castle's defences, or an abandoned siege castle like those <b>documented</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1088 siege. Boley Hill is a natural outcrop of rock, and could have acted as a motte.|$|E

5|$|The case baffles Colton, as {{the only}} common {{elements}} in the murders are the lack of entry points and the apparent removal of the victims' livers with bare hands. Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) looks over the case and notes their similarity to earlier murder sprees that occurred in 1933 and 1963. At the crime scene, Mulder notices an elongated fingerprint on the air vent, which he also finds {{to be similar to}} some <b>documented</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> X-Files. He concludes that because five murders occurred during the earlier sprees, the investigators should expect two more.|$|E
