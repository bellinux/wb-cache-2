40|$|A load-balanced {{two-stage}} switch is scalable and {{can provide}} close to 100 % throughput. Its major {{problem is that}} packets can be mis-sequenced when they arrive at outputs. In a recent work, the packet mis-sequencing problem is elegantly solved by a feedback-based switch architecture. In this paper, we extend the feedback-based switch from two-stage to three-stage for further cutting down average packet delay while still ensuring in-order packet delivery and close to 100 % throughput. The basic idea {{is to use the}} third stage switch to map <b>heavy</b> <b>flows</b> to experience less middle-stage delays. To identity <b>heavy</b> <b>flows,</b> an adaptive traffic estimation algorithm is proposed. To ensure maxmin fairness in bandwidth allocation under any inadmissible traffic pattern, an efficient fair scheduler is devised. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The influences of spindle rotating rate, lubricating oil dynamic viscosity and inlet flow rate on the lubricating oil film dynamic pressure effect of the <b>heavy</b> constant <b>flow</b> hydrostatic center rest were analyzed based on the computational fluid dynamics and lubrication theory, and the influencing laws were revealed. By means of this method, the reasonable data can be provided for reasonably controlling dynamic pressure and structure optimal design of the <b>heavy</b> constant <b>flow</b> hydrostatic center rest...|$|R
2500|$|The {{future of}} the park's much larger eastern section {{remained}} in doubt for almost fifty years. The backcountry was largely inaccessible and unknown to tourists, requiring several days' journey on horseback through some very rugged terrain. Instead, the area was targeted by water supply and power interests including the city of Los Angeles, who wanted to build hydroelectric dams in Kings Canyon. Due to its <b>heavy</b> <b>flow</b> and long drop – [...] in less than [...] – the Kings River has considerable hydroelectric potential, and reservoirs were proposed for Cedar Grove, Tehipite Valley and Simpson Meadow, among other sites. Development interests blocked legislation {{that would have made}} the area a national park, but at the same time, the environmental lobby prevented any of these projects from being built.|$|E
2500|$|In 1880, Minneapolis was {{a flourishing}} {{business}} city with major commerce mostly {{located on the}} west bank of the Mississippi River, while smaller, up-and-coming businesses were on the east. With the merging of the Village of St. Anthony on the east side, Minneapolis continuously grew in population, and the Hennepin Avenue suspension bridge served as the sole thoroughfare for commuters and pedestrians. [...] At that time, the Hennepin Avenue bridge was overused and in desperate need of upkeep. [...] The city’s network of railroads, which was crucial for urbanization, was also located on the east side of the river. [...] With the rapid increase in commercialization, Minneapolis businessmen sought a plan to accommodate the <b>heavy</b> <b>flow</b> of traffic, and immediately considered the railroad mogul James J. Hill for the task. [...] The idea was to build a railroad depot, similar to the St. Paul Union Depot, along the intersections of Hennepin Avenue and Nicollet Avenue in downtown Minneapolis, which would also connect to the Manitoba Road tracks, eventually developing into the Great Northern Railway.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a survey}} in 1958, the {{geologist}} C.C. Fagg identified 25 active swallow holes between Dorking and Mickleham; most {{were only a}} few centimetres in diameter and were located in the vertical banks of the river below the water line. Most holes were difficult to observe in times of normal or <b>heavy</b> <b>flow</b> and were susceptible to silting up as new holes were continually being formed. A few much larger swallow holes were also observed separated from the main river by a channel of about a metre. About six of these larger swallow holes were found {{to the west of the}} Burford Bridge Hotel, along the course of the A24 Mickleham Bypass during its construction in 1936. Initially the surveyors tried to fill the holes with rubble to prevent the foundations of the new road subsiding. However this proved to be impractical and they were instead covered by concrete domes, up to 18 m in diameter, each fully supported by the surrounding chalk and provided with a manhole and access shaft to allow periodic inspection. In the late 1960s the domes were reopened and inspected and the alluvium in the largest swallow hole was observed to have subsided by [...] under the centre of one of the domes. When the Dorking to Leatherhead railway was constructed in 1859, a fossilised swallow hole was discovered in the cutting at the south end of Box Hill and Westhumble railway station, suggesting that even in its early history, the river had swallow holes.|$|E
40|$|Identifying the "heavy hitter" flows or flows {{with large}} traffic volumes {{in the data}} plane is {{important}} for several applications e. g., flow-size aware routing, DoS detection, and traffic engineering. However, measurement in the data plane is constrained by the need for line-rate processing (at 10 - 100 Gb/s) and limited memory in switching hardware. We propose HashPipe, a heavy hitter detection algorithm using emerging programmable data planes. HashPipe implements a pipeline of hash tables which retain counters for <b>heavy</b> <b>flows</b> while evicting lighter flows over time. We prototype HashPipe in P 4 and evaluate it with packet traces from an ISP backbone link and a data center. On the ISP trace (which contains over 400, 000 flows), we find that HashPipe identifies 95 % of the 300 <b>heaviest</b> <b>flows</b> with less than 80 KB of memory.
