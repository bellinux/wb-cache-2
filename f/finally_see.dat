5|$|When Scott finally read Zelda's book, a {{week after}} she'd sent it to Perkins, he was furious. The book was a semi-autobiographical account of the Fitzgeralds' marriage. In letters, Scott berated her and fumed that the novel had drawn upon the autobiographical {{material}} {{that he planned to}} use in Tender Is the Night, which he'd been working on for years, and which would <b>finally</b> <b>see</b> publication in 1934.|$|E

Anna {{turns out to be}} Harry's daughter and the two step siblings begin an illicit affair. They pledge their lives to one another. When Harry and Nemo's mother break up, Anna goes to New York with her father, and they lose touch. Years later, Nemo works as a pool cleaner, hoping to run into Anna by chance. They <b>finally</b> <b>see</b> one another at the train station and immediately recognize each other in a crowd of passers-by. After a passionate reunion, Anna announces she is not ready to immediately resume the relationship. She gives him her number, asks him to call her in two days and meet at the lighthouse.

5|$|Late in the year, AT/Western Electric {{created a}} {{licensing}} division, Electrical Research Products Inc. (ERPI), to handle {{rights to the}} company's film-related audio technology. Vitaphone still had legal exclusivity, but having lapsed in its royalty payments, effective control of the rights was in ERPI's hands. On December 31, 1926, Warners granted Fox-Case a sublicense {{for the use of}} the Western Electric system; in exchange for the sublicense, both Warners and ERPI received a share of Fox's related revenues. The patents of all three concerns were cross-licensed. Superior recording and amplification technology was now available to two Hollywood studios, pursuing two very different methods of sound reproduction. The new year would <b>finally</b> <b>see</b> the emergence of sound cinema as a significant commercial medium.|$|E
5|$|Mulder goes {{to visit}} Madame Zirinka again, who {{tells him that}} the planets come into {{alignment}} like this only once every 84 years, and additional alignments will cause anyone born on January 12, 1979 (Margi and Terri's birthdate) {{to have all the}} energy in the cosmos focused on them. Margi goes to see Scott alone but an angry Terri arrives. The two argue with each other and end up accidentally killing Scott. Margi goes to Mulder, telling him that Terri is responsible for the murders, while Terri goes to see Scully and tells her the opposite. The agents call each other and bring both girls to the police station, where the place starts shaking and all the guns go off on their own. Mulder locks the girls in a room together and their power goes away once the clock ticks midnight. When the town mob and Detective White <b>finally</b> <b>see</b> Terri and Margi as the culprits, Spitz claims it was the work of Satan, oblivious to the cosmic alignment's energy. Mulder and Scully drive home, arguing again over directions; when Scully defiantly runs a stop sign, Mulder notifies her but she tells him to shut up, which he does.|$|E
5|$|There {{was also}} the {{secondary}} capital city of Luoyang, which was the favored capital of the two by Empress Wu. In the year 691 she had more than 100,000 families (more than 500,000 people) from around the region of Chang'an move to populate Luoyang instead. With {{a population of about}} a million, Luoyang became the second largest city in the empire, and with its close proximity to the Luo River it benefited from southern agricultural fertility and trade traffic of the Grand Canal. However, the Tang court eventually demoted its capital status and did not visit Luoyang after the year 743, when Chang'an's problem of acquiring adequate supplies and stores for the year was solved. As early as 736, granaries were built at critical points along the route from Yangzhou to Chang'an, which eliminated shipment delays, spoilage, and pilfering. An artificial lake used as a transshipment pool was dredged east of Chang'an in 743, where curious northerners could <b>finally</b> <b>see</b> the array of boats found in southern China, delivering tax and tribute items to the imperial court.|$|E

25|$|Establishing {{camp in the}} bush, the two are {{separated}} when the warden goes {{out into the night}} for firewood and Cuff, hearing what he takes for a native woman's scream from another direction, heads off to investigate. He finds the woman, treed by a buffalo, and rescues her, only to realize he has now lost his way and cannot relocate the camp. The woman, Ingwamza, undertakes to lead him back to her village. When daylight comes and Cuff can <b>finally</b> <b>see</b> her clearly, he discovers Ingwamza too is a mutation; despite her generally human proportions, she has greenish-yellow hair, a short tail, and the head of a baboon. Startled, he accidentally shoots himself in the foot.|$|E
25|$|The {{execution}} {{by lethal}} injection began at 10:53pm EDT. In his final words, Davis maintained his innocence, saying:Well, first of all I'd like to address the MacPhail family. I'd like to let you all know, despite the situation – I know {{all of you are}} still convinced that I'm the person that killed your father, your son and your brother, but I am innocent. The incident that happened that night was not my fault. I did not have a gun that night. I did not shoot your family member. But I am so sorry for your loss. I really am – sincerely. All I can ask is that each of you look deeper into this case, so that you really will <b>finally</b> <b>see</b> the truth.

God bless you all. He was declared dead at 11:08pm EDT.|$|E

25|$|Shortly thereafter, a long battle {{began to}} return rail transit {{to the region}} and efforts for {{additional}} lines continue at a snail’s pace. It took 32 years to see the first line implemented. In 1972, the Regional Fixed Guideway Study for MTC proposed a $1.3 billion 37- or 57-mile (sources differ) heavy-rail rapid transit system, but the then-separate Metropolitan Council disagreed with that idea—refusing to even look at the plan—and continuing political battles prevented its implementation. The Met Council had its own plans for bus rapid transit in the Cities. Another system using smaller people movers was proposed in the 1975 Small Vehicle Fixed Guideway Study and gained the most traction with the Saint Paul city council, but was eventually dropped in 1980. In the 1980s, light rail was proposed as an alternative and several possible corridors were identified, including the Central Corridor, for which a draft environmental impact statement (DEIS) was drawn up in 1982. However, it was another two decades before the Blue Line light rail line began operation on June 26, 2004, by then, just over 50 years since the last regular-service streetcar ran on June 19, 1954, under the old Twin City Lines. Heavy-rail commuter service began on November 14, 2009, with the Northstar Line. The 2010s decade may <b>finally</b> <b>see</b> several new lines open.|$|E
500|$|Following the {{cancellation}} of the Fox television series , Carter called the series' creators Glen Morgan and Wong—who had previously been writers {{for the first two}} seasons of The X-Files—and asked if they wanted to rejoin the series. Morgan told Carter {{that the two of them}} would rejoin, but only for four episodes, and only if they could use members from the cast of Space: Above and Beyond, so that [...] "the world can <b>finally</b> <b>see</b> them". Carter accepted this condition, and the two dutifully provided four of the seasons episodes.|$|E
500|$|The {{exact nature}} of the {{substance}} that is deposited on Michael's carpet is never explicitly made clear. Fischer only described it as [...] "soft [...] smelly [...] brown". In fact, the circumstance in which the substance is viewed by the camera is still ambiguous; Television Without Pity reviewer M. Giant noted that the viewer only gets [...] "the merest out-of-focus Blair Witch glimpse" [...] of the substance. Fischer also noted {{that one of the}} more interesting aspects of the episode was the [...] "you [...] <b>finally</b> <b>see</b> Pam and Roy getting along." [...] She explained that this was because Roy and Pam returned from [...] "a romantic vacation in the Poconos." ...|$|E

500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} positive reviews from critics. The {{authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, thought well of the episode, saying, [...] "A fun episode, where you root for Bart and, unusually, Nelson - all the way through. Homer is just too stupid for words, but that's excusable because we <b>finally</b> <b>see</b> Ned Flanders lose it, big time!" [...] In 2011, Keith Plocek of LA Weeklys Squid Ink blog named the scene in which Homer tries to purchase [...] "beer that has candy floating in it" [...] (which Homer calls skittlebrau) at the Kwik-E-Mart as the fourth best food moment on the show.|$|E
500|$|Tom Robinson is {{the chief}} example among several innocents {{destroyed}} carelessly or deliberately throughout the novel. However, scholar Christopher Metress connects the mockingbird to Boo Radley: [...] "Instead of wanting to exploit Boo for her own fun (as she does {{in the beginning of}} the novel by putting on gothic plays about his history), Scout comes to see him as a 'mockingbird'—that is, as someone with an inner goodness that must be cherished." [...] The last pages of the book illustrate this as Scout relates the moral of a story Atticus has been reading to her, and, in allusions to both Boo Radley and Tom Robinson, states about a character who was misunderstood, [...] "when they finally saw him, why he hadn't done any of those things... Atticus, he was real nice," [...] to which he responds, [...] "Most people are, Scout, when you <b>finally</b> <b>see</b> them." ...|$|E
500|$|Bates paid {{two cents}} per word, {{a higher rate}} than Weird Tales, and {{attracted}} noted writers of the day. The magazine published [...] "Wolves of Darkness" [...] by Jack Williamson, [...] "Murgunstruum" [...] by Hugh B. Cave, and [...] "Cassius" [...] by Henry Whitehead. [...] Clark Ashton Smith contributed five stories, including [...] "The Return of the Sorcerer" [...] in the first issue, and Edmond Hamilton and August Derleth also appeared in the magazine. Robert E. Howard, later to become famous as the author of the Conan the Barbarian stories, sent several stories to Strange Tales; some of the stories Bates rejected, such as [...] "The Thing on the Roof" [...] and [...] "The Horror from the Mound", later appeared in Weird Tales, but Bates accepted [...] "The People of the Dark" [...] after asking for revisions, and it was published in the June 1932 issue. Howard also sold [...] "The Valley of the Lost" [...] to Bates, but it had not yet appeared when Clayton went bankrupt, and did not <b>finally</b> <b>see</b> publication until the 1960s.|$|E
50|$|After a long hiatus, 2008 <b>finally</b> <b>sees</b> {{the band}} reuniting and doing some serious touring with the 'Mosh Lives' tour {{featuring}} headliners, Emmure and other metalcore acts such as Recon, Ligeia and on select dates, Red I Flight and Endwell.|$|R

500|$|The {{love story}} {{involving}} Kurt and Blaine {{was met with}} critical acclaim, especially {{the events in the}} [...] "Original Song" [...] episode where the characters first kissed. Katie Morgan of Billboard stated, [...] "It sure took them long enough, but we're so glad to <b>finally</b> <b>see</b> Kurt happy." [...] The Boston Herald Mark Perigard wrote, [...] "It was utterly, sweetly romantic, and Criss sold {{the hell out of the}} moment. It’s long overdue and it will silence the growing legion of critics out there who were unhappy with the pace of this story and why Kurt always seemed to be stuck in pure misery." [...] Kevin Fallon of The Atlantic thought the kiss was [...] "sweet" [...] and said that he was pleased that it attracted no controversy whatsoever. Semigran praised the interaction between Kurt and Blaine, and characterized the kiss scene as a [...] "sweet, real and, shockingly, un-hyped moment". She went on to commend the acting in the scene, and wrote that both actors [...] "handled it with dignity and honesty".|$|E
500|$|... "Two Weeks" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews. Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger {{praised the}} episode and specific elements of it, like Michael {{wandering around the}} office drunk {{and many of the}} documentary-style interviews, like Charles talking about his effect on women, Toby comparing Michael to a movie on a plane and Kevin being too lazy to compliment Michael in person. But he said the episode was [...] "elevated" [...] by Michael and Pam forming a partnership at the end: [...] "Steve Carell and Jenna Fischer are always brilliant in those moments when they have to show multiple emotions at once, so it was nice to <b>finally</b> <b>see</b> them get to do it side-by-side." [...] Entertainment Weekly writer Margaret Lyons said [...] "Two Weeks" [...] offered a change that would keep the series fresh and, although he said it was [...] "not a nonstop laugh riot", he said it [...] "highlights what The Office does that few other shows ever even attempt: incredibly humane, subtle moments that contrast with the kind of chaos only ever borne of monotony." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Animal" [...] {{received}} a widely divergent mix of reviews. Harper {{wrote that the}} Warblers [...] "did {{a good job with}} it but nothing special", while Hankinson called it [...] "super adorable and fun" [...] and that it [...] "was great to <b>finally</b> <b>see</b> Kurt get to share the spotlight with Blaine". Flandez was not as pleased by Kurt—or by the Warblers, who he said had ruined the song—and likened his performance to [...] "Jar Jar Binks on acid, with those jerky moves and infantile facial expressions". Roberts called their version [...] "hokey", and Slezak said the setting [...] "felt contrived as heck" [...] and gave the song a [...] "D". Benigno was {{at the other end of}} the scale with an [...] "A" [...] grade and the summary that [...] "they completely crush it", while Gonzalez gave the number an [...] "A+", deemed it [...] "unforgettable", praised the [...] "unique song selection" [...] and called it [...] "pure fun". Futterman described the Warblers as [...] "the loosest they've been all season", but characterized the performance as one of their [...] "least successful" [...] because Blaine and Kurt, [...] "two of the series' most reliable lead singers", were severely overprocessed electronically. Tyler Glenn, lead singer of Neon Trees, said, [...] "I thought it was cool".|$|E
50|$|Meixue becomes {{depressed}} when Anxin divorces her {{for another}} woman Shuiling, so much until she becomes a bulimic.
