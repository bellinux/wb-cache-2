40|$|Abstract — Vehicular ad hoc {{networks}} (VANETs) arehigh priority safety {{applications that}} need {{medium access control}} (MAC) protocol for efficient broadcast service. The existing work presented VeMAC, a novel multi channel TDMA MAC protocol for VANET supports efficient one-hop and multi-hop broadcast services on control channel using implicit acknowledgments and eliminating hidden terminal. The drawbacks of existing work allow a node to reserve only one slot in an <b>information</b> <b>frame.</b> Once a node has reserved a slot it ceases contending for other slots. The proposed work presented an Adaptive Slot Reservation Frame Scheme for improved contention access on control channel in VeMAC. Nodes are allowed to contend {{for more than one}} slot in a reservation frame according to priority criteria. The advantages of proposed work allow nodes to reserve a slot adaptively in the <b>information</b> <b>frame</b> as per priority. Simulation methodology is adopted to eliminate the artificial boundary effect of VeMAC.

40|$|Provision of {{adequate}} and unbiased information {{is a prerequisite}} for contingent valuation. However, there remains substantial disagreement and lack of understanding regarding how information provided in the survey influences responses to valuation questions. In this study, we examine the effects of wording of the willingness-to-pay (WTP) statement (question framing), the level of information provided by the survey instrument (<b>information</b> <b>framing),</b> and prior exposure of respondents to information about the issue on WTP for a wildfire management program to reduce wildfire risk. Question framing had a statistically insignificant effect on WTP. On its own, <b>information</b> <b>framing</b> was a statistically insignificant determinant of WTP; however, became significant when prior exposure of respondents to information was accounted for. For all <b>information</b> <b>framing</b> levels considered in the study, respondents with greater prior exposure to information were found to have higher WTP than those with less prior exposure. Respondents used information provided in the survey to update their risk perceptions and WTP for the program, although the direction of change was conditional on their prior exposure to information. As the level of information provided by the survey increased, the WTP of respondents with alternative levels of prior exposure to information converged. This convergence supports calls from practitioners to better inform survey recipients about the good they are being asked to value. Our study suggests testing the level of agreement between respondents with differing levels of prior information may be desirable for increasing the level of confidence with which non-market valuation estimates may be used to support decision-making...|$|R

FPRP uses a five-phase reservation process to establish slot assignments based on time division multiple access. It allows a node to reserve only one slot in an <b>information</b> <b>frame.</b> Once a node has reserved a slot, it will cease contending for other slots. As a result, there may be less contending nodes in the remaining slots, so the time slots in an <b>information</b> <b>frame</b> are not fully used by FPRP. To improve time slot utilization, this paper proposes an improved pseudo-Bayesian algorithm, based on which an improved contention access mechanism for FPRP is proposed, in which nodes are allowed to contend {{for more than one}} slot in a reservation frame according to a certain probability/priority. Simulation results indicate that the proposed mechanism performs better than FPRP in time slot utilization and hence the network throughput under various scenarios...|$|E
