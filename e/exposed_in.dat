5|$|The rocks <b>exposed</b> <b>in</b> Bryce Canyon {{are about}} 100 million {{years younger than}} those in nearby Zion National Park, and the rocks <b>exposed</b> <b>in</b> Zion are younger {{than those in the}} Grand Canyon to the south.|$|E
5|$|In the Permian period, the Zion and Kolob {{area was}} a {{relatively}} flat basin near sea level on the western margin of the supercontinent Pangaea. Sediments from surrounding mountains added weight to the basin, keeping it at relatively the same elevation. These sediments later lithified (turned to rock) to form the Toroweap Formation, now <b>exposed</b> <b>in</b> the Grand Canyon to the south {{but not in the}} Zion and Kolob area. This formation is not <b>exposed</b> <b>in</b> the park, though it does form its basement rock.|$|E
5|$|The {{formations}} <b>exposed</b> <b>in</b> {{the area}} of the park are part of the Grand Staircase.

30|$|Regarding {{the means}} of the {{perceived}} distances, we first noticed that for every study site the perceived distances are higher than the objective ones. In Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer, every respondent lived <b>in</b> areas <b>exposed</b> to coastal flooding according to the hazards maps but they perceived living on average at 980  m from areas exposed to coastal flooding. Respondents in Barneville-Carteret perceived living on average at 245  m from exposed areas, that being 2.6 times more than the average objective distance. 27.2 % of the respondents (25 individuals) who actually lived <b>in</b> <b>exposed</b> areas (according to experts’ hazard maps) estimated that they lived <b>in</b> <b>exposed</b> areas. 9.8 % of the respondents (9 individuals) who didn’t actually live <b>in</b> <b>exposed</b> areas estimated that they didn’t live <b>in</b> <b>exposed</b> areas. 9.8 % (9 individuals) who didn’t actually live <b>in</b> <b>exposed</b> areas estimated that they lived <b>in</b> <b>exposed</b> areas. <b>In</b> Saintes-Maries-de-la-mer 34.2 % (25 individuals) who actually lived <b>in</b> <b>exposed</b> areas estimated that they lived <b>in</b> <b>exposed</b> areas. 65.8 % (48 individuals) who actually lived <b>in</b> <b>exposed</b> areas estimated that they didn’t live <b>in</b> <b>exposed</b> areas. <b>In</b> Châtelaillon-Plage respondents perceived to live on average 19.5 times more than the average objective distances. 11.1 % (8 individuals) who actually lived <b>in</b> <b>exposed</b> areas estimated that they lived <b>in</b> <b>exposed</b> areas. 54.2 % (39 individuals) who actually lived <b>in</b> <b>exposed</b> areas estimated that they didn’t live <b>in</b> <b>exposed</b> areas. 2.7 % (2 individuals) who didn’t actually live <b>in</b> <b>exposed</b> areas estimated that they lived <b>in</b> <b>exposed</b> areas. At least, respondents from Sainte-Anne who perceived to live on average 1.6 times more than the average objective distances. 7.6 % (5 individuals) who actually lived <b>in</b> <b>exposed</b> areas estimated that they lived <b>in</b> <b>exposed</b> areas. 1.5 % (1 individual) who actually lived <b>in</b> an <b>exposed</b> area estimated that he or she didn’t live <b>in</b> an <b>exposed</b> area. 12.1 % (8 individuals) who didn’t actually live <b>in</b> <b>exposed</b> areas estimated that they lived <b>in</b> <b>exposed</b> areas.|$|R

5|$|All rock now <b>exposed</b> <b>in</b> {{the area}} of the park is volcanic, but this has not always been the case. For {{hundreds}} of millions of years, the Lassen region underwent repeated uplifting to form mountains, only to have them worn down and submerged under encroaching seas. During the periods of submersion, sand, mud and limestone were deposited. Occasionally volcanic activity was associated with the mountain building.|$|E

5|$|<b>Exposed</b> <b>in</b> {{the middle}} of the {{mountain}} range is an assemblage of deformed andesite to dacite lava flows and volcanoclastic sediments.

5|$|Farther to the west, {{a complex}} island arc {{assemblage}} formed above a subduction zone. To the east, in western Colorado, a mountain range similar to today's Himalayas called the Uncompahgre Mountains bordered the Utah lowland. The interfingering of the Kaibab with the White Rim Sandstone, now <b>exposed</b> <b>in</b> Capitol Reef National Park area, {{to the east}} suggests that the marine facies of the Kaibab migrated eastward {{in response to a}} relative sea-level rise, or transgression (the White Rim is not <b>exposed</b> <b>in</b> the Zion area). The sea moved back and forth across Utah, but by the Middle Permian, the sea had withdrawn and the Kaibab Limestone was exposed to erosion, creating karst topography and channels reaching 30m (100ft) in depth.|$|E

5|$|The rocks <b>exposed</b> <b>in</b> {{the park}} were {{formed in the}} Devonian and Carboniferous periods between 370and 340million years ago, when the land {{was part of the}} {{coastline}} of a shallow sea that covered a great portion of what is now North America. The high mountains to the east of the sea gradually eroded, causing a build-up of sediment made up primarily of clay, sand and gravel.|$|E
5|$|These Precambrian igneous and {{metamorphic}} rocks underlie {{most of the}} state, and are <b>exposed</b> <b>in</b> three places: Llano uplift, Van Horn, and the Franklin Mountains, near El Paso.

5|$|Although {{the rock}} {{formations}} <b>exposed</b> <b>in</b> Colton Point State Park and the Pine Creek Gorge {{are at least}} 300million years old, the gorge itself formed about 20,000years ago, in the last ice age. Pine Creek had flowed northeasterly until then, but was dammed by rocks, soil, ice, and other debris deposited by the receding Laurentide Continental Glacier. The dammed creek formed a lake near what would later be the village of Ansonia, and the lake's glacial meltwater overflowed the debris dam, reversing the flow of Pine Creek. The creek flooded {{to the south and}} quickly carved a deep channel {{on its way to the}} West Branch Susquehanna River.|$|E
