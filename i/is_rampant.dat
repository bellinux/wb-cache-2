5|$|There is no {{consistent}} {{relationship between}} the classification of spiders {{and the types of}} web they build: species in the same genus may build very similar or significantly different webs. Nor is there much correspondence between spiders' classification and the chemical composition of their silks. Convergent evolution in web construction, in other words use of similar techniques by remotely related species, <b>is</b> <b>rampant.</b> Orb web designs and the spinning behaviors that produce them are the best understood. The basic radial-then-spiral sequence visible in orb webs and the sense of direction required to build them may have been inherited from the common ancestors of most spider groups. However, the majority of spiders build non-orb webs. It used to be thought that the sticky orb web was an evolutionary innovation resulting in the diversification of the Orbiculariae. Now, however, it appears that non-orb spiders are a sub-group that evolved from orb-web spiders, and non-orb spiders have over 40% more species and are four times as abundant as orb-web spiders. Their greater success may be because sphecid wasps, which are often the dominant predators of spiders, much prefer to attack spiders that have flat webs.|$|E

5000|$|The Talmud (Yoma 9b) {{provides}} traditional theological {{reasons for}} the destruction: [...] "Why was the first Temple destroyed? Because the three cardinal sins <b>were</b> <b>rampant</b> in society: idol worship, licentiousness, and murder… And why then was the second Temple - wherein the society was involved in Torah, commandments and acts of kindness - destroyed? Because gratuitous hatred <b>was</b> <b>rampant</b> in society. This teaches you that gratuitous hatred is equal in severity to the three cardinal sins: idol worship, licentiousness, and murder." ...|$|R
25|$|The {{number of}} {{homeless}} people worldwide has grown steadily in recent years. In some developing countries such as Nigeria, and South Africa, homelessness <b>is</b> <b>rampant,</b> with millions of children living and working on the streets. Homelessness has become {{a problem in the}} countries of China, India, Thailand, Indonesia, and the Philippines despite their growing prosperity, mainly due to migrant workers who have trouble finding permanent homes.|$|E
25|$|Until recently, the {{freshwater}} crocodile {{was common}} in northern Australia, especially where saltwater crocodiles are absent (such as more arid inland areas and higher elevations). In recent years, {{the population has}} dropped dramatically due to the ingestion of the invasive cane toad. The toad is poisonous to freshwater crocodiles, although not to saltwater crocodiles, and the toad <b>is</b> <b>rampant</b> throughout the Australian wilderness. The crocodiles are also infected by Griphobilharzia amoena, a parasitic trematode, in regions such as Darwin.|$|E
25|$|Haiti also {{suffers from}} severe {{environmental}} degradation. Deforestation <b>is</b> <b>rampant</b> in Haiti; today less than 4 percent of Haiti’s forests remain, {{and in many}} places the soil has eroded {{right down to the}} bedrock. Haitians burn wood charcoal for 60% of their domestic energy production. Because of Haiti running out of plant material to burn, Haitians have created an illegal market for coal on the Dominican side. Conservative estimates calculate the illegal movement of 115 tons of charcoal per week from the Dominican Republic to Haiti. Dominican officials estimate that at least 10 trucks per week are crossing the border loaded with charcoal.|$|E

25|$|Openly {{transsexual}} {{people can}} have difficulty maintaining employment. Most {{find it necessary to}} remain employed during transition in order to cover the costs of living and transition. However, employment discrimination against trans people <b>is</b> <b>rampant</b> {{and many of them are}} fired when they come out or are involuntarily outed at work. Transsexual people must decide whether to transition on-the-job, or to find a new job when they make their social transition. Other stresses that transsexual people face in the workplace are being fearful of coworkers negatively responding to their transition, and losing job experience under a previous name—even deciding which rest room to use can prove challenging. Finding employment can be especially challenging for those in mid-transition.|$|E
25|$|Morphine {{and other}} poppy-based {{medicines}} {{have been identified}} by the World Health Organization as essential {{in the treatment of}} severe pain. As of 2002, seven countries (USA, UK, Italy, Australia, France, Spain and Japan) use 77% of the world's morphine supplies, leaving many emerging countries lacking in pain relief medication. The current system of supply of raw poppy materials to make poppy-based medicines is regulated by the International Narcotics Control Board under the provision of the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs. The amount of raw poppy materials that each country can demand annually based on these provisions must correspond to an estimate of the country's needs taken from the national consumption within the preceding two years. In many countries, underprescription of morphine <b>is</b> <b>rampant</b> because of the high prices and the lack of training in the prescription of poppy-based drugs. The World Health Organization is now working with administrations from various countries to train healthworkers and to develop national regulations regarding drug prescription to facilitate a greater prescription of poppy-based medicines.|$|E
25|$|The {{principal}} {{attitude of}} beasts <b>is</b> <b>rampant</b> (i.e. standing on one hind leg with forepaws raised {{as if to}} strike). Beasts also frequently appear walking, passant or, {{in the case of}} stags and the occasional unicorn, trippant, and may appear statant (standing), salient or springing (leaping), sejant (seated), couchant or lodged (lying prone with head raised), or occasionally dormant (sleeping). The principal attitude of birds, namely the eagle, is displayed (i.e. facing the viewer with the head turned toward dexter and wings raised and upturned to show the full underside of both wings). Birds also appear rising or rousant (i.e. wings raised and head upturned as if about to take flight), volant (flying), statant (standing, with wings raised), close (at rest with wings folded), and waterfowl may appear naiant (swimming), while cranes may appear vigilant (standing on one leg). Fish often appear naiant (swimming horizontally) or hauriant (upwards) or urinant (downwards), but may also appear addorsed (two fish hauriant, back to back). Serpents may appear glissant (gliding in a wavy form) or nowed (as a figure-eight knot). Griffins and quadrupedal dragons constantly appear segreant (i.e. rampant with wings addorsed and elevated) and, together with lions, may appear combatant (i.e. two of them turned to face each other in the rampant position).|$|E

It's a load of rubbish". What is more, she later told Spin: [...] "some critics have taken my writing so literally to the point that they'll listen to 'Down by the Water' and believe I have actually given birth to a child and drowned her." ...|$|E
500|$|Films noir tend {{to revolve}} around heroes {{who are more}} flawed and morally {{questionable}} than the norm, often fall guys {{of one sort or}} another. The characteristic protagonists of noir are described by many critics as [...] "alienated"; in the words of Silver and Ward, [...] "filled with existential bitterness". Certain archetypal characters appear in many films noir—hardboiled detectives, femme fatales, corrupt policemen, jealous husbands, intrepid claims adjusters, and down-and-out writers. Among characters of every stripe, cigarette smoking <b>is</b> <b>rampant.</b> From historical commentators to neo-noir pictures to pop culture ephemera, the private eye and the femme fatale have been adopted as the quintessential film noir figures, though they do not appear in most films now regarded as classic noir. Of the twenty-six National Film Registry noirs, in only four does the star play a private eye: The Maltese Falcon, The Big Sleep, Out of the Past, and Kiss Me Deadly. Just four others readily qualify as detective stories: Laura, The Killers, The Naked City, and Touch of Evil.|$|E
500|$|The {{industrial}} {{sector of the}} state continues to be highly underdeveloped– brickfields and tea industry {{are the only two}} organised sectors. Tripura has considerable reservoirs of natural gas. According to estimates by Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), the state has 400billion metres3 reserves of natural gas, with 16billion metres3 is recoverable. ONGC produced 480million metres3 natural gas in the state, in 2006–07. In 2011 and 2013, new large discoveries of natural gas were announced by ONGC. Tourism industry in the state is growing– the revenue earned in tourism sector crossed [...] {{for the first time in}} 2009–10, and surpassed [...] in 2010–11. Although Bangladesh is in a trade deficit with India, its export to Tripura is significantly more than import from the state; a report in the newspaper The Hindu estimated Bangladesh exported commodities valued at about [...] to the state in 2012, as opposed to [...] "very small quantity" [...] of import. Alongside legal international trade, unofficial and informal cross-border trade <b>is</b> <b>rampant.</b> In a research paper published by the Institute of Developing Economies in 2004, the dependence of Tripura's economy on that of Bangladesh was emphasised.|$|E

2500|$|Sex {{tourism is}} {{most common in}} the Northeast of Brazil, {{especially}} {{in the city of}} Fortaleza, where child prostitution <b>is</b> <b>rampant.</b> While no specific laws address sex tourism, it is punishable under other criminal offenses, such as pedophilia and corruption of minors. The government released a [...] "code of conduct to combat sex tourism and sexual exploitation" [...] and conducted campaigns in the most affected areas, which are predominantly in the Northeastern region of the country. The states of Pernambuco, Espirito Santo, Amazonias, Parana and the Federal District enacted laws requiring certain businesses to display signs listing the penalties for having intercourse with a minor.|$|E
