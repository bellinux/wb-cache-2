25|$|There are few {{mentions}} of Slindon in 1745 or 1746 and Newland can {{be found}} playing for All-England or leading his own team, usually in opposition to Colchin's team. In July 1745, he scored {{what was then a}} massive 88 for All-England against Kent at the Artillery Ground. It is not absolutely certain that he did this in one innings and it may have been his match total but, giving <b>him</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> the doubt, it is the highest individual innings recorded during cricket's pioneering period (i.e., to 1763).|$|E
25|$|No {{matter how}} we view it, {{it remains a}} fact that we charged a non-English-speaking alien with {{criminal}} tax evasion on the first tax returns he filed in this country. It appears that we didn't give him a fair chance to understand our laws. We didn't seek a civil penalty as an initial means of redress. We didn't give <b>him</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> any doubt. Rather, we took a novel theory of tax liability of less than $10,000 {{and turned it into}} a guilty verdict and eighteen months in a federal prison.|$|E

He pleaded with the jury to give <b>him</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> the doubt, but after they retired, it took them only 35 minutes to return with a guilty verdict.

5|$|To most a monarch was God's earthly representative, {{chosen by}} <b>Him</b> for <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> His people. For men to meddle in that choice was {{to tamper with}} the divine order, the {{inevitable}} price of which was chaos.|$|R
50|$|The story starts when Scrooge McDuck {{tries to}} know where was his nephew going. Donald says he's going to buy an ice cream soda, much for the dismay of Scrooge, who tries to {{convince}} Donald to invest the money rather than spending it. Scrooge shows Donald the Number One Dime and the nephew notices a string attaching {{it to one of}} Scrooge's pockets. Scrooge says he also saves string and takes Donald to the Money Bin to show <b>him</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> saving money. Donald still prefers a soda, so Scrooge gives up and goes to the park to find a newspaper (he's too stingy to buy one).|$|R

500|$|Carter {{researched}} for {{the book}} during 2010. He had secured a publishing deal {{for the book}} by January of that year. Carter confirmed to Gillian Reagan of Business Insider that in his research, he tried to gather information from multiple viewpoints. He said, [...] "I'm reaching out to everyone I possibly can to get every side of the story." [...] Carter {{said that he was}} remaining neutral about the 2010 Tonight Show conflict. [...] "I obviously have to reach out to all sides", he said. [...] "For the longest time, I personally tried to watch as many episodes of all the shows as I could to get sense of each show, and what each guy does. I don't just pick one and stick with that guy." [...] Carter researched the impact of financial decision-making on the controversy. He said he had known Leno for a long time, and O'Brien since he began working for NBC, and that these connections gave <b>him</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> familiarity.|$|E
2500|$|Early in his reign, William III (1689–1702) {{preferred}} [...] "Mixed Ministries" [...] (or coalitions) {{consisting of}} both Tories and Whigs. William thought this composition would dilute {{the power of}} any one party and also give <b>him</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> differing points of view. However, this approach did not work well because the members could not agree on a leader or on policies, and often worked at odds with each other.|$|E
2500|$|Hostettler {{was one of}} the [...] "true believers" [...] in the Republican {{freshman}} class of 1995. He believed the U.S. Constitution should be strictly interpreted and was very critical of government actions—especially those of judges—that he felt overstepped their constitutional limits. Even those who disagreed with Hostettler felt that they knew where he stood and would likely give <b>him</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> the doubt that he regularly voted in principle and not for political ends.|$|E

"They wouldn't {{take on a}} feller of your size," [...] Master Plummer said, with {{something}} very like a sneer; which was not seemly, {{in view of the}} fact that Dan was at this moment giving <b>him</b> <b>the</b> full <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> his wonderful ability, simply through friendship.|$|R
50|$|While {{living in}} Paris in 1784, Benjamin Franklin wrote a satirical essay, {{in which he}} {{suggested}} that Parisians get up earlier in the morning. Modern DST was first proposed by the New Zealand entomologist George Vernon Hudson in 1895. William Willett, a London building contractor, independently invented DST and pitched it to the British Parliament in 1907. In that same year Willett spoke with John Anderson, who was {{on a business trip}} in Britain, and explained to <b>him</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> adopting DST and its economic benefits. Germany and its allies were the first European countries to adopt DST in 1916, followed quickly by the United Kingdom and many other western European countries, all in an effort to save fuel during World War I.|$|R

2500|$|Metzger filed a {{petition}} with the Supreme Court of Israel to protest Mazuz's public declaration, alleging that his image {{had been destroyed}} without {{a chance to tell}} his side of the story, and accusing Mazuz of engaging in [...] "child-like" [...] tactics. Metzger's lawyer charged that Mazuz's report on Metzger contained unverifiable information, and that it constituted a personal attack on the rabbi without giving <b>him</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> a defense or hearing. The petition requested that the second half of Mazuz's 30-page report, in which he harshly attacked Metzger's conduct and recommended his removal, be stricken from the record.|$|E

[...] When the Spartan squad {{assembled}} for practice on September 10, 1928, Slaughter was not on hand. [...] Coach Harry Kipke gave <b>him</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> the doubt, assuming the Spartans used the same early practice date as the Big Ten, September 15. [...] When Slaughter failed to arrive on that date, Kipke sent him several telegrams but received no response. [...] North Carolina State announced on September 20, 1928 that Slaughter had been retained for another year as its line coach. [...] Slaughter continued serving as line coach for the North Carolina State Wolfpack through the 1930 football season.|$|E

2500|$|In 573, Gontrand {{was caught}} in a civil war with his brother Sigebert I of Austrasia, and in 575 summoned the aid of their brother Chilperic I of Soissons. He {{reversed}} his allegiance later, due to the character of Chilperic, if we may give <b>him</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> the doubt in light of St. Gregory's commendation, and Chilperic retreated. [...] He thereafter remained an ally of Sigebert, his wife, and his sons until his death. When Sigebert was assassinated later in 575, Chilperic invaded the kingdom, but Gontrand sent his general Mummolus, who was always Gontrand's greatest weapon, for he was the greatest general in Gaul at the time, to remove him. Mummolus defeated Chilperic's general Desiderius and the Neustrian's forces retreated from Austrasia.|$|E
2500|$|The Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai met Nasser at the 1955 Bandung Conference and was {{impressed}} by him. Zhou recommended that Khrushchev treat Nasser as a potential ally. Zhou described Nasser to Khrushchev as a young nationalist, who though no Communist, could if used correctly do much damage to Western interests in the Middle East. Marshal Josip Broz Tito of Yugoslavia, who also come to know Nasser at Bandung told Khrushchev in a 1955 meeting that [...] "Nasser {{was a young man}} without much political experience, but if we give <b>him</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> the doubt, {{we might be able to}} exert a beneficial influence on him, both for the sake of the Communist movement, and ... the Egyptian people". Traditionally, most of the equipment in the Egyptian military had come from Britain, but Nasser's desire to break British influence in Egypt meant that he was desperate to find a new source of weapons to replace Britain. Nasser had first broached the subject of buying weapons from the Soviet Union in 1954.|$|E
2500|$|In the November 1932 {{election}} the Nazis lost seats, but Papen {{was still}} unable to get a Reichstag that would not pass a vote of no-confidence {{like the one that}} brought down his first government. Papen then decided to try to negotiate with Hitler, but Hitler's reply contained so many conditions that Papen gave up all hope of reaching agreement. Hitler wanted a presidential government, but Hindenburg stated that he would allow Hitler a parliamentary government. On 24 November 1932, during the course of another Hitler–Hindenburg meeting, Hindenburg stated his fears that [...] "a presidential cabinet led by Hitler would necessarily develop into a party dictatorship with all its consequences for an extreme aggravation of the conflicts within the German people".Soon afterward, under pressure from Schleicher, Papen resigned on 17 November, and formed a caretaker government. In November 1932, Paul Dinichert, the Swiss ambassador to Germany reported: [...] "I left Herr von Papen with the impression of having spoken with a really glib man who cannot be blamed if one gets bored in his presence. Whether this should be the principal trait of the man who today governs Germany is, to be sure, another question." [...] Konrad Adenauer who knew Papen well often said: [...] "I always gave <b>him</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> mitigating circumstances given his enormous limitations." ...|$|E

The Buddha also reminded Lord Sakra should diligently uphold and protect it, never letting it to be forgotten or lost.|$|R
2500|$|Bradman {{volunteered for}} the RAAF in 1940, but {{transferred}} to the Australian Army as a lieutenant in the Army School of Physical Training. Stress and depression aggravated his fibrositis and he was invalided out of the army in 1941, after which he spent months in poor physical condition and lost {{the use of his}} right thumb and forefinger. He resumed stockbroking in 1942 and set up his own firm after his employer was imprisoned for fraud and embezzlement. In 1945 he joined the South Australian Cricket Association and became their representative with the Board of Control and he seriously considered retiring from cricket in order to concentrate on an administrative role. He played a few games in 1945–46, but Richard Whittington thought he was [...] "the ghost of a once great cricketer". The press and public badly wanted to see him play and after a few warm up matches Bradman agreed to captain Australia against the advice of his doctor. In the First Test he played poorly for 28 when he chopped a ball to Jack Ikin in gully. The England players (and Keith Miller from the dressing room) thought he was out, but Bradman was confident that the ball had been jammed into the ground by his bat before it flew up to Ikin and refused to walk. The umpire gave <b>him</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> the doubt, but Wally Hammond told Bradman [...] "That's a fine way to start a Test series." [...] Bradman went on to make a match-winning 187 and it was thought if Bradman had been given out he would have retired from cricket.|$|E
2500|$|Greig was now {{experimenting with}} finger-spin to {{complement}} his medium pace. He {{set off to}} the West Indies with the England team in early 1974 and ran straight into a major controversy. On {{the second day of}} the First Test at the Queen's Park Oval in Trinidad, the West Indies had cruised to a first innings lead of 143, thanks mainly to 142 not out from Alvin Kallicharran. With four wickets still in hand, the home team was in a dominant position when the last ball of the day was bowled to Bernard Julien, who blocked it past Greig (fielding in close on the off side) and then headed off to the pavilion with Kallicharran. However, Greig fielded the ball, whirled around, threw down the stumps, and appealed for a run out decision against Kallicharran. Umpire Douglas Sang Hue gave the batsman out, and a near-riot broke out in the crowd. The spectators stormed the ground and laid siege to the pavilion, calling for the decision to be revoked. Technically, the decision was correct as Sang Hue had not called time on the day's play, but Greig's actions were considered unsporting, and together with the crowd's reaction, the England captain revoked the appeal. Kallicharran was reinstated the following day, when he took his score to 158. The incident was controversial - some believing it a black stain on his character, others prepared to give <b>him</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> the doubt. [...] For his part, Greig claimed that his actions were not premeditated, that his back was to the play and he was unaware that proceedings were over. If his actions had been premeditated, they would have been rather reckless given the risk of stirring up the notoriously volatile Trinidadian crowd. England convincingly lost the Test and Greig failed with bat and ball.|$|E
