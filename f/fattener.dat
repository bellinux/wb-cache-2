Two questionnaires were designed both containing five groups of questions focused on the responder, the farm and AMU (eg, in-feed, in-drinking water and parenteral); both surveys were carried out by means of personal face-to-face interviews. Both surveys started with a sample size of 108 potentially eligible farms per survey; nevertheless, finally 67 finisher farms and 49 FtF farms were recruited. Overall percentages of animals exposed to antimicrobials (AM) were high (90 per cent in finisher farms and 54 per cent FtF farms); colistin (61 per cent and 33 per cent) and doxycycline (62 per cent and 23 per cent) were the most common AMs, followed by amoxicillin (51 per cent and 19 per cent) and lincomycin (49 per cent), respectively. Questionnaire-based surveys using face-to-face interviews are useful for capturing information regarding AMU at the farm level. Farm-level data per administration route can be used for comparative AMU analysis between farms. Nevertheless, for the analysis of the putative relationships between AMU and AM resistance, measures based on exposed animals or exposure events are needed...|$|E

A research project was initiated in 8 EU countries (ProPIG from the ERANET CoreOrganic II) involving 72 farms: 59 with sows (53 farrow-to-finish = FF, 5 with and 1 without weaners), 11 fattening (F) and 2 with weaners and <b>fatteners.</b> Farmers {{were asked to describe}} their feeding practices and the nutrient content of feeds used was recorded, either from the manufacturer claim or calculated from ingredients. Four FF farms used a single diet for all pigs. For sows, 46 % of the farms fed the same diet. For <b>fatteners,</b> 58 % of the farms used a single diet, 38 % used two diets and 5 % used 3 diets. For weaners, 73 % of the farms used a single diet and 27 % used two diets. Nutrient feed contents were 13. 3 ± 1. 0 MJ ME, 141 ± 19 g crude proteins (CP) and 5. 0 ± 1. 2 g total P (tP) /kg for pregnant sows, 12. 8 ± 0. 9 MJ ME, 159 ± 19 g CP and 5. 2 g ± 1. 2 tP/kg for lactating sows, 12. 8 ± 1. 0, 175 ± 23 g CP, 5. 3 g tP/kg for weaners, 12. 7 ± 0. 1 MJ ME, 165 ± 23 g CP and 4. 7 ± 1. 1 g tP/kg for <b>fatteners</b> (means ± sd).

40|$|Objective of this {{research}} was to present and compare results of the research of the effect of two fattening methods, on deep litter and conventional method (without litter). Slaughter properties have been determined with special focus on distribution of certain tissues in pig carcasses fattened in two different ways. Research was carried out on meat, fattening pig breeds - Swedish landrace. Research included 115 <b>fatteners</b> from single farm in Vojvodina. Depending on the housing conditions, two groups were formed: first group - group I (60 heads in group) was housed on deep litter, and the second - group II (55 heads in group), without litter. At the end of the trial, pigs were slaughtered and dissection was performed on cooled (+ 4 ºC) left carcass sides and meat yield determined using the method of partial dissection (Walstra and Merkus, 1996). Carcass sides were cut in 12 parts. Based on the meat quantity in four main carcass parts: leg, shoulder, back-loin part (BLP) and belly-rib part (BRP), which contain 75 % of total musculature mass and mass of tenderloin of carcass side, meat percentage in carcass sides was calculated according to formulation (Manojlović Danica et al., 1999). <b>Fatteners</b> housed on deep litter had statistically significantly (**p< 0. 01) lower mass of cool carcass sides (38. 38 kg) compared to <b>fatteners</b> housed without litter (40. 90 kg). Higher absolute and relative shares of leg (10. 22 kg and 25. 02 %) were established and higher absolute yield of shoulder (5. 35 kg) in <b>fatteners</b> housed in boxes without litter (II group). Yield of muscle tissue in leg, shoulder, BLP and BRP was higher in <b>fatteners</b> of the II group (without litter) compared to pigs fattened on deep litter, and also statistically highly significant differences were established in share of muscle tissue in shoulder (**p< 0. 01) and considerable differences in regard to share of muscle tissue in BRP (*p< 0. 05).

40|$|Introduction Studies in {{different}} European countries {{have revealed that}} infections with endoparasites {{are one of the}} most important health problems in swine herds (Roepstorff et al., 1999; Eijck & Borgsteede, 2005). In organic pig farming, the Regulation (EC) No 889 / 2008 includes several specifications which are expected to have severe impacts on parasite infection, i. e. straw bedding, access to outdoor run, addition of roughage to the daily feed ration and no prophylactic anthelmintic medication. Organic pig farms are also characterised by heterogeneous management practices and a lack in control measures (Ebke & Sundrum, 2004; Werner et al., 2009) providing a non-assessable risk for helminth egg contamination in the environment. The aim of the study was to assess the prevalence of endoparasite infections in fattening pigs on organic swine herds and the effectiveness of management measures with respect to the reduction of endoparasite infections. Materials and Methods The study was performed in 17 organic farrow-to-finish herds in Germany. An interview with the farmer was performed using a standardised questionnaire, containing closed and open-ended questions on anthelmintic treatment, cleaning and disinfectant measures, documentation of production and management data and diagnostic measures on farm-level. Furthermore, 10 faecal samples per farm, taken twice during spring and autumn, were collected from <b>fatteners.</b> They were examined within 12 - 24 h after collection for nematode egg counts per gram of faeces (EPG) using the 'Concentration McMaster technique' with saturated sodium chloride solution (detection limit: 20 EPG; Roepstorff & Nansen, 1999).

The quantity and content of meat were determined based on dissection of left carcass sides (Walstra and Merkus, 1996). Also, nutritive properties of musculus longissimus dorsi (m. l. d.) were established. Obtained data were processed using GLM procedure of the program package SAS 9. 1. 3 (SAS Inst. Inc., 2002 - 2003). Results of the study show that Moravka <b>fatteners</b> had longer carcass sides (+ 6. 82 and + 5. 00 cm) compared to Mangalitsa breed, corrected to average body weight at slaughtering. <b>Fatteners</b> of M breed had in average higher total mass of back-loin part (+ 0. 685, P< 0. 05) and average quantity of muscles in the same part of carcass side (+ 0. 631 kg, P< 0. 01), compared to <b>fatteners</b> of LM breed. Also, they had higher quantity of muscle in belly-rib part (+ 0. 237 kg, P< 0. 05) compared to LM. Share of muscle tissue in back-loin and belly-rib carcass side parts corrected for WCC, was higher in M carcass sides than in LM (P< 0. 01). Conversely, muscle tissue content in shoulders of Mangalitsa was higher (+ 4. 8 %; P< 0. 05) than in Moravka.

This study was carried out to verify the electrical parameters of pig stunning under commercial conditions. Altogether 145 <b>fattener</b> pigs (body weight range: 30 – 150 kg, median 109 kg) were tested at four different private slaughterhouses in Hungary where head-only electrical stunners were used with different constant voltage settings.

In the second period, 879 pigs were examined and rectal stricture accounted for 10. 3 % and rectal prolapse for 7. 7 % with an average age of 164. 2 ± 6. 1 y 115. 8 ± 4. 2 days, respectively. Affected pigs showed abdominal distension and poor growth. Gross findings were distended rectum, spiral colon and cecum usually with fibrinous peritonitis and pericarditis. The rectal stricture was found about 2. 5 to 5 cm in craneal to the anus with 3 to 8 cm in lengh. Bacteriological studies carried out from selected samples were negative for a common swine gut pathogens. One hundred twenty two samples for aflatoxins and zearalenone and 36 for deoxynivalenol investigation of commodities by a competition ELISA test were performed. There was not a direct correlation between high incidence of rectal stricture and levels of zearalenone, even though on field situation, little is known about what happens when this mycotoxin is fed in low levels along the year, alone or in association with deoxynivalenol. It was concluded that rectal stricture is a condition that affects pig production.

The epidemiology of porcine group A rotavirus was studied in commercial herds of pigs in New Zealand. A commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (Dakopatts, Copenhagen) was found to be highly sensitive (100 %) and specific (96. 8 %) for the detection of group A rotavirus in pig faeces when compared to electron microscopy (EM). A highly sensitive and specific ELISA test for the measurement of antibody against group A rotavirus in pigs was also developed. Of 521 faecal samples collected from Massey University Piggery in a cross-sectional survey, 47 (9 %) were positive for group A rotavirus by the ELISA test. Only sucking (19. 3 %) and weaner (14. 4 %) pigs were shedding rotavirus. Rotavirus was not detected in the faeces of <b>fattener</b> pigs (over two months old) or adult pigs including sows and boars. Three cohort studies revealed that all pigs became infected with group A rotavirus before they were 40 days of age and shed the virus for an average of eight days. Some of the piglets shed rotavirus a second time approximately 10 days after the first period of shedding. All piglets ceased to shed the virus by two months of age. Rotaviral shedding was associated with the occurrence of milk scours in sucking piglets. Diarrhoea in weaner pigs (post-weaning diarrhoea, PWD) was more closely associated with the presence of haemolytic E. coli than with rotavirus in faeces. Infection with group A rotavirus was transmitted from piglet to piglet and from litter to litter. In one cohort of 50 piglets from five litters, shedding of rotavirus was first detected in one litter, then in the second litter two days later, and finally in other litters of piglets. Over a period of 16 days, all piglets in the five litters were infected. Group A rotavirus was also detected in dust, faeces and effluent collected from the farrowing and weaner houses, and from a weaner house which had not been used for three months. Rotavirus was not detected in any of the sows (11) during the period of investigation. Neither was rotavirus detected in <b>fattener</b> pigs (from two months of age to the time of slaughter), nor in the environments where old pigs (<b>fattener</b> and sow houses) were housed. It was not therefore possible to confirm that adult pigs, especially sows, act as carriers for rotaviral infection of young piglets as has been suggested by other workers. All the piglets acquired maternal antirotaviral antibody from their dams and the levels of antibody in piglets' sera were comparable to those in the colostrum of their dams. The maternally-derived antibody was also detected in piglets' faeces. Antibody in sera and in faeces declined rapidly after birth. Rotaviral shedding commenced in each of the cohorts when the geometric mean ELISA antibody titre fell below 1 / 1600 (equivalent to serum neutralizing antibody titre of 1 / 8 to 1 / 16). However, this correlation between antibody titres and protection was not observed in individual litters. In each of the cohorts studied, rotaviral shedding was usually detected initially in one or two piglets of a litter. The infection then spread to other piglets within the same litter and, finally, to piglets of other litters in the same group. Onset of rotaviral infection in particular litters was related to their location in the farrowing unit rather than to the levels of antibody. The shedding pattern of group A rotavirus was studied further in another five New Zealand piggeries and was found to be similar to that observed at the Massey University Piggery. Faecal samples from these piggeries were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and no common electrophoretype of group A rotavirus was found in these piggeries. More than one electrophoretype of group A rotavirus was detected in three of these piggeries. Faecal samples collected from Massey University Piggery were also analyzed by PAGE and it was found that rotaviruses detected during {{the first two years of}} the present investigation had identical electrophoretypes, but one isolate detected in the third year had a distinctively different pattern. Non-group A rotaviruses were also detected for the first time in New Zealand. Nine samples had an electrophoretic pattern similar to that of group C rotavirus and one was similar to that of group B rotavirus. One of the samples containing group C rotavirus was from two litters of piglets with diarrhoea at two to four days of age. In one of these piggeries, five electrophoretypes of rotaviruses representing three groups were detected. These observations indicate that rotaviral infections are important causes of milk scours in piglets, and are probably significant in exacerbating PWD. The epidemiology of rotaviral infections is complicated by a number of factors. These include the continuous transmission of virus from pig to pig and from litter to litter, the survival of the virus in the piggery environment, the incomplete protection afforded by maternally-derived antibody, and the simultaneous circulation of different strains and different groups of rotavirus in one piggery...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Identification and {{monitoring}} of farm animals are effective tools for traceability. Current livestock identification {{systems are not}} 100 % efficient and present certain disadvantages such as losses, breakages and an unreadable identification code. The use of injectable transponders may be a reliable method for individual identification, providing an improvement in data recording and farm management. The aim of this experiment was to evaluate the practical aspects concerning injection technique, readability and retrieval of injectable transponders in live rabbits. A total of 60 rabbits (40 <b>fatteners</b> and 20 does) were injected with 23 x 3 mm passive FDX-B transponders (Datamars, Switzerland), inserted into a needle, wrapped in a sterilised package and applied by a specific injector (Planet ID, Germany). Two different body sites were evaluated: back scapular (n= 30) and armpit (n= 30) position. The readings of the transponders were performed by using an i-max plus portable reader (Datamars, Switzerland) at different times: before and after injection, one day, one week and one month after injection. Does were read monthly during 1 year, while <b>fatteners</b> before the slaughtering process. To evaluate the effect on productive performance, fattening rabbits were compared to a control group. The readability of transponders injected in <b>fatteners</b> until slaughter and in does until 1 year after injection was 100 %.

40|$|China's pig {{production}} has increased manifold {{in the past}} 50 years, and this has greatly affected the nitrogen and phosphorus use and losses in the {{pig production}} sector. However, the magnitude of these changes are not well-known. Here, we provide an in-depth account {{of the changes in}} pig production-N and P use and total N and P losses in the whole pig production chain during the period 1960 - 2010 -through simulation modeling and using data from national statistics and farm surveys. For the period of 2010 - 2030, we explored possible effects of technological and managerial measures aimed at improving the performances of pig production via scenario analysis. We used and further developed the NUtrient flows in Food Chains, Environment and Resources use (NUFER) model to calculate the feed requirement and consumption, and N and P losses in different pig production systems for all the years Between 1960 and 2010, pig production has largely shifted from the so-called backyard system to landless systems. The N use efficiencies at <b>fattener</b> level increased from 18 to 28 %, due to the increased animal productivity. However, the N use efficiencies at the Whole system level decreased from 46 to 11 % during this period, mainly due to the increase of landless pig farms, which rely on imported feed and have no land-base for manure disposal. The total N and P losses were 5289 and 829 Gg in 2010, which is 30 and 95 times higher than in 1960. In the business as usual scenario, the total N and P losses were projected to increase by 25 and 55 % between 2010 and 2030, respectively. Analyses of other scenarios indicate that packages of technological and managerial measures can decrease total N and P losses by 64 and 95 % respectively. Such improvements require major transition in the pig production sector, notably, in manure management, herd management, and feeding practices...|$|E
40|$|Title of the paper: Systematic {{crossbreeding}} {{as a tool}} {{to conserve}} endangered pig breeds Live conservation of purebred populations of old endangered pig breeds requires high financial subsidies because they are very inferior to actual commercial hybrids in overall economy. But subsidies may be considerably reduced if the endangered breeds can be integrated into regional crossbreeding schemes adapted to ecological production niches or designed for specific quality products. The aim of this study at the experimental station Relliehausen of Göttingen University was to compare the performance of two crossbred sows with the endangered breeds Saddleback (DS) and Bentheimer (BB) as dams sire (and LW/LR as dams dam) with commercial LW/LR-crossbred sows in their litter performance as well as meat production and quality traits of their progeny from the same PI(NN) - and (PI*HA) -terminal sires. 478 litters with 1, 384 fattened and 1, 037 carcass graded progeny of which about 600 underwent detailed carcass value and meat quality evaluations at a loin cross section and 48 with an additional sensoric test. Results show that in litter performance DS crossbred sows were comparable to LW/LR commercial sows but BB crossbred sows weaned 0. 66 pigs less per litter. In FOM grading {{no significant differences were found}} between the three sow groups as well as between the two different terminal sires. This also applied for most meat quality traits but in intramuscular fat content unexpectedly the control pigs were the best and significantly superior to the BB-progeny. The typical highly significant quality differences due to the "Hampshire effect" were found between progeny of the (PI*HA) -boar as compared to PI-progeny. In a calculated overall economic value DS-progeny were 4 – 5 DM and BB-progeny about 8 DM per pig inferior to the commercial controls. These differences are only 1 / 5 to 1 / 10 of the purebred inferiority of the endangered breeds. These results should be confirmed by a field trial under more extensive conditions (e. g. outdoor sow- and ecological <b>fattener</b> management) ...|$|E

50|$|Presumably, A. suum {{infections are}} present in pig farms all over the world. However, few {{countries}} have up-to-date information on its prevalence. In a Swedish study {{it appeared that the}} pens of sows and <b>fatteners</b> are the heaviest infected environments. This was shown by the presence of eggs in old faecal deposits collected from the pens. These findings were supported by studies from China and Denmark where the highest prevalence of A. suum was also found in breeding sows and <b>fatteners.</b> The prevalence in breeding boars is usually lower than in sows or <b>fatteners.</b> Nevertheless, infected boars could also be an important source of transmission of parasite eggs on the farm since they are often located in more traditional pens than the sows (e.g. with solid floor and/or bedding). Moreover, boars are regularly used for contact stimulation of the sows, which allows them to spread the infection by defecating in areas other than their own pen.Strong evidence exists that under indoor conditions, massive infection of piglets with A. suum usually occurs shortly after arrival in the highly infectious fattening units and not in the farrowing pens. Several studies have shown that A. suum egg excretion was nearly absent in weaners despite the, sometimes substantial, presence of eggs in the farrowing pens of intensive herds. Here, the increased hygienic standards in combination with the low humidity in the farrowing pens may significantly reduce the presence of favourable microenvironments for egg survival. On the other hand, in piglets raised under outdoor conditions, significant transmission is thought to occur soon after birth and pigs are infected before fattening.|$|R
40|$|Study was {{conducted}} to assess beef cattle production, management practices and marketing system in Lume district, East Shoa Zone, Oromia. Traditional, semi-intensive and intensive beef cattle production and marketing system were considered for the study. For this purpose 120 respondents were included based on discussions with district livestock experts, 1 kebele for intensive; 2 kebeles from semi-intensive fattening systems were purposively selected as {{they are the only}} kebeles practicing intensive and semi-intensive fattening in the district. From the traditional system, three kebeles were randomly selected. Structured and semi-structured questioners were used to collect data from sampled households. In addition the performance of beef animals and chemical composition of major feedstuff were evaluated on eleven purposively selected feedlots and households (2 intensive feed lots, 3 semi-intensive and 6 from traditional). Major feed resources used from the 11 households involved in body weight monitoring were collected and chemical composition determined. From the interviewed households, 100 %, 85 %, 75 %, 63 %, and 55 % of them use crop residues, aftermath grazing, grazing from communal, roadside and riverside areas, respectively. The majority of the respondents (82. 5 %) provided additional supplement for their cattle during dry season. Traditional <b>fatteners</b> commonly used noug cake (72. 2 %) and local brewery by-product (70 %) as the main sources of feed. During wet season the major feed resources was grazing (76. 3 %) while during the dry seasons, tethering (49. 1 %, free grazing (41. 6 %) and cut and carry system (1. 6 %) were the main feed resources. The majority (82. 5 %) of the farmers supplement cattle during dry season which was provided once a day (44. 2 %), twice a day (21. 7 %) and whenever available (34. 2 %). Traditional <b>fatteners</b> mainly use their own animal for fattening from their herds. The semi-intensive and intensive <b>fatteners</b> purchase fattening animals from another source. The most preferred animal for fattening was old oxen (56. 7 %) in the traditional fattening system while young bull (20. 8 %) was used in semi- commercial and intensive <b>fatteners.</b> Cattle were fattened once, twice and trice a year under traditional, semi-intensive, intensive production systems, respectively. In all production systems, decision of ending fattening period was made based on live weight change. The average length of fattening period was 3 - 4, 3, 3 months for traditional, semi-intensive and intensive system, respectively. At the market places, the main buyers of beef cattle were local traders (74. 2 %) in traditional and semi-intensive systems. According to the respondents, reasons for prices variation were involvement of number of traders (75. 8 %), road and transportation accessibility (15 %) and proximity to urban (9. 2 %) places. The determinants of price of animals (purchased/sold) were breed (29. 2 %), weight (28. 3 %), and color (26. 7 %) and age (15 %). The majority of the producers (95. 4 %) in traditional fattening system and semixviii intensive <b>fatteners</b> (100 %) sold their fattened cattle in eye ball estimation at market place, while <b>fatteners</b> in intensive system used live weight to sell their cattle. The majority of the respondents (55 %) relay on the information they get from brokers. More than three-fourth of the <b>fatteners</b> in all production systems sell their fattened beef (100 %) during holidays. The crude protein content of the feedstuff ranged from 3. 79 to 29 %. The average daily gain increased (P< 0. 01) with increasing levels of intensification which was 0. 4 kg, 0. 53 kg, 0. 91 kg for traditional, semi-intensive and 0. 91 kg, respectively. The weight gain for intensive fattening was significantly higher than the other two systems. Major constraints that hindered the performance of cattle fattening activity were feed and water shortages, marketing and disease problems. In conclusion, in order to improve the performance of beef cattle, especially under traditional production system, {{there is a need to}} supply adequate feed in terms of quality and quantity which could promote the frequency of fattening. Appropriate marketing system should be developed so that farmers can benefit from their business. ====Global Affairs Canad...|$|R
40|$|Background: Organic pig {{production}} is expanding and amongst {{the objectives of}} organic farming are enhancing animal health and welfare. However, some studies have reported a higher prevalence of lameness and joint condemnation at slaughter in free-range/organic pigs than in conventionally raised pigs. Organic slaughter pigs have free-range housing in which indoor and outdoor access is compulsory, while in conventional farming the pigs are commonly confined to indoor pens. The present study evaluated the effects of free-range and confined housing on lameness prevalence in a herd of 106 finisher pigs, and whether osteochondrosis and Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae associated arthritis influences these effects. We also evaluated the association between clinical lameness during the rearing period and joint condemnations at slaughter. Results: Seventy free-range and 36 confined housed <b>fattener</b> pigs were scored for their gait twice during the rearing period and 848 joints were evaluated post mortem. Osteochondrosis was more frequent among free-range than confined pigs (P < 0. 05), and when present it was also more severe (P < 0. 001). Pigs with more numerous and more severe osteochondral lesions had their gait affected more than did pigs with fewer such lesions (P < 0. 05). Hence it was a paradox {{that we did not}} detect more lameness among the free-range pigs than the confined pigs. E. rhusiopathiae associated arthritis was not diagnosed. The association between gait remarks/clinical lameness and joint condemnations at slaughter was not significant. Conclusions: The results indicate that free-range housing may have both positive and negative effects on locomotory traits. Free-range pigs may be less clinically affected by osteochondrosis than are confined pigs. One explanation for this effect may be strengthening of joint supportive tissue and pain relief promoted by exercise. Visual gait scoring missed serious joint lesions that probably were harmful to the pigs, and should therefore not be used as a sole indicator of joint/leg health in welfare inspection of pigs. The association between gait scores and joint condemnation appeared to be poor. This study was limited to one herd, and so more and larger studies on the effects of free-range housing on lameness severity and osteochondrosis development in pigs are recommended...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine the ratio of ham and loin in half-carcasses and the tissue composition of these cuts. The research material consisted of 140 pig carcasses. The experimental materials were derived from the Polish commercial population of <b>fattener</b> pigs. Genetic material representing the most commonly slaughtered fatteners in Poland. Fatteners for the study came from several suppliers. All fatteners were kept in similar farms complying with principles of animal welfare. The right half-carcasses were divided into different groups, regardless of sex, half-carcass mass, back fat thickness and lean meat content class. Ham and loin obtained from carcasses were subjected to a detailed dissection, and the percentage of ham and loin in the carcass and the overall percentage of of the cuts in relation to the entire half-carcass were calculated. Gilts were characterized by a higher content of ham in half-carcasses than barrows (P [*] ≤ 0. 01). The increase in back fat thickness reduced the content of ham in half-carcasses and increased the content of loin (P ≤ 0. 01). A similar trend was shown for the lean meat content class parameter. Additionally, interaction (P [*]≤ 0. 01) between back fat thickness and meat content with respect to the percentage content of loin in carcasses was noted. Gilts were characterised by about a 1. 38  % higher proportion of muscles in the ham (P [*] ≤ 0. 05) and a 0. 47  % lower proportion of intermuscular fat (P [*] ≤ 0. 01). An average increase of five point in back fat thickness increases the amount of subcutaneous fat with skin (P [*] ≤ 0. 01) and intermuscular fat (P [*] ≤ 0. 01) and reduces muscle (P [*] ≤ 0. 01) and bone (P [*]≤ 0. 05 and P [*] ≤ 0. 01) levels. The interaction of percentage content of muscles in ham was observed (P [*]=[*] 0. 04). The meat content class of carcasses did not only affect the level of bones in ham. It was confirmed that sex affected all the analysed dissection elements of the loin. Back fat thickness and meat content classes were present in almost identical amounts in loin tissues (P [*] ≤ 0. 05 and P [*] ≤ 0. 01). Half-carcass mass showed a strong negative correlation with bone content in ham and loin (r [*]=[*]− 0. 35 and r [*]=[*]− 0. 21, respectively). Back fat thickness and meat content strongly and inversely correlated with the content of ham and loin in half-carcasses (r [*]=[*]− 0. 41 and r [*]=[*] 0. 59 for back fat thickness; r [*]=[*] 0. 66 and r [*]=[*]− 0. 57 for lean meat content).

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} different experimental gnawing blocks as cage enrichment in rabbits. One hundred and five pregnant rabbit does housed in conventional wire cages were distributed according to their parity number in 4 homogenous treatment groups. Throughout one complete reproductive cycle (from day 18 of pregnancy till weaning of the litter), does either received no enrichment (controls) or a gnawing block hung from a wire on the cage wall. The 3 different blocks had the same basal components (wheat, molasses and oligoelements), but additionally wood mash (WM), wood mash+chicory pulp (ChP) or wood mash and inulin syrup (I) were respectively incorporated. After weaning, each litter continued to receive the same blocks as before and block consumption was measured as well as the performance of the fatteners. Weight development during the lactation was comparable except in does that received the wood powder blocks. These females had a significantly lower weight (P< 0. 05) at different time points compared to controls. Litter weight or kit weight was not significantly different at any of the time points measured, but again the treatment with wood powder blocks presented the lowest weight. The consumption of blocks during the whole reproduction cycle (42 d) was 11. 0 ± 1. 1; 6. 8 ± 1. 0 and 4. 4 ± 0. 7 g/d per cage for wood mash, chicory pulp or inulin enriched blocks, respectively. A very high variability in consumption of blocks was observed between females. This varied between 1 and 5 (I or ChP group) or even 1 and 9 blocks (WM group) per reproductive cycle. In fatteners, daily block consumption was significantly different (P< 0. 05) and reached on average 7. 0 ± 0. 5; 3. 9 ± 0. 5 and 2. 2 ± 0. 2 g/d per <b>fattener,</b> respectively for WM, ChP and I. Five females with a block and 5 females without a block were observed for 1 h 3 d before the expected parturition and at 2 time points during lactation. Distinction was made between 15 different behaviours. Although the presence of a block did not significantly increase the total number of behavioural transitions, locomotion and intake behaviour were significantly (P< 0. 05) increased when a gnawing block was available. The observation period influenced the frequency of many behavioural transitions and before parturition was significantly higher than post parturition, respectively 56. 1 ± 11. 1 vs. 13. 7 ± 3. 8 (Week 1, P< 0. 01) and 25. 1 ± 5. 5 (Week 2, P< 0. 01). However, a very large variability was observed between does and, moreover, some does were mostly inactive after parturition during the observation period. Based on the consumption pattern and behaviour, these gnawing blocks could be considered as cage enrichment and those with the chicory pulp best fulfilled the objective of a suitable gnawing material...|$|E

The study covered 126 gilts of Polish Landrace, examined in Pig Performance Testing Station in Chorzelów and slaughtered at the body weight of 100 kg. During slaughter the weight of blood from the wound and the weight of blood collected at each minute of exsanguination was measured. The tests of exsanguina-tion were performed on the samples of the neck muscle (musculi colli), the diaphragm muscle (diaphragma musculus) and the internal oblique abdomen muscle (musculus internus abdominis obliguus). To assess the influence of fat content on exsanguination the animals were divided into two groups depending on the average backfat thick-ness from five measurements: Group I – below 1. 40 cm, Group 2 – above 1. 40 cm. It was shown that <b>fatteners</b> with a smaller backfat thickness showed a more favourable course of exsanguination and a higher weight and percentage of slaughter blood and blood output in the first minute of exsanguination.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to compare the {{intestinal}} parasite fauna occurring in pigs kept in different rearing conditions (group A – extremely extensive, B – extensive and C – intensive). In the period between March and July 2010, 345 samples of faeces from piglets (125), weaners (60), <b>fatteners</b> (94) and sows (66) were collected and tested, using standard coproscopic methods. Six parasitic species, belonging to phylum Nematoda (Strongyloides ransomi, Ascaris suum, Oesophagostomum dentatum, Trichuris suum) and to phylum Apicomplexa (Isospora suis and Eimeria debliecki) were diagnosed. Eggs of Toxascaris leonina, a parasitic roundworm mostly affecting the members of the Canidae and Felidae families, not encountered in pigs until now, were found in the faeces of <b>fatteners.</b> The highest level of parasite invasion was recorded in pigs from group A and B; they were multi-species invasions.
