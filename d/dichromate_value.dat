40|$|In the {{theoretical}} part of diploma thesis is elaboreted literary search relating to problems with using of various modifications of coagulation tests. The experimental part of diploma thesis {{is focused on}} comparison of three types of coagulation tests during treatment of model water with increased content of humic matter. Concretly was compared classic jar test, modified jar test and centrifugation test. As a coagulant was used ferric sulphate. The efficiency of treatment was tested under various conditions (temperature, time of fast mixing and intensity of slow mixing). Information capability of results was evalueted {{on the basis of}} absorbance by 254 nm and 387 nm, residual concentration of iron and <b>dichromate</b> <b>value.</b> Obtained results were numerically processed and they are presented in the form of tables and graphs...|$|E

At 24 h, the extract produced an EC 50 of 361. 0 &# 177; 41. 8 &# 956;g/ml, indicating {{that it was}} substantially more toxic than the pesticide Mevinphos (1346. 2 &# 177; 80. 1 &# 901;g/ml) and approximately 4 fold less toxic than potassium dichromate (87. 1 &# 177; 5. 2 &# 956;g/ml). Whilst potassium <b>dichromate</b> LC 50 <b>values</b> remained constant across the 72 -h test period, these values decreased for the extract and Mevinphos to similar values (199. 8 &# 177; 60. 5 and 114 &# 177; 12. 8 &# 956;g/ml, respectively), indicating their similar level of efficacy. Noteworthy was the apparent anesthetic effect of X. johnsonii leaf extract. Although the extract initially appeared to kill the A. franciscana nauplii, they were seen to temporarily recover by 48 h only to die by 72 h...|$|R
