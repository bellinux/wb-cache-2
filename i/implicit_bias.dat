40|$|The {{majority}} of research examining <b>implicit</b> racial <b>bias</b> {{has focused on}} the biases held by White participants (Jost, Banaji, & Nosek, 2004). By contrast, the <b>implicit</b> racial <b>bias</b> of minority group members has been largely overlooked, despite the potential for these associations to provide new insight into the nature of implicit social cognition. In the current research, I extended previous findings by examining predictors of <b>implicit</b> racial <b>bias</b> for Black participants. Specifically, across three studies conducted in two cultural contexts, I examined whether <b>implicit</b> racial <b>bias</b> was related to Black participants racial ideologies, defined as an individuals philosophy about how racial group members should live and interact with other groups in the larger society (Sellers, et al., 1997, pp. 806). Consistent with my expectations, <b>implicit</b> racial <b>bias,</b> as measured by the Implicit Association Test (IAT; Greenwald et al., 1998; 2003; Studies 1 & 2) and the Affective Misattribution Procedure (AMP; Payne et al., 2005; Study 3) was significantly correlated with racial ideologies. However, the specific relationship depended on the cultural context as well as the implicit measure. In Study 1, within the predominantly White Canadian context, Nationalist ideology was negatively correlated with <b>implicit</b> pro-White <b>bias.</b> By contrast, in Study 2, within the predominantly Black Jamaican context, Humanist ideology positively predicted pro-White bias (Study 2). In Study 3, again conducted in the predominantly White Canadian context but with a different measure of <b>implicit</b> racial <b>bias</b> (AMP), Nationalist ideology negatively predicted <b>implicit</b> pro-White <b>bias,</b> while both Assimilation and Humanist ideologies were positive predictors of <b>implicit</b> pro-White <b>bias.</b> In Study 3, explicit racial attitudes, system justification and individual versus collective success orientation were also significantly correlated with <b>implicit</b> racial <b>bias</b> as measured by the Affective Misattribution Procedure (AMP; Payne et al., 2005). As expected, however, ideologies accounted for unique variance in <b>implicit</b> racial <b>bias.</b> The implications of these findings for understanding <b>implicit</b> racial <b>bias</b> in Blacks, in predominantly White and Black contexts, are discussed...|$|R
5000|$|Currently, most of {{the criticisms}} of the IAT center around the {{accuracy}} of its communicated purpose, as some have interpreted the IAT {{to act as a}} kind of lie detector to get at attitudes that are [...] "more true". However, the creators of the IAT assert that participants' implicit attitudes may differ from self-report for a number of reasons, such as they are unaware of these <b>implicit</b> <b>biases,</b> are aware of the <b>implicit</b> <b>biases</b> but reject them as incongruent with their beliefs, or are aware of the <b>implicit</b> <b>biases</b> and simply attempt to hide them, and only in the third case does the IAT fit the description of detecting hidden beliefs. In conclusion the authors state that the difference between the IAT and self-report measures of attitudes is that self-report measures require introspection, while the IAT does not: they simply measure different things and one is not more associated with truth than the other.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the current}} {{study was to examine the}} {{relationship}} between levels of <b>implicit</b> weight <b>bias</b> and levels of body satisfaction. Additionally, this study aimed to investigate whether there are gender differences in levels of body satisfaction, and whether there are gender differences in levels of <b>implicit</b> weight <b>bias.</b> There were 35 participants in this study (15 males and 20 females). The Participants were aged between 18 and 29. Each participant was examined on an individual basis throughout the course of one month. Participants were asked to complete an Implicit Associations Test (Weight IAT-bodies) to measure levels of <b>implicit</b> weight <b>bias</b> and the Body Image Satisfaction Scale (BISS) to measure levels of body satisfaction. Hypothesis 1 stated that lower levels of body satisfaction were related to higher levels of <b>implicit</b> weight <b>bias</b> against overweight individuals. Hypothesis 1 was not supported as results showed that there was an extremely weak, negative relationship. Hypothesis 2 stated that females score lower on levels of body satisfaction than males. Hypothesis 2 was supported as data from the study showed that females scored lower than males on levels of body satisfaction. Hypothesis 3 stated that females score higher on levels of <b>implicit</b> weight <b>bias</b> than males. There was no significant difference found between males and females in levels of <b>implicit</b> weight <b>bias.</b> However, as hypothesized, females scored higher than males on levels of <b>implicit</b> weight <b>bias.</b> It is recommended that future research obtains a larger sample in order to possibly find a significant difference between males and females. These findings also suggest that the relationship between high levels of <b>implicit</b> weight <b>bias</b> and low levels of body satisfaction may only exist among obese individuals. Findings from the current study have implications for knowledge of gender differences in levels of body satisfaction. Additionally, findings from the current study contribute towards research into levels of <b>implicit</b> weight <b>bias</b> among 18 - 29 year olds and how it can affect levels of body satisfaction.

40|$|Abstract: The {{main claim}} {{we aim to}} defend in this paper is that people can be {{responsible}} for actions that are influenced by <b>implicit</b> <b>biases</b> {{they do not know}} they have, and that they would disavow if they were made aware of. Our defense of that claim will involve framing the issue in terms of kinds of control-based and knowledge-based exculpating conditions commonly taken to excuse actions, laying out the core features of <b>implicit</b> <b>biases,</b> and considering whether anything about the character or operation of <b>implicit</b> <b>biases</b> themselves satisfies those conditions, or guarantees that actions influenced by them should be excused. We formulate and reject several arguments that suggest a positive answer. We then present a thought experiment designed to support our central claim, and pump the intuition that not all of the knowledge relevant to moral responsibility and exculpation need be "in the head" of the agent whose actions are being evaluated. Finally, we comment on some general features of our approach and the questions that it raises.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{investigate}} whether the amygdala {{plays a significant role}} in <b>implicit</b> racial <b>bias</b> and to explore the possible explanations that may underlie race-related amygdala neural activity specifically in White and Black Americans.

Most of these studies have shown that amygdala plays a crucial role in <b>implicit</b> racial <b>bias</b> since greater amygdala activation was positively correlated with greater <b>implicit</b> racial <b>bias.</b> Hence, subjects that showed greater amygdala activation measured by fMRI also showed greater pro-White or anti-Black bias measured by the implicit association test.

40|$|Are <b>implicit</b> <b>biases</b> {{something}} we can rightly be held responsible for, and if so, how? A variety of social and cognitive psychological studies have documented the existence of wide-ranging <b>implicit</b> <b>biases</b> for over 30 years. These <b>implicit</b> <b>biases</b> {{can best be described}} as negative mental attitudes that operate immediately and unconsciously in response to specific stimuli. The first chapter of this thesis surveys the psychological literature, as well as presents findings of real-world experiments into racial biases. I then present the dominant model of implicit attitudes as mere associations, followed by evidence that at least some implicit attitudes take on a propositional form and involve making inferences based on evidence. I then reject adopting either of these two rigid models in favor of a dispositional approach that treats <b>implicit</b> <b>biases</b> as on the same spectrum of, but adjacent to, beliefs. I then evaluate the moral wrongdoing associated with holding explicitly prejudicial beliefs, appealing first to Kantian notions of respecting individuals as agents, then appealing to Strawson’s argument that we are responsible for expressions of our will. Our status as human agents involves participating in complex and sustained interactions with others, which necessarily implies that we take part in the social practice of holding each other responsible for the quality of their will. The reactive attitudes we display in our everyday interactions indicate which features and circumstances are most important when investigating this practice. After applying this approach to implicit attitudes, I then pose the objection that their unconscious and unendorsed nature disqualifies implicit attitudes as proper expressions of our will. I develop this objection using Scanlon’s account of moral responsibility, which requires the capacity to self-govern in light of principles that are generally agreed upon as good reasons for guiding interactions with one another. Finally, I critique Real Self theories that seek to arbitrarily privilege one part of ourselves in favor of the Whole Self, which privileges those features that are most integrated into our overall character...|$|R
