500|$|Reviewer Margaret Busby, who {{saw this}} book [...] "not so much an ending as a beginning", called Song [...] "the {{culmination}} of a unique autobiographical achievement, a glorious celebration of indomitable spirit". [...] Like other reviewers, Busby considered Song a series of [...] "beautifully crafted vignettes" [...] and found the book concise and readable. [...] Scholar John McWhorter <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> Angelou's use of vignettes as positively, and stated that all of her books were short, divided into [...] "ever shorter" [...] chapters as her series progressed, and [...] "sometimes seem written for children rather than adults". [...] McWhorter recognized, however, that Angelou's precise prose and [...] "striking and even jarring simplicity" [...] was due to Angelou's purposes of depicting African-American culture in a positive way. [...] Busby also recognized Angelou's ability to find inspirational lessons from adversity, both nationally and personally, although the emphasis in this book was on the personal, especially her dilemmas as a mother and as a lover.|$|E
500|$|Following the {{appearance}} of Arthur Curry, which {{became one of the}} highest rated episodes of that season, Smallville developers Al Gough and Miles Millar began work on an Aquaman pilot for The WB Television Network, with Justin Hartley as Arthur Curry. As work progressed on season five's [...] "Aqua", the character was recognized to have potential for his own series. The season five episode was never meant to be a backdoor pilot for an Aquaman television spin-off, so Alan Ritchson was never considered for the role. Gough stated in a November 2005 interview that the series would have put a different spin on the Aquaman mythology. Although Gough <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the new series as a true spin-off, he did suggest an interest in doing a crossover with Smallville. Aquaman is currently the only series to go into production, though it was ultimately not picked up by The CW network, which had formed from a merger between The WB and UPN during the production of the pilot.|$|E

500|$|Nécib {{was born}} on 23 January 1987 {{in the city of}} Marseille to parents of Algerian origin. Her father had emigrated to France from Biskra, while her mother had come from Oran. Nécib was raised in Busserine, a {{quartier}} located in the northern suburbs of the 14th arrondissement of Marseille and has a brother and sister. After signing with Lyon, Nécib enrolled at the Université Lyon 1 with hopes of completing her undergraduate studies in Sciences et techniques des activités physiques et sportives (STAP) (...) [...] She developed an interest in football at a young age, prior to which she trained in gymnastics. She, initially, <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the future prospects of women's football and played mainly for recreation with males stating [...] "I'd always played with the boys in my neighborhood" [...] and [...] "I didn't plan to join a club because, to be honest, I didn't know girls' teams existed. Then, one day I found out there was a club in the 14th arrondissement and I signed up".|$|E
500|$|The {{pilot was}} shot in April 1995 and {{directed}} by Michael Lessac. Although set in Cleveland, the show was actually filmed at the Warner Bros. Television studios in Burbank, California. Helford had noticed that the cast <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> each other while saying their lines {{and he tried to}} encourage them to look at one another, so they would laugh. Helford told Lessac to bring the cast in on a weekend, where there was no pressure, so they could [...] "goof around" [...] and relax. Drew's job required him to work from a cubicle and Helford stated that no one had really done a show dealing with that situation, as producers and networks felt it was too confined. Helford disagreed and had a set where an accessible cubicle was the centerpiece designed and built. The Memphis Plaza Lounge in Old Brooklyn was the inspiration for the show's bar The Warsaw Tavern. The owner of the Lounge refused to sell the naming rights to Warner Bros, but he did agree that they could film the front of the building. The crew shot the building in 1995 and temporarily replaced The Memphis Plaza Lounge sign with their own Warsaw Tavern one. The sign was hung in the front window for two years before Warner Bros. took it down.|$|E
500|$|Although some {{survivors}} {{disputed the}} accounts of cannibalism, Charles McGlashan, who corresponded {{with many of the}} survivors over a 40-year period, documented many recollections that it occurred. Some correspondents were not forthcoming, approaching their participation with shame, but others eventually spoke about it freely. McGlashan in his 1879 book History of the Donner Party declined to include some of the more morbid detailssuch as the suffering of the children and infants before death, or how Mrs. Murphy, according to Georgia Donner, gave up, lay down on her bed and faced the wall when the last of the children left in the third relief. He also neglected to mention any cannibalism at Alder Creek. The same year McGlashan's book was published, Georgia Donner wrote to him to clarify some points, saying that human flesh was prepared for people in both tents at Alder Creek, but to her recollection (she was four years old during the winter of 1846–1847) it was given only to the youngest children: [...] "Father was crying and <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> us the entire time, and we little ones felt we could not help it. There was nothing else." [...] She also remembered that Elizabeth Donner, Jacob's wife, announced one morning that she had cooked the arm of Samuel Shoemaker, a 25-year-old teamster. Eliza Donner Houghton, in her 1911 account of the ordeal, did not mention any cannibalism at Alder Creek.|$|E

2500|$|Several media outlets, {{especially}} {{those on the}} Internet, reported controversy over McCain referring to Obama as [...] "that one" [...] while discussing energy policy.

This incident was recreated on Saturday Night Live, with the actor portraying McCain referring to his opponent as [...] "this character here," [...] "junior," [...] and [...] "pee-pants."

2500|$|A 2008 Boston Globe report {{asserted}} that waiting {{time for the}} majority of trips actually increased as a result of demand induced by the increased road capacity. Because more drivers were opting to use the new roads, traffic bottlenecks were only pushed outward from the city, not reduced or eliminated (although some trips are now faster). The report states, [...] "Ultimately, many motorists going to and from the suburbs at peak rush hours are spending more time stuck in traffic, not less." [...] The Globe also {{asserted that}} their analysis provides a fuller picture of the traffic situation than a state-commissioned study done two years earlier, in which the Big Dig was credited with helping to save at least $167 million a year by increasing economic productivity and decreasing motor vehicle operating costs. That study <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> highways outside the Big Dig construction area and did not take into account new congestion elsewhere.|$|E
