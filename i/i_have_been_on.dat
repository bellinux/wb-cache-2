500|$|In June 2013, fellow {{state senator}} Don Benton filed a {{complaint}} against Rivers, claiming she had broken a senate floor rule by swearing at him during a floor discussion. Benton also claimed that Rivers had screamed at him on one other occasion, during a Republican caucus. He claimed that he had felt physically threatened, saying, [...] "It was a very uncomfortable feeling. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> {{the receiving end of}} many heated comments over the years, but I have never before felt the threat of physical violence." [...] Rivers responded with an apology; he took issue with some of the wording in the apology and he filed the complaint. Many have come out in support of Rivers, who claims that Benton was harassing her, adding she will, [...] "stand my ground against anyone who attempts to bully, intimidate or threaten me." [...] Some have labeled Benton a hypocrite, as he recently lifted sanctions against Pam Roach, who had been seen screaming on the floor and had mistreated staff. In a January 2014 decision, officials in the Washington State Legislature have decided both Senators were at fault for the spat. They determined that Benton had harassed Rivers, which provoked her. On the decision, Rivers stated, [...] "I have to conclude {{that he was trying to}} bait me into this reaction, which unfortunately he did.” ...|$|E

France and Britain became allies along with Russia in order to defend their borders and support each other in case of war.
