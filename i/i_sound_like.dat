However, she was fired from the project with little explanation. Years later, Garofalo stated [...] "I was never told why [...] I assume because <b>I</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> a man sometimes?

500|$|ASAP Rocky's flow {{throughout}} the mixtape is tempered, and his delivery ranges from nonchalant rhymes to forceful [...] Jon Caramanica {{writes that the}} subject matter, including [...] "straight-talking boasts" [...] and [...] "heavy intake of drugs and women", is revealed by his [...] "bursts of short phrases, rhymed in their entirety." [...] On [...] "Palace", ASAP Rocky demonstrates alliterative lyricism and [...] cadence and flow. His flow patterns have been compared by writers to those of Cleveland-based hip hop group Bone Thugs-N-Harmony. August Brown of the Los Angeles Times writes that [...] "his reserved, steely delivery owes equal debts to Houston's syrup daze and Dipset's uptown intensity". He addresses his rapping style on [...] "Purple Swag": [...] "I'm Texas trill, Texas trill, but in NY we spit it slow". On [...] "Leaf", he addresses hip-hoppers' criticism of his style: [...] "They say <b>I</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> André / mixed with Kanye / {{a little bit of}} Max / a little bit of Wiz / {{a little bit of that}} / a little bit of this / get off my dick".|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of Massive Dynamic founder William Bell was originally {{meant to be}} revealed earlier in the first season, but the writers changed their minds as the show progressed. In early April 2009, Entertainment Weekly announced that Star Trek actor Leonard Nimoy had been cast as Bell. He and Fringe co-creator J.J. Abrams already had a relationship after working together on the 2009 film Star Trek; Abrams stated {{in an interview that}} he called Nimoy and begged him to join Fringe, explaining the show and the character. Nimoy sounded interested but wanted to become more familiar with the show, so Abrams and the other producers sent him as much information as they could about Fringe, until Nimoy agreed. This exchange of phone calls, in which Nimoy responded with interest when pitched the idea, was also how Abrams was able to cast him in his Star Trek reboot. Nimoy later explained [...] "When they contacted me about working on Fringe -- the same people, the same attitude, the same creativity, the same creative team – it was very enticing". According to Abrams, [...] "The idea that he will play the mysterious, much-referenced William Bell is a thrill. I know <b>I</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> a goofy fan boy, but I can’t help it: Leonard is an icon of the genre and such a wonderful actor. To have him come on board Fringe is a mind-blowing honor".|$|E
5000|$|Bachman {{agreed to}} {{rearrange}} the album sequence so the song could be added, {{but only if}} he could re-record the vocals first, without the stutter. Fach agreed, but Bachman says [...] "I tried to sing it normal, but <b>I</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> Frank Sinatra. It didn't fit." [...] Fach said to leave it as it was, with the stutter.|$|R
5000|$|Eminem recalls: [...] "Obviously, I {{was young}} and {{influenced}} by other artists, and I {{got a lot of}} feedback saying that <b>I</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> AZ. Infinite was me {{trying to figure out how}} I wanted my rap style to be, how <b>I</b> wanted to <b>sound</b> on the mic and present myself. It was a growing stage. I felt like Infinite was like the demo that just got pressed up." ...|$|R

Uh, pardon me if <b>I</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> a name dropper, but, uh, let's look into {{three or four of}} the names we've lined up for next week's show: Groucho Marx, Fanny Brice, Jane Powell and Ezio Pinnnn-za! (Laughter) Well, now, don't just sit there with your mouths open, darlings. I know what you're thinking: you think such a radio show every week is impossible. And I'm sure that, after you hear our first broadcast, you're going to say that show was impossible. (Laughter) Oh, no, that doesn't sound quite right, does it? (Laughter) But NBC says nothing is impossible. All it takes is courage, vision, and a king-sized bundle of dough. Each week, there will be comedy, drama, music, all performed by the biggest stars of the time. Of course, darlings, now and then a clinker may sneak in, but we're going to try-- ...|$|E

[...] "It {{was hard to}} listen to, but I mimicked the bands I loved; Siouxsie and the Banshees, Adam and the Ants, and The Damned were all English bands.

5000|$|Margaret Pomeranz {{objected to}} the central sexual {{relationship}} of the film. [...] "I know <b>I</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> a Victorian aunt, but I really hated that betrayal of that relationship between Alan and Steph. I mean, it's not the older man, younger woman thing, it isn't, it's almost like he's her father and it's almost like an incestuous relationship. A film takes a step like that and it takes me where I really don't want to go. I reacted against everybody, I felt alienated from those characters at that moment." ...|$|E
