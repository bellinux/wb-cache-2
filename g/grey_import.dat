40|$|The {{study is}} titled â€œThe {{effects of the}} grey {{importation}} of vehicles {{on the performance of}} franchised new car dealers: A case of Puzey and Payneâ€. The main objective of the research was to establish the effects of the grey importation of vehicles on the profitability of franchised new car dealers. The research also sought to analyze the effects of <b>grey</b> <b>imports</b> on the sales of new vehicles by franchised dealers. The literature reviewed include Duhan and Sheffet (1988) views on the nature of <b>grey</b> <b>imports</b> and Clerides (2005) perspectives on the impact of <b>grey</b> <b>imports</b> on franchised dealers and the economy. The target population of the research were the employees and the management of Puzey and Payne. Interviews and questionnaires were used to collect primary data for the research on a sample size of 20 respondents whom were selected using the purposive sampling technique. The study shows that the performance of Puzey and Payne has greatly declined due to the influx of second hand vehicles from Japan, United Kingdom and other developed countries. The study also established that <b>grey</b> <b>imports</b> are substitutes of the new cars imported by franchised dealers through official channels of distribution. They are cheaper or affordable alternatives of new vehicles which explains the decline in sales by franchised dealers. The study also assessed government policies that relate to the importation of used goods and the effects on the economy. The main recommendations of the study are centered on encouraging franchised dealers to diversifying product range and include the selling and servicing of <b>grey</b> <b>imports</b> if they are to improve their performance. Also the research recommends that the government should put in place policies that rationalize unfair competition posed by <b>grey</b> <b>imports</b> in the motor industry. Regarding the implications of the research findings the researcher recommends that other areas of research be undertaken...|$|R
40|$|Russian {{authorities}} give two official {{figures for}} {{imports of goods}} to Russia. Russian Customs registers values stated in customs declarations, while the Central Bank of Russia adds in its estimate of <b>grey</b> <b>imports</b> to obtain an overall import figure. Using mirror statistics of Russia’s main trading partners, we suggest that <b>grey</b> <b>imports</b> are in fact higher than the CBR estimate. Hence, official statements of trade and current ac-count surpluses should be reduced to better reflect Russia’s actual ex-ternal balance. This would also imply less capital outflow from Russia than suggested by current estimates...|$|R

25|$|A compact {{version of}} Arial Bold is {{currently}} the typeface preferred by the Road Transport Department and is thus the most commonly used, but other easy-to-read typefaces are generally acceptable.

More obscure custom typefaces have also been known to be used primarily on <b>grey</b> <b>import</b> vehicles and aftermarket license plates.|$|E

It is even possible for car buyers in the United Kingdom to buy right-hand drive cars in EU countries with right-hand traffic where left-hand drive cars are the norm.|$|R

In the United States, courts have ruled decoding is legal, however manufacturers and brand owners may have rights if they can prove that the decoding has materially altered the product where certain trademarks have been defaced or the decoding has removed the ability of the manufacturer from enforcing quality-control measures. For example, if the decoding defaces the logo of the product or brand or if the batch code is removed preventing the manufacturer from re-calling defective batches.|$|R
