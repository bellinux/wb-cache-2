40|$|A Pipeline Analytical Program and <b>Dredging</b> Knowledge{Base Expert{System (DKBES) determines a {{pipeline}} <b>dredge's</b> production and resulting cost and schedule. Pipeline <b>dredge</b> engineering presents {{a complex and}} dynamic process necessary to maintain navigable waterways. <b>Dredge</b> engineers use pipeline engineering and slurry transport principles to determine the production rate of {{a pipeline}} <b>dredge</b> system. Engineers then use cost engineering factors to determine {{the expense of the}} <b>dredge</b> project. Previous work in engineering incorporated an object{oriented expert{system to determine cost and scheduling of mid{rise building construction where data objects represent the fundamental elements of the construction process within the program execution. A previously developed <b>dredge</b> cost estimating spreadsheet program which uses hydraulic engineering and slurry transport principles determines the performance metrics of a <b>dredge</b> pump and pipeline system. This study focuses on combining hydraulic analysis with the functionality of an expert{system to determine the performance metrics of a <b>dredge</b> pump and pipeline system and its resulting schedule. Field data from the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers pipeline <b>dredge,</b> Goetz, and several contract daily <b>dredge</b> reports show how accurately the DKBES can predict pipeline <b>dredge</b> production. Real{time <b>dredge</b> instrumentation data from the Goetz compares the accuracy of the Pipeline Analytical Program to actual <b>dredge</b> operation. Comparison of the Pipeline Analytical Program to pipeline daily <b>dredge</b> reports shows how accurately the Pipeline Analytical Program can predict a <b>dredge</b> project's schedule over several months. Both of these comparisons determine the accuracy and validity of the Pipeline Analytical Program and DKBES as they calculate the performance metrics of the pipeline <b>dredge</b> project. The results of the study determined that the Pipeline Analytical Program compared closely to the Goetz eld data where only pump and pipeline hydraulics a ected the <b>dredge</b> production. Results from the <b>dredge</b> projects determined the Pipeline Analytical Program underestimated actual long{term <b>dredge</b> production. Study results identi ed key similarities and di erences between the DKBES and spreadsheet program in terms of cost and scheduling.

40|$|The Flemish Community is {{continuously}} {{looking to}} improve maintenance <b>dredging</b> works through careful selection of <b>dredging</b> and disposal locations {{and through the}} use of more efficient <b>dredging</b> equipment. Most sediment pollution consist of fine grained sediments. These sediments tend to settle in the entrance channels to sealocks, in harbour areas or other waterways with low currents. Therefore, special attention has to be paid to maintenance <b>dredging</b> procedures in these areas, in order to reduce both the economic and ecological impact of the removal of contaminated fine grained sediment. To meet these environmental requirements and to achieve a cost-effective solution, a new type of <b>dredge</b> has been developed in co-operation with the Flemish Institute for Scientific-Technological Research Promotion in the Industry (IWT). This scoop <b>dredge</b> has been successfully tested in the access channel to the Kallo Lock and in the adjacent harbour area. Based on this experience and on environmental dragheads of trailing suction hopper <b>dredges,</b> further breakthrough in environmental <b>dredging</b> has been achieved. The sweep <b>dredge</b> combines the advantages of stationary <b>dredges</b> and trailers. The sweep <b>dredge</b> is able to work in shallow water and to remove very thin layers of polluted fine-grained sediments at high concentrations. The principles of both <b>dredges</b> have been patented worldwide. This paper will discuss: - The criteria for <b>dredging</b> and removal of contaminated fine-grained sediments in an economic and ecologically acceptable way. - The development of the scoop <b>dredge,</b> the results of the <b>dredging</b> operations and the various test and monitoring programmes. - The development of the sweep <b>dredge</b> and the evaluation of its characteristics...|$|R

Although products such as lumber were often transported on an existing network of railroads in Oregon, these advances in navigation helped businesses deliver more goods to Portland, feeding the city's growing economy. Trade goods from the Columbia basin north of Portland could also be transported southward on the Willamette due to the deeper channels made at the Willamette's mouth.|$|E

An unusually high spring tide was due in March 1942 which would allow a light ship to pass over the sand banks in the estuary and approach the docks, bypassing the heavily defended <b>dredged</b> channel.
