50|$|Platinum NPs exhibit {{fascinating}} optical properties. Being a free <b>electron</b> <b>metal</b> NP like {{silver and}} gold, its linear optical response is mainly {{controlled by the}} surface plasmon resonance. Surface plasmon resonance occurs when the electrons in the metal surface are subject to an electromagnetic field that exerts a force on the electrons and cause them to displace from their original positions. The nuclei then exert a restoring force that results in oscillation of the electrons, which increase in strength when frequency of oscillations is in resonance with the incident electromagnetic wave.|$|E

A slender, light magnesium alloy (<b>electron</b> <b>metal)</b> tube ran aft {{from the top of the}} pod, carrying the empennage, which had ply covered fixed surfaces and fabric covered control surfaces.

Its enclosed cabin, entered via centrally hinged, multi-part glazing, had two forward seats, equipped with dual controls, and a rear bench seat. It was normally flown from the left-hand seat, where the rudder bar was fitted with brake pedals. The flap lever was placed centrally.

Since [...] is linear in [...] and [...] is linear in , at low temperatures the lattice contribution vanishes faster than the electronic contribution and the latter can be measured. The deviation of the approximated and experimentally determined electronic contribution to the heat capacity of a metal is not too large. A few metals deviate significantly from this approximated prediction. Measurements indicate that these errors {{are associated with the}} electron mass being somehow changed in the metal, for the calculation of the electron heat capacity the effective mass of an electron should be considered instead. For Fe and Co the large deviations are attributed to the partially filled d-shells of these transition metals, whose d-bands lie at the Fermi energy.The alkali metals are expected to have the best agreement with the free electron model since these metals only one s-electron outside a closed shell.

40|$|First the {{dielectric}} response of a bulk free <b>electron</b> <b>metal</b> is simplified {{so that it}} contains both collective mode (plasmon) and single particle mode structure, taken up by one single effective electron-hole pair mode of appropriate spectral strength. Then the enhanced local excitation of electron hole pairs in the surface region is modelled by addition of a phenomenological term with empirically adjustable amplitude. This provides an approximate surface response function. The first model yields very good results for the internal photoyield. The second is supplemented with a simplified surface barrier (a square step with the jellium edge withdrawn to ensure charge conservation) and corresponding electronic wavefunctions. This yields fairly good results for the total photoyield, while providing a very substantial simplification...|$|E

In the side-contacted geometry, the coupling of armchair and metallic-zigzag nanotubes to a free <b>electron</b> <b>metal</b> are significantly different. Namely, it is possible to drive a larger current through a metallic-zigzag nanotube.

30|$|There are two {{practical}} {{approaches to}} achieve the hyperbolic dispersion which we discuss below. The fact that hyperbolicity requires metallic behavior {{in one direction and}} insulating behavior in the other leads to the requirement that both metals and dielectrics must be used as building blocks. Microscopically, the origin of the high-k propagating waves relies on a metallic building block to create the hyperbolic dispersion of the material (section 1.0). The polaritonic properties of the metallic building blocks allow for the necessary light-matter coupling to create the high-k waves. Specifically, it is necessary to have a phonon-polaritonic (optically active phonons) or plasmon-polaritonic (free <b>electron)</b> <b>metal</b> to construct hyperbolic metamaterials. The high-k modes are a result of the near-field coupling of the surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) at each of the metal-dielectric interfaces in the structure. The high-k modes are the Bloch modes of the metal-dielectric superlattice.|$|E

40|$|An {{essentially}} exact {{solution of}} the infinite dimensional Hubbard model is made possible by using a self-consistent mapping of the Hubbard model in this limit to an effective single impurity Anderson model. Solving the latter with quantum Monte Carlo procedures enables us to obtain exact results for the one and two-particle properties of the infinite dimensional Hubbard model. In particular we find antiferromagnetism and a pseudogap in the single-particle density of states for sufficiently large values of the intrasite Coulomb interaction at half filling. Both the antiferromagnetic phase and the insulating phase above the Néel temperature {{are found to be}} quickly suppressed on doping. The latter is replaced by a heavy <b>electron</b> <b>metal</b> with a quasiparticle mass strongly dependent on doping as soon as n< 1. At half filling the antiferromagnetic phase boundary agrees surprisingly well in shape and order of magnitude with results for the three dimensional Hubbard model. Comment: 32 page...|$|E

Such a "hybridization node" is demonstrated for a simplified model of a Cerium-based cubic heavy <b>electron</b> <b>metal.</b> We show that the quasiparticle weight varies from almost unity in some directions, to values approaching zero in others.

40|$|The {{modeling}} of carbon nanotube-metal contacts is important from both basic and applied view points.

In this paper, we calculate the electron transmission probability from a nanotube to a free <b>electron</b> <b>metal,</b> which is side-contacted. If the metal-nanotube interface is sufficiently ordered, we find that k-vector conservation {{plays an important role in}} determining the coupling, with the physics depending on the area of contact, tube diameter and chirality. The main results of this paper are: (i) conductance scales with contact length, a phenomena that has been observed in experiments and (ii) in the case of uniform coupling between metal and nanotube, the threshold value of the metal Fermi wave vector (below which coupling is insignificant) depends on chirality. Disorder and small phase coherence length relax the need for k-vector conservation, thereby making the coupling stronger. ...|$|E
40|$|CeCu_ 2 Si_ 2 is an {{exemplary}} correlated <b>electron</b> <b>metal</b> that features two domes of unconventional superconductivity in its temperature-pressure phase diagram. The first dome surrounds an antiferromagnetic quantum critical point, whereas the more exotic second dome may span the termination {{point of a}} line of f-electron valence transitions. This behavior has received intense interest, but what has been missing are ways to access the high pressure behavior under milder conditions. Here we study Si → P chemical substitution, which compresses the unit cell volume but simultaneously weakens the hybridization between the f- and conduction electron states and encourages complex magnetism. At concentrations that show magnetism, applied pressure suppresses the magnetic ordering temperature and superconductivity is recovered for samples with low disorder. These results reveal that the electronic behavior in this system is controlled by a nontrivial combination of effects from unit cell volume and electronic shell filling. Guided by this topography we discuss prospects for uncovering a valence fluctuation quantum phase transition in the broader family of Ce-based ThCr_ 2 Si_ 2 -type materials through chemical substitution.
