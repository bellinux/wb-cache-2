60|$|But it was {{different}} with the Dutch. That very rudeness of climate which had so impressed the Portuguese adventurer {{was the source of}} their success. Cold and poverty and storm are the nurses of the qualities which make for empire. It is the men from the bleak and barren lands who master the children of the light and the heat. And so the Dutchmen at the Cape prospered and grew stronger in that robust climate. They did not penetrate far inland, for they were few in number and all they wanted was to be found close at hand. But they built themselves houses, and they supplied the Dutch East India Company with food and water, gradually budding off little townlets, Wynberg, Stellenbosch, and pushing their settlements up the long slopes which lead to that great central plateau which extends for fifteen hundred miles {{from the edge of the}} Karoo to the Valley of the Zambesi. Then came the additional Huguenot emigrants--the best blood of France three hundred of them, a handful of the choicest seed thrown in to give a touch of grace and soul to the solid Teutonic strain. Again and again in the course of history, with the Normans, the Huguenots, the Emigres, one can see the great <b>hand</b> <b>dipping</b> into that storehouse and sprinkling the nations with the same splendid seed. France has not founded other countries, like her great rival, but she has made every other country the richer by the mixture with her choicest and best. The Rouxs, Du Toits, Jouberts, Du Plessis, Villiers, and a score of other French names are among the most familiar in South Africa.|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with direct conversion of thermal energy into electrical energy by subjecting pyroelectric materials to the Olsen cycle. The Olsen cycle consists of two isoelectric field and two isothermal process on the electric displacement versus electric field diagram. The energy and power generation capabilities of copolymer poly(vinylidene fluoridetrifluorethylene) [P(VDF-TrFE) ] films and lead lanthanum zirconate titanate (PLZT) ceramics were evaluated by executing the Olsen cycle via so-called "stamping experiments" and "dipping experiments". The stamping experiments consisted of alternatively pressing a pyroelectric material in thermal contact with hot and cold aluminum blocks under specified electric fields. It was performed to assess the pyroelectric energy conversion performance using heat conduction. The largest energy density generated in the stamping experiments was 155 J/L/cycle with 60 / 40 P(VDF-TrFE) thin film at 0. 066 Hz between 25 and 110 °C and electric fields cycled between 20 and 35 MV/m. This energy density exceeded the 130 J/L/cycle achieved by our previous prototypical device using oscillatory laminar convective heat transfer. However, the performance was limited by poor thermal contact between the aluminum blocks and pyroelectric material and also by excessive leakage current inherent to P(VDF-TrFE) at high temperatures and/or large electric fields. On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>dipping</b> experiments consisted of successively immersing a pyroelectric material into isothermal hot and cold thermal reservoirs at different temperatures while simultaneously cycling the electric fields. It was performed on relaxor ferroelectric x / 65 / 35 PLZT ceramics with x between 5 and 10 mol. %. The operating temperature, applied electric field, sample thickness, cycle frequency, and electrode material were systematically varied to explore their respective effects on the energy and power densities produced. A maximum energy density of 1014 J/L/cycle was obtained with a 190 μm thick 7 / 65 / 35 PLZT sample at 0. 0256 Hz at temperatures between 30 and 200 °C and electric field from 0. 2 to 7. 0 MV/m. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, this energy density is the largest achieved among pyroelectric single crystals, ceramics, and polymers using the Olsen cycle. Meanwhile, a maximum power density of 55. 3 ± 8. 0 W/L obtained with a 190 μm thick 9. 5 / 65 / 35 PLZT sample at 0. 125 Hz. Additionally, the temperature-dependent dielectric behavior of PLZT ceramics were characterized. The polarization transition temperature of lanthanum-doped x / 65 / 35 PLZT ceramics decreased from 240 to 10 °C for increasing lanthanum dopant concentration x from 5 to 10 mol. %. This establishes that the different compositions should be operated at different temperatures for maximum pyroelectric energy conversion. Finally, a physical thermo-electrical model for estimating the energy harvested by ferroelectric relaxors was further validated against experimental data {{for a wide range of}} electric fields and temperatures...|$|E

60|$|The valleys, {{by which}} the Cordillera are drained, follow the {{anticlinal}} or rarely synclinal troughs, which deviate most from the usual north and south course; or still more commonly those lines of faults or of unequal curvature (that is, lines with the strata on both <b>hands</b> <b>dipping</b> in the same direction, but at a somewhat different angle) which deviate most from a northerly course. Occasionally the torrents run for some distance {{in the north and}} south valleys, and then recover their eastern or western course by bursting through the ranges at those points where the strata have been least inclined and the height consequently is less. Hence the valleys, along which the roads run, are generally zigzag; and, in drawing an east and west section, it is necessary to contract greatly that which is actually seen on the road.|$|R
