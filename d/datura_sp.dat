40|$|A disease causing mosaic {{and leaf}} {{distortion}} {{was observed in}} 80 % of Datura stramonium L. plants in a garden in Ibadan, Nigeria. The causal agent had flexuous rod-shaped particles of about 750 - 800 nm length. The virus was readily mechanically transmissible but was not seed borne in the natural host. The virus was not transmissible to any other host genera and was restricted to D. stramonium and D. metel. In serological tests using protein A-sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (PAS-ELISA) and antisera to ten {{members of the family}} Potyviridae, the virus from D. stramonium reacted only with the antiserum to Pepper veinal mottle virus (PVMV) genus Potyvirus. Optical density readings of 3. 564 and 0. 466 at 405 nm were obtained in reactions between PVMV antiserum and virus infected and healthy <b>Datura</b> <b>sp.</b> samples respectively. No serological relationship was detected between the virus from D. stramonium and Blackeye cowpea mosaic virus (BICMV) genus Potyvirus, Cowpea aphid-borne mosaic virus (CABMV) genus Potyvirus and Yam mosaic virus (YMV) genus Potyvirus in double antibody sandwich ELISA (DAS-ELISA) and immunosorbent electron microscopy (ISEM) tests. Although some of the data on symptomatology, host range and serological relatedness could implicate Datura shoestring virus (DSV) genus Potyvirus, the virus may actually be an unusual strain of PVMV...|$|E
40|$|Potato virus X (PVX) {{is among}} top ten most {{economically}} damaging plant viruses {{in the world}} and its increasing incidence is getting an alarming situation in potato crop of Pakistan. During two consecutive years (2010 - 11 and 2011 - 12), the incidence of PVX was recorded in potato fields at Rawalpindi, Islamabad, Faisalabad and Sahiwal. The samples were collected and subjected to Double Antibody Sandwiched (DAS) Enzyme Linked Immunosorbant Assay (ELISA) and average incidence of PVX was determined about 16. 86 % (OD 405 nm 1. 38) during 2010 - 11 and 27. 10 % (OD 405 nm 0. 479) in 2011 - 12.

40|$|Tropane {{alkaloids}} (TAs) are toxic secondary metabolites {{produced by}} plants of, inter alia, the genera Datura (thorn apple) and Atropa (deadly nightshade). The most relevant TAs are (-) -L-hyoscyamine and (-) -L-scopolamine, which act as antagonists of acetylcholine muscarinic receptors and can induce {{a variety of}} distinct toxic syndromes in mammals (anti-cholinergic poisoning). The European Union has regulated the presence of seeds of <b>Datura</b> <b>sp.</b> in animal feeds, specifying that the content should not exceed 1000 mg kg(- 1) (Directive 2002 / 32 /EC). For materials {{that have not been}} ground, visual screening methods are often used to comply with these regulations, but these cannot be used for ground materials and compound feeds. Immunological assays, preferably in dipstick format, can be a simple and cost-effective approach to monitor feedstuffs in an HACCP setting in control laboratories. So far no reports have been published on immunoassays that are capable of detecting both hyoscyamine and scopolamine with equal sensitivity and that can be used, preferably in dipstick format, for application as a fast screening tool in feed analysis. This study presents the results obtained for the in-house and inter-laboratory validation of a dipstick immunoassay for the detection of hyoscyamine and scopolamine in animal feed. The target level was set at 800 µg kg(- 1) for the sum of both alkaloids. By using a representative set of compound feeds during validation and a robust study design, a reliable impression of the relevant characteristics of the assay could be obtained. The dipstick test displayed similar sensitivity towards the two alkaloids and it could be concluded that the test has a very low probability of producing a false-positive result at blank level or a false-negative result at target level. The assay can be used for monitoring of TAs in feedstuffs, but has also potential as a quick screening tool in food- or feed-related poisonings...|$|E
40|$|Description of the subject. The hyoscyamine, a tropane alkaloid, {{widely used}} in medicine, can be {{produced}} from <b>Datura</b> <b>sp.</b> (Solanaceae). However, its content in the spontaneous roots remains low; therefore, hairy roots (HRs) were envisaged as a potential alternative to improve its biosynthesis. The hairy roots are characterized by a good genetic stability and a rapid growth. Indeed, Datura stramonium HRs have widely been studied in the perspective of improving the yield of hyoscyamine. This study {{is part of this}} same perspective. Objectives. This paper aims to study the effects of polyploidization of HRs induced by colchicine in synergy with elicitation (with acetylsalicylic [ASA] or salicylic acids [SA]) on the hyoscyamine content in D. stramonium. Method. Colchicine was applied at different concentrations and periods, on a selected hairy root line (LDS) of D. stramonium obtained by infection with Agrobactrium rhizogenes strain A 4. The selection of tetraploid HR lines was performed by the cytogenetic analysis using light microscopy. The effect of polyploidization and elicitation was studied on the biomass (dry weight) and hyoscyamine content of HRs. Results. The untreated HR line (control) shows a diploid level with 2 n = 24 chromosomes. However, the HR lines treated with colchicine show, in most cases, an endoreduplication of their genetic material. The survival rate of endoreduplicated lines varies between 30 % and 93 %, depending on concentration and exposure time to colchicine. Moreover, the tetraploid HR line shows an increase in its biomass and hyoscyamine content in comparison to the diploid HR line (LDS). Further, elicitation of HRs by ASA or AS at the 10 - 4 M concentration causes a low decrease or increase in dry weight, respectively. However, the same treatments show {{a significant increase in the}} yield of hyoscyamine in elicited HR lines. Consequently, our work indicates that the combination of polyploidy and elicitation can lead to significant improvements in hyoscyamine biosynthesis and content due to their synergistic effects. Conclusions. Elicitation of tetraploid hairy root lines improves significantly their content of hyoscyamine...|$|E
40|$|African cassava mosaic virus (ACMV; genus Begomovirus, family Geminiviridae) {{is one of}} six viruses {{documented}} in cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz.) plants showing cassava mosaic disease in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). In addition to cassava, the natural host range of ACMV includes a few wild Manihot species, Jatropha multifida, and Ricinus communis L. in Euphorbiaceae, and Hewittia sublobata in Convolvulaceae. The experimental host range of ACMV includes Nicotiana sp. and <b>Datura</b> <b>sp.</b> in the Solanaceae (2). Recently, natural occurrence of ACMV was reported in Combretum confertum (Benth.), Leucana leucocephala (Lam.) De Witt, and Senna occidentalis (L.) Link belonging to Leguminasae from Nigeria (1, 3). During reconnaissance studies conducted on soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.) in September and October of 2007 in the Ibadan (N = 19) and Benue (N = 23) regions and in February of 2008 in Ibadan (N= 16), we observed soybean showing yellow mosaic and mottling symptoms. Samples from these plants (N = 58) were tested by indirect ELISA and symptomatic leaves tested negative to Cucumber mosaic virus, Cowpea mottle virus, Southern bean mosaic virus, Tobacco ringspot virus, Soybean dwarf virus, Cowpea aphid-borne mosaic virus, Blackeye cowpea mosaic virus, Peanut mottle virus, and Broad bean mosaic virus, which have been {{documented in}} soybean in SSA. However, 8. 6 % of these samples (5 of 58) (one each from Ibadan and Benue in the 2007 survey and three from Ibadan in the 2008 survey) tested positive in triple-antibody sandwich-ELISA with a monoclonal antibody (SCR 33) to ACMV. ELISA results were further confirmed by PCR with ACMV specific primers AL 1 /F and AR 0 /R that amplified a 987 -bp DNA fragment corresponding to the intergenic region, AC- 4 and AC- 1 genes of DNA-A segment (4). The PCR product was cloned into pCR 2. 1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and three independent clones were sequenced in both orientations. Pairwise comparison of the derived consensus sequence (GenBank Accession No. EU 367500) with corresponding ACMV sequence of ACMV isolate from Nigeria (GenBank Accession No. X 17095) showed 98 % identity at the nucleotide level. To further confirm the virus identity, complete nucleotide sequence of the DNAA segment was determined by PCR amplification of viral DNA with four primers, cloning of overlapping products into pCR 2. 1 vector and sequencing. The derived sequence (2, 781 nucleotides; GenBank Accession No. EU 685385) was compared with the DNA sequences available at NCBI database using BLAST. This revealed 97 % nucleotide sequence identity with ACMV-[NG:Ogo: 90] (Accession No. AJ 427910) and ACMV-[NG] (Accession No. X 17095) from Nigeria. These results confirm the presence of ACMV in symptomatic soybean leaves. To our knowledge, {{this is the first}} report of soybean as a natural host of ACMV in SSA. On the basis of previous reports (1) and the results currently presented it seems that ACMV has a wide host range. Peer Revie...|$|E
