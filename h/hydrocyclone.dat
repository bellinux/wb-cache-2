Production was eased throughout the period by increased access to lumber and higher demand. The Anker Mill was rebuilt to produce paperboard. A new lumber cleaning mill opened in 1951, followed by a new central furnace the following year, a pyrite roaster and lumber chopper in 1953 and a new beater in 1954. Tistedalsfoss II Power Station and a spirit factory with an annual production of [...] opened in 1955. A <b>hydrocyclone</b> facility for the sulfite pulp mill, new 10,000 tonne oil tanks and a calcium carbonate management facility for the paper mill were taken into use two years later. A new warehouse was completed in 1958 and the bleaching site expanded the year after. The ten-year plan ended with the expansion of the conditioning facility for the paper mill and expansion of the sulfite pulp mill in 1960. In addition a series of minor upgrades and modernizations were carried out throughout the 1950s, such as extending the paper machines. From 1956 operations ran around-the-clock.|$|E

30|$|Three-dimensional {{simulation}} of a multiphase flow {{is performed using}} the Eulerian-Eulerian finite volume method in order to evaluate the separation efficiency and velocity field of deoiling <b>hydrocyclones.</b> The solution is developed using a mass conservation-based algorithm (MCBA) with collocated grid arrangement. The mixture approach of the Reynolds stress model is also employed in order to capture features of turbulent multiphase swirling flow. The velocity field and separation efficiency of two different configurations of deoiling <b>hydrocyclones</b> are compared with available experimental data. The comparison shows that the separation efficiency can be predicted with high accuracy using computational fluid dynamics. The velocity fields are also in good agreement with available experimental velocity measurements. Special attention is drawn to swirl intensity in deoiling <b>hydrocyclones</b> and it is shown that the differences in velocity and volume fraction fields of different configurations are related to swirl distribution.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In the {{manufacturing}} process of magnesium carbonate and oxide from dolomites by carbon dioxide leaching are evacuated calcium carbonate waste, {{on one hand and}} on the other hand, in the carbide industry could be obtained calcium carbonate by practical application of some subsized lime fractions-containing waste. In order to obtain calcium carbonate in different sorts as final products from the mentioned waste, studies regarding the elimination of impurities were realised. For this purpose, the hydrodynamics classification in centrifugal field by passing the slurries through batteries of <b>hydrocyclones,</b> was taking into consideration as separation method. Rubber <b>hydrocyclones</b> of different diameters were fed through aqueous slurries of calcium and magnesium hydroxides, and through slime of calcium carbonate respectively. Different working variants, defined by pressure, flows, slurries concentration, nozzles opening ratios, were applied. The obtained results relieve that the efficient using of <b>hydrocyclones</b> is possible, in order to homogenize and to purify the lime and the calcium carbonate slurries, remarking good extraction yields...|$|R

50|$|Hydrocyclones are {{relatively}} inexpensive and also simple in operation. However there are capacity limitations, as <b>hydrocyclone</b> with large diameter will not generate sufficient centrifugal force for separation. Due {{to solve this}} limit, unlike the peeler centrifuge, hydrocyclones are sometimes used in series arrangement to achieve multiple separation stages.|$|E
40|$|<b>Hydrocyclones</b> enhance oil–water {{separation}} efficiency compared to conventional separation methods. An efficient collision detection scheme with Np ln Np dependency {{on the number}} of particles is proposed. The scheme is developed to investigate the importance of particle–particle interaction for flow and particle behavior in dilute oil–water separators. However, the proposed scheme can also be used for efficient multigrid soft collision calculation with long-range particle–particle interaction models. The collision detection scheme is first validated using a case of settling spheres. Subsequently, the scheme is applied to a simplified flow field, similar to the flow fields observed in <b>hydrocyclones...</b>|$|R

40|$|The incessant and {{stochastic}} {{character of}} rainfall in young and fragile mountain catchment generates {{enormous amount of}} sediment in Himalayan rivers. Irregularity in plan and bed forms, heterogeneity in bed and suspension loads, debris and mudflows make hydraulics of river channel flow quite complex and withdrawal of sediment free water from these rivers a very challenging task. Consequently, sediment related damages due to wear and tear {{in most of the}} hydropower projects, but in medium and high head plants {{have been found to be}} quite alarming. The conventional wisdom that particles smaller than 200 micron do not cause wear and tear to the turbines and accessories has been found to be inadequate in this region. Therefore, there is a need of excluding most of the sand particles from the flow. However, due to topographical limitations as well as higher cost of the gravity settling basins, construction of bigger settling basins is often impossible. Therefore, there is a need of different approach to be adopted to exclude fine sediment in such cases. This paper puts forth centrifugal acceleration technique and particularly the use of <b>hydrocyclones</b> for particle separation. Experimental investigations on hydraulic and particles separation efficiency of 224 mm and 380 mm dia <b>hydrocyclones</b> are reported. The performance s have been compared among the <b>hydrocyclones</b> and the settling basins. The particles removal efficiency of <b>hydrocyclones,</b> especially of finer particles have been found to be much higher than that of gravity settling basins...|$|R
