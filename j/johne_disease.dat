Epidemiologic surveys performed in Europe, North America and New Zealand have demonstrated the existence and importance of environmental and wildlife reservoirs of mycobacterial infections that limit the attempts of disease control programmes. The aim of this review is to examine the zoonotic aspects of mycobacteria transmitted from the environment and wildlife. This work is focused on the species of two main groups of mycobacteria classified as important pathogens for humans and animals: first, M. bovis, the causative agent of bovine tuberculosis, which belongs to the M. tuberculosis complex and has a broad host range including wildlife, captive wildlife, domestic livestock, non-human primates and humans; the second group examined, is the M. avium-intracellulare complex (MAC) which includes M. avium ssp. avium causing major health problems in AIDS patients and M. avium ssp. paratuberculosis the etiological agent of <b>Johne</b> <b>disease</b> in cattle and identified in patients with Crohn disease.

Animals were obtained from several herds with evidence of disease based on seropositivity and/or fecal shedding. Sixty-eight cows with initial evidence of Stage II or III paratuberculosis and two with an initial Stage IV disease were evaluated longitudinally. Animals were either treated daily with variable, disease-dependent doses of Dietzia (n = 48) or left untreated (n = 22). Clinical aspects of disease (diarrhea, emaciated, cachectic and appetite) were recorded until the animal recovered or required euthanasia due to advanced clinical paratuberculosis or other severe conditions. Paratuberculosis parameters—antibody serology (ELISA, AGID) and fecal culture—were longitudinally monitored over the lifetime of each animal. The results indicated that daily treatment with Dietzia was therapeutic for paratuberculosis cows based on: (a) longitudinal decline in ELISA values only occurred in animals that were treated; (b) prolonged survival was dependant upon treatment—the length being directly associated with low initial ELISA values; and (c) treated animals were the only ones cured of disease.

Association analyses were conducted with the Wald test (tolerance) and the Chi-square test (Map tissue infection). A region of 32 kb was associated with tolerance (P< 0. 03), and an 86 kb region was associated with Map tissue infection (P< 0. 05). These results support our previous findings and suggest the existence of a gene or regulatory element associated with tolerance and infection on BTA 15 and BTA 3,respectively.

40|$|<b>Johne’s</b> <b>disease</b> is {{a chronic}} {{diarrhea}} affecting all ruminants. Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP), a slowly growing mycobacteria, is the etiologic agent. There {{is also a}} concern that MAP might be a causative agent of some cases of inflammatory bowel disease in humans, especially Crohn’s disease. Food products including pasteurized bovine milk have been suggested as potential sources of human infection. This review addresses microbial factors that may contribute to its pathogenicity. In addition, the experimental evidence defining MAP {{as the cause of}} <b>Johne’s</b> <b>disease</b> and the issues and controversies surrounding its potential pathogenic role in humans are discussed...|$|R
