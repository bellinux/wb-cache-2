40|$|A section {{describing}} {{basic concepts}} of storage, <b>grain</b> <b>conditioning,</b> and drying is included {{at the beginning}} for those less familiar with grain storage. This {{is followed by a}} brief description of tools for cleaning before sections on major specific functional areas found in storage systems (i. e. bins, bin dryers, and stand alone dryers). A section on handling equipment, augers, and other conveyors is included adjacent to a safety section at the end. Augers and conveyors serve to connect grain receiving, drying, storage, and load-out areas. Readers unfamiliar with the concept of augers mentioned in storage and drying sections may want to review the section on handling equipment first. Terms and phrases used for storage and handling equipment are described as they come up within these different sections. Although it has been attempted to eliminate technical jargon, readers may want to refer to the appropriate section to review unfamiliar terms. Safety information is included as appropriate within each section {{as well as at the}} end. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a {{method by which}} the particle size distribution functions of the product in each stage of a gradual reduction milling process can be introduced. The particle size distribution functions were introduced by which the particle size distribution data of the product in each stage on several milling tests at three levels of <b>grain</b> <b>conditioning</b> were fitted to the particle size distribution function model using each milling condition as parameters by applying a least squares method. They represent {{the relation between the}} fluctuation of each milling condition in milling process and the fluctuation of organization of the particle size distribution of the product in each stage. The purpose of the introduction of them is the establishment of the interchangeable calculating method of intermediate products amount on the actual industrial processes. テスト製粉用製粉機を用いて行なった挽砕・篩分試験により, 段階式製粉工程における各工程産物毎の粒度分布関数を導出した. 以下, その結果を列挙する. 1) 段階式製粉工程における中間産物の粒度分布関数に適応する関数モデルを検討した結果, 係数がパラメータに関して線形である, 粒度に関する 3 次多項式が最適であることを明確にした. 2) 工程入力産物の各性状要素をパラメータとした, 工程出力産物の粒度分布を表わす式構造を定義した. 3) テスト製粉用製粉機を用いた挽砕・篩分試験により, 工程入力産物の各性状要素及び工程出力産物の粒度分布を測定した. 4) ガウス法を用いた最小二乗近似により, 計測データを粒度分布モデルにあてはめ, 各工程産物毎の粒度分布関数を決定した. その適合性は良好であった. 以上, 段階式小麦製粉工程の流量変動シミュレーション手法を考える上で有用となる, 各工程産物毎の粒度分布関数の導出手法について述べた...|$|E

Effective yield strength {{was controlled by}} applyingdifferent mean <b>grain</b> size <b>conditionings</b> using Hall-Petch equation. It was shown that increasing the vanadium alloying elementcontent increased the yield strength and also decreased the mean grain size. The development of the complex as-castedpolygonal-acicular ferrite / pearlite microstructures during the cooling and annealing treatment was systematically investigated and correlated with yield strength...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{understand}} the inheritance of grain iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn) concentrations in sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] and to assess the possibility of exploiting heterosis to improve these micronutrients. Three sets of full diallel crosses were made, one set using five parents contrasting for both grain Fe and Zn concentrations; the second set using six parents contrasting only for Fe, and the third set with four parents contrasting only for Zn. The crosses and parents were evaluated in replicated trials for two years. The results indicated that both additive and non-additive gene action play a role in <b>conditioning</b> <b>grain</b> Fe and Zn concentration in sorghum. However, non-additive gene action is predominant in <b>conditioning</b> <b>grain</b> Fe; and additive gene action in <b>conditioning</b> <b>grain</b> Zn. Some of the crosses showed significant heterosis for grain Fe concentration without yield penalty and some crosses showed targeted grain Zn concentration (40 mg kg− 1) coupled with higher grain yields. The results also showed that it is possible to improve grain Fe concentration through exploiting heterosis, but there would be little opportunity if any for improving grain Zn through heterosis breeding. To develop hybrids with high grain Fe and Zn concentration in sorghum both parents needs to be improved for these micronutrients. Combining higher grain Fe and Zn with high yield is feasible...|$|R
40|$|Iowa {{was very}} {{fortunate}} to receive two weeks of warmer than normal weather, and more importantly lower than expected humidity in the air. This has allowed soybean harvest to be nearly completed, and rapid progress {{to be made on}} corn harvest, with moistures now in the low 20 s and upper teens. The eastern and far northern Corn Belt still have much wetter corn in the field. New problems have arisen, and efforts now turn to <b>conditioning</b> <b>grain</b> for storage...|$|R
40|$|Consider {{the free}} field on a fractal graph {{based on a}} high-dimensional Sierpinski carpet (e. g. the Menger sponge), that is, a {{centered}} Gaussian field whose covariance is the Green's function for simple random walk on the graph. Moreover assume that a "hard wall" is placed at height zero so that the field stays positive everywhere. We prove the leading-order asymptotics for the local sample mean of the free field above the hard wall on any transient Sierpinski carpet graph, thereby extending a result of Bolthausen, Deuschel, and Zeitouni for the free field on Z^d, d ≥ 3, to the fractal setting. Our proof utilizes the theory of transient regular Dirichlet forms, {{in conjunction with the}} relative entropy, coarse <b>graining,</b> and <b>conditioning</b> arguments introduced in the previous literature.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to (1) {{determine}} a practical method for <b>conditioning</b> <b>grain</b> for storage; (2) establish structural and equipment requirements of a system for applying the determined method to general farm use; and (3) establish an operating procedure for use of the conditioning system as developed. It is apparent that <b>conditioning</b> of <b>grain</b> for storage might be accomplished by forced circulation of air through the grain, using either heated air, under any climatic conditions, or unheated air, under favorable climatic conditions. For the method to be proposed and furthered in this study, it was decided that: Drying would be done with forced circulation of unheated air. Drying would be done after grain was put into storage bins. The results of these tests offer a definite proof that grain can be properly conditioned for safe storage by drying with unheated forced air, as long as given in the Conclusions of this paper are met. However, the conditions listed may not be, and very probably are not, the only conditions for safe drying of grain with unheated air. Advisor:L. W. Hurlbu...|$|R
40|$|The soybean {{programme}} in Zimbabwe is over {{seventy years}} old. However, there {{is lack of}} information on breeding gains, genetic diversity, heritability, genetic advance, combining ability, gene action and relationships between grain yield and secondary traits available for breeding. Therefore, {{the aim of the}} present study was to characterise the genetic diversity of the available germplasm, determine gene action <b>conditioning</b> <b>grain</b> yield and estimate the breeding gains that have been realised since the inception of the breeding programme. Evaluation of 42 soybean genotypes for genetic diversity conducted during 2010 / 11 and 2011 / 12 cropping seasons, using phenotypic and molecular characterisation approaches, revealed evidence of wide diversity among the genotypes. The phenotypic traits and SSR markers assigned the soybean genotypes to 8 and 15 clusters respectively. The SSR marker technique was more polymorphic, informative and highly discriminatory. The clustering pattern and relatedness from SSR data was in agreement with the pedigree data while the phenotypic clustering was divorced from pedigree data. Genotypes, G 41 and G 7; G 41 and G 1; G 41 and G 42 were the most divergent; therefore, they could be utilized a...|$|R
40|$|At a {{time when}} many {{countries}} are unable to feed their populations, large proportions of grain harvests continue to be lost because of poor storage: from 10 to 15 %, in some cases even more. How can storage techniques be improved and wastage eliminated ? A technical publication from the International Labour Office provides some of the answers for storage on the scale of a family, village or community. It describes traditional storage structures and shows ways of improving them, but also presents new structures, with detailed technical instructions for building and fitting them. For national decision-makers, national storage strategies are examined and a method for assessing storage costs is proposed. This volume is part of a technology series, which aims to provide information about different small scale production techniques. Subjects range from tanning and fish-processing to paper-making. The series is an aid to planners and to promoters of smallscale industry, including cooperation agencies. The publications in this series are a useful tool for choosing the techniques best suited to local socio-economic <b>conditioning</b> <b>Grain</b> storage Technology Series No 11 International Labour Office CH- 1 211 Geneva 22 SwitzerlandGrain storage Technology Series No 11 International Labour Office CH- 1 211 Geneva 22 Switzerlan...|$|R
