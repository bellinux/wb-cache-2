25|$|Preliminary wet {{chemistry}} lab results showed the surface soil is moderately alkaline, between pH 8 and 9. Magnesium, sodium, potassium and chloride ions were found; the {{overall level of}} salinity is modest. Chloride levels were low, and thus {{the bulk of the}} anions present were not initially identified. The pH and salinity level were viewed as benign from the standpoint of biology. TEGA analysis of its first soil sample indicated the presence of bound water and CO2 that were released during the final (highest-temperature, 1,000°C) <b>heating</b> <b>cycle.</b>|$|E

40|$|Zirconium-alloys such as ZrNi and ZrCo {{have been}} {{developed}} so far as promising materials for storage, supply and recovery of tritium. They, however, easily lose their ability of reversible absorption-desorption of tritium {{in the presence of}} impurity gases such as O 2, H 2 O, CO 2, CO and others. Although we have developed a method to lower this contamination effect, there is another possibility for the degradation of their properties by repeated <b>heat</b> <b>cycles</b> in a hydrogen atmosphere. To examine this possibility, we studied the changes in the characteristics of those alloys for hydrogen absorption and desorption owing to the <b>heat</b> <b>cycles</b> in the presence of hydrogen in a system. The samples were used as grains. They were first exposed to a hydrogen gas to prepare respective hydrides of a form of ZrMH 3, where M is Ni or Co. Subsequently, the changes in the absorption-desorption characteristics were measured in a closed system during <b>heat</b> <b>cycles</b> between room temperature and 600 ℃. No significant change in the equilibrium pressure of hydrogen was observed up to 50 <b>heat</b> <b>cycles</b> for ZrNi. X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that the sample kept ZrNi structure before and after the <b>heat</b> <b>cycles.</b> The hydride formed was always ZrNiH 3. Contrarily, ZrCo showed drastic changes in the absorption-desorption characteristics in 50 <b>heat</b> <b>cycles.</b> X-ray diffraction analysis showed that the ZrCoH 3 initially formed was decomposed to ZrHx + ZrCo 2. Namely, the disproportionation of ZrCo took place. It is noteworthy that the disproportionation reaction did not occur in the absence of hydrogen isotopes in the system. On account of these observations, it was concluded that the degradation of absorption-desorption characteristics of ZrCo is due to the ease in disproportionation, and hence its ability is kept for a large number of <b>heat</b> <b>cycles,</b> namely storage, supply and recovery operations...|$|R

25|$|Electrical {{immersion}} heaters may heat water immediately {{adjacent to the}} heating element high enough to promote the formation of scale, commonly calcium carbonate, in hard water areas. This accumulates on the element, and over time, as the element expands and contracts through its <b>heating</b> <b>cycle,</b> the scale cracks off and drops {{to the bottom of}} the tank, progressively filling up the tank. This reduces the tank's capacity and, where the immersion heater is secondary to the heating of the water by a coil fed from a gas or oil-fired boiler, can reduce the efficiency of the primary heating source by covering that other coil and in turn reducing its efficiency. Regular flushing-out of accumulated sediment can reduce this problem.|$|E

The two methods are the hybrid system: (refrigeration cycle – rotary desiccant) and the <b>heat</b> exchanger <b>cycle.</b> The impact of the desiccant performance on the hybrid system performance was studied. The impact of the heat exchanger efficiency on the performance of <b>heat</b> exchanger <b>cycle</b> was studied. Hybrid system, <b>heat</b> exchanger <b>cycle,</b> and conventional refrigeration cycle were compared at different design air flow rates and different air conditions. It was found that the hybrid system and the <b>heat</b> exchanger <b>cycle</b> can achieve lower SHR and dew point temperature than those of the conventional cooling system. On general, the hybrid system can achieve lower SHR and dew point than those of the <b>heat</b> exchanger <b>cycle.</b> Although the <b>heat</b> exchanger <b>cycle</b> can achieve lower SHR and dew point than those of the conventional cooling system, the coefficient of performance and the cooling effect of the <b>heat</b> exchanger <b>cycle</b> are lower than those of the conventional cooling system, because the temperature of the cooling coil of the <b>heat</b> exchanger <b>cycle</b> is lower than that of the conventional cooling system.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the feasibility of reforming flat ablative panels to a curved configuration. The study indicated that if the panels could be shaped to a radius of 2. 54 m (100 in.) then 88. 7 % of the surface area of the orbiter could be covered, and that if they could be shaped to a radius of 3. 81 m (150 in.) then 77. 2 % of the surface could be covered. Two basic approaches were followed to determine the best method for forming the flat panels to a curved shape. The first was to determine if partially cured panels could be formed, allowing the forming <b>heat</b> <b>cycle</b> to complete the curing of the ablator. The second method was to form fully cured flat panels into the desired curvature through a secondary <b>heat</b> <b>cycle.</b> Measurements made on the panels during storage indicated that they continued to straighten out over time.
