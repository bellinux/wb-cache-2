5|$|Adam, a photographer, awakens in {{a bathtub}} {{in a large}} {{dilapidated}} bathroom, and finds himself chained at the ankle to a pipe. Lawrence Gordon, an oncologist, is similarly shackled across the room, and between them is a corpse holding a revolver and a microcassette recorder. Each man has a tape in <b>his</b> <b>pocket,</b> <b>and</b> Adam is able to retrieve the recorder. Adam's tape urges him to escape the bathroom, while Lawrence's tape tells him to kill Adam by six o'clock, or {{his wife and daughter}} will be killed and he will be left to die. Adam finds a bag containing two hacksaws inside a toilet tank; they attempt to cut through the chains, but Adam's saw breaks and he throws it at the mirror in frustration, revealing a hidden camera behind the mirror. Lawrence realizes that the hacksaws weren't meant for the chains, but for their feet and identifies their captor as the Jigsaw Killer, whom Lawrence knows of because he was a suspect five months before.|$|E

The Angels attack and Sally and Larry use the Yale key to hide inside the TARDIS. The Angels surround and rock the TARDIS to try to gain entry. Once in the control room, a hologram of the Doctor informs them that they have a control disk with them. Larry takes a now-glowing DVD from <b>his</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>and</b> inserts it into the console. The TARDIS' engines engage and the ship dematerialises, leaving a panicking Sally and Larry behind. With the TARDIS gone, the Angels who were all stood around the TARDIS have been tricked into looking at each other and have become permanently frozen as statues.|$|E

Diana tells him that she {{will have a lot}} of job offers in New York, but Paul says that no one will be interested as she is toxic. Diana's plane ticket is cancelled and she is thrown out of the hotel by Paul. She asks Declan for help and he tells her that Paul keeps his business papers in the home safe. Diana kisses Paul, {{and at the same time}} she takes his house keys from <b>his</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>and</b> she breaks into his house. Diana does not find anything and, in anger, she smashes Paul's possessions. Diana calls a mystery person and arranges for them to hurt Paul. She then goes to Rebecca and tells her about her husband's affair. Someone goes to the Lassiter's mezzanine and pushes Paul from it. Detective Mark Brennan (Scott McGregor) discovers one of Diana's earrings at the scene and he stops her at the airport. During questioning, Diana tells him to speak to Rebecca again after revealing her affair with Paul. Andrew, Summer Hoyland (Jordy Lucas) and Natasha Williams (Valentina Novakovic) follow Diana and see her meeting with Jack Ward (Peter Lowrey), a hitman she called on the night Paul was pushed.

25|$|Connally {{was known}} as an immaculate dresser who wore {{expensive}} and stylish suits wherever he went. Biographer Charles Ashman related a story about Connally's carrying a cigarette lighter in <b>his</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>and</b> lighting cigarettes as a courtesy only for very wealthy men who might be inclined to contribute to his political causes or retain him as a consultant on business arrangements.|$|E
25|$|Lebrón, Cancel Miranda and Figueroa Cordero were {{immediately}} arrested. However, Flores {{walked away from}} the building in the confusion that followed. He took a taxi to a bus stop.

They found a loose bullet in <b>his</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>and</b> arrested him.|$|E
25|$|While {{the actors}} were {{attempting}} to quell the panic, the head usher, Thomas Rocheford, went {{to the rear of}} the auditorium to open the Flood's Alley special exit door on the east end of the vestibule, opposite of the Washington Street entrances, one of the three special exit doors designed by architect Jackson. Since the doors were rarely used, he found the locking mechanism corroded; he was initially unable to open the doors. He found a small piece of metal in <b>his</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>and</b> with this was able to release the doors. This action enabled the people on the floor of the auditorium to evacuate the building fairly quickly, but Rocheford's action came at a cost. The open doors furnished airflow for the fire on the stage, which immediately grew in intensity.|$|E

25|$|In 2004, Aunor {{made her}} last film shot {{entirely in the}} Philippines before she went on hiatus for almost 8 years. Naglalayag {{tells the story of}} a May–December affair between a middle-aged judge and a young taxi driver. It sparkles because of superb acting by Aunor and Yul Servo.

Her character Dorinda is a 50-year-old widow with a twenty-something-year-old son, Yul Servo played Noah Garcia, a courteous and charming taxi driver who keeps a rosary in <b>his</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>and</b> shares stories from the Bible. Stranded with a non-operational taxi, the 23-year-old novice driver Noah offers shelter to his passenger. The performances by Aunor and Servo gave them their international acting awards at the 31st Festival International du Film Indépendant de Bruxelles and the film won the jury prize, they also received local recognition.|$|E
25|$|Suda was {{disappointed}} {{with the quality of}} Travis' wrestling techniques, and performed some of them on the animators to demonstrate. Certain other details of Travis are based on Suda, including the sound of a key ring jingling in <b>his</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>and</b> his love of cats. A Ubisoft contest was held to allow one winner's design to be used in Desperate Struggle for one of Travis' T-shirts. In an interview with Nintendo Power, Suda stated that he wanted Travis to become a huge star, stating that {{this was one of the}} reasons he wanted to make Desperate Struggle as interesting as possible. Nintendo Power editors told Joystiq that Suda considers Travis his favorite character. Suda states that No More Heroes 2 will be Travis' last appearance in the series, as his story will be completely finished. The Californian setting of No More Heroes is partially based on Travis, who Suda stated had a variety of frustrations and emotions that helped him fit in with that setting.|$|E

25|$|Under Bradlee's leadership, The Washington Post took {{on major}} {{challenges}} during the Nixon administration. In 1971 The New York Times and the Post successfully challenged the government {{over the right}} to publish the Pentagon Papers. One year later, Bradlee backed reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein as they probed the break-in at the Democratic National Committee Headquarters in the Watergate Hotel. According to Bradlee: You {{had a lot of}} Cuban or Spanish-speaking guys in masks and rubber gloves, with walkie-talkies, arrested in the Democratic National Committee Headquarters at 2 in the morning. What the hell were they in there for? What were they doing? The follow-up story was based primarily on their arraignment in court, and it was based on information given our police reporter, Al Lewis, by the cops, showing them an address book that one of the burglars had in <b>his</b> <b>pocket,</b> <b>and</b> in the address book was the name 'Hunt,' H-u-n-t, and the phone number was the White House phone number, which Al Lewis and every reporter worth his salt knew. And when, the next day, Woodward—this is probably Sunday or maybe Monday, because the burglary was Saturday morning early—called the number and asked to speak to Mr. Hunt, and the operator said, 'Well, he's not here now; he's over at' such-and-such a place, gave him another number, and Woodward called him up, and Hunt answered the phone, and Woodward said, 'We want to know why your name was in the address book of the Watergate burglars.' And there is this long, deathly hush, and Hunt said, 'Oh my God!' and hung up. So you had the White House. You have Hunt saying 'Oh my God!' At a later arraignment, one of the guys whispered to a judge. The judge said, 'What do you do?' and Woodward overheard the words 'CIA.' So if your interest isn't whetted by this time, you're not a journalist.Ensuing investigations of suspected cover-ups led inexorably to congressional committees, conflicting testimonies, and ultimately to the resignation of Richard Nixon in 1974. For decades, Bradlee was one of only four publicly known people who knew the true identity of press informant Deep Throat, the other three being Woodward, Bernstein, and Deep Throat himself, who later revealed himself to be Nixon's FBI associate director Mark Felt.|$|E
500|$|Passengers applauded as Schuringa {{walked back}} to his seat. The suspect was {{isolated}} from other passengers until after the plane landed. A flight attendant asked Abdulmutallab {{what he had in}} <b>his</b> <b>pocket,</b> <b>and</b> the suspect replied: [...] "Explosive device." [...] When the attack triggered a fire indicator light within the cockpit, the pilot requested rescue and law enforcement. The plane made an emergency landing at Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport in the Downriver Detroit community of Romulus, Michigan, just before 13:00 local time.|$|E
500|$|He was poignantly mourned in Philadelphia as {{a benevolent}} {{employer}} of over 3,000 and a rare businessman who treated his employees exceptionally well. The Chicago Tribune {{wrote that he}} was [...] "peculiar in his ideas. His hand was always in <b>his</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>and</b> his influence always for his less successful fellow-men to whom he took a fancy." [...] He was reported in 1889 to give $17,000 in Christmas gifts to his employees. His philanthropy branched out in other areas as well. In 1882 he sponsored the immigration of approximately 40 or 50 Russian Jewish families and purchased homes for them, assuring they would settle in Pennsylvania.|$|E

500|$|The 2014 White House {{intrusion}} {{occurred on}} September 19, 2014, when Omar J. Gonzalez, an Iraq War veteran with post-traumatic stress disorder, jumped over the White House's fence {{and entered the}} building's front door before being stopped by security officers and arrested. He {{was found to have}} a small knife in <b>his</b> <b>pocket,</b> <b>and</b> stated that the [...] "atmosphere was collapsing" [...] and he needed to tell the president so that he could alert the public. President Barack Obama and his family were not home {{at the time of the}} incident. As a result of this incident and other security breaches at the White House, then Director of the United States Secret Service, Julia Pierson, resigned from her position on October 1, 2014.|$|E
500|$|He {{commanded}} the company's 1st Battery at Fleurbaix, Messines {{and on the}} Somme until 5 August, when he was wounded in a duel with a German officer at Pozières. He and a German officer—who was leading an attack against Cherry's position—were exchanging shots from neighbouring shell-holes. Eventually, they both rose, firing simultaneously. The German officer hit Cherry in the neck but was mortally wounded by Cherry in return. Cherry approached the dying man, who pulled a package of letters from <b>his</b> <b>pocket,</b> <b>and</b> asked Cherry to have them censored and posted. Cherry promised {{to do so and}} the German handed over the letters, with the words; [...] "And so it ends". He died shortly afterwards. As a result of his wounds, Cherry was evacuated to England for treatment.|$|E
500|$|Union {{soldiers}} identified Anderson by {{a letter}} found in <b>his</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>and</b> [...] paraded his body {{through the streets}} of Richmond, Missouri. The corpse was photographed and displayed at a local courthouse for public viewing, along with Anderson's possessions. Union soldiers claimed that Anderson was found with a string that had 53 knots, symbolizing each person he had killed. Union soldiers buried Anderson's body in a field near Richmond in a fairly well-built coffin. Some of them cut off one of his fingers to steal a ring. Flowers were placed at his grave, to the chagrin of Union soldiers. In 1908, Cole Younger, a former guerrilla who served under Quantrill, reburied Anderson's body in the Old Pioneer Cemetery (Mormon) in Richmond, Missouri. In 1967, a memorial stone was placed at the grave.|$|E
