5|$|My {{interpretation}} {{is that she}} isn’t {{trying to keep the}} secret. That she doesn’t care. She changed <b>her</b> <b>last</b> <b>name</b> to avoid getting kidnapped, but really, if anyone figured it out and asked her, she’d just probably be like “Yeah, shut up!” or whatever. I feel like everyone at ISIS is so self-involved and so concerned with furthering their own agenda that it would never occur to them to think that anyone else has anything else going on.|$|E
5|$|For example, {{take the}} fictitious pair Irma Maes and Jef Jacobs {{as shown in}} the table. The first {{stimulus}} is A and U: the last letter of Irma's first name and a letter not in her name.

As {{can be seen in the}} table this is repeated for the remaining letters of Irma's first name. The letters of <b>her</b> <b>last</b> <b>name</b> then also appear in reverse order, and finally the letters of both of Jef's names. The shading in the table reveals the pattern hidden to subjects, who would have been told to circle their preferred letter of each pair as fast as possible without thinking.|$|E
