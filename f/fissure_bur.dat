The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the effect of ER: YAG laser on apical microleakage. Materials and Methods: Sixty extracted single-rooted teeth were used in this study. The roots were divided into six groups. Group 1 : apicoectomy by <b>fissure</b> <b>bur,</b> and apical cavities prepared by round bur, then cavities were filled with MTA. Group 2 : the roots preparations and fillings were the same as group 1, then the apical areas were treated by Er:YAG Laser. Group 3 : apicoectomy by <b>fissure</b> <b>bur,</b> and apical cavities prepared by ultrasound retrotip and cavities were filled with MTA. Group 4 : the roots preparations and fillings were the same as group 3, then the apical areas were treated by Er:YAG Laser. Group 5 : the roots obturation with gutta percha, then the apices were resected using Er:YAG Laser. Group 6 : the roots apices were resected with Er:YAG Laser, then the canals were obturates with gutta percha. Apical microleakage was measured by methylene blue dye penetration technique. Results: Significant difference between the groups. Group 1 shows the best apical seal, while group 5 shows the worse apical sealing ability. Conclusion: Apicoectomy by bur is better than apicoectomy by laser, and apical cavity prepared by bur is better than prepared by US.

Methods: In this in vitro study, 50 premolar teeth of human free of any caries were selected. Fissurotomy was done with <b>fissure</b> <b>bur.</b> The samples were randomly categorized into five groups (Fissurit FX, Fuji II light-cured,Grandio flow, Ionoseal). Ionoseal was assessed by using two methods: with and without etching and bonding agent prior to sealant application. After sealant placement, all surfaces of the teeth except 2 mm area around the sealant margins were covered with two layers of nail polish. The specimens were thermocycled, and they were sectioned after immersing into a 0. 5 % basic fuchsine solution. The amount of microleakage was examined by stereomicroscope. Results: The microleakage comparisons of groups indicated that Ionoseal without etching and bonding application had significantly greater microleakage than the other groups (p 0. 05). Conclusions: By considering isolation difficulties in children and observing high amount of Ionoseal microleakage (without etching and bonding application), the samples need to be etched and bonded like other resin-based materials before Ionoseal placement in order to achieve clinically desirable microleakage outcomes...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{our study}} was to {{evaluate}} the condition, particular structure and properties of the pulpal tissue by using various methods. The pulps used for this research had originated from intact teeth of healthy children, (five deciduous teeth without, and five deciduous teeth with physiological resorption). Immediately after the extraction (performed due to orthodontic reasons, under local anesthesia), each tooth was cut perpendicularly to its long axis with a rotating carborundum disc under a water jet. The separated halves were dissected with plastic instrument, and the tooth pulp was excavated completely The extracellular matrix is the major constituent of the connective tissue. This is composed of ground substance and fibrillar proteins. The main cells of the connective tissue are the fibroblasts. The pulp also contains odontoblasts (the highest differentiated cells), undifferentiated mesenchyme cells, and immunocompetent cells (lymphocytes, macrophages, leucocytes). Adequate pulp preparation {{has always been a}} challenge, because artefacts resulting from inadequate fixation often are described as evidence of pathosis.

40|$|Background: This human {{study was}} carried out to {{evaluate}} the possible effects of severe chronic periodontal disease on the different aspect of dental pulp structure. Materials and Methods: A total of 20 permanent teeth with a hopeless prognosis due to severe chronic periodontitis were extracted from systemically healthy adults, with a pocket probing depth of ≥ 8 mm and a mobility of grade 3. After extraction, the apical 2 - 3 mm of the roots were immediately sectioned with a <b>fissure</b> <b>bur.</b> Results: Inflammation was usual finding in the samples, however, only 15 % of the teeth showed no inflammation. Pulpal necrosis (partial or complete) was seen in different sections, and {{it was observed that}} 50 % sections had no necrosis. Partial necrosis was a common finding seen when compared to complete necrosis (6. 7 %). About 60 % of samples showed edematous pulp. Only 6. 7 % of samples showed absence of fibrosis. Pulp with moderate fibrosis was seen commonly seen in many sections. A majority of teeth (70 %) also displayed a loss of odontoblastic integrity. In only 25 % of samples, pulp stones were detected. Conclusion: Our results revealed that severe chronic periodontitis can affect dental pulp. The cumulative effect of the periodontal disease, as indicated by the factors of calcifications, apposition of calcified tissue, resorption or inflammation from the root caries or from the involved lateral canals, is damaged pulp tissue, but total disintegration is a certainty only when all main apical foramina are involved by bacterial plaque.

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} the microtensile bond strength (μTBS) of three self-etching adhesive systems with {{different degrees of}} acidity (Clearfil SE Bond, One-Up Bond F, and Xeno III) to dentin prepared with three different methods. Methods: Forty-five extracted human third molars were ground flat to expose occlusal dentin and polished with 600 -grit abrasive paper. All teeth were randomly divided into three groups according to the preparation method: baseline surface (AP# 600), steel <b>fissure</b> <b>bur</b> (SB) and regular grit diamond bur (DB). Dentin surfaces were bonded {{with one of the}} three adhesive systems; then resin composite was incrementally built up. After storage in 37 °C water for 24 hours, specimens were cut and trimmed to create an hourglass shape with cross sectional area of approximate 1 mm 2. All specimens were subjected to microtensile bond strength testing. The bond strength data were analyzed with one and two-way ANOVA and Dunnett Multiple comparisons test at P< 0. 05. Results: For Xeno III and One-Up Bond F, the μTBS to dentin prepared with the different methods were not significantly different. However, the μTBS of Clearfil SE Bond to dentin prepared with the diamond bur was significantly lower than the other preparation methods. Xeno III produced the lowest μTBS that were statistically different from the other adhesive systems when each preparation method was compared (P< 0. 01). SEM observation of the prepared dentin surfaces showed that the diamond bur group produced a thicker smear layer that followed by steel bur and 600 -grit paper.

40|$|Background: To avoid tissue {{alterations}} of {{the ridge}} after tooth extraction the socket shield technique was first introduced in 2010 by Hurzeler. It was suggested that instead of extracting the whole tooth, the buccal aspect of the root could be left intact to preserve the buccal plate of bone and prevent post extraction resorption, {{at the same time}} an immediate implant is placed; this would lead to an optimal stable esthetic result after the final delivery of the restoration. To extract the tooth while keeping the buccal aspect intact, a <b>fissure</b> <b>bur</b> is used to cut the tooth mesiodistaly then the lingual aspect of the tooth is extracted leaving a socket where the implant is to be placed. Materials and Methods: In this case report a bone trephine was used to take out the remaining root on tooth number 24 leaving an organized rounded section of the palatal/lingual extraction site with a semi lunar internal shape of the buccal aspect of the root that will receive an implant. Results after the implant prosthesis was delivered an unchanged emergence profile was noted. The pre operative cone beam computer tomography (CBCT) showed that there were no signs of infection and that the buccal plate was intact. The post-operative CBCT showed the same unchanged findings. Conclusion: Socket shield represents a promising technique to preserve the buccal plate of bone allowing for immediate implant placement. This helps in achieving an ultimate aesthetic outcome that may imitate the natural emergence profile of the neighboring dentition. In this case report we demonstrate that preparing the shield with a trephine may be of a great advantage...|$|E

With advances in restorative materials and metal bonding processes, composite veneer has enhanced esthetics of these crowns in clinic. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the shear bond strength of SSC to composite resin using different surface treatments and adhesives. Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, 90 stainless steel crowns were selected. They were mounted in molds and divided into 3 groups of 30 each (S, E and F). In group S (sandblast), buccal surfaces were sandblasted for 5 seconds. In group E (etch) acidic gel was applied for 5 minutes and in group F (<b>fissure</b> <b>bur)</b> surface roughness was created by fissure diamond bur. Each group was divided into 3 subgroups (SB, AB, P) based on different adhesives: Single Bond, All Bond 2 and Panavia F. Composite was then bonded to specimens. Cases were incubated in 100 % humidity at 37 °C for 24 hours. Shear bond strength was measured by Zwick machine with crosshead speed of 0. 5 mm/min. Data were analyzed by ANOVA test with p 0. 05) so the two variables were studied separately. No significant difference was observed in mean shear bond strength of composite among the three kinds of adhesives (P> 0. 05). Similar results were obtained regarding surface treatments (P> 0. 05).

40|$|Background and Aim: Achieving {{appropriate}} seal in canal obturation is {{the main}} goal of endodontic therapy. However, in some cases, {{it can not be}} obtained by non-surgical procedures alone. Retrograde surgery {{is one of the most}} common procedures in endodontics. Apical seal improvement can be obtained by root end filling and decreasing the root end resection angle (bevel angle). The aim of this study was to investigate the role of bevel angle on apical microleakage following the use of amalgam and MTA as root end filling materials. Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, 128 extracted human teeth were instrumented and obturated by lateral condensation technique. The teeth were divided into two groups and the apical root resection was performed by high speed <b>fissure</b> <b>bur</b> (one group perpendicular to the long axis of the teeth and the other 45 &# 61616; to the long axis. The 3 mm root end cavity was prepared by ultrasonic device. Each group was divided into two subgroups: One filled with amalgam and the other with MTA. Teeth were incubated for 72 h, covered by two layers of nail polish (except for apical 3 mm) and submerged in methylene blue for 48 h. Teeth were washed under tap water and mesiodistally dissected by low speed disc. Dye penetration was evaluated by stereomicroscope. Data were analysed by two way ANOVA and Tukey tests with p< 0. 05 as the limit of significance. Results: The results showed that retrofill material type had a significant effect on microleakage and MTA was superior to amalgam in this respect. Bevel angle failed to show any significant effect on apical microleakage. Conclusion: Based on the results of this study, it seems that the use of MTA instead of amalgam in clinical practice can improve the success rate of endodontic surgery whereas the bevel angle can be determined based on the status of each individual case; However, increasing the bevel angle seems to increase microleakage due to exposure of more dentinal tubules...|$|E

Methods: Seven extracted human premolars with single canals were selected for the study. The crowns were removed using a size 701 high speed <b>fissure</b> <b>bur.</b> The root canals were mechanically prepared using ProTaper Universal until #F 4 instrument and they were obturated using Thermafil Obturator #F 4. A post space was obtained drilling a 7 mm depth hole with a pre-calibrated 1. 2 mm diameter tip. Prepared teeth were randomly divided in two groups: a full post was luted in Group 1 (n= 3), while a hollow post in Group 2 (n= 4) by using a dual-curing self-adhesive resin cement. Treated tooth were mounted in resin blocks and sectioned perpendicular to the long axis of the root canal. Six 500 µm thick slices were obtained from each specimen. The push-out test was performed on each slice. Student’s t-test was used to compare push-out bond strength values between the two group. While comparisons of push out bond strength values among root region (cervical, middle and apical part), for each group, were performed with one-way ANOVA test. After the push-out test all specimens were analysed by scanning electron microscope (SEM) to determine the fracture patterns. The cross section of both the full and hollow posts were studied by SEM and EDS analysis to evaluate the amount and distribution of the glass fiber, as well as their chemical composition. The cross sections were prepared by embedding the samples into epoxy resin., The embedded samples were then grounded and polished on a plane orthogonal to the long axes of the sample until a complete exposure of the post cross section.
