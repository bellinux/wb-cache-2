40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} the publication speed (peer review time and publication time) of biomedical Indian journals and identify the journals having the facility of advance online publication (AOP). Materials and Methods: Biomedical Indian journals were identified from the Journal Citation Report of 2013. Thirty original articles published between January 2012 and June 2014 were systematically selected from each journal. Information about the date of submission, revision, and acceptance were extracted from the full text of the articles. Median peer review time (submission to acceptance) and publication time (acceptance to AOP/electronic publication) were calculated for each journal. Results: Of the 19 journals studied, 5 (26. 3 %), 15 (78. 9 %), and 6 (31. 6 %) journals did not mention details about date of submission, <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>revision,</b> and date of acceptance, respectively. The individual median peer review time of the journals ranged from 87 to 377. 5 days and the combined median peer review time (interquartile range) was 143. 5 days (105. 5, 238). The individual median publication time ranged from 14 to 349 days. The publication time for journals with AOP was significantly lesser (29. 5 [19. 6, 50. 6] vs. 146. 5 [126. 5, 202. 5]; P = 0. 02) compared to journals without AOP. Impact factor of the journal did not correlate with the publication speed. The facility of AOP was provided by 6 (31. 6 %) journals. Conclusions: Overall, the peer review time and publication time of biomedical Indian journals included in our study seems to be fairly long. Less than one-third of biomedical Indian journals provide the facility of AOP...|$|E

40|$|Background {{and purpose}} - The {{original}} Müller acetabular reinforcement ring (ARR) shows favorable medium-term results for acetabular reconstruction in total hip arthroplasty, {{where it is}} used when the acetabular bone stock is deficient. However, there are no data regarding long-term survival of the device. We therefore investigated long-term survival and analyzed radiological modes of failure. Patients and methods - Between 1984 and 2002, 321 consecutive primary arthroplasties using an ARR were performed in 291 patients. The mean follow-up time was 11 (0 - 25) years, and 24 hips were lost to follow-up. For survival analysis, we investigated 321 hips {{and the end of}} the follow-up was the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>revision,</b> date of death, or the last patient contact date with implant still in situ. Radiological assessment was performed for 160 hips with a minimum of 10 years of follow-up and with radiographs of sufficient quality. It included evaluation of osteolysis, migration, and loosening. Results - 12 ARR THAs were revised: 1 isolated ARR revision for aseptic loosening, 4 revisions of the ARR and the stem for aseptic loosening, 6 for infection, and 1 for recurrent dislocation. The cumulative revision rate for all components, for any reason, at 20 years was 15 % (95 % CI: 10 - 22), while for the ARR only it was 7 % (95 % CI: 4 - 12) for any reason and 3. 4 % (95 % CI: 1 - 9) for aseptic loosening. 21 (13 %) of 160 ARR THAs examined had radiological changes: 7 had osteolysis but were not loose, and 14 were radiologically loose but were not painful and not revised. Interpretation - Our data suggest that the long-term survival of the ARR is excellent...|$|E

40|$|The {{object of}} this {{bulletin}} {{is to put}} on record {{a description of the}} Monterey sardine[1] fishery which {{can be used as a}} basis for judging future changes in the conduct of this industry. Detailed knowledge of changes is essential to an understanding of the significance of total catch figures, or of records of catch per boat or per seine haul. It is particularly necessary when applying any form of catch analysis to a fishery as a means of illustrating the presence or absence of depletion or of natural fluctuations in supply. Most of the detailed descriptions in the following pages are based on conditions as they existed during the two fishing seasons, 1920 – 1921 and 1921 – 1922. However, the many changes, chiefly general developments in the industry, have so profoundly affected the total catch and catch per boat that several <b>revisions</b> <b>of</b> the original account have been required. <b>Dates</b> <b>of</b> <b>revision,</b> in parentheses, accompany the notes of these changes. While this is somewhat awkward, it definitely fixes the year in which certain practices began or were discontinued, and thus aids in fulfilling the chief purpose of the record. These notes include only a description of fishing methods, fishing gear, and some of the business conditions of the industry which directly affect the catch.

40|$|There {{has been}} a recent flurry of {{interest}} in the possibility of condensates of α-particles in nuclei. In this letter we discuss occurrence conditions for such states. Using the quantality condition of Mottelson we show that condensates are only marginally expected in α-particle states. We proceed to demonstrate that few-body nuclear condensates are ill-defined, and emphasize the conflict between α-localization and α-condensate formation. We also explore the connection between Ikeda diagrams, linear chains, and Tonks-Girardeau gases. Our findings show that no new information is contained in the approximations of nuclear states as α-cluster condensates. Furthermore, condensates of more than three α-particles are very unlikely to exist due to couplings to other degrees of freedom. Comment: 5 pages, revtex 4 format.

2500|$|The Welsh poem Geraint, son of Erbin, {{written in}} the 10th or 11th century, {{describes}} a battle at a port-settlement and mentions Arthur in passing.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Information on procedural skills lists was solicited. We sought <b>date</b> <b>of</b> creation, <b>date</b> <b>of</b> most recent <b>revision,</b> and {{who was involved in}} creating the list. A copy of the most recent list available was requested. RESULTS: We received 65 responses, for a 71 % return rate. Surveys were received from all provinces and from all Canadian universities offering family practice residency programs.

Only five procedural skills were found on more than 80 % of the lists; 30 skills were listed on half or more of the lists.

40|$|Background and Objective: The {{patient package}} insert is an {{important}} source of drug information. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate and compare the PPI of the anti-infective agents manufactured in Palestine with the imported equivalents. Method: The selection criteria generated 15 different anti-infective agents available as 36 locally manufactured products and 15 imported equivalents. The design of the {{patient package insert}} was evaluated in terms of the number of words used in eight main headings and the presence or absence of certain information regarding nine statements. Results: Inserts of locally manufactured products have significantly fewer words than those of imported products with respect to warnings, dosage and administration, and side effects. The most significant difference was found in the warnings. Moreover, differences were found between inserts of local and imported products in terms of the presence of the nine informative statements. Locally manufactured products did not mention inactive ingredients, clinical pharmacology or <b>date</b> <b>of</b> last <b>revision,</b> but all <b>of</b> them provided information on the use of the drug during pregnancy and lactation and on the duration of therapy. However, in general they provided less information than the imported equivalents.
