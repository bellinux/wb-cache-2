5|$|The Nanxiong Basin {{is known}} for its {{abundance}} of fossil eggs, predominantly the oviraptorisaurian eggs Elongatoolithus and Macroolithus. Other types of eggs <b>include</b> <b>other</b> elongatoolithids, as well as prismatoolithids, megaloolithids, and ovaloolithids. Footprints show that Nanxiong Basin was populated by ornithopods, theropods, and possibly sauropods.|$|E
5|$|The game {{includes}} nine {{missions that}} Cord has to complete. Almost every mission {{ends with a}} transitional cut scene, showing how Cord is interrogated and tortured. These scenes <b>include</b> <b>other</b> characters like Alpha or Kostov, who will give information about the next missions.|$|E
5|$|A {{good example}} of {{convergence}} in plants is the evolution of edible fruits such as apples. These pomes incorporate (five) carpels and their accessory tissues forming the apple's core, surrounded by structures from outside the botanical fruit, the receptacle or hypanthium. Other edible fruits <b>include</b> <b>other</b> plant tissues; for example, the fleshy part of a tomato is {{the walls of the}} pericarp. This implies convergent evolution under selective pressure, in this case the competition for seed dispersal by animals through consumption of fleshy fruits.|$|E

5|$|Dietary {{supplements}} often contain vitamins, but {{may also}} <b>include</b> <b>other</b> ingredients, such as minerals, herbs, and botanicals. Scientific evidence supports the benefits of dietary supplements for persons with certain health conditions. In some cases, vitamin supplements may have unwanted effects, especially if taken before surgery, with other dietary supplements or medicines, or if the person taking them has certain health conditions. They may also contain levels of vitamins many times higher, and in different forms, than one may ingest through food.|$|E
5|$|Japanese tempura is {{a popular}} deep-fried food that {{generally}} consists of battered and fried seafood and vegetables. Japanese deep-fried dishes, or Agemono, <b>include</b> <b>other</b> styles besides tempura, such as Karaage, Korokke, Kushikatsu, and Tonkatsu. In areas of south-east Asia such as Thailand, insects are commonly deep-fried for human consumption. Western-style fast food items such as donuts, deep-fried chicken, and deep-fried potatoes are also becoming popular in Asia.|$|E

5|$|Most LARPs are {{intended}} as games for entertainment. Enjoyable aspects can include the collaborative {{creation of a}} story, the attempt to overcome challenges {{in pursuit of a}} character's objectives, and a sense of immersion in a fictional setting. LARPs may also <b>include</b> <b>other</b> game-like aspects such as intellectual puzzles, and sport-like aspects such as fighting with simulated weapons.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} video games based on Tite Kubo's manga and anime series Bleach. The titles consist mostly of side-scrolling fighters, but also <b>include</b> <b>other</b> genres such as {{strategy}} role-playing games and action role-playing games. Most {{of the games}} retell {{the plot of the}} manga, following Ichigo Kurosaki and his friends. Some games, however, have veered from the source material and incorporated original stories and characters. The games have been released on a variety of home and handheld consoles.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, design {{management}} {{was seen as}} limited to the management of design projects, but over time, it evolved to <b>include</b> <b>other</b> aspects of an organization at the functional and strategic level. A more recent debate concerns the integration of design thinking into strategic management as a cross-disciplinary and human-centered approach to management. This paradigm also focuses on a collaborative and iterative style of work and an abductive mode of inference, compared to practices associated with the more traditional management paradigm.|$|E

5|$|A Great Eruption event {{similar to}} Eta Carinae A's {{has only been}} {{observed}} in one other star in the Milky Way—P Cygni—and {{in a handful of}} other possible LBVs in external galaxies. None of them seem to be quite as violent as Eta Carinae's. It is unclear if this is something that only a very few of the most massive LBVs undergo, something that is caused by a close companion star, or a very brief but common phase for massive stars. Some similar events in external galaxies have been mistaken for supernovae and have been called supernova impostors, although this grouping may also <b>include</b> <b>other</b> types of non-terminal transients that approach the brightness of a supernova.|$|E
5|$|After Prop 17 lost by a voter {{margin of}} 53–47, the project's opponents – which {{had grown to}} <b>include</b> <b>other</b> {{environmental}} groups, such as the Friends of the River and the Sierra Club – shifted their focus on limiting {{the amount of water}} the reservoir could hold, rather than trying to stop the dam altogether. In the meantime, construction on the dam continued to progress. On April 1, 1978 the gates of the diversion tunnel were closed, and New Melones Lake began to fill, soon inundating the old Melones Dam. As the reservoir filled, work moved ahead on the power plant and generating units, which were all completed by the end of 1978. The main embankment of the dam was topped out on October 28, 1978.|$|E
5|$|For certain {{physical}} scenarios, it {{is impossible}} to model forces as being due to gradient of potentials. This is often due to macrophysical considerations that yield forces as arising from a macroscopic statistical average of microstates. For example, friction is caused by the gradients of numerous electrostatic potentials between the atoms, but manifests as a force model that is independent of any macroscale position vector. Nonconservative forces other than friction <b>include</b> <b>other</b> contact forces, tension, compression, and drag. However, for any sufficiently detailed description, all these forces are the results of conservative ones since each of these macroscopic forces are the net results of the gradients of microscopic potentials.|$|E

5|$|Jadranski naftovod (JANAF) {{operates}} an oil terminal at Omišalj, Krk Island. In 2010, the JANAF transported 6.4million tonnes of oil, a 7% {{drop from}} 6.9million tonnes in 2009. In 2010, JANAF recorded annual revenue of 464.9million kuna (62.8million euro), down less than 1% from 2009, and annual net profit of 118.5million kuna (16million euro), up 11% {{from the previous}} year. However, JANAF operations <b>include</b> <b>other</b> facilities and services besides the oil terminal concession in the Port of Rijeka. JANAF is a joint stock company owned by the Croatian Pension Insurance Institute (50.5%), INA (16%), the Republic of Croatia (14.5%) and other shareholders owning less than 10% of stock each. JANAF's {{chairman of the board}} is Ante Markov. As of March 31, 2011, JANAF had 383 employees working in the Omišalj terminal and other JANAF facilities in Croatia.|$|E
5|$|Notable {{figures in}} the center of the painting, to the left of Małachowski, <b>include</b> <b>other</b> {{supporters}} of the Constitution. Priest Hugo Kołłątaj (11) is the most prominent, gesturing in disdain at Suchorzewski. Several other {{figures in the}} vicinity are described in sources, but their precise location is unclear, or the sources contradict one another. The priest holding the Bible (12) is probably Feliks Turski, although some identify him as Tymoteusz Gorzeński. The figures to the right of Kołłątaj represents the Grand Lithuanian Marshal, Ignacy Potocki (13), and perhaps Adam Kazimierz Czartoryski (14) (although some sources identify Czartoryski elsewhere in the painting, in the vicinity of Kościuszko). Surrounding Kołłątaj are likely the priest Scipione Piattoli (15) and Tadeusz Matuszewicz or Matusiewicz (16).|$|E
