500|$|The song is in a {{moderate}} rock tempo and in 4/4 time throughout. The musical <b>key</b> <b>over</b> the verses and two middle eight (or bridge) sections is B major, with frequent use of seventh chords. In the second bridge, the line [...] "Yes, my name is Billy Shears" [...] recalls Starr's alter-ego from the Beatles' 1967 album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band – specifically, the character named {{at the end of}} the album's title song and under which Starr sings the ensuing track, [...] "With a Little Help from My Friends". In [...] "I'm the Greatest", this section ends with a reference to Starr's age in early 1973: [...] "Now I'm only thirty-two / And all I wanna do, is boogaloo..." [...] The word [...] "boogaloo" [...] was a pet phrase of Bolan, whose use of the term had inspired Starr to write [...] "Back Off Boogaloo" [...] in 1971.|$|E
500|$|Early on {{the morning}} of 7 October 1965, shortly after Smith's call, Superintendent Bob Talbot of the Cheshire Police arrived at the back door of 16Wardle Brook Avenue, wearing a {{borrowed}} baker's overall to cover his uniform. Talbot identified himself to Hindley as a police officer when she opened the door, and told her that he wanted to speak to her boyfriend. Hindley led him into the living room, where Brady was sitting up in a divan writing a note to his employer explaining {{that he would not be}} able to get into work because of his ankle injury. Talbot explained that he was investigating [...] "an act of violence involving guns" [...] that was reported to have taken place the previous evening. Hindley denied that there had been any violence, and allowed police to look around the house. When they came to the upstairs room in which Evans's body was stored the police found the door locked, and asked Brady for the key. Hindley claimed that the key was at work, but after the police offered to drive her to her employer's premises to retrieve it, Brady told her to hand the <b>key</b> <b>over.</b> When they returned to the living room, the police told Brady that they had discovered a trussed up body, and that he was being arrested on suspicion of murder. As Brady was getting dressed, he said [...] "Eddie and I had a row and the situation got out of hand." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{dimensions}} and key {{system of the}} modern western concert flute and its close relatives are almost completely {{the work of the}} great flautist, composer, acoustician, and silversmith Theobald Boehm, who patented his system in 1847. It was immediately popular, and spread worldwide in just a few years. Minor additions to and variations on his key system are common, but the acoustical structure of the tube remains almost exactly as he designed it. Major innovations were the change to metal instead of wood, large straight tube bore, [...] "parabolic" [...] tapered headjoint bore, very large tone holes covered by keys, and the linked key system, which simplified fingering somewhat. The most substantial departures from Boehm's original description are the universal elimination of the [...] "crutch" [...] for the left hand and almost universal adoption of Briccialdi's thumb key mechanism and a closed-standing G <b>key</b> <b>over</b> an additional G tone hole. Boehm's key system, with minor variations, remains regarded as the most effective system of any modern woodwind, allowing trained instrumentalists to perform with facility and extraordinary velocity and brilliance in all keys.|$|E

40|$|We study {{keys and}} {{functional}} dependencies {{in the context}} of partial relations that permit null values with the interpre-tation no information. Based on Codd’s principle of entity integrity we propose the class of strong <b>keys</b> <b>over</b> partial database relations. These keys enforce both uniqueness and totality of tuples. We study the interaction of strong keys with Lien, Atzeni and Morfuni’s classes of functional depen-dencies and null-free subschemata. For various subclasses we establish axiomatisations, linear-time algorithms to de-cide implication, and characterisations and computations of Armstrong relations. Interestingly, the class of general func-tional dependencies does not enjoy Armstrong relations over partial relations, but even the combined class of strong keys and standard functional dependencies does. We also settle various questions related to the maximal size of a family of non-redundant strong <b>keys</b> <b>over</b> partial relations...|$|R
