Majority of the conversion processes take place at severe conditions of very high temperature and high pressure. Hence, power plant components always exhibit inelastic behaviours like creep and fatigue. The design of such components should take these inelastic behaviours in to consideration. This work focuses on modelling the creep behaviour of superheater materials. Specifically, creep constitutive model of T 91 steel which is commonly used for constructing superheater tubes is developed and validated with results from experimental work.

40|$|A {{key feature}} {{of the growth of}} {{industrial}} society is the acquisition of increasing quantities of resources from the environment and their distribution <b>for</b> <b>end</b> <b>use.</b> With respect to energy, growth has been near exponential for the last 160 years. We attempt to show that the global distribution of resources that underpins this growth may be facilitated by the continual development and expansion of near optimal directed networks. If so, the distribution efficiencies of these networks must decline as they expand due to path lengths becoming longer and more tortuous. To maintain long-term exponential growth the physical limits placed on the distribution networks appear to be counteracted by innovations deployed elsewhere in the system: namely at the points of acquisition and end use. We postulate that the maintenance of growth at the specific rate of ~ 2. 4 % yr− 1 stems from an implicit desire to optimise patterns of energy use over human working lifetimes...|$|E
