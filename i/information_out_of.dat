5|$|The Marshalsea {{became the}} main holding prison for Roman Catholics {{suspected}} of sedition during the Elizabethan era. Bishop Bonner, the last Roman Catholic Bishop of London, was imprisoned there in 1559, supposedly {{for his own}} safety, until his death 10years later. William Herle, a spy for Lord Burghley, Elizabeth I's chief adviser, was held there in 1570 and 1571. According to Robyn Adams, the prison leaked both physically and metaphorically. In correspondence about Marshalsea prisoners Herle suspected of involvement in a plot to kill the Queen, he wrote of a network within the prison for smuggling <b>information</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> it, which included hiding letters in holes in the crumbling brickwork for others to pick up.|$|E
5|$|Following World War I, Mashbir held a {{position}} teaching military science and tactics at Syracuse University, where he first considered studying the Japanese language and culture. In August 1919, {{he asked the}} War Department if he could embark on this course of study, stating {{that it was his}} intention to apply for a posting to Japan for the purpose of learning the language if the War Department saw fit. Ranked captain, Mashbir was assigned as one of four US Army Language Officers in Japan on 7 July 1920. He relocated to Tokyo the following month to begin his four-year tour. When he arrived he reported for duty to Lieutenant Colonel Charles Burnett, the military attaché. Having few Army colleagues, while in Tokyo Mashbir sought the company of other intelligence professionals in the navy, one of whom was an assistant naval attaché, Lieutenant-Commander Ellis M. Zacharias, with whom Mashbir began a lifelong friendship and collaboration. In July 1922, at Zacharias' request, Mashbir secretly worked day and night to produce a secret plan to gather intelligence and get <b>information</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Japan in case of war; it become known as M-Plan, named after Mashbir. His undisclosed activities working for the naval attaché did not sit well with his superiors, however.|$|E

25|$|A common way to {{get more}} {{quantitative}} <b>information</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> a mass spectrum {{is to create a}} standard curve to compare the sample to. This requires knowing what is to be quantitated ahead of time, having a standard available and designing the experiment specifically for this purpose. A more advanced variation on this is the use of an internal standard which behaves very similarly to the analyte. This is often an isotopically labeled version of the analyte. There are forms of mass spectrometry, such as accelerator mass spectrometry that are designed from the bottom up to be quantitative.|$|E

One such improvement was the Integrated Real-time Information into the Cockpit/Real-time <b>Information</b> <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> the Cockpit for Combat Aircraft (IRRCA) project. In 1998 as IRRCA lead test pilot, Brown flew a simulated combat mission to demonstrate the ability to receive real-time mission updates from a satellite and automatically alter the F-117's planned route. The flight also demonstrated reception of text and imagery of the alternate target. Brown encouraged young engineers by presenting lectures such as Braking the F-117 Stealth Fighter given to the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics student chapter at the University of California, San Diego. He continued his education and earned a Master of Science degree in Management from Troy State University in Alabama and completed graduate study in Mechanical Engineering at California State University, Fresno.|$|E

Light tells Ryuk to relinquish his ownership of the Death Note after saying 'get rid of it'. Afterwards, Light loses all memory of the Death Note and he reverts to his normal personality. Without the Death Note, he has cares for {{the people around him}} and is reluctant to manipulate them. He even refuses to 'use' Misa Amane to get <b>information</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> her when L asks him to; however, later in the story, when Light regains his memories, he seems to have no problem 'using' Kiyomi Takada and manipulating her feelings in order to get what he wants. Despite serving Light faithfully, he repays her devotion with a painful death the moment she is no longer of use to him, expressing no emotion other than elation at the fact that her death has moved him closer to his goal.|$|E

At the bog, the pair find a mummified corpse clutching the relic; however, they have been followed by the police, and Watts is arrested for Schlossburg's murder. Black tracks down Andrews at the storage building where the relic has been taken. They are ambushed by the two assassins, and during their escape, Black mentions where the relic is hidden. Andrews immediately turns on Black; the ambush was a trick to draw the <b>information</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Black, while she had engineered events to use Watts as a fall man to discredit the Group. However, the police are able to intervene, hearing everything and rescuing Black. Later, Watts and Black study the relic, but Black is convinced that their own convictions will be more important to them than mystical artefacts.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, back on Earth, {{with their}} members running low on energon and slowly being {{captured}} by Skywatch, tension is high amongst the Autobots. After a rescue raid led by Hot Rod results in Ironhide's death, Optimus Prime gives up {{his position as}} leader and surrenders to Skywatch, causing a schism between the Autobots, who split into two groups: one led by Hot Rod, who, taking the name [...] "Rodimus", joins forces {{with a group of}} Decepticons fronted by Swindle in an effort to build a ship and leave the planet, and a second who elect Bumblebee as their new leader, and are soon joined by Ultra Magnus, who determines to arrest Rodimus for treason. More Autobots, fearing they will be arrested by Magnus, also go AWOL, but most of them are captured by Skywatch and used as a bargaining tool by Spike Witwicky to force <b>information</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Optimus Prime. Thundercracker, having been shot down by Skywarp three years previously, starts to develop admiration for Earth and its inhabitants. Although Bumblebee was elected as Autobot leader, he gets little respect, as Autobots strike out on their own or disrespect his authority. A rogue faction within Skywatch contacts the Autobots and sets up a meeting with Bumblebee to enlist the Autobots' help in capturing Decepticons. Bumblebee agrees and the bots are fitted with special badges to cloak them from the main Skywatch force, but when the Colonel orders the capture of Blurr and resentment ensues, the Autobots learn that the badges also have the ability to immobilize them. Meanwhile, Magnus arrives at Hot Rod's camp and attempts to capture Swindle, but is stopped by Hot Rod. He also fails in trying to get Hot Rod to disassemble the ship his party is building to get off Earth. In the battle that follows, Swindle betrays Rodimus and reveals his new creation, Menasor, but the day is saved thanks to Skywatch, with whom Optimus Prime has brokered an alliance, and some timely side-switching from the disillusioned Thundercracker. The disgraced Rodimus flees Earth alone, and the Autobots rally under Bumblebee.|$|E

[...] Dynamically, players follow the gradient of the potential on pure strategy space, perturbed by a random variable (motivated by the inherent behavior strategy randomness used to justify a classical mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium).

[...] The dynamics are a variation of those that result in a quantal response equilibrium, the difference being instantaneous utility functions are used instead of expected values of utilities to accommodate markets with repeatedly interacting agents.

As opposed to a domain-general cultural acquisition program, where an individual passively receives culturally-transmitted material from the group, Tooby and Cosmides (1989), among others, argue that: [...] "the psyche evolved to generate adaptive rather than repetitive behavior, and hence critically analyzes the behavior of those surrounding it in highly structured and patterned ways, {{to be used as a}} rich (but by no means the only) source of <b>information</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> which to construct a 'private culture' or individually tailored adaptive system; in consequence, this system may or may not mirror the behavior of others in any given respect."
