25|$|As {{a result}} of the removal of the {{external}} keel, when the first trials were held the two airships were able to turn more quickly than their predecessors; but more importantly it was discovered during the lift and trim tests that the <b>disposable</b> <b>lift</b> was more than 8tons. This was significantly better than any previous British airship, and allowed a greater bomb load to be carried as well as more fuel for increased range.|$|E
2500|$|The most drastic of the {{modifications}} was {{the removal}} of the external keel. Hartley Pratt, a draughtsman working in another department at Vickers, calculated that this would be disastrous, but his warnings were ignored. Pratt subsequently left the company, but was re-hired to lead the design of the next British airship, the No. 9r which was ordered from Vickers in 1913. [...] Other changes included deleting the forward elevators and the water recovery apparatus. [...] The positions of the gondolas was also reversed, the heavier forward gondola being moved to the aft position. [...] The changes resulted in the Mayfly having a <b>disposable</b> <b>lift</b> of 3.21 tons.|$|E
2500|$|On 16 November 1916, No. 9r {{left its}} shed and was moored outside for {{tests of the}} {{fittings}} and engines, the first test flight taking place on 27 November 1916. This {{was the first time}} a British rigid airship had flown; however, it was unable to lift the contract weight of 3.1tons. [...] It was therefore lightened by the removal of both rear engines, replacing them with a single engine that had been salvaged from the Zeppelin L 33 which had made a forced landing in Little Wigborough, Essex, on 24 September 1916. [...] New, lighter, gasbags were also fitted. These modifications increased the <b>disposable</b> <b>lift</b> to 3.8tons (3861kg), and it was accepted by the Navy in April 1917.|$|E
5000|$|One last {{development}} of the waverider is the [...] "Hypersonic Sail Waverider," [...] which uses a rogallo wing as the lifting surface. The primary purpose for this design {{is to create a}} light-weight <b>disposable</b> <b>lifting</b> surface for interplanetary spacecraft to use while maneuvering over planets with an atmosphere. If used over Venus for instance, the spacecraft could aeromaneuver with the lift provided by the waverider to a degree that no gravitational slingshot could hope to achieve.|$|R
40|$|Deformation and {{strength}} of the tape lifting devices of various designs {{in the implementation of}} real operating conditions are investigated. Actual tests of slings under static and cyclic loading are conducted, and the effect of overloading on their carrying capacity is determined. Tests of <b>disposable</b> synthetic tape <b>lifting</b> devices under cyclic loading have shown that they can withstand at least 15 cycles of loading-stay under load-unloading at the maximum load that exceeds the allowable operational value in 2 times. The results of static tests indicate that maximum destructive loads exceed the allowable ones in 4, 3 [...] . 4, 5 times. Numerical modeling of deformation of woven synthetic tapes of investigated slings is carried out. The structural models to predict the deformation behavior of twill weaves are applied. These models are developed {{on the basis of the}} biaxial tension theory of woven fabrics. Experimental nonlinear deformation curves of threads and the main structural characteristics of the tapes are used as input parameters of the models. Efficiency of the models is proved by a good correlation between calculated and experimental data. ??????????? ?????????????? ? ????????? ????????? ?????????????? ?????????????? ?????????? ?????????? ??? ??????????????? ???????? ??????? ????????????. ????????? ???????? ????????? ??????? ??? ??????????? ? ??????????? ?????????? ? ?????????? ??????? ????????? ?? ?? ??????? ???????????. ????????? ????????? ????????????? ?????????????? ????????????? ?????? ???? ??????????? ???????. ??? ???? ????????? ??????????? ?????? ?????????????? ???????? ??????, ??????????? ?? ?????? ?????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????? ??????????. ????????????? ??????? ???????????? ??????? ??????????? ????????? ? ????????????????? ??????...|$|R

[...] The hull was cylindrical {{for most of its}} length and was constructed from 17-sided transverse frames with a triangular section keel underneath. [...] Two gondolas were suspended from the keel, the forward one containing the control compartment and two of the engines, the aft containing an emergency control station and the remaining pair of engines.

5000|$|Lord Thomson, the Secretary of State for Air, {{expressed}} {{his interest in}} making a flight to India after travelling as a passenger on the new airship's second flight. However, the R101, as originally built, had insufficient <b>disposable</b> <b>lift</b> to make the flight. Weight-saving measures and efforts to improve lift were initiated and completed in early 1930. R101 made three flights in late June 1930 and, in a report to Scott on 1 July, Irwin expressed concerns over [...] "flapping" [...] of the ship's outer cover, possible malfunctioning of gas valves and [...] "an abundance of holes" [...] in the gas cells due to chafing against girders. In a previous conversation with Squadron Leader Ralph Booth, captain of the R100, on 27 June, Irwin had expressed the opinion that [...] "most of the losses were from the gas valves", due to [...] "excessive pulsing and flapping" [...] of the envelope fabric.|$|E

5000|$|While {{the initial}} flight trials were being carried out, the design team {{examined}} the lift problem. Studies identified possible weight savings of 3.16 tons. The weight-saving measures included deleting {{twelve of the}} double-berth cabins, removing the reefing booms from the nose to frame 1 and between frames 13 to 15 at the tail, replacing the glass windows of the observation decks with Cellon, removing two water ballast tanks, and removing the servo mechanism for the rudder and elevators. [...] Letting the gasbags out would gain 3.18 tons extra lift, although Michael Rope considered this unwise, [...] since {{there were thousands of}} exposed fixings protruding from the girders; chafing of the gasbags would have to be prevented by wrapping these in strips of cloth. To further increase lift, an extra bay of [...] capacity could be installed. This would deliver an extra nine tons <b>disposable</b> <b>lift.</b> After much consultation, all these proposed measures were approved in December. Letting out the gasbags and the weight-saving measures were begun. Delivery by Boulton Paul of the metalwork for the extra bay was expected to take place in June.|$|E
