We study how two changes in Swedish inheritance taxation 2003 / 04 and 2004 / 05 have affected mortality during the turns of the years. Our first main result is that deceased with estates taxable for legal heirs were 10 percentage points {{more likely to have}} died on New Year' Day 2005, from when the inheritance tax was repealed, rather than on New Year's Eve 2004, compared to deceased without taxable estates for legal heirs. The second main result is that deceased with estates taxable for a married spouse were 12 percentage points more likely to have died on New Year's Day 2004, from when the <b>inheritance</b> tax <b>between</b> <b>spouses</b> was repealed, rather than on New Year's Eve 2003, compared to deceased without taxable estates for a married spouse...|$|R

40|$|Marriage is a {{fundamental}} institution with implications for economic and social development. The age difference <b>between</b> <b>spouses</b> reflects social relations across time and space. It has decreased with modernization, presumably because marriage for sentimental, rather than instrumental, reasons has become widespread. This study investigates age differences <b>between</b> <b>spouses</b> and how they changed {{at the time of}} the industrial revolution in Sweden. We analyze spatial differences in age homogamy by linking them to indicators of industrialization and modernization at the individual and community level. We use full- count census data of about 600, 000 couples in 1880 - 1900. The results show socioeconomic and spatial differences between different measures of age homogamy, but do not support a link between cultural change and change in age homogamy. Instead they are more consistent with explanations focusing on how industrialization and urbanization relaxed the old Malthusian marriage pattern, weakening the link between property and wealth, and, by extension, that to marriage and smaller age differences <b>between</b> <b>spouses.</b> </div...|$|R
