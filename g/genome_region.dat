The complementary sequences to two neighboring microsatellites are used as PCR primers; the variable region between them gets amplified.

Researchers found that genes that code for MHC affect the ability of certain species, such as Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, to resist certain infections because the MHC has a mediating effect on {{the interaction between the}} body’s immune cells with other body cells. Measuring polymorphism at these genes can serve as an indirect measure of a population's immunological fitness.

This analysis verifies that eighteen different genome regions are predisposed to insulin-dependent (type I) diabetes mellitus(IDDM). There are 18 different symbols of <b>genome</b> <b>region,</b> which is labeled from IDDM1 to IDDM18. The MHC HLA gene (IDDM1) and the insulin gene INS (IDDM2) are the major genetic candidates in the development of insulin-dependent (type I) diabetes mellitus(IDDM) , which are located on the chromosome 6p21.3 and chromosome 11p15 respectively. IDDM3, IDDM4, IDDM5 IDDM7 reside in chromosome 15q26, chromosome 11q13, chromosome 6q25 and 2q31 respectively.IDDM11 (insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 11) is one of the susceptibility genes for IDDM which locates on chromosome 14q24.3-q31. This loci is identified by linkage to D14S67 marker via a sibling-pair {{linkage analysis}} Based on the previous study, the biological behavior of IDDM11is different to HLA region genes so that IDDM11 is less predisposing to HLA. Moreover, IDDM11 has more involvement on the families that are less predisposing to HLA, while IDDM11 has less involvement on the families that are more predisposing to HLA. The rest of susceptibility genes locus in insulin-dependent (type I) diabetes mellitus (IDDM)are shown in table 1. Table 1 The locus for susceptibility genes for IDDM.|$|E

All strains were mosaic recombinants and only the VP 2 –VP 3 –VP 1 <b>genome</b> <b>region</b> {{was similar to that}} of the corresponding prototype HEV-B strains. In seven of the eight strains studied, the 2 C– 3 D <b>genome</b> <b>region</b> was most similar to the prototype E 30, EV 74 and EV 75 strains, whilst the remaining strain wasmost similar to the prototype E 1 and E 9 strains in the non-structural protein <b>genome</b> <b>region.</b> Most viruses also bore marks of additional recombination events in this part of the genome. In the 59 non-translated region, all strains were more similar to the prototype E 9 than to other enteroviruses. In most cases, recombination mapped to the VP 4 and 2 ABC genome regions. This, together with the star-like topology of the phylogenetic trees for these genome regions, identified these genome parts as recombination hot spots. These findings further support the concept of independent evolution of enterovirus genome fragments and indicate a requirement for more advanced typing approaches.

40|$|SummaryThe {{self-incompatibility}} (S-) locus {{region of}} {{plants in the}} Brassica family is a small <b>genome</b> <b>region.</b> In Arabidopsis lyrata, the S-genes, SRK and SCR, encode the functional female and pollen recognition proteins, which must be coadapted to maintain correct associations between the two component genes, and thus self-incompatibility (SI). Recombinants would be self-compatible and thus probably disadvantageous in self-incompatible species [1, 2]. Therefore, tight linkage between the two genes in incompatibility systems is predicted to evolve to avoid producing such recombinant haplotypes [3]. The evolution of low recombination in S-locus regions has not been rigorously tested. To test whether these regions’ per-nucleotide recombination rates differ from those elsewhere in the genome, and to investigate whether the A. lyrata S-loci have the predicted effect on diversity in their immediate <b>genome</b> <b>region,</b> we studied diversity in genes that {{are linked to the}} S-loci but are not involved in incompatibility [4] and are not under balancing selection. Compared with other A. lyrata loci, genes linked to the S-loci have extraordinarily high polymorphism. Our estimated recombination in this region, from fitting a model of the effects of S-allele polymorphism on linked neutral sites, supports the hypothesis of locally suppressed recombination around the S-locus...|$|E

The SLCV IRES was highly {{similar to that of}} TMEV, but motifs critical in TMEV for binding of the polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB) were disrupted.

40|$|We {{explored}} {{the potential of}} pooled sequencing to swiftly and economically identify selective sweeps due to emerging artemisinin (ART) resistance in a South-East Asian malaria parasite population. ART resistance is defined by slow parasite clearance from the blood of ART-treated patients and mutations in the kelch gene (chr. 13) have been strongly implicated to play a role. We constructed triplicate pools of 70 slow-clearing (resistant) and 70 fast-clearing (sensitive) infections collected from the Thai-Myanmar border and sequenced these to high (~ 150 -fold) read depth. Allele frequency estimates from pools showed almost perfect correlation (Lin's concordance = 0. 98) with allele frequencies at 93 SNPs measured directly from individual infections, giving us confidence in the accuracy of this approach. By mapping genome-wide divergence (FST) between pools of drug resistant and drug sensitive parasites we identified two large (> 150 kb) regions (on chrs. 13 and 14) and 17 smaller candidate <b>genome</b> <b>regions.</b> To identify individual genes within these <b>genome</b> <b>regions</b> we re-sequenced an additional 38 parasite genomes (16 slow and 22 fast-clearing) and performed rare variant association tests. These confirmed kelch as a major molecular marker for ART resistance (p= 6. 03 × 10 (- 6)). This two-tier approach is powerful because pooled sequencing rapidly narrows down <b>genome</b> <b>regions</b> of interest, while targeted rare variant association testing within these regions can pinpoint the genetic basis of resistance.
