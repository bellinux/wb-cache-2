5|$|Since Smyth {{still had}} his {{commitments}} at Princeton and Chicago, he could only work on the report part-time. He wrote the report <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>office</b> <b>in</b> Princeton's Palmer Laboratory. Bars were installed on the windows of Smyth's office and the one adjacent to it. The hallway door to his office was locked and blocked by a large safe so that the only access was through the adjacent office, where there was an armed guard. The guards worked in eight-hour shifts, and one was present around the clock. When Smyth sent papers to Groves in Washington, D.C., they went by military courier.|$|E

5|$|Smyth {{advocated}} {{within the}} NDRC {{for a comprehensive}} report to be {{released to the public}} following the weapon's first use. Vannevar Bush, who as civilian director of the OSRD oversaw the NDRC, agreed, and selected Smyth to write the report following the recommendation of NDRC chairman James Bryant Conant. Groves granted Smyth unlimited access, waiving his usual security-minded insistence on compartmentalization. Smyth wrote {{what became known as the}} Smyth Report <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>office</b> <b>in</b> Princeton's Palmer Laboratory, which later became the Frist Campus Center.|$|E
5|$|The AFL became {{involved}} in politics when seventeen soldiers launched a coup on April 12, 1980. The group {{was made up of}} Master Sergeant Samuel Doe, two staff sergeants, four sergeants, eight corporals, and two privates. They found President Tolbert sleeping <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>office</b> <b>in</b> the Executive Mansion and there they killed him. While then-Sergeant Thomas Quiwonkpa led the plotters, it was the group led by Samuel Doe that found Tolbert in his office, and it was Doe, as a master sergeant the highest ranking of the group, who went on the radio the next day to announce the overthrow of the long-entrenched True Whig Party government.|$|E
5|$|Kanye West {{began working}} on Graduation {{immediately}} after releasing his second studio album Late Registration. By late September 2005, West had already completed three songs for the album, which he intended to contain a total of twelve tracks. Around {{the time of the}} recording of the third studio album, West would often listen to songs written by folk and country singer-songwriters Bob Dylan and Johnny Cash in hopes of developing methods to augment his word play and storytelling abilities. The former musician had been recommended to West by multiple of his friends, including English disc jockey Samantha Ronson, all of whom claimed his music and the way he dealt with the press reminded them of Dylan. Kanye also listened to his most favorite alternative rock bands, including The Killers, Radiohead, Modest Mouse, and Keane, in order to gain new ideas on how to make his hip-hop production style more stadium-friendly. Additionally, West would often test his new songs on his iPod, <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>office,</b> <b>in</b> dance clubs and just about anywhere people might listen to his music. He would then make adjustments to the tracks based on feedback he received, repeating the process as many times as necessary.|$|E

5|$|Throughout {{his career}} in England, Ollivierre played as an amateur cricketer. He was {{employed}} by Samuel Hill-Wood, a businessman and politician from Derbyshire, to work <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>office</b> <b>in</b> Glossop, where Ollivierre lived. During the 1901 season, he played three first-class games for Derbyshire in non-Championship games: twice against London County Cricket Club and once against the touring South African cricket team, hitting two half-centuries {{in the process of}} scoring 247 runs at an average of 41.16. After further appearances in 1902, while waiting to qualify, against London County and the Australian touring team, he became eligible for county matches in July and made his Championship debut against Essex. Later in 1902, he scored 167 against Warwickshire, his maiden first-class century. In all first-class matches in the season, Ollivierre scored 524 runs at 34.93. The following season, Ollivierre played in 19 games and scored 721 runs, but his average fell to 20.60.|$|E

50|$|A {{number of}} {{prominent}} Irish architects received their early training <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>offices.</b> <b>In</b> the 1830s, {{it is thought}} that James Joseph McCarthy (1817-1882), architect of among other works the Roman Catholic St. Macartan’s Cathedral, Monaghan (1861-1892), apprenticed at Farrell’s office. Other apprentices included Sinclair Bates in 1809, John Louch in 1813, Parke Neville, and Sandham Symes.|$|R

25|$|The {{most famous}} Persian carpet is the Ardabil Carpet, in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, {{which in fact}} is now a {{combination}} of two original carpets, with another piece from the second in Los Angeles.

25|$|In general May {{focused his}} {{collection}} in three areas, German Expressionism, Mesoamerica, and the indigenous arts of various cultures around the globe, including primarily art from Oceania, Africa, and other Pre-Columbian art {{that was not}} specifically from Mesoamerica. In these areas his goal was comprehensiveness. Because he bought so extensively, he sometimes made mistakes, which he famously laughed off, making no effort to conceal them. He even displayed them <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>office</b> <b>in</b> the Railway Exchange Building along with his fishing trophies and family photographs.|$|E
25|$|Carroll was {{invested}} <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>office</b> <b>in</b> Maryland {{upon his}} return from another trans-Atlantic sail voyage. This {{took place at the}} parish of St. Thomas Manor in Charles County, Maryland. When he returned to Baltimore, he took his chair in the Church of St. Peter, which would serve as his pro-cathedral. St. Peter's was the first Catholic parish in Baltimore Town in 1770 and was located at the northwestern corner of North Charles and West Saratoga streets. It had an attached rectory and school, and was surrounded by a cemetery.|$|E

Shortly after Schneerson's death, the executors of his will {{discovered}} several notebooks in a drawer <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>office,</b> <b>in</b> which Schneerson had written his scholarly thoughts and religious musings from his earliest years. The majority of entries in these journals date between the years 1928 and 1950 and were subsequently published.|$|E
25|$|John Redmond's {{home town}} of Wexford {{remained}} a strongly Redmondite area for decades afterwards. The seat of Waterford city {{was one of the}} few outside Ulster not to be won by Sinn Féin in the 1918 general election. Redmond's son William Redmond represented the City until his death in 1932. A later Irish Taoiseach (prime minister), John Bruton, hung a painting of Redmond, whom he regarded as his hero because of his commitment to non-violence in Ireland, <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>office</b> <b>in</b> Ireland's Leinster House Government Buildings. However, his successor Bertie Ahern replaced the painting with one of Patrick Pearse.|$|E
500|$|The first Medals of Honor (Army) {{were awarded}} by and {{presented}} to six [...] "Andrews Raiders" [...] on March 25, 1863, by Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>office</b> <b>in</b> the War Department. Private Jacob Parrott, a Union Army volunteer from Ohio, {{became the first}} recipient of the medal, awarded for his volunteering for and participation in a raid on a Confederate train in Big Shanty, Georgia on April 12, 1862 during the American Civil War.

500|$|Bret and Jemaine go to a band {{meeting with}} their manager Murray (Rhys Darby) <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>office</b> <b>in</b> the New Zealand Consulate.

Bret suggests they film a music video. However, unable to afford real video equipment and robot costumes like Daft Punk, {{they are forced to}} rely on a camera phone and disappointing cardboard costumes made by Murray. Regardless, they manage to film a video for [...] "Robots".|$|E
500|$|The force's crest emerged around 1876 {{and became}} {{commonly}} {{used by the}} late 1890s. It comprised a buffalo or bison head, maples leaves, a crown – early on, the St Edward's crown, after 1903, the Tudor crown – and the police's motto. The motto originally ran [...] "Maintien le Droit", meaning [...] "to maintain the right", but after 1915 was altered to read [...] "Maintiens le Droit". Despite being a French phrase, this was a 14th-century English motto, first used in Canada by the Grand Trunk Railway Regiment, and it remains unclear why it {{was adopted by the}} mounted police. There are several explanations {{for the use of the}} buffalo head: it may have been due to Inspector James Macleod's use of a buffalo head <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>office</b> <b>in</b> the mid-1870s, or may have been a prairie adaption of the Macleod clan's bull crest.|$|E

50|$|In {{response}} to public animosity towards King Richard's closest associates, Henry IV deprived Edward of <b>his</b> <b>office</b> of Constable of the Tower on 31 August 1399, {{shortly after his}} accession. On 20 October 1399, he was imprisoned at Windsor Castle, and on 3 November deprived of the dukedom of Aumale, but not his other titles. Edward's period of disfavour was not long-lasting, however. The king confirmed him <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>offices</b> <b>in</b> connection with the Channel Islands and the Isle of Wight, and by 4 December 1399 had made him {{a member of his}} council.|$|R
