The OTG device with the B-plug <b>inserted</b> is called the B-device and by default assumes the role of peripheral. An OTG device with no plug <b>inserted</b> defaults to acting as a B-device. If an application on the B-device requires the role of host, then the Host Negotiation Protocol (HNP) is used to temporarily transfer the host role to the B-device.|$|E
5|$|The {{conformational}} {{mobility of}} serpins provides a key advantage over static lock-and-key protease inhibitors. In particular, {{the function of}} inhibitory serpins can be regulated by allosteric interactions with specific cofactors. The X-ray crystal structures of antithrombin, heparin cofactor II, MENT and murine antichymotrypsin reveal that these serpins adopt a conformation wherein the first two amino acids of the RCL are <b>inserted</b> {{into the top of}} the A β-sheet. The partially <b>inserted</b> conformation is important because co-factors are able to conformationally switch certain partially <b>inserted</b> serpins into a fully expelled form. This conformational rearrangement makes the serpin a more effective inhibitor.|$|E

The <b>insert</b> fell into two size categories: small ( 0. 6 kb) accompanied by methylation of an EagI site. All individuals of either sex having a small <b>insert</b> were fra(X) negative and intellectually normal, while all males having a large <b>insert</b> were fra(X) positive and intellectually impaired. Females having a large <b>insert</b> were either fra(X) {{positive or negative}} and either intellectually normal or impaired. No new mutation was found. All daughters of males with a small <b>insert</b> had a small insert; females with a large <b>insert</b> produced males and females who had a large <b>insert,</b> while females with a small <b>insert</b> had offspring with either a large or a small <b>insert.</b> However, females with a small <b>insert</b> tended to {{fall into one of}} two categories: either they had only children with a small <b>insert</b> or only children with a large <b>insert,</b> there being only one exception to this rule.

40|$|Purpose - The aim of {{this study}} is to {{demonstrate}} the benefit of design flexibility afforded by the Arcam free-form fabrication process in the direct manufacture of injection mould <b>inserts</b> with complex cooling channel configurations and the process efficiency and quality gains achieved through using such <b>inserts.</b> Design/methodology/approach - The manufacturing process of a flood cooled injection mould <b>insert</b> using the Arcam EBM S 12 layered manufacturing process is presented. The <b>insert</b> is then evaluated against two other <b>inserts</b> (one un-cooled and one traditionally baffle cooled (BC)) in the manufacture of test components, with the temperature of the <b>insert</b> and components recorded. The process conditions were adjusted (reduced cooling time) to increase the core and component temperatures to identify the operational limits of the <b>inserts.</b> Thermal imaging was employed to visualize the thermal distribution within the BC and flood cooled (FC) <b>inserts.</b> Findings - The cooling efficiency of the FC <b>insert</b> was found to be significantly higher than that of the other two <b>inserts,</b> and the homogeneity of the heat distribution of the FC <b>insert</b> was more even than the BC <b>insert.</b> It was possible to manufacture non-deformed components using the FC <b>insert</b> with zero cooling time (ejection immediately after removal of holding pressure), this was not possible with the BC <b>insert.</b> Research limitations/implications - Provides a basis for the development of more efficient and thermally homogeneous <b>inserts</b> through the Arcam EBM process. Practical implications - Provides a technology/process for the manufacture of highly efficient core <b>inserts</b> for injection moulding, offering the industry a competitive advantage through the potential for time and cost savings and higher quality components. Originality/value - This is the first direct comparison of an Arcam EBM manufactured <b>insert</b> with complex cooling geometries against traditionally cooled <b>inserts,</b> particularly novel is the thermal imaging analysis of the cooling efficiency and distribution...|$|R

50|$|Externally {{threaded}} <b>inserts</b> have threads on {{the outside}} and inside of the <b>insert.</b> The <b>insert</b> is threaded into a pre-tapped hole, or some <b>inserts</b> tap their own threads in a drilled or molded hole.

A thin walled solid bushing <b>insert</b> by the trademarked name TIME-SERT is locked in by rolling the bottom few internal thread into the base material with a special install driver which will permanently lock the <b>insert</b> in place. Key locking <b>inserts,</b> more commonly known by the trademarked name Keenserts, use keys that are hammered into grooves through the threads, permanently locking the <b>insert.</b> <b>Inserts</b> that are self-tapping and lock via friction are more commonly known by the trademarked names Tap-lok or Speedserts.|$|R
