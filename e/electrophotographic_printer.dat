40|$|When time, {{temperature}} or an external environment change, a laser <b>electrophotographic</b> <b>printer</b> produces quite different color tones from original ones. To achieve consistent color reproduction, many researchers {{have tried to}} characterize printer tone curves and developed methods to correct color tones. Color channel independent meth-ods are most widely used, {{and there are two}} approaches in color channel independent method: (1) Instrument-based correction and (2) visual correction. Two approaches provide some trade-offs between cost and accuracy. In this paper we propose a methodology which combines the strengths of these two approaches. We describe how we design a calibration page and how we characterize lightness variation of a reference patch. We then present the procedure of our global tone correction method based on visual appearance match of end-users as well as the predetermined reference lightness model. We simulate tone distortion state by varying hardware parameters, and perform visual appearance match experiments to subjects. Our experimental results show that our method can significantly reduce color difference between the original print and the print at the distortion state. This suggests that we can reliably estimate the distortion parameter, and correct tones close to an original state...|$|E

In offices, data coloration has started and the arrival of color printers with high image quality is keenly awaited. As one possible solution, there is the tandem-type color <b>electrophotographic</b> <b>printer</b> which uses LED printheads. Comparing this LED tandem printer to a normal laser scanner type printer, the former needs no rotary mechanism, such as a polygon mirror, so it can be smaller and operate faster. However, to achieve color printers with even faster speeds and even better image quality, LED printheads are required which have higher light output and higher resolution. In addition, because tandem-type color LED printers require four printheads, there is a demand for “low cost LED printheads. ” In response to this need, we have found a solution by developing a new LED printhead. It incorporates [a] a new type of LED array 1, 2) which has a luminescent element characterized by high light output and high density and [b] a matrixshaped multi-layer wiring configuration.

40|$|Digital halftoning is a {{printing}} technology {{that creates the}} illusion of continuous tone images for printing devices such as electrophotographic printers that can only produce {{a limited number of}} tone levels. Digital halftoning works because the human visual system has limited spatial resolution which blurs the printed dots of the halftone image, creating the gray sensation of a continuous tone image. Because the printing process is imperfect it introduces distortions to the halftone image. The quality of the printed image depends, among other factors, on the complex interactions between the halftone image, the printer characteristics, the colorant, and the printing substrate. Printer models are used to assist in the development of new types of halftone algorithms that are designed to withstand the effects of printer distortions. For example, model-based halftone algorithms optimize the halftone image through an iterative process that integrates a printer model within the algorithm. The two main goals of a printer model are to provide accurate estimates of the tone and of the spatial characteristics of the printed halftone pattern. Various classes of printer models, from simple tone calibrations, to complex mechanistic models, {{have been reported in the}} literature. Existing models have one or more of the following limiting factors: they only predict tone reproduction, they depend on the halftone pattern, they require complex calibrations or complex calculations, they are printer specific, they reproduce unrealistic dot structures, and they are unable to adapt responses to new data. The two research objectives of this dissertation are (1) to introduce a new framework for printer modeling and (2) to demonstrate the feasibility of such a framework in building an <b>electrophotographic</b> <b>printer</b> model. The proposed framework introduces the concept of modeling a printer as a texture transformation machine. The basic premise is that modeling the texture differences between the output printed images and the input images encompasses all printing distortions. The feasibility of the framework was tested with a case study modeling a monotone <b>electrophotographic</b> <b>printer.</b> The printer model was implemented as a bank of feed-forward neural networks, each one specialized in modeling a group of textural features of the printed halftone pattern. The textural features were obtained using a parametric representation of texture developed from a multiresolution decomposition proposed by other researchers. The textural properties of halftone patterns were analyzed and the key texture parameters to be modeled by the bank were identified. Guidelines for the multiresolution texture decomposition and the model operational parameters and operational limits were established. A method for the selection of training sets based on the morphological properties of the halftone patterns was also developed. The model is fast and has the capability to continue to learn with additional training. The model can be easily implemented because it only requires a calibrated scanner. The model was tested with halftone patterns representing a range of spatial characteristics found in halftoning. Results show that the model provides accurate predictions for the tone and the spatial characteristics when modeling halftone patterns individually and it provides close approximations when modeling multiple halftone patterns simultaneously. The success of the model justifies continued research of this new printer model framework...|$|E
40|$|Watermarking is a {{technique}} used to authenticate and distinguish original documents or images from the copied or forged ones. Many watermarking methods have been developed and are being used for printed documents and images. Though these current watermarking techniques can distinguish between original and forged documents, {{it is not possible}} to identify the source of the forged and counterfeit documents, knowledge of which is required in some cases to stop future forgeries. In this thesis we propose a machine readable watermarking technique for images, halftoned using clustered-dot halftoning technique and printed on <b>electrophotographic</b> <b>printer,</b> that can, not only identify forged documents and images, but also provide information about the printer used and date on which the document was printed. First, we propose a method of embedding data in the image by shifting clustered-dot pair diagonally and horizontally. The range of gray level values within which data can be embedded, number of pixels by which dots should be shifted and location of shifted dots is decided based on experiments carried out. Next, we propose a method for detecting data from the scanned image. Scanned image is preprocessed using various image processing algorithms and techniques before detection stage. The detection of embedded data is done from the knowledge of the centroids of each clustered-dot. Error control coding technique is also proposed to improve the accuracy of detection process. Lastly we propose an embedding method using pulse width modulation to reduce the visual distortions in the image caused by embedding the data...|$|E
40|$|Two {{different}} {{topics are}} discussed in in this dissertation. The first topic is an efficient flicker reduction method in a single camera captured image. The second topic is a smart diagnostic scheme to detect mechanical motion errors of the multifunctional printer. ^ The flicker artifact dealt with in this paper is the scan distortion arising when an image is captured by a digital camera using a CMOS imaging sensor with an electronic rolling shutter under strong ambient light sources powered by AC. This type of camera scans a target line-by-line in a frame. Therefore, time differences exist between the lines. This mechanism distorts a captured image due to the change of illumination. This phenomenon is called the flicker artifact. The non-content area of the captured image is used to estimate a flicker signal that {{is a key to}} being able to compensate the flicker artifact. We have developed two different methods to estimate the flicker signal and a measurement method to indicate the strength of the flicker artifact. The measurement is used {{to determine whether or not}} flicker suppression needs to be applied to a particular image, and to evaluate the efficiency of our flicker suppression methods. The flicker-reduced images compensated by our methods clearly demonstrate the reduced flicker artifact, based on both visual observation and our numerical measurement. ^ The multifunctional printer(MFP) mentioned in this paper is a device combining the <b>electrophotographic</b> <b>printer,</b> scanner, and copier. Using this smart multifunctionality of the device, we can diagnose the problem of the device by novel techniques used in the image processing and computer vision areas. Our goal is to help customers be able to diagnose their devices as developing automated diagnostic system embedded in products. Among a number of problems customers may encounter, the problems caused by the MFP products 2 ̆ 7 irregular motions are dealt with in this paper. There are several sources cause the motion error in the printing and scanning mechanism such as vibrations in the optical photoconductor(OPC) drum, scanner head, stepper motor, and gear train. The motion errors arising due to the vibrations of the multiple sources are measured by the novel design of our test page. The measured data is observed in the spatial domain to detect the aperiodic motion error as well as in the frequency domain to find out the dominant periodic motion errors. In addition, the measured data is statistically analyzed using a simple trick in order to distinguish the mixed motion errors coming from the printing part and scanning part. Our result briefly expresses the estimated portions of the motion errors between the two parts. Finally, the results are dedicated to diagnose the malfunction of the MFP products. ...|$|E

The feedback controller regulates the motor velocity to reduce the effect of disturbances and system sensitivity on the intermediate transfer belt, and the feedforward controller modulates the laser intensity to compensate for the reflectance variation associated with the disturbances on the photoconductive drum.

40|$|Uniformity {{is one of}} {{the issues}} of most {{critical}} concern for laser electrophotographic (EP) printers. Typical non-uniformity defects include mottle, grain, pinholes, and finger prints. Among these defects, mottle (low spatial frequency) and grain (high spatial frequency) are the most commonly observed. In order to assess Print Quality (PQ), we propose a novel method that uses a block-based technique to analyze the test page both visually and metrically. With a print-to-scan method, we use a grid of 150 pixels x 150 pixels (1 / 4 inch x 1 / 4 inch scanned at 600 dpi) square blocks throughout the scanned page. For each block, we examine two aspects: behavior of its pixels within the block (metric of graininess) and behavior of the blocks within the printed page (metric of uniformity). For an input scanned page, we create eight visual outputs, each displaying a different aspect of uniformity by using various pseudo color codings. ^ We next introduce a set of tools for machine learning in the assessment of printed page uniformity. This work is primarily targeted to the printing industry, specifically the ubiquitous laser, <b>electrophotographic</b> <b>printer.</b> We use selected features that are well-correlated with the rankings of expert observers to develop a novel machine learning framework that allows one to achieve the minimum 2 ̆ 2 false alarm 2 ̆ 2 rate, subject to a chosen 2 ̆ 2 miss 2 ̆ 2 rate. The features are collected from the previous eight models. A 2 ̆ 2 miss 2 ̆ 2 is defined to be a page that is not of acceptable quality to an expert observer that the prediction algorithm declares to be a 2 ̆ 2 pass 2 ̆ 2. Misses are a serious problem, since they represent problems that will not be seen by the systems designers. On the other hand, 2 ̆ 2 false alarms 2 ̆ 2 correspond to pages that an expert observer would declare to be of acceptable quality, but which are flagged by the prediction algorithm as 2 ̆ 2 fails 2 ̆ 2. In a typical printer testing and development scenario, such pages would be examined by an expert, and found to be of acceptable quality after all. 2 ̆ 2 False alarm 2 ̆ 2 pages result in extra pages to be examined by expert observers, which increases labor cost. But 2 ̆ 2 false alarms 2 ̆ 2 are not nearly as catastrophic as 2 ̆ 2 misses 2 ̆ 2, which represent potentially serious problems that are never seen by the systems developers. This scenario motivates us to develop a machine learning framework that will achieve the minimum 2 ̆ 2 false alarm 2 ̆ 2 rate subject to a specified 2 ̆ 2 miss 2 ̆ 2 rate. In order to construct such a set of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, we conduct an exhaustive search over the space of the nonlinear discriminants of the Cost-Sentitive Support Vector Machine (SVM) framework. Our work shows promise for applying a standard framework to obtain a full ROC curve when it comes to tackling other machine learning problems. ...|$|E
40|$|The current {{dissertation}} aims {{to discuss}} three research topics {{within the field}} of print quality defect. The first topic concerns a new psychophysical experiment to investigate the visibility of fine pitch halftone banding, and the second topic introduces web-based print quality troubleshooting tools for printer users to self-solve print quality issues of their HP printers. The third topic, which constitutes the main part of this dissertation, is pertinent to assessment of the presence of isolated large pitch periodic and aperiodic bands in laser <b>Electrophotographic</b> <b>printer</b> output. In addition, to improve the robustness and efficiency, two updated methods for estimating the repetitive interval for periodic bands are discussed. ^ Observing and evaluating print defects represents a major challenge in the area of print quality research. Visual identification and quantification of these print defects have become a key issue for improving print quality. However, the page content may confound the visual evaluation of print defects in actual printouts. To address this important issue, Chapter 1 of the present research is focused on the banding in the presence of print content in the context of commercial printing. In this chapter, a psychophysical experiment is described to evaluate the perception of the bands in the presence of print content. A number of banding defects are added through simulation to a selected set of commercial print contents to form our set of stimuli. The participants in the experiment mark these stimuli based on their observations via a graphical user interface (GUI). Based on the collection of the marked stimuli, our research demonstrates general consistency among different participants. Moreover, the results show that the likelihood of an observer perceiving the banding defect in a smooth area is much higher than in a high frequency area. Furthermore, our results indicate that the luminance of the image may locally affect the visibility of the print defects to a certain degree. In the end of this chapter, we introduce a data analysis method that, for each stimulus, a banding severity level map is generated, which summarizes the banding severity evaluation across all subjects. ^ To improve printer user’s experience and lower customer service cost, web-based print quality troubleshooting (PQTS) tools are developed and introduced in Chapter 2. With detailed instructions in the tool, printer user would be able to diagnostic print quality issues. The easy-to-understand information of most likely causes and troubleshooting suggestions are provided, with pictured step-by-step procedures. Statistics show that our PQTS tools would generate thousands of hits per month. ^ Laser electrophotographic printers are complex systems with many rotating components that are used to advance the media and facilitate the charging, exposure, development, transfer, fusing and cleaning steps. Irregularities that are constant along the axial direction of a roller or drum, which are localized in circumference, can give rise to distinct isolated bands in the output print that are constant in the scan direction. In some occasions, this may be observed to repeat at an interval in the process direction that corresponds to the circumference of the roller or drum responsible for the artifact. In Chapter 3, an image processing and analysis pipeline is designed, which can effectively identify the presence of isolated periodic and aperiodic bands in the output from laser electrophotographic printers. The algorithms that comprise the image processing and analysis pipeline are discussed in detail, and the efficacy and robustness of the pipeline are illustrated with example results. Then, this chapter is concluded with elaboration on the design of a viewing tool which makes it easier for researchers to understand the results. Since the data are corrupted by the presence of aperiodic bands, missing periodic bands and noise, it is necessary to improve the accuracy and robustness for estimating the repetitive interval. A new algorithm based on cost function is designed and discussed in Chapter 4. The effectiveness of this method is illustrated with example results. Lastly, in Chapter 5, a probabilistic model-based method for estimating the repetitive interval is designed and discussed to conclude this research topic. In this chapter, a probabilistic model is designed in detail, and the estimation is examined using simulated data to prove the accuracy and robustness. ...|$|E

40|$|Periodic {{clustered-dot}} screens {{are widely}} used for <b>electrophotographic</b> <b>printers</b> due to their print stability. Typically there are four-colorant color printing: cyan (C), magenta (M), yellow (Y), and black (K). Moreover, with the occurence of high fidelity color printing, one or more additional primary colorants, such as orange and violet, are needed to extend the gamut of printer. Nevertheless, when applied to color printing, superpositions of periodic screens may cause objectionable moire patterns. It is much harder to be solved while more and more colorant planes are superposed. ^ Meanwhile, halftone designers also need to consider “print symmetry” (visual equality). In other words, in each colorant plane, we want the clustered dots as round as possible, in order to render more details equally in different directions, and for entire color screen set, we want the screen frequency of each colorant as close as possible. In this dissertation, we proposed a new color screen set which solves the moire problem and also gives the consideration to print symmetry issue. ...|$|R
40|$|Error-diffusion {{is widely}} used to {{generate}} intensity levels between the primary levels of multi-level colour printing devices (ink-jet <b>printers,</b> <b>electrophotographic</b> <b>printers).</b> Standard error-diffusion algorithms produce structure artifacts at rational intensity levels such as 1 / 3, 1 / 2 and 2 / 3. The boundary between structure artifacts breaks the visual continuity in regions of low intensity gradients and generates undesirable false contours. These undesirable structure artifacts are also visible when error-diffusion is used to generate intermediate intensity levels between primary levels. In this contribution, we propose to remove these structure artifacts by introducing small discontinuities in the tone correction curve, thereby avoiding reproducing the intensity levels responsible for the generation of structure artifacts. The method can not be applied to bilevel printing, since the forbidden intensity regions responsible for the structure artifacts would be too large. In multi-level colour printing however, the forbidden intensity regions are small enough and do not produce any visible intensity breaks in varying intensity wedges...|$|R

The feasibility and effectiveness of incorporating the proposed spatial-based Wiener printer model into the framework of model-based digital halftoning is also investigated. The Wiener model comprises a two-dimensional FIR filter followed by a nonlinear static mapping. The nonlinear static mapping is synthesized based on a fuzzy neural network to account for the tone distortion commonly observed in a printing system. A set of systematic steps for parametric identification/optimization and evaluation of the Wiener printer model is proposed. Experimental results as well as a comparative study show that the Wiener model-based halftoning approach is superior (in terms of image quality) to conventional ones and comparable to the one utilizing a comprehensive printer model. Another comparative study reveals that the Wiener printer model, though computationally less efficient than the conventional dot-overlap model, consumes significantly less time to process an image than the comprehensive printer model does.

The amount of diffusion of the image intensity resulting from applying the filter is governed by an estimate of the gradient that is robust under halftone noise.

Also, it may be desirable to embed additional information in the printed document, such as the date and time that it was printed. In previous work with laser elec-trophotographic printers, we developed strategies to reduce quasiperiodic banding artifacts that are characteristic of the specific print mechanism. The dominant process-direction spatial frequencies associated with these artifacts are deter-mined by the parameters of the gear train in the print mecha-nism.

It {{is useful to}} predict amount of the paper curl in electrophotographic process for the efficient products development. The fusing process which is a sub-process of electrophotography {{is one of the}} causes of the paper curl. But it had been unclear how the paper curl was generated in the fusing process. In a previous study, a paper curl mechanism based on temperature gradient in paper heating was revealed. The mechanism shows that a temperature gradient causes moisture transfer from the high-temperature side to the low-temperature side within paper and consequently the moisture content of the low-temperature side becomes higher than that of the high-temperature side. This causes a shrinkage difference between both sides of the paper and thus the paper curl is generated.

40|$|For <b>electrophotographic</b> <b>printers,</b> {{periodic}} clustered screens are preferable due {{to their}} homogeneous halftone texture, robustness to dot gain, and increased dot stability. In traditional periodic clustered-dot color halftoning, to avoid the complete dot-on-dot printing, each color plane is independently rendered with a different screen at a different angle. However, depending on the screen angle and frequency, the final halftone may have strong visible moire due to {{the interaction of the}} periodic structure. Additionally, the slight displacement between each color plane may cause significant color shifts in the final halftone. This thesis addresses issues on finding optimal color screen sets which produce the minimal visible moire and are also robust to registration errors. To achieve these goals, this thesis proposes new techniques including common periodicity, halftone microtexture spectrum, and registration sensitivity analysis. The common periodicity of two different periodic screens characterizes the structural patterns of the mixed colors. In particular, large common periodic patterns are found to inherently produce dot-on-dot patterns with good robustness against registration errors. The halftone microtexture spectrum method is shown to predict the visible moire more accurately than the conventional moire-free conditions. In our registration sensitivity analysis, three propositions are established using the periodicity of periodic screens. From the established propositions, we derive the conditions for registration insensitivity. Our results demonstrate significant improvements of clustered-dot screens in terms of the resilience against registration errors and minimizing the visible moire over the conventional periodic screens. ...|$|R
40|$|Conventional halftoning methods {{employed}} in <b>electrophotographic</b> <b>printers</b> tend to produce Moiré artifacts when used for printing images scanned from printed material such as books and magazines. We present {{a novel approach}} for descreening color scanned documents aimed at providing an efficient solution to the Moiré problem in practical imaging devices including copiers and Multi Function Printers (MFPs). The algorithm works by combining two non-linear image processing techniques, Resolution Synthesis-based Denoising (RSD) and Modified SUSAN filtering. The RSD predictor {{is based on a}} stochastic image model whose parameters are optimized beforehand in a separate training procedure. Using the optimized parameters, RSD classifies the local window around the current pixel in the scanned image and applies filters optimal for the selected classes. The output of the RSD predictor is treated as a first order estimate to the descreened image. The Modified SUSAN filter uses the output of RSD for performing an edge-preserving smoothing on the raw scanned data and produces the final output of the descreening algorithm. Our method does not require any knowledge of the screening method, such as the screen frequency or dither matrix coefficients, that produced the printed original.

This paper {{describes}} a data compression system using Evolvable Hardware (EHW) for digital color <b>electrophotographic</b> (EP) <b>printers.</b> EP printing {{is an important}} technology within digital printing, which is currently having {{a significant impact on}} the printing and publishing industry. Although, it requires data-compression to reduce the cost for transferring and storing large EP images, traditional techniques can not handle this data-compression well. This paper explains how EHW can be used as a compression system. EHW can change the compression method according to the characteristics of the image. The proposed EHW-based compression system can compress approximately twice as much data as JBIG, the current international standard. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Conventional halftoning methods {{employed}} in <b>electrophotographic</b> <b>printers</b> tend to produce Moiré artifacts when used for printing images scanned from printed material, such as books and magazines. We present {{a novel approach}} for descreening color scanned documents aimed at providing an efficient solution to the Moiré problem in practical imaging devices, including copiers and multifunction printers. The algorithm works by combining two nonlinear image-processing techniques, resolution synthesis-based denoising (RSD), and modified smallest univalue segment assimilating nucleus (SUSAN) filtering. The RSD predictor {{is based on a}} stochastic image model whose parameters are optimized beforehand in a separate training procedure. Using the optimized parameters, RSD classifies the local window around the current pixel in the scanned image and applies filters optimized for the selected classes. The output of the RSD predictor is treated as a first-order estimate to the descreened image. The modified SUSAN filter uses the output of RSD for performing an edge-preserving smoothing on the raw scanned data and produces the final output of the descreening algorithm. Our method does not require any knowledge of the screening method, such as the screen frequency or dither matrix coefficients, that produced the printed original. The proposed scheme not only suppresses the Moiré artifacts, but, in addition, can be trained with intrinsic sharpening for deblurring scanned documents. Finally, once optimized for a periodic clustered-dot halftoning method, the same algorithm can be used to inverse halftone scanned images containing stochastic error diffusion halftone noise.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{proposes a}} novel shape matching methodology for objects {{represented by a}} planar Gaussian mixture, and describes the design of two web-based troubleshooting tools for printing issues with <b>electrophotographic</b> <b>printers.</b> The motivation of the shape matching methodology {{is the problem of}} recognizing planar objects consisting of 2 ̆ 2 blobs 2 ̆ 2 that can be modeled as weighted Gaussian densities (e. g., the halftone patterns in a print). We first describe an empirical comparison method assuming a large number of independent samples are given for each distribution. This recognition method is extended to the case where one Gaussian Mixture is a known template and the other Gaussian mixture consists of an observed sparse set of points (e. g., the minutiae of a fingerprint). Instead of comparing the Gaussian mixtures directly, we compare the underlying distribution of distances of each mixture. Since distances are invariant under rotations and translations, this provides a workaround to the problem of aligning the objects before comparing them—thus speeding the comparison process. We prove that the distribution of distances is a lossless representation of the shape of generic Gaussian mixtures, and show that the proposed method is no less accurate than methods which compare the planar mixtures directly. The remaining discussion focuses on the design of two web-based troubleshooting tools for print quality and printing color issues. Both issues poses special challenges for a manufacturer 2 ̆ 7 s support organization, and a quick resolution is an important factor for customer satisfaction. We review the process for developing the websites, and the organization of their content. ...|$|R
40|$|Accurate {{estimation}} of toner usage {{is an area}} of on-going importance for laser, <b>electrophotographic</b> (EP) <b>printers.</b> In Part 1, we propose a new two-stage approach in which we first predict on a pixel-by-pixel basis, the absorptance from printed and scanned pages. We then form a weighted sum of these pixel values to predict overall toner usage on the printed page. The weights are chosen by least-squares regression to toner usage measured with a set of printed test pages. Our two-stage predictor significantly outperforms existing methods that are based on a simple pixel counting strategy in terms of both accuracy and robustness of the predictions. ^ In Part 2, we describe a raster-input-based object map generation algorithm (OMGA) for laser, <b>electrophotographic</b> (EP) <b>printers.</b> The object map is utilized in the object-oriented halftoning approach, where different halftone screens and color maps are applied to different types of objects on the page in order to improve the overall printing quality. The OMGA generates object map from the raster input directly. It solves problems such as the object map obtained from the page description language (PDL) is incorrect, and an initial object map is unavailable from the processing pipeline. A new imaging pipeline for the laser EP printer incorporating both the OMGA and the object-oriented halftoning approach is proposed. The OMGA is a segmentation-based classification approach. It first detects objects according to the edge information, and then classifies the objects by analyzing the feature values extracted from the contour and the interior of each object. The OMGA is designed to be hardware-friendly, and can be implemented within two passes through the input document. ...|$|R

Taking advantage of recent refinements in digital <b>electrophotographic</b> (EP) <b>printer</b> technology, the authors conducted experiments on a commercially deployable system to assess whether the potential advantages of hexagonal dot packing are economically exploitable. Keywords: hexagonal, halftone, spot function, spectrogram Introduction Digital printing has nearly always been accomplished by round dots organized on rectangular grids. It is understood that the improved packing efficiency of hexagonal grids for round dots would be more easily achieved than rectangular dots for rectangular grids, but evidently neither hexagonal grids nor rectangular dots have generally been considered worthwhile. Ulichney [1] addressed halftone theory for hexagonal grids. Average dot overlap can be reduced, since smaller dots can ensure 100 perce [...] ...|$|R

Identifying the {{originating}} {{device for}} a given media, i. e. the type, brand, model and other characteristics of the device, is currently {{one of the important}} fields of digital forensics. This paper proposes a forensic technique based on the Benford’s law to identify the printer’s brand and model from the printed-and-scanned images at which the first digit probability distribution of multi-size block DCT coefficients are extracted that constitutes a feature vector as the input to support vector machine (SVM) classifier. The proposed technique is different from the traditional use of noise feature patterns appeared in the literature. It uses as few as nine numbers of forensic features representing each printer by leveraging properties of the Benford’s law for printer identification. Experiments conducted over <b>electrophotographic</b> (EP) <b>printers</b> and deskjet printers achieve an average of 96. 0 % classification rate of identification for five distinct printer brands and an average of 94. 0 % classification rate for six diverse printer models out of those five brands...|$|R
40|$|Periodic, {{clustered-dot}} halftone patterns {{generated by}} screening with a threshold matrix are {{generally considered to}} be the preferred choice for printing with <b>electrophotographic</b> <b>printers.</b> This approach has the dual advantage of yielding more stable printed patterns than aperiodic, dispersed-dot halftoning methods, and being very computationally efficient, since the halftoning is performed on a pixel-by-pixel basis with simple comparison operations. However, there is a tradeoff with periodic, clustered-dot halftones between using a coarser screen to yield more stable halftone patterns and using a finer screen to yield better rendering of detail. ^ Conventional way is to single halftone pattern in a document, but in this paper, we consider a dual-mode halftoning process that switches between periodic, clustered-dot screens of two different frequencies—a low frequency screen for smooth regions and a high frequency screen for detail regions. These regions are described by an object map that is extracted from a high-level representation of the page content to be rendered. This high-level representation is contained in the page description language (PDL) version of the page to be printed. ^ This idea is beneficial in that we can reduce printing artifacts at smooth region and fine rendition at detail region. Nonetheless, one drawback of dual-mode halftoning approaches is appearance of boundary artifacts at the boundary between the smooth and detail halftones. When switching between periodic, clustered-dot halftones with two different frequencies, we may have an appearance similar to the 2 ̆ 2 jaggies 2 ̆ 2 that occur along an edge in a sampled image. ^ To overcome the boundary artifact, our screens obey a harmonic relationship. In addition we implement a blending process based on a transition region. We propose a nonlinear blending process in which at each pixel, we choose the maximum of the two weighted halftones where weights vary according to the position in the transition region. Moreover, we describe an on-line tone-mapping for the boundary blending process, based on an off-line calibration procedure that effectively assures the desired tone values within the transition region. We will provide detail algorithm and experimental results for the dual-mode object oriented halftoning. ...|$|R
