40|$|Real-time {{estimation}} of destination and travel time for taxis {{is of great}} importance for existing <b>electronic</b> <b>dispatch</b> systems. We present an approach based on trip matching and ensemble learning, in which we leverage the patterns observed in a dataset of roughly 1. 7 million taxi journeys to predict the corresponding final destination and travel time for ongoing taxi trips, as a solution for the ECML/PKDD Discovery Challenge 2015 competition. The results of our empirical evaluation show that our approach is effective and very robust, which led our team [...] BlueTaxi [...] to the 3 rd and 7 th position of the final rankings for the trip time and destination prediction tasks, respectively. Given {{the fact that the}} final rankings were computed using a very small test set (with only 320 trips) we believe that our approach {{is one of the most}} robust solutions for the challenge based on the consistency of our good results across the test sets.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 82 - 88). This thesis {{will examine}} the administration of executive compensation in listed companies in South Africa {{in order to understand}} the background to the topical emotion expressed by the public about the quantum of executive earnings. The Thesis attempts to explain how approaches are made to these vast payments. It commences with the history of the management of executive compensation. Before the 1990 s, disclosure of directors' emoluments was limited to one amount. Companies suffered losses due to the Agency Theory where executives dominated boards. With the introduction of remuneration committees and corporate governance, control was moved to a committee of the board of -non-executive directors (a remuneration committee). The purpose of this research was to ascertain whether such a committee is effective. Interviews were held with leading executives and an analyst. An <b>electronic</b> survey was <b>dispatched</b> to the chief executive officers and chief financial officers of a large selection of listed companies. The results of the research are summarised and conclusions expressed on all such views with the addition of limited input of the author's views. The question requires an examination of the effectiveness of remuneration committees. Some suggestions are also made as to future research and actions which may be conducted. This thesis shows that remuneration committees are not as effective as they should be and will explain why this is so...|$|R
