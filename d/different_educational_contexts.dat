50|$|Psychology is a so well {{developed}} discipline that allows different specializations: a) clinical and health psychology, b) work and organizational psychology, c) educational psychology, etc. What differentiates an educational psychologist from other psychologists or specialists is constituted by an academic triangle whose vertexes {{are represented by}} three categories: teachers, students and curricula (see diagram). The use of plural in these three cases assumes two meanings: a) the traditional or official one and b) other more general derived from our information and knowledge society. The plural also indicates that nowadays {{we can no longer}} consider the average student or teacher, or a closed curriculum, but the enormous variety found in our students, teachers and curricula. The triangle vertexes are connected by two-directional arrows, allowing four-fold typologies instead of the traditional two-way relationships (e.g., teacher-student). In this way, we can find, in <b>different</b> <b>educational</b> <b>contexts,</b> groups of good teachers and students (excellent teaching/learning processes and products), groups of good teachers but bad students, and groups of bad teachers and good students, producing in both cases lower levels of academic achievements. In addition, we can find groups of bad teachers and bad students (school failure).This specific work of an educational psychologist takes place in different contexts: micro-, meso- and macro-systems. Microsystems refer to family contexts, where atmosphere, hidden curriculum, and expectations and behaviors of all family members determine, to a large extent, the educational development of each student. The term mesosystem refers to all variety of contexts found in educational institutions, knowing that different variables such as geographical location, institution marketing or type of teachers and students, etc., can influence the academic results of students. Macrosystem has a much more general and global nature, leading us, for example, to consider the influence that the different societies or countries have on educational final products. One illustrative example of this level can be the analyses carried out on data gathered by the PISA reports. This approach would be the essence of educational psychology versus school psychology for many of U.S. educational researchers and for Division 15 of APA.|$|E

40|$|Today {{there is}} an {{abundance}} of up-to-date highly specialised medical educational content created by medical and health related academic institutions and available in digital format on the internet. Such educational content includes learning objects of conventional types, content unique in medical education {{and a variety of}} alternative educational content types, either reflecting active learning techniques and tacit knowledge building experiences and/or stemming from newly introduced Web 2. 0 technologies. Such content is often shared among different educators and is enriched, adapted and in general repurposed {{so that it can be}} re-used in different contexts. This paper discusses educational content and content repurposing in medical education, i. e. changing a learning object initially created and used for a specific educational purpose in a specific <b>educational</b> <b>context</b> in order to fit a different new purpose in the same or <b>different</b> <b>educational</b> <b>context.</b> It presents <b>different</b> repurposing contexts and an overview of the current state on content repurposing.

40|$|AbstractIt {{was only}} {{ten years ago}} that MIT {{announced}} its OpenCourseWare initiative, and in 2012 the Paris Declaration on OER (Open Educational Resources) was announced by UNESCO. Over this decade, {{there has been a}} proliferation of open educational resources (OER) worldwide, including the publication of open courses that anyone may access on the Internet. This phenomenon continues to expand, but mostly without the provision of increased levels of service beyond the simple publication of course materials online. In spite of the open Creative Commons licensing under which many of OER materials are published online, actual adoption and adaptation of these materials by another institution wishing to incorporate them into a <b>different</b> <b>educational</b> <b>context</b> poses numerous challenges.

40|$|Education {{has become}} internationalised. Educational trends, {{concerns}} and debates exceed national and cultural borders, and ideas and innovations are being exchanged and transferred. Many curriculum programmes and reforms in education {{are influenced by}} international trends and by curricular ideas developed in a <b>different</b> <b>educational</b> <b>context</b> {{than the one in}} which they are put into practice. How does this affect the process of realisation and their effects in schools? Technology as a subject in compulsory education is one field where perspectives, concerns and ideas to a large extent are exchanged and transferred on the international arena. The importance of technology as a component of education for all is increasingly recognised, and the concept of technological literacy has emerged (Lewis & Gagel 1992, Liddament 1994, Barnett 1995, Ferreyra 1997, Jenkins 1997 a, Jenkins 1997 b, Petrina 2000). Though drawing on a variety of different traditions, technology as a specific and independent subject is a newcomer in the school curriculum in many countries.

High quality content is available online, both through established courses and through open educational resources.

40|$|Action Research and Participatory Action Research are {{forms of}} {{qualitative}} inquiry particularly useful for <b>educational</b> <b>contexts</b> and situations since they {{move from a}} constructive and re-constructive perspective and focus on actions and practices that can sustain change and transformation. Educational situations can be explored according to different perspectives (taking into account the matrix defined by Habermas in Erkenntins und Interesse) : a descriptive perspective, according to an empirical-analitical approach, an ermeneutic perspective according to an ermeneutic and phenomenological approach, a constructive perspective according to a critical and dialectic approach. We can therefore describe and explain educational situations {{in order to control}} and manage them; we can look for a deep understanding of the implications, meanings, motives, representations embedded into educational situations engaging with different agents and their points of view; we can, finally engage with educational situations trying to act on them starting from issues and problems emerging from within <b>educational</b> <b>contexts,</b> intended as a complex texture of actors, aims and scopes, memories and narratives, and therefore involving different agents. Action Research and Participatory Action Research move from this last perspective focusing on the changes that can be brought about by introducing new educational actions, models and patterns into <b>different</b> <b>educational</b> <b>context</b> as a tentative response to educational issues and problems, that can be reframed and re-worked out over time. The pattern of Action Research and of Participatory Action Research is circular, dynamic, open ended and reflective and requires the engagement of various kinds of actors who highlight the issues and problems explored through multiple perspectives and sustain the design and implementation of actions that are observed, reflected upon and validated from differents points of view. Reflection (either in the course of educational action as well as of educational research) is the constitutive epistemic structure of this specific kind of inquiry. Action Research and Participatory Action Research are grounded on a reflective methodology which follows a recursive pattern (planning,acting, reflection, evaluation) and requires dedicated spaces, times and tools. In this perspective P 4 C works either as an educational practice to be implemented into educational environments as well as an inquiry model for educational research according to a participatory action research framework.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} {{part of the first}} phase of a {{longitudinal}} project investigating the development of academic language in English as the Language of Teaching and Learning (LoLT) by Foundation phase learners in two <b>different</b> <b>educational</b> <b>contexts.</b> In the first context, the learners were all English additional language (EAL) learners taught by EAL teachers. In the second context EAL and English first language (L 1) learners were taught by L 1 teachers in integrated classes. The three groups of Grade 1 learners were assessed on the semantic subtests of the Diagnostic Evaluation of Language Variation Criterion, Referenced Edition, which evaluate the psycholin-guistic processing skills underlying lexical acquisition and organization. Vocabulary learning is central to the development of academic language and literacy. There were statistically significant differences between the three groups on all measures. The EAL learners in the first context had significantly lower scores than the EAL and L 1 learners in the second context, and the EAL learners in the second context had significantly lower scores than their L 1 peers. Pre-school exposure to English and gender did not have significant effects, except on the subtest assessing fast mapping of novel verbs. The results provide information on what can reasonably be expected from EAL learners in Grade 1, suggest language skills that can be addressed to support the learners, and have implications for language in education practices with EAL learners in <b>different</b> <b>educational</b> <b>contexts...</b>|$|E

40|$|Japanese {{non-native}} English-speaking EFL (English as {{a foreign}} language) teachers in secondary education (JEFL teachers) work in a <b>different</b> <b>educational</b> <b>context</b> from language teachers in Europe. The purpose of this exploratory research is to identify the distinctive ways in which JEFL teachers think, know, believe and do. These concepts are subsumed under the general heading of JEFL teacher cognition, particularly as this applies to teaching and teacher education in Eigo Kyoiku (English education in Japan). The overall purpose of exploring JEFL teachers’ cognitions is reflected in four research guiding questions (RQs) : 1) to identify the nature of JEFL teacher cognition; 2) to see any particular influences that might help shape JEFL teacher cognition; 3) to learn to what extent JEFL teachers’ cognitions are consistent with their actual practice of teaching; and 4) to discuss {{the ways in which}} the concept of language teacher cognition (LTC) may be understood and situated in the Japanese context. The research consisted of two studies: a) a quantitative Preliminary Study administered to 62 JEFL teachers and 81 modern foreign language (MFL) teachers in Scotland, in order to identify any areas regarding JEFL teacher cognition; and b) an in-depth Main Study based on a qualitative and ethnographic approach, featuring 10 JEFL teachers. This made use of qualitative data analysis and the applied KJ method, and also drew on complexity theory, through reflective and reflexive processes with particular reference to retrodictive qualitative modelling (RQM). The results of the Main Study are presented as 16 concept maps, each of which represents a featured aspect of JEFL teacher cognition (ATC).

40|$|One of {{the major}} issues that {{concerns}} tertiary institutions {{around the world is}} the student retention rate. In general, higher rates of completion give more positive image about the academic, administrative and financial statues of these institutions. However, improving the student completion and retention rates can be a challenging task. One way toward this goal is utilising strategies and techniques that are informed by the findings of theoretical models and empirical studies. Therefore, this paper reviews some of the contemporary studies in the student retention literature from <b>different</b> higher <b>educational</b> <b>contexts</b> around the world followed by a list of the variables that are commonly linked to the student retention phenomenon in higher education and a discussion of the factors that are most frequently associated with student attrition as reported by these studies. A summary of the factors associated with the student attrition phenomenon suggested that, the central factors were the quality of students’ institutional experiences and their level of integration into the academic and social systems of their academic institutions. These factors relate to students’ experiences with the administrative system of their academic institution, including the admission, registration and disciplinary rules and policies and the availability and quality of student services and facilities.

Although it has been noted that humour “is a very effective means of challenging the status quo in socially acceptable and linguistically sophisticated ways” (Holmes and Marra 2002 : 84), the subversive functions of humour remain largely under-researched. We aim to address this gap by analysing authentic audio- and video-recorded data in these <b>different</b> <b>educational</b> <b>contexts.</b> In line with most recent functional discourse analytical studies (c. f.
