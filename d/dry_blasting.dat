50|$|Process speeds are {{generally}} not as fast as conventional dry abrasive blasting when using the equivalent size and type of media. However the presence of water between {{the media and the}} substrate being processed creates a lubricating cushion that can protect both the media and the surface from excess damage. This has the dual advantage of lowering media breakdown rates and preventing impregnation of foreign materials into the surface. Hence surfaces after wet blasting are extremely clean, there is no embedded secondary contamination from the media or from previous blasting processes, and there is no static cling of dust to the blasted surface. Subsequent coating or bonding operations are not effected by the use of wet blasting or <b>dry</b> <b>blasting</b> because of the cleanliness levels achieved are identical. However wet blasting of mild steel will result in immediate or 'flash' corrosion of the blasted steel substrate due to the presence of water. The lack of surface recontamination also allows the use of single equipment for multiple blasting operations—e.g., stainless steel and carbon (mild) steel items can be processed in the same equipment with the same media without problems.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{investigate}} how material surfaces are affected by various surface treatments and how this relates to the adhesion of the coating. The materials that were studied were WC-Co and Cermets and the surface treatments used were polishing, grinding with coarser and finer abrasive grains, and finally wet blasting and <b>dry</b> <b>blasting.</b> Focus was on deformations and residual stresses in the surface, surface roughness and cracks. The test methods used for examining the samples included surface roughness measurements, residual stress measurements, adhesion tests using Rockwell indentation and SEM images of the surface and the cross section.

50|$|Dry-ice {{blasting}} involves propelling pellets at {{extremely high}} speeds. The actual dry-ice pellets are quite soft, {{and much less}} dense than other media used in blast-cleaning (i.e. sand or plastic pellets). Upon impact, the pellet sublimates almost immediately, transferring minimal kinetic energy to the surface on impact and producing minimal abrasion. The sublimation process absorbs a large volume of heat from the surface, producing shear stresses due to thermal shock. This is assumed to improve cleaning as {{the top layer of}} dirt or contaminant is expected to transfer more heat than the underlying substrate and flake off more easily. The efficiency and effectiveness of this process depends on the thermal conductivity of the substrate and contaminant. The rapid change in state from solid to gas also causes microscopic shock waves, which are also thought to assist in removing the contaminant. <b>Dry</b> Ice <b>Blasting</b> is nonabrasive, nonconductive and nonflammable. <b>Dry</b> Ice <b>Blasting</b> generates no additional waste or secondary contamination unlike media and water blasting.|$|R

40|$|Though MIG welding robots are {{extensively}} {{applied in}} the automotive assemblies ‘Spot Welding’ {{is the most common}} welding application found in the auto stamping assembly manufacturing. Every manufacturing process is subject to variations – with resistance welding, these include; part fit up, part thickness variations, misaligned electrodes, variations in coating materials or thickness, sealers, weld force variations, shunting, machine tooling degradation; and slag and spatter damage. All welding gun tips undergo wear; an elemental part of the process. Though adaptive resistance welding control automatically compensates to keep production and quality up to the levels needed as gun tips undergo wear so that the welds remain reliable; the system cannot compensate for deterioration caused by the slag and spatter on the part holding fixtures, sensors, and gun tips.

40|$|Atmospheric plasma {{spraying}} is a commonly used process to deposit ceramic coatings for applications of wear and corrosion protection.

Chromium oxide is however challenging to spray due to its high melting point, low thermal conductivity and tendency to vaporize in high temperatures. The vaporization of chromium oxide during spraying creates extremely fine dust particles, which gather on the workpiece and are trapped inside the coating layers reducing the cohesion and mechanical properties of the coating. <b>Dry</b> ice <b>blasting</b> {{has been used in}} the field {{to improve the quality of}} chromium oxide and many other plasma sprayed coatings by keeping the surfaces clean and helping with thermal management.

40|$|The Penrice Quarry in South Australia mines {{chemically}} pure marble {{for use in}} the chemical industry. The Quarry's major customer is the Penrice Soda Products plant at Osborne, S. A., where 508, 000 tonnes of high grade marble are used per annum. The marble is burnt in vertical shaft kilns (calcining) as part of the Solvay Process for soda ash (sodium carbonate) manufacture. Since early 1993 the kilns operations have been plagued by elevated kiln pressures coupled with the production of undesirable wastes called 'grits' (i. e. fine grained, partly calcined marble). These undesirable operating parameters and end products create limitations within the kilns plant and ultimately affect the down stream production of soda ash. It is known that the Penrice marble, although {{chemically pure}}, does not always behave ideally during calcining as it often has a tendency to disintegrate in the kilns. This disintegration, termed 'decrepitation', generates excessive amounts of granular material that interferes with the airflow updraft in the kilns. This results in elevated kiln pressures, increases in 'grits' production and difficulties in controlling other operating parameters. Given these criteria, it was apparent that this decrepitation had been the major contributor to these poor kilns performances since early 1993. Consequently, it was decided that a series of new investigations needed to be undertaken to determine: i. The major cause(s) at the quarry of potentially decrepitating marble given that the kilns operations are essentially constant, ii. Why the levels of decrepitation have increased, and iii What changes could be made to current quarry practices to prevent or at least minimise the occurrence of decrepitating marble. These investigations commenced with a break down of the current mining practices at the quarry which indicated that the most significant change to occur was the introduction of new production scheduling procedures (i. e. in-pit blending). Production records showed that since the introduction of these new scheduling procedures a significant proportion of marble for the Osborne plant was sourced from the lower benches in the northern end of the pit. Historically this marble was considered to be of unsuitable grade for the Osborne plant and as such almost all Osborne marble was sourced from {{the southern end of the}} pit. Further investigations indicated that the major difference between the southern and northern ends of the pit was that much of the mining in the northern end of the pit was below the water table and necessitated the use of waterproof explosives (i. e. Handibullc Wet*). For this reason it was decided to engage ICI Explosives to undertake some trial blasts and subsequent photogrammetric analyses to determine the differences between wet and <b>dry</b> <b>blasts</b> and the influence they had on the production of potentially decrepitating marble. The trials showed that both wet and <b>dry</b> hole <b>blasts</b> produced structurally weak marble around the explosive column in the blastholes, which was subsequently termed 'blast affected marble'. The main finding of the blasting trials was that wet hole blasting (Handibulk Wet) produced 6. 6 per cent blast affected marble while <b>dry</b> hole <b>blasting</b> (ANFO) produced only 1. 5 per cent. These results suggested that the increase in decrepitation and therefore poor kiln performances were linked to an increase in the utilisation of low strength (i. e. blast affected) marble as a result of increased wet hole blasting. Petrographic analyses were undertaken by the author in an effort to understand the nature and intensity of the fracture systems produced via blasting and how those findings could be related to blasting practices. Some point load strength tests were also conducted in order to gain an appreciation of the degree of strength loss produced between heavily blast affected marble and marble unaffected by blasting. Blend changes incorporating less marble from the northern end of the pit have helped to alleviate the problem while further work is continuing into alternative explosive types and dewatering methods within the lower benches of the pit to enable ANFO type explosives to be used...|$|R
