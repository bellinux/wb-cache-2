5|$|MFGM is a {{structurally}} complex bioactive milk component, {{found in}} <b>human</b> <b>milk</b> {{as well as}} the milk of other mammalian species. The MFGM in <b>human</b> <b>milk</b> contains many bioactive components with diverse functions and has been linked to cognitive and health benefits to infants. Some compositional differences are reported to exist between species, but bovine MFGM, the best-studied non-human source, generally contains a lipid and protein composition, which {{is similar to that of}} human MFGM.|$|E
5|$|MFGM may {{be capable}} of {{modulating}} immune function in the gut through distinct but potentially complementary mechanisms. Glycosylated proteins (MUC-1, MUC-15, butyrophilin, and lactadherin) and glycosylated sphingolipids from MFGM may promote the development of healthy gut microbiota by favoring beneficial Bifidobacterium species. Another key to the immunomodulatory function of MFGM may be that its structure {{is similar to that}} of the intestinal cell membrane, allowing <b>human</b> <b>milk</b> glycans (including those on glycoproteins and glycolipids) to competitively inhibit the binding of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, even toxins) to host cells.|$|E
5|$|Piglets {{that were}} fed with a formula {{containing}} milk phospholipids and gangliosides to mimic levels in <b>human</b> <b>milk</b> made choices more rapidly and with fewer errors in a spatial T-maze cognitive test compared to controls, implying improved spatial learning. Similarly, Vickers et al. (2009) demonstrated that administration of complex milk lipids to rats from postnatal day 10 through adulthood (day 80) led to {{significant improvements in}} learning and memory tasks compared to control animals. Conversely, a study of complex milk lipid supplementation to pregnant mice {{did not have an}} effect on cognitive tasks in their offspring.|$|E
40|$|M. Tech. Natural {{occurring}} {{components in}} <b>human</b> breast <b>milk,</b> cow milk and soy milk have shown anticarcinogenic abilities. The <b>human</b> breast <b>milk</b> protein, -lactalbumin, {{was found to}} induce apoptosis in cancer cells, embryonic cells and rapidly growing cells, when converted from its native form to a partial denatured apoptotic-inducing form. Moreover, radiation may cause irreversible changes of protein conformation at the molecular level. Native -lactalbumin is one protein that has shown a decrease in aromatic amino acid concentration {{and the formation of}} high and low molecular weight fractions when exposed to high doses of ionizing radiation. The effect of <b>human</b> breast <b>milk,</b> cow milk, soy milk and galactose (positive control) on SNO, A 549 cancer cells and normal lymphocytes were investigated. <b>Human</b> breast <b>milk</b> was irradiated with low doses of Co 60 ionizing radiation (0. 1 Gy, 1. 0 Gy and 5. 0 Gy) in order to establish the effect of these doses on the apoptotic-inducing ability of <b>human</b> breast <b>milk.</b> The techniques used included, Trypan blue dye exclusion (cell viability), haematoxylin and eosin stain (cell morphology), modified comet assay (halo) (DNA damage) and flow cytometry (apoptosis and necrosis). Findings showed that <b>human</b> breast <b>milk,</b> irradiated <b>human</b> breast <b>milk</b> and galactose induced apoptosis in the SNO, A 549 cells and lymphocytes. The cell viability, cell morphology and DNA fragmentation patterns of irradiated <b>human</b> breast <b>milk</b> were similar to that of non-irradiated <b>human</b> breast <b>milk,</b> although the flow cytometry results did not correlate. Cow and soy milk did not induce apoptosis in the SNO, A 549 cells and lymphocytes. The modified comet assay (halo) detected DNA damage as apoptotic or necrotic cells. A clear distinction could not be made between the two cell populations using this assay. Flow Cytometry discriminated and quantified apoptotic cells and necrotic/late apoptotic cells using Annexin V and Propidium Iodide (PI), respectively...|$|R
50|$|A {{minority}} of people, including restaurateurs Hans Lochen of Switzerland and Daniel Angerer of Austria, who operates {{a restaurant in}} New York City, have used <b>human</b> breast <b>milk,</b> or at least advocated its use, {{as a substitute for}} cow's milk in dairy products and food recipes. Tammy Frissell-Deppe, a family counsellor specialized in attachment parenting, published a book, titled A Breastfeeding Mother's Secret Recipes, providing a lengthy compilation of detailed food and beverage recipes containing <b>human</b> breast <b>milk.</b> The animal rights organization known as PETA ignited a firestorm of criticism when it urged a dairy company to replace the cow's milk they use in their ice cream products with <b>human</b> breast <b>milk</b> as a way to stop cattle abuse. <b>Human</b> breast <b>milk</b> is not produced or distributed industrially or commercially, because the use of <b>human</b> breast <b>milk</b> as an adult food is considered unusual to the majority of cultures around the world, and most disapprove of such a practice.|$|R

25|$|<b>Human</b> <b>milk</b> {{is rich in}} choline, but {{formulas}} {{derived from}} other sources, particularly soy, have lower total choline concentrations than <b>human</b> <b>milk.</b> Bovine milk and bovine-derived formulas had similar or higher glycerophosphocholine compared to <b>human</b> <b>milk,</b> and soy-derived formulas had lower glycerophosphocholine content. Phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin concentrations were similar between bovine formulas and <b>human</b> <b>milk,</b> but soy-derived infant formulas had more phosphatidylcholine than human or bovine sources. Soy-derived formulas had less sphingomyelin than <b>human</b> <b>milk,</b> which is a concern, since sphingomyelin is used for producing myelin, which insulates neurons. Free choline concentrations in mature <b>human</b> <b>milk</b> were 30–80% lower than those found in bovine milk or formulas.

40|$|A current aim of {{nutrigenetics}} is {{to personalize}} nutritional practices according to genetic variations {{that influence the}} way of digestion and metabolism of nutrients introduced with the diet. Nutritional epigenetics concerns knowledge {{about the effects of}} nutrients on gene expression. Nutrition in early life or in critical periods of development, may have a role in modulating gene expression, and, therefore, have later effects on health. <b>Human</b> breast <b>milk</b> is well-known for its ability in preventing several acute and chronic diseases. Indeed, breastfed children may have lower risk of neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis, infectious diseases, and also of non-communicable diseases, such as obesity and related-disorders. Beneficial effects of <b>human</b> breast <b>milk</b> on health may be associated in part with its peculiar components, possible also via epigenetic processes. This paper discusses about presumed epigenetic effects of <b>human</b> breast <b>milk</b> and components. While evidence suggests that a direct relationship may exist of some components of <b>human</b> breast <b>milk</b> with epigenetic changes, the mechanisms involved are still unclear.

40|$|In {{this study}} a novel method to {{determine}} iodine concentrations in <b>human</b> breast <b>milk</b> {{was developed and}} validated. The iodine was analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS) following tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) extraction at 90 °C in disposable polypropylene tubes. While similar approaches have been used previously, this method adopted a shorter extraction time (1 h vs. 3 h) and used antimony (Sb) as the internal standard, which exhibited greater stability in breast milk and milk powder matrices compared to tellurium (Te). Method validation included: defining iodine linearity up to 200 μgL(- 1); confirming recovery of iodine from NIST 1549 milk powder. A recovery of 94 - 98 % was also achieved for the NIST 1549 <b>milk</b> powder and <b>human</b> breast <b>milk</b> samples spiked with sodium iodide and thyroxine (T 4) solutions. The method quantitation limit (MQL) for <b>human</b> breast <b>milk</b> was 1. 6 μgL(- 1). The intra-assay and inter-assay coefficient of variation for the breast milk samples and NIST powder were < 1 % and < 3. 5 %, respectively. NIST 1549 <b>milk</b> powder, <b>human</b> breast <b>milk</b> samples and calibration standards spiked with the internal standard were all stable for at least 2. 5 months after extraction. The results of the validation process confirmed that this newly developed method provides greater accuracy and precision {{in the assessment of}} iodine concentrations in <b>human</b> breast <b>milk</b> than previous methods and therefore offers a more reliable approach for assessing iodine concentrations in <b>human</b> breast <b>milk.</b> Dao Huynh, Shao Jia Zhou, Robert Gibson, Lyndon Palmer, Beverly Muhlhausle...|$|R
25|$|The blood {{clotting}} factors of newborn babies are roughly 30–60% that of adult values; {{this may be}} due to the reduced synthesis of precursor proteins and the sterility of their guts. <b>Human</b> <b>milk</b> contains 1–4μg/L of vitamin K1, while formula-derived milk can contain up to 100μg/L in supplemented formulas. Vitamin K2 concentrations in <b>human</b> <b>milk</b> appear to be much lower than those of vitamin K1. Occurrence of vitamin K deficiency bleeding in the first week of the infant's life is estimated at 0.25–1.7%, with a prevalence of 2–10 cases per 100,000 births. Premature babies have even lower levels of the vitamin, so they are at a higher risk from this deficiency.|$|E

25|$|Copper is {{essential}} for the normal growth and development of human fetuses, infants, and children. The human fetus accumulates copper rapidly in its liver during the third trimester of pregnancy. At birth, a healthy infant has four times the concentration of copper than a full-grown adult. <b>Human</b> <b>milk</b> is relatively low in copper, and the neonate's liver stores falls rapidly after birth, supplying copper to the fast-growing body during the breast feeding period. These supplies are necessary to carry out such metabolic functions as cellular respiration, melanin pigment and connective tissue synthesis, iron metabolism, free radical defense, gene expression, and the normal functioning of the heart and immune systems in infants.|$|E

40|$|Objective: This study {{investigated}} the effects of <b>human</b> breast <b>milk</b> and its components on the nutritional aspect of the caries process due to Streptococcus mutans UA 159 biofilm formation. Study design: <b>Human</b> breast <b>milk</b> was collected from 11 mothers during 3 - 9 months postpartum. To test for the effect on biofilm formation, a 16 -hour culture of S. mutans was treated with dilutions of <b>human</b> breast <b>milk</b> and several major components of <b>human</b> breast <b>milk,</b> lactose, lactoferrin, IgA, and bovine casein in sterile 96 -well flat bottom microtiter plates for 24 hours. The biofilms were fixed, washed, stained with crystal violet, and extracted. Absorbance was measured to evaluate biofilm growth mass. Results: Dilutions 1 : 10 - 1 : 2, 560 of the <b>human</b> breast <b>milk</b> samples increased biofilm formation by 1. 5 - 3. 8 fold compared to the control. Lactoferrin decreased biofilm formation significantly in all dilutions (average milk concentration of 3 mg/ml). Lactose had no effect at average breast milk concentrations (60 mg/ml) except at its lowest concentration (15 mg/ml) where it was increased. IgA significantly decreased biofilm formation at its highest concentration of 2, 400 μg/ml (average milk concentration 600 μg/ml). Casein caused significantly increased biofilm formation at all concentrations tested above the average milk content (2. 3 mg/ml). Conclusions: The {{results of this study}} demonstrate an increase in S. mutans biofilm formation by <b>human</b> breast <b>milk</b> 3 - 9 months post partum. Among its major components, only casein significantly increased biofilm formation among the concentrations analyzed. Lactose had no effect except at 15 mg/ml. Lactoferrin and IgA significantly decreased S. mutans biofilm formation at their highest concentrations.

25|$|Every time a cow {{enters the}} parlor several {{things need to}} happen to ensure milk quality and cow health. First, the cow’s udder must be cleaned and {{disinfected}} to prevent both milk contamination and udder infections. Then the milking technician must check each teat for signs of infection by observing the first stream of milk. During this processes, called stripping the teat, the milking technician is looking for any discoloration or chunkiness that would indicate mastitis, an infection in the cow’s mammary gland. Milk from a cow with mastitis cannot enter the <b>human</b> <b>milk</b> supply, thus farmers must be careful that infected milk does not mix with the milk from healthy cows and that the cow gets the necessary treatment. If the cow passes the mastitis inspection, the milking technician will attach the milking cluster. The cluster will run until the cow is fully milked and then drop off. The milk travels immediately through a cooling system and then into a large cooled storage tank, where it will stay until {{picked up by a}} refrigerated milk truck. Before the cow is released from the milking stalls her teats are disinfected one last time to prevent infection.|$|E
