It was an organization designed to establish insurgency and, second, {{function as an}} intelligence service. Instigating insurgency, conducting espionage in foreign countries, and counterespionage inside the Ottoman Empire was the function between 1913-1918. The institutional origin, the reason given at the strategic document, {{was related to the}} unsatisfactory result of the First Balkan War and goal was the recovery of Edirne. This military organization had no precedent in Ottoman history, and it was developed direct interaction out of the counterinsurgency experiences from Macedonia and the guerrilla experiences from Libya with a handful of Ottoman officers. Difference between secret service of Abdulmamit II was directly linked to him and did not have operational function. There is a controversy of burned intelligence documents of special forces, which Shaw puts the event in 1914 not later. That was the day Enver became war minister and destroyed the Abdulhamit's records, probably Abdulhamit's intelligence on him. The <b>first</b> <b>field</b> <b>operator</b> was Süleyman Askeri, who undertook the first mission and established the field structure. No actual evidence to support any claims of a dual-track structure, which means operated with both political and military goals. Managed singlehandedly by Süleyman Askeri Bey from foundation to November 1914. The organization sub-management consisted of Atif Bey (Kamçil), Aziz Bey, Dr. Bahattin Sahakir, and Dr. Nazim Bey [...] Staff was organized four departments: the European Section headed by Arif Bey, the Caucasian Section headed by Captain Reza Bey, the Africa and Libya Section headed by Hüseyin Tosun Bey, and the Eastern Provinces Section headed by Dr. Sakir and Rueni Bey. The headquarter was on Nur-i Osmariiye Street in Istanbul.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} we develop a general {{mathematical}} framework to determine interior eigenvalues from {{a knowledge of}} the modified far <b>field</b> <b>operator</b> associated with an unknown (anisotropic) inhomogeneity. The modified far <b>field</b> <b>operator</b> is obtained by subtracting from the measured far <b>field</b> <b>operator</b> the computed far <b>field</b> <b>operator</b> corresponding to a well-posed scattering problem depending on one (possibly complex) parameter. Injectivity of this modified far <b>field</b> <b>operator</b> is related to an appropriate eigenvalue problem whose eigenvalues can be determined from the scattering data, and thus can be used to obtain information about material properties of the unknown inhomogeneity. We discuss here two examples of such modification leading to a Steklov eigenvalue problem, and a new type of the transmission eigenvalue problem.

The combinatorics of perturbative quantum field theory is traditionally dealt with via functional methods and generating functions.
