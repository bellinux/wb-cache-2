50|$|Researchers {{have found}} {{evidence}} that the P2 is involved in memory processes. Differences in P200 peak amplitude suggest that anterior and posterior distributional differences are elicited during encoding of words for rote and <b>elaborative</b> <b>memory</b> tasks. While encoding the words across both memory tasks, participants who subsequently recalled less generated larger frontal amplitudes and smaller parietal/occipital amplitudes than those who recalled more. Also, {{researchers have found that}} the P200 (overlapping with the P300) was elicited in a digit span task when participants heard the reverse order of a digit series that they previously heard. This indicates that the P2 is sensitive to short-term working memory and recognition as well.|$|E
50|$|Absentmindedness is {{a gap in}} {{attention}} {{which causes}} memory failure. In this situation the information does not disappear from memory, it can later be recalled. But the lack of attention at a specific moment prevents the information from being recalled at that specific moment. A common cause of absentmindedness {{is a lack of}} attention. Attention is vital to encoding information in long-term memory. Without proper attention, material is much less likely to be stored properly and recalled later. When attention is divided, less activity in the lower left frontal lobe diminishes the ability for <b>elaborative</b> <b>memory</b> encoding to take place, and results in absentminded forgetting. More recent research has shown that divided attention also leads to less hippocampal involvement in encoding. A common cause of absentmindedness is not being able to remember to carry out actions that had been planned {{to be done in the}} future, for example, picking up grocery items, and remembering times of meetings.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} the effectiveness of <b>elaborative</b> interrogation for <b>memory</b> enhancement relative to self-selected and repetition strategies. It also examined the potency of the strategies when students worked individually or with a partner. One hundred and twenty university students were {{assigned to one of}} the study strategies and one study context. Students studied sixty animal facts. Thirty of the animal facts were about familiar animals while the other thirty were about unfamiliar animals. Students trained to use elaborative interrogation and allowed to select their own strategy were more successful at recognizing familiar animals than those trained to use repetition. Students in the self-study condition also recognized more unfamiliar animal facts than did students in the repetition condition. No difference in memory performance was found between the elaborative interrogation and selfâ€”study conditions for either familiar or unfamiliar animals. Students who studied in dyads performed better on the recognition task than those who studied individually. Elaboration quality and strategies selected are also examined...|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} of elaborative encoding strategies during learning, such as grouping items on similar semantic categories, {{increases the likelihood}} of later recall. Previous studies have suggested that stimuli that encourage semantic grouping strategies had modulating effects on specific ERP components. However, these studies did not differentiate between ERP activation patterns evoked by <b>elaborative</b> working <b>memory</b> strategies like semantic grouping and more simple strategies like rote rehearsal. Identification of neurocognitive correlates underlying successful use of elaborative strategies is important to understand better why certain populations, like children or elderly people, have problems applying such strategies. To compare ERP activation during the {{application of}} elaborative versus more simple strategies subjects had to encode either four semantically related or unrelated pictures by respectively applying a semantic category grouping or a simple rehearsal strategy. Another goal was to investigate if maintenance of semantically grouped vs. ungrouped pictures modulated ERP-slow waves differently. At the behavioral level there was only a semantic grouping benefit in terms of faster responding on correct rejections (i. e. when the memory probe stimulus {{was not part of the}} memory set). At the neural level, during encoding semantic grouping only had a modest specific modulatory effect on a fronto-central Late Positive Component (LPC), emerging around 650 ms. Other ERP components (i. e. P 200, N 400 and a second Late Positive Component) that had been earlier related to semantic grouping encoding processes now showed stronger modulation by rehearsal than by semantic grouping. During maintenance semantic grouping had specific modulatory effects on left and right frontal slow wave activity. These results stress the importance of careful control of strategy use when investigating the neural correlates of elaborative encoding...|$|R
