40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{this work}} is the {{production}} of <b>dissolving</b> <b>pulps</b> from sugarcane bagasse, for cellulose derivatives production. The pulps were produced by soda delignification process, with or without anthraquinone, of sugarcane bagasse pretreated by steam explosion. The soda-anthraquinone process showed to be more advantageous, with 32. 17 % less cellulose degradation than for soda pulping. The best pulp yield was reached at lower temperatures, where the process provides {{a reduction in the}} recalcitrance of lignocellulosic material with a solubilization of lignin fragments of low molecular weight without high cellulose degradation. A future goal is to use these cellulosic pulps as precursors in cellulosic derivatives...|$|R
50|$|<b>Dissolving</b> <b>pulp,</b> {{also called}} {{dissolving}} cellulose, is bleached wood pulp or cotton linters {{that has a}} high cellulose content (> 90%). It has special properties including {{a high level of}} brightness and uniform molecular-weight distribution. This pulp is manufactured for uses that require a high chemical purity, and particularly low hemicellulose content, since the chemically similar hemicellulose can interfere with subsequent processes. <b>Dissolving</b> <b>pulp</b> is so named because it is not made into paper, but dissolved either in a solvent or by derivatization into a homogeneous solution, which makes it completely chemically accessible and removes any remaining fibrous structure. Once dissolved, it can be spun into textile fibers (viscose or Lyocell), or chemically reacted to produce derivatized celluloses, such cellulose triacetate, a plastic-like material formed into fibers or films, or cellulose ethers such as methyl cellulose, used as a thickener.|$|E

40|$|Tencel {{is a new}} fiber made in {{a process}} that is similar to the {{creation}} of rayon. As with rayon, cellulose, primarily from wood pulp, is used to make the fiber.

The <b>dissolved</b> <b>pulp</b> is then forced through tiny holes called spinnerettes creating long, smooth, lusterous fibers much like silk in appearance and drape. It can be dyed to deep color. When spuning tencel fiber it is quite luscious. It has that wonderful silken sheen. One knows that no silk worms died to produce it. It can be very slippery to spin so it is not a beginner's fiber, but anyone ready for silk can handle it with ease. Many spinners have a great enthusiasm for this new fiber.
