5000|$|One of Australia's most internationally renowned {{contemporary}} artists, Lister's work {{presents a}} grimy fusion {{of high and}} lowbrow culture with influences {{from a number of}} areas and genres, including street art, expressionism, pop art, and contemporary youth culture, often drawing from television and the [...] "misguided role models" [...] that result. Revelling in the [...] "spirituality" [...] and the [...] "heritage" [...] of Western popular culture he takes this <b>joint</b> <b>legacy</b> and remoulds it into something equally alluring and grotesque, a perfect representation of the society he seeks to depict. These works are seen in galleries across the globe with solo exhibitions across Australia, United States, Europe and UK.|$|E

A sketch of his research career {{is followed by a}} discussion of the work of his wife, Dr. Jane Murphy, first on St. Lawrence Island, near the Bering Strait, and later as a key figure in the Stirling County project. A brief conclusion highlights the main aspects of their <b>joint</b> <b>legacy</b> to cultural psychiatry and psychiatric epidemiology. Key words biography • cultural psychiatry • research methods • social psychiatry I am deeply honoured to provide the introduction to this special issue of Transcultural Psychiatry, celebrating the many scientific contributions of two pioneers in psychiatric epidemiology: Alexander Hamilton Leighton and his wife Jane Murphy. Originally, I had intended to write only of the contributions of Dr. Leighton. I felt, however, that I had to widen the scope so as to make it possible to give due credit to someone who has accom-panied him almost {{from the beginning of the}} Stirling County Studies up to now. I would like to begin by briefly sketching, from a personal perspective, some details of Dr. Leighton’s career. It is, without doubt, a unique and Vol 43 (1) : 7 – 20 DOI: 10. 1177 / 1363461506061754 www. sagepublications. com Copyright © 2006 McGill University transcultural psychiatr...|$|E

Several of his results are described, in particular those fundamental results on the infinitely divisible distributions. Attention is paid also to his interaction with Paul Levy.

40|$|How did galaxies {{form and}} evolve? This {{is one of}} the most {{challenging}} questions in astronomy to- day. Answering it requires a careful combination of observational and theoretical work to reliably determine the observed properties of cosmic bodies over large portions of the distant Universe on the one hand, and accurately model the physical processes driving their evolution on the other. Most importantly, it requires bringing together disparate multi-wavelength and multi-resolution spectro-photometric datasets in an homogeneous and well-characterized manner so that they are suitable for a rigorous statistical analysis. The Herschel Extragalactic Legacy Project (HELP) funded by the EC FP 7 SPACE program aims to achieve this goal by combining the expertise of optical, infrared and radio astronomers to provide a multi-wavelength database for the dis- tant Universe as an accessible value-added resource for the astronomical community. It will do so by bringing together multi-wavelength datasets covering the 1000 deg 2 mapped by Herschel extragalactic surveys and thus creating a <b>joint</b> lasting <b>legacy</b> from several ambitious sky surveys.

40|$|Flexibility {{must be the}} {{hallmark}} of air power. Against the unpredictable and dynamic threats of the 21 st century security environment, air operations must exhibit {{a higher degree of}} agility that enables air forces to quickly and effectively adapt and shift effort and tempo. Traditionally, industrial age threats generally demanded more firepower than flexibility. Air power planning has logically developed to maximize massing of forces and utilization of resources to attack large military and industrial formations. In response {{and in the absence of}} widely available computers and networks, complicated and centralized processes arose. Today, air power planning needs to retain the capability to meet large-scale general war requirements while also addressing the greater dynamism posed by a mix of combat and operations other than war. Ultimately, what is desired in the planning, execution and assessment cycle is for command intent to be fulfilled safely, effectively and efficiently. Networked systems provide potential opportunities to evolve <b>legacy</b> <b>joint</b> processes into a more robust, decentralized and self-synchronized effort. This paper outlines the theories and realities that have influenced air planning and future directions for reshaping air power into a more effective, efficient and agile force in the battlespace. i...|$|R
