5|$|Hamilton {{stepped up}} to be the team leader in 2003, with the goal of winning the Tour de France. He won Liège–Bastogne–Liège and was in <b>form</b> <b>when</b> he broke his {{collarbone}} in a pile-up on stage 1 of the Tour. He lost a lot of time. He made it up by winning a stage and finishing fourth, while his teammates Carlos Sastre and Jakob Piil also won stages.|$|E
5|$|Most {{molluscs}} with shells {{can produce}} pearls, {{but only the}} pearls of bivalves and some gastropods, whose shells are lined with nacre, are valuable. The best natural pearls are produced by marine pearl oysters, Pinctada margaritifera and Pinctada mertensi, which live in the tropical and subtropical waters of the Pacific Ocean. Natural pearls <b>form</b> <b>when</b> a small foreign object gets stuck between the mantle and shell.|$|E
5|$|Night clouds or {{noctilucent clouds}} are {{composed}} of tiny crystals of water ice up to 100nm in diameter and exist at a height of about , higher than any other clouds in Earth's atmosphere. Clouds in the Earth's lower atmosphere <b>form</b> <b>when</b> water collects on particles, but mesospheric clouds may form directly from water vapour in addition to forming on dust particles.|$|E

5|$|Surrounding Aristarchus {{are several}} smaller craters, {{many of which}} are {{probably}} secondary craters. Secondary craters <b>form</b> <b>when</b> large blocks ejected from the primary crater reimpact the surface at high velocities. By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing a letter {{on the side of the}} crater midpoint that is closest to the primary crater.|$|E
5|$|The HDF galaxies {{contained}} a considerably {{larger proportion of}} disturbed and irregular galaxies than the local universe; galaxy collisions and mergers were {{more common in the}} young universe as it was much smaller than today. It is believed that giant elliptical galaxies <b>form</b> <b>when</b> spirals and irregular galaxies collide.|$|E
5|$|The caps {{form from}} the top of the short stipe by the growth and {{expansion}} of a blunt margin and later as a thickening of the upper surface. Spines start to <b>form</b> <b>when</b> the cap hangs over the stipe slightly. They are white in many species, but become brown in maturity as the brown-colored spores accumulate on the surface.|$|E

5|$|Transformation {{into human}} form {{is said to}} be rare, and usually occurs at night. The encantado will often be seen running from a festa, despite protests from the others for it to stay, and can be seen by pursuers as it hurries to the river and reverts to dolphin <b>form.</b> <b>When</b> it is under human form, it wears a hat to hide its blowhole, which does not {{disappear}} with the shapeshift.|$|E
5|$|A bicycle kick's {{successful}} performance generally requires great {{skill and}} athleticism. The performer needs to maintain good <b>form</b> <b>when</b> executing the move, and must simultaneously exhibit exceptional {{accuracy and precision}} when striking the ball. Sports historian Richard Witzig recommends that footballers attempt executing a bicycle kick with a focused and determined state of mind. Due to the action's complexity, a successfully executed bicycle kick is notable and, according to sports journalist Elliott Turner, prone to awe audiences. Brazilian forward Pelé, one of the sport's renowned players, also considers the manoeuvre difficult and recalled having scored from it {{only a few times}} out of his 1,283 career goals.|$|E
5|$|A {{dust devil}} (also {{known as a}} whirlwind) resembles a tornado {{in that it is}} a {{vertical}} swirling column of air. However, they form under clear skies and are no stronger than the weakest tornadoes. They <b>form</b> <b>when</b> a strong convective updraft is formed near the ground on a hot day. If there is enough low level wind shear, the column of hot, rising air can develop a small cyclonic motion that can be seen near the ground. They are not considered tornadoes because they form during fair weather and are not associated with any clouds. However, they can, on occasion, result in major damage.|$|E

5|$|Another test {{known as}} a phototest is the most useful in {{identifying}} solar urticaria. In this test, one centimeter segments of skin are subject to varying amounts of UVA and UVB radiation {{in order to determine}} the specific dosage of the certain form of radiation that causes the urticaria to <b>form.</b> <b>When</b> testing for its less intense form (fixed solar urticaria), phototesting should be conducted only in the areas where the hives have appeared to avoid the possibility of getting false-negative results.|$|E
5|$|At birth {{the lungs}} are very undeveloped with only around one sixth of the alveoli {{of the adult}} lung present. The alveoli {{continue}} to form into early adulthood, {{and their ability to}} <b>form</b> <b>when</b> necessary is seen in the regeneration of the lung. Alveolar septa have a double capillary network instead of the single network of the developed lung. Only after the maturation of the capillary network can the lung enter a normal phase of growth. Following the early growth in numbers of alveoli there is another stage of the alveoli being enlarged.|$|E
5|$|Cardcaptor Sakura {{takes place}} in the fictional Japanese city of Tomoeda which is somewhere near Tokyo. Ten-year-old Sakura Kinomoto accidentally {{releases}} a set of magical cards known as Clow Cards from a book in her basement created and named after the sorcerer Clow Reed. Each card has its own unique ability and can assume an alternate <b>form</b> <b>when</b> activated. The guardian of the cards, Cerberus, emerges from the book and chooses Sakura to retrieve the missing cards. As she finds each card, she battles its magical personification and defeats it by sealing it away. Cerberus acts as her guide, while her best friend and second cousin, Tomoyo Daidouji films her exploits and provides her with battle costumes. Sakura's older brother Toya Kinomoto watches over her, while pretending that he is unaware of what is going on.|$|E

5|$|Elemental iodine is {{slightly}} soluble in water, with one gram dissolving in 3450ml at 20°C and 1280ml at 50°C; potassium iodide may {{be added to}} increase solubility via formation of triiodide ions, among other polyiodides. Nonpolar solvents such as hexane and carbon tetrachloride provide a higher solubility. Polar solutions, such as aqueous solutions, are brown, reflecting the role of these solvents as Lewis bases; on the other hand, nonpolar solutions are violet, the color of iodine vapour. Charge-transfer complexes <b>form</b> <b>when</b> iodine is dissolved in polar solvents, hence changing the colour. Iodine is violet when dissolved in carbon tetrachloride and saturated hydrocarbons but deep brown in alcohols and amines, solvents that form charge-transfer adducts.|$|E
5|$|Groups often <b>form</b> <b>when</b> {{individuals}} {{converge on}} a food source, whereupon {{a feeding frenzy}} may occur. This seems to be triggered not by blood in the water or by bloodlust, but by the species' highly strung and goal-directed nature (conserving energy between infrequent feeding opportunities {{when it is not}} slowly plying the open ocean). The oceanic whitetip is a competitive, opportunistic predator that exploits the resource at hand, rather than avoiding trouble in favour of a possibly easier future meal.|$|E
5|$|Icings – Roofs {{must also}} be {{designed}} to avoid ice dams, which result from meltwater running under the snow {{on the roof and}} freezing at the eave. Ice dams on roofs <b>form</b> <b>when</b> accumulated snow on a sloping roof melts and flows down the roof, under the insulating blanket of snow, until it reaches below freezing temperature air, typically at the eaves. When the meltwater reaches the freezing air, ice accumulates, forming a dam, and snow that melts later cannot drain properly through the dam. Ice dams may result in damaged building materials or in damage or injury when the ice dam falls off or from attempts to remove ice dams. The melting results from heat passing through the roof under the highly insulating layer of snow.|$|E

Miller had a quiet match, scoring 40 {{and taking}} one wicket on a spin-friendly pitch as Australia secured another innings victory, but showed {{he was in}} prime batting <b>form</b> <b>when</b> he {{returned}} to the Sheffield Shield. Playing against New South Wales, he hammered three sixes in one over and made 153 of a 271-run partnership with Merv Harvey in just over three hours, setting up an innings victory. Bill Ponsford said that it was the hardest hitting he had ever seen. The Third Test was Miller's first in his home town. He had a mediocre game in a drawn match, scoring 33 and 34, and taking two wickets.|$|E
5|$|In {{those who}} are {{otherwise}} healthy, {{there is little evidence}} that supplements have any benefits with respect to cancer or heart disease. Vitamin A and E supplements not only provide no health benefits for generally healthy individuals, but they may increase mortality, though the two large studies that support this conclusion included smokers for whom it was already known that beta-carotene supplements can be harmful. While other findings suggest that vitamin E toxicity is limited to only a specific <b>form</b> <b>when</b> taken in excess.|$|E
5|$|Independent {{lines of}} {{evidence}} from Type Ia supernovae and the CMB {{imply that the}} universe today is dominated by a mysterious form of energy known as dark energy, which apparently permeates all of space. The observations suggest 73% of the total energy density of today's universe is in this <b>form.</b> <b>When</b> the universe was very young, it was likely infused with dark energy, but with less space and everything closer together, gravity predominated, and it was slowly braking the expansion. But eventually, after numerous billion years of expansion, the growing abundance of dark energy caused {{the expansion of the}} universe to slowly begin to accelerate.|$|E
