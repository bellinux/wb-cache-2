25|$|Including fish as {{a regular}} part of a {{balanced}} diet has been shown to help the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis – a painful condition that causes joints to swell up, reducing strength and mobility. Studies also show that sufferers feel less stiff and sore in the morning <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>keep</b> their fish oil intake topped up. Recent research has also found a link between omega-3 fats and a slowing down in the wearing of cartilage that leads to osteoarthritis, opening the door for more research into whether eating more fish could help prevent the disease.|$|E
500|$|After {{one season}} at Willem II, Overmars signed for Ajax in July 1992. Both clubs {{settled on a}} {{transfer}} fee of ƒ2.5million, after Ajax's initial bid of ƒ1.5million was rejected. Manager Louis van Gaal was very fond of Overmars beforehand and described him as a [...] "multi-functional player". Overmars' debut came in a 3–0 win against Dordrecht on 16 August 1992. His first goal for Ajax was away to RKC Waalwijk in October and he scored a further seven goals in the 1992–93 season. Several teams chose to combat Overmars' threat with heavy tackles; he detested this, adding, [...] "I do not fall on purpose, but <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>keep</b> kicking, I would sometimes give something back in return." [...] Ajax finished the campaign third in the league; their form in the final few months was described as [...] "maddening" [...] by football writer David Winner, as they defeated eventual champions Feyenoord by five goals, but dropped points to [...] "minnows like MVV Maastricht". The team lost to Auxerre in the quarter-finals of the UEFA Cup, but did not end the season trophyless – they beat Heerenveen 6–2 to win the KNVB Cup. Overmars scored two goals in the final.|$|E

2500|$|Asked {{what she}} hoped to achieve on her spaceflight, Ansari said, [...] "I hope to inspire everyone—especially young people, women, and young girls all over the world, and in Middle Eastern {{countries}} that do not provide women with the same opportunities as men—to not give up their dreams and to pursue them... It may seem impossible to them at times. But I believe they can realize their dreams <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>keep</b> it in their hearts, nurture it, and look for opportunities and make those opportunities happen." [...] The day before her departure, she was interviewed on Iran national television for the astronomy show Night's Sky. The hosts wished her success and thanked her on behalf of Iranians. Ansari in return, thanked them.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{aggressive}} and will defend rich food sources from other nectarivores; {{due to its}} size, it is generally dominant over other species of hummingbirds. Even much larger birds are attacked by diving at them when they perch; particularly when breeding the swallow-tailed hummingbird will go and [...] "dive-bomb" [...] birds twice its own length or more, such as Campo flickers (Colaptes campestris), curl-crested jays (Cyanocorax cristatellus) or smooth-billed anis (Crotophaga ani), until they have enough and leave. Disturbed by much larger birds such as Guira cuckoos (Guira guira) or hawks, it will usually just give warning calls, but a female swallow-tailed hummingbird has been observed to attack a Swainson's hawk (Buteo swainsonii) [...] weighing {{more than a hundred}} times as much as the hummingbird [...] in mid-air. Warning calls are also given at mammalian carnivores and humans, though in urban environment this hummingbird may tolerate human observers for prolonged time, even when nesting, <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>keep</b> a distance of 10 meters or so.|$|E
2500|$|In 2000, O'Donnell {{partnered with}} the {{publishers}} of McCall's {{to revamp the}} magazine as Rosie's McCall's (or, more commonly, Rosie). The magazine was launched as a competitor to fellow talk show hostess Oprah Winfrey's monthly magazine O. Rosie covered issues including breast cancer, foster care and other matters of concern to O'Donnell. In the September 2000 issue, she shared that [...] "she has struggled with depression her entire life" [...] and decided to start medications when she realized her fears were affecting her family. With a strong start and a circulation close to 3.5 million, things looked promising but the magazine stumbled as conflicts emerged between O'Donnell and the editors. The contract gave O'Donnell control over editorial process and editorial staff but veto power remained with publisher Gruner+Jahr USA. O'Donnell quit the magazine in September 2002, following a dispute over editorial control. [...] "If I'm {{going to have my}} name and my brand on the corner of a magazine, it has to be my vision" [...] she told People. Rosie magazine folded in 2003. In late 2003, O'Donnell and the publishers each sued the other for breach of contract. The publishers claimed that, by removing herself from the magazine's publication, she was in breach of contract. The trial received considerable press coverage. O'Donnell would often give brief press interviews outside of the courtroom responding to various allegations. Of note was a former magazine colleague and breast cancer survivor who testified that O'Donnell said to her on the phone that people who lie [...] "get sick and they get cancer. <b>If</b> <b>they</b> <b>keep</b> lying, they get it again". O'Donnell apologized the next day and stated [...] "I'm sorry I hurt her the way I did, that was not my intention." [...] The judge dismissed the case, ruling that neither side should receive damages.|$|E
