5000|$|The {{combination}} {{of being an}} actor and a parent proved to be frustrating at times for von Furstenberg, who believed that the two roles sometimes blended together in daily life and posed special challenges both in and outside the home. In 1972, six years after her divorce from Guy Vincent, she expressed her views on the subject in a personal essay titled [...] "Actors Are Not the Only Ones Who Act", {{which was published in}} The New York Times on September 24, 1972. [...] In one portion of her essay she shares the following: ...I have gotten my way by 'acting' in some very significant moments in my life when perhaps {{in the long run it}} would have been better if I hadn't gotten my way...One of the most frustrating drawbacks of being an actor‐parent is to have your children accuse you of acting when you're being perfectly sincere. Of course, they've seen you being 'perfectly sincere' on stage so for the poor things I guess the better you are the more confusing it is for them (and <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>explain</b> <b>that</b> both are real and yet not the same?). Ultimately your actions must bear out the truth of what you say to them. After a prolonged period of being single, von Furstenberg finally married for the second time in 1984, then to New York real-estate broker John J. Reynolds. They remained together until his death in 1994. [...] She lived another twenty-one years. On April 21, 2015, von Furstenberg died at her home in Manhattan at the age of 83 from complications attributed to Alzheimer's disease.|$|E
40|$|AbstractConvincing {{people to}} try {{something}} new, strange and expensive is not easy. Convincing them to embrace something that they fear and struggle to understand is almost impossible. Many people seem to fear CO 2 Capture and Storage (CCS) and remain skeptical that it will evolve into a huge opportunity to control global CO 2 emissions. It needs to be explained in terms normal people understand. Not everyone speaks the same language or starts from the same point of reference. This effort is by a high school junior using common language and images familiar {{to me and my}} friends to visualize basic science relationships related to the storage part of CCS: soccer balls and playing fields. It considers key components of well systems and makes comparisons with the behavior of natural phenomena like ant hills enduring in a light rain storm, and compares that with their fate when attacked by a little brother with a water hose. It asks questions about the dimensions of the systems, and how key components might work. It’s about putting CO 2 underground, but <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>explain</b> <b>that</b> with soccer balls?Instinctively, the big question is will the CO 2 stay underground? What will happen to it with time? Why won’t it just come right back out a well like a straw? What about all those wells anyway? Should people get hyped-up about them? Aren’t they filled with cement? Think, CO 2 in water makes an acid. What will that acid do? Is it about pumping and sucking fluids thru barriers as strong as steel instead of allowing them to flow freely in a hose? Stay tuned and read on. Full disclosure: This paper is not exactly cutting edge science; it offers no new data, and tests no hypothesis although it makes some original calculations. It’s about communication and visualization, so it deliberately dodges some important details about well construction techniques, reaction rates, kinetics and the multiphase behavior of supercritical CO 2, even in the same reservoir. It touches on fundamentals of reservoir porosity and permeability, and even subsurface fluid flow but just barely. Just enough to be cool, stressed, over pressured and dense phased, more or less like the injected gas we care so much about...|$|E

40|$|Almost every {{theory of}} vagueness shares {{at least one}} feature: it uses, {{and in most cases}} heavily relies on, some kind of {{normative}} predicate (or predicates) in its metalanguage. Metalinguistic normative predicates are discussed chiefly by supervaluationists and other defenders of higher-order vagueness. According to this group of theorists, the existence of higher-order vagueness depends on and is explained by the vagueness of predicates like “definitely x”. However, {{the question of how to}} characterize these predicates has wider interest. The vagueness of metalinguistic normative predicates may seem particularly worrisome to theorists who insist that the metalanguage used to describe a theory of vagueness be precise.

40|$|Whitman’s Leaves of Grass, {{responding}} to and magnifying an initial sense of recursiveness in Whitman’s work. The {{result is a}} novel in three separate iterations that engages the work of Walt Whitman and several concepts of chaos theory in powerful ways. In each section of Specimen Days, the recurring main character Luke is educated through chaos and through Whitman, making this novel a productive site for {{an examination of the}} intersections of literature, chaos theory, and curriculum. In this study, chaos theory informs my reading of curriculum in the novel, and I find that the novel itself could be characterized as an example of chaotic reading practices, with significant curricular implications. In the words of N. Katherine Hayles, chaos here “serves as a crossroads, a juncture”(1991, p. 2), connecting multiple interpretations of literature and curriculum within and surrounding the works of Cunningham and Whitman. Connecting Chaos and Literature: Repetition and Recursion Before any analysis of the chaotic features of Specimen Days, I {{think it is important to}} establish some reasoning and notes on possible methods for drawing connections between literature and chaos or complexity in general. First, why make these 1 connections? What can this sort of analysis show? Second, if mapping chaos theory to literature does not involve a system of direct equivalencies, what do we do with the incompatibilities that arise? Here, I look particularly at the use of the terms repetition, recursion, and iteration in mathematics/chaos theory, curriculum, and literature.

5000|$|If {{we want to}} {{consider}} how actors will interact, we must look at the system within which they interact. This isn't a new concept; economists look at structural constraints (e.g. capitalism vs socialism, I guess), political scientists argue that presidents will behave differently from prime ministers, and so on. Waltz begins by looking at domestic political structures and sees three important characteristics: The principle by which the system is ordered (what form of hierarchical structure is in place), the functions that each unit fulfills (presidential vs parliamentary, etc.), and each unit's capacity/ability to act. By analogy, Waltz extends these three principles to the international system. The ordering principle is anarchy; if this changed, inter-unit interactions would also change. In anarchy, different units exist in a self-help system; there is therefore no functional differentiation among them. So the two relevant characteristics {{of the international system}} are anarchy and relative capacity (power). By analogy, Waltz argues that microeconomic thinking should explain how states will act. States in the international system are like firms in a domestic economy. Every state has the same fundamental interest: to survive. Even if it wants to do other things, it can't do them unless it survives. are there higher needs? <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>explain</b> what a state will do if its survival isn't threatened? Can you use this model to explain trade, or environmental treaties, and so on? Waltz argues that states are the only important actors in this model. He recognizes that other actors exist, but says they don't matter. He uses an economic analogy to justify this: If all firms are equally sized, they all matter. If the market is dominated by a few large firms, however, then economic models need focus on these. Similarly, since states are the [...] "large firms," [...] models can disregard the insignificant [...] "small firms" [...] (NGOs, IGOs, etc.).
