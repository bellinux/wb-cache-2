500|$|A second {{version of}} the video (known as the Sugar Lumps version), which adds the Sugar Lumps—a satirical {{version of the}} Spice Girls played by Kathy Burke, Dawn French, Llewella Gideon, Lulu, and Jennifer Saunders—was filmed for the [...] "Red Nose Day" [...] of the 1997 Comic Relief, {{one of the two}} {{high-profile}} telethon events held in the United Kingdom. The video starts with the Sugar Lumps as schoolgirls dreaming of becoming Spice Girls, and ends with them joining the group on stage, while dancing and lip-synching the song. Halliwell commented about the shoot: [...] "The women were all really warm and funny and nice. The freakiest thing about it was seeing Jennifer Saunders. She looked <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>me</b> and everyone said they thought she was me. It was alsolutely bizarre–the make-up, everything. It was scary–like, do I really do that?".|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} based on actual recent {{research}} and involved much collaboration among the series' different departments. For the scene in which they remove the victim's eyeball, the special effects crew created a mold based on actress Elizabeth Stanley's head. Using plaster to make a prosthetic, they [...] "drilled out the eyeball and sculpt it open and [...] {{through a series of}} molds." [...] Stanley stated that [...] "it's really cool to see the head because it really does look <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>me,</b> even though it's very gruesome because the eyeball's popping out." [...] The prop department rigged a weapon which they called a [...] "photon gun"; according to prop master Peter Gelfman, this gun {{was based on}} real devices employed in airport security that look through people's clothing for concealed weapons. VFX Supervisor Christopher Scollard explained that for the eye's last vision, they used [...] "a lot of actual photographic reference on the set and on the location," [...] which they then used to [...] "take that imagery and composite it into the various computer monitors and displays in the lab." ...|$|E

[...] Breckenridge often does celebrity impressions on the show, such as Sarah Jessica Parker and Renée Zellweger. She also had roles on MacFarlane's web series Cavalcade of Cartoon Comedy.

500|$|In April 1914, Sibelius mailed {{the score}} and parts to the United States, calling the piece [...] (this {{intermediate}} {{version of the}} tone poem is {{commonly referred to as}} the [...] "Yale" [...] version). On 12 and 20April 1914, Parker wrote on behalf of Stoeckel, expanding upon the initial agreement: Sibelius's American patron now wished him to travel to and conduct a program of his music at the Norfolk festival; as compensation, Sibelius would receive $1,200, as well as an honorary doctorate of music from Yale University. Although he already had sent the manuscript to Norfolk, Sibelius was not satisfied with the score and immediately began to revise the piece, eventually opting for a complete overhaul ("Isn't it <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>me</b> to rework the tone poem—at the moment I am ablaze with it."). Although Sibelius was prone to revising his compositions, such effort was usually undertaken when preparing a piece for publication or after having heard it first performed in concert. With respect to the Yale version, it is possible the invitation to attend the music festival in person prompted Sibelius to [...] "reassess" [...] the tone poem with a more critical eye.|$|E
500|$|On 29 January 2005 Higgins {{performed}} with other local musicians including Nick Cave and Powderfinger at the WaveAid fundraising concert in the Sydney Cricket Ground. The concert raised A$2.3 million for four charities supporting {{the victims of}} the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. In March Higgins performed at the MTV Australia Awards and won the prize for 'Breakthrough Artist of the Year'. The following month she released her third single, [...] "The Special Two", which was a radio hit and reached No.2. [...] "The Special Two" [...] was released on an EP which included her cover of the Skyhooks song, [...] "You <b>Just</b> <b>Like</b> <b>Me</b> Cos I'm Good In Bed", recorded for Triple J's 30th anniversary. The song had been the first track played on Triple J when it launched (as Double J) in 1975. In May, Higgins won the 'Song of the Year' and 'Breakthrough' awards for [...] "Scar" [...] from the Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA). She continued touring in mid-2005 and released her fourth single, [...] "The Sound of White", in August. In September she played a sold out performance at the Vanguard in Sydney with the proceeds going to charity. She was nominated for seven more ARIAs and in October won 'Album of the Year', 'Best Pop Release', 'Breakthrough Artist– Album' and 'Highest Selling Album' (all for The Sound of White) and 'Best Female Artist' (for [...] "Scar"). She teamed up with fellow ARIA award-winning singer Ben Lee in late 2005 for a national tour.|$|E
500|$|The {{season was}} well {{received}} amongst critics, especially {{in regards to}} the episodes with Kevin Smith and the storylines on oral sex and the school shooting. The Palm Beach Post said the series [...] "is told from a teenager's point of view since the writers have no interest in appealing to a broad-based demographic like the writers on, say, Fox's The O.C. ... it connects with teens on their level", though it was still [...] "surprised Jay used the graphic oral sex term you'd hear in just about every high school hallway in America", that word being [...] "blow-job". The Boston Herald said [...] "it is important for teens to learn about sexually transmitted diseases and the cost of unprotected sex ... and should help parents begin conversations with their own children". PopMatters's Jodie Janella Horn described Degrassi: The Next Generation as [...] "the most unnervingly accurate series ever of the high school genre". Another comparison was made between Degrassi: The Next Generation and The O.C., saying [...] "The O.C. will never remind me of anything in my life", while the events in the two-part episode [...] "Voices Carry" [...] with [...] "hotel room trashing, projectile launching, fist fighting at weddings bi-polar loon Craig , was like an actual scene from my actual teenage life and <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>me,</b> Ashley thinks they're going to pull through it together". AfterElton.com, a website that focuses on the portrayal of gay and bisexual men in the media praised the series for [...] "not only focusing on gay teens, but it showcases gay sex, and relationships. By not stereotyping [...] they are helping thousands of confused and shameful teenagers feel accepted, in Canada and America alike." [...] Ben Neihart called Degrassi: The Next Generation [...] "tha Best Teen TV N da WRLD!" [...] (the best teen TV in the world) in a six-page article in The New York Times. Commenting that [...] "the explosive-issue-per-capita ratio is seriously out of whack", he admitted that [...] "the teen-diary attention to microissues (zits, periods, parents' night) gives the episodes a peculiar authenticity no matter how outrageous their story lines".|$|E

The reformation collapsed when the single did not chart {{well and the}} tour was downgraded to the pub circuit.|$|E
2500|$|Steve Earle wrote a {{song about}} McCulloch on his album Train a Comin'. [...] "Ben McCulloch" [...] is sung from the {{perspective}} of a foot soldier in McCulloch's infantry, marched from Texas to fight in Missouri and growing to hate both McCulloch and the Civil War. [...] Its chorus and refrain is [...] "Goddamn you, Ben McCulloch / I hate you more than any man alive // And when you die, you'll be a foot soldier <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>me</b> / in the Devil's infantry." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{success of}} the album was also due to support by a new pop music {{television}} show Countdown on national public broadcaster ABC Television, rather than promotion by commercial radio. [...] "Horror Movie" [...] was the first song played on the first colour transmission of Countdown in early 1975. Despite the radio ban, the ABC's newly established 24-hour rock music station Double Jay chose the album's fifth track, the provocatively titled [...] "You <b>Just</b> <b>Like</b> <b>Me</b> Cos I'm Good in Bed", as its first ever broadcast on 19 January.|$|E

2500|$|With Australian {{commercial}} success achieved, Skyhooks {{turned to the}} US market. Gudinski announced a $1.5 million deal with Mercury Records/Phonogram Records, which released a modified international version of Ego Is Not a Dirty Word with [...] "Horror Movie" [...] and [...] "You <b>Just</b> <b>Like</b> <b>Me</b> Cos I'm Good in Bed" [...] from their first Australian album replacing two tracks. A US tour followed in MarchApril 1976, but critics described them as imitators of Kiss due to the similarity of Symons' make-up and stage act to that of Gene Simmons, and despite limited success in Boston, Massachusetts and Jacksonville, Florida they failed to make in-roads into the general US market.|$|E

Li then tried to laugh it off and said [...] "maybe in 2017 they will have one-person-one-vote to choose the chief executive, I probably just said it a little early." [...] Li was, however, criticised by Xinhua for not being unambiguous in {{his opposition to the}} Umbrella movement protests and his support for Leung.

2500|$|Fifteen-year-old Whitley and 16-year-old Skaggs were {{discovered}} in Ft. Gay, West Virginia by Ralph Stanley who was 45 minutes late for a show due to a flat tire.

However it was Whitley and Skaggs, who [...] "sounded <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>me</b> and Carter in the early days". The two soon joined Ralph's band. Whitley became lead singer for Stanley in 1974. [...] Whitley also played with J.D. Crowe & the New South in the mid-1970s. During this period, he established himself {{as one of the most}} versatile and talented lead singers in bluegrass. His singing was heavily influenced by Carter Stanley and Lefty Frizzell.

2500|$|For Skyhooks, the {{replacement}} of Hill by Strachan was a pivotal moment, as Strachan had remarkable vocal skills, and a magnetic stage and screen presence. Alongside Macainsh's lyrics, another facet of the group was the twin-guitar sound of Starkie and Symons. Adopting elements of glam rock in their presentation, and lyrics that presented frank depictions of the social life of young Australia in the 1970s, the band shocked conservative middle Australia with their outrageous (for the time) costumes, make-up, lyrics, and on-stage activities. A 1.2 metre (4ft) high mushroom-shaped phallus was confiscated by Adelaide police after a performance. Six of the ten tracks on their debut album, Living in the 70's, were banned by the Federation of Australian Commercial Broadcasters for their sex and drug references, [...] "Toorak Cowboy", [...] "Whatever Happened to the Revolution?", [...] "You <b>Just</b> <b>Like</b> <b>Me</b> Cos I'm Good in Bed", [...] "Hey What's the Matter", [...] "Motorcycle Bitch" [...] and [...] "Smut". Much of the group's success derived from its distinctive repertoire, mostly penned by bass guitarist Macainsh, with an occasional additional song from Symonswho wrote [...] "Smut" [...] and performed its lead vocals. Although Skyhooks were not the first Australian rock band to write songs in a local settingrather than ditties about love or songs about New York or other foreign landsthey {{were the first to}} become commercially successful doing so. Skyhooks songs addressed teenage issues including buying drugs ("Carlton (Lygon Street Limbo)"), suburban sex ("Balwyn Calling"), the gay scene ("Toorak Cowboy") and loss of girlfriends ("Somewhere in Sydney") by namechecking Australian locales.

2500|$|The {{song was}} then {{reworked}} by Nolan Lambroza who increased its tempo. Initially, {{there was no}} plan for the song to feature another artist. A fan of hip hop, Gomez felt constrained from incorporating the genre and collaborating with rappers on her previous released due to her age and young fanbase. However, for her second album, she reconsidered. Also a fan of R, the singer noticed that [...] "Good for You" [...] shared similarities to the genres, specifically in tempo and {{felt that it was}} the sound the song should have. At the time, she was also a fan of rapper ASAP Rocky's 2015 album At. Long. Last. A$AP — whose love she cited as [...] "influent" [...] in her decision to collaborate with him —, and thought [...] "Good for You" [...] had a vibe that was suited to Rocky's music. The rapper's participation happened organically; Gomez texted Rocky and sent him the song after receiving his contact details through Lambroza and her management. Rocky responded positively, having [...] "literally loved" [...] it and recording a verse the next day at Downtown Studios in New York City, New York. His vocals were produced by frequent collaborator Hector Delgado. This was the first time Gomez had collaborated with a rapper on one of her tracks. She also insisted that Rocky should experiment with the song beyond a rap verse. Consequently, he and Delgado co-produced it and added beats, instruments, as well additional bass and snares. Although this is a pop song, Rocky still used the same production process from his music. In an interview for MTV News, he explained: [...] "You just go in. Go for the kill. I mean, it wasn't the type of song you try to go into... It was <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>me</b> telling her, you sure you wanna go here with me? I gotta change the beat. I gotta talk my shit. My jiggy shit". Talking about Rocky's contribution, Gomez said: [...] "I was totally prepared for a 'No, I'm good, thank you', it was so great and he changed some of the production of the song, which made it better, and I let him have like full-on freedom with everything, it was really fun".|$|E
