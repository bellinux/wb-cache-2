40|$|In this paper, an {{approach}} for 3 D motion estimation of <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>shoulders</b> of persons in videophone sequences is presented. Since <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>shoulders</b> are linked {{together by the}} neck, constraints for the motion of <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>shoulders</b> exist which are exploited to improve the motion estimation. In this paper, the human neck joint is modelled by a spherical joint between <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> its 3 D position is calculated. Then, rotation and translation of the <b>shoulders</b> are estimated <b>and</b> propagated to the head. Finally, a rotation of the head around the neck joint is estimated. The presented approach {{is applied to the}} videophone sequences Akiyo and Claire. Compared with {{an approach}} without using a neck joint, anatomically correct positions of <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>shoulders</b> are estimated. 1.
