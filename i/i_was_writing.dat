Even the word Sarah he could not pronounce at first, but had to spell it, and I would pronounce it for him.|$|E

Bannon has said she knows {{the concerns of the}} women who are uncomfortable with the themes of her books: [...] "I can understand that; they weren't there. To them some of it looks negative and some of it looks depressing. Although I didn't feel that way. I always felt excited when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>writing</b> them." ...|$|E

Speaking of her artistic contributions to the magazine in 2011, Harvey said: [...] "the first opportunity I ever had to show any work was in this magazine.

500|$|Jam and Lewis {{also asked}} the boy band 98 Degrees to join Carey and Joe on the track, as they wanted male harmonies. Carey talked about the {{collaboration}} {{in an interview with}} MTV. [...] "It's like when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>writing</b> 'One Sweet Day'. It really cried out for a group to be singing with me and for a strong male-female thing in terms of going back and forth, vocally. So you know, we just naturally came together." [...] The vocals were recorded at Capri Digital Studios, Capri, Italy and Avatar Studios, New York City. The track was mixed by Supa Engineer Duo at Right Track Recording and mastered by Herb Powers.|$|E

And I also wanted to work with Massive Attack. So obviously, he was on the list. Nellee was the last person I worked with, and it wasn't until then that I got a grip of what the sound of the whole record was, so I had to go back and redo a lot.|$|E
500|$|According to Weiser, Gekko's {{style of}} {{speaking}} {{was inspired by}} Stone. [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>writing</b> some of the dialogue I would listen to Oliver {{on the phone and}} sometimes he talks very rapid-fire, the way Gordon Gekko does". Stone cites as influences on his approach to business, the novels of Upton Sinclair, Sinclair Lewis and Victor Hugo, and the films of Paddy Chayefsky because they were able to make a complicated subject clear to the audience. Stone set the film in 1985 because insider trading scandals culminated in 1985 and 1986. This led to anachronisms in the script, including a reference to the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, which had not yet occurred.|$|E
500|$|Miles Morales {{was created}} by writer Brian Michael Bendis and artist Sara Pichelli. Bendis' {{thoughts}} about the character, {{and the way he}} looked in his first appearance, were heavily influenced by African American actor Donald Glover's appearance in Spider-Man pajamas in [...] "Anthropology 101", the second season premiere of the television comedy series Community. This was a reference to an unsuccessful online campaign that attempted to secure Glover an audition for the lead role in the 2012 film The Amazing Spider-Man. Bendis said of Glover, [...] "He looked fantastic! I saw him in the costume and thought, 'I would like to read that book.' So I was glad <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>writing</b> that book." ...|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Shave Magazine, Ben Gibbard commented on his song writing saying that he [...] "never sit down to write an album number one. I just kind of sit down and write songs and the theme kind of makes itself apparent. But I would never say <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>writing</b> about searching for something as much as just trying to document with every song where I am in that moment when I’m writing that song. If a theme kind of makes itself apparent in a record, it {{has more to do}} with the fact that just what’s been on my mind recently. So I guess clearly I have been and was and am, but it was never a conscious decision." ...|$|E

[...] However, when asked about the video, Tarantino said, [...] "I don't know. I've been asked to direct commercials and music videos, Madonna and Jay-Z wanted me to direct their videos, but I refused. I'm not interested, just as I'm not interested in commercials. If it's not to make movies, I don't want to be on set." ...|$|E

[...] The singer explained that he was so absorbed by the song that, in one instance, he did not notice that his car had caught fire as he drove down a freeway with a friend until a passing motorcyclist informed him. Jackson noted: [...] "The kid probably saved our lives." ...|$|E

Rowling has said that, of all the actors in the film series, Lynch has had the most influence on how her character was subsequently written. In 2012, she told Charlie Rose that when composing the final books, [...] "I saw her. [...] got in my head. I even heard her voice when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>writing</b> Luna." ...|$|E
