5|$|The law {{was used}} {{in at least one}} attempt to prosecute a non-Christian. In 1658 a Jew named Jacob Lumbrozo was accused of blasphemy after saying that Jesus was not the son of God and that the miracles {{described}} in the New Testament were conjuring tricks. Lumbrozo did not deny <b>having</b> <b>said</b> such things, but argued that he had only been responding to questions asked of him. He was held for trial but the case was later dismissed, and he was given full citizenship as a condition of the restoration of Calvert's rule following the English Civil War.|$|E
5|$|Manning {{was deeply}} {{affected}} by the sudden death in 1977 of Jerry Slattery, her lover and confidant {{for more than a}} quarter of a century. Manning's last years were also made difficult by physical deterioration; arthritis increasingly affected her, leading to hip replacements in 1976 and in 1979 and she suffered poor health related to amoebic dysentery caught in the Middle East. Manning began work on the final novel in The Levant Trilogy, The Sum of Things, in which Harriet agrees to sail home to the UK, but <b>having</b> <b>said</b> goodbye to Guy, changes her mind. The novel describes Harriet's travels in Syria, Lebanon and Palestine, observes Guy's supposed widowerhood in Cairo after he hears of the sinking of Harriet's ship, and follows Simon Boulderstone's injury during the battle of El Alamein and recovery.|$|E
5|$|The {{question}} of supply—let me {{deal with it}} this way. I generally believe if a government is elected to power in the lower House and has the numbers and can maintain the numbers in the lower House, it is entitled to expect that it will govern for the three-year term unless quite extraordinary events intervene... <b>Having</b> <b>said</b> that... if we do make up our minds at some stage that the Government is so reprehensible that an Opposition must use whatever power is available to it, then I'd {{want to find a}} situation in which Mr. Whitlam woke up one morning finding the decision had been made and finding that he had been caught with his pants well and truly down.|$|E

[...] "What I <b>have</b> <b>said,</b> I <b>have</b> <b>said</b> to yourself, {{and not to}} others; {{and what}} I <b>have</b> <b>said,</b> I <b>have</b> <b>said</b> in answer to {{questions}} asked by yourself." [...] Then the Doctor apologised with what grace he could. But {{when he left the}} house his heart was still bitter against Mr. Puddicombe.|$|R

5|$|Twelve years later, {{the snow}} shark {{has become a}} town legend. The town's mayor, Shawn Overman, is {{informed}} when two residents are killed by the shark, and he and Sheriff Donald Chapman hold a town meeting. During the meeting, one of the residents, Mike Evans, claims that the killings were caused by the shark, despite him <b>having</b> <b>said</b> to have killed the creature seven years earlier. Against Chapman's warnings, he sets out to kill the beast once more. That night, Chapman and his son Ethan argue about Ethan finding a job and they mention Ethan's mother's death. Ethan leaves to drink beer outside with his friend Doug, and is killed by the shark while urinating. The next day, {{with the rest of}} the police force already at the scene, a distraught Chapman sees Ethan's corpse and questions Doug about the incident. When Doug claims that Ethan's death was caused by a shark, Chapman believes him and prepares to set out to kill it.|$|E
25|$|However, Zhvania's {{family members}} have {{questioned}} the official version of the death, with Goga Zhvania <b>having</b> <b>said</b> that {{he was sure that}} his brother was assassinated. In March 2006 interview with the Washington Post Georgia's ex-president Eduard Shevardnadze also said that he believed Zhvania was murdered.|$|E

She later confirmed that she would retire {{at the end of}} the 2007 season.|$|E
5000|$|The {{film has}} {{received}} a mixed critical reception. According to Rotten Tomatoes, it has received one positive and two negative reviews. [...] Jessica Mellor at the News of the World <b>has</b> <b>said</b> the film is [...] "absolutely excellent entertainment...a startling and scary cheeky treat". Video World <b>has</b> <b>said</b> that the film is [...] "a rampaging, monster-packed, jugular-piercing fear flick". Impact <b>has</b> <b>said</b> that the film has [...] "laughs, loves & lizards from hell...what more could you ask for?!". Samhain <b>has</b> <b>said</b> [...] "size doesn't matter...these lizards are lethal", and Starburst <b>has</b> <b>said</b> there is [...] "gore galore in this intriguing creature-feature".

25|$|Echoing Justice O'Connor's {{point from}} the U.S. case, the ruling in Estrada vs. Escritor {{went on to}} quote her as <b>having</b> <b>said</b> that strict {{scrutiny}} is appropriate for free exercise challenges because “he compelling interest test reflects the First Amendment’s mandate of preserving religious liberty to the fullest extent possible in a pluralistic society.|$|E
25|$|If one dines {{just before}} the end of Shabbat, one should wait until after <b>having</b> <b>said</b> the blessing for fire (part of the Havdalah ceremony) before saying the Birkat Hamazon.

25|$|In general, the {{atmosphere}} at King's {{is considered to be}} a little easier than that of other colleges to integrate into if you come from a working class or minority background. <b>Having</b> <b>said</b> this, a survey conducted by Varsity Newspaper in January 2009 revealed that the average parental income of students who participated in the survey at King's was very slightly higher than the university average.|$|E

25|$|In early 2011, {{eight of}} the more {{prominent}} editorial and technology staff members left AOL {{to build a new}} gadget site with CEO Jim Bankoff at SB Nation. On leaving, Joshua Topolsky, former Editor-in-chief, is quoted <b>having</b> <b>said,</b> “We have been working on blogging technology that was developed in 2003, we haven’t made a hire since I started running the site, and I thought we could be more successful elsewhere”.|$|E
25|$|On the {{afternoon}} of 17 January 2013, the Algerian Special Intervention Group began {{an assault on the}} complex using helicopter gunships and heavy weapons. Algerian commanders explained they launched the assault because the gunmen had demanded to be allowed to take the hostages abroad. The Mauritanian news agency ANI said the assault came while the terrorists were attempting to move hostages by vehicle. An Irish engineer who survived is reported as <b>having</b> <b>said</b> he saw four trucks of hostages being blown up by the Algerian forces. Hostages in two other SUVs were freed by the Algerian forces.|$|E
25|$|After David Cameron {{announced}} {{his intention to}} resign as Prime Minister, with his successor now {{likely to be in}} office by September 2016, Gove was not a candidate, <b>having</b> <b>said</b> in the past that he had no interest in becoming Prime Minister. Instead, he was seen as a strong, highly influential supporter of Boris Johnson for that role. In a move that surprised most political analysts, Gove withdrew his support for Johnson on 30 June 2016, hours before the deadline, without any previous notice to Johnson and {{announced his}} own candidacy in the Conservative Party (UK) leadership election, 2016. Subsequently, Johnson declined to run.|$|E

25|$|After {{two years}} had passed and Tewodros had not {{received}} a reply, he imprisoned Cameron, together with all the British subjects in Ethiopia and various other Europeans, {{in an attempt to}} get the queen's attention. His prisoners included a missionary named Mr. Stern, who had previously published a book in Europe describing Tewodros as a barbaric, cruel, unstable usurper. When Tewodros saw this book, he became violently angry, pulled a gun on Stern, and had to be restrained from killing the missionary. Tewodros also received reports from abroad that foreign papers had quoted these European residents of Ethiopia as <b>having</b> <b>said</b> many negative things about him and his reign.|$|E
25|$|Rescue {{boats and}} {{helicopters}} searched the area, including four Egyptian frigates. Italian Coastal Patrol Unit Ships patrolled {{for more than}} 90 hours in severe weather conditions, and eight survivors were rescued by MFO vessels Vedetta and Sentinella. The United Kingdom diverted the warship HMS Bulwark which would have arrived in a day-and-a-half, but reports conflict {{as to whether or}} not the ship was recalled. Israeli sources report that an offer of search and rescue assistance from the Israeli Navy was declined. Egyptian authorities accepted a United States offer of a P-3 Orion maritime naval patrol aircraft after initially <b>having</b> <b>said</b> that the help was not needed.|$|E
25|$|An {{effort to}} get him to run for the U.S. Senate has stalled indefinitely, Zinni <b>having</b> <b>said</b> he will never run for office. He says his {{decision}} to endorse President George W. Bush in 2000 was a mistake, and in 2003, indicated that he plans to avoid politics in the future. However, on March 3, 2006, Zinni joined fellow former United States Marines General Joseph P. Hoar, Lt. General Greg Newbold, Lt. General Frank Petersen, and Congressman Jack Murtha in endorsing fellow former U.S. Marine and Secretary of the Navy Jim Webb for U.S. Senate in Virginia. Zinni had been floated as a possible Vice Presidential running mate of Barack Obama, the 2008 Presidential nominee of the Democratic Party.|$|E

25|$|From the 1820s to the 1860s, the {{influence}} {{and status of}} amateurism steadily rose to a zenith that Derek Birley called the Amateur Ambuscade and Harry Altham called the Halcyon Days of Amateur Cricket. Standards of play at the fee-paying schools and at the two great universities rose to an unprecedented height that remains unsurpassed. <b>Having</b> <b>said</b> that, credit for the prolonged success of the Gentlemen against the Players through the 1870s belongs essentially to W. G. Grace, who became an amateur by special MCC invitation. None of the Grace brothers attended public school or university; they learned how to play {{at home and in}} local club cricket. This period of amateur dominance, encompassing as it did the so-called Golden Age of cricket, lasted until an erosion set in after the First World War which ultimately resulted in the abolition of amateurism in 1962.|$|E
25|$|At any rate, in 1464 (9 Aug.), Billing {{was added}} to the three judges of the king's bench, but by the king's writ only: and the {{question}} being thereupon raised, it was decided that a commission in addition to the writ was required for the appointment of a justice of assize. Baker in his Chronology,' and Hale in his ‘Pleas of the Crown,' says that on the trial of Walter Walker for treason in 1460, for <b>having</b> <b>said</b> to his son, 'Tom, if thou behavest thyself well, I will make thee heir to the Crown' i.e. of the Crown Inn, of which he was landlord, Billing ruled a conviction, and Lord Campbell accepts the story. But it would seem from the report of the judgment of Chief-justice Bromley in the trial of Sir Nicholas Throckmorton, 17 April 1554, that the judge at that trial was John Markham, afterwards chief justice next before Billing, and that he directed an acquittal.|$|E
25|$|Haig was in England from 12 March. On 14 March, at {{a meeting}} at Downing Street, warning of serious {{manpower}} problems by June “if (sic) the Germans attacked”. Bonar Law and Lloyd George, by Haig’s account, {{tried to get him}} to say that the Germans would not attack. They accused Haig of <b>having</b> <b>said</b> that there would not be a major German offensive (which was not actually what he had said – he had said it would be “a gambler’s throw”) but agreed to shelve the General Reserve for the time being until enough American troops had arrived. On the same day Haig attended two long sessions of the Supreme War Council (at one of which, to his amusement, Clemenceau told Foch to shut up). On 15 Haig took part in a long discussion about the bombing of German cities, which he regarded as a waste of effort. That night Doris gave birth to his son Dawyck. He returned to France the next day.|$|E
