5|$|Because of {{the treacherous}} {{conditions}} in which this breed of <b>dog</b> <b>was</b> used, coupled with a succession of accidents, talk of the whole stock becoming extinct was raised as early as 1839. However at some point prior to 1847 a pestilence swept through the region and reduced the number down to a single specimen, which forced the canons into crossing it with other breeds.|$|E
5|$|By 1981, Gary's wife, {{and then}} Gary himself, had both {{committed}} suicide. At the same time, Hollywood was {{under threat of}} strikes by both the Writers's and Directors's Guilds. Needing enough films to carry the studio through in case the strikes happened, White <b>Dog</b> <b>was</b> one of thirteen films considered to be far enough along to be completable {{in a short time}} frame. With a push from Michael Eisner, White <b>Dog</b> <b>was</b> one of seven that Paramount put on a fast track for production. Eisner pushed for the film {{to be one of the}} selected ones because of its social message that hate was learned. Producer Jon Davison was less certain and, early on, he questioned how the film was being marketed. Hanson, back on board as the film's screenwriter, suggested that Samuel Fuller be named the film's director as he felt Fuller was the only one available with the experience needed to complete the film on such a short schedule and with a low budget, while still doing so responsibly with regard to the sensitive material. Davison agreed after visiting Fuller and seeing Fuller act out how he would shoot the film.|$|E
5|$|Echoing {{the fate}} of the {{previous}} memorial, the new <b>dog</b> <b>was</b> moved into storage in 1992 by Battersea Park's owners, the Conservative Borough of Wandsworth, they said as part of a park renovation scheme. Anti-vivisectionists campaigned for its return, suspicious of the explanation. It was reinstated in the park's Woodland Walk in 1994, near the Old English Garden, a more secluded spot than before.|$|E

5|$|In 1829 a Mastiff like <b>dog</b> <b>was</b> {{brought from}} the Great St Bernard Hospice and was {{exhibited}} in London and Liverpool to thousands of people.

5|$|The Australian Cattle <b>Dog</b> <b>was</b> {{developed}} {{for its ability}} to encourage reluctant cattle to travel long distances and may be the best breed in the world for this work. However, some working dog trainers have expressed concern that dogs bred for the show ring are increasingly too short in the legs and too stocky in the body to undertake the work for which they were originally bred.|$|E

5|$|The ballad Master McGrath {{concerns}} a greyhound {{of that name}} from Lurgan which became an Irish sporting hero. The <b>dog</b> <b>was</b> bought in Lurgan by the Brownlow family, and the song also mentions his owner Charles Brownlow, {{referred to in the}} lyrics as Lord Lurgan. Master McGrath won the Waterloo Cup hare coursing competition three times in 1868, 1870 and 1871 at a time when this was a high-profile sport. A post mortem found that he had a heart twice the size of what is normal for a dog of his size. He is remembered all over the town, including in its coat of arms. The <b>dog</b> <b>was</b> named McGrath after the kennel boy responsible for its care. A statue of him was unveiled at Craigavon Civic Centre in 1993, over 120 years after his last glory in 1871. The statue was relocated to Lurgan town centre in 2013. A festival is also held yearly in his honour. A Lurgan pub was also named after Master McGrath, although it has been renamed in recent years.|$|E
5|$|Up to this point, Australia's {{performances}} {{had been}} poor, and winter athletes were often derided by the summer-dominated administrators. During one meeting, a cross-country representative {{asked for the}} selection of six athletes, prompting the selection committee chairman to interject. The chairman said that a seventh place would be needed, {{and went on to}} explain that a <b>dog</b> <b>was</b> required to find the athletes after they got lost in the snow. The majority of his colleagues burst into laughter.|$|E
5|$|A droving <b>dog</b> <b>was</b> needed, but {{the colonial}} working dogs are {{understood}} {{to have been}} of the Old English Sheepdog type, {{commonly referred to as}} Smithfields. Descendants of these dogs still exist, but are useful only over short distances and for yard work with domesticated cattle. Thomas Hall addressed the problem by importing several of the dogs used by drovers in Northumberland, his parents' home county. At that time dogs were generally described by their job, regardless of whether they constituted a breed as it is currently understood. In the manner of the time, the Hall family historian, A. J. Howard, gave these blue mottled dogs a name: Northumberland Blue Merle Drovers Dog.|$|E

5|$|A further {{challenge}} for the dog actor was to lie still in an isolation tank and not move even when petted by Bakula or Billingsley during some long scenes whilst on screen. At times a stunt <b>dog</b> <b>was</b> used, but Breezy was required for any close-ups. A prosthetic Beagle was also created for the scenes in the isolation tank and to be submersed in a super-hydration tank. The prop was created by Joel Harlow, who had also created make-up designs for the television series Carnivàle and the film The Chronicles of Riddick.|$|E
5|$|American Cocker Spaniels {{have had}} several {{links to the}} United States Presidency. In 1952, an American Cocker Spaniel became a {{household}} name when United States Senator Richard Nixon made his Checkers speech on 23 September. A parti-colored American Cocker Spaniel named Dot {{was one of several}} dogs owned by Rutherford B. Hayes; and a buff colored dog named Feller caused a scandal for Harry S. Truman when the <b>dog</b> <b>was</b> received as an unwanted gift with the President subsequently giving it away to a White House physician. More recently, a Cocker named Zeke lived with Bill Clinton while he was Arkansas Governor.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} attribute in this <b>dog</b> <b>was</b> a tempered aggressiveness {{that would}} provide the necessary drive to pursue and bolt the fox, without resulting in physical harm to the quarry and effectively ending the chase, which was considered unsporting. Russell {{was said to have}} prided himself that his terriers never tasted blood. This line of terriers developed by John Russell was well respected for those qualities, and his dogs were often taken on by hunt enthusiasts. It is unlikely, however, that any dogs alive today can be proven to be descendants from Trump, as Russell was forced to sell all his dogs {{on more than one occasion}} because of financial difficulty, and had only four aged (and non-breeding) terriers left when he died in 1883.|$|E

5|$|Burial 10 is {{the tomb}} of Yax Nuun Ayiin. It is located beneath Structure 34 in the North Acropolis. The tomb {{contained}} a rich array of offerings, including ceramic vessels and food, and nine youths were sacrificed to accompany the dead king. A <b>dog</b> <b>was</b> also entombed with the deceased king. Pots in the tomb were stuccoed and painted and many demonstrated a blend of Maya and Teotihuacan styles. Among the offerings was an incense-burner {{in the shape of}} an elderly underworld god, sitting on a stool made of human bones and holding a severed head in his hands. The tomb was sealed with a corbel vault, then the pyramid was built on top.|$|E
5|$|Ex parte Crow Dog, , is a {{decision}} of the Supreme Court of the United States that followed {{the death of one}} member of a Native American tribe at the hands of another on reservation land. Crow <b>Dog</b> <b>was</b> a member of the Brulé band of the Lakota Sioux. On August5, 1881 he shot and killed Spotted Tail, a Lakota chief; there are different accounts of the background to the killing. The tribal council dealt with the incident according to Sioux tradition, and Crow Dog paid restitution to the dead man's family. However, the U.S. authorities then prosecuted Crow Dog for murder in a federal court. He was found guilty and sentenced to hang. The Supreme Court held that unless authorized by Congress, federal courts had no jurisdiction to try cases where the offense had already been tried by the tribal council. Crow <b>Dog</b> <b>was</b> therefore released. This case {{was the first time in}} history that an Indian was held on trial for the murder of another Indian. The case led to the Major Crimes Act in 1885, which placed some major crimes (initially seven, now 15) under federal jurisdiction if committed by an Indian against another Indian on a reservation or tribal land. This case was the beginning of the plenary power legal doctrine that has been used in Indian case law to limit tribal sovereignty.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, White <b>Dog</b> <b>was</b> {{edited for}} a direct-to-television {{broadcast}} and made available purchase by cable channels. The following year, NBC bought broadcast rights for $2.5 million and slated {{the film to}} air during the February sweeps, then canceled the broadcast two days later due to pressure from the continuing NAACP campaign and concerns of a negative reaction by both viewers and advertisers. The film was eventually aired on other cable channels such as HBO, Showtime, and The Movie Channel sporadically and without fanfare. It was also infrequently screened at independent film houses and film festivals.|$|E

This became a point of embarrassment during the libel trial, when Bayliss's laboratory assistant, Charles Scuttle, testified that the dog had been killed with chloroform or the ACE mixture. After Scuttle's testimony Dale told the court that he had, in fact, used a knife.|$|E
