As social networks and reputation-based systems for products and services are increasingly complementing people's real world life with new web-based relations and experiences, the referred virtual identities are evolving towards more genuine and less ambiguous references to social identities. We introduce a weak identification model where entities linked to agents could help citizens to select their virtual identities within an <b>electronic</b> deliberative <b>democracy.</b> This approach is implemented in the multichannel eGovernment Inquiry Framework (eGif), suitably extended with weak identity connectors and channel interfaces adapters. 1...|$|R
