500|$|In 2005, Warner Bros. offered CAD$5,000 (later CAD$50,000) to the Canadian folk {{band the}} Wyrd Sisters {{for the rights}} to use their name in the film version of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. Rowling had written a scene in the novel in which a band called the Weird Sisters {{appeared}} at a school dance, and the group owned the rights to the name in Canada. However, the offer was declined, and instead the band undertook a legal action against Warner Bros., as well as Jarvis Cocker of Pulp and Jonny Greenwood and Phil Selway of Radiohead, who were to play the band in the film. All plans to use the name in the movie were later abandoned. Despite that decision, the Canadian band filed a CAD$40-million ($39million) lawsuit against Warner in Ontario court. In connection with the lawsuit, the band brought an <b>interlocutory</b> <b>injunction</b> hoping to prevent the release of the film. The injunction application was dismissed. The entire suit was dismissed in November 2005. In June 2006, an Ontario judge decreed that the band pay Warner Bros. CAD$140,000 in legal costs, describing their lawsuit as [...] "highly intrusive". The group claimed they planned to appeal the decision. Jarvis Cocker initially wished to release an album of [...] "Weird Sisters"-themed music with collaborators including Franz Ferdinand, Jack White and Iggy Pop, but the project was dropped {{as a result of the}} lawsuit. The Wyrd Sisters reported death threats from irate Harry Potter fans. As of March 2010, the lawsuit has been settled out of court, the details sealed.|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{concentrates}} on the position of aggrieved parties and crime victims. In relation to Act 45 / 2013 Coll., effective from 1 August 2013, On Victims of Crimes, their position has been regulated in a single comprehensive document. The Act substantially amended the Code of Criminal Procedure, modified the previous rights of the aggrieved parties and introduced into the Code a new institute of <b>interlocutory</b> <b>injunctions.</b> The paper analyzes {{the rights of the}} victims and aggrieved parties. Additionally, it endeavors to pinpoint the deficiencies in the current legislation. The first section analyzes the aggrieved parties as participants in criminal proceedings and their rights in different stages of the proceedings. This section then tries to map the options that the aggrieved parties have in choosing their attorneys, or a joint attorney, and when they can claim legal assistance free of charge or at a reduced cost. The section is focused on the process of court's decision making in the trial; on the aggrieved party's options of seeking relief through remedies; and on the special position of aggrieved parties as regards the diversion of criminal proceedings.

40|$|The Author {{undertakes}} {{a survey}} in this Article {{which shows that}} the Supreme Court and the courts of appeals have not articulated or applied consistent criteria for preliminary injunctive relief. Their decisions have described a sinuous path through primary standards, alternative tests, and sliding scale variations. Part of the difficulty may be because the Supreme Court has not taken a firm hand in resolving conflicts between and among the circuits on critical issues involving <b>interlocutory</b> <b>injunctions.</b> In addition while the courts of appeals make reference to each others 2 ̆ 7 opinions, they have not demonstrated a desire to achieve uniformity in their approaches to interim relief. In some cases, the non-uniformity is intra-circuit as well as inter-circuit. Because {{there are so many}} currently applicable tests and variations, a moving party asserting the same facts and legal principles in different circuits could easily secure different results on motions for preliminary relief. While non-uniformity of decisions may serve a creative purpose in the short run, over time it tends to breed disrespect for and discontent of the law and advance the perception that judicial decisionmaking is largely arbitrary. Furthermore from a practical perspective, non-uniformity, especially of the intra-circuit variety, tends to undermine the goal of predictability which is vital for lawyer and client in ordering their affairs to conform with established legal norms.

5000|$|In Australia, the High Court in ABC v Lenah Game Meats (See also [...] "Patrick Stevedores Operations No. 2 Pty Ltd & Ors v Maritime Union of Australia & Ors" [...] ) {{stated that}} the purpose of the <b>interlocutory</b> <b>injunction</b> is to {{preserve}} identifiable legal or equitable rights. The basic proposition remains that where interlocutory injunctive relief is sought in a Judicature system court, it is necessary to identify the legal (which may be statutory) or equitable rights which are to be determined at trial and in respect of which there is sought final relief which may or may not be injunctive in nature. In another Australian High Court decision, Castlemaine Tooheys Ltd v South Australia (1986) 161 CLR 148, Mason CJ outlined another requirement for establishing an <b>interlocutory</b> <b>injunction.</b> He suggested that the plaintiff had to show that 'irreparable injury' would be suffered, for which common law damages would not be adequate compensation, unless an injunction was granted. The main difficulty associated with granting an <b>interlocutory</b> <b>injunction</b> is that the court must consider whether the likelihood of a legal action being established is sufficiently strong for the injunction to be granted.|$|E

Topical issues from these cases focus on jurisdiction, the right to control the disposition of remains, and remedies available for the infringement of a burial right. While the meaning and content of sepulchral rights remain the same in Nigeria as in many industrialized nations, its prioritization is markedly different. In contrast to the highly individualized nature of burial rights in many Western legal systems, the control of sepulchral right in Nigeria is familial in character. In some circumstances, however, recourse may be had to statutory provisions that import English priority rules. While a range of remedies is available for an interference with a burial right, injunctions and declarations are the most sought after by Nigerian litigants.

40|$|In {{its current}} near-final draft form, the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement [ACTA] being {{negotiated}} plurilaterally—and largely secretly—by a self-selected group of countries proposes to allow preliminary and final injunctive relief against third parties (third-party enforcement) to prevent infringement {{of intellectual property}} rights and/or to prevent infringing goods from entering into the channels of commerce. There is lingering uncertainty whether the relevant civil enforcement section will apply to {{the entire range of}} intellectual property rights or whether patents will be excluded. If patents are excluded, the dangers in ACTA would be reduced but not eliminated—new globalized forms of third-party enforcement would still pose unprecedented risks to the lawful trade of generic medicines. Extending third-party liability and imposing <b>interlocutory</b> and/or permanent <b>injunctions</b> against (1) innocent active pharmaceutical ingredient suppliers whose materials are used in the manufacture of patent infringing medicines or in mislabeled products without their knowledge, (2) transporters who use international channels of trade through countries where the “patent manufacturing fiction” or “trademark confusion” claims might apply, and (3) other actors in the global procurement and supply of medicines, could interfere with goal of robust generic competition and access to medicine. Under the risk of preliminary and permanent injunctions, and contempt of court sanctions for violating such injunctions, API suppliers would predictably shy away from selling base ingredients to generic producers, entities like the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (Global Fund) the U. S. PEPFAR Supply Chain Management System (SCMS) could be deterred from funding the purchase of generic medicines, and shippers might refuse to transport finished generic medicines through ordinary transshipment routes involving ACTA signatories.
