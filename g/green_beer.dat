25|$|In {{every year}} since 1991, March has been proclaimed Irish-American Heritage Month by the US Congress or President due to the date of Saint Patrick's Day. Christian {{denominations}} in the United States observing this feast day include the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, Protestant Episcopal Church, and the Roman Catholic Church. Today, Saint Patrick's Day is widely celebrated in America by Irish and non-Irish alike. For most Irish-Americans, this holiday is both religious and festive. It {{is one of the}} leading days for consumption of alcohol in the United States, as individuals are allowed to break their Lenten sacrifices for the day in order to celebrate Saint Patrick's Day. The consumption of artificially colored <b>green</b> <b>beer</b> is a common celebration. <b>Green</b> <b>Beer</b> Day, for instance, is a tradition among students at Miami University (Miami of Ohio), dating to 1952; the day has been held on the Thursday before spring break due to the fact that Saint Patrick's Day often occurs during the spring recess. The holiday has been criticized for promoting over-indulgence in alcohol, resulting in drunk driving, property damage, absenteeism, public urination and vomiting, and other ill effects. A notable difference between traditions widely observed in the United States versus those of Ireland is the consumption of corned beef, which is not a traditional Irish dish, but rather one that was adopted by the new immigrants upon their arrival in the 19th Century.|$|E
2500|$|Barley {{is a key}} {{ingredient}} in beer and whisky production. Two-row barley is traditionally used in German and English beers. Six-row barley was traditionally used in US beers, but both varieties are in common usage now. Distilled from <b>green</b> <b>beer,</b> whiskey has been made primarily from barley in Ireland and Scotland, while other countries have used more diverse sources of alcohol, such as the more common corn, rye and wheat in the USA. In the US, a grain type may be identified on a whisky label if that type of grain constitutes 51% {{or more of the}} ingredients and certain other conditions are satisfied. [...] About 25% of the United States' production of barley is used for malting, for which barley is the best-suited grain.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the city}} of Syracuse, NY, Saint Patrick's {{celebrations}} are traditionally begun with the delivery of <b>green</b> <b>beer</b> to Coleman's Irish Pub on the last Sunday of February. Coleman's {{is located in the}} Tipperary Hill section of the city. Tipperary Hill is home to the World-famous [...] "Green-on-Top" [...] Traffic Light and is historically the Irish section in Syracuse. Saint Patrick's Day is rung in at midnight with the painting of a Shamrock under the Green-Over-Red traffic light. Syracuse boasts the largest Saint Patrick's Day celebration per-capita in the United States with their annual Syracuse Saint Patrick's Parade, founded by Nancy Duffy, an honoured journalist in the Central New York area and an active community leader, and Daniel F. Casey, a local Irishman and businessman. [...] "The parade remains a major annual event, typically drawing an estimated crowd of more than 100,000 visitors to downtown Syracuse, as well as 5,000 to 6,000 marchers." ...|$|E
5000|$|While Miami {{students}} recognize <b>Green</b> <b>Beer</b> Day, Miami threatened {{legal action}} against {{the owner of the}} domain www.greenbeerday.com for using the Miami name without permission. Miami changed its timing of its Spring Break in 2009, allowing students to celebrate both <b>Green</b> <b>Beer</b> Day and St. Patrick's Day; when asked if the change was intended to allow Miami students to celebrate twice, Steve Snyder, the executive assistant to the President of the University, responded, [...] "Miami University has nothing whatsoever to do with <b>Green</b> <b>Beer</b> Day." [...] Miami University has encouraged instructors via email to remove students who arrive inebriated on <b>Green</b> <b>Beer</b> Day, in order to combat the tradition.|$|E
50|$|Students {{begin to}} drink {{as early as}} 1 to 5 A.M. on <b>Green</b> <b>Beer</b> Day; bars in Oxford open at 5 A.M. Many {{students}} embark on their first successful entrepreneurial venture on <b>Green</b> <b>Beer</b> Day, selling iconic green shirts to drink in throughout the day. The rise in popularity of this annual celebration {{has given rise to}} many pop up apparel companies that sell <b>Green</b> <b>Beer</b> Day apparel in {{the weeks leading up to}} the event. The long day of drinking entails party hopping all over town, with many parties offering free McDonald's breakfast to prevent over intoxication by sunrise. One of the consequences of drinking <b>green</b> <b>beer</b> is that it will turn the tongues of party goers green. If they arrive at class inebriated, they are asked to leave.|$|E

5000|$|The use of matcha {{in modern}} drinks has also spread to North American cafés, such as Starbucks, which {{introduced}} [...] "Green Tea Lattes" [...] and other matcha-flavoured drinks after matcha became successful in their Japanese store locations. As in Japan, {{it has become}} integrated into lattes, iced drinks, milkshakes, and smoothies. A number of cafes have introduced lattes and iced drinks using matcha powder. It has also been incorporated into alcoholic beverages such as liqueurs and even matcha <b>green</b> tea <b>beers.</b>|$|R

5000|$|In 1981, the Fred Koch Brewery was {{purchased}} by the Vaux Breweries of Sunderland, England. Vaux expressed confidence planning on a 30 percent expansion of the brewery's 30,000-barrel annual capacity. [...] In 1983, the book [...] "Gourmet Guide to Beer" [...] ranked Koch's Golden Anniversary Beer number one among 140 American-brewed pale lagers. And its Jubilee Porter, made to celebrate the 50th anniversary {{of the end of}} Prohibition, was also well received. [...] In 1984, as a St. Patrick's Day promotion, the brewery distributed <b>green</b> colored <b>beer.</b> The novelty shipment was a sell-out.|$|R

50|$|One of Dogfish Head's more notable odd beers was a <b>green</b> <b>beer</b> called Verdi Verdi Good, {{produced}} in 2005 and sold only on draft.

In the city of Bayamón, there is an urbanization called Irlanda Heights (Ireland Heights). For the last several years, the town of Luquillo has hosted a day-long Saint Patrick's Day festival which includes a Desfile de San Patricio (St. Patrick's Parade) honoring Ireland's chief patron saint.

Among them are Shannon's Irish Pub in San Juan, and Logan's Irish Pub in Río Piedras.|$|R

50|$|Biłgoraj is an {{important}} center of local folklore, with highly developed folk art, regional clothes and customs. This {{is due to the}} town’s location, among forests, where communication with other communities was limited. There are several “Biłgoraj-style” houses, and in the area numerous wayside shrines can be found. Biłgoraj's folklore was used by Grzegorz Ciechowski in his songs written as Grzegorz z Ciechowa.
