40|$|Changes in {{the voltage}} clamp {{currents}} of squid giant axons wrought by low axoplasmic TEA+ (tetraethylammonium chloride) concentrations (0. 3 mM and above) are described. They are: (a) For positive steps <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>resting</b> potential in sea water, the K+ current increases, decreases, then increases, instead of increasing monotonically. (b) For positive steps <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>resting</b> potential in 440 mM external K+, the current has an exponentially decaying component, whose decay rate increases with axoplasmic [TEA+]. The control currents increase monotonically. (c) For negative steps <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>resting</b> potential in 440 mM external K+, the current record has a peak {{followed by a}} decay that is slow relative to the control. The control record decreases monotonically. Qualitatively these findings can be described by a simple kinetic model, from which, with one assumption, {{it is possible to}} calculate the rate at which K+ ions move through the K+ channels. An interesting conclusion from (c) is that the channels cannot be closed by the normal voltage-sensitive mechanism (described by Hodgkin and Huxley) until they are free of TEA+...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Functional {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (fMRI) has become very important for noninvasively characterizing BOLD signal fluctuations, which reflect the changes in neuronal firings in the brain. Unlike the activation detection strategy utilized with fMRI, which only emphasizes the synchronicity between the functional nodes (activated regions) and the task design, brain connectivity and network theory are able to decipher the interactive structure across the entire brain. However, {{little is known about}} whether and how the activated/less-activated interactions are associated with the functional changes that occur when <b>the</b> brain changes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>resting</b> state to a task state. What are the key networks that play important roles in the brain state changes? Methods: We used <b>the</b> fMRI data <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Human Connectome Project S 500 release to examine the changes of network efficiency, interaction strength, and fractional modularity contributions of both the local and global networks, when <b>the</b> subjects change <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>resting</b> state to seven different task states. Results: We found that, <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>resting</b> state to each of seven task states, both the activated and less-activated regions had significantly changed to be in line with, and comparably contributed to, a global network reconfiguration. We also found that three networks, the default mode network, frontoparietal network, and salience network, dominated the flexible reconfiguration of the brain. Conclusions: This study shows quantitatively that contributions from both activated and less-activated regions enable the global functional network to respond when <b>the</b> brain switches <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>resting</b> state to a task state and suggests the necessity of considering large-scale networks (rather than only activated regions) when investigating brain functions in imaging cognitive neuroscience...|$|R
