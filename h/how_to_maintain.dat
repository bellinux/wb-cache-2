5|$|Before the war, Major Ralph Bagnold learned <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> {{and operate}} vehicles, how to navigate, {{and how to}} {{communicate}} in the desert. On 23 June 1940 he met General Archibald Wavell, {{the commander of the}} Middle East Command in Alexandria and explained his concept for a group of men intended to undertake long-range reconnaissance patrols to gather intelligence behind the Italian lines in Libya.|$|E
5|$|One {{criticism}} of Kohlberg's {{theory is that}} it emphasizes justice {{to the exclusion of}} other values, and so may not adequately address the arguments of those who value other moral aspects of actions. Carol Gilligan has argued that Kohlberg's theory is overly androcentric. Kohlberg's theory was initially developed based on empirical research using only male participants; Gilligan argued that it did not adequately describe the concerns of women. Kohlberg stated that women tend to get stuck at level 3, focusing on details of <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> relationships and promote the welfare of family and friends. Men are likely {{to move on to the}} abstract principles, and thus have less concern with the particulars of who is involved. Consistent with this observation, Gilligan's theory of moral development does not focus on the value of justice. She developed an alternative theory of moral reasoning based on the ethics of caring. Critics such as Christina Hoff Sommers, however, argued that Gilligan's research is ill-founded, and that no evidence exists to support her conclusion.|$|E

25|$|In {{complying}} with the Senate's wishes, Marius tried to show the senate, who had always been suspicious of his motives, {{that he was one}} of them instead of the outsider that Quintus Metellus said he was in 108 BC. Marius' overall concern, for his part, was always <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> the Senate's esteem: in the words of the scholar A.N.

Many accidents result when otherwise experienced riders who have never carefully developed this skill encounter an unexpected obstacle.|$|E
25|$|Although {{research}} is limited, {{research has shown}} that climate change may alter the developmental stages of pathogens that can affect crops. The biggest consequence of climate change on the dispersal of pathogens is that the geographical distribution of hosts and pathogens could shift, which would result in more crop losses. This could affect competition and recovery from disturbances of plants. It has been predicted that the effect of climate change will add a level of complexity to figuring out <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> sustainable agriculture.|$|E
25|$|The {{economic}} value of natural capital and ecosystem services is accepted by mainstream environmental economics, but is emphasized as {{especially important in}} ecological economics. Ecological economists may begin by estimating <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> a stable environment before assessing the cost in dollar terms. Ecological economist Robert Costanza led an attempted valuation of the global ecosystem in 1997. Initially published in Nature, the article concluded on $33 trillion with a range from $16 trillion to $54 trillion (in 1997, total global GDP was $27 trillion). Half of the value went to nutrient cycling. The open oceans, continental shelves, and estuaries had the highest total value, and the highest per-hectare values went to estuaries, swamps/floodplains, and seagrass/algae beds. The work was criticized by articles in Ecological Economics Volume 25, Issue 1, but the critics acknowledged the positive potential for economic valuation of the global ecosystem.|$|E

25|$|Much of {{biochemistry}} {{deals with}} the structures, functions and interactions of biological macromolecules, such as proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates and lipids, which provide the structure of cells and perform many of the functions associated with life. The chemistry of the cell also depends on the reactions of smaller molecules and ions. These can be inorganic, for example water and metal ions, or organic, for example the amino acids, which are used to synthesize proteins. The mechanisms by which cells harness energy from their environment via chemical reactions are known as metabolism. The findings of biochemistry are applied primarily in medicine, nutrition, and agriculture. In medicine, biochemists investigate the causes and cures of diseases. In nutrition, they study <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> health wellness and {{study the effects of}} nutritional deficiencies. In agriculture, biochemists investigate soil and fertilizers, and try to discover ways to improve crop cultivation, crop storage and pest control.|$|E
25|$|One of the para-Alpine skiing {{techniques}} used by this class {{is called the}} three track method, and was developed {{as part of the}} American Training System. One of the first skills learned using this technique is how to walk with the ski so the skier can learn how to flex the ankle, knee and hip. This allows the skier to determine their centre of gravity. The skier is then taught how hop turn in order to understand arm and leg coordination while on skis. This technique is only used while stationary and is not a competition skill. The skier next learns how to fall down and get back up again. The next skill learned is climbing gentle terrain, followed by learning to go down a straight run and learning to stop. After this, the skier learns how to get on and off a ski lift. This is followed by learning how to traverse the fall line, which teaches the skier <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> the ski edge. Other skills are then taught including the Uphill Christie, beginning turns, parallel turns, short swings and moguls.|$|E

The publication received notice from Rowling's lawyers that the comics breached copyright, though the magazine's editor, Ken Crunk, claimed that no violation had taken place, as [...] "he drawings {{do not look}} like any of the characters from Harry Potter".

500|$|In {{addition}} to {{his work on the}} coastal defense problem, McNair was also responsible for directing a review of War Plan Orange, the Army and Navy joint defense plan for countering an attack on Hawaii by Japan. This possibility was a major concern of U.S. military leaders during the years between World War I and World War II. [...] Among McNair's contributions to updating this plan was the creation of several contingency plans ("branches and sequels" [...] in Army parlance) to augment the main war plan. [...] These contingency plans included: using chemical weapons to defend against a Japanese attack, declaring martial law in Hawaii, and determining <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> a defense against Japanese invaders while waiting for reinforcements from the U.S. mainland.|$|E
500|$|The dynamic {{nature of}} the {{characters}} was a unique element of writing in the series at the time. Once they were established in the twelve episodes of the first season, characters began to change and relationships were developed in the second. This continued through the series {{to the point of}} unpredictability that sometimes became unsettling to fans. Buffy essayist Marguerite Krause asserts that the monsters and demons faced by the Scoobies are thin symbolism for the show's true focus: relationships and <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> or ruin them. Common among most of these relationships—romantic, platonic, and familial—is, according to Krause, a [...] "failure to communicate, lack of trust, [...] inability to envision or create a viable future". Miscommunication is worsened or sustained through multiple episodes and seasons, leading to overwhelming misunderstanding and critical turning points for the characters, some of whom do not recover.|$|E

By early 1943 newspapers began publishing reports of large construction in Tennessee and Washington based on public records, and the office began discussing with the project <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> secrecy. In June the Office of Censorship asked newspapers and broadcasters to avoid discussing [...] "atom smashing, atomic energy, atomic fission, atomic splitting, or any of their equivalents. The use for military purposes of radium or radioactive materials, heavy water, high voltage discharge equipment, cyclotrons." [...] The office also asked to avoid discussion of [...] "polonium, uranium, ytterbium, hafnium, protactinium, radium, rhenium, thorium, deuterium"; only uranium was sensitive, but was listed with other elements to hide its importance.|$|E

In particular, he highlighted dialogue by the robot master, Bors, as illustrating the importance of his leadership {{to the success of}} the micro-state. In the story, a conversation with a mechanic leads the robot to state, [...] "You know I'm the only one who can keep all this together.
