Surveillance, monitoring, and evaluation are together {{considered one of the}} four critical pillars of efforts to eliminate congenital syphilis. This surveillance, monitoring, and evaluation tool was developed for use at the global, regional, and national level by public health practitioners who are responsible for efforts to eliminate congenital syphilis. The purpose of this document is to provide guidance on the core indicators for elimination of congenital syphilis (ECS) efforts in regions and countries that are harmonized with and can be integrated into existing data collection systems, in order to strengthen the underlying information systems. The use of common global indicators and tools by regions and countries will facilitate comparability of the resulting data between countries, allow establishment of global and regional monitoring of ECS efforts, improve service delivery, and assist in attainment of the MDGs.

50|$|The <b>Geneva</b> <b>Initiative</b> {{addresses}} and presents a comprehensive solution to all issues vital to ensuring {{the end of}} the conflict and the realization of the national visions of both parties. It would give the Palestinians almost all of the West Bank and Gaza Strip drawing Israel's borders close to what existed prior to the Israeli control of territory at the culmination of the 1967 war.|$|E
50|$|Note: {{traditional}} left-right {{divisions in}} Israel {{are different from}} in most countries, being mostly based on the different positions with regard to security and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

50|$|On some {{occasion}} {{a former}} holder {{of an official}} position continues to carry out an informal diplomatic activity after retirement. In some cases, governments welcome such activity, for example {{as a means of}} establishing an initial contact with a hostile state of group without being formally committed.

Such informal diplomacy is practiced by former US Presidents Jimmy Carter and (to a lesser extent) Bill Clinton and by the former Israeli diplomat and minister Yossi Beilin (see <b>Geneva</b> <b>Initiative).</b>|$|E

[...] Arieli found the fence to be justified due to legitimate concerns of Palestinian terrorism and violence, but was critical of the then-government's alleged negligence of completing the fence due to budgetary and political considerations.

5000|$|In 2000, Robin J. Munro drew {{attention}} {{when he made}} allegations of abuses of forensic psychiatry in China.

50|$|Sadat's liaison {{initiative}} spoke {{volumes about}} {{his reasons for}} wanting {{to make peace with}} Israel. He wanted an alliance with the American superpower and he wanted to kill Carter's <b>Geneva</b> <b>initiative.</b> His trip to Jerusalem signaled a major reorientation of Cairo's place in the global scheme of things, from the Soviet to the American camp. Carter's acceptance of the proposed liaison scheme would have signaled American backing for Sadat's unprecedented peace initiative. But Carter said no. However, Carter could not thwart the Israeli-Egyptian peace push. Within days Israeli journalists were allowed into Cairo, breaking a symbolic barrier, and from there the peace process quickly gained momentum. An Israeli-Egyptian working summit was scheduled for 25 December in Ismailiya, near the Suez Canal.|$|E

According to a document of understandings between former minister Yossi Beilin and Mahmoud Abbas from the mid-1990s, while some Jerusalem Arab neighborhoods were to be transferred to a future Palestinian state, Israel was to annex the Jewish communities around Jerusalem, such as Ma'ale Adumim, Givat Zeev, Beitar, and Efrat. According to the Clinton outline for partitioning Jerusalem that arose in the talks between Israel and the Palestinian Authority at the 2000 Camp David Summit, Israel was to be compensated for partitioning the city by annexing Ma'ale Adumim.|$|E

5000|$|The {{plan has}} much {{similarity}} with the 2000 Camp David Summit and Taba Summit proposals, and Olmert's 2008 Napkin map. Only settlements along the Green Line would be annexed by Israel with mutual land swaps, including Ma'ale Adumim, Pisgat Ze'ev and Giv'at Ze'ev. In the <b>Geneva</b> <b>Initiative,</b> Ariel would be dismantled and the Palestinians be given more sovereignty over East Jerusalem. Jerusalem would be divided administratively, with East Jerusalem ("Al-Quds") {{serving as the}} capital of the Palestinian state and West Jerusalem ("Yerushalayim") as the capital of Israel. A Multinational Force would play an important role. In return for removing most of the Israeli settlements, the Palestinians would limit their [...] "right of return" [...] of refugees to Israel to a number specified by the Israeli government and will put an end to any further claims and demands from Israel.|$|E
