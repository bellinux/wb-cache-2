40|$|Background and Objectives: High {{rates of}} {{comorbidity}} between anxiety disorders and bipolar disorder (BD) have been reported. Studies {{on the impact}} of BD comorbidity in <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> a principal anxiety disorder have been limited. Methods: Individuals (N = 186) seeking anxiety disorder treatment completed questionnaires and a diagnostic interview. Anxious <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> comorbid BD were compared to anxious <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> comorbid depression, and <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> an anxiety disorder only. Results: Anxious <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> BD {{were more likely to report}} being single, separated or divorced, and to present with greater substance abuse and comorbidity than <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> an anxiety disorder only. Anxious <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> BD also presented with lower household income than anxious <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> depression, and <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> anxiety only. Anxious <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> either comorbid BD or comorbid depression reported greater functional impairment and more severe symptoms than <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> anxiety only.

40|$|Background: The ComFor {{study has}} {{indicated}} that <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) show enhanced visual local processing compared <b>with</b> <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> ID only. Items of the ComFor with meaningless materials provided the best discrimination between the two samples. These results {{can be explained by}} the weak central coherence account. The main focus of the present study is to examine whether enhanced visual perception is also present in low-functioning deaf <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> and without ASD compared <b>with</b> <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> ID, and to evaluate the underlying cognitive style in deaf and hearing <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> ASD. Method: Different sorting tasks (selected from the ComFor) were administered from four subsamples: (1) <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> ID (n = 68); (2) <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> ID and ASD (n = 72); (3) <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> ID and deafness (n = 22); and (4) <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> ID, ASD and deafness (n = 15). Differences in performance on sorting tasks with meaningful and meaningless materials between the four subgroups were analysed. Age and level of functioning were taken into account. Results: Analyses of covariance revealed that results of deaf <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> ID and ASD are in line with the results of hearing <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> ID and ASD. Both groups showed enhanced visual perception, especially on meaningless sorting tasks, when compared <b>with</b> hearing <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> ID, but not compared <b>with</b> deaf <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> ID. Conclusions: In ASD either with or without deafness, enhanced visual perception for meaningless information can be understood within the framework of the central coherence theory, whereas in deafness, enhancement in visual perception might be due to a more generally enhanced visual perception as a result of auditory deprivation. status: publishe...|$|R

Sleep problems and sleep behaviours in <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> CDC were compared <b>with</b> <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> non-specific intellectual disabilities (NS) (n = 30) and Down's syndrome (DS) (n = 30). Results Nine <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> CDC (i. e. 30 %) had a sleep problem, compared <b>with</b> seven <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> NS (i. e. 23 %) and three <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> DS (i. e. 10 %).

5|$|An {{association}} with the folliculin (FLCN) gene was first reported in 2002. This 14-exon gene {{is located on the}} short arm of chromosome 17 (17p11.2) and has a cytosine-rich region in exon 11 particularly susceptible to mutation. The most common mutation in this region is the insertion or deletion of a cytosine residue, found in 53% of Birt–Hogg–Dubé families. There is {{no significant difference in the}} symptoms experienced by families with an insertion at that location compared to those who have a deletion. However, mutations in FLCN associated with Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome are heterogeneous, and are often nonsense mutations or frameshift mutations that cause early truncation of the protein product at the carboxy-terminus. Very rarely, missense mutations are observed. Mutations are often passed from one generation to the next in an autosomal dominant fashion but can occur as a new mutation in an <b>individual</b> <b>with</b> no prior family history (a de novo mutation). The children of an affected parent each have a 50% chance of having the disease. Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome has very high penetrance.

5|$|Hans Asperger {{described}} common symptoms {{among his}} patients' family members, especially fathers, and research supports this observation and suggests a genetic contribution to Asperger syndrome. Although no specific gene {{has yet been}} identified, multiple factors are believed {{to play a role}} in the expression of autism, given the phenotypic variability seen in children with AS. Evidence for a genetic link is the tendency for AS to run in families and an observed higher incidence of family members who have behavioral symptoms similar to AS but in a more limited form (for example, slight difficulties with social interaction, language, or reading). Most behavioral genetic research suggests that all autism spectrum disorders have shared genetic mechanisms, but AS may have a stronger genetic component than autism. There is probably a common group of genes where particular alleles render an individual vulnerable to developing AS; if this is the case, the particular combination of alleles would determine the severity and symptoms for each <b>individual</b> <b>with</b> AS.|$|E
