50|$|In {{contract}} cases, {{the court}} is usually interested in securing the performance of what was agreed. Where one party is about to or has suffered loss {{as a result of}} the other's breach, the court offers practical protection to his or her expectations as to performance (in some cases, the use of injunction or specific performance may be appropriate). Where a party proves that he or she has sustained loss flowing from any breach (potentially including non-pecuniary or <b>intangible</b> <b>losses,</b> e.g. for disappointment, damage to reputation, etc.), the purpose of damages is, so far as money can do it, to place the claimant in the same situation as if the contract had been performed. Thus, the most relevant basis upon which to calculate any loss is to examine the economic potential of the contract as worded. This will provide a measure of what the claimant expected to gain, and so quantify what has been lost by the breach.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Earthquake {{disasters}} affect many {{structures and}} infrastructure simultaneously and collectively, and cause tremendous tangible and <b>intangible</b> <b>loss.</b> In particular, catastrophic earthquakes impose tremendous financial stress on insurers who underwrite earthquake insur-ance policies in a seismic region, resulting in possible insolvency. This study develops a stochastic net worth model of an insurer undertaking both ordinary risk and catastrophic earthquake risk, and evaluates its solvency and operability under catastrophic seismic risk. The ordinary risk {{is represented by}} a geometric Brownian motion process, whereas the catastrophic earthquake risk is characterized by an earthquake-engineering-based seismic loss model. The developed model is applied to hypothetical 4000 wood-frame houses in south-western British Columbia, Canada, to investigate the impact of key insurance port-folio parameters to insurer’s ruin probability and business operability. The analysis results indicate: (i) the physical effects of spatially correlated ground motions and local soil condi-tions at insured properties are significant; (ii) the insurer’s earthquake risk exposure depends greatly on insurance arrangement (e. g. deductible and cap); and (iii) the maintenance of suffi-cient initial surplus is critical in keeping insurer’s insolvency potential reasonably low, whil...|$|R

40|$|Techniques for {{awarding}} {{personal injury}} damages assume an increasing interest {{in times of}} frequent mobility of individuals. Assessing non-economic damages might require more harmonized answers to provide justice and equal treatment across the world. Indeed, in most countries a lasting debate surrounds noneconomic damages for personal injury. Specifically, an alleged constant increase in awards and the difficulties linked to the subjectivity of their assessment, and {{the selection of the}} institution that is best suited to award these damages and how it should do so are but a few problems that are addressed by contemporary scholarship. However, this extensive debate has not sufficiently explored the techniques for awarding <b>intangible</b> <b>loss</b> damages in personal injury by using a comparative law methodology. Filling this gap, this article explores the latest developments in awarding non-economic damages. It proposes an analysis of the American and European experiences that aims to bridge the two legal cultures for mutual benefit.

Building on these results, Parts II and III develop a more efficient conceptual framework and further propose better assessment tools in awarding these damages. This method demonstrates the benefits the United States could gain by introducing innovative judicial scheduling, without triggering either constitutional concerns or statutory intervention while building upon the existing strengths of the European experience and the American judicial system. For instance, Normalized Value Scheduling would endow actual judges and jurors with the necessary expertise, increasing horizontal and vertical equality without necessarily impeding an inevitable variability of awards among different jurisdictions...|$|R

40|$|Generally, risk is an {{uncertainty}} {{associated with}} future outcomes or events. In economic terms, risk is an expected {{deviation from the}} planned return of real, financial and <b>intangible</b> assets, of <b>loss</b> or cash flows associated with the uncertain event.

40|$|In France, risk {{assessments}} for natural hazards are usually carried out separately and decision makers lack comprehensive information. Moreover, since {{the cause of}} the hazard (e. g. meteorological, geological) and the physical phenomenon that causes damage (e. g. inundation, ground shaking) may be fundamentally different, the quantitative comparison of single {{risk assessments}} that were not conducted in a compatible framework is not straightforward. Comprehensive comparative risk assessments exist in a few other countries. For instance, the Risk Map Germany project has developed and applied a methodology for quantitatively comparing the risk of relevant natural hazards at various scales (city, state) in Germany. The present on-going work applies a similar methodology to the Pointe-à-Pitre urban area, which represents {{more than half of the}} population of Guadeloupe, an overseas region in the French West Indies. Relevant hazards as well as hazard intensity levels differ from continental Europe, which will lead to different conclusions. French West Indies are prone to a large number of hazards, among which hurricanes, volcanic eruptions and earthquakes dominate. Hurricanes cause damage through three phenomena: wind, heavy rainfall and storm surge, the latter having had a preeminent role during the largest historical event in 1928. Seismic risk is characterized by many induced phenomena, among which earthquake shocks dominate. This study proposes a comparison of earthquake and cyclonic storm surge risks. Losses corresponding to hazard intensities having the same probability of occurrence are calculated. They are quantified in a common loss unit, chosen to be the direct economic <b>losses.</b> <b>Intangible</b> or indirect <b>losses</b> are not considered. The methodology therefore relies on (i) a probabilistic hazard assessment, (ii) a loss ratio estimation for the exposed elements and (iii) an economic estimation of these assets. Storm surge hazard assessment is based on the selection of relevant historical cyclones and on the simulation of the associated wave and cyclonic surge. The combined local sea elevations, called "set-up", are then fitted with a statistical distribution in order to obtain its time return characteristics. Several run-ups are then extracted, the inundation areas are calculated and the relative losses of the affected assets are deduced. The Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Assessment and the exposed elements location and seismic vulnerability result from past public risk assessment studies. The loss estimations are computed for several return time periods, measured in percentage of buildings being in a given EMS- 98 damage state per grid block, which are then converted into loss ratio. In parallel, an asset estimation is conducted. It is mainly focused on private housing, but it considers some major public infrastructures as well. The final outcome of this work is a direct economic loss-frequency plot for earthquake and storm surge. The Probable Maximum Loss and the Average Annual Loss derivate from this risk curve. In addition, different sources of uncertainty are identified through the loss estimation process. The full propagation of these uncertainties can provide an interval of confidence, which can be assigned to the risk-curve and we show how such additional information can be useful for risk comparison...|$|R

Recent work has explored the impacts the First World War had on the women left behind. History documents facts and figures, a representation in the public realm. Soldier’s lives, rightly, are well documented through books, museums, films, photographs etc. Women’s experiences of war work – nursing, driving, office work etc – are also recorded, alongside the broader impacts this work had in changing women’s role within society, but the undocumented lives of millions of women, who experienced deprivation, fear and loss during the war, remain quiet, more private histories.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{leadership}} change on military disputes Military disputes have always brought painful consequences including tangible and <b>intangible</b> <b>losses.</b> Two world wars {{remind us of}} the horrific penalties that war imposes on mankind. Knowing these negative repercussions, why do nations fight wars? James D. Fearon argues that there always exist ex ante bargaining (negotiation) opportunities. However, nations gamble in war, according to Fearon’s rational explanation for war, due to incomplete information—disagreement about relative power, miscalculation of an opponent’s willingness to fight—and commitment problem. Fearon’s rationalist explanation of war can also be interpreted by taking the role of national leaders into account as they have direct roles in making strategic calculations and commitment before, during and after a war. If national leaders have a noticeable impact especially in formulating war policies, then we can expect variations in policies from one leader to another. One way to observe this variation is through national leadership change during a dispute. In democracies, leadership change is frequent through elections. In non-democracies, leaders tend to have long tenure but leadership change (through coups or other means) is not uncommon. Does regime type explain the policies adopted by new leaders?

40|$|A {{natural hazard}} is a geophysical, {{atmospheric}} or hydrological event (e. g., earthquake, landslide, tsunami, windstorm, flood or drought) {{that has the}} potential to cause harm or loss, while a natural disaster is the occurrence of an extreme hazard event that impacts on communities causing damage, disruption and casualties, and leaving the affected communities unable to function normally without outside assistance (Twig, 2007). The definition of natural disaster impact (NDI) can change according to both the aim of the study and the scientist assessing it. It can be defined as constituting the direct, indirect and <b>intangible</b> <b>losses</b> caused on environment and society by a natural disaster (Swiss Re, 1998). Direct losses include physical effects such as destruction and changes that reduce the functionality of an individual or structure. Damages to people (death/injury), buildings, their contents, and vehicles are included, as are clean-up and disposal costs. Indirect losses affect society by disrupting or damaging utility services and local businesses. Loss of revenue; increase in cost; expenses connected to the provision of assistance, lodging, and drinking water; and costs associated with the need to drive longer distances because of blocked roads are included. <b>Intangible</b> <b>losses</b> include psychological impairments caused by both direct and <b>intangible</b> <b>losses</b> that individuals personally suffer during the disaster. The Natural Disaster Impact Assessment (NDIA) is crucial in helping individuals to estimate replacement costs and to conduct cost-benefit analyses in allotting resources to prevent and mitigate the consequences of damage (UNEP-ECLAC, 2000). A general NDIA procedure has not yet been developed; several approaches are available in literature and their applicability depends on the accessibility of damage data. Possible end users of NDIA include the following (Lindell & Prater, 2003) : 1. 	Governments, with an interest in estimating direct losses to report to taxpayers and to identify segments of the community that have been (or might be) disproportionately affected 2. 	Community leaders, who may need to use loss data after a disaster strikes to determine if external assistance is necessary and, if so, how much. 3. 	Planners, who can develop damage predictions to assess the effects of alternative hazard adjustments. Knowing both the expected losses {{and the extent to which}} those losses could be reduced makes it possible to implement cost-effective mitigation strategies. 4. 	Insurers, who need data on the maximum losses in their portfolios to guarantee their solvency or even to undertake additional measures to alleviate the risk that they would face in case of a disaster (i. e., the use of catastrophe bonds which are risk-linked securities that transfer a specified set of risks from a sponsor to investors) (Noy & Nualsri, 2011). Data availability and reliability, especially for old events, represent constraints in the NDIA context because of several issues of very different type: 1. 	Data availability, for current events, depends on the time at which data gathering started. It is impossible to decide a priori when data have to be gathered: it primarily depends on the type of phenomenon causing the disaster and its magnitude, and secondly on the scope of the assessment (for example, the assessment should not be unnecessarily delayed as there is an urgent need to elicit support from the international community) (ECLAC, 2003). 2. 	Long-term losses must sometimes be determined over a period of years. Slow landslides, for example, can cause damage over long periods. Intangible damage like disaster-related stress also requires years to be detected (Bland et al., 1996). 3. 	In most countries, there are no agencies responsible for gathering damage data. Damage caused by severest events can be mined from international databases, while data on less severe events can be obtained by means of specific historical studies. 4. 	Data on property damage can depreciate the value of property, thus they would not be available or not completely reliable (Highland, 2003). 5. 	For some type of disasters, as landslides or floods, the costs of damages to structures such as roads are often merged with maintenance costs and are therefore not labelled as damage. In addition, when heavy rains trigger both landslides and floods (Petrucci and Polemio, 2009), it is difficult to separate landslide damage from flood damage. 6. 	Developing countries have an incentive to exaggerate damage to receive higher amounts of international assistance; thus, in these cases, data may not be entirely reliable (Toya & Skidmore, 2007). This chapter starts with a panoramic of the different approaches reported in the literature to assess the impact of natural disasters, and then presents some simplified approaches to perform a relative and comparative assessment of the impact caused by phenomena as landslides and floods triggered by heavy rainfall during events defined as Damaging Hydrogeological Events. Finally, some indices to assess the relative impact of landslides are presented...|$|E
40|$|Subway {{system is}} one of the {{critical}} infrastructures in a society. In economic optimizations of risk control measures, valuing the loss of life and other financial losses in terms of money on the other hand, could influence the optimal investments in safety. The purpose is to contribute to the implementation of HSE in the transportation system. In this research, a fire risk assessment along with its economic loss estimation in the Direct Current (DC) trains and rectifier substation (RS) of Tehran subway is implemented. The number of fatalities, the extent of damage on the train equipment, etc., is then calculated in monetary unit. By using Event Tree Analysis (herein ETA), after identification of initiating events through observation, interviews, and evaluation of documents, event tree was constructed for each of them and the probability of multiple scenarios were computed. The scenario with the highest probability of fire in RS, including increased heats in the RTU panels generate a loss of at least 730 Million Rials. Accordingly, the minimum and maximum economic loss caused by fire on DC trains is minimum 510 and 1230 Million Rials, respectively. Conclusion: Given the findings of this study, the financial and human life risks, along with all tangible and <b>intangible</b> <b>losses,</b> which is considerable, the relevant managers must compare investments in safety, with the decrease of calculated economic risks as a result of fire accident in Tehran subway...|$|E
40|$|AbstractRoad Traffic Accidents (RTAs) {{are serious}} but ignored problem in Pakistan. Now {{this problem is}} under limelight due to {{disastrous}} impacts over society in general and over economy in particular. Karachi {{is considered to be}} the most income generating city of Pakistan. This city holds a typical feature of most road traffic accidents facing in the country and the fourth highest RTA fatalities in the world. More than 26, 000 road accidents occur on the arteries of Karachi every year making it a worrisome place. Outcome of RTAs could be measured in tangible manner i. e., in term of number of life loss but <b>intangible</b> <b>losses</b> are very difficult to measure. In this paper an attempt has been made to capture the potential flaws in road geometry through Remote Sensing and embedding the land use data through the inventory of Geographic Information Systems. Moreover, overlay analysis techniques helps in identifying the high accident cost areas. In Karachi, over 35, 000 vehicles are involved in crashes every year, resulting in loss of life as well as wealth. The overall repair cost over the vehicles involved in all types of RTAs in year 2012 is more than 20, 000, 000 PKR with Landhi Town showing the highest cost. Shah Faisal Town showed the minimum repair cost of over 300, 000 due to its small aerial extent and lesser number of economic land use making it a safer place for vehicle users. Moreover, map of Karachi showing the spatial pattern of vehicle repair cost. It is suggested that the serious measures need to be undertaken to combat this problem...|$|E
40|$|This report {{estimates}} {{the costs of}} crime for the calendar year 2011. Executive summary This report seeks to estimate how much crime costs the Australian economy by calculating the number of crimes that come {{to the attention of}} the authorities and, using crime victimisation survey data, the number of crimes that are not recorded officially. A dollar figure is then calculated for each estimated crime event and an indication given of the total cost of each specific crime type in terms of actual loss, <b>intangible</b> <b>losses,</b> loss of output caused through the criminal conduct and other related costs such as medical expenses, where relevant. Added to these costs are the costs of preventing and responding to crime in the community including the costs of maintaining the criminal justice system agencies of police, prosecution, courts and correctional agencies, as well as a proportion of the costs of Australian and state and territory government agencies that have crime-related functions. Finally, a deduction is made for the value of property recovered in the case of property crime, as well as the amount of funds recovered from criminals under federal, state and territory proceeds of crime legislation. More detailed information about how each of these estimates was derived is provided in the main body of the report. Official attention paid to specific crime types, particularly drug-related crime and organised crime, affects both the reporting rate and also the cost of policing and correctional responses. In this sense, individual crime type costs and prevention and response costs are not mutually exclusive. Arguably, as individual crime types attract more attention, reporting rates increase and prevention and control of the crimes in question are seen as being deserving of increased resource...|$|E
