50|$|In {{a private}} company, because the {{shareholders}} {{and the board}} are usually the same people or closely connected with one another, private acquisitions are usually <b>friendly.</b> If the <b>shareholders</b> agree to sell the company, then the board is usually of the same mind or sufficiently under the orders of the equity shareholders {{to cooperate with the}} bidder. This point is not relevant to the UK concept of takeovers, which always involve the acquisition of a public company.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} two questions. First, why {{competition for}} funds among firms does not eliminate control benefits by inducing them to adopt more <b>shareholder</b> <b>friendly</b> governance provisions? Second, what determines {{the heterogeneity of}} the governance provisions among companies in the same jurisdiction? To address these questions we construct a simple model that incorporates the determination of a key corporate governance provision, the amount of control benefits, in the CAPM framework. Our model offers two main testable implications. First, stocks with a lower β have higher control benefits. Second, an increase in firm-specific cash flow volatility {{is associated with a}} decrease in control benefits extraction. CAPM regression. We test these propositions on a sample of U. S. companies and find that higher control benefits as measured by the index of Gompers, Ishii, and Metrick (2003) of antitakeover provisions (GIM Index) are higher in companies with lower β and with lower idiosyncratic volatility. Preliminary and incomplete draft. We thank Paul Laux and various seminar audiences for useful discussion...|$|R
40|$|Why does {{capital market}} {{competition}} among rms not eliminate control benets by inducing them to adopt more <b>shareholder</b> <b>friendly</b> governance provisions? What determines {{the heterogeneity of}} the governance provisions among companies? To address these questions we propose a model that endogenizes the determination of corporate governance quality in the asset pricing framework of the CAPM. The main insight is that if weak governance gives owner/managers some discretionary power it may be optimal for the controlling shareholder to choose a weak governance {{despite the fact that}} the market penalizes the stock price of rms that allow for the inecient extraction of control benets. Our model predicts that it is not always optimal to choose tough corporate governance rules and that governance is weaker when stocks have a lower and a lower idiosyncratic risk. We test these propositions on a sample of U. S. companies and nd that higher control benets as measured by the index of Gompers, Ishii, and Metrick (2003) are indeed higher in companies with lower and with lower idiosyncratic volatility...|$|R
40|$|The Anglo American {{economic}} model, {{together with}} its corporate governance practices, is frequently {{regarded as the}} optimal instrument for achieving competitiveness and enhancing investor confidence, even by countries which do not share the culture and tradition from which it originated. Its corporate governance structures, <b>shareholder</b> <b>friendly</b> laws and liquid capital markets {{with high levels of}} disclosure are regarded as mechanisms which can enable ‘global’ standards of efficiency, transparency and accountability to be achieved. Many countries outside of the US and UK are encouraged by the international financial community to attract foreign business and investment by emulating this model. But to what extent is this model suitable for countries outside of those in which it was developed? This article examines this issue in relation to South Korea, an economy traditionally based on a state-led developmental model, but which has since the 1990 s, experimented with the Anglo American model. Whilst many academics support the implementation of the Anglo American economic system on the basis that it will enable its economy to be competitive, others have counted the significant costs post implementation and have proposed alternative paths to economic growth. Some have {{gone so far as to}} suggest that the government should reject the Anglo American system altogether and instead, modernise the traditional state-guided growth model. This article argues that Korean policy makers need not adopt the Anglo American model wholesale, but can create an optimal environment for growth by combining the strengths of its traditional economic model with those under the Anglo American system...|$|R
