5|$|By June29, a trough, {{moving through}} the westerlies, rapidly {{approached}} the storm, causing the newly designated Amy to turn sharply toward the east. Strong wind shear disorganized the system slightly, leading to Amy featuring subtropical characteristics. By the evening, the strongest winds were not located around the center, but were instead situated between 60 and 90mi (95 and 140km) <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>center.</b> Convection became displaced <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> of circulation but the storm continued to intensify. Over the following several days, Amy tracked generally northeastward but underwent eastward jogs in response to rapidly moving troughs to the north.|$|E

5|$|While over land, {{a surface}} {{circulation}} developed near Orlando, and the National Hurricane Center designated {{the system as}} Subtropical Depression One. The subtropical designation was because the convection was far-removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>center.</b> Additionally, an upper-level trough provided outflow, instead of an anticyclone as found in tropical cyclones. The subtropical depression moved to the east-northeast, and steadily organized as deep convection developed closer to the center. Initially, the strongest winds were 175mi (280km) <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>center,</b> but by the morning of October5, the distance decreased to 85mi (135km). Based on its organization and winds of 40mph (65km/h), the system was re-designated as Tropical Storm Leslie.|$|E
5|$|A {{cold-core low}} {{pressure}} system near Gustav was forecast {{to have an}} effect on the development of the system; however, the tropical storm continued to intensify, attaining hurricane status around 1200UTC on August26. Not long after attaining hurricane-status, the ridge steering Gustav to the west began to break down, causing the hurricane to slowly turn towards the north. By 0600UTC on August27, the storm attained Category 2 intensity, with winds of 100mph (155km/h). Later that day, the storm made its closest approach to the Lesser Antilles, passing 205miles (330km) to the east. By this time, hurricane and tropical storm-force winds extended 35miles (55km) and 175miles (280km) <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> respectively.|$|E
5|$|A {{deepening}} trough {{over the}} eastern United States was forecast {{to turn the}} storm toward the north on August16. This turn took place earlier than forecasters anticipated. The storm slowly intensified as convection was displaced <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> of circulation; however, upper-level outflow was well-defined and intensification of the storm was expected as it tracked over the Gulf Stream. Later that day, Bob began to consolidate and a reconnaissance plane recorded hurricane-force winds at 1719UTC, following this reading, the NHC upgraded the storm to a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. Shortly after, the hurricane began to turn towards the north-northeast {{in response to a}} subtropical ridge over the Atlantic and the trough over the southeastern United States.|$|E

5|$|A low {{pressure}} area formed along a dissipating cold front {{to the north of}} Puerto Rico. The system moved westward, developing some tropical characteristics by October13. The next day, the system became a tropical storm over the Straits of Florida. On October15, it crossed over South Florida near Homestead with winds of 60mph (95km/h). The storm was never fully tropical, as its winds and precipitation extended far away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>center.</b> The storm intensified further over the Florida peninsula, peaking at 65mph (100km/h) early on October16. After affecting Florida, the storm crossed the western Atlantic and moved across the Outer Banks. The storm became extratropical on October17, and the next day it was absorbed by another extratropical storm.|$|E
5|$|A {{low-level}} circulation {{formed from}} the frontal cloud band on September 26 about 460miles (740km) east of central Florida. Dean was first identified {{on the afternoon}} of September 26 as a subtropical storm. An Air Force reconnaissance flight was sent to Dean on September 27 and only reported winds of 35mph (55km/h) at 23miles (37kilometres) <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>center.</b> A pressure of 999millibars (29.50inHg) indicated that Dean was strengthening as it headed northward. Additionally, satellite pictures showed that the subtropical cyclone was emerging from the cloud. This data also showed that the storm was gaining tropical characteristics and was given the name Dean {{on the afternoon of}} September 27.|$|E
5|$|A simple rule {{of thumb}} is that for {{high-pressure}} areas, where generally air flows <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> outward, the coriolis force given by the earth's rotation to the air circulation is in the opposite direction of earth's apparent rotation if viewed from above the hemisphere's pole. So, both the earth and winds around a low-pressure area rotate counter-clockwise in the northern hemisphere, and clockwise in the southern. The opposite to these two cases occurs {{in the case of a}} high. These results derive from the Coriolis effect; that article explains in detail the physics, and provides an animation of a model to aid understanding.|$|E

5|$|A {{subtropical}} cyclone is {{a weather}} {{system that has}} some characteristics of a tropical cyclone and some characteristics of an extratropical cyclone. They can form between the equator and the 50th parallel. As early as the 1950s, meteorologists were unclear whether they should be characterized as tropical cyclones or extratropical cyclones, and used terms such as quasi-tropical and semi-tropical to describe the cyclone hybrids. By 1972, the National Hurricane Center officially recognized this cyclone category. Subtropical cyclones began to receive names off the official tropical cyclone list in the Atlantic Basin in 2002. They have broad wind patterns with maximum sustained winds located farther <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> than typical tropical cyclones, and exist in areas of weak to moderate temperature gradient.|$|E

5|$|After {{becoming}} {{a tropical storm}} on August30, the subtropical ridge caused Leslie to turn west-northwestward. By the early on August31, the storm featured well-define outflow in all directions {{and the center of}} circulation was close to the main area of convection. Intensity estimates around that time indicated sustained wind speeds of 70mph (110km/h). However, intensification halted later on August31 as wind shear increased over the storm, causing convection to become displaced <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>center.</b> Early on September1, an eye-like feature appeared on satellite imagery; however, there was uncertainty {{as to whether or not}} the feature was displaced from the low-level center. The storm became increasingly disorganized, with the circulation displaced from the main convective area several hours later.|$|E
