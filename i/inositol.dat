25|$|In {{addition}} to its activity at adenosine receptors, caffeine is an <b>inositol</b> trisphosphate receptor 1 antagonist and a voltage-independent activator of the ryanodine receptors (RYR1, RYR2, and RYR3). It is also a competitive antagonist of the ionotropic glycine receptor.|$|E

Prescription products can be immediate release (Niacor, 500 mg tablets) or extended release (Niaspan, 500 and 1000 mg tablets). Dietary supplement products can be immediate or slow release, the latter including <b>inositol</b> hexanicotinate.|$|E
25|$|Serotonin 5-HT2 receptors are {{stimulated by}} monoamine neurotransmitters {{including}} serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine. 5-HT2 receptor stimulation causes {{a buildup of}} intracellular <b>inositol</b> triphosphate and thereby an increase of cytosolic Ca2+. 5-HT2C receptor agonists are attractive drug targets that have potential use {{in the treatment of}} a number of conditions including obesity, psychiatric disorders, sexual dysfunction and urinary incontinence.|$|E
25|$|Nutritional {{supplement}} {{treatment may}} be appropriate for major depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and obsessive compulsive disorder, the four most common mental disorders in developed countries. Supplements that have been studied most for mood elevation and stabilization include eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid (each of which an omega-3 fatty acid contained in fish oil but not in flaxseed oil), vitamin B12, folic acid, and <b>inositol.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Inositol</b> trisphosphate (IP3) {{functions}} as an intracellular second messenger, which initiates the intracellular release of calcium ions (which activates intracellular enzymes, causes {{the release of}} hormones and neurotransmitters from the cells {{in which they are}} stored, and causes smooth muscle contraction when released by IP3), and the activation of protein kinase C (PKC), which is then translocated from the cell cytoplasm to the cell membrane. Although <b>inositol</b> trisphosphate, (IP3), diffuses into the cytosol, diacylglycerol (DAG) remains within the plasma membrane, due to its hydrophobic properties. IP3 stimulates the release of calcium ions from the smooth endoplasmic reticulum, whereas DAG is a physiological activator of protein kinase C (PKC), promoting its translocation from the cytosol to the plasma membrane. PKC is a multifunctional protein kinase which phosphorylates serine and threonine residues in many target proteins. However PKC is only active in the presence of calcium ions, and it is DAG that increases the affinity of PKC for Ca2+ and thereby renders it active at the physiological intracellular levels of this ion.|$|E
25|$|Because most {{malignant}} cells rely on {{the activity}} of the protein telomerase for their immortality, it has been proposed that a drug that inactivates telomerase might be effective against a broad spectrum of malignancies. At the same time, most healthy tissues in the body express little if any telomerase, and would function normally in its absence. Currently, <b>inositol</b> hexaphosphate, which is available over-the-counter, is undergoing testing in cancer research due to its telomerase-inhibiting abilities.|$|E
25|$|PLC cleaves the {{phospholipid}} phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into diacyl glycerol (DAG) and <b>inositol</b> 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). Thus PLC has {{a profound}} impact on the depletion of PIP2, which acts as a membrane anchor or allosteric regulator. PIP2 also acts as the substrate for synthesis of the rarer lipid phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3), which is responsible for signaling in multiple reactions. Therefore, PIP2 depletion by the PLC reaction is critical to the regulation of local PIP2 concentrations both in the plasma membrane and the nuclear membrane.|$|E
25|$|In the phosphatidylinositol signal pathway, the {{extracellular}} signal molecule binds with the G-protein receptor (Gq) {{on the cell}} surface and activates phospholipase C, which {{is located on the}} plasma membrane. The lipase hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into two second messengers: <b>inositol</b> 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). IP3 binds with the IP3 receptor in the membrane of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria to open Ca2+ channels. DAG helps activate protein kinase C (PKC), which phosphorylates many other proteins, changing their catalytic activities, leading to cellular responses.|$|E
25|$|The actin {{protein is}} found in both the {{cytoplasm}} and the cell nucleus. Its location is regulated by cell membrane signal transduction pathways that integrate the stimuli that a cell receives stimulating the restructuring of the actin networks in response. In Dictyostelium, phospholipase D {{has been found to}} intervene in <b>inositol</b> phosphate pathways. Actin filaments are particularly stable and abundant in muscle fibres. Within the sarcomere (the basic morphological and physiological unit of muscle fibres) actin is present in both the I and A bands; myosin is also present in the latter.|$|E
25|$|PLCβ hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP2), a {{phospholipid}} {{found in}} the cell membrane, into soluble <b>inositol</b> triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG), which stays in the cell membrane. DAG or a derivative of DAG causes a calcium-selective ion channel known as transient receptor potential (TRP) to open and calcium and sodium flows into the cell. IP3 is thought to bind to IP3 receptors in the subrhabdomeric cisternae, {{an extension of the}} endoplasmic reticulum, and cause release of calcium, but this process {{does not seem to be}} essential for normal vision.|$|E
25|$|ADP on {{the other}} hand binds to purinergic receptors on {{platelet}} surface. Since the thrombocytic purinergic receptor P2Y12 is coupled to Gi proteins, ADP reduces platelet adenylate cyclase activity and cAMP production, leading to accumulation of calcium inside the platelet by inactivating the cAMP calcium efflux pump. The other ADP-receptor P2Y1 couples to Gq that activates phospholipase C-beta 2 PLCB2, resulting in <b>inositol</b> 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)generation and intracellular release of more calcium. This together induces platelet activation. Endothelial ADPase degrades ADP and prevents this from happening. Clopidogrel and related antiplatelet medications also work as purinergic receptor P2Y12 antagonists.|$|E
25|$|Upon its {{initiation}} via {{activation of}} e.g. TLRs by pathogen stimuli miR-155-5p {{functions as a}} post-transcriptional regulator of innate immune signaling pathways. Importantly, miR-155-5p displays a similar responsivenes to pathogen stimuli (e.g. TLR4 agonist LPS) as major pro-inflammatory marker mRNAs. Once activated, miR-155-5p suppresses negative regulators of inflammation. These include <b>inositol</b> polyphosphate-5-phosphatase (INPP5D also denoted SHIP1) and suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1), suppression of which promotes cell survival, growth, migration, and anti-pathogen responses. Besides supporting the activation of defense pathways miR-155-5p may also limit {{the strength of the}} resulting NF-κB dependent inflammatory response, suggesting varying functions of miR-155 at different stages of inflammation.|$|E
25|$|The {{release of}} calcium ions from the {{endoplasmic}} reticulum into the cytosol results in its binding to signaling proteins that are then activated; {{it is then}} sequestered in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum and the mitochondria. Two combined receptor/ion channel proteins control the transport of calcium: the InsP3-receptor that transports calcium upon interaction with <b>inositol</b> triphosphate on its cytosolic side; and the ryanodine receptor named after the alkaloid ryanodine, similar to the InsP3 receptor but having a feedback mechanism that releases more calcium upon binding with it. The nature of calcium in the cytosol means that it is active for only a very short time, meaning its free state concentration is very low and is mostly bound to organelle molecules like calreticulin when inactive.|$|E
25|$|The {{effector}} of the Gαq/11 pathway is phospholipase C-β (PLCβ), which catalyzes the cleavage of membrane-bound phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate (PIP2) {{into the}} second messengers <b>inositol</b> (1,4,5) trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). IP3 acts on IP3 receptors found in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to elicit Ca2+ release from the ER, while DAG diffuses along the plasma membrane where it may activate any membrane localized forms of a second ser/thr kinase called protein kinase C (PKC). Since many isoforms of PKC are also activated by increases in intracellular Ca2+, both these pathways can also converge on each other to signal through the same secondary effector. Elevated intracellular Ca2+ also binds and allosterically activates proteins called calmodulins, which in turn go on to bind and allosterically activate enzymes such as Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinases (CAMKs).|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, the P50 {{value is}} {{influenced}} by differing organic modulators. In the typical mammalian RBC 2,3 – DPG causes a lower affinity for oxygen. 2,3- DPG constitutes approximately 42–47%, of the cells phosphate of the embryonic ostrich. However, the adult ostrich have no traceable 2,3- DPG.In place of 2,3-DPG the ostrich uses <b>inositol</b> polyphosphates (IPP), which vary from 1–6 phosphates per molecule. In relation to the IPP, the ostrich also uses ATP to lower oxygen affinity. ATP has a consistent concentration of phosphate in the cell. Around 31% at incubation periods, and dropping to 16–20% in 36-day-old chicks. However, IPP has low concentrations, around 4%, of total phosphate concentration in embryonic stages; However, the IPP concentration jumps to 60% of total phosphate of the cell. The majority of phosphate concentration switches from 2,3- DPG to IPP, suggesting {{the result of the}} overall low oxygen affinity is due to these varying polyphosphates.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the subset of potassium channels that are directly gated by G proteins, G proteins can also directly gate certain calcium ion channels in neuronal cell membranes. Although membrane ion channels and protein phosphorylation are typically indirectly affected by G protein-coupled receptors via effector proteins (such as phospholipase C and adenylyl cyclase) and second messengers (such as <b>inositol</b> triphosphate, diacylglycerol and cyclic AMP), G proteins can short circuit the second-messenger pathway and gate the ion channels directly. Such bypassing of the second-messenger pathways is observed in mammalian cardiac myocytes and associated sarcolemmal vesicles in which Ca2+ channels are able to survive and function {{in the absence of}} cAMP, ATP or protein kinase C when {{in the presence of the}} activated α-subunit of the G protein. For example, Gα, which is stimulatory to adenylyl cyclase, acts on the Ca2+ channel directly as an effector. This short circuit is membrane-delimiting, allowing direct gating of calcium channels by G proteins to produce effects more quickly than the cAMP cascade could. This direct gating has also been found in specific Ca2+ channels in the heart and skeletal muscle T tubules.|$|E
25|$|As a neurotoxin, ethanol {{has been}} shown to induce nervous system damage and affect the body in a variety of ways. Among the known effects of ethanol {{exposure}} are both transient and lasting consequences. Some of the lasting effects include long-term reduced neurogenesis in the hippocampus, widespread brain atrophy, and induced inflammation in the brain. Of note, chronic ethanol ingestion has additionally been shown to induce reorganization of cellular membrane constituents, leading to a lipid bilayer marked by increased membrane concentrations of cholesterol and saturated fat. This is important as neurotransmitter transport can be impaired through vesicular transport inhibition, resulting in diminished neural network function. One significant example of reduced inter-neuron communication is the ability for ethanol to inhibit NMDA receptors in the hippocampus, resulting in reduced long-term potentiation (LTP) and memory acquisition. NMDA {{has been shown}} {{to play an important role}} in LTP and consequently memory formation. With chronic ethanol intake, however, the susceptibility of these NMDA receptors to induce LTP increases in the mesolimbic dopamine neurons in an <b>inositol</b> 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) dependent manner. This reorganization may lead to neuronal cytotoxicity both through hyperactivation of postsynaptic neurons and through induced addiction to continuous ethanol consumption. It has, additionally, been shown that ethanol directly reduces intracellular calcium ion accumulation through inhibited NMDA receptor activity, and thus reduces the capacity for the occurrence of LTP.|$|E

2500|$|The {{calcium ion}} {{concentration}} in the cytosol of the beta cells can also, or additionally, be increased through the activation of phospholipase C resulting from the binding of an extracellular ligand (hormone or neurotransmitter) to a G protein-coupled membrane receptor. Phospholipase C cleaves the membrane phospholipid, phosphatidyl <b>inositol</b> 4,5-bisphosphate, into <b>inositol</b> 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol. <b>Inositol</b> 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) then binds to receptor proteins in the plasma membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This allows the release of Ca2+ ions from the ER via IP3-gated channels, which raises the cytosolic concentration of calcium ions independently {{of the effects of}} a high blood glucose concentration. Parasympathetic stimulation of the pancreatic islets operates via this pathway to increase insulin secretion into the blood.|$|E

2500|$|Both DAG and IP3 are {{substrates}} for {{the synthesis}} of regulatory molecules. DAG is the substrate for {{the synthesis of}} phosphatidic acid, a regulatory molecule.

2500|$|The primary catalyzed {{reaction}} of PLC occurs on an insoluble substrate at a lipid-water interface. The residues {{in the active}} site are conserved in all PLC isotypes. In animals, PLC selectively catalyzes the hydrolysis of the phospholipid, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), on the glycerol side of the phosphodiester bond. [...] There is {{the formation of a}} weakly enzyme-bound intermediate, <b>inositol</b> 1,2-cyclic phosphodiester, and release of diacyl glycerol (DAG). The intermediate is then hydrolyzed to <b>inositol</b> 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). Thus the two end products are DAG and IP3. The acid/base catalysis requires two conserved histidine residues and a Ca2+ ion is needed for PIP2 hydrolysis. It has been observed that the active-site Ca2+ coordinates with four acidic residues and if any of the residues are mutated then a greater Ca2+ concentration is needed for catalysis.|$|E
2500|$|One form {{of dietary}} {{supplement}} is <b>inositol</b> hexanicotinate (IHN), which is <b>inositol</b> {{that has been}} esterified with niacin on all six of inositol's alcohol groups.

It is sold as an over-the-counter formulation, and often is marketed and labeled as niacin, thus misleading consumers into thinking they are getting the active form of the medication. [...] While this form of niacin does not cause the flushing associated with the immediate-release products, the evidence that it has lipid-modifying functions is disputed. As the clinical trials date from the early 1960s (Dorner, Welsh) or the late 1970s (Ziliotto, Kruse, Agusti), {{it is difficult to}} assess them by today's standards. One of the last of those studies affirmed the superiority of <b>inositol</b> and xantinol esters of nicotinic acid for reducing serum free fatty acid, but other studies conducted during the same period found no benefit. Studies explain that this is primarily because [...] "flush-free" [...] preparations do not contain any free nicotinic acid. [...] A more recent placebo-controlled trial was small (n=11/group), but results after three months at 1500mg/day showed no trend for improvements in total cholesterol, LDL-C, HDL-C or triglycerides.

2500|$|Biological {{membranes}} {{are found}} in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. They surround cells and organelles with a semi-permeable barrier that prevents free flow of substances. The membrane consists of a phospholipid bilayer structure and often embedded or otherwise associated proteins, along with cholesterol and glycolipids. The phospholipid bilayer is a two-layer structure mainly composed of phospholipids, which are amphiphilic molecules that have hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions. The hydrophilic region contains the polar head group. This region is exposed to aqueous substances located mainly in the exterior portion of the biomembrane. The hydrophilic region consists of the non-polar acyl chains or fatty acids groups facing {{the interior of the}} biomembrane. Phospholipids consist of two non-polar hydrocarbon chains with ester or ether bonds to the phosphate group which is also linked by ester or ether bonds to the polar hydrophilic region. The phospholipid carries a negative charge due to the presence of the phosphate group.

2500|$|The 5-HT2C receptors are G protein–coupled receptors {{that are}} coupled to {{phospholipase}} C (PLC) via Gαq, phospholipase A2 (PLA2), and possibly Gα13.

2500|$|Variations in {{hemoglobin}} {{amino acid}} sequences, {{as with other}} proteins, may be adaptive. For example, hemoglobin {{has been found to}} adapt in different ways to high altitudes. Organisms living at high elevations experience lower partial pressures of oxygen compared to those at sea level. This presents a challenge to the organisms that inhabit such environments because hemoglobin, which normally binds oxygen at high partial pressures of oxygen, must be able to bind oxygen when it is present at a lower pressure. Different organisms have adapted to such a challenge. For example, recent studies have suggested genetic variants in deer mice that help explain how deer mice that live in the mountains are able to survive in the thin air that accompanies high altitudes. A researcher from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln found mutations in four different genes that can account for differences between deer mice that live in lowland prairies versus the mountains. After examining wild mice captured from both highlands and lowlands, it was found that: the genes of the two breeds are [...] "virtually identical–except for those that govern the oxygen-carrying capacity of their hemoglobin". [...] "The genetic difference enables highland mice to make more efficient use of their oxygen", since less is available at higher altitudes, such as those in the mountains. Mammoth hemoglobin featured mutations that allowed for oxygen delivery at lower temperatures, thus enabling mammoths to migrate to higher latitudes during the Pleistocene. This was also found in hummingbirds that inhabit the Andes. Hummingbirds already expend a lot of energy and thus have high oxygen demands and yet Andean hummingbirds have been found to thrive in high altitudes. Non-synonymous mutations in the hemoglobin gene of multiple species living at high elevations (Oreotrochilus, A. castelnaudii, C. violifer, P. gigas, and A. viridicuada) have caused the protein to have less of an affinity for <b>inositol</b> hexaphosphate (IHP), a molecule found in birds that has a similar role as 2,3-BPG in humans; this results in the ability to bind oxygen in lower partial pressures.|$|E
