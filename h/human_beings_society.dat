40|$|It is {{well known}} {{nowadays}} that mass-production of artifacts does not link directly to happiness of <b>human</b> <b>beings.</b> <b>Society,</b> however, cannot get out from the paradigm of mass-production. The mission of engineering needs to be reformulated. Under this context, an objective of the “artifactual engineering” 1) is the investigation of a new style of engineering, which would increase directly the happiness of mankind and our environment. A key of “artifactual engineering ” is design of artifacts as devices to transfer, supply and amplify services. In the past engineering activities we focused only on the function of artifacts, but from now on we design consumers ’ satisfaction rather than designers ’ interests. “Service engineering ” is an engineering technique to yield increased value and satisfaction by providing services as defined in Fig. 1; it is also leading to a cost reduction, useful not only for service sectors, {{but also to the}} manufacturing sectors as a method to increase added-value. We have proposed a “service CAD” called Service Explorer, which gives an aid for engineers in the design procedure of service. The purpose of the CAD is to serv...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Even though {{civilization is}} {{developing}} {{at a fast}} rate, human beings and their living environments do not look happy. Given that the civilization comes from the human mind, which is changing in interaction with human body, society, and nature, {{it is hard to}} think that the human mind is changing in the desirable direction. This paper described a whole changing paradigm of the human mind and its causes through the cognitive mechanism in the brain from which all the diverse minds are formed. According to the cognitive mechanism, the human mind can change from the first free and peaceful mind through the middle mind to the last obsessive and anguish mind in accordance with the change of one of the factors in the origin of the human mind. Today's unfavorable changes in <b>human</b> <b>beings,</b> <b>society,</b> and the natural environment including the excessive development of civilization are the results of the undesirable changes of the human mind. This paper specified the respective characteristics of the first, middle, and the last mind and discussed where individuals' minds are and where they are going.

Production, and dissemination of knowledge have become the crucial activity in any developed society, and it is been carried out in Universities. We have become a knowledge based society.

No society can grow without caring for the creation of knowledge, as it has become the critical element for growth, progressive development and sustainability.

The current report, hence, focuses on the efforts of Calicut University in promoting research both qualitatively and quantitatively. The design of a comprehensive research policy, framing the appropriate strategies, for growth and implementing the decisions taken in this regard has become the land marks in the history of University.

30|$|Unfortunately, {{this paper}} {{does not provide}} any answers but rather wishes to raise some {{questions}} for debate. Certainly, the advent of technology solves nothing automatically but rather continues to pose problems and multiply uncertainties. Even recent scholars {{who would be the}} most predisposed to welcome the new technological age have doubts. Khanna and Khanna implore us to consider Tecnick not only as technology in the most arid and purely deterministic sense that does not include any reflection on its effects on <b>human</b> <b>beings,</b> <b>society</b> and the environment. Much more important is “Tecnick as the technological quotient of a civilization” in a field where postmodern society determines the rules responsible for actively and regularly managing technology (Khanna and Khanna, 2012) that seek to anticipate risks, and prepare the capacity to defend against, stop, modify or even fully renounce distortionary processes if necessary. If it is clear we need technology and we cannot give up, it is equally important to agree to a critical and independent debate on its effects in many fields, including planning. The enabling power of technology is far more seductive today and it can reduce the spaces of the debate on its impacts on our sociality, on our idea of city and urban living, on our idea of energy, food, and nature, and on our ability to care for the environment and landscape. Surely it is easier to let technology decide the future of our lives, stringing us along, but this would, however, reduce us to a chronic dependence on and uncritical acceptance of technology in its most deterministic and insidious forms.|$|E

40|$|Formation of an {{independent}} democratic Belarusian state is inextricably linked with transformations {{in all aspects of}} public life and, first of all, in economy. Economic reforms in Belarus are directed on creation of socially oriented market economic system, which will ensure the most efficient usage of resources at minimum social cost. In the social economy concepts of “equality” and “poverty” are considered as basic ones. Social security services are based on these concepts and role of the social security in any country is to reduce poverty and increase equality. In modern world poverty is uniquely associated with a low level of economic development and its eradication is the first step on the path to economic growth. As for inequality, such clear connection of this concept with economic development can not be traced. There are various theories explaining the impact of inequality on economic growth. However, they cannot be considered satisfactory because they predict opposite results. Several studies have universally postulated a security as protection of vital interests of a <b>human</b> <b>being,</b> <b>society</b> and State from internal and external threats. Vital interests comprise a set of needs and satisfaction of these needs reliably ensures existence and possibility of progressive development of a <b>human</b> <b>being,</b> <b>society</b> and State which are the main objects of the security. Presence of a hierarchical structure for organization of the system or its subsystems is an essential feature for any socio-economic system. The economy is a poly-hierarchical system.

This requires us to rethink and reflect upon the very existence of <b>human</b> <b>beings,</b> <b>societies,</b> nations, and the entire world. It is an urgent task for us, social scientists, to explore and study new socio-economic thought for this small and narrow earth. We are led to a consideration of a normative theory for the earth as unity, and also to various theoretical and empirical studies for practical management of the earth. Although we will see that these are contradictory in various respects, we should, at least, try to reconcile them to save our future. Save this small earth! Strain our small brains...|$|R

40|$|Vladimir Solovyov (1853 – 1900), a great Russian philosopher of religion, in {{his concept}} of all-unity assumed an {{integrity}} of a <b>human</b> <b>being</b> and his natural drive towards realization of an ideal of good, truth and beauty. He was voicing a belief that these values, being an ethical imperative, should be rooted in foundations of faith in that morality, hidden inside us and manifested through conscience and reason, synthetizes everything that a person does. Believing that good – in nature, in a <b>human</b> <b>being,</b> <b>society</b> and history – has a Devine provenance, the philosopher was also emphasizing the need for action which proves a human calling to fulfil what is good – on every level of participation in life. This belief, shaken a bit {{towards the end of}} the philosopher’s life as a result of his difficult life experiences, remained strong enough to find its expression in the last decade of the 19 th century in an important treatise The Justification of the Good (Оправдание добра), which to a significant degree is an attempt to “deal with” I.

The aim of this research was to investigate if, why, and how this ontological and existential concern may become part of architectural design.
