5000|$|Ion-exchange {{membranes}} transport dissolved ions {{across a}} conductive polymeric membrane. [...] The membranes {{are often used}} in desalination and chemical recovery applications, moving ions from one solution to another with little passage of water. Ion-exchange membranes are made of a polymeric material attached to charged ion groups. Anion-exchange membranes contain fixed cationic groups with predominantly mobile anions; because anions are the majority species, most of the conductivity is due to anion transport. Cation-exchange membranes contain fixed anionic groups with predominantly mobile cations; because cations are the majority species, most of the conductivity is due to cation transport. The selectivity of the membranes is due to Donnan equilibrium and Donnan exclusion and not due to physically blocking or electrostatically excluding specific charged species. There are two primary classes of membranes: heterogeneous and homogeneous. Heterogeneous membranes have low cost and a thicker composition with higher resistance and a rough surface that can be subject to fouling. Homogeneous membranes are more expensive, but have a thinner composition with lower resistance and a smooth surface, less susceptible to fouling. <b>Homogeneous</b> <b>membrane</b> surfaces can be modified to alter the membrane permselectivity to protons, monovalent ions, and divalent ions.|$|E
40|$|We {{hypothesize that}} the {{properties}} of proton-exchange membranes for fuel cell applications cannot be described unambiguously unless interface effects are taken into account. In order to prove this, we first develop a thermodynamically consistent description of the transport properties in the membranes, both for a <b>homogeneous</b> <b>membrane</b> and for a <b>homogeneous</b> <b>membrane</b> with two surface layers {{in contact with the}} electrodes or holder material. For each subsystem, <b>homogeneous</b> <b>membrane,</b> and the two surface layers, we limit ourselves to four parameters as the system as a whole is considered to be isothermal. We subsequently analyze the experimental results on some standard membranes that have appeared in the literature and analyze these using the two different descriptions. This analysis yields relatively well-defined values for the <b>homogeneous</b> <b>membrane</b> parameters and estimates for those of the surface layers and hence supports our hypothesis. As demonstrated, the method used here allows for a critical evaluation of the literature values. Moreover, it allows optimization of stacked transport systems such as proton-exchange membrane fuel cell units where interfacial layers, such as that between the catalyst and membrane, are taken into account systematically...|$|E

The compatibility between the active layer and PEK-C substrate is improved by immersing the PEK-C substrate in a GA cross-linked sodium alginate (NaAlg) solution and using water-dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as a co-solvent for preparing the STA-PVA-SPEK-C/GA active layer. The pervaporation (PV) dehydration of acetic acid shows that permeation flux decreased and separation factor increased with increasing GA {{content in the}} <b>homogeneous</b> <b>membranes.</b> The permeation flux achieved a minimum and the separation factor a maximum when the GA content increased to a certain amount.

40|$|In this thesis, {{we study}} the {{long-range}} behaviour of polymerized membranes using a nonperturbative renormalization group (NPRG) approach. We start by presenting the NPRG after which we introduce membranes systems. In our work, we concentrate on polymerized membranes of different types: homogeneous, anisotropic and quench disordered. Moreover {{as a side}} project, we work on Lifshitz critical behaviour (LCB) in magnetic systems. Our results, both for polymerized membranes and LCB, compare well with weak-coupling, low-temperature and large-d (or large-n for LCB) perturbative results in the limiting cases. But more importantly the need of a non-perturbative approach is justified {{by the fact that}} the physically interesting have been difficult to compute. A long-standing question in <b>homogeneous</b> <b>membranes</b> is the order of the transition between the crumpled and flat phases. Although we do not have a definite answer, our results seem to indicate that the transition is first order in agreement with recent Monte Carlo simulations. An interesting feature of <b>homogeneous</b> <b>membranes</b> is the existence of the flat phase at low-temperature with a non-trivial behaviour.

40|$|The linear phenomenological {{equations}} giving particle {{and practical}} fluxes {{of a single}} electrolyte across an ion-selective membrane are stated and interrelated. It is shown that the experimental measurements commonly made in biological and synthetic membrane studies may be used, with minor modification, to obtain the phenomenological transport coefficients and their concentration dependences. It is demonstrated that the electrical properties of a <b>homogeneous</b> <b>membrane</b> may be obtained as functions of the bathing solution concentration by combining fluxes measured under open and short circuit. Attention is paid {{to the use of}} radiotracers when measuring ionic fluxes. To obtain all the phenomenological coefficients at least one measurement must be made under a pressure gradient. The experimental difficulties in such measurements are discussed and the merits and demerits of various experiments considered. The problems of measuring potentials and concentrations at the low pressure face of a supported membrane make several mathematically simple approaches experimentally unattractive. The best methods appear to be either the measurement of a succession of “apparent osmotic pressures” under concentration differences sufficiently small that the membrane does not require support or the study of “reverse osmosis”. Sets of equations are given which enable the phenomenological coefficients to be evaluated from convenient experiments.
