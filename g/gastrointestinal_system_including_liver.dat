ABD-complicated gastroenteropathy is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality, with abdominal pain as the most common symptom.

40|$|The {{microbial}} {{community of the}} <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>system</b> has {{an enormous impact on}} the vertebrate host. The relationship begins at birth or hatch and evolves to a stable ecosystem in which diverse, and unique, niches are created and inhabited by microorganisms. These microbial populations tend to be similar within a host species (and even across host species), but each system is a unique construct resulting from its individual history of mutual influence. The development of the system, both microbial and host, begins in the perinatal animal. The timing of this developmental process is suggestive of imprinting, the process of epigenetic evolution of somatic stem cells. (Imprinted changes are thought not to involve the germ line, i. e., are not inherited by the next generation of the host animal, but are genetic changes that can be passed on to the daughter cells of the imprinted proliferative stem cell.) This review briefly discusses the development of the <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>system,</b> <b>including</b> both the microbiota and its perinatal host. The effects of the microflora on enteric and immune cells are described. Effects of attempts to restrict contact between the mucosal immune system and the microbiota are addressed, along with further data that would be required to demonstrate that the effects of the gut microbiota on mucosal immune development are restricted to an ontogenetic window. Finally, the consequences of a failure to achieve a relationship of mutual tolerance between the microbiota and the host and some mechanisms to facilitate this process are discussed.

Two spin traps phenyl-t-butyl nitrone (PBN) and 4 -pyridyl- 1 -oxide-t-butyl nitrone (4 -POBN) have been tested for their effects on hepatocyte viability and mixed-function oxidase activity. High concentration of PBN but not of 4 -POBN proved to moderately affect liver cell integrity, without interfering with intracellular ATP or cytochrome P- 450 content. PBN also decreased hepatocyte GSH content, probably {{as the result of}} its metabolism to benzaldehyde. The two spin traps were found to inhibit aminopyrine demethylase and ethoxycoumarin deethylase activity in hepatocytes and microsomes. At low concentrations (1 – 5 mM) PBN enhanced aniline hydroxylase while high concentrations of the spin trap inhibited this activity. The inhibition of the monooxygenase system was not caused by damage of microsomal enzymes, but rather by competition with other substrates for the binding to the haemoprotein.

40|$|Background: The pro-fibrogenic {{cytokine}} {{connective tissue}} growth factor (CTGF) {{plays an important}} role in the development and progression of fibrosis in many organ <b>systems,</b> <b>including</b> <b>liver.</b> However, its role in the pathogenesis of hepatitis C virus (HCV) -induced liver fibrosis remains unclear. Methods: In the present study, we assessed CTGF expression in HCV-infected hepatocytes using replicon cells containing full-length HCV genotype 1 and the infectious HCV clone JFH 1 (HCV genotype 2) by real-time PCR, Western blot analysis and confocal microscopy. We evaluated transforming growth factor b 1 (TGF-b 1) as a key upstream mediator of CTGF production using neutralizing antibodies and shRNAs. We also determined the signaling molecules involved in CTGF production using various immunological techniques. Results: We demonstrated an enhanced expression of CTGF in two independent models of HCV infection. We also demonstrated that HCV induced CTGF expression in a TGF-b 1 -dependent manner. Further dissection of the molecular mechanisms revealed that CTGF production was mediated through sequential activation of MAPkinase and Smad-dependent pathways. Finally, to determine whether CTGF regulates fibrosis, we showed that shRNA-mediated knock-down of CTGF resulted in reduced expression of fibrotic markers in HCV replicon cells. Conclusion: Our studies demonstrate a central role for CTGF expression in HCV-induced liver fibrosis and highlight th...|$|R
40|$|Background and Purpose: Gut {{microbiota}} {{is essential}} {{for the development of the}} <b>gastrointestinal</b> <b>system,</b> <b>including</b> the enteric nervous system (ENS). Perturbations of gut microbiota in early life have the potential to alter neurodevelopment leading to functional bowel disorders later in life. We examined the hypothesis that gut dysbiosis impairs the structural and functional integrity of the ENS, leading to gut dysmotility in juvenile mice. Experimental Approach: To induce gut dysbiosis, broad-spectrum antibiotics were administered by gavage to juvenile (3 weeks old) male C 57 Bl/ 6 mice for 14 days. Bile acid composition in the intestinal lumen was analysed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Changes in intestinal motility were evaluated by stool frequency, transit of a fluorescent-labelled marker and isometric muscle responses of ileal full-thickness preparations to receptor and non-receptor-mediated stimuli. Alterations in ENS integrity were assessed by immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis. Key Results: Antibiotic treatment altered gastrointestinal transit, luminal bile acid metabolism and bowel architecture. Gut dysbiosis resulted in distorted glial network, loss of myenteric plexus neurons, altered cholinergic, tachykininergic and nitrergic neurotransmission associated with reduced number of nNOS neurons and different ileal distribution of the toll-like receptor TLR 2. Functional defects were partly reversed by activation of TLR 2 signalling. Conclusions and Implications: Gut dysbiosis caused complex morpho-functional neuromuscular rearrangements, characterized by structural defects of the ENS and increased tachykininergic neurotransmission. Altogether, our findings support the beneficial role of enteric microbiota for ENS homeostasis instrumental in ensuring proper gut neuromuscular function during critical stages of development...|$|R

During fibrogenesis, PDGF is secreted by a variety of cell types as a response to injury, and many pro-inflammatory cytokines mediate their mitogenic effects via the autocrine release of PDGF. PDGF action is determined by the relative expression of PDGF �-receptors (PDGFR�) and �-receptors (PDGFR�) on the surface of myofibroblasts.

Methods Forty-nine youth with IBD (ages 10 – 18) and a parent completed measures of demographics, parent QoL, and youth QoL. Youth DA ratings were obtained from medical records. Results Parental QoL was higher in several domains compared to the normative sample, with the greatest differences reported in physical functioning domains. Although patient demographic factors did not explain significant variance in parent QoL, greater DA was associated with lower parent QoL in mental health (MH) and physical health (PH) domains. Higher youth QoL was associated with higher parent QoL in the MH domain only.

The degree of genetic exchange and the tissues affected have not been well studied in this group. For this study five microsatellite markers {{were used to assess}} the extent and distribution of genetic exchange in Callithrix kuhlii between thirty-six sets of twins with known parentage. The inheritance of markers was traced across twin sets and throughout the tissues. All of the tissue types sampled were found to be chimeric in a number of individuals. Tissues derived from the hematopoietic <b>system</b> <b>including</b> <b>liver,</b> blood and spleen were found to differ significantly in their rate of chimerism from all other tissues. However, the ratio of chimeric cells within each tissue type varied greatly between individuals. Five of the fifteen family groups analyzed were found to have at least one parent that transmitted their sibling alleles to their offspring. Further, while other female mammalian chimeras have been shown to exhibit sterility as a result of chimerism, chimeric female marmosets were shown to not only maintain fertility, but also exhibit similar rates of chimerism as males in the population. The presence of genetic chimerism and the influence of genetic conflict on the evolution of cooperative breeding in callitrichids were also explored. The presence of sibling alleles throughout the body including the germ-line cells increased values of relatedness between alloparents and between multiply sired offspring and their fathers. The study of this unique system provides insights into genomic conflict in a vertebrate, the evolution of alloparental care in callitrichids, and provides the first analysis of the influences of genetic chimerism on the sociality of a vertebrate species. ...|$|R
40|$|The obesity {{epidemic}} is now {{widely recognized as}} {{a major threat to}} health in many different countries. Some surgical therapies for obesity are efficacious and indicate that signals from the gastrointestinal tract are capable of exerting beneficial long-term effects on food intake and body weight. The development of non-surgical therapies targeting this system depends on understanding how food, and the absence of food, in the gastrointestinal tract signals to those parts of the brain that regulate feeding behaviour. What can be called <b>gastrointestinal</b> surveillance <b>systems</b> <b>include</b> both nervous pathways linking the gut and brain, and some gut hormones. Nutrient sensing mechanisms within the gastrointestinal tract determine the release of satiety hormones such as cholecystokinin (CCK), or appetite stimulating hormones such as ghrelin, and offer potential therapeutic targets. It seems that CCK and ghrelin both act on the vagus nerve that links the gut to the brain. Examples of interactions between different factors regulating this pathway are discussed.
