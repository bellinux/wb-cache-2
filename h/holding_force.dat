25|$|The {{simplest}} {{example of}} a one sided flux magnet is a refrigerator magnet. These are usually composed of powdered ferrite in a binder such as plastic or rubber. The extruded magnet is exposed to a rotating field giving the ferrite particles in the magnetic compound a magnetization resulting in a one-sided flux distribution. This distribution increases the <b>holding</b> <b>force</b> of the magnet when placed on a permeable surface, compared to the <b>holding</b> <b>force</b> from, say, a uniform magnetization of the magnetic compound.|$|E

On 19 June MacDonald's entire army was concentrated and he ordered an attack which was poorly coordinated and repulsed at all points. Realizing that assistance from Moreau was not forthcoming, that night MacDonald ordered the beaten French army to slip away to the south and west. On the 20th the Allies overran a French demi brigade acting as rear guard. Instead of bringing a powerful reinforcement to the hard-pressed French in northwest Italy, only the crippled remains of MacDonald's army arrived.|$|E

The results show that drawing stress decreases and elongation rate increases {{with the increase of}} grain size, the concentrated force area of cylinder-shaped part is transferred from the area punch fillet to die fillet area. Twin grain ratio and twinning degree near the punch fillet are increasing. Twin grain distribution becomes uneven with the increase of grain size.

James Shields to converge on Jackson south of Massanutten Mountain. [...] Jackson {{was determined to}} attack the two Union columns separately and arranged half of his troops to block Shields {{on the right side}} of the mountain, while the other half, commanded by Maj. Gen. Richard S. Ewell, blocked the left side. [...] Jackson's wish was realized when, on June 8, Frémont's army attacked. [...] Frémont, believing he was striking Jackson's rear, instead attacked Ewell head-on, and Jackson soon brought his whole force to bear on the Union troops in the Battle of Cross Keys. [...] The men of the 68th came under concentrated fire for the first time but were not heavily involved in the battle, although two men were killed. [...] The battle was a defeat for the Union, and Frémont's force did not attack again, being blocked instead by a small <b>holding</b> <b>force</b> from Ewell's wing. [...] The rest of Jackson's force then turned to attack Shields's army the next day at Port Republic, but Frémont's infantry did not figure in the battle, another Confederate victory, though his artillery shelled the enemy from long range.|$|E

2500|$|The {{principal}} {{mission of}} the ouvrage was to cover {{the east side of}} the Moselle valley. In 1940 German forces largely bypassed the Moselle, enveloping Thionville from the rear. [...] Métrich and other ouvrages in the Thionville sector therefore surrendered after the Second Armistice at Compiègne of 22 June. During the Occupation support areas of the ouvrage were transformed by German occupiers into offices and manufacturing facilities. Some of the combat blocks were used by the Germans for testing of explosives. In 1944 Métrich was held by the [...] 74th Volksgrenadier Regiment of the 19th Volksgrenadier Division. Métrich was attacked on 10 November 1944 by the U.S. 90th Infantry Division advancing around he north side of Thionville. After an initial retreat, German resistance was strong. A second, cautious assault was launched on the 11th, and when the ouvrage had been surrounded the main force bypassed the position, leaving a <b>holding</b> <b>force</b> to clear the German defenses, where resistance ended on the 12th.|$|E

40|$|The phd project {{started with}} a {{literature}} review and identification of research gaps {{in the areas of}} interest identified by Jøtul, the lead foundry in the Autocast foundry consortium and discussion with advisor. The thesis covers the results of two focus areas. The described results were also presented during the quarterly meetings organized by the consortium during the phd project timeframe (Jan 2010 - Jan 2013) Focus Area I Laboratory experiments were conducted to estimate <b>holding</b> <b>forces</b> generated from the probable range of electromagnet voltages during industrial use. A milling machine setup at the laboratory at NTNU Valgrinda was used for experiments. The distance of the electromagnet from the cast iron plate was controlled by the vertical motion of the milling machine. The vertical <b>holding</b> <b>forces</b> were measured with a National Instruments data acquisition system. The <b>holding</b> <b>forces</b> were simulated using a commercial software and qualitative explanation of the deviations of the model compared to experiments is also provided. The same experimental set-up were used to estimate friction values one could expect for the material pair in action. Since the cast iron parts are much harder than the gripper material, rapid wear of the electromagnet was observed. Focus Area II This focus area describes a methodology for internal traceability and proposes a control plan documentation approach. The industrial need for developing traceability systems originates from regulations, standards and customer specific requirements. The Phd requirements from the ad published by Autocast 2009 : The leading Norwegian manufactures of castings for the international market need new technology to meet the international competition and the environment-, health- and safety requirements. This implies a considerable emphasis on the development of new technology to enhance the use of automation and robotics in the foundries. The work will include development of both theoretical methods and physical laboratory demonstrations of the technological solutions. The candidate is expected to have a close connection with AutoCast’s industrial partners during the entire extension of the PhD project, in particular with the project owner Jøtul, and use these as living labs.
