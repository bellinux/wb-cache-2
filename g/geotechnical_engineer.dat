Voight has {{also served as}} a consultant <b>geotechnical</b> <b>engineer</b> for dams, tunnels, and nuclear power plants, helping plan engineering projects in France, India, Ireland, Somalia, Papua New Guinea, Canada, and Turkey, {{as well as in the}} United States. Voight's research interests in lava dome collapses, stratovolcanoes, monitoring of active volcanoes, and pyroclastic flows have brought him to Iceland, Indonesia, the West Indies, Italy, and Chile. Combining his knowledge of engineering and geological concepts, Voight developed the widely used anelastic strain recovery (ASR) method for measuring stress on deep rock. With a team of geologists, he also derived the material failure forecast method (FFM), which predicts eruption times for volcanoes based on changes in the mountain's surrounding seismic and deformation data. He currently serves as a member of the United States Geological Survey's Volcano Hazards Response Team, and has responded to potentially eruptive volcanoes in Japan, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Chile.|$|E

2500|$|There {{are many}} reasons that a <b>geotechnical</b> <b>engineer</b> would {{recommend}} a deep foundation over a shallow foundation, such as for a skyscraper. Some of the common reasons are very large design loads, a poor soil at shallow depth, or site constraints like property lines. There are different terms used to describe different types of deep foundations including the pile (which is analogous to a [...] ), the pier (which is analogous to a column), drilled shafts, and caissons. Piles are generally driven into the ground in situ; other deep foundations are typically put in place using excavation and drilling. The naming conventions may vary between engineering disciplines and firms. Deep foundations can be made out of timber, steel, reinforced concrete or prestressed concrete.|$|E
2500|$|Soil borings in {{the area}} of the 17th Street Canal breach showed a layer of peat {{starting}} at about [...] below the surface, and ranging from about [...] to [...] thick. Engineers misjudged the strength of the peat which is from the remains of the swamp on which some areas of New Orleans (near Lake Ponchartrain) in the 20th century were built. The shear strength of this peat was found to be very low and it had a high water content. According to Robert Bea, a <b>geotechnical</b> <b>engineer</b> from the University of California, Berkeley, the weak soil made the floodwall very vulnerable to the stresses of a large flood. [...] "At 17th Street, the soil moved laterally, pushing entire wall sections with it.... As Katrina's storm surge filled the canal, water pressure rose in the soil underneath the wall and in the peat layer. Water moved through the soil underneath the base of the wall. When the rising pressure and moving water overcame the soil's strength, it suddenly shifted, taking surrounding material– and the wall– with it." ...|$|E
50|$|CoMET {{services}} {{applied to}} evaluate the actual composition of a site’s subsurface {{are part of a}} complete geotechnical engineering service. For purposes of short-term economy, however, some owners select a firm not associated with the <b>geotechnical</b> <b>engineer</b> of record to provide these and all other CoMET services. This approach precludes the <b>geotechnical</b> <b>engineer</b> of record from providing a complete service. It also aggravates risk, because the individuals engaged to evaluate actual subsurface conditions are not “briefed” by the <b>geotechnical</b> <b>engineer</b> of record before they go to the project site and seldom communicate with the <b>geotechnical</b> <b>engineer</b> of record when they discern differences, in large part because the firm associated with the <b>geotechnical</b> <b>engineer</b> of record is regarded as a competitor of the firm employing the field representatives. In some cases, the field representatives in question lack the specific project background information and/or the education and training required to discern those differences.|$|E

50|$|Although {{geotechnical}} {{engineering is}} {{applied for a}} variety of purposes, it is essential to foundation design. As such, geotechnical engineering is applicable to every existing or new structure on the planet; every building and every highway, bridge, tunnel, harbor, airport, water line, reservoir, or other public work. Commonly, the geotechnical-engineering service comprises a study of subsurface conditions using various sampling, in-situ testing, and/or other site-characterization techniques. The instrument of professional service in those cases typically is a report through which <b>geotechnical</b> <b>engineers</b> relate the information they have been retained to provide, typically: their findings; their opinions about subsurface materials and conditions; their judgment about how the subsurface materials and conditions assumed to exist probably will behave when subjected to loads or used as building material; and their preliminary recommendations for materials usage or appropriate foundation systems, the latter based on their knowledge of a structure’s size, shape, weight, etc., and the subsurface/structure interactions likely to occur. Civil engineers, structural engineers, and architects, feasibly among other members of the project team, apply the geotechnical findings and preliminary recommendations to take the structure’s design forward. They realize these preliminary recommendations are subject to change, however, because - as a matter of practical necessity related to the observational method inherent to geotechnical engineering - <b>geotechnical</b> <b>engineers</b> base their recommendations on the composition of samples taken from a tiny portion of a site whose actual subsurface conditions are unknowable before excavation, because they are hidden by earth and/or rock and/or water. For this reason, as a key component of a complete geotechnical engineering service, <b>geotechnical</b> <b>engineers</b> employ construction-materials engineering and testing (CoMET) to observe subsurface materials as they are exposed through excavation. To help achieve economies on their clients’ behalf, <b>geotechnical</b> <b>engineers</b> assign their field representatives - specially educated and trained paraprofessionals - to observe the excavated materials and the excavations themselves in light of conditions the <b>geotechnical</b> <b>engineers</b> opined to exist. When differences are discovered, the <b>geotechnical</b> <b>engineers</b> evaluate the new findings and, when necessary, modify their design and construction recommendations. Because such changes could require other members of the design and construction team to modify their designs, specifications, and proposed methods, many owners have their <b>geotechnical</b> <b>engineers</b> serve as active members of the project team from project inception to conclusion, working with others to help ensure appropriate application of geotechnical information and judgments.|$|R

One view of geotechnical engineering is that Information Technology (IT) tools may replace many of the functions that <b>geotechnical</b> <b>engineers</b> now perform. This view can be framed to argue that the right IT tools will even replace the need for engineering judgment. Since <b>geotechnical</b> <b>engineers</b> rely heavily on their engineering judgment to formulate and defend their arguments, this view would mean a major change in the way we do geotechnical engineering. This paper looks at geotechnical engineering in today’s IT dominated world and considers ways that geotechnical engineering may change as the IT tools become increasingly powerful and pervasive. The paper’s aim is to stimulate people’s thinking about how we can make more effective use of IT tools in our future work. For experienced engineers, the result is insight to the important role of engineering judgment in an IT dominant world. For young engineers, the paper provides perspective on the role of IT tools in engineering practice and how they may develop their judgment skills. For non-engineers, such as owners, regulators and attorneys, the paper can help them better understand how <b>geotechnical</b> <b>engineers</b> think, or should think...|$|R
