5|$|Plutonium is {{an element}} in which the 5f {{electrons}} are the transition border between delocalized and localized; it is therefore {{considered one of the}} most complex elements. The anomalous behavior of plutonium is caused by its electronic structure. The energy difference between the 6d and 5f subshells is very low. The size of the 5f shell is just enough to allow the electrons to form bonds within the lattice, on the very boundary between localized and bonding behavior. The proximity of <b>energy</b> <b>levels</b> leads to multiple low-energy electron configurations with near equal <b>energy</b> <b>levels.</b> This leads to competing 5fn7s2 and 5fn−16d17s2 configurations, which causes the complexity of its chemical behavior. The highly directional nature of 5f orbitals is responsible for directional covalent bonds in molecules and complexes of plutonium.|$|E

5|$|A more {{indirect}} {{effect would be}} that the contracted s and p1/2 orbitals shield (take on themselves) the charge of the nucleus more effectively, leaving even less for the outer d and f electrons, which therefore move on larger orbitals.

Hence, the main oxidation state of unbiunium in its compounds should be +3, although the closeness of the valence subshells' <b>energy</b> <b>levels</b> may permit higher oxidation states, just like in elements 119 and 120.

5|$|Close {{examination}} of the spectral lines reveals that some display a fine structure splitting. This occurs because of spin–orbit coupling, which is an interaction between the spin and motion of the outermost electron. When an atom is in an external magnetic field, spectral lines become split into three or more components; a phenomenon called the Zeeman effect. This {{is caused by the}} interaction of the magnetic field with the magnetic moment of the atom and its electrons. Some atoms can have multiple electron configurations with the same energy level, which thus appear as a single spectral line. The interaction of the magnetic field with the atom shifts these electron configurations to slightly different <b>energy</b> <b>levels,</b> resulting in multiple spectral lines. The presence of an external electric field can cause a comparable splitting and shifting of spectral lines by modifying the electron <b>energy</b> <b>levels,</b> a phenomenon called the Stark effect.|$|E

30|$|Consider the {{scenario}} in Figure 3 again. Suppose node B has to forward a packet. Node B has nodes D and E in its forwarder set, but the <b>energy</b> <b>level</b> of node E {{is lower than}} node B. If the <b>energy</b> <b>level</b> of the forwarder is lower by a certain threshold than the sender, the sender excludes the node from the forwarder set temporarily. If all nodes are excluded from the forwarder set, then the nodes with maximum <b>energy</b> <b>level</b> {{are included in the}} forwarder set. Node E is excluded from B’s forwarder set, so B forwards its packet to only node D. Once node D’s <b>energy</b> <b>level</b> is brought down to 50 %, then B’s forwarder set includes nodes D and E again, since both nodes are at the same <b>energy</b> <b>level</b> and that is the maximum <b>energy</b> <b>level</b> among nodes in B’s forwarder set.

5|$|Photons {{can also}} be absorbed by nuclei, atoms or molecules, {{provoking}} transitions between their <b>energy</b> <b>levels.</b> A classic example is the molecular transition of retinal (C20H28O), {{which is responsible for}} vision, as discovered in 1958 by Nobel laureate biochemist George Wald and co-workers. The absorption provokes a cis-trans isomerization that, in combination with other such transitions, is transduced into nerve impulses. The absorption of photons can even break chemical bonds, as in the photodissociation of chlorine; this is the subject of photochemistry.|$|E
5|$|The {{frequency}} of a photon {{is proportional to}} its energy. As a bound electron transitions between different <b>energy</b> <b>levels</b> of an atom, it absorbs or emits photons at characteristic frequencies. For instance, when atoms are irradiated by a source with a broad spectrum, distinct absorption lines appear in the spectrum of transmitted radiation. Each element or molecule displays a characteristic set of spectral lines, such as the hydrogen spectral series. Spectroscopic measurements of the strength and width of these lines allow the composition and physical properties of a substance to be determined.|$|E
5|$|The {{main reason}} for the {{predicted}} differences between unbinilium and the other alkaline earth metals is the spin–orbit (SO) interaction—the mutual interaction between the electrons' motion and spin. The SO interaction is especially strong for the superheavy elements because their electrons move faster—at velocities comparable to the speed of light—than those in lighter atoms. In unbinilium atoms, it lowers the 7p and 8s electron <b>energy</b> <b>levels,</b> stabilizing the corresponding electrons, {{but two of the}} 7p electron <b>energy</b> <b>levels</b> are more stabilized than the other four. The effect is called subshell splitting, as it splits the 7p subshell into more-stabilized and the less-stabilized parts. Computational chemists understand the split as a change of the second (azimuthal) quantum number l from 1 to 1/2 and 3/2 for the more-stabilized and less-stabilized parts of the 7p subshell, respectively. Thus, the outer 8s electrons of unbinilium are stabilized and become harder to remove than expected, while the 7p3/2 electrons are correspondingly destabilized, perhaps allowing them to participate in chemical reactions. This stabilization of the outermost s-orbital (already significant in radium) is the key factor affecting unbinilium's chemistry, and causes all the trends for atomic and molecular properties of alkaline earth metals to reverse direction after barium.|$|E

5|$|A thorium atom has 90 electrons, {{of which}} four are valence electrons. Three atomic orbitals are {{theoretically}} {{available for the}} valence electrons to occupy: 5f, 6d, and 7s. Despite thorium's position in the f-block of the periodic table, it has an anomalous 6d27s2 electron configuration in the ground state, as the 5f and 6d subshells in the early actinides are very close in energy, {{even more so than}} the 4f and 5d subshells of the lanthanides: thorium's 6d subshells are lower in energy than its 5f subshells, because its 5f subshells are not well-shielded by the filled 6s and 6p subshells and are destabilised. Such unusual behaviour is due to relativistic effects, which become stronger {{near the bottom of the}} periodic table, specifically the relativistic spin–orbit interaction. The closeness in <b>energy</b> <b>levels</b> of the 5f, 6d, and 7s <b>energy</b> <b>levels</b> of thorium result in thorium almost always losing all four valence electrons and occurring in its highest possible oxidation state of +4. This is different from its lanthanide congener cerium, for which +4 is the highest possible state but +3 also plays an important role and is more stable. Thorium is much more similar to the transition metals zirconium and hafnium than to cerium in its properties such as ionisation energies and redox potentials, and hence also in its chemistry: this transition-metal-like behaviour is the norm in the first half of the actinide series.|$|E

The desired energies were well beyond {{the state of the art}} in laser design, so LLNL began a laser development program in the mid-1960s to reach these levels. Each increase in energy led to new and unexpected optical phenomena that had to be overcome, but these were largely solved by the mid-1970s.
