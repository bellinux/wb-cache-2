25|$|Although {{the valley}} is located at 33°S, {{much closer to the}} Equator than any European vineyard, {{viticulture}} here is possible because of the cooling influence of the Pacific ocean, in the shape of cool morning fog and greater cloud cover than is found elsewhere in the north of Chile. Free-draining clay and sandy soils, whilst good for viticulture, encourage nematodes, so <b>grafting</b> <b>onto</b> nematode-resistant rootstocks is common.|$|E
500|$|Apple {{trees are}} large if grown from seed. [...] Generally apple cultivars are {{propagated}} by <b>grafting</b> <b>onto</b> rootstocks, which control {{the size of}} the resulting tree. There are more than 7,500 known cultivars of apples, resulting in a range of desired characteristics. Different cultivars are bred for various tastes and uses, including cooking, eating raw and cider production. Trees and fruit are prone to a number of fungal, bacterial and pest problems, which can be controlled by a number of organic and non-organic means. In 2010, the fruit's genome was sequenced as part of research on disease control and selective breeding in apple production.|$|E
2500|$|The Society for Growing Australian Plants (now Australian Native Plants Society (Australia)) Eremophila Study Group {{has focused}} {{attention}} on propagating eremophila species {{with varying degrees of}} success. This eremophile has been seen as a highly desirable garden plant because of its density of flowers. [...] "It resembles a bridal veil blowing in the wind when in flower". Propagation from cuttings is very difficult for this species and <b>Grafting</b> <b>onto</b> Myoporum rootstock is preferred for this species in domestic gardens to avoid the problems of suckering. Its frost tolerance, and hardiness in drought, makes it a species that is noted for inclusion in difficult gardens, however it can cause skin irritation in some people.|$|E

40|$|A {{greenhouse}} {{experiment was}} carried out to determine growth, and mineral composition of watermelon plants, either ungrafted or <b>grafted</b> <b>onto</b> two commercial bottle gourd rootstocks and two commercial Cucurbita hybrid rootstocks, grown in a closed-loop system with nutrient solutions having two levels of pH (6. 0 or 8. 1). The high pH nutrient solution had the same basic composition plus an additional of 10 mM NaHCO 3 and 0. 5 g L- 1 CaCO 3. Significant depression of shoot, root biomass production, and leaf macro- and micro elements (N, P, K, and Fe) under high pH level was observed in both grafted and ungrafted plants. At high pH level, the percentage of shoot biomass weight reduction was significantly lower in plants <b>grafted</b> <b>onto</b> pumpkins rootstocks in comparison to those <b>grafted</b> <b>onto</b> the bottle gourd rootstocks and the ungrafted plants. The Fe concentration in leaves was significantly higher in plants <b>grafted</b> <b>onto</b> pumpkin rootstocks (avg. 0. 109 mg g- 1) in comparison to that of bottle gourd rootstocks and ungrafted plants (avg. 0. 087 mg g- 1). For plants <b>grafted</b> <b>onto</b> bottle gourd rootstocks and ungrafted plants the high pH level (8. 1) in the nutrient solution caused significant decrease in macronutrient leaf concentration especially for P compared to plants <b>grafted</b> <b>onto</b> pumpkin rootstocks. The improved crop performance of grafted plants in particular pumpkin rootstocks was attributed to the better uptake and translocation of mineral elements in particular iron and phosphorus to the shoot...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Hydrophilic Polyvinylidene {{fluoride}} (PVDF) {{hollow fiber}} ultrafiltration membranes were prepared by wet-spinning method. The effects of technical parameters of acrylic acid <b>grafted</b> <b>onto</b> PVDF {{on the performance}} of hydrophilic PVDF membranes were investigated via orthogonal test, the technical parameters of preparation of hydrophilic PVDF membranes were determined, and hydrophilic PVDF membranes were prepared. Then hydrophilic PVDF membranes were characterized in terms of breaking strength, breaking elongation, rupture pressure, pure water flux and rejection. The fouling properties and the conditions of acrylic acid <b>grafted</b> <b>onto</b> PVDF were also examined. The results showed that acrylic acid had been <b>grafted</b> <b>onto</b> PVDF, the breaking strength and rupture pressure improved greatly, and the fouling properties were better than PS hollow fiber UF membrane...|$|R
