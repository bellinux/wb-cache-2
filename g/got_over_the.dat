25|$|A similar thing {{happened}} to start the second half and give Tech its score. Penn State's Gray got off a bad punt into the wind, nearly over his own goal line. Using its shift to perfection, Wycoff eventually <b>got</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> tying touchdown. After a fumble recovery, an 80-yard drive utilizing Wycoff and Sam Murray ended in a Carter Barron touchdown for the third score. After an interception, Ike Williams also added a 25-yard field goal.|$|E

Another loyalist feud erupted, and ended with several men dead and scores evicted from their homes. The Rathcoole home of long-standing UDA member Sammy Duddy was raked by gunfire; although Duddy was not injured in the shooting attack, his pet chihuahua Bambi was fatally wounded by shots fired through the front door by masked gunmen from Adair's C Company. Adair later admitted in an interview he gave for journalist Suzanne Breen that Duddy never <b>got</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> loss of Bambi.|$|E
25|$|The Bolsheviks {{started a}} new workers-oriented {{newspaper}} in Saint Petersburg on 22 April 1912, and also called it Pravda. Trotsky was so upset {{by what he saw}} as a usurpation of his newspaper's name that in April 1913 he wrote a letter to Nikolay Chkheidze, a Menshevik leader, bitterly denouncing Lenin and the Bolsheviks. Though he quickly <b>got</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> disagreement, the letter was intercepted by the Russian police, and a copy was put into their archives. Shortly after Lenin's death in 1924, the letter was found and publicized by Trotsky's opponents within the Communist Party to portray him as Lenin's enemy.|$|E

25|$|King was on {{the brink}} of being knocked out {{in the first round of}} the 2017 World Championship as he was 2–0 down in sets to Steve West. In the third set, West was on 36 for the match, but King took out a 136 finish, won the set and {{levelled}} the match at 2–2. In the deciding set West missed two match darts and King would win 3–2 and was in tears on stage afterwards. In the second round Michael Smith missed five darts to beat King 4–1. King then hit a match saving 130 checkout to help him close to 3–3 and Smith missed three more match darts in the deciding set, but eventually <b>got</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> line to edge King out 4–3.

25|$|This mound, called Knockinglaw on the 1896 OS, {{still exists}} in very poor condition, near Little Onthank. It was a tumulus in which urns had been found. It had a powder {{magazine}} built into it at one stage and was eventually effectively removed altogether. It {{is involved in}} one of the versions of the stories of the killing of Lord Soulis. He {{is said to have been}} killed here in 1444 after leading a band of English mercenaries into the Kilmarnock area and then subsequently suffering a rout at the hands of the Boyd's of Dean Castle. Dean Castle at one time belonged to the De Soulis family. A memorial stone, dating from at least 1609, to Lord Soulis is to be found set into a wall at the High Church, by the railway viaduct. A brass plaque with details of the De Soulis coat of arms used to be set into the road near this spot. The Soulis Cross was in Soulis Street, but is now housed in the Dick Institute. A notorious Lord Soulis is linked with the evil redcaps at Hermitage Castle in the Borders. He could only be bound by a three-stranded rope of sand, but they <b>got</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> problem of hanging him by binding him in a lead sheet and boiling himn to death for the murder of the Laird of Branxholm. Robertson points out that the coat of arms of the De Soulis & De Morville families is identical and they may therefore have been related. The De Soulis family lost their lands due to their involvement in 'The Soulis Plot' to depose Robert the Bruce. The family were unsuccessful claimants to the throne of Scotland.|$|E
500|$|The {{relationship}} between Gilbert and Sullivan suffered its most serious breach in April 1890, during {{the run of}} The Gondoliers, when Gilbert objected to Carte's financial accounts for the production, including a charge to the partnership {{for the cost of}} new carpeting for the Savoy Theatre lobby. [...] Gilbert believed that this was a maintenance expense that should be charged to Carte alone. Carte was building a new theatre to present Sullivan's forthcoming grand opera, and Sullivan sided with Carte, {{going so far as to}} testify erroneously as to certain old debts. Gilbert took legal action against Carte and Sullivan and vowed to write no more for the Savoy, and so the partnership came to an acrimonious end. Sullivan wrote to Gilbert in September 1890 that he was [...] "physically and mentally ill over this wretched business. I have not yet <b>got</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> shock of seeing our names coupled ... in hostile antagonism over a few miserable pounds".|$|E

With two races of the season remaining and an eight-point deficit after losing {{the lead in the}} Drivers' Championship, Häkkinen remained confident about his title chances: [...] "I know that what happened to me in the last Grand Prix, when I had to retire, can happen to anyone, It could happen to Michael. So I am very optimistic. I have come here prepared and thinking about these two races together. Not one, two." [...] Michael Schumacher emphasised the pressure of leading the championship going into Japan: [...] "It hasn't been a relaxing time at all and I still haven't completely <b>got</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> jetlag from the States. But I'm prepared to sacrifice this and a lot more to bring the title back to Maranello. And {{the same can be said}} of the entire team."

500|$|Kira Cochrane, in The Guardian, {{said that}} [...] "every {{misogynist}} epithet available" [...] {{has been used}} against Mills. [...] "She has somehow become the vessel through which it is acceptable for both pundits and the public to express their very worst feelings about women". Joan Smith, writing in The Independent, said that newspaper [...] "bullies love a weakling"; quoting the Daily Mirrors front page headline: [...] "Lady Liar" [...] and The Sun newspaper writing [...] "Pornocchio" [...] over Mills's face (in reference to Pinocchio's nose getting longer when he lied and her past photographs). Smith {{went on to say}} that Mills had [...] "dreamt of becoming the wife of a famous man but did not realise that he had fantasies of his own, marrying an attractive younger woman when he hadn't <b>got</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> loss of his first wife. Mills behaved foolishly when the marriage failed but she does not deserve the treatment she has had in the mass-market press. It is merciless bullying of an unstable, vulnerable woman". In 2009, Mills reported a bogus charity had been set up to extract information about her marriage. News Corp, owned by Rupert Murdoch, is alleged to have set up the sting. The British tabloid newspaper the Daily Mirror ran the headline [...] "Macca marriage to Heather was mistake of the decade" [...] following an interview McCartney gave to Q magazine. McCartney immediately moved to deny this statement and then went on to publicly print the original transcript on his official website to prove the Daily Mirror article was false.|$|E
500|$|On 9 August 1942, Ledbury sailed from Gibraltar, sighted {{the convoy}} in the afternoon, and took its convoy {{screening}} station. An hour before midnight on 10 August {{she left the}} convoy and proceeded to refuel from the tanker Dingledale, an operation that took place {{early in the morning}} of 11 August. Ledbury took aboard 101 tons of fuel. Just before ten o'clock in the morning, the destroyer took station as starboard wing ship of screen. In the afternoon, [...] was hit by torpedoes, with Derwent ordering Ledbury to stand by the stricken aircraft carrier. As Eagle sank, one destroyer and the tug Jaunty stopped, picking up survivors in the oil patches in the water. As Ledbury reached survivors, she was ordered to rejoin the convoy. The convoy now suffered a series of aerial attacks with the gunner of Ledburys port Oerlikon thought to have shot down one plane, although many other ships were firing at this machine. At 21:00, Ledbury was ordered to Anti-Aircraft station, with one cable on the starboard beam of No. 43. Early on the morning of 12 August, the destroyer was ordered by [...] to investigate a periscope reported on the starboard quarter of No.43. Nelson reported a submarine periscope bearing north of her, and Ledbury deployed single scare charges to cover [...] from this submarine, and destroyers astern of her appeared to follow up this contact. At nine o'clock in the morning, an air attack by Junkers 88s developed on the convoy, with one Junkers 88 crashing at bearing 058 degrees. Four small bombs were seen to go by the bridge, landing on the starboard side, and a large bomb came near the port quarter. In the ensuing mayhem, Ledbury was ordered to fill in gaps in the screen caused by ships falling back on contact. On the way to this position three airmen were seen coming down by parachute. One was picked up and found to be German, the others were abandoned. The captured airman stated that the last raid consisted of Luftwaffe airmen flying Junkers 88s from Sicily; and that he had been shot down by close range weapons from the convoy. Ledburys crew noted that the most interesting thing about the pilot was that the nails of his boots were made of wood. Yet another aerial attack ensued, this time by dive-bombers. Two groups approached from ahead, but neither <b>got</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> convoy. Two of these planes were shot down by gunfire. After this attack, the destroyer resumed station on the starboard side of the convoy. An attack by Junkers 88s soon started whilst escort fighters were still refuelling. Ledbury suffered another near miss off her port quarter. One ship in the convoy was damaged, and [...] stood by her.|$|E
