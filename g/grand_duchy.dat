5|$|After Mindaugas' death, the <b>Grand</b> <b>Duchy</b> of Lithuania entered {{times of}} {{relative}} instability, as {{reflected by the}} fact that seven Grand Dukes held the title {{over the course of the}} next 32 years. Little is known about this period, but the Gediminid dynasty was founded in about 1280. Despite the instability, the <b>Grand</b> <b>Duchy</b> did not disintegrate. Vytenis assumed power in 1295, and during the next 20 years laid solid foundations for the Duchy to expand and grow under the leadership of Gediminas and his son Algirdas. While the <b>Grand</b> <b>Duchy</b> was established between 1219 and 1295, the years after 1295 marked its expansion.|$|E
5|$|The {{remainder}} of the regiments carried a red banner displaying the Columns of Gediminas. Those that bore the Vytis, {{also known as the}} Pahonia, were armies from the <b>Grand</b> <b>Duchy</b> of Lithuania, while those who bore the Columns of Gediminas were from noble families of Lithuania. Until the end of the 18th century, when it was annexed by the Russian Empire, the <b>Grand</b> <b>Duchy</b> of Lithuania used the Vytis as its flag.|$|E
5|$|To further {{enhance the}} Commonwealth's {{integration}} and security, the constitution abolished the erstwhile union of Poland and Lithuania {{in favor of}} a unitary state. Its full establishment, supported by Stanisław August and Kołlątaj, was opposed by many Lithuanian deputies. As a compromise, the <b>Grand</b> <b>Duchy</b> of Lithuania received numerous privileges guaranteeing its continued existence. Related acts included the Deklaracja Stanów Zgromadzonych (Declaration of the Assembled Estates) of May 5, 1791, confirming the Government Act adopted two days earlier, and the Zaręczenie Wzajemne Obojga Narodów (Reciprocal Guarantee of Two Nations, i.e., of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland and the <b>Grand</b> <b>Duchy</b> of Lithuania) of October 22, 1791, affirming the unity and indivisibility of Poland and the <b>Grand</b> <b>Duchy</b> within a single state and their equal representation in state-governing bodies. The Reciprocal Guarantee strengthened the Polish–Lithuanian union while keeping many federal aspects of the state intact.|$|E
50|$|By the Hamburg Agreement on March 8, 1701, Mecklenburg was {{separated}} into two duchies with limited autonomy, which formed a collective state-as of 1815, the <b>Grand</b> <b>Duchies</b> of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and Mecklenburg-Strelitz. Since 1755, {{they had the}} same constitution and were {{under the control of the}} same parliament. In 1815, both parts became <b>Grand</b> <b>Duchies</b> by the Congress of Vienna.|$|R

5|$|Because none of Gediminas' {{siblings}} {{had strong}} heirs, Gediminas {{and his children}} were in a favorable position to assume and consolidate power in the <b>Grand</b> <b>Duchy.</b> Gediminas had at least five daughters and seven sons, whose shrewd marriages helped to consolidate and expand the Grand Duchy's influence to areas east and west of Lithuania. Those marriages speak to Gediminas' diplomatic talent in building alliances with the neighboring states that shared his goals to destroy the Teutonic Order and contain the growing power of Moscow and Poland. The marriages of Gediminas' sons helped to consolidate the dynasty's power over various territories already within the <b>Grand</b> <b>Duchy,</b> while his daughters' and granddaughters' marriages worked to strengthen Lithuanian relationships with neighboring powers.|$|E
5|$|From 1809 to 1898, {{a period}} called Pax Russica, the {{peripheral}} {{power of the}} Finns gradually increased, and the Russian-Finnish relations were exceptionally peaceful compared with {{other parts of the}} Russian Empire. Russia's defeat in the Crimean War in the 1850s led to attempts to speed up the modernization of the country. This caused more than 50 years of economic, industrial, cultural and educational progress in the <b>Grand</b> <b>Duchy</b> of Finland, including improvement in the status of the Finnish language. All this encouraged Finnish nationalism and cultural unity through the birth of the Fennoman movement, which bound the Finns to the domestic governmental system and led to the idea that the Finnish <b>Grand</b> <b>Duchy</b> was an increasingly autonomous state of the Russian Empire.|$|E

50|$|The 17th Division {{was one of}} {{the more}} mixed units of the German Army. It was formed by merging the contingents of the Hanseatic Cities with those of the Mecklenburg <b>grand</b> <b>duchies.</b> The division's 33rd Infantry Brigade was {{composed}} of the contingents of Hamburg and Bremen (and until the formation of the 162nd Infantry Regiment in 1897, that of Lübeck). The division's 34th (Grand Ducal Mecklenburg) Infantry Brigade was composed of the infantry contingents of the <b>grand</b> <b>duchies</b> of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and Mecklenburg-Strelitz. The 81st Infantry Brigade, formed in 1897, included the newly raised Lübeck regiment and a Prussian regiment from Schleswig-Holstein. The divisional cavalry brigade was the 17th (Grand Ducal Mecklenburg) Cavalry Brigade, with two dragoon regiments from Mecklenburg-Schwerin and, at various periods in its history, attached Prussian cavalry. The 17th Artillery Brigade included a regiment from Holstein and a regiment from the two Mecklenburg <b>grand</b> <b>duchies.</b>|$|R
5|$|In 2014, the Russian Military Historical Society {{stated that}} Russian troops {{and their allies}} {{defeated}} the German knights in the Battle of Grunwald, though evidence that the <b>Grand</b> <b>Duchy</b> of Moscow was involved with this battle is lacking.|$|E
5|$|In the 16th {{century the}} <b>Grand</b> <b>Duchy</b> of Moscow {{continued}} activities aimed at unifying the old Rus' lands still under Lithuanian rule. The <b>Grand</b> <b>Duchy</b> of Lithuania had insufficient resources to counter Moscow's advances, already having {{to control the}} Rus' population within its borders {{and not being able}} to count on loyalty of Rus' feudal lords. As a result of the protracted war at the turn of the 15th and 16th centuries, Moscow acquired large tracts of territory east of the Dnieper River. Polish assistance and involvement were increasingly becoming a necessary component of the balance of power in the eastern reaches of the Lithuanian domain.|$|E
5|$|Many early Russian principalities were {{virtually}} razed or severely {{affected by a}} major Mongol invasion in the 13th century, but the lands of Belarus avoided {{the brunt of the}} invasion and were eventually absorbed by the <b>Grand</b> <b>Duchy</b> of Lithuania.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the early}} nineteenth century, Napoléon I {{occasionally}} used the title [...] "grand duchy" [...] for several French satellite states given to his relatives or generals. Other allies abandoned the orbit of the Holy Roman Empire to join Napoleon's nominally independent Confederation of the Rhine. The elevation of these vassals to the title of grand duke was usually accompanied by an expansion of their realms with additional territory gathered {{at the expense of}} subdued powers such as Prussia. Though Napoleon was defeated at the Battle of Waterloo and most of his newly created satellite states abolished, the Congress of Vienna restored some of the previous sovereign duchies and principalities, while recognizing others as <b>grand</b> <b>duchies.</b> As a result, the 19th century saw {{the creation of a new}} group of <b>grand</b> <b>duchies</b> in central Europe, such as the <b>grand</b> <b>duchies</b> of Hesse, Baden and Oldenburg.|$|R

5|$|The palace {{was bought}} by the Medici family in 1549 and became the chief {{residence}} of the ruling families of the <b>Grand</b> <b>Duchy</b> of Tuscany. It grew as a great treasure house as later generations amassed paintings, plates, jewelry and luxurious possessions.|$|E
50|$|In 1492, {{the border}} of Lithuania's loosely {{controlled}} eastern Ruthenian territory ran less than one hundred miles from Moscow. But {{as a result of}} the warfare, a third of the <b>grand</b> <b>duchy's</b> land area was ceded to the Russian state in 1503. Then the loss of Smolensk in July 1514 was particularly disastrous, even though it was followed by the successful Battle of Orsha in September, as the Polish interests were reluctantly recognizing the necessity of their own involvement in Lithuania's defense. The peace of 1537 left Gomel as the <b>grand</b> <b>duchy's</b> eastern edge.|$|R

5|$|The {{province}} of Greater Poland {{was acquired by}} Kingdom of Prussia following the Congress of Vienna, when it was detached from the Duchy of Warsaw and given to Prussia, where it became reorganized as the <b>Grand</b> <b>Duchy</b> of Posen. The King of Prussia gave the <b>Grand</b> <b>Duchy</b> the right to call a parliament in 1823, with specific decrees defining its competences in 1826. The parliament carried {{the traditions of the}} General Sejmik of Greater Poland, and insisted on using the Polish word sejm in its name. The Sejm {{met for the first time}} on 24 December 1827. The second sejm session begun on 30 January 1830.|$|E
5|$|The {{work of the}} Great Sejm did not {{end with}} the passing of the Constitution. The Sejm {{continued}} to debate and pass legislation building on and clarifying that document. Among the most notable acts passed after the 3 May was the Deklaracja Stanów Zgromadzonych (Declaration of the Assembled Estates) of May 5, 1791, confirming the Government Act adopted two days earlier, and the Zaręczenie Wzajemne Obojga Narodów (Reciprocal Guarantee of Two Nations, i.e., of the Crown of Poland and the <b>Grand</b> <b>Duchy</b> of Lithuania) of October 22, 1791, affirming the unity and indivisibility of Poland and the <b>Grand</b> <b>Duchy</b> within a single state, and their equal representation in state-governing bodies.

5|$|During the ages, {{the lands}} {{surrounding}} {{the town of}} Suwałki had been variously part of Lithuanian, Polish, and German borderlands. Since 1569, during {{the era of the}} Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, the territory belonged to the Podlaskie Voivodeship and was part of the Kingdom of Poland rather than the <b>Grand</b> <b>Duchy</b> of Lithuania. However, Sejny was a property of Dominican friars from Vilnius.|$|E
50|$|Luxembourg's monarch {{retains the}} right to confer the baronial title. Two of the <b>grand</b> <b>duchy's</b> prime ministers {{inherited}} baronial titles that were used during their tenures in office, Victor de Tornaco and Félix de Blochausen.|$|R
50|$|The Thaler was the {{currency}} of the two <b>Duchies,</b> later <b>Grand</b> <b>Duchies,</b> of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and Mecklenburg-Strelitz until 1857. It was replaced the Mecklenburg Vereinsthaler at par. From 1848, it was equal to the Prussian Thaler.|$|R
5|$|In the Diet, {{the group}} of middle-sized states, known as Mittelstaaten (Bavaria, Württemberg, the <b>grand</b> <b>duchies</b> of Baden and Hesse, and the duchies of Saxony–Weimar, Saxony–Meiningen, Saxony–Coburg, and Nassau), {{supported}} complete demobilization within the Confederation. These individual governments rejected the potent combination of enticing promises and subtle (or outright) threats Bismarck {{used to try to}} gain their support against the Habsburgs. The Prussian war cabinet understood that its only supporters among the German states against the Habsburgs were two small principalities bordering on Brandenburg that had little military strength or political clout: the <b>Grand</b> <b>Duchies</b> of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and Mecklenburg-Strelitz. They also understood that Prussia's only ally abroad was Italy.|$|R
5|$|Ferdinando II died on 23 May 1670 of {{apoplexy}} and dropsy and was interred in the Basilica of San Lorenzo, the Medicean necropolis. At {{the time}} of his death, the population of the <b>grand</b> <b>duchy</b> was 720,594 souls; the streets were lined with grass and the buildings {{on the verge of collapse}} in Pisa, while Siena was virtually abandoned.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{suppression}} of the Sejm of the Congress Poland {{in the aftermath of the}} November Uprising, the Sejm of the <b>Grand</b> <b>Duchy</b> was the last vestige of the Polish parliamentary tradition on Polish soil. Only Christian men owning landed property for at least ten years were enfranchised to vote. Until 1869 Jews generally remained excluded, unlike in Prussia proper.|$|E
5|$|In eastern-central Europe, the Kingdom of Hungary was {{established}} in AD 1000 following the Christianisation of the Magyars.
