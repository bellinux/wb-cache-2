40|$|This study investigates whether U. S. property-liability {{insurers}} {{change their}} demand for reinsurance after demutualization. Our empirical {{results show that}} the overall demand for reinsurance of converting insurers is not statistically different after the conversion. Furthermore, we find that converting insurers decrease the demand for reinsurance <b>from</b> non-affiliated <b>reinsurers,</b> but increase the demand for reinsurance <b>from</b> affiliated <b>reinsurers</b> after the conversion. One possible explanation is that converting insurers may treat reinsurance to affiliated reinsurers as risk retention rather than risk transfer so that they can reduce reinsurance cost. Another interesting finding is that converting insurers increase demand for reinsurance <b>from</b> non-affiliated <b>reinsurers</b> before conversion.

40|$|We {{review the}} {{literature}} related to capital structure swaps {{and create a}} new model of capital structure swaps for insurance companies. We then test the validity of our theory by comparing long-run stock market returns for insurance companies that issue equity and increase reinsurance in the same year. Using long-run event study methodology, we test for value-enhancing capital structure swaps. Finding evidence of value creation resulting from swaps, we demonstrate that insurance company managers may be able to expropriate wealth <b>from</b> <b>reinsurers</b> and new equity investors when the reinsurance markets have mispriced loss reserves...|$|R
50|$|In {{catastrophe}} {{excess of}} loss, the cedant's retention {{is usually a}} multiple of the underlying policy limits, and the reinsurance contract usually contains a two risk warranty (i.e. {{they are designed to}} protect the cedant against catastrophic events that involve more than one policy, usually very many policies). For example, an insurance company issues homeowners' policies with limits of up to $500,000 and then buys catastrophe reinsurance of $22,000,000 in excess of $3,000,000. In that case, the insurance company would only recover <b>from</b> <b>reinsurers</b> in the event of multiple policy losses in one event (e.g., hurricane, earthquake, flood).|$|R

40|$|An electroactive {{polyaniline}} (PAn) {{was successfully}} prepared from nonaqueous propylene carbonate (PC) solution containing acid (CF 3 COOH) and electrolyte (LiC 104). PAn deposition and the doping-undoping process of deposited PAn film were investigated by consecutive cyclic voltammetry in various electropolymerization s lutions. It {{is confirmed by}} infrared spectral measurement {{that there is no}} essential difference in the manner of bonding between the electroactive PAn films <b>deposited</b> <b>from</b> aqueous and PC solutions. Inspection by scanning electron microscope revealed that PAn films <b>deposited</b> <b>from</b> aqueous HCIO 4 solution had a fibrous structure, whereas the PAn film <b>deposited</b> <b>from</b> PC solution bad a porous surface which resembled polypyrrole films. The shape of the electro-oxidation curve is found to be essentially dif-ferent, depending on the solvent or the pK ~ value of acid in an electropolymerization s lution. An electroactive PAn film <b>deposited</b> <b>from</b> PC solution was applied'to an effective cathode material of a rechargeable lithium battery (Li/LiC 104 -PC/ PAn). The Li/LiC 104 -PC/PAn (<b>deposited</b> <b>from</b> PC solution) battery showed a high coulombic efficiency and high-energy density in charging-discharging behavior. The electroactivity of PAn film <b>deposited</b> <b>from</b> PC solution was found to be as high as, or higher than, that of PAn film <b>deposited</b> <b>from</b> aqueous olution. Electrodes modified by conductive polymer films have been investigated extensively in recent years (1 - 8). Amon...|$|R

40|$|Until {{relatively}} recently life companies generally {{met their}} capital needs either from internal resources or {{by means of}} equity capital provided by shareholders. However, the financial pressures on life operations have led to more innovative alternatives being used.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the market for}} catastrophe event risk – i. e., financial claims that are linked to losses associated with natural hazards, such as hurricanes and earthquakes. This market is in transition as new approaches for transferring risk are being explored. The paper studies several recent transactions by USAA which use reinsurance capacity from capital markets, rather than only <b>from</b> <b>reinsurers.</b> We identify two puzzles concerning the cat protection purchased in these transactions: there is no coverage for the largest, most severe events; and premiums appear well above actuarial value. We demonstrate that both features deviate from what theory would predict and are characteristic of the entire marketplace, not simply the USAA transactions. We then explore {{a number of possible}} explanations for the facts. The most compelling explanations seem to be a combination of capital market imperfections and market power on the part of reinsurers. Conclusions for broader capital market and risk management issues are discussed...|$|R
