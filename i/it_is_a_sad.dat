25|$|The {{number of}} murders and assaults perpetrated upon Negroes is very great; we can form only an approximative {{estimate}} {{of what is}} going on in those parts of the South which are not closely garrisoned, and from which no regular reports are received, by what occurs under the very eyes of our military authorities. As to my personal experience, I will only mention that during my two days sojourn at Atlanta, one Negro was stabbed with fatal effect on the street, and three were poisoned, one of whom died. While I was at Montgomery, one negro was cut across the throat evidently with intent to kill, and another was shot, but both escaped with their lives. Several papers attached to this report give an account of the number of capital cases that occurred at certain places during a certain period of time. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sad</b> fact that the perpetration of those acts is not confined to that class of people which might be called the rabble.|$|E
500|$|The song {{takes the}} form of a piano-based ballad, with {{conventional}} chord changes. McCartney described the chords as [...] "slightly jazzy" [...] and in keeping with Charles' style. The song's home key is E-flat major but it also uses the relative C minor. Lyrically, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sad</b> and melancholic song, with an evocation of an as-yet unrequited, though apparently inevitable, love.|$|E
500|$|The critic Michael Billington, {{writing in}} The Guardian, gave a mixed review: [...] "Once or twice one of Stoppard's brightly {{coloured}} balls {{falls to the}} ground, partly because Michael Hordern's moral philosopher substitutes academic mannerism for apprehension of the argument. But {{this is not to}} deny that Hordern's simian habit of scratching his left earlobe with right hand or leaning over his desk as if he is doing intellectual press-ups is very funny to watch or that he is brilliant at displaying cuckolded curiosity." [...] Harold Hobson, the drama critic, thought that failing to enjoy the play was [...] "not actually a criminal offence but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sad</b> evidence of illiteracy". Jumpers won the Evening Standard 's Best Play Award which, much to Hordern's amusement, was presented by the philosopher A. J. Ayer.|$|E

50|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sad</b> {{moment for}} the Club when ‘Longun’ Wilson died in 1956. He had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> {{significant}} part of ‘the Blacks’ since 1928 and his presence as <b>a</b> trainer <b>was</b> missed.|$|R
50|$|In 1720, when Charlotte Aglaé had {{to leave}} France to meet her husband in Modena, she insisted on seeing her sister before she left. According to their grandmother, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sad</b> scene.|$|R
2500|$|... 'Tantura merits {{very little}} attention. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sad</b> and sickly hamlet of wretched huts on a naked sea-beach, with a marshy flat {{between it and}} the base of the eastern hills. The sheikh's {{residence}} and the public menzûl for travellers are the only respectable houses, Dor never could have been a large city, for there are no remains. The artificial tell, with a fragment of the Kùsr standing like a column upon it, was probably the most ancient site. In front of the present village and five small islets, by the aid of which an artificial harbour could easily be constructed. The entrance to which would be by the inlet {{at the foot of the}} Kùsr; and should [...] "Dor and her towns" [...] ever rise again into wealth and importance such a harbour will assuredly be made'.|$|E

Victim of {{repeated}} attacks by an irresponsible, bullying, cowardly, and intemperate father, and abandoned by respondents who {{placed him in}} a dangerous predicament and who knew or learned what was going on, and yet did essentially nothing except, as the Court revealingly observes, ante, at 193, [...] "dutifully recorded these incidents in [...] files." [...] <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sad</b> commentary upon American life, and constitutional principles - so full of late of patriotic fervor and proud proclamations about [...] "liberty and justice for all" [...] - that this child, Joshua DeShaney, now is assigned to live out {{the remainder of his}} life profoundly retarded. Joshua and his mother, as petitioners here, deserve - but now are denied by this Court - the opportunity to have the facts of their case considered {{in the light of the}} constitutional protection that 42 U.S.C. 1983 is meant to provide." ...|$|E
2500|$|In [...] "A Letter to Her Husband Absent upon Public Employment" [...] Bradstreet {{writes a}} letter to her husband who is away from her working at his job. Bradstreet uses various metaphors to {{describe}} her husband. The most visible use of metaphor that Bradstreet uses is comparing her husband to the seasons. When summer is gone, winter soon arrives. Summer {{can be seen as}} a time of happiness and warmth. Winter on the other hand can be seen as being gloomy and cold. Bradstreet's husband is her Sun and when he is with her it is always summer. She is happy and warm from the love that her husband brings when he is around. When her husband leaves home for work, everything then becomes winter. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sad,</b> cold time for Bradstreet and she wishes for her husband to soon return. [...] "Return, return, sweet Sol, from Capricorn." [...] She wants her husband to know that she needs him and without him everything feels gloomy. She is not concerned with what others think. It is not intended for anyone else except her husband. Bradstreet knows that the situation is inevitable, summer can't be around always and soon winter will follow. Her husband's job is important. He can't be there always and he must go away at times. [...] "Till nature's sad decree shall call thee hence." [...] One thing that keeps her going is that even though they are far away from each other, they are one with each other.|$|E

6000|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sad</b> {{truth that}} many of the poor boys had neither parent nor {{relative}} to correspond with, but these were none the less eager in their literary work, for had they not Miss Macpherson and the ladies of the Home to write to? ...|$|R
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sad</b> end {{to one of}} {{the most}} gifted and unrecognised {{engineers}} of recent times, whose ideas eventually led to providing an electronic telephone exchange system (TXE4) that, at its peak in the early 1990s, catered for more than 25% of the UK subscribers.|$|R

50|$|In {{an effort}} to {{consolidate}} its operations, Quaker Oats closed the Corsicana plant in 1985 and merged its operations with another subsidiary, Stokley-Van Camp, in Dallas. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sad</b> and unpopular move for the community.

60|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>sad</b> {{thing to}} think of, {{but there is}} no doubt that genius lasts longer than beauty. That {{accounts}} for the fact that we all take such pains to over-educate ourselves.|$|E
