5|$|As {{the summit}} closed on 28 September 1970, hours after escorting the last Arab leader to leave, Nasser {{suffered}} a heart attack.

5|$|The {{main goal}} of {{treatment}} {{is to treat}} shock and preserve kidney function. Initially this is done through the administration of generous amounts of intravenous fluids, usually isotonic saline (0.9% weight per volume sodium chloride solution). In victims of crush syndrome, it is recommended to administer intravenous fluids even before they are extracted from collapsed structures. This will ensure sufficient circulating volume {{to deal with the}} muscle cell swelling (which typically commences when blood supply is restored), and to prevent the deposition of myoglobin in the kidneys. Amounts of 6 to 12liters over 24hours are recommended. The rate of fluid administration may be altered to achieve a high urine output (200–300ml/h in adults), unless there are other reasons why this might lead to complications, such as a <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> failure.|$|E

25|$|Most {{evidence}} suggests that statins are effective in preventing heart disease in those with high cholesterol, but no <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> disease. A 2013 Cochrane review found a decrease in risk of death and other poor outcomes without any evidence of harm. For every 138 people treated for 5 years one fewer dies and for every 49 treated one fewer has an episode of heart disease. A 2011 review reached similar conclusions. And a 2012 review found benefits in both women and men. A 2010 review concluded that treating people with no history of cardiovascular disease reduces cardiovascular events in men but not women, and provides no mortality benefit in either sex. Two other meta analyses published that year, one of which used data obtained exclusively from women, found no mortality benefit in primary prevention.|$|E

40|$|Background. People with a <b>history</b> <b>of</b> stroke or <b>heart</b> {{disease are}} at {{increased}} risk of future stroke; therefore, identification of risk factors by GPs is critical. Objectives. To compare the following among general practice patients with and without a <b>history</b> <b>of</b> stroke or <b>heart</b> disease: (i) self-reported prevalence rates of lifestyle risk factors; (ii) accuracy of GP detection of patient-reported risk factors and (iii) average proportion of patient-reported risk factors detected by GPs. Methods. Consecutive patients attending a participating general practice clinic were invited to participate in a cross-sectional touchscreen survey assessing lifestyle risk factors in 2010 - 11. The GP of each consenting patient completed a corresponding survey assessing the patient's risk factors. Demographic characteristics of patients and GPs were obtained. Results. Data from 51 GPs and 564 patients were analysed. Patients without a <b>history</b> <b>of</b> stroke or <b>heart</b> disease reported significantly higher rates of smoking (12 %) and risky alcohol consumption (56 %) than patients with a <b>history</b> <b>of</b> stroke or <b>heart</b> disease (6 % and 36 %, respectively). Low sensitivity of GP detection of risk factors was found for all risk factors for all patients. Patients with a <b>history</b> <b>of</b> stroke or <b>heart</b> disease have a significantly higher mean proportion of risk factors detected by their GP compared to patients without a <b>history</b> <b>of</b> stroke or <b>heart</b> disease (P = 0. 00). Conclusion. Given low sensitivity and specificity of GP detection of risk factors among patients, alternate methods of identification are needed. Research is required to determine strategies to facilitate secondary care of patients with a <b>history</b> <b>of</b> stroke or <b>heart</b> disease by GPs...|$|R

25|$|Little {{is known}} about the eruptive <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>Heart</b> Peaks because it has not been studied in detail by scientists. The exact age of Heart Peaks is not known, but its first {{volcanic}} phase occurred during the Neogene period (between 23and 2.5million years ago). The variety of volcanic deposits at Heart Peaks indicates that it has a history of producing not only fluid and passive basaltic lava flows, but also more silica-rich trachyte and rhyolitic lavas and explosive eruptions. Phreatic breccias are found at the volcano, providing evidence that phreatic eruptions have occurred at least once throughout its eruptive history. Features created by subglacial eruptions are also present. The latest volcanic phase at Heart Peaks is largely Pleistocene (between 2.5million and 10,000years ago) in age and late-stage Holocene (10,000years ago to present) activity is uncertain. This is partly because it is unknown whether Holocene volcanic rocks exist at the volcano. Nevertheless, the last eruption at Heart Peaks is unknown.|$|E
