In this paper, {{we present}} a grating-coupled surface plasmon {{resonance}} (SPR) biosensor with a c-type fluidic channel on a <b>grating</b> <b>disc.</b> For obtaining the kinetic information of molecular interaction, we combined a c-type fluidic channel on disc to drive testing solution forward by gravity via turning the <b>grating</b> <b>disc.</b> The disc biosensor can react with probe molecules on the different sensing surfaces in the following time. The repeatability testing shows the resolution of angle of the measuring system was enhanced by threefold comparing to that without the automation improvement. In order to identify the accuracy of angle changes of SPR due to the chemical reaction on surface, experiment for monitoring a growth self-assembled monolayer (SAM) immobilized on gold surface was performed. The measured response curves show that the saturation time of the SAM formation, which thickness is smaller than 2 nm, is roughly 5 hours when 1 mM MHDA growing on gold at room temperature. The demonstration reveals that the disc biosensor with c-type fluidic channels can be a promising tool for a kinetic analysis of bimolecular interaction without any external fluid pumping systems...|$|E
40|$|The {{visual system}} relies {{on both the}} {{integration}} and interocular inhibitory processes to achieve single vision from different images in the two eyes. It is generally assumed that the integration process first searches for matching local features between the two eyes. If the matching fails, an interocular inhibitory process is triggered to suppress the image representation of one eye, leading to visual perception that is essentially contributed by the other eye. Here, using a stimulus comprising of binocularly corresponding features (vertical gratings) but incompatible surface border information, we found evidence to the contrary. In one half-image, a circular patch of vertical grating was phase-shifted relative to the surrounding vertical grating to create a circular, monocular boundary contour (MBC), while the other half-image had a similar vertical grating. The two half-images had a binocular disparity at the circular grating patch area, leading to the percept of a disc in depth. Concurrent with the stereo percept, threshold for detecting a Gabor probe on the half-image without the MBC was higher than that on the corresponding area with the <b>grating</b> <b>disc,</b> indicating binocular suppression. These findings reveal that when we perceive depth, which requires the integration process to obtain binocular disparity from the two eyes, one eye's image could simultaneously be suppressed from visual awareness by the interocular inhibitory process. Our study also presents a provocative example of where the brain selectively binds some, but not all, features of the images from the two eyes for visual perception...|$|E
40|$|We {{tested a}} {{prediction}} that females' duration estimates of briefly-viewed male, but not female, photos would be modulated by attractiveness. Twenty-seven female participants viewed sequences of five stimuli of identical duration {{in which the}} first four were sine-wave <b>gratings</b> (Gabor <b>discs)</b> and the fifth was either the same sine-wave grating (control trials) or a photo of an attractive or unattractive male or female (test trials). After each sequence, participants had to reproduce {{the duration of the}} fifth stimulus. Results confirmed our prediction and showed that duration estimates of attractive male photos were significantly longer than corresponding estimates for unattractive male photos, while {{there was no significant difference}} in estimated duration for attractive and unattractive female photos. Our data show that unexpectedly viewing an attractive male affects time perception in females, and are the first demonstration that stimuli relevant to reproductive fitness, which engage the appetitive motivational system, can increase perceived duration...|$|R
40|$|Arrays of nanotubes/rods made of {{appropriate}} materials can yield unique radiative properties, such as large absorption and optical anisotropy, with broad applications from high-efficiency emitters and absorbers for energy conversion to the polarization conversion via anisotropic responses. The {{objective of this}} dissertation is to investigate the radiative properties of arrays formed by aligned carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and silver nanorods (AgNRs). The CNT arrays {{used in the present}} study consist of multi-walled CNTs synthesized vertically on silicon substrates using thermal chemical vapor deposition. Their close-to-unity absorptance is demonstrated by measuring the directional-hemispherical reflectance in the visible and near-infrared spectral ranges using an integrating sphere. The bidirectional reflectance distribution function and angle-resolved reflectance were measured at the 635 -nm wavelength. The results demonstrate that high-absorptance CNT arrays may be diffusely or specularly reflecting and have important applications in radiometry. Theoretical modeling based on the effective medium theory (EMT) and reflectivity of an anisotropic medium are developed to explain the high absorption and polarization dependence. The effective optical constants of the CNT array for both ordinary and extraordinary polarizations are quantitatively determined by fitting the angle-resolved reflectance. The AgNR arrays {{used in the present study}} were fabricated using oblique angle deposition, which results in inclined Ag nanorods that can be modeled as an effective homogenous and optically anisotropic thin film. The spectral and directional radiative properties of AgNRs grown on different substrates, including a glass slab with a silver film, and compact <b>disc</b> <b>gratings,</b> were characterized at the 635 -nm and 977 -nm wavelengths for different polarizations. The results are analyzed based on the EMT, rigorous coupled-wave analysis, and anisotropic thin-film optics. The results of this dissertation help gain a better understanding of radiative properties of anisotropic nanostructures for potential applications in high-efficiency energy conversion, radiometric devices, and optical systems.
