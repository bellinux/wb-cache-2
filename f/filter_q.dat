Seismic wave {{attenuation}} has strong, {{negative effect}} on the seismic data resolution. The high influence of this phenomenon was observed during realization of seismic survey "Duża Wólka 3 D" (Geofizyka Kraków S. A. 2010 a). The resolution of recorded seismic data was very low due to high attenuation caused by the Lower Triassic Buntsandstein sandstones. In consequence, interpretation of the thin-layered Zechstein formation is ambiguous. The aim {{of this paper is to}} present the multi-stage algorithm for the purpose of minimizing the attenuation effect, hence increasing the resolution of the seismic data. In order to achieve this, the inverse <b>Q</b> <b>filtering</b> process was used. The Q factor (quality factor) was estimated from the vertical seismic profiling data (Geofizyka Kraków S. A. 2010 c). To verify the effectiveness of inverse <b>Q</b> <b>filtering,</b> seismic modelling was performed.

The objective of this thesis is to explore the better DR performance of RF filters using the Q-enhanced LC filter. It takes a divide-and-conquer method by designing 1. A new simple pseudo-differential pair (PDP) for input gm stage. It is the fastest, high-linearity, low-distortion, and wide-range constant-gm design reported to date. This has been applied in the final filter tape-out and has proven to be effective experimentally. 2. A new tunable discrete inductor (TDL) to achieve two-level inductance with the same real estate {{that can be used to}} expand the filtering frequency range. This has been verified experimentally. 3. A new tunable discrete capacitor (TDC) to achieve high linearity over wide terminal voltage swing range. This has been verified through simulation. 4. A new systematic way to achieve synchronized gain, center frequency, and filtering Q tuning capability for Q-enhanced LC filters. It has been verified through simulation. In order to verify the concept, a 900 MHz filter is designed and fabricated with National Semiconductor Company (NSC) 's standard 0. 18 um digital epi-substrate CMOS technology, and packaged with NSC's LLP- 28. The measurement results show that with <b>filter</b> <b>Q</b> of 17 at 845 MHz, the 1 dB compression point is measured to be + 4 dBm, IIP 3 to be + 16 dBm with a peak noise floor of - 154 dB/Hz, spurious free dynamic range (SFDR) to be 71 dB. With <b>filter</b> <b>Q</b> of 70 over a 20 MHz BW, the 1 dB compression point is measured to be - 9. 5 dBm, IIP 3 to be + 7 dBm with a peak noise floor of - 141 dB/Hz, SFDR to be 57 over 20 MHz BW. This filter uses between 56 and 60 mA with a power supply of 1. 8 V due to the low-Q (Q~ 1) of inductor. It is the RF filter with the highest DR in the published literature.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{piezoelectric}} thin film actuation of RF MEMS devices. lt is demonstrated that piezoelectric actuation using silicon structures with integrated PZT thin film {{is suitable for}} RF MEMS switches and mechanical filters. Both these devices are studied, fabricated and tested. To assist the mechanical design of a piezoelectric microswitch an electrical model is developed, from which design parameters can be derived to meet the requirement of an insertion loss of - 1 dB and an isolation loss of - 40 dB at 4 GHz. The model shows how the switching gap and the overlapping dimension are two key parameters and the ratio between the two should be larger than 0. 15. Switching gaps are chosen as 5 m and 7. 5 m from the designed range of 3 ~ 15 m. An equivalent circuit network incorporating a transmission line model of the coupling beam is developed to demonstrate a design method for the mechanical filter. The model reveals that the coupling beam stiffness, coupling position, electromechanical coupling factor and the quality factor of the piezoelectric cantilever have substantial effects on filter characteristics. A narrower/wider bandwidth with higher/lower <b>filter</b> <b>Q</b> can result if the coupling position is near/further to a cantilever's anchor position. Extreme situations of the above two coupling cases result in filter bandwidth's disappearing and filter centre frequency's shifting. For a desired filter insertion loss source and load resistances need {{to be determined by}} quality factors of terminal circuit and coupled resonators. A bulk micromachining process compatible with the integration of PZT thin film onto silicon is developed. ln general, for PZT pattern size above 100 m wet etching could give satisfactory pattern definition, however for pattern size below 50 m dry etching is needed. To etch a thickness 2 1 m PZT film long dry etching lime demands for the survivability of a masking material. ln this study a technique combined of dry and wet etching is developed for a 1 m PZT film. lt is found that a low pressure promotes a higher etch rate and the best etching conditions are a gas mixture with a composition of 1 / 4 for CHF 3 /Ar at a total gas flow of 25 sccm under a RF power of 150 W. Dry etching is also developed to release cantilevers from the buried S 102 layer with conditions of a gas mixture of 13 sccm CHF 3 and 3 sccm 02 at 80 mTorr and a RF power of 100 W in 30 mins for 1 m Si 02. To be compatible with PZT elements silicon cantilevers are processed using deep reactive ion etching. PZT thin film actuation has been demonstrated successfully with PZI' thin film integrated silicon cantilevers. A static deflection of 2. 89 m is measured at an actuating voltage of 20 V for a 100 m wide and 450 m long cantilever. A displacement of 556 nm at 12. 98 kHz resonance is measured for a 200 m wide and 850 m long cantilever under a 10 mV AC plus a 10 V DC. A piezoelectric strain constant d 31 of 30. 15 pC/N has been obtained for the PZT thin film used in this study. Filter resonant modes and impedance responses are measured. The filter concept design is justified by the obtained results. Using the impedance data the electromechanical coupling factor, filter centre frequency, filter bandwidth and <b>filter</b> <b>Q</b> are determined. There is a good agreement between the measured and calculated filter centre frequencies. At the first filter resonant mode a maximum piezoelectric coupling factor of 0. 19 and a maximum resonator-Q of 235 are recorded. At the second filter resonant mode a maximum of 0. 12 and a maximum resonator-Q of 360 are obtained. Results show smaller coupling factors than required at the 13 ' and 2 " centre frequencies for all measured filters. This implies that pass bands of designed filters will be missing from their responses at the 18 ' and 2 " centre frequencies. Design improvements are given in the relevant results discussions. Residual stresses are studied for deflected cantilevers after release. The tensile stress of PZT, the converted tensile stress of Pt and the compressive stress of remaining buried SiO 2 layer could result in the upwards-deflected cantilevers. The compressive stress of P could compensate the tensile stress of PZT and flatten the cantilever beam. lf the buried SiO 2 layer is removed incompletely or if the tensile stress of PZT layer is very high, then upwards-deflected cantilevers would result. Measurements of the most switch cantilevers show larger initial deflections than the designed switching gaps. Finally, conclusions and suggestions of future work are given...|$|E

40|$|The {{hard disk}} drive (HDD) {{industry}} strives for higher storage densities and capacities. The critical factor {{for the performance of}} HDDs in this regard is the track mis-registration (TMR) which is the statistical number to indicate the performance of track-following control. After traditional track-following servo control, several visible frequency components remain in the spectrum of non-repeatable position error signal (PES). The dominant ones among these frequency components are a main contributor to the TMR. The rejection of these dominant components via servo control is difficult {{due to the fact that}} the frequency of the dominant component is not exactly known. This dissertation introduces several adaptive control schemes to reject the dominant frequency component (narrow band disturbance with the largest magnitude) to reduce TMR for higher achievable areal density of HDDs. A natural approach to narrow band disturbance rejection is indirect adaptive control, which involves two steps both performed in real time. At the first step, the frequency of the dominant component is estimated. Two frequency estimation methods are investigated in this dissertation. The discrete Fourier transform (DFT) method results in fast and accurate frequency estimation, but its large computational amount makes it an impratical approach for on-line identification. The least mean squares (LMS) algorithm is a computationally simple method for frequency identification. Carefully choosing the step size profile, the frequency estimate converges within one revolution and the resulting bias is small. The second step of the indirect adaptive control is to apply an add-on compensator based on the frequency estimate to reject the dominant component. Two choices for the add-on compensator are discussed in this dissertation. One is to identify the magnitude and phase of the dominant component. With the identified frequency, magnitude and phase, an estimate of the dominant component is constructed and then canceled by the control signal. This scheme is further extended to rejecting multiple frequency components. Another proposed compensator adopts the structure of a disturbance observer (DOB). The <b>Q</b> <b>filter</b> in DOB is selected to be a narrow band-pass filter centered at the estimated frequency. A deep notch in the error rejection function is introduced by the DOB with such a <b>Q</b> <b>filter</b> to reject the dominant component. Two direct adaptive control schemes, which adapt compensator parameters directly, are also applied to compensate for the dominant component. One scheme applies a finite-impulse-response (FIR) <b>Q</b> <b>filter</b> built around the baseline servo controller to reject the dominant component based on Youla-Kucera parameterization. The coefficients of the <b>Q</b> <b>filter</b> are updated in such a way that the resulting controller incorporates the internal model of the narrow-band disturbance. To make the scheme suited for HDD systems, two modifications are proposed: 1) adding a pre-specified term to the <b>Q</b> <b>filter</b> to avoid large transient oscillation, and 2) cascading a bandpass <b>filter</b> to the <b>Q</b> <b>filter</b> to deal with inaccurate HDD plant model as well as to limit the waterbed effect to a certain frequency range. Another direct adaptive controller adopts the disturbance observer (DOB) loop with a narrow bandpass <b>Q</b> <b>filter.</b> The frequency parameter of the <b>Q</b> <b>filter</b> is directly adapted to the optimal value in the sense of minimizing the track-following TMR. Realistic simulation tools are used to show that all adaptive control schemes described in this dissertation are effective in terms of rejecting narrow band disturbances to achieve smaller TMR. The advantages and disadvantages of each scheme are also discussed...|$|R

Firstly, the equivalent linear model of the electro-hydraulic loading system under assumed parameter uncertainty is established. Then, a hybrid control scheme is proposed for the loading system.

The constant velocity compensator eliminates most of the extraneous force at first, and then the double-loop cascade composition control strategy is employed to design the compensated system. The disturbance observer–based inner loop compensator further restrains the disturbances including the remaining extraneous force, and makes the actual plant tracking a nominal model approximately in a certain frequency range.
