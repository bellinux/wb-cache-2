Quality was assessed using the Translation Assessment Quality Tool. Results Only six of the 48 translations of the SDQ were rated as acceptable, all from Google Translate. The mean number of acceptably translated sentences was higher (P = 0 · 001) for Google Translate 17 · 1 (sd 7 · 2) than for Babylon 9 11 (sd 7 · 9).

40|$|Background: Low health {{literacy}} increases costs and negatively affects outcomes. According to recent surveys, Hispanics comprise the lowest scoring ethnic group. To increase understanding, information {{is provided in}} Spanish. Question: How do select English and Spanish medication information sheets compare? Purpose: The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine whether medication information given to a patient in English had the exact same formation and readability level as that given in Spanish. Design: Case Study. Methods: Two drug information sheets, one on Warfarin and one on Amoxicillin from two different pharmacies, were chosen for comparison. We translated the Spanish drug information <b>sheets</b> into <b>English</b> to compare and contrast the information and readability. Results: Many of the <b>English</b> information <b>sheets</b> were easier to read due to page layout and word choice than the Spanish-to-English. Also, some of the information in the English version was different than the Spanish-to-English version. Conclusion: Medical personnel need to be knowledgeable about the information given to their patients in order to provide the best care. They cannot assume that the translated versions contain the same information as the English version. More research needs to be explored about this topic so that practice can be improved...|$|R

40|$|The Business of Satirical Prints in Late-Georgian England is a {{book about}} <b>English</b> single <b>sheet</b> satirical prints {{published}} 1780 - 1820, {{the people who made}} those prints, and the businesses that sold them. It explores how these objects were made, how they were sold, and how both the complexity of that making and the necessity to sell shaped and constrained the satiric content these objects contained. It argues that production, sale, and environment are crucial to understanding late-Georgian satirical prints. A majority of these prints were, after all, published in London and were therefore woven into the commercial culture of the Great Wen. Because of that city and that culture, the activities of the many individuals involved in transforming a single satirical design into a saleable and commercially viable object were underpinned by a nexus of making, selling, and consumption. And so neglecting any one part of this nexus does a disservice both to the late-Georgian satirical print, these most beloved objects of British art, and to the story of their late-Georgian apotheosis – a story that develops in The Business of Satirical Prints in Late-Georgian England not through the designs these objects contained but rather through those objects and the designs they contained in the making...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{collects}} several notes I've written {{over the}} last year in an attempt to work through my dissatisfactions with the ideas about representation I was taught in school. Among these ideas are the notion of a 'world model'; the notion of representations having 'content' independent of the identity, location, attitudes, or activities of any agent; and the notion that a representation is the sort of thing you might implement with datastructures and pointers. Here I begin developing an alternative view of representation whose prototype is a set of instructions written in <b>English</b> on a <b>sheet</b> of paper you're holding in your hand while pursuing some ordinarily complicated concrete project in the everyday world. Figuring out what the markings on this paper are talking about is a fresh problem in every next setting, and solving this problem takes work. Several detailed stories about representation use in everyday activities—such as assembling a sofa from a kit, being taught to fold origami cranes, following stories across pages of a newspaper, filling a photocopier with toner, and keeping count when running laps—illustrate this view. Finally, I address the seeming tension between necessity of interpreting one's representations in every next setting and the idea that everyday life is fundamentally routine.
