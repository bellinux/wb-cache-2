It is hoping that someone will be able to reopen the restaurant.|$|E
25|$|The GAO {{report also}} {{identified}} major security risks to FBI {{personnel in the}} D.C. metropolitan area because of the Hoover building's limitations. The Hoover building is surrounded on all sides by busy city streets which {{are just a few}} feet from the structure. Additionally, because the Hoover Building is too small to accommodate the FBI's post-9/11 activities, the agency <b>has</b> <b>leased</b> space in 21 locations throughout the metro area, nine of which are in multi-tenant buildings. The FBI admitted its internal security forces are not stationed at these leased spaces, but merely patrol them periodically.|$|E

Recently, Silliman constructed the Portal West Building, a five-storey commercial building on campus, to help augment its operational expenses. In line with the same policy, it <b>has</b> <b>leased</b> portions of its properties to business entities to further raise its financial base.|$|E

A Ugandan conglomerate called the Madhvani Group has also entered into a preliminary agreement {{with the government of}} South Soudan to revitalize a government-owned sugar plantation and processing facility in Mangala Payam. This plantation would cover 10,000 ha of prime riverfront property along the Nile, about 70 kilometers north of Juba.

The two countries also collaborate extensively {{in the sphere of}} counter-terrorism and space technology. India also enjoys strong military relations with several other countries, including the United Kingdom, the United States, Japan, Singapore, Brazil, South Africa and Italy.

25|$|The current {{chief of}} Clan Mackenzie lives at Castle Leod, which {{is thought to}} date from the 16th century. The chief <b>has</b> <b>leased</b> the unoccupied old tower to the Clan Mackenzie Charitable Trust (CMCT) for 99 years. In 1991 it was {{announced}} that the castle was planned to be restored. The restoration was to include a clan genealogical centre that would be open to the public. During the 1990s there was extensive work done on the tower. In 2002 the Highland Buildings Preservation Trust (HBPT) was contacted, to carry out a feasibility study to investigate the potential for the re-use of the upper floor space of the tower, which deemed public funding to be sought to cover the costs of restoration. Because of concerns of physical and legal separation between the clan chief and the tower, the chief decided that the conditions of public funding were too onerous.|$|E

2500|$|According to a 2007 {{report of}} the Israel Land Authority, 40% of the {{population}} were living in unrecognized villages, Many insist on remaining in unrecognized villages {{in the hope of}} retaining their traditions and customs; these are rural villages, some of which pre-date Israel. However, in 1984, the courts ruled that the Negev Bedouin had no land ownership claims, effectively illegalizing their existing settlements. The Israeli government defines these rural Bedouin villages as [...] "dispersals" [...] while the international community refers to them as [...] "unrecognized villages". Few of the Bedouin in unrecognized villages have seen the urban townships as a desirable form of settlement. Extreme unemployment has afflicted unrecognized villages as well, breeding extreme crime levels. Sources of income such as grazing have been severely restricted and the Bedouin rarely receive permits to engage in self-subsistence agriculture, although the ILA <b>has</b> <b>leased</b> on a yearly-basis JNF-owned land in Besor Valley (Wadi Shallala) to Bedouin.|$|E

Located directly across from City Hall, the One Pace Plaza complex houses most of the classrooms, administrative offices, a [...] student union, a 750-seat community theater, and an 18-floor high-rise residence hall (known as [...] "Maria's Tower"). 41 Park Row was the 19th-century headquarters of The New York Times, and carrying on that legacy the building today houses the campus' student newspaper The Pace Press, as well as student organization offices, the Pace University Press, faculty offices, the university's bookstore, and classrooms. 41 Park Row also houses the Haskins Laboratories, [...] of Dr. Seymour H. Hutner, where medical experiments are held, like the Green tea extract study in the international media. The buildings of 157 William Street, 161 William Street, and 163 William Street were acquired by Pace following the September 11 attacks {{to make up for}} loss of the entire 55th floor, , in the North Tower of the World Trade Center which used to house Pace University's World Trade Institute and World Trade Conference Center (See the section below entitled September 11, 2001).

Here a fire was crackling on the hearth, refreshments were laid out, and the major in command rose from his book to greet me. Hospitality, with these people, has attained to art, and, though I had come here at the invitation of his government, I had the feeling of being his personal guest in his own house. Presently he led the way up the stone stairs and showed me the room I was to occupy.|$|E
60|$|What a progress, {{since the}} first salient-point of the Breton Committee! It worked long in secret, not languidly; it has come with the National Assembly to Paris; calls itself Club; calls itself in imitation, as is thought, of those generous Price-Stanhope English, French Revolution Club; but soon, with more originality, Club of Friends of the Constitution. Moreover it <b>has</b> <b>leased,</b> for itself, at a fair rent, the Hall of the Jacobin's Convent, one of our 'superfluous edifices;' and does {{therefrom}} now, in these spring months, begin shining out on an admiring Paris. And so, by degrees, under the shorter popular title of Jacobins' Club, it shall become memorable to all times and lands. Glance into the interior: strongly yet modestly benched and seated; as many as Thirteen Hundred chosen Patriots; Assembly Members not a few. Barnave, the two Lameths are seen there; occasionally Mirabeau, perpetually Robespierre; also the ferret-visage of Fouquier-Tinville with other attorneys; Anacharsis of Prussian Scythia, and miscellaneous Patriots,--though all is yet in the most perfectly clean-washed state; decent, nay dignified. President on platform, President's bell are not wanting; oratorical Tribune high-raised; nor strangers' galleries, wherein also sit women. Has any French Antiquarian Society preserved that written Lease of the Jacobins Convent Hall? Or was it, unluckier even than Magna Charta, clipt by sacrilegious Tailors? Universal History is not indifferent to it.|$|E
