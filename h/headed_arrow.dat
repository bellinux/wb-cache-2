5000|$|In 1633 or 1634, Seeley {{joined a}} ten-man {{expedition}} led by John Oldham to the Connecticut River. The group soon established Wethersfield, the first English settlement on the Connecticut River. Oldham's death in 1636, presumed by the colonists {{to be at}} the hands of the Pequot, helped touch off the Pequot War in 1637. Seeley served as second-in-command to Captain John Mason in the war. He was severely wounded by an arrow to the head in an attack on a Pequot fort along the Mystic River. Captain Mason, who called Seeley a [...] "valiant soldier", wrote of the incident, [...] "Lieutenant Seeley was shot in the eyebrow with a flat <b>headed</b> <b>Arrow,</b> the Point turning downwards. I pulled out the arrow myself." [...] Seeley carried a permanent scar from the wound.|$|E
50|$|The {{mechanism}} of resonance was introduced into quantum mechanics by Werner Heisenberg in 1926 {{in a discussion}} of the quantum states of the helium atom. He compared the structure of the helium atom with the classical system of resonating coupled harmonic oscillators. In the classical system, the coupling produces two modes, one of which is lower in frequency than either of the uncoupled vibrations; quantum mechanically, this lower frequency is interpreted as a lower energy. Linus Pauling used this mechanism to explain the partial valence of molecules in 1928, and developed it further in a series of papers in 1931-33. The alternative term mesomerism popular in German and French publications with the same meaning was introduced by C. K. Ingold in 1938, but did not catch on in the English literature. The current concept of mesomeric effect has taken on a related but different meaning. The double <b>headed</b> <b>arrow</b> was introduced by the German chemist Fritz Arndt who preferred the German phrase zwischenstufe or intermediate stage.|$|E

5000|$|At {{the time}} of Chakra vyuha (formation like a wheel) the two Panchala {{brothers}} wanted to meet Arjuna who was away from the battlefield and apprise him of the grave situation. As they could not pierce the Chakra vyuha, they tried to bypass the Kuru army. Duryodhana observed them and engaged them in battle. The brothers attacked Duryodhana with twenty arrows, and his horses with four more. Duryodhana demolished Yudhamanyu’s standard with a single arrow, his bow with another arrow and finally felled Yudhamanyu’s charioteer with a wedge <b>headed</b> <b>arrow,</b> stunning but not killing him. Uttamaujas killed Duryodhana’s charioteer with gold embellished arrows. In retaliation Duryodhana killed the four horses of Uttamaujas' chariot and also killed his two charioteers. Uttamaujas jumped from his now useless chariot and clambered into his brother’s chariot. Seeing that Duryodhana was marching towards them with his Gada (mace) both the brothers jumped out of their chariot and drove away in two other Rathas to meet Arjuna. (Mbh 7-127). During the Kurukshetra war Uttamaujas fought many great warriors of the enemy camp such as Drona, Angada, KritaVarma, Duryodhana, Karna, and Kripacharya. They accompanied the Pandavas when they {{went in search of}} Duryodhana who was hiding in a lake (Mbh 9-28). They were brutally murdered by Aswatthama at midnight after the war ended on the eighteenth day, while they were sleeping in the Padava camp. (Mbh. 10-8). Yudhistira cremated them along with the dead warriors of both the camps. (Mbh 11-26) ...|$|E

40|$|This report {{reviews the}} {{original}} RBAC model {{as defined in}} [1], corrects notational problems, and formulates a revised model to address noted discrepancies. The aim is to improve understanding of implications within the original model {{and to provide a}} firm baseline for subsequent activities involving the use or implementation of the model. Properties of the revised RBAC model are organized along two themes: static properties and dynamic properties. Static properties deal mainly with constraints on role membership, while dynamic properties deal with constraints on role activation [4]. With this perspective, several new properties are derived from those identified in the original model, and other new properties are proposed, taking into account aspects found in a number of related models [2, 3, 4, 8]. A list of minimum recommended properties, requisite for a system or product to be considered as a true instantiation of the revised model, is also proposed. Very little of the rationale given in [1] is repeated here; therefore, the reader is assumed to be familiar with its contents. 2. Model Elements The main components of the original model are User, Subject, Role, Function, Operation, and Object. The complete set of relationships among those components was not specified, however. Figure 1 (a) gives a representation derived from the available information, whereby a single <b>headed</b> <b>arrow</b> represents a one-to-many, binary relationship between model components, and a double <b>headed</b> <b>arrow</b> represents a many-to-many, binary relationship. One drawback of the original conceptual model is that it associates elements of Operation directly with those of Role, but independently of Object. In practice, elements of Operation and Object are closely coupled together when associated with an elem [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Photo-assisted etching (PAE) of p-Si in Cl 2 /Ar plasmas {{was first}} {{reported}} in Ref. [1]. The PAE rate was substantial {{compared to the}} ion-assisted etching rate, causing complications for processes that require low ion energies, such as etching with atomic layer resolution or highly selective and anisotropic etching of nano-features.
