According to author Lucy O'Brien, the singer wanted to prove that her second chance as a record {{producer}} (following her previous album True Blue) was not a fluke. Leonard started working on the chord changes for the verses and the chorus. He had hired guitarist Bruce Gaitsch and bass guitar player Guy Pratt {{to work on the}} track. Pratt had in turn hired some additional drummers. On the day of the recording, the drummers canceled, which irritated Madonna, and she started shouting and swearing profusely at Leonard and Pratt. The producer then hired British drum and guitar players such as Chester Kamens, David Williams and Dann Huff. He commented that the choice was deliberate since he was a fan of British rock, and wanted that <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>attitude</b> and quirkiness of the musicians in [...] "Like a Prayer", {{as well as the other}} songs of the album. Pratt was not fired, but later he realized that Madonna did not forgive him; she would call him at late nights for his opinion, and urgently ask him to come to the recording studio, only to be dismissed.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} is a qualitative research employing descriptive comparative method. It is aimed {{to describe and}} compare the appraisals applied by the writers in writing the two texts exposing the bailout of Bank Century entitled The Fallout of the Century and Why the Bank Century Bailout was a Correct Decision?, based on Systemic Functional Linguistic Approach. The source of data in this research was the opinion column of the Jakarta Post taken from www. thejakartapost. com. Total sampling technique {{was carried out in}} this research in taking sampling. The data used in this research were all clauses that consist <b>of</b> <b>attitudes</b> taken from the two texts. In collecting data, four <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> analysis called domain, taxonomy, componential and finding cultural values were applied. The data were observed and analyzed to find the <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>attitudes,</b> genre, prosody, ideology and cultural values behind the use <b>of</b> the <b>attitudes</b> in the texts. The results of the analysis can be seen as follows. First, in terms <b>of</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>attitudes,</b> both the first text and the second one employ three <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>attitudes,</b> namely: affect, judgement and appreciation. Second, the genre of the first text is analytical exposition. This {{can be seen from the}} thesis of the text which employs negative appreciations as well as the reiteration. Meanwhile, the genre of the second text belongs to discussion since the writer tries to discuss the issue from both the writer‟s and the reader‟s side. Third, Dealing with prosody, the first text tends to be more subjective since most <b>of</b> <b>attitudes</b> employed in the text come from the writer‟s own point of view. Meanwhile, the prosody of the second text tends to be more objective. This is because the attitudes employed in the text come from the writer and the other participants in the text. Fourth, the ideology of the first text is left antagonist since the text challenges the issue by employing negative attitudes which come mostly from the writer‟s own point of view. On the other side, the ideology of the second text is right protagonist since the writer supports the issue and employs two-sided analysis. Fifth, generally, the reason why the attitudes are employed in the first text is that the writer would like to express his disapproval toward the issue, in this case, the bailout of Bank Century. Meanwhile, the writer of the second text supports the issue and tries to prove that the bailout of Bank Century was a correct decision. ...|$|R

A questionnaire {{used to assess the}} knowledge, attitudes and perceptions towards date rape was developed from the College Date Rape Attitude and Behaviour Survey (CDRABS), created by Larnier & Elliot (1997). The results from the findings indicate that most university students have knowledge of date rape, however because of cultural believes and rape myths that determine the way individuals view and perceive date rape, it is underrecognised and is not regarded as something unacceptable. Midlands State University students portrayed neutral attitudes and perceptions towards date rape. When compared to Western countries the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>attitudes</b> and perceptions are significantly different.

However the researcher observed that the significance for perceptions and level is 0. 700 and significance for knowledge and marital status was 0. 684, indicating that there was no significant differences between and within groups of students in perceptual experiences and understanding of date rape.
