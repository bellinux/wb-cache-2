40|$|ABSTRACT: 4 -Chlorobenzoyl-coenzyme A (4 -CBA-CoA) dehalogenase catalyzes the hydrolytic dehalo-genation of 4 -CBA-CoA by {{attack of}} Asp 145 on the C(4) of the {{substrate}} benzoyl ring {{to form a}} Meisenheimer intermediate (EMc), followed by expulsion of chloride ion to form an arylated enzyme intermediate (EAr) and, finally, ester hydrolysis <b>in</b> <b>EAr</b> to <b>form</b> 4 -hydroxybenzoyl-CoA (4 -HBA-CoA). This study examines {{the contribution of the}} active site His 90 to catalysis of this reaction pathway. The His 90 residue was replaced with glutamine by site-directed mutagenesis. X-ray crystallographic analysis of H 90 Q dehalogenase complexed with 4 -HBA-CoA revealed that the positions of the catalytic groups are unchanged from those observed {{in the structure of the}} 4 -HBA-CoA-wild-type dehalogenase complex. The one exception is the Gln 90 side chain, which is rotated away from the position of the His 90 side chain. The vacated His 90 site is occupied by two water molecules. Kinetic techniques were used to evaluate ligand binding and catalytic turnover rates in the wild-type and H 90 Q mutant dehalogenases. The rate constants for 4 -CBA-CoA (both 7 íM- 1 s- 1) and 4 -HBA-CoA (33 and 11 íM- 1 s- 1) binding to the two dehalogenases are similar in value. For wild-type dehalogenase, the rate constant for a single turnover is 2. 3 s- 1 while that for multiple turnovers is 0. 7 s- 1. For H 90 Q dehalogenase, these rate constants are 1. 6 10 - 2 and 2 10 - 4 s- 1. The rate constants for EMc formation in wild-type and mutant dehalogenas...|$|R
40|$|In {{deep drawing}} process planar {{anisotropy}} {{is found to be}} a major problem. A high planar anisotropy causes <b>earing</b> <b>in</b> the <b>formed</b> cup (formation of wavy edge at the top). In this paper anisotropic behavior of stainless steel sheet is studied for drawn rectangular, circular and octagonal shaped parts. Finite element based simulation software PAMSTAMP 2 G is used to simulate the forming of the octagonal deep drawn cup. It is well known that the blank shape and size greatly affects the strain distribution in {{deep drawing process}}. Earing is a major problem due to highly anisotropic behavior of the selected material. To optimize the initial blank shape to minimize earing, the flow of material was observed at various steps during the forming and accordingly blank shapes were modified. Four blank shapes were considered to minimize <b>earing</b> for the <b>forming</b> of octagonal product. Finally a circular blank was used for forming of the octagonal part which gave minimum earing.

M. maculata has <b>ears</b> <b>in</b> the <b>form</b> of Vogel's organs located near the base of the forewings. Its behaviour in response to bursts of ultrasonic pulses (26 kHz, 110 dB SPL at 1 m) was condition-dependent. At dusk and dawn the sound consistently elicited evasive responses, similar to those of moths, in flying individuals. In contrast day-roosting individuals always remained motionless although they were alert to other stimuli. The daily movements between day- and night-roosts coincided in time and light intensity with the activity of insectivorous bats. This is the first reported case of ultrasonic hearing connected to evasive flights in a true butterfly (Papilionoidea). It strongly supports the idea that echolocating bats were involved in the evolution of hearing in butterflies...|$|R
40|$|Background: Staphylococcal superantigens (SAg's) {{may have}} some role in otitis media with {{effusion}} (OME). The {{aim of this study}} was the search of staphylococcal SAg's <b>in</b> middle <b>ear</b> effusion of children with OME.   Methods: This cross sectional-analytic study was done in ENT & pediatric wards upon 64 children with otitis media with effusion (OME) between 1 - 15 years, (mean age= 7. 42 + 4 years) of Rasoul Akram University Hospital, Tehran, Iran in 2009 - 2011. Fifty six percent (36) of cases were male, 43. 8 % (28) were female. Staphylococcal SAg's; Toxic Shock Syndrome Toxin- 1 (TSST- 1), Staphylococcal enterotoxin A, B, C, D (Enzyme immune assay, AB Cam, USA) were detected <b>in</b> middle <b>ear</b> effusion samples after conventional culture. Results: None type of SAg's found in 39 % of OME cases, enterotoxin B found in: 22 %; enterotoxin A: 17 %, enterotoxin C: 15. 6 %, enterotoxin D: 12. 5 %, Toxic Shock Syndrome Toxin- 1 (TSST- 1) : 7. 8 % Mean age of cases with positive TSST- 1, enterotoxin A, B, C, and D was: 1, 5, 8. 6, 9. 6 and 9. 6 years respectively. Positive TSST had no agreement with positive enterotoxin A and C but had weak agreement with type B and D. Mean age of cases with positive TSST was one years which had significant difference with (7. 9 years) in cases with negative TSST test (P< 0. 0001). Conclusion: At least one or more type of staphylococcal toxins had found <b>in</b> middle <b>ear</b> effusion of 70 % of OME cases with negative culture for Staphylococcus aureus.

When the ear of the corn is infected, it looks very small and tear-drop shaped and seems as though it does not have a cob inside at all. The cob is replaced by white sori which are the structures that make and hold the spores of the fungus. If there is an infected tassel, it is likely that the ears will also have head smut.|$|R
40|$|Research was {{undertaken}} {{to determine the}} nature of head movements made when judging spatial impression and to incorporate these into a system for measuring, in a perceptually relevant manner, the acoustic parameters which contribute to spatial impression: interaural time and level differences and interaural cross‐correlation coefficient. First, a subjective test was conducted that showed that (i) the amount of head movement was larger when evaluating source width and envelopment than when judging localization and timbre and (ii) the pattern of head movement resulted <b>in</b> <b>ear</b> positions that <b>formed</b> a sloped area. These findings led {{to the design of}} a binaural signal capture technique using a sphere with multiple microphones, mounted on a simulated torso. Evaluation of this technique revealed that it would be appropriate for the prediction of perceived spatial attributes including both source direction and aspects of spatial impression. Reliable derivation of these attributes across the range of ear positions determined from the earlier subjective test was shown to be possible with a limited number of microphones through an appropriate interpolation and calculation technique. A prototype capture system was suggested as a result, using a sphere with torso, with 21 omnidirectional microphones on each side.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{present study}} aimed {{to find the}} most {{sensitive}} placement of the skull to perceive speech through the bone vibrator in various protection methods while being exposed to noise. Twenty young normal-hearing adults (10 male and 10 female) participated in the study. As stimulus, Korean spondee words were presented via one of five skull locations (i. e., jaw angle, condyle, temple, mastoid, and vertex), while the participants wore one of four protection methods (i. e., <b>ear</b> <b>form,</b> <b>ear</b> plug, ear muff, and <b>ear</b> <b>form</b> and muff together) against white noise in one of four noise directions (i. e., 0, 90, 180, 270 degrees). The results showed: 1) {{there was a significant difference}} among the five skull locations with condyle being the most sensitive placement; 2) there was a significant difference among the four protection methods, with the <b>ear</b> <b>form</b> plus <b>ear</b> muff condition (or dual protection) providing the lowest threshold; 3) when exposed to noise from 90 degrees, the significantly lowest threshold was found; 4) there was no significant difference in results by gender.

40|$|BACKGROUND Chronic {{suppurative}} {{otitis media}} still remains {{a major cause}} of conductive hearing loss in our country.

The affected <b>ears</b> <b>formed</b> the ‘CSOM Group’ and the normal <b>ears</b> <b>formed</b> the ‘Control group’. Detailed otological history, clinical, surgical and audiometric findings were recorded and analysed. RESULTS It was inferred that CSOM associated with sensorineural hearing loss was found in small number of patients only. No correlation was established between duration of discharge and sensorineural loss. CONCLUSION Though greater SN loss was seen in patients of CSOM with cholesteatoma it was not statistically significant.

The {{purpose of the present study}} was to isolate and characterize blastema progenitor cells and compare them with marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Five New Zealand white male rabbits were used in the present study. A 2 -mm hole was created <b>in</b> the animal <b>ears.</b> After 4 days, the blastema ring formed in the periphery of the hole was removed and cultivated. The cells were expanded through several subcultures and compared with the MSCs derived from the marrow of same animal in terms of in vitro differentiation capacity, growth kinetics and culture requirements for optimal proliferation. The primary cultures from both cells tended to be heterogeneous. Fibroblastic cells became progressively dominant with advancing passages. Similar to MSCs blastema passaged- 3 cells succeeded to differentiate into bone, cartilage and adipose cell lineages. Even lineage specific genes tended to express in higher level in blastema cells compared to MSCs (p < 0. 05). Moreover blastema cells appeared more proliferative; producing more colonies (p < 0. 05). While blastema cells showed extensive proliferation in 15 % fetal bovine serum (FBS), MSCs displayed higher expansion rate at 10 % FBS. In conclusion, blastema from rabbit ear contains a population of fibroblastic cells much similar in characteristic to bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells. However, the two cells were different in the level of lineage-specific gene expression, the growth curve characteristics and the culture requirements...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: 4 -Chlorobenzoyl-coenzyme A (4 -CBA-CoA) dehalogenase catalyzes the hydrolytic {{dehalogenation}} of 4 -CBA-CoA to 4 -hydroxybenzoyl-CoA (4 -HBA-CoA) via a multistep mechanism involving initial {{attack of}} Asp 145 on C(4) of the substrate benzoyl ring {{to form a}} Meisenheimer intermediate (EMc), followed by expulsion of the chloride ion to form an arylated enzyme intermediate (EAr) and then ester hydrolysis <b>in</b> the <b>EAr</b> to <b>form</b> product. This study examines the role of binding interactions in dehalogenase catalysis. The enzyme and substrate groups positioned for favorable binding interaction were identified from the X-ray crystal structure of the enzyme- 4 -HBA- 3 ′-dephospho-CoA complex. These groups were individually modified (via site-directed mutagenesis or chemical synthesis) {{for the purpose of}} disrupting the binding interaction. The changes in the Gibbs free energy of the enzyme-substrate complex (∆∆GES) and enzyme-transition state complex (∆∆G q) brought about by the modification were measured. Cases where ∆∆G q exceeds ∆∆GES are indicative of binding interactions used for catalysis. On the basis of this analysis, we show that the H-bond interactions between the Gly 114 and Phe 64 backbone amide NHs and the substrate benzoyl CdO group contribute an additional 3. 1 kcal/mol of stabilization at the rate-limiting transition state. The binding interactions between the enzyme and the substrate CoA nucleotide moiety also intensify in the rate-limiting transition state, reducing the energy barrier to catalysis by an additiona...|$|R

The first main result of this paper is an algorithm for computing an e-based ear decomposition (that is, an ear decomposition every circuit of which contains element e) of a matroid using only a polynomial number of elementary operations and port oracle calls. In the case that M is binary, the incidence vectors of the circuits <b>in</b> the <b>ear</b> decomposition <b>form</b> a matrix representation for M. Thus, this algorithm solves a problem in computational learning theory; it learns the class of binary matroid port (BMP) functions with membership queries in polynomial time. In this context, the algorithm generalizes results of Angluin, Hellerstein, and Karpinski [1], and Raghavan and Schach [17], who showed that certain subclasses of the BMP functions are learnable in polynomial time using membership queries. The second main result of this paper is an algorithm for testing independence of a given input set of the matroid M. This algorithm, which uses the ear decomposition algorithm as a subroutine, uses only a polynomial number of elementary operations and port oracle calls.
