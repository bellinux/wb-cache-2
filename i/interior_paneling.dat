25|$|There, James Pinchot's primary {{endeavor}} {{was planning}} and designing Grey Towers {{and the land}} around it. At first, he developed the land along lines of the ornamental farm advocated by Andrew Jackson Downing. The original drive up the hill was meant {{to show off his}} orchards. In 1884, he retained Hunt, a family friend, to put these ideas for a French-style chateau, modeled after the Marquis de Lafayette's LaGrange and reflecting the Pinchot family's origin in France, on paper for eventual construction. Two years later it was complete, but not before Pinchot altered the plans slightly to save money. While Hunt was away in Europe, he also had Edwards-Ficken alter Hunt's design slightly when bedrock on the site made it difficult to build the raised foundation Hunt had originally planned. Edwards-Ficken added some of his own decorative touches to the house, such as the front door, <b>interior</b> <b>paneling</b> and wrought iron porches on the south and east facades.|$|E
500|$|The Avery House {{was listed}} on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. According to the {{nomination}} form and the multiple property submission sheet, the house is historically significant {{as an example of}} a well-preserved house that does not have its historical integrity degraded by alterations. McMahon writes that [...] "he <b>interior</b> <b>paneling</b> is the finest in any 18th-century house owned by DEP (Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection)." [...] Originally, the house was set to have the surrounding [...] as part of its designation, but this was later changed to [...] because it would not impact the historic setting.|$|E
500|$|The 757 {{interior}} allows seat {{arrangements of}} up to six per row with a single center aisle. [...] Originally optimized for flights averaging two hours, the 757 features interior lighting and cabin architecture designs aimed at a more spacious impression. As on the 767, garment-bag-length overhead bins and a rear economy-class galley are standard equipment. The bins have twice the capacity as those on the preceding 727. To save weight, honeycomb sandwich is used for <b>interior</b> <b>paneling</b> and bins. Unlike previous evacuation slide designs which are not equipped for water landings, the 757's main exits feature combination slide rafts {{similar to those found}} on the 747. In the 1980s, Boeing altered the interior designs of its other narrow-body aircraft to be {{similar to that of the}} 757.|$|E

2500|$|With the {{exception}} of the trucks sold in Mexico, the first generation Honda Ridgeline was offered in five to seven different exterior colors as well as one to three interior colors. [...] Exterior colors were based on different shades of black, gray, white, silver, blue, and red as well as some short-lived green and brown colors. [...] All of the exterior colors were monotone with some black and/or chrome plastic trim. [...] Most interior colors ranged between olive, beige, gray, and black.

50|$|The U.S. Navy Bureau of Ships approves {{mahogany}} for use {{in small}} boats and high-speed boats that require a wood easy to work, medium in weight but adequate in strength, with low shrinking, swelling, and warping characteristics, and high decay resistance. In 1966, mahogany still held an important place {{in the construction of}} yachts, launches, motorboats, and small boats of various kinds. In large ships its use is confined largely to <b>interior</b> trim, <b>paneling,</b> and furniture. In a large luxury liner, the volume for such uses may be considerable.|$|R
50|$|The Whiting Homestead is an {{historic}} house at 291 North Main Street in West Hartford, Connecticut. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, five bays wide, {{with a large}} central chimney, and a center entrance.

The house was probably built c. 1790 by Gurdon Saltonstall Whiting, and is one West Hartford's few surviving 18th-century houses. It is particularly notable for its largely intact and extensive <b>interior</b> wood <b>paneling.</b>|$|R
50|$|Air {{stratification}} {{and moisture}} distribution within a dome are unusual. The conditions tend to quickly degrade wooden framing or <b>interior</b> <b>paneling.</b> A company called New Age Construction in Alabama claims that an {{addition of a}} cupola eliminates the moisture condensation that is common in domes.|$|E
50|$|The wood is {{primarily}} used in veneer production for furniture, {{but is also}} used in musical instrument production, <b>interior</b> <b>paneling,</b> and other hardwood products; the heartwood is light, reddish-brown, fine-grained, moderately heavy, and moderately hard and strong. Lakwungen First Nations people of Vancouver Island call it the paddle tree {{and used it to}} make paddles and spindle wheels.|$|E

50|$|Its NRHP {{nomination}} describes that:The house {{displays the}} essential qualities for which Sundeleaf's Arts and Crafts architecture is admired. Porches have heavy post and beam framing. Solid craftsmanship emphasizes <b>interior</b> wood <b>paneling</b> and trim. A square module {{is used for}} division of window space, including sidelights for view windows on which such premium is placed in Portland's west hills. Building volumes are stepped down to the landscape through sheltered terraces and projecting window bays. The architect brings forward from earlier projects (see Clarence Francis House) a rear gallery—an updated screens passage which in archetypical manor houses leads to private compartments from the great hall or circulation core.|$|R

50|$|Over {{the years}} the unstained {{exterior}} has weathered to an inky brown, while the finished <b>interior</b> <b>paneling</b> retains the pale blush of newly sawn wood. Architect I.M. Pei has said, “Architecture has to have an element of time.” Here, time expresses itself in the building’s patina, amplifying the architectural message by distinguishing {{the realities of the}} exterior world from the eternal quality of the spiritual realm.|$|E
50|$|Reportedly, Mrs. Kirk {{wanted a}} more {{elaborate}} porch than originally designed so, {{in order to}} satisfy the client, the architects added metal columns with ornamental terra cotta capitals to enhance the square stone piers which actually supported the porch roof. According to another traditional story, the contractor was unable to order new quartersawn oak lumber for the <b>interior</b> <b>paneling</b> and instead acquired and reused paneling from a Chicago mansion being demolished.|$|E
