Recognition is possible whether the shape is presented in simple outline, as a random dot stereogram, or by motion contrast. We report <b>here</b> that <b>bees</b> <b>have</b> a similar ability: they can recognize a shape when it is learned through visual signals of one kind and subsequently viewed through another. The results reveal that (i) <b>bees</b> that <b>have</b> learned a shape defined in terms of luminance contrast can recognize the same shape when it is defined in terms of motion contrast, (ii) shapes that are delineated by motion contrast are discriminated through a channel that receives input only from the green photoreceptors, (iii) a shape learned through one class of signal is subsequently recognized via any of these other classes, and (iv) shape is memorized in a generic form regardless of whether it is initially sensed by green-contrast, blue-contrast, luminance-contrast, or motion-contrast signals...|$|R

A great deal of expense and effort would have been needed to build this long section of dyke, which seems to have been in place by 1911.|$|R
