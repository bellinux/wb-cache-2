40|$|This thesis {{reports the}} {{numerical}} {{investigation of the}} automotive ventilated disc <b>brake</b> <b>rotor.</b> Disc <b>brakes</b> operate {{on the principle of}} friction by converting kinetic energy into heat energy. The main objective of a disc <b>brake</b> <b>rotor</b> is to store this heat energy and dissipate it as soon as possible. This work is carried out in a area where there is very limited understanding. Commercial CFD code FLUENT was used for carrying out the simulations with the rotor rotating in still air. Only one passage and blade were simulated as all the rotor passages were identical. Uniform temperatures were used on the rotor to simulate the braking condition. Sixteen different blade angle sets were simulated and the range of blade angles having the best aero-thermal performance were identified using mass flow rate, rate of heat dissipation and temperature uniformity as performance metrics. The effect of rotational speed and <b>rotor</b> <b>temperature</b> (corresponding to various braking conditions) on the aero-thermal performance was evaluated. The <b>rotor</b> speed and <b>temperature</b> were observed to have significant effect on the rotor performance. The number of blades in the ventilated disc <b>brake</b> <b>rotor</b> was also varied and was observed {{to have an impact on}} the aero-thermal performance of the disc <b>brake</b> <b>rotor.</b> Detailed design changes like inlet chamfer, blade leading edge rounding, and variable thickness blade and passage aspect ratio were incorporated. All these changes did have an effect on the aero-thermal performance of the disc <b>brake</b> <b>rotor.</b> The inlet chamfer and the leading edge rounding improved both the rate of heat transfer and the temperature uniformity. The variable thickness blade and the lower aspect ratio passage improved the temperature uniformity of the rotor...|$|R

40|$|An {{important}} part of automobile safety is the braking system. Disc brakes {{have been widely used}} in automobiles for sped retardation for over 30 years. During that time, they have developed from a simple disc to a complex disc with channels, vanes, holes and grooves. The stopping capability of disc brakes is affected by the rate at which heat is dissipated by forced convection and the thermal capacity of the rotor. Catastrophic failure of <b>brake</b> <b>rotors</b> can occur during rapid increases or decreases in <b>rotor</b> <b>temperature</b> where regions of high temperature gradients result in high thermal strains. There is little information in the public domain regarding the relative merits of different disc <b>brake</b> <b>rotor</b> geometries, particularly in terms of airflow patterns, heat transfer rates, and internal thermal gradients. The aim of this research project was to investigate how geometrical variations affect the thermal performance of bi-directional disc <b>brake</b> <b>rotors,</b> particularly for high performance applications. Dynamometer testing showed that respectable increases in braking performance are achievable with relatively simple machining modifications. Tuft and smoke visualization techniques provided a preliminary understanding of the airflow in the passages of three distinct bi-directional rotor designs. Particle Image Velocimetry was used for detailed flow measurements which supported the numerical simulations. Computational Fluid Dynamics was used to predict the airflow and heat transfer associated with eight bi-directional <b>brake</b> <b>rotor</b> designs. The results show that 'pillared' passage designs can achieve higher heat transfer rates than traditional straight radial vane designs and that the heat loss from pillared rotors is generally more uniform than from vaned rotors. Subsequent conjugate heat transfer simulations found that temperature gradients inside pillared rotors are typically lower than inside vaned rotors. Thus failure rates due to excessive thermal strain are expected to be lower for pillared rotors. It was shown that rotor selection based solely on heat transfer rates is inappropriate and different passage designs are suited to different applications. The findings of this research will directly benefit local disc brake manufacturers, who do not have resources to conduct thorough studies comparing the thermal characteristics of different <b>brake</b> <b>rotor</b> designs...|$|R

40|$|Aluminium alloys {{have been}} used {{extensively}} in the automotive industry to reduce {{the weight of a}} vehicle and improve fuel consumption which in turn leads to a reduction in engine emissions. The main aim of the current study is to replace the conventional cast iron rotor material with a lightweight alternative such as coated aluminium alloy. The main challenge has been to meet both the cost and functional demands of modern mass-produced automotive braking systems. A sensitivity analysis based on the Taguchi approach was carried out to investigate the effect of various parameters on the thermal performance of a typical candidate disc brake. Wrought aluminium disc <b>brake</b> <b>rotors</b> coated with alumina on the rubbing surfaces were determined to have the best potential for replacing the conventional cast iron rotor at reasonable cost. Optimisation of the structure was subsequently carried out using a genetic algorithm on the selected coated aluminium disc <b>brake</b> <b>rotor.</b> This determines the optimum thickness of the coating and the composition of the substrate based on selected criteria. Prototype aluminium disc <b>brake</b> <b>rotors</b> were coated with alumina using the Plasma Electrolytic Oxidation (PEO) technique and the thermal performance of these lightweight rotors was investigated experimentally using a brake dynamometer.

40|$|Includes bibliographical referencesTwo magnesium/silicon {{aluminium}} alloys each reinforced with 20 vol. % SiC particulates have been worn against three different automobile friction linings (brake pads). Two of the friction linings {{are commonly used}} against cast iron <b>brake</b> <b>rotors</b> while the third has been formulated for use against aluminium MMC <b>brake</b> <b>rotors.</b> Wear processes at the interfaces of the specific rotor - pad combinations have been characterised through the analysis of friction traces {{and the use of}} optical and electron microscopy. Models on the interdependence of friction and wear, and models of wear mechanisms for aluminium MMCs and cast iron sliding against friction materials have been proposed and discussed. For an aluminium MMC sliding against an organic pad formulated for use against cast iron, wear rates are low and friction is constant due to the formation of a solid lubricant layer at the wear interface. When this MMC is worn against a semi-metallic pad formulated for use against cast iron, wear rates are extremely high due to two and three body abrasion which lead to subsurface delamination and early melt wear in the MMC. For an aluminium MMC developed for its use in automobile <b>brake</b> <b>rotors</b> sliding against a semi-metallic pad specifically formulated for its use against MMC <b>brake</b> <b>rotors,</b> wear rates at low loads are low although friction traces are irregular and fracture of the SiC particulates occurs at the lowest load and sliding velocity. This fracture of SiC is caused by the abrasive action of hard alumina particles within the pad. At high loads and sliding velocities cohesiveness of materials within the pad is poor and the wear rate of the MMC is extremely high. At the highest load/sliding velocity combination, the wear resistance of the MMC is inferior to that of its unreinforced matrix. If the structure and composition of friction linings are arranged correctly, the wear resistance and frictional performance of aluminium MMC <b>brake</b> <b>rotors</b> are superior to those of cast iron <b>brake</b> <b>rotors.</b> In addition, the lower density of aluminium MMCs provides for an economic advantage over cast iron with respect to efficient use of fuel, and fabrication expenses...|$|R

40|$|Abstract <b>Rotor</b> <b>temperature</b> {{variation}} {{is a significant}} issue {{in the design of}} induction motor controls. In the literature, numerous studies have mentioned significant performance degradation due to <b>rotor</b> <b>temperature</b> variation unless it is taken into account. However, those studies have mainly focused on field-oriented control in terms of tracking performance. There was little research about the influence of <b>rotor</b> <b>temperature</b> variation on performance particularly in the case of optimal controls such as maximum torque per amp (MTPA) control strategy. This work investigates how to affect the performance of maximum torque per amp (MTPA) control strategy as <b>rotor</b> <b>temperature</b> varies in time. To this end, investigation was carried out in two ways to see whether the objective of MTPA control strategy is achieved regardless of <b>rotor</b> <b>temperature</b> variation. It is to produce a desired torque with the minimum possible stator current at the same time.

40|$|<b>Brake</b> <b>rotors</b> play a {{significant}} role in converting the vehicle kinetic energy into heat energy that is dissipated through conduction and convection. The automotive industry has been looking for many years to develop lightweight <b>brake</b> <b>rotors</b> to reduce vehicle weight and subsequently improve fuel efficiency and vehicle emissions targets. Uncoated wrought aluminium alloys and metal matrix composite (Al-MMC) rotors have been reported to have insufficient safety margin for most passenger car applications. In this study, the thermal performance of coated and uncoated lightweight aluminium disc <b>brake</b> <b>rotors</b> was investigated numerically and experimentally, using both small scale and full size brake dynamometers. Five small scale solid <b>brake</b> <b>rotors</b> were investigated: grey cast iron, forged aluminium alloy (6082), the same 6082 alloy but with an alumina surface layer applied by plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO), cast aluminium MMC (AMC 640 XA), and the same MMC again with PEO alumina surface layer. The disc and pad temperatures, brake pressure, coefficient of friction and brake torque were monitored during the tests for each disc brake material. In addition, a two dimensional axisymmetric finite element model was developed using Abaqus software in order to investigate the temperature distribution through the disc. The 2 D FE model demonstrated good overall agreement with the experimental results and showed the same general trends. It was found that the PEO coated aluminium alloy has the best overall performance of the lightweight rotors tested in terms of friction and structural integrity at elevated temperature...|$|R
