His group used a diamond crystal doped with a high concentration of nitrogen-vacancy centers, which have strong dipole-dipole coupling and relatively long-lived spin coherence. By driving this strongly-interacting dipolar spin system with microwave fields and reading out the ensemble spin state with an optical (laser) field, it was observed that the spin polarization evolved at half the frequency of the microwave drive. The oscillations persisted for over 100 cycles. This sub-harmonic response to the <b>drive</b> <b>frequency</b> is seen as a signature of time-crystalline order.|$|E
50|$|Amplitude {{modulation}} {{can fail}} if the non-conservative forces (damping) change during the experiment, as this changes the amplitude of the resonance peak itself, {{which will be}} interpreted as a change in resonant frequency.

In constant height mode this will just lead to an image artefact, but in feedback mode the feedback will read this as a stronger attractive force, causing positive feedback until the feedback saturates.|$|E

Note that the simple analogy between light within the MM apparatus and a standing wave on a string cannot be strictly true. Standing waves on a string are oscillations in three-dimensional space of a one-dimensional medium, while light waves in an ether are assumed to be an oscillating displacement of the three-dimensional ether. Also, while the thumb and forefinger clearly hold the displacement of the string to zero, the partially transparent mirror does not require the electric field to be zero. The physical pictures are not completely equivalent.|$|E
5000|$|The typical {{fluxgate}} magnetometer {{consists of}} a [...] "sense" [...] (secondary) coil surrounding an inner [...] "drive" [...] (primary) coil that is closely wound around a highly permeable core material, such as mu-metal. An alternating current {{is applied to the}} drive winding, which drives the core in a continuous repeating cycle of saturation and unsaturation. To an external field, the core is alternately weakly permeable and highly permeable. The core is often a toroidally-wrapped ring or a pair of linear elements whose drive windings are each wound in opposing directions. Such closed flux paths minimise coupling between the drive and sense windings. In the presence of an external magnetic field, with the core in a highly permeable state, such a field is locally attracted or gated (hence the name fluxgate) through the sense winding. When the core is weakly permeable, the external field is less attracted. This continuous gating of the external field {{in and out of the}} sense winding induces a signal in the sense winding, whose principal frequency is twice that of the <b>drive</b> <b>frequency,</b> and whose strength and phase orientation vary directly with the external field magnitude and polarity.|$|E

5000|$|A typical {{integrated}} circuit layout for {{an array of}} 20 208 junctions is shown in Fig. 6. The microwave drive power is collected from a waveguide by a finline antenna, split 16 ways, and injected into 16 junction strip lines of 1263 junctions each. The junction striplines are separated from a superconductive ground plane by about 2 micrometers of SiO2 dielectric. Symmetry in the splitting network ensures that the same power is delivered to each subarray. Several precautions are required to avoid reflections {{that would lead to}} standing waves and the consequent nonuniform power distribution within the subarrays: (1) Each stripline is terminated by a matched load that consists of several wavelengths of resistive strip line. The use of resistive stripline rather than a discrete resistor guarantees a near perfect match over a wide range of fabrication parameters. The dimensions of capacitors in the low- and high-pass filters are chosen to avoid resonances near the <b>drive</b> <b>frequency.</b> (3) The microwave bend radius has a minimum value of three times the stripline width. Sharper bends result in unacceptable reflections. In order to meet the bend requirement while still packing the array strips close together, [...] "curly" [...] bends that turn 215° and then back 45° are used. (4) The junction spacing along the line must be close enough to avoid a resonance between adjacent junctions. Microwave power is applied by inserting the finline end of the chip into a slot parallel to the E-field in a WR-12 waveguide. The dc output appears across superconducting pads {{at the edge of the}} chip.|$|E

A {{performance}} evaluation of plate-type piezoelectric composite actuators (PCA) having different lay-up sequences was experimentally {{carried out at}} simply supported and fixed-free boundary conditions.

It was shown that the actuating displacement with increasing applied electric field at a <b>drive</b> <b>frequency</b> of 1 Hz increased nonlinearly at the simply supported boundary condition whereas it almost linearly increased at the fixed-free boundary condition. In contrast, the actuating displacement of the PCAs depended on the applied electric fields in a <b>drive</b> <b>frequency</b> range from 1 Hz to 10 Hz.

In the presence of inelastic scattering, the k-space velocity modulation causes a wave-like bunching of the electrons in k-space, which in turn introduces a high-frequency component in the real-space current, synchronous with the drive field, but phase-shifted relative to the latter.

50|$|The {{installation}} {{and integration of}} variable <b>frequency</b> <b>drives</b> can lower the energy consumption of the building's circulation pumps to about 15% {{of what they had}} been using before. A variable <b>frequency</b> <b>drive</b> functions by modulating the frequency of the electricity provided to the motor that it powers. In the USA, the electrical grid uses a frequency of 60 Hertz or 60 cycles per second. Variable <b>frequency</b> <b>drives</b> are able to decrease the output and energy consumption of motors by lowering the frequency of the electricity provided to the motor, however the relationship between motor output and energy consumption is not a linear one. If the variable <b>frequency</b> <b>drive</b> provides electricity to the motor at 30 Hertz, the output of the motor will be 50% because 30 Hertz divided by 60 Hertz is 0.5 or 50%. The energy consumption of a motor running at 50% or 30 Hertz will not be 50%, but will instead be something like 18% because the relationship between motor output and energy consumption are not linear. The exact ratios of motor output or Hertz provided to the motor (which are effectively the same thing), and the actual energy consumption of the variable <b>frequency</b> <b>drive</b> / motor combination depend on the efficiency of the variable <b>frequency</b> <b>drive.</b> For example, because the variable <b>frequency</b> <b>drive</b> needs power itself to communicate with the building automation system, run its cooling fan, etc., if the motor always ran at 100% with the variable <b>frequency</b> <b>drive</b> installed the cost of operation or electricity consumption would actually go up with the new variable <b>frequency</b> <b>drive</b> installed. The amount of energy that variable <b>frequency</b> <b>drives</b> consume is nominal and is hardly worth consideration when calculating savings, however it did need to be noted that VFD's do consume energy themselves. Because the variable <b>frequency</b> <b>drives</b> rarely ever run at 100% and {{spend most of their time}} in the 40% output range, and because now the pumps completely shut down when not needed, the variable <b>frequency</b> <b>drives</b> have reduced the energy consumption of the pumps to around 15% of what they had been using before.|$|R

40|$|In the {{presence}} of random hyperfine fields, the noise spectrum, δ s_ω^ 2, of a spin ensemble represents a narrow peak centered at ω = 0 and a broad "wing" reflecting {{the distribution of the}} hyperfine fields. In {{the presence}} of an ac drive, the dynamics of a single spin acquires additional harmonics at frequencies determined by both, the <b>drive</b> <b>frequency</b> and the local field. These harmonics are reflected as additional peaks in the noise spectrum. We study how the ensemble-averaged δ s_ω^ 2 evolves with the drive amplitude, ω_dr (in the frequency units). Our main finding is that additional peaks in the spectrum, caused by the drive, remain sharp even when ω_dr is much smaller than the typical hyperfine field. The reason is that the drive affects only the spins for which the local Larmour frequency is close to the <b>drive</b> <b>frequency.</b> The shape of the low-frequency "Rabi"-peak in δ s_ω^ 2 is universal with both, the position and the width, being of the order of ω_dr.
