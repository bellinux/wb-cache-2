50|$|<b>Felbamate</b> (marketed {{under the}} brand name Felbatol by MedPointe) is an {{anticonvulsant}} used {{in the treatment of}} epilepsy.

5000|$|Meprobamate's {{mechanism}} of action is not completely known. It {{has been shown in}} animal studies to have effects at multiple sites in the central nervous system, including the thalamus and limbic system. Meprobamate binds to GABAA receptors which interrupts neuronal communication in the reticular formation and spinal cord, causing sedation and altered perception of pain. It has been shown that meprobamate has the ability to activate currents {{even in the absence of}} GABA. [...] This relatively unique property makes meprobamate exceptionally dangerous when used in combination with other GABA-mediated drugs (including alcohol). It is also a potent adenosine reuptake inhibitor (AdoRI), which is most likely responsible for its lesser degree of sedation compared to barbiturates.Related drugs include carisoprodol and tybamate (prodrugs of meprobamate), <b>felbamate,</b> mebutamate, and methocarbamol.|$|E
40|$|The {{transfer}} of tolerance between drugs may indicate a common mode of action. The development of cross-tolerance to the anticonvulsant effect of <b>felbamate</b> after long-term treatment of mice with diazepam, a positive modulator of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) -mediated transmission, was therefore studied {{in order to}} clarify the mechanism of this action of <b>felbamate.</b> A challenge injection of <b>felbamate,</b> administered 36 h after the last dose of chronic diazepam treatment, antagonized convulsions elicited by administration of isoniazid.

40|$|Background and Purpose: <b>Felbamate</b> {{is a new}} dicarbamate {{anticonvulsant}} {{with low}} toxicity currently being investigated in human clinical epilepsy trials. In this study, we examined the protective effects of <b>felbamate</b> against hypoxia. Methods: We exposed paired rat hippocampal slices to hypoxia with and without <b>felbamate</b> treatment while monitoring the CAl-evoked population spike. Results: <b>Felbamate</b> provided dose-dependent neuroprotection against hypoxia at concentrations of 45 mg/l and greater (p< 0. 05). At a <b>felbamate</b> concentration of 300 mg/ 1, recovery of CA 1 evoked population spike amplitude after hypoxic exposure was 99 % compared with 0. 5 % for unmedicated paired slices.

In Study II, 18 other volunteers were administered oral <b>felbamate</b> 1200 mg every 12 h for two 8 day periods with vigabatrin 1000 mg every 12 h or placebo. On the eighth day of each treatment period, blood and urine samples were collected over 12 h for determination of the active S(+) - and inactive R(-) -vigabatrin enantiomer concentrations (Study I) or <b>felbamate</b> concentrations (Study II). In Study I, the pharmacokinetic parameters of R(-) -vigabatrin were similar during co-administration with <b>felbamate</b> or placebo. <b>Felbamate</b> produced a 13 % increase in AUC(0, 12 h) and an 8 % increase in urinary excretion of S(+) -vigabatrin.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To review our {{experience}} of the efficacy and tolerability of <b>felbamate</b> in children younger than 4 years. METHODS: We used a retrospective chart review to identify 53 children with seizures who were younger than 4 years. Efficacy was evaluated based on the occurrence of responsiveness, defined as seizure frequency reduction of more than 50 % for a minimum period of 4 months. Tolerability was based on parent-reported side effects. RESULTS: Twenty-two (41 %) patients resulted to be responders and 31 (59 %) did not. By univariate analysis, those achieving seizure remission were probably much older, to have a shorter history of epilepsy and a lower frequency of seizures before <b>felbamate</b> therapy. The number of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) used before <b>felbamate</b> therapy was the only significant predictor of the duration of response to <b>felbamate,</b> with a longer responsiveness to the drug seen in those who were placed under fewer than three AEDs before <b>felbamate</b> compared with those who had taken more than three (median, 16 months vs. 7 months; P < 0. 0084). Side effects occurred in 30 % of the subjects, but these did not require discontinuation of the drug. DISCUSSION: <b>Felbamate</b> is an effective medication {{for a wide range}} of epilepsy syndromes in children younger than 4 years.
