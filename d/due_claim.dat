40|$|The {{right to}} {{initiate}} enforcement measures {{belongs to the}} creditor, unless otherwise provided by law, who nevertheless cannot proceed in this respect unless it meets procedural requirements expressly regulated by the lawmaker. The procedural formalities required to initiate the enforcement measures are {{the existence of an}} unquestionable and <b>due</b> <b>claim,</b> the submission of a request for enforcement to the competent bailiff, obtaining the permission for enforcement from the enforcement court and the preliminary notification of the debtor. The initiation of enforcement measures in the regulation brought by the new Civil Procedure Code seems a complex activity of a mixed nature, which has both a jurisdictional side, represented by the activity of the court of law, and an administrative side, consisting in the enforcement activity of the bailiff. </p...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} two decades, the LGBT {{movement}} has gained momentum that is arguably unprecedented in speed and suddenness {{when compared to other}} human rights movements. This book investigates the recent history of this transnational movement in Europe, focusing on the diffusion of the norms it champions and the overarching question of why, despite similar international pressures, the trajectories of socio-legal recognition for LGBT minorities are so different across states. The book makes the case that a politics of visibility has engendered the interactions between movements and states that empower marginalized people - mobilizing actors to demand change, influencing the spread of new legal standards, and weaving new ideas into the fabrics of societies. It documents how this process of 'coming out' empowers marginalized social groups by moving them to the center of political debate and public recognition and making it possible for them to obtain rights to which they have <b>due</b> <b>claim.</b> [...] List of figures [...] List of tables [...] Preface and acknowledgments [...] List of abbreviations [...] 1 Introduction [...] 2 The politics of visibility and LGBT rights in Europe [...] 3 Transnational movement: Opportunities, actors, and mechanisms [...] 4 Complying with new norms: LGBT rights legislation [...] 5 Internalizing new norms: Attitudes toward sexual minorities [...] 6 Poland and Slovenia's responses to international norms [...] 7 Visibility in movement and transnational politics [...] Methodological appendix [...] References [...] Inde...|$|E

5000|$|The {{court ruled}} that the federal {{government}} is unlikely to succeed on the merits against Washington's <b>due</b> process <b>claim.</b> Though the court discussed Washington State's contention that the executive order violates the First Amendment prohibition on religious discrimination, they withheld ruling on that claim, as being unlikely to succeed against a <b>due</b> process <b>claim</b> is sufficient to fail the first question. The federal government did not provide evidence or argument as to why the executive order needed to be enacted immediately and thus a stay required. In showing the federal government was unlikely to succeed on the merits against a <b>due</b> process <b>claim,</b> the court argued that it showed the States and their citizens would be irreparably harmed by a stay as [...] "the deprivation of constitutional rights 'unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.'"
