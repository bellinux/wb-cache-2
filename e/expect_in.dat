25|$|The Meissner {{effect is}} {{sometimes}} {{confused with the}} kind of diamagnetism one would <b>expect</b> <b>in</b> a perfect electrical conductor: according to Lenz's law, when a changing magnetic field is applied to a conductor, it will induce an electric current in the conductor that creates an opposing magnetic field. In a perfect conductor, an arbitrarily large current can be induced, and the resulting magnetic field exactly cancels the applied field.|$|E

25|$|Greys are {{typically}} depicted as dark grey-skinned diminutive humanoid beings that possess reduced forms of, or completely lack, external human organs such as noses, ears or sex organs. Their bodies are usually depicted as being elongated, having a small chest, {{and lacking in}} muscular definition and visible skeletal structure. Their legs are shorter and jointed differently from what one would <b>expect</b> <b>in</b> a human. Their limbs are often depicted as proportionally different from a human's; their humerus and thighs are the same lengths as their forearms and shins, respectively.|$|E
25|$|Unlike in burlesque theater, {{the modern}} popular form of strip theater can {{minimize}} {{the interaction of}} customer and dancer, reducing the importance of tease in the performance in favor of speed to undress. Most clubs have a dancer rotation where each dancer in turn will perform for one or more songs in a fixed sequence which repeats during a shift. Less formal clubs will have dancers take turns when a stage becomes empty or have a free flow of entertainers where the stage has any number of entertainers who wander off and on at will. Featured entertainers are not usually part of the rotation and they generally have set times when they will perform that are advertised throughout the shift. If a DJ is present, {{he or she will}} emcee the rotation and typically announce the current dancer(s) on stage and possibly whom to <b>expect</b> <b>in</b> future sets.|$|E

25|$|Assuming that {{a problem}} exists, many have offered {{suggestions}} for narrowing the gap and correcting the problems arising from it. In general, those suggestions are along three lines. The first is that the military must {{reach out to the}} civilian world. Given the essentially universal agreement that civilians must control the military, the duty falls upon the military to find ways to talk to civilians, not the other way around. The second is that civilians must articulate a clear vision of what they <b>expect</b> <b>in</b> terms of the military mission. And the final suggestion is that the most practical and effective means of bringing about dialogue and understanding is to be bilateral education, in which both military and civilian elites would jointly attend specialized schools. Such schooling would emphasize military-strategic thinking, American history and political philosophy, military ethics, and the proper relationship between civil and military authority.|$|E
25|$|Goscelin's Vita St Mildrithae, {{written at}} St Augustine's Abbey, Canterbury some time between 1089 and 1099, {{followed}} {{the translation of}} Mildrith's relics from Thanet to Canterbury in 1030. Thanet had been attacked by Danes {{on a number of}} occasions in the 9th and 10th centuries, and the Abbey was finally abandoned in 1011AD. (In 1091 they were translated to the newly built chapel of the Holy Innocents.) Goscelin's account attempts to create a more conventional 'life of the saint' than the earlier texts, but the source material imposes a much more detailed genealogy, Abbey foundation story and explanation of the saint's mother than most such hagiographies would <b>expect.</b> <b>In</b> a number of places Goscelin meets the expectations of his own times in claiming the involvement of Archbishop Theodore where other texts suggest Domne Eafe acted on her own authority, such as the dedication of the Minster, and permission for Mildrith to succeed her as Abbess.).|$|E
25|$|Falk et al. (2007) offered further {{evidence}} that the claims of a microcephalic H.sapiens were not credible. Virtual endocasts of an additional nine microcephalic brains and ten normal human brains were examined, and {{it was found that}} the floresiensis skulls are similar in shape to normal human brains, yet have unique features which are consistent with what one would <b>expect</b> <b>in</b> a new species. The frontal and temporal lobes of the floresiensis brain were found to be highly developed, in strong contrast to the microcephalic brain, and advanced in ways different from modern human brains. This finding also answered past criticisms that the floresiensis brain was simply too small to be capable of the intelligence required for the members of H.floresiensis to create the tools found in their proximity. Falk et al. (2007) conclude that the onus is now upon the critics that continue to claim microcephaly to produce a brain of a microcephalic that bears resemblance to the floresiensis brain.|$|E

500|$|Yeats {{was close}} to Lady Gregory and her home place of Coole Park, Co, Galway. He would often visit and stay there {{as it was a}} central meeting place for people who {{supported}} the resurgence of Irish literature and cultural traditions. His poem, [...] "The Wild Swans at Coole" [...] was written there, between 1916 and 1917. He collaborated with Lady Gregory on a book of Irish mythology, writing the preface. [...] "One must not <b>expect</b> <b>in</b> these stories the epic lineaments, the many incidents, woven into one great event of, let us say the War for the Brown Bull of Cuailgne, or that of the last gathering at Muirthemne." ...|$|E
500|$|Spanish comics {{have been}} {{described}} as less conventional and more diverse than American comics. Anarcoma, by creator , is a [...] "bizarre noir thriller" [...] starring a gay transvestite detective. Anarcoma has been [...] "widely celebrated" [...] as one of the foremost subversive and countercultural comics that challenges preconceptions of sexuality and gender. Luque is openly gay and also writes the underground comic El Vibora. However, Gema PÃ©rez-SÃ¡nchez says that the subversive impact of underground comics is less than one might <b>expect,</b> <b>in</b> comparison to mainstream and government-subsidised comics, as the readers of underground comics are unlikely to be shocked. The [...] "veiled" [...] queer content that appears in the Socialist government-sanctioned Madriz has a greater impact.|$|E

There is a possibility of an electron at A, or a photon at B, moving as a basic action to any other place and time in the universe. That includes places that could only be reached at speeds greater than that of light and also earlier times.

500|$|While {{there are}} certain aspects readers can almost always <b>expect</b> <b>in</b> GarcÃ­a MÃ¡rquez's writing, like {{instances}} of humour, he did not stick to any clear and predetermined style template. In an interview with Marlise Simons, GarcÃ­a MÃ¡rquez noted:In every book I {{try to make a}} different path [...] One doesn't choose the style. You can investigate and try to discover what the best style would be for a theme. But the style is determined by the subject, by the mood of the times. If you try to use something that is not suitable, it just won't work. Then the critics build theories around that and they see things I hadn't seen. I only respond to our way of life, the life of the Caribbean.|$|E
500|$|The {{supporting}} cast also received praise. Roger Ebert reflected that Skyfall [...] "at last provides a role worthy of Judi Dench, {{one of the}} best actors of her generation. She is all but the co-star of the film, with a lot of screen time, poignant dialogue, and a character who is far more complex and sympathetic than we <b>expect</b> <b>in</b> this series". Jenny McCartney, writing in The Sunday Telegraph, agreed, describing Dench as [...] "compellingly luminous" [...] in the film, and the one that [...] "the camera caresses most meaningfully and often". McCartney thought Javier Bardem played Silva [...] "with worrisome Ã©lan", while Henry K Miller considered his character [...] "the most authentically Bondian Bond villain in decades". A number of critics noted the strength of the {{supporting cast}}; Kim Newman found the [...] "warmth and gravitas" [...] of Finney's performance noteworthy, while other reviewers, including Edward Porter, Daniel Krupa and The Playlists Oliver Lyttelton, singled out Ralph Fiennes as Mallory and Ben Whishaw as Q.|$|E
500|$|M. Daphne Kutzer, Professor of English at the State University of New York at Plattsburgh {{and author}} of Beatrix Potter: Writing in Code (2003), {{points out that the}} tale is a comic one taking place {{completely}} indoors and one with an obvious anxiety about dirt. There is not the sort of revelry one would <b>expect</b> <b>in</b> a tale about a miniature household but rather a [...] "desperate sense" [...] of wanting to keep that household free of invaders and unwanted outsiders. The Tale of Two Bad Mice is another tale about a miniature household, but there Potter {{is on the side of}} the invading two bad mice. Mrs. Tittlemouse is concerned as much about middle class proprieties as the dolls Lucinda and Jane in The Tale of Two Bad Mice but, in Mrs. Tittlemouse, Potter is on the side of the invaded rather than the invaders, who are purely animals with no human characteristics.|$|E
