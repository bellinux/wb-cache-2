However, prison records in different U.S. cities have shown that he was incarcerated on numerous occasions for charges of armed robbery. In a 2008 interview with CNN, Jerry Ray, the younger brother of James Earl Ray, claimed that James was smart and was sometimes able to get away with armed robbery. Jerry Ray said that he had assisted his brother on one such robbery. [...] "I never been with nobody as bold as he is," [...] Jerry said.

500|$|In December 1994, the Spice Girls persuaded {{their former}} managers—father-and-son team Bob and Chris Herbert—to {{set up a}} {{showcase}} in front of industry writers, producers and A men at the Nomis Studios in Shepherd's Bush, London. Among the attendees was BMG Publishing's Mark Fox, former percussionist of new wave '80s band, Haircut One Hundred. Since the showcase, Fox was unofficially helping the group to get contacts in the business. In May 1995, he introduced the group to Paul Wilson and Andy Watkins—the songwriters and production duo known as Absolute. Fox phoned the duo and told them: [...] "You won't believe it, but I've got your act. They've <b>just</b> <b>walked</b> <b>in</b> the door. They're beautiful, everything you've been looking for. I'll bring them down straight away." ...|$|E
500|$|From the start, Wilson {{envisioned a}} theremin for the track. AllMusic {{reviewer}} John Bush pointed out: [...] "Radio listeners could easily {{pick up the}} link between the title and the obviously electronic riffs sounding in the background of the chorus, but Wilson's use of the theremin added another delicious parallel—between the single's theme and its use of an instrument the player never even touched." [...] "Good Vibrations" [...] does not technically feature a theremin, but rather an Electro-Theremin, which is physically controlled by a knob {{on the side of the}} instrument. It was dubbed a [...] "theremin" [...] simply for convenience. At that time, theremins were most often associated with the 1945 Alfred Hitchcock film Spellbound, but its most common presence was in the theme music for the television sitcom My Favorite Martian, which ran from 1963 to 1966. Britz speculates: [...] "He <b>just</b> <b>walked</b> <b>in</b> and said, 'I have this new sound for you.' I think he must have heard the sound somewhere and loved it, and built a song around it." ...|$|E

500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began in}} July 2006 in New York City. American Gangster was filmed {{over a period}} of approximately four months in over 180 different locations, most of them across New York; it set the record for containing the highest number of filming locations of a movie. Two months were spent in New York, with all the city's five boroughs being used. Approximately fifty to sixty locations were set in Harlem alone. While in the neighbourhood, Scott stated that he found several interiors that had been untouched since the 1940s. According to production designer Arthur Max, exhaustive location scouting was done to find parts of New York that could still resemble the city of the early 1970s, filming Lucas' headquarters at 116th Street 20 blocks north, on 136th Street. In his interview with ComingSoon.net, Scott stated that [...] " [...] <b>just</b> <b>walked</b> <b>in</b> [...] and [...] just shot in the house." [...] Several gas masks were brought by producers due to health hazards and sanitary concerns existing in the buildings. Scott found filming in Harlem to be difficult, commenting that the rapid gentrification in Harlem provided poor opportunities for shooting angles. Hand-held cameras were extensively used to depict a [...] "guerrilla filmmaking" [...] style.|$|E

2500|$|The Valentine’s Eve Massacre {{happened}} {{on the south side}} of Montreal, in Hotel Lapiniere on February 13, 1975, which was a hangout of the McSween gang. It happened when three men walked into the packed bar during a country-music show and opened fire killing four men and injuring five others. Three of the people killed had no association with either gangs and according to Pierre McSween he did not consider them [...] "cool" [...] killers because they <b>just</b> <b>walked</b> <b>in</b> and sprayed the place instead of walking up to the person they wished to execute and shooting them in the back of the head so no one else would get hurt. The target that evening was Roger [...] "Birdie" [...] Letourneau who was a former member of the gang before the Dubois Brothers took over. The men behind the shooting, according to McSween were Roger Fontaine, Claude Dubois, and Claude Lebeau who were carrying M-1 Semi-automatic rifles. After the Dubois Brothers had taken over the McSween territory they focused on taking over the downtown area.|$|E

50|$|Kershisnik's work deals {{mainly with}} the human figure, less as a {{specific}} portrait, but rather as an archetype.

Kershisnik's favorite themes tend to deal with family life and personal relationships. Though not overtly religious, some of his works have dealt with religious themes especially as they intersect family and personal relationships.|$|E
