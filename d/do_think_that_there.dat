500|$|In {{the first}} half of the 1880s, Stanford collaborated with the author Gilbert à Beckett on two operas, Savonarola, and The Canterbury Pilgrims. The former was well {{received}} at its premiere in Hamburg in April 1884, but received a critical savaging when staged at Covent Garden in July of the same year. Parry commented privately, [...] "It seems very badly constructed for the stage, poorly conceived and the music, though clean and well-managed, is not striking or dramatic." [...] The most severe public criticism was in The Theatre, whose reviewer wrote, [...] "The book of Savonarola is dull, stilted, and, from a dramatic point of view, weak. It is not, however, so crushingly tiresome as the music fitted to it. Savonarola has gone far to convince me that opera is quite out of [...] line and that the sooner he abandons the stage for the cathedral, the better for his musical reputation." [...] The Canterbury Pilgrims had been premiered in London in April 1884, three months before Savonarola was presented at Covent Garden. It had a better reception than the latter, though reviews pointed out Stanford's debt to Die Meistersinger, and complained of a lack of emotion in the love music. George Grove agreed with the critics, writing to Parry, [...] "Charlie's music contains everything but sentiment. Love not at all – that I heard not a grain of. ... And I <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> might be more tune. Melody is not a thing to be avoided surely." [...] In 1896 a critic wrote that the opera had [...] "just such a 'book' as would have suited the late Alfred Cellier. He would probably have made of it a charming light English opera. But Dr. Stanford has chosen to use it for the exemplification of those advanced theories which we know him to hold, and he has given us music which would incline us to think that Die Meistersinger had been his model. The effect of the combination is not happy." ...|$|E

"I don't {{think that}} is much to put up with, captain," [...] Patsey said with a smile, [...] "if he always cooks for you such breakfasts and dinners as we have had today; and I <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is, perhaps, {{something}} in what he says about rough hands." ...|$|E

The peasants {{know that we are}} but a company. They may send to all the villages round and call on them to come and revenge those who have been slain. The people of the hills are strong fellows--wood cutters, charcoal burners, and shepherds--and {{there can be no doubt}} that they suffer terribly from the enormous taxation. I have seen it on my own estate in Poitou, and can make every allowance for them. In many cases the amounts they are adjudged to pay are absolutely greater than their whole income. They are forced to live upon bread made of bran and sawdust, to eat acorns and beechnuts; they are gaunt with hunger; they see their children dying before their eyes. They know not how their sufferings arise, they only know that they suffer, and in their despair they turn like hungry wolves against all who are better off than themselves." ...|$|E

In that documentary Liddle asked Atkins: [...] "Give me your views on the existence, or otherwise, of god". Atkins replied: [...] "Well it's fairly straightforward: there isn't one. And there's no evidence for one, {{no reason to believe}} that there is one, and so I don't believe that there is one. And I think that it is rather foolish that people <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is one".|$|E

Though they admitted the possibility of a coup they also kept working as if it were not going to happen. They even looked at it with some optimism, as if its main victim were the bureaucracy in the government, and not us. We didn't make any plans against the coup. In August 1975 Pancho Lieutenant Carlos Lebrón and I started to work on a possible response to the coup: most of all, a military response that would hold back the initial deployment, the first 48 hours. It wasn't about stopping the coup but rather about making it start wrong, with an unforeseen cost. When we spoke to Petrus Campiglia about it, he said to us: [...] "But then you <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is in fact going to be a coup. That changes everything." ...|$|E

40|$|Why atheists <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is no {{evidence}} for God. It {{may be the case}} that there is really {{no evidence}}. Or, it may be that there is, but atheists do not pay any heed to them. I will show here that the second statement is true, not the first one. For doing this I will follow the same path that atheists have followed. From a simple statement of theists that God is good they have concluded that God does not exist. Now we will find out what other statements have been made about this God, and we will also see what conclusions can be drawn about the universe from those statements about God. Further, it is pointed that that Buddhism is not an atheistic religion...|$|E
40|$|In "Evil and the Justice of God", N. T. Wright {{presses the}} point that {{attempting}} to solve the philosophical problem of evil is an immature response {{to the existence of}} evil [...] a response that belittles the real problem of evil, which is just the fact that evil is bad and needs to be dealt with. As you might expect, I am not inclined to endorse this sort of sweeping indictment of the entire field of research on the philosophical problem of evil. (I sort of doubt that Wright really meant to either.) But I <b>do</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is a kernel of truth in what I take to be Wright's fundamental objection to attempts to solve the philosophical problem of evil. In the first section of what follows, I will try briefly to explain why. I will then go on to argue that, despite this fact, certain efforts at solving the problem of evil avoid Wright's objection. Indeed, drawing on recent work by Elenore Stump, I will argue that one perfectly legitimate way to try to solve the philosophical problem of evil is to follow precisely {{what seems to be the}} main piece of advice in "Evil and the Justice of God": namely, to look more seriously than we have at the attitudes taken toward evil by human authors of and characters in the Bible, and to attend more carefully to what the Bible says about how God deals with evil...|$|E
