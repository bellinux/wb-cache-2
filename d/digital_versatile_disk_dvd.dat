40|$|The {{use of the}} USB storage device, {{also known}} as the USB drive, a thumb drive, a keychain drive and a flash drive has, for the most part, {{replaced}} the floppy disk and to some extent the Compact Disk (CD), the DVD (Digital Video <b>Disk</b> or <b>Digital</b> <b>Versatile</b> <b>Disk)</b> and the external hard disk. Their robustness, size and weight make them easy to transport, but also to lose or misplace. They are inexpensive and are often given away as promotional items by organisations.

40|$|An {{international}} standard has emerged {{for the first}} true multimedia format. <b>Digital</b> <b>Versatile</b> <b>Disk</b> (by its official name), you may know it as Digital Video Disks. DVD has applications in movies, music, games, information CD-ROMS, and many other areas where massive amounts of digital information is needed. Did I say massive amounts of data? Would you believe over 17 gigabytes on {{a single piece of}} plastic the size of an audio-CD? That`s the promise, at least, by the group of nine electronics manufacturers who have agreed to the format specification, and who hope to make this goal a reality by 1998. In this major agreement, which didn`t come easily, the manufacturers will combine Sony and Phillip`s one side double-layer NMCD format with Toshiba and Matsushita`s double sided Super-Density disk. By Spring of this year, they plan to market the first 4. 7 gigabyte units. The question is: Will DVD take off? Some believe that read-only disks recorded with movies will be about as popular as video laser disks. They say that until the eraseable/writable DVD arrives, the consumer will most likely not buy it. Also, DVD has a good market for replacement of CD- Roms. Back in the early 80 `s, the international committee deciding the format of the audio compact disk decided its length would be 73 minutes. This, they declared, would allow Beethoven`s 9 th Symphony to be contained entirely on a single CD. Similarly, today it was agreed that playback length of a single sided, single layer DVD would be 133 minutes, long enough to hold 94 % of all feature-length movies. Further, audio can be in Dolby`s AC- 3 stereo or 5. 1 tracks of surround sound, better than CD-quality audio (16 -bits at 48 kHz). In addition, there are three to five language tracks, copy protection and parental ``locks`` for R rated movies. DVD will be backwards compatible with current CD-ROM and audio CD formats. Added versatility comes by way of multiple aspect rations: 4 : 3 pan-scan, 4 : 3 letterbox, and 16 : 9 widescreen. MPEG- 2 is the selected image compression format, with full ITU Rec. 601 video resolution (72 Ox 480). MPEG- 2 and AC- 3 are also part of the U. S. high definition Advance Television standard (ATV). DVD has an average video bit rate of 3. 5 Mbits/sec or 4. 69 Mbits/sec for image and sound. Unlike digital television transmission, which will use fixed length packets for audio and video, DVD will use variable length packets with a maximum throughput of more than 1 OMbits/sec. The higher bit rate allows for less compression of difficult to encode material. Even with all the compression, narrow-beam red light lasers are required to significantly increase the physical data density of a platter by decreasing the size of the pits. This allows 4. 7 gigabytes of data on a single sided, single layer DVD. The maximum 17 gigabyte capacity is achieved by employing two reflective layers {{on both sides of the}} disk. To read the imbedded layer of data, the laser`s focal length is altered so that the top layer pits are not picked up by the reader. It will be a couple of years before we have dual-layer, double-sided DVDS, and it will be achieved in four stages. The first format to appear will be the single sided, single layer disk (4. 7 gigabytes). That will allow Hollywood to begin releasing DVD movie titles. DVD-ROM will be the next phase, allowing 4. 7 gigabytes of CD-ROM-like content. The third stage will be write-once disks, and stage four will be rewritable disks. These last stages presents some issues which have yet to be resolved. For one, copyrighted materials may have some form of payment system, and there is the issue that erasable disks reflect less light than today`s DVDS. The problem here is that their data most likely will not be readable on earlier built players...|$|R

40|$|Phase change materials, {{typically}} composed out of Ge, Sb and Te alloys, are {{materials that}} can switch very fast between two stable states, the amorphous and the crystalline phase. The optical contrast {{of the two}} stable phases led to the application in optical data storage such as compact <b>disks</b> (CD), <b>digital</b> <b>versatile</b> <b>disks</b> (DVD) and Bluray disk. Due to the pronounced contrast in resistivity between the amorphous and the crystalline phase, phase change materials {{can also be used}} in electrical data storage devices. Since the two phases are stable at moderate temperatures, phase change memory is non-volatile, i. e. it does not need a power supply to sustain the information. Additionally, phase change memory is faster than the well-established Flash memory and exhibits a better cyclability and scalability. Therefore, phase change memory {{has become one of the}} most promising candidates for future non-volatile memory applications and also a candidate to bridge the gap between fast dynamic random access memory (DRAM) and slow non-volatile memory types. A precondition for fast switching from the low conductive amorphous phase into the high conductive crystalline phase is a phenomenon called threshold switching. At a characteristic threshold field the amorphous phase becomes highly conductive entering the so called amorphous on-state. Once the phase change memory is in the high conductive amorphous on-state, a high current can flow which enables Joule heating and therefore the phase transition. In fast memory applications like DRAM, threshold switching and the transient dynamics of the amorphous on-state are very important but poorly understood at the present time. Therefore, in this work the switching behavior of phase change materials and the dynamics of the amorphous phase have been studied. Phase change bridge devices of various width and length have been produced using several phase change materials as the active component. A very fast switching material, Ge 15 Sb 85, has been found to switch within 10 ns. The pronounced differences (e. g. in crystallization temperature and crystallization speed) between the amorphous-as-deposited and amorphous-as-melt-quenched phases have been studied and explained with a difference in geometry of the environment of the active area. No evidence for an intrinsic difference has been found leading to the conclusion that it is adequate to study intrinsic properties of the amorphous-as-deposited phase which is much easier to obtain especially in thin film experiments. Furthermore, threshold switching in various phase change materials has been studied experimentally and linked to a generation-recombination statistics model in a multiple band transport picture. The simulations could reproduce all features observed in the experiment, and it was found that the threshold switching field varies strongly between different phase change materials which was linked to the difference in bandgap and defect states. Another requirement for a memory technology to succeed in the market is the potential to store multiple bits in a single memory cell (multi level storage). Thus, different states of resistance need to be stored in a phase change memory cell for multi level storage, which is achieved by producing amorphous marks of different size. Phase change materials are facing a challenge in this approach because of the resistance drift phenomenon. The resistivity at room temperature in the amorphous phase is increasing with time which would cause a memory cell drifting from one state into another. Therefore, it is important to achieve a better understanding of the amorphous phase to prevent resistance drift or at least describe it so that it can be handled in memory cells. For this reason, in this work the temperature dependence of several transport properties such as conductivity, field effect mobility and Seebeck coefficient has been studied. Based on optical absorption experiments a model of the density of states for the amorphous phase was developed. Considering hopping in localized states and transport in extended states, the experimentally observed transport properties were modeled. It is shown that band transport is predominant and that the resistance drift phenomenon can be explained by an increase of the bandgap. This result was confirmed by the absorption measurements...|$|R
