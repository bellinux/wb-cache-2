2500|$|Tractors {{and heavy}} {{equipment}} were often multifuel in the 1920s through 1940s, running spark-ignition and low-compression engines. Thus many farm tractors {{of the era}} could burn gasoline, alcohol, kerosene, and any light grade of <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> such as diesel <b>fuel,</b> heating <b>oil,</b> or tractor vaporising oil, according to whichever was most affordable in any region at any given time. On U.S. farms during this era, the name [...] "distillate" [...] often referred {{to any of the}} aforementioned light <b>fuel</b> <b>oils.</b> The <b>engines</b> did not start as well on distillate, so typically a small auxiliary gasoline tank was used for cold starting, and the fuel valves were adjusted several minutes later, after warm-up, to switch to distillate. Engine accessories such as vaporizers and radiator shrouds were also used, both with the aim of capturing heat, because when such an engine was run on distillate, it ran better when both it and the air it inhaled were warmer rather than at ambient temperature. Dieselization with dedicated diesel engines (high-compression with mechanical fuel injection and compression ignition) replaced such systems and made more efficient use of the diesel fuel being burned.|$|R

There are so many accidents in sea transportation in Indonesia, especially in 2005 - 2010 is due to human errors and only a few caused by natural factors and others. Most of the accidents occur due to the low awareness of the aspects of security and safety. Equipment’s and system on board ship, will not remain safe or reliable if they are not maintained.

40|$|A {{study was}} {{performed}} on twenty Class- 8 trucks paired by make, model, mileage, and drive cycles. Ten trucks were operated using # 2 Ultra-Low Sulfur Diesel and ten using a 20 % soy methyl ester blend (B 20). All trucks were equipped with data collection units that monitored engine information including fuel consumption, idle time, truck speed, engine load, and engine speed. Data collection occurred over a continuous span of twelve months. In addition to operating data, laboratory-based <b>fuel</b> and <b>engine</b> <b>oil</b> testing was performed to quantify the analytical {{differences between the two}} fuel types. Cetane number, energy content, density, kinematic viscosity, and lubricity was measured for both fuels and at every <b>oil</b> service interval <b>engine</b> <b>oil</b> samples were evaluated based on fuel dilution, soot content, wear metals, contaminant metals, viscosity, oxidation, and acid/base number. Operational and maintenance issues such as cold start reliability, fuel filter service intervals, and general engine maintenance was also analyzed for each fleet. Statistical analysis was performed to determine significant differences in the performance of engines on # 2 ULSD and B 20 fuels. At the conclusion of the study minimal differences were found with most comparisons, the exceptions primarily found in differences between the <b>engine</b> <b>oil</b> samples based on the two fuel types used in the study. These differences included viscosity, acid/base number, oxidation, and lead wear which indicated slightly higher oil degradation levels with B 20 use. ^ Key Words: Biodiesel, Biofuel, B 20, Fleet, Diesel, Renewable Fuel, Alternative Fuel, Class 8 Truck, <b>Fuel</b> Economy, <b>Oil</b> Analysis, Filter Plugging. ...|$|R
