5|$|Holliday's {{original}} model {{assumed that}} <b>heteroduplex</b> DNA would be present on both chromosomes, but experimental data on yeast refuted this. An updated model by Matt Meselson and Charley Radding in 1975 introduced {{the idea of}} branch migration. Further observations in the 1980s led to the proposal of alternate mechanisms for recombination such as the double-strand break model (by Jack Szostak, Frank Stahl, and others) and the single-strand annealing model. A third, the synthesis-dependent strand annealing model, did not involve Holliday junctions.|$|E
5|$|In the {{original}} Holliday model for homologous recombination, single-strand breaks {{occur at the}} same point on one strand of each parental DNA. Free ends of each broken strand then migrate across to the other DNA helix. There, the invading strands are joined to the free ends they encounter, resulting in the Holliday junction. As each crossover strand reanneals to its original partner strand, it displaces {{the original}} complementary strand ahead of it. This causes the Holliday junction to migrate, creating the <b>heteroduplex</b> segments. Depending on which strand was used as a template to repair the other, the four cells resulting from meiosis might end up with three copies of one allele and only one of the other, instead of the normal two of each, a property known as gene conversion.|$|E
500|$|Robin Holliday {{proposed}} the junction structure that now {{bears his name}} {{as part of his}} model of homologous recombination in 1964, based on his research on the organisms Ustilago maydis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The model provided a molecular mechanism that explained both gene conversion and chromosomal crossover. Holliday realized that the proposed pathway would create [...] <b>heteroduplex</b> DNA segments with base mismatches between different versions of a single gene. He predicted that the cell would have a mechanism for mismatch repair, which was later discovered. Prior to Holliday's model, the accepted model involved a copy-choice mechanism where the new strand is synthesized directly from parts of the different parent strands.|$|E
50|$|So when <b>heteroduplexes</b> are {{partially}} denatured by heating, negative charges undergo partial relocation and {{the interaction}} force between DNA <b>heteroduplexes</b> and column decreases {{in comparison to the}} strength of interaction of homoduplexes.

40|$|The {{invention}} provides {{methods for}} evolving a polynucleotide toward {{acquisition of a}} desired property. Such methods entail incubating a population of parental polynucleotide variants under conditions to generate annealed polynucleotides comprising <b>heteroduplexes.</b> The <b>heteroduplexes</b> are then exposed to a cellular DNA repair system to convert the <b>heteroduplexes</b> to parental polynucleotide variants or recombined polynucleotide variants.

40|$|Two {{methods were}} used {{in an attempt to}} {{increase}} the efficiency and strand selectivity of methyl-directed mismatch repair of bacteriophage λ <b>heteroduplexes</b> in E. coli. Previous studies of such repair used λ DNA that was only partially methylated as the source of methylated chains. Also, transfection was carried out in methylating strains. Either of these factors might have been responsible for the incompleteness of the strand selectivity observed previously. In the first approach to increasing strand selectivity, <b>heteroduplexes</b> were transfected into a host deficient in methylation, but no changes in repair frequencies were observed. In the second approach, <b>heteroduplexes</b> were prepared using DNA that had been highly methylated in vitro with purified DNA adenine methylase as the source of methylated chains. In <b>heteroduplexes</b> having a repairable cI/+ mismatch, strand selectivity was indeed enhanced. In <b>heteroduplexes</b> with one chain highly methylated and the complementary chain unmethylated, the frequency of repair on the unmethylated chain increased to nearly 100 %. <b>Heteroduplexes</b> with both chains highly methylated were not repaired at a detectable frequency. Thus, chains highly methylated by DNA adenine methylase were refractory to mismatch repair by this system, regardless of the methylation of the complementary chain. These results support the hypothesis that methyl-directed mismatch repair acts to correct errors of replication, thus lowering the mutation rate...|$|R
500|$|For a Morpholino to be effective, {{it must be}} {{delivered}} past the cell membrane into the cytosol of a cell. Once in the cytosol, Morpholinos freely diffuse between the cytosol and nucleus, {{as demonstrated by the}} nuclear splice-modifying activity of Morpholinos observed after microinjection into the cytosol of cells. [...] Different methods are used for delivery into embryos, into cultured cells or into adult animals. A microinjection apparatus is usually used for delivery into an embryo, with injections most commonly performed at the single-cell or few-cell stage; an alternative method for embryonic delivery is electroporation, which can deliver oligos into tissues of later embryonic stages. Common techniques for delivery into cultured cells include the Endo-Porter peptide (which causes the Morpholino to be released from endosomes), the Special Delivery system (no longer commercially available, used a Morpholino-DNA <b>heteroduplex</b> and an ethoxylated polyethylenimine delivery reagent), electroporation, or scrape loading.|$|E
2500|$|Non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) {{directly}} ligates DNA {{from either}} side of a double-strand break where there is very little or no sequence overlap for annealing. This repair mechanism induces errors in the genome via indels (insertion or deletion), or chromosomal rearrangement; any such errors may render the gene products coded at that location non-functional. [...] Because this activity can vary depending on the species, cell type, target gene, and nuclease used, it should be monitored when designing new systems. [...] A simple <b>heteroduplex</b> cleavage assay can be run which detects any difference between two alleles amplified by PCR. Cleavage products can be visualized on simple agarose gels or slab gel systems.|$|E
2500|$|As noted above, RNA {{polymerase}} makes {{contacts with}} the promoter region. [...] However these stabilizing contacts inhibit the enzyme's ability to access DNA further downstream and thus the synthesis of the full-length product. [...] Once the open complex is stabilized, RNA polymerase synthesizes an RNA strand to establish a DNA-RNA <b>heteroduplex</b> (~8-9 bp) at the active center, which stabilizes the elongation complex. [...] In order to accomplish RNA synthesis, RNA polymerase must maintain promoter contacts while unwinding more downstream DNA for synthesis, [...] "scrunching" [...] more downstream DNA into the initiation complex. During the promoter escape transition, RNA polymerase is considered a [...] "stressed intermediate." [...] Thermodynamically the stress accumulates from the DNA-unwinding and DNA-compaction activities. [...] Once the DNA-RNA <b>heteroduplex</b> is long enough, RNA polymerase releases its upstream contacts and effectively achieves the promoter escape transition into the elongation phase. However, promoter escape {{is not the only}} outcome. RNA polymerase can also relieve the stress by releasing its downstream contacts, arresting transcription. [...] The paused transcribing complex has two options: (1) release the nascent transcript and begin anew at the promoter or (2) reestablish a new 3'OH on the nascent transcript at the active site via RNA polymerase's catalytic activity and recommence DNA scrunching to achieve promoter escape. [...] Scientists have coined the term [...] "abortive initiation" [...] to explain the unproductive cycling of RNA polymerase before the promoter escape transition. [...] The extent of abortive initiation depends on the presence of transcription factors and the strength of the promoter contacts.|$|E
40|$|The methyl-directed DNA repair {{efficiency}} {{of a series}} of M 13 mp 9 frameshift <b>heteroduplexes</b> 1, 2, or 3 unpaired bases was determined by using an in vitro DNA mismatch repair assay. Repair of hemimethylated frameshift <b>heteroduplexes</b> in vitro was directed to the unmethylated strand; was dependent on MutH, MutL, and MutS; and was equally efficient on base insertions and deletions. However, fully methylated frameshift <b>heteroduplexes</b> were resistant to repair, while totally unmethylated substrates were repaired with no strand bias. Hemimethylated 1 -, 2 -, or 3 -base insertion and deletion <b>heteroduplexes</b> were repaired by the methyl-directed mismatch repair pathway as efficiently as the G. T mismatch. These results are consistent with earlier in vivo studies and demonstrate the involvement of methyl-directed DNA repair in the efficient prevention of frameshift mutations...|$|R

40|$|The {{repeated}} sequences in oats DNA {{have been}} used to study chromosomal repeated sequence organisation in wheat. Approximately 75 % of the wheat genome consists of repeated sequences but only approximately 20 % will form <b>heteroduplexes</b> with repeated sequences from oats DNA at 60 degrees C in 0. 18 M Na+. The proportion of wheat DNA that forms <b>heteroduplexes</b> with oats DNA is shown to be independent of the wheat DNA fragment length. However, the proportion of wheat DNA that is retained with the <b>heteroduplexes</b> when fractionated on hydroxyapatite is very dependent upon the wheat fragment length up to 3500 nucleotides. This is because more non-renatured wheat DNA is attached to the <b>heteroduplexes</b> with longer fragments. The results indicate that the repeated sequences in the wheat genome homologous to repeated sequences in oats are not clustered in the chromosomes but distributed amongst other repeated and possible non-repeated sequences...|$|R
2500|$|In 1985, Thomas Kunkel {{introduced}} {{a technique that}} reduces the need to select for the mutants. The DNA fragment to be mutated is inserted into a phagemid such as M13mp18/19 and is then transformed into an E. coli strain deficient in two enzymes, dUTPase (dut) and uracil deglycosidase (ung). Both enzymes {{are part of a}} DNA repair pathway that protects the bacterial chromosome from mutations by the spontaneous deamination of dCTP to dUTP. The dUTPase deficiency prevents the breakdown of dUTP, resulting in a high level of dUTP in the cell. The uracil deglycosidase deficiency prevents the removal of uracil from newly synthesized DNA. As the double-mutant E. coli replicates the phage DNA, its enzymatic machinery may, therefore, misincorporate dUTP instead of dTTP, resulting in single-strand DNA that contains some uracils (ssUDNA). The ssUDNA is extracted from the bacteriophage that is released into the medium, and then used as template for mutagenesis. [...] An oligonucleotide containing the desired mutation is used for primer extension. The <b>heteroduplex</b> DNA, that forms, consists of one parental non-mutated strand containing dUTP and a mutated strand containing dTTP. [...] The DNA is then transformed into an E. coli strain carrying the wildtype dut and ung genes. Here, the uracil-containing parental DNA strand is degraded, so that nearly all of the resulting DNA consists of the mutated strand.|$|E

We have also modified the electrophoretic conditions to optimize the detection of these <b>heteroduplexes.</b> In addition, the usefulness of this technique is demonstrated by its ability to detect a mutation in the cystic fibrosis gene that is the result of a single base substitution.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} PCR-generated artifacts (i. e., chimeras, mutations, and <b>heteroduplexes)</b> {{with the}} 16 S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) -based cloning approach, a model community of four species was constructed from alpha, beta, and gamma subdivisions {{of the division}} Proteobacteria as well as gram-positive bacterium, all {{of which could be}} distinguished by HhaI restriction digestion patterns. The overall PCR artifacts were significantly different among the three Taq DNA polymerases examined: 20 % for Z-Taq, with the highest processitivity; 15 % for LA-Taq, with the highest fidelity and intermediate processitivity; and 7 % for the conventionally used DNA polymerase, AmpliTaq. In contrast to the theoretical prediction, the frequency of chimeras for both Z-Taq (8. 7 %) and LA-Taq (6. 2 %) was higher than that for AmpliTaq (2. 5 %). The frequencies of chimeras and of <b>heteroduplexes</b> for Z-Taq were almost three times higher than those of AmpliTaq. The total PCR artifacts increased as PCR cycles and template concentrations increased and decreased as elongation time increased. Generally the frequency of chimeras was lower than that of mutations but higher than that of <b>heteroduplexes.</b> The total PCR artifacts as well as the frequency of <b>heteroduplexes</b> increased as the species diversity increased. PCR artifacts were significantly reduced by using AmpliTaq and fewer PCR cycles (fewer than 20 cycles), and the <b>heteroduplexes</b> could be effectively removed from PCR products prior to cloning by polyacrylamide gel purification or T 7 endonuclease I digestion.

These {{were used to}} assess the efficiency of repair of small heterologous sequences ("heterologies") in DNA by the Escherichia coli Dam-directed mismatch repair system. <b>Heteroduplexes</b> in defined states of methylation at d(GATC) sites were used to transform a repair-proficient indicator strain (which has a mnt-lac fusion coding for a nonfunctional mnt repressor) and its isogenic mutH, -L, and -S derivatives. Using this in vivo transformation system, we scored for repair on the basis of colony color: correction in favor of the strand bearing mnt+ coding information gives rise to colonies that are white, whereas correction on the opposite strand (mnt-) yields colonies that are red when grown on MacConkey agar. Failure to repair a heterology yields colonies that are both red and white ("mixed"). The correction efficiencies of two <b>heteroduplexes,</b> each containing a single G.

We investigated how recombination between 2 or 35 genetically distinct HIV- 1 genomes was affected by different PCR conditions using the parallel allele-specific sequencing (PASS) assay and the next generation sequencing method. In a standard PCR condition, about 40 % of amplicons in a PCR reaction were recombinants. The high recombination frequency could be significantly reduced if the number of amplicons in a PCR reaction was below a threshold of 10 (13) - 10 (14) using low thermal cycles, fewer input templates, and longer extension time. <b>Heteroduplexes</b> (each DNA strand from a distinct template) were present at a large proportion in the PCR products when more thermal cycles, more templates, and shorter extension time were used. Importantly, the majority of recombinants were identified in <b>heteroduplexes,</b> indicating that the recombinants were mainly generated through <b>heteroduplexes.</b> Since prematurely terminated extension fragments can form <b>heteroduplexes</b> by annealing to different templates during PCR amplification, recombination has a better chance to occur with samples containing different genomes when the number of amplicons accumulate over the threshold.
