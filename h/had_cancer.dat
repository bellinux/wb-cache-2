5|$|In 1870 Brassey {{was told}} that he <b>had</b> <b>cancer</b> but he {{continued}} to visit his working sites. One of his last visits was to the Wolverhampton and Walsall Railway, only a few miles from his first railway contract at Penkridge. In the late summer of 1870 he took to his bed at his home in St Leonards-on-Sea. There he was visited by members of his work force, not only his engineers and agents, but also his navvies, many of whom had walked for days to come and pay their respects.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, clinicians have {{increased}} their use of mindfulness-based practice and have extended its use {{to the treatment of}} adults who <b>have</b> <b>cancer.</b> Although research <b>has</b> demonstrated the physical and psychological benefits of these practices with adult cancer patients and with children in the general population, there is little research specifically on the use of mindfulness-based practices with children who <b>have</b> <b>cancer.</b> This article first explores existing research on the use of mindfulness-based practices with both adults who <b>have</b> <b>cancer</b> and children in the general population. The article then provides examples of cancer organizations using mindfulness-based practices in the treatment of children who <b>have</b> <b>cancer.</b> Last, the author provides recommendations for group mindfulness-based programs designed for children who <b>have</b> <b>cancer</b> in outpatient or community-based settings and discusses the role of social workers in facilitating the research and implementation of such programs...|$|R

He was survived by his son Michael and younger brother Carl. His second wife, Mary Teresa Benderska, whom he had married on 29 October 1948, had died in 1986, and his daughter Gelen Christine had died in 1965.

5|$|In {{the last}} few months of his life, Lowell {{struggled}} with gout, sciatica in his left leg, and chronic nausea; by the summer of 1891, doctors believed that Lowell <b>had</b> <b>cancer</b> in his kidneys, liver, and lungs. His last few months, he was administered opium for the pain and was rarely fully conscious. He died on August 12, 1891, at Elmwood. After services in the Appleton Chapel, he was buried in Mount Auburn Cemetery. After his death, Norton served as his literary executor and published several collections of Lowell's works and his letters.|$|E
5|$|Around this time, {{developments}} in chemotherapy offered some hope for Ruth. The doctors {{had not told}} Ruth that he <b>had</b> <b>cancer</b> because of his family's fear that he might do himself harm. They treated him with teropterin, a folic acid derivative; {{he may have been}} the first human subject. Ruth showed dramatic improvement during the summer of 1947, so much so that his case was presented by his doctors at a scientific meeting, without using his name. He was able to travel around the country, doing promotional work for the Ford Motor Company on American Legion Baseball. He appeared again at another day in his honor at Yankee Stadium in September, but was not well enough to pitch in an old-timers game as he had hoped.|$|E

5|$|Nick Petrides (Damien Fotiou) informs Paul {{that he has}} leukaemia and {{he starts}} him on a course of chemotherapy. Paul hires Naomi as his {{assistant}} and she helps to keep his diagnosis a secret. When Paul collapses, he calls Karl for help and tells him about his diagnosis. Nick tells Paul that his body has stopped responding to the chemotherapy. Paul wants Karl to succeed him as mayor and he asks Naomi to find his daughter Amy. While Naomi is encouraging Paul to be more positive, she kisses him. She apologises, but they both develop feelings for each other. Paul asks Naomi to shave his head when his hair starts falling out, and he sells Lassiter's to the Quill Group. Paul collapses from pneumonia and is hospitalised. Nick tells Paul that his cancer is in remission, but Georgia claims that Paul never <b>had</b> <b>cancer</b> and Nick is found to have doctored Paul's patient files. He is arrested soon after. Paul tries to forget about his feelings for Naomi, by pushing her and Brennan back together. However, Naomi discovers their plan and breaks up with Brennan. The Quill Group sell Lassiter's back to Paul and he and Naomi kiss. Amy (Zoe Cramond) turns up at the penthouse and is angered when Paul does not immediately recognise her, she later leaves town.|$|E

25|$|The American Cancer Society and the National Cancer Institute do not {{advise the}} use of Hoxsey Therapy, as neither has found any {{objective}} evidence that the treatment provides tangible benefit to people with cancer. Reviews by the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and M. D. Anderson Cancer Center {{found no evidence that}} Hoxsey Therapy is effective as a treatment for cancer. A controlled experiment in lab mice did not find any difference in tumor growth between untreated mice and those given the Hoxsey tonic. An FDA review of 400 people claiming to have been cured by the Hoxsey method found that many of the patients never in fact <b>had</b> <b>cancer,</b> or had received successful medical treatment elsewhere before being treated with Hoxsey Therapy. Those who <b>had</b> <b>cancer</b> at the time they used Hoxsey Therapy were uniformly either deceased or alive with active cancer. There were no cases of actual cures among those promoted as such by the Hoxsey clinic.|$|E

50|$|P(A|B) {{may or may}} not {{be equal}} to P(A) (the {{unconditional}} probability of A). If P(A|B) = P(A) (or its equivalent P(B|A) = P(B)), then events A and B are said to be independent: in such a case, having knowledge about either event does not change our knowledge about the other event. Also, in general, P(A|B) (the conditional probability of A given B) is not equal to P(B|A). For example, if you <b>have</b> <b>cancer</b> you might <b>have</b> a 90% chance of testing positive for cancer. In this case what is being measured is that if event B ("having cancer") has occurred, the probability of A (test is positive) given that B (<b>having</b> <b>cancer)</b> occurred is 90%: that is, P(A|B) = 90%. Alternatively, if you test positive for <b>cancer</b> you may <b>have</b> only a 15% chance of actually <b>having</b> <b>cancer</b> because most people do not <b>have</b> <b>cancer</b> and the false positive rate for the test may be high. In this case what is being measured is the probability of the event B (<b>having</b> <b>cancer)</b> given that the event A (test is positive) has occurred: P(B|A) = 15%. Falsely equating the two probabilities causes various errors of reasoning such as the base rate fallacy. Conditional probabilities can be correctly reversed using Bayes' theorem.|$|R

25|$|Eventually, {{the appellate}} court agreed with Ruby's lawyers {{that he should be}} granted a new trial. On October 5, 1966, the court ruled that his motion for a change of venue before the {{original}} trial court should have been granted. Ruby's conviction and death sentence were overturned. Arrangements were underway for a new trial to be held in February 1967 in Wichita Falls, Texas, when on December 9, 1966, Ruby was admitted to Parkland Hospital in Dallas, suffering from pneumonia. A day later, doctors realized he <b>had</b> <b>cancer</b> in his liver, lungs, and brain. Three weeks later, he died.|$|E
25|$|Following this, {{the process}} towards beatification began, and {{investigations}} by the Sacred Congregation of Rites (S.C.R.) into miracles performed by intercessory work of Pius X took place.

25|$|After {{suffering}} {{shortness of}} breath at a Teamsters executive board meeting, Fitzsimmons underwent surgery in late December 1979 which removed a non-malignant tumor in his bronchial passage. In early January 1980, the Los Angeles Herald-Examiner published a story claiming that Fitzsimmons was suffering from abdominal cancer, setting off widespread rumors that Fitzsimmons was dying and that a power struggle over his succession was raging in the Teamsters. Fitzsimmons denied that he <b>had</b> <b>cancer.</b> Nonetheless, by July Fitzsimmons admitted he had lung cancer and had undergone chemotherapy {{for the past seven}} months. However, he also declared himself cancer-free and fit to run for re-election in 1981.|$|E
