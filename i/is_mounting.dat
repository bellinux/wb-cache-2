5|$|Evidence <b>is</b> <b>mounting</b> {{that there}} is serious {{competition}} for food between larval/early juvenile introduced carp and larval/early juvenile native fish. Introduced carp dominate the fish faunas of lowland Murray-Darling rivers; the sheer amount of biomass carp now take up, and {{the large numbers of}} larvae carp produce, causes serious negative effects on river ecosystems and native fish. Carp are the main vector of the introduced Lernaea parasite (Lernaea cyprincea) and serious vectors of the introduced Asian fish tapeworm (Bothriocephalus acheilognathi).|$|E
5|$|In 2004, the German {{government}} {{introduced the}} first large-scale feed-in tariff system, under the German Renewable Energy Act, {{which resulted in}} explosive growth of PV installations in Germany. At the outset the FIT was over 3x the retail price or 8x the industrial price. The principle behind the German system is a 20-year flat rate contract. The value of new contracts is programmed to decrease each year, {{in order to encourage}} the industry to pass on lower costs to the end users. The programme has been more successful than expected with over 1GW installed in 2006, and political pressure <b>is</b> <b>mounting</b> to decrease the tariff to lessen the future burden on consumers.|$|E

25|$|Kaspar, {{a social}} robot, has been {{designed}} by the University of Hertfordshire's Adaptive Systems Research Group (ASRG). The Kaspar project began in 2005, drawing upon previous researches to develop a social robot for engaging autistic children {{in a variety of}} play scenarios.The aim was to research whether interacting and communicating with Kaspar would help children with autism interact and communicate more easily with people. This is important because there <b>is</b> <b>mounting</b> evidence that early intervention for children with autism may change the child's development trajectory. Kaspar is a research tool with programmed responses adapted to be used by an autistic child in a safe, non-judgemental environment. The Kaspar research has shown that robots may provide a safe and predictable tool for children with autism, that enables the children to learn social interaction and communication skills, addressing specific therapeutic and educational objectives (for example, being able to engage in direct eye-contact or shared eye-gaze), in an enjoyable play context.|$|E

500|$|Fungal {{proteins}} exhibiting templated {{conformational change}} {{were discovered in}} the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae by Reed Wickner in the early 1990s. For their mechanistic similarity to mammalian prions, they were termed yeast prions. [...] Subsequent to this, a prion has also {{been found in the}} fungus Podospora anserina. These prions behave similarly to PrP, but, in general, are nontoxic to their hosts. Susan Lindquist's group at the Whitehead Institute has argued some of the fungal prions are not associated with any disease state, but may have a useful role; however, researchers at the NIH have also provided arguments suggesting that fungal prions could be considered a diseased state. There <b>is</b> <b>mounting</b> evidence that fungal proteins have evolved specific functions that are beneficial to the microorganism that enhance their ability to adapt to their diverse environments.|$|E

2500|$|Maya {{civilization in}} the Central Area reached its full glory {{in the early}} eighth century, {{but it must have}} {{contained}} the seeds of its own destruction, for in the century and a half that followed, all its magnificent cities had fallen into decline and ultimately suffered abandonment. This was surely one of the most profound social and demographic catastrophes of all human history. Coe lists [...] "environmental collapse" [...] as one of the leading causes of the fall of the great empire, alongside [...] "endemic warfare", [...] "overpopulation", and [...] "drought". [...] "There <b>is</b> <b>mounting</b> evidence for massive deforestation and erosion throughout the Central Area. The Maya apocalypse, for such it was, surely had ecological roots," [...] explains Coe. [...] The plight of the Postclassic Maya is thought to have replicated much of the same situations as existed centuries earlier during the collapse of the Classic period Maya.|$|E
2500|$|In August 2016, after WikiLeaks {{published}} {{thousands of}} DNC emails, it was claimed that Russian intelligence had hacked the e-mails and leaked them to Wikileaks. At the time, DNC officials made such claims, {{along with a}} number of cybersecurity experts and cybersecurity firms. In October 2016, the U.S. intelligence community announced that it was [...] "confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from U.S. persons and institutions, including from U.S. political organizations". The U.S. intelligence agencies said that the hacks were consistent with the methods of Russian-directed efforts, and that people high up within the Kremlin were likely involved. On 14 October 2016, CNN reported that [...] "there <b>is</b> <b>mounting</b> evidence that the Russian government is supplying WikiLeaks with hacked emails pertaining to the U.S. presidential election."

2500|$|Communication is {{critical}} for the delivery of appropriate and effective treatment and care, regardless of a patient’s race, and miscommunication can lead to incorrect diagnosis, improper use of medications, and failure to receive follow-up care. [...] The patient provider relationship {{is dependent on the}} ability of both individuals to effectively communicate. [...] Language and culture both {{play a significant role in}} communication during a medical visit. Among the patient population, minorities face greater difficulty in communicating with their physicians. [...] Patients when surveyed responded that 19% of the time they have problems communicating with their providers which included understanding doctor, feeling doctor listened, and had questions but did not ask. In contrast, the Hispanic population had the largest problem communicating with their provider, 33% of the time. Communication has been linked to health outcomes, as communication improves so does patient satisfaction which leads to improved compliance and then to improved health outcomes. Quality of care is impacted as a result of an inability to communicate with health care providers. [...] Language plays a pivotal role in communication and efforts need to be taken to ensure excellent communication between patient and provider. Among limited English proficient patients in the United States, the linguistic barrier is even greater. [...] Less than half of non-English speakers who say they need an interpreter during clinical visits report having one. [...] The absence of interpreters during a clinical visit adds to the communication barrier. Furthermore, inability of providers to communicate with limited English proficient patients leads to more diagnostic procedures, more invasive procedures, and over prescribing of medications. Poor communication contributes to poor medical compliance and health outcomes. [...] Many health-related settings provide interpreter services for their limited English proficient patients. This has been helpful when providers do not speak the same language as the patient. [...] However, there <b>is</b> <b>mounting</b> evidence that patients need to communicate with a language concordant physician (not simply an interpreter) to receive the best medical care, bond with the physician, and be satisfied with the care experience. Having patient-physician language discordant pairs (i.e. Spanish-speaking patient with an English-speaking physician) may also lead to greater medical expenditures and thus higher costs to the organization. [...] Additional communication problems result from a decrease or lack of cultural competence by providers. [...] It is important for providers to be cognizant of patients’ health beliefs and practices without being judgmental or reacting. [...] Understanding a patients’ view of health and disease is important for diagnosis and treatment. [...] So providers need to assess patients’ health beliefs and practices to improve quality of care. Patient health decisions can be influenced by religious beliefs, mistrust of Western medicine, and familial and hierarchical roles, all of which a white provider may not be familiar with. Other type of communication problems are seen in LGBT health care with the spoken heterosexist (conscious or unconscious) attitude on LGBT patients, lack of understanding on issues like having no sex with men (lesbians, gynecologic examinations) and other issues.|$|E
