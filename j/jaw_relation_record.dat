40|$|Introduction: Occlusal plane {{orientation}} {{is an important}} part of organized occlusion. The ala-tragus plane is considered to be parallel to the occlusal plane while reconstructing occlusion. This study was aimed to determine the condition of parallelism of these two planes in Iranian. Methods and material: In this cross sectional study, 197 patients were examined. The angle between ala-tragus and occlusal plane was assessed by indexed fox plane and the position of Stensen's duct to adjacent molar in maxillary tooth and the position of the dorsal side of the tongue relative to posterior mandibular teeth were also examined by clinical examination. Then two planes were investigated by lateral cephalometry for 23 patients. Deep bite, long face, and with bruxism patients were identified to examine the probable effect of this position in them. The data was analyzed with t-test, Peirson and χ 2 tests (a = 0. 05). Results: The ala-tragus line had the tendency to be paralleled with posterior occlusal plane and the mean angle of two planes was 1. 77 ˚. In cephalometric measurement, the estimated mean of the angle was 2. 96 ˚. In the most of the cases, Dorsum of tongue was above the mandibular occlusal plan. In the half of the cases Stensen's duct was in the occlusal third of adjacent molar. Conclusion: The differences in the mean angles of clinical measurement and cephalometric measurement have been resulted from the differences in two methods. The results allow clinicians to parallel occlusal plan with the ala-tragus line to achieve a natural position for reconstruction of occlusal plan.

In this study the effect of three curing methods, polishing, and variation in cast contour on the adaptability of sprinkled on record bases was determined. Further, the results were compared to record bases fabricated by the confined dough technique. Thirty record bases were fabricated using the same aautopolymerizing resin. The samples were divided into six groups. Each group contains five samples. Adaptation was evaluated at six different locations with a measuring microscope equipped with a filar unit measuring eyepiece. The accuracy of adaptation under the various testing conditions was in the following decreasing order; (1) Record bases cured in a monomer atmosphere.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} if patient ratings {{of their ability}} to chew are dependent on the method of complete denture fabrication. METHOD AND MATERIALS: Twenty edentulous patients participated in a randomized within-subject crossover trial. Each participant received 2 sets of new complete dentures. One pair (Gerber prosthesis) was manufactured based on tracings (to determine centric relation) and facebow transfer; semianatomic teeth with a lingualized and balanced occlusal pattern were used. The other set of complete dentures was made using a simplified procedure without facebow transfer; <b>jaw</b> <b>relations</b> were <b>recorded</b> with wax occlusion rims, and anatomic teeth were set with a canine and premolar guidance (Gysi prosthesis). The 2 dentures were delivered in randomized order, and each was worn for 3 months. Three months after insertion, patients' ratings of each new prosthesis were obtained on visual analog scales for general satisfaction, comfort, ability to speak, stability, esthetics, ease of cleaning, and ability to chew. RESULTS: Patients rated their general satisfaction, stability, and esthetic appearance significantly better for the Gysi prostheses (P >. 05). No significant differences between the 2 denture treatment methods were detected for ability to speak, comfort, chewing ability, and the ease of cleaning the dentures. CONCLUSION: A comprehensive method for the fabrication of complete dentures using lingualized teeth does not appear to positively influence patient ratings of denture satisfaction when compared to a simple procedure with anatomic teeth...|$|R

The current recommended average settings using the Hanau's formula commonly used by clinicians is questionable, and thus reassessment is needed. This study was carried out to evaluate and compare the lateral condylar guidance: (1) Using the Hanau's formula and the computerized jaw tracking device (Kinesiograph). (2) On the right and left sides using both these methods. Materials and Methods: A total of 20 completely edentulous patients (14 male and 6 females) within 40 – 60 years of age were selected. <b>Jaw</b> <b>relation</b> was <b>recorded</b> followed by face bow transfer. Extraoral Gothic arch tracing was recorded; three protrusive records were obtained and condylar guidance was calculated. Lateral condylar guidance was then calculated using Hanau's formula, followed by the computerized jaw tracking device. A comparative evaluation was done of the obtained values. The same investigator worked with each of the study participants for the purpose of standardization. Results: The lateral condylar guidance values obtained using the Hanau's formula ranged from 14 to 17 ° while those obtained using the computerized K 7 jaw tracking device ranged from 8 to 40 °. Bennett angle values, obtained using the jaw tracking device and Hanau's formula showed statistically significant differences (P 0. 05).

40|$|Statement of the problem: Currently, {{there are}} no studies that {{presented}} patient centered outcomes for a CAD/CAM 2 -visit digital denture. Purpose: To study: 1) if a 2 -visit CAD/CAM denture was satisfactory to patients who evaluated 12 specific clinical outcomes. 2) If there are any patient reported differences between various clinical outcomes, when evaluated at baseline (within 1 month of insertion) and at a 12 month follow-up since insertion. 3) If there are any adverse clinical and patient-satisfaction outcomes related to CAD-CAM complete denture prostheses. Materials and methods: A total of 20 subjects who presented with an existing set of maxillary and mandibular complete dentures were selected {{to take part in}} the study. Each set of complete dentures were duplicated in a clear acrylic resin. These duplicate dentures were then used as the custom tray, in which the patients went through border molding movements followed by a final impression. <b>Jaw</b> <b>Relation</b> <b>Records</b> was taken in centric relation at the appropriate occlusal vertical dimension and the correct incisal edge position. The mold and shade of the teeth were then selected. The duplicated dentures with occlusal rims and impression were then shipped to AvaDent. A digital preview was reviewed. If corrections were required, it was communicated with AvaDent through email or phone calls. Upon approval of the digital preview, the CAD-CAM monolithic dentures were milled. Standard denture protocols were followed for the insertion visit and subsequent post-insertion visits. The patients evaluated 12 clinical variables using the Visual Analogue Scale at 0 -months (baseline) and at 12 -months following insertion. The following variables were used: Retention (“Tightness”), Stability (“Absence of rockiness”), Support/Absence of food underneath the denture, Esthetics/Cosmetics, Finish/Appearance, Occlusion/Bite and chewing ability, Speech sounds/Ability to speak normally, Extensions/Bulkiness, Tissue health/Absence of discomfort or sore spots, Projection of the upper lip, Treatment time, and Overall evaluation/ “Overall prosthesis satisfaction” The collected data were then statistically analyzed. Results: Of the 20 subjects, 14 patients were evaluated at the 12 month follow up. Three subjects self-withdrew due to patient dissatisfaction. Another 3 patients were lost to follow up. All 14 patients rated the studied clinical outcomes as good to excellent at baseline and at 1 -year recall. Improvements in ratings were seen from baseline to 12 months in the following outcomes: extensions/bulkiness, occlusion/bite or chewing ability, Tissue health/Absence of discomfort or sore spots, finish/appearance, speech sounds, treatment time, and overall evaluation. Conclusions: Within the limitations of this study, the patient-centered outcomes for CAD-CAM dentures fabricated using a 2 -visit protocol in patients with existing complete dentures was evaluated as good to excellent by patients, using a visual analog scale. The patient evaluations showed minimal differences from baseline and at 1 -year evaluation. However, speech, absence of sore spots, and total treatment time showed a statistically significant improvement in VAS ratings. Finally, patients classified as philosophical by House Classification provided the most favorable ratings in patient satisfaction for CAD-CAM dentures. Though the 2 -visit complete denture is a viable treatment option, clinicians should recognize the need for careful patient selection, learning curve in the clinical steps as well as the laboratory aspect of designing the CAD-CAM denture. Furthermore, the additional time and effort, spent off-chairside by clinicians to analyze and approve digital previews, should be weighed against chair-side time spent on the esthetic try-in procedure, which requires an additional visit...|$|R

40|$|Background/Aim. Malocclusion of {{skeletal}} class III is {{a complex}} abnormality, with a characteristic sagital position of the lower jaw {{in front of the}} upper one. A higher level of prognatism of the lower <b>jaw</b> in <b>relation</b> to the upper one can be the consequence of its excessive length. The aim {{of this study was to}} find the differences in the length of the lower jaw in the children with skeletal class III and the children with normal sagital interjaw relation (skeletal class I) in the period of mixed dentition. Methods. After clinical and x-ray diagnostics, profile tele-x-rays of the head were analyzed in 60 examinees with mixed dentition, aged from 6 to 12 years. The examinees were divided into two groups: group 1 - the children with skeletal class III and group 2 - the children with skeletal class I. The length of the lower jaw, upper jaw and cranial base were measured. The proportional relations between the lengths measured within each group were established and the level of difference in the lengths measured and their proportions between the groups were estimated. Results. No significant difference between the groups was found in the body length, ramus and the total length of the lower <b>jaw.</b> Proportional <b>relation</b> between the body length and the length of the lower jaw ramus and proportional relation between the forward cranial base and the lower jaw body were not significantly different.

Conclusion. Of all the analyzed parameters, the following were selected as the early indicators of the development of skeletal class III on the lower jaw: greater total length of the lower jaw, proportional to the total lengths of cranial base and the upper jaw, as well as greater length of the lower jaw body, proportional to the length of the upper jaw body. ...|$|R
40|$|Masseteric {{reflexes}} following standardized taps on {{an upper}} incisor were recorded electromyographically (1) {{in children with}} Class II, Division 1 malocclusions at different times {{before and during the}} treatment with the Bionator functional appliance and (2) during an observation period in control subjects who were not being treated. In each experimental session, 72 taps were delivered during clenching at 10 % of the maximal electromyographic output. Statistical criteria provided by a previously developed computer program allowed the objective determination of inhibitory and excitatory periods in the electromyographic output following the stimulus, which together constitute the poststimulus electromyographic complex (PSEC). The influence of the change in occlusal relations on the PSEC was determined in ten subjects by comparing pretreatment results with those obtained after 1, 3, and 6 months of treatment. Concurrent with an improvement of the sagittal <b>jaw</b> <b>relation</b> in the patients with a pronounced disharmony, a short latency excitatory peak appeared in their PSECs. It was demonstrated by averaging nonrectified electromyographic activity that this peak was brought about through synchronization of motor units. In the control group, however, the morphology of the PSEC was reproducible over time. Successful functional therapy is thus accompanied by specific transient changes in the reflex response of the masseter muscles to standardized tooth taps. The neural pathways contributing to these observations originate in periodontal and muscular receptors, and might provide a clue for the mechanism underlying successful functional treatment. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{cases of}} TMD {{are complex and}} multifactorial, {{therefore}} the management should be done by several disciplines. In this report, a 27 -year-old man came to the teaching hospital of the University of Indonesia Faculty of Dentistry’s Prosthodontic Department complaining about clicking sound and pain around his right joint. He received orthodontic treatment 9 years ago with removable appliance at a private practice and had 4 premolar extractions. The patient’s face looked asymmetric, with a low vertical dimension, a Class II occlusion, and an anterior deep bite. Besides that, he clenched his teeth during emotional stress. Lateral transcranial photo showed that {{the position of the}} left condyle was relatively normal or slightly anterior, and the right condyle was in the superoposterior position in the fossa with an abnormal shape. To solve this problem, the patient was referred to the Orthodontic Department to get a correct vertical dimension and normal anterior overbite. After 6 years, the patient was again referred to the Prosthodontic Department, but the result was not successful. In order to get the right vertical dimension, an occlusal splint was fabricated to achieve a comfort <b>jaw</b> <b>relation.</b> In this position, the overbite was 2 mm, but the space between the upper and lower posterior teeth was 5 mm. In this situation, full veneer crowns were not impossible to fabricate. Finally, to maintain this comfort position, the patient was suggested to wear the occlusal splint and come regularly for control every 6 months...|$|R
