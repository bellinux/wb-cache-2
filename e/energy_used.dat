However, short-chain fatty acids (e.g., butyric acid, propionic acid, and acetic acid) and the medium-chain fatty acids, octanoic acid and heptanoic acid, can cross the blood–brain barrier and be metabolized by brain cells. The brain stores glucose in the form of glycogen, albeit in significantly smaller amounts than that found in the liver or skeletal muscle.|$|E

The building was modeled in IDA-ICE, and energy simulations where performed. Detailed data of the building have been collected to enable a realistic model. Full year energy simulations of the building was performed and compared to the measured <b>energy</b> <b>use.</b> The calibration was performed in three parts: the first calibration was done using building defaults, then a calibration using equipment settings, and finally a calibration using operation settings. An initial simulation was performed to identify the differences in measured and simulated <b>energy</b> <b>use.</b> The <b>energy</b> <b>use</b> was compared in four subgroups, light and appliances, pumps and fans, heating, and cooling. The initial simulation showed discrepancy in all predefined groupings. After the calibration {{three of the four}} subgroups achieved a result with acceptable similarity to the measured <b>energy</b> <b>use.</b> The difference in total yearly <b>energy</b> <b>use</b> between measured and simulated was reduced from 17 % to 11 %.

The influence one system has with other systems also results in challenges when adjusting parameters. A seemingly calibrated model can achieve approximately similar <b>energy</b> <b>use</b> as the measured <b>energy</b> <b>use,</b> but can still give huge discrepancies when comparing the result in a shorter time resolution.

We employ a lifecycle perspective methodology and determine the production, operation and end-of-life primary <b>energy</b> <b>use</b> of the buildings. We find that the passive house requirement strongly reduces the final <b>energy</b> <b>use</b> for heating compared to the current Swedish building code. However, the primary <b>energy</b> <b>use</b> is largely determined by the energy supply system, which is generally outside the mandate of the building standards. Overall, buildings with district heating have lower life-cycle primary <b>energy</b> <b>use</b> than alternatives heated with heat pump. The primary energy for production is small relative to that for operation, but it is more significant as the energy-efficiency standard of building improves and when efficient <b>energy</b> supply is <b>used.</b> Our results show the importance of a system-wide lifecycle perspective in reducing primary <b>energy</b> <b>use</b> in the built environment.
