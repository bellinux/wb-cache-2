5|$|Like other animals, fish {{suffer from}} {{diseases}} and parasites. To prevent disease {{they have a}} variety of defenses. Non-specific defenses include the skin and scales, as well as the mucus layer secreted by the epidermis that traps and inhibits the growth of microorganisms. If pathogens breach these defenses, fish can develop an inflammatory response that increases blood flow to the infected region and delivers white blood cells that attempt to destroy pathogens. Specific defenses respond to particular pathogens recognised by the fish's body, i.e., an immune response. In recent years, vaccines have become widely used in aquaculture and also with ornamental fish, for example furunculosis vaccines in <b>farmed</b> <b>salmon</b> and koi herpes virus in koi.|$|E
5|$|Animals are {{susceptible}} {{to a number of}} diseases and conditions that may affect their health. Some, like classical swine fever and scrapie are specific to one type of stock, while others, like foot-and-mouth disease affect all cloven-hoofed animals. Where the condition is serious, governments impose regulations on import and export, on the movement of stock, quarantine restrictions and the reporting of suspected cases. Vaccines are available against certain diseases, and antibiotics are widely used where appropriate. At one time, antibiotics were routinely added to certain compound foodstuffs to promote growth, but this practice is now frowned on in many countries because of the risk that it may lead to antibiotic resistance. Animals living under intensive conditions are particularly prone to internal and external parasites; increasing numbers of sea lice are affecting <b>farmed</b> <b>salmon</b> in Scotland. Reducing the parasite burdens of livestock results in increased productivity and profitability.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{the wild}} stock, about 79 million metric tons (87 million tons) of food and non-food {{products}} were produced by sea farming in 2010, an all-time high. About six hundred species {{of plants and animals}} were cultured, some for use in seeding wild populations. The animals raised included finfish, aquatic reptiles, crustaceans, molluscs, sea cucumbers, sea urchins, sea squirts, and jellyfish. Integrated mariculture has the advantage that there is a readily-available supply of planktonic food and waste is removed naturally; in cases where the waste would otherwise be harmful, multi-species techniques can used to, e.g., feed farmed shellfish from the waste being produced by <b>farmed</b> <b>salmon.</b> Various methods are employed. Mesh enclosures for finfish can be suspended in the open seas, cages can be used in more sheltered waters, or ponds can be refreshed with water at each high tide. Shrimps can be reared in shallow ponds connected to the open sea. Ropes can be hung in water to grow algae, oysters, and mussels. Oysters can be reared on trays or in mesh tubes. Sea cucumbers can be ranched on the seabed. Captive breeding programmes have raised lobster larvae for release of juveniles into the wild resulting in an increased lobster harvest in Maine. At least 145 species of seaweed—red, green, and brown algae—are eaten worldwide, some long farmed in Japan and other Asian countries; there is great potential for additional algaculture. Few maritime flowering plants are widely used for food but one example is marsh samphire, which is eaten both raw and cooked. A major difficulty for aquaculture is the tendency towards monoculture and the associated risk of widespread disease. In the 1990s, disease wiped out China's farmed Farrer's scallop and white shrimp and required their replacement by other species. Shrimp farming has also caused the destruction of important mangrove forests throughout southeast Asia.|$|E

25|$|Since European {{settlement}} in Stó:lō territory the salmon have been experiencing decreases in numbers. Major contributions to this include {{the building of}} the CPR, agriculture, and forestry. One of the newer major issues is the expanding <b>farmed</b> <b>salmon</b> industry. The <b>farmed</b> <b>salmon</b> are transferring lice and disease to the wild salmon. This is further harming the already dwindling numbers.|$|E
25|$|Salmon is {{a popular}} food. Classified as an oily fish, salmon is {{considered}} to be healthy due to the fish's high protein, high omega-3 fatty acids, and high vitamin D content. Salmon is also a source of cholesterol, with a range of 23–214mg/100g depending on the species. According to reports in the journal Science, <b>farmed</b> <b>salmon</b> may contain high levels of dioxins. PCB (polychlorinated biphenyl) levels may be up to eight times higher in <b>farmed</b> <b>salmon</b> than in wild salmon, but still well below levels considered dangerous. Nonetheless, according to a 2006 study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, the benefits of eating even <b>farmed</b> <b>salmon</b> still outweigh any risks imposed by contaminants. <b>Farmed</b> <b>salmon</b> has a high omega 3 fatty acid content comparable to wild salmon. The type of omega-3 present may not be a factor for other important health functions.|$|E
25|$|In addition, salmon require {{nutritional}} intakes of protein, protein {{which is}} often supplied {{to them in the}} form of fish meal as the lowest cost alternative protein. Consequently, <b>farmed</b> <b>salmon</b> consume more fish than they generate as a final product.|$|E

25|$|Modern salmonid farming {{systems are}} intensive.

25|$|Nearly all {{captured}} {{wild salmon}} are Pacific salmon. The capture of wild Atlantic salmon {{has always been}} relatively small, and has declined steadily since 1990.

25|$|Salmon are carnivorous. They are fed a meal {{produced}} from catching other wild {{fish and other}} marine organisms. Salmon farming leads to a high demand for wild forage fish. Salmon require large nutritional intakes of protein, and <b>farmed</b> <b>salmon</b> consume more fish than they generate as a final product. To produce one pound of <b>farmed</b> <b>salmon,</b> products from several pounds of wild fish are fed to them. As the salmon farming industry expands, it requires more wild forage fish for feed, {{at a time when}} 75% of the world's monitored fisheries are already near to or have exceeded their maximum sustainable yield. The industrial-scale extraction of wild forage fish for salmon farming affects the survivability of the wild predator fish which rely on them for food.|$|E
25|$|Farmed {{salmonids}} can, {{and often}} do, escape from sea cages. If the farmed salmonid is not native, it {{can compete with}} native wild species for food and habitat. If the farmed salmonid is native, it can interbreed with the wild native salmonids. Such interbreeding can reduce genetic diversity, disease resistance and adaptability. In 2004, about 500,000 salmon and trout escaped from ocean net pens off Norway. Around Scotland, 600,000 salmon were released during storms. Commercial fishermen targeting wild salmon not infrequently catch escaped <b>farm</b> <b>salmon.</b> At one stage, in the Faroe Islands, 20 to 40 percent of all fish caught were escaped <b>farm</b> <b>salmon.</b>|$|R

25|$|As can be {{seen from}} the {{production}} chart at the left, the global capture reported by different countries to the FAO of commercial wild salmon has remained fairly steady since 1990 at about one million tonnes per year.

40|$|Contrary {{to several}} recent studies, a review (Brooks, 2005) of sea lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) {{interactions}} between wild and <b>farm</b> <b>salmon</b> in the Broughton Archipelago, British Columbia, Canada, {{concluded that there}} is little potential for sea lice transmis-sion from <b>farm</b> to wild <b>salmon.</b> In this rebuttal, we show that this conclusion was based on a flawed interpretation of how salinity affects louse development, a misunderstanding of how the timing of salinity changes corresponds to the timing of the juvenile salmon migration, models of larval dispersion that overestimate the transport of louse larvae, and a selective and misleading assessment of the literature. We analyze and extend the current models of larval dispersion and demonstrate the (perhaps counter-intuitive) result that sustained high abundances of infectious larvae should be expected near lice-infested <b>salmon</b> <b>farms.</b> We also highlight important studies overlooked in Brooks (2005) and clarify some misinterpretations. Counter to the conclusions in Brooks (2005), the modeling and empirical work to date on sea lice interactions between wild and <b>farm</b> <b>salmon</b> are consistent and point to a strong association between <b>salmon</b> <b>farming</b> and recurrent infestations of wild juvenile salmon in the Broughton Archipelago...|$|R

40|$|Atlantic salmon {{breeding}} {{programs were}} first established in Norway {{in the late}} 1960 ´s. Since then, production of <b>farm</b> <b>salmon</b> has steadily increased, and represents the economically most important aquaculture industry in Norway today. Containment represents a major challenge in marine aquaculture, and each year, large numbers of <b>farm</b> <b>salmon</b> escape and enter Norwegian rivers. Experimental evidence suggests that genetic interaction between <b>farm</b> and wild <b>salmon</b> may weaken the viability of wild salmon, but the magnitude of gene flow and its consequences remain elusive. The latter {{have been difficult to}} quantify, partly due to a limited number of diagnostic genetic markers. In the present study, a total of 1309 samples, including 12 different farm strains (four year-classes from each of three breeding companies) and 13 wild populations were analyzed for genetic variation at 4 514 single nucleotide polymorphism loci (SNP), included in the 16 k Atlantic salmon Illumina SNP-chip (CIGENE). A set of 105 SNPs were identified as being highly diagnostic in identifying individual fish as of farm or wild origin, regardless of population or strain. These genetic markers will prove useful for identification of farm escapees in wild populations and for monitoring gene flow from <b>farm</b> to wild <b>salmon.</b> The latter requires that hybrids, and ideally, their offspring, can be identified. The performance of the set of SNPs presented here, with regard to the latter, remains to be tested. Once estimates of gene flow from <b>farm</b> to wild <b>salmon</b> are obtained, {{it is also important to}} couple such genetic introgression to potential changes in population fitness in wild populations, i. e. changes in allele frequencies at genetic markers linked to important fitness traits. From the observation of common allele frequencies among <b>farm</b> <b>salmon</b> different from wild salmon we suggest that some of the genetic markers are likely to be affected by directional selection in the breeding programs...|$|R
