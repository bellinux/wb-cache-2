40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} on 117 adult common <b>foxes</b> (Vulpes vulpes) of both sexes. A total of 60 <b>foxes</b> came from a fur farm (30 males and 30 females), while 57 <b>foxes</b> were animals living in the wild (29 males and 28 females). Examinations included measurements of body weight and selected exterior body traits. After opening of the body cavity internal organs were dissected and then weighted. Next the length of individual intestine segments was measured. Numerical data were subjected to statistical analysis in order to compare metric traits of <b>foxes</b> living under different environmental conditions. It was shown in those analyses that body weight and quantitative exterior traits in fur farm <b>foxes,</b> except for ear length, are greater than in <b>foxes</b> living in the wild. Moreover, {{it was found that}} the weight of internal organs in male fur farm <b>foxes</b> was greater than in male wild <b>foxes,</b> except for lung and heart weight. Female fur farm <b>foxes</b> had lower heart, lung and additionally stomach weights. It was found in this study that in <b>foxes</b> living in the wild intestine length was over four times greater than their body weight, while in fur farm <b>foxes</b> it was over three-fold. At the same time the ratio of small intestine length to large intestine length was greater in fur farm <b>foxes</b> than in <b>foxes</b> living in the wild...|$|R

Gabriel and <b>Fox</b> began feuding with the Burchill siblings (Paul and Katie Lea) in late December 2008. <b>Fox</b> made her ECW in-ring debut on January 6, 2009, in a loss to Katie Lea.

2500|$|Many <b>foxes</b> adapt well {{to human}} environments, with several species {{classified}} as [...] "resident urban carnivores" [...] {{for their ability}} to sustain populations entirely within urban boundaries. <b>Foxes</b> in urban areas can live longer and can have smaller litter sizes than <b>foxes</b> in non-urban areas. Urban <b>foxes</b> are ubiquitous in Europe, where they show altered behaviors compared to non-urban <b>foxes,</b> including increased population density, smaller territory, and pack foraging. <b>Foxes</b> have been introduced in numerous locations, with varying effects on indigenous flora and fauna.|$|R
5|$|In Eurasia, red <b>foxes</b> may be preyed upon by leopards, caracals and Eurasian lynxes. The lynxes chase red <b>foxes</b> {{into deep}} snow, where their longer legs and larger paws {{give them an}} {{advantage}} over <b>foxes,</b> especially when {{the depth of the}} snow exceeds one metre. In the Velikoluki district in Russia, red <b>foxes</b> are absent or are seen only occasionally where lynxes establish permanent territories. Researchers consider lynxes to represent considerably less danger to red <b>foxes</b> than wolves do. North American felid predators of red <b>foxes</b> include cougars, Canadian lynxes and bobcats. Occasionally, large raptors such as Eurasian eagle owls will prey on young <b>foxes,</b> while golden eagles have been known to kill adults.|$|R
50|$|Among {{the true}} <b>foxes,</b> their skulls {{are the most}} {{specialised}} {{in the direction of}} carnivory; they are longer in their condylobasal length and in mandible and cheek tooth length than those of hill <b>foxes.</b> Their cranial region is shorter than that of hill <b>foxes,</b> and their zygomatic arches narrower. Their jaws are also much narrower, and their foreheads concave. The canine teeth of Tibetan <b>foxes</b> are also much longer than those of hill <b>foxes.</b>|$|R
5|$|DNA {{analysis}} {{shows that the}} first three form monophyletic clades. The wolf-like canids and the South American canids together form the tribe Canini. Molecular data imply a North American origin of living Canidae some ten million years ago and an African origin of wolf-like canines (Canis, Cuon, and Lycaon), with the jackals being the most basal of this group. The South American clade is rooted by the maned wolf and bush dog, and the fox-like canids by the fennec <b>fox</b> and Blanford's <b>fox.</b> The grey <b>fox</b> and island <b>fox</b> are basal to the other clades; however, this topological difference is not strongly supported.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{describe}} a mechanistic model whereby <b>Foxd</b> 3, a forkhead transcription factor, prevents neural crest-derived precursors from acquiring a melanophore fate. <b>Foxd</b> 3 regulates this fate choice by repressing the mitfa promoter in {{a subset of}} neural crest cells. mitfa is only expressed in a <b>Foxd</b> 3 -negative subset of neural crest cells, and <b>foxd</b> 3 mutants show {{an increase in the}} spatial domain of mitfa expression, thereby suggesting that <b>Foxd</b> 3 limits the mitfa domain. Furthermore, <b>foxd</b> 3 :gfp transgenic zebrafish reveal <b>foxd</b> 3 expression in xanthophore precursors and iridophores, but not in terminally differentiated melanophores. Luciferase experiments and embryo mRNA injections indicate <b>Foxd</b> 3 acts directly on the mitfa promoter to negatively regulate mitfa expression. Taken together, our data suggests the presence of <b>Foxd</b> 3 in a subset of precursors leads to mitfa repression and suppression of melanophore fate. MITF, the human mitfa ortholog, has recently been described as an oncogene and implicated in various forms of melanoma. Understanding the mechanisms that regulate mitfa and melanophore development could prove informative in the treatment and prevention of these human diseases...|$|R

5|$|<b>Fox</b> Terriers are two {{different}} breeds of the terrier dog type: the Smooth <b>Fox</b> Terrier and the Wire <b>Fox</b> Terrier.

The Wire and Smooth <b>Fox</b> Terriers share similar characteristics, the main differences being in the coat and markings.
