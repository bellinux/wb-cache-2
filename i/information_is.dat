40|$|In {{the working}} memory model, phonological and {{visuospatial}} <b>information</b> <b>are</b> stored by separate and independent systems. However, sometimes binding of visual and verbal information must occur. This study investigated whether these memory systems cooperate in {{the recall of}} spatial location of a stimulus defined by both types of information. Participants memorized the spatial locations in which name-and-face pairs were presented and either recalled {{the position of a}} test stimulus in which the two types of <b>information</b> <b>were</b> always present (Experiment 1) or recalled the position of a test stimulus that non-predictively contained either the visual or verbal information (Experiment 2). The results showed no cooperation between visuospatial and phonological systems when both types of <b>information</b> <b>were</b> present in the test stimulus. Rather, a clear preference for verbal <b>information</b> <b>was</b> found (Experiment 1). When the test stimulus contained only one type of information, recall based on both verbal and visual <b>information</b> <b>was</b> impaired (Experiment 2). These results suggest that visual and verbal <b>information</b> <b>are</b> not automatically integrated into memory and that storage capacity is smaller for integrated information than for isolated information.

50|$|When someone {{chooses to}} reveal private {{information}} to another person, {{they are making}} that person a co-owner of the information. Co-ownership comes with rules, responsibilities, and rights which the discloser of the information and receiver of it negotiate.

And {{how much of the}} <b>information</b> can <b>be</b> disclosed? The negotiation of these rules can be complex, the rules can be explicit as well as implicit, and they can be violated.|$|R

40|$|Issue Addressed: Nutrition {{information}} at the point-of-sale assists consumers to make informed fast food choices. This study provides a baseline measure of the availability and accessibility of nutrition information in fast food outlets in Australia, filling {{a gap in the}} literature. Methods: An in-store observational survey was conducted in 222 outlets of five fast food chains in five states. The Australian websites for each chain were surveyed for nutrition information. Results: At least some nutrition <b>information</b> <b>was</b> available in 66 % of outlets. The availability of <b>information</b> <b>was</b> higher in lower socioeconomic areas. Significantly less <b>information</b> <b>was</b> available in signatory chains of the self-regulatory marketing code. <b>Information</b> provided <b>was</b> generally incomplete; only one outlet (0. 5 %) provided information for all food and beverage items. In some instances <b>information</b> <b>was</b> old. <b>Information</b> <b>was</b> more available for ‘healthier’ products and less available for meal combinations. <b>Information</b> <b>was</b> provided on all chains’ websites, however it was sometimes difficult to locate. Conclusions: While most outlets surveyed made some nutrition information available to consumers, it was generally incomplete. Fast food chains should provide comprehensive, up-to-date information for all menu items. Chains should also ensure their staff members are adequately trained in providing nutrition information.

40|$|For {{patients}} with haematological malignancies, information on disease, prognosis, treatment and impact on {{quality of life}} is of the utmost importance. To gain insight into the perceived need for information in relation to sociodemographic and clinical parameters, comorbidity, quality of life (QoL) and information satisfaction, we compiled a questionnaire based on existing validated questionnaires. A total of 458 patients diagnosed with a haematological malignancy participated. The perceived need for <b>information</b> <b>was</b> moderate to high (40 - 70 %). Multivariate regression analyses showed that a higher need for <b>information</b> <b>was</b> related to younger age, worse QoL, being member of a patient society and moderate comorbidity. The need for disease and treatment-related <b>information</b> <b>was</b> higher than the need for psychosocial information. A higher need for disease and treatment-related <b>information</b> <b>was</b> associated to being diagnosed with multiple myeloma. A higher need for psychosocial <b>information</b> <b>was</b> related to a lower educational level. The <b>information</b> provision could <b>be</b> improved according to 41 % of the patients. Higher satisfaction with provided <b>information</b> <b>was</b> associated with better QoL. Most patients (62 %) reported that they wanted to be fully informed about their illness and actively involved in treatment decision-making. The results contribute to improving patient-tailored information provision and shared decision-making in clinical practice. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
