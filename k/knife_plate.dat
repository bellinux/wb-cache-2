The name {{has nothing to}} do, I need hardly say, with Apollo or his feasts, the Apolloniæ, nor has it any {{relationship}} with the admirable 'Apollinaris water.' It was given by the Portuguese from the saint [Footnote: Butler's Lives gives 'S. Apollonia (not Appolonia, as the miners have it), v.m. February 9.' This admirable old maid leaped into the fire prepared for her by the heathen populace of Alexandria when she refused to worship their 'execrable divinity.' There are also an Apollonius (March 5), 'a zealous holy anchorite' of Egyptian Antinous; and Apollinaris, who about A.D. 376 began to 'broach his heresy,' denying in Christ a human soul.] {{who presided over the}} day of discovery. In the early half of the present century the King of Apollonia ruled the coast from the Assini to the Ancobra Rivers; the English built a fort by permission at his head-quarters, and carried on a large trade in gold-dust. Meredith (1800) tells us that, when his Majesty deceased, some twenty men were sacrificed on every Saturday till the 'great customs' took place six months afterwards. The underlying idea was, doubtless, that of Dahome: the potentate must not go, like a 'small boy,' alone and unattended to the shadowy realm. The 'African Cruiser' [Footnote: Journal of an African Cruiser, by an officer of the U.S. navy. Edited by Nathaniel Hawthorn. Aberdeen: Clark and Son, 1848.] speaks of the royal palace being sumptuously furnished in European style; of gold cups, pitchers, and plates, and of vast treasures in bullion. When the King died sixty victims were slain and buried with their liege lord; besides a <b>knife,</b> <b>plate,</b> and cup; swords, guns, cloths, and goods of various kinds. The corpse, smeared with oil and powdered cap-à-pié with gold-dust, looked like a statue of the noble ore.|$|E
50|$|The ferrule ends of {{the strings}} are held {{on the top of}} the guitar in a {{tailpiece}} plate called the <b>knife</b> <b>plate,</b> which emerges from the mechanism, rather than the strings vanishing into the mechanism as with the synchronized tremolo. It is the <b>knife</b> <b>plate</b> that is moved when the tremolo arm is operated. Unlike the synchronized tremolo, the bridge is not moved directly by the mechanism, but only by the movement of the strings, and is allowed to tilt to accommodate this movement. This is called a floating bridge.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Robots {{operating}} in domestic environments {{need to deal}} with a variety of different objects. Often, these objects are neither placed randomly, nor independently of each other. For example, objects on a breakfast table such as <b>plates,</b> <b>knives,</b> or bowls typically occur in recurrent configurations. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical generative model to reason about latent object constellations in a scene. The proposed model is a combination of a Dirichlet process and beta processes, which allows for a probabilistic treatment of the unknown dimensionality of the parameter space. We show how the model can be employed to address a set of different tasks in scene understanding including unsupervised scene segmentation and completion of partially specified scenes. We describe how to sample from the posterior distribution of the model using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques and present an experimental evaluation with simulated as well as real-world data obtained with a Kinect camera. Fig. 1. A scene typically contains several observable objects and the task is to infer the latent meta-objects where a meta-object {{is considered to be a}} constellation of observable objects. At a breakfast table, for example, the meta-objects might be the covers that consist of the observable objects <b>plate,</b> <b>knife,</b> fork, and cup. I...|$|R
