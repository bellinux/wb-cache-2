25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s foreign {{companies}} began transferring technology by licensing agreements {{and sales of}} equipment. Later in the 1980s many multinational corporations started transferring technology by entering into joint ventures with Chinese companies in order to expand in China. China in the 1990s introduced increasingly sophisticated regulations of foreign investment by which access to the Chinese market was traded for technology transfer. The entry of China <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Trade</b> Organization in 2001 required this practice stop but critics argue that it continues.

25|$|Other major {{problems}} concern {{the labor force}} and the pricing system. There is large-scale underemployment in both urban and rural areas, {{and the fear of}} the disruptive effects of major, explicit unemployment is strong. The prices of certain key commodities, especially of industrial raw materials and major industrial products, are determined by the state. In most cases, basic price ratios were set in the 1950s and are often irrational in terms of current production capabilities and demands. Over the years, large subsidies were built into the price structure and these subsidies grew substantially in the late 1970s and 1980s. By the early 1990s, these subsidies began to be eliminated, in large part due to China's admission <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Trade</b> Organization (WTO) in 2001, which carried with it requirements for further economic liberalization and deregulation.|$|E
25|$|Further {{developments}} in rethinking strategies and approaches to achieving the MDGs include {{research by the}} Overseas Development Institute {{into the role of}} equity. Researchers at the ODI argued that progress could be accelerated due to recent breakthroughs in the role equity plays in creating a virtuous circle where rising equity ensures the poor participate in their country's development and creates reductions in poverty and financial stability. Yet equity should not be understood purely as economic, but also as political. Examples abound, including Brazil's cash transfers, Uganda's eliminations of user fees and the subsequent huge increase in visits from the very poorest or else Mauritius's dual-track approach to liberalization (inclusive growth and inclusive development) aiding it on its road <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Trade</b> Organization. Researchers at the ODI thus propose equity be measured in league tables in order to provide a clearer insight into how MDGs can be achieved more quickly; the ODI is working with partners to put forward league tables at the 2010 MDG review meeting.|$|E

Its headquarters, at One World Financial Center, was severely damaged {{by the collapse of}} the World Trade Center just across the street. Top editors worried that they might miss publishing the first issue {{for the first time in}} the paper's 112-year history. They relocated to a makeshift office at an editor's home, while sending most of the staff to Dow Jones's South Brunswick, N.J., corporate campus, where the paper had established emergency editorial facilities soon after the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. The paper was on the stands the next day, albeit in scaled-down form. Perhaps the most compelling story in that day's edition was a first-hand account of the Twin Towers' collapse written by then-Foreign Editor (and current Washington bureau chief) John Bussey, who holed up in a ninth-floor Journal office, literally in the shadow of the towers, from where he phoned in live reports to CNBC as the towers burned. He narrowly escaped serious injury when the first tower collapsed, shattering all the windows in the Journal offices and filling them with dust and debris.

40|$|The author {{analyzes}} current {{trade policies}} and {{challenges faced by}} the transition economies - especially countries {{in the former soviet}} Union - as they are integrated <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>trading</b> system. With few exceptions, transition economies in Central and Eastern Europe, including the Baltics, have been well integrated <b>into</b> <b>the</b> multilateral trading system. Their trade regimes differ - and the main challenges they face involve their integration <b>into</b> <b>the</b> European Union. Integration <b>into</b> <b>the</b> multilateral trading system, including progress toward membership in <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Trade</b> Organization (WTO), varies significantly among the other countries of the former Soviet Union. Armenia, Georgia, the Kyrgyz Republic, and Moldova have adopted relatively liberal trade regimes and are either already members of the WTO or are close to it. These four countries need to strengthen the capacity of broad market-based (especially trade-related) institutions, including customs, the financial sector, and institutions to facilitate trade. The momentum for market and trade reform appearsto have stalled in some of the larger countries of the former Soviet Union: Kazakhstan, Russia, and Ukraine. Their trade regimes are not especially restrictive, but weak operations in fundamental market institutions inhibit their effective integration <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>trading</b> system. These problems, together with persistent protective pressures, inhibit progress and accession to the WTO. The remaining countries in Central Asia, as well as Belarus, have far to go in introducing market-oriented reforms and institutions, and the kind of trade liberalization needed for integration <b>into</b> international trade. <b>The</b> countries of the former Soviet Union must make most of the reform and adjustment effort, but WTO members must make changes as well - especially the United States and the European Union. Both need to review their policies toward non-market economies on antidumping practices and (in the European Union) on safeguards. Countries where market decisions prevail should not be subjected to non-transparent and arbitrary procedures. In particular, countries that have been judged to be"market"economies in the process of gaining access to the WTO should be excluded from procedures applied for antidumping and safeguard measures in non-market economies.

500|$|During {{the early}} 1990s, Madonna had {{focused on a}} number of provocative releases, like the erotic {{pictorial}} Sex book, the sadomasochist inspired album Erotica, and the erotic thriller, Body of Evidence, all of which she deduced was due to [...] "a lot of rage and anger" [...] within herself. However, {{by the beginning of the}} new millennium, Madonna was living a calmer, more introspective and wholesome life with her husband Guy Ritchie and their children Lourdes and Rocco. According to biographer J. Randy Taraborrelli, the presence of Ritchie in Madonna's life had a calming effect on the singer, making her more matured and easing her temper. Concentrating on her music career, Madonna was busy throughout of 2001 on her Drowned World Tour. On September 11, 2001, suicide bombers hijacked two jet airliners and crashed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Trade</b> Center, resulting in the death of nearly 3,000people. The event had a profound effect on American society, with the cultural mood being bleakness and paranoia. People, including Madonna, started asking questions about their culture and the American Dream, which had been a long-lasting ideal for many. When Madonna started working on her ninth studio album, American Life, she wanted answers to her queries and an appropriate response to the 9/11 disaster and the ensuing Iraq war of 2003. She believed that the ensuing months with the war would lead to a politically charged atmosphere throughout the country, and wanted to express that in the record.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the position of}} India in <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>trading</b> system. It considers three separate questions: Firstly, how integrated is India in <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>trade?</b> Secondly, what gains could India reap from further trade liberalization? Thirdly, what are the best means to achieve greater trade openness? The paper argues that while India's trade barriers have fallen since external sector reforms started in the early 1990 s, they remain high relative to most developing countries, in particular China. As a result, the volume and structure of trade in India have experienced a slower evolution away from quasi-autarkic patterns than China's. A survey of existing estimates {{of the effect of}} trade openness on economic growth and the quality of policy and governance suggests that India would have much to gain from further integration <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>trading</b> system. Finally, <b>the</b> paper assesses the scope for liberalization through unilateral, regional or multilateral means. The latter is both the most politically feasible path for further liberalization, and the most likely to deliver significant gains from trade. The extent to which India can shape upcoming multilateral negotiations, however, is unclear. ...|$|R
