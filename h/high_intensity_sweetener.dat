The individual 2 ̆ 7 s ability to detect or sense sweetness in the oral cavity {{is thought to be}} one of many factors influencing food acceptance, and therefore, taste may play an essential role in modulating food acceptance and/or energy intake. Emerging evidence now suggests that the sweet taste signaling mechanisms identified in the oral cavity also operate in the gastrointestinal system and may influence the development of satiety. Understanding the individual differences in detecting sweetness in both the oral and gastrointestinal system towards both caloric sugar and <b>high</b> <b>intensity</b> <b>sweetener</b> and the functional role of the sweet taste system may be important in understanding the reasons for excess energy intake. This review will summarize evidence of possible associations between the sweet taste mechanisms within the oral cavity, gastrointestinal tract and the brain systems towards both caloric sugar and <b>high</b> <b>intensity</b> <b>sweetener</b> and sweet taste function, which may influence satiation, satiety and, perhaps, predisposition to being overweight and obesity...|$|E

The mango nectar samples were sweetened with: acesulfame-K/sucralose/neotame blend (100 : 50 : 1), sucrose, stevia with 97 % rebaudioside, neotame, sucralose and a thaumatin/sucralose blend (1 : 1). The physicochemical analyses carried out included color (L*, a*, b*), pH, titratable acidity, soluble solids (°Brix) and ratio (Brix/titratable acidity). The sensory profile was studied using the Quantitative Descriptive Analysis (QDA). All analyses were carried out at Day zero, 60 days and 120 days of storage. The sensory descriptive and physicochemical data were correlated with an acceptance test by Partial least square (PLS) regression and External preference map (PREFMAP). Changes in sensory profile during storage time were also evaluated using Multiple Factor Analysis (MFA) and agreement between configurations was evaluated by Rv coefficient. Sucralose was shown to be the best substitute for sucrose when compared with the other <b>high</b> <b>intensity</b> <b>sweeteners</b> at both zero time and after 120 days of storage. The sample sweetened with sucralose showed acceptance (mean at storage time 6. 4) and sensory profile equal to control (sucrose).

40|$|The {{ability to}} taste 6 - n -propylthiouracil (PROP) is genetically determined. PROP tastes {{moderately}} bitter to 'medium tasters' (MT), intensely bitter to 'supertasters' (ST), and tasteless to 'nontasters' (NT). The psychophysical method used to characterize PROP status should capture {{the entire range}} of perception, while minimizing context, ceiling and other effects. Magnitude estimation successfully captures the variability in PROP perception, but requires normalization and may be difficult to conduct in industrial settings. Two labeled scales were tested as part of three separate studies (S 1, S 2 and S 3) to measure perceived intensity of PROP and sweeteners. All studies included reportedly healthy volunteers aged 21 - 62 years recruited at Cultor Food Science in Groton, CT. In S 1 [n = 163 (55 males, 108 females) ], subjects rated perceived intensity of PROP-saturated paper and sucrose (1. 0 M) on the Labeled Magnitude (Green) Scale (LMS) [labeled line with descriptors (no taste-strongest imaginable) ]. In S 2 [n = 152 (49 males, 103 females) ], subjects rated perceived intensity of sucrose (1. 0 M) and PROP solutions (0. 001 M, 0. 0032 M) on the LMS. In S 3 [n = 136 (48 males, 88 females) ], subjects rated perceived intensity of sucrose (1. 0 M) and PROP solutions (0. 001 M, 0. 0032 M) on a 9 -point category scale (1 = not al all; 9 = extremely). In all experiments, water rinses were included between each tastant and PROP was the final stimulus. Statistical analyses included descriptive statistics, regression analysis, and ANOVA. In S 1 and S 2, those with higher PROP perception perceived sucrose more intensely [(S 1 : r = 0. 32; p < 0. 001); (S 2 : r = 0. 25; p < 0. 01) ]. A higher frequency of females were ST than males. Also, the PROP effect on sweet perception was most evident in female ST. This apparent sex difference {{may be the result of}} hormonal variation associated with menstruation. As well, in S 1 and S 2 subjects aged 20 - 40 years, females had significantly greater variance among sucrose intensity ratings than males (F = 3. 66; p < 0. 01), which may be due to hormonal changes with menses. The S 3 results failed to show either the positive correlation between PROP and sucrose perception or the sex difference. Thus of the two labeled scales, the LMS appears to be better for assessing PROP perception, as it is continuous and also minimizes ceiling effects.

The conventional methods of isolation of steviosides involve long extraction and purification procedures; therefore optimization of product yields is a challenging problem. The present study, establishes a new improvised process of extraction of steviosides from the stevia leaves in which the dry treated leaves were grounded, defatted, and extracted through pressurized hot water extractor (PHWE), followed by purification and concentration of the sweet glycosides through ultra (UF) and nano (NF) membrane filtration in obtaining high (98. 2 %) purity steviosides. This process established “green” method for isolation of high quality steviol glycosides, with improved final yield is 10. 1 % from 11 % of crude leaf extract and observed the improved organoleptic and biological activity (antioxidant).

The essential function of food is to satisfy hunger {{and the need for}} essential nutrients. The contributions of macronutrients to appetite and satiety are described, as well as their impact on metabolism and energy balance.

At weaning, piglets were allocated to 18 pens (11 pigs/pen) based on BW, gender, and ancestry, and pens {{were randomly assigned to}} 3 treatments with 6 pens per treatment. The pens were equipped with computerized feeding stations. During the first 12 d, pigs were offered pelleted prestarter diets that were replaced at once by pelleted starter diets for the last 7 d of the 19 -d experimental period. The individual feed intake characteristics consisting of latency time (interval between weaning and first feed intake), initial feed intake (intake during the first 24 h following the first feed intake), the number of total visits per d, and the number of visits, in which feed was consumed, together with the time and the feed intake per visit were determined for all piglets. Performance traits and fecal consistency were determined per pen for d 0 to 5, d 5 to 12, and d 12 to 19, {{as well as for the}} total period (d 0 to 19). The initiation of feed intake was not affected by the addition of <b>high</b> <b>intensity</b> <b>sweeteners</b> to the diet. From 12 d post-weaning, dietary sweeteners caused the piglets to focus more on feed intake and less on exploratory behavior, as shown by the increased percentage of visits with feed intake in pigs fed the 3 D diet compared with those fed the Control diet (P = 0. 002). The overall daily feed intake increased with time, but was not affected by the addition of sweeteners. Nevertheless, dietary sweeteners prevented the depression of feed intake on d 8 and 10 post-weaning (d 8, P = 0. 013; d 10, P = 0. 014), which seemed to coincide with an improved fecal consistency score (d 5 to 12, P = 0. 11; d 12 to 19, P < 0. 001). However, the changes in feed intake characteristics and fecal consistency only resulted in numerical effects on post-weaning pig performance (ADFI, P = 0. 126; ADG, P = 0. 140).

40|$|Introduction: D-tagatose is {{a natural}} low-calorie bulk {{sweetener}} (1. 5 kcal/g) showing 92 % of the sweetness of sucrose. It is low glycaemic, non-cariogenic and has prebiotic properties. Besides this wide range of healthy benefits, D-tagatose can also be applied as flavour enhancer and flavour creator in many applications. Tagatose significantly reduces the lingering sweetness and the bitter and metallic off-flavour of <b>high</b> <b>intensity</b> <b>sweeteners.</b> The natural occurrence of D-tagatose is however too limited for the increasing interest in this alternative sweetener. Chemical production of D-tagatose from D-galactose is economically not feasible due to byproduct formation and complex waste water treatment steps. A biocatalysed process using an immobilised L-arabinose isomerase enzyme for galactose isomerisation is therefore part of this study. Materials and methods: A wild type L-arabinose isomerase from Geobacillus stearothermophilus is used as enzyme source for bioconversion of D-galactose to D-tagatose with Escherichia coli (BL 21) strain as expression host. Cells are harvested from culture broth by centrifugation and are resuspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7) or ringer solution. Different biomass concentrations are immobilised with 5 % v/v alginate in a 1 / 1 biomass/alginate volumetric ratio. Biomass concentration is varied between 1. 3 and 6. 5 %. Batch conversion experiments are performed in a thermostatic shaking bath at 60 °C. Bead concentration is varied between 10 and 30 %. A galactose solution of 360 g/l is used as substrate, containing 1 mM MnCl 2 as co-factor at pH 7. Samples are analysed by HPLC with refractive index detection. Results and discussion: Tagatose production increases with a higher biomass concentration immobilised in alginate. By varying the biomass concentration from 1. 3 to 6. 5 % at a bead concentration of 20 %, the tagatose concentration obtained after 24 hours increases from 27 to 65 g/l. The increase in tagatose production is however not linearly correlated to the biomass concentration. A similar conclusion can be drawn for {{the influence of the}} bead concentration. At a biomass concentration of 3. 3 % w/v, tagatose concentration increases from 29 to 56 g/l for an increase in bead concentration of 10 to 30 %. No significant influence of the diluent of the biomass is noticed on tagatose production. What’s innovative: An enzymatic bioprocess is developed and optimised for production of D-tagatose from D-galactose. Besides the unique benefits of tagatose for many food applications (low caloric value, low glycaemic, non-cariogenic and prebiotic properties, less lingering artificial sweetener aftertaste), the application of an L-arabinose isomerase for production of D-tagatose results in a highly selective and environmentally friendly production process, which is not yet available on the current industrial market. As sugar substitute, tagatose will help to control weight, tooth decay and will be a major help in comfort of diabetics. status: publishe...|$|R

Atrelado a isto, o mercado de sucos e néctares de frutas está sob um aumento significativo, o que tem atraído a atenção de agricultores, distribuidores e da indústria deste produto para saciar esta demanda. Entretanto, estes produtos estão associados à alta ingestão de sacarose proveniente da adição em sua elaboração, o que pode acarretar o desenvolvimento de doenças relacionadas ao consumo excessivo de calorias. A partir disto, este estudo objetivou analisar a aplicação de novos edulcorantes de em néctar de manga pelo estudo de perfil sensorial e físico-químico ao longo do tempo de estocagem. Neste estudo foram utilizadas amostras de néctar de manga elaboradas com polpa de manga congelada e água (1 : 1) adoçadas com sacarose, sucralose, estévia com 97 % de rebaudiosídeo, neotame, blend acessulfame-K/sucralose/neotame (100 : 50 : 1) e blend taumatina/sucralose (1 : 1), totalizando 6 amostras. O perfil físico-químico foi determinado por meio da análise de pH, acidez titulável, cor (L*, a*, b*) e sólidos solúveis (ºBrix). A análise sensorial foi composta por testes descritivos, Análise Descritiva Quantitativa (ADQ) e Análise Tempo-intensidade, além de testes afetivos com escala hedônica e escala do ideal. Além destes, para o estabelecimento de equivalência de doçura foi utilizado o teste sensorial Estimação de Magnitude. A análise estatística foi composta por Análise de Variância (ANOVA), Teste de média de Tukey com nível de significância de 5 % para as análises físico-químicas, ADQ, análise tempointensidade e teste afetivo com escala hedônica. O teste com escala do ideal foi analisado por distribuição em histogramas e os dados de estimação de {{magnitude}} utilizaram regressão linear em sua análise. Os provadores estabeleceram o valor de 6, 8 % de sacarose como a quantidade ideal para a intensidade de gosto doce. O neotame foi o edulcorante que apresentou maior poder adoçante, sendo 6026 mais doce que a sacarose, seguindo pela sucralose (627), blend taumatina/sucralose (549), blend acessulfame-K/sucralose/neotame (259) e estévia (134). Os testes físico-químicos e, em especial, a ADQ identificaram a sucralose como o edulcorante que melhor substituiu a sacarose, pois foi o aditivo que apresentou o menor número de diferenças em relação à amostra controle. A análise tempo-intensidade e os testes afetivos também identificaram a amostra sucralose com o melhor perfil relacionado ao estímulo gosto doce, com grande semelhança ao ocorrido com a sacarose e sendo esta a amostra com maior grau de aceitação no tempo zero e a única que se manteve desta forma após os 120 dias de estocagem. Em conclusão, a estévia apresentou melhorias em seu perfil quando comparadas a outros estudos, mas ainda abaixo do esperado para um substituinte de sacarose. A taumatina, uma proteína de origem vegetal apresentou bom perfil e é um aditivo que necessita de maiores estudos para melhoria de sua tecnologia. E, por fim, a sucralose, como já afirmado em outros trabalhos, é o edulcorante que melhor substitui a sacarose em sucos tropicais, sem sofrer alterações significativas após processamento térmico e ao longo do tempo de estocagemThe {{consumption of}} fruits and vegetable {{has been associated with}} low incidence of degenerative diseases, because protective effects has been linked with antioxidant compounds contained in these foods. Attached to this, the consumer market of fruit juices and nectars under a significant increase, which has attracted the attention of producers of these products to satisfy this demand. However, these products are associated with the high ingestion of sucrose from de addition in the elaboration, which may result in the development of diseases associated with the high consumption of calorie. From that, this study aimed to analyze the application of <b>high</b> <b>intensity</b> <b>sweeteners</b> in mango nectar by the sensory and physical-chemical profile during the storage time. Mango nectar samples were prepared with unsweetened mango frozen pulp and water (1 : 1). The samples were sweetened with different <b>high</b> <b>intensity</b> <b>sweeteners</b> and sucrose. The sweeteners were: Neotame; Sucralose; Stevia with 97 % of Rebaudioside; 1 : 1 Thaumatin/Sucralose blend; 100 : 50 : 1 Acesulfame-K/Sucralose/Neotame blend. The physical-chemical profile was determined by: pH, titratable acidity, color (L*, a*, b*), solids soluble (ºBrix). The sensory analysis was composed by descriptive analysis, Quantitative Descriptive Analysis (QDA) and Time-intensity Analysis (T-I), also consumer test with hedonic scale e just-about-right (JAR) scale. Magnitude estimation method was applied to establish the relative sweetness with sucrose. Statistical analysis was composed by analysis of variance and Tukey means test with 5 % of significant level to physical-chemical, QDA, T-I analysis, and consumer test. The JAR scale test was analyzed by histograms distribution and the results of magnitude estimation method through linear regression. The ideal sweetness analysis revealed that 6. 8 % was the ideal concentration of sucrose in the mango nectar. The relative sweetness analysis showed that Neotame presented the highest sweetening power, being 6026 times sweeter than sucrose, followed by Sucralose (627), Thaumatin/Sucralose blend 1 : 1 (549), Acesulfame-K/Sucralose/Neotame blend 100 : 50 : 1 (259) and Stevia (134). The physical-chemical analysis and, in special, the QDA identified sucralose as the best sweetener which best sucrose substitutes, since this additive presented less differences in relation to control sample. T-I analysis and consumers test also identified the sample sucralose with best profile in relation to the sweet stimulus, with great similarity to control sample and being the sample with higher acceptability in initial time and the only one that has remained this way after 120 days of storage. In conclusion, the stevia presented improvements in its sensory profile when compared with others studies,although still lower than expected to a sucrose substitute. The thaumatin, a vegetal protein, presented good sensory profile and is a additive that requires more studies to improve its knowledges.

40|$|Generally, {{to reduce}} calorie {{content of a}} food, fat and sugar are reduced or removed and, subsequently, {{replaced}} with other components. Calorie can also ideally reduced in a food, through the incorporation of {{a certain amount of}} air, to obtain a product with the same volume but with a different weight and consequently a reduced calorie content. Considering that lipids and sugar play many roles in food, the reduction or substitution of these ingredients may affect both sensory and physical properties of modified foods. The aim of the thesis was the calorie reduction in food. The research have been focused on: the characterization of a new sweet protein, as alternative to sugar, particularly, for beverage industry application; the optimization of a fat replacer system for fat based fillings. The first study case focused on the sensory characterization of MNEI, obtained by recombinant expression in cells of E. coli with high yields. Since MNEI is an <b>High</b> <b>Intensity</b> <b>Sweeteners</b> (HIS) it could be used in the beverage industry meeting the consumer needs about the low calorie content and the sweetness of beverage. Thus, the specific objectives of this study were, first, the determination of taste detection (DT) and recognition threshold (RT) of MNEI in different conditions typical of beverage processing and of beverage consumption, concerning mineral content, serving temperature of the product, pH and thermal treatment, and then to compare dynamic sensory performance of MNEI, with that of aspartame, saccharin and sucrose. A selected panel evaluated DT and RT of MNEI by using a modified version of difference from Reference method. Through the modified method, assessors were also asked to give a qualitative information about the perceived taste, thus it was also possible to obtain the RT of MNEI. Then, equi-sweet concentrations of different sweeteners were found through difference from Reference method, by using a selected panel. Next sweeteners, at those concentrations, were analysed thought time-Intensity (t-I) and Temporal Dominance of Sensation (TDS), to determinate sweetness evolution over time and the interaction between sweetness and other stimuli, respectively, by using a trained panel. The results demonstrated that MNEI DT and RT were much lower than those of sucrose. Besides, both mineral content and serving temperature affected MNEI DT, whereas pH and thermal treatment did not affect perceived sweetness. The modified version of difference from Reference method was useful for RT determination. Equi-sweetness values of MNEI and of three market sweeteners were determined. Time-Intensity results showed that MNEI differed from sucrose, meanwhile TDS results showed that, in presence of other stimuli, these differences were reduced. The dominant attributes of model beverages were the same for all sweeteners. In the other study case the effect of different sugar and milk proteins on some properties of a fat-based filling cream were investigated by using a three-component (icing sugar, dextrose monohydrate, skimmed milk powder) D-optimal mixture design. The best formulation was used as reference and powders percentage were considered the constant ingredients. In order to reduce calorie content, a D-optimal mixture design with five component (water, margarine, simplesse, microcrystalline cellulose and maltodextrin) was used, 25 formulations resulted. As response variables, aw, density, colour parameters and mechanical parameters were evaluated. The best formulation was chosen through the desirability function to determine areas of overlap where all responses were simultaneously optimized. To validate the model, formulations in the optimized region were prepared and submitted to a paired t –test (p ≤ 0. 05).

Flavor {{is one of}} the most important attributes influencing food choice. In confectionery products, a major focus on product innovation involves developing more desirable flavor attributes for maximum impact and duration as well as providing healthier products. In addition to advances in flavor technology, the confectionery industry has moved towards products that are sugar-free by utilizing polyols (sugar alcohols) instead of traditional sugar ingredients, such as sucrose or glucose. Polyols, like sugar, provide sweetness to a confectionery product and can also impact the product performance in multiple ways such as the texture and the flavor release properties. Currently there is limited knowledge on how polyols alter flavor delivery and ultimately impedes product innovation. The overall objective of this thesis was to investigate the influence of polyols on delivery of flavor components, volatiles (aroma) and non-volatiles (taste), in confectionery products. As an initial study (presented in Chapter 3) a model confectionery product was formulated with different polyols: xylitol, mannitol or sorbitol that ranged in physical-chemical properties. Release of volatile and non-volatile flavor components was monitored close to the respective biological receptors of three trained panelists over a 12 min mastication period. Real-time release of volatile flavor compounds (aroma) were measured in exhaled breath by APCI-MS analysis, and non-volatile flavor compounds (taste, polyols and <b>high</b> <b>intensity</b> <b>sweeteners,</b> HIS: acesulfame K and aspartame) were monitored in expectorated saliva by LC/MS/MS analysis. In general, the rate of delivery of both aroma and taste components were inversely related to the water solubility of the polyol utilized. The flavor release profiles for both the aroma and HIS compounds were highest for the sample formulated with the least water-soluble polyol (mannitol) and lowest for sample with the most water-soluble polyol (sorbitol). Time-intensity sensory evaluation of these samples was also in agreement with the instrumental data supporting the observed chemical changes in flavor delivery resulted in changes in flavor perception. Based on the observation that water solubility of polyols influenced flavor delivery, we further hypothesized that surface area of the polyol material would also influence the flavor release profile. In chapter 4, the influence of polyol-type and particle size on the flavor release profile in a sugar-free confection was investigated in vivo. Four samples with an average particle size of 62 or 246 μm (sorbitol) and 57 or 184 μm (mannitol) were analyzed. Two trained panelists masticated the samples at a controlled chewing rate for 12 minutes period. APCI-MS analysis of the expired breath reported the samples formulated with mannitol, in general, had a higher aroma release profile than when formulated with sorbitol. LC/MS analysis of the expectorated saliva reported the HIS had a significantly higher release profile for the smaller polyol particle size samples; the release rate of polyol was not significantly changed by the particle size. Sensory time-intensity analysis of the sorbitol samples was also in agreement with the HIS delivery, the smaller particle size sorbitol gum was significantly higher in perceived sweetness intensity (compared to the larger particle sized sample). In summary, unique polyol-flavor interactions were reported to alter flavor delivery; the aroma compounds were mainly influenced by the polyol-type whereas the HIS by particle size (surface area). In the final research phase the mechanisms of flavor delivery in confections were further investigated by conducting a mass balance analysis of the volatile and non-volatile flavor compounds during a 12 min mastication of samples formulated with sorbitol of two particle sizes (Chapter 5). The mass and release rate of the volatile compounds (ethyl butyrate, benzaldehyde, menthol, menthone and limonene) were monitored in the exhaled breath, in the saliva and the sample bolus; whereas the non-volatiles compounds (sorbitol or mannitol, aspartame and acesulfame K) were monitored in the expectorated saliva and the sample bolus. In general, the percent recovery of the volatile compounds released during mastication was lower or was less quantifiable in comparison to the more polar non-volatile compounds. For the volatile compounds analyzed, the medium hydrophobicity region showed the lowest % recovery (90 %). The release profile of both the polyol (sorbitol) and HIS compounds were reported not to be concentration dependent during the first 4 minutes of mastication. This suggested the polyol and HIS were physically entrapped in the sample matrix and the release mechanism was related to the surface exposure rate these compounds to the oral cavity during chewing (mechanical stress) for release to occur during mastication. In summary, we have reported novel mechanisms by which polyols influence the delivery of the aroma and taste compounds in sugar-free confectionery products as well as oral processing mechanisms that govern flavor delivery (absorption in the oral cavity). This information provides new knowledge for the food (and pharmaceutical) industry to tailor product quality...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Work-site {{strength}} training sessions are shown effective {{to prevent and}} reduce neck-shoulder pain in computer workers, but difficult to integrate in normal working routines. A solution for avoiding neck-shoulder pain during computer work may be to implement <b>high</b> <b>intensity</b> voluntary contractions during the computer work. However, it is unknown how this may influence productivity, rate of perceived exertion (RPE) as well as activity and rest of neck-shoulder muscles during computer work. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate short-term effects of a <b>high</b> <b>intensity</b> contraction on productivity, RPE and upper trapezius activity and rest during computer work and a subsequent pause from computer work. Methods 18 female computer workers performed 2 sessions of 15 min standardized computer mouse work preceded by 1 min pause with and without prior <b>high</b> <b>intensity</b> contraction of shoulder elevation. RPE was reported, productivity (drawings per min) measured, and bipolar surface electromyography (EMG) recorded from the dominant upper trapezius during pauses and sessions of computer work. Repeated measure ANOVA with Bonferroni corrected post-hoc tests was applied for the statistical analyses. Results The main findings were that a <b>high</b> <b>intensity</b> shoulder elevation did not modify RPE, productivity or EMG activity of the upper trapezius during the subsequent pause and computer work. However, the <b>high</b> <b>intensity</b> contraction reduced the relative rest time of the uppermost (clavicular) trapezius part during the subsequent pause from computer work (p Conclusion Since a preceding <b>high</b> <b>intensity</b> shoulder elevation did not impose a negative impact on perceived effort, productivity or upper trapezius activity during computer work, implementation of <b>high</b> <b>intensity</b> contraction during computer work to prevent neck-shoulder pain may be possible without affecting the working routines.
