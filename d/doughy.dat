50|$|Pakoras {{are popular}} across South Asia and Great Britain (particularly in Scotland). They are {{sometimes}} {{served in a}} yogurt-based gravy (curry), as a main dish pakora curry, {{rather than as a}} separate snack. In this case, the pakoras are generally <b>doughier</b> and are made from chopped potato, onion, and chili mixed into the batter, instead of individual fried vegetable slices.|$|R
25|$|It is {{traditionally}} shaped by {{hand into the}} form of a ring from yeasted wheat dough, roughly hand-sized, that is first boiled for a short time in water and then baked. The result is a dense, chewy, <b>doughy</b> interior with a browned and sometimes crisp exterior. Bagels are often topped with seeds baked on the outer crust, with the traditional ones being poppy or sesame seeds. Some may have salt sprinkled on their surface, and there are different dough types, such as whole-grain or rye.|$|E

500|$|Since {{the last}} quarter of the 20th century, with a re-emergence of wealth in Ireland, a [...] "New Irish Cuisine" [...] based on {{traditional}} ingredients incorporating international influences has emerged. This cuisine is based on fresh vegetables, fish (especially salmon, trout, oysters, mussels and other shellfish), as well as traditional soda breads and the wide range of hand-made cheeses that are now being produced across the country. An example of this new cuisine is [...] "Dublin Lawyer": lobster cooked in whiskey and cream.

50|$|Mochi is {{relatively}} simple {{to make as}} {{there are only a}} handful of ingredients for plain, natural mochi. The main ingredient is either Shiratamako or Mochiko, Japanese sweet glutinous rice flours. Both Shiratamako and Mochiko are made from Mochigome, a type of Japanese glutinous short grain rice. The difference between Shiratamako and Mochiko comes from texture and processing methods. Shiratamako flour has been more refined and is a finer flour with a smoother, more elastic feel. Mochiko is less refined and has a <b>doughier</b> texture.|$|R

50|$|A dim sim is a Chinese-inspired {{meat and}} {{vegetable}} dumpling-style snack food, popular in Australia {{and to a}} lesser extent in New Zealand. The commercial snack food normally consists of minced meat (pork or lamb or chicken), cabbage, and seasoning, encased in a wrapper similar to that of a traditional shumai dumpling. They can be served deep-fried or steamed and are commonly dressed or dipped in soy sauce. An alternative way of cooking dim sims is to barbecue them, by cutting the dim sim in half along the long side and placing on a hot BBQ. Vegetarian-style dim sim normally contains cabbage, carrot, vermicelli, chinese shiitake mushroom or other vegetable fillings, along with seasoning, although these are not generally available in commercial outlets. Dim sims differ from typical Chinese dumplings in that they are often much larger, have a thicker, <b>doughier</b> skin and are shaped more robustly.|$|R

2500|$|Cuzzoni's {{arrival in}} the English capital was keenly {{anticipated}} in the press. Though the [...] "London Journal" [...] for 27 October 1722 reported that [...] "Mrs. Cotsona , an extraordinary Italian Lady, ... is expected daily", she apparently found time to marry Pietro Giuseppe Sandoni during her journey, and did not make her debut in London until 12 January 1723, creating the role of Teofane in Handel's Ottone at the King's Theatre, Haymarket. To an aria in her role, [...] "Falsa immagine", there is attached a famous story, vividly illustrating both her character {{and that of the}} composer. The part not having been originally intended for her (but perhaps for Maddalena Salvai), at rehearsal she refused to sing this, her first aria. According to the historian John Mainwaring, Handel replied: [...] "Oh! Madame I know well that you are a real she-devil, but I hereby give you notice, me, that I am Beelzebub, the Chief of Devils." [...] Mainwaring continued: [...] "With this, he took her up by the waist, and, if she made any more words, swore that he would fling her out of the window." [...] According to Burney, her singing of this aria [...] "fixed her reputation as an expressive and pathetic singer", and her success was such that the price of half-guinea opera tickets reportedly shot up to four guineas. By the time of her benefit concert only two months later, some noblemen were believed to be giving her fifty guineas a ticket. Her salary was also large: £2000 a season. Her appearance was no recommendation: Burney described her as [...] "short and squat, with a <b>doughy</b> cross face, but fine complexion; ... not a good actress; dressed ill and was silly and fantastical." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{provinces of}} North Holland, South Holland, Zeeland, Utrecht and the Gelderlandic region of Betuwe are {{the parts of}} the Netherlands which make up the region in which western Dutch cuisine is found. Because of the {{abundance}} of water and flat grass lands that are found here, the area is known for its many dairy products, which includes prominent cheeses such as Gouda, Leyden (spiced cheese with cumin), Edam (traditionally in small spheres) as well as Leerdammer and Beemster, while the adjacent Zaanstreek in North Holland is since the 16th century known for its mayonnaise, typical whole-grain mustards and chocolate industry. Zeeland and South Holland produce a lot of butter, which contains a larger amount of milkfat than most other European butter varieties. A by-product of the butter-making process, karnemelk (buttermilk), is also considered typical for this region. Seafood such as soused herring, mussels (called Zeeuwse Mossels, since all Dutch mussels for consumption are cleaned in Zeeland's Oosterschelde), eels, oysters and shrimps are widely available and typical for the region. , once a local delicacy consisting of small chunks of battered white fish, has become a national fast food, just as [...] Pastries in this area tend to be quite <b>doughy,</b> and often contain large amounts of sugar; either caramelised, powdered or crystallised.

A noted exception within the traditional Dutch alcoholic landscape, Advocaat, a rich and creamy liqueur made from eggs, sugar and brandy, is also native to this region.|$|E
60|$|Having said {{so much as}} this in {{compliance}} with the frequent American pretence that the English are without humor, I wish to hedge in the interest of truth. They certainly are not so constantly joking as we; it does not apparently seem to them that fate can be propitiated by a habit of pleasantry, or that this is so merry a world that one need go about grinning in it. Perhaps the conditions with most of them are harder than the conditions with most of us. But, thinking of certain Englishmen I have known, I should be ashamed to join in the cry of those story- telling Americans whose jokes have sometimes fallen effectless. It is true that, wherever the Celt has leavened the <b>doughier</b> Anglo-Saxon lump, the expectation of a humorous sympathy is greater; but there are subtile spirits of Teutonic origin whose fineness we cannot deny, whose delicate gayety is of a sort which may well leave ours impeaching itself of a heavier and grosser fibre.|$|R

Still better did it seem to see Alice smiling upon me across the flowers in the glasses and sparkling silver, and Martin Lorimer's cheery face as, while he pressed the good things upon me, we chatted of old times and England.

60|$|At {{a certain}} {{season of the}} year, when {{the fruit of the}} hundred groves of the valley has reached its maturity, and hangs in golden spheres from every branch, the islanders {{assemble}} in harvest groups, and garner in the abundance which surrounds them. The trees are stripped of their nodding burdens, which, easily freed from the rind and core, are gathered together in capacious wooden vessels, where the pulpy fruit is soon worked by a stone pestle, vigorously applied, into a blended mass of a <b>doughy</b> consistency called by the natives “Tutao.” This is then divided into separate parcels, which, after being made up into stout packages, enveloped in successive folds of leaves, and bound round with thongs of bark, are stored away in large receptacles hollowed in the earth, from whence they are drawn as occasion may require.|$|E
60|$|Until {{daylight}} Nasmyth made a tolerable pace.

It did not take long to boil a can of strong green tea, and to prepare a piece of <b>doughy</b> bread, with a little salt pork, for his breakfast.

As though he had been called into existence, like a fabulous Familiar, by a magic spell which had failed when required to dismiss him, he stuck tight to Mr. Grewgious’s stool, although Mr. Grewgious’s comfort and convenience would manifestly have been advanced by dispossessing him. A gloomy person with tangled locks, and a general air of having been reared under the shadow of that baleful tree of Java which has given shelter to more lies than the whole botanical kingdom, Mr. Grewgious, nevertheless, treated him with unaccountable consideration.|$|E
60|$|Then {{presently}} {{he would}} meet {{a man or a}} woman, yellow-faced and probably negligently dressed and armed--prowling for food. These people would have the complexions and eyes and expressions of tramps or criminals, and often the clothing of prosperous middle-class or upper-class people. Many of these would be eager for news, and willing to give help and even scraps of queer meat, or crusts of grey and <b>doughy</b> bread, in return for it. They would listen to Bert's story with avidity, and attempt to keep him with them for a day or so. The virtual cessation of postal distribution and the collapse of all newspaper enterprise had left an immense and aching gap in the mental life of this time.

I can only describe it as a hash of soaked bread and bits of tobacco, brought to a <b>doughy</b> consistency by the united agency of perspiration and rain. But repulsive as it might otherwise have been, I now regarded it as an invaluable treasure, and proceeded with great care to transfer this paste-like mass to a large leaf which I had plucked from a bush beside me. Toby informed me that in the morning he had placed two whole biscuits in his bosom, with a view of munching them, should he feel so inclined, during our flight. These were now reduced to the equivocal substance which I had just placed on the leaf.|$|E

60|$|Many a good thing, however, is spoiled in the oven. We cannot but regret, for {{the sake}} of bread, that our old steady brick ovens have been almost universally {{superseded}} by those of ranges and cooking-stoves, which are infinite in their caprices, and forbid all general rules. One thing, however, may be borne in mind as a principle,--that the excellence of bread in all its varieties, plain or sweetened, depends on the perfection of its air-cells, whether produced by yeast, egg, or effervescence; that one of the objects of baking is to fix these air-cells, and that the quicker this can be done through the whole mass, the better will the result be. When cake or bread is made heavy by baking too quickly, it is because the immediate formation of the top crust hinders the exhaling of the moisture in the centre, and prevents the air-cells from cooking. The weight also of the crust pressing down on the <b>doughy</b> air-cells below destroys them, producing that horror of good cooks, a heavy streak. The problem in baking, then, is the quick application of heat rather below than above the loaf, and its steady continuance till all the air-cells are thoroughly dried into permanent consistency. Every housewife must watch her own oven to know how this can be best accomplished.|$|E
60|$|To be brief, he accosted one of {{the many}} surly overseers, or taskmasters of the yard, who, with no few pompous airs, finally engaged him at six shillings a week, almost {{equivalent}} to a dollar and a half. He was appointed to {{one of the}} mills for grinding up the ingredients. This mill stood in the open air. It was of a rude, primitive, Eastern aspect, consisting of a sort of hopper, emptying into a barrel-shaped receptacle. In the barrel was a clumsy machine turned round at its axis by a great bent beam, like a well-sweep, only it was horizontal; to this beam, at its outer end, a spavined old horse was attached. The muddy mixture was shovelled into the hopper by spavined-looking old men, while, trudging wearily round and round, the spavined old horse ground it all up till it slowly squashed out {{at the bottom of the}} barrel, in a <b>doughy</b> compound, all ready for the moulds. Where the dough squeezed out of the barrel a pit was sunken, so as to bring the moulder here stationed down to a level with the trough, into which the dough fell. Israel was assigned to this pit. Men came to him continually, reaching down rude wooden trays, divided into compartments, each of the size and shape of a brick. With a flat sort of big ladle, Israel slapped the dough into the trays from the trough; then, with a bit of smooth board, scraped the top even, and handed it up. Half buried there in the pit, all the time handing those desolate trays, poor Israel seemed some gravedigger, or churchyard man, tucking away dead little innocents in their coffins on one side, and cunningly disinterring them again to resurrectionists stationed on the other.|$|E
