5000|$|With some {{automatic}} transmissions, it {{was possible}} to place the shift selector at any point, either in an intended gear or between a gear. Because of the possible safety issue of this, and because driving a vehicle not fully in a gear {{over a long period of}} time could damage the transmission, automakers developed what is called the [...] "detent system." [...] The system of detents was often used in conjunction with the [...] "push button" [...] shifters used on many automatics in the 1950s. Typical detent systems use either a <b>detent</b> <b>spring</b> and ball or a cantilever spring and this spring moves up and down over a series of teethed gears (called a [...] "rooster comb" [...] for how it looks, or an [...] "inner manuel lever") turning the rooster comb to fine center the transmission in the intended gear position at the bottom of each gear.|$|E
25|$|In 1782, Arnold {{took out}} another patent {{to protect the}} latest and most {{important}} inventions, which were potentially lucrative. Several other watchmakers, most notably Thomas Earnshaw, had started to copy Arnold's work. Around 1780, Earnshaw modifyied his detent escapement by mounting the <b>detent</b> on a <b>spring</b> to create the <b>spring</b> <b>detent</b> escapement.|$|R
25|$|Another part of {{the patent}} {{concerned}} the escapement—a modification of Arnold's pivoted detent escapement that essentially mounted the <b>detent</b> on a <b>spring.</b> The specification only shows the part of this escapement that is the method of impulse on the impulse roller.|$|R
2500|$|Therefore, {{there has}} {{been a great deal of}} debate over who invented the <b>spring</b> <b>detent</b> escapement, Arnold or Earnshaw. This argument, first {{initiated}} by Earnshaw, has been continued by horological historians (such as Rupert Gould) to present day. However, the argument is irrelevant.|$|R
25|$|Nevertheless, a year later, in 1783, Earnshaw—through another watchmaker, Thomas Wright—took out {{a patent}} that {{included}} Earnshaw's pattern of integral compensation balance and <b>spring</b> <b>detent</b> escapement in the multiple specification. However, {{both of these}} were undeveloped and compared to Arnold's were of little use, the balance especially having to be redesigned.|$|R
25|$|In 1780, {{while making}} these {{chronometers}} for Brockbank, Earnshaw modified the pivoted detent by mounting the locking piece on a spring, thus dispensing with the pivots. Arnold managed {{to see this}} new idea and promptly took out the 1782 patent for his own design of <b>spring</b> <b>detent,</b> {{but it is not}} known whether this preceded Earnshaw's own idea.|$|R
50|$|The AKMP rifle uses subdued Radium-illuminated aiming points {{integrated}} into {{the front and rear}} sight. These sights enable targets to be engaged in low-light conditions, e.g. when the battlefield is illuminated with flares, fires or muzzle flashes or when the target is visible as a shadow against an illuminated background. The sliding notch on the sight arm is then moved to the “S” setting (which corresponds to the “3” setting in the AKM). The sight itself is guided on the sliding scale and has a socket, which contains a tritium gas-filled capsule directly beneath the day-time notch. The tritium front post installs into the front sight base using a <b>detent</b> and <b>spring.</b>|$|R
50|$|Eventually, {{after much}} argument, the Board of Longitude granted Earnshaw and Arnold awards for their {{improvements}} to chronometers. Earnshaw received £2500 and John Arnold's son, John Roger Arnold, received £1672. The bimetallic compensation balance and the <b>spring</b> <b>detent</b> escapement in the forms designed by Earnshaw {{have been used}} essentially universally in marine chronometers since then. For this reason, Earnshaw is also generally {{regarded as one of}} the pioneers of chronometer development.|$|R
50|$|In 1780, he {{devised a}} {{modification}} to the detached chronometer escapement, the detent being {{mounted on a}} spring instead of on pivots. This <b>spring</b> <b>detent</b> escapement was patented by Thomas Wright (for whom he worked) in 1783. Whilst initially the design was crude and unsuccessful, with modifications it later became the standard form in marine chronometers, following {{the invention of the}} detent escapement by Pierre Le Roy in 1748. John Arnold also invented a similar escapement in 1782.|$|R
5000|$|A more {{sophisticated}} method of presetting torque {{is with a}} calibrated clutch mechanism. One common form uses a ball <b>detent</b> and <b>spring,</b> with the spring preloaded by an adjustable screw thread, calibrated in torque units. The ball detent transmits force until the preset torque is reached, {{at which point the}} force exerted by the spring is overcome and the ball [...] "clicks" [...] out of its socket. The advantage of this design is greater precision and both tangible and audible feedback on reaching the desired torque. The wrench will not start slipping once the desired torque is reached, it will only click and bend slightly at the head, the operator can continue to apply torque to the wrench without any additional action or warnings from the wrench. For this reason, it is important to stop applying torque as soon as the wrench gives the click sound.|$|R
50|$|The SU-16A has an 18.4 in {{barrel and}} comes with a windage-adjustable hooded light-gathering blade front sight mounted near the muzzle. A Picatinny rail is {{equipped}} {{on the top of}} the receiver. The stock and trigger mechanism fold down below the upper receiver and clamp to the barrel when the weapon is broken down (the weapon is non-operative when in this configuration). The fore-arm of the rifle opens out into an integrated collapsible bipod. The stock has a hollow recess with <b>spring</b> <b>detents</b> capable of holding two 10-round magazines or one 20- or 30-round magazine.|$|R
40|$|Author for {{correspondence}} Instrument {{controls in}} motor vehicles have haptic properties (force and compliance) {{designed to enhance}} the ease of use. In conventional control knobs, these properties are obtained mechanically via <b>springs,</b> <b>detents,</b> hard stops and the like. The work reported here concerns {{the use of a}} single force-feedback knob to emulate the feel of various conventional control knobs, thus retaining their desirable haptic properties while allowing multiple functions to be controlled through one device. Compared to existing haptic knobs, this one is novel in its use of a brake to provide high torque capability in a small volume...|$|R
2500|$|These {{included}} {{his balance}} designs, helical springs {{made of steel}} or gold, the <b>spring</b> <b>detent</b> escapement, the overcoil balance spring, and even the layout of an Arnold dial design that Breguet incorporated into his own. These were made from engine-turned gold or silver—a pattern that became the classic and distinctive Breguet dial. Arnold's pattern first appeared in 1783, on the enamel dials Arnold designed for his small chronometers, and the proportions and layout of their figuring is identical {{to that of the}} classic [...] "Breguet" [...] type of engine turned metal dials which appeared around 1800, and which were quite unlike anything else made in France or Switzerland at the time.|$|R
50|$|Therefore, {{there has}} {{been a great deal of}} debate over who invented the <b>spring</b> <b>detent</b> escapement, Arnold or Earnshaw. This argument, first {{initiated}} by Earnshaw, has been continued by horological historians (such as Rupert Gould) to present day. However, the argument is irrelevant. In recent years, research has established that Arnold's success was not due to the form of detent escapement, but to his original methods of adjusting the balance spring for positional errors by manipulating the overcoil terminal curve. For obvious reasons, Arnold tried to keep these methods secret, certainly it is recorded that he clearly expressed his concerns about possible plagiarism to Earnshaw, warning him in no uncertain terms not to use his Helical balance spring.|$|R
500|$|Nautical {{chronometers}} were {{of great}} importance in the 18th and 19th centuries as aids to navigation. [...] Accurate measurement of time was needed for the determination of longitude. [...] Earnshaw {{was not the first}} to make such chronometers, but {{he was one of the}} first to make them cheaply enough that they started to become essential equipment for a ship at sea. [...] By the time the Beagle set sail it was being reported in The Nautical Magazine that the price of chronometers was dropping rapidly while the same quality was being maintained. [...] Earnshaws' chronometer had a novel escapement mechanism, the <b>spring</b> <b>detent</b> escapement, and a bimetallic strip for temperature compensation so that it would continue to maintain accuracy in all climates around the world.|$|R
50|$|The carbine {{also has}} a {{different}} sighting arrangement than the Tantal rifle, with a newly designed rear sight. The open-type flip sight with both 100-200 and 400 m settings is installed {{at the rear of}} an extended sight rail protected by ears, which is riveted to the rear sight base. The sight has two settings, “1 i 2” and “4” (that correspond to firing ranges from 100 to 200 m and 400 m respectively). The flip sight locks in position with a <b>spring</b> <b>detent.</b> The adjustable front sight post is screwed into the front sight base that is installed in the gas block. The Onyks can be fitted with tritium night sights, similar to those used in the wz. 88 Tantal. Recesses cut into both sides of the sight rail are used to mount optical sights.|$|R
50|$|The non-reciprocating {{cocking handle}} is located above the {{handguard}} and protrudes from the cocking handle tube at approximately a 45° angle. This rigid control {{is attached to}} a tubular piece within the cocking lever housing called the cocking lever support, which in turn, makes contact with the forward extension of the bolt group. It is not however connected to the bolt carrier and therefore cannot be used as a forward assist to fully seat the bolt group. The cocking handle is held in a forward position by a <b>spring</b> <b>detent</b> located in {{the front end of the}} cocking lever support which engages in the cocking lever housing. The lever is locked back by pulling it fully to the rear and rotating it slightly clockwise where it can be hooked into an indent in the cocking lever tube.|$|R
40|$|This {{invention}} {{relates to}} a preload release mechanism comprising a preload spring assembly adapted {{to apply a}} preload to a first connector member which is mounted on a support structure and adapted for connection with a second connector member on an object. The assembly comprises telescoped bushings and a preload spring. A tubular shaft extends through the spring assembly and openings in the first connector member and support structure, on which it is clamped. A plunger rod in the shaft is provided with a tip end and a recess in the rod near the other end thereof. A retainer precludes passage of the rod through the shaft {{in one direction and}} an end cap closes the bore of the shaft at the other end and provides a shoulder which extends radially of the shaft. A plunger return spring biases the plunger rod against the plunger retainer with the plunger tip protruding from the shaft and a spring assembly return spring engages at its ends the shoulder of the end cap and one end of the <b>spring</b> assembly. <b>Detents</b> received in lateral openings in the tubular shaft are held captive by the plunger rod and one end of the spring assembly to lock the spring assembly on the tubular shaft and apply a preload to the first connector member. Upon completion of the connection, <b>detents</b> and <b>spring</b> assembly are released by plunger contact with the object to be connected, thereby releasing the preload while the connection is maintained...|$|R

50|$|The detent or {{chronometer}} escapement {{is considered}} the most accurate of the balance wheel escapements, and was used in marine chronometers, although some precision watches during the 18th and 19th century also used it. The early form was invented by Pierre Le Roy in 1748, who created a pivoted detent type of escapement, though this was theoretically deficient. The first effective design of detent escapement was invented by John Arnold around 1775, but with the detent pivoted. This escapement was modified by Thomas Earnshaw in 1780 and patented by Wright (for whom he worked) in 1783, however as depicted in the patent it was unworkable. Arnold also designed a <b>spring</b> <b>detent</b> escapement but, with improved design, Earnshaw's version eventually prevailed as the basic idea underwent several minor modifications {{during the last decade}} of the 18th century. The final form appeared around 1800, and this design was used until mechanical chronometers became obsolete in the 1970s.|$|R

50|$|In {{the period}} 1808-1822 almost all watches using the échappement naturel were {{constructed}} on 4-minute tourbillon carriages, with 12+3 escape teeth, reversed fusees and <b>sprung</b> <b>detent</b> locking and {{were made to}} a similar pattern. The watches were large, typically 60-65mm in diameter and a distinguishing feature was their dials. These nearly all had a short hour hand indicating on a small central chapter ring and a large minute hand with a minute ring {{at the edge of}} the dial, see watches 1187 and 1188 in Daniels. It is possible that the low price for the watch for the Bishop of Cambrai was because of their personal friendship. Judging by the rather modest mark-up of ~25% that Breguet applied to his workshop costs for other watches with this escapement, he might even have made a loss in this case. Breguet sold the Bishop another tourbillon watch, number 2436, for the same price but this one had a constant force escapement.During the period in which these watches were being sold (1808-1821), a few dozen tourbillon watches were being produced, about half with a lever escapement on a 1-minute carriage and the rest with a variety of escapements, a detent escapement on a 6-minute or 4-minute carriage, a couple with a constant force escapement and at least one with a Robin escapement. The sale of watches with tourbillon movements ceased after Breguet’s death in 1823.|$|R
50|$|The {{escapement}} serves two purposes. First, {{it allows}} the train to advance fractionally and record the balance's oscillations. At the same time, it supplies minute amounts of energy to counter tiny losses from friction, thus maintaining {{the momentum of the}} oscillating balance. The escapement is the part that ticks. Since the natural resonance of an oscillating balance serves as the heart of a chronometer, chronometer escapements are designed to interfere with the balance as little as possible. There are many constant-force and detached escapement designs, but the most common are the <b>spring</b> <b>detent</b> and pivoted detent. In both of these, a small detent locks the escape wheel and allows the balance to swing completely free of interference except for a brief moment at the centre of oscillation, when it is least susceptible to outside influences. At the centre of oscillation, a roller on the balance staff momentarily displaces the detent, allowing one tooth of the escape wheel to pass. The escape wheel tooth then imparts its energy on a second roller on the balance staff. Since the escape wheel turns in only one direction, the balance receives impulse in only one direction. On the return oscillation, a passing spring on the tip of the detent allows the unlocking roller on the staff to move by without displacing the detent. The weakest link of any mechanical timekeeper is the escapement's lubrication. When the oil thickens through age or temperature or dissipates through humidity or evaporation, the rate will change, sometimes dramatically as the balance motion decreases through higher friction in the escapement. A detent escapement has a strong advantage over other escapements as it needs no lubrication. An impulse from the escape wheel to the impulse roller is nearly dead-beat, meaning little sliding action needing lubrication. Chronometer escape wheels and passing springs are typically gold due to the metal's lower slide friction over brass and steel.|$|R
