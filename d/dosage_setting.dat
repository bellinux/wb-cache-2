40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to quantitatively predict the {{clearance}} of three antibiotics, amikacin, vancomycin, and teicoplanin, during continuous hemodiafiltration (CHDF) and to propose their optimal dosage in patients receiving CHDF. For this goal, in vitro CHDF experiments with a polyacrylonitrile (PAN) membrane were first performed using these antibiotics, and then the clearances were compared with in vivo CHDF situations determined in 16 critically ill patients. The in vitro CHDF clearances were described as the product of the outflow rate of a drain (Qoutflow) and the drug unbound fraction in artificial plasma, indicating that drug adsorption to the PAN membrane has minor effect on drug clearance in our settings. The observed in vivo clearances also agreed very well with the predicted values, with a product of Qoutflow and plasma unbound fraction, when residual creatinine clearance (CLCR) was taken into account (within a range of 0. 67 - to 1. 5 -fold for 15 of 16 patients). Based on these results, a nomogram of the optimized dosages of amikacin, vancomycin, and teicoplanin was proposed, and it was evident that Qoutflow and residual CLCR are major determinants of the dosage and dosing interval for these antibiotics. Although the applicability needs to be confirmed with another type of membrane or higher Qoutflow, our nomogram can help determine the <b>dosage</b> <b>setting</b> in criticall...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background After a {{long and}} {{controversial}} debate methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) was first introduced in Germany in 1987. The number of patients in MMT – first low because of strict admission criteria – increased considerably since the 1990 s up to some 65, 000 {{at the end of}} 2006. In Germany each general practitioner (GP), who has completed an additional training in addiction medicine, is allowed to prescribe substitution drugs to opioid dependent patients. Currently 2, 700 GPs prescribe substitution drugs. Psychosocial care should be made available to all MMT patients. Results The results of research studies and practical experiences clearly indicate that patients benefit substantially from MMT with improvements in physical and psychological health. MMT proves successful in attaining high retention rates (65 % to 85 % in the first years, up to 50 % after more than seven years) and {{plays a major role in}} accessing and maintaining ongoing medical treatment for HIV and hepatitis. MMT is also seen as a vital factor in the process of social re-integration and it contributes to the reduction of drug related harms such as mortality and morbidity and to the prevention of infectious diseases. Some 10 % of MMT patients become drug-free in the long run. Methadone is the most commonly prescribed substitution medication in Germany, although buprenorphine is attaining rising importance. Access to MMT in rural areas is very patchy and still constitutes a problem. There are only few employment opportunities for patients participating in MMT, although regular employment is considered unanimously as a positive factor of treatment success. Substitution treatment in German prisons is heterogeneous in access and treatment modalities. Access is very patchy and the number of inmates in treatment is limited. Nevertheless, substitution treatment plays a substantial part in the health care system provided to drug users in Germany. Conclusion In Germany, a history of substitution treatment spanning 20 years has meanwhile accumulated a wealth of experience, e. g. in the development of research on health care services, guidelines and the implementation of quality assurance measures. Implementing substitution treatment with concomitant effects and treatment elements such as drug history-taking, <b>dosage</b> <b>setting,</b> co-use of other psychoactive substances (alcohol, benzodiazepines, cocaine), management of 'difficult patient populations', and integration into the social environment has been arranged successfully. Also psychosocial counseling programmes adjuvant to substitution treatment have been established and, in the framework of a pilot project on heroin-based treatment, standardised manuals were developed. Research on allocating opioid users to the 'right' form of therapy at the 'right' point in time is still a challenge, though the pilot project 'heroin-based treatment' brought experience with patients who do not benefit from methadone treatment. There is also expertise in the treatment of specific co-morbidity such as HIV/AIDS, hepatitis and psychiatric disorders. The promotion and involvement of self-help groups plays an important part in the process of successful substitution treatment. </p...|$|E

5|$|The {{effects of}} {{psilocybin}} are highly variable and {{depend on the}} mindset and {{environment in which the}} user has the experience, factors commonly referred to as set and setting. In the early 1960s, Timothy Leary and colleagues at Harvard University investigated the role of set and setting on the effects of psilocybin. They administered the drug to 175 volunteers from various backgrounds in an environment intended to be similar to a comfortable living room. Ninety-eight of the subjects were given questionnaires to assess their experiences and the contribution of background and situational factors. Individuals who had experience with psilocybin prior to the study reported more pleasant experiences than those for whom the drug was novel. Group size, dosage, preparation, and expectancy were important determinants of the drug response. In general, those placed in groups of more than eight individuals felt that the groups were less supportive, and their experiences were less pleasant. Conversely, smaller groups (fewer than six individuals) were seen as more supportive. Participants also reported having more positive reactions to the drug in those groups. Leary and colleagues proposed that psilocybin heightens suggestibility, making an individual more receptive to interpersonal interactions and environmental stimuli. These findings were affirmed in a later review by Jos ten Berge (1999), who concluded that <b>dosage,</b> <b>set,</b> and setting were fundamental factors in determining the outcome of experiments that tested the effects of psychedelic drugs on artists' creativity.|$|R

The higher the nutrients content the better the growth. Using peat moss greatly promoted tomato growth through fertilization and increased nutrient accumulations in plant leaves and soil nutrient residual availability, but this effect was limited to compost containing high content of nutrients. Under normal fertilization practice, each of the various plant growth indices showed highly correlated relationship with total plant dry weight, thus some of the growth indices, such as numbers of plant leaf and flower, {{could be used to}} predict tomato production without undertaking destructive harvest. Also each of the major plant nutrients accumulated in plant leaves showed a highly correlated relationship with total plant dry weight. ^ The maturity of compost was an important factor in assessing the effects of composts on tomato growth and soil fertility. Plants growing in the mature compost medium benefitted from fertilization with nitrate, using NO 3 nutrient greatly increased plant growth and nutrient accumulations in plant leaves and also increased soil K residual availability. Plants growing in the immature compost medium benefit from fertilization with K, using K nutrient tremendously increased plant growth and nutrient accumulations in plant leaves. Immature compost was improved in their capacities to increase plant growth if additional K fertilization was provided. Fertilization with adequate dosage of K was a very effective method to reduce phytotoxicity caused by high content of NH 4 in immature compost. The proper <b>dosage</b> <b>set</b> by this research was 0. 6 g K/kg media.

40|$|The {{interaction}} among the bensulfuron-methyl, growth of Italian ryegrass, and soil chemical/biochemical/microbiological parameters {{was investigated in}} a microcosm experiment. The bensulfuron-methyl added to the soil can be rapidly degraded by certain fungi and actinomycetes present in the original paddy rice soil. The growth of Italian ryegrass significantly accelerated the in-soil degradation of bensulfuron-methyl in its rhizosphere. The uptake of bensulfuron-methyl by ryegrass increased with increasing dosage level of bensulfuron-methyl. However, the phytoextraction of bensulfuron-methyl by ryegrass contributed insignificantly to the total removal of the soil bensulfuron-methyl. Within the <b>dosage</b> range <b>set</b> in this study, the root development of ryegrass was not adversely affected {{by the presence of}} the soil bensulfuron-methyl although the fresh biomass of shoot was slightly reduced in the higher dosage treatments. This {{can be attributed to the}} adsorption of the added bensulfuron-methyl by soil colloids and consequently the reduction of bensulfuron-methyl level in the soil pore water to a concentration sufficiently lower than the toxic level.

40|$|Soil {{sorption}} {{of organic}} pollutants {{has long been}} a problematic in the soil washing process because of its durability and low water solubility. This paper discussed the soil washing phenomena over a wide range of parathion concentrations and several soil samples at various fractions of organic content (f oc) levels. When parathion <b>dosage</b> is <b>set</b> below the water solubility, washing performance is stable for surfactant concentrations above critical micelle concentration (cmc) and it is observed that more than 90 % of parathion can be washed out when dosage is five times lower than the solubility limit. However, such trends change when non-aqueous phase liquids (NAPL) is present in the system. Parathion extraction depends very much on the surfactant dosage but is not affected by the levels of f oc in the system. In between the extreme parathion dosage, a two-stage pattern is observed in these boundary regions. Washing performance is first increased with additional surfactant, but the increase slows down gradually since the sorption sites are believed to be saturated by the huge amount of surfactant in the system.

Patients with Weil’s disease constitute a homogeneous population and are typically free of comorbidities, therefore presenting an ideal model in which to test this assumption. Results: The effects of dialysis dosage were evaluated in this population, with the use of either classic or slow low-efficiency hemodialysis, and two periods/treatment plans were compared: 2002 to 2003 /delayed, alternate-day dialysis (DAdD group; n 15) and 2004 to 2005 /prompt and daily dialysis (PaDD group; n 18). Age, gender, AKI severity, APACHE score, serum urea, and time to recovery of renal function were assessed. All patients received vasoactive drugs (because of hemodynamic instability) and were on mechanical ventilation (because of acute respiratory distress syndrome).

The introduction of steel fibres in concrete beam has been proposed as flexural cracks inhibitor. This research of steel fibres as flexural cracks inhibitor in concrete beam under static loading was conducted focusing on simply supported beam to determine the crack propagations in flexure by varying the steel fibre content placement in the beam. The 25 kg/m 3 steel fibre was chosen for this study since the optimum concrete strength (fcu) is achieved with this steel fibre <b>dosage.</b> Seven <b>sets</b> of concrete beams of 150 mm x 250 mm x 1000 mm in size consists of three RC beams with full steel fibrous concrete (SFRC), three RC beams with steel fibre placed within tension zone of the beam, three RC beams with steel fibre placed at the half o f tension zone of the beam, two conventional RC beams (without steel fibre) as control sample, one unreinforced concrete beam with full steel fibre, one unreinforced concrete beam with steel fibre at tension zone only and one unreinforced concrete beam with steel fibre at half of tension zone. The variations in these seven sets of beams is intended to find the optimum steel fibrous concrete placements towards inhibiting flexural cracks in the beam. Experiment was conducted through three points bending test. The results showed that addition of steel fibre in conventional reinforced concrete beam increase the crack initiation load, yield load and ultimate load by 60...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Context and Objective: Men {{typically}} {{have a more}} atherogenic lipid profile than women characterized by higher low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and triglyceride levels and reduced lipid particle size, contributing to a greater risk for coronary disease. To determine whether X-chromosomal gene dosage affects lipid metabolism independent of sex steroid effects, we compared lipid profiles in age- and body mass-matched young women with ovarian failure, differing only in X-chromosome <b>dosage.</b> Design, <b>Setting,</b> and Patients: Women with premature ovarian failure associated with monosomy X or Turner syndrome (TS, n = 3 D 118) were compared with women with 46,XX premature ovarian failure (n = 3 D 51) in an in-patient clinical research center unit at the National Institutes of Health. These women were normally on estrogen replacement treatment but discontinued the estrogen 2 wk before study. Major Outcomes: Fasting lipid levels and nuclear magnetic resonance lipid particle profiles in the two study groups were the major outcomes. Results: Average age and body mass were similar {{in the two groups}} of women, but LDL cholesterol (P = 3 D 0. 001) and triglyceride levels (P = 3 D 0. 0005) were higher in the TS group. Also among women with TS, average LDL particle size was reduced (P < 0. 0001) and LDL particle concentration increased, with a 2 -fold increase in the smallest particle categories (P < 0. 0001). Whereas total high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were similar, high-density lipoprotein particle size was significantly smaller in women with TS, compared with women with premature ovarian failure (P < 0. 0001). Conclusions: Women with 45,X with ovarian failure exhibit a distinctly more atherogenic lipid profile than 46,XX women with ovarian failure, suggesting that the second X-chromosome contributes to a more salutary lipid profile in normal women, independent of sex steroid effects...|$|R
