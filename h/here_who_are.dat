25|$|Cemeteries for {{deceased}} {{prisoners were}} gradually opened near the camps. It {{was a point}} of honour for the survivors {{to take care of}} their comrades’ final resting places. Most often, each nationality had its own reserved patch. In certain camps, such as Gardelegen, veritable monuments were erected. Roger Pelletier motivated his comrades: “Doesn’t it fall to us, who have known them, to all of us <b>here</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> their great family, to raise, in the cemetery where they rest, a monument of the French soul that, spreading above them like an aegis, will be above our dead, when we have left, as a memory and a goodbye?” Wilhelm Doegen estimates the number of dead in the camps at 118,159 but serious doubts surround this number, notably because Doegen failed to take certain diseases into account. Also according to Doegen, Russia suffered the heaviest losses (perhaps explained by the poorer nutrition of Russians, most of whom did not receive packages from their families) with a little over 70,000 dead, followed by France with 17,069 deaths, Romania with 12,512, and then Italy and the United Kingdom.|$|E
500|$|After the war, Slotin {{expressed}} growing {{disdain for}} his personal involvement in the project. He remarked, [...] "I have {{become involved in the}} Navy tests, much to my disgust." [...] Unfortunately for Slotin, his participation at Los Alamos was still required because, as he said, [...] "I am {{one of the few people}} left <b>here</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> experienced bomb putter-togetherers." [...] He looked forward to resuming teaching and research into biophysics and radiobiology at the University of Chicago. He began training a replacement, Alvin C. Graves, to take over his Los Alamos work.|$|E

6000|$|... "Baptiste {{tells me}} that gentlemen of Genoa are <b>here,</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> desirous of hastening to the games of Vévey," [...] said the latter, raising his beaver, [...] "and that my {{presence}} may be of use in obtaining the pleasure of their company." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Doesn't it, by George!" [...] cried MacIan, scornfully. [...] "There {{are a few}} men <b>here</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> mad on God and a few who are mad on the Bible. But I {{bet there}} are many more who are simply mad on madness." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Wait," [...] he entreated; [...] "tell me {{a little}} more about the old people first. This {{digression}} about the ladies has been very interesting, but I {{thought you were going to}} speak of the men <b>here.</b> <b>Who</b> <b>are</b> they, or, rather, what are they?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The Duke of Souspennier," [...] {{she said}} slowly, [...] "is {{an old and}} a dear friend of mine. When {{you tell me that}} he is in London I am anxious because there are many <b>here</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> not his friends--who have no cause to love him." ...|$|E
6000|$|The negro chief, who quite {{understood}} {{the powers of}} a revolver, replied--"Tell your master, that before he could fire two shots, he and his friend would have each twelve bullets in his body. But I have not time to palaver <b>here.</b> <b>Who</b> <b>are</b> you, {{and where are you}} going?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No;--I was not {{thinking}} of Tifto. There were one or two <b>here</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> quite as bad as Tifto. I wonder what has become of that poor devil?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{all very}} well. I suppose I {{ought to say}} that I like it. There has <b>been</b> a {{policeman}} <b>here</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> going {{to bring an action}} against me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, well, well!' {{cried the}} young officer, in {{sufficiently}} bad French, 'what game {{are you up}} to <b>here?</b> <b>Who</b> <b>was</b> that <b>who</b> <b>was</b> yelling for help, and {{what are you trying to}} do to him?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know exactly}} about that," [...] Hunterleys replied, [...] "but I'll {{tell you one}} thing, Lane. There are {{things going on in}} Monte Carlo at the present moment which would bring out the black {{headlines}} on the halfpenny papers if they had an inkling of them. There are people <b>here</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> trying to draw up a new map of Europe, a new map of the world." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. McFarlane {{could not}} see the new-comer from where she sat, but Berrie rose in great {{excitement}} as a heavy-set, full-faced man with short, gray mustache and high, smooth brow entered the room. He did not smile as he greeted his son, and his penetrating glance questioned even before he spoke. He seemed to silently ask: [...] "Well, what's all this? How do you happen to be <b>here?</b> <b>Who</b> <b>are</b> these women?" ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{proceeded}} to explain herself. [...] "My uncle {{may appear to}} you a hard man. No doubt he is. They are all hard men, these planters. It is the life, I suppose. But there are others <b>here</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> worse. There is Mr. Crabston, for instance, up at Speightstown. He was there on the mole, waiting to buy my uncle's leavings, {{and if you had}} fallen into his hands... A dreadful man. That is why." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Andrew," [...] he said, [...] "perhaps I have behaved badly--at {{least from}} your point of view, but {{remember}} that I warned you. Let us sit down <b>here.</b> <b>Who</b> <b>is</b> your friend?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Don't say that, sir. But {{if he were}} to die, Gregory <b>here,</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> as good {{a fellow}} as ever lived, would come into his shoes. Ralph could sell no more than his own chance." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's a sad disadvantage, madam," [...] says Fizgig, gravely; [...] "and I {{recommend}} you and Brough <b>here,</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> {{coming out in}} the great world, to have some lessons; or at least get up a couple of dozen phrases, and introduce them into your conversation here and there. I suppose, sir, you speak it commonly at the office, Mr. What you call it?" [...] And Mr. Fizgig put his glass into his eye and looked at me.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Well,' {{said the}} Chevalier, 'we must begin without loss of time. My son has brought down {{a set of}} fellows <b>here,</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> trained to ferret out heretics. Not a runaway weasel cold escape them! We will set them on as soon as ever they have taken a bit of supper up there at the Chateau; and do {{you come up with}} us just to show them the way across to Leonard's.

6000|$|Again they dined alone, and Lord Chiltern {{explained}} to Phineas that he rarely {{associated with the}} men of either of the hunts in which he rode. [...] "There {{is a set of}} fellows down <b>here</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> poison to me, and there is another set, and I am poison to them. Everybody is very civil, as you see, but I have no associates. And gradually I am getting to have a reputation as though I were the devil himself. I think I shall come out next year dressed entirely in black." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, lad, that's the way {{it looks}} to a decent man; but sich fellows as these <b>here</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> makin' a row, are the ones who're always lookin' ahead, thinkin' matters may be bettered, an' regardin' not the {{possibility}} of their growin' worse. Here they are, like to come on short allowance, an' obleeged to take their turn at bein' shot at now an' then, consequently, not havin' the heart to endure even the lightest sufferin', they say we can't be any worse off, an' ought to surrender." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We see life," [...] he wrote, [...] "not only life in {{the world}} outside us, but life in our own selves, as an immense choice of possibilities; indeed, for us in {{particular}} who have come up <b>here,</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> not under any urgent necessity to take this line or that, life is apparently pure choice. It is quite easy to think we {{are all going to}} choose the pattern of life we like best and work it out in our own way.... And, meanwhile, there is no great hurry....|$|E
6000|$|... "'Koos!' he said, 'Koos! {{the other}} oxen have gone away. I turned my {{back for a}} minute, and when I looked round again they were all gone except Kaptein, <b>here,</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> rubbing his back against a tree.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "No doubt;--and I told Hugh; but {{not after}} the fashion {{in which he}} has told her. I blame myself mostly for this,--that we ever consented to come to this house. We had no {{business}} <b>here.</b> <b>Who</b> <b>is</b> to pay the rent?" ...|$|R
