5|$|In simpler terms, {{contact angle}} <b>hysteresis</b> is {{essentially}} the displacement of a contact line {{such as the one}} in Figure 3, by either expansion or retraction of the droplet. Figure 6 depicts the advancing and receding contact angles. The advancing contact angle is the maximum stable angle, whereas the receding contact angle is the minimum stable angle. Contact-angle <b>hysteresis</b> occurs because many different thermodynamically stable contact angles are found on a nonideal solid. These varying thermodynamically stable contact angles are known as metastable states.|$|E
5|$|An ideal {{surface is}} flat, rigid, {{perfectly}} smooth, and chemically homogeneous, and has zero contact angle <b>hysteresis.</b> Zero <b>hysteresis</b> implies the advancing and receding contact angles are equal. In other words, only one thermodynamically stable contact angle exists. When {{a drop of}} liquid is placed on such a surface, the characteristic contact angle is formed as depicted in Fig. 1. Furthermore, on an ideal surface, the drop will return to its original shape if it is disturbed. The following derivations apply only to ideal solid surfaces; they are only valid for the state in which the interfaces are not moving and the phase boundary line exists in equilibrium.|$|E
5|$|Economists became {{interested}} in <b>hysteresis</b> when unemployment levels spiked with the 1979 oil shock and early 1980s recessions but {{did not return to}} the lower levels that had been considered the natural rate. Olivier Blanchard and Lawrence Summers (1986) explained <b>hysteresis</b> in unemployment with insider-outsider models, which were also proposed by of Assar Lindbeck and Dennis Snower in a series of papers and then a book. Insiders, employees already working at a firm, are only concerned about their own welfare. They would rather keep their wages high than cut pay and expand employment. The unemployed, outsiders, do not have any voice in the wage bargaining process, so their interests are not represented. When unemployment increases, the number of outsiders increases as well. Even after the economy has recovered, outsiders continue to be disenfranchised from the bargaining process. The larger pool of outsiders created by periods of economic retraction can lead to persistently higher levels of unemployment. The presence of <b>hysteresis</b> in the labor market also raises the importance of monetary and fiscal policy. If temporary downturns in the economy can create long term increases in unemployment, stabilization policies do more than provide temporary relief; they prevent short term shocks from becoming long term increases in unemployment.|$|E
5|$|The {{virtue of}} a {{practical}} realization based upon this definition is that unlike the Kibble balance and other scale-based methods, {{all of which}} require the careful characterization of gravity in the laboratory, this method delineates {{the magnitude of the}} kilogram directly in the very terms that define the nature of mass: acceleration due to an applied force. Unfortunately, it is extremely difficult to develop a practical realization based upon accelerating masses. Experiments {{over a period of years}} in Japan with a superconducting, 30g mass supported by diamagnetic levitation never achieved an uncertainty better than ten parts per million. Magnetic <b>hysteresis</b> was one of the limiting issues. Other groups performed similar research that used different techniques to levitate the mass.|$|E
25|$|Since op-amps do {{not have}} any {{internal}} <b>hysteresis,</b> an external <b>hysteresis</b> network is always necessary for slow moving input signals.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{resulting}} properties of memristors and memristive systems is {{the existence of a}} pinched <b>hysteresis</b> effect. For a current-controlled memristive system, the input u(t) is the current i(t), the output y(t) is the voltage v(t), and the slope of the curve represents the electrical resistance. The change in slope of the pinched <b>hysteresis</b> curves demonstrates switching between different resistance states which is a phenomenon central to ReRAM and other forms of two-terminal resistance memory. At high frequencies, memristive theory predicts the pinched <b>hysteresis</b> effect will degenerate, resulting in a straight line representative of a linear resistor. It has been proven that some types of non-crossing pinched <b>hysteresis</b> curves (denoted Type-II) cannot be described by memristors.|$|E
25|$|In rare instances, using <b>hysteresis</b> to help {{maintain}} AV synchrony can help alleviate symptoms in ventricularly inhibited paced (VVI) patients providing they have intact sinus node function. <b>Hysteresis</b> reduces {{the amount of time}} spent in pacing mode, which can relieve symptoms, particularly when the pacing mode is generating AV dyssynchrony.|$|E
25|$|The area of each lobe of the pinched <b>hysteresis</b> loop shrinks as the {{frequency}} of the forcing signal increases.|$|E
25|$|Steinmetz {{is known}} for his {{contribution}} in three major fields of alternating current (AC) systems theory: <b>hysteresis,</b> steady-state analysis, and transients.|$|E
25|$|Another example {{suggests}} {{including an}} offset value a {{to account for}} an observed nanobattery effect which violates the predicted zero-crossing pinched <b>hysteresis</b> effect.|$|E
25|$|The Lissajous {{curve in}} the {{voltage-current}} plane is a pinched <b>hysteresis</b> loop when driven by any bipolar periodic voltage or current without respect to initial conditions.|$|E
25|$|As the {{frequency}} tends to infinity, the <b>hysteresis</b> loop degenerates to {{a straight line}} through the origin, whose slope depends on the amplitude {{and shape of the}} forcing signal.|$|E
25|$|Ferroelectric {{crystals}} often show several transition {{temperatures and}} domain structure <b>hysteresis,</b> much as do ferromagnetic crystals. The {{nature of the}} phase transition in some ferroelectric crystals is still not well understood.|$|E
25|$|Work in the 1970s through 1990’s {{identified}} sufficiently stable resonator {{materials and}} associated fabrication techniques. In particular, single and polycrystalline silicon {{was found to}} be suitable for frequency references with effectively zero aging, fatigue and <b>hysteresis,</b> and with moderate temperature sensitivity.|$|E
25|$|In practice, this circuit can be {{improved}} by incorporating a <b>hysteresis</b> voltage range to reduce its sensitivity to noise. The circuit shown in Fig. 5, for example, will provide stable operation even when the Vin signal is somewhat noisy.|$|E
25|$|A water {{retention}} curve {{is the relationship}} between volumetric water content and the water potential of the porous medium. It is characteristic for different types of porous medium. Due to <b>hysteresis,</b> different wetting and drying curves may be distinguished.|$|E
25|$|Ordinary power {{transformers}} have an {{iron core}} {{to increase the}} magnetic coupling between the coils. However at high frequencies an iron core causes energy losses due to eddy currents and <b>hysteresis,</b> {{so it is not}} used in the Tesla coil.|$|E
25|$|When {{resonators}} are aged or temperature cycled, the contaminants {{can move}} in the chambers, and transfer onto or off of the resonators. The change in mass on the resonators can produce <b>hysteresis</b> of thousands of ppm, which is unacceptable for virtually all frequency reference applications.|$|E
25|$|A {{dedicated}} {{voltage comparator}} will generally be {{faster than a}} general-purpose operational amplifier pressed into service as a comparator. A dedicated voltage comparator may also contain additional features such as an accurate, internal voltage reference, an adjustable <b>hysteresis</b> and a clock gated input.|$|E
25|$|The {{relative}} {{sliding movement}} of the leaves of a multi-leaf steel spring results in stiction-based <b>hysteresis</b> with respect to spring compression. This stiction reduces suspension compliance and can compromise both ride quality and handling. Lacking individual leaves, the mono-leaf spring avoids stiction.|$|E
25|$|The {{effect is}} also {{observed}} by <b>hysteresis</b> experienced when magnetization {{is measured in}} a magnetic field sweep: on lowering the magnetic field again after reaching the maximal magnetization the magnetization remains at high levels, and it requires a reversed field to bring magnetization back to zero.|$|E
25|$|Single-molecule magnets (SMM) are a {{class of}} metalorganic {{compounds}} that show superparamagnetic behavior below a certain blocking temperature at the molecular scale. In this temperature range, SMMs exhibit magnetic <b>hysteresis</b> of purely molecular origin. Contrary to conventional bulk magnets and molecule-based magnets, collective long-range magnetic ordering of magnetic moments is not necessary.|$|E
25|$|Comprehensive {{studies of}} this {{phenomenon}} {{have shown that the}} position of the cavity is critical in creating sound. The process has <b>hysteresis</b> loops and the frequencies are related to multiples of the quarter wavelength resonance of the cavity. After reformatting Hartmann’s formula, and using the new formulation above, an equation for sound power can be written.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{independence}} of strain rate, preconditioned soft tissues still present <b>hysteresis,</b> so the mechanical response can be modeled as hyperelastic with different material constants at loading and unloading. By this method the elasticity theory is used to model an inelastic material. Fung has called this model as pseudoelastic {{to point out that}} the material is not truly elastic.|$|E
25|$|Memristance is {{displayed}} only when both the doped layer and depleted layer contribute to resistance. When enough charge has {{passed through the}} memristor that the ions can no longer move, the device enters <b>hysteresis.</b> It ceases to integrate q=∫Idt, but rather keeps q at an upper bound and M fixed, thus acting as a constant resistor until current is reversed.|$|E
25|$|Single-molecule magnets {{represent}} a molecular approach to nanomagnets (nanoscale magnetic particles). In addition, single-molecule magnets have provided physicists with useful test-beds {{for the study}} of quantum mechanics. Macroscopic quantum tunneling of the magnetization was first observed in Mn12O12, characterized by evenly spaced steps in the <b>hysteresis</b> curve. The periodic quenching of this tunneling rate in the compound Fe8 has been observed and explained with geometric phases.|$|E
25|$|Charles Proteus Steinmetz (born Karl August Rudolph Steinmetz, April 9, 1865– October 26, 1923) was a German-born American {{mathematician}} {{and electrical}} engineer {{and professor at}} Union College. He fostered the development of alternating current that made possible {{the expansion of the}} electric power industry in the United States, formulating mathematical theories for engineers. He made ground-breaking discoveries in the understanding of <b>hysteresis</b> that enabled engineers to design better electromagnetic apparatus equipment including especially electric motors for use in industry.|$|E
25|$|Early {{studies have}} used the term stage to {{describe}} the possible states of feedback as shown schematically in the figure on the right. As the flow speed increases (Reynolds number, Re) the frequency slowly climbs (nearly constant Strouhal number, St) but then the frequency jumps up abruptly to a higher stage. As the flow speed is later decreased the frequency slowly decreases but then jumps down abruptly to a lower stage. This pattern is called a <b>hysteresis</b> loop.|$|E
25|$|Some {{programmable}} thermostats {{are available}} to control line-voltage systems. Baseboard heaters will especially benefit from a programmable thermostat which is capable of continuous control (as are at least some Honeywell models), effectively controlling the heater like a lamp dimmer, and gradually increasing and decreasing heating to ensure an extremely constant room temperature (continuous control {{rather than relying on}} the averaging effects of <b>hysteresis).</b> Systems which include a fan (electric furnaces, wall heaters, etc.) must typically use simple on/off controls.|$|E
25|$|Finally, <b>hysteresis</b> {{synchronous}} motors {{typically are}} (essentially) two-phase motors with a phase-shifting capacitor for one phase. They start like induction motors, but when slip rate decreases sufficiently, the rotor (a smooth cylinder) becomes temporarily magnetized. Its distributed poles make it {{act like a}} PMSM. The rotor material, {{like that of a}} common nail, will stay magnetized, but can also be demagnetized with little difficulty. Once running, the rotor poles stay in place; they do not drift.|$|E
25|$|The yellow {{plastic pipe}} is {{actually}} a child’s toy that sounds when the pipe is whirled around. The metal pipe shown {{was used in the}} Concorde cockpit to provide cooling air to the pilots, but its loud tone got it canceled. This whistle is similar in many respects to the hole tone, in particular the teapot whistle. It is subject to frequency jumps and <b>hysteresis</b> loops. There are numerous articles on the internet about this whistle and it has been studied.|$|E
25|$|Young's modulus quantifies the {{elasticity}} of the polymer. It is defined, for small strains, as {{the ratio of}} rate of change of stress to strain. Like tensile strength, this is highly relevant in polymer applications involving the physical properties of polymers, such as rubber bands. The modulus {{is strongly dependent on}} temperature. Viscoelasticity describes a complex time-dependent elastic response, which will exhibit <b>hysteresis</b> in the stress-strain curve when the load is removed. Dynamic mechanical analysis or DMA measures this complex modulus by oscillating the load and measuring the resulting strain as a function of time.|$|E
25|$|Induction heating is a {{non-contact}} {{process which}} uses {{the principle of}} electromagnetic induction to produce heat in a workpiece. By placing a conductive material into a strong alternating magnetic field, electric current is made to flow in the material, thereby causing Joule heating. In magnetic materials, further heat is generated below the Curie point due to <b>hysteresis</b> losses. The generated current is predominantly in the surface layer, the depth of this layer being dictated by {{the frequency of the}} alternating field and the permeability of the material.|$|E
25|$|The {{spontaneous}} {{polarization of}} ferroelectric materials implies a <b>hysteresis</b> effect {{which can be}} used as a memory function, and ferroelectric capacitors are indeed used to make ferroelectric RAM for computers and RFID cards. In these applications thin films of ferroelectric materials are typically used, as this allows the field required to switch the polarization to be achieved with a moderate voltage. However, when using thin films a great deal of attention needs to be paid to the interfaces, electrodes and sample quality for devices to work reliably.|$|E
25|$|Soft tissues {{have the}} {{potential}} to undergo big deformations and still come back to the initial configuration when unloaded, i.e. their stress-strain curve is nonlinear. The soft tissues are also viscoelastic, incompressible and usually anisotropic. Some viscoelastic properties observable in soft tissues are: relaxation, creep and <b>hysteresis.</b> In order to describe the mechanical response of soft tissues, several methods have been used. These methods include: hyperelastic macroscopic models based on strain energy, mathematical fits where nonlinear constitutive equations are used, and structurally based models where the response of a linear elastic material is modified by its geometric characteristics.|$|E
25|$|Charging a {{capacitor}} (due to a voltage between the capacitor plates) causes an electric field {{to be applied}} to the dielectric between the electrodes. This field exerts a torque on the molecular dipoles, causing the directions of the dipole moments to align with the field direction. This change in the molecular dipoles is called oriented polarization and also causes heat to be generated, resulting in dielectric losses (see dissipation factor). The orientation of the dipoles does not follow the electric field synchronously, but is delayed by a time constant that depends on the material. This delay corresponds to a <b>hysteresis</b> response of the polarization to the external field.|$|E
