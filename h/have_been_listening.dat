500|$|The January 1938 Supreme Court {{ruling in}} Alabama Power Co. v. Ickes, resolving the 1934 case, and {{the lifting of}} the {{injunction}} by an appeals court, sent the parties back to the negotiating table. Willkie kept the public pressure on: like most corporate executives, he had not spoken out against Roosevelt's New Deal policies, but in January stated in a radio debate that anti-utility policies were depressing share prices, making it hard to attract investment that would help America to recover. [...] "For several years now, we <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>listening</b> to a bedtime story, telling us that the men who hold office in Washington are, by their very positions, endowed with a special virtue." [...] The Saturday Evening Post dubbed Willkie [...] "the man who talked back".|$|E
500|$|The A.V. Club writer Leonard Pierce {{said the}} episode {{included}} great lines, strong personality-driven comedy and good character moments, specially Tom's emotional {{reaction to his}} painting. Pierce said the Andy and Ron subplot was [...] "so well played that it threatens to usurp the mural storyline". Sandra Gonzalez particularly praised the [...] "murinal" [...] jokes about Jerry's mural, as well as Ron's claim that he ran a sheet metal factory when he was nine, and that [...] "Child labor laws are ruining this country." [...] Time magazine television critic James Poniewozik said make jokes connected in [...] "The Camel", including the Andy shoeshine plot and the [...] "unexpectedly glamorous" [...] sewage department. But he particularly praised the character development in the main plot, in which [...] "each {{in their own way}} sticks to the purity of their uniquely screwy ideas". Brad Sanders of the Indiana Daily Student praised the entire cast, particularly Offerman and Pratt, who he said provide the show's two best characters. Sanders said the fact that the episode included a [...] "hilarious subplot" [...] involving both of them [...] "was more evidence that the writers <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>listening</b> to the fans".|$|E
500|$|Igor Stravinsky {{expressed}} great, but not uncritical, {{enthusiasm for}} Stockhausen's {{music in the}} conversation books with Robert Craft (e.g., [...] ) and for years organised private listening sessions with friends in his home where he played tapes of Stockhausen's latest works ( [...] ; [...] ). In an interview published in March 1968, however, he says of an unidentified person, I <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>listening</b> all week to the piano music of a composer now greatly esteemed {{for his ability to}} stay an hour or so ahead of his time, but I find the alternation of note-clumps and silences of which it consists more monotonous than the foursquares of the dullest eighteenth-century music. [...] The following October, a report in Sovetskaia Muzyka [...] translated this sentence (and a few others from the same article) into Russian, substituting for the conjunction [...] "but" [...] the phrase [...] "Ia imeiu v vidu Karlkheintsa Shtokkhauzena" [...] ("I am referring to Karlheinz Stockhausen"). When this translation was quoted in Druskin's Stravinsky biography, the field was widened to all of Stockhausen's compositions and Druskin adds for good measure, [...] "indeed, works he calls unnecessary, useless and uninteresting", again quoting from the same Sovetskaia Muzyka article, even though it had made plain that the characterization was of American [...] "university composers" [...]|$|E

2500|$|Speaking of {{the music}} that {{influenced}} the album, YG said, [...] "I always listened to Quik, N.W.A, Snoop, Dre, E-40. I was banging all that. Honestly though the shit I was really listening to was Weezy. I {{think it was the}} type shit he was rapping about and the way he was doing it that made me want to rap more. I <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>listening</b> to Doggystyle and The Chronic and even Kendrick's shit a lot more once I started talking about doing an album." [...] He later included 50 Cent's Get Rich or Die Tryin' and The Notorious B.I.G.'s Life After Death as albums he had taken influence from for this album.|$|E
2500|$|The {{developers}} {{stated that}} they listened to fan responses from the first game and implemented those ideas into the sequel. [...] "We <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>listening</b> to our fans and building the pinball game that they envisioned," [...] stated Kigyossy. [...] "It took {{a little longer than}} expected, but we have designed a game that unifies the online community, and takes all the social features to the next level." [...] The game was made available free of charge and gives players the ability to try any table for a limited time. [...] Players can then elect to download Pinball FX 2 Core which unlocks full versions of the Pinball FX 2 tables. [...] Owners of the original Pinball FX can import their existing tables, then selectively choose which of the new tables they want to download. [...] Players who do not own Pinball FX can purchase the Pinball FX Classic pack, which contains the three original tables along with the free downloadable table from the original game. [...] Kigyossy hinted that some of the exclusive tables from Zen Pinball would be coming in the future to Pinball FX 2, which was realized when the Mars table was released on April 20, 2011. Zen Studios announced on February 29, 2012 that the game would be available for free along with the Sorcerer's Lair table for Windows 8 users, with the additional tables available as premium downloadable content. It was released on the new OS for download from the Windows Store on October 27, 2012, although the Mars table was provided for free instead.|$|E
