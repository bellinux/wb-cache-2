50|$|<b>Disk</b> <b>Copy</b> 6.0 {{added support}} for the New Disk Image Format (NDIF). Versions of <b>Disk</b> <b>Copy</b> in Mac OS X added {{support for the}} newer Universal Disk Format (UDIF) image format, {{introduced}} with DMG files in Mac OS X.|$|E
50|$|<b>Disk</b> <b>Copy</b> Fast and its professional/commercial version <b>Disk</b> <b>Copy</b> Plus were {{authored}} by Chang Ping Lee. The last known version is 5.3a released in 1996. This software does not run well under Windows XP or newer. This software may be abandonware.|$|E

50|$|ALF {{had some}} {{experience}} with floppy drives and hard drives, particularly with the S-100 systems, and began designing <b>disk</b> <b>copying</b> software and hardware for internal use. At computer industry conventions, ALF was often asked by other software and hardware companies how ALF was getting their <b>disks</b> <b>copied,</b> since this was a common problem in the industry. When they discovered ALF had designed their own equipment, many companies {{asked if they could}} buy the equipment or if ALF would <b>copy</b> their <b>disks.</b> ALF began <b>copying</b> <b>disks</b> for several software companies, at first largely as favors to the exhibitors ALF's employees had socialized with at the conventions. These casual arrangements soon evolved into a full-fledged <b>disk</b> <b>copying</b> service which ALF began advertising in computer magazines.|$|R
50|$|For {{all forms}} of copying, Fast Hack'em could verify the {{resulting}} <b>disk</b> <b>copies</b> {{to ensure that they}} were valid.|$|R
40|$|The music {{industry}} contends that copied CDs represent lost sales. An {{exploration of the}} historical precedents, {{music industry}} assumptions and empirical evidence show a far more complex relationship. In this paper we look back at potential threats to the entertainment industry threats such as the advent of recording, radio and cassette recorders. We then examine the assumptions of the music industry’s argument, supplemented by a survey of <b>disk</b> <b>copying</b> behavior. The {{results indicate that the}} underlying dynamics are more complex than the industry claims, including the possibility that <b>disk</b> <b>copying</b> can result in a net benefit to the CD industry...|$|R
50|$|Other image formats {{supported}} by <b>Disk</b> <b>Copy</b> include DiskSet and raw disk images.|$|E
50|$|In Mac OS X v10.2.3, Apple {{introduced}} Compressed Disk Images and Internet-Enabled Disk Images for {{use with}} the Apple utility <b>Disk</b> <b>Copy,</b> which was later integrated into Disk Utility in 10.3. The <b>Disk</b> <b>Copy</b> application {{had the ability to}} display a multi-lingual software license agreement before mounting a disk image. The image will not be mounted unless the user indicates agreement with the license.|$|E
50|$|Apple <b>Disk</b> <b>Copy</b> {{can be used}} on Classic Mac OS and macOS {{systems to}} create and write disk image files.|$|E
5000|$|Loading {{time was}} much faster on the <b>copy</b> <b>disk</b> with its <b>copy</b> {{protection}} disabled.|$|R
50|$|Hard drive upgrade - An {{individual}} user may use <b>disk</b> <b>copying</b> (cloning) to upgrade to a new, usually larger, hard disk. Recently more users use cloning {{to move to}} the faster Solid State Drive SSD. Disk cloning is also useful when reconditioning an SSD.|$|R
5000|$|If {{it was not}} {{considered}} a photograph, is the computer <b>disk</b> a <b>copy?</b> ...|$|R
50|$|Holds up to 60 drives. Optional {{features}} include snapshots, snapshots plus virtual <b>disk</b> <b>copy,</b> firmware upgrade to increase array performance, remote replication, and SSD cache.|$|E
50|$|<b>Disk</b> <b>Copy</b> {{was also}} {{the name of an}} Apple utility {{distributed}} with some of the earliest versions of the classic Mac OS. In order to copy 400K floppy disks using as few disk swaps as possible on a machine with only 128K of RAM, the original <b>Disk</b> <b>Copy</b> used the screen buffer to store binary data from the disk being copied; as a result, the screen (other than a small area at the bottom displaying the GUI) filled with noise while copying was in progress. It was shipped with System 1.1 and System 2.0, probably as a reaction to a bug in the first version of Finder causing excessive disk swaps.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Disk</b> <b>Copy</b> Fast (DCF) is a file archiver {{software}} utility {{that creates}} disk images of floppy disks. It also {{refers to the}} file format used to encode the disk image files created. These image files typically use the file extension [...] ".DCF".|$|E
5000|$|ALF {{obtained}} blank disks at {{very low}} prices due to the huge quantities needed for its <b>disk</b> <b>copying</b> service. ALF began selling blank disks in bulk packaging, {{instead of the usual}} ten-pack boxes, and with some advertising in the major personal computer magazines quickly became a major disk vendor. As competition in bulk disk sales began to increase, ALF looked for a way to distinguish its bulk disk products and soon hit upon the idea of selling pre-formatted disks. Normally, the user would have to format each disk before being able to use it in their computer, which was time-consuming. With pre-formatted disks, the user could use the disk in their computer immediately upon receipt. ALF, being a manufacturer of <b>disk</b> <b>copying</b> equipment, had a significant advantage in producing pre-formatted disks over most of the bulk disk vendors. Soon, ALF was formatting and selling millions of disks each year. ALF also formatted disks for some of the major disk manufacturers, such as Nashua Corporation ...|$|R
5000|$|Later ALF {{began selling}} two related <b>disk</b> <b>copying</b> products. One was a {{software}} product that ran {{on a standard}} Apple II computer, but <b>copied</b> <b>disks</b> faster than Apple's software and much more reliably. The other was a product that combined that software with additional hardware to allow even faster copying. The software-only product was originally named [...] "PenultiCopy"; [...] "penulti" [...] from [...] "penultimate", meaning second best or second from the top (i.e. second compared to the hardware product), but unfortunately more often meaning next to last. This was soon changed to the more apt name of [...] "Total Accuracy Copy Program".|$|R
50|$|In later {{versions}} of Fast Hack'em, <b>disk</b> <b>copying</b> could be performed without the computer if two Commodore 1541 disk drives were available. The software would be loaded with a Commodore 64, the two drive option would be selected which transferred software to the drives' controller memory, and the serial cable could be {{disconnected from the}} computer. Any number of copies could be performed as long as neither drive was powered down.|$|R
50|$|If {{you only}} have one {{diskette}} drive, you can diskcopy by typing the source drive only. The <b>disk</b> <b>copy</b> program will prompt you to insert the second(target) diskette once it finishes reading the complete contents of the first(source) diskette track by track into memory.|$|E
5000|$|... "Disk Copy 4.2" [...] (DC42) is {{the common}} name {{used to refer to}} disk images of floppy disks created by the 4.2 version of <b>Disk</b> <b>Copy.</b> DART is a variant that {{supports}} compression, and was initially handled by the DART (Disk Archive/Retrieval Tool) utility.|$|E
50|$|<b>Disk</b> <b>Copy</b> was {{the default}} utility for {{handling}} logical volume images in System 7 through Mac OS X 10.2 (usable in System Software 6 as well). In later versions of macOS {{it has been}} replaced by DiskImageMounter for mounting the images and Disk Utility for creating them.|$|E
50|$|Via {{management}} interface a client may be selected for OS-Installation. If the client boots via PXE it loads a boot {{image from the}} opsi-depotserver. This bootimage prepares the hard <b>disk,</b> <b>copies</b> the required installation files, drivers and the opsi client agent and starts finally an unattended OS-Installation. Opsi uses the automatic detection of the necessary drivers for PCI-, HD-Audio- and USB-Devices. OS-installation via Disk image is also supported.|$|R
5000|$|Atari Macro Assembler (AMAC) [...] - [...] A macro {{assembler}} released by Atari Program Exchange (APX) in <b>disk</b> form. <b>Copy</b> protected.|$|R
50|$|These first {{appeared}} on ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64 and Amstrad CPC games that were distributed around the world via Bulletin Board Systems (BBSes) and floppy <b>disk</b> <b>copying.</b> Initially the intros consisted of simple messages, but they grew progressively more complex as they became a medium to demonstrate the purported superiority of a cracking group. Even the commercially available ISEPIC cartridge, which produced memory dumps of copy-protected Commodore 64 software, added a custom crack intro to the snapshots it produced.|$|R
50|$|In {{the classic}} Mac OS, similar {{functionality}} to the verification features of Disk Utility {{could be found}} in the Disk First Aid application. Another application called Drive Setup was used for drive formatting and partitioning and the application <b>Disk</b> <b>Copy</b> was used for working with disk images.|$|E
5000|$|Starting with version 10.7, Apple [...] "removed {{double-click}} {{support for}} images using legacy metadata." [...] DiskImageMounter {{will not be}} able to open [...]img (NDIF only), [...]smi (self mounting), [...]dc42 (<b>Disk</b> <b>Copy</b> 4.2), and [...]dart (DART) disk image formats that was previously supported in version 10.6 and earlier.|$|E
5000|$|Currently, {{the only}} way to open a [...]dmg disk image in Mac OS 9 is to use either the {{developer}} version of <b>Disk</b> <b>Copy</b> (version 6.4), or a beta version of the unreleased 6.5. However, both versions can only open uncompressed images; compressed Disk Images are unusable on Mac OS 9.|$|E
50|$|Before Windows 95, some {{computer}} manufacturers used hardware <b>disk</b> <b>copying</b> {{machines to}} copy software. This had the disadvantages of copying {{not just the}} used data on the disk, but also unused sectors, as the hardware used {{was not aware of}} the structures on the disks. A larger hard disk could not be copied to a smaller one, and copying a smaller one to a larger left the remaining space on the new disk unused. The two disks required identical geometries.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} guaranteed data lifetime, a novel system property {{ensuring that}} sensitive data cannot be retrieved from a system beyond a specified time. The trivial {{way to achieve}} this is to “reboot”; however, this is disruptive from the user’s perspective, and may not even eliminate <b>disk</b> <b>copies.</b> We discuss an alternate approach based on state re-incarnation where data expiry is completely transparent to the user, {{and can be used}} even if the system is not designed a priori to provide the property. ...|$|R
50|$|GParted (acronym of GNOME Partition Editor) is a GTK+ {{front-end}} to GNU Parted and {{an official}} GNOME partition-editing application (alongside Disks). GParted {{is used for}} creating, deleting, resizing, moving, checking, and <b>copying</b> <b>disk</b> partitions and their file systems. This is useful for creating space for new operating systems, reorganizing <b>disk</b> usage, <b>copying</b> data residing on hard disks, and mirroring one partition with another (disk imaging).|$|R
5000|$|Later {{versions}} of System 7, specifically System 7.5 and Mac OS 7.6, {{came with a}} dedicated [...] "Utilities" [...] folder and [...] "Apple Extras" [...] folder including: AppleScript, <b>Disk</b> <b>Copy,</b> QuickDraw GX Extras and QuickTime Movie Player. More optional extras and utilities could be manually installed from the System CD.|$|E
50|$|Apple disk {{images can}} be created using {{utilities}} bundled with Mac OS X, specifically <b>Disk</b> <b>Copy</b> in Mac OS X v10.2 and earlier and Disk Utility in Mac OS X v10.3 and later. These utilities can also use Apple disk image files as images for burning CDs and DVDs. Disk image files may also be managed via the command line using the hdiutil.|$|E
50|$|OSI/CPM had an assembler, FORTRAN and COBOL compiler, {{but to make}} {{a copy of the}} CP/M, one had to boot in OS-65D to {{copy the}} disk.OS-65D had a Basic Interpreter, Assembler, Editor, Disassembler, and <b>Disk</b> <b>Copy</b> Utility.OS-65U had a Basic Interpreter, and had some simple {{networking}} capability, but assembly programs had to be done in OS-65D and then ported over.|$|E
50|$|Software: A typical 820-II {{came with}} the CP/M 2.2 {{operating}} system, a diagnostic <b>disk,</b> a <b>copy</b> of WordStar word processor software, and Microsoft's BASIC-80 programming language.|$|R
50|$|The {{most popular}} feature of Fast Hack'em was {{its ability to}} produce copies of copy-protected {{commercial}} software. When using the nibbler, <b>disk</b> <b>copying</b> was done on a very low level, bit-by-bit rather than using standard Commodore DOS commands. This effectively nullified the efficacy of deliberate disk errors, non-standard track layouts, and related forms of copy prevention. <b>Copying</b> a protected <b>disk</b> took approximately 60 seconds if being copied directly to another disk drive, or 3 minutes (plus several disk swaps) if performed using a single disk drive.|$|R
50|$|The 1541 floppy drive {{contained}} a MOS 6502 processor {{acting as the}} drive controller, along with a built-in disk operating system (DOS) in ROM and {{a small amount of}} RAM, the latter primarily used for buffer space. Since this arrangement was, in effect, a specialized computer, it was possible to write custom controller routines and load them into the drive's RAM, thus making the drive work independently of the C64 machine. For example, certain back up software allowed users to make multiple <b>disk</b> <b>copies</b> directly between daisy-chained drives without a C64.|$|R
