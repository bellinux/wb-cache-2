5000|$|Type 991 I is {{the first}} member of Type 991 series, and it {{is the first}} {{purposely}} designed cable layer / repair ship in China. Program begun in early 1961 when Chinese naval headquarter formally issued the order to the 708th Institute of China State Shipbuilding Corporation, and the 708th Institute is also more commonly known as China Shipbuilding and Oceanic Engineering Design Academy (中国船舶及海洋工程设计研究) nowadays. After extensive research, the 3rd Directorate of the 708th Institute (708所3室) begun design work in October 1963, but reviews revealed that there are some inadequacy in the design, so two new modified design was created in February 1964. The biggest change of the modified designs is that the original cable carrying capacity is limited to 155 tons in a single cargo <b>hold</b> <b>compartment</b> with cable length of 40 km at maximum. In the modified design, this is increased to 270 tons in two cargo hold compartments with cable length of 40 km at maximum. The diameter of the cable remained unchanged at 40 mm. On August 2, 1965, the 6th Ministry approved the design of Type 991. In March 1966, some final modification begun at Wuchang Shipyard, where the ship was planned to be built, and this final modification was completed in June 1966. However, Wuchang Shipyard did not built the ship, but instead, the ship was built in Guangzhou Shipyard, with work begun in 1967 and launched on June 7, 1969. On January 1, 1971, trials were successfully completed and the ship entered service in Chinese South Sea Fleet with pennant number B230. Type 991I is equipped with10 ton (98.1 KN) EKM-20 cable laying machine that is indigenously designed in China. Specification: ...|$|E

40|$|Mark Pitkin, PhDOne {{lesson from}} {{arthroplasty}} to osseointegration {{in search for}} better fixation of in-bone implanted prosthesis Abstract—Direct transcutaneous prosthetic attachment (osseointegration) consists of implanting directly into the residuum bone a metal pylon whose external fraction connects the residuum to the external prosthesis. Since the introduction of osseointegration about 20 years ago, the obvious challenge associated with this technology has been the skin-pylon interface {{as a source of}} infections. In comparison, the bone-device interface was considered less prob-lematic because of the knowledge and experience inherited from dental implantology and total joint replacement (arthroplasty). Current methods of pylon fixation in osseointegration follow arthroplasty’s paradigm of positioning the pylon’s shaft inside the bone’s medullary canal. However, adopting the medullary canal as a <b>holding</b> <b>compartment</b> for the pylon’s shaft creates the problem of shaft loosening, which has not yet been solved in arthroplasty...|$|R

5000|$|The cargo {{included}} approximately 5,000 barrels, other containers, {{and bags}} containing inflammable substances (xylene, butanol, butyl acrylate, cyclohexanone, and sodium—contact of the sodium with water {{was the cause}} of the fire), toxins (aniline oil, diphenylmethane di-isocyanate, o-cresol, and dibutyl phthalate), and corrosives (phosphoric acid and phthalic anhydride). The inflammable liquids comprised at least 2,000 barrels stored in four of the five <b>hold</b> <b>compartments.</b> The nature of the cargo was initially unclear, but the Spanish newspaper El País identified it as [...] "several tons of a sodium compound, 110 tons of aniline oil, 6 tons of ethanol (grain alcohol) and 10 tons of an inflammable liquid of Grade 9 (maximum) danger", and the governor of A Coruña, Andres Moreno Aguilar, confirmed the list as accurate. There were rumours of nuclear material. Recovery of the dangerous substances that had not been swept into the sea by waves was completed on 12 December, after a deck was removed to access the deep tank where the aniline was stored. There were three injuries and one case of mild aniline poisoning among the salvage workers. A large portion of the cargo was not recovered; what was, was taken to the Alúmina-Aluminio plant in San Cibrao, causing alarm among the workers.|$|R

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{cannibalism}} in communally reared crabs can be eliminated by separating the growing crabs into <b>holding</b> <b>compartments.</b> There is currently no information on optimal compartment size for growing crabs individually. 136 second instar crablets (Portunus sanguinolentus) (C 2 ca. 7 - 10 mm carapace width (CW)) were grown for 90 days in 10 different-sized opaque and transparent walled acrylic compartments. The base area for each compartment ranged from small (32 mm × 32 mm) to large (176 mm × 176 mm). Effects of holding space and wall transparency on survival, CW, moult increment, intermoult period and average weekly gain (AWG) were examined. Most crabs reached instars C 9 -C 10 (50 - 70 mm CW) {{by the end}} of experiment. The final survival rate in the smallest compartment was 25 % mainly due to moult-related mortality predominantly occurring at the C 9 instar. However, crabs in these smaller compartments had earlier produced significantly larger moult increments from instar to instar than those in the larger compartments (P < 0. 05). Crabs in the smaller compartments (< 65 mm × 65 mm) also showed significantly longer moult periods (P < 0. 05). The net result was that AWG in CW was 5. 22 mm week- 1 for the largest compartment and 5. 15 mm week- 1 in smallest and did not differ significantly between compartment size groups (P = 0. 916). Wall transparency had no impact on survival (P = 0. 530) but a slight impact on AWG (P = 0. 014). Survival rate was the best indicator of minimum acceptable compartment size (? 43 mm × 43 mm) for C 10 crablets because below this size death occurred before growth rate was significantly affected. For further growth, it would be necessary to transfer the crablets to larger compartments...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{luteinizing hormone}} {{receptor}} (LHR) is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) {{that has a}} large N-terminal ligand binding ectodomain. The LHR ectodomain splice variant, expressed concomitantly with the full-length LHR in tissues, has an unknown biological function. GPCRs are a major pharmacological target, however, very {{little is known about}} the intracellular regulation of these receptors. In the present work, expression and maturation of the rat LHR and its variant were elucidated using both tissues and heterologous expression systems. A special effort was made to identify the role of developmental stage and tissue type on the LHR maturation and to find out about the molecular role of the ectodomain splice variant. We found two sites of localization for the receptor, namely the sensory system and urogenital tissues. This was demonstrated at mRNA and protein level and by rat LHR promoter-driven β-galactosidase (β-Gal) expression in the mice. In neurons, the β-Gal co-localized with the cytochrome P 450 side chain cleavage enzyme, which may indicate a novel role in the neurosteroid synthesis. The neuronal LHR was expressed in the mature and immature protein forms in both developing and adult tissues, being able to bind hormone with similar high-affinity as gonadal receptors. In contrast, only immature receptors were detected in the fetal rat urogenital structures. A significant novel finding was substantial upregulation of the LHR in pregnant female rat adrenal glands and kidneys at a time that coincides with the differentiation of the fetal urogenital tissues. The mice overexpressing the ectodomain splice variant showed interference in pituitary-gonadal functions and morphological changes in the urogenital tissues. The studies showed that the variant was an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) -retained soluble protein. It accumulated in juxtanuclear regions of the ER together with ER folding chaperones and was a substrate for ER associated degradation (ERAD). The co-expression of the variant with the full-length receptor decreased the amount of receptors and misrouted them to the juxtanuclear ER subcompartment. Taken together, we suggest that the maturation of the LHR protein is developmentally and physiologically regulated at the post-translational level in tissues. The LHR ectodomain splice variant possibly modulates post-translationally the number of full-length receptors through physiological signals. Our observation of the chaperone and protein accumulation into a specific ER subcompartment may represent a protein quality control <b>holding</b> <b>compartment</b> for inefficiently/misfolded ERAD substrates...|$|R

5000|$|Urbie (1997) was a {{proof of}} concept robot {{designed}} for urban environments. The platform was designed with two tank-like tracks so it could climb stairs. Urbie was field tested at Fort Benning, Georgia, United States; one model was gifted to a local high school on indefinite loan in 2005. High school students at Columbus High School in Columbus, GA, reconditioned the robot and created a usage manual for future students to continue to benefit from Urbie's list of talents. Urbie is built around a light, machined aluminum chassis. The exterior consists of flat aluminum plates, bent at the front and back, which {{are attached to the}} chassis with small hex screws. 2 dc motors power the forward rotating arms, while 2 slightly larger dc motors power the body length treads. From the outside, Urbie is an exact replica of the PackBot Scout. The front <b>compartment</b> <b>holds</b> 2 banks of LEDs, one white light, the other infrared. The center-front <b>compartment</b> <b>holds</b> a video camera and an infrared camera. Both cameras' images are transmitted back to a handheld LCD screen and remote control console via a single antenna. The image that is transmitted back is controlled by a mechanical switch, thrown remotely inside the chassis by a remote controlled actuator. The motors are controlled the same way that a remote control airplane or car is. The ability to reverse the tread direction on both sides gives the robot a 0 degree turn radius. In 2006, the exterior body was refinished, the antennas were repaired (replaced by a fishing pole) and some of the interior electronics were updated. The robot is simply constructed, with basic electronic controls, and is the same physical design as the current PackBots, it only lacks the digital processor.|$|R
