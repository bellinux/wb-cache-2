50|$|The {{leatherback}} {{sea turtle}} (<b>Dermochelys</b> <b>coriacea)</b> is the largest of all living sea turtles and the fourth largest modern reptile behind three crocodilians. It can easily be differentiated from other modern sea turtles by its lack of a bony shell. Instead, its carapace is covered by skin and oily flesh. <b>Dermochelys</b> <b>coriacea</b> is the only extant species of the Dermochelyidae family.|$|R
