We treated three children with renal failure and chronic iron overload with intraperitoneal deferoxamine therapy. Each child had an elevated serum ferritin level, a dense liver {{as measured by}} computerized tomography (Hounsfield Units) and one had dialysis related porphyria cutanea tarda. Deferoxamine therapy (10 to 17. 5 mg/kg) was given in the overnight exchange for three to six months. Prior to therapy, iron was not detected in the dialysate; {{during the course of}} therapy, daily dialysate iron removal averaged 5652 µg, 2241 µg and 4028 µg in the three children. The serum ferritin level fell during the course of therapy in two children who were estimated to be in negative <b>iron</b> <b>balance,</b> and was unchanged in the third who was estimated to be in positive <b>iron</b> <b>balance</b> due to frequent transfusions. In 10 children with chronic renal failure, there was a linear correlation (r= 0. 855; P< 0. 01) between the serum ferritin and the liver density, suggesting that an increased serum ferritin correlates with hepatic iron content. Interestingly, {{in each of the three}} children who received deferoxamine therapy, the liver density increased during therapy regardless of the estimated <b>iron</b> <b>balance</b> and the change in the serum ferritin level. We conclude that intraperitoneal deferoxamine therapy results in substantial iron losses in peritoneal dialysate, can result in negative <b>iron</b> <b>balance</b> but, in this study, did not result in lower liver iron content as measured by density on computerized tomography scan...|$|R

This study took a cross sectional analysis of 39 female students at California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly State University) in San Luis Obispo, CA between the ages of 18 and 22. Of the participants, 19 followed a vegetarian diet and 20 followed a nonvegetarian diet. Characteristic, demographic, and anthropometric data were collected and analyzed.

40|$|Athletes {{commonly}} use altitude {{exposure in}} an attempt to improve their aerobic performance at sea level. Altitude exposure enhances erythropoiesis and iron-dependent oxidative and glycolytic enzyme production, for this reason, athletes must maintain a healthy <b>iron</b> <b>balance</b> at altitude. A negative <b>iron</b> <b>balance</b> at altitude may limit such physiological adaptations, potentially reducing the performance benefits of altitude exposure. This thesis examined the regulation of iron metabolism during acute (~ 31 min, Study One) and prolonged altitude exposure (14 days, Study Two). Finally, Study Three examined how daily oral iron supplementation influenced haemoglobin mass (Hbmass) and iron parameter responses to prolonged, moderate altitude exposure in a large cohort of elite athletes. Specifically, Study One found acute (~ 31 min) interval exercise [5 × 4 min at 90 % of the maximal aerobic running velocity (vVO 2 max) ] increased post-exercise interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) production and elevated hepcidin production 3 h thereafter in both normoxia (fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO 2) = 0. 2093) and normobaric hypoxia (i. e. 3, 000 m simulated altitude; FIO 2 = 0. 1450). These results suggest exercise performed in acute hypoxia does not alter the post-exercise hepcidin response, relative to exercise in normoxia, possibly owing to the short duration of the hypoxic stimulus. Prolonged altitude exposure suppresses resting hepcidin levels in sojourning mountaineers, but its influence on the post-exercise hepcidin response exercise has not yet been investigated. Therefore, Study Two investigated how 14 days of live high: train low (LHTL) (exposure to 3, 000 m simulated altitude for 14 h. d- 1) influenced resting levels of hepcidin, erythropoietin (EPO) and blood iron parameters. Study Two also examined the post-exercise hepcidin and iron parameter responses to interval exercise (5 × 1, 000 m at 90 % of the maximal aerobic running velocity) performed in normoxia (600 m natural altitude) and normobaric hypoxia (i. e. ~ 3, 000 m simulated altitude), following 11 and 14 days of LHTL. The post-exercise hepcidin response was compared with interval exercise performed at a matched exercise intensity in normoxia or hypoxia before LHTL. Here, LHTL suppressed resting hepcidin levels after two days of exposure, but the post-exercise hepcidin response to interval exercise was similar in normoxia and hypoxia, both before and after LHTL. Additionally, Hbmass increased by 2. 2 % and plasma ferritin levels decreased following LHTL. In conclusion, prolonged, moderate altitude exposure suppresses resting hepcidin levels, which likely ensures more iron can be transported to the erythron to support accelerated erythropoiesis. Prolonged altitude exposure places a large burden on body iron stores because additional iron is required to support accelerated erythropoiesis. Accordingly, athletes often ingest oral iron supplements during altitude exposure to ensure they maintain a healthy <b>iron</b> <b>balance.</b> By analysing ten years of haematological data collected from welltrained athletes who undertook two-to-four weeks of LHTL at simulated (3, 000 m) or natural (1, 350 - 2, 700 m) altitudes, Study Three established how oral iron supplement dose moderates the Hbmass, serum ferritin and transferrin saturation response to prolonged moderate altitude exposure. In general, athletes supplemented with 105 mg. d- 1 or 210 mg. d- 1 of oral iron supplement increased their Hbmass from pre-altitude levels by 3. 3 % and 4. 0 % respectively. Serum ferritin levels decreased by 33. 2 % in non-iron supplemented athletes and by 13. 8 % in athletes supplemented with 105 mg. d- 1 of oral iron, however, those athletes who ingested 210 mg. d- 1 markedly increased their iron storage compartment by 36. 8 % after moderate altitude exposure. Thus, daily oral iron supplementation at altitude assists athletes to maintain a healthy <b>iron</b> <b>balance,</b> providing them with sufficient iron to sustain accelerated erythropoiesis. In conclusion, this thesis suggests exercise in acute hypoxia does not seem to alter the post-exercise hepcidin response relative to exercise in normoxia, but prolonged altitude exposure suppresses resting hepcidin levels and may attenuate the magnitude of postexercise hepcidin response after 14 days of LHTL. Finally, daily oral iron supplementation may support <b>iron</b> <b>balance</b> and Hbmass production in athletes undertaking prolonged moderate altitude exposure...|$|R
40|$|Maintaining a {{positive}} <b>iron</b> <b>balance</b> {{is essential for}} female athletes to avoid the effects of iron deficiency and anaemia and to maintain or improve performance. A major function of iron is {{in the production of}} the oxygen and carbon dioxide carrying molecule, haemoglobin via erythropoiesis. <b>Iron</b> <b>balance</b> is under the control of a number of factors including the peptide hormone hepcidin, dietary iron intake and absorption, environmental stressors (e. g. altitude), exercise, menstrual blood loss and genetics. Menstruating females, particularly those with heavy menstrual bleeding are at an elevated risk of iron deficiency. Haemoglobin concentration [Hb] and serum ferritin (sFer) are traditionally used to identify iron deficiency, however, in isolation these may have limited value in athletes due to: 1. the effects of fluctuations in plasma volume in response to training or the environment on [Hb], 2. the influence of inflammation on sFer and 3. the absence of sport, gender and individually specific normative data. A more detailed and longitudinal examination of haematology, menstrual cycle pattern, biochemistry, exercise physiology, environmental factors and training load can offer a superior characterisation of iron status and help to direct appropriate interventions that will avoid iron deficiency or iron overload. Supplementation is often required in iron deficiency; however, nutritional strategies to increase iron intake, rest, and descent from altitude can also be effective and will help to prevent future iron deficient episodes.
