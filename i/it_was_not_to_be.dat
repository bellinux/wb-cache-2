5|$|In 1990, {{following}} {{the cancellation of}} the live action series, the BBC approached the Canadian animation house Nelvana to propose an animated continuation of the show. The cartoon series was to feature an unspecified Doctor, incorporating elements of various BBC series Doctors. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> oriented to a younger audience than the live action series; rather, {{it was intended to}} be a continuation of the cancelled series in animated form in order to save costs, with design elements that would promote merchandise sales.|$|E
5|$|In addition, this marriage, {{which was}} {{endorsed}} by Emperor Justinian himself, marked Germanus out as the heir to both the East Roman and the Gothic realms. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be,</b> however: only {{two days before the}} army was to set out, in the early autumn of 550, he fell ill and died. His demise dashed any hopes for the reconciliation of Goth and Roman in Italy, and led to further years of bloodshed, until the peninsula was definitively conquered by the Byzantines.|$|E
5|$|For the season, {{he played}} in all 34 Bundesliga matches, {{starting}} 29, and recorded 13 goals and 11 assists. Bayern and Müller were back in Berlin the following week, to face Werder Bremen in {{the final of the}} DFB-Pokal. Müller started the match and Bayern won 4–0 to complete the domestic double. Müller scored four goals and made two assists during the competition, which made him its leading scorer for the season. Bayern's season ended in pursuit of a first treble, in the 2010 Champions League Final against Inter Milano at Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in Madrid. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be,</b> however, as they lost 2–0, with both goals coming from Diego Milito. Müller was in the starting line-up and had a key chance just after half-time, with Bayern 1–0 down, but his shot was saved by Júlio César. Müller felt particularly disappointed by this defeat, but he ended his first season as a first-team player with 52 matches played and 19 goals in all competitions.|$|E

In the first match on English soil, against East Molesey, Bill Johnston, Australia’s leading wicket-taker in 1948, broke {{down with a}} serious knee injury. Hassett {{struggled in}} the opening first-class matches in England, passing 40 only once in six innings. In the last match before the Tests, against Sussex, he hit an unbeaten 108. Australia's progress before the Tests was constantly curtailed by bad weather. Of the six first-class matches that Hassett played, three did not reach the second innings, although Australia did manage two victories.|$|E
5|$|In January 1973, {{hope was}} renewed when the Paris Peace Accord was signed, ending the {{conflict}} (for the time being) in South Vietnam and Laos. On 29 January, Lon Nol proclaimed a unilateral cease-fire throughout the nation. All U.S. bombing operations were halted {{in hopes of}} securing a chance for peace. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be.</b> The Khmer Rouge simply ignored the proclamation and carried on fighting. By March, heavy casualties, desertions, and low recruitment had forced Lon Nol to introduce conscription and, in April, insurgent forces launched an offensive that pushed into the suburbs of the capital. The U.S. Air Force responded by launching an intense bombing operation that forced the communists back into the countryside after being decimated by the air strikes. The US Seventh Air Force argued that the bombing prevented the fall of Phnom Penh in 1973 by killing 16,000 of 25,500 Khmer Rouge fighters besieging the city.|$|E

However, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> as Liverpool lost the FA Cup final 2–1. Borussia entered the match as German champions; they had won the 1976–77 Fußball-Bundesliga by a single point from Schalke and Eintracht Braunschweig.

5|$|Ruing their {{semifinal}} exit in 2004, São Paulo made {{an outstanding}} comeback in 2005 {{to contest the}} final with Atlético Paranaense. This became the first ever Copa Libertadores finals to feature two teams from the same football association; The Tricolor won their third crown after thrashing Atlético Paranaense in the final leg. The 2006 final was also an all-Brazilian affair, with defending champions São Paulo lining up against Internacional. Led by team captain Fernandão, the Colorados beat São Paulo 2–1 at Estádio do Morumbi and held the defending champions at a 2–2 draw at home in Porto Alegre as Internacional won their first ever title. Internacional's arch-rivals, Grêmio, surprised many by reaching the 2007 final with a relatively young squad. However, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> as Boca Juniors, reinforced by aging but still-capable players, came away with the trophy to win their sixth title.|$|E
5|$|SR282 was {{initially}} designated in 1967 solely along Fourth Street from SR75 to the Naval Air Station; however, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in effect until the San Diego–Coronado Bridge was completed. Nevertheless, before the bridge opened, the designation was {{added in the}} 1968 legislative session, along with the portion of Orange Avenue from the Coronado Ferry landing to Fourth Street, {{which was to be}} removed once the Coronado Bay Bridge opened. The designation came into effect on February 21, 1969. In April, plans were under way to repave Fourth and Third Streets and add signals at the Orange Avenue intersections. The bridge opened on August 3, 1969. In September, the City of Coronado added Third Street as a truck route going westbound to the base, in addition to the already-existing Fourth Street truck route leaving the base.|$|E
5|$|Aldridge {{also started}} the seventh game on October 15. It had been raining {{for a week}} in Pittsburgh, and the sixth game had been rainy. The weather for the seventh was even worse, and the game was played in thick pea soup fog and drizzle, with a very wet {{pitching}} mound. It was hoped that Aldridge would continue his success {{in the first two}} games to the seventh, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be.</b> Although noted for his consistency, in this game Aldridge was very wild; he had had only two days rest and he kept slipping on the slick pitcher's plate. Sam Rice was the first batter, and he hit a single. Then Bucky Harris came out, whose fly out was the only success Aldridge had during the game. Goose Goslin was walked after a wild pitch. Joe Harris was walked after a wild pitch advanced the baserunners. After a full count, Joe Judge was walked, scoring in one run. Then Ossie Bluege hit a single. Pirates manager Bill McKechnie had seen enough and relieved Aldridge. In total, Aldridge gave up three walks, two hits and two wild pitches, resulting in the Senators having a 4–0 lead in the first inning. The Pirates would rally to win the game and the World Series by a score of 9–7, the first time a team won the World Series after a 3–1 deficit. It was the worst start of the seventh game for a pitcher in Series history.|$|E

5|$|In 1535, the abbey's {{income was}} only {{assessed}} at £155 in the Valor Ecclesiasticus, Henry VIII's great survey of church finances. It meant {{the following year}} that it came {{under the terms of}} the first Suppression Act, Henry's initial move in the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Abbot William Dovell and his 16monks were forced to surrender the abbey on 6 September 1536. There were proposals from local gentry and even some of the king's officials for the Dissolution such as Sir Thomas Arundell that Cleeve should be granted a reprieve, as a number of others among the smaller monasteries were, however, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> and the monks finally left in the spring of 1537. Abbot William was given a pension of 40marks per year, not large but certainly comfortable, which he was still drawing 20years later. Most of the other monks were given pensions too. One former monk of Cleeve rose to prominence and came to a sticky end. This was John Hooper who became Bishop of Gloucester and Worcester and was killed in 1555 for his Protestant beliefs by Mary I.|$|E
