500|$|On June 21, 2005, {{the day of}} {{the release}} of his album TheFutureEmbrace, Corgan took out full-page {{advertisements}} in the Chicago Tribune and Chicago Sun-Times to announce that he planned to reunite the band. [...] "For a year now", Corgan wrote, [...] "I have walked around with a secret, a secret I chose to keep. But now <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> among the first to know that I have made plans to renew and revive the Smashing Pumpkins. I want my band back, and my songs, and my dreams". Corgan and Chamberlin were verified as participants in the reunion, but there was question as to whether other former members of the band would participate.|$|E
500|$|... "Carry Out" [...] is one {{of twelve}} songs written and {{produced}} by Timbaland and J-Roc for Timbaland's third studio album Shock Value II (2009). Justin Timberlake, Attitude and Jim Beanz, notable collaborators with Timbaland, also assisted {{in the writing of}} the song. Timbaland, in an interview with MTV's Shaheem Reed and Gil Kaufman, stated that he favored this song over other recordings because the process for creating the song was similar to those of other collaborations they have done. Timberlake would come into the studio and listen to the track. Afterwards, he would then compose the lyrics in his head. Upon explaining their method of making music, Timbaland stated that: [...] "We got a chemistry that cannot be described. People ask, 'Well, what are you and Justin like?' Can't tell you what it's like — it's a chemistry that can't be described. Something you would have to see for yourself and be, like, 'Them two got magic'." [...] Timbaland stated that the song resembles a [...] "2010 version" [...] of Snoop Dogg's [...] "Drop It Like It's Hot", produced by The Neptunes. He also revealed that the intention of the song was to provide a different slang for women: [...] "Instead of 'Your phat butt' or 'Your big breasts,' we say, 'Oh, I need you. Can I be your carry out? Be my carry out. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> my dinner, my leftovers, my everything.' It's a different slang. We're grown men, I wanna be subliminal to females. Like, 'Oooh, carry out? That's kinda sexy'." ...|$|E
2500|$|Within a {{week after}} the November 4, 2008, presidential election, President-elect Obama and Clinton {{discussed}} over telephone the possibility of her serving as U.S. Secretary of State in his administration. Clinton later related, [...] "He said <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> my secretary of state. And I said, 'Oh, no, you don't.' I said, 'Oh, please, there's so many other people who could do this.'" [...] Clinton initially turned Obama down, but he persisted. Some Democratic senators welcomed the idea of her leaving, having been allied with Obama during the campaign, and believing that Clinton had risked party disunity by keeping her candidacy going for so long.|$|E

On the show he claimed he and Smith had a passionate love affair that lasted for two years and that Smith suffered from life-threatening seizures, for which she was on medication. When asked if Smith ever revealed to him the identity of her daughter's father, Denk responded, [...] "She always told me she wanted to have her kids with me." [...] Denk was not certain he was the baby's father and told Banderas that Smith [...] "always told me <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> there and care for Dannielynn no matter what, no matter who is the father, because I took care of Anna with her health and everything, and she wanted to make sure her baby is healthy.

2500|$|The overall gloominess of A Song of Ice and Fire {{can be an}} {{obstacle}} for some readers; the Inchoatus Group writes that, [...] "If this absence of joy is going to trouble you, or you're looking for something more affirming, then you should probably seek elsewhere." [...] However, for many fans, {{it is precisely this}} level of [...] "realness" [...] and [...] "completeness"–including many characters' imperfections, moral and ethical ambiguity, and (often sudden) consequential plot twists–that is endearing about Martin's work. Many find that this is what makes the series' story arcs compelling enough to keep following despite its sheer brutality and intricately messy and interwoven plotlines; as TM Wagner points out: There's great tragedy here, but there's also excitement, humor, heroism even in weaklings, nobility even in villains, and, now and then, a taste of justice after all. It's a rare gift when a writer can invest his story with that much humanity.Martin's characters are multifaceted, each with intricate pasts, aspirations, and ambitions. Publishers Weekly writes of his ongoing epic fantasy A Song of Ice and Fire: [...] "The complexity of characters such as Daenerys, Arya and the Kingslayer will keep readers turning even the vast number of pages contained in this volume, for the author, like Tolkien or Jordan, makes us care about their fates." [...] Misfortune, injury, and death (including false death and reanimation) often befall major or minor characters, no matter how attached the reader has become. Martin has described his penchant for killing off important characters as being necessary for the story's depth: [...] "when my characters are in danger, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> afraid to turn the page, (so) you need to show right from the beginning that you're playing for keeps".|$|E
2500|$|On December 9 at 1230 (GMT) {{bilateral}} {{talks between}} the CNDP and Kinshasa government opened at the United Nations headquarters in the Kenyan capital city of Nairobi, mediated by UN envoy Olusegun Obasanjo; the respective leaders of the two groups, Laurent Nkunda and President Joseph Kabila, did not participate. Kenyan Foreign Minister Moses Wetangula issued {{a statement to the}} delegations telling them to [...] "put aside your differences and realise that you have only one Congo, and that the international community is here with you to encourage and assist you. Please don't let Africa and your country down." [...] The talks, chaired by President Mwai Kibaki and attended by former President of Tanzania Benjamin Mkapa, who represented the African Union, were referred to as [...] "an opportunity that should neither be lost nor wasted" [...] by Obasanjo, who stated that [...] "A military solution is not an option. We appeal to your principles to make this dialogue a success." [...] Obasanjo went on to declare that the talks should accomplish a permanent cease-fire in eastern Congo, continued reinforcement of a corridor for humanitarian assistance in the region, and a lasting peace in Congo; he also praised the delegations for their efforts. Wetangula added, [...] "The pictures and clips we have been seeing on international TV screens remains a terrible indictment to all of us Africans, you Congolese in particular. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> awake {{to the fact that the}} children, the women, the boys and girls that we see on TV every day may be your sons and daughters, may be your brothers and sisters, may be your parents.
