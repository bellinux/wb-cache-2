40|$|Abstract Background Identifying {{effective}} <b>drug</b> <b>combinations</b> {{that significantly}} improve over single agents is a challenging problem. Pairwise combinations already represent a huge screening effort. Beyond two <b>drug</b> <b>combinations</b> the task seems unfeasible. Results In this work we introduce {{a method to}} uncover <b>drug</b> <b>combinations</b> with a putative effective response when presented to a heterogeneous population of malignant agents (strains), such as cancer cell lines or viruses. Using data quantifying the effect of single drugs over several individual strains, we search for minimal <b>drug</b> <b>combinations</b> that successfully target all strains. We show that the latter problem can be mapped to a minimal hitting set problem in mathematics. We illustrate this approach using data for the NCI 60 panel of tumor derived cell lines, uncovering 14 anticancer <b>drug</b> <b>combinations.</b> Conclusion The drug-response graph and the associated minimal hitting set method {{can be used to}} uncover effective <b>drug</b> <b>combinations</b> in anticancer <b>drug</b> screens and drug development programs targeting heterogeneous populations of infectious agents such as HIV. </p...|$|R
40|$|Combinatorial {{therapy is}} a {{promising}} strategy for combating complex disorders due to improved efficacy and reduced side effects. However, screening new <b>drug</b> <b>combinations</b> exhaustively is impractical considering all possible <b>combinations</b> between <b>drugs.</b> Here, {{we present a}} novel computational approach to predict <b>drug</b> <b>combinations</b> by integrating molecular and pharmacological data. Specifically, drugs are represented {{by a set of}} their properties, such as their targets or indications. By integrating several of these features, we show that feature patterns enriched in approved <b>drug</b> <b>combinations</b> are not only predictive for new <b>drug</b> <b>combinations</b> but also provide insights into mechanisms underlying combinatorial therapy. Further analysis confirmed that among our top ranked predictions of effective combinations, 69 % are supported by literature, while the others represent novel potential <b>drug</b> <b>combinations.</b> We believe that our proposed approach can help to limit the search space of <b>drug</b> <b>combinations</b> and provide a new way to effectively utilize existing drugs for new purposes...|$|R

25|$|Methylene blue was {{identified}} by Paul Ehrlich about 1891 {{as a possible}} treatment for malaria. It disappeared as an anti-malarial during the Pacific War in the tropics, since American and Allied soldiers disliked its two prominent, but reversible side effects: turning the urine blue or green, and the sclera (the whites of the eyes) blue. Interest in its use as an anti-malarial has recently been revived, especially due to its low price.

2500|$|Combinations of antiretrovirals create {{multiple}} {{obstacles to}} HIV replication {{to keep the}} number of offspring low and reduce {{the possibility of a}} superior mutation. If a mutation that conveys resistance to one of the drugs being taken arises, the other drugs continue to suppress reproduction of that mutation. [...] With rare exceptions, no individual antiretroviral drug has been demonstrated to suppress an HIV infection for long; these agents must be taken in combinations {{in order to have a}} lasting effect. [...] As a result, the standard of care is to use combinations of antiretroviral drugs. Combinations usually consist of three drugs from at least two different classes. This three <b>drug</b> <b>combination</b> is commonly known as a triple cocktail. Combinations of antiretrovirals are subject to positive and negative synergies, which limits the number of useful combinations.|$|E

[...] Later reviews in the late 90s and early 2000s noted that this approach of [...] "hit hard, hit early" [...] ran significant risks of increasing side effects and development of multidrug resistance, and this approach was largely abandoned. The only consensus was on treating patients with advanced immunosuppression (CD4 counts less than 350/μL). Treatment with antiretrovirals was expensive at the time, ranging from $10,000 to $15,000 a year.|$|E

40|$|During polychemotherapy, {{cytotoxic}} {{drugs are}} given in combinations to enhance their anti-tumor effectiveness. For most <b>drug</b> <b>combinations,</b> underlying signaling mechanisms responsible for positive drug-drug interactions remain elusive. Here, we prove a decisive role for the Bcl- 2 family member NOXA to mediate cell death by certain <b>drug</b> <b>combinations,</b> even if <b>drugs</b> were combined which acted independently from NOXA, when given alone. In proof-of-principle studies, betulinic acid, doxorubicin and vincristine induced cell death in a p 53 - and NOXA-independent pathway involving mitochondrial pore formation, release of cytochrome c and caspase activation. In contrast, when betulinic acid was combined with either doxorubicine or vincristine, cell death signaling changed considerably; the <b>drug</b> <b>combinations</b> clearly depended on both p 53 and NOXA. Similarly and of high clinical relevance, in patient-derived childhood acute leukemia samples the <b>drug</b> <b>combinations,</b> but not the single drugs depended on p 53 and NOXA, as shown by RNA interference studies in patient-derived cells. Our data emphasize that NOXA represents an important target molecule for <b>combinations</b> of <b>drugs</b> that alone do not target NOXA. NOXA might have a special role in regulating apoptosis sensitivity in the complex interplay of polychemotherapy.

40|$|Background and objective: Risk/benefit {{profile of}} {{prescribed}} drug regimens is unkown. Over 60 % of commonly used medications interact on metabolic pathways (cytochrom P 450 (CYP 450), uridyl-glucuronyl tranferasis (UGT I, II) and P-glycoprotein (PGP) transport). Using an up-to-date knowledge on metabolic drug interactions, we aimed {{the study to}} determine the medication risk of commonly prescribed <b>drug</b> <b>combinations.</b> Design: A mathematical model was created to estimate the medication risk in various <b>drug</b> <b>combinations</b> considering (1) metabolic properties of medications prescribed in the sample, (2) medications' affinity to major and alternate metabolic pathways, (3) metabolic capacity of the enzymatic systems and their feasibility to inhibition or induction (CYP 2 C 19, CYP 3 A 4, CYP 2 D 6, CYP 2 C 8 / 9, CYP 1 A 2, UGT 1 and 2, PGP) and (4) medication potential to induct or inhibit metabolic pathways. The dataset of the EU ADHOC project (Aged in Home Care, 2001, 2003) was used, especially comprehensive medication data on the representative samples of home care elderly in the Czech Republic (CZ), Norway (NO) and Netherlands (NL); 1015 patients 65 (CZ= 430, NO= 388 and NL= 197). Main Outcome Measures: 1. Proportion of <b>drug</b> <b>combinations</b> with potentially harmful methabolic interactions; 2. medications having high potential to frequently reachtnigher plasmatic levels in various <b>drug</b> <b>combinations</b> (in o ver 90 % fo drug combinations); 3. medications having high potential to seriously increase drug level (about 95 % and more of expected level) in prescribed <b>drug</b> <b>combinations.</b> Results: Potentially harmful metabolics interaction were identified in 40 % (n= 460) of prescribed <b>drug</b> <b>combinations</b> (CZ 65. 8 %, NL 41, 1 %, NO 35. 6 %) mostly on CYP 3 A$ or CYP 2 D 2 metabolic pathways. High potential to frequently increase drug levels in various combinations was documented for omeprazol, glibenclamide, blimepiride, metoprolol, ibuprofen, dilthiazem, tolbutamide, flunitrazepam and zolpidem. Among medications which seriously increase drug levels in different <b>drug</b> <b>combinations</b> were determined: acetylsalicylic acidm, glipizid, nifedipin, metoprolol, omeprazol, amlopidin, ibuprofen, alprazolam, oxybutynin, flunitrazepam, glimepirid, thiaprofenic, acid, ciniarizin, verapamil and digoxin.
