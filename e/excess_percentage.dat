40|$|Background: A {{significant}} increase in mortality was observed during cold winters in many temperate regions. However, {{there is a lack}} of evidence from tropical and subtropical regions, and the influence of ambient temperatures on seasonal variation of mortality was not well documented. Methods: This study included 213, 737 registered deaths from January 2003 to December 2011 in Guangzhou, a subtropical city in Southern China. Excess winter mortality was calculated by the <b>excess</b> <b>percentage</b> of monthly mortality in winters over that of non-winter months. A generalized linear model with a quasi-Poisson distribution was applied to analyze the association between monthly mean temperature and mortality, after controlling for other meteorological measures and air pollution. Results: The mortality rate in the winter was 26 % higher than the average rate in other seasons. On average, there were 1, 848 excess winter deaths annually, with around half (52 %) from cardiovascular diseases and a quarter (24 %) from respiratory diseases. Excess winter mortality was higher in the elderly, females and those with low education level than the young, males and those with high education level, respectively. A much larger winter increase was observed in out-of-hospital mortality compared to in-hospital mortality (45 % vs. 17 %). We found a significant negative correlation of annual excess winter mortality with average winter temperature (rs=- 0. 738, P= 0. 037), but not with ai...|$|E
40|$|Energy {{transition}} {{is a task}} faced by every country in order to combat climate change, therefore, the choice of renewable energy supporting policy is a crucial decision for politicians. In Europe, since Renewable Energy Directive was agreed in 2009, various policy schemes have been adopted in many countries, and Swedish Electricity Certificate System is one of them. Starting from 2003 until now, it has assisted Sweden to become the country with highest percentage of renewable electricity in total electricity generation among all the European member countries, and has included Norway from 2012 to create a joint market for electricity certificates between these two counties. However, the increase of renewable electricity production is {{only one part of}} the picture, while the other part is involved with concerns on the inequity among renewable electricity producers within the system. During more than tens years of operation, the systems has generated a large amount of benefits for a small share of renewable electricity producers, who have already been phased out of the system by the end of 2014, after obtaining <b>excess</b> <b>percentage</b> of payment by consumers. The technology-neutral nature of the policy scheme needs to be questioned, because it not only has created the equity issue in the past, but also indicates the same issue potentially in the future. The {{purpose of this study is}} to find out to what extent this inequity existed in the past, the impacts on different renewable electricity producers, and whether the inequity will continue to happen in the future. These conclusions will help us to see if the Swedish Electricity Certificate System is really a sustainable policy, or the one needs to be improved...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Reported {{associations}} between preparing and eating home cooked food, and both diet and health, are inconsistent. Most {{previous research has}} focused on preparing, rather than eating, home cooked food; used small, non-population based samples; and studied markers of nutrient intake, rather than overall diet quality or health. We aimed to assess whether frequency of consuming home cooked meals was cross-sectionally associated with diet quality and cardio-metabolic health. Methods We used baseline data from a United Kingdom population-based cohort study of adults aged 29 to 64  years (n =  11, 396). Participants self-reported frequency of consuming home cooked main meals. Diet quality was assessed using the Mediterranean Diet Score, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score, fruit and vegetable intake calculated from a 130 -item food frequency questionnaire, and plasma vitamin C. Markers of cardio-metabolic health were researcher-measured body mass index (BMI), percentage body fat, haemoglobin A 1 c (HbA 1 c), cholesterol and hypertension. Differences across the three exposure categories were assessed using linear regression (diet variables) and logistic regression (health variables). Results Eating home cooked meals more frequently was associated with greater adherence to DASH and Mediterranean diets, greater fruit and vegetable intakes and higher plasma vitamin C, in adjusted models. Those eating home cooked meals more than five times, compared with less than three times per week, consumed 62. 3  g more fruit (99 % CI 43. 2 to 81. 5) and 97. 8  g more vegetables (99 % CI 84. 4 to 111. 2) daily. More frequent consumption of home cooked meals was associated with greater likelihood of having normal range BMI and normal percentage body fat. Associations with HbA 1 c, cholesterol and hypertension were not significant in adjusted models. Those consuming home cooked meals more than five times, compared with less than three times per week, were 28 % less likely to have overweight BMI (99 % CI 8 to 43 %), and 24 % less likely to have <b>excess</b> <b>percentage</b> body fat (99 % CI 5 to 40 %). Conclusions In a large population-based cohort study, eating home cooked meals more frequently was associated with better dietary quality and lower adiposity. Further prospective research is required to identify whether consumption of home cooked meals has causal effects on diet and health...|$|E

40|$|Background Patients with {{evidence}} of vascular disease {{are at increased risk}} for subsequent vascular events despite effective use of statins to lower the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level. Niacin lowers the LDL cholesterol level and raises the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol level, but its clinical efficacy and safety are uncertain. Methods After a prerandomization run-in phase to standardize the background statin-based LDL cholesterol–lowering therapy and to establish participants' ability to take extended-release niacin without clinically significant adverse effects, we randomly assigned 25, 673 adults with vascular disease to receive 2 g of extended-release niacin and 40 mg of laropiprant or a matching placebo daily. The primary outcome was the first major vascular event (nonfatal myocardial infarction, death from coronary causes, stroke, or arterial revascularization). Results During a median follow-up period of 3. 9 years, participants who were assigned to extended-release niacin–laropiprant had an LDL cholesterol level that was an average of 10 mg per deciliter (0. 25 mmol per liter as measured in the central laboratory) lower and an HDL cholesterol level that was an average of 6 mg per deciliter (0. 16 mmol per liter) higher than the levels in those assigned to placebo. Assignment to niacin–laropiprant, as compared with assignment to placebo, had no significant effect on the incidence of major vascular events (13. 2 % and 13. 7 % of participants with an event, respectively; rate ratio, 0. 96; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 90 to 1. 03; P= 0. 29). Niacin–laropiprant was associated with an increased incidence of disturbances in diabetes control that were considered to be serious (absolute excess as compared with placebo, 3. 7 percentage points; Pandlt; 0. 001) and with an increased incidence of diabetes diagnoses (absolute <b>excess,</b> 1. 3 <b>percentage</b> points; Pandlt; 0. 001), as well as increases in serious adverse events associated with the gastrointestinal system (absolute <b>excess,</b> 1. 0 <b>percentage</b> point; Pandlt; 0. 001), musculoskeletal system (absolute <b>excess,</b> 0. 7 <b>percentage</b> points; Pandlt; 0. 001), skin (absolute <b>excess,</b> 0. 3 <b>percentage</b> points; P= 0. 003), and unexpectedly, infection (absolute <b>excess,</b> 1. 4 <b>percentage</b> points; Pandlt; 0. 001) and bleeding (absolute <b>excess,</b> 0. 7 <b>percentage</b> points; Pandlt; 0. 001).

40|$|Recent studies {{indicate}} that species richness can enhance the ability of plant assemblages to support multiple ecosystem functions. To understand how and when ecosystem services depend on biodiversity, it is valuable to expand beyond experimental grasslands. We examined whether plant diversity improves the capacity of agroecosystems to sustain multiple ecosystem services—production of wood and forage, and two elements of soil formation—in two types of smallholder fallows in western Kenya. In 18 grazed and 21 improved fallows, we estimated biomass and quantified soil organic carbon, soil base cations, sand content, and soil infiltration capacity. For four ecosystem functions (wood biomass, forage biomass, soil base cations, steady infiltration rates) linked to the focal ecosystem services, we quantified ecosystem service multi-functionality as (1) the proportion of functions above half-maximum, and (2) mean <b>percentage</b> <b>excess</b> above mean function values, and assessed whether plant diversity or environmental favorability better predicted multi-functionality. In grazed fallows, positive effects of plant diversity best explained the proportion above half-maximum and mean <b>percentage</b> <b>excess,</b> the former also declining with grazing intensity. In improved fallows, the proportion above half-maximum {{was not associated with}} soil carbon or plant diversity, while soil carbon predicted mean <b>percentage</b> <b>excess</b> better than diversity.

AIM: To evaluate the nutritional status {{as well as}} {{the quality of life of}} obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery. METHODS: A transversal study was conducted with obese adults of both genders who underwent bariatric surgery by Fobi-Capella technique for at least 30 days. It was evaluated: age, gender, marital status, occupation, weight before surgery, current weight, height, preoperative and current BMI, weight loss and loss of <b>excess</b> weight <b>percentages,</b> presence of clinical manifestations and food intolerances. RESULTS: The sample consisted of 70 patients, being 81. 4 % female, 37. 1 % aged 30 to 39 years, 58. 6 % were married, 41. 4 % have undergone the bariatric surgery in the last 12 months.

This approach solves a very challenging problem {{in the area of}} rotary furnace i. e. selection of optimal process parameters for producing homogenous quality castings. Rotary furnace involves several critical parameters like flame temperature, preheat air temperature, rotational speed of the furnace, <b>excess</b> air <b>percentage,</b> melting time, fuel consumption and melting rate of the molten metal which should be controlled throughout the melting process. In this paper the relation between input parameters such as flame temperature, preheat air temperature, rotational speed of the furnace and <b>excess</b> air <b>percentage</b> is established with output parameters such as melting time, fuel consumption and melting rate. Our model of feed-forward and backward ANN can work in practical scenario of industry by predicting the output process parameter in any number, this also help the decision maker to know the impact of input parameter on output of furnace before actually running it and input parameter needed to fed to the rotary furnace to have output of perquisite parameter. Back propagation neural network is used as a decision support tool. The network maps the forward and reverse relationship between process inputs and process output and predicts the optimal process parameters almost instantaneously. Accuracy of the forecast depends on training of the input parameters and a well trained set of parameters provides high accuracy. Trained network replaces the knowledge of an experienced worker reducing labor cost drastically.

40|$|The soybean is a legume {{which has}} an ability to supply its major {{nitrogen}} need by the biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) process. This process is made possible by nodules formed in their roots, colonized by Rhizobium sp. bacteria. An accurate estimation of N gained by BNF is necessary to predict the increase or decrease of chemical fertilizer-N requirements to increase soybean production. Among several methods, the 15 N method was used to estimate the ability of legumes to perform BNF. The study involved soybean var. Willis (W) and a completely non-BNF soybean var. CV, which is termed as a standard crop. The standard crop is non-nodulated soybean, but {{it has the same}} main physiological traits with var. Willis. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether 15 N-labelled fertilizer with different %a. e. given to nodulated and non-nodulated soybean would not be of significant consequences for the calculation of N-BNF of W. The treatments applied were different rates of urea (20 kg N/ha and 100 kg N/ha) combined with different atom <b>excess</b> <b>percentages</b> (%a. e.) 15 N (2 % and 10 %). Thus, the combination of treatments were as follows:(1) W-ll (20 kg N; 2 % a. e); (2) CV-hl (100 kg N; 2 % a. e); (3) W-lh (20 kg N; 10 % a. e); (4) CV-hh (100 kg N; 10 % a. e); (5) CV-ll (20 kg N; 2 % a. e); (6) W-hl (100 kg N; 2 % a. e); (7) CV-lh (20 kg N; 10 % a. e); (8) W-hh (100 kg N; 10 % a. e).

The cluster of high mortality risk areas identified in the southwest of Spain during 1987 - 1995 persisted in the period 1996 - 2004 with {{an increase in the number}} of highrisk areas and in annual excess of mortality. These increases showed a gender difference, being more pronounced in women...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundSleeve {{gastrectomy}} {{is being}} performed {{with increasing frequency}} in Australia {{for the treatment of}} morbid obesity. The aims of this study were to show that sleeve gastrectomy can be performed safely with a low rate of complications and effective short to medium term weight loss. MethodsA retrospective review of prospectively collected data from a single surgeon series between 2006 and 2009. ResultsA total of 185 patients were treated with laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) over a three-year period. The <b>percentage</b> <b>excess</b> weight loss (%EWL) was 47. 2 % at one year, 60. 7 % at two years and 66 % at three years. There were no leaks; two staple line bleeds requiring reoperation via laparoscopy, one port site infection and one port site incisional hernia. There were no deaths. The average operating time was 111  min and the average hospital length of stay was 2. 35 days. ConclusionLaparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy can be performed safely and with excellent weight loss. More long term follow up is required...|$|R
30|$|Combining PP and RG {{continued}} to result {{with the greatest}} reduction percentages for both runoff volumes and peak flows for all recurrence intervals. RG had the second greatest reduction in runoff volumes and peak flows followed by PP and the DP scenario had the least reduction <b>percentages.</b> <b>Excess</b> shear analysis for both design storms and real storm in the Blunn Creek showed agreement with findings. All in all, this reduction in total runoff could prevent not only stream bank from getting eroded only but also contributes to restoring pre-development hydrology which has {{an important role in}} maintaining the aquatic life and restoring the ecological system. In addition, maintaining pre-development hydrology throughout the peak flow reduction encourages water storage and infiltration, which in turn reduces urban flooding {{and at the same time}} increases recharging local groundwater aquifers and streams. It is important to note that the average reduction in both total volumes of runoff and peak flow is consistent with the finding of Cheveney and Buchberger (2013) for the studied scenarios.|$|R
40|$|Environmentally {{conscious}} decision making {{has become a}} prominent topic in business {{that has the potential}} to affect the public opinion and performance of companies. This project seeks to identify whether or not positive changes in excess return might offer an incentive for companies to adopt green initiatives. It examines the ways in which companies’ green initiatives, as measured by their annual Carbon Disclosure Project S 2 ̆ 6 P 500 Climate Change Report score, impact their stock price. In other words, is there value in “going green”? It is hypothesized that companies exhibiting greater variance in their environmental initiatives from one year to the next (whether positive or negative) will see larger impacts on their stock price surrounding the release date of the rankings. This paper is an event study comparing the magnitude of the change in a company’s annual Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) score to the magnitude of their <b>percentage</b> <b>excess</b> return change in stock price. In the end, the hypothesis was not proven to be true because the results were not statistically significant...|$|R
30|$|There {{are already}} several studies that states {{the fact that}} the LRYGB surgery is more {{effective}} than the LAGB surgery, both in younger and in older population. (Arterburn et al. 2014; Colquitt et al. 2014; Chapman et al. 2004; Daigle et al. 2016; Zuegel et al. 2012; Angrisani et al. 2013). SADS is at least as effective as the LAGB if not more. So {{the fact that the}} weight loss for SADS is better than the LAGB is not surprising. What is of interest, in this case, is the comparison between the LRYGB and the SADS in terms of weight loss. Our previously published literature, have clearly demonstrated weight loss better with SADS when compared to LRYGB in younger population, and this study reciprocates our results with the elderly population (Cottam et al. 2015). The <b>percentage</b> <b>excess</b> BMI lost from the SADS differs statistically from the LRYGB from 9 to 18  months as shown in Fig.  1 while Table  3 also speaks in favor of the SADS over the LRYGB while considering BMI reduction. This is similar to what Torres reported in his paper (Sánchez-Pernaute et al. 2010).|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: We report {{morphology}} {{and mechanical}} properties of natural nanoclay incorporated spunbond polypropylene composite webs. Nanocomposite spunbond webs were produced {{with up to}} 5 wt % natural nanoclay additives on ReicofilV R- 2 spunbond line. Influence of nano-clay on the resin rheological properties, processibility, and mechanical properties of webs were studied. Wide angle X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy analysis were used to investigate the nanocomposite mor-phology. Intercalated and flocculated morphology was observed for all the concentrates {{and for all the}} spunbond fiber webs. The microstructure and polymer morphology in the presence of additives was characterized using a polarized optical microscope. At higher <b>percentage,</b> <b>excess</b> clay platelets were excluded out of the spherulite bounda-ries. About 20 – 30 % increase in tear strength was observed for webs with up to 2 wt % nanoclay additives. Compared with the control polypropylene spunbond web, nanoclay re-inforced samples showed better dimensional stability. Dif-ferent failure mode was observed for spunbond webs with additives. Spunbond webs with even as low as 1 wt % clay retain their morphology and integrity in bond point after thermal bonding. Nanoclay incorporated spunbond webs showed significant improvements in the stiffness. VC 201...|$|R
40|$|The use of daylight-linked {{controls}} (DLCs) can be {{a valuable}} design strategy to improve lighting conditions of indoor environment and to obtain considerable energy savings. These systems continuously adjust luminaires flux emission to maintain a constant illuminance level at the workplane, accounting for daylight availability. However, depending on their setting and operating conditions, they can provide more or less light than necessary, determining light excess or deficit at the workplane. Generally, the quality of control strategies is measured through achievable energy savings, but this approach is too inaccurate, since it does not inform {{about the ability of}} the system to provide adequate lighting conditions. Given that, the paper proposes new indices to describe DLCs performances: Daylight Integration Adequacy (DIA), Percentage Light Deficit (LD%), <b>Percentage</b> Intrinsic Light <b>Excess</b> (ILE%) and <b>Percentage</b> Light Waste (LW%). DIA (and complementary parameters DIA− and DIA+) describes the occurrence of different control operating conditions (ideal functioning, intrinsic light excess, light deficit and light waste) during a specific period. LD%, ILE% and LW% define the quantity of wasted or lacking light. Moreover, a simple case study is presented, in order to demonstrate the simplicity in calculating these parameters and their usefulness...|$|R
40|$|Ambient air {{pollution}} {{has been associated}} with respiratory diseases in children. However, its effects on pediatric pneumonia have not been meta-analyzed. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the short-term association between ambient {{air pollution}} and hospitalization of children due to pneumonia. We searched the Web of Science and PubMed for indexed publications up to January 2017. Pollutant-specific <b>excess</b> risk <b>percentage</b> (ER%) and confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using random effect models for particulate matter (PM) with diameter ≤  10 (PM 10) and ≤ 2. 5  μm (PM 2. 5), sulfur dioxide (SO 2), ozone (O 3), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2), and carbon monoxide (CO). Results were further stratified by subgroups (children under five, emergency visits versus hospital admissions, income level of study location, and exposure period). Seventeen studies were included in the meta-analysis. The ER% per 10  μg/m(3) increase of pollutants was 1. 5 % (95 % CI: 0. 6 %- 2. 4 %) for PM 10 and 1. 8 % (95 % CI: 0. 5 %- 3. 1 %) for PM 2. 5. The corresponding values per 10  ppb increment of gaseous pollutants were 2. 9 % (95 % CI: 0. 4 %- 5. 3 %) for SO 2, 1. 7 % (95 % CI: 0. 5 %- 2. 8 %) for O 3, and 1. 4 % (95 % CI: 0. 4 %- 2. 4 %) for NO 2. ER% per 1000  ppb increment of CO was 0. 9 % (95 % CI: 0. 0 %- 1. 9 %). Associations were not substantially different between subgroups. This meta-analysis shows a positive association between daily levels of ambient air pollution markers and hospitalization of children due to pneumonia. However, lack of studies from low-and middle-income countries limits the quantitative generalizability given that susceptibilities to the adverse effects of air pollution may be different in those populations. The meta-regression in our analysis further demonstrated a strong effect of country income level on heterogeneity...|$|R
