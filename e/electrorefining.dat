40|$|An {{attractive}} {{alternative to}} the once-through disposal of <b>electrorefiner</b> salt is to selectively remove the active fission products from the salt and recycle the salt back to the <b>electrorefiner</b> (ER). This would allow salt reuse for some number of cycles before ultimate disposal of the salt in a ceramic waste form. Reuse of ER salt would, thus, greatly reduce the volume of ceramic waste produced during the pyroprocessing of spent nuclear fuel. This final portion of the joint I-NERI research project is to demonstrate the separation of fission products from molten ER salt by two methods previously selected during phase two (FY- 08) of this project. The two methods selected were salt/zeolite contacting and rare-earth fission product precipitation by oxygen bubbling. The ER salt used in these tests came from the Mark-IV <b>electrorefiner</b> used to anodically dissolved driver fuel from the EBR-II reactor on the INL site. The tests were performed using the Hot Fuel Dissolution Apparatus (HFDA) located in the main cell of the Hot Fuels Examination Facility (HFEF) at the Materials and Fuels complex on the INL site. Results from these tests were evaluated during a joint meeting of KAERI and INL investigators to provide recommendations as to the future direction of fission product removal from <b>electrorefiner</b> salt that accumulate during spent fuel treatment.

40|$|During the pyroprocessing of spent {{nuclear fuel}} by {{electrochemical}} techniques, fission products are separated as the fuel is oxidized at the anode and refined uranium is deposited at the cathode. Those fission products that are oxidized into the molten salt electrolyte are considered active metals while {{those that do not}} react are considered noble metals. The primary noble metals encountered during pyroprocessing are molybdenum, zirconium, ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, and technetium. Pyroprocessing of spent fuel to date has involved two distinctly different <b>electrorefiner</b> designs, in particular the anode to cathode configuration. For one <b>electrorefiner,</b> the anode and cathode collector are horizontally displaced such that uranium is transported across the electrolyte medium. As expected, the noble metal removal from the uranium during refining is very high, typically in excess of 99 %. For the other <b>electrorefiner,</b> the anode and cathode collector are vertically collocated to maximize uranium throughput. This arrangement results in significantly less noble metals removal from the uranium during refining, typically no better than 20 %. In addition to <b>electrorefiner</b> design, operating parameters can also influence the retention of noble metals, albeit at the cost of uranium recovery. Experiments performed to date have shown that as much as 100 % of the noble metals can be retained by the cladding hulls while affecting the uranium recovery by only 6 %. However, it is likely that commercial pyroprocessing of spent fuel will require the uranium recovery to be much closer to 100 %. The above mentioned design and operational issues will likely be driven by the effects of noble metal contamination on fuel fabrication and performance. These effects will be presented in terms of thermal properties (expansion, conductivity, and fusion) and radioactivity considerations. Ultimately, the incorporation of minor amounts of noble metals from pyroprocessing into fast reactor metallic fuel will be shown to be of no consequence to reactor performance...|$|R

40|$|The {{traditional}} {{method of}} safeguarding nuclear facilities, {{nuclear material accountancy}} (NMA), faces many challenges when applied to pyroprocessing facilities. To aid in the safeguarding of these facilities, process monitoring (PM) is being investigated as a complementary method to NMA. PM takes general process data, such as density, current etc., and applies it to safeguards {{through the use of}} a statistical framework. Signature Based Safeguards (SBS), a proposed statistical framework for the application of PM techniques, identifies anomalous scenarios and subsequently identifies and detects their respective PM signatures from a system of sensors. This work focuses both on assisting SBS through identifying anomalous scenarios, and on the computer modeling of these failure modes and the PM signatures for them. The anomalous scenarios investigated were mechanical failure modes with potential safeguards-significance as they could lead to the deposition of plutonium and other actinides in the final uranium product ingot. The signatures of these anomalous scenarios were primarily radiation signatures from a coincidence counter that is used to analyze the final ingots. Several different failure modes were identified for both the <b>electrorefiner</b> and the cathode processor. The signatures for these failure modes were then determined by coupling two separate computer models. The first model is a FORTRAN-based <b>electrorefiner</b> code named ERAD capable of modeling the mass transport of metals within an <b>electrorefiner.</b> The second model was an MCNP-based simulation of the Canberra JCC- 31 High Level Neutron Coincidence Counter. First, the identified failure modes were simulated by changing ERAD inputs. ERAD calculated an elemental mass composition at the cathode which was then used as the final ingot composition. The final ingot composition was analyzed for single and double neutron coincidence count rates using the MCNP model. The results demonstrate significant radiation signatures for the presence of plutonium as a result of the <b>electrorefiner</b> failure modes. Signatures from cathode processor failure modes were weak and thus warrant future investigation of better detectors for integration into a SBS framework.
