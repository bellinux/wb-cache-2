Intramural duodenal hematoma (IDH) rarely occurs after endoscopic intervention. The diagnosis and treatment in both conditions are great challenge in daily practice. Case presentation: A 70 -year-old male patient, who had been taking warfarin for artificial valve replacement, developed IDH and <b>esophagogastroduodenal</b> pneumatosis after endoscopic hemostasis for duodenal ulcer bleeding. Initially, he had abdominal pain, gastrointestinal bleeding and hypotension. Later, he was found to have acute pancreatitis, biliary obstruction, gastric outlet obstruction and rapid decline of hemoglobin also ensued. The intramural duodenal hematoma and critical condition resolved spontaneously after conservative medical treatment. Conclusion: Based on this case report, we suggest that intramural duodenal hematoma should be considered if a patient has the tetrad of pancreatitis, biliary obstruction, gastric outlet obstruction and rapid decline of hemoglobin after an endoscopic intervention. Those patients could be treated conservatively. But, surgery should be considered if the diseases progress or complications persist...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} speculated that {{pediatric}} Crohn's disease (CD) is a distinct disease entity, with probably different disease subtypes. We therefore aimed to accurately phenotype newly diagnosed pediatric CD by using the pediatric modification of the Montreal classification, the Paris classification. Information was collected from the EUROKIDS registry, a prospective, web-based registry of new-onset pediatric IBD patients in 17 European countries and Israel. When a complete diagnostic workup was performed (ileocolonoscopy, upper gastrointestinal [GI] endoscopy, small bowel imaging), CD patients were evaluated for ileocolonic disease extent, <b>esophagogastroduodenal</b> involvement, and jejunal/proximal ileal involvement. Disease behavior and the occurrence of granulomas were also analyzed. In all, 582 pediatric CD patients could be classified according to the Paris classification. Isolated terminal ileal disease (± limited cecal disease) was seen at presentation in 16 %, isolated colonic disease in 27 %, ileocolonic disease in 53 %, and isolated upper GI disease in 4 % of patients. In total, 30 % had <b>esophagogastroduodenal</b> involvement and 24 % jejunal/proximal ileal disease. Patients with L 2 disease {{were less likely to}} have <b>esophagogastroduodenal</b> involvement or stricturing disease than patients with L 1 or L 3 disease. Terminal ileal disease and stricturing disease behavior were more common in children diagnosed after 10 years of age than in younger patients. Granulomas were identified in 43 % of patients. Accurate phenotyping is essential in pediatric CD, as this affects the management of individual patients. Disease phenotypes differ according to age at disease onset. The Paris classification is a useful tool to capture the variety of phenotypic characteristics of pediatric CD...|$|E

40|$|Background: Bamboo joint-like {{appearance}} {{is a common}} yet easy-to-miss endoscopic finding in the stomach of patients with Crohn’s disease (CD).

However, whether BJA is observed during the remission stage of CD and during the active stage is unclear. In particular, {{the relationship between the}} course of BJA and anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α has not been studied. We aimed to evaluate the course of BJA in CD patients treated with anti-TNF α therapy. Material/Methods: We examined 22 CD patients who underwent <b>esophagogastroduodenal</b> endoscopy before undergoing anti- TNF a treatment. We evaluated the changes in BJA, clinical activity using the CD activity index (CDAI), and endoscopic activity using the simple endoscopic score for CD (SES-CD) from 6 months to 1 year after anti-TNF α. Results: Fifteen of 22 patients (68. 1 %) presented with BJA in the stomach, 13 of whom received follow-up <b>esophagogastroduodenal</b> endoscopy after anti-TNF α. The mean CDAI and SES-CD scores significantly improved after anti-TNF α (P< 0. 01). Despite the marked improvements in clinical and endoscopic findings, the BJA of the stomach remained unchanged in all the patients. Conclusions: The findings indicate that BJA is frequently observed in the stomach of CD patients, regardless of whether the patient has active disease or is in remission, even after anti-TNF α. Thus, BJA may be a stable endoscopic landmark in CD...|$|E

40|$|AbstractAbdominal aortic {{aneurysm}}s (AAAs) {{can cause}} aortoenteric fistulae (AEF). AEF {{can either be}} primary, arising from the aneurysm or other diseases, causing the aorta to erode into the bowel, or secondary, from previous aortic grafting. Primary aortoduodenal fistula (ADF) is a rare clinical entity that usually presents with gastrointestinal bleeding that can be occult, intermittent, or massive. We report a 71 -year-old woman with acute onset of abdominal pain and massive hematemesis. <b>Esophagogastroduodenal</b> endoscopy (EGD) and arteriography were nondiagnostic. The patient's condition became unstable, and she was brought emergently {{to the operating room}} where the diagnosis of an ADF was made.

The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no complications associated with endoscopic therapies. After two sessions of endoscopic ablation her anemia improved to around 10 g/dL, an increase of 3. 6 g/dL. Various endoscopic treatments have been described to manage GAVE. The most popular is argon plasma coagulation (APC), although APC is associated with over-distension induced by the argon plasma gas. To avoid over-distension and to reduce the abdominal discomfort/pain of this patient, we have used hot biopsy forceps instead of APC.

Initially, a gasper with 5 -prolongs, commonly used for retrieval of endoscopically excised polyps, failed to remove the whole trichobezoar. When a net was used instead, it proved impossible to remove the trichobezoar completely. Therefore, we withdrew the scope from the mouth, leaving the net grasping the tricobezoar firmly in the stomach. Subsequently, we were able to retrieve about 70 % of the trichobezoar manually by grasping the snare part of the net directly. A second pass found no deep laceration or perforation endoscopically. The remaining trichobezoar was completely retrieved with the net. The procedure was completed within 15 min. The retrieved specimens were 34 cm in length and 100 g in weight.

Endo-scopic, histological and immuno-histochemical studies were carried out against all examined patients. The amount of epitheliocytes producing motilin (EC 2), glucagon (L), and pancreatic polypeptide (PP) in duodenum were determined using antibodies sets. Esophagitis, atrophic- and reflux-gastritis, duodenal reflux are positively rather frequently met, atrophy and dysplasia of gastric mucous membrane increase in patients without gallbladder during the time after cholecystectomy. Hypoplasia of epithelial cells producing motilin, glucagon and pancreatic polipetide progresses. The development of duodenal and gastroesophagial reflux is associated with hypoplasia of epithelicytes producing motilin; the development of erosive changes is connected with hypoplasia of L and PP cells; the development of atrophic changes is closely related with hypoplasia of all studied cell types.

40|$|<b>Esophagogastroduodenal</b> {{endoscopy}} (EGDE) is {{the most}} commonly performed endoscopic procedure in Canada and represents 51 [...] 65 % of all gastrointestinal procedures performed in teaching hospitals. The routine use of conscious sedation during EGDE has facilitated its diffusion, ensured patient and physician satisfaction and has increased the potential risk of cardiorespiratory morbidity. It remains unclear if all adult ambulatory patients require routine conscious sedation prior to diagnostic EGDE, as the efficacy and safety of such a policy has not been rigorously studied in a North American population. Patients {{were randomly assigned to}} sedation or placebo in a double-blind trial. So far 360 patients of the anticipated patients have been enrolled, (182 randomized to sedation, 178 randomized to placebo). Groups were similar for all baseline characteristics. Eighty-one percent of patients randomized to placebo were able to complete EGDE without sedation. The major determinant of "successful endoscopy" was the use of sedation (OR = 7. 52; 95 % CI: 4. 61 [...] 12. 26). Preliminary subgroup analysis suggested that among patients greater than 55 yrs and with decreased pharyngeal sensitivity, there was a greater likelihood of successful unsedated endoscopy, when compared to other subsets (45 % successful vs. 39 % successful among the unstratified placebo population; 98 % power).

Case 1 An 89 -year-old Caucasian man presented with declining health, weakness, nausea, vomiting, and decreased appetite. Comorbidities included hypertension, history of colon polyps, total colectomy following gastrointestinal bleed post-colonoscopy, congestive heart failure, aortic valve replacement, coronary artery disease, and congestive obstructive pulmonary disease. The patient had a 15 -year history of elevated and rising prostatic specific antigen (PSA). His PSA a year before presentation was 1565 units. Family history was significant for a brother with prostate carcinoma. The conservative course of annual follow-up had been decided due to the patient’s advanced age, two negative prostate biopsies, and lack of symptoms.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{our study}} was to detect bile acids and total {{bilirubin}} in saliva of gastrectomized patients, to confirm objectively presence of biliary laryngopharyngeal reflux and its relationship with laryngeal mucosa damage. Summary Background Data: Recently, it has been hypothesized that biliary-reflux may reach the upper aerodigestive tract and enhance development of laryngeal malignancies; nevertheless, the presence of duodenogastric contents in this region has never been revealed. Methods: We carried out a prospective observational case-control study on 52 patients (cases) previously submitted to gastric surgery, mainly to subtotal Billroth II resection, and on 51 healthy volunteers (controls). Patients were submitted to clinical interview, <b>esophagogastroduodenal</b> endoscopy, endoscopic laryngeal evaluation, and saliva collection. In all saliva samples, bile acids, total bilirubin, and pepsinogen II were assayed. Results: In cases, group bile acids levels were recorded in 17 of 52 (32. 6 %) patients, while in 35 of 52 (67. 4 %) they were undetectable. All controls were negative to bile acids. In positive cases to bile acids, we found a significant (P < 0. 05) correlation between bile acids, total bilirubin, and pepsinogen II values and a significant (P < 0. 05) higher prevalence of symptoms and findings of laryngeal damage and of previous laryngeal neoplastic lesions. Conclusions: We found detectable levels of bile acids and total bilirubin in saliva of patients submitted to previous gastric surgery, prospecting an intriguing diagnostic role of this dosage {{in the study of}} biliary laryngopharyngeal reflux.

40|$|Abstract Background In rats, <b>esophagogastroduodenal</b> {{anastomosis}} (EGDA) without concomitant chemical carcinogen treatment {{leads to}} gastroesophageal reflux disease, multilayered epithelium (MLE, a presumed precursor in intestinal metaplasia), columnar-lined esophagus, dysplasia, and esophageal adenocarcinoma. Previously {{we have shown}} that columnar-lined esophagus in EGDA rats resembled human Barrett's esophagus (BE) in its morphology, mucin features and expression of differentiation markers (Lab. Invest. 2004; 84 : 753 – 765). The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare the phenotype of rat MLE with human MLE, in order to gain insight into the nature of MLE and its potential role in the development of BE. Methods Serial sectioning was performed on tissue samples from 32 EGDA rats and 13 patients with established BE. Tissue sections were immunohistochemically stained for a variety of transcription factors and differentiation markers of esophageal squamous epithelium and intestinal columnar epithelium. Results We detected MLE in 56. 3 % (18 / 32) of EGDA rats, and in all human samples. As expected, both rat and human squamous epithelium, but not intestinal metaplasia, expressed squamous transcription factors and differentiation markers (p 63, Sox 2, CK 14 and CK 4) in all cases. Both rat and human intestinal metaplasia, but not squamous epithelium, expressed intestinal transcription factors and differentiation markers (Cdx 2, GATA 4, HNF 1 α, villin and Muc 2) in all cases. Rat MLE shared expression patterns of Sox 2, CK 4, Cdx 2, GATA 4, villin and Muc 2 with human MLE. However, p 63 and CK 14 were expressed in a higher proportion of rat MLE compared to humans. Conclusion These data indicate that rat MLE shares similar properties to human MLE in its expression pattern of these markers, not withstanding small differences, and support the concept that MLE may be a transitional stage in the metaplastic conversion of squamous to columnar epithelium in BE. </p...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The NIDDK IBD Genetics Consortium (IBDGC) {{collects}} DNA and phenotypic {{data from}} {{inflammatory bowel disease}} (IBD) subjects to provide a resource for genetic studies. No previous studies have been performed on {{the reliability and validity}} of phenotypic determinations in either Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC) using primary records. Our aim was to determine {{the reliability and validity of}} these phenotypic assessments. METHODS: The de-identified records of 30 IBD patients were reviewed by 2 phenotypers per center using a standard protocol for phenotypic assessment. Each phenotyper evaluated 10 charts on 2 occasions 5 months apart. Reliability was expressed as the kappa (kappa) statistic. Performance characteristics were determined by comparison to a consensus-derived "gold standard" and by generation of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. RESULTS: Agreement for diagnosis was excellent (kappa = 0. 82; 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 0. 71 - 0. 92). Agreement for CD location was good for jejunal, ileal, colorectal, and perianal disease with kappa between 0. 60 and 0. 74 but was fair for <b>esophagogastroduodenal</b> (kappa = 0. 36). Agreement for UC extent (kappa = 0. 67; 95 % CI: 0. 48 - 0. 85), and CD behavior (kappa = 0. 67; 95 % CI: 0. 49 - 0. 83) were very good. Area under the ROC curves was greater than 0. 84 for diagnosis, CD behavior, UC extent, and ileal and colonic CD location. CONCLUSIONS: IBD phenotype classification using a standard protocol exhibited very good to excellent inter- and intrarater agreement and validity.

40|$|Objectives:  The {{utility of}} {{nasogastric}} aspiration and lavage {{in the emergency}} management of patients with melena or hematochezia without hematemesis is controversial. This evidence-based emergency medicine review evaluates the following question: does nasogastric aspiration and lavage in patients with melena or hematochezia and no hematemesis differentiate an upper from lower source of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding? Methods:  MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and other databases were searched. Studies were selected {{for inclusion in the}} review if the authors had performed nasogastric aspiration (with or without lavage) in all patients with hematochezia or melena and performed <b>esophagogastroduodenal</b> endoscopy (EGD) in all patients. Studies were excluded if they enrolled patients with history of esophageal varices or included patients with hematemesis or coffee ground emesis (unless the data for patients without hematemesis or coffee ground emesis could be separated out). The outcome was identifying upper GI hemorrhage (active bleeding or high-risk lesions potentially responsible for hemorrhage) and the rate of complications associated with the nasogastric tube insertion. Quality of the included studies was assessed using standard criteria for diagnostic accuracy studies. Results:  Three retrospective studies met our inclusion and exclusion criteria. The prevalence of an upper GI source for patients with melena or hematochezia without hematemesis was 32 % to 74 %. According to the included studies, the diagnostic performance of the nasogastric aspiration and lavage for predicting upper GI bleeding is poor. The sensitivity of this test ranged from 42 % to 84 %, the specificity from 54 % to 91 %, and negative likelihood ratios from 0. 62 to 0. 20. Only one study reported the rate complications associated with nasogastric aspiration and lavage (1. 6 %). Conclusions:  Nasogastric aspiration, with or without lavage, has a low sensitivity and poor negative likelihood ratio, which limits its utility in ruling out an upper GI source of bleeding in patients with melena or hematochezia without hematemesis...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the relationship between duodenal ulcer (DU), Helicobacter pylori (Hp) infection and genetic and enviromental factors, and its influence on treatment and long-term RESULTS. Method: In the course of an epidemiological study on the prevalence of <b>esophagogastroduodenal</b> diseases, 1, 169 volunteers underwent an endoscopy of the upper part of the gastrointestinal tract. The relationship of incidence rate and size of duodenal ulcers and several risks factors was investigated. RESULTS: A DU was observed in 240 subjects (20. 5 %), mostly of male gender (64. 4 % - p< 0. 0001). The Histological presence of a gastric Hp infection was confirmed in 179 cases (74. 6 %); it did not influenced the mean size of the ulcers and the presence of gastric intestinal metaplasia, compared to subjects without Hp infection. However, a superficial chronic gastritis was observed in 95. 9 % of Hp+ subjects and in 83. 3 % of Hp- (p< 0. 003), whereas a familiar history of DU was noted in 33. 3 % of Hp+ subjects and in 50. 8 % of Hp- (p< 0. 02). The main risk factor for DU was represented by Hp infection in 119 cases (49. 6 %), by infective and genetic factors in 60 cases (25 %) and only by the genetic factor in 31 cases (12. 9 %), and was not detected in 30 cases (12. 5 %). Ulcer recurrence rates, after medical therapy, were 0, 5 % and 6. 5 % (p< 0. 03) at a 2 -month follow-up, and 2. 2 % and 49. 1 % (p< 0. 00001) at a 12 -month follow-up, among Hp+ and Hp- patients, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The most common risk factor for DU was a gastric Hp infection, alone or associated to the genetic factor. Since the high incidence of recurrences at a 12 -month follow-up, patients affected with a DU but Hp- represented an important therapeutic concern...|$|E
