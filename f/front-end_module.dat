Special requirements for new installations of stationary systems (AURA) and underfloor testing stations (UFPE) called {{for the development of}} state-of-the-art miniaturized front-end ultrasonic and eddy-current test instrumentation. This innovation offers new dimensions for the concept and design of such systems, including features providing effortless maintenance of the inspection systems. Due to the small size of the electronic modules they can be placed in close proximity to the transducer assembly. High-speed networking techniques ensure the transfer of all the acquired digital ultrasonic and eddy-current data from the frontend modules to the workstation responsible for data acquisition and analysis. The new front-end technology is applied for the testing stations of the latest generation.

40|$|Abstract: The ngFEC (next {{generation}} Front-End Controller) is {{the system}} responsible for slow and fast control within the Phase-I Upgrade of the CMS Hadron Calorimeters.

The latency of the fast control signals is fixed across power cycles. Even if the direct link to a <b>front-end</b> <b>module</b> is broken, a redundancy scheme ensures a successful communication using the link to the neighboring <b>front-end</b> <b>module.</b> Thanks to the ngFEC all front-end modules can be remotely programmed using the JTAG standard protocol.
