5|$|From the 1st century AD onwards, Cassel {{developed}} into a key urban centre for the whole region with an extensive road network converging on the hill. Towards {{the end of the}} 3rd century, however, repeated invasions of Germanic tribes caused devastation throughout the region and at least 80% of settlements <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>area</b> <b>are</b> thought to have been abandoned, accompanied by a general economic decline. Cassel was fortified with a circuit of walls at around this time but suffered its own decline, which was reflected in its loss of status as a regional capital; Tournai took over as the capital of the newly constituted Civitas Turnacensium.|$|E
5|$|Fur-bearing trout are fictional {{creatures that}} are purportedly found in Arkansas, {{northern}} North America, and Iceland. The basic claim (or tall tale) {{is that the}} waters of lakes and rivers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>area</b> <b>are</b> so cold that they evolved a thick coat of fur to maintain their body heat. Another theory {{says that it is}} due to four jugs - or two bottles - of hair tonic being spilled into the Arkansas River.|$|E

5|$|Houston is {{considered}} to be a politically divided city whose balance of power often sways between Republicans and Democrats. Much of the city's wealthier areas vote Republican while the city's working class and minority areas vote Democratic. According to the 2005 Houston Area Survey, 68percent of non-Hispanic whites in Harris County are declared or favor Republicans while 89 percent of non-Hispanic blacks <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>area</b> <b>are</b> declared or favor Democrats. About 62percent of Hispanics (of any race) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>area</b> <b>are</b> declared or favor Democrats. The city has often been known to be the most politically diverse city in Texas, a state known for being generally conservative. As a result, the city is often a contested area in statewide elections. In 2009, Houston became the first US city with a population over 1 million citizens to elect a gay mayor, by electing Annise Parker.|$|E
5|$|Mahoning Creek lacks a {{riparian}} buffer in some places. However, the Mahoning Creek floodplain and {{the nearby}} slopes are listed as a Locally Significant site on the Montour County Natural Areas Inventory. Eastern hemlock trees inhabit the slopes and river birch, silver maple, and silky dogwood inhabit the floodplain itself. American basswood also grows {{in the vicinity of}} the creek here. Additionally, spring wildflowers grow in this area. The site has a high level of plant biodiversity. However, many trees <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>area</b> <b>are</b> affected by an aphid species known as the hemlock wooly adelgid.|$|E
5|$|Other notable museums <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>area</b> <b>are</b> the Kwahadi Kiva Indian Museum and the English Field Air & Space Museum. The Kwahadi Kiva Indian Museum {{features}} {{a collection of}} Native American artifacts and provides dance performances. Sadly, the English Field Air & Space Museum, which had been operated by the Texas Aviation Historical Society featuring aircraft and space exhibits, in 2007 closed its doors and lost many of its aircraft. The museum is now rebuilding its aircraft collection as Texas Air & Space Museum and is located on American Drive {{on the south side}} of the airport.|$|E

5|$|The Lesser Sunda Islands {{is a small}} {{archipelago}} which, {{from west}} to east, consists of Bali, Lombok, Sumbawa, Flores, Sumba and the Timor islands; all are located {{at the edge of}} the Australian continental shelf. Volcanoes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>area</b> <b>are</b> formed because of oceanic crusts and the movement of the shelf itself. Some volcanoes completely form an island, for instance, the Sangeang Api island. Mount Tambora, on Sumbawa island, erupted on 5 April 1815, with a scale 7 on the VEI and is considered the most violent eruption in recorded history.|$|E
5|$|The {{adults in}} the {{community}} are considered semi-speakers as they have a passive understanding of Wagiman and generally only know a few basic words. Their children, the grandchildren of the elders, understand very little Wagiman and speak none. Apart from Mayali, Kriol, a creole language based on the vocabulary of English, is the lingua franca of the area.

For many years the clay has been used for making bricks and tiles.|$|E
5|$|Wildflowers bloom {{from early}} May to late September {{but most are}} gone by late August. Moisture from snow-melt along with some {{rainfall}} in late spring kick-starts the germination of annual plants, including wildflowers. Most of these plants complete their entire life cycle in the few months each year that moisture levels are good. The onset of summer decreases the number of wildflowers and by autumn only the tiny yellow flowers of sagebrush and rabbitbrush remain. Some wildflowers that grow <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>area</b> <b>are</b> the arrow-leaved balsamroot, bitterroot, blazingstar, desert parsley, dwarf monkeyflower, paintbrush, scorpionweed, scabland penstemon and the wild onion.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} localities <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>area</b> <b>are</b> {{named after the}} Ashbridges.

The bay that marked the southern edge of the property is now known as Ashbridge's Bay, named for John Ashbridge. On the east and north sides of the bay is the large Ashbridge's Bay Park. Ashbridge's Bay Park North, {{to the north of the}} bay, is the site of the Ashbridge's Bay Skate Park, opened in 2009.

5|$|Although little {{evidence}} of settlements {{has been found in}} the Rhondda that date between the Neolithic and Bronze Age periods, several cairns and cists have been discovered throughout the length of both valleys. The best example of a round-cairn was found at Crug yr Afan, near the summit of Graig Fawr, west of Cwmparc. The cairn consisted of an earthen mound with a surrounding ditch 28 metres in circumference and over 2 metres tall. Although most cairns discovered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>area</b> <b>are</b> round, a ring cairn or cairn circle exists on Gelli Mountain. Known as the 'Rhondda Stonehenge' the cairn consists of 10 upright stones no more than 60cm in height encircling a central cist. All the cairns found within the Rhondda are located on high ground, many on ridgeways, and may have been used as waypoints.|$|E
5|$|Anions in {{the waters}} of the Black Creek {{drainage}} basin include sulfate and bicarbonate. The concentrations of aluminum in the mine pools <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>area</b> <b>are</b> typically very low or nonexistent. However, some mine waters {{in the waters}}hed can have aluminum ion concentrations of over 70 milligrams per liter, forming 6 percent of total dissolved solids in the water, as measured by weight. The concentration of manganese ions in the waters can be over 100 milligrams per liter and calcium also occurs in groundwater in the watershed. Magnesium occurs in the non-polluted groundwater in the watershed in concentrations of 1 to 5 milligrams per liter and occurs in polluted groundwater at concentrations of 4 to 440 milligrams per liter.|$|E
5|$|During the 1960s, the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) {{conducted}} {{nuclear tests}} on Amchitka. Despite being {{designated as a}} national wildlife refuge by President William Taft in 1913, Amchitka was chosen as a nuclear testing site by the AEC. There were several reasons for this decision. Firstly, Amchitka {{was close to the}} former Soviet Union, making it an ideal location for a nuclear test to intimidate the latter. However, the public reason given by the AEC was the island's remoteness. Forceful objections were raised against the testing by a number of organisations and groups, most notably the Aleut people, who, although they vacated the island in the 19th century after Russian fur traders reduced sea otter numbers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>area,</b> <b>are</b> resident on nearby islands, and were concerned about radiation leaks as well as potential physical damage resulting from the nuclear tests.|$|E
