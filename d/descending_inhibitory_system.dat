40|$|Xenon (Xe) {{suppresses}} wide {{dynamic range}} neurons in cat spinal cord to a similar extent as nitrous oxide (N 2 O). The antinociceptive action of N 2 O involves the <b>descending</b> <b>inhibitory</b> <b>system.</b> To clarify whether the <b>descending</b> <b>inhibitory</b> <b>system</b> is also involved in the antinociceptive action of Xe, we compared the effects of Xe on the spinal cord dorsal horn neurons with those of N 2 O in spinal cord-transected cats anesthetized with �-chloralose and urethane.

40|$|The {{pharmacological}} {{effects of}} the opioid analgesics are derived from their complex interactions with three opioid receptor types (�, �, and �; morphine is an agonist at the � opioid receptor). These receptors {{are found in the}} periphery, at presynaptic and postsynaptic sites in the spinal cord dorsal horn, and in the brain stem, thalamus, and cortex, in what constitutes the ascending pain transmission system, as well as structures that comprise a <b>descending</b> <b>inhibitory</b> <b>system</b> that modulates pain {{at the level of the}} spinal cord. The cellular effects of opioids include a decrease in presynaptic transmitter release, hyperpolarization of postsynaptic elements, and disinhibition. The endogenous opioid peptides are part of an endogenous pain modulatory system. A number of opioids are available for clinical use, including morphine, hydromorphone, levorphanol, oxymorphone, methadone, meperidine, oxycodone, and fentanyl, and their advantages and disadvantages for the management of pain are discussed.

40|$|Arguably, the {{two most}} {{important}} aspects regarding laser phototherapy for pain management are those of effect mechanism (to determine the most appropriate application) and of dosing parameters. Herein is summarised the outcomes of more than 15 years of the author's research to date, to clarify some of these factors. Initial investigations demonstrated that the central descending inhibitory (endogenous opioid) system was involved in the effect mechanism of phototherapy and that doses below 5 J/cm 2 in the wavelengths tested, had the best effects in a chronic pain clinical model. Subsequent research using a non-invasive clinical model in lateral epicondylalgia has established that the <b>descending</b> <b>inhibitory</b> <b>system</b> is not the sole likely origin of the treatment response; or, if it is, it plays this role selectively for only some combinations of wavelength, dose and power output. Repeated low doses of laser (at some wavelengths) are sufficient to stimulate physiological responses and reduce pain in subjects with lateral epicondylalgia. It is clear further information is required for dosing and dose threshold factors of laser phototherapy for clinical pain management. Griffith Health, School of Allied Health SciencesFull Tex...|$|E
40|$|Deafferentation {{hyperactivity}} (DH) was provoked in the neurons of the subnucleus caudalis of {{the spinal}} trigeminal nucleus and the lateral reticular formation in cats by Gasserian ganglionectomy, {{and was used}} as a model of peripheral deafferentation pain. The influence of neurochemical substances upon DH was investigated. Neurotransmitters and their antagonists were applied topically around the soma of hyperactive neruons by the microiontophoretic technique, using a 7 -barreled glass micropipette. Then the participation of inhibitory amino acids in the <b>descending</b> <b>inhibitory</b> <b>systems,</b> which were activated by deep brain stimulation (DBS), was investigated. Discharges of hyperactive neurons (n= 75) were recorded extracellularly and analyzed using a spike density histogram. DH was suppressed by topically injected GABA and glycine, but not by met-enkephalin. The suppressive effects of GABA and glycine were almost completely antagonized by bicuculline and strychnine, respectively. Stimulation of the internal capsule or VPM suppressed DH, and this suppression was not affected by microiontophoretically injected bicuculline or strychnine. Intravenous injection of picrotoxin reduced the suppression, but intravenous strychnine did not.

40|$|Pain {{has been}} a major concern of {{humankind}} since the ancient times, and it {{remains one of the most}} important subjects of all health care professionals. Despite the obvious overwhelming clinical importance, the major advances in its diagnosis and therapy have been made only recently. "How do the sensory apparatus of the body and system of signal transmission relate to pain of peripheral origin?" is the topic of discussion. To do this, it is important to understand what constitutes the total pain experience. It consists of: 1) signal transduction at the peripheral receptor site, 2) signal conduction along the peripheral nerve, 3) pain modulation at the level of the spinal cord, 4) pain perception at the supraspinal site, and 5) the associated sensations, emotional reactions, and effective state. The signal transmission related to pain may be modified by various analgesic agents. Specific analgesic agent has a specific site of action which may be at peripheral receptors, at peripheral nerves, at the level of the spinal cord, at supraspinal levels by activating <b>descending</b> <b>inhibitory</b> <b>systems,</b> or at more cephalad levels by reducing the affective component of pain...|$|R
40|$|The {{possible}} role {{of substance}} P (SP) and enkephalin (ENK) {{was investigated in}} the mechanism of deafferented pain (DP) and excess pain. The concentration of SP anf ENK was quantitatively estimated with radioimmunoassay using 17 adults cats. The animal were divided into 3 group, DP group (8 cats), EP group (6 cats) and untreated conrol group (3 cats). The DP group was prepared according to the method described by Shimizu and EP model was made by injection 1 ml of Freund's adjuvant subcutaneously into the unilateral face of the cats every day for 3 weeks. The amount of SP in STN markedly decreased in DP group and significantly higher in EP group than with the control group. This is {{explained by the fact}} that SP is a neurotransmitter for pain of trigeminal nerve. No significant decrease in ENK in the DP group was observed. This suggests that ENK in STN is not always controlled by the <b>descending</b> <b>inhibitory</b> <b>system,</b> but may be working in the propriospinal system. ENK in the EP group also showed no significant increase. This can be explained not only by the difficulty in estimating the rapid degeneration of ENK, but also by the strong participation of monoamines as well as ENK in pain relief. The role of ENK should not be overstimated and the studies including monoamines will be necessary to detemine the mechanism of pain...|$|E
40|$|Orexin, {{which is}} mainly {{produced}} by orexin-expressing neurons in the lateral hypothalamus (LH), playsan {{important role in}} pain modulation. Both kinds of orexin- 1 (Ox 1) and orexin- 2 (Ox 2) receptors havebeen found at high density in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and nucleus accumbens (NAc). However,the quantity of Ox 1 receptors in the VTA is more than that in the NAc. Additionally, it seems that thefunctional interaction between the LH, VTA and NAc implicates pain processing and modulation. In thisstudy, we tried to examine the involvement of Ox 2 receptors in the NAc and VTA using tail-flick test asan animal model of acute pain following microinjection of effective dose of carbachol (125 nmol/ 0. 5 �lsaline) into the LH. In this set of experiments, different doses of TCS OX 2 29 as an Ox 2 receptor antagonistwere microinjected into the VTA (1, 7 and 20 nmol/ 0. 3 �l DMSO) and the NAc (2, 10, 20 and 40 nmol/ 0. 5 �lDMSO) 5 min prior to carbachol administration. Administration of TCS OX 2 29 into the VTA and NAc dose-dependently blocked intra-LH carbachol-induced antinociception. However, the inhibitory effect of TCSOX 2 29 as an Ox 2 receptor antagonist was more potent in the VTA than that in the NAc.

The present study investigated the <b>descending</b> <b>inhibitory</b> <b>system</b> involvement in EA action. Inflammatory pain was induced by injecting complete Freund's adjuvant subcutaneously into one hind paw of rats with dorsolateral funiculus lesions and sham-operated rats. EA treatment, 10  Hz at 3  mA, was given twice for 20  min each, once immediately post- and again 2  h post-Freund's adjuvant at GB 30, at the junction of the lateral 1 / 3 and medial 2 / 3 of {{the distance between the}} greater trochanter and sacral hiatus. For sham EA control, acupuncture needles were inserted bilaterally into GB 30 without electrical or manual stimulation. Paw withdrawal latency to a noxious thermal stimulus was measured at baseline and 20  min after EA treatment. Compared to sham EA, EA significantly (P < 0. 05, n = 9) increased withdrawal latency of the inflamed hind paws in the sham-operated rats but not in those with dorsolateral funiculus lesions, indicating that lesioning blocked EA-produced anti-hyperalgesia. EA, compared to sham EA, also significantly inhibited Fos expression in laminae I-II of the spinal cord in the sham-operated rats (58. 4 ± 6. 5 vs. 35. 2 ± 5. 4 per section) but not in those with dorsolateral funiculus lesions. Further, EA activated serotonin- and catecholamine-containing neurons in the nucleus raphe magnus and locus coeruleus that project to the spinal cord. The results demonstrate that EA inhibits transmission of noxious messages and hyperalgesia by activating supraspinal neurons that project to the spinal cord. © 2007 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|The central {{sensitization}} syndrome (CSS) encompasses disorders with overlapping {{symptoms in}} a structural pathology spectrum ranging from persistent nociception [e. g., osteoarthritis (OA) ] to {{an absence of}} tissue injuries {{such as the one}} presented in fibromyalgia (FM) and myofascial pain syndrome (MPS). First, we hypothesized that these syndromes present differences in their cortical excitability parameters assessed by TMS, namely motor evoked potential (MEP), cortical silent period (CSP), short intracortical inhibition (SICI) and short intracortical facilitation (SICF). Second, considering that the presence of tissue injury could be detected by serum neurotrophins, we hypothesized that the spectrum of structural pathology (i. e., from persistent nociception like in OA, to the absence of tissue injury like in FM and MPS), could be detected by differential efficiency of their <b>descending</b> pain <b>inhibitory</b> <b>system,</b> as assessed by the conditioned pain modulation (CPM) paradigm. Third, we explored whether BDNF had an influence on the relationship between motor cortex excitability and structural pathology. This cross-sectional study pooled baseline data from three randomized clinical trials. We included females (n= 114), aged 19 to 65 years old with disability by chronic pain syndromes: FM (n= 19), MPS (n= 54), OA (n= 27) and healthy subjects (n= 14). We assessed the serum BDNF, the motor cortex excitability by parameters the TMS measures and the change on Numerical Pain Scale [NPS (0 - 10) ] during CPM-task. The adjusted mean (SD) on the SICI observed in the absence of tissue injury was 56. 36 % lower than with persistent nociceptive input [0. 31 (0. 18) vs. 0. 55 (0. 32) ], respectively. The BDNF was inversely correlated with the SICI and with the change on NPS (0 - 10) during CPM-task. These findings suggest greater disinhibition in the motor cortex and the <b>descending</b> pain <b>inhibitory</b> <b>system</b> in FM and MPS than in OA and healthy subjects. Likewise, the inter-hemispheric disinhibition as well the dysfunction in the descending pain modulatory system is higher in chronic pain without tissue injury compared to a structural lesion. In addition, they highlight that a greater level of serum BDNF mediated the disinhibition of motor cortex excitability, as well the function of <b>descending</b> <b>inhibitory</b> pain modulation <b>system,</b> independently of the physiopathology mechanism of musculoskeletal pain syndromes...|$|R

To examine the underlying mechanisms of the acupuncture-induced analgesia, the effects of electroacupuncture (EA) on weight-bearing forces (WBR) of the affected foot and dorsal horn neuron activities were examined in a rat model of ankle sprain. Ankle sprain was induced manually by overextending ligaments of the left ankle in the rat. Dorsal horn neuron responses to ankle movements or compression were recorded from the lumbar spinal cord using an in vivo extracellular single unit recording setup 1 day after ankle sprain. EA was applied to the SI- 6 acupoint on the right forelimb (contralateral to the sprained ankle) by trains of electrical pulses (10 Hz, 1 -ms pulse width, 2 -mA intensity) for 30 min. After EA, WBR of the sprained foot significantly recovered and dorsal horn neuron activities were significantly suppressed in ankle-sprained rats. However, EA produced no effect in normal rats. The inhibitory effect of EA on hyperactivities of dorsal horn neurons of ankle-sprained rats was blocked by the α-adrenoceptor antagonist phentolamine (5 mg/kg ip) but not by the opioid receptor antagonist naltrexone (10 mg/kg ip). These data suggest that EA-induced analgesia in ankle sprain pain is mediated mainly by suppressing dorsal horn neuron activities through α-adrenergic <b>descending</b> <b>inhibitory</b> <b>systems</b> at the spinal level...|$|R
40|$|Descending {{controls}} of spinal nociceptive processing {{play a critical}} role in the development of inflammatory hyperalgesia. Acute peripheral nociceptor sensitization drives spinal sensitization and activates spino–supraspinal–spinal loops leading to <b>descending</b> <b>inhibitory</b> and facilitatory {{controls of}} spinal neuronal activity that further modify the extent and degree of the pain state. The afferent inputs from hairy and glabrous skin are distinct with respect to both the profile of primary afferent classes and the degree of their peripheral sensitization. It is not known whether these differences in afferent input differentially engage descending control systems to different extents or in different ways. Injection of complete Freund's adjuvant resulted in inflammation and swelling of hairy hind foot skin in rats, a transient thermal hyperalgesia lasting 72 h). In hairy skin, transient hyperalgesia was associated with sensitization of withdrawal reflexes to thermal activation of either A- or C-nociceptors. The transience of the hyperalgesia was attributable to a rapidly engaged <b>descending</b> <b>inhibitory</b> noradrenergic mechanism, which affected withdrawal responses to both A- and C-nociceptor activation and this could be reversed by intrathecal administration of yohimbine (α- 2 -adrenoceptor antagonist). In glabrous skin, yohimbine had no effect on an equivalent thermal inflammatory hyperalgesia. We conclude that acute inflammation and peripheral nociceptor sensitization in hind foot hairy skin, but not glabrous skin, rapidly activates a <b>descending</b> <b>inhibitory</b> noradrenergic <b>system.</b> This may result from differences in the engagement of descending control systems following sensitization of different primary afferent classes that innervate glabrous and hairy skin...|$|R
40|$|The A 7 {{catecholamine}} cell group {{consists of}} noradrenergic (NAergic) neurons that project to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Here, we characterized their morphology and physiology properties and tested {{the effect of}} substance P (Sub-P) on them, since the results of many morphological studies suggest that A 7 neurons are densely innervated by Sub-P-releasing terminals from nuclei involved in the <b>descending</b> <b>inhibitory</b> <b>system,</b> such as the lateral hypothalamus and periaqueductal gray area. Whole cell recordings were made from neurons located approximately 200 microm rostral to the trigeminal motor nucleus (the presumed A 7 area) in sagittal brainstem slices from rats aged 7 - 10 days. After recording, the neurons were injected with biocytin and immunostained with antibody against dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH). DBH-immunoreactive (ir) cells were presumed to be NAergic neurons. They had a large somata diameter (approximately 20 microm) and relatively simple dendritic branching patterns. They fired action potentials (AP) spontaneously with or without blockade of synaptic inputs, and had similar properties to those of NAergic neurons in other areas, including the existence of calcium channel-mediated APs and a voltage-dependent delay in initiation of the AP (an indicator {{of the existence of}} A-type potassium currents) and an ability to be hyperpolarized by norepinephrine. Furthermore, in all DBH-ir neurons tested, Sub-P caused depolarization of the membrane potential and an increase in neuronal firing rate by acting on neurokinin- 1 receptors. Non-DBH-ir neurons with a smaller somata size were also found in the A 7 area. These showed great diversity in firing patterns and about half were depolarized by Sub-P. Morphological examination suggested that the non-DBH-ir neurons form contacts with DBH-ir neurons. These results provide the first description of the intrinsic regulation of membrane properties of, and the excitatory effect of Sub-P on, A 7 area neurons, which {{play an important role in}} pain regulation. status: publishe...|$|E

Although several studies suggest that N_ 2 O may produce analgesia by interacting with opioid receptors, definite mechamisms are not fully understood yet. The present study was undertaken to examine an involvement of noradrenergic neuronal activity for N_ 2 O-induced analgesia {{in relation to the}} alpha- 2 receptor function at the spinal and supraspinal levels in rats. Male Wistar rats were used. Analgesia was evaluated by using tail-flick method and expressed as %MPE values. Noradrenaline (NA) content was determined by HPLOECD and alpha- 2 receptor binding (3 ^H-clonidine binding) was evaluated using in vitro autoradiography. N_ 20 (75 %) produced analgesia, the %MPE value being increased to a maximum value of 78 % at 30 min, thereafter declined gradually to 38 % at 120 min after exposure. Alpha- 2 agonist clonidine(CLO: 150 /μg/kg,ip, given 30 min before N_ 2 O exposure) potentiated analgesic effect of N_ 2 O at 120 min (%MPE: 80 %), while alpha- 2 receptor antagonist idazoxane (100 μg/kg,ip) or locus coeruleus (LC) lesions (produced 7 days prior to N_ 2 O exposure) attenuated analgesic effect of N_ 2 O. Naloxone(5 mg/kg,iv) in a dose that blocks analgesic effect of morphine (5 mg/kg) did not affect N_ 2 O-induced analgesia. 3 ^H-CLO hinding site in laminae 1 -ll in the dorsal horm of the spinal cord was increased by 16 % with N_ 2 O. In the LC, NA content was decreased by 52 % and 3 ^H-CLO binding site was increased by 13 %. With morphine, 3 ^H-CLO binding sites were increased by 13 % and 20 % in the LC and periaqueductal gray, respectively.

40|$|The supraspinal {{control of}} {{descending}} inhibition of genital reflexes (such as ejaculation) is poorly understood but {{is important in}} our global comprehension of how neural signals are integrated to produce sexual behavior, and {{in our understanding of}} sexual dysfunction. Sexual dysfunctions, such as premature ejaculation/delayed ejaculation in men, and involuntary vaginal spasms, dyspareunia, and anorgasmia in women, are common. An underlying dysregulation of genital reflexes may produce these dysfunctions, especially in those individuals being treated for depression and anxiety with serotonergic drugs. The nucleus paragigantocellularis (nPGi) of the rat medulla {{has been described as a}} <b>descending</b> <b>inhibitory</b> <b>system</b> for genital reflexes in rats, and a homologue is known in humans. Through retrograde tracing of nPGi afferents with the tracer Fluorogold in rats, we found that a number of brain regions implicated in sexual behavior, such as the medial preoptic area, paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, and periaqueductal gray (PAG) provide sexually dimorphic projections to the nPGi, and that many of these regions contain receptors for gonadal steroids and are active during sexual behavior. We also found that excitotoxic lesions of the nPGi with N-methyl-D-aspartate facilitate male sexual behavior by reducing the number of intromissions required for ejaculation, and decreasing ejaculation latency. In females, such lesions attenuated sexual behavior by reducing the amount of time the female spent mating and reducing the reinforcement value of vaginocervical stimulation. Lastly, we found that by removing the source of serotonin to the nPGi (from the ventrolateral PAG) with the serotonergic neurotoxin 5, 7 -DHT in male rats, we were able to mimic the effects of nPGi lesions and facilitated male sexual behavior indicating that serotonin neurotransmission at the level of the nPGi is critical for genital reflex control. Taken together our results indicate that the nPGi is an important site of integration of internal signals for the regulation of sexual behavior that is sexually dimorphic and under serotonergic control. Our understanding of normal and dysfunction genital reflex control, and possible treatment options in people, is complemented by these results...|$|E
40|$|Tricyclic {{antidepressants}} and serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors {{are used}} to treat chronic pain, such as neuropathic pain. Why antidepressants are effective for treatment of neuropathic pain and the precise mechanisms underlying their effects, however, remain unclear. The inhibitory effects of these antidepressants for neuropathic pain manifest more quickly than their antidepressive effects, suggesting different modes of action. Recent studies of animal models of neuropathic pain revealed that noradrenaline is extremely important for the inhibition of neuropathic pain. First, increasing noradrenaline in the spinal cord by reuptake inhibition directly inhibits neuropathic pain through α 2 -adrenergic receptors. Second, increasing noradrenaline acts on the locus coeruleus and improves the function of an impaired <b>descending</b> noradrenergic <b>inhibitory</b> <b>system.</b> Serotonin and dopamine may reinforce the noradrenergic effects to inhibit neuropathic pain.

40|$|In {{addition}} to their well-known peripheral analgesic effects, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs also exert antinociceptive actions at the central level. However, {{it is not clear}} if these central effects are spinally or supraspinally mediated nor whether cyclooxygenase inhibition or the interaction of these drugs with neurones in a different way is responsible for these central analgesic actions. This project investigated the possible central analgesic mechanisms of action of these drugs. It involved the use of in vitro neonatal rat hemisected spinal cord preparations and sheep implanted with indwelling cervical intrathecal catheters. The dorsal root of the neonatal rat hemisected spinal cord preparations was electrically stimulated in such a way to evoke excitatory postsynaptic potentials in the ipsilateral ventral root. All records from this in vivo technique were identified as artefacts and no further experiments were carried out. Conscious, unrestrained, non-lame sheep chronically implanted with indwelling cervical intrathecal catheters were submitted to mechanical noxious stimulation of the left radius. They received cumulative intrathecal doses of ketoprofen, phenylbutazone, salicylic acid and tolfenamic acid as well as repetitive intrathecal administration of normal saline without significantly affecting mechanical thresholds. The same drugs and normal saline were also given intravenously and only ketoprofen and tolfenamic acid significantly raised the nociceptive thresholds. The involvement of spinal opioidergic and α 2 -adrenergic mechanisms in the hypoalgesia induced by the intravenous administration of ketoprofen in sheep was investigated. The prior intrathecal administration of naloxone and atipamezole at a dose that had no effect on nociceptive thresholds and reversed the analgesia mediated by intravenous fentanyl and xylazine, respectively, almost completely reversed the antinociceptive effects mediated by intravenous ketoprofen. These studies confirm that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can produce hypoalgesia even when inflammation is absent and, although they did not have a direct effect on the spinal cord, their analgesic action appeared to be spinally mediated by opioidergic and adrenergic <b>descending</b> <b>inhibitory</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R
40|$|Chronic pain {{is mainly}} {{a result of}} two processes: {{peripheral}} and central sensitization, which can result in neuroplastic changes. Previous psychophysical studies suggested a decrease of the so-called pain-inhibiting-pain effect (DNIC) in chronic pain patients. We aimed to study the DNIC effect on the neuronal level using magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography in 12 patients suffering from advanced unilateral knee osteoarthritis (OA). DNIC was induced in patients by provoking the typical OA pain by a slightly hyperextended joint position, while they received short electrical pain stimuli. Although the patients did not report a reduction of electrical pain perception, the cingulate gyrus showed a decrease of activation during provoked OA pain, while activity in the secondary somatosensory cortex did not change. Based on much stronger DNIC induction at comparable intensities of an acute counterirritant pain in healthy subjects this result suggests a deficit of DNIC in OA patients.

40|$|Although {{chronic pain}} affects all age ranges, it is {{particularly}} common in the elderly. One potential explanation for the high prevalence of chronic pain in the older population is impaired functioning of the <b>descending</b> pain <b>inhibitory</b> <b>system</b> which can be studied in humans using conditioned pain modulation (CPM) paradigms. In this study we investigated (i) the influence of age on CPM and (ii) the role of expectations, depression and gender as potential modulating variables of an age-related change in CPM. 64 healthy volunteers of three different age groups (young = 20 – 40 years, middle-aged = 41 – 60 years, old = 61 – 80 years) were studied using a classical CPM paradigm that combined moderate heat pain stimuli to the right forearm as test stimuli (TS) and immersion of the contralateral foot into ice water as the conditioning stimulus (CS). The CPM response showed an age-dependent decline with strong CPM responses in young adults but no significant CPM responses in middle-aged and older adults. These age-related changes in CPM responses could not be explained by expectations of pain relief or depression. Furthermore, changes in CPM responses did not differ between men and women.

Two {{studies were carried out}} in parallel in two groups of 26 paid healthy volunteers. The effects of active or sham rTMS (frequency, 10 Hz; intensity, 80 % resting motor threshold) applied to the right M 1 or DLPFC were compared in a double-blind randomized cross-over design. In the first series of experiments, we analyzed the effects of rTMS on thermal (heat and cold) detection and pain thresholds measured on both hands and the left foot, by standardized quantitative sensory testing methods. In the second series of experiments, we measured the effects of M 1 or DLPFC rTMS on the threshold and recruitment curves of the RIII nociceptive reflex evoked by ipsilateral electrical stimulation of the sural nerve and recorded on the biceps femoris of both lower limbs. In both studies, measurements were taken before and up to 60 min after the end of rTMS. Active rTMS of both M 1 and DLPFC significantly increased the thermal pain thresholds, measured for both hands and the left foot, this effect being most marked for cold pain. These effects, which lasted at least 1 h after rTMS, were selective because they were not associated with changes in non-painful thermal sensations. By contrast, the second study showed that rTMS of M 1 or DLPFC had no significant effect on the threshold or recruitment curve of the nociceptive flexion RIII reflex. Our findings demonstrate that unilateral rTMS of M 1 or DLPFC induces diffuse and selective analgesic effects in healthy volunteers. The lack of effect on the RIII reflex suggests that such analgesic effects may not depend on the activation of <b>descending</b> <b>inhibitory</b> <b>systems.</b> (C) 2009 International Association for the Study of Pain.

40|$|Chronic pain {{has been}} {{estimated}} to impact {{the economy of the}} United States by an annual cost of $ 635 billion per year and to affect approximately 100 million Americans (1). Pain is the primary reason patients seek medical attention yet physicians have few options for therapies and there remains a vast unmet medical need for effective and safe analgesics. Most of the drugs clinically available today either have limited efficacy or a variety of unwanted side effects. Discovery of novel therapeutics has been challenging with scientists struggling to find ways to better translate research from the bench-top to the bedside. One impediment in this process has been differences in preclinical and clinical assessment of pain. Preclinical models have historically relied heavily on evoked or reflexive endpoints in non-verbal animals while clinical measures of pain have the advantage of assessing changes in self-reported pain ratings. It is likely, and data from the studies reported in this dissertation show, that mechanisms that underlie threshold responses to evoked stimuli differ from those mediating affective (i. e., aversive) qualities of pain. A further confound is that many effective analgesics are narcotics that carry risk of addiction. Fear of addiction and possibly misuse for chronic treatment of pain may result in undertreatment in many patients. The most clinically relevant question in the management of pain is whether or not a treatment improves the patient's quality of life. Here, we demonstrate that the aversiveness of ongoing pain can be assessed using motivated behavior (conditioned place preference; CPP) and neurochemical output (in vivo NAc microdialysis). Additionally, we assessed the mechanistic effects of three clinically relevant analgesics. Our results show that: (1) pain relief is rewarding and activates reward circuitry that differs from circuits mediating addictive qualities of opiates, and (2) that drugs that mimic the consequences of engagement of <b>descending</b> <b>inhibitory</b> <b>systems</b> act by increasing spinal norepinephrine (NE) levels. These studies provide much needed information that helps build a platform from which more effective analgesics can be discovered and characterized in the preclinical setting and that may help in the introduction of new therapies for patients...|$|R

While brain processes related to other types of top-down modulation of pain have been studied extensively, no {{research has been conducted}} on the potential effects of active religious coping. Here, we aimed at investigating the neural mechanisms during pain modulation by prayer and their dependency on the opioidergic system. Twenty-eight devout Protestants performed religious prayer and a secular contrast prayer during painful electrical stimulation in two fMRI sessions. Naloxone or saline was administered prior to scanning. Results show that pain intensity was reduced by 11 % and pain unpleasantness by 26 % during religious prayer compared to secular prayer. Expectancy predicted large amounts (70 – 89 %) of the variance in pain intensity. Neuroimaging results revealed reduced neural activity during religious prayer in a large parietofrontal network relative to the secular condition. Naloxone had no significant effect on ratings or neural activity. Our results thus indicate that, under these conditions, pain modulation by prayer is not opioid-dependent. Further studies should employ an optimized design to explore whether reduced engagement of the frontoparietal system could indicate that prayer may attenuate pain through a reduction in processing of pain stimulus saliency and prefrontal control rather than through known <b>descending</b> pain <b>inhibitory</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} a proposed {{model in which}} manipulative therapy produces a treatment-specific initial hypoalgesic and sympathoexcitatory effect by activating a <b>descending</b> pain <b>inhibitory</b> <b>system.</b> The a priori hypothesis tested was that manipulative therapy produces mechanical hypoalgesia and sympatho-excitation beyond that produced by placebo or control. Furthermore, these effects would be correlated, thus supporting the proposed model. Design: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, repeated-measures study of the initial effect of treatment. Setting: Clinical neurophysiology laboratory. Subjects: Twenty-four subjects (13 women and 11 men; mean age, 49 yr) with chronic lateral epicondylalgia (average duration, 6. 2 months). Intervention: Cervical spine lateral glide oscillatory manipulation, placebo and control. Outcome Measures: Pressure pain threshold, thermal pain threshold, pain-free grip strength test, upper limb tension test 2 b, skin conductance, pileous and glabrous skin temperature and blood flux. Results: Treatment produced hypoalgesic and sympathoexcitatory changes significantly grater than those of placebo and control (p <. 03). Confirmatory factor-analysis modeling, which {{was performed on the}} pain-related measures and the indicators of sympathetic nervous system function, demonstrated a significant correlation (r =. 82) between the latencies of manipulation-induced hypoalgesia and sympathoexcitation. The Lagrange Multiplier test and Wald test indicated that the two latent factors parsimoniously and appropriately represented their observed variables. Conclusions: Manual therapy produces a treatment-specific initial hypoalgesic and sympathoexcitatory effect beyond that of placebo or control. The strong correlation between hypoalgesic and sympathoexcitatory effects suggests that a central control mechanism might be activated by manipulative therapy...|$|R
40|$|The {{combined}} {{oral contraceptive}} pill (COCP) has {{been implicated in}} the development of a number of chronic pain conditions. Modern COCP formulations produce a low endogenous estradiol, low progesterone environment similar to the early follicular phase of the natural menstrual cycle, with a variable effect on serum androgen levels. We used behavioural measures and functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the response to experimental thermal stimuli in healthy women, in both a natural and COCP-induced low endogenous estradiol state, to investigate whether alterations in central pain processing may underlie these observations in COCP users. Although COCP users overall did not require lower temperatures to obtain a fixed pain intensity, alterations in the brain response to these stimuli were observed. In a subgroup of COCP users with significantly reduced serum testosterone, however, lower temperatures were required. Region-of-interest analysis revealed that within key regions of the <b>descending</b> pain <b>inhibitory</b> <b>system,</b> activity in response to noxious stimulation varied with serum testosterone levels in both groups of women. Of particular interest, in COCP users, activity in the rostral ventromedial medulla increased with increasing testosterone and in those women with low testosterone, was significantly reduced compared to controls. These findings suggest that, in a low endogenous estradiol state, testosterone may be a key factor in modulating pain sensitivity via descending pathways. Specifically, failure to engage descending inhibition at the level of the rostral ventromedial medulla may be responsible for the reduction in temperature required by COCP users with low circulating testosterone...|$|R

Previous psychophysical studies suggested a decrease of the so-called pain-inhibiting-pain effect (DNIC) in chronic pain patients. We aimed to study the DNIC effect on the neuronal level using magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography in 12 patients suffering from advanced unilateral knee osteoarthritis (OA). DNIC was induced in patients by provoking the typical OA pain by a slightly hyperextended joint position, while they received short electrical pain stimuli. Although the patients did not report a reduction of electrical pain perception, the cingulate gyrus showed a decrease of activation during provoked OA pain, while activity in the secondary somatosensory cortex did not change. Based on much stronger DNIC induction at comparable intensities of an acute counterirritant pain in healthy subjects this result suggests a deficit of DNIC in OA patients. We suggest that the strength of DNIC is subject to neuronal plasticity of <b>descending</b> <b>inhibitory</b> pain <b>systems</b> and diminishes during {{the development of a}} chronic pain condition.

It has been suggested that buprenorphine {{is associated with}} a higher antihyperalgesia/analgesia ratio than &micro;-opioid receptor agonists. The primary outcome of this study was therefore to investigate relative differences in antihyperalgesia and analgesia effects between morphine and buprenorphine in an inflammatory pain model in volunteers. The secondary outcome was {{to examine the relationship between}} pain sensitivity and opioid-induced effects on analgesia, antihyperalgesia, and descending pain modulation. Subjects and methods: Twenty-eight healthy subjects were included. The study was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, five-arm crossover study with a multimodal (electrical, mechanical, and thermal stimuli) testing technique. After baseline assessments, intravenous infusions of morphine (10 / 20 mg), buprenorphine (0. 3 / 0. 6 mg), or placebo (normal saline) were administered over a 210 -minute period, during which a cold pressor test, heat injury (47 &deg;C, 7 minutes, 12. 5 cm 2), and the first postburn assessment were done. After completion of the drug infusions, two additional postburn assessments were done. The subjects were monitored during each 8 -hour session by an anesthesiologist. Results: For nearly all tested variables, significant dose-dependent analgesic effects were demonstrated. The median antihyperalgesia/analgesia ratio (secondary hyperalgesia/heat injury relative to placebo) for low-dose morphine was 0. 01 (interquartile range: &minus; 6. 2; 9. 9), 0. 00 (&minus; 2. 4; 2. 1) for high-dose morphine, 0. 03 (&minus; 1. 8; 2. 1) for low-dose buprenorphine, and 0. 00 (&minus; 3. 2; 1. 1) for high-dose buprenorphine (P &gt; 0. 466). There were no significant differences in opioid responses between high and low pain-sensitive subjects (P &gt; 0. 286). High-dose buprenorphine, compared to placebo, was associated with a significantly enhanced action of the <b>descending</b> <b>inhibitory</b> pain control <b>system</b> (P = 0. 004). Conclusion: The present study, using multimodal testing technique, could not demonstrate any significant differences between morphine and buprenorphine in the profiles of antihyperalgesia and analgesia.

40|$|Introduction: Nucleus cuneiformis (NCF), {{as part of}} <b>descending</b> pain <b>inhibitory</b> <b>system,</b> cooperates with periaqueductal gray (PAG) and rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) in supraspinal {{modulation}} of pain. Cannabinoids have analgesic {{effects in}} the PAG, RVM and NCF. The transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV 1) can be activated by anandamide and WIN 55, 212 - 2 as a cannabinoid receptor agonist. The aim {{of the current study}} is to investigate the possible interplay between the cannabinoid and vanilloid systems for modulation of pain at the NCF. Methods: In this study, a cannabinoid receptor agonist, WIN 55, 212 - 2 (15 μg/ 0. 3 μl DMSO), and selective TRPV 1 receptor antagonist, capsazepine (10, 25, 50 and 100 nmol/ 0. 3 μl DMSO), were microinjected bilaterally into the NCF, and tail-flick and formalin tests were used to assess the animal’s pain-related behaviors at 5 -min intervals for a 60 -min period. Results: Our findings demonstrated that analgesic effect of WIN 55, 212 - 2 were dose-dependently attenuated by capsazepine in both tests. In the tail-flick test, capsazepine at both doses of 50 (P< 0. 01) and 100 (P< 0. 001) nmol could significantly prevent the antinociceptive effect of WIN 55, 212 - 2 while capsazepine, in formalin test, could decreased its antinociceptive effect at the dose of 50 nmol (P< 0. 05) as well. On the other hand, solely administration of the highest dose of capsazepine in both tests did not alter the pain-related behaviors. Discussion: It suggests a possible role for TRPV 1 receptors in NCF-mediated cannabinoid-induced antinociception...|$|R
40|$|Inflammatory {{response}} and cell death in hepatocytes are hallmarks of chronic liver disease, and, therefore, {{can be effective}} therapeutic targets. Neurotropin® (NTP) is a drug widely used in Japan and China to treat chronic pain. Although NTP has been demonstrated to suppress chronic pain through the <b>descending</b> pain <b>inhibitory</b> <b>system,</b> the action mechanism of NTP remains elusive. We hypothesize that NTP functions to suppress inflammatory pathways, thereby attenuating disease progression. In the present study, we investigated whether NTP suppresses inflammatory signaling and cell death pathways induced by interleukin- 1 β (IL- 1 β) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) in hepatocytes. NTP suppressed nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation induced by IL- 1 β and TNFα assessed by using hepatocytes isolated from NF-κB-green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter mice and an NF-κB-luciferase reporter system. The expression of NF-κB target genes, Il 6, Nos 2, Cxcl 1, ccl 5 and Cxcl 2 induced by IL- 1 β and TNFα was suppressed after NTP treatment. We also found that NTP suppressed the JNK phosphorylation induced by IL- 1 β and TNFα. Because JNK activation contributes to hepatocyte death, we determined that NTP treatment suppressed hepatocyte death induced by IL- 1 β and TNFα in combination with actinomycin D. Taken together, our data demonstrate that NTP attenuates IL- 1 β and TNFα-mediated inflammatory cytokine expression and cell death in hepatocytes through the suppression of NF-κB and JNK. The results {{from the present study}} suggest that NTP may become a preventive or therapeutic strategy for alcoholic and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in which NF-κB and JNK are thought to take part...|$|R
40|$|Prenatal stress {{strengthens}} tonic {{pain and}} provokes depression. The serotoninergic system {{is involved in}} these processes. We recently showed that maternal buspirone, a 5 -HT 1 A receptor agonist, protects against the adverse effects of in utero stress on depression and pain in adult rat offspring. Using a similar maternal treatment with buspirone, we focus here on the infant stage, which {{is important for the}} correction of prenatal abnormalities. Maternal buspirone before restraint stress during the last week of pregnancy decreased the time of immobility in the forced swim test in the infant offspring. Prenatal stress increased formalin-induced pain {{in the second part of}} the time-course of the response to formalin in males of middle infancy but in the first part of the response in males of late infancy. The effect was reversed by maternal buspirone. Pain dominated in males of both middle and late infancy but the time-course of formalin pain in infant females revealed a slower development of the processes. The results show that the time-course of formalin-induced pain in infant rats reacts to prenatal stress in an age-dependent and sexually dimorphic manner. Our finding of opposite influences of prenatal stress and buspirone before prenatal stress on formalin-induced pain during the interphase indicates that functional maturity of the <b>descending</b> serotonergic <b>inhibitory</b> <b>system</b> occurs in late infancy males (11 -day-olds), and 5 -HT 1 A receptors participate in this process. The data provide evidence that maternal treatment with buspirone prior to stress during pregnancy alleviates depression-like and tonic pain-related behaviors in the infant offspring...|$|R
40|$|Large {{quantities}} of morphine injected {{directly into the}} brainstem of spinal anaesthetized cats inhibited the noxious heat-evoked excitation of dorsal horn neurones. The amounts required {{were similar to those}} that were required intravenously in cats with the spinal cord intact or transected. When the spinal cord was intact the amount of morphine microinjected into the brainstem required to inhibit the excitation of dorsal horn neurones was about ten fold less than it was in spinal animals. It is concluded that large, but not small doses of morphine microinjected into the brainstem can exert effects on the spinal cord after first entering the circulation. The effects of small doses are attributed to a local action in the brainstem which causes inhibition of spinal neurones either by activating <b>descending</b> <b>inhibitory</b> neuronal <b>systems</b> or by liberating endogenous substances which reach the spinal cord via the cerebro-spinal fluid. The concentrations of morphine achieved at various distances from the site of injection by the microinjection of microgram quantities and the time courses of the concentration changes were calculated from diffusion equations, assuming diffusion coefficients of 3 or 5 X 10 (6) cm 2 s- 1. The curves obtained closely approximated those obtained experimentally. The concentrations achieved at distances up to 2 mm from the site of injection of 10 micrograms of morphine were calculated to exceed 10 (- 4) M and the time-courses of these concentration changes were compatible with the time course of inhibition of spinal neurones, or the production of analgesia after microinjection. Such concentrations are vastly in excess of those achieved in the brain after the systemic administration of morphine in analgesic doses. It is concluded that the local effects in the brainstem produced by the microinjection of microgram {{quantities of}} morphine have no relevance to the mechanism of analgesia produced by systemic administration...|$|R
40|$|Motor cortex {{stimulation}} (MCS) {{has been}} used to treat patients with neuropathic pain resistant to other therapeutic approaches; however, the mechanisms of pain control by MCS are still not clearly understood. We have demonstrated that MCS increases the nociceptive threshold of naive conscious rats, with opioid participation. In the present study, the effect of transdural MCS on neuropathic pain in rats subjected to chronic constriction injury of the sciatic nerve was investigated. In addition, the pattern of neuronal activation, evaluated by Fos and Zif 268 immunolabel, was performed in the spinal cord and brain sites associated with the modulation of persistent pain. MCS reversed the mechanical hyperalgesia and allodynia induced by peripheral neuropathy. After stimulation, Fos immunoreactivity (Fos-IR) decreased in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and in the ventral posterior lateral and medial nuclei of the thalamus, when compared to animals with neuropathic pain. Furthermore, the MCS increased the Fos-IR in the periaqueductal gray, the anterior cingulate cortex and the central and basolateral amygdaloid nuclei. Zif 268 results were similar to those obtained for Fos, although no changes were observed for Zif 268 in the anterior cingulate cortex and the central amygdaloid nucleus after MCS. The present findings suggest that MCS reverts neuropathic pain phenomena in rats, mimicking the effect observed in humans, through activation of the limbic and <b>descending</b> pain <b>inhibitory</b> <b>systems.</b> Further investigation of the mechanisms involved in this effect may contribute to the improvement of the clinical treatment of persistent pain.

40|$|Pain {{is highly}} {{prevalent}} {{in patients with}} Parkinson's disease (PD), but {{little is known about}} the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. The susceptibility to pain is known to depend on ascending and descending pathways. Because parts of the <b>descending</b> pain <b>inhibitory</b> <b>system</b> involve dopaminergic pathways, dysregulations in dopaminergic transmission might contribute to altered pain processing in PD. Deficits in endogenous pain inhibition can be assessed using conditioned pain modulation (CPM) paradigms. Applying such a paradigm, we investigated i) whether CPM responses differ between PD patients and healthy controls, ii) whether they are influenced by dopaminergic medication and iii) whether there are effects of disease-specific factors. 25 patients with idiopathic PD and 30 healthy age- and gender-matched controls underwent an established CPM paradigm combining heat pain test stimuli at the forearm and the cold pressor task on the contralateral foot as the conditioning stimulus. PD patients were tested under dopaminergic medication and after at least 12 hours of medication withdrawal. No significant differences between CPM responses of PD patients and healthy controls or between PD patients "on" and "off" medication were found. These findings suggest (i) that CPM is insensitive to dopaminergic modulations and (ii) that PD is not related to general deficits in descending pain inhibition beyond the known age-related decline. However, at a trend level, we found differences between PD subtypes (akinetic-rigid, tremor-dominant, mixed) with the strongest impairment of pain inhibition in the akinetic-rigid subtype. There were no significant differences between CPM responses of patients compared to healthy controls or between patients "on" and "off" medication. Differences between PD subtypes at a trend level point towards different pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the three PD subtypes which warrant further investigation and potentially differential therapeutic strategies in the future...|$|R
30|$|Although CEH is the {{headache}} we best understand, the SMT {{mechanism of action}} is unknown. It is argued that CEH might originate from a complexity of nociceptive afferent responses involving the upper cervical spine (C 1, C 2 and C 3), leading to a hypersensitivity state of the trigeminal pathway conveying sensory information for the face {{and much of the}} head (Kerr 1972; Bogduk 2004). Research has thus, suggested that SMT may stimulate neural <b>inhibitory</b> <b>systems</b> at different spinal cord levels and might activate various central <b>descending</b> <b>inhibitory</b> pathways (McLain and Pickar 1998; Vernon 2000; Vicenzino et al. 2001; Boal and Gillette 2004; De Camargo et al. 2011).

40|$|Several {{studies have}} shown that motor cortex {{stimulation}} provided pain relief by motor cortex plasticity and activating <b>descending</b> <b>inhibitory</b> pain control <b>systems.</b> Recent evidence indicated that the melanocortin- 4 receptor (MC 4 R) in the periaqueductal gray {{played an important role in}} neuropathic pain. This study was designed to assess whether MC 4 R signaling existed in motor cortex- periaqueductal gray- spinal cord neuronal circuitry modulated the activity of sympathetic pathway by a virally mediated transsynaptic tracing study. Pseudorabies virus (PRV) - 614 was injected into the left gastrocnemius muscle in adult male MC 4 R-green fluorescent protein (GFP) transgenic mice (n = 15). After a survival time of 4 – 6 days, the mice (n = 5) were randomly assigned to humanely sacrifice, and spinal cords and brains were removed and sectioned, and processed for PRV- 614 visualization. Neurons involved in the efferent control of the left gastrocnemius muscle were identified following visualization of PRV- 614 retrograde tracing. The neurochemical phenotype of MC 4 R-GFP-positive neurons was identified using fluorescence immunocytochemical labeling. PRV- 614 /MC 4 R-GFP dual labeled neurons were detected in spinal IML, periaqueductal gray and motor cortex. Our findings support the hypothesis that MC 4 R signaling in motor cortex-periaqueductal gray-spinal cord neural pathway may participate in the modulation of the melanocortin-sympathetic signaling and contribute to the descending modulation of nociceptive transmission, suggesting that MC 4 R signaling in motor cortex- periaqueductal gray-spinal cord neural pathway may modulate the activity o...|$|R
40|$|Background Painful {{neuropathy}} {{is associated}} with plasticity changes in the nervous system. Standard repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive technique used to study changes in cortical excitability and to inhibit pain perception. Deep rTMS is a newer development that allows direct activation of deeper neuronal populations, by a unique coil design termed the H-coil. This {{study was designed to}} assess whether deep rTMS applied over the motor cortical lower-limb representation relieves pain in patients with diabetic neuropathy. Methods Patients were randomly assigned to receive daily real or sham H-coil rTMS for 5 consecutive days. After a 5 -week washout period, they crossed over to the alternative treatment for additional 5 days (according to a crossover study design). Outcome measures were changes in the visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain and in area and threshold of RIII nociceptive flexion reflex (RIII reflex). Results Of the 25 patients randomized, 23 completed the study. After real rTMS, the VAS scores decreased significantly (p= 0. 01), and so did RIII reflex area (p< 0. 01), while no significant effects in these variables were induced by the sham rTMS treatment. The rTMS-induced changes in the outcome measures disappeared about 3 weeks after stimulation. All patients tolerated stimulation well. Conclusions Deep H-coil rTMS provides pain relief in patients with diabetic neuropathy. This innovative technique can induce a therapeutic effect on brain areas that otherwise remain difficult to target. rTMS may produce its analgesic effects, inducing motor cortex plasticity and activating <b>descending</b> <b>inhibitory</b> pain control <b>systems...</b>|$|R
