25|$|When General Bell first {{sent me to}} Victor I {{offered him}} certain {{evidence}} {{in regard to the}} perpetrators of the Vindicator explosion, which he has failed to follow up, but which would have led to the arrest and conviction of the men who are responsible for the placing of that infernal machine. At about the 20th of January, 1904, by order of the adjutant of Teller County military district, and under special direction of Major T. E. McClelland and General F. M. Reardon, who was the Governor's confidential adviser regarding the conditions in that district, a series of street fights were commenced between men of Victor and soldiers of the National Guard on duty there. Each fight was planned by General Reardon or Major McClelland and carried out under their actual direction. Major McClelland's instructions were literally to knock them down, knock their teeth down their throats, bend in their faces, kick in their ribs and do everything except kill them. These fights continued more or less frequently up to the 22d of March. About the middle of February General Reardon called me into Major McClelland's office and asked me <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> man in whom I could place absolute confidence. I called in Sergeant J. A. Chase, Troop C, First Cavalry, N. G. C., and, in the presence of Sergeant Chase, he stated to me that, owing to the refusal of the Mine Owners' Association to furnish the necessary money to meet the payroll of the troops, it had become necessary to take some steps to force them to put up the cash, and he desired me to take Sergeant Chase and hold up or shoot the men coming off shift at the Vindicator mine at 2 o'clock in the morning. I told General Reardon that I {{was under the impression that}} most of these men caught the electric car that stopped at the shaft house so that such a plan would be impracticable. He then said to me that the same end could be reached if I would take the sergeant and fire fifty or sixty shots into the Vindicator shaft house at some time during the night. Owing to circumstances making it impossible for Sergeant Chase to accompany me, I took Sergeant Gordon Walter of the same troop and organization, and that same night did at about 12:30 o'clock fire repeatedly into the Vindicator and Lillie shaft house. Something like sixty shots were fired from our revolvers at this time. Afterwards we mounted our horses and rode into Victor and into the Military Club, reporting in person to General Reardon and Major McClelland. The next day General Reardon directed me to take Sergeant Walter and look over the ground in the rear of the Findlay mine with a view of repeating the performance there, but before the plan could be carried out General Reardon countermanded the order, stating his reason to be that the mine owners had promised to put up the necessary money the next day, which, as a matter of fact, they did. General Reardon, in giving me directions regarding the shooting up of the Vindicator shaft house, stated that Governor Peabody, General Bell, he himself, and I were the only ones who knew anything about the plan.|$|E

500|$|Throughout {{his tenure}} in Australia, Lansbury sent letters home, {{revealing}} {{the truth about}} conditions facing immigrants. To a friend [...] he wrote in March 1885: [...] "Mechanics are not wanted. Farm labourers are not wanted... Hundreds {{of men and women}} are not able to get work... The streets are foul day and night, and <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> sister I would shoot her dead rather than see her brought out to this little hell on earth". In May 1885, having received from Isaac Brine sufficient funds for a passage home, the Lansbury family left Australia for good.|$|E

When ex-husband Russell Brand left her on December 30, 2011, she felt devastated and contemplated suicide. Perry revealed to Vogue in June 2012 that she planned to record a [...] "darker" [...] album than her previous records.

500|$|The {{scene with}} Grampa and Bea eating their pills seductively is a {{reference}} to the 1963 film Tom Jones. Two of the people waiting in line to ask for Grampa's money are Darth Vader and the Joker. When the family is suggesting places they could go, Homer suggests the Springfield Mystery Spot, {{a reference to}} the Mystery Spot in California—although Lisa says that the Springfield Spot is simply a puddle of mud. They eventually decide to go to the Discount Lion Safari, however. The Diz-Nee-Land amusement park that Grampa visits with Bea's money has a sign that reads [...] "Diz-Nee-Land—Not affiliated with Disneyland, Walt Disney World, or anything else from the Walt Disney Company". The shot of Grampa sitting at a diner resembles the 1942 American painting Nighthawks. Before Grampa attempts to bet all of his money on Roulette he quotes the poem [...] "If—" [...] by Rudyard Kipling. The climax scenes, where Grampa uses the money to fix up the Springfield Retirement Castle, is {{a reference to the}} ending of the 1932 film <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>Had</b> <b>a</b> Million. Dr. Marvin Monroes 'Monroe Box' is meant to be a spoof of B. F. Skinners Skinner Box.|$|E
500|$|In 1975, after George Moscone {{had been}} elected Mayor, he {{appointed}} Charles Gain as his Chief of Police. Gain, whose conciliatory position towards African Americans had branded {{him as one of}} the most liberal law enforcement officers in the country, soon earned the ire of the police force. Gain implemented policies that proved unpopular with his staff, such as painting police cars powder blue, and barring officers from drinking on the job. His lenient policies towards gays also angered the police force. When asked what he would do if a gay police officer came out, Gain replied [...] "I certainly think that a gay policeman could be up front about it under me. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> gay policeman who came out, I would support him 100 percent." [...] This statement sent shockwaves through the police department, and made national headlines. Made during the first week of Gain's tenure, the remark also made Mayor Moscone extremely unpopular with the police. The two were so intensely disliked by the police that in 1977 rumors circulated about a plan by right-wing police officers to assassinate Gain, and a year later similar plans formed targeting Mayor Moscone. Upon being informed of this threat, Moscone hired a bodyguard.|$|E
500|$|In December 2009, Gaga {{revealed}} that {{she planned to}} cancel {{the concept of the}} original shows of The Monster Ball Tour and start afresh. She felt that the revamp of the show was needed as the original tour was constructed in a very short span of time. Gaga recalled that after West and she split up for this tour, she was unsure if she could get a show together in time, but nevertheless wanted to promote The Fame Monster. Hence she was able to put together [...] "something that, in truth, I never would have done <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> longer amount of time". The revamp of the tour was planned from the arena shows in the United Kingdom from February 2010. [...] "My team thinks I'm completely psychotic. But I don't fucking care what they think. [...] Well, just to give you an idea, the stage is about four {{times the size of the}} one we're on now and conceptually, it's completely different. One thing that has been lost over the past 10-15 years, in pop music, is the idea of showbiz. And this is definitely going to bring that back", clarified Gaga. According to James Montgomery of MTV, the show recalled the film musicals The Wizard of Oz (1939) and West Side Story (1961), the science-fiction film Metropolis (1927), and the television mini-series Angels in America (2003).|$|E

[...] The flooding of the Elbow and Bow Rivers swamped many areas of the city, including Stampede Park where the Saddledome is located. [...] The event level of the arena was reported to be filled with water up to the 10th row of seating and the dressing rooms and control room for the video replay screen were under water. At a press conference held on June 22, 2013, team president Ken King stated that the arena had flooded up to the eighth row and that the event level of the facility was a [...] "total loss." [...] He added that the team's equipment and some memorabilia had also been destroyed, but expressed confidence that the facility would be repaired and ready in time for the October start to the season. Prospect Ben Hanowski was among the 100,000 people forced to evacuate by the floods. He described the situation as [...] "almost terrifying," [...] but praised the city's community spirit in the disaster: [...] "I didn’t know how I was going to get [...] I didn’t know if I could get a rental car out of the garage and through some water to get up here, and I had a person come up to me right away and ask <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> place to go and <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> way to get there and basically offered me a ride somewhere.

2500|$|By {{the age of}} 20, when {{he passed}} through Vilnius, his fame preceded him. Both Rabbi Eliyahu Eliezer Grodnenski [...] the leading Rav of Vilna and the {{son-in-law}} of Rabbi Yisroel Salanter [...] and Rabbi Elinke Levinsohn of Kretinga desired the young Torah prodigy for their own son-in-law. The two went to Rabbi Yitzchak Elchanan Spektor of Kovno to decide which family would merit this honor. After hearing each one's position, Rabbi Spector asked to meet Rabbi Grodzinski, and spoke at length with him on various Torah topics. Afterward, Rabbi Spector told the two prospective fathers-in-law: [...] "The truth is that <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> daughter to marry off, I would take him and leave you both out in the cold.

[...] Stuart was, however, welcomed into summer stock theater on the east coast, and performed in Man and Superman, The Animal Kingdom, The Night of January 16th, Accent on Youth, Route 101, Mr. and Mrs. North, The Pursuit of Happiness, Here Today, Sailor Beware and was Emily to Thornton Wilder’s Stage Manager—under Wilder’s own direction—in Our Town. But for two years, as many readings, lunches and cocktail parties as she attended, no director, producer or writer (not even Sheekman) gave Stuart a role on Broadway.|$|E
2500|$|His New York stage {{debut in}} 1931 {{immediately}} led to film offers and Laughton's first Hollywood film was The Old Dark House (1932) with Boris Karloff, {{in which he}} played a bluff Yorkshire businessman marooned during a storm with other travelers in a creepy remote Welsh manor. He then played a demented submarine commander in Devil and the Deep with Tallulah Bankhead, Gary Cooper and Cary Grant, and followed this with his best-remembered film role of that year as Nero in Cecil B. DeMille's The Sign of the Cross. Laughton turned out other memorable performances during that first Hollywood trip, repeating his stage role as a murderer in Payment Deferred, playing H.G. Wells' mad vivisectionist Dr. Moreau in Island of Lost Souls, and the meek raspberry-blowing clerk in the brief segment of <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>Had</b> <b>A</b> Million, directed by Ernst Lubitsch. He appeared in six Hollywood films in 1932. His association with director Alexander Korda began in 1933 with the hugely successful The Private Life of Henry VIII (loosely based {{on the life of}} King Henry VIII), for which Laughton won an Academy Award. He also continued to act occasionally on stage, including a US production of The Life of Galileo by (and with) Bertolt Brecht.|$|E
