5|$|Gravitational waves, {{a direct}} {{consequence}} of Einstein's theory, are distortions of geometry that propagate {{at the speed}} of light, and {{can be thought of as}} ripples in spacetime. They should not be confused with the <b>gravity</b> <b>waves</b> of fluid dynamics, which are a different concept.|$|E
5|$|In December 2015 and to {{a lesser}} extent in April and May 2016, {{researchers}} working on Japan's Akatsuki mission observed bow shapes in the atmosphere of Venus. This was considered direct evidence of the existence of perhaps the largest stationary <b>gravity</b> <b>waves</b> in the solar system.|$|E
5|$|For {{reasons that}} remain obscure, the planet's {{thermosphere}} {{is at an}} anomalously high temperature of about 750K. The planet is {{too far from the}} Sun for this heat to be generated by ultraviolet radiation. One candidate for a heating mechanism is atmospheric interaction with ions in the planet's magnetic field. Other candidates are <b>gravity</b> <b>waves</b> from the interior that dissipate in the atmosphere. The thermosphere contains traces of carbon dioxide and water, which may have been deposited from external sources such as meteorites and dust.|$|E
40|$|The {{robustness}} of the parameterized <b>gravity</b> <b>wave</b> {{response to}} an imposed radiative perturbation in the middle atmosphere is examined. When momentum is conserved and for reasonable <b>gravity</b> <b>wave</b> drag parameters, the response to a polar cooling induces polar downwelling above {{the region of the}} imposed cooling, with consequent adiabatic warming. This response is robust to changes in the <b>gravity</b> <b>wave</b> source spectrum, background flow, <b>gravity</b> <b>wave</b> breaking criterion, and model lid height. When momentum is not conserved, either in the formulation or in the implementation of the <b>gravity</b> <b>wave</b> drag parameterization, the response becomes sensitive to the above-mentioned factors—in particular to the model lid height. The spurious response resulting from nonconservation is found to be nonnegligible in terms of the total <b>gravity</b> <b>wave</b> drag–induced downwelling...|$|R

Observations of Medium Frequency (MF) radar winds made at Pameungpeuk (7. 5 °S, 107. 5 °E) and Tirunelveli (8. 7 °N, 78 °E) between February and March 2010 {{are used}} to study <b>gravity</b> <b>wave</b> {{activity}} in the equatorial mesosphere and lower thermosphere (80 – 100 km). <b>Gravity</b> <b>wave</b> variances in the 20 – 120 min period band and their spectra are computed. Daily values of <b>gravity</b> <b>wave</b> variances show modulations on time scales ranging from diurnal to planetary waves. Spectra of wave variances display peaks at tidal periods and show evidence of <b>gravity</b> <b>wave</b> modulation at 24, 12, and 8 h periods. Statistical investigation of waves, made using Stokes parameter technique, indicates that the directionality of the mesospheric wave field is highly anisotropic. The role of lower-atmospheric sources on the MLT <b>gravity</b> <b>wave</b> variability is also examined. Spatial distribution of cloud top temperature and rainfall rates are used. GW activity at mesosphere-lower thermosphere (MLT) heights shows clear anticorrelation with the cloud top temperature and positive correlation with rainfall rates suggesting a possible link between observed <b>gravity</b> <b>wave</b> variability and the variations in the deep tropical convection.

5|$|Wake lows form due to {{adiabatic}} warming {{in the wake}} of mature squall lines at the back edge of their rain shields, where evaporative cooling is unable to offset warming due to atmospheric subsidence, or downward motion. They can be caused by <b>gravity</b> <b>waves</b> which duct through boundary layers which are deep and cold to the north of a weather front. As with mesoscale high-pressure areas behind a squall line, when new thunderstorm development stops along the squall line, the wake low will weaken as well. Clearing conditions will accompany the wake low, due to the descending warm air mass associated with the feature. Within the United States, these systems have been observed to form in the Mississippi river valley, Southeast, Florida, and Great Plains.|$|E
5|$|HeliumII also {{exhibits}} a creeping effect. When a surface extends past {{the level of}} heliumII, the heliumII moves along the surface, against the force of gravity. HeliumII will escape from a vessel that is not sealed by creeping along the sides until it reaches a warmer region where it evaporates. It moves in a 30nm-thick film regardless of surface material. This film is called a Rollin film and is named after the man who first characterized this trait, Bernard V. Rollin. As {{a result of this}} creeping behavior and heliumII's ability to leak rapidly through tiny openings, {{it is very difficult to}} confine liquid helium. Unless the container is carefully constructed, the heliumII will creep along the surfaces and through valves until it reaches somewhere warmer, where it will evaporate. Waves propagating across a Rollin film are governed by the same equation as <b>gravity</b> <b>waves</b> in shallow water, but rather than gravity, the restoring force is the van der Waals force. These waves are known as third sound.|$|E

40|$|Three {{idealized}} {{simulations of}} thunderstorm outflows are presented. Each outflow {{is a response}} to an instan-taneous low-level cooling. The vertical structures of the coolings differ as do the environments in which the outflows form, and consequently the dynamics of the outflows differ. One outflow is a gravity current, another is a <b>gravity</b> <b>wave,</b> and the third comprises both a gravity current and a <b>gravity</b> <b>wave.</b> The horizontal transport of mass is important for the advance of the gravity-current outflow, but not for the <b>gravity</b> <b>wave</b> outflow, and it is suggested that this is the defining dynamical distinction between the two outflows. The simulations are compared to observations and it is suggested that some outflows previously characterized as gravity currents may better fit the <b>gravity</b> <b>wave</b> or <b>gravity</b> current/wave archetypes. It is also noted that the <b>gravity</b> <b>wave</b> component of an outflow may be generated directly by low-level cooling in addition to the commonly suggested mechanism of the interaction of a gravity current with a stable layer. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Profiles of {{temperature}} and wind measured by meteorological balloons {{are used to}} examine the changes in <b>gravity</b> <b>wave</b> activity at high latitudes during a final spring-time breakdown of the Arctic stratospheric vortex. The measurements show that <b>gravity</b> <b>wave</b> potential energy den-sities in the lower stratosphere decreased dramatically as the cyclonic wintertime vortex gave way to the weak anti-cyclonic summertime circulation. The reduction in <b>gravity</b> <b>wave</b> activity after the vortex breakdown is attributed pri-marily to increased critical level filtering of orographic waves and lowered stratospheric wind speeds...|$|R

40|$|It {{is shown}} that under {{reasonable}} assumptions, conservation of angular momentum provides a strong constraint on <b>gravity</b> <b>wave</b> drag feedbacks to radiative perturbations {{in the middle}} atmosphere. In the time mean, radiatively induced temperature perturbations above a given altitude z cannot induce changes in zonal mean wind and temperature below z through feedbacks in <b>gravity</b> <b>wave</b> drag alone (assuming an unchanged <b>gravity</b> <b>wave</b> source spectrum). Thus, despite the many uncertainties in the parameterization of <b>gravity</b> <b>wave</b> drag, the role of <b>gravity</b> <b>wave</b> drag in middle-atmosphere climate perturbations may be much more limited than its role in climate itself. This constraint limits the possibilities for downward influence from the mesosphere. In order for a <b>gravity</b> <b>wave</b> drag parameterization to respect the momentum constraint and avoid spurious downward influence, any nonzero parameterized momentum flux at a model lid must be deposited within the model domain, and there must be no zonal mean sponge layer. Examples are provided of how violation of these conditions leads to spurious downward influence. For planetary waves, the momentum constraint does not prohibit downward influence, but it limits the mechanisms by which it can occur: in the time mean, downward influence from a radiative perturbation can only arise through changes in reflection and meridional propagation properties of planetary waves...|$|R

Some observation results are given. The <b>gravity</b> <b>wave</b> induced velocities measured by both techniques {{are estimated to}} compare the <b>gravity</b> <b>wave</b> activities between the places with same latitudes and different longitudes.

40|$|The {{meteorological}} {{control of}} <b>gravity</b> <b>wave</b> activity through ﬁltering by winds and generation by spontaneous adjustment of unbalanced ﬂows is investigated. This investigation {{is based on}} a new analysis of Rayleigh LiDAR measurements of <b>gravity</b> <b>wave</b> activity in the upper stratosphere-lower mesosphere (USLM, 40 – 50 km) on 152 nights at Poker Flat Research Range (PFRR), Chatanika, Alaska (65 ◦ N, 147 ◦ W), over 13 years between 1998 and 2014. The LiDAR measurements resolve inertia-gravity waves with observed periods between 1 h and 4 h and vertical wavelengths between 2 km and 10 km. The meteorological conditions are deﬁned by reanalysis data from the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA). The <b>gravity</b> <b>wave</b> activity shows large night-to-night variability, but a clear annual cycle with a maximum in winter,and systematic interannual variability associated with stratospheric sudden warming events. The USLM <b>gravity</b> <b>wave</b> activity is correlated with the MERRA winds and is controlled by the winds in the lower stratosphere through ﬁltering by critical layer ﬁltering. The USLM <b>gravity</b> <b>wave</b> activity is also correlated with MERRA unbalanced ﬂow as characterized by the residual of the nonlinear balance equation. This correlation with unbalanced ﬂow only appears when the wind conditions are taken into account, indicating that wind ﬁltering is the primary control of the <b>gravity</b> <b>wave</b> activity...|$|R
40|$|A nearby {{analytic}} {{model of a}} <b>gravity</b> <b>wave</b> driven middle atmosphere circulation is formulated. The simplified model represents the one-dimensional interaction of a single <b>gravity</b> <b>wave</b> mode with a zonal-mean flow. Solutions of this model are shown to agree very well with numerical results from a more complete mean-flow/gravity-wave model (essentially the model developed by Holton, 1982). A single nondimensional parameter, the ratio of a mean flow radiative forcing parameter, and the <b>gravity</b> <b>wave</b> momentum flux incident into the middle atmosphere from below largely determine {{the solution of the}} model. For typical middle atmosphere parameter values, an approximate solution can be obtained, and this solution permits the parameter dependence of the circulation to be characterized very simply. The <b>gravity</b> <b>wave</b> driven circulation extends downward from the level (the breaking level, approximately) where the momentum flux equals the mean flow radiative forcing...|$|R
