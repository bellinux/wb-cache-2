5|$|The breed {{is prone}} to skin disorders. About a quarter of Westies {{surveyed}} are affected by atopic dermatitis, a heritable chronic allergic skin condition. A higher proportion of males are affected compared to females. An uncommon but severe breed-specific skin condition, <b>hyperplastic</b> dermatosis, may affect West Highland White Terriers, both juveniles and adults dogs. Affected dogs can suffer from red hyperpigmentation, lichenification, and hair loss. In the initial stages, this condition can be misdiagnosed as allergies or less serious forms of dermatitis.|$|E
5|$|By far most {{information}} on toxicity of dioxin-like chemicals {{is based on}} animal studies utilizing TCDD. Almost all organs are affected by high doses of TCDD. In short-term toxicity studies in animals the typical effects are anorexia and wasting, and even after a huge dose animals die only 1 to 6 weeks after the TCDD administration. Seemingly similar species have varying sensitivities to acute effects: lethal dose for a guinea pig is about 1µg/kg, but to a hamster {{it is more than}} 1,000µg/kg. A similar difference can be seen even between two different rat strains. Various <b>hyperplastic</b> (overgrowth) or atrophic (wasting away) responses are seen in different organs, thymus atrophy is very typical in several animal species. TCDD also affects the balance of several hormones. In some species, but not in all, severe liver toxicity is seen. Taking into account the low doses of dioxins in the present human population, only two types of toxic effects have been considered to cause a relevant risk to humans: developmental effects and cancer.|$|E
25|$|In adrenal Cushing's, excess {{cortisol}} {{is produced}} by adrenal gland tumors, <b>hyperplastic</b> adrenal glands, or adrenal glands with nodular adrenal hyperplasia.|$|E
25|$|In TRAP overexpressing mice, it {{has been}} found that the {{affected}} mice are grossly obese. This has led to the hypothesis that TRAP has involvement in <b>hyperplastic</b> obesity.|$|E
25|$|Because 11β-hydroxylase {{activity}} {{is not necessary}} {{in the production of}} sex steroids (androgens and estrogens), the <b>hyperplastic</b> adrenal cortex produces excessive amounts of DHEA, androstenedione, and especially testosterone.|$|E
25|$|On MRI the retinal {{dysplasia}} {{that occurs}} with the syndrome can be indistinguishable from persistent <b>hyperplastic</b> primary vitreous, or the dysplasia of trisomy 13 and Walker–Warburg syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Glioblastoma multiforme {{tumors are}} {{characterized}} {{by the presence of}} small areas of necrotizing tissue that are surrounded by anaplastic cells. This characteristic, as well as the presence of <b>hyperplastic</b> blood vessels, differentiates the tumor from Grade 3 astrocytomas, which do not have these features.|$|E
25|$|The MRAP is {{equipped}} with ShieldAll armor made in cooperation with Batelle. ShieldAll is based on available components, including FlexAll <b>hyperplastic</b> material. ShieldAll is made with the weight being one-third lighter and less bulky than steel. Depending on operational needs, the Alpha can have add-on armor added.|$|E
25|$|Chronic {{sinusitis}} {{cases are}} subdivided into cases with polyps and cases without polyps. When polyps are present, {{the condition is}} called chronic <b>hyperplastic</b> sinusitis; however, the causes are poorly understood and may include allergy, environmental factors such as dust or pollution, bacterial infection, or fungus (either allergic, infective, or reactive).|$|E
25|$|The {{adrenal cortex}} is <b>hyperplastic</b> and overstimulated, with no {{impairment}} of the mineralocorticoid pathway. Consequently, levels of DOC, corticosterone, and 18-deoxycorticosterone are elevated. Although these precursors of aldosterone are weaker mineralocorticoids, the extreme elevations usually provide enough volume expansion, blood pressure elevation, and potassium depletion to suppress renin and aldosterone production. Some persons with 17α-hydroxylase deficiency develop hypertension in infancy, and nearly 90% {{do so by}} late childhood. The low-renin hypertension is often accompanied by hypokalemia due to urinary potassium wasting and metabolic alkalosis. These features of mineralocorticoid excess are the major clinical clue distinguishing the more complete 17α-hydroxylase deficiency from the 17,20-lyase deficiency, which only affects the sex steroids. Treatment with glucocorticoid suppresses ACTH, returns mineralocorticoid production toward normal, and lowers blood pressure.|$|E
25|$|Unlike many {{dolphins}} and whales, {{the seven}} vertebrae {{in the neck}} are not fused together, allowing the animal to turn its head laterally without needing to rotate its body. This gives the head a lateral manoeuvrability that allows an improved field of view and movement and helps in catching prey and evading predators in deep water. The rostrum has about eight to 10 small, blunt, and slightly curved teeth {{on each side of}} the jaw and a total of 36 to 40 teeth. Belugas do not use their teeth to chew, but for catching hold of their prey; they then tear them up and swallow them nearly whole. Belugas only have a single spiracle, which is located on the top of the head behind the melon, and has a muscular covering, allowing it to be completely sealed. Under normal conditions, the spiracle is closed and an animal must contract the muscular covering to open the spiracle. A beluga's thyroid gland is larger than that of terrestrial mammals – weighing three times more than that of a horse – which helps it to maintain a greater metabolism during the summer when it lives in river estuaries. It is the marine cetacean that most frequently develops <b>hyperplastic</b> and neoplastic lesions of the thyroid.|$|E
500|$|Several breed-specific and nonspecific {{health issues}} {{appear in the}} breed, {{including}} a condition in young dogs nicknamed [...] "westie jaw" [...] which causes an overgrowth of bone in the jaw of the dog. It can also be prone to skin disorders, with a breed-specific condition called <b>hyperplastic</b> dermatosis occurring. They are very energetic and need plenty of exercise. Cousin to the Cairn Terrier, the Westie was bred to hunt small rodents at places such as farms.|$|E
500|$|Russo & Russo {{from the}} Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia {{conducted}} a study in 1980 examining the proposed correlation between abortion and breast cancer. While analysing {{the effects of the}} carcinogen 7,12-Dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) on the DNA labeling index (DNA-LI) in terminal end buds (TEBs), terminal ducts (TDs) and alveolar buds (ABs) of Sprague-Dawley rats in various stages of reproductive development, they found that rats who had interrupted pregnancies had no noticeable increase in risk for cancer. However, they did find that pregnancy and lactation provided a protective measure against various forms of benign lesions, such as <b>hyperplastic</b> alveolar nodules and cysts. While results did suggest that rats who had interrupted pregnancies might be subject to [...] "similar or even higher incidence of benign lesions" [...] than virgin rats, there was no evidence to suggest that abortion would result in a higher incidence of carcinogenesis. [...] A more thorough examination of the phenomenon was conducted in 1982, confirming the results. A later study in 1987 further explained their previous findings. After differentiation of the mammary gland resulting from a full-term pregnancy of the rat, the rate of cell division decreases and the cell cycle length increases, allowing more time for DNA repair.|$|E
2500|$|The {{excessive}} {{tissue is}} composed of cellular, inflamed fibrous connective tissue. The appearance of an epulis fissuratum microscopically is an overgrowth of cells from the fibrous connective tissue. [...] The epithelial cells are usually hyperkeratotic and irregular, <b>hyperplastic</b> rete ridges are often seen.|$|E
2500|$|The {{cause is}} usually {{pressure}} from the flange of a denture which causes chronic irritation and a <b>hyperplastic</b> response in the soft tissues. Women during pregnancy can also present with an epulis, which will resolve after birth. [...] Fibroepithelial polyps, pedunculated lesions of the palate beneath an upper denture, are associated with this condition. [...] A cobble-stone appearance similar to an epulis fissuratum in a patient without dentures can be diagnostic of Crohn's disease. Epulis fissuratum can also appear around dental implants.|$|E
2500|$|ACTH stimulates {{growth of}} the adrenal cells and {{increases}} LDL receptors to amplify transport of cholesterol into {{the cells of the}} adrenal cortex which make adrenal steroids, where it accumulates since little can enter the mitochondria for conversion to steroid. Normally, adrenal steroids then signal their presence to the brain to moderate ACTH levels (feedback inhibition). [...] However, in the absence of this, ACTH levels are elevated and cholesterol uptake by the cortical cells continues unabated. [...] The adrenals become markedly enlarged (<b>hyperplastic)</b> by the accumulated lipid. Lipid accumulation is thought to damage the cells further (“second hit hypothesis”).|$|E
50|$|<b>Hyperplastic</b> {{candidiasis}} is variable. Usually {{there is}} <b>hyperplastic</b> and acanthotic epithelium with parakeratosis. There is an inflammatory cell infiltrate and hyphae are visible. Unlike {{other forms of}} candidiasis, <b>hyperplastic</b> candidiasis may show dysplasia.|$|E

5000|$|As {{is evident}} from their name, sessile {{serrated}} and traditional serrated adenomas (TSAs) have a serrated appearance and {{can be difficult to}} distinguish microscopically from <b>hyperplastic</b> polyps. Making this distinction is important, however, since SSAs and TSAs have the potential to become cancers, [...] while <b>hyperplastic</b> polyps do not.|$|E

50|$|Candidal leukoplakia {{is usually}} {{considered}} to be a largely historical synonym for a type of oral candidiasis, now more commonly termed chronic <b>hyperplastic</b> candidiasis, rather than a subtype of true leukoplakia. However, some sources use this term to describe leukoplakia lesions that become colonized secondarily by Candida species, thereby distinguishing it from <b>hyperplastic</b> candidiasis.|$|E
