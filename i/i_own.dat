5|$|Reviewers {{asserted}} that the film's music mainly lifted {{to the success of}} Bandslam from reviews, especially the ska version of Everything <b>I</b> <b>Own,</b> that the film is full of unexpected pleasures set to a surprisingly retro soundtrack. Similarly, Michael Rechtshaffen of The Hollywood Reporter emphasized the effect of the film's music-driven comedy set against the backdrop of a high school battle of the bands competition which manages {{to come up with a}} fresh backbeat for the familiar alienated teen refrain, boosted by a talented cast and authentic soundtrack.|$|E

500|$|The Puritan {{leaders of}} the Massachusetts Bay Colony gloated over Hutchinson's {{suffering}} and also that of Mary Dyer, a follower who suffered the premature and stillbirth of a severely deformed infant. The leaders classified the women's misfortunes as the judgement of God. [...] Winthrop wrote, [...] "She brought forth not one, but thirty monstrous births or thereabouts", then continued, [...] "see how the wisdom of God fitted this judgment to her sin every way, for look—as she had vented misshapen opinions, so she must bring forth deformed monsters." [...] Massachusetts continued to persecute Hutchinson's followers who stayed in the Boston area. Laymen were sent from the Boston church to Portsmouth to convince Hutchinson of her errors; she shouted at them, [...] "the Church at Boston? I know no such church, neither will <b>I</b> <b>own</b> it. Call it the whore and strumpet of Boston, but no Church of Christ!" ...|$|E
500|$|Colbert {{describes}} himself as racially color-blind and unable to visually identify a person's race, explaining, [...] "Now, I don't see race ... People tell me I'm white, and I believe them, because <b>I</b> <b>own</b> a lot of Jimmy Buffett albums." [...] His race-blindness is a recurring joke, and this statement is often repeated on the show with different punch lines. For this same reason he believed that he was black when he had an emotional breakdown after watching Obama's inauguration video. He later qualified these statements in his book, stating, [...] "When I say I don't see race, I mean I don't see Black people. But I can spot a Mexican at a hundred paces." [...] Despite all these claims, Colbert often boasts {{that he has a}} large number of token minority friends (including Jon Stewart as [...] " [...] Jewish friend" [...] and Oprah Winfrey as [...] " [...] black friend"), although in the photos shown these friends appear decidedly uninterested in him. He has stated a similar inability to distinguish between the sexes, claiming to only [...] "see an American". This comes in contradiction of his at times sexist behavior, for instance, calling only on men during an open discussion with his audience on women's issues.|$|E
500|$|... "Phresh Out the Runway" [...] is a hip hop and rave song, with a {{duration}} of three minutes and forty-two seconds. Jon Caramanica of The New York Times noted that the song's composition is a [...] "chaotic dense spray of boasts over a muscular, scraping beat". Brad Stern of MTV Buzzworthy labeled the song as [...] "noisy, trap-tastic twerker" [...] that is reminiscent of Rihanna's 2012 single [...] "Birthday Cake" [...] and according to him, contains blazin' beats, brags aplenty, nasty unapologetic attitude. Alexis Petridis of The Guardian noted that [...] "Phresh Out the Runway" [...] is an aggregation off [...] "distorted" [...] synthesisers derived from Joey Beltram's 1990 record [...] "Mentasm" [...] "until it sounds weird and disorientating". The Boston Globes James Reed labeled [...] "Phresh Out the Runway" [...] as a club banger containing a heavy bass [...] "that rumbles more in your chest instead of rattling your feet." [...] Alex Macpherson of Fact wrote that on the song [...] "Rihanna sprays declamations like machine gun fire over what could pass for a lost early ’90s Prodigy rave anthem." [...] The lyrical content of [...] "Phresh Out the Runway" [...] revolves around Rihanna explaining how if any of her crew does not respect her, then she should no longer remain with her, singing: [...] "How could you be so hood, but you're so fuckin' pop?/ How could you be so fun and sound like you're selling rocks?". On the song, Rihanna sounds [...] "indignant" [...] and [...] "impressed" [...] with being herself and proclaims: [...] "Walk up in this bitch like <b>I</b> <b>own</b> the ho".|$|E

500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} generally mixed reception from critics. The {{day after the}} premiere, Mark Lorando of The Times-Picayune wrote that while it was [...] "not the laugh riot The Simpsons have spoiled us to expect – our appetite for showbiz parodies is waning – the episode did have its moments." [...] He further added that he especially liked [...] "the sign posted outside the movie studio gate: 'No Artistic Integrity Beyond This Point.'" [...] While reviewing the eleventh season of The Simpsons, DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson commented on the episode, writing that [...] "Gibson actually {{does a good job}} here, and it’s amusing to see Homer’s terrible movie ideas. This isn’t classic Simpsons, but it starts the season on a pretty good note." [...] However, an article in Salon magazine from 2000 points to [...] "Beyond Blunderdome" [...] as the greatest precursor to that Homer would be more predominant as “Jerkass Homer” in the Scully era as showrunner, a Homer who [...] "is not only dumb, but [...] disgusting and semi-sociopathic. This is the Homer who, in the season opener , showed Marge's wedding ring to Mel Gibson and stated, 'This is a symbol that as per our marriage, she's my property and <b>I</b> <b>own</b> her.'" [...] Gibson's performance has generally been praised. Simon Crerar of The Times listed his performance as one of the thirty-three funniest cameos {{in the history of the}} show. Similarly, Total Films Nathan Ditum ranked Gibson's performance as the seventh best guest appearance in the show's history in a list of twenty people, calling it [...] "Another ace self-effacing appearance from a Hollywood high-flyer".|$|E

[...] While he paraded through Harlem swinging a loaded cane, he was always immaculately dressed in tailored suits with a magnificently waxed mustache, an expensive $2,000 diamond ring and $3,000 diamond shirt studs. He denied the allegations. [...] "My enemies say that I am {{the head of the}} 'Black Hand' business, that I run the blackmail bomb business and that <b>I</b> <b>own</b> all the lotteries," [...] Gallucci complained a week before he was killed. [...] "They are wrong. <b>I</b> <b>own</b> bakeries, ice and wood shops, shoe shining and repair shops and similar places, but I am not king of the 'Black Hand'."

2500|$|Georgiana's nephew once {{remarked that}} she thought of {{politics}} and [...] "nothing else", while her sister cared little for it. In 1838, Lady Carlisle articulated a negative opinion of Charles Dickens, who was then emerging as a successful author. [...] "I know there are such unfortunate beings as pickpockets and streetwalkers. I am very sorry for it and am very much shocked at their mode of life, but <b>I</b> <b>own</b> I do not much wish to hear what they say to one another", she said.

For instance, Isaiah, describing the condition to which Babylon was to be reduced after her ruin, says that she shall become the abode of satyrs, lamiæ, and strigæ (in Hebrew, lilith). This last term, according to the Hebrews, signifies the same thing, as the Greeks express by strix and lamiæ, which are sorceresses or magicians, who seek to put to death new-born children. Whence it comes that the Jews are accustomed to write in the four corners of the chamber of a woman just delivered, [...] "Adam, Eve, be gone from hence lilith."...The ancient Greeks knew these dangerous sorceresses by the name of lamiæ, and they believed that they devoured children, or sucked away all their blood till they died.|$|E

Kiplinger's personal finance magazine, Changing Times, listed the AMC Gremlin as first among the best subcompact used cars as [...] "selected by top mechanics for good value, good service." [...] Five years after the Gremlin's introduction, the mechanics liked the six-cylinder engine and most preferred automatic transmission. Comments included, [...] "I have one.
