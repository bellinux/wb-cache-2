I am unable to defend at a time when departmental costs and scene loads are in an acute state the load imposed by Rebecca on Design and Supply and the expenditure upon extras and costumes... the vast area of the hall and the stairway never justified the great expenditure of effort required in building and one is left with a very clear impression of reaching a point where the department must be accused of not knowing what it is doing.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the sinking, public inquiries were set up in Britain and the United States. The US inquiry began on 19April under the chairmanship of Senator William Alden Smith, while the British inquiry commenced in London under Lord Mersey on 2May 1912. They reached broadly similar conclusions: the regulations on the number of lifeboats that ships had to carry were out of date and inadequate; Captain Smith had failed to take proper heed of ice warnings; the lifeboats had not been properly filled or crewed; and the collision was the direct result of steaming into a <b>danger</b> <b>area</b> at too high a speed. Captain Lord of Californian was strongly criticised by both inquiries for failing to render assistance to Titanic.|$|E

25|$|Below the outfall, Gibraltar Point National Nature Reserve {{is located}} {{to the east}} among the dunes and saltings. It is a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and a Ramsar site, which {{provides}} a diverse habitat for birds such as grey plover and knot, plants including brackish water crowfoot and insects including the red-banded sand-wasp, among others. Gibraltar Point Sailing Club is located at Gibraltar Point, and the east {{bank of the river}} channel is used for mooring yachts. Now called Wainfleet Harbour, the channel crosses sand and mudflats to reach Wainfleet Swatch, an area of water protected from the North Sea by the Inner Knock sandbank at low water. The area to the south of Wainfleet Harbour is called Wainfleet Sand and is a <b>danger</b> <b>area.</b> It has been used for artillery practice since at least 1890, but may have been used for cannon and musketry practice long before that. More recently, it was part of RAF Wainfleet, and was used for weaponry practice by aircraft, until the closure of the range in December 2009.|$|E
40|$|The primary {{function}} of navigation {{system is to}} provide route search and road guidance for safe driving for drivers. However, the existing route search system provides a simple service that looks up the shortest route using a safe driving DB without considering different road characteristics {{for the safety of}} the drivers. In order to maintain the safe driving, rather than searching the shortest path, a navigation system, in which the <b>danger</b> <b>areas</b> and/or the dangerous time zones have been considered, is required. Therefore, in this paper we propose a strategy of searching a navigation path to avoid <b>danger</b> <b>areas</b> for safe driving by using the A * algorithm. In the strategy, when evaluating the path-specific fitness of the navigation nodes, different heuristic weights were assigned to different types of risk areas. In particular, we considered three kinds of <b>danger</b> <b>areas,</b> such as accident-prone sections where accidents occur frequently, school zones, and intersection regions, as well as the time slots when the probability of danger is high. From computer simulation, the results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can provide the way to avoid <b>danger</b> <b>areas</b> on the route searching an...|$|R

25|$|Jason Gillespie was {{distinctly}} uncomfortable {{during his}} {{stay at the}} crease as he was tested immediately by a few Ajit Agarkar deliveries before being run-out after attempting an over-ambitious fourth run to reduce Australia to 317/9. The Australian tailenders added further six runs before light worsened and play could not be continued anymore. The Indians had dominated a damp squib of a day, where only sixteen overs could be bowled. The Australian batsmen squandered a strong platform set by their top-order, to lose an incredible 7 wickets for 61 runs. The {{second day of the}} match was notable for the sixteen overs of play during which only two bowlers were used: Ajit Agarkar and Zaheer Khan. However, on a worrying note, the Indian Captain Sourav Ganguly was warned for his bowlers not completing nine less overs than the scheduled amount of overs that was to be bowled. This constituted a level two offence in the ICC's Code of Conduct and Ganguly was liable to be penalised fifty percent of his match-fees. This risked Ganguly being the first captain in test cricket to be docked for slow over-rates after he became the first captain to be docked a couple of runs for running in the <b>Danger</b> <b>Area</b> in a test against New Zealand in Ahmedabad earlier that year.|$|E
500|$|Chapter II of Part III of the ISA {{empowers}} the Minister to take various {{steps to}} preserve public security. Within a security area, the Minister may declare areas to be danger areas, controlled areas or protected places. No person {{is allowed to}} enter or remain in a <b>danger</b> <b>area</b> unless escorted {{by a member of}} a security force, and to enforce this prohibition security forces can take all necessary measures, including those that are [...] "dangerous or fatal to human life". A person who is injured while in a <b>danger</b> <b>area</b> unlawfully cannot make any legal claim for it, though compensation may be awarded if a compensation board thinks it is equitable to do so. The declaration of an area as a controlled area enables the Minister to order that people within the area may only reside within that portion of the area declared to be the [...] "residential part", and that they may not venture beyond the residential part during certain hours. Failure to comply with such orders is a criminal offence.|$|E

500|$|The 1-2-3 rule (mariner's 1-2-3 rule or <b>danger</b> <b>area)</b> is a {{guideline}} commonly taught to mariners for severe storm (specifically hurricane and tropical storm) tracking and prediction.

[...] These numbers were close to the 10-year average for the 1982–1991 time frame. [...] However, these errors have decreased to near 50-100-150 as NHC forecasters become more accurate. The [...] "danger area" [...] to be avoided is constructed by expanding the forecast path by a radius equal to the respective hundreds of miles plus the forecast wind radii (size of the storm at those hours).|$|E

The Japanese ships spotted Lee's force around 23:00, though Kondo misidentified the battleships as cruisers. Kondo ordered the Sendai group of ships—plus Nagara and four destroyers ("D" [...] on the maps)—to engage and destroy the U.S. force before he brought the bombardment force of Kirishima and heavy cruisers ("E" [...] on the maps) into Ironbottom Sound. The U.S.ships ("A" [...] on the maps) detected the Sendai force on radar but did not detect the other groups of Japanese ships. Using radar targeting, the two U.S.battleships opened fire on the Sendai group at 23:17. Admiral Lee ordered a cease fire about five minutes later after the northern group disappeared from his ship's radar. However, Sendai, Uranami, and Shikinami were undamaged and circled out of the <b>danger</b> <b>area.</b>|$|E

2500|$|After the trawl {{had been}} {{dragging}} {{for some time}} on the ocean bottom in 65 fathoms, it was raised and the crew stood by to receive the catch. Those with experience of mine sweeping during the war were startled when the mine tumbled out on deck. It stood about four feet high with a diameter of two feet and weighed about five cwt. Long immersion and rolling about {{on the ocean floor}} had made the mine harmless. The cap and firing mechanism were gone, and there was no cable. A quantity of explosive still remained. This was taken out and the mine brought back to Sydney where the trawler berthed yesterday morning. Any marks of identification are hidden by a heavy marine growth. Captain J. Farquhar, master of the Koraaga, who gained a knowledge of mines while fishing In the North Sea, said last night that he believed the mine had been cut adrift from a minefield during sweeping, and after going to the bottom was carried south by the current. It was possible, he said, that the Koraaga was responsible for rendering the mine harmless, since she swept the Gabo field with the Brolga and Gunundaal. The Gabo minefield was first discovered by one of the State trawlers, and that before the <b>danger</b> <b>area</b> was properly swept the Cumberland was blown up. [...] "The laying of the mines by the Wolf was very cleverly done," [...] he said. [...] "They were put down at night in an area that was {{in full view of the}} Gabo lighthouse during daylight."
