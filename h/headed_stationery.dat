5000|$|In May 2009 the Parliamentary {{ombudsman}} instructed Keen {{to repay}} Â£4,583 for sending unsolicited letters to her constituents. Keen {{invited them to}} coffee mornings using prepaid envelopes and on House of Commons <b>headed</b> <b>stationery,</b> a breach of Parliamentary rules as they are only permitted {{to be used for}} replies. Keen said the correspondence was sent by [...] "a new member of staff ... on House of Commons instead of constituency stationery. When it was brought to my attention I immediately refunded the cost." ...|$|E

A loyal monarchist, Lord St John enjoyed {{a close relationship with}} the British Royal Family. Soon after his elevation to the Lords, photographs of him in purple bedroom slippers appeared in Hello! magazine while he lounged in the bedroom of his Northampton rectory with a signed photograph of Princess Margaret prominently displayed. All personal notes were written in purple ink. After his elevation to the Lords he was an active member and used only official House of Lords <b>headed</b> <b>stationery.</b> He lived in Montpellier Square, Knightsbridge, and had a house in Northamptonshire.The Catholic Herald, a newspaper that St John-Stevas had contributed to on many occasions, wrote on his death that 'Unlike {{a lot of people who}} have trodden the corridors of power, he was not in the least secretive about his experiences. He loathed Mrs Thatcher, and he idolised the Queen Mother, Princess Margaret and Pius IX. His house in Northamptonshire was filled with relics and pictures of all three. He even had a cassock which was supposed to have belonged to the Blessed Pius, and .... on occasions he wore it to fancy dress parties'.|$|E

He took the Manor of East Hendred on 5 December 1814 {{to make way}} for Lord Binning, a government candidate. Hawkins put him up as one of two candidates at Helston at the 1818 election, but they were defeated by the interest of the Duke of Leeds. A similar result occurred in the March 1820 election. Trelawny-Brereton died suddenly that September.|$|R
5000|$|Hamish Campbell (Ex <b>Head</b> of MI9 <b>Stationery</b> / <b>Head</b> of MI9, KORPS agent, Series 7) Played by Finn Den Hertog. When the MI High {{team are}} {{investigating}} the League of Matahari they find a ten-year-old video of Hamish speaking of his investigation into the League. Before his investigation {{he was known as}} one of MI9's best agents. Aneisha even mentions that he managed to outsmart the Russian Embassy using wool from his jumper. After the investigation he was stood down as an agent. The story was that he was permanently affected by a paranoia serum on a mission, tried to get into the League but was turned down and saw conspiracies everywhere (an effect of the serum). This turns out to be false after the MI High team discover the truth about the League. After the League of Matahari was disbanded a new Head of MI9 was needed. After Frank refuses the job, Aneisha puts Hamish forward as {{he was the only one}} who stood up to the League from the beginning. He gladly accepts the job and there becomes Chief Agent Officer. In [...] "We Need to Talk About KORTEX" [...] / [...] "The Last Stand" [...] he is revealed to be a KORPS agent and is arrested.|$|R
